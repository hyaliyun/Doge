The leader of the Madrid branch of the Spanish political party Vox, she serves as a member of the 11th term of the Assembly of Madrid.  Biography  Born on 4 February, 1974 her birthplace is equally reported to be either Cuba or Madrid. Monasterio has claimed that her birthplace is Madrid.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR5GweFUdIg&t;=338 Her parents were the owners of the Central de Az√∫car del Golfo in the Caribbean island. Her father opened the first KFC in Spain. Monasterio reportedly began studies in architecture at the Higher Technical School of Architecture of Madrid (ETSAM) in 1992. Although she appears to have been a good student, it took her some years to submit the final project for her degree, years in which she was already working in the field of architecture. Monasterio (still without architect degree) and her architecture firm focused on acquiring properties and turning them into high-end lofts. She earned her degree in architecture in 2009 (the same year she joined the ). This circumstance has led to the questioning of several plans and building certifications, she reportedly signed in the capacity of \\"facultative director\\" at least as back in time as 2003. The projects include partial demolitions for which she implicitly claimed to have the professional qualification which is condicio sine qua non to sign them off.  Professional career  Monasterio studied architecture at the Technical University of Madrid, and specialized in Urban Environments. In 1997 she received a prize from Otis International for her design of 3000 homes in Hong Kong. In 2000, Monasterio founded her architecture firm called Roc√≠o Monasterio and Associates. Monasterio at a Vox presentation in Vistalegre. Political career Roc√≠o Monasterio joined Vox in 2014. Currently she is the president of VOX Madrid. Monasterio is the president of Vox Madrid, and the vice-secretary of Social Matters of the party. Monasterio (on right) at a HazteOir demostration Monasterio is against abortion. In a march on April 15, 2018, she affirmed that her party, Vox, stands for the rights of the unborn. Monasterio is opposed to radical feminism stating that it tends to demonize the traditional family. In December 2018, Monasterio stated that her life has been threatened and that she's been physically assaulted, spit on, and insulted as well as hit by rocks by \\"feminists\\". Monasterio wants to replace Violence Against Women laws with Violence Against Family, to protect not only women who are victims of violence but any family member who may be a victim of family violence. Monasterio is a speaker for HazteOir (English: Make Yourself Heard), having supported the latter group's polemical bus sporting a message that denied the existence of transexuality in children. Monasterio is against the practice of surrogacy and talking to children about choices in sexual orientation such as zoophilia, which regional authorities have stated do not exist as she describes. She stated she'd move the Madrid Gay Pride Parade, the largest in Europe, from the city centre to the Casa de Campo park, and that marriage is between a man and a woman, that other unions are civil unions, not marriages. She was one of the promoters of a requirement before the Spanish Ombudsman filed in November 2016 criticising that the regional government of Madrid had banned conversion therapies to \\"cure gays\\", asking for a repeal initiative to be formulated before the Constitutional Court. Monasterio is a climate change denier, would like to deport all illegal immigrants and believes criminals should receive life in prison. Monasterio condemns the Cuban government of Ra√∫l and Fidel, and successor, Miguel D√≠az-Canel. Personal life On May 15, 2001, Monasterio married real estate developer Iv√°n Espinosa de los Monteros.

The manor was built in 1856 by Samuel and John Fourche Warren, sons of the Revolutionary War veteran and legislator William Warren. The Warren family moved several times before finally locating upon the present site. The property has been occupied by prominent owners including the Reed, Warren and Shelby families, in the order in which they are named. The architecture of the home includes diamond shaped window panes across the front, a wide hand carved door and window facings and massive enameled white mantels.  Location  The historic home is located at 3044 US-127 Danville, KY 40422. Danville is a small town in Boyle County located in central Kentucky.  History  The construction of Warrenwood by the Warren brothers, John (1806‚Äì1863) and Samuel Warren (1807‚Äì1878), sons of William Warren (1771‚Äì1825), began in 1840 and was completed in 1856. Mrs. William Warren used the home to entertain guests such as the Card Club and Daughters of the American Revolution. The Warren family lived in the home until 1908, when it was sold. The name Warrenwood is derived from that of the original owner and builder. In 1933 Warrenwood was sold at auction to Henry Hudson, who purchased 379 acres for $53.05 per acre from the Joint Stock & Land Bank, Lexington. After his death, Hudson's widow and two daughters operated the Warrenwood farm. The property was in possession of the family for over 21 years. In 1976, Warrenwood was completely renovated by the H.C. Abbott family. Warrenwood was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. The fight to preserve Warrenwood came in 1990 when US Highway 127 was being widened to four lanes between Danville and Junction City. During this time, the owner of Warrenwood, Mary Oldham, fought to preserve her home and the entrance to her property. After Mary Oldham's attempts, the state reviewed the road work in order to lessen the impact on Warrenwood and preserve the property.  Architecture  With its ‚Äúgingerbread‚Äù style architecture, Warrenwood Manor is one example of Gothic Revival architecture in Kentucky. The house rests on a stone foundation that was constructed two years before the house was erected. Three gables on the front part of the house are trimmed in a white wood in the decorative ‚Äúgingerbread‚Äù design. The roof of the porch, which extends nearly all the way across the three story structure, is edged with a balustrade and is supported by eight slender columns. Three large limestone steps lead up to the house from the lawn. Double windows with diamond-shaped glass panes across the front of the structure carry out the style of architecture in the mid-1800 period of early America. The house walls are three bricks thick. The bricks for the home were made in kilns on the property and lumber from the forest on the lands was used in the interior of the home. The home also includes nine working fireplaces to heat each room. The rooms of the house are eighteen feet wide and ceilings fourteen feet high.  The Farm  Warrenwood farm was originally 419 acres and was sold in 1932 by Danville Realty Company which subdivided the farm into three tracts of suitable sizes.

The purpose of the committee was to examine the education sector and provide recommendations for improvement. It recommended the establishment of a pay scale for private sector schools to end a discrepancy between the wages of private and public sector teachers. The government decided to approve the separate pay scale of private teachers from 1 January 1980. The committee had also recommended the formation of Directorate of Inspection and Control to monitor the distribution of funds and quality control in the private education sector. Accordingly the government of Bangladesh created the Department of Inspection and Audit under the Ministry of Education on 1 October 1980.

(KPD). During the politically dead-locked period directly before the Hitler government took power in Berlin she became a Communist member of the parliament (\\"Landtag\\") of the People's State of Hesse (\\"Volksstaat Hessen\\"). Biography =Provenance and early years= Marie Kuhn was born in Egelsbach, at that time a small town a short distance to the north of Darmstadt. Heinrich K√ºhn (1849‚Äì1929), her father was a farmer who became the father of seven daughters: Marie was the sixth. On 23 April 1914 Marie Kuhn married the plasterer Adolf Theodor Schmidt (1890‚Äì1943). =Politics= During the war which broke out a little more than three months later Marie and Adolf Schmidt were both deeply involved with the \\"proletarian\\" peace movement. Marie Schmidt was an early member of the Communist Party of Germany which in 1918/19 emerged out of it. In her home community she was elected to membership of the Egelsbach local council. She also made her mark across Hesse more widely, gaining a reputation as an effective and aggressive public speaker representing the Hesse Communist Party, and acquiring the soubriquet \\"Rote Marie\\" (\\"Red Mary\\"). During 1931/32 Marie Schmidt served as one of just three women members of the 70-seat Hesse state parliament (\\"Landtag\\"). Having secured her seat in the election of 15 November 1931 she made just one brief speech in the chamber. That was in February 1932 when she contributed in a debate over a government bill. Following the National Socialist take-over in January 1933, in March 1933, Marie Schmidt and her husband were arrested in the aftermath of the Reichstag fire. They were detained for several weeks and then released. Under the dictatorship the Communist Party and political activism were banned. After 1945 Schmidt, by now a widow, rejoined the Communist Party, but with Communism now seen increasingly as a proxy for Soviet expansionist ambitions the party no longer enjoyed significant support in what became, in 1949, the German Federal Republic (West Germany). Marie Schmidt withdrew from public political engagement. Nevertheless, after the Communist Party had been banned by the West German Constitutional Court in 1956, and then, as Cold War concerns began to recede, quietly relaunched with a new name in 1968, Marie Schmidt (re)joined the \\"new\\" party. =Theo= The couple's son Theo evidently shared their political convictions. In 1934 he fled to the Saarland which remained under French military occupation. That meant there was little likelihood of close surveillance or sudden arrest by the German Security Services. In 1936 Theo went to Spain to fight for the \\"antifascist\\" International Brigades, and was killed in 1937 during the fighting for Taragona. =Later years= After the death of her husband in 1943 Marie Schmidt worked in a Frankfurt post office. She moved to live with her daughter Margot in nearby Neu-Isenburg in 1945. It was here that in 1971 she died.

It was one of the main water sources and the main avenue of river- borne commerce for the Abbasid capital of Baghdad. History The Nahr Isa certainly has its origin in pre-Islamic times and the canal system dug by the Sasanians; a canal known as the Nahr Rufayl, attested during the time of the Muslim conquest of Persia, has been variously identified with the lower course of the Isa Canal with one of its branches in the area of Baghdad. The actual Isa Canal however was dug at the time of the founding of Baghdad in the mid-8th century by an Abbasid prince named Isa, whose exact identity is disputed: most authorities ascribed it to Caliph al-Mansur's uncle Isa ibn Ali, but the earliest source, Ibn Serapion, credits the work to al-Mansur's nephew Isa ibn Musa. No trace of it remains today. Course and description Apart from the older Dujayl Canal to the north, which silted up in the 10th century, the Nahr Isa was the first in a sequence of navigable canals from north to south that flowed from the Euphrates to the Tigris. The Nahr Isa was followed by the Nahr Sarsar, Nahr Malik, and Nahr Kutha. The canal began just below the city of Anbar on the Euphrates, passing a great bridge known as Qantarah Dimimma after a nearby village, close to the then small hamlet of Fallujah. Running almost due east, it crossed the districts of Fƒ´r≈´z ShƒÅb≈´r and Maskin, and at the town of al-Muhawwal, shortly before reaching the western outskirts of Baghdad, the Sarat Canal (Nahr al-Sarat) branched off to the left. The two canals passed on in parallel to West Baghdad, where the Sarat Canal separated the quarters of Qattrabul in the north and Baduraya in the south, before joining the Tigris directly south of the Basra Gate of the Round City of al-Mansur. The main branch of the Isa Canal turned south and then northeast in a great bend around the southern suburb of Karkh, before too joining with the Tigris at al-Fardah, the harbour of Baghdad. Before entering Karkh, the Nahr Isa branched off into the Karkhaya Canal, which itself branched off into a number of smaller canals that criss-crossed that great suburb. The Sarat Canal had a few of branches itself: in mid-distance between its origin and the Round City the Trench of Tahir split off to the northeast, passing above the Round City; as well as the Little Sarat, which branched off from the Trench of Tahir and rejoined the main course of the Sarat. Early 10th-century accounts describe the Nahr Isa as being crossed by nine masonry- built bridges (qan·π≠arah). The early 13th-century description of the canal by Yaqut al-Hamawi in his KitƒÅb Mu'jam al-BuldƒÅn reports that only two, Qan·π≠arat al-ZayyƒÅtƒ´n and Qan·π≠arat al-BustƒÅn, were still in use, but Yaqut's epitomist contradicts this in his MarƒÅ·π£id, where these two are listed as destroyed, with the Qan·π≠arat al-YƒÅsiriyya, Qan·π≠arat al-Shawk, and Qan·π≠arat Banƒ´ Zurayq mentioned as still standing. On the other hand, the 12th-century scholar Ibn al-Jawzi reports that the Qan·π≠arat Banƒ´ Zurayq had collapsed in 1042, and was not rebuilt at the time. Another bridge, the Qan·π≠arat al-UshnƒÅn was destroyed by fire a century earlier and also not rebuilt at the time. Importance The Isa Canal provided full half of the water supplies of West Baghdad, with the Dujayl Canal providing the rest. Medieval authors stressed that \\"the waters of the Nahr Isa never failed, nor was its channel liable to become silted up\\". Conversely the Isa Canal occasionally exposed the suburbs of Baghdad to flooding, when the Euphrates overflowed. The main course of the canal formed the boundary of the suburb of Karkh, and thus also the southern city limit of Baghdad in the Middle Ages. The canal was also an important commercial highway, part of a network of waterways that linked Baghdad to the Caliphate's provinces and the wider world. It was deep enough to be navigable, and was consequently also the main avenue for trade coming to Baghdad from the west: the trade caravans brought their goods, including food from the provinces of Syria and Egypt, to Raqqah in Upper Mesopotamia, where they were loaded onto barges and sailed down the Euphrates and the Isa Canal to the emporia of Karkh. In later times, when dams were constructed on the Sarat branch, only the main branch of the Nahr Isa remained open for traffic.

In the book, Korg examines the role that linguistic experiment played in literary modernism. Overview Korg's discussion of the role of linguistic experiment is focused on examinations of the work of T. S. Eliot, Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, T. E. Hulme, E. E. Cummings, William Carlos Williams, and James Joyce. His study moves from a discussion of the motives of experimentation in language, to discussion of realism, and on to questions of form and language, abstraction and language, and the use of imagery, parody, borrowing and quotation, and typographical experiments in literature. The book closes with a chapter on Joyce's Finnegans Wake. Reception Language in Modern Literature was reviewed widely and received mixed assessments in various academic journals. While most acknowledged that Korg's book was useful, certain reviewers found his analysis too repetitive and simplistic. Victor Sage, writing in the Journal of Beckett Studies, pointed out that Korg limited his argument to a few writers and critics throughout the book, and this gave the text a repetitive quality. Sage complained about \\"the deliberate limitation and re-use of material, and went on to note that \\"a curious, nagging expectation, not to be removed by the most skilful writing, arises in the reader's mind at about the half-way stage, that the same names are going to crop up again and again in new permutations, for Professor Korg has tended to compound his method by using his critics over and over again in a similar fashion to his authors. The book cannot help but be repetitive; and once the major protagonists have been introduced and the paradox expounded, the later chapters ('Form and Language' and Imagery and Other Resources' in particular) are noticeably less satisfactory.\\" Richard Boyd Hauck praised the book in Modern Fiction Studies: \\"Korg has organized his book according to various experimental principles: ideas about the techniques for representing reality, problems of the mind, language forms, abstractions, and imagery. Concluding with an essay on Finnegans Wake, he gives us a modernist credo which pulls his book together. Joyce's comic vision mingles 'intelligent perception and humane laughter' to achieve 'vital new relationships' in a world 'where the old ones have gone dead.' Language remains 'as open to renewal as the imagination itself'.\\" Patricia Ingham, reviewing the book in The Review of English Studies, New Series, found Korg's linguistic analysis was \\"nebulous\\" but nonetheless she found value in the book: \\"He makes a comparison between the use of collage by Braque and Picasso and literary use in the work of William Carlos Williams. He compares abstract painting with the literary attack on meaning. What emerges from the latter account is the impossibility of ever defeating such a guerilla. If the 'revolution' throws up a hero it is surely meaning. Dr. Korg plots his repeated emergence with great perception and skill. These are qualities shown throughout the detailed analysis of individual writers, especially in the section on Joyce, and they offset the nebulousness of the linguistic generalizing.\\" Roger Fowler in The Journal of English and Germanic Philology found the book's value to be extremely limited. \\"Although I grant the usefulness of the book at an elementary level, I am bound to question its value at a higher scholarly level. As literary history it is superficial and derivative (the indebtedness to other critics is honestly acknowledged in the text and footnotes). What is more damaging, though, is the weakness of the theoretical and methodological framework for analyzing language.\\" Fowler concluded:\\"This is an agreeable book, interesting, useful as a general introduction to modernist writing, well-written itself; but unexciting and limited as a contribution to the advancement of knowledge.\\" Philip Hobsbaum in The Modern Language Review found the writers Korg chose as his subject matter to be too heterogeneous to be encompassed by the same analysis: \\"Language in Modern Literature believes modernism to be a definite entity whose elements are offered as enigmas, in which reason gives place to metaphor, where fragmented syntax imitates the chaotic contemporary world. Professor Korg lays astonishing emphasis on Cummings, Stein, Wyndham Lewis, Hulme: yesterday's men of tomorrow. They are now surely of interest only to the cultural sociologist. Korg's other figures, Joyce, Eliot, Pound, and Williams seem diminished in their company: the same rationale cannot do for all.\\" See also * Literary modernism * Experimental literature References Sources  * Category:Books about Ezra Pound Category:Books about Gertrude Stein Category:1979 non-fiction books Category:Books about literature Category:Books of literary criticism ","title":"Language in Modern Literature"},{"id":"61158714","text":"C.E.

The Road connects the city of Ndola (Capital of the Copperbelt) with the city of Mufulira. The route extends to connect Mufulira with the city of Kitwe. As it is a v-shaped route, the M4 Road starts and ends at a junction with the T3 Road. It is the only route that connects the south-western terminus of the Congo Pedicle road coming from Luapula Province (& the town of Mufulira) with the rest of the Copperbelt Province and with roads connecting to neighbouring provinces like the North-Western Province. Route The M4 begins at a roundabout by Levy Mwanawasa Stadium in the city of Ndola. It begins at a junction with the T3 Road (Ndola-Kitwe Dual Carriageway). The M4 begins by going 60 kilometres north-west to the town of Mufulira. 18 kilometres north of Ndola, at Kamalasha, the M4 meets a road which goes eastwards and crosses the near border with DR Congo, with the town of Sakania on the other side of the border. It is one of the 2 borders which provides access to the Congo Pedicle Area of DR Congo from the Copperbelt Province of Zambia. By Mufulira Airport in the Mupambe Suburb, it becomes Chatulinga Street, entering Mufulira in a northwesterly direction. South of Fairview At the Kitwe Road junction, as Chatulinga Street becomes the M5 Road northwards and proceeds through Mufulira Central to become the Congo Pedicle road, the M4 becomes Kitwe Road by way of a left turn. From Mufulira, the M4 exits the city in a southwesterly direction and goes for 25 kilometres, crossing the Kafue River, to reach its terminus at another junction with the T3 Road (Kitwe-Chingola Dual Carriageway) in the settlement of Sabina, 15 kilometres north-west of the City Centre of Kitwe & 10 kilometres south-east of the town of Chambishi. Road Importance The Congo Pedicle road is an important road, as it provides a direct shortcut for people travelling from the Copperbelt Province and neighbouring provinces to the Luapula Province in northern Zambia. It is a road maintained by Zambia through Congolese territory. The road is from Mufulira, through the Mokambo border into the Congo Pedicle Area of DR Congo, to the Levy Mwanawasa Bridge at the Chembe border post, with the road continuing to the town of Mansa (capital of Luapula Province). The section from Mufulira Town Centre to the Congo Border is designated as the M5 Road. As the Congo Pedicle road provides a shorter route to the Luapula Province, it makes the M4 road an important road, as it is the only road that provides the rest of the Copperbelt Province with access to the town of Mufulira and the start of the Congo Pedicle road. Despite being in a poor condition, both the short western section from Kitwe to Mufulira and the long eastern section from Ndola to Mufulira are declared as important roads, as they provide access to a shorter route to Luapula Province than the longer route through the towns of Kapiri Mposhi and Serenje in Central Province. The Congo Pedicle road proceeds as the shortcut to the Luapula Province, which is a route for people who plan to save on fuel between the 2 parts of Zambia and who plan to avoid spending hours on the road. M5 Road The M5 Road is the short road that connects the M4 Road with the Mokambo Border and the Congo Pedicle road (Shortcut to Luapula Province). It begins as Chatulinga Street at the junction with the v-shaped M4 Road south of Mufulira town centre, going northwards. At the junction with West Shafts Road just west of the Mufulira Railway and Mufulira Golf Course (east of the Mopani Copper Mine), the road turns towards the north-east and goes for 15 kilometres to reach the Mokambo Border Post with DR Congo and become the Congo Pedicle road. It becomes the M3 Road at the Luapula end of the Congo Pedicle Road. The Congo Pedicle Road is designated as the N36 Route on the DR Congo road network.

He may have been the son of John Bradley of Bergen op Zoom in Brabant, then in the Dutch Republic, and Anna van der Delft. Between 1584 and 1594 he was in England, where he worked on drainage projects on the Great Ouse, the Nene and the Witham rivers, prepared an analysis of the costs of improving the harbour at Dover, and submitted a proposal for draining the whole of the Fens. His manuscript Discourse of Humphry Bradley, a Brabanter, concerning the fens in Norfolk, Huntingdon, Cambridge, Northampton, and Lincolnshire is written in Italian and is dated 3 December 1589. Also in 1589, he married Anna Sermantens of Delft; their children Joachim and Sara were baptised at the Dutch Church in Austin Friars, in the City of London. By 1596 he was in France, sent by the States-General of the Dutch Republic to assist Henri IV with land drainage for military purposes. On 1 January 1599 he was appointed , or \\"master of dykes of the Kingdom\\", which essentially gave him a monopoly of all dyking and land reclamation work throughout the country. Early in the seventeenth century he contracted to drain parts of the Marais de Saintonge, but was not able to carry the work forward until after 1607, when the was formed by royal edict. Workers were brought from the Low Countries, and by about 1610 the area between Muron and Tonnay-Charente had come to be known as the Marais de la Petite-Flandre, the \\"marsh of little Flanders\\". Bradley enjoyed the support of Maximilien de B√©thune, Duke of Sully, the chief minister of Henri IV, and carried out substantial land reclamation work in Auvergne ‚Äì the Marais de Sarli√®ve in the Limagne ‚Äì and in the Languedoc. A proposal for a canal from Dijon to Joigny, which would have connected the Sa√¥ne to the Seine, and thus linked Marseille to Rouen, was not accepted. The last documented mention of Bradley is from 1625; he is thought to have died before 1639.

The plot revolves around Maria (Cristine Reyes), a former hired assassin who now lives a happy home life. But things are about to change when she is spotted by someone from her past. The film was produced by Viva Films in partnership with streaming site Netflix. It was released in theaters nationwide on March 27, 2019.  Premise  Maria (Cristine Reyes) is a former hired assassin who now lives a happy home life. But things turn for the worse when her former boyfriend and partner-in-crime, Kaleb (Ivan Padilla), finds her and tries to turn her over to her former self again.  Plot  The movie starts off with Maria going ham infiltrating a mansion and killing everyone inside. The very end of that shows a mother and her child crying and blacks out to the sound of a gunshot. Fast forward to the present, Maria wakes up next to her Husband Bert, gives him a kiss, gets dressed and goes to check on her daughter, Min-Min. She then makes breakfast for her family and her husband comes in saying he‚Äôs going to skip breakfast to go to a meeting with Governor Villanueva. She tells him that all politicians are the same and that he should be having breakfast instead. Min-Min comes into the kitchen and answers her mother that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Ricardo de la Vega is sitting in his office watching a press conference of Governor Villanueva. A reporter asks him about his anti-drug campaign and his partner Ricardo to which he says Ricardo has never been my partner and one he‚Äôs elected they‚Äôll get justice. Ricardo yells at the tv that he put him in that position and one of his men comes in saying he has a present for him. He gets into the warehouse where there are two men strung up and bloody. He makes a speech about loyalty and introduces Kaleb and Victor and then calls out the real traitor ‚Äì the man who said he had a present for him. He beats him with a bat then has two of his female agents shoot the men who were strung up. He tells Kaleb and Victor that Governor Villanueva is making too much noise and that he needs to be taken care of. He orders Kaleb to take care of it, which upsets Victor. He asks Ricardo why he allows Kaleb to mess things up and Ricardo responds: I call the shots. Maria goes to pick Min-Min up from school and calls Bert and asks him to come home early to eat with them. They have dinner together and they joke that dinner is very good. After dinner Bert and Maria are watching Governor Villanueva on TV with Min- Min sleeping in their lap. Bert tells her that he thinks the governor is really a good guy and Maria responds sarcastically that of course he is. When he gets upset, she tells him she‚Äôs just kidding, and they hold hands. At the rally for Villanueva, one of Ricardo‚Äôs men is reporting about the situation of the security being tight. Meanwhile Bert is standing outside with a Governor Villanueva T-shirt handing out flyers and shaking hands. Maria goes to get Min-Min from talking to a police officer and the man takes a picture of her. He sends the pictures to Kaleb and he immediately recognizes Maria and heads over to the rally to find her, but she has already left. Back at home, Bert is watching the governor on the tv again and Maria turns it off. They get into an argument about him paying more attention to the governor than to his own family. At the docks, Victor and his men are torturing a man to get information. He calls Kaleb to ask how it‚Äôs going and tells him he‚Äôs going to send men over, but Kaleb tells him no and hangs up on him. Ricardo walks in and asks if the man has said anything. Victor shoots the man in the head and tells him no. Kaleb practices sparring with his trainer and has a flashback with his girlfriend Miru where she tells him that she doesn‚Äôt want to kill anymore. He tells her that they have one more mission and that afterwards he would talk to Ricardo. In the present Kaleb subdues his trainer, knocking him out and tells his bodyguards to clean up the mess. The next morning Maria is having breakfast with her family and Bert tells her that he wasn‚Äôt going to go to see the governor that day, and Maria responds that she would cook them a good dinner because he wasn‚Äôt able to see the governor the day before. Kaleb calls Victor‚Äôs men together and tells Miru to take care of the governor while he takes care of something else. He tells the men that he sent them a picture of Maria‚Äôs family and that he wants them to find them and bring them to him. Directly after, Kaleb's men go and kidnap Leo and torture him into telling him where Maria lives. Some of Kaleb‚Äôs men see Maria in a market place and recognize her. They start to follow her then she starts to run. They chase her and she defends herself, picking them off quickly, and then hurries home. She runs inside and tells her husband Bert and Min-Min to pack, and her husband starts asking what was wrong when the doorbell rings. She tells him not to answer it but he goes and Leo is at the door. He says I‚Äôm sorry then is immediately shot by Kaleb. He walks in with a few men and one man come in from the back. She knocks out the man and shoots him, but Kaleb puts a gun to her husband‚Äôs head and tells her to put the gun down. He calls her Lilly. After a few seconds of pondering she puts the gun down. One of the men separates her and her daughter, and when she runs towards her father Kaleb shoots her in the face. Her father grabs her and starts crying and Kaleb puts a gun to his neck. The film then flashes back to the scene at the beginning of the film. Lily had refused to kill the lady and her daughter and another man was about to do it, but she shot him in the head, shot Kaleb in the knee and ran off with the girl and her mother. Back to the present she fights to get away from the men and her husband pushes away from Kaleb as well and fights him. Bert, seeing more men coming from the back entrance, shoves Kaleb away and gets shot while blocking Maria from their bullets. Maria kills all of the assassins but Kaleb who gets dragged out by a goon into a car, where it was revealed that he was wearing a bullet proof vest. He calls Ricardo who asks is it done and tells him that they have bigger problems because Lilly is alive and everyone else is dead. He then calls Miru and tells her to fall back. Maria cries with Min Min in her arms then kisses her dead husband on the forehead, grabs her knives then gets on a train. On the train she plays with a necklace that the little girl she saved gave her. She gets off the train and starts to walk towards a building with a restaurant. She goes to the back of the restaurant where the chairs are stacked and goes to a man sitting in the back booth. He starts to tell her that he is retired while he is reading a newspaper, but she puts the newspaper down and then he is shocked to see the woman he knows as Lilly. She calls him Sir Greg and asks for a place to stay. He tells her to go to a hotel and he doesn‚Äôt want anything to do with this. The next scene shows the aftermath of what happened at her house. There are newspersons there calling it a massacre and they said that all they know is that a father and daughter are dead. Victor is there posing as a police agent. He calls Ricardo and tells him that some of the guys can be identified as his men. He tells him to fix it or else. Sir Greg decides to help Maria and is patching up a wound on her back. He asks her isn‚Äôt she supposed to be dead. She responds Lilly is. She tells him that she‚Äôs going to kill Kaleb. He tells her nothing good will come from revenge and to get away and have another family. She tells him that Kaleb murdered her family, and he tells her she can stay with him. Back at Ricardo‚Äôs compound he has a drink with victor and talks about Lilly still being alive. He says he‚Äôs going to cancel the trip, but Victor tells him no, take it, I‚Äôll handle this. Ricardo looks worried and annoyed but keeps drinking. Kaleb meets up with his girlfriend Miru, gives her a picture of Maria and tells her to finish her off. She asks who she is, and he just responds that she was an operative like her. He tells her that she‚Äôs at Old man Greg‚Äôs place, but not to touch him because they have an agreement with him. She goes to Greg's place and walks in to see him. He lets her know they have an agreement and sends one of his men on her. A fight scene ensues where she knocks out Bogart and she goes on her way. Meanwhile, Maria has infiltrated a drug packing factory of Ricardo‚Äôs and takes out the guards and the chemists with only her knives. She sets the building on fire in order to disrupt his production and then showers off the blood. During the shower, she has a flashback of going to the park with Bert and Min-Min. After she showers Greg comes to tell her that she has caused some trouble and that she shouldn‚Äôt apologize to him but to Bogart. She reminds him to call her Maria and he responds he knows her as Lilly. She asks if anything good can happen to her anymore. He responds that they should be numb to death, but he hated being the one to have to put her down after Ricardo‚Äôs gang put a bounty on her. During a flashback it is revealed that they were about to square down gun to gun, but he gave her pills to take to give her an easy death. He took her to Kaleb to go show him her body. Back in the present he tells her that she was the reason he retired, and to never think that no good could happen to her because as long as she was breathing, she had an opportunity to find happiness. She asks him for equipment. Victor goes to Kaleb and tells him he‚Äôs taking over because the factory is in ashes. Kaleb pulls a gun on Victor and tells him, he‚Äôs going to kill him. Victor takes the gun and puts it to his forehead and tells him to pull the trigger, but he can‚Äôt do it. Kaleb screams at Victor I‚Äôm going to kill you as he walks out. Maria is sitting in the restaurant watching footage of the burning factory and Sir Greg walks in and says you‚Äôre famous. He tells her to follow him. He takes her to the back where all of his weapons are and tells her that she can take anything because no one is going to dare to come after him because of all the assassins he trained. She picks up a knife and tells him she‚Äôs also going to need a dress. Maria walks into a nightclub wearing the new dress and locks eyes with Miru. She walks into the restroom and Miru follows shortly after and two of Kaleb's men block the entrance. They argue briefly over which one of them is better then begin to fight. The fight ends with Maria bashing Miru‚Äôs head into the corner of the vanity then digging her heel into her skull, killing her. The men hear this and become concerned, rushing into the bathroom. Maria quickly disarms one of them and shoots them both. She walks out of the bathroom, encounters a few more men, easily dispatches them then heads upstairs. She sits down with the club manager on a couch and asks where Kaleb is. He gives her a phone where she can contact and him and as she walks away he says give my regards to your family. She put her knife to his throat, forced him to eat a handful of drugs, then threw all of the money inside of a duffel bag over to the people in the club. Ricardo sits down with Victor and asks him to take out Governor Villanueva. When he asks about Lilly, Ricardo says to let Kaleb take care of her. Victor starts to protest, but Ricardo slams his hand down on the desk and tells him he will never be head of this family and to work on the governor. Back at the bar, Greg asks how it went last night with Maria, and he tells her that it‚Äôs not too late for her and that he‚Äôll give her money to start over. Their talk is interrupted by a call from Kaleb telling her to meet him that night at the docks. Kaleb also calls Victor and tells him to go to the docks as well. He tells Wednesday to get everyone ready and that there are to be no survivors ‚Äì not even Kaleb. Wednesday shows up at the docks and Kaleb asks where Victor is. Maria shows up at the docks as well in tactical gear, takes out a guy to get his gun and stealthily makes her way around the docks. Wednesday hears the gunshots and tells her men to get into position to which Kaleb angrily says I make the decisions and I say stand down. Maria continues to take down his men. Wednesday challenges him and he finally lets her get into position. He asks what they‚Äôre waiting for, and her men start firing on the office with Kaleb still inside, killing some of his bodyguards. Greg appears with a sniper rifle and starts to take down Victor‚Äôs men as they pull up. Victor calls Greg and tries to tell him that he violated the deal, but Greg insists that because he didn‚Äôt touch Victor the agreement is still intact and he‚Äôs just trying to even the odds. Maria continues to approach the docks office while the remaining two of Kaleb‚Äôs bodyguards cover him from Victor‚Äôs men long enough for him to get away. Maria catches up to Kaleb, however, and the two spar while he taunts her. Maria eventually gets the upper hand and he tells her she can‚Äôt escape death; she is death. She says I know right before she slits his throat. Later on, Kaleb‚Äôs body is on a slab with Victor and Ricardo standing over him. Ricardo tells Victor to avenge his brother. Back at the bar, Greg gives Maria a bag full of cash and shares one last drink with her in silence. The movie ends with them sitting side by side locking eyes.

From 1927 until 1940, Burke taught the French-speaking women of the village how to create high-quality hooked rugs based on her own designs. Most of the rugs were commissioned by leading New York decorators on behalf of their affluent clients. Langille, Edward, 2019. The Story of Lillian Burke. Cape Breton, Nova Scotia: Bouldarderie Island Press. Burke worked with the support of Marion Hubbard Bell Fairchild, youngest daughter of Alexander Graham Bell whose wife Mabel had founded Cape Breton Home Industries to train young women in lace-making and fine needlework as a way of earning extra money. After Mabel Bell's death in 1923, Burke and Fairchild re-established the organization to market hooked rugs in an attempt to alleviate the poverty that prevailed in all of Atlantic Canada during the 1920s and 1930s. By one account, the hooked-rug trade brought tens of thousands of dollars into Ch√©ticamp each year during the Great Depression when Cape Breton lumber camps were closed, the gypsum mine was no longer operating and fish sold at ridiculously low prices. Chiasson, Anselme, 1986. History and Acadian Traditions of Ch√©ticamp (translated by Jean Doris Le Blanc). St. John's, Newfoundland: Breakwater Books Ltd. Fairchild, Marion H. Bell, \\"Cape Breton's Debt to Lilian (sic) Burke\\". Handicrafts, Nova Scotia Department of Trade and Industry, Vol. IX, Halifax, October 1952. Forbes, E.R. and Muise, D.A. (editors), 1993. The Atlantic Provinces in Confederation. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. Influenced by William Morris and his Arts and Crafts movement, Burke created hundreds of original rug designs including ones decorated with flowers, birds, animals, trellises and ribbons. The finished rugs were hooked using dyed, home-spun yarn in the soft, muted tones that Morris favoured and that became fashionable among collectors who valued handcrafted textiles over ones that were mass produced. One of Burke's most notable creations was a 648-square-foot rug based on an intricate 17th century French design. It took her three months to block out the pattern for this 1937 Ch√©ticamp Savonnerie carpet on its burlap underlay. By the mid-1930s, Burke began to face resistance from the Acadian women who were producing ever-larger hooked rugs in factory-like conditions with delayed payments based on the finished product, not the hours spent producing it. Unfounded rumours circulated that Burke was making huge profits while steep increases in U.S. customs tariffs combined with the need to pay postage made the Ch√©ticamp hooked rugs increasingly uncompetitive. To make ends meet, Burke had taken a part-time job in 1930 as an attendant at the State Mental Hospital in Brooklyn. In 1943, she was appointed to a full-time position in the Department of Occupational Therapy at the New York State Psychiatric Institute in Manhattan. Her work there as head of the music therapy program fit well with her earlier experiences as an arts and crafts therapist working with wounded soldiers in Europe and America during and after World War I.Chiasson, Anselme, 1985.

Yarmouth, Nova Scotia: Les √âditions Lescarbot. Early life and education Mary Lillian Burke was born on October 4, 1879 in Washington D.C., the eldest of five children. Her parents, Michael Burke and Mary Wasney, were from working class, immigrant families. Her three-year-old brother died in 1886 and when she was eight, her father succumbed to pulmonary tuberculosis. The following year, a sister died at age two. To support her family, Mary Burke was forced to return to the Government Printing Office where she had worked before her marriage in 1879. Mary's 10-hour days, six days a week, sewing and binding government documents, forced Lillian to act as surrogate mother to her two younger siblings. Lillian Burke attended Peabody Elementary School in Washington's Stanton Square. However, various records appear to indicate that she likely also attended St. Cecilia's Academy as a part-time student where she would have studied music as well as sewing and painting. In 1893, Burke was admitted to Eastern High School which offered new courses in physical training, home economics and fine art including drawing, painting and sculpture along with other innovations such as learning by doing, problem solving, critical thinking, entrepreneurship and social responsibility. On her graduation from high school in 1898, Burke won a scholarship allowing her to attend the two-year, teacher training program at Washington Normal School. There she would have taken courses in \\"child study\\" or psychology as well as such subjects as music, physical culture, sewing, elocution, penmanship and drawing.

The mountain is situated south of the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border, on the Cascade crest, in the Pasayten Wilderness, on land managed by Okanogan National Forest. The nearest higher peak is Jack Mountain, to the south-southwest. Castle Peak is the second highest summit of the Hozameen Range following Jack Mountain. Castle Peak is the fifth-most prominent mountain in the Pasaten Wilderness. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains east into Castle Creek, a tributary of the Similkameen River, or west into tributaries of the Skagit River. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, granite spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences higher precipitation than the east side, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W.

She works on policies that improve the quality of diets, both nationally and internationally. She studies various forms of ill-health relating from diet, including obesity and malnutrition. She Is Vice Chair of the London Child Obesity Taskforce and a member of the London Food Board.  Early life and education  Hawkes studied geography at the University of Bristol. She moved to King's College London as a postgraduate researcher, and earned her PhD in 1998. Her PhD focussed on ecology and food systems.  Research and career  After her PhD Hawkes moved to Los Angeles, where she discovered farmers' markets. She returned to the United Kingdom and volunteered for the organisation Sustain: the alliance for better food and farming. She began to research food poverty and became interested in a career in food policy. She also worked in New York City. Hawkes was appointed chair of the World Health Organisation expert group on the marketing of food and non-alcoholic drinks to children. In 2009 Hawkes joined the International Food Policy Research Institute. She moved to the University of S√£o Paulo where she served as a Fellow in the School of Public Health. In 2012 Hawkes moved to the World Cancer Research Fund International, where she served as Head of Policy and Public Affairs. She established the NOURISHING policy framework of policies that promotes and tracks healthy diets. As Hawkes starts from the perspective of the eater, she connects the challenges of agriculture, healthy eating and food security. She published the annual Global Nutrition Report, identifying places for progress. The report includes global targets for nutrition as defined by the Sustainable Development Goals. In the 2015 report, Hawkes made a number of findings, including that he increased number of refugee children results in more stunted growth. She found that the majority of countries are not on target for reducing anemia and obesity. She identified that only 15% of children in developing countries were receiving adequate nutrition. In 2016 Hawkes was made Chair of the World Economic Forum Global Future Council on Agriculture. She joined the Centre for Food Policy at City, University of London. Here she looks to make a more sustainable and equal global food system. She led the report Food Systems and Diets: Facing the Challenges of the 21st Century. She was one of several signatories who requested a sugary drink tax in South Africa. She was appointed to the City Hall Food Board in 2017. In 2018 the Mayor of London appointed Hawkes as the Vice Chair of the London Child Obesity Taskforce. She has written a series of essays on the evidence that must be required to prevent obesity, and is a member of The Lancet commission on obesity. She has argued that the people of a food system should be involved in the creation of new policies, and that extra value needs to be placed on their lived experiences. Hakwes created a report on food policy for the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, defining the sweetspot of food systems at the intersection of the environment, economy and health. The systems approach recognises that food production is a complex process, which requires cross-government collaboration. Hawkes is an advisor for the Leverhulme Trust Centre for Integrative Research on Agriculture and Health and a member of the EAT Forum. She developed their Department for International Development map of agriculture-nutrition research. She has written for The Conversation.

Tom Malloy stars alongside Nicole Fox, Quinton Aaron, Chris Ashworth, Gabriel Jarret, and David Josh Lawrence, with appearance by Catherine Mary Stewart. The film was shot in Rochester, NY and directed by John David Vincent. Plot In the film, Dylan Berrick is the overnight manager of the Century Grand Hotel, a high class establishment. On the outside, Dylan seems to be a consummately professional hotel manager. But in reality, he is dealing with heroin addiction. One night, a woman, Holly, is nearly beaten to death in the hotel by her boyfriend, and Dylan finds himself acting as Holly‚Äôs savior. This includes not only helping her physically, but also rescuing her from the drug underworld that he is too familiar with. This leads them both on a journey that will help save her as well as his own job, sanity and life.

The progression from blue (cooler) to red (warmer) stripes portrays the long-term increase of average global temperature from 1850 (left side of graphic) to 2018 (right side of graphic). Warming stripes (sometimes referred to as climate stripes, climate timelines or stripe graphics) are data visualization graphics that use a series of coloured stripes chronologically ordered to visually portray long-term temperature trends. Warming stripes reflect a \\"minimalist\\" style, conceived to use colour alone to avoid technical distractions and intuitively convey global warming trends to non-scientists. The initial concept of visualizing historical temperature data has been extended to involve animation, to visualize sea level rise and predictive climate data, and to visually juxtapose temperature trends with other data such as atmospheric concentration, global glacier retreat and precipitation. Background, publication and content In May 2016, to make visualizing climate change easier for the general public, University of Reading climate scientist Ed Hawkins created an animated spiral graphic of global temperature change as a function of time, a representation said to have gone viral. Jason Samenow wrote in The Washington Post that the spiral graph was \\"the most compelling global warming visualization ever made\\", before it was featured in the opening ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics. Then, on 22 May 2018, Hawkins published graphics constituting a chronologically ordered series of coloured vertical stripes that he called warming stripes. Hawkins, a lead author for the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, received the Royal Society's 2018 Kavli Medal, in part \\"for actively communicating climate science and its various implications with broad audiences\\". As described in a BBC article, in the month the big meteorological agencies release their annual climate assessments, Hawkins experimented with different ways of rendering the global data and \\"chanced upon the coloured stripes idea\\". When he tried out a banner at the Hay Festival, according to the article, Hawkins \\"knew he'd struck a chord\\". The National Centre for Atmospheric Science (U.K.), with which Hawkins is affiliated, states that the stripes \\"paint a picture of our changing climate in a compelling way. Hawkins swapped out numerical data points for colours which we intuitively react to\\". Others have called Hawkins' warming stripes \\"climate stripes\\" or \\"climate timelines\\". Warming stripe graphics are reminiscent of colour field painting, a style prominent in the mid 20th century, which strips out all distractions and uses only colour to convey meaning. Colour field pioneer artist Barnett Newman said he was \\"creating images whose reality is self-evident\\", an ethos that Hawkins is said to have applied to the problem of climate change. On 17 June 2019, Hawkins published for public use, a large set of warming stripes on ShowYourStripes.info. Individualized warming stripe graphics were published for the globe, for most countries, as well as for certain smaller regions such as states in the US or parts of the UK, since different parts of the world are warming more quickly than others. =Data sources and data visualization= Warming stripe graphics are defined with various parameters, including: * source of dataset (meteorological organization) * measurement location (global, country, state, etc.) * time period (year range, for horizontal \\"axis\\") * temperature range (range of anomaly (deviation) about a reference or baseline temperature) * colour scale (assignment of colours to represent respective ranges of temperature anomaly), and * colour choice (shades of blue and red), as well as * temperature boundaries (temperature above which a stripe is red and below which is blue, determined by an average annual temperature over a \\"reference period\\" or \\"baseline\\" of usually 30 years). Hawkins' original graphics use the eight most saturated blues and reds from the ColorBrewer 9-class single hue palettes, which optimize colour palettes for maps and are noted for their colourblind-friendliness. Hawkins said the specific colour choice was an aesthetic decision (\\"I think they look just right\\"), also selecting baseline periods to ensure equally dark shades of blue and red for aesthetic balance. ShowYourStripes.info cites dataset sources Berkeley Earth, NOAA, UK Met Office, MeteoSwiss, DWD (Germany), specifically explaining that the data for most countries comes from the Berkeley Earth temperature dataset (updated to the end of 2018), except that for the US, UK, Switzerland & Germany the data comes from respective national meteorological agencies. For each country-level #ShowYourStripes graphic (Hawkins, June 2019), the average temperature in the 1971-2000 reference period is set as the boundary between blue (cooler) and red (warmer) colours, the colour scale varying +/- 2.6 standard deviations of the annual average temperatures between 1901-2000. Hawkins noted that the graphic for the Arctic \\"broke the colour scale\\" since it is warming more than twice as fast as the global average. For statistical and geographic reasons, it is expected that graphics for small areas will show more year-to-year variation than those for large regions. Year-to-year changes reflected in graphics for localities result from weather variability, whereas global warming over centuries reflects climate change. The NOAA website warns that the graphics \\"shouldn't be used to compare the rate of change at one location to another\\", explaining that \\"the highest and lowest values on the colour scale may be different at different locations\\". Further, a certain colour in one graphic will not necessarily correspond to the same temperature in other graphics. A climate change denier generated a warming stripes graphic that misleadingly affixed Northern Hemisphere readings over one period to global readings over another period, and omitted readings for the most recent thirteen years, with some of the data being 29-year-smoothed‚Äîto give the false impression that recent warming is routine. Calling the graphic \\"imposter warming stripes\\", meteorologist Jeff Berardelli described it in January 2020 as \\"a mishmash of data riddled with gaps and inconsistencies\\" with an apparent objective to confuse the public. Applications and influence After Hawkins' first publication of warming stripe graphics in May 2018, broadcast meteorologists in multiple countries began to show stripe-decorated neckties, necklaces, pins and coffee mugs on-air, reflecting a growing acceptance of climate science among meteorologists and a willingness to communicate it to audiences. In 2019, the United States House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis used warming stripes in its committee logo, showing horizontally oriented stripes behind a silhouette of the United States Capitol, and three U.S. Senators wore warming stripe lapel pins at the 2020 State of the Union Address. On 17 June 2019, Hawkins initiated a social media campaign with hashtag #ShowYourStripes that encourages people to download their regions' graphics from ShowYourStripes.info, and to post them. Called \\"a new symbol for the climate emergency\\" by French magazine L'EDN, warming stripes have been applied to knit-it-yourself scarves, neckties, cufflinks, vehicles, and a music festival stage, as well as on the side of Freiburg, Germany, streetcars, as municipal murals in C√≥rdoba, Spain, and Anchorage, Alaska, a mural at the Cottbus, Germany train station, and on face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Remarking that \\"infiltrating popular culture is a means of triggering a change of attitude that will lead to mass action\\", Hawkins surmised that making the graphics available for free has made them used more widely. Hawkins further said that any merchandise-related profits are donated to charity. Through a campaign led by nonprofit Climate Central using hashtag #MetsUnite, more than 100 TV meteorologists‚Äîthe scientists most laymen interact with more than any other‚Äîfeatured warming stripes and used the graphics to focus audience attention during broadcasts on summer solstices beginning in 2018 with the \\"Stripes for the Solstice\\" effort. On 24 June 2019, Hawkins tweeted that nearly a million stripe graphics had been downloaded by visitors from more than 180 countries in the course of their first week. In 2018, the German Weather Service's meteorological training journal Promet showed a warming stripes graphic on the cover of the issue titled \\"Climate Communication\\". By September 2019, the Met Office, the U.K.'s national weather service, was using both a climate spiral and a warming stripe graphic on its \\"What is climate change?\\" webpage. Concurrently, the cover of the 21‚Äì27 September 2019 issue of The Economist, dedicated to \\"The climate issue,\\" showed a warming stripe graphic, as did the cover of The Guardian on the morning of the 20 September 2019 climate strikes. The environmental initiative Scientists for Future (2019) included warming stripes in its logo. The Science Information Service (Germany) noted in December 2019 that warming stripes were a \\"frequently used motif\\" in demonstrations by the School strike for the climate and Scientists for Future, and were also on the roof of the German Maritime Museum in Bremerhaven. Also in December 2019, Voil√† Information Design said that warming stripes \\"have replaced the polar bear on a melting iceberg as the icon of the climate crisis\\". On 18 January 2020, a 20-metre- wide artistic light-show installation of warming stripes was opened at the Gendarmenmarkt in Berlin, with the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences building being illuminated in the same way. On 27 September 2019, the Fachhochschule (University of Applied Science) Potsdam announced that warming stripes graphics had won in the science category of an international competition recognising innovative and understandable visualisations of climate change, the jury stating that the graphics make an \\"impact through their innovative, minimalist design\\". =Extensions of warming stripes= In 2018, University of Reading post-doctoral research assistant Emanuele Bevacqua juxtaposed vertical-stripe graphics for concentration and for average global temperature (August), and \\"circular warming stripes\\" depicting average global temperature with concentric coloured rings (November). In March 2019, German engineer Alexander Radtke extended Hawkins' historical graphics to show predictions of future warming through the year 2200, a graphic that one commentator described as making the future \\"a lot more visceral\\". Radtke bifurcated the graphic to show diverging predictions for different degrees of human action in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. On or before 30 May 2019, U.K.-based software engineer Kevin Pluck designed animated warming stripes that portray the unfolding of the temperature increase, allowing viewers to experience the change from an earlier stable climate to recent rapid warming. By June 2019, Hawkins vertically stacked hundreds of warming stripe graphics from corresponding world locations and grouped them by continent to form a comprehensive, composite graphic, \\"Temperature Changes Around the World (1901-2018)\\". On 1 July 2019, Durham University geography research fellow Richard Selwyn Jones published a Global Glacier Change graphic, modeled after and credited as being inspired by Hawkins' #ShowYourStripes graphics, allowing global warming and global glacier retreat to be visually juxtaposed. Jones followed on 8 July 2019 with a stripe graphic portraying global sea level change using only shades of blue. Separately, NOAA displayed a graphic juxtaposing annual temperatures and precipitation. Critical response Some warned that warming stripes of individual countries or states, taken out of context, could advance the idea that global temperatures aren't rising, though research meteorologist J. Marshall Shepherd said that \\"geographic variations in the graphics offer an outstanding science communication opportunity\\". Meteorologist and #MetsUnite coordinator Jeff Berardelli said that \\"local stripe visuals help us tell a nuanced story‚Äîthe climate is not changing uniformly everywhere\\". Others say the charts should include axes or legends, though the website FAQ page explains the graphics were \\"specifically designed to be as simple as possible, and to start conversations... (to) fill a gap and enable communication with minimal scientific knowledge required to understand their meaning\\". J. Marshall Shepherd, former president of the American Meteorological Society, lauded Hawkins' approach, writing that \\"it is important not to miss the bigger picture. Science communication to the public has to be different\\" and commending Hawkins for his ‚Äúinnovative‚Äù approach and ‚Äúoutstanding science communication‚Äù effort. In The Washington Post, Matthew Cappucci wrote that the \\"simple graphics ... leave a striking visual impression\\" and are \\"an easily accessible way to convey an alarming trend\\", adding that \\"warming tendencies are plain as day\\". Greenpeace spokesman Graham Thompson remarked that the graphics are \\"like a really well-designed logo while still being an accurate representation of very important data\\". CBS News contributor Jeff Berardelli noted that the graphics \\"aren‚Äôt based on future projections or model assumptions\\" in the context of stating that \\"science is not left or right. It‚Äôs simply factual.\\" A September 2019 editorial in The Economist hypothesized that \\"to represent this span of human history (1850-2018) as a set of simple stripes may seem reductive\\"‚Äînoting those years \\"saw world wars, technological innovation, trade on an unprecedented scale and a staggering creation of wealth\\"‚Äîbut concluded that \\"those complex histories and the simplifying stripes share a common cause,\\" namely, fossil fuel combustion. Informally, warming stripes have been said to resemble \\"tie-died bar codes\\" and a \\"work of art in a gallery\\".

The show was about to start; people believed that they could enter the stadium and began to push, but the police left the doors closed. At least 16 people died and 101 others were injured.  Previous incident  The crush was the second that had happened at the same stadium in the past year, another occurring in September 2018 during a football game between Madagascar and Senegal, which killed one and injured around forty. The game was a qualifying match for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations.  Stampede  Security forces opened the gates at the Mahamasina Municipal Stadium in Antananarivo, Madagascar, on 26 June 2019 to allow spectators to enter, causing the crowd to mass outside the stadium. Police then closed the gates and blocked the crowd, which caused a pile-up. According to National Gendarmerie General Chief Richard Ravalomanana, the crowd thought that the gates had been opened and they tried to force the doors; they remained closed but the crowd kept pushing. Defense Minister General Richard Rakotonirina, however, said that it was unclear what had caused the stampede. The stampede occurred as Madagascar was celebrating the 59th anniversary of its independence. A military parade took place earlier in the stadium, and Rwandan Head of State Paul Kagame was invited as a guest of honor of President Andry Rajoelina.  Victims  At least 16 people died and 101 others were injured. The dead and injured were taken to the Joseph Ravoahangy Andrianavalona Hospital.  Aftermath and responses  President Rajoelina, his wife, and other government officials visited the injured at the hospital in the city to offer their condolences after the incident, and Rajoelina promised to pay for the hospitalization expenses.

He took over the running of the Agusta aeronautical company following the death of his father in 1927, and founded the MV Agusta motorcycle company in 1945. Biography Son of Giovanni Agusta, aeronautical entrepreneur and founder of the Agusta company, at the age of 6 he followed his father Giovanni to Northern Italy who moved to start his pioneering aviation career. The family settled near Cascina Costa. He soon became fond of motorcycles, in addition to aeroplanes. At 19, he was among the first to serve at Malpensa in the Regia Aeronautica, the new autonomous aviation armed force. In 1927 his father died from the after-effects of an operation and Domenico assumed the responsibility of the company together with his mother and younger brother Vincenzo. From 1932 to 1945 he devoted himself totally to the aeronautical industry, with the construction of various models for military aviation. In 1945, following the provisions of the peace treaty after WW2, which were later reiterated in the Paris Peace Treaties, 1947, the production of aircraft was forbidden to Italy and the company had to face a period of crisis that it tried to overcome, changing the production lines and adapting to build boats and buses. In that year Meccanica Verghera was founded, in order to mass-produce a light-weight motorcycle equipped with a 98 cc two- stroke engine, which had been designed in 1943, but development and production had been interrupted by the war. The MV Agusta models grew in popularity, and under the direct guidance of Domenico, the company developed competition motorcycles that won races and championships. Domenico would often work alongside his mechanics and engineers on the racing motorcycles. The prohibition on Italian aircraft building was lifted in 1950. Realising the future of helicopters, Domenico entered into an agreement in 1952 to build Bell helicopters under licence. Similar arrangements were made in the 1960s with Sikorsky, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. In 1958 he became a Knight of the Order of Merit for Labour. Domenico purchased the O.S.C.A. (Officine Specializzate Costruzione Automobili‚ÄîFratelli Maserati S.p.A.) company, manufacturers of racing and sports cars, from the Maserati brothers in 1963. In the 1960s he was involved in a famous scandal: having denied his daughter Giovanna permission to marry the footballer Jos√© Germano de Sales despite being pregnant, the young couple moved to Li√®ge where they married on 17 June 1967. Three years later the two divorced and Germano returned to Brazil, where he bought a farm with money from his former father-in-law. On 29 January 1971, while he was accompanying the President of Finland, Urho Kekkonen, on a visit the Agusta plant, he suffered a heart attack: he died four days later, in his Milan apartment in Piazza Sant'Erasmo. He was the brother of Mario Agusta, president of the Federazione Italiana Motonautica (Italian Powerboating Federation).Corriere dello Sport, 3 February 1971, page 4.

He was also one of Roosevelt's Rough Riders, and lost his life in Cuba during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War.Edmond S. Meany, Origin of Washington Geographic Names, University of Washington Press, 1923, pg. 310 Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences higher precipitation than the east side, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Tiffany Mountain's gentle south side Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Barbara Kegerreis Lunde (born 1937) is an American physicist and electrical engineer. She worked for NASA in the 1960s, where she developed several instruments for various projects. Lunde became the second woman to graduate from Iowa State University with a doctorate in physics and the first woman in Iowa to become a professional electrical engineer.  Biography  Lunde, the daughter of an electrical engineer, physicist and radiologist, grew up in Elmhurst, Illinois. She graduated from York Community High School in 1955. After high school, she earned a bachelor's and master's degree in physics at Northwest University in 1957 and 1959, respectively. After graduation, Lunde was hired at MIT, working on the design of guidance systems for the minuteman missile. Also while at MIT, she developed and later patented a digital accelerometer. In 1961, she started working as an engineer at the Goddard Space Flight Center where helped develop a more simple jet propellant system for use in space. She also worked as project manager on the Reliable Earth Sensor. Early in her career, Lunde recalls that she was often the only woman at scientific conferences. Lunde moved to Ames, Iowa where she helped build a radio station and where she also started studying at Iowa State University. The radio station, KLFM, co-owned with her husband Paul, was built and maintained by Lunde. Later in 1970, she became the second woman to graduate from Iowa State with a doctorate in physics. Lunde was also the first woman to become a professional electrical engineer in Iowa. Lunde also worked as an assistant professor at Iowa State. In the 1980s, another job emerged from her work in radio, when Lunde started creating underwear to protect wearers from electromagnetic radiation. She called the company Silver Lining. Lunde started working as an aerospace technologist for the FAA in 2003 as a Training Specialist. She retired in 2013 and moved to Minneapolis. In 2015, she was honored with a Richard S.

The Act commenced on Saint Catherine's Day in 1542 and remains in effect.; short title \\"Counties of Meath and Westmeath Act 1543\\" assigned by Background Historically, the Kingdom of Meath had been one of the five provinces of Ireland, and at its peak comprised all of modern counties Meath and Westmeath, as well as most of Longford and parts of Cavan, Dublin, Kildare, Louth and Offaly. The seat of the High King of Ireland was located within the Kingdom of Meath at the Hill of Tara, while the Kings of Meath had no fixed seat until the reign of King M√°el Sechnaill mac Domnaill in 976 AD, when the fort of Dun- na-Scia near Lough Ennell became the permanent royal residence. The kingdom collapsed following the Norman Invasion of Ireland in 1169 and was granted by Henry II to the Anglo-Norman lord Hugh de Lacy in 1172, becoming the most extensive liberty in Ireland. The Lordship of Meath covered a large area of almost 6,000 km2 (c. 1.5 million acres), which became increasingly unmanageable as English power in Ireland receded throughout the 13th century. Following several informal divisions and squabbles among de Lacy‚Äôs descendants over control of the lordship, it was finally divided in 1297 and the much smaller, though still sizable, County of Meath was shired. However, English authority continued to retreat eastward towards The Pale - an area centered around Dublin where English laws and customs were still obeyed. This situation left part of County Meath within the Pale, while other areas which were once loyal to the Crown were now outside the control of the authorities in Dublin. These areas were often referred to by Anglo-Norman officials as \\"frontiers\\" or \\"marches\\". An additional anomaly related to the county was the lack of a baronial structure in much of its western areas. Baronies and Cantreds were Norman-era sub-divisions of Ireland employed for administrative, justice, taxation, and peerage purposes. Given how extensive the former lordship granted to de Lacy was, many of its western areas were never formally designated, and knowledge of these areas by officials in Dublin was poor. By the 15th century, a beleaguered fort near Mullingar, often burnt by the O'Farrells and located just 80 km (50 miles) from Dublin, was the westernmost outpost that the English controlled in Ireland. Provisions Modern boundaries of Meath (Red) and Westmeath (Green). The Act noted that although Meath was \\"great and a large in ciruit, the west part therof laid about and beset with diverse of King's rebels'\\" and that in the western part of the county, the High Sheriff of Meath was not able to execute the king's laws. Furthermore, the Act stated that the sheriff most commonly hailed from those areas within the Pale (ie. modern County Meath) rather than elsewhere in the county. On the subject of the aim of partition, the Act concludes: '''' Under the partition, the six westernmost baronies of Meath became part of the new shire of Westmeath. The barony of Fore was divided in two, with the western half becoming part of Westmeath. Further west, four new baronies were established along historic Norman marcher lineages, bringing the total number of baronies in the new shire to eleven. The new baronies created as a result of the act were: *Dalton's country became the barony of Rathconrath; *Delamare's country became the barony of Rossaughe; *Tyrrell's country became the barony of Fartullagh; and *Dillon's country became the barony of Kilkenny West. Mullingar was named as the \\"head and shire town\\" of Westmeath and a Dominican priory in the area was converted into a gaol. Robert Dillon was appointed as the first High Sheriff of Westmeath in 1543. Impact The effects of the act were immediately felt within the Pale, which Meath had grown to dominate. Of England's \\"four shires\\" (Dublin, Kildare, Meath and Louth), Meath was by far the largest and wealthiest, with the eastern portion characterized by well-populated market towns, nucleated villages and a strong commercial focus on labour-intensive cereal cultivation. Under the older Lordship of Ireland, many of the judges, barristers and government officials such as Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer and Chief Justice of the Common Pleas for Ireland were born in the county. Unlike in any other shire, the towns of eastern Meath were protected on all sides - by expansive defensive marches north of Kells and west of Athboy, and surrounded on all other sides by other English-controlled shires. The partition brought Meath more into line with the other shires, certainly in terms of scale, however it remained a significant core-territory, with one English official noting that Meath was \\"as well inhabited as any shire in England\\". Although the Act was most likely a defensive measure to further fortify the boundary between the Irish kingdoms and the Pale, it laid the foundations for the westward conquest of Ireland by the Tudors, along with the expansion of the Kingdom of Ireland which had been proclaimed the previous year by the Crown of Ireland Act 1542. The incorporation of land which was inhabited by the native Irish into new English shires was repeated throughout Ireland in the late 16th century, culminating in the full conquest of the island by 1607. Current Status As of the Local Government Act 2001, Meath and Westmeath are designated as administrative counties within the Republic of Ireland, and are governed by Meath County Council and Westmeath County Council respectively. The Statute Law Revision Act 2007, enacted by the Oireachtas, repealed a large amount of pre-1922 legislation of Ireland, England, Great Britain and the United Kingdom while preserving a shorter list of statutes. The Act was the largest single Statute Law Revision Act or repealing measure ever enacted internationally. Schedule 1 of the Statute Law Revision Act retained the Counties of Meath and Westmeath Act, re-affirming the status of Meath and Westmeath as two separate entities. Although there is often (usually satirical) discussion within Ireland of Meath and Westmeath re-unifying, proposals to do so have never been seriously considered at either local authority or national level. In June 2020, a social media campaign entitled \\"Meath Reunification 2021\\" was launched, which included a submission to the Westmeath County Development Plan 2021-2027 calling on Westmeath County Council to consider reunification. On 1 July 2020 Meath West TD Peadar T√≥ib√≠n jokingly lended his support to the campaign on Twitter.

Its populations declined dramatically due to predation by the rosy wolfsnail, which was introduced to Hawaii in the 1950s to control agricultural pests. The species was listed as federally endangered in 1981. Life In 1997, all known remaining specimens of A. apexfulva were collected and bred in captivity. Most offspring died of unknown causes, but one successful offspring was born. This individual, born in a laboratory at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, was named George, after Lonesome George, a Pinta Island tortoise that was also the last of its kind. George's parents were collected from the last known wild population of A. apexfulva, in a few trees near Oahu's Poamoho trail. At the time of his birth, about 20 A. apexfulva individuals survived in captivity;Julia Jacobs (2019) \\"George the Snail, Believed to Be the Last of His Species, Dies at 14 in Hawaii\\" The New York Times. Published January 10, 2019. Accessed June 28, 2019. however, by the mid-2000s, George was the only remaining member of the species. George has been described as \\"a thumbnail- size whorl of dark brown and tan.\\" Although typically referred to using the pronoun \\"he\\", George was actually a hermaphrodite. He became sexually mature in 2012, but could not reproduce without a mate. While George was alive, it became a tradition for snail researchers to stop at the spot where the last A. apexfulva were found and scan the trees with binoculars, in the hope of finding him a mate. As of 2016, George lived in a terrarium at the University of Hawaii.Guy Dinmore (2016) \\"World‚Äôs loneliest snail lives in Hawaii but can‚Äôt get a date\\" New Scientist.

The reserve is in the center of Ukraine, along the northeast edge of the Dnieper Upland. It was created to protect valuable forest-steppe and floodplain habitat. The site is known for an abundance of archaeological sites left by cultures back to the Paleolithic. The reserve is a unit of the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, and is located in Cherkasy Oblast Topography The hills on the right bank (west side) of the Dnieper are forested and represent the majority of the reserve. The largest floodplain islands are the Serpentine Islands (116 ha) in the Kaniv Reservoir, Shelest Island (394 ha) in the Dnieper, and Kruglik Island in the Dnieper. There is a protective zone of 1,353 hectares around the reserve's borders. The reserve was originally founded in 1923 as the National Forest Steppe Reserve, and went through several changes in control before assuming its present form in 1986. Floodplain islands in the reserve Climate and ecoregion The climate of Kaniv is Humid continental climate, warm summer (K√∂ppen climate classification (Dfb)). This climate is characterized by large seasonal temperature differentials and a warm summer (at least four months averaging over , but no month averaging over . The Kaniv reserve straddles the transition zone between the Central European mixed forests and East European forest steppe ecoregions. Flora and fauna 85% of the reserve is forested, with elm and oak the most common trees. The animals are those typical of the forest steppe, including roe deer, badgers, and marten. 233 species of birds have been recorded on the site. Public use As a strict nature reserve, Kaniv's primary purpose is protection of nature and scientific study. Public access is possible at certain points of cultural interest, notable Taras Hill, the site of a monument to Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko. The reserve also hosts a Museum of Nature that is open to the public, containing 2,000 exhibits related to the paleontology, archaeology, forestry, botany, zoology, and history of the Kaniv Reserve. Two rooms in the museum house a tribute to the Ukrainian scientist Mykola Biliashivsky. Reserve staff provide guided tours for the public on three ecological tour routes through the reserve; these routes are only open in the warm months. Limited lodging is also available on site..

Prior to being re-branded and adopting a new corporate board as the Earth Exchange from 1988-1995, the museum was variously known as the Geological and Mining Museum, the Mining Museum and Chemical Laboratory. The building, collection and the site are of state heritage significance.  History  The museum operated under various names at 36-64 George Street from 1909-1995. The Earth Exchange was a museum that was re- birthed from the former Sydney Geological and Mining Museum under the auspices of the New South Wales Department of Mineral Resources. Located in the Rocks area of Sydney the building which housed the museum was originally designed by Walter Liberty Vernon, the first New South Wales government architect, as a single storey Electric Light Power Station for the redevelopment of the area in 1900. However, demand for electricity outstripped supply the Powerhouse was capable of ever delivering and the structure remained unused. In 1908, Vernon was asked to submit plans to convert the building into a mining museum and chemical laboratory. He re-submitted his original plans for a six-storey building and added an additional three storeys which was accepted by the government of the day This public museum resource continued until 1991. Coinciding with a shift to convert some public assets to private enterprises, the Sydney Geological and Mining Museum became The Earth Exchange sponsored substantially by a number of mining companies and the NSW Government through an energy fund. It was one of the first museums to include 'visitor experiences' in developing technological interactivity with audiences in Sydney, including a simulated earthquake section and showcasing underground mining exhibits. However, The Earth Exchange closed in 1995 when the State Government withdrew its annual grant for administration costs. Its collection was dispersed to other public museums most notably the Australian Museum. It subsequently was used to house a number of arts organisations.  Design of the building  The building was designed by the first government architect, Walter Liberty Vernon. Vernon's original plans incorporated six storeys but were reduced to one storey by the government. He re-submitted the original plans for the new museum in 1908 and added three additional storeys. The re- submitted designs were in keeping with the adjacent Federation style wool stores. Vernon used sandstone string work embedded into the predominantly red brick work and included gabled roofs.  Transformation to The Earth Exchange  The Geological and Mining Museum was originally established in 1886 under the auspices of the NSW Geological survey. The collection consisted primarily of fossils, rocks and minerals - many of the petrological and paleontological specimens remained with the Department of Mineral Resources the parent of the Geological Survey. The comprehensive collection accounted for some 20,777 items The museum was open to the public and functioned as an educational institution with an annual visitation of over 100,000 students from schools. Peak public visitation coincided with school holidays. Refurbishment plans for the museum began in 1984 to coincide with the Bicentennial planned for 1988. The opening of the refurbished museum was delayed until 1991 and rebranded as The Earth Exchange with a board of trustees including business and mining interests. There were a number of differences that marked the newly branded Earth Exchange from its former life as the Geological and Mining Museum. Firstly, it operated as a semi-commercial operation rather than under the auspices of a public government department. Secondly, the incorporated entity's governance structure (constituted under its own Act of Parliament) included few arts or cultural representatives on the Board of Trustees. Thirdly, the inaugural Director, a principal geologist recruited from the Department of Mineral Resources, who was responsible for the fund raising and redevelopment works, was followed by a new Director appointed directly from the museum profession to complete the project and open the Museum. The Earth Exchange, like all other museums in NSW, was dependent on government support for administration and reliant on continuing sponsorship from the mining industry. The mining industry and government committed a total of some $23 million to the development of this project. Nonetheless, it was also expected to be part of the museum sector and to offer education and curatorial services and to develop and preserve its various collections. However, tension arose between The Earth Exchange and the Australian Museum when The Earth Exchange was successful, with NSW Government support, in acquiring competitively the world-class Albert Chapman minerals collection. The new director was not only an advocate of traditional museum services but was also an advocate of the value of entertainment for visitors - a relatively new and controversial concept in museology. Like all other museums, this entity at its re-birth was to some extent caught in a tension between an adherence to museological practice which demanded scholarship, balanced exhibitions and scope for debate and specialist benefactors and sponsors who were keen to showcase the benefits of the extractive industries to Australia's economy. At the time of The Earth Exchange's entry into the museum sector, a number of other new museums entered the space. This meant that there was significant competition for visitor numbers spread among more museum attractions. The Earth Exchange's business model was predicated on high numbers of paying visitors in a culturally competitive environment. The projected visitor figures and associated income was always unlikely to be realised where entry was free at most museums. Even when subsequently museum entry fees were generally introduced, the entry fee to The Earth Exchange was double that of its competitors.  Collection and Visitor Experience  The Earth Exchange had inherited a significant collection from its former incarnation. It had also acquired the valuable and prestigious Minerals Collection, specially displayed on the fifth floor of the museum. Additionally, the Earth Exchange introduced a number of interactive and immersive displays that were intended to involve visitors in simulations of earthquakes and underground mining. These immersive attractions were costly to develop and were subject to a number of ongoing technical disruptions, disappointing visitors who may have expected more from their entry fee. This became particularly problematic when a survey (1992) of visitors indicated that 73% of respondents had attended because of the entertainment elements. The building itself was difficult to navigate given its original purpose as a powerhouse. It was designed as a vertical entity not the usual horizontal design of a museum. Visitor flow was difficult, costs associated with maintenance for interactive displays increased and turnover of exhibitions was minimal. In addition, there was increasing dislocation between the Director and the Board of Trustees when temporary exhibitions on energy and environmental concerns were mounted .  Controversy about the museum's future  There were a number of controversies surrounding The Earth Exchange even at its inception. These controversies compounded over the years 1991-1995 when The Earth Exchange was finally closed. The most significant controversies revolved around a mismatch of expectation among a number of stakeholders. The Board of Trustees were expecting The Earth Exchange to be a showcase of the value of the extractive industries; the Director of the museum was professionally aligned with concepts of museology which promoted education, debate and scholarship. The Director was also an advocate of the value of entertainment as a way of attracting visitor numbers, which was critical given the museum's reliance on private resource provision. At the same time, Sydney was developing a number of visitor attractions where such entertainment and education could be consumed reliably and relatively cheaply compared to The Earth Exchange (The Story of Sydney, Museum of Contemporary Arts, Australian National Maritime Museum, Hyde Park Barracks, and Darling Harbour attractions). The Earth Exchange, a creature of the Department of Minerals and Energy, lay outside the museum sector supported by the Ministry for the Arts. This was an uncomfortable position for The Earth Exchange to occupy when sponsorship started to fall away and reliance on government came to the fore. The Ministry for the Arts at the time became increasingly powerful within the government of the day and believed that the acquisition of the prized Albert Chapman Minerals Collection would have been better housed in another museum. They were reluctant to come to the aid of The Earth Exchange in the final analysis given their own growing cultural portfolio. The Earth Exchange finally closed its doors in 1995. Its collection was re-distributed among other museums and the prized Albert Chapman Minerals Collection was acquired by the Australian Museum.

He served as the Commander-In- Chief of the Nepalese Army from 1879 to 1884 A.D. He was born in Kunwar family as the youngest son of Kaji Bal Narsingh Kunwar and Ganesh Kumari Thapa, daughter of Kaji Nain Singh Thapa of Thapa dynasty. Dhir Shamsher was the youngest brother of Jang Bahadur Kunwar Ranaji, who rose to premiership of Nepal after the murders of influential persons - Mathabarsingh Thapa and Gagan Singh Bhandari and the incidence of Kot Massacre. Dhir was personally involved in the massacre protecting his nearly slaughtered brother Krishna Bahadur Kunwar Rana. Dhir became military Colonel after the incident. He was in the entourage of Jung Bahadur's visit of Europe in the early 1850s. Dhir Shamsher led the Nepalese Army in the two victorious campaigns i.e. Nepalese-Tibetan War in 1855-1856 and in the Indian Mutiny of 1857. He consolidated greater power when his elder brother Commander-in-Chief Jagat Shamsher Kunwar Rana died in 1879 CE. Onwards, he became the Commander-In-Chief of the Nepalese Army and was the stronghold behind the premiership of Shri Tin Maharaja Ranodip Singh Bahadur Kunwar Rana. He protected the premiership of his brother from a coup attempt by Jagat Jung Rana, eldest son of Jang Bahadur and Crown Prince Trailokya of Nepal in 1881-82 known as \\"38 Saalko Parva\\". His presence prevented the clash of his 17 sons against the sons of Jung Bahadur. His death in 1884 paved way for the consolidation of power by his 17 sons (Shamsher Ranas) through the murder of Premier Ranodip Singh Kunwar. Early life He was born circa 1828 in the Kunwar family as the youngest son of Kaji Bal Narsingh Kunwar and Ganesh Kumari Thapa, daughter of Kaji Nain Singh Thapa and Rana Kumari Pande. His brothers from Ganesh Kumari were ‚Äì Jang Bahadur, Bam Bahadur, Badri Narsingh, Krishna Bahadur, Ranodip Singh and Jagat Shamsher. His step brothers include ‚Äì Bhakta Bir and Jaya Bahadur. He was known as \\"Sannani\\" in his family. Life =Kot Massacre and Europe visit= Jung Bahadur Kunwar, eldest brother of Dhir Jung Bahadur Kunwar and his brothers massacred around 29 nobles in the Kot Massacre and consolidated the key administrative posts. Dhir Shamsher, the youngest brother of Jang Bahadur was crucial in the Kot Massacre, when he struck Khadga Vikram, who had attempted to attack one of his brothers, Krishna Bahadur Kunwar Rana. He received the military rank of Colonel on the subsequent day of Kot Massacre. He accompanied his eldest brother Prime Minister Jang Bahadur Rana in the 1851 Europe visit. He experienced new social entertainments during the tour of England. In one of the organized wrestling matches, Dhir defeated an English wrestling Champion. In his Paris tour, he received minor injuries when he was struck by a bullet from a young girl who misfired a shot from Jang Bahadur's pistol. In the Vikram year 1910 (1853 A.D.), General Dhir Shamsher occupied the sixth position in the government among the members of the Rana family, and his yearly emoluments amounted to NPR 21,853.00. =1855-56 Tibetan War= Government of Nepal declared war on Tibet on the grounds of mistreatment of Nepalese Newari traders and Nepalese representative (Nayak) in Lhasa, and Nepalese mission to Peking. The Kuti front was led by General Dhir Shamsher with 4678 troops under his control. On 3 April 1855, General Dhir Shamsher defeated a small Tibetan forces at Chusan and captured the Kuti front and further advanced to Suna Gompa. His victory at Kuti front was described by Jung Bahadur as: He built a logistics base in Duguna village near Listi in Nepal at the border. He led an attack on the fortress of Sona Gompa which had 8000 troops. The battle was fought with great difficulty on both sides and eventually, Tibetans retreated. On 5 November 1855, the Tibetan forces under General Kalon Shatra launched two simultaneous attacks in on the Nepalese camps at Kuti and Dzongka. The Nepalese forces faced heavily damage in Kuti by the surprise assault and the forces retreated to the border. In December 1855, Dhir Shamsher recaptured Kuti with the reinforcements sent by Jung Bahadur through a multi-directional assault on the Tibetan forces. He burned the town of Kuti before returning to Listi in Nepal. Later, Dhir Shamsher estimated to British Resident C.E.R. Girdlestone that a campaign in Tibet would cost NRs. 60 lakhs more than Nepal could hope to receive compensation and indemnification from Lhasa. =Indian Mutiny= Dhir Shamsher was ordered Jang Bahadur to command 3000 Nepalese troops to Lucknow, Benaras and Patna in order to suppress Indian Mutiny of 1857. The Gorkhali forces restored the British authority in Lucknow and Gorakhpur and also succeeded in Bihar, Azampur, Jaunpur, Allahabad and Oudh. However, Dhir Shamsher had anti-British policy and he opposed Jang Bahadur's move to support British in the Indian Mutiny. =Middle Years= According to the roll of succession of Ranas framed by Jang Bahadur on 10 Sudi Magh, 1924 V.S. (3 February 1868), Dhir was fourth in the position to the Prime Minister and was Commanding-General of the Eastern Command of Nepal Army. In 1871, Commanding-General Dhir Shamsher received wastelands in the Eastern hill region between Dudhkoshi river and Mechi River for the cultivation of tea. =Trials in Dharmakachari= Dharmakachari, the anti-corruption court, held Ranoddip Singh and Jagat Shamsher guilty of taking bribes. But no charge was proved against Dhir Shamsher. = Family feuds and coup attempts= Jagat Jang, eldest son of Jang Bahadur, a nephew of Dhir Shamsher Jang Bahadur died on Falgun 1933 V.S. (March 1877) at Rautahat. Dhir Shamsher circulated a rumour that Jang Bahadur was critically ill, upon which the Crown Prince Trailokya of Nepal and Jang Bahadur's sons rushed to Patharghatta. Dhir attended the funeral of Jang Bahadur with the Crown Prince Trailokya with whom he had quarreled throughout the way. On their absence in Kathmandu, he immediately imposed King Surendra of Nepal to declare Ranodip Singh Kunwar as Prime Minister of Nepal. Through this move, he destroyed the plot of Jang Bahadur's eldest son Jagat Jang and Crown Prince Trailokya's motive to force King Surendra to abdicate the throne and appoint Jagat Jang as the Prime Minister. When Prince Trailokya came back to Kathmandu after the funeral, he attempted to overthrow Dhir Shamsher from political scenario with the assistance of Jagat Jang Rana, the son of deceased Jang Bahadur. When Commander-in-Chief Jagat Shamsher Kunwar Rana died in 1879, Dhir Shamsher succeeded him in the position. Dhir Shamsher did not want to transfer his current position of Senior Commanding-General of Western Commanding forces to Jagat Jang because the forces under Western Command were huge. This event further incensed the relationship of Dhir Shamsher with his nephew Jagat Jang. Shrivikram Singh Thapa, Sangramasur Bisht and a faction of Bharadars attempted twice in the year 1938 Vikram Samvat (1881-1882 CE) to destroy both Ranodip Singh Kunwar (Prime Minister of Nepal) and Commander-In-Chief Dhir Shamsher Rana. Both attempts were aborted, and for the third attempt, the date of execution was fixed on last day of Poush (December 14, 1881). In December 1881, Prime Minister Ranodip Singh went on a hunting trip to Terai. The conspirating faction sought the assistance of Lieutenant Uttardhwaj who had ancestral rivalry with the Shrivikram Singh, a member of the conspirator group. Due to the rivalry, Lt. Uttardhwaj revealed the plot to Dhir Shamsher who was in Kathmandu. Dhir Shamsher immediately informed his brother Prime Minister Ranodip Singh Kunwar in Terai camp to arrest the conspirators in his entourage. Also, Dhir Shamsher arrested conspirators in Kathmandu on Magh Badi 2, 1938 Vikram Samvat with the help of Bam Bikram, a member of the conspiracy group. On the same night, the conspirators in the camp of Ranodip Singh were arrested and brought to Kathmandu. On Magh Badi 4, 1938 V.S. (January 1882), one of the conspirators, Subedar Simha Jang Pande took committed suicide by poison on the banks of Bagmati river at Teku while Sangramsur Bisht and Amrit Simha Adhikari revealed the conspiracy where Crown Prince Trailokya and Prince Narendra were involved. Jagat Jung and Bambir Bikram were removed out of role of succession of Ranas. Former Prime Minister Mathabarsingh Thapa's two sons ‚Äì Colonel Bikram Singh Thapa and Colonel Amar Singh Thapa were also convicted aloongwith Colonel Indra Singh Shripali Tandon, Dhir Man Singh Basnyat and Kulman Singh Basnyat. A lot of nobles and courtiers were beheaded, imprisoned and degraded from their caste after the Prime Minister Ranodip Singh returned on Magh Badi 11, 1938. = Administration= Prime Minister Ranodip Singh Kunwar; elder brother of Dhir Shamsher Historians John Whelpton, Ishwari Prasad contended that Dhir Shamsher was the main support to the administration of Prime Minister Ranodip Singh Kunwar. Historian Perceval Landon described him as Chief Executive of Nepal when he was appointed as Commander-in-Chief. Until his death in 1884, Dhir Shamsher controlled the real authority as Ranodip Singh had an ill health and was a fragile ruler. Ranodip Singh did not act anything contrary to Dhir Shamsher and always contended him. Similarly, Dhir did not allow the British authorities to receive any Gorkhali recruits from Nepal while Ranodip Singh favoured it. His death allowed Ranodip Singh to permit Gorkhali recruitment in British Army. As a Commanding General, Dhir Shamsher directed Subba Jayashankar Pande with the reduction of land taxes in Dang on Baisakh Badi 2, 1936 (Vikrama). On Ashadh Badi 10, 1938 (Vikrama), he also redirected Subba Pande to collect land taxes of the occupied wastelands in the region. He also reinstated the mail services at Chitwan executed from the orders of Kartik Badi 9, 1939 Vikrama (October 1882). Allowances As a Commander-in-Chief, Dhir Shumsher received an annual allowance of NRs 16,000. Family & Personal Life He had five wives. He married a sister of Lalit Man Singh Basnet, Nanda Kumari Thapa (sister of Keshar Singh Thapa) and Juhar Kumari Devi of a noble Rajput family of Kangra. =Sons= Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana, eldest son of Dhir Shamsher; later Maharaja of Kaski and Lamjung and Prime Minister of Nepal He had 17 sons and 17 daughters. The seventeen sons of Dhir Shamsher were known as Shamsher faction, Satra Bhai ('seventeen brothers'), or the Shamsher Rana dynasty. They began to append the name and title of Jang Bahadur Rana to their own name. They became influential with five of them being Commander-in-chief of the Nepalese Army Prime Minister of Nepal and Maharaja of Kaski and Lamjung in continuous succession between 1885 and 1945. Similarly, only two grandsons of Dhir Shamsher became the Maharaja of Kaski and Lamjung. Many historians contend that the Shumsher Ranas were responsible for the dark period in the history of Nepal. Among the seventeen sons, only nine were high caste Ranas (A or B) while remaining eight were C Class Ranas who were born out of mistresses and ritually low caste women. The list of seventeen sons of Dhir Shamsher are: # Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana (by sister of Lalit Man Singh Basnet) (Prime Minister of Nepal) # Khadga Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana (by Nanda Kumari Thapa) (Commander-in-chief of the Nepalese Army) # Rana Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana (Commander-in-chief of the Nepalese Army) # Dev Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana (by Nanda Kumari Thapa) (Prime Minister of Nepal) # Chandra Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana (by Nanda Kumari Thapa) (Prime Minister of Nepal) # Bhim Shamsher Jung Bahadur Rana (by Nanda Kumari Thapa) (Prime Minister of Nepal) # Fatte Shamsher Jung Bahadur Rana # Lalit Shamsher Jung Bahadur Rana # Jit Shamsher Jung Bahadur Rana # Juddha Shamsher Jung Bahadur Rana (by Juhar Kumari Devi, a Rajput wife from Kangra) (Prime Minister of Nepal) # Dambar Shamsher Jung Bahadur Rana # Jadu Shamsher Jung Bahadur Rana # Purna Shamsher Jung Bahadur Rana # Durga Shamsher Jung Bahadur Rana # Shere Shamsher Jung Bahadur Rana # Khamba Shamsher Jung Bahadur Rana # Harka Shamsher Jung Bahadur Rana Among the Shamsher factions, families of Chandra Shamsher and Juddha Shamsher were mostly A Class and later they removed all B and C Class Ranas from power in March 1934. =Daughters= One of daughter of Dhir Shamsher, Princess Khadga Divyeshwari Devi was married to Chautariya Lakshmi Narayan Shah of Salyan. In Vikrama 1966, she received a house on inheritable Bakas-Birta tenure from King Prithvi Bir Bikram Shah Dev. Personality Indian Historian Ishwari Prasad opines that Dhir Shamsher \\"‚Ä¶possessed the qualities of a soldier and a statesman and was fully acquainted with the condition of Nepal.\\" Laurence Oliphant who met Jang Bahadur and Dhir Shamsher at Ceylon in their return journey from Europe wrote following about Dhir: Historian Ishwari Prasad writes about: Writer Madhvi Yashin described Dhir as \\"‚Ä¶a man of blood and iron.\\" Similarly, Writer Charles Allen also described Dhir as \\"‚Ä¶ both a hard-bitten warrior and a statesman.\\" He further contends that Dhir \\"‚Ä¶He effectively ruled Nepal in his brother‚Äôs name and through a series of succession passed to his own male line.\\" Memorials An equestrian statue of Dhir Shamsher was constructed at the middle of Tundikhel. Death and Aftermath Dhir Shamsher did not manage the roll of succession to favour his eldest son Bir Shamsher Dhir Shamsher died on 14 October 1884. His death cleared way for his sons to overpower their cousins and conduct the 1885 Shamsher coup where Prime Minister Ranodip Singh Kunwar and Jung Bahadur's eldest son Jagat Jung was killed as all faction of Ranas knew that Jagat Jung would murder and destroy Shamsher family if he succeeds the uncle Maharaja Ranodip Singh Kunwar. By the coup of 1885, Shamsher brothers established the \\"rule of seventeen brothers\\" and a new era in Nepal.

Its deposition is diachronous, beginning during the Maastrichtian in the north of its distribution, and later moving to the south, where its strata reached the Late Danian. It lies transitionally above the Jag√ºel Formation, and the top of the formation is marked by a regional unconformity due to an Eocene and Oligocene orogenic pulse. These two units belong to the Malarg√ºe Group. The marine sediments of the Jag√ºel and Roca Formations were deposited during a transgression from the Atlantic Ocean, beginning in the Maastrichtian and ending in the Danian. Lime kiln in Barda Norte Locality, General Roca, R√≠o Negro, Argentina The stratotype of the Roca Formation is located north of General Roca, R√≠o Negro (39¬∫40¬¥S, 67¬∫32¬¥W). The fossiliferous beds of the Roca Formation were discovered by G. Rohde Windhausen (1914), who was also the first author to describe these sediments. Schiller (1922) took samples of one section along the Zanj√≥n Roca, from the northern part of General Roca to Horno de Cal (lime kiln). This author proposed to name the lime kiln as the \\"classic area\\", and the westward cliffs from the lime kiln as the \\"model area\\" of these beds. The lithological composition of this type locality contains gray- yellowish and highly fossiliferous limestones, with greenish claystones and marls, and abundant gypsum at the top. The basal and middle sections are approximately thick (Weber, 1972).  Lithology  In its type locality, the Roca Formation is divided into three sections. The first section, that is, the base, is approximately . It consists of intercalated bioclastic limestones and green claystones. The calcareous materials are highly fossiliferous with textures like wackestone and packstone without an obvious orientation of the shells. The claystones are composed of montmorillonite with calcite and quartz. The second section (middle) is not over and consists mainly of limestones. Such section has very thin strata of varied yellow limestones and siltstones, interbedded with yellow porous and coarse-grained limestones. The limestones of the middle section are almost devoid of fossil invertebrates. The third section (upper) is . It is mainly composed of white gypsum in large crystals. It has lenticular intercalations of greenish siltstones with wave- formed ripples and fragments of gypsum. The faunal character on the fossils of marine invertebrates in the Roca Formation suggests a transgression from the Atlantic Ocean. By contrast, the marine invasions in Argentina and Chile during the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous were caused by an inflow of seawater from the Pacific Ocean.Aguirre-Urreta, M.B., S. Casad√≠o, M.

The event, organized by the Entertainment Software Association (ESA), was to take place at the Los Angeles Convention Center from June 9‚Äì11, 2020. However, due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic, the ESA announced it would cancel the event, marking the first time since the launch of E3 in 1995 that it was not held. In lieu of that, several publishers made plans to continue with presentations of game announcements during the planned E3 period, while others opted to use more traditional marketing throughout the year. Format and changes In the days prior to the event, major hardware and software vendors were to host press conferences at nearby venues, where they would introduce new hardware and games that would be on display at the exhibitor's hall during the actual event. Within the event period, attendees would have been able to view these products at the exhibitor's hall, often including playable game demos, attended special presentations offered by companies, and in some cases, had private meetings with companies on their products. The E3 period is often used by journalists from video game publications as well as social media influencers to provide initial comments on these new games. This also enables retailers to plan out what products to purchase for the remainder of the year, particularly for critical Christmas and holiday sales periods. E3 2020 was due to continue to offer public passes to the event, though the number offered was increased to 25,000 from 15,000 from the prior E3 event. The ESA stated that they planned to revise the format for E3 2020 to feature more interactivity for attendees as to reflect the changing audience for the show, and looking to make it a \\"fan, media and influencer festival\\". ESA stated the event would be \\"an exciting, high-energy show featuring new experiences, partners, exhibitor spaces, activations, and programming that will entertain new and veteran attendees alike\\". ESA president Stanley Pierre-Louis said they were inspired by the Keanu Reeves moment from E3 2019 as the type of event they can't plan for but thrive on, and wanted to create more opportunities for similar events in the future. Part of this would have been achieved by bringing more \\"celebrity gamers\\" to various facets of the exposition. Among ESA's creative partners had included iam8bit as creative directors. However, in early March 2020, iam8bit announced they had pulled out as creative directors for the show. Sony Interactive Entertainment, who had presented at every E3 until E3 2019, stated they would not attend E3 in 2020 for a second year in a row, as the new vision of the show did not meet their goals, and instead they will present at a number of smaller events throughout the year. Microsoft's Xbox division had affirmed they would attend the show, where it was expected that more details of the 4th generation of the Xbox consoles, including the Xbox Series X with release planned in late 2020, would be announced. Geoff Keighley, who had organized and hosted the E3 Coliseum, a live-streamed event over the course of E3 with interviews with developers and publishers, since E3 2017, said that he had decided not to participate this year nor be a part of E3, the first time in 25 years. Pierre-Louis stated that they had still planned to have digital programming like E3 Coliseum. =Cancellation due to the COVID-19 pandemic= In wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and the state of emergency declared by Los Angeles County in early March 2020, ESA stated then that they were assessing the situation but at the time were still planning on going ahead with the event. The ESA formally announced they had officially canceled the physical event on March 11, 2020, stating \\"Following increased and overwhelming concerns about the COVID-19 virus, we felt this was the best way to proceed during such an unprecedented global situation. We are very disappointed that we are unable to hold this event for our fans and supporters. But we know it's the right decision based on the information we have today.\\" In addition to providing full refunds for participants, the ESA was looking into options for virtual presentations for exhibitors to use during the planned week as an alternative event. On April 7, 2020, the ESA told PC Gamer that they had determined they would not be able to host a digital E3 event as the disruption caused by the pandemic made it difficult to assemble the event. Instead, the ESA would offer to manage individual partners' announcements via the E3 website. Alternative events =Microsoft= Microsoft announced after the cancellation of E3 2020 that it would host a digital event to cover information it had planned to provide at E3, including games and details on the fourth generation of Xbox consoles it plans to launch in 2020.

Biography Cleridou was born in Ahmedabad, British India. Her father, Dr Abraham Solomon Erulkar, was a prominent Indian Jewish medical doctor in Bombay, President of the Medical Council of India, and personal physician to Mahatma Gandhi. A supporter of Indian nationalism, Dr Erulkar was a close associate of both Gandhi and Khan Abdul Ghani Khan. Cleridou was raised in the Gujarati port city of Surat, as well as Bombay. She lived and studied in Bombay until she moved to London when she was 11 years old. Erulkar studied speech at the Royal Academy of Music and became a professional actress. Towards the end of World War II, Cleridou was hired by the BBC World Service in London, where she worked with novelist George Orwell. While working in London, she met her future husband, Cypriot Glafcos Clerides, a law student and gunner for the Royal Air Force (RAF), shortly after the end of the war. Clerides had visited BBC's headquarters to see his sister, Chrysanthe, who also worked at the broadcaster. Cleridou met him in the office while he waited to see Chrysanthe. The trio went out to the Vienna Caf√© after work, and Cleridou and Clerides began dating shortly afterwards. Cleridou once recalled that she went on her first date with Clerides because he was a \\"craggy youth who had just been released from a concentration camp\\" (Clerides had been held as a POW in Nazi Germany during World War II). After a few dates, Clerides proposed marriage to Cleridou, who initially turned him down, telling him, \\"You were a prisoner of war and have seen no women, let‚Äôs wait a little\\". However, he persisted and she eventually accepted his proposal. Clerides sent a letter to her father in India to ask his permission to marry Lila. Dr. Erulkar replied to Clerides with a short telegram, but advised that the couple wait one year to marry, according to the account in Clerides' biography. The couple complied to the request. After waiting one year, the couple married in a civil ceremony held in London in 1947. Cleridou converted to Greek Orthodox Christianity and chose \\"Irene\\" as her baptismal name. The couple had one daughter, Katherine (nicknamed Katy), born in 1949, who would serve in the House of Representatives for the Democratic Rally party. Cleridou became First Lady in 1993. Upon their elevation to President and First Lady, Archbishop Chrysostomos I of Cyprus, the head of the Church of Cyprus, suggested that Clerides and Cleridou have a church wedding, which they did in 1995 at the ages of 76 and 74 respectively. In February 1997, Clerides and Cleridou undertook an official, six-day state visit to her native India, including Mumbai. During her tour, Cleridou explained that India's independence movement helped her understand Cyprus' move towards independence from the United Kingdom. She also spoke of her admiration for India, saying, \\"I love India. I love the people. I love its history. I was brought up as an Indian and I have to admit that my pride in India is noticed by everybody. I have not changed in that in one iota.\\" Cleridou suffered from deteriorating health during her later years. She was hospitalized for several weeks during the summer of 2007, but was discharged about one week before her death. Cleridou died at her family home in Meneou, just outside Larnaca, on June 6, 2007, at the age of 86. She was survived by her husband, who died in 2013, and daughter, Katherine. She was buried in a family plot in a cemetery in Nicosia.

It combines alternative country, gospel, and blues with lyrical themes touching on subject matter frequenting gothic, and particularly southern gothic, literature. Songs often examine poverty, criminal behavior, religious imagery, death, ghosts, family, lost love, alcohol, murder, the devil and betrayal. History The Denver Post in a 2016 article identified an active music scene finding its beginnings in the early 2000s, and being rooted in country but being composed of more macabre and grim subject matter. The article described Denver as the epicenter and place where this genre found its beginning, with Slim Cessna's Auto Club, 16 Horsepower, and Tarantella forming the genre's basis. Since its rise to prominence locally in the Denver music scene, the genre has spread beyond and bands from outside of the scene such as Uncle Sinner, Sons of Perdition, Murder By Death, and O'Death have borrowed from it.

While involved in convoy escort duty off the Shetland Islands on 21 October 1917, the vessel was accidentally struck by in bad weather and sank. There were no survivors. Design Marmion was one of sixteen destroyers ordered by the British Admiralty in September 1914 as part of the First War Construction Programme. The M-class was an improved version of the earlier Laforey class destroyers, required to reach the higher speed of in order to counter rumoured German fast destroyers. The destroyer was long overall, with a beam of and a draught of . displacement was normal and full load.

Armament consisted of three Mk IV QF guns on the ship's centreline, with one on the forecastle, one aft on a raised platform and one between the funnels. A single 2-pounder (40 mm) pom-pom anti-aircraft gun was carried, while torpedo armament consisted of two twin mounts for torpedoes. The ship had a complement of 77 officers and ratings. Construction Construction by Swan Hunter & Wigham Richardson was started when the ship's hull was laid down on 28 October 1914 at Wallsend and the ship was launched on 28 May the following year. Initially allocated the pennant number H.C2, the ship became G04 in January 1917. Service Commissioned on 3 September 1915, Marmion joined the Eleventh Destroyer Flotilla of the Grand Fleet. Within a month, William Leveson-Gower, who would become uncle to the future Elizabeth II, was appointed as commander. He remained in charge of the vessel until 25 May, 1917. The vessel was initially deployed as part of the Grand Fleet. On 21 December 1916, while undertaking exercises, the flotilla leader collided with the destroyer . Marmion quickly pulled alongside the stricken destroyer to tow it to safety but when it was only away, Negro sunk beneath the waves. Five officers and forty-five ratings lost their lives. The ship then took Hoste in tow, along with fellow M-class destroyer , but that vessel too had to be abandoned once the crew had been evacuated. Marmion also undertook escort duties.

The mission encountered heavy seas that caused substantial damage, but was a success. Sinking In October 1917, Marmion was one of eight destroyers that were escorting convoys between Shetland and Norway. On 20 October, the vessel was sent to escort an outbound convoy heading for Bergen to replace which was returning for repairs. Another convoy under escort was heading from Bergen at the same time, escorted by the destroyers and . At 1:30AM on 21 October, Marmion encountered this second convoy rather than the one it was expecting to see, which was at the time some miles north. The ships were passing when Tirade collided with Marmion. The bow of the former vessel was raised by a particularly high swell and sliced Marmion in half. The ship swiftly sank with all hands.

The canyon crosses the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border, between Tijuana, Baja California, and San Diego, California, and Smuggler's Gulch is the part of the canyon on the US side of the border. It may also be called or in Spanish, but these names apply more generally to the whole canyon. Smuggling activities within Smuggler's Gulch have occurred since the 19th century, giving this part of the canyon its name. The gulch is vegetated with coastal sage scrub and is home to threatened and special concern bird species. It has a seasonal stream, and normal flow is diverted for treatment. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, agriculture occurred in the gulch, but was largely abandoned by the late 20th century. In the late 20th century, the gulch was used by illegal immigrants when crossing from Mexico into the United States, being described as a \\"prime route\\" during that period. Beginning in the 1980s, sewage flowing through the gulch entered into the Tijuana River, contributing to water contamination; since then mitigation efforts have been undertaken, but are defeated by rainfall. Since 2009, it has been partially filled and traversed by the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States barrier. Flora and fauna The flora of the gulch consists of coastal sage scrub. In the early 20th century, golden-spined cereus (Bergerocactus emoryi), listed by the California Native Plant Society as a rare plant, existed within the gulch. In 2015, a small number of singlewhorl burrobrush (Ambrosia monogyra), also listed as a rare plant by the California Native Plant Society, were documented near the mouth of the gulch. Near and in the gulch, a few threatened and special concern species have been observed. These include the coastal California gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica californica), Cooper‚Äôs Hawk (Accipter cooperii), and the northern harrier (Circus hudsonius). Over 350 avian species have been observed near and within the gulch. Geography Satellite image of Smuggler's Gulch in November 2016 The gulch is the lower part of a steep walled canyon about inland and east of the Pacific Ocean in San Diego, California, and Tijuana, Baja California. Alt URL The gulch is about wide. It is about west of the San Ysidro Port of Entry; the primary border crossing between San Diego and Tijuana, and the busiest border crossing in the world. In the mid-19th century, Smuggler's Gulch had marshland and ponds of water. A stream which originates from the gulch had drained into the Tijuana River; the watershed of the gulch, a sub-watershed of the larger Tijuana River watershed, is about and is mostly in Mexico. The stream only flows seasonally during the winter months. When the base flow is absent, sewage from Mexico would follow the path of the creek were it not diverted for treatment. An alluvial fan has formed at the northern mouth of the gulch due to colluvium deposits. A natural spring had existed within the gulch. In the early 1990s, the stream was funneled into a agricultural channel which flows into the Tijuana River. This channel is connected to the gulch via an earthen channel which ends at Monument Road. History Dating back thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans in the Americas, the Kumeyaay lived in the area in and around the gulch. Melijo, a Kumeyaay village, existed north of the gulch. In 1769, Jun√≠pero Serra described the village as a \\"gentile settlement, thickly populated\\". Some of its inhabitants took part in the 1775 attack on Mission San Diego de Alcal√°. Some time after the attack during the 18th Century, the people of the village were displaced. During the Mexican period, the gulch was part of Rancho Melijo. It was owned by Santiago Arg√ºello, who used it to raise cattle and horses. Following the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, monuments were placed along the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border; monument 256 was placed near the gulch. The canyon began to be referred to as Smuggler's Gulch as far back as the 1880s due to smuggling of livestock from Mexico into the United States. Other items smuggled through the gulch were cigars and lace undergarments. In 1889, a schoolhouse was built near the mouth of the gulch and continued to operate until 1941; prior to its closing, it had been the southwest most school in the United States. , the former schoolhouse still exists as a private residence and had moved from its original location onto private property. In the early 20th Century, prior to the American entry into World War II, about a dozen families settled within the gulch; they included the Satterlee, Welcome, Smallcomb, Brehlmeier, and Coones families, with most involved in agriculture. After World War II, mining occurred within the gulch. By the 1970s, significant croplands which had existed with the Tijuana River Valley began to be abandoned, with the exception of those near the mouths of the gulch and nearby Goat Canyon.Beginning in the 1970s, contaminated water began to flow through the gulch due to uncontrolled development that occurred as Tijuana began to grow into the gulch south of the border; farming within Smuggler's Gulch began to become unfeasible due to sewage contamination of the farmland. In the 1980s, tens of thousands of people illegally immigrating into the United States passed through the gulch and were subject to rape and robbery by criminals who targeted them; over the next decade, the gulch continued to be a common route for smuggling of illegal immigrants into the United States. National Geographic referred to the gulch as the \\"prime route\\" for illegal entry into the United States during the 1990s. At the height of its utilization for illegal entry into the United States, more than 10% of the 1.2 million apprehended illegal aliens were captured within the gulch. Due to the sewage flowing through Smuggler's Gulch, Border Field State Park was quarantined. Beginning in the latter half of the 1980s, work began to collect sewage flows within the gulch but was insufficient to capture all of it, with over continuing into the estuary every day in 1987. In the 1990s, the City of San Diego purchased land at the mouth of the gulch and utilized it as a toxic waste dump, importing contaminated soils from Sorrento Valley. By the mid-1990s, millions of gallons of sewage were flowing through the gulch, leading to additional attempts to mitigate the issue by construction of additional pumps and pipes to the then-newly constructed International Boundary Wastewater Treatment Plant; however, when it rains these pumps are insufficient to collect the polluted waters from Tijuana, which then flow into the Tijuana River and thence into the Pacific Ocean. As a result, the ocean adjacent to Imperial Beach is frequently closed to swimming because of bacterial contamination in the water. =Barrier construction= Ca√±√≥n del Matadero south of the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border, as seen from the southeast, in 2008 Construction of a border fence by the United States Border Patrol, made of corrugated landing strips, in the area of Smuggler's Gulch began in 1990, and was completed in 1993; this fence was not opposed by environmentalist, as it reduced trampling of habitat and egg consumption by illegal aliens. In 1996, the United States Congress approved construction of double fencing from the Pacific Ocean to inland along the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States Border. Due to this apprehension of illegal immigrants were significantly reduced, and shifted where illegal entry occurred to places without double fencing, including Smuggler's Gulch. In 2002, a Border Patrol agent died when her vehicle toppled down the gulch's steep slopes; this was one of four deaths that were attributed to narrow switchback roads which existed on the canyon walls. In February 2004, the California Coastal Commission halted construction of the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States barrier, asking the United States federal government to make additional environmental concessions in regards to border barrier construction; this action was criticized in The American Spectator. Beginning in 2005, environmental laws were waived, as authorized by the Real ID Act, in order for the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States barrier to be built in the gulch and in nearby Goat Canyon. These proposed actions were criticized by various people and organizations, including the Sierra Club. In 2005, 127,000 illegal aliens were apprehended in the area of Smuggler's Gulch, overcoming the existing fencing. In August 2008, barrier construction in the gulch began; work was contracted to Kiewit Corporation. Mexico‚ÄìUnited States barrier in Smuggler's Gulch, as seen from the northwest, in 2009 In July 2009, work was completed on the project in the gulch; it cost $58 million and utilized 72,000 dump truck loads to fill the gulch. The amount of dirt moved was about ; the dirt came from nearby mesas within Border Field State Park. The road, lighting, and triple barrier, topped the fill within Smuggler's Gulch. The filling of the gulch was one of the most expensive sections of the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States barrier. In 2010, irrigation was installed on the fill to encourage growth of vegetation to reduce erosion, which would assist in stabilizing the earthen fill. Beginning in October 2011, native vegetation began to be installed by United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in order to rehabilitate areas affected by the installation of the border barrier across the gulch; this has stabilized the fill, which has seen reduction of height change from per year, to per year, all but eliminating sedimentation. After the barrier was completed in the gulch the area has been described as \\"nearly impenetrable\\"; however, even with these alterations to the terrain, it has not stopped all smuggling. As recently as June 2019, a small number of people have continued to evade CBP agents within the gulch. Due to the decrease in people crossing the border in the gulch, sensitive areas in the Tijuana River Estuary are no longer trampled upon. At the base of the filled portion of the gulch, underneath the border barrier, are two culverts to allow water flow. Following the construction of the border barrier in the gulch, a water channel was created to allow water from the gulch to flow into the Tijuana River; this channel is dredged and excavated yearly to remove trash, debris, and sands, which clog the channel. These items that are removed, originating from Tijuana, are waste from various sources, including hospitals and home construction. A sediment basin was built in the gulch in 2006; when the basins are emptied about of trash and sediment are removed. Removed sediment is deposited in a former quarry located in the Tijuana River Valley. , the gulch south of Monument Road and north of the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States barrier is owned by the County of San Diego. The gulch between the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States barrier, and the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border, are federal lands.

They are a group of small, colourful, freshwater fish found in northern and eastern Australia, New Guinea, islands in Cenderawasih Bay the Raja Ampat Islands in Indonesia and in Madagascar. The largest Australian rainbowfish genus, Melanotaenia, derives from the ancient Greek melano (black) and taenia (banded). Translated, it means \\"black-banded\\", and is a reference to the often striking lateral black bands that run along the bodies of those in the genus Melanotaenia. Description Australian rainbowfish are usually less than in length, with some species measuring less than , while one species, Melanotaenia vanheurni, reaches lengths of up to . They live in a wide range of freshwater habitats, including rivers, lakes, and swamps. Although they spawn all year round, they lay a particularly large number of eggs at the start of the local rainy season. The eggs are attached to aquatic vegetation, and hatch seven to 18 days later. Rainbowfish are omnivorous, feeding on small crustaceans, insect larvae, and algae. Australian rainbowfish are popular aquarium fish along with Pseudomugil blue-eyes, which are another small, colourful fish found in a similar range and habitats. In the wild, some rainbowfish populations have been severely affected by the aggressive introduced eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), tilapia cichlids, and pollution. Duboulay's rainbowfish Melanotaenia duboulayi (also crimson-spotted rainbowfish) Classification Melanotaeniinae is divided into seven genera: * Subfamily Melanotaeniinae Gill, 1894 Rainbowfishes ** Genus Chilatherina Regan, 1914 ** Genus Glossolepis M. C. W. Weber, 1907 ** Genus Melanotaenia T.N. Gill, 1862 ** Genus Cairnsichthys G. R. Allen, 1980 ** Genus Rhadinocentrus Regan, 1914 ** Genus Iriatherina Meinken, 1974 ** Genus Pelangia G. R. Allen, 1998 As aquarium fish Australian rainbowfish usually do best with tropical community fish, such as tetras, guppies, and other rainbowfish.

The Detroit-based company was founded by Dan Gilbert, Josh Luber, Greg Schwartz, and Chris Kaufman in 2015‚Äì2016. StockX has more than 800 employees in Downtown Detroit. StockX currently has international offices in London, UK, in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, and has authentication facilities in Detroit's Corktown neighborhood, Moonachie, NJ, and Tempe, AZ. Scott Cutler and Schwartz serve as chief executive officer and chief operating officer, respectively, and Deena Bahri became the company's first chief marketing officer in 2019. For education on sneaker reselling, various websites are dedicated to providing up to date estimates of resale values of the latest sneaker releases. History and operations The startup company was founded by Dan Gilbert, Josh Luber, Greg Schwartz, and Chris Kaufman starting in 2015, and launched in February 2016. Luber had previously founded StockX's predecessor website about rare sneakers called Campless (established during 2012‚Äì2013), and Schwartz holds the chief operating officer position. After Gilbert acquired Campless from Luber, Luber relocated from Philadelphia to work from Gilbert's One Campus Martius building in Downtown Detroit. StockX opened its first international headquarters in London in October 2018. Scott Cutler was appointed chief executive officer in June 2019. The company has more than 800 employees, as of August 2019. StockX is among the fastest-growing startups in Detroit and Michigan, as of late 2018. In addition to the One Campus Martius office, StockX has an authentication facility in Detroit's Corktown neighborhood. Prior to the authentication center's relocation in June 2018, the company had a team of 15 employees authenticating thousands of pairs of shoes daily. The larger Corktown facility increased the number of authentications. StockX opened a second authentication center in Tempe, Arizona, in late 2018, followed by two more in Moonachie, New Jersey and West London. In 2019, the company opened a fifth authentication center in Eindhoven, Netherlands. StockX maintains a catalog of all fake items received. The company's first \\"StockX Day\\" event in Detroit, which invited resellers, platform users, and industry influencers to meet employees and see operations, was held in October 2017 and attended by approximately 200 people. 150 buyers and sellers were selected from 3,000‚Äì5,000 applicants to attend the second \\"StockX Day\\" in April 2018. In May 2019, the company held a third \\"StockX Day\\" event for an audience of 300, and announced the opening of its first permanent location in New York City along with several major product updates. StockX has collaborated with numerous celebrities and companies on charitable initiatives. In 2017, Eminem collaborated with the company to raffle off his Air Jordan sneakers designed in collaboration with Carhartt to raise funds for the Greater Houston Community Foundation Hurricane Harvey Relief Fund and Team Rubicon to support relief efforts in Texas and Florida following Hurricane Harvey. Nike Inc.'s debut of LeBron James' first retro sneaker via StockX marked the first time the brand bypassed retail and went directly to the secondary market. In 2018, StockX and Wu-Tang Clan collaborated on the Charity Rules Everyone Around Me (C.R.E.A.M.) campaign; proceeds from nine exclusive products benefitted the Wu-Tang Foundation to support children in underserved communities. StockX suffered a data breach in mid 2019. In September, the company and Bleacher Report reached a multiyear advertising agreement, and Deena Bahri became StockX's first chief marketing officer. In September 2020, StockX co-founder Josh Luber left the company.  Business model  StockX serves as an online marketplace, facilitating auctions between sellers and buyers, then collecting transaction and payment fees. Sellers send purchased items to StockX facilities for inspection and verification, then authenticated products are shipped to buyers. StockX features a \\"stock market-like\\" variable pricing framework and discloses price histories for specific items. StockX is most known for sneakers and streetwear, but also carries other clothing and accessories such as handbags and watches. StockX surpassed eBay in total sneaker transactions in 2017. Counterfeit items are returned to sellers, and buyers are refunded. StockX charges a 3 percent processing fee for all resellers, and a 9.5 percent transaction fee for new users, which decreases with experience. Prior to the company's expansion into Europe, StockX only advertised in the United States and accepted U.S dollars. Fifteen percent of the company's buyers were international, as of September 2018. In January 2019, StockX partnered with celebrity jeweler and influencer Ben Baller to sell 800 pairs of black and red slides directly to the public, marking the company's first \\"initial product offering\\" (\\"I.P.O.\\"). The shoes were printed with the phrase \\"Ben Baller did the chain\\", a lyric from ASAP Ferg's song \\"Plain Jane\\" (2017). =Funding= StockX has received financial backing from Gilbert, investment companies Battery Ventures and GV, as well as Scooter Braun, Jon Buscemi, Eminem, Joe Haden, Ted Leonsis, and Mark Wahlberg.

Description Eucalyptus elegans is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rough bark on the trunk and branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have some leaves arranged in opposite pairs, narrow lance-shaped, long, wide and darker green on one side. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, linear to narrow lance- shaped or curved, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of between three and seven on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a conical to rounded operculum with a small point on the top. Flowering occurs from June to December and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, cup-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves level with the rim or slightly above it. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus elegans was first described in 2005 by Anthony Bean from a specimen he collected in Bendidee National Park in 1999 and the description was published in the journal Austrobaileya.

She wove her own tapestries, and was influenced by the Nagyb√°nya art movement. She was born in Szentendre, the twin sister of sculptor B√©ni Ferenczy. They were the children of the artists K√°roly Ferenczy and Olga Fialka. The Ferenczy Museum in Szentendre was founded in order to hold artworks by the family as well as other artists.No√©mi became a socialist, and this is reflected in the political themes of some of her work. She produced watercolours and sketches which were mostly turned into designs for tapestry and carpets. In addition to developing designs for Gobelin-style tapestries, No√©mi Ferenczy taught the art to others, resulting in a trend for tapestry in Hungary during the 1950s and 1960s. She died in Budapest, aged 67, and is buried, along with her parents and her brother B√©ni, in the Kerepesi Cemetery.

Ajay's Brigadier sends Ajay Krishna and his colleague Siva Prasad to inform the news to Ajay's family by ensuring that Ajay's sister's wedding preparations are not disturbed. On the way to Kurnool in a train, they come across Samskruthi, who is to marry a below-average guy. On deciding to run away and marry a good- looking guy, she sees Ajay and falls in love with him. She tries to lure Ajay by accusing him of raping her, but he remains unbudged. In Kurnool, Ajay's mother, Bharathi, is on a hideout with her family to escape from MLA Yeddula Nagendra, a corrupt minister. When they are caught by Nagendra's men who threaten to kill them, Ajay comes to their rescue and beats up the men with a warning that he would deal with Nagendra in the same way. Nagendra's main henchman narrates this to Nagendra and tells him that he has seen Alluri Seetharama Raju in his guts. Meanwhile, Bharathi tells Ajay that Nagendra is after them as she lodged a complaint against him for killing his friend's son, which was covered up as a suicide. When Nagendra threatens her to withdraw the complaint, she stands on her ground. Consequently, she is suspended from the college on the allegation of leaking the question paper and her daughter's marriage gets called off. Ajay then goes to Nagendra's house and challenges him that he will change him as a responsible citizen by making him surrendered after fetching all the evidence. Ajay then understands that Nagendra has been involved in a scam through Ramakrishna, a government officer, and Bharathi's brother, a bank officer. Ramakrishna tried to uncover the scam with his help and another girl. At the same time, Ajay re-arranges Bharathi's daughter's marriage with the same person. Meanwhile, Ajay is declared dead and Ajay Krishna informs the family after the wedding. Performing his last rites, Ajay and Prasad head back to Kashmir, while Ajay also accepts Samskruthi's proposal in between. Despite gathering the evidence, Ajay spares Nagendra from being jailed as he might use the sympathy to come out of jail and resume his corrupt activities.

Reception  =Critical response= The editor of Times Of India Neeshita Nyayapati, rated the film 2.5/5 stars and stated \\"Mahesh Babu does a good job of playing a man who will serve the country, crack jokes and protect. Rashmika Mandanna woos, gets hyper, dances, has a catch-line, all for the male lead, but why she exists in this tale, other than to fawn over him is a mystery. Vijayashanthi gets a solid role, and the way she's set up you expect so much more from her character. Prakash Raj and Ajay in roles they can play in their sleep. His background score however works and gets the job done without overpowering the narrative. Rathnavelu's cinematography too works but is unfortunately overshadowed by subpar VFX shots. The action by Ram- Lakshman is engaging.\\" The editor of India Today Janani K, rated the film 2/5 stars and called it a \\"Mahesh Babu film is utterly disappointing.\\" She stated that \\"Screenplay is replete with disjointed stories that are forced together,\\" The review also criticized fake rape scene in the film, \\"The audacity to involve the heroine‚Äôs mother in faking a rape scene should be called out,\\" she added. First post editor Hemanth Kumar rated the film 3.25/5 stars and stated \\"Neekevvaru movie review: Mahesh Babu hits it out of the park in Anil Ravipudi's fine blend of heroism and comedy.\\" Indian express editor Manoj Kumar rated the film 3.5/5 stars and wrote \\"Mahesh Babu shines in mind bending popcorn fare.\\" The editor of Sify gave the film 3/5 and called it a \\"A commercial action-entertainer.\\" The editor of The Hindu wrote \\"Mahesh Babu's film is a partly entertaining mixed bag.\\" Behindwoods editor gave 3/5 stars and wrote \\"On the whole, the film can be watched for Mahesh Babu's outstanding performance, while Prakash Raj appears as a menacing villain role at the start, but as the film progresses his character become less threatening. Amidst all these issues, it is Mahesh Babu's performance that makes the film watchable. He dances, acts, fights, and more importantly delivers clean fun. He entertains you so much and that's probably the only redeeming factor. Among the supporting actors, Vijayashanti, Vennela Kishore, and Prakash Raj's performances stand out.\\" The editor of Hans India rated the film 3/5 stars and praises a few of the characters: \\"Mahesh Babu's impeccable performance is one of the major driving factors behind the film. The actor has carried the entire movie on his shoulders and the way he has portrayed his character is too good. Rashmika Mandanna has impressed with her performance. Vijaya Shanthi is truly an asset to this film. The actress gave her 100% for the role and has grabbed the attention of the audience.\\" Koimoi editor, Shubham Kulkarni states \\"Mahesh Babu Wins Our Heart In The Film That Is Confused About Which Story It Wants To Tell while.\\"  Box office  Sarileru Neekevvaru on the opening day collected gross, beating Mahesh Babu's previous best Maharshi gross worldwide.

Historical accounts illustrate several trends in detribalization, with the most prevalent being the role that Western colonial capitalists played in exploiting Indigenous people's labor, resources, and knowledge, the role that Christian missionaries and the colonial Christian mission system played in compelling Christian membership in place of Indigenous cultural and religious practices, instances of which were recorded in North America, South America, Africa, Asia, and Oceania, and the systemic conditioning of Indigenous peoples to internalize their own purported inferiority through direct and indirect methods.Millet 2018, p. 75.Gonzalez 2012, p. 69.Schmink and Wood 1992, p. 37-39.Rodriguez 2014, p. 18.Stanner 2011, p. 158. In the colonial worldview, \\"civilization\\" was exhibited through the development of permanent settlements, infrastructure, lines of communication, churches, and the construction of a built environment structured on altering and extracting resources from the natural environment. The stated justification to detribalize Indigenous peoples throughout the world was most frequently a \\"civilizing mission\\" ‚Äì to liberate them from, what colonizers perceived as, their inferior and \\"uncivilized\\" ways of living. Detribalization in many regions was commonly enacted by detaching Indigenous persons from their traditional territories, cultural practices, and communal identities, while subjugating them to an exploited and marginalized class position within colonial capitalist society, often as an enslaved or indentured labor force for colonial industry.Millet 2018, p. 68.Hickel 2015, p. 91-94. De-Indianization has been used in scholarship as a variant of detribalization, particularly on work in the United States and Latin American contexts, although the term detribalization is also similarly used to refer to this process of colonial transformation on subsets of the historical and contemporary Indigenous population of the Americas.Moraga 2011, p. 220. De- Indianization has been defined by anthropologist Guillermo Bonfil Batalla as a process which occurs \\"in the realm of ideology\\" or identity, and is fulfilled when \\"the pressures of the dominant society succeed in breaking the ethnic identity of the Indian community,\\" even if \\"the lifeway may continue much as before.\\"Bonfil Batalla 1996, p. 46. De-Indigenization or deindigenization have also been used as variants of detribalization in academic scholarship.Rodriguez 2014, p. 18. For example, academic Patrisia Gonzales has argued how mestizaje operated as the \\"master narrative\\" constructed by colonizers \\"to de-Indigenize peoples\\" throughout Latin America.Gonzalez 2012, p. 213. While, according to James F. Eder, initial colonial detribalization most often occurred as a result of \\"land expropriation, habitat destruction, epidemic disease, or even genocide,\\" contemporary cases may not involve such apparent or \\"readily identified external factors.\\" In a postcolonial framework, \\"less visible forces associated with political economies of modern nation-states ‚Äì market incentives, cultural pressures, new religious ideologies ‚Äì permeate the fabric and ethos of tribal societies and motivate their members to think and behave in new ways.\\"Eder 1992, p. 5-6.  Usage of term  Detribalize has been defined by Merriam-Webster as \\"to cause to lose tribal identity,\\" by Dictionary.com as \\"to cause to lose tribal allegiances and customs, chiefly through contact with another culture,\\" and by the Cambridge Dictionary as \\"to make members of a tribe (a social group of people with the same language, customs, and history, and often a recognized leader) stop following their traditional customs or social structure.\\" Detribalization incorporates the word tribal, which has been recognized as an offensive and pejorative term when used in certain contexts.Mamdani 2018, p. 7. For this reason, detribalization is sometimes used in quotations when referring to the process being described to signpost for the reader the term's potentially offensive subtext. From its early uses to modern scholarship, detribalization has almost exclusively been applied in particular geographic, and therefore racialized, contexts. As the proceeding section on regional detribalized histories demonstrates, while historical discussion and academic research on \\"detribalization\\" and \\"detribalized\\" peoples can be found in the African, Asian, Oceanic, North American, and South American contexts, especially when referring to Indigenous histories of each of these regions, to locate instances in which the term has been applied to Europeans or in the European context is exceptionally rare. One of the few instances was by contemporary scholar Ronen Zeidel in a study on Iraqi Gypsies in 2014, who stated \\"whereas the Gypsies entered a detribalized Europe with a social organization that was different, contributing to their estrangement, that was not the case in Iraq. Iraqi society has never been detribalized.\\"Parrs 2017, p. 65. = Misapplication = In the twentieth century, criticisms regarding the usage of detribalization emerged among scholars, particularly in the African context, who recognized its misapplication as a consequence of racism. South African anthropologist Meyer Fortes noted how the term was commonly used in the European sociological context as a \\"synonym for such words as 'pathological', 'disintegrated', 'demoralized', in a pejorative or deprecatory sense.\\" Isaac Schapera recognized how the term was also being misapplied by Europeans who assumed that urbanization in colonial society implied detribalization: \\"it is not correct to assume that all people who go to the Union [of South Africa] from Bechuanaland tend to become 'detribalized'.\\"Bovenkerk 1975, p. 27. H. M. Robertson states that \\"the urban native is classed as 'detribalized,' but this is not necessarily the case.\\"Robertson 2015, p. 143. Ellen Hellmann similarly described in her sociological work \\"that 'the process of detribalization has been exaggerated' among the urban African population, although 'the average European would unhesitatingly classify these Natives as detribalized'.\\" In his sociological study, William Watson concludes that while \\"under urban conditions, Africans rapidly assimilate European dress, material culture, and outward forms of behaviour, this assimilation does not necessarily imply detribalization. On the contrary, many attempts to organize African industrial workers on a common basis of economic interest have encountered great difficulties because of African tribal solidarities and inter-tribal hostilities.\\"Watson 1958, p. 4-6. In Africa's International Relations: The Diplomacy of Dependency and Change (1978), Kenyan academic Ali A Mazrui provides a nuanced discussion of the misapplication of detribalization, recognizing how \\"there was often an assumption among analysts of the African colonial scene that nationalism made its recruits from the ranks of the detribalized.\\" Since the leaders of anti-colonial movements were, in the majority of instances, \\"Westernized or semi-Westernized,\\" they were classed as \\"detribalized\\" by European colonial authorities. However, Mazrui notes that this employment of detribalization failed to differentiate between \\"tribalism as a way of life and tribalism as loyalty to an ethnic group,\\" noting that colonial analysts had only recognized instances of a \\"weakening of cultural affiliation, though not necessarily of ethnic loyalty.\\" In other words, \\"a person could adopt an entirely Western way of life but still retain great love and loyalty to the ethnic group from which he sprang.\\" As a result, Mazrui proposes the term detraditionalized, recognizing that \\"the erosion of tradition [does] not necessarily mean the dimunition of ethnicity.\\"Mazrui 1978, p. 239-240.  Regional detribalized histories  = In Africa = Comparison of Africa in the years 1880 and 1913 From 1884 to 1885, European powers, along with the United States, convened at the Berlin Conference in order to settle colonial disputes throughout the African continent and protect the economic interests of their colonial empires. The conference was the primary occasion for partitioning, what Europeans commonly referred to as, \\"the dark continent.\\" Africa was to be partitioned by five primary European powers, Britain, France, Germany, Portugal, and Italy, along with King Leopold II of Belgium.Harlow 2003, p. 1. In 1898, Polish-British author Joseph Conrad remarked in Heart of Darkness on how Europeans used color swatches to denote their territorial claims over Africa, a common practice in the period: > There was a vast amount of red [Britain] ‚Äì good to see at any time, because > one knows that some real work is done there, a deuce of a lot of blue > [France], a little green [Portugal], smears of orange, and, on the East > Coast, a purple patch [Germany], to show where the jolly pioneers drink the > jolly lager beer. However, I wasn't going into any of these. I was going > into the yellow [Belgium]. Dead in the center.Conrad [1902] 1990, p. 7. An empire had to demonstrate effective occupation of the land they were claiming in order to justify their claims to it. Under these guidelines, scholar Kitty Millet has noted, that effective \\"'connoted farms, gardens, roads, railways, [and] even [a] postal service.\\" The only entities which could claim ownership \\"over these diverse African spaces... had to be one of the powers at the conference. Local or Indigenous groups were neither imaginable as political powers nor visible as peers or subjects of European sovereigns.\\" Not only were Indigenous peoples not physically represented at the Berlin Conference, they were also absent \\"to the European powers' conceptualization of territory. They were not 'on the map'.\\"Millet 2018, p. 80-81. Rather, Indigenous peoples were perceived by Europeans as property of the land living in an inferior state of nature. Prior to their consciousness of their own \\"whiteness,\\" Millet notes that Europeans were first \\"conscious of the superiority of their developmental 'progress' ... 'Savages' had temporary huts; they roamed the countryside. They were incapable of using nature appropriately. The colour of their skins condemned them.\\" Because Indigenous nations were deemed to be \\"uncivilized,\\" European powers declared the territorial sovereignty of Africa as openly available, which initiated the Scramble for Africa in the late nineteenth century. With the continent of Africa conceptualized as effectively \\"ownerless\\" territory, Europeans positioned themselves as its redeemers and rightful colonial rulers. In the European colonial mindset, Africans were inferior and incapable of being \\"civilized\\" because they had failed to properly manage or exploit the natural resources available to them. As a result, they were deemed to be obstacles to capitalist investment, extraction, and production of natural resources in the construction of a new colonial empire and built environment. The immense diversity of the Indigenous peoples of Africa was flattened by this colonial perception, which labeled them instead as an \\"unrepresentable nomadic horde of apprehensions that ran across European territories.\\"Millet 2018, p. 82-84. British and French colonial authorities, who policed and controlled the majority of territory in Africa by the early twentieth century, were notably ambivalent towards \\"modernizing\\" African people. Donald Cameron, the British governor of Tanganyika as well as, later, of Nigeria, stated in 1925: \\"It is our duty to do everything in our power to develop the native on lines which will not Westernize him and turn him into a bad imitation of a European.\\" Instead, Cameron argued that \\"the task of 'native administration' was to make him into a 'good African.'\\" While the French openly professed that their involvement in Africa was a \\"civilizing mission,\\" scholar Peter A. Blitstein notes that in practice they rejected African \\"assimilation into French culture,\\" excluded them \\"from French citizenship,\\" and emphasized \\"how different Africans were from French, and how important it was to keep the two races separate.\\" Mahmood Mamdani has contended that rather than a \\"civilizing mission,\\" as was often claimed by European powers to be the rationale for colonization, colonial policy instead sought to \\"'stabilize racial domination by 'ground[ing] it in a politically enforced system of ethnic pluralism.'\\"Blitstein 2006, p. 285. In the twentieth century, colonial authorities in Africa intentionally and actively worked to prevent the emergence of nationalist and working-class movements which could ultimately threaten their authority and colonial rule by preventing \\"detribalization,\\" which Europeans interpreted as occurring through the urbanization, liberal education, and proletarianization of African people, regardless if they were actually detached from their ethnic identity or community or not. European powers adopted a policy of indirect rule, which (1) relied on the use of \\"traditional\\" African leadership to maintain order, which was also understood by Europeans, according to historian Leroy Vail, to be \\"markedly less expensive than the employment of expensive European officials,\\" and (2) was rooted in the belief that \\"Africans were naturally 'tribal' people.\\"Vail 1991, p. 13. As a result, \\"detribalization was the ghost which haunted the system\\" of indirect rule by threatening to undermine colonial capitalist hegemony in Africa. European perspectives of Africans were thoroughly infused with racism, which, according to John E. Flint, \\"served to justify European power over the 'native' and to keep western-educated Africans from contaminating the rest.\\" Additionally, Alice Conklin has found that, in the post-World War I period, some officials in French West Africa may have \\"discovered in 'primitive' Africa an idealized premodern and patriarchal world reminiscent of the one they had lost at Verdun,\\" a paternalistic position which nonetheless may have served as a rationale for fears over detribalization and the \\"consequences of modernity.\\"Blitstein 2006, p. 285-286. Under indirect rule, universal primary and secondary education were not adopted in British or French colonies in Africa in order to avoid creating a class of \\"unemployable and politically dangerous, 'pseudo-Europeanized' natives.\\" A curriculum which instead directed Africans towards fulfilling subservient roles Europeans perceived them as \\"destined\\" to play, commonly as members of the colonial peasantry and exploited laborers, was alternatively adopted. French and British fears over detribalization were also demonstrated via their attitudes toward the notion of African wage labor and proletarianization. For this reason, African wage labor was only determined necessary when it aided the advancement or progress of the colonial capitalist state, such as via the African colonial mining industry. According to Peter A. Blitstein, neither the British or the French were \\"able to see wage workers as anything but 'detribalized' and, therefore, dangerous.\\" As a result, the ideal model for African colonial society was one in which small-scale producers could be provided with temporary migrant labor as needed, since \\"to recognize Africans as workers would ultimately equate them to Europeans, and, perhaps, require the kinds of welfare-state provisions that European workers were beginning to enjoy ‚Äì trade union membership, insurance, a family wage.\\"Blitstein 2006, p. 286-287. During World War II, a study authored by four colonial functionaries and commissioned by the Vichy French government's ministry of the colonies in 1944 entitled \\"Condition of the detribalized natives\\" called for \\"the systematic and immediate expulsion of any native illegally entering metropolitan France.\\" Historian Eric T. Jennings has commented how this policy was \\"certainly not new\\" and had been informed by \\"a host of reductionist thinkers from Gustave Le Bon to Edouard Drumont or Alexis Carrel\\" while also eerily foreshadowing arguments to be used by the modern French far right. Jean Paillard, an influential colonial theoriest in Vichy France feared \\"native domination\\" in which \\"the colonizers would eventually come under the domination of the colonized.\\" Similarly, the authors of the study maintained that \\"the detribalized native becomes an immoral creature as soon as he reaches the city,\\" reiterating European colonial viewpoints in the twentieth century by emphasizing that \\"detribalization\\" must be avoided above all measures. However, when detribalization becomes \\"unavoidable\\" it must \\"be accompanied by a strict regimen\\" of control. Since, according to the study, when \\"left to their own devices,\\" the \\"detribalized\\" person becomes a drunken failure in European society due to their innate inferiority. Jennings argues that this study attempted to invent a \\"retribalization\\" effort for the \\"detribalized\\" person and was hinged upon the larger \\"apocalyptic fears of a world dominated by unruly and debauched 'natives,' uprooted from their 'natural environments.'\\" This study reflected much of the European theoretical perception of detribalized peoples of the period, as further exemplified in Maurice Barr√®s's Uprooted (1941).Jennings 2004, p. 27-29 Following World War II, colonial policy began to shift from preventing \\"detribalization\\" to more widely promoting devices for economic and cultural development in African colonial societies and, eventually, in both the British and French case, self- government as a means of obtaining independence. European colonial empires in Africa increasingly opted for nationalization rather than previous policies of indirect rule and forced contracted or temporary labor. However, according to historian Peter A. Blitstein, the ultimate objectives of the British and French for Westernizing colonized and \\"detribalized\\" Africans remained unclear by the mid-twentieth century, as colonizers struggled to articulate how Africans could be brought into congruence with their visions of \\"modernity.\\"Blitstein 2006, p. 291-292. Throughout post-independence Africa, two different types of African states emerged, according to scholar Mahmood Mamdani, which he terms as \\"the conservative and the radical\\" African states. While the conservative African state adopted a decentralized form of despotic authority which \\"tended to bridge the urban-rural divide through a clientelism whose effect was to exacerbate ethnic divisions,\\" the radical African state adopted a centralized form of despotic authority which contributed to detribalization by tightening control over local authorities. Mamdani theorizes that \\"if the two-pronged division that the colonial state enforced on the colonized ‚Äì between town and country, and between ethnicities ‚Äì was its dual legacy at independence, each of the two versions of the postcolonial state tended to soften one part of the legacy while exacerbating the other.\\"Mamdani 2018, p. 25-26.  Southern Africa  Nama presenting green copper-bearing rocks to the Dutch East India Company at the Cape, which initiated an expedition to extract the ore by the Dutch in 1685. In the seventeenth century, the Dutch East India Company was importing shiploads of slaves to South Africa, transferring the former colonial station for passing ships into a slaveholding colony. In 1685, the Cape Colony's last company commander and first governor Simon van der Stel formed an exploration party to locate a copper reserve that the Indigenous Nama people had shown him. The Nama were reportedly described by the colonists as \\"'very friendly'\\" and, scholar Kitty Millet notes that, \\"relations were so amenable between the Nama and the Dutch settlers that the Nama treated the colony to a musical 'exhibition' for the governor's birthday.\\" However, shortly after Dutch settlers introduced slave labor to the region and arrived in increasingly greater numbers, conflicts from 1659 to 1660 and 1673 to 1677, followed by a smallpox outbreak caused the majority of the Nama people to flee from their traditional territory. Those who remained soon \\"existed as 'detribalized indigenous peoples'.\\"Millet 2018, p. 64. Early maps created by European colonizers portrayed an image of southern Africa as a terra nullius of \\"uncivilized\\" Indigenous villages and \\"wild beasts.\\" As early as the 1760s, it was Europeans sought to organize Nama settlements in the region into \\"'natural' preserves\\" which would segregate colonists from Indigenous peoples. When the British first took over the colony in 1798, John Barrow, a British statesman, perceived himself as \\"a reformer in comparison with the Boer [Dutch] 'burghers' and government officials whose embrace of slavery, and land grabs, had destroyed not only Nama tribes living near them, but also the land itself on which they staked their farms.\\" The Nama tribes on the Namaaqua plain had been absorbed into the South African colony as \\"individual units of labour\\" and reportedly lived \\"in a state of 'detribalization.'\\" As the Nama were increasingly exploited and brought into subservience to Europeans, many completely abandoned the territory of the expanding Cape Colony, choosing instead to settle along the Orange River. Many were also absorbed into Orlam communities, where \\"they existed as herders and 'outlaws,' conducting raids on Boer farms.\\"Millet 2018, p. 65-67. From 1800 to 1925, over 1,030 mission stations were established throughout southern Africa by approximately 60 missionary societies from Europe. A study on the location and role of these mission stations by Franco Frescura noted how throughout the nineteenth century there was a \\"spreading geographical presence of missionaries over southern Africa\\" which paralleled the restructuring of the social, economic, and political landscape of the region by colonial forces. Despite their stated purpose, missionaries were reportedly unsuccessful in converting many Indingenous people. One study reported that only about \\"12% of people on mission settlements were there for spiritual reasons\\" and that the majority of people often remained either for a \\"material advantage or psychological security.\\" Throughout southern Africa, while \\"some groups such as the Basotho and the Tswana openly welcomed missionaries, others like the Pedi, the Zulu, and the Pondo vehemently rejected their presence as a matter of national policy.\\" In some cases, entire populations relocated away from the mission settlements and ostracized members of their community who had been converted or resided at the settlements, effectively removing them from their communities. In 1806, German missionaries working under the London Missionary Society were reportedly the \\"first white persons\\" to arrive in what is now modern-day Namibia. They soon founded mission stations with surrounding fields and territories in an effort to Christianize and sedenteraize the Indigenous peoples. However, because of the harsh climate and severe drought, their attempts at maintaining the stations failed, although they converted one Orlam kaptein, Jager Afrikaner, the father of Jonker Afrikaner, who would become an important Namibian politician. Missionaries struggled to indoctrinate the Indigenous peoples in the region with their ideologies due to outright opposition from the Herero, who were the most powerful Indigenous group and were unconvinced of the professed \\"holy mission\\" of the missionaries. The Herero, like other Indigenous people in the region, were perceived as \\"uncivilized\\" by European settlers because they did not practice sedentary farming nor openly accept Western ideologies. A German missionary illuminated this wider perspective regarding his encounters with the Nama people: \\"The Nama does not want to work but to live a life of ease. But the Gospel says he must work in the sweat of his brows. He is therefore opposed to the Gospel.\\"Millet 2018, p. 67-68. This was a common perception among missionaries in southern Africa, who \\"sought to impose an alien morality and work ethos upon the local people without realizing that these undermined their most basic social and cultural tenets and were therefore largely resisted.\\" The status of detribalization was perceived by Dutch colonizers as a potential method of redemption, as noted by scholar Kitty Millet, so that \\"the 'detribalized' African\\" could learn \\"his proper place\\" as a member of an exploited class of laborers fueling colonial industry.Millet 2018, p. 68. Orlam people were understood as \\"detribalized Namas\\" who had now lived for several generations on the outskirts of colonial society as both indentured bonded servants and as enslaved people subjugated to a position of servitude to the Dutch, and later the British.Millet 2018, p. 74-75. In the nineteenth century, as Millet reports, there was a \\"concerted effort\\" by the Dutch Cape Colony government to \\"detach individuals from the tribal group\\" of the Orlam, \\"to 'detribalize' them through labor, either through indenture or enslavement.\\" In order to maintain the colonial capitalist order, the Dutch \\"not only wanted to destroy the physical polities of indigenous tribes among or in proximity to them, substituting them with a docile class of labourers, but also wanted them to forget, completely, their prior existence as 'independent' peoples. The colony's 'health' depended on the removal of independent tribes and, in their stead, the visibility of the 'detribalized' servant.\\" In order to psychologically condition Orlam people to accept a subordinate role, the Dutch deliberately infantilized enslaved peoples to reinforce their status as inferior. In this regard, even if a slave escaped captivity and joined \\"free\\" Orlam communities as a fugitive, \\"the slave brought with him the memory of this infantilization.\\" This dehumanizing treatment collectively triggered widespread resistance to Dutch colonialism in Orlam communities, who formed an aware and active community in Cape Town by maintaining relationships with enslaved peoples who remained under Dutch control. The British, who reacquired control over the Cape Colony in 1806, similarly sought to continue this system of exploitation for the benefit of the British Empire. This pushed Orlam communities further to the margins, especially as Dutch Boer farmers themselves \\"annexed more land, and moved closer to the 'fringes'\\" as a response to the transference of colonial political power. This ongoing resistance within Orlam communities led to the formation of politically centralized leaders in the early nineteenth century, known as kapteins, who functioned as authorities in the community unlike in any traditional Nama society.Millet 2018, p. 75-76. As the Dutch and British targeted Orlam kapteins, scholar Kitty Millet notes, \\"even more 'detribalized' individuals [joined] the 'fugitives' already established at the margins\\" of colonial society. However, either oblivious to or refusing to acknowledge their own role in generating this deeply entrenched resistance, the British credited Orlam resistance with what they perceived to be an \\"ontological predisposition\\" within the detribalized Orlam people, which allegedly reflected a \\"primitive 'state of being'.\\" They presumed that the Orlam's reestablishment as communities at the fringes of colonial society was an expression of their inherent nomadic disposition. As resistance continued to the colonial order, more and more groups with \\"diverse origins\\" also joined Orlam collectives, despite being notably \\"unrelated to their kapteins.\\" Despite the heterogeneity of the Orlam collectives, they were able to fight their own subjugation and reestablish themselves as an Indigenous polity.Millet 2018, p. 76-77. Over time, the burgeoning numbers of resistance groups could not be sustained by the surrounding region of the Cape Colony because of low rainfall and drought. As resources depleted, detribalized Orlam resistance groups moved northward and eventually crossed the Orange River to reunite with the Nama. Each of the Orlam resistance groups requested permission from the Nama confederation and reentered Nama land between 1815 and 1851. As they reintegrated into the Nama community, the Orlam groups quickly transformed how the Nama perceived themselves and their relationships with the neighboring Herero as well as colonial traders and missionaries who had accompanied the Orlam resistance groups in their reintegration. As a result of this reintegration, Kitty Millet notes that a new Nama leadership emerged under Kido Witbooi's grandson, Hendrik Witbooi. Hendrik was a Christian who understood his leadership as a divine mandate. While traditional Nama tribes had preferred pacifism to armed conflict prior to the integration of the detribalized Orlam groups, Witbooi altered this understanding and believed it was his mission to continue the resistance effort among the Nama. Witbooi would later be killed in battle with German colonial military forces in 1905 and is now understood to be a national hero in Namibia. German South West Africa was established in 1884 following decades of German settlers and missionaries occupying the region and conducting work through missionary societies such as the Rhenish Missionary Society. The German Empire officially claimed dominion and sovereignty over present-day Namibia, which included the traditional territories of the Herero and Ovambo of the northern region, bands of Khoisan (San and Khoikhoi) in the central and southern regions, and the Damara in the mountainous regions. German colonists unilaterally applied the category of \\"bushmen\\" to these groups, because they perceived them as primitive \\"hunter-gatherers.\\" Related to the Khoikhoi were the Nama, who by the nineteenth century had settled in the southwestern regions of Namibia and northern South Africa as a result of colonial displacement. The British similarly referred to Khoisan and Nama in the Cape Colony as \\"Hottentots,\\" a name originally applied by the Germans in South West Africa. These labels demonstrated the European colonial perspective of Indigenous peoples, which flattened their complexities into a singular class of uniform colonized subjects.Millet 2018, p. 73-74. In the nineteenth century, European missionaries sought to eradicate Indigenous ways of living and knowing through the process of Christianization to, as scholar Jason Hickel argues, mold them into \\"the bourgeois European model.\\" As colonial German academic and theologian Gustav Warneck stated in 1888, \\"without doubt it is a far more costly thing to kill the [Indigenous population] than to Christianise them.\\" Contrary to the stated \\"civilizing\\" objectives of missionaries, colonial administrators sought to preserve \\"traditional\\" African structures in order to maintain their indirect rule, consistently pushing Africans to the margins of colonial society. According to Hickel, administrators even regarded \\"the idea of a civilizing mission with suspicion, fearing that 'detribalization' would lead to social anomie, mass unrest, and the rise of a politically conscious class that would eventually undermine minority rule altogether.\\" The Native Affairs Department, established by the British South African Company in 1894, sought to prop up African \\"tradition\\" for this reason: > The idea was to prevent urbanization by keeping Africans confined to native > reserves, and to govern them according to a codified form of customary law > through existing patriarchs and chiefs. Then, using an intricate network of > influx controls, Africans were brought temporarily to the cities for work on > fixed-term contracts, at the end of which they were expelled back to the > reserves. The system was purposefully designed to prevent full > proletarianization and forestall the rise of radical consciousness.Hickel > 2015, p. 91. However, by the early twentieth century, as a result of the \\"insatiable appetite [of colonizers] for cheap labor,\\" the previous colonial policy of indirect rule began to weaken considerably, which resulted in the emergence of numerous informal settlements on the peripheries of \\"white cities\\" in southern Africa. In response to the overwhelming \\"unauthorized\\" urbanization of Africans, European colonial administrators eventually adopted the moralizing approach of their missionary counterparts and sought to \\"reform\\" African shanties, which were regarded as undisciplined chaotic spaces that blurred the order of colonial society as a \\"social-evolutionary misfire.\\" Social scientists of the period upheld this perspective and disseminated these ideas widely, as represented in their perceptions of the \\"detribalized\\" African subjects who they perceived as inhabiting these peripheral informal settlements.Hickel 2015, p. 92-93. Zwelihle Township, in Hermanus, South Africa. ca. 2008 Austro-Hungarian philosopher Karl Polanyi referred to \\"detribalized\\" South Africans in highly racist and pathological terms, stating that the \\"kaffir of South Africa, a noble savage, whom none felt socially more secure in his native kraal, has been transformed into a human variety of half- domesticated animal dressed in the 'unrelated, the filthy, the unsightly rags that not the most degenerated white man would wear,' a nondescript being, without self-respect or standards, veritable human refuse.\\" Anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski similarly \\"decried 'detribalized' natives as 'sociologically unsound' monstrosities who had lost the regulated order of 'tribal' society ‚Äì but given their lack of access to the necessary material resources ‚Äì had failed to approximate the structure of 'European' society.\\" The \\"out-of-category\\" status of \\"detribalized\\" urban South Africans was perceived as a threat to the European colonial order. In South Africa and Namibia, the colonial government soon \\"forced [their] relocations into modernist townships laid out along rectilinear grids\\" with the stated intention of conditioning \\"detribalized\\" Africans to become \\"happy, docile subjects\\" who would \\"internalize the values of European domesticity.\\"Hickel 2015, p. 93-94. While Europeans and white South Africans during this period classed all urban Africans as \\"detribalized,\\" this was largely an extension of existing racism which had flattened all Africans into indistinguishable masses of \\"disorderly\\" racialized subjects and was not necessarily reflective of reality. In fact, many Indigenous people working on European-owned farms and in urban districts were not formally \\"detribalized,\\" or detached from their \\"tribal\\" identities or communities. Professor at Stellenbosch University J. F. W. Grosskopf recorded that \\"many Europeans coming into touch with the native only in the bigger centres seem inclined to over-estimate the number of 'detribalized' natives... Such natives may have adopted a semi-European urban mode of life for several years, while it still remains a difficult matter for the white man to say how far tribal influence and connection has actually ceased.\\" In 1914, Grosskopf documented an instance in which several urbanized Black South Africans who had \\"never visited their tribe in Thaba Nehu\\" left their \\"permanent and well-paid jobs in Bloomfontein\\" after a Baralong chief \\"bought land for his followers in the southern part of Rhodesia.\\" They recorded in a notice to their employers that they were leaving \\"'for our chief is calling us'.\\"Robertson 2015, p. 143. British anthropologist Isaac Schapera similarly noted that urbanization did not necessarily imply detribalization, essentially regonizing the differences between assimilation in Western society and detribalization. Yet, with increasingly racist perceptions of Black South Africans, scholar Jason Hickel notes that \\"white South Africans saw detribalization as a process of decay, as the decomposition of tribal social order into a chaotic tangle of random persons and unmarried women.\\" This was exemplified in their perceptions of townships, which were \\"regarded as makeshift and transient, in between the traditional African homestead and the modern European house.\\"Hickel 2015, p. 98. White South Africans adopted, what they considered to be, a \\"civilizing mission\\" with reluctance, conceding that \\"urban Africans\\" were \\"needed as labor\\" and \\"could [thus] not be 'retribalized.'\\" The first townships at Baumannville, Lamontville, and Chesterville were constructed in the 1930s and 1940s for this purpose. According to Hickel, the planners of these townships sought to \\"reconcile two competing ideas: on the one hand a fear that 'detribalization' of Africans would engender immense social upheaval, and, on the other hand, a belief that 'civilizing' Africans into an established set of social norms would facilitate docility.\\"Hickel 2015, p. 99-100. These conditions and perceptions continued throughout the apartheid era in South Africa and Namibia.Hickel 2015, p. 111. South African political theorist Aletta Norval notes that as the apartheid system expanded, \\"the 'detribalized Native' had to be regarded as a 'visitor' in the cities until such time as the ideal of total apartheid could be reached\\" through complete racial segregation.Norval 1996, p. 119. In Sounds of a Cowhide Drum (1971), Soweto poet Oswald Mbuyiseni Mtshali authored a poem entitled \\"The Detribalised\\" in which he described the consequences of detribalization and township life in South Africa. In a review of his work by Doreen Anderson Wood, she acknowledges how \\"sociologists and anthropologists have observed how detribalization and forcing mine workers into compound living [has] weakened family life in Africa, but few portray it with Mtshali's punch.\\" Wood asserts that because they have been \\"denied admittance into full twentieth-century life[,] the detribalized fall into a vacuum of surface sophistication with no values underpinning it.\\" Mtshali's poem encapsulates the experience of an unnamed man who was \\"born in Sophiatown, or Alexandra, I am not sure, but certainly not in Soweto.\\" This \\"detribalized\\" man, in Mtshali's perspective, did not care for politics or concern himself with the imprisonment of anti-apartheid figures like Robert Sobukwe or Nelson Mandela on Robben Island, and was perhaps reflective, in Wood's words, of men who had been removed from the \\"stabilizing influences of tribal life\\" as a result of colonialism.Wood 1977, p. 559-560.Boehmer 2010, p. 116-117. = In the Americas = Regarding the greater Mesoamerican region, scholar Roberto Cintli Rodr√≠guez describes how the Spanish inflicted two forms of colonization upon Indigenous peoples. While the first conquest refers to the military conquest campaigns under the authority of Hern√°n Cort√©s and other conquistadors, \\"La Otra Conquista [or the Other Conquest] included religiously motivated crusades to destroy all the temples, 'idols,' and books of Indigenous peoples.\\" Coupled with centuries of violence, in which millions of Indigenous people were \\"devastated by war, mass killings, rape, enslavement, land theft, starvation, famine, and disease,\\" the Other Conquest was simultaneously facilitated by the Spanish from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries with the central objecive of destroying \\"ma√≠z-based beliefs and cultures of Indigenous peoples, ushering in a radical shift in the axis mundi or center of the universe from ma√≠z to the Christian cross,\\" with the threat of death, torture, and eternal damnation for a refusal to conform to the colonial order. Rodr√≠guez illuminates that although outright usage of force from the church has faded, official church messages in Latin America still continue to reinforce this practice today.Rodr√≠guez 2014, p. 6-7. Spanish colonizers established a system of \\"congregaciones (the congregation of peoples) and the project of reducciones (spiritual 'reductions')\\" in an effort \\"to corrall Indians into missions or pueblos for the purpose of reducing or eliminating or 'killing' the souls of the Indians, creating Christians in their place.\\" This method of \\"spiritually reducing Indians also served to facilitate land theft,\\" and was first implemented in 1546, only to be reaffirmed numerous times throughout the colonial period. In 1681, as part of the Laws of the Indies, issued by the Spanish Crown for the American and the Philippine possessions of its empire, \\"continued the reduction of the Indians (their instruction in the Holy Faith) 'so that they could forget the errors of their ancient rites and ceremonies'.\\" The reduction policies instituted by the Spanish colonizers \\"included the systemic demonization by Spanish friars of virtually all things Indigenous, particularly the people themselves, unless saved or baptized.\\"Rodr√≠guez 2014, p. 18. The \\"official Spanish practice regarding what language, indigenous or Castilian, should be employed in the evangelization effort [throughout New Spain] was often confused.\\" The \\"colonial aim\\" was to Hispanicize the Indigenous people and to forcibly separate them from identifying with their cultural practices; \\"church and state officials intermittently used various decrees reiterating the official position and requiring that the Indians systematically be taught Spanish,\\" such as one issued by the archbishop in Mexico City in 1717. At the same time, because many missionaries were \\"more interested in trying to impart what they considered the basis of their faith to the native peoples as quickly as possible\\" through Christianization, this led many to \\"acquire the rudiments of the indigenous languages\\" for the purposes of indoctrinating Indigenous people to become Christians.Beebe and Senkewicz 2015, p. 94.  Brazil  \\"Caboclo\\" by Jean-Baptiste Debret ca. 1834. \\"Caboclo\\" is a derogatory term meant to denote \\"civilized Indians\\" ‚Äî a generic name that was given to detribalized baptized Indigenous people. It has also been used to mean \\"half-breed\\" or \\"of mixed blood.\\"Langfur, Hal (2014). Native Brazil: Beyond the Convert and the Cannibal, 1500-1900. University of New Mexico Press. pp. 67, 147. ISBN 9780826338419. Portuguese colonizers arrived on the eastern seaboard of South America in 1500 and had established permanent settlements in the interior regions of Amazonia a century later. Expeditions into the interior were carried out by Portuguese bandeirantes, who often \\"depended on Amerindians as rowers, collectors, and guides.\\" Despite this relationship, bandeirantes frequently turned these exploratory crusades \\"into slaving expeditions\\" through abducting, detaining, and exploiting the Indigenous peoples in Brazil.Langfur 2014, p. 147.Schmink and Wood 1992, p. 37-39. The expeditions also carried \\"European diseases and death far into the interior\\" of the region. In 1645, Jesuit priests under the leadership of Antonio Vieira \\"began establishing missions along the major Amazon River tributaries,\\" which forcibly relocated large subsets of the Indigenous population into new colonial settlements: > Amerindian groups were relocated into large settlements, called aldeias, > where their daily activities could be closely supervised, their souls could > be saved, and their labor could be put to new tasks, such as raising cattle. > In the aldeias, natives were deprived of their tribal identity under the > homogenizing influence of the missionaries. Compelled to communicate with > whites and other natives in the lingua geral, tribal Amerindians were > gradually transformed into 'generic Indians' or tapuios.Schmink and Wood > 1992, p. 37-39. The term tapuio \\"originally meant 'slave',\\" though soon after, referred to detribalized and Christianized Indigenous people who had assimilated into \\"colonial society,\\" defined as such by their place of residence and proximity to colonial society.Schmink and Wood 1992, p. 54.Harris 2010, p. 42-43; 306. It has been used interchangeably with caboclo, recognized as a derogatory term \\"equivalent to half-breed\\" or \\"of mixed blood,\\" as well as carij√≥, which also referred to \\"detribalized Indians.\\"Langfur 2014, p. 69; 147. These labels differed from gentio, a similarly derogatory term which referred to unconverted and non-assimilated Indigenous people.Harris 2010, 42-43; 306.MacMillan 1995, 10-11. Slave expeditions by the bandeirantes continued throughout the eighteenth century with the intention of stealing precious metals, especially gold, from the interior, which further led to \\"the acquisition of land grants, official appointments, and other rewards and honors\\" for white male settlers. At the same time, \\"Indians seized in confrontations with colonists were used as mining, agricultural, and domestic laborers,\\" while others, and especially Indigenous women, faced rape and sexual assault.Langfur 2014, p. 146-148. While the expanding network of Jesuit missions \\"provided a measure of protection from the slavers who made annual expeditions into the interior,\\" they simultaneously altered \\"the mental and material bases of Amerindian culture forever.\\" While tapuios were \\"nominally free\\" (or free in name) at the missions, they were actually \\"obliged to provide labor to royal authorities and to colonists, a practice that frequently deteriorated into forced work hardly distinguishable from outright slavery.\\" The aldeias also proliferated the \\"spread of European diseases, such as whooping cough, influenza, and smallpox, against which native populations had no immunity,\\" which \\"killed tens of thousands of Amerindians\\" and pressured others to retreat deeper into the interior.Schmink and Wood 1992, p. 37-39. Jesuit priests, who by the mid-eighteenth century controlled \\"some twelve thousand Amerindians in sixty-three Amazonian missions,\\" were expelled from Brazil in 1759. This increased opportunities for the enslavement, murder, and displacement of Indigenous people by \\"colonial authorities, landowners, and merchants,\\" which had already been ongoing.Schmink and Wood 1992, p. 39-40. While in the mid-seventeenth century \\"the Amazonian population was mainly indigenous except in the urban centers... by the middle of the eighteenth century, except for native groups that fled to remote refuge areas, the region's population consisted mostly of detribalized, subjugated tapuios\\"Schmink and Wood 1992, p. 39-40. who were inserted \\"into a civilized, Catholic world under the auspices of their masters, resulting in the indiscriminate appropriation of native labor.\\"Langfur 2014, p. 149-151. The detibalized population of Indigenous people \\"were survivors or captives of raids\\" for over a century and \\"now lived in Mineiro towns and other localities under the tutelage of colonists.\\" They were \\"detribalized for diverse reasons, of various ethnic and/or geographic origins, brought to live in or born into colonial society and thereby incorporated in the social and cultural life of Minas Gerais during the eighteenth century.\\"Langfur 2014, p. 150-152. New legislation in the 1750s, sought to affirm \\"the freedom of Brazil's Indians,\\" which was articulated \\"in a series of royal laws.\\" This was only extended to Indigenous people who had been Christianized and somewhat assimilated: \\"once the state 'conveyed the law of God to the barbarous nations, reducing them to the Catholic faith and to the true knowledge of His Holy Name'.\\" However, it \\"provided a mechanism by which Indians who migrated to towns and villages could defy colonists' attempts to keep them in bondage.\\"Langfur 2014, p. 150-152. A key aspect of this was \\"proving their Indigenous ancestry,\\" which many detribalized people found difficult. At the same time, \\"administrators sought to conceal the ethnic origin of these Indians, labeling them with names that corresponded with generic mixed-race categories like caboclo (detribalized Indian rustic), curiboca (Afro-native mestizo), and cabra de terra ('goat'; i.e. mestizo of this land), among many others.\\" > By thus engendering the ‚Äúinvisibility‚Äù of these peoples, they created a > loophole in royal legislation, since the crown did not prohibit the > captivity of mesti√ßos whose racial mixture derived in part from enslaved > mothers of African descent. With this tactic, they legitimized indigenous > slavery. Had it not been for the insistence of colonial Indians, resolute in > setting the justice system in motion in order to guarantee the recognition > of their indigenous origins, these individuals surely would have remained > enslaved... That said, attempts to turn Indians back into slaves were not > uncommon, and many Indians failed to evade the schemes of the most stubborn > colonists.Langfur 2014, p. 154-155. While revolts by detribalized Indigenous people were common, following the relocation of the Portuguese Crown to Brazil in 1808, \\"mission villages were destroyed, their resources seized, and inhabitants [were] pressed into forced labor.\\" As the size of the white population reportedly grew, \\"a new wave of military action\\" was carried out against \\"remaining tribal groups.\\"Schmink and Wood 1992, p. 39-40. Once forcibly congregated into centralized colonial settlements, by the turn of the nineteenth century, detribalized Indigenous people \\"became scattered along the rivers, streams, and lakes of the Amazon basin where they lived primarily in small family groups\\" and developed sustenance strategies which \\"drew heavily from the indigenous groups from whom they were descended.\\" However, while \\"preconquest Amerindian populations labored only for subsistence and occasional trade with neighboring tribes, the Jesuits taught the tapuios to produce commodities,\\" which continued to link them into the global market by way of river traders, who \\"would deliver the goods to distant world markets.\\"Schmink and Wood 1992, p. 41-42. Many tapuios or caboclos inhabited \\"the same flood plains from which their ancestors had been displaced by the Portuguese\\" while culturally intact and \\"remaining Indian groups [had] confined themselves largely to managing inaccessible upland areas.\\"MacMillan 1995, 10-11. In 1822, as Brazil declared independence from Portuguese colonial rule, Amazonia was integrated into the newly unstable Brazilian state. Political tensions erupted into full-scale rebellions, the largest of which was the Cabanagem revolt in Par√°, in which \\"rebels turned with a vengeance on their landlords and patrons,\\" resulting in an estimated death rate of at least thirty thousand, or one quarter of the province's population.Schmink and Wood 1992, p. 41-42. Tapuios had been continually exploited as a \\"great reserve labor force in Amazonia\\" and \\"as such played an important role\\" in the revolt.Treece 2000, p. 79-80. Many tapuios as well as \\"black slaves, and other workers fled\\" following the revolt \\"because they were cabanos [rebels] or to escape forced labor.\\"Schmink and Wood 1992, p. 41-42. Prior to the revolt, detribalized people had been \\"transformed into a dispersed propertyless mass alienated both from the intact, isolated tribal groups of the interior and from the rural white population.\\" European ethnographers documented the effects of detribalization on the tapuios, who cited their poor treatment and lack of belonging as socially and psychologically damaging. Occupying an \\"ambiguous\\" social category between intact tribal groups and the white population, the \\"claims and interests\\" of the tapuios could not be effectively addressed by the Brazilian state, meaning they were faced with immediate \\"extermination or integration. Between these two alternatives there could exist no gray area questioning the value of assimilation into white society.\\"Treece 2000, p. 79-80. The exploitation of the tapuios was documented in travel journals of European and American colonizers in the mid-nineteenth century. In Exploration of the Valley of the Amazon by US Navy lieutenants William Lewis Herndon and Lardner Gibbon, tapuios are referred to as \\"peons\\" and were described in 1849, along with \\"negroes\\" and \\"mestizos\\" by the President of the province of Par√°, Jeronimo Francisco Coelho, as \\"people void of civilization and education, and who exceeded in number the worthy, laborious, and industrious part of the population by more than three-quarters.\\" Herndon and Gibbon affirmed that \\"a better description of the origin and character of these bodies of laborers cannot be given.\\" These racist perceptions held by colonizers seemingly rationalized their right to exploit the labor of these groups, which was also entwined with Christianization and the role of the colonial church: \\"All the christianized Indians of the province of Par√° are registered and compelled to serve the State, either as soldiers of the Guarda Policial or as a member of 'Bodies of Laborers,' distributed among the different territorial divisions of the province.\\"Herndon and Gibbon 1854, p. 256. Regarding the Brazilian province of Amazonas, Herndon and Gibbon recorded that the Brazilian government continued to fear the power of the tapuios to revolt against \\"the foreigners,\\" given their greater numbers as well as \\"the terrible revolution of the Cabanos (serfs, people who lived in cabins) in the years from 1836 to 1840, when many Portuguese were killed and expelled.\\" As such, the President and government asserted \\"that laws must be made for the control and government of the sixty-thousand tapuios, who so far outnumbered the property-holders, and who are always open to the influence of the designing, the ambitious, and the wicked.\\" The population of the province was recorded at \\"thirty thousand inhabitants ‚Äì whites and civilized Indians,\\" yet Herndon and Gibbon admitted that \\"no estimate can be made of the number of 'Gentios,' or savages.\\" The American lieutenants expressed their support for further colonizing the region, even advocating for United States slaveholders to do so: > I presume that the Brazilian government would impose no obstacles to the > settlement of this country by any of the citizens of the United States who > would choose to go there and carry their slaves; and I know that the > thinking people on the Amazon would be glad to see them. The President, who > is laboring for the good of the province, and sending for the chiefs of the > Indian tribes for the purpose of engaging them in settlement and systematic > labor, said to me, at parting 'How much I wish you could bring me a thousand > of your active, industrious, and intelligent population, to set and example > of labor to these people;' and others told me that they had no doubt that > Brazil would give titles to vacant lands to as many as came.Herndon and > Gibbon 1854, p. 268.  Mexico  \\"De Mestizo y de India, Coyote\\" by Miguel Cabrera, ca. 1763. Painting depicts a group within the Spanish alt= Mexican anthropologist Guillermo Bonfil Batalla and other scholars have used the term \\"de- Indianization\\" to describe a \\"historical process through which populations that originally possessed a particular and distinctive identity, based upon their own culture, are forced to renounce that identity, with all the consequent changes in their social organization and culture.Bonfil Batalla 1996, p. 17-18. The process of de-Indianization in Mexico was a colonial project which largely succeeded, according to Bonfil Batalla, \\"in convincing large parts of the Mesoamerican population to renounce their identification as members of a specific Indian collectivity.\\"Bonfil Batalla 1996, p. 24. He acknowledges how many Indigenous peoples throughout Mexico were historically expelled or displaced from their traditional territories, while others may have been exterminated, \\"as was the case with the Great Chichimeca of the arid north.\\" These genocidal conditions had the effect of detribalizing many Indigenous people by subjecting them to \\"conditions that made continuity as a culturally different people impossible.\\" Although this process has been referred to as \\"mixture\\" or mestizaje under the colonial Mexican framework, \\"it really was, and is, ethnocide.\\"Bonfil Batalla 1996, p. 24. Christianization has been cited by scholars such as Patrisia Gonzales as an historically important element of the de-Indianization process in Mexico: \\"Spanish priests and authorities sought to spiritually subdue Mexico through de-Indianization, torture, and conversion.\\"Gonzalez 2012, p. 69. Indigenous \\"medicinal knowledge and communication with the natural world became supernatural and demonic\\" under the direct influence of the Mexican Inquisition. Indigenous women, and in particular midwives, were targeted by the Inquisition; \\"Europeans feared that women could control men, which contributed to many women being tried as witches in Europe.\\" Female healers and midwives were identified by European men and the church as a threat to their power, both in Europe and in the Americas. In order to indoctrinate within Indigenous people the inferiority and \\"evil\\" nature of their own practices, the Inquisition \\"used repression of entire families and communities, torture, death, indentured servitude, and even prison\\" as well as \\"public displays of power to repress Indigenous worldviews.\\" As this continued throughout Spanish colonial rule \\"over time, many Indigenous practices became associated with acts of the devil,\\" which conditioned Mexican people to reject Indigenous ways of knowing. \\"Some Native leaders argue that such a conditioning occurs via sermons and faith activities,\\" which continue today, and eventually led \\"to the de-Indianization of Mexicans.\\"Gonzalez 2012, p. 76-78. In urban centers, spatial segregation between \\"Indians\\" and Spaniards, or peninsulares, was instituted by the colonial order, to separate the colonized from the colonizers.Bonfil Batalla 1996, p. 42-48. Because the colony of New Spain was \\"built upon the exploitation of the work force and the agricultural production of the Indians, particularly in the regions of Mesoamerica,\\" it became \\"fundamental for the Colonial regime to define clear ethnic boundaries between Indians and non-Indians.\\" However, the boundaries between the ethnic categories of the colonized in colonial Mexico were \\"relatively flexible in practice\\" as the colonial structure was primarily concentrated on maintaining the \\"hierarchical superiority of the Spaniards\\" above all else.Linares 2009, p. 54-55. There were important distinctions between \\"rich mestizos,\\" who held structural power in Mexico historicallyBonfil Batalla 1996, p. 94. and upheld the Westernization plan introduced by European invaders, from poor or working-class rural and urban mestizos.Bonfil Batalla 1996, p. xv-xvi. > In spite of the elaborate attempts to classify the castas and assign to each > one [individual] a clear position in the stratified order of colonial > society, those who were neither Spaniards (penninsulares or criollos) nor > Indians never found precise placement in a society that rested on the rigid > dual order of colonized and colonizers. Even though the castas were formally > defined by the percentage of different blood they carried ‚Äì American, > African, and European ‚Äì in reality it was social criteria, not biological, > that defined the different groups. Undoubtedly, a large number of racial > mestizos who were born and grew up in Indian communities were considered > Indians. In the same way, many racially pure Indians passed for Mestizos > when they left their communities of origin and became serfs or free > laborers. Some mestizos were taken for creoles, and the passage from one > group to the other had less to do with relative \\"purity of blood\\" than with > other social factors, among which wealth was especially important.Bonfil > Batalla 1996, p. 79. After the successful Mexican War of Independence in 1821, \\"ethnic inequality continued, as the criollos, i.e. persons of Spanish descent born in the Americas, became the dominant group of the new nation.\\" At the time, a minority of the country spoke Spanish, yet it was established as \\"the official language of the nation.\\" Citizenship in Mexico became \\"synonymous with Western culture and thus excluded Indians, Blacks, and other non-European groups unless they renounced their supposedly 'backward' and 'inferior' cultures.\\" Through the implementation of these homogenizing practices, \\"criollos hoped that the majority of Indians and Blacks in Mexico would eventually be dissolved by European immigrants and the nation would be adequately whitened.\\" The criollo elite of the new Mexican nation also instituted a widespread land grab of Indigenous territory throughout the country. While during the Spanish colonial period, the government had \\"recognized the collective property of Indigenous communities, since it was interested in extracting the surplus produced by Indian peasants,\\" following independence, \\"individual property became the only legally recognized form of land tenure, according to the supposedly universal principle of Liberal individualism, and therefore Indigenous communities thus lost legal title to their holdings.\\"Linares 2009, p. 55-56. The Mexican government \\"used armed force to suppress Indian resistance, and in cases where it was successful, Indian lands were distributed and their communities were destroyed.\\" In the 1820s, the government instituted a General Colonization Law which \\"paid non-Indians to take up residence in Indian country and work the land... based on the assumption that Indians would recognize and choose to emulate the virtues of 'civilization' once they had been exposed to them.\\" This method was implemented throughout the entire country. When armed force and colonization failed, \\"the Mexican government used a policy of deportation from tribal homelands to other parts of Mexico.\\" While these methods were devastating to maintaining the identities and communities of Indigenous peoples in Mexico, \\"it was not governmental policy that led to the detribalization and assimilation of most Mexican Indians.\\" While \\"some Indian communities were able to maintain their existence, most were broken up as hundreds of Indians were slowly forced off their land and into Mexican towns, mining communities, and ranches as laborers.\\"Griffin-Pierce 2015, p. 25-26. In 1883, the Mexican government passed the Land Law Act, which \\"affected thousands of small-scale and detribalized Indian communities,\\" as noted by legal scholar Martha Menchaca. A few years after the law's passage, which required \\"all public lands be surveyed for the purpose of development,\\" the ruling class of Mexico and foreign corporations owned approximately \\"one-fifth of Mexico's total land mass, or 68 million acres of land.\\" Once the land was \\"surveyed,\\" \\"Mexican farmers had to prove legal ownership\\" and the courts often \\"upheld the corporations' surveys,\\" which caused \\"many poor farmers... to migrate north into Texas, a task made easier by the railroad infrastructure.\\" The Lerdo Law of 1856, which planned to provide \\"each family... part of the tribe's communal holdings\\" through privatization, had \\"stripped the tribal councils of their legal authority over their community's land,\\" and since Benito Ju√°rez died in the midst of its implementation, judges now \\"held the power to interpret property law and decide to support the surveying companies or recognize that the Lerdo Law had been improperly executed.\\" As a result, \\"Indians who heeded President Ju√°rez's orders and privatized their holdings but failed to disband their tribal councils could argue in court that although they were not given deeds, the Spanish land grant titles [from the colonial period] were still valid since they were not detribalized communities.\\" On the other hand, \\"Indians who had disbanded their councils had no legal recourse because they were detribalized Indians.\\" In the latter case, if detribalized peoples \\"managed not to get evicted from their lands, the main option left was to remain in their homes and become tenant farmers.\\" However, many people \\"chose to join the northern migration\\" and \\"some detribalized Indians began a journey that would eventually transform them into U.S. citizens\\" as a result.Menchaca 2011, p. 91-93. By the end of the nineteenth century, well-over 100,000 Mexicans had migrated north into the southwestern United States, both as a result of the Mexican government's land theft through the Land Law Act and the labor shortage in the United States following the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the unofficial \\"Gentlemen's Agreement\\" with Japan in 1907. As a result, many employers in the southwest opened contracting opportunities in border cities such as El Paso, Texas. Although the official U.S. immigration policy at the time prohibited contractual labor outside the United States, employers hired agents to travel to the interior of Mexico and convince rural and urban Mexican citizens that high wages and new job opportunities were available in the United States. Following the loss of land, low wages, and instability throughout the Mexican countryside, many poor Mexican people, particularly from the states of Jalisco, Guanajuato, Zacatecas, and Michoac√°n, migrated north to initially become railroad workers, laying track for low pay. A 1909 report concluded that Mexican laborers did the majority of the railway work in Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, and southern California. Following the railway work, the majority of Mexican laborers were employed in the agricultural sector, working on cotton fields in Texas, sugar beet farms in northern Colorado, and citrus orchards in California, as well as mines throughout the southwest. By 1920, the number of Mexican immigrants in the United States was over 222,000, the majority of whom had previously been made landless by the Mexican government or worked on rural ranches.Werner 2001, p. 447. This massive land grab in the nineteenth century soon sparked a series of peasant revolts throughout Mexico \\"from the 1840s to the Mexican revolution of 1910.\\" Scholar Florencia Mallon has proposed that, in response, Indigenous communities developed \\"their own popular Liberalism, one that recognized communal institutions and property, and that defined citizenship in terms that did not exclude culturally different groups.\\" In the latter half of the nineteenth century and early twentieth century, with the increasing development of the national capitalist economy and industrialization, \\"Indigenous communities were forced to migrate to the cities\\" and \\"large farms.\\" As a result of that process, many became detribalized as they \\"adopted Spanish as their main language and abandoned their traditional sense of ethnic identity, shifting their allegiance to the national identity being constructed by the [Mexican] state.\\" It was in this process that \\"entire [Indigenous] communities also changed their language, and their ethnic self-identification, from Indian to Mestizo.\\" This is reflective in statistics of the era. While in 1808, Indians and Mestizos were estimated to comprise 60% and 23% of the population respectively, by 1885 this was 38% and 43%, and by 1921 this was 29% and 59%. From 1808 to 1921, it is estimated that approximately 3 million people experienced this cultural and ethnic transformation from Indian to Mestizo, which was about 1/3rd or 1/4th of the entire population of the country at the time.Linares 2009, p. 56-57. In the midst of this detribalization and de-Indianization process in Mexico, the nationalist ideology of \\"mestizaje\\" was formulated \\"by intellectuals closely linked to the State\\" in the late nineteenth century.Linares 2009, p. 58. The Mexican government instituted national policies \\"aimed at achieving the racial and cultural homogenization of the population under the Mestizo category.\\"Linares 2009, p. 53. Mexican nationalist ideologies now asserted that the country was a \\"mestizo society\\" which harmoniously combined the cultures of Indigenous peoples and Europeans. In reality, while the majority of \\"popular classes and sectors,\\" including traditional rural communities and urban barrios, neighborhoods, and towns throughout Mexico, had \\"Indian origins\\" which were \\"often very recent,\\" the \\"upper-class sectors\\" were \\"derived more or less directly from the Spanish colonizers\\" and tended \\"to conserve non-Indian cultural forms.\\" Through mestizaje and Indigenismo, mestizos were \\"supposed to be proud of their Indian 'past', embodied in the massive constructions and the works of art of their Pre-Columbian 'ancestors', while embracing the forward- looking and Modern culture of the White races of the world\\" ‚Äì \\"a process of whitening the Indians, but not of darkening the Whites.\\"Linares 2009, p. 58. Throughout the twentieth century, there remained a concerted effort by the Mexican government to integrate Indigenous people into Mestizo society. This was implemented through Indigenista policies which were meant to \\"foster the dissolution\\" of Indigenous ethnic identities through Westernization. Indigenismo has since been criticized as \\"openly paternalistic.\\"Linares 2009, p. 59-60. In contemporary Mexico, \\"many [Indigenous] cultural traits\\" continue \\"to be present in a de-Indianized collectivity.\\" Bonfil Batalla demonstrates this by examining the comparisons between poor rural and urban mestizos and Indigenous peoples of Mexico.Bonfil Batalla 1996, p. 17-18. Following centuries of colonialism, diverse circumstances were now present: \\"In some areas, Indian enclaves have survived, while in others the original population was annihilated, expelled, or de-Indianized.\\"Bonfil Batalla 1996, p. 42-48. Bonfil Batalla acknowledges the diversity of Indigenous cultures in Mexico while destabilizing the lines between \\"mestizo\\" and \\"Indian\\" by focusing on their cultural similarities and referring to them as non-monolithic categories. While acknowledging the diversity of \\"mestizo\\" and \\"Indian\\" realities, Bonfil Batalla also emphasizes the \\"fundamental, determining characteristics\\" present throughout Mesoamerican culturesBonfil Batalla 1996, p. 39. to demonstrate how there is an \\"effective presence of that which is Indian... in almost every social and cultural aspect of the country,\\" that \\"the presence of Indian culture is, in some aspects, so commonplace and omnipresent that one rarely stops to think about its profound significance, or about the long historical process that made possible its persistence in social sectors that assume a non-Indian identity today.\\"Bonfil Batalla 1996, p. 41. Members of the privileged elite classes in contemporary Mexico, who are largely descendants of European colonizers have been noted to still regard \\"anything that is Indian, any trait that recalls the original ancestry of Mexican culture and society\\" as backward, grotesque, and inferior, by using derogatory and racist language such as \\"naco.\\"Bonfil Batalla 1996, p. 52-53. There remains \\"many Mestizos living in traditional peasant communities whose culture is closer to that of the Indigenous peoples than to that of the modernized urban elites, despite the fact that they no longer speak an Indian language.\\" This segment of the population \\"could very well 're-Indianze' itself\\" and in many communities throughout Mexico \\"such processes of re- Indianization are already well under way.\\"Linares 2009, p. 61. In 2000, the ethnic composition of Mexico was recorded as 18% Amerindian, 10.5% of which openly identified as detribalized. There is also evidence that increasing numbers of the detribalized Mexican population may be openly identifying as Indigenous, given the rapid increase in population size in recent national census figures.  Peru  De-Indianization has been cited as an essential element to the formation of the colonial Peruvian nation-state, \\"which was and in many ways continues to premised on the overcoming of indigeneity, that is to say on the de-Indianization of Peru.\\"Drinot 2011, p. 15. Indigenous peoples in Peru could therefore be \\"redeemed\\" through the process of de-Indianization or assimilation into the colonial order of Western \\"progress.\\"Drinot 2011, p. 224. De-Indianization was implemented through various efforts of the state, such as through \\"education,\\" yet \\"those who did not de-Indianize, because they refused to do so or because resources to implement the process of de- Indianization were lacking, could be, and indeed came to be seen as in need of being, erased from the purview of the nation-state. This historical marginalization of the indigenous, in this sense, is best understood not as a lack of or failure of the Peruvian nation-state, but as its necessary and constitutive condition.\\"Drinot 2011, p. 237-238.  United States  = Northeastern = In the seventeenth century, detribalization was implemented against Indigenous communities in the northeastern region of the Thirteen Colonies in order to strengthen the English colonial position. As historian Helen C. Rountree documents, \\"the English wished to detribalize the Powhatans\\" and implemented various methods to \\"civilize\\" them and otherwise incorporate detribalized persons into colonial society. Until 1691, detribalized Indigenous people could \\"enter the middle- or lower- levels of English society\\" through interracial marriage. Following the prohibition of interracial marriage, \\"Indians were expected to join the lowest, non-white ranks.\\" There is evidence that an Indigenous person who was perceived as detribalized had greater claims to land rights, exemplified via the case of Edward Gunstocker, whose land rights were perceived as valid by American colonial courts because he was detribalized.Rountree 1996, p. 135-136. By the second half of the seventeenth century, the English in the Virginia colony attempted to \\"convert the Powhatans culturally\\" through permitting them to engage in a form of waged labor under the watchful eyes of English employers with the intention of \\"civilizing them and making them Christians.\\" Indigenous children were also taken from parents to become \\"servants\\" for the English, who assured parents that they would be treated well and not as slaves. However, as noted by Rountree, \\"the English did not draw a clear distinction between 'servants' (i.e., domestic employees) and slaves, either for Indians or for Africans.\\" While few Indigenous people accepted these offers willingly in the early part of the seventeenth century, pressures from colonists increased, especially after Indigenous people were progressively impoverished following the stealing of land and effects of the emerging colonial economic system. Detribalization was used by the state governments in the northeastern region of Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island in the nineteenth century to refer to the deliberate process of terminating relationships between Indigenous peoples and their Indian nations in the debate over federal recognition. At the time, the process of detribalization \\"carried the notion of 'liberating' Indians from the perceived shackles of tribalism.\\"Den Ouden and O'Brien 2013, p. 149. In 1889, the state of New York published a report of a \\"special committee\\" which \\"asked for a solution of the 'Indian problem' from men living in nearly every section of the state.\\" In answer to the question \\"What can be done for the good of the Indian?\\" relating to the Onondaga, the consensus was determined as follows: \\"exterminate the tribe and preserve the individual; make citizens of them and divide their lands in severalty.\\" Chancellor of Syracuse University Charles N. Sims replied: \\"Obliterate the whole tribe; make them citizens; divide all the lands among them and put them under the laws of citizenship in the State. It is the merest farce in the world to treat them as a nation.\\" Dr. Johnathan Kneelant of Syracuse, who was for several years a physician to the tribe said: \\"I have recommended that they be detribalized and made citizens.\\" Much of the responses throughout the report indicate similar attitudes towards various Indigenous nations throughout the state of New York. This rhetoric indicates how detribalization was perceived as unquestionably necessary for the progress of the American settler colony by colonizers. = Southwestern = Taos Pueblo in New Mexico. The Spanish colonial period began under Jose de Onate in 1598, who inflicted atrocities on Acoma Pueblo, killing \\"hundreds of Acomas, and burned houses and kivas.\\" Ongoing resistance by Pueblo religious leaders propelled the Spanish to use missionaries in order to \\"convert the Indians to Catholicism\\" and thus encourage them to disidentify from their Pueblo community and cultural practices. Historians Deborah Lawrence and Jon Lawrence note that a new \\"form of slavery developed whereby Indians who were obtained by Hispanics through war or trade were taken into Spanish households as servants.\\" These \\"detribalized Indian captives\\" were referred to as gen√≠zaros and eventually \\"managed to merge into the larger society over generations.\\"Lawrence and Lawrence 2016, p. 67. In the eighteenth century, the population of detribalized people in New Mexico increased, particularly of the gen√≠zaros, who were now commonly held in servitude throughout before being released upon Christianization or adulthood. This increase was largely due to the prevailing \\"trade of human captives\\" which was carried out throughout the region. As noted by historian Lisbeth Haas, the Spanish had \\"granted gen√≠zaros and lower-status settlers land throughout the eighteenth century in order to create buffer zones between nomadic raiding and the colonial towns, including those of Pueblo Indians, such as Santo Domingo and Ysleta.\\" Neighboring tribes including the Navajo and Comanche participated in the servant and slave trade of detribalized people and others at trade fairs in Abiquiu and Taos Pueblo until the mid-nineteenth century.Haas 2014, p. 174. Following the Mexican- American War and the ratification of the Treaty of Guadalupe, the U.S. government quickly violated its agreement and failed to acknowledge the citizenship stipulation it had agreed to under the treaty. As noted by scholar Martha Menchaca, the U.S. government instead began a process of racialization which ascribed to Mexicans different legal rights on the basis of race.\\" While \\"Mexicans who were white were given full citizenship,\\" mestizos, Christianized Indians, and afromexicanos (mixed race people of African descent) were accorded inferior legal rights.\\" While prior to the Mexican-American War, \\"Mexico had extended citizenship to all people living in Mexican territory irrespective of race,\\" including the \\"right to vote, run for office, enter any profession, transact business with whomever one chose, marry freely with no racial restrictions, and obtain title to land grants,\\" following American occupation, a new racial system was imposed upon the conquered territories of the Southwest.Menchaca 2011, p. 19-20. The federal government provided the various state governments of the ceded territories \\"the right to decide which Mexicans would be given citizenship.\\" In Texas, citizenship was only extended to Mexicans \\"as long as they were not of black descent.\\" At the same time, \\"detribalized Christian Indians who paid taxes and had adopted the lifestyle of Mexicans were also given citizenship but with limited rights,\\" being excluded from the right to vote, and conditional property rights, only \\"if they could prove that they spoke Spanish and that their ancestors had been legally emancipated from the Spanish missions.\\" However, while the Mexican- controlled New Mexico legislature (which had authority over the territory of Arizona at the time) \\"extended citizenship to all former citizens of Mexico\\" in 1851, the United States congress quickly \\"rescinded this decree\\" and denied Black and Indigenous people citizenship in 1853. Soon after Arizona was established as a separate entity in 1863, \\"its first legislative assembly voted to reserve citizenship for white males.\\" When deciding whether to grant Mexicans of mestizo ancestry rights afforded to white or Indigenous peoples, \\"most government officials argued that Mexicans of predominately Indian descent should be extended the same legal status as the detribalized American Indians.\\" Anglo-American legislatures disenfranchised many Mexican people throughout the Southwest by arguing that they were of Indigenous descent and should therefore not be granted the rights and privileges of white American citizens.Menchaca 1998, p. 388. People of Indigenous descent were also discriminated against based on their affiliations, as \\"Spanish-speaking mestizos who resided in the main colonial towns\\" were \\"assumed to be Mexican,\\" making them \\"exempt from Indian policies.\\" Indigenous groups who managed to not be displaced or \\"subdued by the Spanish and Mexican governments were placed on reservations or forcibly driven out of the Southwest\\" by American settlers and the military. If any Indigenous people refused to submit to the American occupiers, they would be \\"politically-labeled [as] warlike\\" which could serve as a justification for their imprisonment or military attack by state forces. Those groups who were considered peaceful \\"were visited by an agent of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to determine if they should be extended the legal rights of Mexican mestizos\\" in central colonial settlements. Ultimately, the BIA granted these rights to \\"the Coahuiltecan and Apache in Texas, the Pueblos in New Mexico, Pima Indians of the Santa Cruz and San Pedro valleys in Arizona, and Chumash, Garbieleno, Luiseno, and groups of Yuma Indians in California.\\"Menchaca 2011, p. 20-21. > Once the legislature had made their decisions, many Indian villages were > relocated onto reservations and some were allowed to remain in their village > with their property respected (e.g. the Pueblo), but the majority had their > lands confiscated and were forced to move. Individuals who were detribalized > and lived among the Mexicans but were culturally identifiable as Indian were > ordered by the federal government to be counted among the peaceful Indian > populations.... The legislatures were given the power to determine if > detribalized Indians were to be granted the political rights of Mexican > mestizos. Aside from the Pueblos of New Mexico, \\"most Indians living in former Mexican municipalities lost their property to the U.S. government.\\" Those who were classified as Mexican under American occupation also \\"did not have to fear being placed on reservations or being subject to punitive laws like those passed in some states.\\" As a result, this issue of being identified as either Indian or Mexican by the American government was important; \\"whereas Indians benefited from being legally classified as Mexican, it was politically dangerous for Mexicans to be considered Indian.\\" = In Asia =  Central Asia  Kazakh family inside a alt= In the latter half of the nineteenth century, the Russian Empire began colonizing the Central Asian steppe and the nomadic Indigenous Kazakhs of the region. With the \\"final Tsarist conquest of the 'Kazakh' steppe, and the abolishment of serfdom in the Empire in 1861,\\" the scale of \\"Russian peasant migration into northern Central Asia increased dramatically.\\" Newly emancipated Russian and Ukrainian Slavic serfs sought territory in Siberia and Central Asia in hopes \\"of acquiring a free plot of land\\" to escape their previous condition of \\"extreme poverty and starvation.\\" Upper class Tsarist officials sought to prevent this migration, \\"concerned with a possible decrease in the labour force in European Russia,\\" but did so with little success. By the 1890s, in order to alleviate \\"rising peasant unrest\\" in European Russian cities such as St. Petersburg, officials encouraged \\"hundreds of thousands of Slavic peasants to resettle in Central Asia, especially on the territories of present-day Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.\\"Ubiria 2015, p. 58. In the 1890s and early 1900s, the Russian Empire sent \\"several government commissions\\" to survey the \\"quantity of arable land\\" for \\"prospective settlers,\\" which concluded that \\"the steppe nomads possessed surplus land, which could be allocated to Slavic settlers.\\" The \\"appropriation of 'Kazakh' surplus land\\" was perceived by officials as \\"legally justifiable\\" following \\"the 'Kazakh' Khans submission to the Russian throne\\" which transferred control over their land to \\"the property of the Russian monarch.\\" The migration of Slavic settlers into Central Asia peaked between 1906 and 1912, \\"when approximately 1.5 million new Slav migrants poured into the region.\\" By 1916, it was estimated that there were 3 million European settlers in the region. Since settlers were privileged by the Russian Empire, they were \\"given larger and more fertile tracts of land\\" while \\"farming plots allocated to [Kazakhs] were often useless for cultivation.\\" The loss of access to the fertile lands was \\"a devastating blow to the 'Kazakh' nomadic economy\\" and forced many Kazakhs \\"to adapt to the sedentary lifestyle, or to move southward in search of new grazing lands for their herds.\\"Ubiria 2015, p. 58-59. However, \\"the sedentarization of some 'Kazakhs' ... did not always necessarily lead to their detribalization, since most of the newly established 'Kazakh' villages were settled by ex-nomads deriving from the same clan and tribal origin.\\" As such, many Kazakhs were able to retain their immediate clan and tribal identities. At the same time, the \\"pan-horde identities,\\" which had previously existed prior to Russian colonization, were \\"significantly weakened with the abolition of the hordes, since no alternative institution remained to sustain them.\\" Overall, the influx of Slavic settlers changed \\"the demographic structure of the region,\\" resulting in the \\"emergence of two broad and distinct cultural groups,\\" the Slavic settlers who were \\"primarily followers of the Orthodox Christian faith\\" and the Muslim Kazakhs, which included both \\"pastoral nomads and newly sedentarized farmers\\" and the related Kyrgyz and Karakalpak ethnic groups, who were speakers of Kazakh dialects and \\"physically exhibit[ed] Mongoloid features.\\"Ubiria 2015, p. 59. Tsarist colonial policies \\"privileged the Slavic settlers over the steppe nomads\\" and segregated the Kazakhs and other steppe peoples as \\"belonging to the inferior inorodtsy [\\"allogeneous\\"] category.\\" This exacerbated sociocultural tensions between the two groups, as the Slav population became viewed as \\"agents of the Tsarist colonialism, and hence equally responsible for their socio-economic problems.\\" These tensions and oppression by the Russian Empire eventually culminated in the 1916 revolt in Central Asia.Ubiria 2015, p. 59-60. Following the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Kazakhs were widely dispersed and had been \\"battered in the civil war\\" with the Slavic settlers which had preceded \\"the establishment of Bolshevik control.\\" The \\"surviving clans, villages, and auls (migratory groups) reconstituted themselves as Soviets and tried to carry on as before,\\" although new policies were quickly imposed upon them.Findley 2004, p. 192. Similar to European colonial efforts in Africa, Soviet nationality policy initially \\"emphasized 'indigenization' of the institutions of local government.\\" However, while in Africa, European powers instituted these policies to prevent working-class consciousness and to control the majority of Africans as peasant laborers for their empires, the fundamental purpose of Soviet indigenization policies were \\"precisely the opposite of the European policy of colonial indigenization in Africa.\\" In this sense, \\"Soviet policy was not designed to preserve 'traditional' content, but to replace it.\\" The goal was not to ensure that a \\"good Uzbek\\" remained a \\"good Uzbek,\\" as European powers had believed of the \\"good African,\\" but to \\"make him a good 'European' in the sense that Europeans were modern and most Uzbeks were not.\\" As a result of this Soviet ideology toward the colonized peoples of Central Asia, \\"plenty of smashing of traditional institutions was done by the Soviet state in the name of socialist transformation,\\" which resulted in detribalization.Blitstein 2006, p. 288. This was done through education policies, which were implemented through a \\"universal Soviet curriculum\\" instituted in the same manner \\"regardless of the pupil's ethnic identity.\\" The \\"economic and political logic\\" of this curriculum was to create \\"a loyal, modern, interchangeable population suitable for rapid industrial development.\\" While colonial governmental policy in Africa did not seek to employ a \\"civilizing mission\\" for fear of creating an urbanized \\"detribalized\\" population of workers who may rebel against the colonial order, the Soviets attempted to \\"ultimately transform and integrate all peoples into one political community.\\" Progress was notably perceived as slow by the Soviets in Central Asia, as \\"Stalinist authorities consistently bemoaned the slow process of working-class formation among the Central Asian peoples\\" and \\"relatively low numbers of Central Asians in institutions of higher education in the late 1930s and 1940s\\" was a \\"sore point for a regime preoccupied with training 'nationality cadres.'\\" By the \\"mid-to-late 1930s,\\" the Soviets had abandoned these nationality policies as a response to \\"Russian resentment and rising non-Russian nationalism, itself a consequence of the indigenization policies.\\" This resulted in new policies which asserted \\"the reemergence of the Russians\\" and curtailed the usage of \\"non-Russian languages in administration\\" while simultaneously increasing \\"repression of ethnic diasporas and the adoption of mandatory Russian-language instruction,\\" exemplifying how \\"new elements in Soviet nationality policy moved in the direction along the lines of its neighbors to the west\\" during the interwar period. Resistance to these new policies emerged \\"in Polish and German villages in Ukrainian and Belorussian border regions and [the Soviets] took violent measures against those communities,\\" such as through \\"selective deportation targeting entire villages of Germans and Poles\\"; the \\"deportation of the Soviet Korean population to Central Asia would soon follow.\\"Blitstein 2006, p. 288-289. Following decades of Soviet control in the twentieth century, \\"the party had still failed to undermine indigenous religious and clan authority\\" throughout much of Central Asia. While other \\"Turkic nationalities emerged through a processes of detribalization [over centuries], the modern Kazakhs emerged instead through expansion and adaptation\\" under the weight of external authority. = In the Middle East =  Jordan  The tribal groups of Transjordan were detribalized in the 20th century after Emir Abdallah, who had a political alliance with the British, assumed power. During the construction of the Hijaz Railway, \\"the tribes in the area refused to pay taxes or to contribute conscripts to the army, and at times, came out in open rebellion against central authorities.\\" The alliance \\"brought political recognition\\" to Abdallah's regime and \\"helped in detribalization\\" of the region through colonial military control: \\"to centralize authority, Transjordan had to create a viable bureaucracy and army, build infrastructure, quell internal revolts, repel external aggression, and detribalize the desert.\\"Piro 1998, p. 95.  Saudi Arabia  As an extension of European colonialism and Westernization, towns and urban centers in Saudi Arabia housed two different worlds, in which \\"the 'native' town exists alongside a 'Western' town.\\" In former colonies throughout the greater Middle East, a second colonial city was often simply constructed next to the \\"old town\\" as part of the colonial order. Cities in Saudi Arabia such as Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam exemplified this type of colonial configuration in the 20th century. Westerners segregated themselves from those in the \\"native\\" town centers and lived together \\"in more or less discreet and hermetically sealed compounds.\\" It was in this urbanized setting that \\"the modernization and individualization of Saudi society unfolded\\" at a rapid pace, which broke down \\"traditional social structures\\" and \\"served to detribalize society, to make the family cell its basic unit, and finally to split the family itself into conjugal micro- elements.\\" The unification of Saudi Arabia, \\"was in every respect not only a victory of town over desert but a victory of the family over the tribe.\\" The increasing \\"urbanization of Arabia therefore also corresponded to a sedentarization or detribalization of the nomads,\\" accompanied by the Western family-centered model. Many nomadic families soon after became \\"detached from their tribal history and sense of belonging.\\"M√©noret 2005, p. 160-162. = In Oceania =  Australia  Postcard showing a group of Aboriginal women in European dress at Maloga Mission, Qld 1900 In 1788, there was estimated to be approximately 251,000 Indigenous Australians (including Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islander people) in what is now referred to in the Western context as Australia. By 1901, it was estimated that the population had declined to 67,000 as a result of European diseases, invasion and occupation. Indigenous groups which had survived were \\"either institutionalized on government or mission settlements or allowed to form camps on the fringes of upcountry towns, pastoral properties, farms, and mines, which were usually tucked away well out of sight of the busier centers of colonial life.\\" By the 1880s, \\"the European populace became predominantly urban\\", which increasingly divided most European settlers from the Indigenous people.Stanner 2011, p. 151-152. Racist perceptions of the Indigenous people were rampant throughout the European Australian population by the end of the nineteenth century as \\"derision and contempt expressed in the mid-century years deepened toward a malevolent vilification\\". A member of the South Australian parliament who perceived \\"the detribalized Aborigines of Port Darwin in 1882 as 'degraded specimens of humanity... some less manlike than a griming and chattering monkey....' and questioned '...whether, on the whole, any beings bearing the semblance of humanity could be found more low-sunk than these...' may be bracketed with the member of the new Commonwealth Parliament in 1902 who said: 'There is no scientific evidence that [the Aboriginal] is a human being at all'\\". In 1937, the Australian government held the first ever meeting of the state's leaders in \\"Aboriginal Affairs\\" in which they reportedly \\"recognized the needs of part-Aborigines but not those of the full bloods\\". They issued a recommendation \\"that 'half-castes', as they were called, should be educated for employment at white standards so as to facilitate their absorption into the Australian populace\\", while suggesting that people of \\"full blood\\" be \\"categorized as 'detribalized,' 'semicivilized,' and 'uncivilized'\\". Those who were categorized as \\"semicivilized\\" and \\"uncivilized\\" were deemed to be unfit for integration into colonial society without detribalization. For the \\"semicivilized\\" and \\"uncivilized\\", the Australian government \\"appeared to favor something like apartheid in inviolable reserves as an appropriate way of dealing with [them] but suggested that this should be done as far as possible without damage to the needs of employers of Aboriginal labor\\". Those deemed \\"uncivilized\\" were \\"to be left alone until progress had been made with the semicivilized and detribalized categories\\".Stanner 2011, p. 158. > In the vicinity of such places of employment it is proposed to provide > reserves where unemployed aborigines will be more or less maintained under > tribal conditions by those in employment, and whither, during periods of > unemployment, those who have been employed may retire. The purpose of these > reserves is to provide the aborigines with the means of continuing their > present state of existence‚Äîa semi-tribal life‚Äîbut the ultimate intention is > that they shall be brought under the same control as is now proposed for > those who are regarded as detribalized. In the vicinity of the white > settlements, it is proposed that the detribalized aborigines shall be > educated and trained in various avocations, in which they can make a living > without competing with the whites. This practice was instituted with the underlying assumption \\"that Aboriginal culture had collapsed, or would soon do so everywhere, and that assimilation into a European mode of life was the one rational possibility\\". Australian colonial authorities believed the Indigenous population \\"should be trained for a settled life and useful occupation; taught to recognize authority, law, and the rights of property; given religious training to 'replace the stability of character which has been lost by the destruction of their ancient philosophy and moral code'\\". During this 1937 meeting, a resolution known as the Destiny of the Race was passed, which stated, that ‚Äúthis conference believes that the destiny of the natives of aboriginal origin, but not of the full blood, lies in their ultimate absorption by the people of the Commonwealth and it therefore recommends that all efforts be directed to that end‚Äù.Schimmel 2005, p. 37. Section 71 of the Welfare Ordinance of 1953 stated that ‚Äúa person who has the control or management of ward‚Äù shall not fail ‚Äúto provide the ward with reasonable food, shelter, clothing, and facilities for hygiene‚Äù. However, what was constituted as \\"reasonable\\" was \\"governed by delegated legislation and influenced by the ideology of assimilation\\". As a result, \\"reasonable\\" was meant to \\"inevitably reflect a nuclear family structure\\". This preference was made \\"evident in the reports of [Australian] Patrol Officers.\\" Scholars have since argued that \\"assigning nuclear family names\\" was \\"a means of ‚Äòdetribalizing‚Äô indigenous Australians at this time\\". Until 1970, Indigenous Australian children were forcibly removed from their families and communities throughout Australia and became part of the Stolen Generations. In a 1980 study on European-Australian and Indigenous Australian relations in Western Australia, Kenneth Liberman reflects on how European-Australian settlers imposed their standards of \\"morality\\" onto Indigenous Australians, with \\"the implicit attitude that the best thing which European society could do for Aboriginals was to make Europeans of them\\". According to Australian anthropologist A. P. Elkin, \\"European society was endeavoring to turn Aboriginal people into individualists\\" by teaching them the \\"moral value of work\\". He notes how European-Australian pastoralists forced \\"Aboriginals living on their stations to perform some sort of token labor before they hand them their government social welfare check,\\" viewed Indigenous children as undisciplined, and perceived their ownership over the land as justifiable based on their alleged superior morality. At the time, \\"the former national Minister of the Interior argued... that it was not only impossible to accept Aboriginal land claims but that it was 'wholly wrong'\\".Liberman 1980, p. 127-128. In a Ted Talk, Stolen Generations survivor Sheila Humphries spoke of being stolen from her parents, the torture and abuse by the nuns who managed the orphanage where she was detained, and the attempts by police officers and doctors to steal her own children from her years later: \\"My mother was taken, I was taken, they wanted to take my twins\\". In recalling her relationship to her mother, Humphries reflects on the disturbing realities of this era of Australian history which produced cross-generational detachment, trauma, and loss of familial and communal structures for Indigenous people: > I woke up one morning, two o'clock in the morning, sobbing my heart out, and > my late husband said to me, \\"What's the matter?\\" All I could say to him at > that time was, \\"I want my mommy. I want my mommy.\\" He said, \\"I'll tell you > what, [...] I'll take you back tomorrow and we'll go and visit her grave\\". > So, we went back the next day, and it was like I was going to a funeral for > the first time in my life. A mother whose name I didn't know, until 30 years > later. I found out her real name. Mother darling had nine different names. > She was placed in so many institutions, baptized into so many religions, and > given so many names.  Retribalization  Retribalization has been used as a term to contextualize the re-identification, reclamation, reconnection, and reintegration of \\"detribalized\\" persons with an Indigenous identity or community of ancestral origin. As many people throughout the world have been detached through the historical and contemporary efforts of colonizers and the effects of colonialism, the current role and relationship of detribalized peoples as they relate to their communities of origin is complex. Reconnection with Indigenous knowledge systems can be an important element \\"for Indigenous or detribalized people who were interrupted from the knowledge contained within\\" their culture(s) of origin.Gonzalez 2012, p. 87. Central to this relationship is protecting traditional ways of being, since \\"what distinguishes the Indigenous struggle for self-determination from others is their collective effort to protect the rights of their peoples to live in accordance with traditional ways.\\" Indigenous communities simultaneously \\"resist the kind of essentialism that recognizes only one way of being\\" while also working \\"to retain a vast constellation of distinct traditions that serve as the defining characteristics of tribal life.\\" Therefore, \\"regardless of how any individual Indigenous person chooses\\" to live their life, it is known in Indigenous communities that \\"they are responsible for protecting the right to live according to ancestral ways,\\" since, according to scholars such as Vine Deloria Jr., it has been \\"the allegiance to traditional knowledge that has protected American Indians from annihilation and absorption in the democratic mainstream.\\"Grande 2015, p. 240. > This connection to \\"tradition\\" determines that while the project of > decolonization requires the histories and experiences of nontribal, > detribalized, and \\"mixed-blood\\" peoples to be theorized as an integral part > of the Indigenous diaspora, it must also operate to sustain and reinvigorate > the life-ways of tribal peoples still among us. Particularly in this time > when the dominant patterns of belief and practice are being widely > recognized as integrally related to the cultural and ecological crises, the > need for understanding and sustaining other cultural patterns is essential. = Chicanxs and Mexican-Americans = Chicanxs (gender-neutral variant of Chicano/a) and Mexican-Americans who are \\"descendants of the original peoples,\\" or Indigenous peoples of Mexico, have been described as belonging among \\"detribalized Indigenous peoples and communities.\\"Gonzalez 2012, p. xxv. Chicanx people, many of whom are mixed-race, have also been described as de- Indigenized as a result of their displacement from maiz-based cultures throughout the greater Mesoamerican region.Rodr√≠guez 2014, p. 8-9. Rather than existing as a \\"subculture\\" of American mainstream culture, Chicanx culture has been positioned by Alicia Gasper de Alba as an \\"alter-Native culture, an Other American culture indigenous to the land base now known as the West and Southwest of the United States.\\" While influenced by settler-imposed systems and structures, Chicanx culture is referred to as \\"not immigrant but native, not foreign but colonized, not alien but different from the overarching hegemony of white America.\\"Gasper De Alba 2002, p. xxi. Gloria E. Anzald√∫a has addressed detribalization, stating \\"In the case of Chicanos, being 'Mexican' is not a tribe. So in a sense Chicanos and Mexicans are 'detribalized'. We don't have tribal affiliations but neither do we have to carry ID cards establishing tribal affiliation.\\" Anzald√∫a also recognizes that \\"Chicanos, people of color, and 'whites',\\" have often chosen \\"to ignore the struggles of Native people even when it's right in our caras (faces),\\" expressing disdain for this \\"willful ignorance.\\" She concludes that \\"though both 'detribalized urban mixed bloods' and Chicanas/os are recovering and reclaiming, this society is killing off urban mixed bloods through cultural genocide, by not allowing them equal opportunities for better jobs, schooling, and health care.\\"Anzald√∫a 2009, p. 289-290. In regard to combating the effects of American mainstream culture on detribalized Indigenous and Chicanx gender and sexuality constructs, Gabriel S. Estrada has discussed how \\"the overarching structures of capitalist white (hetero)sexism,\\" including higher levels of criminalization directed toward Chicanos, has proliferated \\"further homophobia as Mexican Indian youth increasingly battle the myths and realities of rape by adopting hypermasculine personas that can include sexual violence directed at others.\\" Not only does this constrict \\"the formation of a balanced Indigenous sexuality for anyone[,] but especially... for those who do identify themselves as gay, queer, joto, bisexual, [or] two-spiritied, [etc.]\\" to reject the \\"Judeo-Christian mandates against homosexuality that are not native to their own ways,\\" recognizing that many precolonial Indigenous societies accepted homosexuality openly.Estrada 2002, p. 43. Roberto Cintli Rodr√≠guez questions how and why \\"peoples who are clearly red or brown and undeniably Indigenous to this continent have allowed ourselves, historically, to be framed by beaurecrats and the courts, by politicians, scholars, and the media as alien, illegal, and less than human.\\"Rodr√≠guez 2014, p. xx-xxi. Academic In√©s Hern√°ndez-√Åvila has reflected on the potential for Chicanx people to reconnect with their ancestry as a source of power for creating global change: \\"The day each mestiza/mestizo truly searches for and finds her/his roots, respectfully and humbly, and furthermore validates those peoples who still maintain their identity as original peoples of this continent of America, North, Central, and South- on that day we will be radical and much more capable of transforming our world, our universe, and our lives.\\"Estrada 2002, p. 55. = Native Americans = Leech Lake Tribal College American Indian boarding schools, which were operational throughout the United States from the late nineteenth century until 1973, attempted to compel detribalization by forcibly instructing Indigenous children to abandon their \\"tribal languages and traditions,\\" which resulted in cross-generational trauma and detachment from community;Leforestier 2016, p. 59-61. \\"detribalization was achieved in many ways like cutting the children's hair, giving them clothes typically worn by white people, forbidding them to speak their native languae, giving them a new American name, and, most of all, requiring them to speak English only.\\"Leforestier 2016, p. 66. Since \\"the relationship between parents and children was often broken because of long separation\\" forced upon Indigenous families, so was the \\"transmission of cultural and traditional knowledge.\\" However, while the boarding schools were undeniably detrimental to Native Americans, their efforts to assimilate and erase tribal identities through forced \\"education\\" were unfulfilled, since \\"instead of replacing their students' Indian identity with an American one as planned, the schools reinforced it while creating a pan-Indian identity alongside other tribal identities.\\" The emergence of pan-Indianism as an effect of the off- reservation boarding schools unified Native American resistance to colonialism and served as an important \\"tool for future unity and cohesion among Indians.\\" Native Americans have since resisted further detribalization through the institution of tribal colleges and vocational education programs which do not adopt \\"an assimilationist or a detribalization approach\\" but rather function in encouraging \\"revitalization, as a retribalization process serving Indian communities and their members.\\" Retribalization may function as a means of perpetuating \\"the development, and the revitalization of tribal linguistic and cultural specificities through educational programs.\\" Education at tribal colleges has meant that Native Americans are able to retribalize by learning \\"about their culture and reacquire their tribal identity, which had been lost, repressed, or put aside\\" while also reconnecting with their communities of origin.Leforestier 2016, p. 66-67. Urban Native Americans have been increasingly re-identifying with their nation(s) of origin as a form of empowerment and self-understanding. Transferring from a \\"generic\\" or pan- Indian identification to their tribal identification of origin encapsulates this process; In this instance, \\"Indian identity\\" may operate as a \\"necessary antecedent\\" to \\"tribal identity and involvement.\\" It is common in \\"urban Indian communities\\" to take an ideological path \\"from anomie to community and from community to tribe.\\" In this sense and in the contemporary context, \\"Indian people growing up in a city, always aware and respectful of tribal affiliation, may look first to a positive Indian identity, supported by connection with Indian organizations and community, and, from that base, move forward to a real connection with a tribe, often selecting among the several which comprise their heritage.\\"Straus and Valentino 1998, p. 103-115. = \\"Ethnic Fraud\\" controversy = In the United States, primarily white European Americans have claimed distant, usually, Cherokee ancestry, despite nonexistent, uncertain, or \\"thin\\" connections, sometimes via Cherokee heritage groups, which has been a subject of controversy. As scholar Kim TallBear notes, the tribal or ethnic groups which are often targeted by \\"race shifters\\" or \\"whites seeking Native American identity\\" are those which have acknowledged \\"histories of extensive 'admixture,' as geneticists would call it, with non- Native peoples,\\" which has left these groups vulnerable \\"because 'Cherokeenees seems open to whiteness in ways that Navajoness [for example] does not. ... Cherokeeness is an ideal destination for race-shifting because the tribe has a history of cultural adoption, tribal exogamy, and relatively open standards of tribal citizenship.'\\"TallBear 2013, p. 132-133. The \\"Cherokee princess\\" phenomenon exemplifies an aspect of this form of ethnic fraud. Lakota journalist Tim Giago has humorously reflected on this matter as follows: > Good heavens! We (Indians) have heard it so many times in our lives. A white > man or woman approaches (this usually happens after I have given a speech) > and says, \\"My great grandmother was a Cherokee princess.\\" Never a Cherokee > prince, but always a princess. I suppose that is because none of these > descendants of royalty wish to admit that their great grandmothers had an > affair with a Cherokee male. Heaven forbid that a nice young white lady > would ever cast an eye about an Indian man.Justice 2006, p. 222. Because of federally-imposed qualifications of tribal enrollment, in the form of blood-quantum laws, tribal citizenship since the 20th century has been complicated by \\"dominant cultural notions of race,\\" which have \\"pushed or been pushed against tribal peoples' own ideas of belonging and citizenship.\\"TallBear 2013, p. 63-64. DNA tests or \\"genetic-ancestry tests\\" are increasingly becoming an issue for tribes as well. In 2010, several tribes reported at a \\"national tribal enrollment conference\\" that \\"they had received enrollment applications with commercially purchased genetic-ancestry test results included,\\" despite the fact that \\"federally recognized tribes do not accept genetic-ancestry results as appropriate documentation for enrollment and do not advise applicants to submit such documentation.\\"TallBear 2013, p. 65-66. Some individuals have used DNA tests in this manner to claim minority status in the United States for their own personal benefit. There is \\"anecdotal evidence\\" that some \\"applicants to Ivy League and other top-ranked schools who want an affirmative-action leg up in competitive admissions processes have used DNA tests to back up their personal decisions to self- identify as racial or ethnic minorities.\\"TallBear 2013, p. 68. In 2019, \\"contractors with white ancestry got $300 million\\" for claiming to be Cherokee despite nonexistent evidence supporting their claims. \\"12 of the 14 business owners involved claimed membership in one of three self-described Cherokee groups,\\" the Northern Cherokee Nation, the Western Cherokee Nation of Arkansas and Missouri, and the Northern Cherokee Nation of the Old Louisiana Territory, all of which remain federally unrecognized and openly opposed by the Cherokee Nation and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians as fraudulent. As a result, \\"tribal communities sometimes feel they are under assault by people with tenuous or nonexistent connections to their communities yet who want access to cultural knowledge or to cultural sites for personal identity exploration and sometimes for profit.\\" Some have called for \\"a more 'decolonized' tribal enrollment based on social- and cultural-competence criteria (such as doing community service on reservations or in historic homelands; knowing the tribal history, culture, and politics; knowing the tribal language; taking an oath of allegiance to the tribal nation; and proving that one is of 'good character according to the tribe's traditional code of morality'), used alone or in conjunction with more liberal blood rules.\\" However, these solutions have also been criticized by some as \\"overly idealistic\\" ‚Äì \\"the fear is that the floodgates would fly open with the possibility of cultural conversion.\\"TallBear 2013, p. 60-61.

This attempt, however, was thwarted by awful weather conditions and the mountain remained unclimbed until July 2003 when four alpinists led by Dennis Schmitt were able to reach the highest point of the range from the Moore Glacier.North America, Greenland, The Far North, Jensenland, Explorations of Most Northerly Land Geography The Daly Range is the easternmost subrange of the Roosevelt Range.

Reed was born in November 1895 at Malmesbury, Wiltshire. He began serving in the Royal Navy in July 1913 as a clerk, before becoming a paymaster. He was serving as a sub lieutenant assistant-paymaster in December 1917. He made a single appearance in first- class cricket for the Royal Navy against the British Army cricket team at Lord's in 1921. Batting twice in the match, Reed ended the Royal Navy first- innings not out on 8, while in their second-innings he was dismissed without scoring by Tom Jameson. He took a single wicket in the match, dismissing Francis Brooke in the Army's first-innings, finishing with match figures of 1 for 83. He made his debut in minor counties cricket for Wiltshire against Dorset in the 1921 Minor Counties Championship, and made three further appearances in 1923. He was promoted from the rank of lieutenant commander to paymaster commander in January 1935, retaining that rank until at least August 1939. He died in October 1968 at Wroughton, Wiltshire.

The high demand for the scarce strategic mineral in war time had created a bubble in prices, with otherwise desolate Post-Civil War Spanish economy heftily profiting from it, as its income from Wolfram exports had increased from ¬£73,000 in 1940 to ¬£15.7 million in 1943. Wolfram exports accounted for nearly 1% of the Spanish GDP and 20% of the exports by 1943‚Äì44. On 18 November 1943 the US Ambassador to Spain delivered a memorandum to the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs demanding for the unconditional end to Wolfram exports to Germany. After the repeated rejection by Spain to comply with the US demand, the later decreed an embargo on oil supplies to Spain on 28 January 1944. Soon later an additional restriction on Spanish exports of cotton products was enforced, threatening the Catalan textile industry. On 2 May 1944 a secret deal was signed between Spain, the US and the United Kingdom, in which Spain, in exchange for the re-establishment of oil supplies and a compromise for negotiating future economic concessions, pledged to drastically limit the tungsten exports to Germany (a cap of 20 tonnes in May, 20 tonnes in June and 40 tonnes from then on), to close the German Consulate in Tangiers and expel its members, to prevent any logistic support to Germans in airports, to expel German spies and saboteurs from Spanish soil, to solve a litigation regarding Italian ships trapped in the Balearic Islands and to recall the last remaining Spanish volunteers on the Eastern Front. Despite the Spanish capitulation, the Spanish diplomacy sold the deal as a success as the full termination of Tungsten exports to Germany ultimately ended up being \\"just\\" a heavy cap limiting the exports to a symbolic amount. The US, the most uncompromising part in principle, put the blame on the failure to achieve a complete end to the exports on the British diplomacy, while Winston Churchill kindly commended Spain for its \\"services\\" in a late May intervention in the House of Commons.

Accessed 14 Feb 2013.  Biography  Dino Moras is a chemist by training with a thesis defended in 1971 at the University of Strasbourg, formerly Louis-Pasteur University. After a post- doctoral fellowship at Purdue University in Indiana, USA, he joined the CNRS in 1969 and founded the department of crystallography at IBMC in 1980. In 1995 he moved with his CNRS unit in the new IGBMC. He became a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1998 and a full member of the Academy of Sciences in 1999. In 2002, following Pierre Chambon and Jean-Louis Mandel, he was Deputy Director and then Director of the IGBMC in Strasbourg from 2002 to 2010.  Main Scientific contributions  = Chemistry = 1968 - Synthesis and structure determination of a heterocycle without carbon atom. 1971 - Structure determination of heterocyclic cryptates. 1982 - First structural characterization and imaging of H3O+, the catalytic intermediate at the heart of acid-base catalysis postulated by Br√∂nsted in 1918). = Structural Biology =  Structure-function relationships in transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and their relation to the origin of the genetic code  (i) Crystal structure of tRNAasp, the second to be solved at atomic resolution. (ii) Partition of aaRSs into two classes based on structural and functional correlation (each class of enzymes targets different chiral centers). (iii) The first structure determination of a class II tRNA- aaRS complex led to the elucidation of the reaction mechanism for the aspartic acid system, prototypic of all class II enzymes. It provided the structural explanation for the different chirality of the targets in the two classes. Further the crystal structure led to the discovery and functional characterization of a novel conformation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The latter was so far only found in class II enzymes. (iv) The crystal structure of threonyl-tRNA synthetase enlightened the molecular mechanism of the editing reaction to correct for tRNA mischarging by serine thus solving the related Pauling paradox for the fidelity of translation.  Transcription regulation by Nuclear Hormones Receptors (NRs)  The superfamily of NRs, ligand- dependent transcription factors, regulates the expression of important target genes. NRs control most physiological functions and are implicated in several pathological processes. In 1995 he solved the first crystal structures of the ligand binding domains (LBDs) of two NRs of retinoids (RXR and RAR) in their apo and liganded form respectively. These structures allowed to define a canonical unique fold for the whole family and revealed the molecular mechanism of ligand dependent activation, setting up the bases for the design of agonist and antagonist drugs. The crystal structure of RXR LBD was the first determination of a protein structure using Xenon as heavy atom derivative. His team contributed several other molecular structures of NRs LBDs, notably those of human VDR (vitamin D) and insect's receptor Ecdysone (EcR). In 2004 a comparative analysis of the primary sequences lead to the partition of the superfamily into two classes according to mutually exclusive invariant aminoacids. A functional correlation with clear evolutionary implications could be made with their dimerization properties. Class I receptors encompasses homodimers or monomers while class II assembles the receptors that form heterodimers with RXR. In order to decipher the structural bases of the communication between nuclear receptors, DNA and components of the basal transcription machinery he used the multi-scale approach of integrative structural biology. The solution structures of several nuclear receptors heterodimers bound to their DNA response elements was the first milestone. It was followed by the cryo-EM structure determination of two additional complexes.

He is most famous for his charitable legacy of ¬£9.6 million, roughly 105 million Norwegian krone (2018 inflation), that he left after his death. Life and background Owesen was born in Dublin to Trondheim timber merchant Otto Frederik Owesen, originally from Denmark, and his Irish wife Jane Allingham, aunt of the poet William Allingham. Through his mother, Jane Allingham, Owesen was related to Mary Wollstonecraft, whose mother, Elizabeth Dickson, was a first cousin of his grandfather, John Allingham, via their shared grandparent Thomas Dickson, and to her daughters Mary Shelley and Fanny Imlay. His father Otto returned to Trondheim with his mother and the young Thoning soon after his birth and named their house 'Ballyshannon', after Jane's birthplace. After his mother's death from tuberculosis in 1807, when he was 3 years old, Owesen was sent to live with his mother's family in Ireland. He was raised in the household of his maternal grandparents as their son, and his uncles and aunts, despite being of varying ages, were sibling-like figures to him. Owesen never saw his father again as a result of the Gunboat War preventing sea travel from Ireland to Norway, and, on his father's death in 1812, when he was 8 years old, he inherited his father's estate, consisting of money, property and a prominent shipping business. Owesen began his education at Foyle College in 1814 alongside his uncle (and brother by wardship) James Allingham and Henry Montgomery Lawrence. Whilst at school, Owesen's uncle Andrew Alexander Watt (1778‚Äì1851), who oversaw the family's eponymous distillery, acted as Owesen's guardian. Owesen returned to Trondheim on holiday with his uncle (and brother by wardship) Edward Allingham in 1819, whereupon he was welcomed by his father's old friends and is said to have been convinced that Norway was his home. Two years later, in 1822, Owesen permanently relocated to Trondheim. In 1829, he bought Leira G√•rd, an estate of 5,199 acres with 28 worker's cottages, which had historically belonged to the von Krogh family. Owesen also owned 20,000 acres of forest in Tiller, Selbu and Tydal.Johan Toning Owesen, Norwegian Biographical Lexicon Whilst being a conscientious landowner and respectful of his tenants, Owesen was also influential in public and social life. His parties in Norway were well attended, with two notable attendees being Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, and Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. He became a member of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters in 1858. He died at his estate in 1881. His funeral procession in Trondheim consisted of one hundred carriages and vast crowds. His estate sold Leira in 1900. Philanthropy Owesen is widely remembered for his philanthropy both during and after his lifetime. After his death, he left 334,000 Norwegian krone (¬£3.7 million or 40 million Norwegian krone in 2018) to enable the foundation of the Dalen Blindeskole, an institution for the blind, which was the first of its kind in Norway. Owesen also left a total of 528,780.58 Norwegian krone (¬£5.3 million in 2018) to causes including a children's home, restoration of Nidaros Cathedral, other religious causes, local causes and the benefit of the poor. Part of this money, 32,000 Norwegian krone (¬£356,421 in 2018), was left to his servants. Legacy It is said that Owesen never married because of his dedication to public service and improving the conditions for the poorest in society. Many of the causes to which Owesen donated still benefit from his financial legacy today. A street in Trondheim, Thoning Owesens gate, is named after Owesen. The Irish businessman Andrew Alexander Watt was his great-nephew, as was the politician Sir Anthony Babington.

Farhan confessed to numerous robberies, rapes and four murders (later recanting them), and was convicted of three murders and one rape, receiving three consecutive life sentences. After an appeal, he was acquitted of his last murder, but his other convictions were upheld. Early and adult life Adwan Farhan was born to Muslim-Arab family, in the little Bedouin village of Hamaam, Israel. He is the youngest of 13 children. His father, Yahya, was part of the Palmach and fought alongside the Jews during the War of Independence, but died when his son was only 5 years old. His mother had difficulty raising Adwan, whom soon become the family's black sheep. Years later, his mother also passed away. In 2007, much to family's dismay, he changed his name to Yahya, in order to honor his father. As an adult, Yahya would become a career criminal responsible for a variety of crimes, but still managed to marry a woman named Zeriya, with whom he had four children. One of his daughters suffers from a severe kidney disease. However, he spent little time with them due to spending time in various prisons. In 2001, he began a relationship with a 13 year old Jewish teenager from Tiberias (only identified as Y.), whom studied at a boarding school in Afula. Farhan mistreated the woman and her family, beating on her two occasions and forced her to convert to Islam. The woman also gave birth to a baby, but since it was uncertain who was the father, the child was sent to a foster family. Crimes Farhan first entered the criminal world at the age of 16, but was arrested and imprisoned for the first time in 1998, at the age of 22. Since then, he has had numerous convictions, serving time in the Shita, Ashmoret, Tzalmon and Eshel prisons. According to police from the Northern District, at some point he was an informant, but contact with him was seized after his information turned out to be unreliable. =Non-murder offences= * January 1999: rape and other sexual offences. Sentenced to four years in prison, released in September 2002. * 2004 (unknown date): attempted to poison one of his sisters. * Early 2004: weapon possession. Sentenced to one year and eight months in prison, plus 20 months suspended sentence. Released in 2006. * September 2005: Farhan raped a prostitute, Vans Farhan, in Tiberias. He went up to her apartment, undressed and, threatening her with a knife, raped her several times. When he finished, he dragged Vans to his car where his girlfriend was waiting, but the victim managed to escape his grasp. * 2006: two weeks after release, Farhan was arrested yet again, for a number of crimes. They include burglary, auto theft, forgery, fraudulence, defamation under aggravated circumstances, check kiting and two robberies. In the first robbery, he stole fuel from a gas station and stabbed the station owner, threatening to burn his car if he spoke about it. In the second one, he robbed a resident of Tiberias while threatening him with a screwdriver. * Unknown date: raped a female tourist from Australia. Little information is available, as a gag order was placed over the case. =First murder= According to his own confessions, Farhan committed his first murder in 1994, at age 18, killing a friend near the Arik Bridge in the Golan Heights. This couldn't be verified, and he was not prosecuted for this murder. =Murder of Silvia Molarova= A 27-year-old tourist and volunteer from the Czech Republic, Silvia was spending most of her time at a pub near Dugit. Farhan spotted the drunk woman trying to hitch a ride from the pub in March 2003, and taking advantage of her state, he and his girlfriend drove the unsuspecting Molarova to the Tzalnom River. He held her by the hair and strangled Molarova to death with a thin cable. After that, he put her head in the stream, and when her body stopped moving entirely, he forced his girlfriend to tie stones to the body, in order for it to not float. =Murder of Dana Bennett= On May 26, 2003, Farhan and his girlfriend noticed Bennett exiting a shared taxi while travelling in his car. The pair persuaded Bennett to enter their car, and after she entered, Farhan began driving towards a field in Migdal. When they arrived, he hit the scared Dana in the face, tore off her blouse, took off her bra and strangled her with it. The girlfriend, Y., watched the whole event, and later helped with burning the body and hiding the remains. =Murder of Aharon Simchov= In July 2004, while in a detention center in Tiberias, a fight broke out between the prisoners. After having breakfast the next day, Farhan followed Aharon Simchov, one of the prisoners involved in the fight who cooperated with authorities, to the shower area. With all noises camouflaged by the running water, Farhan proceeded to beat Simchov, before strangling him with a string taken from the victim's trousers. He then hung the body from the shower head, in an attempt to simulate suicide. Trial and sentence After Bennett's body was discovered in 2009, Y. was questioned about the case, confessing that Farhan had killed the girl. During this time, he was imprisoned in Beersheba for robberies and theft, and was awaiting trial for one of the rape cases. When interrogated, Farhan confessed to his crimes and the other murders, implicating Y. in helping him with two of them. His guilt was definitely proven, as he managed to recreate the Bennett crime scene accurately. At trial, he quickly recanted his confessions, accusing the authorities of denying him access to his lawyers, medication and any sleep at all. He also alleged that the real killer was roaming free and that Roman Zadorov, who was suspected of killing a woman, was also innocent of his respective crime. Despite his claims, Yahya Farhan was sentenced to three consecutive life sentences, plus 12 years for the rape of Vans Farhan. On October 2, 2013, an appeal from Farhan was approved, acquitting him of Simchov's death, as there was insufficient evidence to prove his guilt. However, the judges reaffirmed the rest of the convictions, and sent Farhan off to the Sha'ar Menashe psychiatric hospital.

Plot  C√≠ntia Dorella (Maisa Silva) was a romantic 17-year-old girl who lived with her parents in a big and beautiful home. She sees her world crumble when she realizes that her father Cesar (Marcelo Valle) was cheating on her mother Ana (Miriam Freeland) with her evil stepmother Patricia (Fernanda Paes Leme) by kissing her behind a closed curtain (which her daughter, Graziele (Leticia Pedro) opened) during her parents' anniversary party, ultimately ending the parents marriage and the father marries Patricia. Cintia gains 2 new stepsisters. After this event, Cintia moves in with her aunt Helena (Elisa Pinheiro) and her boyfriend Rafael (S√©rgio Malheiros), who taught Cintia lessons on how to be a DJ. Since Cintia wanted to be a professional DJ when she grows up, she always begged Rafael to get her to play at parties. Rafael always fulfilled her requests. The first time she was DJ- ing was at a senior pool party, and an elder lady asked her to turn the volume down. Cintia refused, because she said if she turns down the music, then no one will be able to hear it. This made the lady frustrated, which made her ask Cintia's name so she can complain to the host. Cintia gave her her name, but instead of hearing Cintia Dorella, the lady thought she said \\"Cinderella\\" and then left her alone. Freddy, a boy who's reputation as a love song singer, is admired and is invited to attend Cintia's step sisters birthday party. Anyway, Rafael let her cover as a DJ for him. The event was her twin stepsisters birthday party. Freddy comes up and believes he is in love with her. When he asks for her name she says \\"I am Cinderella, DJ Cinderella.\\" she \\"disappears\\" when called up by Freddy, afraid of the disapproval of her fathers. Freddy keeps trying to find the identity but fails. C√≠ntia ends up falling in love with Freddy, but has to deal with Graziele (Leticia Pedro) and Gisele (K√≠ria Malheiros), daughters of her stepmother and who also want the boy. In the end, they weren't even that bad as one of them helps prove how evil Patricia is. As very clich√© ends, Freddy finds out about Cintia and end up dating. Both of them work together in their music and become number 1 in the music industry. Patricia goes back to live with her mom, who is not as rich and way more strict.

He is a warrior-hero, venerated as a saint and a Rudra Ansh avatar of Shiva. He is referenced in the folklore of Jammu. Little historical knowledge of him exists other than that he was son of King Ladh dev and queen Kalli.  Kingdom  Baba Shivoji 's father was King of Pattan. Pattan is one of the historical capitals of Kashmir, nearly in the centre of the valley. Pattan tehsil hosts the remains of four palaces including two within the municipal limits. Rajatarangini tells us that the king of Kashmir Shankaravarmma built a town named Pattana.Rajatarangini of Kalhana:Kings of Kashmira/Book V,p.121 Legend According to legend, Shivo was born with the blessings of Guru Gorakhnath, who blessed his parents Raja Ladh Dev and Rani Kalli to have a child like Lord Shiva, whose name was conferred on the child. = Early life = King Ladh dev had no child, until he showed his kundali to his kulguru, who told him that he could have only one thing in his destiny: either the kingdom or a child. If he wanted a son then he must leave his kingdom and adopt Austerity (Tapasya) and pray to Gorakhnath for the child. After handing over the throne to his younger brother, Both king and queen left for Samotha where they prayed to Gorakhnath for years and Gorakhnath blessed them that a son will be born to them who will have godly features like Shiva, due to which he was named as Shivo. He was born in Samotha. =Other= When he grew up, he decided to work for the king of Jammu in his palace. According to folklore, a tiger came to the palace and then Shivo took its head and put it under the palace. The king came to know that he was a godly man and touched his feet and baba gave Spiritual gyaan to him. Shivo played a musical instrument (flute or guitar). In Samotha mostly lived Khatris. When he played their women came out of their homes to hear. They found his playing to be an insane act and conspired to kill Shivo when he was meditating under the Bauhinia Vahilii Grove. Baba Shivoji's head remained there, but his body travelled to the Goran where Babaji's Temple was later constructed. Most of the Khatris of Samotha were killed, while others left the area because of the Baba's curse. It is said that the Baba Goran fulfils wishes of devotees who pray with a true heart and strong determination. Many people ask for wishes to the Baba and then offer Bhandara (charity kitchen) at the temple after the wish is fulfilled. Goat sacrifices take place there. Baba Shivo (Goran Baba) is the kuldev of Sarmal clan of the Suryavanshi Dogra Rajputs.Baba Shivo Amar Gatha, p18, Priest of Baba Shivo Temple Devotees from Hindu and Muslim communities throng the shrine mainly on Sunday and Tuesday.

His best-known work is a memoir of his experiences of the Italian campaigns of the Second World War, Going to the Wars, published in 1955. He also wrote a number of books for children and young adults.  Early life and education  Verney was born in London on 30 September 1913, the son of Ralph Verney, who later went on to become secretary to the Speaker of the House of Commons and was created 1st Baronet Verney, of Eaton Square in 1946, and Janette Cheveria Hamilton (n√©e Walker), an Australian heiress. He spent part of his early childhood in India, where his father was serving as military secretary to the Viceroy, Lord Chelmsford. Educated at Eton College, Verney read History at Christ Church, Oxford, taking a 3rd-class degree, and then spent a year training at the Architectural Association in London. Before the outbreak of war he worked as an assistant director with both Charles Laughton and Robert Donat.  Military service in the Second World War  As a member of the North Somerset Yeomanry, Verney was called up at the outbreak of war in September 1939. Commissioned as a Lieutenant, he served initially in Palestine before taking part in the invasion of Syria in 1941 and the Western Desert campaign in 1942. Verney then volunteered for the Special Air Service (SAS), as a member of which he took part in ‚ÄòOperation Swann‚Äô in July 1943, parachuting into Sardinia to attack and destroy German aircraft stationed on the island. He was captured, but along with two others he escaped from a train and managed to rejoin the Eighth Army after three months hiding out in the Abruzzi mountains. He went on to see service in France and Germany as a major in the Royal Armoured Corps. He was awarded the Military Cross in 1944, and the L√©gion d'honneur in 1945.  Post-war career  Whilst still at Eton, Verney had made some drawings in the style of Heath Robinson, some of which he submitted for publication (without success) to Punch. Following his demobilisation in November 1945, he began to paint, in a variety of styles and using a range of media, and exhibited at London galleries such as the Leicester, the Redfern, and the New Grafton. A more reliable source of income was his work writing and illustrating children's magazines and books; he also had a brief period as editor of The Young Elizabethan in 1961‚Äì2. In 1955, he published Going to the Wars, \\"a vivid account of his years in the army which subtly blended humour and seriousness\\" (Oxford Dictionary of National Biography); a sequel, A Dinner of Herbs, in which Verney returned to the towns and villages of the Abruzzi mountains where he had been held captive during the war, was published in 1966. On the death of his father in February 1959, Verney succeeded to the title of the 2nd Baronet Verney, of Eaton Square, City of Westminster. In 1968, he was elected to Farnham urban district council as an independent, and helped found the Farnham Trust, now one of the oldest building preservation trusts in the UK. In the early 1980s he served as chairman of the Gainsborough Museum at Sudbury, Suffolk.  Personal life  In 1939 Verney married Lucinda Musgrave (known as Jan). They had seven children ‚Äì two boys and five girls; their eldest son, Julian, died aged 8 in November 1948. John Verney died aged 79, on 2 February 1993 at his home, the White House, in Clare, Suffolk.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. It is significant as an outstanding example of work by architect and designer Alfonso Iannelli, combining elements of Prairie School, Modernist, Art Deco and Cultural Nationalism movements; it is also significant as one of the few public artworks referencing the Indian removal actions by the United States government in the 1800s. Because of the controversial nature of the sculpture, interpreted by some as depicting white supremacy, and because of the deteriorating condition of the fountain, it was removed from the park in 2018 and placed in storage. The statue was subsequently removed from the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. History What is now Bronson Park encompasses squares of land set aside by Kalamazoo's founder, Titus Bronson. The land was officially dedicated as a public park in 1864, and over the next few decades trees, plantings, and sculptures were added, as well as two or three fountains in the park's center. The last of these fountains was a silo- esque 1927 \\"McColl\\" fountain. Public sentiment found the design of this fountain unappealing, and in 1936 a contest was held to design a replacement. The contest was won by Marcelline Gaugler, a twenty-four-year-old University of Illinois art teacher who studied with Alfonso Iannelli. When the city requested some modifications to Gaugler's design, Iannelli was invited to assist. Ianelli provided multiple ideas, and by 1937, the city contracted with him to provide a finished design for the fountain and surrounding area. Iannelli and the city worked on multiple designs through 1938, and by 1939 demolition of the old McColl fountain had begun. Construction on the new fountain designed by Iannelli was completed in 1940, and it was dedicated on June 6 of that year. Although the fountain drew critical acclaim from Frank Lloyd Wright and Bruce Goff, among others, the theme of the fountain later began to draw criticism. While the fountain was being constructed, Iannelli had said, :Regarding the meaning of the Fountain of the Pioneers, the scheme of the fountain conveys the advance of the pioneers and the generations that follow, showing movement westward, culminating in the tower-symbol of the pioneer, (a glass panel projecting from the head indicates his vision): while the Indian is shown in a posture of noble resistance, yet being absorbed as the white man advances; the pattern of the rail indicates the rich vegetation and produce of the land. Beginning in the 1990s, there were multiple calls for its removal, with debate over the work's meaning and value. Some believed it should be removed because it was racist and memorializing genocide, others believed it should stay because it depicted actual history that should not be forgotten. In addition, over the years the fountain was deteriorating, and by 2018 was in need of restoration. At the same time, controversy generally over potentially racist public monuments came to a head. The city decided to remove the fountain in April 2018. Description The Fountain of the Pioneers contained three major elements: two are long, shallow pools, lying end-to-end, and a fountain sculpture located at one end of one pool. The pools are roughly rectangular, but pointed at opposite ends. The one which contained the sculpture is 135 feet long, 44 feet wide, and 24 inches deep. The second pool is spaced 66 feet away, and measures 119 feet in length, with the same eight and width. The fountain was an elongated hexagonal box approximately 32 feet long by 16 feet wide by 8 feet high within the longer pool. The box contained the plumbing and lighting elements, as well as the sculpture. This sculptural feature was an obelisk roughly 18 feet tall, depicting a Pioneer and Indian figures at one end. These figures were depicted with strong lines and reduced detail, tightly linked, woth the Indian figure placed lower than the Pioneer.

It tells the story of a blacksmith who holds a demon in captivity, and as a revenge for his troubles is torturing it. Later, an orphan girl releases the demon from its enclosure. It is based on a Basque folk version of the tale of The Smith and the Devil as collected by Father Joxemiel Barandiaran.  Plot  In 1835 in Araba, Basque Country during the First Carlist War rebels are captured by government soldiers and executed. One rebel, Francisco Patxi, survives with the aid of a demon and slays the soldiers. 8 years later Alfredo Ortiz, a government investigator, searches for Patxi, now living in a ruined forge in the woods. The nearby villagers avoid the forge due to the rumour Patxi murdered his wife. The villagers mistrust Ortiz as the government melted down all their metal during the war to make weapons, including their church bell. Benito, a boy from the village, steals a letter proving Ortiz is searching for gold that vanished during the war. Usue, an orphan girl with a burn scarred face, is bullied by Benito who throws her doll over Patxi‚Äôs fence. Ortiz hires men from the village to raid the forge where he suspects Patxi has the missing gold, but are driven away by Patxi while one of the men falls into a bear trap and dies. Usue attempts to retrieve her doll while Patxi disposes of the dead man. Inside the forge she finds a boy captive in an iron cage and frees him, but the boy retrieves a pitchfork and transforms into a demon. He kidnaps Usue and promises to return for Patxi‚Äôs soul, but before he can escape he is caught in another bear trap while Usue is knocked unconscious. Patxi breaks off one of the demons horns and locks him back in the cage. Benito tells Ortiz that Patxi and a demon have kidnapped Usue. Ortiz rallies the men to save Usue. Usue wakes up and finds Patxi torturing the demon. The demon, Sartael, reveals Patxi made a deal, his soul in exchange for surviving the war to see his wife again, but Sartael tricked him as his wife already had a new lover. Patxi teaches Usue how to torture demons by throwing chickpeas on the floor, which demons are unable to resist trying to count, and by ringing gold bells blessed by the church. Usue asks Sartael if he can free her mother Maite from Hell after she committed suicide. Sartael reveals that humans are compelled to enter Hell by their own guilt, and once inside they can never leave. Sartael is then knocked unconscious by Patxi. The villagers arrive and arrest Patxi while the priest reveals the truth about Patxi. Usue‚Äôs mother, Maite, was Patxi‚Äôs wife, but after he returned from the war he found Maite had taken a lover and given birth to Usue. Enraged Patxi burned Usue‚Äôs face and murdered her father, while Maite, grief stricken, hanged herself. Ashamed, Patxi gave Usue to the priest as an orphan, along with a replacement bell he forged for the church. The villagers find Sartael and Ortiz orders Patxi tortured until he returns the gold. Once alone with Sartael, Ortiz reveals he is actually Sartael‚Äôs superior from Hell, the demon Alastor. Alastor reveals that as Sartael has become an embarrassment to Hell he has been demoted. Alastor orders Patxi be hanged so he can collect his soul instead. The villagers, driven to religious hysteria, set fire to the forge. Sartael makes a deal with Usue to search for her mother in Hell if Usue frees him and rings the golden bell. Usue rings the bell causing Ortiz to reveal his demon face. The two men hanging Patxi flee, dropping Patxi to the floor. Usue frees Sartael but he is captured by the villagers. The priest slaps Usue for freeing Sartael and insults her mother, so Usue makes a deal with Alastor, her soul in exchange for being taken to her mother in Hell. Alastor agrees and kills her. Grief stricken, Patxi agrees to let Sartael take him to Hell in exchange for saving Usue. Sartael agrees as he wants revenge against Alastor, but remarks that Patxi will need more than his small golden bell to survive Hell. Patxi reveals the giant bell he forged for the church is made from the very gold Ortiz was looking for. Sartael kills Patxi with his pitchfork, taking them both to the gates of Hell where thousands of damned souls are waiting to enter. Patxi finds Usue and fends off the demons guarding the gate. Alastor attacks Patxi but Usue throws Patxi‚Äôs jar of chickpeas at Alastor who is forced to try to count them. With Alastor‚Äôs defeat the gates begin to close. Patxi sends Usue back with Sartael while he decides to remain in Hell to search for Maite. Usue wakes up back on earth. Sartael, grateful that Usue saved him from his cage, declares to the villagers that Usue was rejected from Hell because she is a true Saint and should be treated with respect. As the villagers gather around Usue, Sartael transforms into a young man and makes his way to the next town. On the way Sartael begins to tell the tale of The Blacksmith, a man so ruthless and cruel that even the Devil himself came to fear and respect him. In Hell, Patxi forces the gates of Hell open as he begins to search for his wife with his hammer and the golden bell on his back.

The derby was held on July 8, 2019, at Progressive Field in Cleveland, OH, the site of the 2019 MLB All-Star Game. In an effort to lure more big name players to the Derby compared to previous seasons, MLB increased the winner's prize to $1 million with the total pool money being increased to $2.5 million, up from $525,000 in 2018. The longest home run, amongst the total 312 hit by the 8 players involved, covered a distance of , and was hit by the runner-up of the contest, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. This was the first derby since the format change in 2015 to feature tie-breaking rounds, as Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Joc Pederson went to a record three swing-offs in the second round. Additionally, Guerrero Jr. surpassed the previous first and second round records for home runs hit by Josh Hamilton in 2008 and Kyle Schwarber in 2018 respectively. Winner Pete Alonso of the New York Mets hit 23 home runs in the final round, also breaking the final round total set by Giancarlo Stanton in 2016. The total tally of 312 home runs is the most in the history of the event. Rules Eight players participate in the derby in a bracket-style, single-elimination timed event. Each player has four minutes to hit as many home runs as possible. Hitters are awarded an additional 30 seconds if they hit two home runs over . Hitters are also allowed one 45 second timeout to stop the clock (two in the finals). The eight competing players are seeded 1-8 based on their home run totals. While the lower seed hits first, the higher seed hits second in all rounds. The round ends if the higher seed exceeds the total of the first hitter. In the event of a tie, two sets of tiebreakers are employed: first, a 1-minute swing- off (with no timeouts nor bonus time awarded); thereafter, multiple three- swing sets will occur until the tie is broken. Bracket By June 30, 2019, Toronto Blue Jays third baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Cleveland Indians first baseman Carlos Santana, New York Mets first baseman Pete Alonso, Pittsburgh Pirates first baseman Josh Bell, Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Christian Yelich, and Atlanta Braves outfielder Ronald Acu√±a Jr. had agreed to participate in the derby. However, on July 7, 2019, Yelich was forced to withdraw from the derby due to a back injury. As a result, Oakland Athletics third baseman Matt Chapman was selected by the league to replace Yelich. Guerrero set a new single-round record with 29 home runs in the first round, and he and Joc Pederson matched the feat in round two. Both Guerrero and Pederson tied with eight home runs in a tiebreaker, matched with one home run in a three-swing swing-off, before Guerrero prevailed in a second swing-off by a score of 2‚Äì1. * Round went into three swing-offs after Guerrero Jr. and Pederson were tied 29‚Äì29 after regulation.

She is known for her analyses of textual material from north and central India, and her studies of historical processes. Life Eugenia Vanina studied at the University of Delhi between 1979‚Äì80, training in Hindi and Sanskrit. She defended her Candidate of Sciences thesis, titled Urban handicraft production in North India, 16th-18th centuries in 1984 at the Institute of Asian and African Countries, Moscow State University. She obtained her higher doctoral degree of Doktor nauk in 2006 with her dissertation titled Medieval Indian Mindscapes: Space, Time, Society, Man. Career Vanina's 1996 publication of Ideas and Society in India from the Sixteenth to the Eighteenth Centuries (an English language translation of her Russian volume from 1993) restricted the notion of 'medieval India' to the period between Akbar and the end of the Mughal Empire, and was a comparative analysis of trends in Western Europe and India. She introduced her idea of social processes and noted that these drove society from feudalism to capitalism via new forms of authoritarianism. She compared the bhakti and sufi tradition in India with the European reformation. The latter, she claimed, led to the abolition of feudalism, while the former, among other processes, led to the same in India only in the 19th century. These processes were, for example, the centralising worldly power of the Mughal emperor versus religious law. Critics called her concept of social processes as 'nebulous', while the lack of attention to Timurid forms of governance and the concentration on Hindu traditions of rulership was also criticised. In her work titled Medieval Indian Mindscapes: Space, Time, Society, Man, Vanina stated that Marxist analyses concentrated on the socio-economic, ignoring the material and spiritual. To remedy the lacuna, Vanina applied social and cultural categories that implied that India between the 1st to the 18th centuries was feudal. Her comparison of the Indian worldview with that of the European suggested that both sets of societies underwent the same 'mental programme'. Her synthesis of the entire cultural development of medieval India as equivalent to 'feudal', however, was questioned by some critics, and her application of the Marxist notion of base and superstructure was criticised. Meanwhile, other critics claimed that her proposed model of studying spaces as sacred places, cyclical time, hierarchical social estates, and the opposition of the individual versus society, is not coherent enough to establish her claimed similarity with Western feudalism. Vanina analysed the notion of 'feudalism' as applied to India, on the one hand rejecting it as insufficient from a historiographical perspective, while on the other, inferring from her overarching definition of 'man' and 'society' as essentially on par with feudalism. Critics nevertheless appreciated the insights drawn from her close readings from medieval texts, albeit with the caveat of their restriction to north and central India, and the lack of female voices.

He made his debut in March 2013 and reached the top makuuchi division in July 2019. He wrestles for Chiganoura stable. His highest rank has been maegashira 10. He has a twin brother Takanofuji Sanz≈ç who also wrestled for Chiganoura stable. Early life and sumo experience He was born in Oyama, Tochigi Prefecture, as a younger brother of an identical twin to a Filipino mother and a Japanese father. He would grow up in Sakai, Ibaraki Prefecture. He was in many sports as a youth such as karate and kickboxing but was particular good at basketball. In junior high he was ranked third nationally in basketball and was scouted by many top high school basketball programs. Among his rivals was future NBA player Rui Hachimura. Upon his father's request he took up sumo after being introduced to yokozuna Takanohana in the third grade. After junior high he chose to join Takanohana stable along with his brother stating, \\"I won't make any money in basketball and I would like to continue using my body.\\" The stable already had a set of twins (Takageppo and Takatoshi) making Takanohana stable the first in sumo history to have two sets of twins simultaneously. However both of the other twins had retired by the end of 2014. Career Takagenji made his professional debut alongside his brother in March 2013. He steadily rose up the ranks before hitting his first wall upon his promotion to makushita two years later in March 2015. He could manage only three wins at the rank and was immediately demoted back down to sandanme. He proceeded to bounce between the two divisions for a little less than a year before a surprise 6-1 runner-up performance in January 2016 would help to firmly establish him in the makushita division. He fought in this division for a little over a year before on the coattails five kachi-koshi or winning records he achieved 4‚Äì3 record at makushita 1 and gained promotion to the j≈´ry≈ç division. His first tournament in j≈´ry≈ç did not pan out as his last year had and he fell flat managing only a 4‚Äì11 record and being immediately be demoted back down to the makushita division. This wouldn't last long though as two winning records would send him back up to the sekitori ranks. This time his stay in j≈´ry≈ç was the polar opposite of his first with four straight winning records before getting his first make-koshi or losing record. After the January 2018 tournament his brother (then known as Takayoshitoshi) was promoted to j≈´ry≈ç also, making them the first twins to be ranked in j≈´ry≈ç simultaneously. Shortly after this his stable was dissolved and he moved to Chiganoura stable along with his brother. In May 2019 at the rank of j≈´ry≈ç 2 he got a 13-2 winning record taking home the y≈´sh≈ç or championship and guaranteeing his promotion to the top division. Takagenji made his makuuchi debut in July 2019 at the rank of maegashira 10. He made a promising start by winning four of his first five matches but then lost ten in a row to finish on 4‚Äì11. The same score of 4‚Äì11 in the September tournament from the very bottom rank of maegashira 17 saw him demoted to j≈´ry≈ç for November 2019. Further losing records saw him demoted to makushita for the September 2020 tournament. In December 2019, the Japan Sumo Association admitted that Takagenji participated in a regional sumo tour in Kyushu while infected with the influenza virus. A spokesperson said that Takagenji reported his health condition to a hospital in Saga on 11 December, but then climbed into the dohy≈ç later in the day. The actions were criticized by the head of the Japan Sports Agency, and the sumo association acknowledged that it failed to handle the matter properly. Fighting style Takagenji's performances to date suggest that he is an oshi-sumo specialist who favours pushing techniques to fighting on the mawashi or belt. His most common kimarite is yorikiri followed by oshidashi and tsukidashi. He was initially a yotsu-sumo or grappling specialist, but began to switch to pushing techniques around 2015 to try to improve his performances after finding himself going back and forth between the makushita and sandanme divisions. His consistency improved and he was eventually promoted to sekitori level in 2017. He is known for being a diligent trainer, so much so that when he dislocated his knee while practicing on tour in Tokushima in October 2016, he re-inserted the dislocated knee joint so he could finish the training session.

Biography  Barclay was born in Glasgow to Jessie Maxwell and Andrew Barclay, who was an engineer. In 1922, Barclay qualified as a state registered nurse at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Afterwards, she became a district nurse in Glasgow and trained as a midwife in Dundee. She had been acknowledged as a Queen's Nurse for over five years before she was offered a nurse post on Hirta, the largest island in St Kilda, in 1928.  St Kilda evacuation  St. Kildans sitting on the village street, 1886.Once Barclay arrived on the island, she was faced with the poor conditions the islanders were living in. Disease and migration during the 1920s had thinned out the population and the community was struggling to produce enough food to sustain itself. The severity of these conditions peaked during the harsh winter of 1929-1930, which caused several islanders to question whether they should continue living on St Kilda. Even though Barclay did not speak Gaelic and most of the islanders were not very fluent in English, she managed to build a relationship with the islanders. Throughout her time on the island, she reported several of her observations to the Scottish Department of Health officials and raised awareness about the conditions at the island. In April 1930, Barclay suggested the possibility of evacuation to the islanders over tea and convinced several of the islanders. She would later go on to assist the islanders, together with the missionary and schoolteacher Dugald Munro, in drawing up an official petition to request assistance with the evacuation and resettlement on the mainland. Barclay was appointed the government's representative on St Kilda in June 1930 and as such she bore responsibility for the planning of the evacuation and aiding resettlement of thirty-six St Kildans on the mainland, including the movement of their sheep. On 29 August 1930 she sailed with the islanders to Lochaline, where most of the islanders would make their new home. Barclay visited all of the resettled islanders and found that some were experiencing difficulties with the disillusionment and adjustment, which she reported to the Scottish Department of Health. She was awarded MBE in 1931.

(WIT) is an American non-profit organization which focuses on the employment of women in the trucking industry, addresses obstacles that might keep women from entering or succeeding in the trucking industry, and celebrates the success of its members. It was founded by Ellen Voie in 2007, who currently serves as the President and CEO. The organization focuses mainly on women who are already a part of the industry or have an interest in it and works as a support network with over 4,500 individuals and corporate members, both men and women. Worldwide members include carriers, suppliers, industry professionals, drivers, and students. WIT headquarters are located in Plover, Wisconsin, United States.  History  Ellen Voie founded the Women In Trucking Association in 2007. She is the holder of a Class-A commercial driver's license and has been advocating for the empowerment of women in the trucking industry since 1980. Voie felt the need for such an organization while working as the Manager of Recruiting and Retention Programs at Schneider National. As manager of recruiting and retention programs, she was targeting women but realized that the industry could do a lot more to attract women into the transportation business. To better address the issues that women face, she founded Women In Trucking.  Activities  Since its founding in 2007, the organization has worked to raise awareness and encourage women to become truck drivers. In 2008, WIT held its first reception at the Mid-America Trucking Show in Louisville, Kentucky. Ellen Voie, as founder, later became the President and CEO of the organization and Leigh Foxall was named chairwoman. In 2010, WIT held its first annual ‚ÄúSalute to Women Behind the Wheel‚Äù and that same year gained a monthly feature on SiriusXM's Freewheelin‚Äô show. Mark Rousseau joined the board as the first male director in 2010. The board of directors is composed of industry leaders from major corporations such as Walmart, Daimler, Bendix, C. H. Robinson, Arrow Truck Sales, Peterbilt, Ryder System, Michelin, J.B. Hunt, FedEx and more. In the same year, Women In Trucking founded a scholarship program to strengthen education in the commercial transportation industry. In 2012, WIT was recognized by the White House as a ‚ÄúTransportation Innovator Champion of Change!‚Äù In 2014, WIT designed a curriculum and created a transportation patch for the Girl Scouts. They also created a Girl Scout Patch and distributed it to the troops and held the first Girl Scout event, in Chicago, to educate young women about potential careers in the transportation industry. In 2014, the Women In Trucking Association also started a monthly segment on the Dave Nemo Show. In 2012, Redefining the Road, became the association's official member publication. Its total readership is approximately 15,000. In 2015, Women In Trucking then established the ‚ÄúDistinguished Woman in Logistics‚Äù award sponsored by TMW Systems and also created the WIT Index. It also held the first Accelerate! conference and expo in Dallas, Texas. Mary Aufdemberg also became the new chairwoman of the non-profit in March 2015 after Phyllis Cochran and Foxall. In 2016, The Women In Trucking Association partnered with the National Transportation Institute for their WIT Index, which quantifies the number of women drivers and management at organizations nationwide. WIT's goal is to increase the percentage of women employed in the trucking industry for which they developed the WIT Index to monitor the percentage of female drivers and leaders within the industry. In 2016, WIT partnered with University of Wisconsin ‚Äì Stout to release a recruiting guide for corporate members, ‚ÄúHow to attract female drivers.‚Äù In 2018, SiriusXM Road Dog announced that it would be launching a new radio show called, Women In Trucking, hosted by Ellen Voie to promote women employment in the trucking industry. The organization also introduced a 13-inch tall truck driver doll, Clare, which is sold at TA/Petro truck stops, HABAUSA and on Amazon. They recently also announced a collaboration with Expediter Services to create 150 women-owned businesses in transportation. WIT publishes a weekly e-newsletter and blog. Women In Trucking also has a Facebook group for women truck drivers to share their experiences and concerns. The WIT Image Teams (US and Canada) provide media interviews, product reviews and ride-alongs for regulators and legislators. In 2019, Laura Roan Hays became chairwoman. The same year, they also announced that \\"The Women in Trucking Association and the American Trucking Associations are spearheading a Congressional bill to address the challenges and discrimination women face in the trucking industry.\\"  Partners  The members and generous partners of WIT include Bendix Commercial Vehicle Systems, Daimler Trucks North America, BMO Transportation Finance, Expediter Services, Great Dane, J.B.

During his time as an apprentice, he is said to have \\"fallen into bad company\\" and taken to poaching and deer- stealing, which were serious offences in the late 17th century. Royal Navy View of Gibraltar taken by an officer of Admiral Sir George Rooke's fleet on 21 July 1704 Deane was described by 19th-century writer W. H. G. Kingston as a Royal Navy officer, who rose to the rank of captain and led in the Capture of Gibraltar at the height of the War of the Spanish Succession before becoming a merchant sailor in about 1709. Historian R.H. Warner found no evidence in Admiralty documents that Deane was ever an officer in the Royal Navy. He also suggested that Deane was more likely to have served as master's mate than to have been a Captain. Warner recognised that Deane's captaincy of the Nottingham Galley indicates that Deane had acquired the necessary skills to navigate a ship and that he had made prior trans-Atlantic voyages. Nottingham Galley and Boon Island With the assistance of his father and brother, in c. 1709 Deane purchased a small merchant galley which he called the Nottingham Galley. In 1710, Deane and his thirteen crew members set sail aboard the Nottingham Galley from London for Boston. Deane's galley encountered severe weather whilst crossing the North-West Atlantic. At around 9:00 pm on 11 December Deane's ship struck a rock outcrop on Boon Island, approximately eleven kilometres off York, Maine. The entire crew made it ashore on Boon Island, but the cargo and galley were wrecked and lost to the sea. Boon Island Lighthouse c.1900 The crew were marooned without food, shelter or fire. The ship's cook died soon after wrecking on the island with his body cast to sea. The carpenter died soon after. The crew made the decision to cannibalise the dead man in the hope of surviving until being rescued. Deane later wrote of the event, that the crew were \\"reduced to the most deplorable and melancholy circumstances imaginable\\". Having discussing the legal and moral ramification of the situation, the crew felt \\"obliged to submit to [their] craving appetites.\\" Deane disposed of elements of the body distinguishing it as that of a human. Lacking fire, the crew were forced to eat the body raw. The remaining twelve men survived without fire and with depleted resources for almost two months. In mid-January, the remaining crew attempted to construct a raft from the remaining parts of the ship and sent two men toward land in search of help. Before they had made the distance to shore, the raft was overcome by the sea with the two men drowning. Residents on the shore nearby found one of the washed-up bodies and sent a team to Boon Island the following day to rescue the remaining survivors. Before returning to England, some members of the crew, primarily led by his first mate Christopher Langman, signed a deposition and published a narrative of the shipwreck claiming that Deane and his brother, Jasper, had wrecked the ship on purpose in order to claim insurance money. Deane and his brother quickly published a counter-narrative disputing the claims made by the crew members. Russian Navy and Peter the Great Tsar Peter the Great, 1838 In 1714, Deane took service with the Tsar of Muscovy, Peter the Great in the Russian Navy. In the winter of 1714/15 he took command of the Yagudil, a 50-gun warship. In 1715, Deane was given command of the fifth-rate, 32-gun warship, Samson. Deane was a skilled commander and had successfully conducted over twenty raids on commercial vessels by 1719, gaining the admiration and patronage of Admiral Fyodor Apraksin, who presided over the Russian Admiralty from 1718 and commanded the Baltic Fleet from 1723. Admiral Fyodor Apraksin In 1717, the Samson raided two Swedish commercial vessels travelling through the Gulf of Danzig. The successful raid was interrupted by a Royal Navy frigate and a Royal Netherlands Navy man-of-war demanding that Deane relinquish the two vessels. Deane was overpowered and forced to surrender the prizes. In 1719 Deane was accused of accepting a considerable bribe in exchange for the surrender of the two Swedish vessels. He was soon court-martialled and, although eleven officers and under-officers from his crew testified in support of him, was found guilty and was dismissed from service with a year in prison. The Tsar later reduced the sentence to a demotion to lieutenant and an assignment to transport timber in the remote region of Kazan. During the trial, Admiral Fyodor Apraksin granted Deane a passport in an attempt to assist him in returning to England. Following the Treaty of Nystadt, ending the Great Northern War in 1721, Deane was dismissed from the Russian Navy and formally expelled from the country with the warning to \\"never return to Russia\\". Before his departure from Russia, Apraksin presented Deane with documents describing him as \\"Captain Deane\\", permitting Deane to maintain the rank of Captain, a title he continued to use until his death. Deane documented his knowledge of the Russian Navy's tactics and affairs in his 1721 publication A History of the Russian Fleet during the Reign of Peter the Great.Also see British diplomat Charles Townshend (1674‚Äì1738) In 1725, following his dismissal from the Russian Navy, Deane was enlisted as consul at St Petersburg. Deane was expelled from Russia seventeen days later. In this time, Deane produced two detailed reports for the British Government. \\"An Account of Affairs in Russia, June‚ÄìJuly 1725,\\" a brief regarding the political fallout following the death of Peter the Great. Deane also produced \\"The Present State of the Maritime Power of Russia\\" which gave explicit detail on the Baltic Fleet. Deane later intercepted a courier for the Jacobites who had been enlisted to deliver classified intelligence to an agent in Rotterdam, detailing Jacobite plans for the coming spring. These actions, in addition to his earlier intelligence reports from St Petersburg, brought Deane to the attention of the British prime minister, Robert Walpole, as well as the secretary of state for the Northern Department, Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend. In 1728 Deane was promoted to British Consul to the Port of Ostend at the request of Townshend. Deane's work at the Port of Ostend was greatly valued by the British Government with the arrangement of a good annual salary of ¬£200 with expenses. He was noted for his effective suppression of the Ostend Company, the first attempt by the Holy Roman Empire to monopolise trade with the East Indies. Following eight years of service as British Consul in Ostend, Deane retired in 1736 to his home in Wilford, Nottinghamshire. Personal life and retirement Wilford Village GreenDeane and his wife Sarah, first referenced in correspondence in 1725, had no children. Following his departure from the Russian Navy in 1725, Deane had constructed two large Georgian houses in the village of Wilford, south of Nottingham. He frequently visited his Wilford home sometimes for several months at a time whilst employed as Consul of the Port of Ostend and retired to there in 1736. As of 2019, the two houses remain overlooking the Village Green. Deane was enrolled as a freeman of the City of Nottingham in 1744. In 1745 he gave a considerably large contribution to the light horse regiment organized by Evelyn Pierrepont, 2nd Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull, of nearby Holme Pierrepont Hall, in support of the suppression of the Jacobite rising of 1745. Deane died in 1762 at the age of eighty-three following a violent assault and robbery whilst walking in fields near his house; his assailant was later hanged for his crime. Deane's wife died the following day at the age of eighty-two. They were interred together in the churchyard at St Wilfrid's, Wilford.The Last Will and Testament of John Deane of Nottingham (12 December 1755) Registered at the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, 1 July 1762.

History  Two museums have been established to display the works of Yves Saint Laurent and the collection of the Pierre Berg√© - Yves Saint Laurent Foundation: one in Marrakesh and the other at the historic headquarters of the Yves Saint Laurent fashion house in Paris. According to Pierre Berg√©, the designer's business partner and onetime life partner, \\"it was natural to build a museum dedicated to the work of Yves Saint Laurent in Morocco, as he‚Äîeven in the colors and the forms of his clothing‚Äîowes so much to the country.\\" The opening of both museums was organized in 2017. The museum in Marrakesh was notably financed by an auction of Moroccan works of art, held in the city by Pierre Berg√© September 2015. It was inaugurated October 2017 and opened to the public October 19, 2017. In January 2018, the museum received the best new public building award at the 2018 Design Awards of the British international design magazine Wallpaper.  Location  This Marrakesh museum is located on a street that had already been named after the designer, Yves Saint Laurent Street, near Majorelle Garden‚ÄîSaint Laurent's residence in Morocco, transformed since his death into a garden, museum of Amazigh cultures, and exhibition space receiving more than 700,000 visitors per year.  Description  The museum covers an area of 4,000 m2. It was designed by Studio KO and built by the Moroccan subsidiary of Bouygues. It includes an exhibition hall featuring the work of Yves Saint Laurent, another dedicated to Jacques Majorelle, and temporary exhibition halls, and an auditorium with 13 seats. It also has a gift shop and book store, a caf√©-restaurant with a patio, and a research library with over 5,000 volumes including Andalusi works dating back to the 12th century as well as books on botany, Amazigh art, and the work of Yves Saint Laurent. From the exterior, the earth-colored building takes the form of an assemblage of cubes and curves, dressed in a lace of bricks evoking weaves of fabric. The materials are terra cotta, concrete, and terrazzo, with colors allowing the building to blend in with its surroundings. The earth bricks were made from Moroccan earth and produced locally. The terrazzo in front and on the ground floor is an aggregate of stone and local marbles.

Guineo-Congolian regional centre of endemism The Guineo-Congolian region is a biogeographical region in Africa straddling the Equator and stretching from the Atlantic Ocean through the Congo Basin to the Congo / Nile divide in Rwanda and Burundi. Formerly, this region was largely covered in rain forest, on both well-drained sites and in swamp forests, but little undisturbed primary forest now remains, having been replaced in many areas by savanna and secondary-growth forest. Description Epulu River flowing through Okapi Wildlife Reserve, Democratic Republic of the Congo The Guineo-Congolian region is a tropical, lowland rain forest area, typified by the forests of the Congo Basin. The terrain is generally under and the annual rainfall is typically in the range . The forest is tall with a dense canopy, or more above the ground, with emergent trees up to tall, and with several layers. The constituent trees are mostly evergreen or semi-evergreen, with a scattering of deciduous species. In the wetter areas, the trees may be clad with numerous epiphytes, but these are less common in drier areas. Large trees typical of these forests include Entandophragma spp., Guarea cedrata, Guarea thompsonii, Lovoa trichilioides, Maranthes glabra, Parkia bicolor, Pericopsis elata and Petersianthus macrocarpus. Some parts of the forest are dominated by a single species, typically a member of the Fabaceae, such as Brachystegia laurentii, Cynometra alexandri, Gilbertiodendron dewevrei, Julbernardia seretii or Michelsonia microphylla, which form extensive monodominant stands. In places in the Ituri Rainforest of northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, G. dewevrei forms 90% of the tree species present in the canopy. The floras of the Guineo-Congolian region and the adjoining Zambezian Region are for the most part almost mutually exclusive, apart from a small number of cosmopolitan species and a few others. However, there is a transition zone where the two floras, each in an impoverished form, intermingle or occur in a mosaic pattern, influenced by climatic factors and soil types. This makes it difficult to define an exact boundary between the two regions. Subdivisions Simandou Range, Guinea Several forest types can be distinguished. Hygrophilous coastal evergreen forests occur in moist locations between Sierra Leone and Gabon in an intermittent coastal strip; these forests are often rich in legume family species which may regenerate freely and form pure stands. Mixed moist semi-evergreen forests occur extensively, especially in the Congo Basin, in somewhat drier locations. Drier peripheral semi- evergreen forest border the mixed moist forests to north and south and are subject to fire damage from adjoining savanna regions. Monospecific forests occur as patches in evergreen or semi-evergreen forests in the Congo Basin. Gallery forests and swamp forests occur where conditions are suitable but have more open canopies. Short forest and scrub forest occur on rocky hills and areas with thin soils.  Floristic provinces  Banco Forest seen from a fish farm, Ivory Coast *The Upper Guinean forests province is a tropical seasonal forest region of West Africa. The Upper Guinean forests extend from Guinea and Sierra Leone in the west through Liberia, C√¥te d'Ivoire and Ghana to Togo in the east, and a few hundred kilometres inland from the Atlantic coast. A few enclaves of montane forest lie further inland in the mountains of central Guinea and central Togo and Benin. The Upper Guinean forests are bounded on the east by the Dahomey Gap, a region of Ghana and Benin where the drier forest-savanna mosaic extends all the way to the coast, separating the Upper Guinean and Lower Guinean forest blocs.Linder, H.

The 2000 census showed that same-sex couples lived in 99.3 percent of all counties in the United States; with a total of 601,209 households reporting‚Äù. The Task Force‚Äôs Creating Change Conference director Sue Hyde shared, Paula Ettelbrick [had] ‚Äúa deep grasp of conditions on the ground for LGBT people in countries outside our own. But Paula‚Äôs story is incomplete without calling forward her inspiring and visionary work as a community organizer par excellence. She led the first campaign to increase our visibility in the U.S. census, when to do so was regarded as quixotic. She was in the forefront of the movement to grow and strengthen state-level LGBT organizing when statewide organizations were embryonic. Paula brought to life more than 350 actions in states across the country because she believed that our equality must be secured in our state capitols.‚Äù In the late 1990s, Ettelbrick co-founded the Federation of Statewide LGBT Political Organizations, forerunner of the Equality Federation, to co-ordinate strategies and share best practices for gaining LGBTQ rights in the United States. She did so understanding that LGBTQ rights needed to be won on the state level so coordinating all the nations equality groups was key to helping these goals. She then worked for the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC), later re-named OutRight Action International, as executive director from 2003 to 2009. IGLHRC is a non- governmental organization that addresses human rights violations and abuses against LGBTIQ people worldwide, and is accredited by the United Nations Economic and Social Council.Edih M. Lederer, \\"US gay rights group gets UN accreditation\\", July 19, 2010U.S. Gay Rights Group Gets U.N. Accreditation She was the groups‚Äô third executive director who increased their capacity nearly doubling the budget, and expanded the reach in Africa and the Middle East . She also was a teacher on law and sexuality subjects at Barnard College, Columbia Law School, the University of Michigan Law School, New York University School of Law and Wayne State University Law School. Ettelbrick was a ‚Äúprofessor and widely cited author‚Äù, making ‚Äúsignificant contribution to feminist and queer academia‚Äù. Ettelbrick‚Äôs last job was leading the Stonewall Community Foundation, ‚Äúan organization devoted to awarding grants to community LGBT organizations‚Äù, she was the first woman to do so. She started in July 2011 but retired a month later due to illness. While there she launched Out In Front New York, a ‚Äúcomprehensive training initiative for LGBTQ non-profit leaders and board members‚Äù, and ‚Äúlaid the groundwork for the foundation's newest giving circle, Stonewall Professional Alliance‚Äù, combining monthly donations coupled with community service.  Personal life  Ettelbrick had two children, Julia and Adam, both born during her long-term relationship with another lawyer, before gay marriages were legal, Suzanne Goldberg. She is survived by her partner Marianne Haggerty. She died October 7, 2011, of primary peritoneal cancer (similar to ovarian cancer) at 56 years old.  Honors and legacy  In March 2011, the Paula Ettelbrick Fellows and Interns Fund at OutRight Action International was established. The Paula Ettelbrick Community Service Award was established by Services & Advocacy for LGBT Elders (SAGE), America's oldest and largest non-profit organization dedicated to improving the lives of LGBTQ older adults, focusing on the issue of LGBTQ ageing. In 2012, the Minority Corporate Counsel Association, an organization founded in 1997 to ‚Äúadvance the hiring, retention and promotion of diverse attorneys in legal departments and the law firms that serve them‚Äù, started the Paula L. Ettelbrick Award to ‚Äúcelebrate extraordinary achievements by an individual or organization in advancing‚Äù LGBTQ attorneys. In June 2019, Ettelbrick was one of the inaugural fifty American ‚Äúpioneers, trailblazers, and heroes‚Äù inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City‚Äôs Stonewall Inn. The SNM is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and history, and the wall‚Äôs unveiling was timed to take place during the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.

In the 2010s, the States of New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria implemented policies to encourage market-led proposals, where potential private partners can pitch PS projects for consideration by the government.  Bangladesh  In Bangladesh, the Infrastructure Investment Facilitation Center (IIFC) facilitates private sector investment. As a result of IIFC efforts, the telecom sector has become a very active private investment area. Canada In Canada, public‚Äìprivate partnerships have become significant in both social and infrastructure development. PPP Canada Inc. was created as a Crown corporation with an independent board of directors reporting through the Minister of Finance to Parliament. Its mandate is to improve the delivery of public infrastructure by achieving better value, timeliness and accountability to taxpayers, through P3s. The Corporation became operational in February 2009 with the appointments of a chair of the board of directors and a chief executive officer. PPPs exist in a variety of forms in British Columbia through the focused efforts of Partnerships BC, a company registered under the Business Corporations Act, that is wholly owned by the Province of British Columbia and reports to its shareholder the Minister of Finance. Projects include the Canada Line rapid transit line, the Abbotsford Hospital and Cancer Centre and the Sea-to-Sky Highway project.An Introduction to Public Private Partnerships. (PDF) . Retrieved on 20 November 2011. In Quebec, PPPs include the McGill University Health Centre, the new western extension of Autoroute 30 and Universit√© de Montr√©al's Hospital Research Center. China There are more than 14,000 existing P3 projects in China, totaling $2.7 trillion in aggregate value, according to the finance ministry. The municipal government of Shantou, China signed a 50-billion RMB PPP agreement with the CITIC group to develop a massive residential project spanning an area of 168 square kilometers, locating on the southern district of the city's central business district. The project includes real estate development, infrastructure construction including a cross-harbor tunnel, and industry developments. The project, named Shantou Coastal New Town, aims itself to be a high-end cultural, leisure, business hub of the East Guangdong area. European Union A study, conducted by the European Court of Auditors of the European Union, examined 12 public-private partnerships in France, Greece, Ireland and Spain, in road transport and information and communications technology. It concluded that the partnerships were characterized by ‚Äúwidespread shortcomings and limited benefits‚Äù and underlined ‚Äúconsiderable inefficiencies in the form of delays during construction and major cost increases‚ÄùSee European Court of Auditors, Public-Private Partnerships in the EU, p. 9.. =Netherlands= The Netherlands Financial Sector Development Exchange (NFX) is a platform of ING, Rabobank, ABN AMRO, Fortis, Triodos Bank, FMO (Dutch development bank) and the Dutch Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Economic Affairs and Finance to stimulate financial sector development in developing countries and emerging markets. =Spain= In his paper on P3s in Spain, Jos√© Francisco Bellod Redondo notes that one of the main drivers for PFI in Spain is compliance with the fiscal restrictions imposed under the Maastricht Treaty and Stability and Growth Pact, which set concrete limits to the national debt.Bellod Redondo, Jos√© Francisco (November 2006), \\"Financiaci√≥n privada de infraestructuras: El caso de la Autov√≠a del Noroeste\\", Instituto de Estudios Fiscales Examples of PFI projects in Spain include Parque de Valdebebas in Madrid, Ciutat de la Justicia in Barcelona, the Autovia de Noroeste in Murcia, and the Hospital Puerta de Hierro in Majadahonda. India The Government of India defines a P3 as \\"a partnership between a public sector entity (sponsoring authority) and a private sector entity (a legal entity in which 51% or more of equity is with the private partner/s) for the creation and/or management of infrastructure for public purpose for a specified period of time (concession period) on commercial terms and in which the private partner has been procured through a transparent and open procurement system.\\" The union government has estimated an investment of $320 billion in infrastructure in the 10th plan. The major infrastructure development projects in the Indian state of Maharashtra (more than 50%) are based on the P3 model. In the 2000s, other states such as Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu also adopted this model. Sector-wise, road projects account for about 53.4% of the total projects in numbers, and 46% in terms of value. Ports come in second place and account for 8% of the total projects (21% of the total value). Other sectors including power, irrigation, telecommunication, water supply and airports, have gained momentum through the P3 model. , these sectors were expected to get an investment of Rs. 2,027,169 crore (according to 2006‚Äì2007 WPI).. Recent failures of the major PPPs in India, such as the Tata Mundra Ultra Mega Power Project and the Khandwa Water Supply Augmentation Project, are now questioning the ability of PPPs to deliver on the Sustainable Development Goals See \\"History RePPPeated, How Public Private Partnerships are failing \\", October 2018.

Third-sector lines are generally former JR Group ‚Äì or, before 1987, Japanese National Railways (JNR) ‚Äìlines that have been divested from those larger companies. Most third-sector railway lines in Japan, especially those located in rural areas, operate in a somewhat similar fashion to that of Community rail in the United Kingdom.

The most developed region was Saint Petersburg (with rating 7.8), the least Chukotka (rating 0.0). By 2013 there were almost 300 public‚Äìprivate partnership projects in Russia. United Kingdom In 1992, the Conservative government of John Major in the UK introduced the PFI, the first systematic program aimed at encouraging public-private partnerships. The 1992 program focused on reducing the public-sector borrowing requirement, although, as already noted, the effect on public accounts was largely illusory. The Labour government of Tony Blair, elected in 1997, expanded the PFI initiative but sought to shift the emphasis to the achievement of \\"value for money\\", mainly through an appropriate allocation of risk. However, it has since been found that many programs ran dramatically over budget and have not provided value for money for the taxpayer, with some projects costing more to cancel than to complete. An in-depth study conducted by the National Audit Office of the United KingdomSee United Kingdom, National Audit Office, PF1 and PF2, a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (London, 2018) concluded that the private finance initiative model had proved to be more expensive and less efficient in supporting hospitals, schools, and other public infrastructure than public financing. In the UK, two-thirds of the London Underground PPP was taken back into public control in July 2007 after only four and a half years at an estimated cost of ¬£2 billion and the remaining one-third was taken back into public control in May 2010 after seven and a half years for a purchase price of ¬£310 million. The government had paid advisers ¬£180 million for structuring, negotiating and implementing the PPP and had reimbursed ¬£275 million of bid costs to the winning bidders. The 30-year PPP contract for the refurbishment of the MOD Main Building in London was estimated to give a saving of ¬£100,000 as compared to the ¬£746.2 million cost of public procurement. The refinancing of the Fazakerley Prison PFI contract following the completion of construction delivered an 81% gain to the private sector operator. The NATS PPP saw 51% of the UK's air traffic control service transferred to the private sector; however, following the decline in air traffic after the September 11 attacks, the government and BAA Limited each invested ¬£65 million in the private sector operator in 2003. United States Public-private partnerships in America have existed in one form of another since the beginning of the colonial period, as colonial charters were based on a partnership between the British Crown and a company responsible for colonisation. In the United States, they mostly took the form of toll roads concessions, which emerged in the mid to late nineteenth century.David T. Beito and Linda Royster Beito,\\"Rival Road Builders: Private Toll Roads in Nevada, 1852‚Äì1880,* Nevada Historical Society Quarterly 41 (Summer 1998), 71-91. In recent years, there has been interest in expanding P3s to multiple infrastructure projects, such as schools, universities, government buildings, waste and water. In the early 2000s, P3s were implemented sporadically by different States and municipalities with little federal guidance. However, during Obama's second term, multiple policies were adopted to facilitate P3 projects, and Congress passed bills in that direction with overwhelming bipartisan support.  Vietnam  P3s were introduced in Vietnam in 2010, with the goal of attracting private investments for the country's infrastructure projects.This development was encouraged by the World Bank. Since then, Vietnam introduced 101 P3 projects, totaling 18.5$ Billion dollars. In 2019, Vietnam adopted its first P3 law, which was rafted in collaboration with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).

History  The theatre was originally founded as the Johannesburg Repertory Theatre (also known as the Reps' Theatre), seating 550 people in a Scandinavian design. It opened in Braamfontein in November 1951 as the home of the Johannesburg Repertory Players (Johannesburg Reps). On March 10, 1960, it was renamed the Alexander Theatre after Muriel Alexander, the founder of the Johannesburg Reps. It opened with Hugh Goldie's production of George Bernard Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra. The theatre was later used for professional performances by the Reps as well as by other companies. The Reps' last performance here was held in 1969: No√´l Coward's Present Laughter. Later, TRUK (Transvaal Performing Arts Center) leased it, and around 1978, that arts council purchased it. In the 1990s, the theatre's doors closed due to a drop in attendance with a performance of Ipi Thombi, and by 1997 the building was in a neglected state. In 2006, Adam Levy bought and restored the theatre as part of his urban renewal program in Braamfontein. As much as possible of the original architecture has been preserved. The new venue opened in July 2007 with Hazel Feldman's production of the rock musical Rent.

Opened in 1975, it was designed by local architect George Pearl and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. The library is a concrete-framed Brutalist structure designed to maximize the flexibility of the interior space with a modular layout and movable partitions. Pearl considered it one of his \\"three or four most important\\" designs. In 2020, the building was designated an Albuquerque historic landmark. History The Albuquerque Public Library was established in 1901 and moved into its first permanent facility, the Old Main Library, in 1925. By the 1970s, city officials had determined that a new library was needed, and bonds were issued in 1971. The building was part of a 1970 comprehensive plan for urban renewal in Downtown Albuquerque, which involved razing a large section of the city center to make room for a variety of large public projects. The plan was not fully implemented but many of the key elements, including the library, Civic Plaza, City Hall, the Police Department headquarters, and the Convention Center, were ultimately completed. In 1972, the city commissioned the firm of Stevens, Mallory, Pearl and Campbell to design the new library. The lead architect was George Clayton Pearl (c. 1924‚Äì2003), who had a long career in New Mexico and for whom the University of New Mexico School of Architecture and Planning building is named. The Main Library opened in 1975. Controversy involving the Main Library arose in 1999 when the city decided to have a group of high school students paint a mural on the east side of the building. This sparked public outcry at the possibility that the architecturally significant building would be damaged, with some of the most vocal opposition coming from Pearl himself. Eventually a compromise was reached which involved painting the mural on removable panels. The artwork was removed in 2005. The library received a $1.8 million renovation in 2006 which included the addition of a new glass atrium and lobby, a coffee shop, and an expansion of the used book shop on the lower level. The space that was developed for a coffee shop in 2006, the ABQ Coffee Connection, officially opened on May 3, 2010. In 2013, the restaurant Al's Other Half replaced the former coffee shop. The Main Library in 2006 with the glass atrium under construction Architecture The Main Library is a flat- roofed, concrete-framed building with two above-grade levels and one below- grade level. Stylistically, it fits into the Brutalist movement, which emphasizes bold, monumental forms and raw surfaces, while also drawing inspiration from the traditional adobe architecture of the Southwest. According to Pearl, the building had \\"regional influences‚Äîbut not archaeological ones\\" as the traditional Pueblo and Territorial styles were \\"no longer socially relevant\\". The exterior walls are clad in brown brick, with a series of cantilevered projections on the upper floor. Large windows on the ground floor, protected from direct sunlight by the overhangs above, allow the building to engage passersby at street level, while glass is used only sparingly on the upper level. The lower level has three sunken courtyards at the corners of the building, one of which was later partially enclosed with glass to form an atrium. After visiting a variety of other libraries around the country, Pearl concluded that many of the facilities were hindered by a rigid use of space which made it difficult to adapt to changing needs. With this in mind, his design for the Main Library prioritized flexibility above all else. All fixed elements, like heating and cooling equipment, restrooms, and stairwells, were segregated in projecting wings around the periphery of the building, while the main rectangular volume of each floor was completely open except for concrete structural columns spaced on center. The space is divided into -square modules, each with its own lighting, ventilation, and electrical, telephone, and video connections, allowing each floor to be freely subdivided using sliding partitions. The ground floor is mostly open space housing stacks, computers, and reading areas, with offices, meeting rooms, and the circulation desk located around the perimeter. The second floor is divided between public stack areas and administrative space including offices, mechanical equipment, and a staff lounge, while the lower level houses a meeting room, auditorium, children's area, and book storage. The interior is finished with exposed brick, wood-paneled partitions, and carpeted floors, and has many original furnishings.

History Jeeves of Belgravia, flagship store on Pont Street The company was founded in 1969 by Sydney Jacob and David Sandeluss. After being granted permission from P.G. Wodehouse to use the Jeeves name, the pair opened a shop at 8-10 Pont Street in Belgravia, London offering a specialist dry cleaning service for luxury garments. This shop in Pont Street is still the flagship shop today. Sandeluss later sold his shares in the business to Sydney Jacob, who brought his brother Ronald Jacob into the ownership of the company. In 1980, the Jacob brothers sold Jeeves UK for ¬£695,000 to women's clothing group Tricoville Ltd, under chairman Anthony Jacobs (no relation). At the same time, Tricoville also bought a 10% stake in Jeeves of Belgravia International, for ¬£80,000. Jeeves was sold to Sketchley in 1987. The Sketchley retail business operated its own chain of high street dry cleaners, as well as owning the SupaSnaps photo processing chain. In 1998, Sketchley was acquired by Minit Group, the international key cutting and shoe repair brand. Then in 2003, the Jeeves business was purchased by Johnson Service Group which at the time, operated the largest chain of dry cleaners in the UK- Johnson Dry Cleaners. In 2017, the Timpson Group acquired the Johnson Dry Cleaners business for ¬£8.25m, and thus acquired Jeeves of Belgravia and Jeeves International. Jeeves opened its first overseas branch in New York in 1979. In 1994, the business opened its first branch in Hong Kong and then in 1995 Jeeves expanded to Jakarta.

The ship had short but troubled history. In July 1923 after departing Col√≥n the tanker went missing. Large oil slick, burnt remnants and several lifeboats bearing the ships's name were later found indicating the ship exploded. All 32 people on board were presumed lost. Design and Construction On 14 August 1918 the Emergency Fleet Corporation (EFC) signed a contract with the Northwest Steel Co. to build ten vessels of approximately 8,800 deadweight. After realizing that there was no need for so many cargo vessels, but rather there existed a shortage of tankers, EFC rescinded its contractual obligations on six of the remaining ships on 15 September 1919. At the same time, Swiftsure Oil Transport Co. was looking to place an order to build seven oil carrying vessels of approximately 12,000 deadweight provided it could get financing from EFC to do that. As a result, on 12 April 1920 EFC, Swiftsure Oil Transport Co. and Northwest Steel Co. entered into agreement by which EFC would finance construction of seven tankers at a price of 2,400,00.00 each, Swiftsure Oil Transport Co. would have to repay the borrowed funds to the Fleet Corporation over 12 years, and Northwest Steel Co. agreed to release EFC from all claims arising from the Fleet Corporation's decision to cancel the remaining six vessels. Swiftstar was the third of these vessels and was laid down at the builder's shipyard in Portland (yard number 42) and launched on 5 February 1921, with Mrs. Nelson Bowles of Seattle serving as the sponsor. The ship was shelter-deck type, had two main decks and was built on the Isherwood principle of longitudinal framing providing extra strength to the body of the vessel. The vessel was equipped with wireless of De Forest type and had electrical lights installed along the decks. The tanker had a cargo pump room located amidships, and had ten double main cargo tanks constructed throughout the vessel with a total capacity to carry approximately 75,000 barrels of oil. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, and had a depth of . Swiftstar was originally assessed at and and had deadweight of approximately 12,020. The vessel had a steel hull with double bottom extending under her forepeak and boiler room, and a single 662 Nhp (3,200 ihp) vertical triple expansion steam engine, with cylinders of , and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller and moved the ship at up to . The steam for the engine was supplied by three single-ended Scotch boilers fitted for oil. Following the successful completion of the sea trials held on February 23 and 24, Swiftstar was turned over to the Fleet Corporation one day later and transferred to Swiftsure Oil Transport Co. per contract agreement on February 26. Operational history After delivery to her owners the tanker departed Portland in ballast on 26 February 1921 for San Francisco and arrived there on March 1. After loading fuel and supplies, the vessel left San Francisco on March 6 in ballast heading to Tampico where she was to load a cargo of oil, and from there she were to proceed to New York. The tanker was initially employed in carrying oil from Mexican ports of Tampico, T√∫xpan, Puerto Lobos and Tecomate to New York, however, in late spring 1921 a fight erupted between the owners of United States Mail Steamship Company headed by Charles and Francis R. Mayer and the USSB. Mayers were also at the helm of France & Canada Steamship Co., and 75% stockholders in Swiftsure Oil Transport Co. As Mayers became involved with US Mail Steamship Line affair in summer 1921, the bondholders of Swiftsure Oil Transport Co. took over the management of the company, and placed all seven tankers owned by the company under operation by C.D. Mallory & Co. Swiftstar was then assigned temporarily to carry oil from Mexico to the Gulf ports of Galveston and Port Arthur. In addition, towards the end of the year, she started making trips from Mexico to refining facilities of New England Oil Refining Company in Fall River. The tanker continued serving this route through the end of August 1922. Following a decline in the production of Mexican oilfields around that time, the tanker along with many other vessels, was instead rerouted to carry oil from Californian oilfields to Fall River. =Grounding in 1922= Swiftstar passed through Panama Canal on her first trip on new route on 3 September 1922 bound for San Pedro, and after taking on 10,132 tons (~70,000 barrels) of oil from the terminals of the Union Oil Company, departed for her return journey on 19 September 1922 under command of captain Kenney, who was replacing her usual commander, captain James P. Stevenson. The journey was largely uneventful, until the evening of October 10. At around 17:00 the ship was deemed to be approximately thirty miles south of Block Island. By about 18:00 heavy fog spread out through the area reducing visibility to about 300 yards. At about 20:43 while still travelling in fog the tanker suddenly ran aground on the southern side of Block Island. Distress calls were made and picked up by the local life-saving station, as well as in New York and Fall River. The fog finally dissipated around midnight and the crew could see themselves lying broadside to the beach no more than 50 yards away. At about 06:00 on October 11 tug Guardsman showed up at the scene, but was unable to render any assistance and returned to New London. As Swiftstar went hard on the beach, she injured her bottom with many holds being punctured and leaking. Several pumps became inoperable due to them being filled with sand, two boilers went extinguished, and the engine room was continuously leaking. Standard Oil tanker Eocene soon arrived and offered to tow the stricken vessel, but her offer was declined on the fears Swiftstar would break in tow and sink. By 11:00 the after-peak bulkhead finally gave in and the engine room got flooded very rapidly cutting off the dynamo and severing any means of communications. At around 15:00 submarine appeared in sight and by 16:15 it closed in to within 150 yards. Using lifeboats from minesweeper , N-2 was able to take off all 33 people on board the tanker in three trips. After abandoning the ship, the crew was taken by the submarine to New Harbor where they were safely landed two hours later. After four days of work the vessel was finally dislodged from her position in the morning of October 15 by wrecking tug Resolute and towed to New London for temporary repairs. After review, it was discovered that only three tanks were punctured during the grounding. The ship was then towed to the yard of Newport News Shipbuilding & Drydock Company in mid-November 1922, where repairs at a cost of 171,500.00 were performed. The repairs were finished in early January 1923 and the tanker returned to her regular service soon thereafter, sailing for Tampico on 11 January 1923. Following her return to service, Swiftstar reentered intercoastal service carrying oil from California to Fall River for the rest of her career, while still making occasional trips to Mexico. In June 1923 while en route from Providence to San Pedro, one of the sailors was arrested on board the tanker and put in chains after a wireless message was received identifying him as a suspect in murder and robbery committed in Rhode Island. =Disappearance= Swiftstar cleared for her last voyage from San Pedro with a cargo of 11,400 tons of crude oil (~79,000 barrels) on 30 June 1923 bound for Fall River. The tanker was under command of captain Richard Hull and had a crew of thirty two men. The tanker passed through the Panama Canal on Friday, 13 July 1923 and took course to her final destination. The tanker was expected at Fall River around July 23-25 but she never arrived at that port, nor any distress signals were received by any vessels along her expected route. On 22 July 1923 schooner Albert H. Willis on her way to the island of San Andr√©s to pick up a cargo of copra sighted a wreckage close to the island shore. As the schooner closed in to investigate, they discovered a large number of splinters floating everywhere in oil-covered sea in addition to two wooden and one steel rudderless lifeboats. Each lifeboat had a name Swiftstar written on the stern. A lookout also spotted a floating box of approximately eight feet long, four feet wide and five feet deep. On further examination it was deemed to be an ice box which was picked up and hoisted on board the vessel. Upon opening it was discovered that the box contained a charred body of a man whose identity was impossible to establish. The body was buried on San Andr√©s island before the schooner continued on her voyage. It was reasoned that a lightning strike was most likely responsible for the tragedy. As it struck the tanker amidships, it knocked out the dynamo thus preventing the vessel to send out a distress call. It also caused two adjacent tanks to explode breaking the ship in two with both halves sinking rapidly and therefore preventing any fire or smoke developing that could have been observed by passing ships. Finally, the charred body probably belonged to a man who was killed by the lightning outright with his body being thrown into the icebox. One of the Swiftstar sailors, John Paquette, later showed up at Fall River aboard another tanker, SS Swifteagle. Apparently, he was detained in Panama after attempting to smuggle a bottle of liquor into Canal Zone and as a result missed his ship and avoided the fate of the rest of the crew.

The river rises near to the villages of Nidd and Scotton draining mainly arable land north eastwards before emptying into the Ure at Boroughbridge. Where the river joins the Ure in Boroughbridge, has been the site of significant historic flooding. An Environment Agency project to alleviate flooding on the river has seen diversion schemes and pumps added to prevent this. Toponomy The river is known as the Tutt for only about of its length, and is variously known as Jumwell, Shaw and Occaney Beck in its early stages. It is also known as Tutt Beck, Fleet Beck and Minskip Beck. The derivation of the name Tutt for the river has many explanations; one theory is that it is from a Viking word, another states that it comes from the Roman goddess Tutelina, who looked after corn when it was in storage. A H Smith, writing in The Place Names of the West Riding of Yorkshire, lists the name as being badly translated down the centuries. Smith does postulate that due to a metathesis, the original listing from 1439, Riovolum de Ptruth, could derive through errors in writing from the Old English for Conduit. Course The river rises to the east of the village of Nidd as Jumwell Beck, about north east of the River Nidd, but flows east towards Staveley, instead of south. It flows inbetween the villages of Brearton and Scotton, where it takes on Percy Beck from the south. It then absorbs other becks around Farnham and in the process becomes Shaw Beck before being named Occaney Beck as it pass the hamlet of Occaney. As it passes north of Staveley Nature Reserve, it appears on Ordnance Survey mapping as River Tutt or Fleet Beck for the first time, though the Environment Agency list it as starting at Nidd. It flows north west of Minskip, under the A1(M) and the A168 road before entering Boroughbridge and then running into the River Ure. Though it is only a small river, it is a main tributary of the River Ure and is prone to floodwaters backflowing upstream from the River Ure and inundating Boroughbridge. In 1987, after a history of significant flooding in 1899, 1901, 1968 and 1982, The Tutt Diversion Scheme was implemented which would prevent water flowing up the river from the Ure when either, or both, were in flood. However, pumps installed on the river to prevent the Ure flooding the Tutt were accidentally reversed in January 2005, putting Boroughbridge at risk of a flooding event. The drainage basin covers an area of and as it a lowland catchment, it experiences a lower rainfall average than most of the tributaries of the River Ure as they drain off the adjacent moorlands. In the 13th century, the end of the river was the location of one of two corn mills in Boroughbridge. During the 17th and 18th centuries, fishermen worked on the river near to where it empties into the Ure at Boroughbridge. Their trade lives on in the names of the road by the rivermouth; Fishergate. Geology In its early stages, the beck meanders over a magnesian limestone landscape, though as it passes Staveley, it drains a mainly arable landscape which is largely devoid of woodland. The area around Occaney beck has been historically quarried for fluvio-glacial terrace deposits of sand and gravel. Other tests have proved the existence of sand in the area around the beck. Natural history The river is classified as being heavily modified, and much work has been undertaken by the Environment Agency and local volunteers to raise the watercourses' standard. Work by the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust has seen the return of many animals such as otters and herons. They have also installed logs in the river around the lakes in Staveley to provide shelter for fish. Whilst the presence of Cyprinid fish and brown trout in the watercourse is \\"likely\\", despite the poor chemical composition of the water,the river is noted for its Himalayan Balsam and Giant Hogweed. Mink faeces have also been observed on the river. The Environment Agency have stated that they wish to divert water from the Tutt into the lakes at Staveley in times of heavy rainfall to help alleviate the possibility of flooding in Boroughbridge. Crossings In 17th century, one of the Devil's Arrows was felled and the stone used to make a bridge over the river in Boroughbridge. This is widely believed to be the St Helena Bridge as an order of the Justices from 1621 at Knaresborough, details its purpose. The bridge also had eel traps installed on the upstream side. The Fishergate Bridge was built by Blind Jack Metcalf in 1754. The bridge and a retaining wall, were washed away in the Great Flood of 1883.

Clinical significance Toxic vacuolation is associated with sepsis, particularly when accompanied by toxic granulation. The finding is also associated with bacterial infection, alcohol toxicity, liver failure, and treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, a cytokine drug used to increase the absolute neutrophil count in patients with neutropenia. The formation of toxic vacuoles represents increased phagocytic activity, which is stimulated by the release of cytokines in response to inflammation or tissue injury. Toxic vacuolation frequently occurs in conjunction with toxic granulation and D√∂hle bodies in inflammatory states, and these findings are collectively referred to as toxic changes. Neutrophilia and left shift (the presence of immature neutrophil precursors such as band neutrophils and metamyelocytes in the peripheral blood) often accompany toxic changes, as these phenomena also occur in response to inflammation. It has been suggested that neutrophil vacuoles not be labelled \\"toxic vacuoles\\" unless they are accompanied by other toxic changes, as vacuolation can occur in other conditions. Similar conditions Vacuoles may form in neutrophils if a blood sample is left standing for several hours prior to blood smear preparation, but this is an artifactual change with no clinical significance. Artifactual vacuoles are small and of uniform size and distribution, in contrast to toxic vacuoles whose size and placement are variable. Individuals with neutral lipid storage disease may exhibit persistent lipid-filled vacuoles in neutrophils and other granulocytes, which is a distinct phenomenon termed Jordans' anomaly.

He was appointed to the commission in January 1925 to succeed Mark W. Potter, and confirmed by the Senate on March 27, 1926. He was awarded the Laetare Medal in 1943 for his work as an author of Catholic literature.  Family and early life  Thomas was born on September 1, 1866, in Dublin, Ireland, to Thomas and Emilia (Moran) Woodlock. After a primary school education in Ireland, he attended Beaumont College in Windsor, England. He graduated third in his class at London University, then attended St. Francis College in New York where he earned an honorary Master of Arts degree in 1905. He earned a Doctor of Laws degree from Fordham University in 1906.  Career  Woodlock had been a member of the London stock exchange and, after emigrating to the United States in September 1892, the New York stock exchange from 1906 until 1918. During this time he worked for the Dow-Jones News Service directly with Charles H. Dow and Edward D. Jones as part owner of the company with a specialty in American railroads. He worked as financial editor for the New York Sun and, following Dow's death in 1903, as acting editor for the Wall Street Journal then was formally appointed to the editorship in February 1905. It was his strong expertise in finance that led to his appointment at the Interstate Commerce Commission. His appointment in January 1925 by President Coolidge to the ICC, which itself followed two failed nominations to the same position, was objected to by Southern congressmen who felt an executive from the South would better fit the role. Those objecting used, among other arguments, the fact that he was born in Ireland and educated in England as a disadvantage. The Senate finally approved his appointment on March 27, 1926. Woodlock served on the ICC until his resignation in 1930, after which he rejoined the Wall Street Journal as a contributing editor; he was succeeded on the ICC by Charles Mahaffie. Woodlock was also very involved in Catholic organizations, serving as a trustee of Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart, an early member of the National Catholic Alumni Federation, a director for the Catholic Encyclopedia as well as author of several of its articles, and president of the Laymen's League for Retreats and Social Studies. In 1943, Woodlock was awarded the Laetare Medal for his work as an author of Catholic literature, with the president of Notre Dame, Rev. Hugh O'Donnell, calling him \\"one of the most vigorous and effective apologists among the Catholic laity of America.\\" Woodlock died in New York on August 25, 1945, and was buried in Gate of Heaven cemetery. His final column published in the Wall Street Journal was based on the 71st birthday speech of Herbert Hoover, in which Hoover said \\"America should again proclaim our faith. ... Our first post-war purpose should be to restore it.\\"  Published works  (combined reprint edition of the two books) *  References   External links  * Letter from Theodore Roosevelt to Thomas F.

Dƒìrings Fridrihs Juliuss  Biography  D√∂ring attended the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts. From 1838 he was trained there by Eduard Bendemann as portrait and history painter. In 1844, he traveled through southern Germany and northern Italy, drawing costumes for the poet E. Duller's \\"History of the German People\\" (\\"Geschichte des deutschen Volks\\"). After the painting of his first altar painting in 1845 in Duren, Poznan, he was invited to Mitau to work as a drawing teacher at Jelgava Gymnasium, in addition to which he also taught private lessons, was actively engaged in making portraits and painting church altarpieces.

She is the first woman to hold the position. Yoo is considered as a veteran in Korean trade circles. Over the past 25 years, she has worked in various government agencies since she passed the Korean state civil servant exam in 1991.  Early life and education  Yoo was born in Ulsan, South Korea in 1967 when Korea was on the verge of high economic growth after having just completed its first 5-year Economic Development Plan (1962~1966) and had set its main economic policy on export-led growth. Her childhood dream was to become a writer due to her creative and thoughtful personality, leading her to study English literature in Seoul National University, where she graduated with a bachelor's degree in English literature and an MA in Public Policy. She also holds a J.D. from Vanderbilt University Law School and was admitted to the New York State Bar in 2003.  Career  = Ministry of Trade and Industry = Yoo first started her career as a civil servant at the Ministry of Government Administration in 1992. As the beginning of her career coincided with the ongoing Uruguay Round negotiations at the WTO, Yoo felt that Korea at this time was in urgent need of trade experts. Backing herself to play a potential role in this respect, Yoo applied for a position at the Ministry of Trade and Industry (now the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy) in 1995 and started working at the WTO Division. Yoo has reflected that at the time of the Uruguay Round negotiations, she witnessed various ‚Äúdisputes and conflicts‚Äù, which motivated her to represent her country in trade negotiations and devote her life to representing Korea‚Äôs position. She also noticed that South Korea was the only country among the WTO member states which was not represented by any women in its delegation team, which prompted her to apply for a position at the Ministry of Trade and Industry. While working at the WTO Division, Yoo participated in subsidies negotiations and wrote a ‚ÄúGuide to WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures‚Äù.. = Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade = In 1998 after organizational restructuring at the Korean government, Yoo was transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Yoo at this time, felt the need to gain legal expertise in order to better understand trade, and she went on to study for a Juris Doctor degree at Vanderbilt University Law School. She was later admitted to the New York State bar in 2003. After returning to Korea in 2003, Yoo participated in the formation of the Korea-Singapore FTA. Yoo was also known for her affection and passion for trade, and was sometimes likened to former US Trade Representative Carla Hills. She subsequently served as the Director for the FTA Policy Division, and was in charge of the Services and Competition Working Group during the Korea-US (KORUS) FTA negotiations. During the negotiations, the US delegation jokingly remarked that it was unfair that while they did not understand Korean law well, Yoo was very knowledgeable when it came to US law. As many of Korea‚Äôs FTAs, especially KORUS FTA, were subject to intense opposition from interested parties, Yoo once acknowledged that coordinating between divergent positions among interested parties domestically is more difficult than engaging in official negotiations with a foreign country. She therefore believes that it is important to create rules that govern negotiations as well as establish a system that allows for greater coordination between different interests. From 2007 to 2010, Yoo was dispatched to the Korean Embassy in Beijing, China as the First Secretary and Counsellor. After completing her occupation in China, she relocated her position to Singapore to the APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) headquarters where she served as Program Director in the APEC Secretariat for 4 years until 2014. In 2014, Yoo was appointed as Spokesperson for Foreign Media at the Office of the President of Korea, where she served until 2015. = Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy = Minister Yoo Myung-hee delivering her speech at the inauguration ceremony for 2030 Busan World Expo project, June 2020 After further organizational restructuring at the Korean government in 2013, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) was formed. Yoo was transferred back to MOTIE, where she continued to expand her career as ‚Äúthe first female Director-General‚Äù, ‚Äúthe first female Deputy Minister for Trade‚Äù and ‚Äúthe first female Minister for Trade‚Äù. As a result of these accomplishments, she has earned the nickname ‚Äúthe glass-ceiling breaker‚Äù. In 2015, Yoo was appointed as the Director-General for FTA Negotiations and East Asia FTA. As Chief Negotiator for Korea, Yoo played a role in finalizing the Korea-China FTA negotiations, which entered into effect in 2015. In 2018 she was promoted to the position of Deputy Minister for Trade and successfully served as Chief Negotiator for the KORUS FTA amendment negotiations, playing the role of ‚ÄúDevil‚Äôs Advocate‚Äù while working alongside Trade Minister Kim Hyun-jong while assisting him in the team. The role of Devil‚Äôs Advocate is well known as a useful tool in trade negotiations to prevent a group from leaning only to one side. In 2019, Yoo was appointed as Minister for Trade. As Minister for Trade, Yoo played a key role in the conclusion of text-based negotiations for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in 2019, providing viable alternatives to reach a common ground among participating countries at varying levels of development. In addition, she has concluded the Korea-UK FTA in 2019, taking into consideration various Brexit scenarios into the agreement. She also concluded the Korea-Indonesia CEPA that featured a strong chapter on bilateral cooperation. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Yoo introduced in June 2020 the ‚ÄúPost COVID-19 Trade Policy‚Äù to reset Korea‚Äôs trade policy in response to changes in the international trade environment. In this initiative, she emphasized international cooperation and rule-setting in particular, in light of advancing the digital economy and recognizing and embracing the evolving global value chain for better recognition and utilization by stakeholders and industries. In June 2020, the Republic of Korea officially nominated Yoo as the country‚Äôs candidate for the Director-General of the World Trade Organization and Yoo officially declared her bid to run for the election.  Personal life  Yoo is married to Jeong Tae-ok, a former civil servant and politician. She has one son and one daughter.

Among its most prominent features is its large gateway, imitating styles of gates in Morocco's imperial cities: Marrakesh, Fes, Rabat, and Meknes. Another feature of the market is the octagonal center cupola, under which different kinds of fresh seafood are sold, such as fish of the Atlantic Ocean, shark meat, oysters, etc. The daily catch is displayed around a circular walkway, as well in a central island where oysters from Dakhla are shucked on the spot for one-by-one consumption.

It was the only coronation in the history of the Empire‚Äîa short-lived one-party state and self-proclaimed monarchy‚Äîwhich was established in 1976 by Jean-B√©del Bokassa, military dictator and president for life of the Central African Republic. The coronation‚Äîwhich was almost an exact copy of the coronation of Napoleon I as Emperor of the French in 1804‚Äîand related events were marked by luxury and pomp. Despite substantial material support from France, expenses amounted to over US$20 million ($ million today) and caused serious damage to the state, leading to a huge outcry in Africa and around the world. After the coronation, Bokassa stayed in power for less than two years. In September 1979, Operation Caban took place in his absence, as a result, the country became a republic again.  Background  In the spring of 1976, during a visit by the French president, Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing, Bokassa told him about his plans to proclaim the Central African Republic an empire and celebrate the occasion. According to Bokassa, the creation of a monarchy would help Central Africa improve its standing vis-√†-vis the rest of the continent and increase its authority in the international arena. The French leader proposed to hold a modest coronation ceremony in the traditional African style, avoiding high costs because the Central African Republic was one of the poorest countries in Africa, and an opulent ceremony could have negative economic and social consequences. Bokassa persistently requested d'Estaing for France's assistance in organizing the event. The French President was forced to agree for several reasons: first, the refusal could jeopardize the continuation of the profitable French role in the mining industry of the Central African Republic‚Äîmostly of uranium and diamonds‚Äîand secondly, France was interested in maintaining its influence in the country, which, along with Gabon and Zaire, was part of the triangle on which French policy in the region rested. Anxiety on the part of France was heightened after Bokassa attempted to draw closer to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who had strained relations with France and pro‚ÄìFrench Chad (because of a territorial dispute). This forced d'Estaing to promise material assistance to the Central African President in exchange for cutting ties with Gaddafi. On 4 December 1976, at the extraordinary congress of the ruling MESAN party, Bokassa announced the renaming of the Central African Republic to the Central African Empire and proclaimed himself Emperor. At the congress, a pre-prepared constitution of the empire was adopted, according to which the Emperor was the head of the executive power, and the monarchy was declared to be hereditary, transferred down a male line in the event that the Emperor himself did not appoint a future successor. His full title was \\"Emperor of Central Africa by the will of the Central African people, united within the national political party, the MESAN.\\" Shortly after the proclamation of the empire, Bokassa, who had adopted Islam and changed his name to Salah Eddine Ahmed Bokassa during a September 1976 visit by Gaddafi, converted back to Catholicism. The first world leader to congratulate Bokassa on the imperial title was d'Estaing, who for several years maintained friendly relations with Bokassa. In 1975, the French head of state called himself a friend and family member of the Central African President. In addition, d'Estaing visited the Central African Republic several times to hunt on the private estates of Bokassa, from where he and his brothers brought elephant tusks, mounted heads of lions and diamonds presented to them by Bokassa himself, which became clear somewhat later. The future dictator of the Central African Republic was well acquainted with the first President of the French Fifth Republic, Charles de Gaulle, who considered him to be his ally in arms. After the death of de Gaulle, Bokassa himself said: \\"I lost my biological father as a child, and now I turned towards my true father, General de Gaulle ...\\"  Preparations  Bokassa planned to conduct his coronation on 4 December 1977, exactly one year after the proclamation of the Central African Empire, following the example of Napoleon who was crowned on 2 December 1804, in Notre-Dame de Paris. He considered the Emperor of the French as his idol. Beside Bokassa himself, his \\"spouse number one\\" Catherine Denguiad√© was to be crowned during the ceremony. Their son, Jean-B√©del Bokassa Jr., one of more than 40 children of Bokassa, was proclaimed the Crown Prince and heir apparent to the imperial throne. Consequently, he continues to be the head of the House of Bokassa and the formal pretender to the imperial throne to the present day. Other close relatives of the Emperor received titles of princes and princesses. In preparation for the coronation, several special committees were formed, each of them responsible for a specific area of preparation. Thus, the committee responsible for the accommodation was charged with finding suitable premises for 2,500 foreign guests. To this end, having received permission from Bokassa, the committee members began to requisition apartments, houses, and hotels from the inhabitants of Bangui for the period of the celebrations, and repaired the rooms intended for guests. The task of another committee was to completely change the appearance of the capital, and especially those areas that were to be used during the coronation. Under its leadership, street cleaning, painting of buildings, as well as removal of urban beggars and vagrants outside the central areas of Bangui took place. Textile enterprises of the Central African Empire were engaged in sewing hundreds of ceremonial costumes for local residents, who were to become guests at the ceremony. The authorities regulated a certain dress code: children were instructed to wear white clothing, middle-level officials dark blue, and high-ranking officials and ministers black. While preparations were being made in the capital for the event, Bokassa sought contacts with foreign artists and invited them to Bangui to perpetuate his name in their works. West German artist Hans Linus Murnau painted two large portraits of the Emperor. In one, Bokassa was depicted bareheaded, and in the other, wearing a crown. The last portrait was subsequently used in a commemorative postage stamp dedicated to the coronation. In addition, the Imperial March and the Imperial Waltz were written in France, as well as the coronation ode, which consisted of 20 quatrains. Many of the objects used in the coronation were made by French masters. As early as November 1976, the representative of the Central African Embassy in France confidentially informed the sculptor Olivier Brice that President Bokassa would like to involve him in the work on the decoration of the Cath√©drale Notre-Dame in Bangui. In addition, Brice was instructed to develop projects of the Imperial Throne and carriage. Bokassa ordered a large diamond ring from American entrepreneur and political operative Albert Jolis who took the order but did not have the funds to purchase a fairly large stone. Jolis arranged to process a low-grade, finely crystalline, black diamond, resembling the outlines of Africa on the map, and inserted it into a large ring. The place on the black diamond which roughly corresponded to the position of the Central African Empire in Africa, was decorated with a colorless diamond. The item, whose value did not exceed , was presented to Bokassa as a unique diamond worth more than . After his overthrow, Bokassa took \\"a unique diamond\\" with him into exile, and Jolis cynically did not recommend selling it. The Imperial Throne, made of gilded bronze, was designed as a sitting eagle with outstretched wings. The height of the throne was , and weighed about two tons. For the manufacture of the throne, Brice built a special workshop near his home in Gisors in Normandy, where about 300 workers were employed. The throne seat of red velvet, which occupied the cavity in the belly of the gilded eagle, was made by local draper Michel Cousin. In total, the cost of the throne was approximately . For the carriage, in which Bokassa was to pass through the streets of Bangui on the day of the coronation, the sculptor Brice bought an old carriage in Nice, restored it, covered it with velvet on the inside, and partially decorated it with gold and added emblems to the outside. Eight white horses, which were planned to be harnessed to the Emperor's carriage, were procured from Belgium. In addition, several dozen of Norman gray horses were acquired for the Emperor's escort, whose members spent the entire summer of 1977 in Norman Lisieux, where they passed special riding courses. Most of the costumes were also made in France. The French company, Guiselin, which once performed similar work under Napoleon, took up the creation of a coronation suit for the Emperor, in association with Pierre Cardin. The imperial attire consisted of a long, to-the-floor, toga, decorated with thousands of tiny pearls; shoes decorated with pearls, as well as a mantle of crimson velvet, decorated with golden emblems in the form of eagles and edged with ermine fur. All this together cost the Central African treasury . Another was the cost of a dress made by Lanvin for Empress Catherine and adorned with 935 thousand metallic glitters. In addition to the dress, a mantle was made for the Empress, similar to the Emperor's mantle, but in a more modest size. The Imperial Crown was made by Arthus Bertrand, a jeweler from Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s. The design of the crown was traditional: it had a heavy frame resting on an ermine headband with a crimson canopy. A golden crown was placed over the headband, in the middle of which was placed the figure of an eagle, and eight arcs branched from the crown, supporting the blue sphere‚Äîthe symbol of the Earth‚Äîon which the outlines of Africa were highlighted in golden color. In addition, the entire crown was inlaid with diamonds, the largest of which‚Äî80 carats‚Äîwas in the center of the figure of an eagle, in the most prominent place. The cost of the crown is estimated at no less than . A separate crown, in the form of a wreath, adorned with a 25-carat diamond, was also intended for the Empress. In addition, the imperial sceptre, sword, and several items of jewelry were made for the coronation. All this, including both crowns, was estimated at about . More than 240 tons of food and beverages that were supposed to be served at the banquet after the coronation were also delivered to the country by airplanes from Europe. One winery in Bangui delivered up to 40,000 bottles, including the production of farms Ch√¢teau Lafite Rothschild and Ch√¢teau Mouton Rothschild, harvest 1971. Each bottle at that time was estimated at about . In addition to wine, Bokassa ordered 24,000 bottles of Mo√´t & Chandon champagne and his favorite Scotch whisky, Chivas Regal, as well as 10,000 items of silverware. Finally, in order for foreign guests to be adequately received in Bangui, Bokassa ordered the purchase of 60 new Mercedes-Benz cars. Since the country was landlocked, the vehicles were initially transported to a port in Cameroon and then flown to Bangui at a cost of . When everything designed for the coronation ceremony was successfully purchased and delivered to Bangui, the total amount, including both foreign acquisitions and domestic costs, was about . For the economy of a backward, practically impoverished African state such as the Central African Empire, this amount was extremely high, and equal to a quarter of the country's annual budget. Most of the expenses were paid by France, in exchange for the promised break with Libya. \\"Everything here was financed by the French government. We ask the French for money, get it and waste it.\\" Still, the Central African Empire had to pay a significant amount. = Invitations = Pope Paul VI As conceived by Bokassa, his coronation was to take place with the obligatory presence of Pope Paul VI. Apparently he intended, as supposedly Napoleon had done with Pope Pius VII at his coronation, to take the crown from the hands of the Paul VI and place it on his head himself. With a request to invite the head of the Catholic Church to the coronation, Bokassa turned to the Archbishop of Bangui, Monsignor Joachim N'Dayen, and Apostolic Nuncio in the Central African Empire, Oriano Quilici. Resisting this idea, Quilici explained to Bokassa in June 1977 that the Pope was too old for such a long journey and would not be able to attend the ceremony. The best that Quilici could offer Bokassa was to hold the Mass after the coronation ceremony. Upon receiving the consent of Bokassa, Quilici contacted the Vatican City and secured an agreement for the Pope to be represented by Archbishop Domenico Enrici, who had recently represented the Pope during the enthronement of King Juan Carlos I of Spain in 1975. The greatest concern on the part of Bokassa was caused by the refusals of the heads of state, including the monarchs invited to Bangui. Invitations were rejected by both Emperor Hirohito of Japan and Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran ‚Äì the first in the guest list compiled by Bokassa. The other ruling monarchs, one by one, also did not express a desire to attend the ceremony. The Prime Minister of Mauritius, Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, and the president of Mauritania, Moktar Ould Daddah, responded to the invitation by sending their spouses to Bangui. Prince Emmanuel of Liechtenstein was the only royal who flew to Bangui. Emmanuel of Liechtenstein Most of the states at the coronation ceremony were represented by their ambassadors, and a number of countries boycotted the ceremony altogether. Authoritarian African leaders such as Omar Bongo of Gabon, Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, and Idi Amin of Uganda found reasons to refuse to visit the Central African Empire. Later, in one of his interviews, Bokassa motivated their refusals by saying: \\"They were jealous of me because I had an empire and they didn‚Äôt.\\" Most unexpected was the decision of the French President not to attend. He limited himself to sending a sword of the Napoleonic era to Bokassa as a gift on behalf of the French government. The French head of state was represented in Bangui by the Minister of Cooperation Robert Galley and presidential adviser on African affairs Ren√© Journiquek. Supporting Bokassa, Galley condemned high-ranking officials who refused to accept an invitation to Bangui, but who were willing to take part in the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II. \\"It smacks of racism,\\" he concluded. In the end, of the 2,500 invited guests, only 600 agreed to come, including 100 journalists. Despite the complete absence of heads of state, there was no shortage of diplomats and businessmen in Bangui, including European ones.  Ceremony  On 4 December 1977, at 07:00 West Africa Time, Mercedes-Benz limousines were already carrying guests in the direction of the new Yugoslav-built basketball stadium, where the coronation was to take place. On the way to the stadium, cars drove through the newly repaired streets of Bangui, and passed by the Jean-B√©del Bokassa Sports Palace, along Bokassa Avenue, not far from the Jean-B√©del Bokassa University. By 08:30, all the guests and participants of the ceremony‚Äîabout 4,000 people‚Äîwere in their seats, and by 09:00, the arrival of Bokassa himself was expected. To maintain the appropriate atmosphere, the speakers located in the stadium loudly played solemn music. The part of the stadium where the coronation was supposed to take place was, according to Brice's plan, decorated with banners and tapestries of national colors, and red curtains and carpeting. The low platforms seating the thrones of the Emperor and Empress were completely red. The Empress' throne was much more modest than the Emperor's: it was a high chair made of red velvet with a gold- fringed, velvet canopy. To his left was a small seat for the Crown Prince. The stadium was carefully guarded by the French troops, sent \\"to secure the ceremony.\\" By 09:00, the motorcade of Bokassa was still on the way, and the famous French Navy orchestra of 120 people, present at the stadium, began to play an old drinking song, , to distract guests. Since the air conditioning at the stadium did not work, the extremely high temperature‚Äîmore than ‚Äîgradually made itself felt, which created discomfort for those present who were dressed in suits and evening dresses. Some, in order not to sweat, fanned the ceremony programs, which were given out to each guest. Only at about 10:10, the imperial motorcade, which had traveled several kilometers in length from the Renaissance Palace itself, arrived at the stadium. Along the motorcade route, a change occurred: unable to withstand the heat of riding in a closed carriage, Bokassa and Empress Catherine moved into one of the Mercedes equipped with air conditioning, and several hundred meters before reaching the end point of the route they moved back to the carriage again. At 10:15, the coronation ceremony began. The first to enter the hall were two guardsmen in military uniforms of the Napoleonic era who carried the national flag and the imperial standard to the end of the carpet. They then stood with the flags on either side of the platform where the thrones were located. After the guardsmen followed the Crown Prince. The boy was dressed in a white, military- parade uniform with a golden braid and a ribbon over his shoulder, and a white cap on his head. Next, Empress Catherine appeared in the hall. A mantle was fastened on top of her dress, and a golden, laurel-like wreath adorned her head. The Empress was accompanied by ladies-in-waiting in pink and white evening dresses and wide-brimmed hats, who supported the long train of her dress until she reached her throne. Before Bokassa himself entered the hall, the naval orchestra went silent. A voice from the loudspeaker announced to drumming: \\"His Imperial Majesty Bokassa I, the Emperor of Central Africa!\\" Accompanied by the sounds of an imperial march, the Emperor appeared on the carpet, dressed in a white toga with a belt having five stripes of the colors of the national flag. A wide ribbon was draped over Bokassa's shoulder, white antelope skin gloves covered his hands, and his head was decorated with a golden wreath, crafted in ancient Roman style. Accompanied by his escort, cameramen and photographers, he climbed onto the platform to his throne, after which the guardsmen handed him attributes of imperial power: a sword and a sceptre, which Bokassa took in his right hand. Then several pairs of guardsmen brought a long velvet mantle to the throne, and one of them put it on the Emperor. After this, Bokassa himself placed the crown on his head. The audience responded with applause. To complete it the ceremony, the Emperor publicly took the oath to the Central African people: When Bokassa finished speaking, the audience applauded again, and loudspeakers sounded , the national anthem, in the Sango language. Upon its completion, the coronation of Empress Catherine began. Dressed in a robe, she went to her husband and knelt in front of him, after which he took off the wreath from her head and placed the crown. This scene, as witnesses of the coronation noticed, had a noticeable similarity to the moment captured on the painting The Coronation of Napoleon by Jacques-Louis David. Noticeably, the French minister Robert Galley was dressed during the coronation as Marshal of the Empire Michel Ney during the coronation of Napoleon. The coronation ceremony was completed with a performance of the choir who arrived at the stadium. After the coronation, the Emperor, the Empress with ladies-in-waiting, the Crown Prince, and the rest of the children of Bokassa, went to the Mass at the Cath√©drale Notre-Dame, two kilometers from the stadium. Along the way, they were accompanied by an equestrian unit of hussars. While the Emperor and the Empress rode again in a closed carriage, the Crown Prince was separated from them, in an open horse- drawn carriage. On the way to the Cath√©drale, the imperial cortege passed under the triumphal arches and banners with the letter \\"B\\", which appeared in Bangui on the eve of the festivities. Along the road crowds stood on the sidewalks, however, their actions, according to Brian Titley, did not demonstrate \\"obvious enthusiasm.\\" In the Cath√©drale, two thrones were prepared in advance for the Emperor and the Empress, and a small seat for the Crown Prince, similar to the one in the stadium. A few more seats were intended for high-ranking guests, but they didn't have enough seats for all, and many had to remain standing. The Mass in three languages‚ÄîFrench, Latin, and Sango‚Äîwas held by Archbishop N'Dayen. He preached with dignity, wishing the Emperor success, but avoiding the expected excessive praise and adulation. The new Roman Pontifical promulgated by Pope Paul VI in 1970 as part of the liturgical reforms that followed the Second Vatican Council did not contain (and, to this day, its revised editions do not contain) a Coronation Rite. Accordingly, at present, the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church only possesses a Coronation Rite in its Tridentine extraordinary form (the universal use of which was permitted by Pope Benedict XVI in 2007). However, the postconciliar ordinary form of the Roman Rite has never included a ritual for the Coronation of monarchs, and none was created in 1977 for the Coronation of the Central African Emperor, even on an ad hoc basis. Accordingly, the part of Bokassa's Coronation ceremony held at the stadium, prior to the Mass that followed at the Cath√©drale, was not a religious ceremony but a secular affair, including the moment of his actual crowning. As for the Solemn Mass that followed at the cathedral, that religious part of the festivities did not consist of any special Coronation ritual, but was a regular Mass of Thanksgiving, following the normal rubrics for a solemn Mass celebrated by a Bishop. Because there was no actual Coronation liturgy, Bokassa was not anointed at any point during the celebrations. = Dinner = The last event of 4 December was an evening banquet at the Renaissance Palace hosted by Bokassa for, in his view, the most outstanding guests. Those who were not invited to the reception, went to the bar of the Hotel Rock, equipped with air conditioning. A total of about 400 people attended the banquet. Since, by evening, the heat in the capital had gradually subsided, the event was held in the open air: the tables where guests were seated were located in a vast, picturesque garden, decorated with fountains and bone carvings, adjacent to the Palace. For security, the garden was protected by bulletproof glass screens. By 21:00, when all the guests had gathered, the waiters started serving food, although Bokassa, as usual, was late and only appeared after some time. By this time, he changed his coronation clothes and regalia for a marshal's uniform with a cap featuring a cockade and ostrich feathers, and a black diamond ring glittered on the Emperor's finger. The Empress who accompanied him wore a long, , French evening dress. A variety of dishes were served at the banquet. For dessert, the guests were offered a huge seven-layer imperial cake, decorated with green icing. When the cake was taken to the tables, the top part was removed from it, releasing half a dozen pigeons outside. Dishes on the tables corresponded to its contents: dinner was served on gold and porcelain plates, ordered specially from the famous Limoges master Berardo. When the guests had eaten enough, Bokassa leaned over to Robert Galley and whispered: \\"You did not notice it, but you ate human meat.\\" It is not known whether the Emperor was telling the truth or not, but later his words became one of the reasons for the belief that Bokassa was a cannibal. Moreover, it is believed that the served meat belonged to prisoners held in a Bangui prison. After dinner, a scheduled 35-minute break took place, during which a festive firework display was given at the Palace. Pyrotechnics, were brought from Paris. The fireworks were followed by a pop show in which several songs were performed by a song- and-dance group of former bar girls from Saigon, South Vietnam. The French naval orchestra, which had performed at the stadium, also participated. When it played the \\"Imperial Waltz,\\" written in France specifically on the occasion of the coronation of Bokassa, the Emperor and Empress invited guests to the dance floor. The party came to an end around 02:30. = Parade = On the morning of 5 December 1977, a solemn parade began in Bangui to mark the coronation of Bokassa. The parade was held on one of the main avenues of the Central African capital, where a special review platform was installed for the Emperor and his guests. At 10:00, Bokassa arrived, again an hour late. The Emperor was again dressed in a marshal's uniform, and Catherine was dressed in a garden party dress and a pale, purple, wide-brimmed hat. The parade was the final part of the celebrations accompanying the coronation. Additionally, in the afternoon, a number of sporting events were held in Bangui, also timed to coincide with the coronation, the largest of which was the Coronation Cup basketball tournament‚Äîthe Emperor himself was present. Later that evening, several parties and receptions took place. Gradually, the festive atmosphere in the capital faded and the guests began to go home, after which Bangui returned to the usual way of life. = Assessment = Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing in 1978 The coronation of Bokassa I provoked a mixed reaction throughout the world, and led to mainly negative comments in Africa. Kenya's Daily Nation referred to Bokassa's \\"clowning glory,\\" while the Zambia Daily Mail deplored his \\"obnoxious excesses.\\" The reaction in Europe was generally dismissive: French journalists associated the coronation with a masquerade, ridiculing the wastefulness and vanity of Bokassa. The assessment of French president Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing was more optimistic. Having watched the recording of the ceremony on TV, he called what was happening ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù and emphasized the ‚Äúcertain dignity‚Äù of such a coronation. He compared Empress Catherine with Napoleon's wife, Empress Jos√©phine, calling them both \\"incarnations of modesty and charm.\\" Despite the fact that the coronation and accompanying celebrations caused serious damage to the state budget, Bokassa was not the only contemporary monarch who decided to stage a similar lavish event: in 1971, on the occasion of the 2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of the Imperial State of Iran declared himself the successor to Cyrus the Great of the Achaemenid Empire, and spent about US$100 million ($ million today) to celebrate the anniversary. This amount far exceeded the one that was spent by Bokassa in 1977.

Born in Cixi in the coastal province of Zhejiang, Xu Xu attended Peking University between 1927 and 1932 where he studied philosophy and psychology. In 1932, he moved to Shanghai where he became an associate of Lin Yutang, a liberal and polyglot intellectual who ran a number of successful literary journals. In 1950, Xu Xu left the newly founded People's Republic of China for Hong Kong where he stayed for the rest of his life. Best known as the author of the modern gothic tale Ghost Love (È¨ºÊàÄ, 1937) or his wartime spy-epic The Rustling Wind (È¢®Ëï≠Ëï≠, 1944), Xu Xu was also a prolific poet, playwright, essayist, literary critic, journal editor, and professor of literature. Many of his popular novels were turned into movies or TV series in post-war Hong Kong and Taiwan. As a writer, editor, and educator, Xu Xu has had a formative impact on a younger generation of post-war writers emerging in Hong Kong and Taiwan. In much of his fiction, and especially in his later works from Hong Kong, Xu Xu explored reality-defying experiences and displayed neo-romantic tendencies, such as aesthetic escapism and mysticism, which place him in the proximity of other modern artists associated with the global revival of romanticism in the 20th-century. Early career In the 1930s, Xu Xu worked as an editor for several of Lin Yutang's journal ventures in Shanghai, such as the bi-monthlies The Analects (Ë´ñË™û) and This Human World (‰∫∫Èñì‰∏ñ), two journals that published predominantly prose essays (Â∞èÂìÅÊñá). In 1936, Xu Xu went to Paris to study Philosophy at the Sorbonne. In early 1937, while still abroad, his novella Ghost Love in which a modern urbanite falls in love with a woman who claims to be a ghost appeared in the Shanghai bi-monthly Celestial Winds (ÂÆáÂÆôÈ¢®) to great acclaim. Later that year, Xu Xu hastily returned to China following the outbreak of war with Japan. From the relative safety of the Shanghai International Settlement, Xu Xu continued to publish largely apolitical fiction and travel essays that were characterized by lyrical exoticism and a distinctly cosmopolitan outlook. When all of Shanghai was occupied by Japanese forces in the wake of the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Xu Xu left Shanghai for Chongqing, the wartime capital of the Chinese Nationalist government. Here, Xu Xu's wartime novel The Rustling Wind was serialized in the wartime newspaper Enemy Annihilation (ÊéÉËï©Â†±) in 1943. An epic about espionage and romance in occupied Shanghai, The Rustling Wind made Xu Xu one of the most widely read authors of the war years.Christopher Rosenmeier, On the Margins of Modernism: Xu Xu, Wumingshi and Popular Chinese Literature in the 1940s (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2017), page 73. Post- war period Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Xu Xu's fiction had frequently been criticized by leftist critics as escapist and detrimental to their revolutionary agenda. As a result, Xu Xu decided to leave the newly founded People's Republic of China in 1950 for Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, Xu Xu continued his writing career and throughout the 1950s published dozens of short stories and novellas, most of which appeared in the literary supplements of the Hong Kong newspapers Sing Tao Daily or Sing Tao Evening News. In many of these works, Xu Xu engaged with the themes of exile and alienation and frequently explored fantastic or sublime experiences, as is the case in the novellas Bird Talk (È≥•Ë™û, 1950) or The Other Shore (ÂΩºÂ≤∏, 1951). Between 1956 and 1961, Xu Xu published his magnum opus, the bildungsroman River of Fury (Ê±üÊπñË°å) that, in 1972, was turned into a martial arts movie under the same name by Shaw Brothers Studio. In Hong Kong, Xu Xu also wrote copious amounts of literary criticism, edited a number of literary journals, and taught Chinese literature, eventually chairing the Chinese Department of Hong Kong Baptist University. According to Leung Ping-kwan, Xu Xu had a formative impact on a younger generation of Hong Kong writers and intellectuals.P.K. Leung, John Minford (ed.) Islands and Continents. Short Stories by Leung Ping-kwan (Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press, 2017), page 120. In 2018, an operatic version of Xu Xu's novella Ghost Love opened in Hong Kong.

(Wladek) ≈öwiƒÖtecki (22 April 1926 ‚Äì 30 September 2009) was a Polish theoretical and nuclear physicist. He was one of the first proponents of the island of stability for superheavy elements, showing that it appears in a mass formula influenced by the presence of closed nuclear shells; he is also known for several other contributions in nuclear structure research. Biography ≈öwiƒÖtecki was born in Paris on 22 April 1926. His father, also named W≈Çadys≈Çaw ≈öwiƒÖtecki, was an inventor and aeronautical engineer. ≈öwiƒÖtecki lived in Poland with his family until September 1939, when they escaped to France following the invasion of Poland and start of World War II, only to flee again to England in May 1940. ≈öwiƒÖtecki continued his education in England. In 1945 and 1946 respectively, ≈öwiƒÖtecki completed Bachelor's degrees in physics and mathematics. In 1950, under the guidance of Rudolf Peierls, he received his Ph.D. in physics for his thesis entitled \\"The Surface Energy of Nuclei\\". Having completed his education, ≈öwiƒÖtecki went on to work in various nuclear physics laboratories in Scandinavia before settling at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 1957. He worked at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen for three years, then spent another three in Uppsala at the Gustav Werner Institute, and finally one year at the University of Aarhus. At Berkeley, ≈öwiƒÖtecki did extensive work in nuclear physics, and continued to do so even after his formal retirement in 1991. ≈öwiƒÖtecki died peacefully in his home on 30 September 2009 from pancreatic cancer. He has 5 children and 8 grandchildren. Research ≈öwiƒÖtecki was a pioneer in several areas of nuclear physics, including studies of nuclear fission of superheavy elements, the nuclear shell model, and the development of a semi-empirical mass formula. Although the original formulation of the nuclear shell model predates ≈öwiƒÖtecki, he and Gertrude Scharff-Goldhaber from Brookhaven National Laboratory calculated that \\"magic numbers\\" of protons and neutrons may exist for some superheavy elements and confer additional stability, whose estimated half-lives ranged from minutes to millions of years. In 1966, ≈öwiƒÖtecki, along with William Myers and Heiner Meldner, developed a model that revealed an increase in fission barrier height for nuclei centered around atomic number 114, suggesting the possibility of stabilizing shell effects in that region. Although several other such regions were proposed, including one around element 126 as early as 1957, ≈öwiƒÖtecki and Myers determined that the Coulomb force would shift the proton shell closure to Z = 114. With this work, the theory of an \\"island of stability\\" for superheavy nuclides gained popularity, and motivated experiments seeking such nuclides in subsequent decades. In addition to his prediction of the island of stability, ≈öwiƒÖtecki's contributions led to further developments in the nuclear shell model, most notably the macroscopic-microscopic method for calculating various properties of nuclei and extrapolating to unknown nuclei. The 1994 Thomas-Fermi model of Myers and ≈öwiƒÖtecki offered several new developments, namely a solution to an anomaly in nuclear curvature. ≈öwiƒÖtecki also did some research in chaos theory and its implications for nuclear dynamics. Honors and awards In 1973, ≈öwiƒÖtecki became a member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters. He was also a member of the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences. In recognition for his work, he won the 1990 Marian Smoluchowski Medal of the Polish Physical Society (for which he was a laureate in 1989), and received an honorary degree from the Jagiellonian University in Krakow in 2000.

Author of numerous books, including Plasma, with which she received two important prizes in Chile: the Premio Novela In√©dita Consejo Nacional del Libro y la Lectura and the Premio atenea. Also, in 2004, Plasma received the prize of the Book Council as a novel in the unpublished category. In addition, at the international level, she received the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation fellowship in 1998.  Biography  = Family = Guadalupe Santa Cruz was born in 1952 in Orange, New Jersey, a small city in the United States. She was born to immigrant parents; an American mother and Chilean father. Her mother was a theater actress and her father was a political official of the United Nations. Her life was affected by the cultural differences of her parents and their constant trips. These started when she was barely a month old, when her parents took her to Mexico, where her family lived for a while. = Education = Guadalupe studied in Chile, specifically at colegio Jeanne D'Arc, where she finished her elementaries studies (4to Medio). After this, she started her university studies at Universidad Catolica to study Philosophy. She studied until she was arrested by the political police of the 1973 coup d'√©tat. So, she was exiled. = Exile = After the exile, Guadalupe moved to Belgium, a country she previously knew. There, she continued studying, but this time, the engraving career at the Academy of Fine Arts in Li√®ge until 1985, the year which she returned to Chile. = Return to Chile = After return to Chile, she held Territoriality workshops with unions and Women's Leadership with women who were social leaders.

Early life  Harriet Gertrude Eddy was born in Lexington, Michigan, the daughter of George Washington Eddy and Louise Mackenzie Eddy. She earned a bachelor's degree and a teaching certificate in 1896 at Albion College and pursued further studies at the University of Chicago.Richardson, John V. Jr. (2009). ‚ÄúHarriet G.

Career  Eddy taught school in Helena, Montana, for a few years, and was a high school principal in Elk Grove, California, from 1906 to 1909. She began a library at the school to support its claim for accreditation. The Elk Grove Library became part of the Sacramento County Library system in 1908, \\"the first county branch of a library in the state of California\\".\\"First County Free Branch Library in State ‚Äì The Harriet G.

Eddy went to work on creating more rural libraries with the California State Librarian, from 1909 to 1918, traveling the state to establish county libraries in forty counties.

In 1918 she began teaching in the University of California Agricultural Extension, touring the state speaking to community groups and local government bodies as state leader of home demonstration agents. During sabbaticals, she traveled to the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and Cuba, to study schools and libraries, in the 1920s and 1930s. She met with Lenin's wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya, in this work, and with Genrietta K. Abele-Derman (1882‚Äì1954), first director of the Moscow Library Institute. She also hosted scholars from the Soviet Union on their visits to California. Eddy was active in the California Library Association, and the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. She retired from the University Extension work in 1941. In retirement, she was active in the Peninsula Council of the American-Soviet Friendship, the World Peace Congress, and the National Peace Conference. In 1952, her passport application was denied, from concern about her Soviet contacts and activities abroad. In 2014, Eddy was posthumously inducted into the California Library Hall of Fame.  Personal life  Eddy lived for many years with her older sister, Myrta Newman, who joined in her travels. She wrote an unpublished memoir of their times together, titled The Rover Girls.
