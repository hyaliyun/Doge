Its title is adopted from its opening line.  Dating  The Greek Gospel of the Egyptians (which is quite distinct from the later, wholly Gnostic Coptic Gospel of the Egyptians), perhaps written in the second quarter of the 2nd century, was already cited in Clement of Alexandria's miscellany, the Stromata, where quotations give us many of the brief excerpts that are all that remain; it was also mentioned by Hippolytus, who alludes to \\"these various changes of the soul, set forth in the Gospel entitled according to the Egyptians\\" and connects the Gospel of the Egyptians with the Gnostic Naassene sect. Later, that 4th-century collector of heresies, Epiphanius of Salamis, asserts that the Sabellians made use of this gospel; though it is unlikely that he had any firsthand information about Sabellius, who taught in the early 3rd century. The euphemism, the Word logos, as an appellation of the Saviour, which appears in the gospel, betokens the influence of the Gospel of John, thus suggesting a date ca. 120 - 150\\\\. No text for it exists outside of these testimonies.  Content  From these few fragments, it is unknown how much more extensive the contents were, or what other matters they discussed, or whether the known fragments present essentially the nature of the whole entity, which is apparently a \\"sayings\\" tradition worked into the familiar formula of a duologue. Also, due to the fragmentary nature, it is unknown whether it constitutes a version of some other known text. The Gospel of the Egyptians was apparently read in Egyptian churches in the 2nd and 3rd centuries. The known fragments of text takes the form of a discussion between the disciple Salome and Jesus, who advocates celibacy, or, more accurately, \\"each fragment endorses sexual asceticism as the means of breaking the lethal cycle of birth and of overcoming the alleged sinful differences between male and female, enabling all persons to return to what was understood to be their primordial and androgynous state\\" (Cameron 1982). The familiar question of Salome \\"How long shall death prevail?\\" provoking Jesus' famous answer \\"As long as women bear children\\" has echoes in other 2nd and 3rd century apocrypha and is instanced by Theodotus of Byzantium as if it were commonly known: \\"67. And when the Saviour says to Salome that there shall be death as long as women bear children, he did not say it as abusing birth, for that is necessary for the salvation of believers.\\" This saying must have had a wide circulation, though it did not suit the purpose of any canonical Gospel. A similar view of the body as an entrapment of the soul was an essential understanding of Gnosticism. The rejection of marriage was also supported by the Encratites and many of the other early Christian groupings praised celibacy, and therefore it is difficult to tell from what group the text originated.  Comparison  Another comparable verse appended to the Gospel of Thomas, probably in Egypt, reads: :\\"114. Simon Peter said to them, \\"Make Mary leave us, for females are not worthy of life.\\" Jesus said, \\"Look I shall guide her to make her male so that she too may become a living spirit resembling you males. For every female who makes herself male will enter the Kingdom of Heaven\\" (translation by Elaine Pagels and Marvin Myer in Elaine Pagels, Beyond Belief 2003, pp241f). The so-called Second Epistle of Clement (12:2) closely paraphrases a passage that was also quoted by Clement of Alexandria (in Stromateis iii): :iii. 13. 92. \\"When Salome inquired when the things concerning which she asked should be known, the Lord said: When ye have trampled on the garment of shame, and when the two become one and the male with the female is neither male nor female.\\" Clement adds, \\"In the first place, then, we have not this saying in the four Gospels that have been delivered to us, but in that according to the Egyptians.\\" The trope appears in the Gospel of Thomas, saying (37): :\\"When you strip naked without being ashamed, and take your garments and put them under your feet like little children and tread upon them, then [you] will see the child of the living\\" (Thomas, Layton translation). For a somewhat later Gnostic work assigning a prominent role to Jesus' female disciples, see Pistis Sophia. See also List of Gospels  References  James, Montague Rhodes, 1924.

Founded in December 1974 by comic artists M≈ìbius, Jean-Pierre Dionnet, Philippe Druillet, and financial director Bernard Farkas in order to publish M√©tal Hurlant, it quickly expanded to include a variety of science fiction works, featuring mature themes that were not commonplace in the Franco-Belgian comic world. Considered revolutionary in the comic book form at the time,Morales, 2015 chiefly due to its focus on the SF genre, the work found in Humano√Ødes inspired many generations of authors and filmmakers.  History  = M√©tal Hurlant and early work = In December 1974, critic and scriptwriter Jean-Pierre Dionnet, writer-artists Philippe Druillet and M≈ìbius, along with businessman Bernard Farkas, decided to create Les Humano√Ødes Associ√©s in order to publish a quarterly SF magazine. The first issue of M√©tal Hurlant was published in January 1975, with Jean-Pierre Dionnet as editor. The magazine mainly published SF and fantasy works, but Dionnet prized diversity and published works by Chantal Montellier as well as those by Philippe Druillet. Dionnet also endeavored to publish foreign authors‚Äîthe first issue showcased American artist Richard Corben, the second issue featured fellow American Vaughn Bod√©, along with Brazilian Sergio Macedo, Swiss Daniel Ceppi, Dutchman Joost Swarte, etc. As early as 1975, two graphic novels were published: Jason Muller, by Claude Auclair, and Rolf, by Richard Corben. An increasing number of graphic novels were published in the following years (10 in 1976, 15 in 1977, 17 in 1978, 28 in 1979, 38 in 1980, etc.). The titles were mostly by authors that featured in the magazine, such as Druillet, M≈ìbius (Arzach was published in 1976), Jacques Tardi, etc. Nevertheless, Humano√Ødes also published other authors, such as Italian Hugo Pratt, as well as American classics Conan the Barbarian, Spirit, Nick Fury, and British classic Dan Dare. Humano√Ødes also published a handful of risqu√© works, such as John Willie's erotic Gwendoline. In 1977, Humano√Ødes published their first compendium of images with H. R. Giger's Necronomicon. Humano√Ødes' publishing enabled it to gain a considerable financial grounding, which proved to be useful when confronted with a number of management mishaps (exorbitant loan rates, high production costs, non-payment of dues, etc.). It also led to a number of landmark imprints, such as Xanadu, which featured large-scale American comics (nine volumes between 1983 and 1985), and Autodaf√©, which published comics in novel form. Autodaf√© (six volumes were published in 1982‚Äì1983) was the first manga to be distributed in French bookshops. From 1976 to 1978, Humano√Ødes published a second magazine, ', with a femanist focus. Its editors (Janic Guillerez, with early input from Anne Delobel) and principal contributors were almost all women. This innovative project, especially given the male-influenced milieu in which it took place, was nevertheless hampered by chronically poor sales and its adult-only material. In May 1977, Cin√© Fantastic was published, but the magazine folded after a single issue. Several years later, Dionnet noticed an increase in the number of titles available in bookshops, and sought to increase the presence of Les Humano√Ødes Associ√©s. The magazines M√©tal (hurlant) Aventure, with a focus on adventure, and Rigolo!, with a humoristic focus, were both launched in 1983, but were only published until 1984 and 1985, respectively. In 1977, M√©tal Hurlant gained worldwide attention when it was translated into English and distributed in North America and the Commonwealth countries under the name Heavy Metal. Heavy Metal featured mainly European authors near the beginning of its publication, but increasingly relied on American authors as time went on. Nevertheless, it introduced European comics to the North American market, where artists such as M≈ìbius began to be noticed. By the end of the 1980s, Heavy Metal became completely independent from Les Humano√Ødes Associ√©s. As of 2020, it is still being published. This mix of financial successes and failures led to a difficult situation for the publishing house. In April 1980, the company's ownership was divided between a Spanish printing company (a major creditor) and a number of private shareholders, principally people who had been associated with the beginnings of the company (such as Druillet, M≈ìbius, Margerin, and Gillon).  Renewal  In 1988, the publishing house and its catalogue (including M√©tal Hurlant) were purchased by 23-year old Swiss publisher/producer Fabrice Giger, who turned it into an intellectual property development company. In less than two decades, the company developed one of the most respected graphic novel/comic book catalogues in the world, featuring authors such as Moebius, Alexandro Jodorowsky, Enki Bilal, Milo Manara, and Juan Gimenez, and books from multiple genres, all intended for mature readers. The success led Giger to abandon his own original publishing house (founded in 1988 for traditional comics publications aimed at a younger public ) in 1994 after unsuccessful efforts to integrate its disparate catalogue into that of Humano√Ødes, instead focussing all his energy on Humano√Ødes. A number of additional crises (including an averted 1993-1995 hostile takeover attempt by Parisian publisher Hachette, considered by Giger as Humano√Ødes' darkest hourde Gaudemar, 1998), led Humano√Ødes to be put into administration, which it exited after 18 months in late 2009. Since then, the company has enjoyed renewed success with a number of new series, such as Crusades, La L√©gende des nu√©es √©carlates, Les √âp√©es de verre, Carthago, and Le Manoir des murmures. Humano√Ødes have also tried their hand at European manga, such as Omega and B.B. Project. These titles were published in the traditional manga format, but Humano√Ødes has also experimented with manga-type publications in a more European style. The Ecube series is an example of this mixed genre, written by Iovinelli and illustrated by Dall Oglio. Crusades, another example of this blended style, has European authors but a Chinese illustrator. = The North American and Japanese markets = Humanoids Publishing, Inc. (\\"Humanoids\\") was founded in the United States in 1999 by Giger, eleven years after his acquisition of the French parent company, with the aim to publish French cult classics as well as recruit American talent. A number of successful French works were published, including Bouncer, Metabarons, Technopriests, The White Lama, The Incal, and others. In 2002, Humanoids began publishing an English-language version of the new M√©tal Hurlant (not to be confused with the then still running Heavy Metal magazine), which would only last two years. In January 2004, Humanoids signed an agreement with DC Comics aimed at integrating the Humanoids publications into the DC Comics catalog. This agreement enabled Humanoids to gain greater visibility on the market, while DC Comics obtained the distribution rights for the English-language versions of Humanoids' works. Certain works published since 1998 were reprinted, while new titles were also translated into English (El Ni√±o, Megalex, Basil and Victoria, etc.). However, the books were expensive and success was limited, leading DC Comics to announce the end of the agreement in April 2005. In 2007, an agreement was signed with Image Comics to publish Lucha Libre in North America. In July 2008, Humanoids began a partnership with Devil's Due to publish new translations of French works. These graphic novels were published in the classic American comic book format in order to not put off American readers. New works were translated, such as The Zombies That Ate The World and I Am Legion. In 2010, Humanoids cancelled the agreement with Devil's Due and began publishing their own translated works in North America. Following its standard practice, the company chose to publish old translations as well as new European and American works. The post-2010 Humanoids editions are also released on the UK market, with the exception of a few early releases which were licensed to local publishers, such as Titan Books. The publisher's official website states that \\"[s]ince 1998 Humanoids has been the only publishing house of European origin with a direct presence in the U.S., and since 2014 the only non-Japanese company publishing its graphic novels directly in Japan, under the brand „É¶„Éû„Éé„Ç§„Éâ (\\"Humanoido\\")\\". Reminiscent of the agreement Humanoids had made with DC Comics, recent Japanese-language books are co-released with Japanese publishing house PIE Books International.  Change of headquarters  In 2013, Giger decided to relocate the headquarters of his publishing house from Paris to Los Angeles, which reversed the hitherto existing situation with Paris now becoming a scaled-down subsidiary of the American parent company. As stated on the company's official website, the move reflected Giger's ambitions to restructure the company into a \\"major audiovisual\\" company, by making \\"deals with various international and Los Angeles-based partners\\", which led to the creation of the Humanoids Production Division in 2015. = Graphic novels in digital format = The 1990s saw the widescale development of IT technology being made accessible to the larger public, as well as the arrival of the Internet in the homes of individual users. Humano√Ødes began investigating the feasibility of digitizing its collection. However, screen resolutions and bandwidth were too low to permit satisfactory usage. The CD- ROM format was then chosen, with Enki Bilal's The Nikopol Trilogy and Manara's Gulliveriana being published as part of the \\"Digital Comics\\" collection. Sales were disappointing, however, and comic book publishers returned the traditional paper format. By the late 2000s, smartphones were proliferating, which presented Humano√Ødes with an opportunity to make new inroads into the digitization of comics. The new media, dubbed \\"VideoComics\\", enabled smartphone users to experience comics with added soundtracks, videos, and even voice actors. A number of IT and web companies expressed interest in this new form of comics distribution, and Humano√Ødes gave two of them the rights to digitally distribute their works. The latest development in digital distribution of comics has been the widespread use of tablet computers. This technology led Humano√Ødes to systematically digitize the entire contents of their catalogue, in order to provide its comic books on its website. New publications are often available online even before being released in bookshops, thanks to online streaming. By 2015, the publisher had completed the digitizing of its entire catalogue.

The universe has developed to such a degree that the publishers have created a specific blog dedicated to linking the various storylines together.See Blog Univers de l'Incal (in French). The Incal world currently has 35 published volumes, and Les Humano√Ødes continues its development in the Castaka and Final Incal.  Lucha Libre  Jerry Frissen's creation, Lucha Libre is the second important world published by Les Humano√Ødes Associ√©s. The series showcases retired, failed Mexican catchers in their urban peregrinations. First published in France in small volumes labelled \\"anthologies\\", they were later re-published in a more traditional, hardcover form.  Sanctuaire  Sanctum began with a first volume published in 2001, with Xavier Dorison as writer and Christophe Bec as illustrator. It has since become prominent in the Humanoids collection. In 2007, the series was re-imagined as Sanctum Redux by writers Stephane Betbeder and Riccardo Crosa, using the same storyline as the original but with manga-style illustrations. Sanctum differs from The Incal, Lucha Libre, and Carthago in that rather than narrating different stories taking place within the same universe, it retells the same story in different manners. = Published periodicals =M√©tal hurlant (1975-1987, 2002-2004) *Ah !

In the EU it is indicated for the treatment of: * plaque psoriasis (a disease causing red, scaly patches on the skin); * psoriatic arthritis (a disease causing red, scaly patches on the skin with inflammation of the joints); * rheumatoid arthritis (a disease causing inflammation of the joints); * axial spondyloarthritis (inflammation of the spine causing back pain), including ankylosing spondylitis and when X-ray does not show disease but there are clear signs of inflammation; * polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and active enthesitis-related arthritis (both rare diseases causing inflammation in the joints); * Crohn‚Äôs disease (a disease causing inflammation of the gut); * ulcerative colitis (a disease causing inflammation and ulcers in the lining of the gut); * hidradenitis suppurativa (acne inversa), a long-term skin disease that causes lumps, abscesses (collections of pus) and scarring on the skin; * non-infectious uveitis (inflammation of the layer beneath the white of the eyeball). * chronic cases of aggressive progressive pulmonary and bone sarcoidosis. = Rheumatoid arthritis = Adalimumab has been shown to reduce the signs and symptoms of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis in adults. It may be used alone or in combination with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD). It has also been shown to have efficacy in moderate to severe polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children four years and older, and is indicated for the treatment of that condition. In rheumatoid arthritis, it is indicated for use alone, or with methotrexate or similar medicines, in the United States since 2002. It has a similar effectiveness as methotrexate and, in combination, nearly doubles the response rate of methotrexate alone. = Psoriatic arthritis = In 2003, adalimumab began undergoing trials for use in treating psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. = Ankylosing spondylitis = Adalimumab has been shown to reduce the signs and symptoms of, and is approved for treatment of, ankylosing spondylitis in adults. = Crohn's disease = Adalimumab has been shown to reduce the signs and symptoms of moderate to severe Crohn's disease. It has been approved for that use in the UK since 2009. = Ulcerative colitis = Adalimumab may be effective and well tolerated in ulcerative colitis. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of moderate to severe cases in adults. = Plaque psoriasis = Adalimumab has been shown to treat moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adults who have the condition in many areas of their body and who may benefit from taking injections or pills (systemic therapy) or phototherapy (treatment using ultraviolet light alone or with pills). Adalimumab has been shown to be effective therapy when used either continuously or intermittently in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. = Hidradenitis suppurativa = Adalimumab was approved for hidradenitis suppurativa in 2015. = Juvenile idiopathic arthritis = Adalimumab has been shown to reduce the signs and symptoms of moderate to severe polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children aged four years and older. = Non- infectious uveitis = Adalimumab is indicated for the treatment of non- infectious uveitis (inflammation of the layer beneath the white of the eyeball).  Adverse effects  Components of a Humira autoinjector pen. There is strong evidence that adalimumab increases risk of serious infections, such as tuberculosis. It also increases the risk of cancers, including lymphoma and solid malignancies. The risk of cancer is higher with higher doses of adalimumab. There are rare reports of serious liver injury; rare reports of demyelinating central nervous system disorders; and rare reports of cardiac failure‚Äîthe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a black box warning to doctors, which appears in the product labeling of adalimumab and other TNF- inhibiting drugs, instructing them to screen and monitor potential patients more carefully. Anaphylaxis or other serious allergic reactions may also occur.  History  Adalimumab was the first fully human monoclonal antibody approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It was derived from phage display. Adalimumab was discovered as a result of a collaboration between BASF Bioresearch Corporation and Cambridge Antibody Technology, U.K., itself a collaboration of the government-funded Medical Research Council and three academics, which began in 1993. Initially named D2E7, it was then further manufactured at BASF Bioresearch Corporation, developed by BASF Knoll (BASF Pharma), and ultimately manufactured and marketed by Abbott Laboratories after Abbott's acquisition of BASF Pharma. On 1 January 2013, Abbott split into two companies, one retaining the Abbott name and the other named AbbVie. As a result, AbbVie took over development and marketing of Humira. The brand name Humira stands for \\"human monoclonal antibody in rheumatoid arthritis\\", and was named by one of Abbott's employees, Richard J. Karwoski, who was also responsible for leading the effort to get Humira approved by the FDA. It was the third TNF inhibitor, after infliximab and etanercept, to be approved in the United States. It was constructed from a fully human monoclonal antibody, while infliximab is a mouse-human chimeric antibody and etanercept is a TNF receptor-IgG fusion protein. The drug candidate was discovered initially using CAT's phage display technology and named D2E7. The key components of the drug were found by guiding the selection of human antibodies from phage display repertoires to a single epitope of an antigen TNF alpha. The ultimate clinical candidate, D2E7, was created and manufactured at BASF Bioresearch Corporation and taken through most of the drug development process by BASF Knoll, then further development, manufacturing and marketing by Abbott Laboratories, after Abbott acquired the pharmaceutical arm of BASF Knoll. Since 2008, adalimumab had been approved by the FDA for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, moderate to severe chronic psoriasis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Although only approved for ulcerative colitis from late 2012, by the FDA in the disease's management, it had been used for several years in cases that have not responded to conventional treatment at standard dosing for Crohn's disease. Adalimumab, sold under the brand name Humira, was approved for use in the United States in 2002. Adalimumab, sold under the brand names Humira and Trudexa, was approved for use in the European Union in September 2003. Text was copied from this source which is ¬© European Medicines Agency.

The generic was launched under the brand name Exemptia. * 2015: Launched Humira for moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa, an orphan indication. No other treatment has been rigorously tested and found to be safe and effective in treating this painful and scarring condition. * 2016: The best selling drugs list researched by Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News, published in March 2017, details that Humira occupied the position for 2015 () and 2016 () * 2017: AbbVie reports that Humira achieved of sales in 2017.  Society and culture  =Economics= From 2012, until the US patent expiry in 2016, Humira led the list of top-selling pharmaceutical products, and in 2016, it had of global sales. In 2014, a biosimilar came to market in India at a lower price compared to United States prices. = Royalty litigation = In March 2003, Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT) stated its wish to \\"initiate discussions regarding the applicability of the royalty offset provisions for Humira\\" with Abbott Laboratories in the High Court of London. In November 2004, the trial began, and in December 2004, Justice Hugh Laddie ruled for CAT. A short version of the full statement of the proceedings was released. In it Justice Laddie remarked, \\"Abbott was in error when it made its first royalty payment to CAT calculated on the basis that only 2% of the Net Sales was due. It should have calculated on the basis of the full royalty of just over 5% and should have paid and continued to pay CAT accordingly.\\" Justice Laddie went on to observe \\"...that the construction advanced by Abbott does violence to the language of the agreements, renders them obscure and makes little or no commercial sense. For this reason CAT wins the action.\\" Abbott was required to pay CAT , some of which was to be passed to its partners in development. Of this sum, the Medical Research Council received , and in addition, Abbott was asked to pay the MRC a further over five years from 2006, providing that Humira remains on the market. The MRC also is to receive a further ¬£5.1million (sterling) in respect of past royalties. = Patent litigation = On 29 May 2009, Johnson & Johnson's Centocor unit, the maker of infliximab, won a ruling for $1.67billion from Abbott Laboratories for patent infringement on the process for making Humira. However, in 2011, the judgment was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In June of 2020, a class action lawsuit filed by United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1500 (UFCW Local 1500) against AbbVie, alleging that the drug manufacturer used a patent thicket over 100 strong to maintain a monopoly on Adalimumab, was dismissed by the Northern District Court in Illinois. = Biosimilars = In 2014, Indian drugmaker Cadila Healthcare declared the launch of the first adalimumab biosimilar at a fifth of its US price. The generic was launched under the brand name Exemptia. In 2016, Indian drugmaker Torrent Pharmaceuticals launched its biosimilar for adalimumab, called Adfrar. It was the second generic biosimilar of adalimumab. In 2016, the FDA approved Amgen's biosimilar adalimumab-atto, sold under the brand name Amjevita. Amjevita won't be available in the US until at least February 2023. In 2017, the FDA approved German pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim's biosimilar, Cyltezo. In 2017, the biosimilars Amgevita, Solymbic, Imraldi, and Cyltezo were approved for use in the European Union. In 2018, the biosimilars Halimatoz, Hefiya, Hyrimoz, and Hulio were approved for use in the European Union. Adalimumab biosimilars became available in Europe in late 2018, allowing the National Health Service to make record-breaking cost-savings, as this is the single most expensive drug used in NHS hospitals, costing more than ¬£400million a year for about 46,000 patients. It may not become available in the United States until 2023. In 2018, adalimumab-adaz (Hyrimoz) was approved for use in the United States. In April 2019, Idacio and Kromeya were approved for use in the European Union. In July 2019, adalimumab-bwwd (Hadlima), produced by Samsung Bioepsis, was approved for use in the US. However, it will not be available until at least June 2023, after the availability of Amgen's offering as a result of a negotiated intellectual property settlement with AbbVie. In November 2019, adalimumab-afzb (Abrilada) was approved for use in the United States. It was the 25th biosimilar to be approved by the FDA. In February 2020, the biosimilar Amsparity was approved for use in the European Union. In June 2020, the biosimilar Idacio was approved for use in Australia. In July 2020, adalimumab-fkjp (Hulio) was approved for use in the United States.

He is best known for two Japanese-language dictionaries that he edited, Genkai (, \\"sea of words\\", 1891) and its successor Daigenkai (, \\"great sea of words\\", 1932‚Äì1937), and for his studies of Japanese grammar. Biography ≈åtsuki Fumihiko was born in the section of Edo in what is now part of Ginza, Tokyo. He was the third son of the Confucian scholar and gunnery expert and the grandson of the Confucian and Western scholar . Following family tradition, he embarked on Western studies, studying English and mathematics at the Kaiseijo school (one of the predecessors of the University of Tokyo). As a youth, ≈åtsuki was employed as an advisor to Sendai Domain, and fought at the Battle of Toba‚ÄìFushimi in the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration on the losing Tokugawa Bakufu side. He later assisted in the formation of the ≈åuetsu Reppan D≈çmei. After the Meiji Restoration, he worked as a translator while learning English from Americans in the port city of Yokohama. Around 1872, he joined in the editing of an English‚ÄìJapanese dictionary for the Ministry of Education, and he later worked on textbooks and taught at schools in Miyagi Prefecture. Although ≈åtsuki paid for the original publication expenses for Genkai himself, it was soon republished and expanded in commercial editions that went through over a thousand printings. Modeled in part on Western monolingual dictionaries, Genkai gave not only basic information about wordstheir representations in kana and kanji and their definitions in Japanesebut also pronunciations and etymologies and citations of their use. Its successor, the four-volume Daigenkai, though published under ≈åtsuki's name and based in part on his work, appeared some years after his death and was completed by other lexicographers. Bust of ≈åtsuki Fumihiko at Sendai Dai-Ichi Elementary School, Miyagi Prefecture ≈åtsuki's grammatical works, especially ' and ', strongly influenced the teaching of Japanese grammar for generations to come.

DIC(K) was founded at a meeting in Thrissur by the K. Karunakuran faction of the Indian National Congress on 1 May 2005. Initially it was called National Congress (Indira), but the name was changed DIC(K) for registration purposes in August of the same year. Karunakuran's son K. Muraleedharan was the party president. The party allied with the Left Democratic Front in the local elections and made success. But the party was not considered for a tie up during the state assembly elections that followed. The party could not make any impression in the elections as expected. Later, Karunakaran and Muraleedharan, along with some other party members, moved to Nationalist Congress Party. After a brief while, Karunakaran returned to Congress. History DIC(K) election campaign The party was formed as a result of internal problems in the Congress Party. The break was preceded by much acrimony within the ruling Congress Party, due to perceived slights to Karunakaran, disregarding his lifelong services to the party. Karuunakaran's son Muraleedharan and Kerala Congress leader T. M. Jacob were the other leaders of the party. Following its split, the DIC(K) has been warmly received into the opposition Left Democratic Front combine. This acceptance has all but guaranteed DIC(K)'s return to power as the unpopular ruling combine is likely to lose badly in the assembly elections, which are due shortly. The party has however not been void of internal dissent. Ahead of the 2005 panchayat elections, DIC(K) aligned with the Left Democratic Front. However, ahead of the 2006 Kerala legislative assembly elections the party entered into an understanding with the United Democratic Front to try to ensure K. Muraleedharan's victory in the assembly polls. That led to a grouping within the party forming a 'DIC(K) Left Forum'. The Forum had plans of founding a new party after the elections. Later, DIC decided to merge with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) led by Sharad Pawar. This resulted in a chaos in DIC and many of the leaders of the DIC have decided to go back to the Indian National Congress. The party is defunct now.

Her recording career started in 1971 with Motown Records. Career Murphy shared the stage with many Detroit-based bands, including Wilson Mower Pursuit and Jake Wade and the Soul Searchers, in venues such as Detroit's Grande Ballroom, as well as the first Ann Arbor Blues Festival in 1969, along with various large state fairground music venues. She was soon noticed by an employee of Motown in a touring theater production along with Texas native Meat Loaf. The two were signed by Rare Earth Records, a division of Motown Records, as Stoney and Meatloaf in 1971. That pairing was short-lived and became defunct, although they had previously also been fellow cast members of the Detroit production of Hair. Only Murphy was retained under contract after the breakup of the duo. After a period of inactivity with the new division of Motown in Los Angeles, she left Motown and contacted Detroit music producer Punch Andrews for possible opportunities. Murphy then relocated back to Detroit in 1973 to work with Bob Seger. She has continued to work with Seger in the studio since 1973, in addition to performing on all of his tours since 1978. She returned again to live in Los Angeles in 1985 while working with Eric Clapton on his Behind the Sun album. Murphy joined Clapton's band for the ensuing tour, which included Live Aid. Murphy's career in vocals has been both as band lead singer and session singer. She has sung, toured, and recorded with such acts as the Moody Blues, Bob Seger, Herbie Hancock, Phil Collins, Glenn Frey, Joe Walsh, Maria Muldaur, Bruce Hornsby, Michael Bolton, Coco Montoya, Alice Cooper, Little Feat and rock musicals, Hair and Sgt. Pepper's, etc. In 1993, she became a full-time member of the Los Angeles-based band Little Feat. She stayed on for the next fifteen years, recording and touring with them until 2009. In September 2009 the Shaun Murphy Band released the album Livin' The Blues. A second album, The Trouble With Lovin', followed in 2010. Late in 2011, Murphy released a DVD and live album both titled Shaun Murphy Live at Callahan's, recorded at Callahan's Music Hall, Auburn Hills, Michigan. Her album Ask for the Moon, released in 2012, was nominated for three Grammy Awards and won two Blues Blast music awards. She released Cry Of Love in 2013. Loretta was released in February 2015.

Beginning no later than 1846, fur traders, settlers, and miners established trails connecting what was then known as Vermilion Forks to the Pacific Coast of British Columbia. John Fall Allison became, in 1858, the first permanent settler of European ancestry. To this day, the site of his home functions locally as a kilometre zero, with creeks east of Princeton having names like \\"Five Mile\\" based on their distance from that location. The town he founded was renamed \\"Prince Town\\" (later corrupted to \\"Princeton\\") to honour an 1860 visit to eastern Canada by Prince Edward (later King Edward VII). In the years 1909‚Äì1915 the railways arrived, with the Kettle Valley Railway (later Canadian Pacific) connecting Princeton to the Great Northern. Until 1961, Princeton was home to a brewery, the Princeton Brewing Company. Until the 1940s, the brewery kept its beer cool in the Vermilion Cave. The cave, which held up to 20 railway cars at a time, was largely demolished to make way for the Hope-Princeton Highway, part of the Crowsnest Highway (British Columbia Highway 3).\\"Cave once used to keep beer cool held up to 20 rail cars\\", Princeton 2008 Visitors Guide, p. 4. Princeton joined the Canadian Board of Trade (later Chamber of Commerce) in 1913, and was incorporated as a village in 1951, and as a town in 1978. Beginning in the 1980s, Princeton began to revitalize its downtown, a plan that included red brick sidewalks and new streetlights. In the 1990s, they adopted a \\"heritage\\" theme, with many businesses converting their exteriors to match architectural styles from roughly a century earlier. Further landscaping of the town centre continues as of 2008. The historic Princeton Hotel on Bridge Street, which had been in operation since 1912, burned to the ground on April 8, 2006. The name Vermilion Forks survives in the name of Vermilion Forks Indian Reserve No. 1, which is immediately adjacent to the town of Princeton to the east, and is one of the reserves of the Upper Similkameen Indian Band, whose head offices are in Hedley.  Transportation  The former Kettle Valley Railway bridge crossing the Tulameen River. Princeton was formerly served by the Great Northern Railway and the Kettle Valley railway, neither of which still have tracks within the Similkameen Valley. Today princeton is accessible exclusively by road and air. On land, it is located at the junction of two highways and two major regional roads: Highway 5A to Merritt, Highway 3 to Hope and Osoyoos, as well as Coalmont Road to Coalmont and Tulameen, and the Princeton-Summerland Road. Public transportation is provided by the South Okanagan-Similkameen Transit System based out of Penticton, with three buses weekly along the Coalmont-Penticton Corridor, with connections to scheduled BC Transit services in Penticton to Kelowna and other communities. A BC Transit Health Connections service is also available. Until June 1, 2018, Greyhound Canada operated buses along the Hope-Princeton highway to Penticton and further to the Alberta border. Princeton has one airport, the Princeton Aerodrome. The airport is not serviced by any scheduled carriers and has extremely limited facilities. It was formerly home to an Air Cadets gliding program. The nearest airport with regional scheduled passenger services is Penticton Regional Airport, and the nearest airport with scheduled passenger service to both regional and international destinations is Kelowna International Airport. Princeton Museum The Princeton and District Museum and Archives on Vermilion Avenue houses the Joe Pollard fossil collection. The collection also includes an early 1900s stagecoach, a 1934 fire engine, local First Nations artifacts, a collection of local newspapers, a collection of local butterflies, exhibits about pioneer life, a livery stable, and an old firehouse.\\"Museum home to our history\\", Princeton 2008 Visitors Guide, p. 14.

The couple, aided by Mr Allison's knowledge of Chinook Jargon, a trade language, became close with nearby Aboriginal populations. There, the two produced 14 children. In the Valley, Mrs. Allison had what she described as her happiest days, traversing nearby mountains on horseback and establishing relationships with nearby First Nations. She claimed to have sighted Ogopogo, a cryptid lake monster similar to the Loch Ness Monster in Okanagan Lake. In 1876, Mr. Allison was appointed a Justice of the Peace and became the first Gold Commissioner of the newly created Similkameen Mining District. In 1891, an ethnographic paper written by Mrs Allison on the Similkameen was published by the British Association for the Advancement of Science, and another was published in the Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1900 she published a poem about an Aboriginal chief. Mr Allison died in 1897 and was buried at a site overlooking the Similkameen River near a landmark named \\"Castle Rock\\". Mrs Allison moved to Vancouver in 1928 where she died on February 1, 1937, aged 92. In 2010 the Government of Canada designated Susan Louisa Moir Allison as a person of national historic significance. Climate Princeton has a cold semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen BSk). It is located just east of the Cascade mountains, giving the town a rain shadow effect whereby the community receives very little precipitation relative to areas on the windward side of the Cascade mountains. Princeton is one of the sunniest places in British Columbia with 2088 hours of sunshine annually. The 323 days per year with measurable sunshine, defined by having a minimum of 6 minutes of sunshine in a day,http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=1056‚ü®=e&StationName;=princeton&SearchType;=Contains&stnNameSubmit;=go&dCode;=1&dispBack;=1#normals- data is the most in the province, and one of the highest in Canada. The 29.4 days with measurable sunshine in March is the highest in the country. Princeton Castle The \\"Princeton Castle\\" ruins. On the eastern outskirts of Princeton are the ruins of East Princeton. Conceived in 1910 as a \\"Great Cement City\\", the area is now a resort known as \\"Princeton Castle\\".\\"Princeton Castle\\", Princeton 2008 Visitors Guide, p. 27. Four years, a million dollars, hundreds of thousands of hours of work by engineers, carpenters, and masons (several of whom died in accidents) went into constructing a cement plant. The project came to an abrupt halt in 1914, for reasons not entirely clear: possibly lack of limestone or (due to World War I) coal.  Education and health  Princeton is part of School District #58, and has two elementary schools (John Allison for grades K-3 and Vermilion Forks for grades 4-7), a secondary school (for grades 8-12) and The Bridge, a continuing education school (grades 8-12 and adult learners that have not completed high school). Princeton has a hospital and long-term care center (Princeton General Hospital and Ridgewood Lodge), two Seniors' Clubs and several seniors' and handicapped housing facilities, and a variety of drug and alcohol counseling services, an adult mental care drop-in center, a program for women in abusive relationships, and numerous other social service institutions.

Born in Los Angeles, his playing first came to prominence in the 1950s as a prot√©g√© of pianist Lennie Tristano and earned attention in the 1970s as a member of Supersax. Biography Marsh came from an affluent artistic background: his father was Hollywood cinematographer Oliver T. Marsh (1892‚Äì1941), and his mother Elizabeth was a violinist. He was the nephew of actresses Mae Marsh and Marguerite Marsh and film editor Frances Marsh. He was tutored by Lennie Tristano. Marsh was often recorded in the company of other Cool School musicians, and remained one of the most faithful to the Tristano philosophy of improvisation ‚Äì the faith in the purity of the long line, the avoidance of licks and emotional chain-pulling, the concentration on endlessly mining the same small body of jazz standards. While Marsh was a generally cool-toned player, the critic Scott Yanow notes that Marsh played with \\"more fire than one would expect\\" in certain contexts. Marsh's rhythmically subtle lines are immediately recognizable. He has been called by Anthony Braxton \\"the greatest vertical improviser\\" (i.e., improvising that emphasizes harmony/chords more than melody).Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings, p. 857. In the 1970s, he gained renewed exposure as a member of Supersax, a large ensemble which played orchestral arrangements of Charlie Parker solos. Marsh also recorded one of his most celebrated albums, All Music, with the Supersax rhythm section during this period. Marsh died of a heart attack onstage at the Los Angeles club Donte's in 1987, in the middle of playing the tune \\"Out of Nowhere\\".Warne Marsh, Peter Madsen, Allaboutjazz.com, November 2001 He left a widow, Geraldyne Marsh, and two sons, K.C. Marsh and Jason Marsh. He is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. Though he remains something of a cult figure among jazz fans and musicians, his influence has grown since his death; younger players such as Mark Turner have borrowed from his music as a way of counterbalancing the pervasive influence of John Coltrane. Marsh's discography remains somewhat scattered and elusive, as much of it was done for small labels, but more and more of his work has been issued on compact disc in recent years. A documentary is being made about him: Warne Marsh: An Improvised Life, directed by his eldest son, K.C. Marsh.

His style of criticism, acerbic, flowery and (perhaps most importantly) carried out on the first night of productions, set the standard for theatre reviewers through to today. Scott accumulated enemies among theatre managers, actors and playwrights as years went on, picking quarrels with William Archer, Ibsen, George Bernard Shaw and others. After he gave a particularly ill-considered 1898 interview, in which he attacked the morals of theatre people, especially actresses, he was forced to retire as a theatre critic and his reputation and prospects suffered badly until, by the end of his life, he was impoverished. Life and career Born the son of William Scott, the perpetual curate of Hoxton in north London, Scott converted to Roman Catholicism before his 21st birthday. Educated at Marlborough College, he became a civil servant, working in the War Office beginning in 1860.Burner, Alma J. \\"A Chapter of the London Stage: The Clement Scott Papers\\", Vol. XXVII, Winter 1973‚Äì1974, No. 2, University of Rochester Library Bulletin, University of Rochester, accessed 1 May 2014Emeljanow, Victor. \\"Scott, Clement William (1841‚Äì1904)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 1 May 2014 =Early career= Encouraged to write by the humourist Tom Hood the younger, who also was a clerk in the War Office, Scott contributed to The Era, Weekly Dispatch, and to Hood's own paper, Fun, where Scott and W. S. Gilbert were colleagues. Scott's interest in writing and the theatre led him to brief dalliance with the failed Victoria Review. He became the dramatic writer for The Sunday Times in 1863 but held the position for only two years because of the intemperance of his published opinions and his unpopular praise of the French theatre. In 1871, Scott began his nearly thirty years as a theatre critic with The Daily Telegraph. He also contributed regularly to The Theatre, a magazine that he founded, and wrote sentimental poetry and song lyrics (including \\"Oh Promise Me\\"), which were often published in the magazine Punch by his friend, the editor, F. C. Burnand. Scott continued to work at the War Office until 1879, when he finally decided to earn his living entirely by writing. As well as criticism, Scott wrote plays, including The Vicarage, The Cape Mail, Anne Mi√©, Odette, and The Great Divorce Case. He wrote several English adaptations of Victorien Sardou's plays, some of which were written in collaboration with B. C. Stephenson, such as Nos intimes (as Peril) and Dora (1878, as Diplomacy). The latter was described by the theatrical paper The Era as \\"the great dramatic hit of the season\\".The Era, 23 June 1878, p. 12 It also played with success at Wallack's Theatre in New York.\\"Theatrical Gossip\\", The Era, 7 April 1878, p. 6 Scott and Stephenson also wrote an English version of Hal√©vy and Meilhac's libretto for Lecocq's operetta Le Petit Duc (1878). Their adaptation so pleased the composer that he volunteered to write some new music for the English production.\\"Theatrical Gossip\\", The Era, 28 April 1878, p. 7 For all of these, Scott adopted the pen name \\"Saville Rowe\\" (after Savile Row) to match Stephenson's pseudonym, \\"Bolton Rowe\\", another Mayfair street.\\"Theatrical Gossip\\", The Era, 24 September 1876, p. 4 The pieces with Stephenson were produced by the Bancrofts, the producers of T. W. Robertson's plays, which Scott admired. He also wrote accounts of holiday tours around the British Isles and abroad, becoming known for his florid style. Scott's travels also inspired his creative writing. Some sources say that after a tour of New Zealand, he wrote the tune to the \\"Swiss Cradle Song\\", later adapted as \\"Now Is the Hour\\"Scowcroft, Philip L. \\"A 206th Garland of British Composers, June 2001, MusicWeb International, accessed 1 May 2014 and as \\"Haere Ra\\", the MƒÅori farewell song, which white New Zealanders \\"mistakenly thought [to be] an old Maori folksong\\".\\"Music: Now Is the Hour\\", Time Magazine, 19 January 1948 It is also used for the hymn \\"Search Me, O God\\", with lyrics by J.

He became enamoured of the district and gave it the name Poppyland. His writing was responsible for members of the London theatre set visiting and investing in homes in the area. Ironically, he was unhappy at the result of his popularisation of this previously pristine area.\\"Norfolk History and Past Times ‚Äì Louie Jeremy\\", Norfolkcoast.co.uk, 2005, accessed 21 September 2009\\"Norfolk History and Past Times ‚Äì Garden of Sleep\\", Norfolkcoast.co.uk, 2005, accessed 21 September 2009 Clement Scott memorial at Cromer, Norfolk Scott married Isabel Busson du Maurier, the sister of George du Maurier, and the couple had four children. She died in 1890, and he remarried Constance Margarite Brandon, an American journalist and actress, in San Francisco. Scott's long-time wish to be elected a member of the famous literary gentlemen's club, the Garrick Club (to which Henry Irving, Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan, among many other notable men belonged), was finally realised in 1892. After an ill-considered 1898 interview in Great Thoughts, Scott was forced to retire as a theatre critic and moved to Biarritz to write The Drama of Yesterday and Today. He then worked for a couple of years at the end of the century for the New York Herald, later returning to London. In 1900, he founded The Free Lance, a Popular Society and Critical Journal, for writers who worked by the job, which he edited. Scott fell into illness and poverty in his last years and died at his residence in Woburn Square at the age of 62.\\"Death of Clement Scott\\", The New York Times, 26 June 1904, p. 7 (subscription required); and \\"A Dramatic End\\", London Evening News, 25 June 1904, p. 3 Style, controversies and influence Scott playing the Daily Telegraph violin (1897) Scott's position on the Daily Telegraph and the support of its proprietor, J. M. Levy, allowed him to pioneer the essay-style review of drama, which came to replace the earlier bare notices. His column of notes and reviews became very popular throughout Britain, and later his own magazine, The Theatre, achieved wide circulation. He wrote his theatre reviews immediately after he saw the opening night of a piece which, together with his short temper and his dislike of critic William Archer, the chief English supporter of Ibsen, tended to involve him often in controversies. Scott played an important part in encouraging a more attentive attitude by theatre audiences. In his early days, it was not uncommon for audiences to be very boisterous and noisy, frequently booing and talking during productions, especially through the overture. He also insisted on first night reviews. It had been common for reviewers to wait a few days before writing about a production. Scott insisted that the paying audience on the first night should expect to see a fully fledged production, and not one where the leading characters did not know all their lines. Theatre managers disliked the opening night reviews when they felt that a new piece had not had time to settle down yet.Gillan, Don. \\"The Fall of Clement Scott\\", StageBeauty.net, 2007, accessed 13 June 2014 On the other hand, Scott supported actor-managers of his time by providing them with translations of popular French plays and with his own plays. Scott in the Entr'acte in 1898, when he accused Ibsen and Shaw of being harmful to society Early in his career, he wrote approvingly of the \\"cup and saucer\\" realism movement, led by T. W. Robertson, whose plays were notable for treating contemporary British subjects in realistic settings. Later, he favoured the grand and spectacular type of London theatrical production which had developed with new types of theatre building, electric lighting and technologies allowed more and more adventurous staging. As time went on, he became strongly conservative and opposed to the new drama of Ibsen and Shaw, arguing that domestic intrigue, sexual situations and wordy philosophising were inappropriate for an evening at the theatre, and even harmful to society, especially young women. Scott especially became embroiled in legal claims through his outspoken criticism of various actors and actresses. His scathing attacks on Ibsen and Shaw became evident in their lack of journalistic neutrality. Scott outraged the theatre community with an extraordinary attack on the morals of theatre people in general, and especially of actresses, in an interview that was published in the evangelical weekly Great Thoughts in 1898. He said that the theatre warps people's character and that it was impossible for a pure woman to be successful in a stage career, and that all leading actresses were immoral and could have achieved their success only by virtue of the extent of their \\"compliance\\". Even before the publication, the transcript of the interview was released to the press, and Scott immediately received a firestorm of condemnation. Although he apologised and recanted his remarks, he was barred from theatres, and the Daily Telegraph was forced to dismiss him. He soon retired and found his reputation and prospects much diminished. By the end of his life, however, he received a measure of forgiveness, and shortly before his death the theatre community held a generous benefit for him. His papers are located in the library of Rochester University, New York State.

The Tolwa dynasty of the BakaLanga people based itself at the stone city of Khami from 1450 to 1683. Cattle and gold brought prosperity. The new culture at Khami developed both the stone building techniques and the pottery styles found at Great Zimbabwe. Masons continued to refine Great Zimbabwe‚Äôs tradition of building precise stone walls. At Khami several artefacts are found, such as ritual drinking pots, iron and bronze weapons, copper objects and ivory divining pieces. Artifacts from Europe and China are reminders that Khami was once a trade centre. During this period the first Europeans arrived. The first known European visitor was Antonio Fernandes, a Portuguese \\"degredado\\" (convict exile) serving his term in Sofala, who entered the Zimbabwean plateau in 1513. There had always been an Arab influence in the region, particularly through trade, but this conflicted with Portuguese commercial interests and religion. The fall of the Tolwa state linked to the coming of the Mutapa people from the north and to the Nguni incursions from the south. In the 1670s a new power arose on the Zimbabwean plateau led by a military ruler called the Changamire. His army of followers, known as the Lozwi, overthrew the Tolwa dynasty, drove the Portuguese from the Zimbabwean plateau in 1693, and established the Rozwi Empire (also called Mambo).

Some alumbrados were only mildly heterodox, but others held views that were clearly heretical, according to the contemporary rulers. Consequently, they were firmly repressed and became some of the early victims of the Spanish Inquisition. Background The historian Marcelino Men√©ndez y Pelayo found the name as early as 1492 (in the form aluminados, 1498), and traced the group to a Gnostic origin. He thought their views were promoted in Spain through influences from Italy. Beliefs The alumbrados held that the human soul can reach such a degree of perfection that it can even in the present life contemplate the essence of God and comprehend the mystery of the Trinity. All external worship, they declared, is superfluous, the reception of the sacraments useless, and sin impossible in this state of complete union with God. Persons in this state of impeccability could indulge their sexual desires and commit other sinful acts freely without staining their souls. In 1525, the Inquisition issued an Edict on the alumbrados in which the Inquisitor General, Alonso Manrique de Lara, explained how the new heresy of alumbradismo was discovered and investigated. The text then gave a numbered list of forty-eight heretical propositions which had emerged from the trials of the alumbrados' first leaders, and . After each proposition were given the grounds on which it was judged heretical. Among the odder of these propositions are that it is a mortal sin to read a book to console one's soul (No. 31), which the Inquisition's theologians described as \\"crazy, erroneous, and even heretical\\"; and that one sinned mortally every time one loved a son, daughter, or other person, and did not love that person through God (No. 36), which the theologians said was \\"erroneous and false, and against the common teaching of the saints\\". One alumbrado, seeing a girl cross the street, said that \\"she had sinned, because in that action she had fulfilled her will\\" (No. 40). The theologians commented: \\"The foundation of this proposition is heretical, because it seems to state that all action that proceeds from our will is sin.\\"Homza, Lu Ann (editor and translator). The Spanish Inquisition 1478-1614: An Anthology of Sources. Indianapolis, IN: Hackett Publishing Company, 2006, pp. 80-92. Historical cases A labourer's daughter known as La Beata de Piedrahita, born in Salamanca, came to the notice of the Inquisition in 1511, by claiming to hold colloquies with Jesus and the Virgin Mary; some high patronage saved her from a rigorous denunciation. She is often, as The Catholic Encyclopedia cautiously notes, \\"cited as an early adherent\\" of the alumbrados' errors, though \\"it is not certain that she was guilty of heresy\\". Some recent scholars, like the Dominican historian and theologian √Ålvaro Huerga, who takes a relatively favorable view of her, question, on chronological and other grounds, the tendency to associate her with that movement, seeing her rather as \\"pre-alumbrados\\".Huerga, √Ålvaro. \\"Los pre-alumbrados y la Beata de Piedrah√≠ta\\", Historia de la Iglesia, Vol. XVII. Valencia: EDICEP, 1974, pp. 529-533. (In Spanish) Henry Charles Lea, in his A History of the Inquisition in Spain, mentions, among the more extravagant alumbrados, a priest from Seville named Fernando M√©ndez, who had acquired a special reputation for sanctity: \\"he taught his disciples to invoke his intercession, as though he were already a saint in heaven; fragments of his garments were treasured as relics; he gathered a congregation of beatas and, after mass in his oratory, they would strip off their garments and dance with indecent vigor ‚Äî drunk with the love of God ‚Äî and, on some of his female penitents, he would impose the penance of lifting their skirts and exposing themselves before him.\\"Lea, Henry Charles. A History of the Inquisition of Spain, Vol. 4, Book 8, Chapter 5, pp. 29-30. M√©ndez died before the Inquisition could bring him to trial. Ignatius of Loyola, while studying at Salamanca in 1527, was brought before an ecclesiastical commission on a charge of sympathy with the alumbrados, but escaped with an admonition. Miguel de Molinos was also accused of sympathy owing to some similarities between his book The Spiritual Guide and the teachings of the early alumbrados, Isabel de la Cruz and Pedro Ruiz de Alcaraz. A later case happened between the end of the 17th century and the beginning of the 18th century in Tenerife (Canary Islands). This concerned Sister Mar√≠a Justa de Jes√∫s, a Franciscan nun who was accused of practicing Molinist doctrinesLos conventos de La Orotava. Manuel Hern√°ndez Gonz√°lez. (a Christian religious doctrine that attempts to reconcile God's providence with human free will). This nun was famous in her day because she was allegedly able to heal the sick by transferring to her person the evils and diseases that afflicted them, in a manner similar to shamans in other cultures.Los 4 m√≠sticos tinerfe√±os The case was investigated by the Holy Inquisition, and according to its files the nun was accused of being a phony and even a witch. She was also accused of having an improper relationship with her confessor. However, he had many defenders. After her death, the Franciscan Order in the Canary Islands initiated a process of canonization that had to be halted owing to the controversy. Correction Their correction, by Inquisitional standards, was not particularly severe. Those convicted of engaging in the mystical practices and heresy of the alumbrados were not executed, few endured long-term sentences, and most were tried only after they managed to acquire large congregations in Toledo or Salamanca. Not all, however, were so fortunate. In 1529 a congregation of na√Øve adherents at Toledo was subjected to whippings and imprisonment. Greater rigors followed, and for about a century alleged connection with the alumbrados sent many to the Inquisition, especially at C√≥rdoba. In spite of this determined action, however, the heresy maintained itself until the middle of the 17th century. The connection of later alumbrados, whose practices varied in different places, to the original alumbrados, Isabella de la Cruz and Pedro Ruiz del Alcaraz, is debatable, but the continuing influence of their teachings is not improbable. Illumin√©s of France The movement (under the name of Illumin√©s) seems to have reached France from Seville in 1623, and attained some following in Picardy when joined (1634) by , cur√© of Saint-Georges de Roye, whose followers, known as Guerinets, were suppressed in 1635. A century later, another, more obscure body of Illumin√©s came to light in the south of France in 1722, and appears to have lingered till 1794, having affinities with those known contemporaneously in the United Kingdom as 'French Prophets', an offshoot of the Camisards.

It is also used as coat of arms of Vilnius city municipality. The modern version was created in 1991 by Arvydas Ka≈ædailis, the same artist who drew the modern coat of arms of Lithuania. The design is based on the oldest seals of the Vilnius City Council dating back to the 14th century. There is a great version and a small version. The great version incorporates the small version, which depicts Saint Christopher (sometimes also called Saint Christophorus) with the infant Jesus in his hands. This coat of arms was given to Vilnius in 1330. It was speculated that in pagan times, i.e., until the end of the 14th century, it featured Titan Alkis, a hero of ancient Lithuanian tales, carrying his wife Janterytƒó on his shoulders across the Vilnia River. The great coat of arms bears the Latin motto \\"UnitasJustitia ‚Äì Spes\\" (\\"UnityJusticeHope\\"). The words are echoed by objects held by the shield supporters: the axe and tied rods represent unity; the scale, justice; and the anchor, hope. The coat of arms was abolished under the Lithuanian SSR. It was reinstated after Lithuania declared its independence from the Soviet Union in 1990.

Mal√´sia e Madhe (\\"Great Mal√´sia\\"), known simply as Mal√´sia or Malsia (, ), is a historical and ethnographic region in northern Albania and eastern central Montenegro corresponding to the highlands of the geographical subdivision of the Mal√´si e Madhe District in Albania and Tuzi Municipality in Montenegro. The largest settlement in the area is the town of Tuzi. Name Mal√´sia e Madhe is Albanian for \\"great highlands\\". It is simply known as Mal√´sia, or in the local Gheg dialect, Malc√≠a (). Elsie also describes the region as part of the Northern Albanian Alps. The tribes are commonly called \\"highlanders\\", , anglicized as \\"Malissori\\", or \\"Malisors\\". An archaic term used by foreign travellers in the 1860s was \\"Malesians\\". Geography Cem valley in Albania. The region includes parts of the Prokletije mountain range (known in Albanian as , \\"the cursed mountains\\") and hinterland of the Lake Scutari, with valleys of the Cem river. The Mal√´sors (Albanian highlanders) live within northern Albania and historically Mal√´sia e Madhe (great highlands) contained five large tribes with four (Hoti, Kelmendi, Shkreli, Kastrati) having a Catholic majority and Muslim minority with Gruda evenly split between both religions. Within Mal√´sia e Madhe there were an additional seven small tribes. During times of war and mobilisation of troops, the bajraktar (chieftain) of Hoti was recognised by the Ottoman government as leader of all forces of the Mal√´sia e Madhe tribes having collectively some 6,200 rifles during the late Ottoman period. Mal√´sia e Vog√´l (small highlands) with seven Catholic tribes such as the Shala with 4 bajaraktars, Shoshi, Toplana and Nikaj contained some 1,250 households with a collective strength of 2,500 men that could be mobilised for war. Shoshi had a distinction in the region of possessing a legendary rock associated with Lek√´ Dukagjini. History During the Ottoman period, when northern Albania was part of the Sanjak of Scutari, Albanian tribes in Mal√´sia some times sided with Montenegrin tribes in fighting the Ottomans. An example is from 1658, when the seven tribes of Kuƒçi, Vasojeviƒái, Bratono≈æiƒái, Piperi, Kelmendi, Hoti and Gruda allied themselves with the Republic of Venice against the Ottomans. In 1757, the Bushati family transformed the sanjak into the semi-autonomous Pashalik of Scutari. After this, the Albanian tribes sided with the Bushati. Ded Gjo Luli. After the Ottoman Empire lost the Montenegrin‚ÄìOttoman War (1876‚Äì78), Plav and Gusinje were ceded to Montenegro, which sparked Albanian attacks in the area organized by the nationalist League of Prizren in support of the Ottoman Empire. Later, in the early 20th century, the northern Albanian tribes switched sides against the Ottoman Empire and rose up with Serbian aid in 1910 and Montenegrin aid in 1911. The latter began with a memorandum signed by the Mal√´sian tribal representatives. The Mal√´sian tribes won a victory at De√ßiq in April 1911. The Albanian revolt of 1912 led to the Albanian Declaration of Independence later that year. On May 26, 1913, 130 leaders of Gruda, Hoti, Kelmendi, Kastrati and Shkreli sent a petition to Cecil Burney in Shkod√´r against the incorporation of their territories into Montenegro. Gruda and parts of Hoti came under Montenegrin rule. Prek Cali. During World War II, the northern Albanian tribes were collaborationist and anti-Communist. Prek Cali led the Kelmendi tribe. Some leaders were persecuted by the new Communist regime. Demographics The region is inhabited by an Albanian majority, divided between Catholicism and Islam, while a small Serb-Montenegrin community is present in some villages. The Albanian population ethnographically belongs to the Ghegs group. In Montenegro: *Albanians - 7,839 (75.8%) *Montenegrins - 823 (8.0%) *Bosniaks - 627 (6.1%) *Muslims - 635 (6.1%) *Serbs - 156 (1.5%) *Romani - 62 (0.6%) *Others - 120 (1.2%) *No Ethnicity Declared - 77 (0.7%) *Total - 10,339 Culture Catholic church in the heights of the Selce village. Due to its rich culture, the highland region has attracted more attention from anthropologists, artists, writers and scholars than any other Albanian-populated region. It is Mal√´sia that produced what has been considered the national epic of the Albanian people, Lahuta e Malc√≠s (The Highland Lute). Author and Franciscan friar Gjergj Fishta spent 35 years composing this epic poem, in which is chronicled the whole range of the ethnic Albainan cultural experience (e.g. weddings, funerals, historical battles, mythology, genealogy, and tribal law). It is as interesting to modern readers as an anthropological document as it is a magnificent poem. Anton Harapi, Albania's most distinguished Christian philosopher, dedicated his masterpiece \\"√Çndrra e Pretashit\\" (The Dream of Pretash), initially called \\"The Wise Men along Cemi River\\" to the people of Malc√≠a. The oldest Albanian book was written by Mal√´sor Catholic priest Gjon Buzuku. Ethnography In 1908, anthropologist Edith Durham visited the Mal√´sia region and catalogued her findings in her ethnographic work \\"High Albania,\\" which was, for nearly a century, the most trusted source of information about the Albanian highlanders. Albanian anthropologist Kol√´ Berisha wrote, among other books, the four-volumes ethnography entitled \\"Malc√≠a e Madhe\\" written between 1900 and 1945. =Tribes= Albanian bajraks (1918). Robert Elsie divided the tribes of Albania in his works according to regions. There were ten tribes that belonged to the Mal√´sia e Madhe in the Northern Albanian Alps. * Kelmendi * Gruda (in Montenegro) * Hoti (partially in Montenegro) * Kastrati * Shkreli * Triesh * Koja The histories of the respective clans (and hence the whole region) are amalgamations of both historical events and genealogies passed along by oral transmission.

Haines was born in London, the son of John Haines, a physician. He was educated at Charterhouse School and Caius College, Cambridge, where he graduated in medicine; he later practiced surgery for several years. In 1835 he married Mary Dugard, with whom he had nine children. Haines migrated to the Port Phillip District (later Victoria) in 1841 and settled in the Geelong area. He farmed in the area as well as practising as a surgeon. He was appointed a member of the Victorian Legislative Council (then a partly elected, partly appointive body) in 1851, and in 1853 he was elected for district of Grant. He served as colonial secretary 1854‚Äì55. Politically, he represented the small farmers against the squatters who owned most of Victoria's land. When Victoria gained full responsible government in 1855, Haines was leader of the Government. He was commissioned as Victoria's first premier and chief secretary on 28 November 1855 and served until 11 March 1857. Haines was elected to the Legislative Assembly for South Grant in November 1856. Haines was again premier from April 1857 to March 1858. Haines then visited Europe for three years. In 1860 he moved to the seat of Portland which he represented until 1864. Haines served as treasurer from 14 November 1861 to 27 June 1863, in the third O'Shanassy government. He served again in the legislative council, representing Eastern Province, from August 1865 until his death in February 1866. The historian Raymond Wright describes Haines as a bluff, plain \\"honest farmer\\" type, who was \\"much enjoyed for his appalling public speaking.\\" His main concern as premier was to democratise the Constitution which had been drawn up for Victoria by colonial officials before self-government, mainly to protect the interests of the squatter class. A bill was introduced to enlarge the Assembly, redraw electoral boundaries and abolish the property qualification for both votes and candidates. But the unstable situation in the Assembly brought his ministry to an early end.

It is the B-side to the single \\"How Do U Want It\\", released on June 4, 1996. The song's lyrics contain vicious insults to several East Coast rappers, chief among them, Shakur's former-friend-turned-rival, Christopher Wallace, also known as Biggie Smalls. The song was recorded at Can Am Studios in May 1996. Reporter Chuck Philips, who interviewed Shakur at Can Am, described the song as caustic anti-East Coast crusade in which the rapper threatens to eliminate Biggie, Sean Combs (Puffy), and a slew of Bad Boy artists and other New York acts.\\" The song was produced by long-time collaborator Johnny \\"J\\" and uses the bassline from \\"Don't Look Any Further\\" by Dennis Edwards and interpolates 10% Dis by MC Lyte, and \\"Get Money\\" by Biggie's group Junior M.A.F.I.A. The video, itself described as infamous, includes impersonations of Biggie, Puffy and M.A.F.I.A. member Lil' Kim. \\"Hit 'Em Up\\" had a large role in exacerbating the East Coast‚ÄìWest Coast hip hop rivalry. Following its release, the East Coast rappers insulted in the song responded through tracks of their own. The controversy surrounding the song is due in part to Shakur's murder in a drive-by-shooting only three months after its release. The song is widely considered by the U.S. hip hop community as one of the greatest diss tracks ever recorded due to its explicit lyrical content and the seriousness of violent intent by Shakur and his colleagues towards their rivals. Origins \\"Hit 'Em Up\\" was written and recorded at Can-Am studios in May 1996. For the song, Tupac Shakur recruited the members of the former group Dramacydal whom he had worked with previously, and was eager to work with again. Together, the rappers (along with other associates) formed the original lineup of the Outlawz.Lang, p. 45. The first and third verses are performed by Shakur, while the second verse is performed by Hussein Fatal, the fourth by Yaki Kadafi and the fifth by E.D.I. Mean.Sandy; Daniels, p. 74. The ferocity of Shakur's raging vocals,Gilmore, p. 460. as said by long-time collaborator and producer of \\"Hit 'Em Up\\" Johnny J, was entirely authentic.Brown, p. 109. He explained that Shakur was initially fueled by his anger against Biggie and Bad Boy Records for the belief that they had a role in the November 30, 1994 ambush and attack on Shakur. He claimed that Biggie and his crew knew of his shooting and wanted him dead. Shakur used this fury, which Johnny \\"J\\" described as \\"superhuman\\", to attack Biggie and other East Coast rappers. Johnny \\"J\\" also stated that he had never seen Shakur so angry and that the words he rapped were in no way an act,Brown, p. 110. describing the recording process as the most \\"hard-core he had ever done.\\" Although he was very happy with the work he had put into it and the resulting song, Johnny \\"J\\" went on to say that he had no desire to work on anything of that magnitude again. Shakur was also enraged by Biggie's release of \\"Who Shot Ya?\\" provocatively only months after the shooting incident, and although it did not directly involve Shakur's name, he believed it was directed towards him. Shakur admitted to releasing \\"Hit 'Em Up\\" as a response to \\"Who Shot Ya?\\" In a Vibe interview, the rapper called out Sean \\"Puffy\\" Combs and Biggie Smalls and accused both of them of setting him up, or of having knowledge of the attack and not warning him. He also singled out businessmen James Rosemond (\\"Jimmy Henchman\\"), and Jacques Agnant (\\"Haitian Jack\\") of orchestrating the assault. Shakur announced the names of his ostensible conspirators to Kevin Powell, a journalist for Vibe however, to mask their true identities, Vibe referred to Henchman as \\"Booker,\\" and Jack as \\"Nigel\\" in the published interview. Persons familiar with the interview say they used different names after the magazine received threats from Henchman. A former Vibe editor denied receiving threats, but neglected to explain why the magazine substituted aliases for Henchman and Haitian Jack. Henchman promised Shakur $7,000 to duo with Lil Shawn, a rapper whom the businessman represented at that time. In a 2008 article by Philips, Henchman was implicated in organizing the assault,(Court case exhibit: USA vs James Rosemond Case # 1:11-Cr-00424 5/14/2012 Document # 100, exhibit 1) and was further implicated in 2012 by his long-time friend Dexter Isaac, who confessed to attacking Shakur on Henchman's orders. Isaac was confirmed as a source in Philip's earlier story as well as in Henchman's own confession, according to prosecutors at his 2012 trial. Composition The lyrics in \\"Hit 'Em Up\\" were aimed primarily at Biggie and Puffy.Strong 2008, p. 1126. Shakur viciously insults Biggie throughout‚Å† ‚Å†‚Äî the first line by Shakur is \\"That's why I fucked your bitch, you fat motherfucker\\"‚Å† ‚Å†‚Äî and threatens retaliation in the songs hook, saying \\"Who shot me?/But you punks didn't finish/Now you're about to feel the wrath of a menace.\\" He also used the song as a platform to express his belief that Biggie was guilty of stealing his style of rapping, and was merely imitating his lifestyle.Dimitriadis, p. 75. This notion is addressed in the verse in \\"Now it's all about Versace, you copied my style.\\" He also touches topically on their early friendship with the line \\"Biggie, remember when I used to let you sleep on the couch?\\" and their subsequent fallout. Towards the end of the song Tupac disses Mobb Deep, saying \\"Don't one of you niggas got sickle cell or something? You fucking with me, nigga you fuck around and get a seizure or a heart attack\\", referring to Prodigy, a member of Mobb Deep who suffered from sickle cell disease (and would in fact later die of complications related to the disease). Mobb Deep responded by releasing \\"Drop a Gem on 'em\\", which was released shortly before Tupac's death (but pulled from airplay rotation after).Jones; Jenson, p. 150. \\"Hit 'Em Up\\" features much profanity, using the words \\"fuck\\" or \\"motherfucker\\" at least 35 times in the song, and was issued a Parental Advisory label.McClairne, p. 24. The bassline in \\"Hit 'Em Up\\" is taken from the 1984 Dennis Edwards song \\"Don't Look Any Further\\". The chorus of \\"Hit 'Em Up\\" is a play on the chorus of Junior M.A.F.I.A's \\"Player's Anthem.\\"the Blacklist, p. 104. The phrase \\"take money\\" is repeated throughout the song, which is a play on Junior M.A.F.I.A's recent release \\"Get Money\\", the remix of which (called \\"Gettin' Money\\") is also the beat used in \\"Hit 'Em Up\\".Caramanica, p. 138. Faith Evans, who at the time was Biggie's estranged wife,Hess, p. 405. was reportedly seen with Shakur after a public breakup with Biggie.Scott 1997, p. 38.Scott 1997, p. 39. Journalist Chuck Philips spotted Faith Evans at Can Am when he interviewed Shakur a year earlier in 1995. People at the studio told the reporter that Faith Evans also contributed‚Äîthat the R&B; chanteuse recorded one or more \\"Take Money\\" background vocals that would appear on \\"Hit Em Up.\\" In his October 1995 interview of the rapper, Philips remembered in 2012, \\"I was so unaware of the bi-coastal rap war that I suspected nothing when Faith Evans appeared with Shakur at Can Am. The estranged wife of Biggie was recording background vocals for \\"Wonda Why They Call U Bitch\\", a song which was at the time yet to be released. According to Shakur she had given him gifts of clothing, which he offered as proof of a relationship in an interview. Using this against Biggie in \\"Hit 'Em Up\\", Shakur continued to fuel the rumors of a sexual relationship with Evans in the song's line \\"You claim to be a player, but I fucked your wife.\\"the Blacklist, p. 103. Claims of an affair with Evans appear three times in the song. Shakur also attacked many other people associated with Bad Boy Records and with Biggie, such as Lil' Kim and Junior M.A.F.I.A.Jenkins; Wilson, p. 239. He exclaimed that their lifestyle and what they rapped about were fraudulent, and that they were not from the streets. He believed that they were only perpetuating the drama and did not understand the situation they were getting into. Bronx rapper Chino XL was also insulted for vulgar comments he made about Shakur on his song \\"Riiiot!\\".McClairne, p. 25. In the original recording, Shakur also insulted Jay-Z at the ending segment, but removed it after being convinced by Outlawz members that Carter had nothing to do with the conflict between Death Row and Bad Boy. Music video alt=Tupac Shakur standing between actors portraying Biggie Smalls and Lil' Kim. The music video for \\"Hit 'Em Up\\" was filmed in a warehouse off Slauson Avenue near Fox Hills Mall in Los Angeles in May 1996.Saxon, p. 107.Alexander; Cuda, p. 132. It was filmed by the production company Look Hear Productions. Shakur raps in a white room with The Outlawz, as well as in purple-caged room and a black room with bullet holes in the background. TV monitors in the background show clips of Shakur, Puffy, and Biggie Smalls, and even clips from the video \\"Made Niggaz.\\" The video featured actors who were recalled from their prior roles in the music video for \\"2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted\\" to impersonate some of those who were attacked in \\"Hit 'Em Up.\\" This included Biggie, whose stand-in stares dully into the camera and sports a Kangol and jacket, similar to one Biggie would wear. During the moments where Shakur raps about his claimed affair with Evans, the Biggie impersonator crouches near the camera while Shakur yells in his face. Puffy is also impersonated, appearing with a high-top fade and leaning towards the camera, lowering and raising his sunglasses.Ro, p. 90. Like the song, the video for \\"Hit 'Em Up\\" has also been called \\"infamous\\".Attaway, p.215.

The music video for \\"Hit 'Em Up\\" can be found on Tupac: Live at the House of Blues DVD. Release and reception Finishing the recording of the song, Shakur felt very positively about the track, saying the \\"song is going to be playing in every club., every country. Deejays are calling from everywhere, wanting to get a piece of this.\\"Alexander; Cuda, p. 139. \\"Hit 'Em Up\\" appeared first as a B-side,the Blacklist, p. 100. on the single \\"How Do U Want It\\",Strong 2008, p. 1127. by Shakur featuring The Outlawz.Golus, p. 58. On June 4, 1996 under the label Death Row Records,Saxon, p. 114. \\"Hit 'Em Up\\" was released on compact disc, 12-inch, and a 45 RPM. The original cover for the single had Puffy's head on a snake's body, and Biggie's head on a pig's. It also appeared posthumously on several compilations, including the 2005 release of Shakur's last recorded live performance, Live at the House of Blues.Strong 2008, p. 1128. \\"Hit 'Em Up\\" was also remixed on Nu- Mixx Klazzics. Upon its release, \\"Hit 'Em Up\\" received frequent radio airplay, which was attributed to the public interest in the ongoing feud and radio stations' desire to garner high ratings. However, some radio stations, such as the Los Angeles-based KPWR, refused to play it. The follow-up to \\"Hit 'Em Up\\" was the song \\"Bomb First (My Second Reply)\\".Hess, p. 392. \\"Hit 'Em Up\\" has been called \\"controversial,\\"McAdams, p. 86. \\"infamous,\\" \\"disturbing,\\"Strong 2004, p. 316. and \\"brutal.\\" Shakur's insults against virtually the entire East Coast scene of rappers were said to be ferocious. The song, along with \\"Dear Mama,\\" has been viewed as one of Shakur's songs that resonated with and was spoken of the most by young people.Dimitriadis, p. 135. Some felt that \\"Hit 'Em Up\\" showcased Shakur ranting and raving like a fool,Boyd, p. 93. and J.R. Reynolds of Billboard called it horrendous, noting that Shakur revealed his true colors upon recording the song. He also went on to say that although sympathetic to the shooting, \\"Hit 'Em Up\\" had \\"fan[ned] the flames of hatred ...and affect[ed] an entire black culture's psyche\\"; he called the song \\"repugnant and unacceptable.\\"Reynolds, p. 19. Among associates of Shakur, it was called a \\"bad-luck song.\\" Los Angeles radio director Bruce St. James called the song \\"the be-all, end-all, curse-word, dirty-lyric, violent song of all time.\\" Game's manager has called it the best diss record.Golianopoulos, p. 85. Documentary filmmaker Carl Weston believed that \\"most people in Biggie's shoes would have wanted to at least hurt Tupac\\" in a Spin magazine interview.Jenkins, p. 85. Among musicians, the song drew criticism from singer Dionne Warwick,Hall; Hall, p. 630. and disapproval from fellow rappers Kool Moe Dee and Chuck D, as written in their book There's a God on the Mic: The True 50 Greatest MCs. They felt that although Shakur was one of the most substantive rappers of that period, he had gone too far with \\"Hit 'Em Up,\\"Kool Moe Dee; Chuck D., p. 80. causing some of Shakur's fans to turn on him, according to the two rappers.Kool Moe Dee; Chuck D., p. 223. =Aftermath= The song has been viewed as the turning point in the feud between Tupac and Biggie, where things were said and rapped which could never be taken back during the remainder of Shakur's life. This has led to its being dubbed as the beginning of the war between the East Coast and the West Coast,Mills, p. 74. and the centerpiece in what became the most venomous battle in history of hip hop.Brown, p. 108. \\"Hit 'Em Up\\" has been studied by and with academics,McCarthy. and it has been used as a part of a series of lessons for building the means to communicate with younger people.Elligan, p. 68. Its main role in these lessons is to define anger in rap music.Elligan, p. 178. Biggie was shot and killed six months after Shakur's death. Response =From Biggie= After hearing \\"Hit 'Em Up\\", Biggie continued proclaiming his innocence in the shooting incident. He also remarked that the song \\"Who Shot Ya?\\" was written before Shakur was shot and thus, was not about him. Regarding the lyrics aimed at his wife Faith, Biggie expressed an inability to find merit in what Shakur had claimed. He believed that Shakur intended to attack him through Faith, although he remained unsure of whether an encounter between them had occurred. Ultimately, he thought that if something had occurred it was none of his business, and that Shakur should not have publicly disclosed this information in a song. Biggie responded to this matter in a similar fashion to \\"Hit 'Em Up\\", rapping in a joint release by himself and Jay-Z in the song \\"Brooklyn's Finest\\",Heos, p. 20. where he says \\"If Faye have twins, she'd probably have two Pacs. Get it? Tupac's?\\" Shortly after the release of \\"Hit 'Em Up\\", Evans went on the radio and denied that she had been with Shakur.Scott 2000, p. 53. =From other artists= Puffy had trouble understanding the sheer rage Shakur had expressed for Biggie in \\"Hit 'Em Up\\". He also responded by reinforcing his and Biggie's innocence regarding the shooting and went on to say that prior to the incident they \\"were friends\\", and that they \\"would have never done nothing to hurt him.\\"Scott 2000, p. 170. In an interview with Vibe Magazine concerning Shakur's allegations of Biggie and Puffy having prior knowledge of the ambush, Puffy stated: Lil' Kim responded on the original version of her song \\"Big Momma Thang\\", which was aimed at Biggie's wife, Faith Evans, and Shakur. Junior M.A.F.I.A. recorded a music video for the song \\"Get Money\\", which has been regarded as a diss to Shakur. Biggie denies these claims, stating: \\"It's just a video; ain't nobody got no time to make no diss on nobody.\\" Lil' Cease said after the release that Biggie still had love for Shakur, and even respected him. The attack on Mobb Deep came as a response for their involvement on the song \\"L.A L.A\\" by Capone- N-Noreaga, which was a retaliation to Snoop Dogg and Tha Dogg Pound's song \\"New York, New York\\" music video in which members of Tha Dogg Pound and Death Row are seen knocking down buildings in New York City. Mobb Deep responded to Shakur with the track \\"Drop a Gem on 'em\\". It was first released as a promotional single, and later appeared on their album Hell on Earth. Lyrically, it did not specifically name Shakur, but it did allude to the shooting incident. It has also been noted for erroneously stating the cost of the assets Shakur had taken from him during the shooting incident.Jenkins; Wilson, p. 195. Bronx rapper King Sun also responded to Shakur with \\"New York Love (All Eyez On Sun)\\". Appearances \\"Hit 'Em Up\\" was originally featured as a B-side on Shakur's single \\"How Do U Want It\\". In 1998, it was released on Shakur's first compilation album, Greatest Hits. A remix of the song was featured on Nu-Mixx Klazzics (2003), where the intro lyrics from the originally explicit version and the main lyrics from the edited radio version. A live version of the song was included on the 2005 release of Tupac: Live at the House of Blues. \\"Hit 'Em Up\\" was first released on Death Row Greatest Hits, and was again released as a live recording on the 2004 album 2Pac Live. In the second half of Eminem's song \\"Quitter\\", the rapper attempts to remake \\"Hit 'Em Up\\" and in itself is a diss track aimed towards Everlast. Eminem has support from D12 on his version like the Outlawz supported Shakur on the original.Knight, p. 43. Khia used the song's beat and part of the hook in her song \\"Hit 'Em Up\\" , which is a diss to female rappers Trina and Jacki-O. \\"What I Think About You\\" by Bow Wow uses a reinterpolation of \\"Hit 'Em Up\\" and is a diss song to fellow rapper Soulja Boy Tell 'em. The song appears in 2Pac's Biopic, \\"All Eyez On Me\\" (2017), in which 2Pac performs the song during his 1996 House Of Blues Concert in the film as a message to Biggie, talking about having relations with Faith Evans, Biggie's wife. The film shows 2Pac sending the song to Biggie to hear along with Biggie being handed a magazine with 2Pac & Faith taking a close picture together, furthering the accusation of 2Pac taking Biggie's wife in the song. The lines 'take money' were sung by Faith Evans.

It has been the home of Derbyshire County Cricket Club since 1871. The ground was first used by South Derbyshire Cricket Club in 1863 and was initially located within Derby Racecourse, although racing ceased after 1939. The ground has staged two One- Day Internationals: New Zealand against Sri Lanka during the 1983 ICC Cricket World Cup and New Zealand against Pakistan during the 1999 ICC Cricket World Cup. It was one of the venues for the 2017 ICC Women's Cricket World Cup, hosting one of the semi-finals. The ground was also formerly used for football, and was the home of Derby County F.C. between 1884 and 1895. It staged the first ever FA Cup Final match played outside London, a replay of the 1886 Final, and hosted an international match between England and Ireland in 1895. History The ground was first used by South Derbyshire Cricket Club in 1863 and was initially located within Derby Racecourse, although racing ceased after 1939. It also held the games of Derby County Football Club until their move to the Baseball Ground in 1895. The first FA Cup Final outside London was held at the ground in 1886 when Blackburn Rovers beat West Bromwich Albion 2-0 in a replay. England played one football international here, beating Ireland 9-0 in the British Home Championship on 9 March 1895. The playing area used to feature pitches laid on an east‚Äìwest axis. Most first-class grounds feature pitches laid north‚Äìsouth to avoid problems with the light from the setting sun. Derbyshire re-laid the pitch on a north‚Äìsouth axis over the 2009/10 winter at a cost of ¬£100,000, ready for the 2010 season. This involved moving some of the floodlights and the electronic scoreboard to suit the new alignment. The new media centre - May 2017 Derbyshire v. Australia tour match - July 2010In early 2010 a large 1800 seat stand was erected at the Racecourse End of the ground. This stand was taken down in late 2015 in order to make way for a new ¬£2.2 million four storey media centre, which was completed and officially opened in September 2016. Some 1100 seats were immediately reinstated at the Pavilion End of the ground, with the remaining reinstated next to the new media centre. In February 2017 Derby Civic Society awarded a commendation in the category of Best New Build of 2016 to Derbyshire County Cricket Club for the new media centre. A new marquee was also built in 2010, which is used for private functions and entertainment during match days. In February 2016, it was announced that the County Ground would be one of the host venues for the 2017 Women's Cricket World Cup in England. Along with Bristol, Derby hosted one of the semi-finals of the tournament. Other events Music concerts have been staged at the ground by Elton John and Boyzone, both in 2017, and Little Mix in 2018.

Sandy, son of Sophie Cohen, is married to Kirsten Cohen. Their eldest child, Seth, is something of a social misfit. Sandy's father left his mother when he was young and he has an unnamed brother and sister. Sandy's parents and siblings are not characters on The O.C. Sandy was originally a public defender, which brought him into contact with troubled teen, Ryan Atwood, whom he eventually adopted and took on as his own after Ryan's mother abandoned him. He has since gone into private practice in a law firm, before going to start his own law firm, taking over his late father-in-law's company, the Newport Group, returning to being a defense lawyer after Seth accidentally burned down the Newport Group headquarters, and finally becoming a Law professor. Sandy and Kirsten have three children. Sandy supports more liberal politics when compared to his wife Kirsten Cohen. He campaigned for the Democratic presidential candidate Walter Mondale in 1984, while his wife Kirsten Cohen supported the Republican candidate, Ronald Reagan. Throughout the series, Sandy serves as a moral center, often guiding and supporting Seth and Ryan, and at times their love interests Marissa Cooper, Summer Roberts and Taylor Townsend, through their problems. Characterization Despite living in Newport and marrying a \\"Newpsie\\", it becomes apparent that Sandy does not consider himself to be \\"one of them\\". His blue-collar, single-parent-upbringing in The Bronx contrasts with that of his wife Kirsten. Like long-time next door neighbor Julie Cooper, he was not raised in the affluent Newport lifestyle but unlike Julie, he generally disassociates himself from his counterparts. He usually does not fail to make known his distaste for the shallow, materialistic and pampered ways of his contemporaries who were born and bred in that lifestyle, even going so far as to describe Harbor School teachers as \\"preppy little savages\\" and calling the housewives' social gatherings \\"Newpsie Conventions\\". As the more easy-going parent, Sandy's \\"hippie parenting\\" sometimes clashed with Kirsten's more strict and firm style. He prefers to let his children learn the error of their ways by experiencing the consequences themselves. Character arc =Season 1= Sandy has a mainly stable relationship with Kirsten and Seth, albeit with the occasional problem surfacing. Unresolved issues of trust and jealousy rise to the surface with regards to Kirsten's former childhood sweetheart, Jimmy Cooper, who is also their next-door neighbor in Season 1. He leaves the Public Defender's Office to go into private practice at Patridge, Savage and Khan, along with his former colleague from the District Attorney's office, Rachel Hoffman. She causes tension between Sandy and Kirsten when Kirsten finds Sandy enjoying a drink with Rachel one night while he was supposed to be at a meeting. Later on, Sandy and Rachel get involved in a case against Caleb's company, the Newport Group. Both were accused by Caleb of having an affair because they had been spending a lot of time together and working very late. Not long afterwards, when Rachel and Sandy were working late in her apartment, she indeed makes a play for him, but he rejects her advances. He and Kirsten then attempt to set her up with the newly divorced Jimmy, to no avail. =Season 2= Rebecca Bloom, an old flame of Sandy's, came back into their lives, causing difficulties between him and Kirsten. This contributed towards her growing alcohol problem, and the distance between her and Sandy caused her to almost have an affair with a magazine editor, Carter Buckley, although he left before anything happened. This came to a head when Kirsten's father, Caleb Nichol, died which caused Kirsten's drinking problem to run out of control, forcing the entire Cohen family (including Ryan) and Kirsten's sister Hailey to stage an intervention and put her in rehab. =Season 3= He has had many new problems with the underhanded nature of business in the real estate world in his new job as CEO of the Newport Group. This once again has caused a strain on his home life, although the season three finale saw him making the decision to return to being a public defender after revisiting his old office and seeing what it was like. =Season 4= In the fourth season, Sandy helps Ryan sort things out with Kevin Volchok, who was responsible for the death of Marissa and he was also the one who talks Ryan into helping Taylor, who was in the middle of a divorce from her French husband, Henri-Michel. Later in the season, Sandy bumps into a man at the New Year's Eve party and investigates further. The man is revealed to be Ryan's father, Frank Atwood, whom Sandy meets. Frank wants to see Ryan, so Sandy tells Ryan who refuses. Frank tells Sandy that he has cancer so Kirsten invites him to dinner but Sandy is suspicious. It is later revealed Frank lied in a last-ditch attempt to see Ryan, prompting Sandy to punch him in front of everyone. Sandy helps in the preparation for Kirsten's fortieth birthday. He finds a mail truck, exactly the same model as the one that both of them lived in Berkeley, while his real present to her was two first-class tickets around the world. When he tells a stunned Kirsten, she announces that she is having a baby. After an earthquake hits Newport Beach, Sandy finds Kirsten on the ground, and tries to help her up, but had difficulties because of the falling objects around them. At the hospital, Sandy and Kirsten discover that they are going to have a daughter. Series finale Six months later, he and Kirsten move to Berkeley; back to the house where they had Seth. It is in this house that Seth and Ryan's sister, Sophie Rose, starts her life. In the flashforward set five years later, Sandy is now a law professor at UC Berkeley. Creation and characterization The character is based on the show's creator Josh Schwartz who told: \\"The dynamic between Sandy and Seth is very much based on me and my dad. He said about Sandy: \\"He is never a man who can refuse to help someone.\\" Reception In 2004, TV Guide ranked Sandy number 25 on its 50 Greatest TV Dads of All Time list. BuddyTV ranked him number 7 on its of the \\"15 Hottest TV Dads\\". AOL TV placed him in its Top 20 TV Dads.

Early life and education  Lambsdorff was born in Aachen (Rhineland) to Herbert Graf Lambsdorff and Eva, n√©e Schmidt. He attended school in Berlin and Brandenburg an der Havel and became an officer cadet in the Wehrmacht in 1944. In April 1945 he was severely wounded in an Allied strafe attack and lost his lower left leg. Lambsdorff was a prisoner of war until 1946. After World War II he passed his Abitur and studied law at the Universities of Bonn and Cologne where he obtained a PhD. Political career In 1951, Lambsdorff became a member of the liberal FDP, and from 1972 to 1998 he represented this party in the Federal parliament, the Bundestag. Within and outside his party he was known as a representative of the market liberals; a mocking name was der Marktgraf (\\"the market count\\", a play on Markgraf, \\"margrave\\"). =Federal Minister for Economic Affairs= When Chancellor Willy Brandt made way for Helmut Schmidt in 1977, Lambsdorff was appointed West German Federal Minister of Economics in the new government and served from 1977 until 1982. He held the same office again from 1982 until 1984 in the government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl after his party pulled out of the coalition with the Social Democratic Party to form a new Government with Kohl‚Äôs Christian Democratic Union.

Lambsdorff argued that the result would be economic growth, which would itself solve both the social problems and the financial problems. As a consequence switched allegiance to the CDU, and Schmidt lost his parliamentary majority in 1982. For the only time in West Germany's history, the government fell on a vote of no confidence.Frank B.

The band was formed in 1987 by P√≥l MacAmhlaigh (bass) and Ciar√°n MacUiliam (guitars). Their sound blends black metal and doom metal with Celtic music. History The band's roots stretch back to 1987 when P√≥l and Ciar√°n first began playing together with P√≥l's brother, Derek. The band (who were called Forsaken for a brief period) initially played a rough, hybrid mix of early, primitive thrash and death metal (playing covers of Death, Sepultura and the like). Vocalist Nemtheanga joined the band after seeing an advertisement for a singer in Dublin specialist Metal store The Sound Cellar in 1991. According to Primordial lore, the ad was pasted over no more than 2 hours after it being put up.Primordial interviewed for DVD preview, Primordial DVD Preview , Metal Injection, accessed 8 March 2010 Upon Nemtheanga's joining the band, the band started to pursue a darker direction citing influence from Bathory, Celtic Frost and the emerging Greek and Norwegian black metal scenes. Primordial was the first black metal styled band to emerge from Ireland with the release of their Dark Romanticism demo in the early summer of 1993 (Cruachan were also active at this time combining black metal with folk music). The band initially came to the attention of Lee Barrett from the UK label Candlelight Records but he failed to move on signing the band, so after a live soundboard recording from Dublin from 1994 was sent to Cacophonous Records (Cradle of Filth, Bal Sagoth, etc.), the band signed with them for the release of their debut album Imrama. Although their debut album, Imrama, was characteristic as being in a more melodic black metal musical direction, they gradually came to refine their sound with A Journey's End, which included the use of mandolins and whistles and a more epic style. The two subsequent releases, The Burning Season and Spirit the Earth Aflame, showed the band's reflection of cultural geist and emotion, woven into an amalgam of black, Celtic, and folk metal musical styles. They have toured with various metal bands in the extreme metal genre, including Norwegian black metal band Immortal. They released their dark fourth studio album Storm Before Calm in 2002, but the band's fifth album The Gathering Wilderness turned out to be a much darker and bleaker record than any Primordial had made before, providing the listener with a rawer sound as well. It was chosen as album of the month in Terrorizer Magazine and appeared in many top lists of the year 2005. In January 2006 the band played their first US show alongside Thyrfing and Moonsorrow at the Heathen Crusade metalfest in Columbia Heights, Minnesota. The band's sixth album To the Nameless Dead, was released on 16 November 2007 with universal praise for its raw sound used from the first or second recordings. In November and December 2010, the band entered Foel Studio in Wales to work with producer Chris Fielding once again. The resulting album, Redemption at the Puritan's Hand was released via Metal Blade on April 22, 2011. In July 2014, Primordial announced their eighth studio album under the working title Where Greater Men Have Fallen. It was released November 25th 2014 in the US and November 24th elsewhere. On April 18th 2018 their ninth studio album Exile Amongst the Ruins was released.

Its name is based on a small lake nearby, Lake Ishiba Ng'andu which in the Bemba language means 'lake of the royal crocodile'. The house itself is also known as \\"Shiwa House\\". It was the lifelong project of an English aristocrat, Sir Stewart Gore-Browne who fell in love with the country after working on the Anglo-Belgian Boundary Commission determining the border between Rhodesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Decision to settle at Shiwa Ngandu  From his boyhood, Gore-Browne had an ambition to own an estate like that of his aunt, Dame Ethel Locke King, at Weybridge in England. Although comparatively wealthy himself, he could not afford such an estate in Britain. Land in Northern Rhodesia was very much cheaper for white settlers. At the boundary commission he had come to admire the Bemba workers and so he travelled to their country looking for a site. Arriving at Lake Shiwa Ngandu in April 1914 with his Bemba servants and porters, he knew he had found it. World War I intervened but its horrors only increased his desire to return to Shiwa Ngandu and achieve his dream. He also harboured the ideal of establishing a patrician regime of the kind whose time was ending in Britain after the war.  Construction of the estate  Construction of the mansion began in 1920 when Zambia was the British protectorate of Northern Rhodesia. The site was from the nearest railhead, a journey of many days over rivers and swamps. At that time there were no roads to the area. As well as building the estate's access roads and bridges, Gore- Browne built roads and bridges for the local colonial authority. Almost everything had to be made on site, including every brick used in the construction. Hundreds of labourers were employed, and with the help of oxen to haul the bricks in scorching heat, a substantial house was constructed within a few years. However, the building work did not stop until the late 1950s; an imposing gatehouse, a tower, colinaded porticoes, courtyards, additional rooms all added to its size and stature. Each of the stone panels used on the roof weighs 2.5 kilograms. The house was surrounded by nursery gardens, tennis courts, a walled ladies' garden and much more. The estate followed in the tradition of 19th century utopian model villages like Saltaire and Port Sunlight. The estate is 12 500 hectares. The estate had its own schools, hospitals, playing fields, shops, and post office. Workers lived in brick-built cottages and the estate was ruled as a benevolent autocracy ‚Äî though by a man with a temper ferocious enough to justify the local nickname of Chipembere which means 'rhinoceros'. He was also a very formal man who always wore black tie for dinner, at a table set with family plate and silver ‚Äì whether he had guests or not.  The estate in Gore-Browne's later life  Shiwa Ngandu's remoteness and isolation from white settler society in Northern Rhodesia's southern half and in Southern Rhodesia gave Gore-Browne a perspective on black Africans which led him to believe the country should develop in a more collaborative direction than the settler-ruled and segregationist Southern Rhodesia and apartheid South Africa. He involved himself in politics as detailed in his biographical article. The estate never managed to make consistent and steady profits. The soil was too acidic for most crops, and after trying various other sources of revenue, they found a more stable income in the production of essential oils and citrus blossoms especially when the Second World War closed off supplies of essential oils from the rivieras of France and Bulgaria. However, his projects were heavily subsidized by Dame Ethel Locke King, with whom he was obsessively attached and corresponded from his childhood until her death. This source of revenue ended in 1958 when the citrus trees were attacked by a blight. Stewart Gore-Browne died in Kasama, Zambia in 1967, and to this date is the only white man to have been given a state funeral in the history of Zambia, with a eulogy given by then President Kenneth Kaunda.  Fame and tragedy  After Sir Stewart's death, Shiwa Ngandu was managed by one of his daughters, Lorna, and her husband John Harvey. They had four children, who grew up at the estate. They were filmed by the British Broadcasting Corporation travelogue series Pole to Pole in 1991, fronted by actor Michael Palin and who was making a visit to the estate. Tragically, only six months later in 1992, Lorna and John were murdered at Shiwa Ngandu by three men who were caught and convicted (see the book The Africa House). They were ANC members living in exile in Zambia. The ANC disavowed any prior knowledge and condemned the murders, and although some property was stolen, possible motives remain speculative. In the years following the murders, the house fell into disrepair.  The present day  Recently, Shiwa House has been partially restored and has opened five rooms for paying guests under the name 'Shiwa Ngandu Manor House'. An airstrip has been built for charter flights. The estate's remote beauty is once more accessible to visitors. Touring the estate is free for Zambian citizens. The grave of Sir Stewart is at rest in the extraordinary African paradise he created. Lorna and John Harvey's sons have reintroduced wildlife, and established a large cattle ranch. Poaching is under control, and the estate is proving to be a significant source of employment in the area.

It is generally associated with the American anthropologist Franz Boas; he and his students aimed to record vanishing Native American cultures. Since the 1960s, anthropologists have used the term as part of a critique of 19th-century ethnography and early modern anthropology.  Origin of the term  The term \\"salvage ethnography\\" was coined by Jacob W. Gruber, who identified its emergence with 19th-century ethnographers documenting the languages of peoples being conquered and colonized by European countries or the United States. According to Gruber, one of the first official statements acknowledging that a major effect of colonialism was the destruction of existing languages and ways of life was The report of the British Select Committee of Aborigines (1837). As a scholarly response, Gruber quotes James Cowles Prichard's address before the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1839, referring to the Old Testament tale of Cain and Abel:  Conservation and art  A Hupa fisherman‚ÄîIn the early 20th century, Edward Curtis traveled across America recording photographs of the disappearing lifestyle of American Indian tribes. Frances Densmore (1867‚Äì1957), an influential ethnomusicologist, worked in the tradition of salvage ethnography. Densmore recorded the songs and lyrics of Native Americans in an attempt to preserve them permanently. Many of her original recordings, preserved on wax cylinders, are archived at the Library of Congress. Artists compounded the work of professional anthropologists during this time period. Photographer Edward S. Curtis (1868‚Äì1952) was preceded by painter George Catlin (1796‚Äì1872) in attempting to capture indigenous North American traditions that they believed to be disappearing. Both Curtis and Catlin have been accused of taking artistic license by embellishing a scene or making something appear more authentically \\"Native American\\". Curtis notes in the introduction to his series on the North American Indian: \\"The information that is to be gathered ... respecting the mode of life of one of the great races of mankind, must be collected at once or the opportunity will be lost.\\" This statement reflects the artist's paternalistic concern for documenting the culture of American Indians and is representative of both the popular and academic sentiment of the time. Salvage ethnography started to be applied methodically in visual anthropology as ethnographic film since the 1950s by filmmakers such as Jean Rouch in France, Michel Brault and Pierre Perrault in Canada, or Ant√≥nio Campos in Portugal (early 1960s), followed by others (1970s). Salvage ethnography is often taught in film and media studies courses as a style of filmmaking that captures a civilization or people's former way of living. The best example of this would be Robert Flaherty's Nanook of the North. In Nanook, Flaherty staged incidents and scenes that did not fairly represent the Inuit tribe's current way of life, but rather their \\"former majesty\\".

Krauss was born in Vienna to Clementine Krauss, then a 15-year-old dancer in the Vienna Imperial Opera Ballet, later a leading actress and operetta singer, niece of the prominent nineteenth-century operatic soprano Gabrielle Krauss. His natural father, Chevalier Hector (1851-1916),Notes to a reissue of Krauss' Decca recordings of the orchestral music of Richard Strauss, Testament SBT1184 came from a family of wealthy Phanariot bankers resident in Vienna. Baltazzi's older sister Helene was married to Baron Albin Vetsera and was the mother of Baroness Mary Vetsera, who was accordingly Clemens Krauss' first cousin. http://geneweb.inria.fr/roglo?lang=fr;m=N;v=baltazzi Baltazzi family tree Krauss sang in the Hofkapelle (Imperial Choir) as a Vienna Choir Boy. He graduated from the Vienna Conservatory in 1912, after studying composition with Hermann Graedener and theory with Richard Heuberger there. He was then appointed chorus master in the Brno Theater (1912-1913), where he made his conducting debut in 1913. The famous Romanian soprano Viorica Ursuleac, who often sang under him, became his second wife. Career Krauss made the rounds of regional centers, conducting in Riga (1913-1914), Nuremberg (1915) and Stettin (1916-1921) (formerly part of Pomerania in Germany; now part of Poland). The latter appointment gave him ample opportunity to travel to Berlin to hear Arthur Nikisch conduct the Berlin Philharmonic, a major influence. He then returned to Austria as director of the opera and symphony concerts in Graz. In 1922, he joined the conducting staff of the Vienna State Opera and teacher of the conducting class in the Vienna Singakademie. He conducted the Vienna Tonk√ºnstler concerts from 1923 to 1927, and was Intendant of the opera in Frankfurt and director of the Museum concerts there from 1924 to 1929. He guest-conducted in the United States in 1929, with the Philadelphia Orchestra and New York Philharmonic. Also in 1929, he was appointed director of the Vienna State Opera. Its orchestra, which was part of the independent concert entity known as the Vienna Philharmonic, appointed him its music director in 1930. He was a regular conductor at the Salzburg Festival from 1926 to 1934, where in 1930 he conducted Alban Berg's avant-garde atonal opera Wozzeck. Krauss gave up his Vienna positions in 1933-34 to direct the Berlin State Opera in 1935 after Erich Kleiber had resigned in protest against Nazi policies. In 1933, he took over the preparations for the premieres of Richard Strauss's opera Arabella after the departure of conductor Fritz Busch (another non-Jewish anti-Nazi).All Music Guide Biography Krauss's own position on Nazism was unclear, although he did enjoy a close relationship with Nazi official Alfred Frauenfeld and it has been claimed that he sought Nazi Party membership in 1933.Michael H. Kater, The Twisted Muse: Musicians and Their Music in the Third Reich, 1999, p. 52 However, throughout the 1930s he and his wife were involved in helping Jews escape from Germany. After befriending British novelist Ida Cook and her sister Mary, both opera fans, he gave cover to their smuggling operation (started after Viorica asked the Cooks to assist a Jewish friend). Munich Opera House shows were arranged around the times and cities that the Cooks needed to make contact with escapees.BBC News: The opera-loving sisters who 'stumbled' into heroism (28/1/2017) In 1937, he was appointed Intendant of the National Theatre Munich following Hans Knappertsbusch's resignation. He became a close friend of Strauss, and even wrote the libretto for his opera Capriccio which he premiered in Munich in 1942. He also conducted the premieres of Strauss's operas Friedenstag and Die Liebe der Danae. During the early 1940s, he taught at the Mozarteum University of Salzburg where among his pupils was composer Roman Toi. After the Munich opera house had been destroyed by Allied bombing, Krauss returned to conduct the Vienna Philharmonic in 1944-45 until it ceased activities shortly before the end of World War II. After the war, Allied officials investigated his career and forbade him from appearing in public until 1947, when it emerged that he had helped Jews escape from the Third Reich. Krauss then resumed conducting many of the Vienna Philharmonic's concerts, including its famous annual New Year's Day pops concerts featuring Johann and Josef Strauss waltzes, overtures and polkas, many of which were recorded for Decca along with other studio recordings of mostly Johann, Josef and Richard Strauss. He conducted opera at Covent Garden in London starting in 1951, and at the 1953 Bayreuth Festival (including an impressive Wagner Ring cycle now available on CD, starring Astrid Varnay as Brunnhilde). He also recorded a highly regarded Parsifal at Bayreuth, starring Martha M√∂dl as Kundry, in 1953, at the height of M√∂dl's brief prime. He died in 1954 while on tour with the Vienna Philharmonic in Mexico City, and is buried alongside his wife, singer Viorica Ursuleac, who died in 1985, in Ehrwald, Austria. Walk of Fame Vienna Krauss made relatively few recordings; they include his 1950 Decca rendition of Johann Strauss II's Die Fledermaus, with the Vienna Philharmonic and State Opera star soloists (not including any of the dialogue; only the second complete recording after a pre‚ÄìWorld War I acoustical 78 set made in Berlin). His 1953 live performance of Richard Wagner's Ring Cycle from Bayreuth has been released on disc. A performance with the Vienna Symphony of Beethoven's Choral Fantasy, reissued on more than one inexpensive label since its original appearance on a Vox LP, is also one of the few recordings featuring pianist Friedrich W√ºhrer. All three have been reissued on compact disc. References BibliographyMaschat, Erik (1971). ‚ÄúClemens Krauss,‚Äù trans.

This installment was developed to be a sequel to The Original Series episode \\"The Tholian Web\\" and a prequel to \\"Mirror, Mirror\\". The decision to set an Enterprise episode in the mirror universe originated with a pitch to enable William Shatner to appear in the series. The teleplays for both parts of the episode were written by Mike Sussman, with Manny Coto contributing the story for the second part. Set in the 22nd century, the series normally follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship Enterprise, registration NX-01. However, these installments feature a mirror universe Jonathan Archer and evil counterparts of the normal characters, who serve the cruel and militaristic Terran Empire. In the first part, the ISS Enterprise learns of a Starfleet ship from the future of the main universe which is being stripped for parts by the Tholians, and seeks to take the ship from the aliens. The second part sees the surviving crew operating the USS Defiant and seeking to overthrow the Empire using its advanced weaponry. The episode saw the reuse of footage from Star Trek: First Contact and the creation of an alternative opening credits sequence which included footage from other Paramount properties such as the film The Hunt for Red October. A three-quarters-around bridge from The Original Series era was constructed, as well as other sets from a Constitution-class starship. A Gorn and a Tholian were both created using CGI, with the Gorn using motion capture techniques. This installment also saw the return of Vaughn Armstrong as Admiral Maxwell Forrest after his main universe character was killed on screen earlier in the season in the episode \\"The Forge\\". This episode subsequently appeared in several lists of the best episodes of Star Trek: Enterprise. It was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Hairstyling for a Series in 2005. Plot = Part I = In 2063, a Vulcan ship lands on Earth, making first contact with humans (as seen in Star Trek: First Contact). Instead of peacefully greeting them, Zefram Cochrane shoots the lead Vulcan and the humans storm and loot the ship. In 2155, Doctor Phlox and Major Reed demonstrate a new torture device to Captain Forrest and Commander Archer on the ISS Enterprise. Archer suggests to Forrest they travel into Tholian space, as he has heard rumors of technology they might wish to steal. The two argue, and Forrest returns to his quarters where he is comforted by Lieutenant Sato. When he leaves, he is ambushed by Archer and several MACOs (a military team) and sent to the brig. Archer travels to the bridge and announces that he has taken command. After torturing a Tholian pilot for coordinates, he orders a change of course to the shipyard, and tells Commander T'Pol, whom he promotes to first officer, to install a Suliban cloaking device with Commander Tucker. Archer also appoints Sergeant Mayweather as his personal guard, and Sato proposes that she keep her job as Captain's woman. Archer has Sato send a message to Starfleet about their mission to raid the Tholian technology. Tucker is injured when the cloaking device is sabotaged. Archer questions Forrest, who denies all knowledge, and Reed tortures Tucker expecting him to be the saboteur. T'Pol leads a team to free Forrest and reclaim the ship, but Archer encrypts navigation control to prevent a course change. Forrest tortures Archer, but orders his release after he receives word that Starfleet agrees with Archer's plans. Archer shows images of an alternate universe vessel from the future named USS Defiant (a Constitution-class starship, last seen in \\"The Tholian Web\\"), that has technology and power that is a century more advanced than ISS Enterprise. On arriving at the shipyard, Archer, T'Pol, and Tucker transport across, and Tucker begins powering up the vessel. Tholian vessels then attack, creating an energy web around Enterprise. Forrest orders the crew to abandon ship but remains behind as the ship is destroyed. =Part II= Several Tholian ships then create a web over the opening of the dock to prevent Defiant from leaving. T'Pol and Tucker restore power to the weapon systems, allowing Defiant to destroy enough enemy vessels to escape the trap. They recover 47 survivors from Enterprise, and Tucker is ordered to restore power to the warp drive. Sato goes to the captain's quarters and finds Archer perusing the ship's historical records, which includes parallel universe information about Starfleet, the United Federation of Planets, and their service records. Archer is surprised to learn his counterpart is an acclaimed and distinguished explorer, diplomat and politician. Ensign Kelby is killed trying to repair the warp drive, and the crew discover, from Tholian slaves left on board, that a Gorn named Slar has sabotaged the ship. Archer, after hearing voices telling him to achieve more fame and honor, decides to lead an assault team and kills the Gorn. Tucker is able to repair the warp drive and the ship then leaves to rendezvous with the ISS Avenger, arriving in time to save it from four rebel spacecraft. Avenger commanding officer Admiral Black comes aboard for an inspection accompanied by his first officer, Soval. After Black refuses Archer's request for captaincy of the new ship, Archer disintegrates him with a phaser pistol. Archer gives a speech to the officers of both ships, saying that they should move against Starfleet and the Empire. Soval and T'Pol meet, contemplating a future where alien species are respected and treated as equals; they convince Phlox to join their movement and sabotage Defiant. As the sole alien allowed to remain on board, he succeeds in disabling the ship's systems. Soval, on Avenger, then attacks, but Tucker disables Phlox and restores power. Defiant destroys its attacker. When Sato and Archer celebrate in the captain's quarters, Archer dies after being poisoned by Sato and we see that Mayweather is now in league with Sato. Reaching Earth on the advanced and powerful Defiant, Sato contacts Admiral Gardner, demanding his surrender and declaring herself \\"Empress Sato\\". Production =Writing and filming= The idea to include the mirror universe in Enterprise originated from a pitch which would have featured William Shatner. The idea of returning to the mirror universe in Enterprise was first suggested by Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens. In \\"Mirror, Mirror\\", the tantalus field was used on several occasions and was thought to be a disintegrator. The Reeves-Stevenses proposed that it could be explained that instead of killing its victims, the field instead transported them back through time to a penal colony in the main universe. The Enterprise would then come across the penal colony, meeting Tiberius, portrayed by William Shatner. Tiberius would seek to use the transporter aboard the Enterprise to return to his own universe, but discovers that it has not yet diverged from the main universe and does not exist. The episode would then have explored the creation of the mirror universe through actions by Tiberius and Captain Archer. The storyline was pitched by Shatner, who had worked with the Reeves-Stevenses on the Shatnerverse series of Star Trek novels, to Manny Coto, Brannon Braga and Rick Berman. Berman had already received a pitch by Mike Sussman that would have Shatner portray an ancestor of Captain Kirk, who happened to be the chef on the Enterprise (NX-01). The three pitched the idea to Shatner, but negotiations fell through and terms were not agreed on for him to appear on the show. Sussman began development on a script that saw the USS Defiant from \\"The Tholian Web\\" being brought back in time, instead of Tiberius. It was intended to be a sequel to that episode, as well as a prequel to \\"Mirror, Mirror\\". Sussman developed the teleplays for both parts of the episode, with Coto contributing the story for the second half. It was decided to have the entire installment in the mirror universe in order to maintain the events of \\"Mirror, Mirror\\" as being first contact between the two universes. The mirror universe features evil duplicates of the characters from the normal universe. Sussman had previously sought to use the Defiant in the second-season episode \\"Future Tense\\", but both costs and issues with the plot resulted in it being replaced with a previously unseen timeship. The first part of \\"In a Mirror, Darkly\\" was the 700th live-action Star Trek episode broadcast. On the sixth day of filming the second part of the episode, news was received that Star Trek: Enterprise had been cancelled by UPN as of the end of the season, which meant that \\"In a Mirror, Darkly\\" would be installments 94 and 95 of Enterprise 98-episode run. \\"In a Mirror, Darkly\\" was Sussman's final contribution to the show; he had previously been a staff writer on Star Trek: Voyager and worked in the Star Trek franchise for ten years. He later described it as his favorite episode of Star Trek, saying that \\"I knew when I was writing them that they would almost certainly be the last episodes I would be writing for this particular incarnation of Star Trek, so I really treasured the experience.\\" Part of Manny Coto's plans for season five of Enterprise would have included a return to the mirror universe crew first seen in \\"In a Mirror, Darkly\\". It would have been across four or five installments, which Coto described as a \\"mini-series within a series\\". =Visual effects and costuming= The opening sequence featured the reuse of footage from Star Trek: First Contact, where Zefram Cochrane makes first contact with the Vulcans, for which both James Cromwell and Cully Fredricksen agreed to accept Screen Actors Guild minimum salaries. Herman Zimmerman had kept the lower portion of the Vulcan vessel from that scene, and made it available to use for reshoots. While Enterprise was normally shot in digital, the mirror-First Contact scenes were shot on film so that they would match the appearance of the original footage. An alternative opening credits sequence was created, which Sussman credited Coto for. It featured footage used in other Paramount Pictures productions, including the Soviet nuclear submarine Konovalov firing a torpedo from The Hunt for Red October. Other elements include an atomic explosion, battleships, tanks and fighter jets. Zimmerman led the construction of a full three-quarters around set to represent the bridge of the USS Defiant, which was used from the final day of filming the first part of this episode. It was the first time that a bridge set of that scale from a Constitution-class starship from The Original Series had been used since the final episode \\"Turnabout Intruder\\" was aired in 1969. Senior illustrator Doug Drexler was involved in the design; he had previously worked on the research that went into re-creating parts of The Original Series era USS Enterprise for the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode \\"Trials and Tribble-ations\\", as well as a set which was exhibited in Hyde Park in London. Other designers included in the creation of the set were Anna Packard, Michael Okuda and James Van Over. The actual construction of the set was in the hands of Tom Arp and his team. Sussman said of the set, \\"I think the bridge set is remarkable. I hope fans will be thrilled to see that set again in all of its glory. I feel that it probably looks better than the original in many respects, if you compare them side by side.\\" This episode saw the return of Original Series style uniforms, with the wraparound green tunic worn by Scott Bakula as Jonathan Archer. The bridge of the Enterprise had previously been recreated twice in Star Trek series since the end of The Original Series. In the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"Relics\\", only the engineering console was reconstructed, with the Captain's chair and the navigation consoles rented from a fan and the remaining consoles were edited in digitally using blue screens. Incomplete sets were also recreated for the Deep Space Nine episode \\"Trials and Tribble- ations\\", but these involved digitally inserting the actors into previous footage of The Original Series and so a full bridge set was not recreated. Further sets for the Defiant were created for the second part of the episode, which included designs previously used in \\"Trials and Tribble-ations\\" for the Jefferies tube. The other sets included the Rec Room, Captain's quarters and the briefing room. Classic Original Series style uniforms were worn by some the main cast in the second installment; however, the production crew mistakenly gave the USS Defiant a unique uniform insignia different from the iconic delta (arrowhead) badge. This mistake likely stemmed from the erroneous fan theory that every starship in TOS had its own unique insignia. In the TOS episode \\"The Tholian Web\\" we clearly see the dead crew of the Defiant wearing the delta badge. Bakula wore the wrap-around green uniform previously worn by Shatner in several episodes including \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\", while Trinneer, Keating and Montgomery donned red shirts. Bakula joked \\"Did we run out of material for Jolene's skirt?\\" as Blalock wore the science-blue miniskirt in the style of that worn by Christine Chapel. The normal Enterprise costumes also underwent changes, with those worn by female members of the crew having a portion removed to reveal their midriffs. Original Series props such as phasers and PADDs were also created for the episode. Despite the mirror- Enterprise being destroyed in the first installment, during the second episode the standing sets were reused to represent the ISS Avenger. Both a Tholian and a Gorn were created in post production using CGI. The Gorn in particular required an actor in a tracking suit to allow the actors to interact with the character and give the animators something to overlay the CGI on. Stunt coordinator Vince Deadrick, Jr. wore the suit for scenes that required movement, while David Anderson wore it for static shots. Sussman also wrote biographies for Archer and Hoshi that would briefly appear on screen. Included in these were references to Archer becoming President of the Federation and that a planet called Archer IV that had previously appeared in Star Trek: The Next Generation was in fact named after him. =Casting= \\"In a Mirror, Darkly\\" saw the return of Vaughn Armstrong to Enterprise as the mirror universe version of his previous character. The episode saw the return of Vaughn Armstrong as Captain Maximilian Forest. His main universe character, Rear Admiral Maxwell Forest, had been killed earlier in the season in the episode \\"The Forge\\". Both Bakula and Armstrong joked about the character suffering two deaths during the same season, although Armstrong also said of the relationship between mirror-Forrest and mirror-Hoshi that \\"In 25 years [of acting], I haven't gotten the girl, but I come back here and I get the girl! This is great.\\" Gary Graham returned as the Vulcan Soval, who was a science officer aboard the Avenger in the mirror universe rather than his normal position of the Vulcan Ambassador. Graham was given a goatee beard in reference to the mirror universe Spock from \\"Mirror, Mirror\\". Other guest stars in \\"In a Mirror, Darkly\\" included Gregory Itzin, who had previously appeared as a Vulcan commando in \\"Shadows of P'Jem\\" as well as episodes of Star Trek: Voyager and Deep Space Nine. Derek Magyar returned for his third appearance as Kelby after previously appearing in \\"Affliction\\" and \\"Bound\\". Writer Mike Sussman also appeared on screen, as one of the dead Defiant crew- members. With this episode, actress Majel Barrett, widow of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry, became the only actor to participate in every Star Trek series, including the Animated Series, as well as both the Original Series- based and Next Generation-based film series. In this episode, she provided the voice of the starship Defiants computer. Her voice continued to be used as that of Starfleet computers after the cancellation of Enterprise in the J. J. Abrams led Star Trek films. These installments saw significant changes to the characters of the main cast. Linda Park, who plays Hoshi Sato in the series, later said that they were her favorite episodes of the show. She later explained that \\"Mirror Hoshi was strong in the way that Medea is strong, in the way that Clytemnestra is strong, in this very archetypal, warrior-woman way.\\" She credited the role she played in this episode as demonstrating that she could play a tougher character, something which allowed her to gain other roles once the series ended.  Connections  The Gorn featured in this episode, was previously introduced to the Star Trek science fiction universe in the original series episode \\"Arena\\", which aired January 19, 1967. In that case a Gorn costume was used, while a computer generated graphic was used for this Star Trek Enterprise episode. Reception The first part of \\"In a Mirror, Darkly\\" aired on April 22, 2005, on UPN in the United States. It received a 2.0/3% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 2 percent of all households, and 3 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast. This placed UPN fifth out of the major networks during the installment's hour of broadcast, ahead of The WB. This was the only time during the primetime hours that UPN placed ahead of The WB. The second part aired the following week on April 29. Ratings were similar to the first episode, with another 2.0/3% score recorded, and again placing fifth during the timeslot ahead of The WB. =Critical response= David Bianculli at the Daily News thought that \\"In a Mirror, Darkly\\" was the best episode of Enterprise so far and enjoyed that the actors could play against type for their characters. He gave the episode a score of three and a half out of four and said that it was so much fun that \\"had they adopted this attitude from the start, \\"Enterprise\\" probably would still be flying missions next season.\\" When reviewing the first part for TrekNation, Michelle Erica Green said that her favorite part was the modified opening sequence, and described it as \\"fun and lighthearted in a twisted sort of way\\" but thought that the closing episodes of the series would have been better if they had concentrated on the real crew and ship. She thought that the second installment saw the series \\"stretching a clever idea too thin\\", and that a \\"one-hour 'Mirror' would have made more sense in terms of the pacing and for Enterprise as a whole.\\" Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website Jammer's Reviews gave the first episode a score of three out of four, and the second part a score of two and a half. He described it as an \\"evil comic book\\", and regarding the first part, \\"To call this episode over-the-top would be an understatement. This is a go-for-broke hour of lunatic madness.\\" His view on the second part was that the re-created sets were impressive, but \\"it goes so far over the top that it comes back around and kicks itself in its own ass. It's overplayed, overacted, and over-goofy.\\" \\"In a Mirror, Darkly\\" has been featured in several \\"Best of\\" episode lists. In 2009, it was ranked the best episode of Star Trek: Enterprise by James Hunt at the website Den of Geek. He said that \\"although the novelty value of seeing the cast playing cartoonishly evil versions of themselves is a good enough reason to watch this 2-parter, \\"In a Mirror, Darkly\\" manages to include some of Enterprise most inventive moments, not least the revised opening credits\\". Empire magazine ranked it the second best episode behind \\"Terra Prime\\". Jay Garmon at TechRepublic ranked it as the fifth best episode, saying that the writers managed to include a \\"gleefully malicious and fatal series of unexpected double-crosses, but also work in some of the most satisfying and coherent mythology gags that Enterprise ever displayed\\". In a list of the top 100 episodes of the Star Trek franchise, \\"In a Mirror, Darkly\\" was placed in 40th place by Charlie Jane Anders at io9. In 2009, Den of Geek ranked this the number one best episode of this television series. W.I.R.E.D. (United Kingdom edition) recommended \\"In a Mirror, Darkly\\" as one of the best episodes of the franchise, in their review of episodes to watch on a video streaming service. In 2017, SyFy ranked this the fifth best mirror universe episode of Star Trek, which they note is a two-part episode and ties in with the lost USS Defiant spacecraft of the original series. In 2016, Empire ranked this the 46th best out of the top 50 episodes of all the 700 plus Star Trek television episodes. In 2017, Vulture.com noted \\"In a Mirror, Darkly\\" as an episode where the show \\"Hit its stride\\", also noting the Borderland trilogy which featured actor Brent Spiner. =Awards and nominations= Laura Connolly, Roma Goddard and Michael Moore were nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Hairstyling For A Series for their work on this episode. The award instead went to an episode of Deadwood. Home media release \\"In a Mirror, Darkly\\" was first released for home viewing as part of the Star Trek: Enterprise series four box set. It was released on region one DVD in the United States on November 1, 2005. The set included a fifteen- minute-long documentary on the origins of the episode and background to the mirror universe in general as well as audio commentary from Mike Sussman and Tim Gaskill on both parts of the episode. The commentary had previously been released on the official Star Trek website, where Gaskill is the editorial director. It subsequently became one of three Enterprise episodes to be included in the Star Trek: Alternative Realities Collective DVD set which was released in 2009. The other episodes were \\"E¬≤\\" and \\"Twilight\\", and also featured were other mirror universe installments including \\"Mirror, Mirror\\" and three of those from Deep Space Nine. The Blu-ray edition was released on April 1, 2014.

It tells the story of two lovers, separated by destiny, who meet again one day. This encounter allows each to realize the truth about the lives they are living. It is an adaptation of the 1905 short story The Gift of the Magi by O. Henry. The film won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi and was nominated for the Crystal Globe for Best Feature Film at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival. Rai also won the Zee Cine Award for Critics' Choice Best Actress and was nominated for the Filmfare Best Actress Award and Star Screen Award Best Actress. Plot  The story begins with unemployed Mannu (Ajay Devgn), from Bhagalpur in search of money to finance his new business as he has lost his earlier job at a jute mill. On his quest, he visits Neeru (Aishwarya Rai) in Calcutta, to whom he was engaged six years ago. During the rainy evening, the couple reminisce about their former love and how each ended up in their current situation. Neeru pretends to lead a happy and prosperous life. She gestures to her former lover during various instances, particularly when the door bell rings and she persuades Mannu not to open the door. They go on talking about their past and present with multiple flashbacks. The raincoat comes to play when Neeru wears it to go out and fetch some food. The landlord (Annu Kapoor) speaks of the real situation of the household, and prompts Mannu to give his borrowed money as rent for the house. Mannu leaves a letter under the bed sheet explaining things. When Neeru returns he does not say anything about his encounter with her landlord. After some time Mannu leaves. Later, when he puts his hand inside the pocket of his raincoat, he finds a pair of gold bangles that belonged to Neeru, along with a letter saying that she had a lot of money and he should have told her about his financial situation. She had actually read a letter that was inside the raincoat that informed her about Mannu's condition. CastAjay Devgn as Manoj \\"Mannu\\" *Aishwarya Rai as Neerja \\"Neeru\\" *Surekha Sikri as Mannu's mother *Annu Kapoor as Landlord * Sameer Dharmadhikari (as Sammeer) as Alok *Mauli Ganguly Fake Shaina * Pradip Adhikari * Kailash Koppikar * Kameshwar Mishra * Dilip Patra * Sampooran Singh Gulzar Soundtrack Debajyoti Mishra experimented with the music of the film. The songs are all background numbers. Famous classical singer Shubha Mudgal lends her voice for the title track. Songs are listed below. The song \\"Piya Tora Kaisa Abhimaan\\" is sung by Raghav Chattopadhya and not by Hariharan. Hariharan had recorded this song for the film but the picturisation of this song is by Raghav Chattopadhya. Critical response The Times Of India gave a three stars out of five. Rediff cited \\"Some films attempt to showcase a series of wonderful moments and tend to go overboard. Raincoat captures just one poignant moment and tells it as simply it can, leaving you with a wow. For someone heralded as the most beautiful woman in the world, Aishwarya Rai looks terrifyingly depressing in the film. Her Neeru looks cynical to the point of suicide. And that's a compliment. Her body language is a strange mix of a passive housewife and a passionate girlfriend. Though the effort to sound rustic shows, the restraint in her dialogue delivery and performance is commendable. Hesitation, desperation, humiliation  Ajay Devgan conveys them eloquently. He particularly stands out in the scenes where he cries in the bathroom, or begs Neeru not to marry someone else\\". The Hindu stated \\"Raincoat... essentially a chamber piece, it weaves a narrative with just two characters in most of the frames. Raincoat can easily be Aishwarya Rai's best performance, and as Neerja, the former beauty queen appears to have shed her inhibitions about looking unglamorous. In fact, most of time, Rai looks quite plain. What is more, she seems to have made an earnest effort to emote, using less of her body and limbs and more of her face, and eyes in particular. Ajay Devagan as Manoj is Devagan, as we have seen him in an umpteen number of parts earlier, although Ghosh draws the actor out of a certain woodenness that he is known for\\". Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama said \\"On the whole, Raincoat will appeal to a handful of critics and connoisseurs of art house cinema who'll heap lavish praises/lustrous words, but from the box-office point of view, Raincoat will face stormy weather at the ticket window\\". Derek Elley from Variety (magazine) described it as \\"Raincoat is a chamber-sized gem. Melancholic, rainy afternoon drama, almost entirely set in a single house, features meaty roles for two of Indian cinema's biggest stars, Aishwarya Rai and Ajay Devgan, in very different guises from their usual Bollywood ones. Though pic is unlikely to score big locally when it goes out in August against more commercial heavy-hitters like Swades and The Rising, Raincoat could build a solid rep at fests, with some pickups by specialized webs and niche distribs. As in Ghosh's previous pic, \\"Chokher Bali: A Passion Play\\" (2003), Rai reveals herself as a considerable actress given the right script and direction, far from the comic-romantic roles in most of her Bollywood productions. Shunning her usual immaculate makeup and duds, and looking more like a broken, malfunctioning doll, she makes Niru a mixture of child and temptress/charmer, driven by capricious moods and clearly unhappy inside. It's the showier of the two perfs, but Devgan, in ultra low-key mode, is equally impressive, especially in the latter stages as his great love for the woman he once knew reveals itself in an act of charity\\". Box office Raincoat grossed 48.76 million worldwide. The film was a commercial failure at the box office. Record Raincoat holds the record of completing shoot in 16 days.

While having the same acronym, the KITTs are two different entities: one known as the Knight Industries Two Thousand, which appeared in the original TV series Knight Rider, and the other as the Knight Industries Three Thousand, which appeared first in the two-hour 2008 pilot film for a new Knight Rider TV series and then the new series itself. In both instances, KITT is an artificially intelligent talking electronic computer module in the body of a highly advanced, very mobile, robotic automobile: the original Knight Industries Two Thousand as a 1982 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am, and the Knight Industries Three Thousand as a 2008‚Äì2009 Ford Shelby GT500KR. During filming, KITT was voiced by a script assistant, with voice actors recording KITT's dialog later. David Hasselhoff and original series voice actor William Daniels did not meet each other until six months after the series began filming. KITT's evil twin is KARR, which is an acronym of Knight Automated Roving Robot. KARR was first voiced by Peter Cullen and later voiced by the late legendary voice actor Paul Frees in season one and season three of the NBC original TV series, respectively, of Knight Rider. A 1991 sequel film, Knight Rider 2000, centered on KITT's original microprocessor unit transferred into the body of the vehicle intended to be his successor, the Knight Industries Four Thousand (Knight 4000), voiced by Carmen Argenziano and as well as later once again voiced by William Daniels. Val Kilmer voiced KITT Knight Industries Three Thousand in the 2008‚Äì2009 Knight Rider series. Knight Industries Two Thousand (KITT) Wider view of the Universal Studios attraction 1:25 Ertl Company KITT toy model The character of KITT (Knight Industries Two Thousand) in the original Knight Rider series was physically embodied as a modified 1982 Pontiac Trans Am. General Motors provided the first two vehicles off the assembly line for the pilot film. In the television show's history, the first KITT (Knight Industries Two Thousand) (voiced by William Daniels) was designed by the late Wilton Knight, a brilliant but eccentric billionaire and founder of the Foundation for Law And Government (FLAG) and its parent Knight Industries. The 2008 pilot film later implied that Charles Graiman, creator of the Knight Industries Three Thousand (voiced by Val Kilmer), also had a hand in designing the first KITT Knight Industries Two Thousand. According to the series, the original KITT's main cybernetic processor was first installed in a mainframe computer used by the US government in Washington, D.C. However, Wilton saw better use for \\"him\\" in the Foundation's crime-fighting crusade and eventually the artificial intelligence system was installed in the Knight Industries vehicle. KITT was actually the second vehicle built by Knight Industries with talking artificial intelligence. His evil twin vehicle predecessor was KARR, the Knight Automated Roving Robot. KARR was programmed for self-preservation, villainy but this proved to be dangerous to the Foundation's humanitarian interests. KARR was later deactivated and placed in storage while KITT was given to his new operator, Michael Knight. KARR was later unwittingly reactivated by thieves in the original episode \\"Trust Doesn't Rust\\", was initially thought destroyed, then successfully reappeared in the episode \\"K.I.T.T. vs. K.A.R.R\\" and was seen to be finally destroyed by Michael and KITT once and for all. While the 2008 pilot movie and then the new series appears to be a revamp of the original series, it actually offers some continuity from the original TV series. The \\"new\\" or \\"second\\" KITT (Knight Industries Three Thousand) is a very different vehicle and microprocessor unit. The original Knight Industries Two Thousand is also shown in the pilot movie (although again in pieces) in the scene where the garage of Charles Graiman (creator of the Knight Industries Three Thousand and implied co-designer of the original KITT) is searched by antagonists. A Pontiac Trans-Am body (without its hood) is partially covered by a tarp, on which rests the rear spoiler. The famous KITT steering wheel (labelled \\"Knight Two Thousand\\") and \\"KNIGHT\\" license plate are also shown, along with numerous black muscle car body parts. When the camera shows a full scene of the garage, there are three cars in the garage: the 3000, a 2000 under a tarp, and a complete 2000. The 1991 movie Knight Rider 2000 saw the first KITT (Knight Industries Two Thousand) all in pieces, and Michael Knight himself reviving the Knight 2000 microprocessor unit, which is eventually transferred into the new body of the vehicle intended to be the original KITT's direct successor, the Knight 4000. The new vehicle was a modified 1991 Dodge Stealth, appearing similar to the Pontiac Banshee prototype. However, no reference to this storyline nor any appearance of the Knight 4000 is made in the new series or its 2008 pilot movie. In Knight Rider 2000, it is stated that most if not all of the Knight 2000 parts had been sold off. However, Graiman's garage in the 2008 pilot shows a more complete collection of parts than in the boxes recovered by Michael Knight in Knight Rider 2000. This adds to the mystique of the current whereabouts of the original KITT in the time frame of the new Knight Rider series. In the 1997‚Äì1998 spin-off series Team Knight Rider, KITT is employed as a shadow advisor. It is later revealed that \\"The Shadow\\" is actually a hologram run by KITT. In \\"Knight of the Living Dead\\", Graiman states a third KITT exists as a backup. When KITT is about to die, his memories are downloaded so the third KITT can use them. However, in the end the third AI is unfortunately not used. =Features= KITT has a red front-mounted scanner bar that, among other things, allows it to see, and is a nod to the Cylons. These were the villains from the TV series Battlestar Galactica, which had been created by Glen A. Larson, who also created Knight Rider and even used the iconic Cylon eye scanner audio to that effect. A refit in the 1985‚Äì86 final season included the addition of \\"Super Pursuit Mode\\" and a convertible top. ;Computer AI :KITT is an advanced supercomputer on wheels. The \\"brain\\" of KITT is the Knight 2000 microprocessor, which is the centre of a \\"self-aware\\" cybernetic logic module. This allows KITT to think, learn, communicate and interact with humans. He is also capable of independent thought and action. He always had an ego that was easy to bruise and displayed a very sensitive, but kind and dryly humorous personality. He also has an in-dash entertainment system that can play music and video, and run various computer programs including arcade games. According to Episode 55, \\"Dead of Knight\\", KITT has 1,000 megabits of memory with one nanosecond access time. According to Episode 65, \\"Ten Wheel Trouble\\", KITT's future capacity is unlimited. KITT's serial number is AD227529, as mentioned in Episode 31, \\"Soul Survivor\\". ;Alpha Circuit :KITT's \\"Alpha Circuit\\" is part of KITT's main control system, which allows the CPU to drive the car. The time KITT's \\"evil vehicle twin\\" KARR spent submerged in water damaged his Alpha Circuit, which required KARR to instead have an operator to control his Turbo Boost function. ;Molecular Bonded Shell :KITT is armored with \\"Tri-Helical Plasteel 1000 MBS\\" (Molecular Bonded Shell) plating which protects him from almost all forms of conventional firearms and explosive devices. He can only be harmed by heavy artillery and rockets, and even then, the blast usually left most of his body intact and only damaged internal components. This makes KITT's body durable enough to act as a shield for explosives, ram through rigid barriers of strong material without suffering damage himself and sustain frequent long jumps on turbo boost. The shell also protected him from fire. However, it was vulnerable to electricity, as seen in the episode \\"Lost Knight\\" (season 3 episode 10), when a surge of electricity shorted out his memory. The shell was also vulnerable to some potent acids and, in episode 70 \\"Knight Of The Juggernaut\\", a formula was made (with knowledge of the shell's chemical base) to neutralize it completely. The shell is a combination of three secret substances together referred to as the Knight Compound, developed by Wilton Knight, who entrusted parts of the formula to three separate people, who each know only two pieces of the formula. The shell provided a frame tolerance of 223,000 lb (111.5 tons) and a front and rear axle suspension load of 57,000 lb (28.5 tons). In the pilot, \\"Knight of the Phoenix\\", the shell is described as the panels of the car itself; in later episodes, especially from season two onward, the idea of the shell being applied to a base vehicle chemically is used. ;Pyroclastic Lamination : KITT is protected by a thermal- resistant coating that can withstand sustained temperatures of up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit (426 ¬∞C). First used in Episode 32, \\"Ring of Fire\\". ;Power System :KITT is powered by the Knight Industries turbojet, with modified afterburners and a computer controlled 8-speed turbodrive transmission. This helps him do 0‚Äì60 mph in 2 seconds (1.37g), standing to quarter mile 4.286 seconds. Electromagnetic hyper-vacuum disc brakes: 14 foot (4.25 m) braking distance (70‚Äì0 mph ‚Äì 112‚Äì0 km/h - 11.7g). KITT and KARR Voice Modulator KITT instrumentation (1st/2nd seasons) KITT instrumentation (3rd/4th seasons) ;Turbo Boost :Used in most episodes, this is a pair of rocket boosters mounted just behind the front tires. These lifted the car, allowing KITT to jump into the air and pass over obstacles in the road. Also, occasionally, Turbo Boost was used to allow KITT to accelerate to incredible speeds in excess of 200 mph (322 km/h). The boosters could fire forward or backward. ;Voice (Anharmonic) Synthesizer :KITT's Voice Synthesizer (\\"mouth\\") allows his logic module to speak and communicate. With it, KITT can also simulate other sounds. KITT's primary spoken language was English; however, by accessing his language module, he could speak fluently in Spanish, French and much more. The module can be adjusted, giving KITT different accents such as in Episode 82, \\"Out of the Woods\\", where KITT uses a \\"New York City\\" accent and called Michael \\"Micky\\". During the initial half of the first season as well as the pilot, KITT's \\"mouth\\" in the interior of the vehicle was a flashing red square. In episode 14 \\"Heart of Stone\\", this was changed to three red sectioned vertical bars, as this design proved popular with fans as part of KARR Knight Automated Roving Robot. ;Voice Projection: KITT can project his voice at any position. First used in Episode 48, \\"Knight of the Drones, Pt. 2\\". ;Anamorphic Equalizer :KITT has a front scan bar called the Anamorphic Equalizer. The device is a fibre-optic array of electronic eyes. The scanner can see in all visual wavelengths, as well as X-ray and infrared. Occasionally, the bar can pulse in different patterns and sweep rapidly or very slowly. The scanner is also KITT's most vulnerable area. ;Etymotic Equalizer :This system allows KITT to hear sound. An array of audio sensors is threaded throughout his interior and exterior. ;Olfactory Sensor :KITT can \\"smell\\" via an atmospheric sampling device mounted in his front bumper. ;Microscanners : Microscanners are tiny audio and visual sensors embedded into the grooves of KITT's body. They allow for visual tracking and display of anything around the car. ;Cruise Modes :KITT has four drive modes: :* Normal Cruise ‚Äì On \\"Normal\\", Michael has control of the car. In an emergency, KITT could still take over and activate Auto Cruise mode. :* Auto Cruise ‚Äì In \\"Auto\\", KITT could drive himself utilizing an advanced Auto Collision Avoidance system. :* Pursuit ‚Äì \\"Pursuit\\" is used during high-speed driving and is a combination of manual and computer assisted operation. KITT could respond to road conditions faster than Michael's reflexes could; however, Michael was technically in control of the vehicle and KITT helped guide certain maneuvers. :* Super pursuit ‚Äì KITT's Super-Pursuit mode was added at the start of the fourth season. It was the result of a redesign of the car to integrate new concepts consisting of improved rocket boosters for enhanced acceleration, retractable spoilers for aerodynamic stability, and movable air inlets for increased cooling. Super- Pursuit Mode provided a 40% boost in speed beyond the car's original top speed of 300 MPH. First used in Episode 70, \\"Knight of the Juggernaut, Part II\\". ;Silent Mode :KITT can run silently. The feature dampens his engine noise and allows him to sneak around. First used in Episode 37, \\"White-Line Warriors\\". ;Grappling Hook and Winch :KITT has a hidden winch and grappling hook system. Most often the hook is connected by a strong cable, but a metal arm has also been seen. The grappling hook is first used in Episode 6, \\"Not a Drop to Drink\\"; the winch is first used in Episode 13, \\"Forget Me Not\\". ;Oil Jets/Smoke Screen :KITT can spray an oil slick and a plume of smoke from under the rear bumper. First used in Episode 1, \\"Knight of the Phoenix\\". ;Induction coil : KITT has an induction coil he can produce from under his front bumper and that, being placed on a metal object, KITT can remotely induce electrical voltage or current in that object. This was used by Michael in \\"Knight of the Drones (Part I)\\" to electrify a fence in order to incapacitate and interrogate two thugs without seriously harming them. ;Flame Thrower : KITT has flame throwers mounted under his bumpers. First used in Episode 2, \\"Deadly Maneuvers\\". ;Tear Gas Launcher : KITT can dispense a cloud of tear gas along with his smoke screen. First used in Episode 13, \\"Hearts of Stone\\". ;Ultramagnesium Charges : KITT can launch magnesium flares, which can also be used to divert heat-seeking missiles fired at him. First used in Episode 26, \\"Merchants of Death\\". ;High Traction Drop Downs : When activated, the HTDD system hydraulically raises KITT's chassis for better traction when driving off-road. First used in Episode 39, \\"Speed Demons\\". ;Telephone Comlink : Michael could contact home base and communicate with Devon and others using KITT's video display. ;Microwave Jammer :KITT has an electronic jamming system that played havoc on electrical systems. This lets him take control of electronic machines, allowing things like cheating at slot machines, breaking electronic locks, fouling security cameras, and withdrawing money from ATMs. In Episode 26, \\"Merchants of Death\\", the Microwave Jammer's power has been increased 3 times its normal strength, strong enough to bring down a helicopter at a limited distance. ;Microlock :KITT can lock the brakes of other vehicles. This system is believed to work by utilizing focused microwaves to heat the brake fluid, causing it to expand and apply the brakes of the car. ;Surveillance Mode :Surveillance Mode did several things: :* KITT could detect people and vehicles and track their movements and discern proximity. :* KITT could gather structural schematics of buildings, vehicles, or other devices and help Michael avoid potential danger when he was snooping. :* KITT could monitor radio transmissions and telephone communications within a location and trace those calls. :* KITT could tap into computer systems to monitor, or upload and download information as long as he could break the access codes. ;Traction Spikes : Added in Episode 86 \\"Hills of Fire\\". KITT's tires produce spikes that allow KITT to overcome steep terrain. ;Infrared Tracking Scope : KITT could monitor the position of specific vehicles in the area within 10 miles. ;Resonating Laser :KITT can fire a high powered ultra- frequency modulated laser, capable of burning through steel plating. First used in Episode 9, \\"Trust Doesn't Rust\\" and was used to try and destroy KARR by hitting KARR's only weak spot. Until the laser was calibrated, KITT could not fire it himself and it could only be fired by KITT's technician Bonnie. Also as pointed out in \\"Trust Doesn't Rust\\", if at that time, it was fired more than twice, it would drain KITT's batteries. ;Bomb Sniffer :KITT is equipped with a bomb sniffer module that can detect explosives within a few yards of the vehicle. First used in Episode 25, \\"Brother's Keeper\\". ;Medical scanner :KITT has a medical scanner that includes an electrocardiograph (ECG). The medical scanner can monitor the vital signs of individuals and display them on his monitors. It could indicate such conditions as if they were injured, poisoned, undergoing stress or other emotional behavior. First used in Episode 1, \\"Knight of the Phoenix (Pt. 2)\\". ;Tintable Windows: KITT can tint the windshield and windows to become opaque. First seen in Episode 14, \\"Give Me Liberty... or Give Me Death\\". ;Deflatable Tires : KITT could deflate and re-inflate his tires. First used in Episode 5 (first episode was actually 2 episodes), \\"Slammin' Sammy's Stunt Show Spectacular\\". ;Fuel Processor :KITT was powered by a turbine engine primarily fueled by hydrogen gas. However, his complex fuel processor allows him to run on any combustible liquid, even regular gasoline. In one episode, KITT mentioned his fuel economy was at least 65 miles per gallon. However, when operating on fuels other than liquid hydrogen, KITT's fuel efficiency and power output may be lowered. ;Voice Stress Analyzer : KITT can process spoken voices and determine if someone may be lying. First used in Episode 26, \\"Merchants of Death\\". ;Seat Ejection System :KITT had two front ejection seats, mostly used when Michael needed a boost to fire escapes or rooftops. First used in Episode 1, \\"Knight of the Phoenix (Pt. 1)\\". ;Passive Laser Restraint System : Added to KITT in later seasons, the restraint system helped protect Michael and any passengers from the shock of sudden impacts and hard stopping, especially after Super-Pursuit Mode. It is speculated that this is a primitive form of an inertial damping device. First used in Episode 47, \\"Knight of the Drones\\". ;Video Display Monitors :KITT has two CRT video display monitors on his dash for various readouts. They are controlled by two systems, the Graphic Translator (which sketches likenesses from verbal input) and the Anamorphic Equalizer (which gathered visual information from KITT's front scan bar) and microscanners. KITT only had one when his dash was redesigned for the show's third season. ;Computer Print Out : KITT could print hard copies of data on a dashboard- mounted printer. First used in Episode 15, \\"The Topaz Connection\\". ;Money Dispenser:KITT could give Michael money when he needed it. First used in Episode 59, ‚ÄúKnight by a Nose‚Äù. ;Ultraphonic Chemical Analyzer : KITT has a retractable tray with an electron scanner that could analyze the chemical properties of various materials. It could even scan fingerprints and read ballistic information off bullets and compare these with a police database. Aside from the scanning tray, the system could also analyze chemical information gathered from KITT's exterior sensors. First used in Episode 17, \\"Chariot of Gold\\". ;Interior Oxygenator :KITT could release oxygen into his driver compartment and provide air to passengers if he was ever submerged in water or buried in earth. This is also used to overcome the effects of certain drugs. First used in Episode 5, \\"Slammin' Sammy's Stunt Show Spectacular\\". ;Two-Wheel Ski Drive : The Ski Mode setting allowed KITT to \\"ski\\" (driving up on two wheels). First used in Episode 1, \\"Knight of the Phoenix\\". ;Third Stage Aquatic Synthesizer : With this system, KITT can hydroplane, effectively \\"driving\\" on water, using his wheels and turbo system for propulsion. First used in Episode 28, \\"Return to Cadiz\\", but later removed because it was faulty at the end of the episode. ;Emergency Braking System :The EBS slows KITT down from Super-Pursuit speeds. It consists of a forward braking booster and air panels that popped out to create air friction (air brakes). First used in Episode 70, \\"Knight of the Juggernaut, Part II\\". ;Convertible Roof :Added in the fourth season, by pressing the \\"C\\" button on KITT's dash, Michael could bring the top down and KITT became a convertible. First used in Episode #70, \\"Knight of the Juggernaut, Part II\\". An unknown number of these systems were designed at Stanford University (Episode 5, \\"Just My Bill\\"). KITT's total production cost was estimated at $11,400,000 in 1982 ($27,123,021.76 in 2013). The cost of subsequent equipment improvements and the installation of additional features since his activation have not been factored. =Other equipment= ;Comlink: KITT is in constant contact with Michael via a two-way communication wristwatch (a modified '80s LCD AM radio watch) Michael wore. The watch also had a micro camera and scanner that KITT could access to gather information. ;Homing Device: In an emergency, Michael can activate a secret homing beacon hidden inside a gold pendant he wears around his neck. The beacon sends a priority signal that can remotely activate KITT and override his programming so that he rushes to Michael's aid. Used in Episode 42, \\"A Good Knight's Work\\" and in \\"Knights of the Fast Lane\\". F.L.A.G. Mobile Command Center with Aerodynamic Sleeping Cab ;F.L.A.G. Mobile Command Center (The Semi) : KITT has access to a mobile \\"garage\\", which was a semi-trailer truck owned by the Foundation. In most episodes, it is a GMC General. The trailer has an extendable ramp that dropped down and allows KITT to drive inside even when the truck is in motion. The trailer was loaded with spare parts and equipment for KITT. It also had a computer lab where technicians Bonnie or April would work and conduct repairs and maintenance while in transit. In \\"Wrong Crowd\\" thieves hijack the truck thinking it to be hauling liquor. In the episode \\"Ten Wheel Trouble\\", following an assassination attempt on Michael which damages an independent truck, it is used to transport a shipment of onions. In the episode \\"Knight Moves\\", it is used as bait to catch a gang of truck hijackers. In \\"KITTnap\\", KITT is kidnapped and Michael and RC3 use the tractor (which has been disconnected from the trailer) to go and find him. =Notes= KITT's red scanner is similar to that of Cylons from the science fiction series Battlestar Galactica. Glen A. Larson, the creator of both Knight Rider and Battlestar Galactica has stated that the two shows have nothing else in common and to remove any fan speculation, he stated in the Season One Knight Rider DVD audio-comments, he simply reused the red scanning light for KITT because he liked the effect. * KITT was designed by customizer Michael Scheffe.The Knight Industries Two Thousand ‚Äì K.I.T.T.- Behind the Scanner carlustblog.com The convertible and super-pursuit KITTs were designed and built by George Barris. * A total of 23 KITT cars were made for use in filming the series. All except one of these cars survived until the show was axed; all except 5 of the remaining 22 cars were destroyed at the end of filming. Of the 5 that escaped that fate: 1 'hero' car was shipped to a theme park in Australia, but is now believed to be back in the US (whereabouts unknown); Universal kept one 'hero' car and one stunt car (and had a further replica made later) for use in the Entertainment Center display ‚Äì the two originals have since been sold to a private collector in the US; another, a convertible, disappeared for a while before being sold to the former Cars of the Stars Motor Museum in Keswick, Cumbria, England This convertible was sold to the Dezer Collection, Miami, Florida when Cars of the Stars closed. The fifth car is believed to be in private hands in the UK. * The right-hand drive KITT, known as the \\"Official Right Hand Drive KITT\\" as used in the video \\"Jump In My Car\\" by David Hasselhoff, is owned by a company called Wilderness Studios Australia. * Press releases regularly appear claiming 'original screen-used' cars are being sold. For example: on April 4, 2007, \\"one of the four KITT cars used in production of the television series\\" was reputedly being put up for sale for $149,995 by Johnny Verhoek of Kassabian Motors, Dublin, California. And a story in USA Today from December 2007 states that Slain real estate developer and car aficionado, Andrew Kissel, was in possession of one of the surviving cars. Some reports say that Michael Jackson bought an original KITT and former NSYNC band member Joey Fatone also claims to have purchased one of these authentic original KITTs at auction. There have been more 'original' cars auctioned than were built in total for the show. * The September 25, 2014 fifth episode of the Dutch TV programme Syndroom, featuring people with Down syndrome who wish to fulfill a dream, features Twan Vermeulen, a Knight Rider fan who wishes to meet David Hasselhoff and KITT. Together with the show's presenter they fly to L.A. and go searching for Hasselhoff's house. They \\"find\\" Hasselhoff on the driveway in front of his house, dusting off KITT. After KITT speaks a personal message to Twan, Hasselhoff offers to go with him to take KITT for a spin, \\"Freak out some people on the freeway\\", which they did with great pleasure for everyone involved.Guerrero, Danger (September 26, 2014). Watch David Hasselhoff \\"Take A ‚ÄòKnight Rider‚Äô Superfan With Down Syndrome For A Spin In KITT\\". Uproxx. =In other media= KITT accompanied Hasselhoff when he performed onstage, singing one of his songs at Disneyland in 1985, with various Disney characters behind him as his band. * KITT was reunited with Hasselhoff in a season 1 episode of the variety show/talent show America's Got Talent, on which Hasselhoff was a judge. * On MythBusters, Adam and Jamie tested whether KITT could in fact drive up the ramp into the mobile garage or whether upon hitting the ramp he would instantly accelerate into the truck and through the wall. * In the Supernatural episode \\"Changing Channels\\", the show's protagonists are constantly being transported to alternate dimensions based on parodies of popular TV series. One includes protagonist Dean Winchester riding a variation of his usual 1967 Chevy Impala that resembles KITT, with his brother Sam having been literally turned into the car, the episode featuring a scene with Dean driving the 'Sampala' with Knight Rider theme playing in the background. * KITT (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) appeared with Hasselhoff in a Comic-Con segment from the unrated version of the 2015 comedy Ted 2. * KITT appears in the video game Lego Dimensions as part of the Knight Rider Fun Pack, with William Daniels reprising his role. * In Herbie: Fully Loaded, KITT appears as part of a flashback which includes a newspaper headline reading \\"Herbie Meets Knight Rider\\" * KITT is referenced in the Futurama episode \\"The Honking\\", where it is revealed that his windscreen wipers were used as part of Project Satan, to create a car from components of the most evil cars in history (when characters observe that KITT wasn't evil, it is clarified that his windscreen wipers were evil but it never came up in the show). * In the SpongeBob SquarePants episode \\"Drive Happy\\", the self-driving boatmobile named Coupe is based on KITT, but behaves more like KARR. * In the Totally Spies! episode \\"Game Girls\\", a car named KIRTT (Klunky Incognito Radical Thought Transporter) has a sports mode form (a modified 1967 Ford Mustang). * In the Mickey and the Roadster Racers episode \\"Mouse vs. Machine\\", S.R.R. (Self-Racing Roadster), an A.I. roadster built by Professor Von Drake, is closely related to KITT. * In Ready Player One, the KITT AI and scanner is fitted in Parzival's Back to the Future DeLorean time machine. * In Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Nick Fury's SUV has a few functions that are similar to KITT's. * In Grand Theft Auto Online, a vehicle named Ruiner 2000 from Import/Export update is heavily inspired by KITT. * A computerized talking vehicle named CARR (the acronym's meaning is unknown) that appears in the television series Stroker and Hoop is a parody of KITT while the name is a parody of KARR, although he is not evil and depicted in a more comical role. * In the Teen Titans Go! episode \\"TV Knight 3\\", Cyborg appears as KITT, with his body in the shape of the car itself, while Beast Boy plays as Michael Knight. * In Teen Titans, the T-Car, which appears in some episodes throughout the series, has abilities that are the similar to KITT's, but does not include an A.I. (although it was once taken over by the villain Overload, which parodies to that of KARR). * In Lab Rats, the self-driving car that appears in the episode \\"Speed Trapped\\" has abilities that are almost the same as KITT's. * In the anime cartoon Transformers: Robots in Disguise, the Transformers that appear throughout the series demonstrate a few abilities that are the similar to KITT's. * In the anime cartoon Hayate the Combat Butler, CHITT (the acronym's meaning is unknown), who is entirely the same as KITT but has six wheels instead of four, appears in the episode \\"New Year's Food is Also Good, but Enjoy Hayate, Too\\" along with his driver who is also named Michael. * In the Inspector Gadget series, the Gadgetmobile that appears in the animated series has abilities that resemble KITT's. The live-action film series' version has an A.I. like KITT (which behaves more comical), which too had similar abilities. * As DLC for Planet Coaster, KITT can be found in pieces or as a whole car along with KARR. He also exists in Super Pursuit mode. * In the 3D simulation ride Race Through New York Starring Jimmy Fallon, Fallon's race car, the Tonight Rider, is a reference to KITT and the Knight Rider series itself. * In Phineas and Ferb, Katt Karr, a black car with the features and characteristics of a cat that appears in the episode \\"Ferb TV\\", is a parody of KITT, with the name being a reference to both KITT and KARR. Unlike KITT or KARR, Katt Karr's A.I. meows like a cat and does not speak at all or have a voice. * In The Simpsons, Knightboat, a black motorboat that has the same characteristics as KITT, appears in the episode \\"And Maggie Makes Three\\" in a TV show (which is based on Knight Rider) that Homer, Marge, and Lisa are watching. * KITT appears as a playable vehicle for the DLC of Rocket League. * In Spies in Disguise, Lance Sterling's car shares a few functions with KITT. * In Kim Possible, SADI (Systemized Automotive Driving Intelligence) is a red SUV that appears in the episode \\"Car Trouble.\\" SADI has capabilities similar to KITT, such as having ejection seats and the ability to talk and drive itself, but has a female voice. * In Archie's Weird Mysteries a female red classic two-door convertible by the name of Betsy appears in the episode \\"Driven to Distraction\\". Its artificial intelligence has a female voice and a mind of its own, and it fully self-drives just like KITT and KARR from Knight Rider, but it is also based on Christine from the Stephen King Christine franchise and The Car from The Car Film but is evil like KARR rather than kind and gentle like KITT. Various toy versions of KITT have been released. Among the best-known Knight Rider memorabilia is the remote controlled KITT, the Knight Rider lunch box, and the deluxe version of KITT. The deluxe model of KITT, sold by Kenner Toys and dubbed the \\"Knight 2000 Voice Car\\", spoke electronically (actual voice of William Daniels), featured a detailed interior and a Michael Knight action figure. ERTL released die-cast toys of KITT in three different sizes‚Äîthe common miniature sized model, a 'medium' sized model, and a large sized model. These toys featured red reflective holograms on the nose to represent the scanner. Also in late 2004, 1/18 scale die-cast models of KITT and KARR were produced from ERTL complete with detailed interior and light up moving scanner just like in the series. In September 2006, Hitari, a UK based company that produces remote control toy cars, released the Knight Rider KITT remote control car in 1/15 scale complete with the working red scanner lights, KITT's voice from the TV show and the car's turbine engine sound with the \\"cylon\\" scanner sound effect. In December 2012, Diamond Select Toys released a talking electronic 1/15 scale KITT which features a light up dashboard, scanner, foglights and tail lights along with the original voice of KITT, William Daniels, all at a push of a button. A more serious-minded joint venture was the Knight Rider GPS. Featuring the iconic voice of William Daniels, the item was a fully working GPS using Mio navigational technology. The GPS featured custom recorded voices so that the unit could \\"speak to\\" its owner using their own name if it was one of the ones in the recorded set of names. Knight Industries Three Thousand (KITT) The 2008 update to Knight Rider includes a new KITT ‚Äì the acronym now standing for Knight Industries Three Thousand. The KITT platform is patterned on a Shelby GT500KR and substantially differs from the original Two Thousand unit in several ways. For example, the 2008 KITT utilizes nano-technology, allowing the car's outer shell to change colors and morph itself into similar forms temporarily. The nanotech platform is written as needing the AI active in order to produce any of these effects, unlike the original car's indestructible gadgets and \\"molecular bonded shell\\" which allowed it to endure extreme impacts. These extreme down-sides to the use of nanotech have been demonstrated when villains like KITT's evil artificially intelligent talking vehicle clone KARR are able to cause significant damage, such as shooting out windows, shooting at the car when the AI is deactivated or not feeling well. It can also turn into two different types of a Ford F-150 4x4 truck (one completely stock and the other with some modifications), a Ford E-150 van, a Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor, a special edition Warriors In Pink Mustang (in support of breast cancer awareness month), and a Ford Flex for disguise or to use the alternate modes' capabilities (such as off-road handling). The car can engage an \\"Attack Mode\\", featuring scissor/conventional hybrid doors, which allows it to increase speed and use most of its gadgets (including turbo boost). It had a different looking attack mode in the pilot which was used whenever the car needed to increase speed. Its downside however is that it only seats two. KITT is also capable of functioning submerged, maintaining life support and system integrity while underwater. While the original series stated the original KITT was designed by the late Wilton Knight, the 2008 TV movie implies Charles Graiman may have also co-designed the car and the talking AI for Wilton Knight, was subsequently relocated to protect him and his family, and later designed the Knight Industries Three Thousand. KITT's weapons include a grappling hook located in the front bumper, usable in normal and attack modes, and missile launchers usable only in attack mode, which were first used in \\"Knight of the Hunter\\". In the Halloween episode \\"Knight of the Living Dead\\", KITT demonstrates the ability to cosmetically alter his appearance, becoming a black Mustang convertible with a pink trim as a Halloween costume. This configuration had the scanner bar relocated to behind the grille. Dr. Graiman also reveals in this episode that a backup neural network exists when he suggests downloading KITT's files and reuploading them to the backup, to which replies \\"The Backup is not me.\\" In the pilot, KITT had shown himself capable of similarly altering his external appearance‚Äîchanging his color and licence plate. In \\"Knight of the Zodiac\\", KITT uses a dispenser located in his undercarriage to spread black ice, and a fingerprint generator in the glovebox to overlay the fingerprints of a captured thief over Mike's. =Features= ;Backup Mainframe Processor: If the Knight Industries Three Thousand detects a fault or damage with his microprocessor, he carries a backup which can be mounted in the field automatically. ;Windshield Projection: Used in place of the centre console screen in the pilot. The entire front windshield is able to display information as well as the video communication link with the SSC. ;Bio Matrix Scanner: Used to detect the health status of people nearby. ;Nanotech Skin: This replaces the Molecular Bonded Shell from the original series. Unlike KITT's former incarnation of an impregnable outer shell of the vehicle with a nearly indestructible polymer, Knight Industries Three Thousand are a series of nano-machines that create the car's outer shell (a 2008 Ford Mustang GT500KR) and a second \\"skin\\" in whereupon detection of any damage will instantly repair the affected area. When Knight Industries Three Thousand is deactivated, the nano repair system is also disabled, making his basic nano- tech shell susceptible to physical damage. The second \\"skin\\" can affect KITT's outer shell as well, allowing KITT to disguise himself by transforming into various similar sized machinery. ;Turbo Boost: A power injector system that provides large bursts of power to allow KITT to jump over obstacles. This ability along with directional exhaust outlets allows KITT to jump from a standstill or at high speed. ;Hood Surface Screen: Similar to the projection windshield, this allows KITT to display data on exterior hood for outside briefings or with other parties. ;Offensive missiles: (Used in conjunction with attack mode): two tube-launched missiles that retract from each door. ;Gatling guns: (Again, used in conjunction with attack mode): two gatling- style guns that are retracted from the hood. Seen in season 1 episode 15, \\"Fly By Knight\\". In episode 16, \\"Knight and the City\\", KITT deploys a single machine gun while in regular mode. In this episode, KITT also indicates that he would run out of ammunition in 7 seconds and that he would expend 8,000 rounds in that timespan, which means that KITT's gatling guns have an approximate rate of fire of 1,143 rounds per second, over ten times higher than that of a regular minigun. ;Laser: A directed energy device capable of destroying locks and other items, projected from scanner bar. ;EMP: An electromagnetic pulse projector, which allows disabling of any electronic circuit or device within the given area. First seen in Episode 8, \\"Knight of the Zodiac\\". ;Anti-Missile Flares: Deployed from rear bumper. Disk-like objects that when dispensed produce an intense heat source to deter heat- seeking projectiles. ;Anti-Traction Compound Dispenser: (Known as Black Ice): An exterior dispenser that can eject a liquid, making the targeted surface tractionless. ;Interior tear gas dispenser: Used for anti-theft and defensive purposes. KITT can fill the car's cabin with tear gas to incapacitate a would- be thief as seen in Episode 7, \\"I Wanna Rock & Roll All Knight\\". ;Ski Mode: With help of the Turbo boost left power injector system to gain impulse for make KITT drivable on two wheels. First seen in episode 12 \\"Knight to King's Pawn\\". ;3D Object Printer: A device that allows for the creation of small 3-D objects (such as keys) based on available electronic data. ;Printer: Standard printer used for documents and incoming faxes. Located in the passenger side dash. ;Fingerprint Overlay Printer: A device accessible via the glove box that allows KITT to scan fingerprints from an inserted object and overlay then onto another person's hand. ;Weapons Cache: Small arms cache accessible via the glove box area that usually contains two 9mm handguns with extra magazines for occupant's protection outside KITT. ;First Aid: Accessible via glove box. Allows for field mending of physical wounds such as lost appendages. ;Self- Destruct: A software program secretly built into KITT that, when activated by the SSC, turns KITT into a bomb using his fuel as the charge and his computer as the detonator. ;Earwig: Small ear piece used to communicate with KITT at a limited distance. =Transformation abilities= ;Attack Mode: KITT's original Attack mode was purely used to increase speeds. It was changed after the pilot. ;Attack Mode II: Similar to the original KITT's alternate configuration to allow faster traveling speeds. First seen in Episode 1, \\"A Knight in Shining Armor\\". ;Ford F-150 FX4: Alternate mode for off-road travel. Also has ability to allow quick ingress at speed. Scanner bar is located in the grill at the very top of the inlet. First seen in Episode 1, \\"A Knight in Shining Armor\\". ;Ford F-150 II: After \\"Knight of the Hunter\\", an alternate F-150 mode, which has extra off-road modifications. ;Ford E-150 Cargo Van: For disguise purposes. All doors are fully functional. Scanner bar is not shown. As seen in Episode 4, \\"A Hard Day's Knight\\". ;Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor: For disguise purposes, used to elude police. KITT's presence indicator (Orb) is displayed on the MDT screen rather than a separate entity on the dash. In this configuration, KITT's scanner bar is hidden behind the top of the frame around the front grille. As seen in Episode 4, \\"A Hard Day's Knight\\". ;Ford Mustang GT: As seen on the pilot film. KITT converted into a silver Mustang en route to Las Vegas. He also transformed into a purple Mustang to help Michael and Sarah in their escape in Vegas. ;Ford Mustang Convertible: (Warriors in Pink Edition): A disguise that was used for the Halloween episode \\"Knight of the Living Dead\\", Episode 6. Basically a standard Mustang convertible with pink trim and aftermarket wheels, and the breast cancer logo under the mustang symbols. The scanner bar is located behind the front grille. ;Ford Flex: For disguise purposes. A customized version with metallic gray paint and taillight blackouts; the scanner bar is located in the lower bumper intake grille. In this configuration, access to some systems, such as his laser and EMP, are available. As seen in Episode 8, \\"Knight of the Zodiac\\". ;1969 Ford Mustang Mach 1: For disguise purposes. A dark blue classic with the scanner located in the grille. As seen in the episode \\"Fly By Knight\\" when a DEA agent had an all-points bulletin on Mike and KITT. (\\"Shall we go old school?\\") =KARR redesign= :See KARR (Knight Rider) KARR (first voiced by Peter Cullen, later voiced by Paul Frees) was the original evil clone prototype of the first KITT (Knight Industries Two Thousand) (voiced by William Daniels). but to mirror the pattern of the original series, the nemesis and prototype of the second KITT (Knight Industries Three Thousand)(voiced by Val Kilmer). is also designated as KARR in the new series. KARR is apparently a new evil twin clone character just like the Knight 3000, and the acronym now stands for Knight Auto-Cybernetic Roving Robotic-Exoskeleton. KARR's visual identity has also had similar changes for the new series. KARR was originally designed for military combat. KARR has the ability to transform from vehicle mode into a large wheeled robotic exoskeleton like a Transformer Decepticon from the Transformers live-action franchise instead of KITT's \\"Attack Mode\\". The vehicle mode of KARR is a 2008‚Äì2009 Shelby GT500KR with the automobile license plate initials K.R. KARR is once again voiced by Peter Cullen, who also voiced the debut appearance of KARR in \\"Trust Doesn't Rust\\". The transformation sequence is very similar to that in the 2007 Michael Bay Transformers live- action film as well as the second Michael Bay live-action film Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009) . Armed with twin machine guns on each shoulder and missiles, the exoskeleton combines with a human being for easier control. After a brief brawl, KITT uses the grappling hook to tear off KARR's chest plate, freeing one of Michael's co-workers, Alex Torres. Michael rams KITT through KARR's torso using Turbo Boost, apparently destroying KARR. It is unclear if KARR had the same nano repair function as KITT, nor if his evil A.I. unit actually survived. KARR is almost visually identical to KITT in this iteration of Knight Rider, unfortunately lacking the iconic distinctive black and silver two-tone paint job as well as the Amber/Yellow Scanner of the mid 1980s Pontiac Trans-Am version of K.A.R.R Knight Automated Roving Robot. The only true difference between KITT and KARR is only the scanner and voice box, which are once again all yellow compared to KITT's which are all red and as well as once again the true evil, speaking artificially intelligent voice. Knight Industries Four Thousand (K.I.F.T) (Knight 4000) A 1991 sequel movie, Knight Rider 2000, saw KITT's original microprocessor unit transferred into the body of the vehicle intended to be his successor, the Knight 4000 (referred to as \\"KIFT\\" by Knight Rider fans). The vehicle had numerous modern technological improvements over the 1980s Pontiac Trans-Am version of KITT Knight Industries Two Thousand, such as an amphibious mode (which allows the car to ride on water like a speedboat), a virtual reality heads-up display (or VR-HUD, which utilized the entire windshield as a video display), and a microwave stun device that could remotely incapacitate a human target. However, no acknowledgement is ever made to this Knight Rider spin-off in the unfortunately failed 2008‚Äì2009 Knight Rider series revival. =Features= The Knight 4000 has most of KITT's original features, including a few new and improved systems. ;Virtual Reality Heads-up Display : Rather than old- fashioned dash-mounted CRT displays, the Knight 4000 uses a highly modern virtual reality heads-up display employing the entire windshield as video monitor. ;Thermal Expander : The Knight 4000 was equipped with an offensive weapon which consisted of a microwave projector that caused the temperatures of targeted objects to quickly rise and either ignite or explode. ;Remote Target Assist : This allows the pilot to aim and fire with a complete and perfect accuracy via the Knight 4000's help. ;Amphibious Mode : The Knight 4000 can float and maneuver on water much like a boat. The system was actually a major improvement over KITT's original hydroplane ability which during the original series was prone to malfunctions during its experimental phase. ;Microwave Stunner : Similar to the ‚Äúnon-lethal‚Äù sidearms used by the police, the Knight 4000 was equipped with a microwave stunner that could incapacitate criminals. ;Voice-Activated Controls : The Knight 4000's dashboard is less \\"cluttered looking\\" than KITT's original dash with most of the controls now being completely voice activated rather than having to push a button. ;Fax Machine : The Knight 4000 could print out faxed messages from a dash-mounted printer. ;Infrared Scanner : The Infrared Scanner was a device with which the Knight 4000 could scan on an Infrared level, which would identify laser scope rifles as well as hidden objects giving off heat. ;Aroma Monitor : This system is similar to the Knight 2000's Olfactory Scan, but is much more complex. ;Voice Sampler : Similar to the Knight 2000's Anharmonic Synthesizer, this device could simulate any voice which has been recorded into the Knight 4000's memory. ;Thermal Sensor : This system allows the Knight 4000 to watch and record what is happening in a particular place, such as inside a vehicle.

In 1956 he moved to London to work as a journalist on The Daily Telegraph. He was the crime books reviewer for The Times for 15 years. He was chairman of the Crime Writers' Association (CWA) (1970‚Äì71), chairman of the Society of Authors (1983‚Äì84) and president of the Detection Club (1985‚Äì2000). He was a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He received the George N. Dove Award in 1995. In 1996 the CWA awarded him the Cartier Diamond Dagger for outstanding services to crime literature. He also wrote screenplays, was a reviewer and wrote a biography of Dame Agatha Christie entitled Agatha Christie: First Lady of Crime. He died on 27 March 2011, aged 84. Last years On his 80th birthday in 2006, members of the Detection Club honoured him with an anthology, Verdict of Us All, published by Crippen & Landru. He lived in London with his wife, the actress Sheila Mitchell until his death in 2011, aged 84. Works =Early novels= Keating's first four novels were published by Gollancz. With his fifth novel, Death of a Fat God (1963), he moved to Collins Crime Club, with whom he stayed for the next twenty years. =Inspector Ghote= Inspector Ganesh Ghote is an inspector in the Bombay (Mumbai) Police who appeared in twenty-six novels. The first was The Perfect Murder (1964), which won a Crime Writers' Association Gold Dagger Award and was nominated for an Edgar Award. It was later made into a film by Merchant Ivory. Keating intended Ghote's final appearance to be in the novel Breaking and Entering (2000), but brought the character back in Inspector Ghote's First Case (2008). Keating did not visit India until ten years after he started writing about it.Who's who in Steamy East and related fiction (Google cached version, 30 June 2006) - which references Meera Tamaya's H.R.F. Keating: Post-Colonial Detection (A Critical Study); Bowling Green, Ohio: Bowling Green State University Popular Press, 1993: \\"Keating wrote the first nine Ghote stories before his first visit to the country‚Äîand having been there he found it more difficult to write\\" (p. 23). =Evelyn Hervey= In the mid-1980s Keating published three novels with Weidenfeld under the pseudonym Evelyn Hervey. =DCI Harriet Martens= Harriet Martens is a detective chief inspector who earns the nickname \\"The Hard Detective\\" because of the tough image that she adopts to survive in the masculine world of UK policing. This toughness inspired her to start a \\"Stop the Rot\\" campaign that successfully reduced local crime but angered some violent criminals to the extent that they start murdering her officers. In the second book she falls in love with a fellow officer while investigating the murder of the UK's top tennis player. With her job under threat she fights to prove her worth in the third book. =Other novels= In 1978 Keating published A Long Walk to Wimbledon, a science-fiction novel about a man trekking across a ruined London to save his estranged wife. In the 1990s Keating wrote several novels about UK police detectives whose human weaknesses adversely affect their work. The first of these was The Rich Detective (1993) in which Detective Inspector Bill Sylvester of South Mercia Police investigates an anonymous allegation that a local antiques dealer is murdering old ladies after persuading them to change their wills in his favour. In The Bad Detective (1996) Detective Sergeant Jack Stallworthy is a corrupt police officer who is planning his retirement to Devon when a businessman offers him ownership of a hotel on a tropical island in return for stealing an incriminating file from the Fraud Investigations Office at police headquarters. In September 1999 Flambard Press published his verse novel Jack, the Lady Killer. =Non-fiction= His guide to Writing Crime Fiction (1986) was based on his analysis of the development of the genre from the 1920s to the 1990s. It includes guidance on fictional structure, the plot and its characters, and on submitting a script to publishers.

The Red Jews wait at the banks of the river Sambation. According to rabbinic literature, the Sambation () is the river beyond which the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel were exiled by the Assyrian king Shalmaneser V (Sanchairev). Location In the earliest references, such as the Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, the river is given no particular attributes, but later literature claims that it rages with rapids and throws up stones six days a week, or even consists entirely of stone, sand and flame. For those six days the Sambation is impossible to cross, but it stops flowing every Shabbat, the day Jews are not allowed to travel; some writers say this is the origin of the name. Pliny the Elder, writing in the mid-1st century, mentions that there is a river in Judaea that dries up every Shabbat (NH xxxi.18). His younger contemporary Josephus writes of the Sabbatical River (Œ£Œ±Œ≤Œ≤Œ±œÑŒπŒ∫ŒøŒΩ) that he claims was called after \\"the sacred seventh day of the Jews\\" and that he locates between Arka (in the northern Lebanon range) and Raphanaea (in Upper Syria) (War 7.96-99), although according to his account it is dry for six days and flows only on Shabbat. The river is believed by some to be an intermittent spring now called Fuwar ed-Deir. The Sambation was also a popular subject in medieval literature, for instance, some versions of the Alexander Romance have Alexander the Great encounter the river on his travels. Others have said it is an active volcano (which explains the rapids, stones, fire and smoke) which rests on the Sabbath. In 1280, Abraham Abulafia (1240 - c. 1291), a mystic and Kabbalist, set out to find the Sambation. Nahmanides identifies the Sambation with the Guzana River mentioned in II Kings, located in Syria.Pathway to Jerusalem, CIS, 1992. pg. 68. An Ashkenazi Jewish tradition speaks of the Lost Tribes as Die Roite Yiddelech, \\"The little red Jews\\", cut off from the rest of Jewry by the legendary river Sambation \\"whose foaming waters raise high up into the sky a wall of fire and smoke that is impossible to pass through\\".Moses Rosen. \\"The Recipe\\" (published as epilogue to The Face of Survival, 1987). Obadiah ben Abraham writes that he was informed by Adeni Jews in Jerusalem that they had heard from Muslim merchants that the river was located about fifty-days' walking distance from their place as one journeys through the desert.Avraham Yari, Igros Eretz Yisroel (Letters of the Land of Israel), in the \\"Letter of Rabbi Obadiah di Bertinora from Jerusalem to his Brother,\\" written in 1489, Tel-Aviv 1943, p. 140 (in PDF) [Hebrew]. The river, which flows with rocks for six days a week, completely surrounded a land inhabited by Jews who could not ever leave, for by doing so, Shabbat would be desecrated. These Jews were all the offspring of Moses and were as holy as angels and sinless. In modern literature, the Sambation appears prominently in Umberto Eco's novel Baudolino, whose protagonists manage to cross the raging river of stones and find on the other side, not the Lost Ten Tribes, but the Kingdom of Prester John of Christian myth.

Typically, the term is used for piston engine airliners that flew before the large scale advent of airliners of the jet age. Large four engine turboprop airliners like the Lockheed L-188 Electra, Vickers Viscount and Tupolev Tu-114, could be Technically considered as propliners, but as of 2020 this type was not generally accepted in the parlance of propliner enthusiasts. With the notable exception of the de Havilland Albatross and Fokker F-10 of the late 1920s to 1930s, which were largely fabricated of wood, propliners generally featured all-metal wings and structural members, totally or partially retractable landing gear, and two, three, or four engines. A few might deviate from these characteristics with fixed landing gear, such as the Albatross, Fokker 110, and Lockheed Vega. The first all metal passenger service propliner was the Handley Page Type W in the 1920s. Then the Boeing 247 made its first flight in 1933, with the Douglas DC-1 and Douglas DC-2 closely following in response. The most successful is the Douglas DC-3, which was produced in the thousands, and is still in widespread use; while the Dewoitine D.338 and SNCASE SE.161 Languedoc were developed in France and Germany produced the Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor and Junkers Ju 90. In Japan a license-built version of the Douglas DC-3 was developed as the Nakajima L2D and the smaller Mitsubishi MC-20 was locally developed. In the Netherlands Fokker, previously one of the leading manufacturers of airliners before the Boeing 247 appeared, became the European sales agent for Douglas DC-2s and DC-3s. Most British-built aircraft of the period were less advanced, such as the Avro 642 Eighteen and de Havilland Express; one exception was the Armstrong Whitworth Ensign. Other American- designed propliners included the Douglas DC-4, Douglas DC-5 and Martin 2-0-2. None of these models featured cabin pressurization. With the earlier introduction of the Boeing 307 Stratoliner and the experimental Douglas DC-4E, a second generation of propliners emerged. These technologically more modern aircraft featured cabin pressurization systems allowing greater comfort by allowing aircraft to fly higher and above much of the lower altitude weather, although it was not until the Lockheed Constellation, followed by the Douglas DC-6 and Douglas DC-7, that this design advance became common. By the 1950s the traveling public were increasingly finding themselves being transported upon long range pressurized propliners such as the Boeing 377 Stratocruiser, Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation and Lockheed L-1649 Starliner, or shorter ranged twin engined Martin 4-0-4 and Convair CV-240, CV-340 and CV-440 aircraft. British propliners included the Airspeed Ambassador, Vickers Viking and Handley Page Hermes, while the Canadair North Star (a development of the Douglas DC-4) was produced in Canada. The Breguet Deux-Ponts and Hurel-Dubois HD.31 were manufactured in France; and the Soviet Union produced the postwar twin-engined Ilyushin Il-12 and Ilyushin Il-14, both produced in quantity through the 1950s. Finally, the Swedish SAAB Scandia was produced in small numbers. See alsoDe Havilland Canada Dash 8 *Fokker 50 *Tupolev Tu-114 External linksDescriptions and photos of U.S-built propliners.

Definition The noun \\"inundation\\" refers to both the act of inundating; an overflow; a flood; a rising and spreading of water over grounds; and to the state of being inundated; flooding. It should therefore be distinguished from other types of flooding, not caused by man. It should also be recognised that this type of flooding would not take place without the intentional human act. So e.g. tidal flooding of areas that fall dry at ebb tide, and periodical river floods are not inundations in the sense intended here. The latter condition implies that in most topographies the act usually applies to causing an overflow of a river or stream by damming it. This is also the only method foreseen in the 1888 British military textbook that discusses the technique correctly under \\"military obstacles\\".Text book, p. 50 However, in areas that have been reclaimed from the sea, marches or lakes, and are artificially protected from the waters (either accumulated precipitation, or the water source that would flood the reclaimed area, if it were not artificially protected), as in e.g. the artificial hydrological entities, known as Polders, may be inundated by simply giving the water source access again. In the latter perspective inundation may simply be a form of hydraulic engineering. Before we limit the concept to military uses, it should be recognised that there are at least two other possible uses of inundation as a human act: *agricultural uses, as in preparing paddy fields for the growing of semi-aquatic rice in many countries; *river management, in the form of diverting flood waters in a river at flood stage upstream from areas that are considered more valuable than the areas that are sacrificed in this way (what one may call \\"prophylactic hydraulic engineering\\").This may be done ad hoc as in the 2011 intentional breach of levees by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in Missouri or permanently, as in the so-called (literally:\\"let-overs\\"), an intentionally lowered segment in Dutch riparian levees, like the Beerse Overlaat in the left levee of the Meuse between the villages of Gassel and Linden, North Brabant. Military inundation Example of an inundation sluice in the Hollandic Water Line near Utrecht for controlled inundation Military inundation creates an obstacle in the field that is intended to impede the movement of the enemy. This may be done both for offensive and defensive purposes. Furthermore, in so far as the methods used are a form of hydraulic engineering, it may be useful to differentiate between controlled inundations (as in most historic inundations in the Netherlands under the Dutch Republic and its successor states in that areaOosthoek; Tiegs, Brief history and exemplified in the two Hollandic Water Lines, the Stelling van Amsterdam, the Frisian Water Line, the IJssel Line, the Peel-Raam Line, and the Grebbe line in that country) and uncontrolled ones (as in the second Siege of LeidenTiegs, Past during the first part of the Eighty Years' War, and the Inundation of Walcheren, and the Inundation of the Wieringermeer during the Second World War). To count as controlled, a military inundation has to take the interests of the civilian population into account, by allowing them a timely evacuation, by making the inundation reversible, and by making an attempt to minimize the adverse ecological impact of the inundation.Ironically, one may consider controlled military inundation a form of flood control; Cf. Flood control in the Netherlands#Flooding as military defense. As Vandenbohed discusses,Vandenbohed, Hydrogeology that impact may also be adverse in a hydrogeological sense if the inundation lasts a long time.The 1977 Protocol I, amending the Geneva Conventions, may in art. 53 and 56 outlaw uncontrolled inundations. From a legal point of view, a military inundation should therefore be seen as a government \\"taking\\" of private property under the constitutional protection of private property in many countries. In the Netherlands, this was the subject of art. 152 of the Dutch constitution of 1887.

Eastern Beach is a popular swimming and recreation area in Geelong, Victoria on the shores of Corio Bay. Built during the 1930s in the Art Deco style, a shark proof sea bath is provided, as well as a children's swimming pool, kiosk, and dressing room pavilion. A number of Art Deco buildings in the area are listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. Beginnings It was not always the beach it is today. In the early years that area of Geelong was considered an eyesore, with steep cliffs running from the northern town boundary to the shores of Corio Bay. Redevelopment plans were first proposed in 1914 by the City of Geelong. Work was to include a sea wall from Yarra Street to Limeburners Point, land reclamation, and the flattening of the cliffs along the beach. Further plans were drawn up for a chalet at the beach, which later appeared in the form of the kiosk building. Work began in September 1927 when contracts were let for construction of the concrete stairway, terraces and dressing sheds. J.C. Taylor and Sons were the successful contractor. That stage of the works was opened on December 20, 1929 by the Mayor of Geelong Cr Sol Jacobs. The shark- proof swimming enclosure and children's pool were opened by Cr Jacobs on March 28, 1939. The enclosure covered and could accommodate 10,000 bathers. The precinct development cost ¬£40,000 ($80,000), but was seen by the council of the time as being an investment in the city. To cater to beach goers, a tramway extension along Corio Terrace (later Brougham Street) as far as Bellerine Street opened in October 1940. The line was closed in 1956 along with the rest of Geelong's tramways. Later years Kiosk building Lifesavers pavilion and change rooms Boardwalk and swimming enclosure The area began a slow decline from the 1960s, with its popularity diminishing as a result of increased motor car ownership, which gave Geelong residents easier access to ocean beaches. Later decades of neglect saw the area fall into disrepair. The decline was arrested in 1993, when the City of Greater Geelong announced plans for the restoration of the area. Partial funding of the works came from people being given the opportunity to purchase a plank on the boardwalk around he swimming enclosure. The boardwalk and enclosure were rebuilt, and the children's swimming pool, kiosk and change rooms were renovated. The Beach House restaurant was also opened on the upper level of the kiosk building. The late 1990s saw the original diving tower reinstated at the bay side of the swimming enclosure, after an absence of many years. However, the rebuilt structure was altered from the original design, with access to the topmost level being barred due to injury concerns. The improvements were the first stage of the Waterfront Geelong developments along the Corio Bay foreshore. Eastern Beach is the venue of festivals and concerts, as well as the annual Geelong Carols by the Bay concert hosted by Denis Walter.

Unlike other scientific literature, such as scientific journals and the proceedings of some academic conferences, technical reports rarely undergo comprehensive independent peer review before publication. They may be considered as grey literature. Where there is a review process, it is often limited to within the originating organization. Similarly, there are no formal publishing procedures for such reports, except where established locally. Description Technical reports are today a major source of scientific and technical information. They are prepared for internal or wider distribution by many organizations, most of which lack the extensive editing and printing facilities of commercial publishers. Technical reports are often prepared for sponsors of research projects. Another case where a technical report may be produced is when more information is produced for an academic paper than is acceptable or feasible to publish in a peer-reviewed publication; examples of this include in-depth experimental details, additional results, or the architecture of a computer model. Researchers may also publish work in early form as a technical report to establish novelty, without having to wait for the often long production schedules of academic journals. Technical reports are considered \\"non-archival\\" publications, and so are free to be published elsewhere in peer-reviewed venues with or without modification.  Production guidelines NISO has published guidelines on the Scientific and Technical Reports - Preparation, Presentation, and Preservation last updated in 2010.

He has been widely noted to be the most prominent ideologue of Hindutva. One of the early leaders for the RSS group. Golwalkar authored the books Bunch of Thoughts and We, or Our Nationhood Defined. Early life Golwalkar was born to Sadashivrao and Lakshmibai in a Marathi Karhade Brahmin family at Ramtek, near Nagpur in Maharashtra. His family was prosperous and supported him in his studies, activities. Sadashivrao, a former clerk in the Posts and Telegraphs Department, became a teacher in the Central Provinces and ended his career as headmaster of a high school. Golwalkar was the only surviving son of nine children. Since his father was frequently transferred around the country, he attended a number of schools. Golwalkar studied science and was apt and apolitical as a student. As an adolescent, he developed a deep interest in religion and spiritual meditation.Sharma, J., 2007. Terrifying Vision: MS Golwalkar, the RSS, and India. Penguin Books India. Golwalkar enrolled in Hislop College, a missionary-run educational institute in Nagpur. At the college, he was reportedly incensed at the \\"open advocacy\\" of Christianity and the disparagement of Hinduism; much of his concern for the defence of Hinduism is traceable to this experience. Golwalkar left Hislop College for Benaras Hindu University (BHU) in Varanasi, receiving a Bachelor of Science degree in 1927 and a master's degree in biology in 1929. He was influenced by Madan Mohan Malaviya, a nationalist leader and founder of the university.Sheshadri, H. V., Shri Guruji - Biography , golwalkarguruji.org. Golwalkar went to Madras to pursue a doctorate in marine biology, but could not complete it because of his father's retirement; he later taught zoology for three years at BHU. His students called him \\"Guruji\\" because of his beard, long hair and simple robe, a practice later continued in a reverential manner by his RSS followers. Golwalkar returned to Nagpur, and obtained a law degree by 1937. While he was lecturing at Benares Hindu University, Bhaiyaji Dani, a student and close associate of RSS Sarsanghchalak K. B. Hedgewar, founded an RSS shakha in Varanasi. Although Golwalkar attended meetings and was esteemed by its members, there is \\"no indication that Golwalkar took a keen interest\\" in the organisation. In 1931, Hedgewar visited Benares and was drawn to the ascetic Golwalkar. After returning to Nagpur, Hedgewar exerted greater influence on Golwalkar. According to RSS sources, Hedgewar encouraged him to pursue a law degree because it would give him the reputation required of an RSS leader. In 1934, Hedgewar made him secretary (karyavah) of the main Nagpur branch. After he began practising law, Hedgewar tasked him with the management of the Akola Officers' Training Camp. In October 1936, Golwalkar abandoned his law practice and RSS work for the Sargachi Ramakrishna Mission ashram in West Bengal to renounce the world and become a sanyasi. He became a disciple of Swami Akhandananda, who was a disciple of Ramakrishna and brother monk of Swami Vivekananda. On 13 January 1937 Golwalkar reportedly received his diksha, but left the ashram soon afterwards. He returned to Nagpur in a state of depression and indecision to seek Hedgewar's advice after his guru died in 1937, and Hedgewar convinced him that his obligation to society could best be fulfilled by working for the RSS. RSS leadership After Golwalkar rejoined the RSS, Hedgewar apparently began grooming him for leadership and he was placed in charge of the All-India Officers' Training Camp from 1937 to 1939. Golwalkar's abilities (managing complex details of the large camp, public speaking, reading and writing) were appreciated. In 1938, he was asked to translate G. D. Savarkar's 1934 Marathi language Rashtra Mimansa (Nationalism) into Hindi and English. The resulting book, We, or Our Nationhood Defined, was published in Golwalkar's name and regarded as a systematic treatment of RSS ideology; the fact that it was an abridged translation did not come to light until 1963. In 1939, at a Gurudakshina festival, Hedgewar announced that Golwalkar would be the next general secretary (sarkaryavah, the second-most- important position in the RSS). A day before he died on 21 June 1940, he gave Golwalkar a sheet of paper asking him to be the RSS leader. On 3 July, five state-level sanghchalak (directors) in Nagpur announced Hedgewar's decision. Golwalkar's choice was said to have stunned the RSS volunteers, since Hedgewar passed over several senior activists. Golwalkar's background, training, and interests made him an unlikely successor, and Balasaheb Deoras said that several RSS leaders were sceptical about Golwalkar's ability as a sarsanghchalak. In retrospect, Hedgewar's grooming (including encouragement to obtain a Law degree and the authorship of We, or Our Nationhood Defined, is seen as key to Golwalkar's later success. One reason advanced for his choice is that he was thought likely to maintain RSS independence, otherwise liable to be regarded as a youth front of the Hindu Mahasabha. RSS supreme leader for more than 30 years, Golwalkar made it one of strongest religious-political organisations in India; its membership expanded from 100,000 to over one million, and it branched out into the political, social, religious, educational and labour fields through 50 front organisations. The RSS extended to foreign countries, where Hindus were recruited into organisations such as the Bharatiya Swayamsevak Sangh or the Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh. There was a subtle, important shift in the RSS worldview. One of Golwalkar's major innovations was an anti-communist, anti-socialist ideology, with the slogan \\"Not socialism but Hinduism.\\" According to D. R. Goyal, the RSS' anti-Marxist tinge made it popular with the wealthy sections of society who generously supported it. The RSS expanded into Jammu and Kashmir in 1940, when Balraj Madhok was sent as a pracharak to Jammu with Prem Nath Dogra as director. A shakha was founded in Srinagar in 1944, and Golwalkar visited the city in 1946. On 18 October 1947 he is reported to have met Maharaja Hari Singh at the request of India's Home Minister Vallabhbhai Patel to persuade the Maharaja to accede to India. He was accompanied by the RSS Delhi pracharak Vasantrao Oak and the RSS United Provinces sanghchalak Narendrajit Singh. Although it is believed that the maharaja agreed to the proposal, the accession was not signed until 26 October after the invasion by Pakistan. =Reorientation= Golwalkar's religiosity and apparent disinterest in politics convinced some RSS members that the organisation was no longer relevant to the nationalist struggle. It remained aloof from the freedom movement, and connections with the Hindu Mahasabha were severed. The RSS membership in the Marathi-speaking districts of Bombay became disillusioned and the Bombay sanghchalak, K. B. Limaye, resigned. Several swayamsevaks defected and formed the Hindu Rashtra Dal in 1943, with an agenda of a paramilitary struggle against British rule; Nathuram Godse (Gandhi's assassin) was a leader of that group. However, Golwalkar moved quickly to consolidate his position. He created a network of prant pracharaks (provincial organisers), who would report to him rather than to the sanghchalaks. Golwalkar recruited local Congress leaders to preside over RSS functions, demonstrating the organisation's independence from the Hindu Mahasabha. The RSS continued to expand during the Second World War, especially in North India and present-day Pakistan. Many new members were religious, small-scale entrepreneurs interested in consolidating their caste positions with the RSS' Hindu symbols. Organisation policy during the war years was influenced by potential threats to Hinduism, with the RSS expected to be prepared to defend Hindu interests in the event of a Japanese invasion. It also expected a renewed Hindu-Muslim struggle after the war. Golwalkar did not want to give the British government an excuse to ban the RSS. He complied with all governmental instructions, disbanding the RSS military department and avoiding the Quit India movement. The British acknowledged that the organisation \\"scrupulously kept itself within the law, and refrained from taking part in the disturbances that broke out in August, 1942\\". In addition to pragmatism, Golwalkar appeared ideologically opposed to an anti-British struggle; the RSS pledged to defend India's freedom by defending religion and culture, and there was \\"no mention of the departure of the British\\". He called the conflation of anti-Britishism with patriotism and nationalism a \\"reactionary view\\", which would have \\"disastrous effects upon the entire course of the freedom struggle\\". Golwalkar acknowledged that his attitude confused people (including many swayamsevaks in the RSS), leading them to distrust the Sangh. =Ban and arrest= When Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated in January 1948 by Nathuram Godse, there was widespread apprehension (despite Golwalkar's condemnation of the murderers) that the RSS was involved. Golwalkar and 20,000 swayamsevaks were arrested on 4 February, and the RSS was banned for promoting \\"violence\\" and \\"subversion\\". Godse said that he acted on his own initiative, and no official connection between the RSS and Gandhi's assassination has ever been made. However, Nathuram Godse's brother Gopal Godse‚Äîalso accused in the assassination plot‚Äîsaid that Nathuram never left the RSS and his statement was designed to protect the RSS and Golwalkar (who were \\"in deep trouble\\" after the assassination). Golwalkar was released on 5 August, after the six-month statutory limit expired. The RSS ban continued, and Golwalkar tried to negotiate with Home Minister Vallabhbhai Patel about having it lifted. The mass arrests, violence against members and the ban by an independent Indian government of what was understood as a patriotic organisation was a shock to the RSS membership. Although Patel asked the RSS to join the Congress, Golwalkar disapproved. Patel then demanded, as a precondition, that the RSS adopt a written constitution. Golwalkar responded by beginning a satyagraha on 9 December 1948, and he and 60,000 RSS volunteers were arrested. RSS leaders Eknath Ranade, Bhaiyaji Dani and Balasaheb Deoras suspended the satyagraha in January 1949 and, in collaboration with liberal leader T. R. Venkatarama Sastri, wrote an RSS constitution of which Patel approved. The ban was lifted on 11 July 1949. The government of India issued a statement that the decision to lift the ban had been made in view of Golwalkar's promise of loyalty to the Constitution of India and acceptance of India's national flag explicitly in the RSS constitution. Organisations founded and supported by RSS volunteers became collectively known as Sangh Parivar.  Writings and Ideology  Golwalkar is known to have propagated Dharmic teachings. A book based on extracts of his writings, titled Guruji: Vision and Mission, includes a chapter titled ‚ÄúHindu‚Äîthe Son of this Motherland,‚Äù which claims that 'Bhartiya' includes only those who have followed faiths rooted in pluralism, and that Indic faith followers represent this in India, since it accepts all approaches towards spirituality. In another chapter titled ‚ÄúOur Identity and Nationality\\", he wrote that ‚ÄúAll the elements required to develop as a great nation are present in this Hindu society in their entirety. This is why we say that in this nation of Bharat, living principles of the Hindu society are the living systems of this nation. In short, this is ‚ÄòHindu Nation‚Äô.‚Äù . Some of Golwalkar's ideas have differed with those from the RSS. For example, in his book We or Our Nationhood Defined published in 1939, he compares the creation of a Hindu culture propagating the concept of acceptance of a shared Hindu heritage. According to Ramachandra Guha's book Makers of Modern India, Golwalkar has been known to see muslims, christians and communists as three principal threats to the formation of a Hindu nation. These two religions weren't born in India and the communists were atheists to boot. He saw them as akin to demons, or rakshahsas, and the Hindus destined to be the avenging angels who would slay them and restore goodness and purity of the Motherland. He demonized the west, even though he was influenced by Vivekananda, who had certain respect for the western civilization and believed in unity of all religions. Golwalker has been criticized for being a Hindu supremacist and having some similarities in ideas with those of the Nazis.

Briar is of unknown, multiracial parentage. He is described as having curly black hair and brown skin, typical to natives of Sotat, his birthland, but with a Western nose and light, gray-green eyes. Background Briar Moss was, in early life, a street rat called 'Roach'. In The Circle of Magic quartet, he is about 10; in The Circle Opens quartet, he's 14; and in The Will of the Empress, Briar is 18. His mother was killed when he was approximately four, and he was recruited by a gang, the Lightnings, led by the 'Thief-Lord', in Deadman's District in Hajra. He was caught three times, receiving a tattoo of an X on the webbing between each thumb and forefinger for the first two; on the third, he was sentenced to life at the docks. A great mage, Niklaren Goldeye, had a vision that he would find special mages‚Äîmages whose ambient powers were not easily discernible by the usual means‚Äîand as such was there, as he needed to be, during Briar's trial. He was able to detect the boy's psychic affinity with plants, and took him to Winding Circle Temple to be educated in plant magic. Although initially a thief, Briar developed a strong sense of right and wrong, which would serve as a weapon against criminals and seductresses. He is cantankerous but possesses a profound loyalty to his foster-sisters Daja Kisubo (whom he calls Daj'), Sandrilene (Sandry) fa Toren, and Trisana (usually called Tris for short, but Briar often calls her Coppercurls) Chandler and his teacher Rosethorn, as well as a cutting sense of humor. His affinity with all things botanical has made him not only a master gardener but has also led to such oddities as stealing and later coming to own an ancient, magic-storing, miniature pine tree called a shakkan, tattoos of flowers that live and grow under his skin (he attempted to tattoo over his prisoner X tattoos with vegetable dyes and one of Sandry's needles), and the ability to control growth of plants. During the Circle Opens, he is shown to be somewhat flirty, but in the Will of the Empress he becomes much more promiscuous. In the same book, he was suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder. Magic Briar has plant magic and his teacher is Dedicate Rosethorn, who is also a plant mage. Briar can make plants grow very quickly and move them to any form, like creating a snare from a vine. Rosethorn taught him how to make medicines and restore them to their full potential when they had expired. He also enjoys and makes money by caring for shakkans (similar to bonsai), trees kept small which usually store magic in the way the plant looks. He and Rosethorn developed special weapons to use in combat. They are seeds, namely of thorny plants, wrapped in cotton wool. Thrown, Rosethorn and Briar use their green magic to simultaneously cause the wool to unwrap and the seeds to grow. There are variations of the balls, some containing vines to wrap around people and others to do actual harm. When trying to tattoo over his \\"X\\" marks, Briar's green magic and Sandry's magical needles resulted in a subcutaneous garden; plants grow and shift beneath the skin on his hands, often reflecting his mood. This could be considered Briar's \\"unique ability\\" (as with Sandry's power to spin pure magic, Daja's living metal, and Tris's scrying ability and sheer versatility), though these plants have yet to show any practical magical properties. Orpheus In Briar's Book, a deadly epidemic threatens everyone in the city. His teacher, Rosethorn, catches \\"blue pox\\", as it is called, has a seizure and dies. Briar, with the help of Sandry, Daja, and Tris, goes to the afterlife to bring her back to life, almost dying himself. Student In Street Magic, Briar finds Evumeimei Dingzai (Evvy), a former slave, who has stone magic. Evvy refuses to go with the nearest stone mage (Jebilu Stoneslicer) and thus, Briar must become her teacher. Briar teaches her meditation and at the same time about rocks and what they are used for. Evvy calls Briar's plants 'stone killers' because their roots dig into rocks and destroy them over time. In Melting Stones she revises this attitude slightly, believing that rocks occasionally welcome the change wrought by plant roots. In The Will of the Empress one of his foster-sisters asked him if and who was the girl he cared for more than other girls to bring to their breakfast, and Briar answers, Evvy.

He was among the commanders of the Spanish Tercios fighting under the orders of Count Fernando de Andrade in the Battle of Pavia, and in other battles of the Italian Wars between 1513 and 1525. He was granted the right to display a coat of arms, and was granted land and property in Ferrolterra, his birthplace, for having participated in the capture, on the battlefield, of the king of France, Francis I. Decree awarding coat of arms The decree granting a coat of arms to Alonso Pita da Veiga was archived at the General Archive of Simancas (Archivo general de Simancas, legajo 388, rotulado de \\"Mercedes y Privilegios.\\") and was issued by Emperor Charles V on 24 July 1529, four years after the Battle of Pavia. A verbatim text of the decree can be found in, among other 19th century Spanish books, in the book Crisol historico espanol y restauracion de glorias nacionales, published in Havana, Cuba in 1862 by the Spanish historian Jos√© Ferrer de Couto. A summary of the document, in English translation, gives the following details: \\"Alonso Pita da Veiga, Galician, and our vassal\\" served his majesty well in several battles including the Battle of Bicencio and the Battle of Vicoca. In regards to the Battle of Pavia, the decree states that Alonso Pita da Veiga recaptured the standard \\" ... of His Most Serene Infante Don Fernando, who is now King of Hungary, Our most dear and loved son and brother, which bore the insignia of Our Duchy of Burgundy, which the French had taken when the standard-bearer was killed‚Äù. This refers to the standard of Ferdinand, the brother of Charles V, whose troops fought at Pavia. For this action, Alonso Pita da Veiga was awarded 600 gold ducats. In regards to the capture of King Francis I of France, the decree states \\"and in the same battle, you accomplished so much that you reached the person of said King (Francis I of France) and captured him, jointly with the other persons that captured him.‚Äù So, in effect, Charles V credited a group of individuals, and not a single individual, with the capture of King Francis I. For that action, Alonso Pita da Veiga was awarded the sum of 30,0000 maraved√≠s per year, for life, \\"above and beyond your pay as an hombre de arma\\". \\"Hombre de arma\\" was a term used in that era to signify a mounted warrior as opposed to a foot soldier. The decree states that Alonso Pita da Veiga took from Francis I of France the following: \\"and you took from him his left gauntlet and a brocade decorated with four crosses of silver cloth and a crucifix made of the True Cross, of which events the same King of France gave testimony in a document signed by his own hand.\\" The decree then awards Alonso Pita da Veiga a coat of arms, described in the decree, that incorporates the different elements of his deeds at the Battle of Pavia: ‚ÄúA coat of arms, quartered, the first quarter colored the color of blood and in it a gauntlet as a symbol that you took said King of France, and a royal Crown of gold above of said gauntlet; and in the lower quarter, a blue field with three gold fleur-de-lis which are the true arms of the Kings of France; and in the right quarter with the field colored as the superior quarter and in it the brocade decorated with its crosses; and the left quarter, likewise colored, and in it the said standard of the Most Serene King of Hungary with the arms of Our Duchy of Burgundy.‚Äù See also Habsburg Spain First Habsburg of Spain i.e.: Charles I of Spain who was also Emperor Charles V References External links Genealogy of Captain Alonso Pita da Veiga, Xenealog√≠as do Ortegal, archived 21 July 2011 * Battle of PaviaItaly (1525), Diario de Ferrol, 6 September 2002 15th-century births Date of death missing Spanish military personnel People from Ferrol, Spain Galician people (Spain) ","title":"Alonso Pita da Veiga"},{"id":"1830064","text":"What the Butler Saw is a two-act farce written by the English playwright Joe Orton.

Plot summary ; Characters * Dr. Prentice * Geraldine Barclay * Mrs. Prentice * Nicholas Beckett * Dr. Rance * Sergeant Match The play consists of two acts‚Äîthough the action is continuous‚Äîand revolves around a Dr. Prentice, a psychiatrist attempting to seduce his attractive prospective secretary, Geraldine Barclay. The play opens with the doctor examining Geraldine Barclay in a job interview. As part of the interview, he persuades her to undress. The situation becomes more intense during Dr. Prentice's supposed \\"interview\\" with Geraldine Barclay when Mrs Prentice enters. When his wife enters, he attempts to cover up his activity by hiding the girl behind a curtain. His wife, however, is also being seduced and blackmailed by a Nicholas Beckett. She, therefore, promises Nicholas the post as secretary, which adds further confusion, including Nicholas, Geraldine and a police officer dressing as a member of the opposite sex. Dr. Prentice's clinic is also faced with a government inspection, led by Dr. Rance, which reveals the chaos in the clinic.

It is located in the village of Vik√∏yri. It was once the church for the Hopperstad parish in the Diocese of Bj√∏rgvin. The church is currently owned by the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments. The brown, wooden stave church was built during the 12th century. The church seats about 30 people. The stave church is assumed to have been built around the year 1130 and still stands at its original location. In 1997, a series of samples from the logs were collected for dendrochronological dating of the church. A total of seven samples produced an estimate for the construction ranging from 1034 to 1116 and resulted in no definite conclusion. The only possible conclusion is that this is one of the oldest stave churches still standing in Norway. The church is currently owned by the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments. The two old parishes of Hopperstad and Hove were abolished in 1875, and replaced by the new, united, Vik parish. The new Vik Church was finished in 1877, and the two medieval churches of Hopperstad and Hove have since then been turned into museums. There is a replica of the Hopperstad reconstruction at the Heritage Hjemkomst Center in the city of Moorhead in the state of Minnesota in the United States. It was consecrated in 1998. History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the 1100s, probably between 1130 and 1150. About 700 years after its construction the church was abandoned and its exterior stripped. The church was in very poor condition for many years until the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments purchased the building in 1880. Using the Borgund Stave Church as a model, architect Peter Andreas Blix reconstructed the church between 1884 and 1891. During the reconstruction, carved sections were found beneath the floor which indicates that the new church replaced an older church, which was probably built in the latter half of the 11th century. The church had not undergone any major changes until the 17th century. At that time the nave was lengthened to the west, and a bell-tower was added above the new extension. To the east a log section was added, and a new vestibule to the south with its own entrance. The largest addition came to the north with a log construction, named the new church (nykirken). The constructions were finalized in the 18th century, but then removed in around 1875. There are no known images of the interior from this time, but a story written by the priest Niels Dahl, who is assumed to have visited the church in 1824, describes the interior. Present building The church is a triple-nave stave church of what is known as the Borgund-type. It has three portals, and the western portal is an excellent example of Middle Age wood carving. The motifs are of a romance character, often associated with European influence. The nave is a raised central room with an aisle around it, and the choir is apsidal and narrower than the nave. The church contains an altar dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and 14th-century ciborium with a baldachin on the north side. The ciborium has four sculptured heads, that of Christ with a halo, a queen, a king, and a monk. The roof of the baldachin bears a painting of the birth of Christ.

The foundation chose Myrdal because it thought that as a non-American, he could offer a more unbiased opinion. Myrdal's volume, at nearly 1,500 pages, painstakingly detailed what he saw as obstacles to full participation in American society that American blacks faced as of the 1940s. Ralph Bunche served as Gunnar Myrdal's main researcher and writer at the start of the project in the Fall of 1938. It sold over 100,000 copies and went through 25 printings before going into its second edition in 1965. It was enormously influential in how racial issues were viewed in the United States, and it was cited in the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case \\"in general\\". The book was generally positive in its outlook on the future of race relations in America, taking the view that democracy would triumph over racism. In many ways it laid the groundwork for future policies of racial integration and affirmative action.  Analysis  Myrdal believed he saw a vicious cycle in which whites oppressed blacks, and then pointed to blacks' poor performance as reason for the oppression. The way out of this cycle, he argued, was to either cure whites of the prejudice he believed existed, or to improve the circumstances of blacks, which would then disprove whites' preconceived notions. Myrdal called this process the \\"principle of cumulation\\". In Black-White Relations: The American Dilemma, economist Junfu Zhang gives this description of Myrdal's work: Myrdal, writing before the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, alleged that northern whites were generally ignorant of the situation facing Negro citizens, and noted that \\"to get publicity is of the highest strategic importance to the Negro people\\". This proved, given the pivotal role played by the press in the movement, to be strikingly prescient.  American Creed  At the center of Myrdal's work in An American Dilemma was his postulate that political and social interaction in the United States is shaped by an \\"American Creed\\". This creed emphasizes the ideals of individualism, civil liberties, and equality of opportunity.Myrdal, Gunnar (1944). An American dilemma: The negro problem and modern democracy. New York: Harper & Bros. Myrdal claims that it is the \\"American Creed\\" that keeps the diverse melting pot of the United States together. It is the common belief in this creed that endows all people‚Äîwhites, blacks, rich, poor, male, female, and immigrants alike‚Äîwith a common cause and allows them to co-exist as one nation.

It is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Sogndal Municipality and it is located in the village of Kaupanger, on the northern shore of the Sognefjorden. It is the church for the Kaupanger parish which is part of the Sogn prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bj√∏rgvin. The brown, wooden church was built in the mid-12th century (around 1140) and it has been in use ever since that time. The church seats about 125 people. The church is a Norwegian Cultural Heritage Site and it is owned by the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments. The nave is supported by 22 staves (large bearing columns), eight on each of the longer sides and three on each of the shorter. The elevated chancel is carried by four free standing staves. The church has the largest number of staves to be found in any one stave church. It is the largest of the five stave churches in Sogn og Fjordane county. History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1308, but the church was likely built in the mid-12th century, around the year 1140. It is situated on the ruins of what might be two previous stave churches. Kaupanger was a market town that King Sverre burned down in 1184 to punish the local inhabitants for disobeying him. It was previously thought that the stave church previously standing on this site burned down in this fire, as archaeological research in the 1960s revealed that the previous church had burned down. The present church was therefore believed to have been built around 1190. Recent research has changed these assumptions. Dendrochronology has shown that the timber used for building the church was cut in 1137. Also, Sverris saga makes no mention of the burning of the church at the time the town was burnt. Consequently, it is now assumed that the church was built around 1140‚Äì1150. Several restoration projects have taken place both inside the church and on the exterior. A major reconstruction was carried out in 1862, which has been called a \\"brutal modernization\\". New rows of windows were cut into the sides of the church, white exterior panelling was installed and dark roof tiles covered the old shingle roof. In 1959‚Äì1960, a restoration was carried out and many of the 1862 changes were undone and it was brought back to its 17th century look. The pulpit, altarpiece and font are all from the 17th century. In 1984, composer Arne Nordheim was inspired by the neumes and the sound of the medieval bells in Kaupanger stave church in composing the work Klokkesong, which was first performed inside the church as part of the 800th commemoration of the Battle of Fimreite.

The suburb is situated between Clifton, Cotham, Bishopston and Westbury Park. The boundaries of the district are not precisely defined, but are generally taken to be Whiteladies Road in the west, the Severn Beach railway line in the south and Cranbrook Road in the east. Redland is also the name of a council ward, which covers a slightly different area. Redland ward extends to the southern part of Bishopston, and does not include the part of Redland south of Redland Road,Ward map which is in Cotham ward. Redland is known as a popular student accommodation area, particularly with second and third year students from the city's university.  History  There are different views of the origin of the name Redland. One source says that in the 11th century it was known as Rudeland, possibly from Old English rudding, meaning \\"cleared land\\".Smith, V. (2002) Street Names of Bristol p.13 Another source points to a mention in 1209 as Thriddeland, probably meaning \\"the third part of an estate\\".Mills, A.D. and Room, A. A Dictionary of English Place-Names Oxford University Press Yet another source refers to a mention in 1230 of Rubea Terra and a later mention as la Rede Londe, derived from the red colour of the soil. For many centuries Redland was in the large parish of Westbury-on-Trym in Gloucestershire. It became a separate civil parish in 1894, but in 1896 the civil parish was abolished and incorporated into the city and county of Bristol.Vision of Britain website It remained in the ecclesiastical parish of Westbury-on-Trym until 1942. In 1732 the Redland estate was acquired by John Cossins (d.1759) from his wife's uncle George Martin.Smith, V. (2002) Street Names of Bristol p.90 He replaced the old manor house with Redland Court, a house of Classical design. The estate was sold off in 1865, and the area was then developed for housing.  Churches  The suburb is known for its Georgian parish church Redland Chapel, which was built, probably by John Strahan with plasterwork by Thomas Paty, in 1742 as a private chapel for the local manor house, Redland Court, though it was not consecrated until 1790. It eventually became the parish church when the parish of Redland was separated from Westbury-on-Trym in 1942 and, unusually, has no dedication to a patron saint. It is a Grade I listed building. The Swedenborgian church in nearby Cranbrook Road was erected in 1899 and has recently closed. The congregation was formed in 1791 and had a church in Terrel Street. The present gothic church was designed by a Mr Paul of Wells Road and was intended to be a lecture hall alongside a larger church that was never built. Neil Marchant wrote a book ' Like A River Flowing' covering the history of this church which can now be found in Bristol central library. The church is currently up for sale and likely to be redeveloped. Trinity United Reformed Church in Cranbrook Road closed recently and has been converted into houses. The church began in the recently demolished church hall of 1901 which was demolished for the car park. The main church was built in 1907 to the designs of Phillip Munro in a very Scottish kind of Gothic.The Presbyterian Churches of Bristol St Catherines church (Salisbury Road) has been converted to housing. It was erected in 1898 with the intention of a larger church being built alongside. The building is currently a long lancet style with porch - however it closed in the 1950s and was used for storage before being converted to housing. Redland Park United Reformed Church on the Redland side of Whiteladies Road was founded in 1861 (as Redland Park Congregational Church).Redland Park URC History The building was destroyed in the Bristol Blitz in 1940, and the new church was opened in 1957. Tyndale Baptist Church, also on the Redland side of Whiteladies Road, was founded in 1867, largely destroyed in the Blitz and rebuilt in 1955.  Schools  Redland is home to Redland Green School, a free academy secondary school opened in 2007 which also contains the secondary campus of Claremont Special School. Bristol Steiner Schoolhttp://bristolsteinerschool.org/ is also in the ward. Redland formerly contained Redland High School, an independent girls' school which merged with The Red Maids' School in September 2017, to form Redmaids' High School. St Bonaventure's Catholic Primary School and Bishop Road Primary School are in Redland ward.  Other listed buildings  The architecture of the buildings is generally Georgian but with some Victorian buildings and a small number of mid-twentieth century ones. Redland Court, which is now Redland High School, was built between 1732 and 1735 by John Strachan, for John Cossins, on the site of an Elizabethan House which previously stood on the same site. It is grade II* listed, as are the piers and gates at the main entrance, the perimeter wall, piers and gates to Redland Chapel churchyard and the West gateway and attached garden wall and balustrade. There are at least twenty individual houses in Redland having grade II or II* listing.  Transport  The southern part of Redland is served by Redland railway station on the Severn Beach line. Redland is served by bus service 9 operated by First West of England, which calls at Redland station and loops around the middle of Redland to The Downs. Stagecoach service 77 runs between Bristol bus station to Thornbury via Cranbrook Road, supported by financial contributions from both Bristol City Council and South Gloucestershire Council.  Politics  Redland is within the Bristol West Parliamentary constituency. Redland ward in the is within Bristol City Council jurisdiction and returns two councillors every four years. The incumbents are Fi Hance and Martin Fodor, both of the Green Party.  Local events  At the start of every May a f√™te is held on Redland Green. This is called the Redland Fair, the Redland May Fair, or simply the May fair, and takes place on the May Day bank holiday.

It is located in the village of Undredal, on the shore of the Aurlandsfjorden. It is the church for the Undredal parish which is part of the Sogn prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bj√∏rgvin. The white, wooden church was built in a stave church style around the year 1147. The church is only and has only 40 seats, making it the smallest stave church still in use in all of Scandinavia. The parish only includes one small, rather isolated valley, with only 116 parishioners, making it the second smallest parish in the Diocese of Bj√∏rgvin. History Undredal Stave Church was built in the middle of the 12th century, probably the year 1147. The church has been moved from different locations and reconstructed a few times. Around 1850, the building was extended to the west with the addition of a belltower and porch. In 1913, there were plans to dismantle the church and move it to a museum in the village of Kaupanger (in Sogndal), but this never happened. Instead it was reconstructed in 1984 and underwent extensive maintenance work. Inside the church, the ceiling is decorated with biblical figures and angels.

The French cavalry inflicted a severe defeat on the English. Many of the English knights and men-at-arms on horses were able to escape but crippling losses were inflicted on the corps of veteran English longbowmen, which was not reconstituted after the battle. This victory was to the French what Agincourt was to the English. Although credited to Joan of Arc, most of the fighting was done by the vanguard of the French army as English units fled, and the main portions of the French army (including Joan herself) were unable to catch up to the vanguard as it continued to pursue the English for several miles. Background After the English abandoned the Siege of Orl√©ans on 8 May 1429, the survivors of the besieging forces withdrew to nearby garrisons along the Loire. A month later, having gathered men and supplies for the forthcoming campaign, the French army, under the command of the Duke of Alen√ßon, set out to capture these positions and the bridges they controlled. On June 12th they took Jargeau by storm, then captured the bridge at Meung- sur-Loire and marched on, without attacking the nearby castle, to lay siege to Beaugency on 15 June. An English reinforcement army under Sir John Fastolf, which had set off from Paris following the defeat at Orl√©ans, now joined forces with survivors of the besieging army under Lord Talbot and Lord Scales at Meung-sur-Loire. Talbot urged an immediate attack to relieve Beaugency, but was opposed by the more cautious Fastolf, who was reluctant to seek a pitched battle against the more numerous French. The garrison of Beaugency, unaware of the arrival of Fastolf's reinforcements and discouraged by the reinforcement of the French by a Breton contingent under Arthur de Richemont, surrendered on 18 June. Talbot then agreed to Fastolf's proposal to retreat towards Paris. Learning of this movement, the French set off in pursuit, and intercepted the English army near the village of Patay. The battle In this battle, the English employed the same methods used in the victories at Cr√©cy in 1346 and Agincourt in 1415, deploying an army composed predominantly of longbowmen behind a barrier of sharpened stakes driven into the ground to obstruct any attack by cavalry. Becoming aware of the French approach, Talbot sent a force of archers to ambush them from a patch of woods along the road. Apparently dissatisfied, Talbot attempted to redeploy his men, setting up 500 longbowmen in a hidden location which would block the main road. However, they were faced with a sudden cavalry assault by 180 knights of the French vanguard under La Hire and Jean Poton de Xaintrailles before they had a chance to prepare their position and were swiftly overwhelmed, leading to the exposure of the other English units, which were spread out along the road. Earlier, the English longbowmen had inadvertently disclosed the position of the English army to French scouts when a lone stag wandered onto a nearby field and the archers raised a hunting cry. With the threat of an ambush dealt with, the French knights were soon joined by the rest of the vanguard of about 1,300 mounted men-at-arms. They then charged at the English positions on the flanks, which were left unprotected by sharpened stakes. Fastolf's unit attempted to join up with the English vanguard but the latter fled, forcing Fastolf to follow suit. The rest of the battle was a prolonged heavy cavalry mopping-up operation against the fleeing English units, with little organized resistance. During the course of the battle, the English lost over 2,000 men out of a force of about 5,000 according to Barker, with a loss of 2,500 men being the numbers specifically given by Grummitt, many of them longbowmen. By contrast the French lost only about one hundred men. Fastolf, the only English commander who remained on horseback, managed to escape. Talbot, Scales and Sir Thomas Rempston were captured. Talbot later accused Fastolf of deserting his comrades in the face of the enemy, a charge which he pursued vigorously once he had negotiated his release from captivity. Fastolf hotly denied the charge and was eventually cleared of the charge by a special chapter of the Order of the Garter. The French and English Clashing. The English, however, did not fight on horseback Consequences The virtual destruction of the English field army in central France and the loss of many of their principal veteran commanders (another, the Earl of Suffolk, had been captured in the fall of Jargeau, while the Earl of Salisbury had been killed at the siege of Orl√©ans in November 1428), had devastating consequences for the English position in France, from which it would never recover. During the following weeks the French, facing negligible resistance, were able to swiftly regain swathes of territory to the south, east and north of Paris, and to march to Reims, where the Dauphin was crowned as King Charles VII of France on 17 July.

It originates in the Germanic name Hrolf, itself a contraction of Hrodwulf (Rudolf), a conjunction of the stem words hrod (\\"renown\\") + wulf (\\"wolf\\"). The Old Norse cognate is Hr√≥lfr. An alternative but less common variation of Rolf in Norway is Rolv. The oldest evidence of the use of the name Rolf in Sweden is an inscription from the 11th century on a runestone in Forsheda, Sm√•land. The name also appears in Orkneyinga saga, where a scion of the jarls of Orkney, G√•nge-Rolf, is said to be identical to the viking Rollo who captured Normandy in 911. Rolf is a first name or part of a double name or a longer name in Sweden, Norway, Germany, Finland and Denmark, and to a lesser extent in Iceland. In Europe the name Rolf is most popular in Sweden where, as of 2012, there were 54,737 people with Rolf as their first name or part of a double or a longer name. At the same time there were 511 people in Sweden with Rolf as their last name.

It began and largely remained a mail-order enterprise, recruiting people through advertising in popular magazines and through direct mail solicitations. The first advertisement for Psychiana, which Robinson himself penned and took around to local publishers in Spokane, Washington in 1929, featured a picture of Robinson with the headline, \\"I TALKED WITH GOD (yes I did, actually and literally).\\" Those who expressed an interest in Robinson's promises of health, wealth, and happiness by responding to one of his ads were offered a series of bi-weekly lessons by mail on a subscription plan. Robinson had his own printing presses and started a small publishing company, which offered many of his own books on various spiritual themes, as well as his memoir, The Strange Autobiography of Frank B. Robinson. Themes Thematically, Robinson's ideas, as expressed in Psychiana, grew out of the metaphysical tradition and can be classified under the New Thought umbrella. Robinson adopted concepts such as affirmations, positive thinking, self-help and mental healing into Psychiana's lessons and emphasized health and material prosperity as possible rewards for dedicated and hardworking Psychiana students. Robinson said that the name he chose, \\"Psychiana,\\" came to him in a dream. He unabashedly referred to himself as a prophet, and envisioned his movement as becoming a worldwide, revolutionary spiritual force; at the same time, he made little effort to establish any kind of organizational structure beyond his headquarters office in Idaho, preferring to keep the operation strictly on a correspondence level. Controversy Psychiana burgeoned during the Great Depression, but Robinson offended many of his contemporaries, not only by the \\"businesslike\\" nature of Psychiana, but also with his harsh criticisms of conventional Christianity. Deportation proceedings were initiated against him in a federal court in Idaho, his opponents claiming that he was a foreign national illegally residing in the United States. During the trial, Robinson contended that although he had been raised in England, he had been born in New York City while his father was visiting the U.S., and was therefore a U.S. citizen. Nonetheless he was ordered to leave the country. Robinson traveled to Cuba, where he stayed briefly while Idaho Senator William Borah intervened on his behalf and helped him to obtain a visa. Robinson was soon back in Idaho and became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1942. Robinson had a penchant for mink coats and other trappings of wealth, and was accused of taking financial advantage of his followers. Mitch Horowitz devotes a chapter to Robinson in his 2009 book Occult America, writing that by all accounts Robinson was sincere in his devotion to Psychiana and truly believed he was offering useful guidance and advice.Horowitz, Mitch (2010). Occult America: The Secret History of How Mysticism Shaped Our Nation. NY, Bantam Additionally, writes Horowitz, Psychiana was wildly successful, but much of the movement's income went to cover postage costs for mailing thousands of Psychiana pamphlets. Robinson's annual income was estimated at the equivalent of about $130,000 in 2009 dollars‚Äîabove the average income, but not outrageously so and within the reach of many white collar workers and hardly rising to the level of an opulent lifestyle. Upon Robinson's death in 1948, his wife, Pearl Robinson, and son, Alfred Robinson, tried to continue the operation of Psychiana. At the end of five years, however, Alfred shut the business down, refusing a buyout offer from St. Louis and giving Psychiana's archived materials to the University of Idaho. It is said that Alfred, a Presbyterian, did not agree with his father's theological beliefs.  See also  New Thought Movement * List of New Thought writers  Further reading  Black, John.

A version was released in 1990 for the Game Boy in Japan and in 1991 in Europe and North America, which included the Four Player Adapter for four-player gameplay. Gameplay Screenshot of the Famicom version, showing the player preparing to turn a corner. The game features racing in one of two Formula One cars around a variety of tracks near set in a landmark scenery. In the Family Computer version of the game, the cars come in three colors: red, light orange, and dark blue.Images of F-1 Race for the Family Computer at Retro Game Zone Gameplay in the Family Computer version is similar to that of Namco's Pole Position. Finishing in first, second, or third results in a podium finish; players must win on each track to advance to the next. Vehicles in the game have a generic two-speed manual transmission governing their speed (with a \\"LOW\\" setting and a \\"HI\\" setting).Basic game summary at Xrea There are ten tracks in the race; the game repeats itself after the conclusion of the tenth circuit. Three difficult levels help beginners to adjust to the artificial intelligence on \\"skill level 1\\" while novices get some extra challenge on \\"skill level 2\\" and experts get the ultimate challenge on \\"skill level 3.\\" A strict time limit forces players to finish races without mistakes in order to progress to a more complicated race track. When the player's car come into contact with other cars, it will be destroyed and respawn, usually losing several seconds. Several Nintendo characters appear at the end of race circuits for the Game Boy version: Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Toad, Bowser, Link, Samus, Pit and Donkey Kong. The game resulted in a Grand Prix series sequel, featuring Famicom Grand Prix: F-1 Race and Famicom Grand Prix II: 3D Hot Rally. Similar to the original, both games were never released outside Japan. The Game Boy version has a considerably different gameplay compared to the original version, with longer race tracks set in different countries and new driving mechanics, as well as different game modes. The player is able to activate a temporary speed boost by pressing and holding up on the D-pad, this replaces the low-high gear setting from the Famicom version. In addition, the player is able to powerslide by continuing to hold left or right when turning sharp corners. Unlike the Famicom version, colliding with other cars no longer destroys the player's car and hitting an obstacle simply makes the car spin out. Development and release Development of F1 Race was handled by Japanese video game designer Satoru Iwata, alongside a small team at his company HAL Laboratory. Production of the game began shortly after the completion of Golf, and was in development alongside several other Famicom titles such as Pinball, Mach Rider and Balloon Fight. In a 1999 interview with Used Games magazine, Iwata recalled the game being a challenge to produce; F1 Race was the first Famicom game to feature raster scrolling, a feature that was not automatically built into the system, leading to him and his team having to program it from scratch. It was developed based on Iwata's personal love for racing games, which would become influential in his later projects such as the Mario Kart series and F-Zero. It was published by Nintendo and released in Japan on November 2, 1984. A Game Boy version of F1 Race was published in Japan on November 9, 1990, in North America on February 3, 1991, and in Europe on October 10, 1991. The conversion was developed by Nintendo Research & Development 1 (R&D1;) and designed by Naotaka Onishi, with music by Ryo Yoshiyoshi Ninohe and programming by Kenji Imai. Retitled F-1 Race, it allows for four-person multiplayer via the Game Boy Four Player Adapter. Reception GamesRadar ranked it the 49th best game available on the Game Boy and/or Game Boy Color. The staff called it a \\"first-class racing game\\" and praised its wide appeal to racing fans.

If the result of an operation is greater than the maximum, it is set (\\"clamped\\") to the maximum; if it is below the minimum, it is clamped to the minimum. The name comes from how the value becomes \\"saturated\\" once it reaches the extreme values; further additions to a maximum or subtractions from a minimum will not change the result. For example, if the valid range of values is from ‚àí100 to 100, the following saturating arithmetic operations produce the following values: *60 + 30 ‚Üí 90. *60 + 43 ‚Üí 100. (not the expected 103.) *(60 + 43) ‚àí (75 + 75) ‚Üí 0. (not the expected ‚àí47.) (100 ‚àí 100 ‚Üí 0.) *10 √ó 11 ‚Üí 100. (not the expected 110.) *99 √ó 99 ‚Üí 100. (not the expected 9801.) *30 √ó (5 ‚àí 1) ‚Üí 100. (not the expected 120.) (30 √ó 4 ‚Üí 100.) *(30 √ó 5) ‚àí (30 √ó 1) ‚Üí 70. (not the expected 120. not the previous 100.) (100 ‚àí 30 ‚Üí 70.) As can be seen from these examples, familiar properties like associativity and distributivity may fail in saturation arithmetic.In fact, non-saturation arithmetic can also suffer associativity and distributivity failures in limited-precision environments, but such failures tend to be less obvious. This makes it unpleasant to deal with in abstract mathematics, but it has an important role to play in digital hardware and algorithms where values have maximum and minimum representable ranges. Modern use Typically, general-purpose microprocessors do not implement integer arithmetic operations using saturation arithmetic; instead, they use the easier-to-implement modular arithmetic, in which values exceeding the maximum value \\"wrap around\\" to the minimum value, like the hours on a clock passing from 12 to 1. In hardware, modular arithmetic with a minimum of zero and a maximum of rn ‚àí 1, where r is the radix can be implemented by simply discarding all but the lowest n digits. For binary hardware, which the vast majority of modern hardware is, the radix is 2, and the digits are bits. However, although more difficult to implement, saturation arithmetic has numerous practical advantages. The result is as numerically close to the true answer as possible; for 8-bit binary signed arithmetic, when the correct answer is 130, it is considerably less surprising to get an answer of 127 from saturating arithmetic than to get an answer of ‚àí126 from modular arithmetic. Likewise, for 8-bit binary unsigned arithmetic, when the correct answer is 258, it is less surprising to get an answer of 255 from saturating arithmetic than to get an answer of 2 from modular arithmetic. Saturation arithmetic also enables overflow of additions and multiplications to be detected consistently without an overflow bit or excessive computation, by simple comparison with the maximum or minimum value (provided the datum is not permitted to take on these values). Additionally, saturation arithmetic enables efficient algorithms for many problems, particularly in digital signal processing. For example, adjusting the volume level of a sound signal can result in overflow, and saturation causes significantly less distortion to the sound than wrap-around. In the words of researchers G. A. Constantinides et al.:G. A. Constantinides, P. Y. K. Cheung, and W. Luk. Synthesis of Saturation Arithmetic Architectures.  Implementations  Saturation arithmetic operations are available on many modern platforms, and in particular was one of the extensions made by the Intel MMX platform, specifically for such signal-processing applications. This functionality is also available in wider versions in the SSE2 and AVX2 integer instruction sets. Saturation arithmetic for integers has also been implemented in software for a number of programming languages including C, C++, such as the GNU Compiler Collection, Language-side builtins, LLVM IR, and Eiffel. This helps programmers anticipate and understand the effects of overflow better, and in the case of compilers usually pick the optimal solution. Saturation is challenging to implement efficiently in software on a machine with only modular arithmetic operations, since simple implementations require branches that create huge pipeline delays. However, it is possible to implement saturating addition and subtraction in software without branches, using only modular arithmetic and bitwise logical operations that are available on all modern CPUs and their predecessors, including all x86 CPUs (back to the original Intel 8086) and some popular 8-bit CPUs (some of which, such as the Zilog Z80, are still in production). On the other hand, on simple 8-bit and 16-bit CPUs, a branching algorithm might actually be faster if programmed in assembly, since there are no pipelines to stall, and each instruction always takes multiple clock cycles. On the x86, which provides overflow flags and conditional moves, very simple branch-free code is possible. Although saturation arithmetic is less popular for integer arithmetic in hardware, the IEEE floating-point standard, the most popular abstraction for dealing with approximate real numbers, uses a form of saturation in which overflow is converted into \\"infinity\\" or \\"negative infinity\\", and any other operation on this result continues to produce the same value. This has the advantage over simple saturation that later operations decreasing the value will not end up producing a misleadingly \\"reasonable\\" result, such as in the computation \\\\sqrt{x^2 - y^2}. Alternatively, there may be special states such as \\"exponent overflow\\" (and \\"exponent underflow\\") that will similarly persist through subsequent operations, or cause immediate termination, or be tested for as in \`IF ACCUMULATOR OVERFLOW ...\` as in FORTRAN for the IBM704 (October 1956).

More specifically, the word gettone can be used to refer to the gettone telefonico (telephone token), which was used during much of the 20th century in Italian phone booths. The gettone was introduced in 1927 by STIPEL and subsequently adopted by other telephone companies. The last version of it (as reproduced in the picture linked below) was produced from 1959 to 1980. In this last version, the gettone had the date marked on it in the form of a four digit number at the bottom of the obverse side of the token. The first two digits represent the year in which the token was minted. The last two digits represent the month. Example: \\"7805\\" represents \\"May 1978\\". Its use ceased in 2001, in coincidence with the upcoming introduction of the European wide Euro currency in 2002. Gettone as means of payment \\"Gettone telefonico\\" used from 1959 to 2001. In the 70's the value of the metal used in Italian small coins had reached a higher value than the face value. This led to a coin shortage in the market, forcing the circulating use of gettone, stamps and bus tickets for small transactions or part exchanges of a larger payment. Gettoni became so common and so well known that they were considered legal tender, almost always being accepted as payment. One gettone was valued 50 lire up to 1980, 100 lire up to 1984 and 200 lire from 1984. The gettone thus became known as a typical Italian item even outside of Italy.

The Dutch victories in the two battles, and at the Battle of Texel that followed in August, saved their country from an Anglo- French invasion. Background The Franco-Dutch War of 1672-1678 resulted from the attempts of Louis XIV of France to annex the Spanish Netherlands. In 1672, troops from France, M√ºnster and Cologne invaded the Netherlands by land, while England's navy attacked Dutch shipping and threatened a seaborne invasion. The conflict between England and the Republic is commonly called the Third Anglo-Dutch War. The years 1672-1673 were particularly desperate for the Dutch, with the French stopped only by Holland Water Line, a deliberate flooding of large parts of the countryside, and the withdrawing of guns and men from the fleet to augment the army of William III of Orange, now Admiral- General of the fleet. A surprise attack by De Ruyter in June 1672, resulting in the Battle of Solebay, had however prevented the allies from establishing naval superiority on the North Sea, keeping open the sea lanes so vital to Dutch trade. When the French invaded, the Orangist party took power, falsely accusing the former leading politician Johan de Witt and his personal friend Lieutenant-Admiral Michiel de Ruyter of plotting to betray the Republic to the French. The Orangists themselves were in fact subsidised by the English. Both England and France hoped to create a Dutch puppet state, using the enormous Dutch mercantile assets to gain world trade dominance, each expecting that any moment the Dutch might surrender to one of them, but fearing not being the one chosen. Therefore, during the battles, mutual suspicion between the French and the English was considerable. This reflected political divisions within the Dutch fleet. De Ruyter was seen as pro-French, while Lieutenant-Admiral Cornelis Tromp, readmitted to the Dutch fleet early in 1673, was a, traditionally pro-English, Orangist. William had asked De Ruyter to purify the fleet from supporters of the old States regime, but the admiral refused. De Ruyter accused Tromp in his face of hoping to sabotage his command in the middle of a battle, but his fears proved to be unfounded. Tromp cared for battle honours above all else. Michiel de Ruyter, since February 1673 Lieutenant-Admiral-General of the confederate Dutch fleet, planned to blockade the main English fleet in the Medway by sinking blockships in its narrowest part, then deal with the remaining English squadrons at his leisure. But the English fleet took to sea in time to prevent this operation, and De Ruyter retreated on 15 May to the Schooneveld, the coastal waters at the mouth of the Schelde River, near the island of Walcheren, to prevent the allies from establishing the naval superiority needed for the transport and landing of a force of 6,000 soldiers of the English Army waiting at Yarmouth. The Schooneveld basin, between two shoals, was so narrow the allies could not take advantage of their numerical superiority. There, De Ruyter was joined by Tromp, adding the squadrons of the admiralties of Amsterdam and the Northern Quarter to that of the Admiralty of de Maze and the Zealandic fleet. De Ruyter read a message from the stadtholder to his captains, informing them they were not only the champions of their nation but of the whole of Christendom and that for any cowards, \\"the least safe place will be the ports of the State for there they shall escape neither the severe hand of Justice nor the curse and hatred of their compatriots\\", many later being overheard repeating these words to themselves. First battle On 2 June 1673 (New Style; 23 May in the Julian calendar then in use in England), the allies, deciding they had waited long enough, approached the Dutch fleet. Prince Rupert had a considerable superiority in ships (eighty-six against sixty-four), men (24,295 to 14,762) and cannon (4,826 to 3,157) ‚Äî indeed the Dutch admirals nicknamed their fleet the \\"Little Hope\\". The Dutch fleet was smaller than usual because the Admiralty of Frisia was unable to assist, that province and Groningen being attacked by Bernhard von Galen, bishop of M√ºnster. However a sudden storm prevented a battle. On 7 June, the wind blowing from the northwest, Rupert tried again and arranged his own squadron of the Red in the van, the French squadron of the White commanded by Jean II d'Estr√©es in the centre, and Sir Edward Spragge's squadron of the Blue in the rear. The Dutch van was commanded by Tromp, the centre by Lieutenant-Admiral Aert Jansse van Nes under direct supervision of De Ruyter himself and the rear by Lieutenant-Admiral Adriaen Banckert. Rupert, convinced that the smaller Dutch fleet would withdraw to Hellevoetsluis when pressed, detached a special squadron at nine in the morning to cut off the retreating Dutch from the north. In this taskforce he concentrated all lighter ships from the regular squadrons so that it would be able to manoeuvre more easily over the shoals. However, De Ruyter did not budge. When however the squadron at last returned to the main allied line, joining Rupert's squadron, the Dutch started to move, but surprisingly in the direction of the enemy. This forced Rupert to attack immediately to prevent the Dutch from gaining the weather gauge, before he could form a proper keel line. The battle began at noon and lasted for nine hours. Using his superior knowledge of the shallow waters, De Ruyter was able to manoeuvre his fleet so close to the shoals that the allies found it difficult to engage without grounding. Rupert first made contact with the squadron of Cornelis Tromp. He had now about half of the allied fleet with him. Sailing slowly to the northeast after some time he reached the edge of the basin. This gave him the opportunity to surround Tromp from the north with the mass of frigates while simultaneously using his favourable windward position to attack him directly from the west with the heavy English ships. The frigate squadron was now in complete disarray however and could not execute such a complicated manoeuvre. Nor did Rupert choose the direct attack. He was much criticised for this afterwards and defended himself by claiming his approach would have been blocked by shoals. This was simply not true and Rupert knew it. Whatever his motives he turned to the southwest, both fleets bombarding each other from a distance, the Dutch inferiority in numbers compensated by the fact that their leeward position gave their guns a better range and the lack of a proper battle line in the enemy squadron. Removing wounded in the allied fleet after the first Battle of Schoonevelt by Willem van de Velde the Elder, drawn in 1673 De Ruyter had at first closely followed Tromp; but becoming aware the French flotilla of de Grancey had joined Spragge against Banckert, creating a gap in the French line, he suddenly tacked to the southwest, separating Tromp from the rest of the Dutch fleet. This greatly surprised the French fleet. The French main force of d'Estr√©es, both frightened and delighted by what it saw as a brilliant manoeuvre, disengaged slowly to the northwest to keep the weather gauge, but like Rupert didn't use this position to attack. This caused De Ruyter to comment: \\"The De Zeven Provinci√´n can still inspire awe among its enemies\\". The Dutch centre now moved in opposite tack behind the enemy rear. Spragge understood that if De Ruyter reached the southern edge of the basin his force would be trapped between the Dutch centre and rear. He immediately broke formation to tack to the southwest also, narrowly escaping to the west with his flotilla, but leaving the flotillas of Ossorey and Kempthorne behind with that of de Grancey in a slower turn in the same direction. Banckert now united his squadron with the Dutch centre by making a similar but larger turn, sailing behind De Ruyter. The Dutch supreme commander had thus gained an excellent position: the enemy fleet was now divided in four uncoordinated parts and he could attack the confused enemy rear with a numerical superiority having the weather gauge. At that moment he had no knowledge of Tromp's situation however and typically decided not to take any unnecessary risks but to join Tromp with the remainder of the Dutch fleet instead, saying: \\"First things first; it's better to help friends than to harm enemies\\". He tacked to the northeast, Banckert now in front, towards both vanguards moving in the opposite direction. Seeing him approach Tromp yelled to his men: \\"There's Granddad! (the Dutch sailors used this term of endearment for De Ruyter) He's coming to help us. I in return shall never abandon him, as long as I can breathe!\\" The heat of battle transcended the old animosities. As the Dutch crews of the van had become rather nervous by the size of their opposing force, Tromp had for hours pretended to be in signal contact with the Dutch centre. The allied rear could now escape to the west also. When the Dutch main force reached Tromp it again tacked to the southwest forming a perfect continuous line of battle with his squadron. The allied rear tried to do likewise with their centre and van, but its formations remained very confused. Spragge, having moved far to the north to reach Tromp, his personal enemy, now inserted his flotilla between d'Estr√©es and Rupert. The combined Dutch fleet then broke repeatedly through the many gaps in the allied line and Rupert, worried by the mounting disorder in his fleet, was happy to disengage at nightfall, only halting his retreat at first light, when it became clear the Dutch were not pursuing. Two French ships were lost (as well as several French fireships expended ineffectually against the Dutch fleet), one Dutch ship was captured and then recaptured, and one, Deventer (70), sank after grounding the next day. Dutch Vice-Admiral Volckhard Schram (of the van) and Rear-Admiral David Vlugh (of the rearguard) were killed. Second battle The allies cruised off the Dutch coast for a week, each accusing the other of having caused the failure, while the British gave vent to recriminations against each other also. Spragge accused Rupert: \\"...the battle was, in truth, as ill fought on our side, as ever yet I saw\\". Worse was to come however. The allies had no intention to enter the Schooneveld again. Captain George Legge of HMS Royal Katherine wrote to his Lord High Admiral the Duke of York: \\"That hole is too little and the sands too dangerous for us to venture among them again\\". They hoped to lure the Dutch fleet to open sea; when at first nothing happened they grew so despondent, they were surprised when the Dutch did in fact come out. On 14 June 1673, De Ruyter, reinforced by four ships (including the heavy Oliphant and Voorzichtigheid) and fresh crews and fully resupplied, took advantage of a favourable northwest wind to attack the allied line. In this battle the allies were in total disarray  partly the result of having been two weeks at sea, including one battle  but mainly because of a curious coincidence: it so happened Spragge, now commanding the van, was visiting Rupert the moment the Dutch attacked. He immediately left for his squadron, but Rupert, suddenly fearing Spragge could never reach his force in time, decided to form the van with his own rear squadron. He tried to overtake the French in the centre, but never having made his intentions clear to them, they did their utmost to remain in formation, i.e. in front of Rupert. Needless to say, the chaos was complete. Edward Spragge wrote in his journal: Rupert repeatedly raised the bloodflag and then lowered it again upon seeing the confusion among his ships, which made a coordinated attack impossible. De Ruyter, utterly amazed and exclaiming, \\"What's wrong with this man? Has he gone mad or what?\\", exploited this disarray by engaging from some distance and firing at the allied masts and rigging, severely damaging Rupert's squadron. The French, when attacked by Banckert, disengaged immediately, very suspicious of the bizarre course of events. Only Tromp clashed with great fury with his eternal enemy Spragge until nightfall. A heavy sea made it impossible for the allies, though in a leeward position, to open their lower gunports, and strong gales had driven all three fleets dangerously close to the British coast. Rupert now desperately attempted to close with the Dutch to save his fleet from destruction, but they, four miles from the coast, retreated to save theirs, and by the morning of 15 June, the damaged allied fleets sailed into the Thames and De Ruyter was safely back in the Schooneveld. The allies had not lost any ships, but they had suffered considerable damage and had to return to port for repairs. Aftermath By skillful manoeuvre, De Ruyter had fought two engagements against a superior fleet, inflicted such damage against his opponents that they were forced to lift the blockade and retire, and taken care to avoid the decisive battle that the allies were hoping to fight. After refitting and establishing with great difficulty somewhat more cordial relationships, the allies decided to cruise off the Texel in the hope of drawing De Ruyter out of the Schooneveld and bringing him to action. But the resulting Battle of Texel was a Dutch victory, and England was forced to withdraw from the costly and unproductive war. References Atkinson, C.

Recanati was founded around 1150 AD from three pre-existing castles. In 1290 it proclaimed itself an independent republic and, in the 15th century, was famous for its international fair. In March 1798 it was conquered by Napoleon Bonaparte. Leopardi's palace It is the hometown of the tenor Beniamino Gigli and the poet Giacomo Leopardi, which is why the town is known to some as \\"the city of poetry\\". Famous medieval ashkenazi kabbalist rabbi Menahem Recanati flourished here in the 13th century. Teatro Persiani named after Giuseppe Persiani an opera composer, born in 1799, is located in the town. History Town Hall The origin of Recanati are unclear, although the area was inhabited since prehistoric times by the Piceni. In Roman times, the river Potenza, which was navigable then, saw the rise of two cities: Potentia, at the mouth, and Helvia Recina, located more inland. When the Goths led by Radagaisus ravaged the region around 406 AD, their inhabitants took refuge on the hills, perhaps founding the modern Recanati, which would take its name from Ricina. In the 12th century, during the controversies between Frederick Barbarossa and the Papacy, Recanati expelled the feudal counts which ruled its area, and gave itself a communal constitution under the lead of consuls (consoli). In 1203 they were replaced by podest√†. In 1228, Recanati sided with Barbarossa's nephew, Frederick II, who again was in conflict with the popes; for this aid, the town was given the control of the nearby Adriatic shore, and the right to found a port (the modern Porto Recanati). In 1239, however, Recanati supported the pope, and the following year Gregory IX gave it the title of City and bishopric seat that had been previously held by the nearby Osimo. In the early 14th century, the strife between Guelphs and Ghibellines, which plagued much of Italy, also affected Recanati. In a series of incidents, citizens of Recanati, among the others, ravaged and plundered the cathedral, and later killed some Guelph (pro-papal) exponents. In response, in 1322, papal mercenaries besieged Recanati, and destroyed its fortifications, the main Ghibelline palaces, and the Priors' Palaces. By 1328, the Pope had pardoned the city; however, her seat as a bishopric was restored only in 1354. In 1415 Recanati hosted former Pope Gregory XII, who died here two years later. At the time, the town was home to a popular trading fair, which was further boosted by Pope Martin V in 1422. During several centuries of economic prosperity, Recanati became home to prominent jurists, writers, and artists such as Lorenzo Lotto and Guercino. Recanati was occupied by Napoleonic troops in 1798. In 1831 it took part to the Risorgimento riots, and was annexed to the newly formed Kingdom of Italy in 1860 after the dissolution of most of the Papal States.

The product features former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb on the cover. It is the first Madden game for the PlayStation Portable and Xbox 360. The game's box art was the first Madden football game to not include Madden's picture on it. The game also features WWE and UFC superstar, Brock Lesnar as a playable character.https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-10-13-brock-lesnar- confirmed-for-wwe-12https://www.cagesideseats.com/2017/7/12/15953026/today- pro-wrestling-history-july-12-happy-birthday-brock-lesnar-wwe-ufc Significant changes Madden 06 introduces the Superstar mode, which allows the player to create and take control of an NFL player from his rookie year all the way to retirement. An athlete can be created by evaluating pairs of judging, based on their IQs, occupations, and hobbies, whether their child would excel in the NFL or by importing a player. Superstar mode is essentially Madden's Franchise mode seen through the eyes of this athlete. Rather than manage the team's front office, the player manages the career of his athlete. It also features the new QB Vision Control. A cone, appearing as a spotlight emitting from the quarterback, simulates his field of vision. To make an accurate pass, the quarterback must have his intended receiver in his field of vision. Passing to a receiver not in the cone reduces pass accuracy significantly. The size of the quarterback's vision cone is directly correlated to his Awareness rating. However, this has been criticized by many fans because it may resemble some bias that EA Sports and the Madden series itself is frequently accused of. A player can shift the vision cone with the right analog stick, or focus the cone on a specific receiver by holding a shoulder button and pressing the button assigned to that receiver. This change also met with the poor reception. Although the passing system adds a whole new level of realism, it also makes the game significantly more difficult for players playing teams with less-aware quarterbacks. These players will be forced to improve their reflexes in order to be competitive, as throwing outside the QB vision cone results in a very weak and inaccurate pass. Accompanying QB Vision is Precision Passing. Pressing the directional button or left analog stick in a certain direction as the quarterback passes the ball will make the throw over the receiver's head, behind him, in front of him, or at his knees. The most critically acclaimed new feature is the highlight stick, which functions like an offensive version of the hit stick from the previous year. When running the football, a player can push forward the right analog stick to run over the defender, at the cost of risking a potential fumble. Several features from previous titles return such as hot routes, playmaker features, and franchise features.http://www.ign.com/games/madden- nfl-06http://www.ign.com/games/madden-nfl-06/xbox-360-742471 The soundtrack for Madden NFL 06 featured EA Trax integration that includes Avenged Sevenfold, Tech N9ne, Memphis Bleek, Slim Thug, Disturbed, Foo Fighters and many more hip hop/rock artists. https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20050801006025/en/EA-Reveals-In-Game- Music-Soundtrack-Madden-NFLhttp://ca.ign.com/articles/2005/08/01/madden- nfl-06-soundtrack  Compatibility  The player could import their created player from Own The City mode in NFL Street 2 into the game's Superstar mode after finishing the game mode.

Reception The game was met with very positive to mixed reception. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 85.26% and 88 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version; 84.11% and 86 out of 100 for the Xbox version; 83.07% and 86 out of 100 for the GameCube version; 76.61% and 78 out of 100 for the PC version; 74.55% and 74 out of 100 for the Xbox 360 version; 74.14% and 75 out of 100 for the PSP version; 69% and 71 out of 100 for the Game Boy Advance version; 66.67% for the Mobile version; and 63.22% and 66 out of 100 for the DS version. Fans and EA developers both view Madden NFL 06 as \\"the undisputed lemon of the franchise\\", because of the concurrent shift from the Xbox and PlayStation 2 to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The passing cone was so unpopular that it disappeared in Madden NFL 09. Reviewers criticized the game's lack of new features and lackluster soundtrack (a recurring complaint), claiming the game plays very similarly to Madden NFL 2005 if the QB Vision cone is turned off. GameSpot gave the mobile version a score of 7 out of 10 and called it \\"a decent game of football with a solid statistical foundation. It breaks new ground for the franchise and promises future installments for football fans. However, this edition definitely shows EA's wireless inexperience and wasn't the stunner it should have been. In particular, the game's visuals are a disappointment.

And it ultimately feels like they were rushed to get this game on the decks by \\"Madden Tuesday.\\" This is unfortunate, because I think a lot of people will download the game hoping to have a \\"Madden experience\\" on their handset, and just end up with an average football game, albeit one with above-average visuals and spoken commentary.\\" Madden NFL 06 was 2005's only NFL-Licensed football videogame, due to the 2004 deal between the NFL/NFLPA and Electronic Arts. The deal grants EA exclusive rights to the likenesses and names of all players, stadiums, logos, and jerseys. Electronic Arts also signed a long-term deal with ESPN, complicating the game's relationship to its titular announcer. In early 2006, Madden  at the time under contract as color commentator for ABC's Monday Night Football  moved to NBC to join their Sunday night NFL coverage beginning in the 2006 season. The Xbox 360 version of Madden 06 features neither Al Michaels nor Madden in the announcing booth. Some positives with the Xbox 360 version were the right stick being used for the QB Vision feature and different songs from the original. =Sales= In the United States, the game's PlayStation Portable version alone sold 590,000 copies and earned $28 million by August 2006.

The PacketCable effort dates back to 1997 when cable operators identified the need for a real-time multimedia architecture to support the delivery of advanced multimedia services over the DOCSIS architecture. The original PacketCable specifications were based on the physical network characteristics of operators in the U.S. For the European market, Cable Europe Labs, maintains a separate, but equivalent effort, EuroPacketCable, based on European network implementations. Technical overview PacketCable interconnects three network types: * Hybrid Fibre Coaxial (HFC) access network * Public switched telephone network (PSTN) * TCP/IP Managed IP networks =Protocols= DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) - standard for data over cable and details mostly the RF band * Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) & Real Time Control Protocol (RTCP) required for media transfer * PSTN Gateway Call Signaling Protocol Specification (TGCP) which is an MGCP extension for Media Gateways * Network-Based Call Signaling Protocol Specification (NCS) which is an MGCP extension for analog residential Media Gateways - the NCS specification, which is derived from the IETF MGCP RFC 2705, details VoIP signalling. Basically the IETF version is a subset of the NCS version. The Packet Cable group has defined more messages and features than the IETF. *Common Open Policy Service (COPS) for Quality of Service =PacketCable voice coders= The required coders are: *ITU G.711 (both Œº-law and a-law algorithm versions) - for V1.0 & 1.5 *iLBC - for V1.5 *BV16 - for V1.5 In addition the specifications recommended the following: *ITU G.728 *ITU G.729 Annex E =PacketCable 1.0= PacketCable 1.0 comprises eleven specifications and six technical reports which define call signaling, quality of service (QoS), codec usage, client provisioning, billing event message collection, public switched telephone network (PSTN) interconnection, and security interfaces for implement a single-zone PacketCable solution for residential Internet Protocol (IP) voice services. =PacketCable 1.5= PacketCable 1.5 contains additional capabilities over PacketCable 1.0. It superseded previous versions (1.1, 1.2, and 1.3). The standard covers 21 specifications and one technical report which together define call signaling, quality of service (QoS), coders, client provisioning, billing event message collection, PSTN interconnection, and security interfaces for implementing a single-zone or multi-zone PacketCable solution for residential Internet Protocol (IP) voice services. =PacketCable 2.0= Version 2.0 introduces IMS Release 7 IP Multimedia Subsystem into the core of the architecture. PacketCable uses a simplified IMS in some areas and enhances it in some cable- specific areas. PacketCable defined Delta specs related to the most important IMS specs from 3GPP.

Founded in 1885, it is known as a producer of professional-grade woodwind and brass instruments, especially saxophones, clarinets and trumpets. Selmer Paris instruments have been played by many well-known saxophonists such as Marcel Mule, Claude Delangle, Frederick Hemke, Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Paul Desmond, Herschel Evans, Zoot Sims, Michael Brecker, Sonny Rollins, Ornette Coleman and Coleman Hawkins. Among famous Selmer Clarinet players is Benny Goodman in his early career. History =Selmer Paris= In the late nineteenth century, brothers Alexandre and Henri Selmer graduated from the Paris Conservatory as clarinetists. They were the great-grandchildren of French military drum major Johannes Jacobus Zelmer, grandchildren of Jean-Jacques Selmer, the Army Chief of Music, and two of 16 children in this musical family.Priestly, Brian, Bacon, tony and Trynka, Paul, Selmer (Paris), The Sax and Brass Book, Backbeat Books, 1998, p.100‚Äì113 At the time, musical instruments and accessories were primarily hand made, and professional musicians found it necessary to acquire skills allowing them to make their own accessories and repair and modify their own instruments. Establishing Henri Selmer & Cie. in 1885, Henri began making clarinet reeds and mouthpieces. In 1898 Selmer opened a store and repair shop in Paris and started producing clarinets. In 1904, Selmer clarinets were presented at the Saint Louis (USA) World's Fair, winning a Gold Medal. Alexandre Selmer established himself in New York in 1909, opening a shop that sold Selmer clarinets and mouthpieces. The H&A; Selmer (USA) Company, originally a retail partnership between the two brothers, was incorporated to expand with H. Selmer & Cie retaining a minority interest in 1923, then sold to its American partner George Bundy in 1927, ending the financial interest of H. Selmer & Cie in the company. =Selmer UK= A semi-independent branch of Selmer for the United Kingdom was created in 1928 under the leadership of two brothers, Ben and Lew Davis. They concentrated primarily on licensing, importing and distribution rather than manufacturing, and by 1939 had grown to become the largest company in the British musical instrument industry. In 1935 Selmer UK began producing sound reinforcement systems under the Selmer name. They expanded their manufacturing facilities by purchasing another P.A. company called RSA in 1946. By 1951 they were manufacturing electric organs and in 1955 they gained the exclusive licensing rights to make Lowrey organs and Leslie organ speakers for the UK. They were also the primary importers and distributors for H√∂fner guitars, a well-known German guitar company, from the early 1950s through the early 1970s. In 1967, H√∂fner actually produced a small range of semi-acoustic and acoustic guitars for Selmer UK These were badged with the Selmer logo and most had a Selmer \\"lyre\\" tailpiece. Model names were the Astra, Emperor, Diplomat, Triumph and Arizona Jumbo. With the growth of skiffle music and the arrival of rock and roll in the mid-1950s, Selmer UK began producing guitar and bass amplifiers. In the early 1960s, despite Selmer's apparent market domination, The Shadows' and The Beatles' endorsement of Vox amplifiers relegated Selmer guitar amplifiers to a distant second place in sales. The management of the company made various lukewarm attempts to gain endorsement from aspiring musicians but became increasingly distant from the developments in pop culture from the mid-1960s considering that its role was to support \\"real\\" or established professional musicians and not the headliners of the pop industry. This was the beginning of the end for Selmer UK. By the early 1970s Selmer UK had been purchased by Chicago Musical Instruments, then the parent company of Gibson Guitars, which Selmer was distributing in the UK. By this time Marshall guitar amplifiers had cornered the market, and the Selmer manufacturing facility was an expensive drain on resources. During this period, the Selmer range of Treble & Bass 50 & 100 valve amplifiers appeared to be stylistic relics from pre-1959 and the decision was made to move the manufacturing facility to a disused brush and coconut matting works dating from 1914, based in rural Essex. The factory which purchased from Music and Plastic Industries. This was a disaster, coupled as it was to an uninspiring reworking of the Selmer range of speaker cabinets and the introduction of a poorly designed range of solid state power amplifiers. After being passed around several other owners, Selmer once again found itself owned by the Gibson Guitar parent company, this time through a holding company called Norlin Music USA. The marketing policy adopted by management involved allowing its distributors to arrange short-term loans of Gibson instruments on a trial basis. This was considered an excellent marketing ploy had it been controlled but the reality of the situation was that instrument loans were made freely available to any musician and bands who made a request. The consequences were that these very expensive musical instruments were used, damaged, and returned unsold to the UK warehouse, where attempts were made to repair them with the limited facilities on hand, as the distribution agreement with the manufacturing base in Kalamazoo, Michigan, did not allow for the return of defective items. At one time in 1977 there were over one thousand damaged, broken and disassembled Gibson guitars stored in an unheated warehouse in Braintree, Essex. The factory in Braintree also developed the manufacturing of Lowrey keyboards from KD kits exported from the Chicago manufacturing base of CMI. These instruments were technically advanced but the build quality was poor compared with keyboards which were just beginning to reach the UK and European markets from Japan. To supplement earnings the company took the decision to import a low cost Italian designed organ marketed as a Selmer product which was distributed in large numbers by catalogue sales. Again the return rate, this time due to damage in transit, was significant. In spite of a rebranding as Norlin Music (UK) the management of the company failed to address the key factors preferring to effect a range of cost-cutting measures. In 1976 Norlin Music Inc., faced with mounting debts, began dismantling Selmer UK piece by piece, until the only facility was a repair center for Lowrey organs with a single employee. This shut down in the early 1980s. Despite being largely unknown in the U.S., Selmer guitar amplifiers from the early 1960s have begun to gain a reputation as vintage collectibles among valve amplifier enthusiasts. =Selmer guitars= In 1932 Selmer partnered with the Italian guitarist and luthier Mario Maccaferri to produce a line of acoustic guitars based on Maccaferri's unorthodox design. Although Maccaferri's association with Selmer ended in 1934, the company continued to make several models of this guitar until 1952. The guitar was closely associated with famed jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt.

ICP is often used to reconstruct 2D or 3D surfaces from different scans, to localize robots and achieve optimal path planning (especially when wheel odometry is unreliable due to slippery terrain), to co-register bone models, etc. Overview In the Iterative Closest Point or, in some sources, the Iterative Corresponding Point, one point cloud (vertex cloud), the reference, or target, is kept fixed, while the other one, the source, is transformed to best match the reference. The algorithm iteratively revises the transformation (combination of translation and rotation) needed to minimize an error metric, usually a distance from the source to the reference point cloud, such as the sum of squared differences between the coordinates of the matched pairs. ICP is one of the widely used algorithms in aligning three dimensional models given an initial guess of the rigid transformation required. The ICP algorithm was first introduced by Chen and Medioni, and Besl and McKay. The Iterative Closest Point algorithm contrasts with the Kabsch algorithm and other solutions to the orthogonal Procrustes problem in that the Kabsch algorithm requires correspondence between point sets as an input where-as Iterative Closest Point treats correspondence as a variable to be estimated. Inputs: reference and source point clouds, initial estimation of the transformation to align the source to the reference (optional), criteria for stopping the iterations. Output: refined transformation. Essentially, the algorithm steps are: # For each point (from the whole set of vertices usually referred to as dense or a selection of pairs of vertices from each model) in the source point cloud, match the closest point in the reference point cloud (or a selected set). # Estimate the combination of rotation and translation using a root mean square point to point distance metric minimization technique which will best align each source point to its match found in the previous step. This step may also involve weighting points and rejecting outliers prior to alignment. # Transform the source points using the obtained transformation. # Iterate (re-associate the points, and so on). Zhang proposes a modified k-d tree algorithm for efficient closest point computation. In this work a statistical method based on the distance distribution is used to deal with outliers, occlusion, appearance, and disappearance, which enables subset- subset matching. There exist many ICP variants, from which point-to-point and point-to-plane are the most popular. The latter usually performs better in structured environments.Fran√ßois Pomerleau, Francis Colas, Roland Siegwart, and St√©phane Magnenat. Comparing ICP Variants on Real-World Data Sets.

Later, Gribbs served as a judge on the Michigan Court of Appeals. Gribbs was the last white mayor of the city, which was in the midst of becoming a majority-black city, until the election of Mike Duggan in 2013. Life and career Gribbs was born in Detroit on December 29, 1925. He was raised on a farm near Capac, Michigan. His parents were Polish immigrants who were basically farmers, though his father also worked on the Ford assembly line. After graduating from high school in 1944, Gribbs served in the Army until 1948. He graduated from the University of Detroit in 1952 with a degree in economics and accounting, and received a law degree from the same institution in 1954. He was an instructor at the university from 1955 through 1957, and became an assistant prosecutor in 1957, a position he held until 1964. He entered private practice in 1964, in the Detroit law firm of Shaheen, Gribbs, and Brickley, where he was partner with Joseph Shaheen of Grosse Pointe Park.. Gribbs ran for a seat as a Recorder's Court judge in 1966, but lost. In 1968, Gribbs was appointed sheriff of Wayne County, later winning a full four-year term. However, in 1969 he was elected mayor of Detroit, defeating opponent Richard H. Austin who later became Michigan Secretary of State. Rather than residing in the Manoogian Mansion, official residence of the mayor of Detroit, Gribbs maintained residence in Rosedale Park Historic District (Detroit, Michigan), a neighborhood in northwest Detroit. In 1969, Gribbs created the Stop the Robberies, Enjoy Safe Streets (STRESS), a secret and elite police unit. STRESS used a tactic called \\"decoy operation,\\" where a police officer tried to entrap potential criminals in an undercover sting. From its inception, STRESS all but ignored white criminals, instead focusing their operations on black communities. STRESS increased confrontations between the black community and police. For example, during its first year of operation the Detroit Police Department had the \\"highest number of civilian killings per capita of any American police department.\\" The unit was accused of conducting 500 raids without the use of search warrants and killing 20 people within 30 months. In 1973, Gribbs declined to seek re-election and was replaced by Coleman Young who was elected Detroit's first African-American mayor in November of that year. After leaving the mayor's office, Gribbs returned to private practice. Gribbs became a circuit court judge in 1975. He was elected to the Michigan Court of Appeals in 1982, upon which he served until his retirement in 2001. Gribbs retired to Northville in suburban Detroit, and conducted private practice in mediation and arbitration. He was the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Piast Institute, a research center devoted to Polish and Polish American affairs. Personal life Gribbs was married to Katherine Stratis (1932‚Äì2011) from 1954 to 1982, and together they had four daughters (Paula, Carla, Rebecca, Elizabeth) and one son (Christopher). In 1990, he married Leola Young Barr. Lee had two children by a previous marriage, Robert Brent Barr, deceased, and Dr Michelle Barr. Gribbs died on April 5, 2016 at his home in Northville, Michigan from cancer, aged 90.

It is a recombinant and slightly modified version of the human interleukin 1 receptor antagonist protein. It is marketed by Swedish Orphan Biovitrum. Medical use Anakinra is administered at home by subcutaneous injection. It is used as a second line treatment to manage symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis after treatment with a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) has failed. It can be used in combination with some DMARDs. For label updates see FDA index page for BLA 103950 It is used to treat anyone from infants to adults with a cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome, including neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease. It also appears to be effective in treating macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), a form of cytokine storm. It is used off label to treat Schnitzler's syndrome. It has been shown to help treat secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) especially in pediatric patients with other rheumatological disorders. It was not tested in pregnant women, but appeared to be safe in animal studies. It should not be used in people who have active infections or latent tuberculosis, who have low white blood cells counts, or who are taking TNF inhibitors. Adverse effects More than ten percent of people taking Anakinra have injection site reactions, headaches, and have increased levels of cholesterol in their blood. Between one and ten percent of people have severe infections, decreased white blood cells, or decreased platelets. It is unclear if taking Anakinra increases the risk of getting cancer; studies are complicated by the fact that people with rheumatoid arthritis are already at higher risk of getting cancer. Chemistry Anakinra is a protein that differs from the sequence of Interleukin 1 receptor antagonist by one methionine added to its N-terminus; it also differs from the human protein in that it is not glycosylated, as it is manufactured in Escherichia coli. History It was first approved in the US in 2001 and Europe in March 2002. In June 2018 NHS England published a Clinical Commissioning Policy: Anakinra to treat periodic fevers and autoinflammatory disorders (all ages) allowing Anakinra to be commissioned as a first-line treatment for Schnitzler's syndrome and in cases where the first-line treatment is not effective for Familial Mediterranean fever, Hyper-IgD syndrome also known as Mevalonate kinase deficiency, and TNF receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), and a Clinical Commissioning Policy: Anakinra/tocilizumab for the treatment of Adult-Onset Still's Disease refractory to second-line therapy (adults), allowing Anakinra to be commissioned for Adult-onset Still's disease \\"as a third line treatment where patients are refractory to steroid-sparing effect DMARDs\\". Anakinra effectively treated meningitis caused by a rare genetic mutation in the gene NALP3 in a 67-year-old man enrolled in the Undiagnosed Diseases Network. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University announced in 2019 that anakinra given to pregnant mice with Zika virus had reduced fetal deaths and birth defects. In November 2019 researchers at the University of Manchester reported that Anakinra might have a use in preventing breast cancer from spreading to the bones.

Facts Roe and Woolley underwent surgery on 13 October 1947 at the Chesterfield Hospital. It was managed under the general supervision of the Minister of Health. Before entering the operating theatre, an anaesthetic consisting of Nupercaine was administered by means of a lumbar puncture. The spinal anaesthetics had been given by Dr.Malcolm Graham. At that time, it was common practice to store such anaesthetic in glass ampoules immersed in a phenol solution to reduce the risk of infection. Unknown to the staff, the glass had a number of micro-cracks which were invisible to the eye but which allowed the phenol to penetrate. When used, the phenol-contaminated anaesthetic caused permanent paraplegia. A later analysis suggests that the most probable cause of the paralyses was an acidic descaler which, by an oversight, had been allowed to remain in the sterilizing water boiler. Decision As the law then stood, to find negligence proved, there must be a duty of care, the defendant must have breached that duty, and that breach must have caused the loss or damage sustained by the plaintiff. The standard of care required of defendants was judged by applying an objective test, considering what a \\"reasonable man\\" would or would not have done in the same situation. In Hall v Brooklands Auto Racing Club (1933) 1 KB 205, it was held that it was the duty of the operators to ensure that the racing track they had designed was as free from danger as reasonable care and skill could make it, but that they were not insurers against accidents which no reasonable diligence could foresee. Similarly, in Glasgow Corporation v Muir (1943) 2 AER 44, a defendant was not negligent in allowing a group to enter a tea room to escape bad weather, because the \\"reasonable man\\" would not have foreseen that these invitees would be injured (scalded) upon entering the tearoom. In the Supreme Court of Judicature, court of appeal the learned Justices said as follows: Denning LJ. \\"We must not look at the 1947 incident with 1954 spectacles.\\" It was held that the micro-cracks were not foreseeable given the prevailing scientific knowledge of the time. Thus, since no reasonable anaesthetist would have stored the anaesthetic differently, it was inappropriate to hold the hospital management liable for failing to take precautions. That the profession had changed its practice in the light of experience proved that the profession was responsible in its self-regulation. In 1954, anaesthetists coloured the phenol with a dye. If a vial became contaminated, the dye showed inside the vial. These vials were then discarded. But, given that the hospital was applying the best practice of the time, there was no negligence. Somervell LJ. \\"It is now clear that phenol can find its way into an ampoule of nupercaine stored in a solution of phenol through cracks which are not detectable by the ordinary visual or tactile examination which takes place in an operating theatre ‚Äî these cracks were referred to in the evidence as \\"invisible cracks\\" ‚Äî or through molecular flaws in the glass. The attention of the profession was first drawn to this risk in this country by the publication of Professor Macintosh's book on Lumbar Puncture and Spinal Anaesthesia in 1951. In 1947 the general run of competent anaesthetists would not appreciate this risk. (Dr Mcintosh, Day 3, 18, 19, 42-E; Dr Organe, Day 8, 61; Dr Cope, Day 9, 25). Dr Graham certainly did not appreciate this as a risk. I accordingly find that by the standard of knowledge to be imputed to competent anaesthetists in 1947, Dr Graham was not negligent in failing to appreciate this risk and a fortiori the theatre staff were not negligent.\\" Morris LJ \\"It is now known that there could be cracks not ordinarily detectable. But care has to be exercised to ensure that conduct in 1947 is only judged in the light of knowledge which then was or ought reasonably to have been possessed. In this connection the then-existing state of medical literature must be had in mind. The question arises whether Dr Graham was negligent in not adopting some different technique. I cannot think that he was\\" References See alsoBolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee *List of cases involving Lord Denning English tort case law Lord Denning cases 1954 in British law Court of Appeal (England and Wales) cases 1954 in case law Negligence case law Medical lawsuits Medical malpractice Department of Health and Social Care Anesthesia ","title":"Roe v Minister of Health"},{"id":"1830251","text":"Guingamp (; ) is a commune in the C√¥tes-d'Armor department in Brittany in northwestern France.

Charlestown High School is the only high school in Charlestown. Charlestown is part of Boston which means the school is part of the Boston Public School System. According to the article, \\"Focus On Children, the Boston Publics Schools School Report Card,\\" of the students enrolled in 2003-2004, 70.6% were in regular education 7.1% in bilingual education, and 22.2% in the special education. The racial/ethnic composition of the student population in the school was: 46.3% Black, 26.4% Hispanic, 19.5% Asian, and 7.6% White.  Academic organization  The school consists of grades nine through twelve. The school provides a strong academic program due to the five small learning communities/pathways. These communities and pathways are within an upper school and lower school. They were created in 1998 and 1999. The five small learning communities have a college-based curriculum with a signature theme. These signature themes range from web design, law & justice, and pre-engineering, to business/technology and MCAS preparation/academics. There are ten teachers and one leader in each small learning communities. Each teacher has one specific theme to teach.  Curriculum  The Charlestown High School curriculum is strongly based on preparing students for a college education. In addition to the basic curriculum, extensive attention is given to college and exploration. Most of the students participate in the Boston University COACH (College Orientation and Career Help) program. Each Friday two groups of Boston University students come to the school where they divide up by teams and go to the pathways classes, for both juniors and seniors. They work with the students on the entire college application process and portray what college life is like to the students. Since the Boston University (and Harvard at one point) COACH program has been at the Charlestown High School, college application and admission has risen 28%. Because of this rise in college applicants at Charlestown High, over 70 percent of the recent graduates have gone to college. Charlestown High School is also known for its vibrant visual arts program. Recognized in a 2005 Fund for Teachers award, student artwork adorns many school and municipal facilities. Other electives include a popular forensics class and Air Force Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps. In addition, the school provides extensive support services through college and business partnerships, such Harvard, Bunker Hill, Liberty Mutual and more. Student volunteers from the Harvard College chapter of Peer Health Exchange also visit the high school to teach sexual and health education classes.  Busing and desegregation  Charlestown High School received considerable national attention in the 1975-1976 school year when court-mandated forced busing brought African-American children to what was at that time a predominantly white high school in an Irish neighborhood of Boston. Forced busing initially brought great discord and resulted in fights and arrests. There were also enduring images such as the famous photograph of a black and a white student holding hands out the window of their school bus (see the NPR article in the external links below). Contributing to the discord was the infamous September 28, 1979 school shooting of Darryl K. Williams, an African- American football player for Jamaica Plain High School, at Charlestown High School during a football game. Three Irish Americans, at least one of whom had dropped out of Charlestown High School, shot Williams at halftime on the field from a building rooftop while his team was huddled for a pep talk.https://bostonglobe.newspapers.com/search/#ymd=1979-09-29 (See List of school shootings in the United States). Williams was permanently paralyzed below the neck. The shooting was initially considered racially motivated, and a race riot was barely averted. However, a large rally in support of the shooting victim was held at City Hall Plaza in Boston for Williams. Also, for security reasons Charlestown High School did not play home football games for nine years.http://archive.boston.com/sports/other_sports/articles/1990/09/30/nobody_won/?page=full Boston Globe article, \\"Nobody Won\\", September 30, 1990  Sports success  The Charletown High school boys basketball team is in the Boston City League.

The Jet Age is a period in the history of aviation defined by the advent of aircraft powered by turbine engines, and by the social change this brought about. Jet airliners were able to fly much higher, faster, and farther than older pistonpowered propliners, making transcontinental and intercontinental travel considerably faster and easier: for example, aircraft leaving North America and crossing the Atlantic Ocean (and later, the Pacific Ocean) could now fly to their destinations non-stop, making much of the world accessible within a single day's travel for the first time. Since large jetliners could also carry more passengers than piston-powered airliners, air fares also declined (relative to inflation), so people from a greater range of socioeconomic classes could afford to travel outside their own countries. Besides the pure jet, the turbine driven propeller engines offered improvements of the piston engine delivering a smoother ride and better fuel efficiency. One exception to jet-powered domination by large airliners was the contra-rotating propellers turboprop design that powered the Tu-114 (first flight 1957). This airliner was able to match or even exceed the speed, capacity and range of contemporary jets; however, the use of such powerplants in large airframes was totally restricted to the military after 1976. The introduction of the Concorde supersonic transport (SST) airliner to regular service in 1976 was expected to bring similar social changes, but the aircraft never found commercial success. After two and a half decades of service, a fatal crash near Paris in July 2000 and other factors eventually caused Concorde flights to be discontinued in 2003. This was the only loss of an SST in civilian service. Only one other SST design was used in a civilian capacity, the Soviet era Tu-144, but it was soon withdrawn due to high maintenance and other issues. McDonnell Douglas, Lockheed and Boeing were three U.S. manufacturers that had originally planned to develop various SST designs since the 1960s, but these projects were eventually abandoned for various developmental, cost, and other practical reasons. Origins The term \\"Jet Age\\" was coined in the late 1940s. At the time, the only jet-powered aircraft in production were military types, most of which were fighters. The expression reflects the recognition that the jet engine had effected, or would soon, a profound change in aeronautics and aviation. One view is that the jet age began with the invention of the jet engine in the 1930s and 1940s. In the history of military aviation it began in 1944 with the introduction into service of the Arado Ar 234 reconnaissance bomber and the Messerschmitt Me 262 fighter during World War II.Green, W.; \\"Warplanes of the Third Reich\\", Macdonald and Jane's (1970). In commercial aviation the jet age was introduced to Britain in 1952 with the first scheduled flight of the de Havilland Comet airliner and to America later in the decade with the first American-built jet airliners.\\"The Jet Age, 1958 ‚Äì today,\\" America by air, Smithsonian national Air and Space Museum. Civil aviation The British de Havilland Comet was the first jet airliner to fly (1949), the first in service (1952), and the first to offer a regular transatlantic service (1958). One hundred and fourteen of all versions were built. However, the first jet airliner to provide a sustained and dependable service was the Soviet Tupolev Tu-104 (201 built) which was the only jet airliner in operation worldwide between 1956 and 1958 (the Comet having been withdrawn in 1954 due to structural failure issues). The Comet and Tu-104 were later outstripped in production by the American Boeing 707 (which entered service in 1958) and Douglas DC-8, which joined it in the skies over the next few years. Other types of the period included the French Sud Aviation Caravelle. When the Boeing 707 began service on the New York to London route in 1958, this became the first year that more trans-Atlantic passengers traveled by air than by ship. As the number of passengers soared, it became impractical to increase the number of aircraft flying from the major hub airports. International airports like that of Orly Airport in Paris, France would construct terminals around bag-check and customs processing efficiency in response to rising passenger numbers. Instead, designers created even larger widebody airliners and the engine manufacturers responded with larger, more powerful and also more fuel- efficient engines. The first \\"jumbo jet\\" was the Boeing 747, and it both increased airport passenger capacity and reduced the cost of air travel, further accelerating the social changes brought about by the Jet Age. Military aviation Military aviation had entered the jet age somewhat earlier, during the closing stages of World War II. In the early postwar years, the increasing use of jet aircraft had little significant impact, serving mainly to continue the slow but steady improvements in performance seen in the past. Supersonic flight brought about a step change in aircraft performance. The Bell X-1, first to break the sound barrier in level flight, was an experimental rocket-powered type, and production jets which followed it into service could fly little faster. The first jet aircraft designed from the outset for supersonic flight was the British Fairey Delta 2. On March 10, 1956 it became the first aircraft to fly faster than 1,000 miles per hour, heralding an era of \\"fast jets\\" typically limited to a speed of Mach 2.2 by the engineering materials available. As jets became faster, their armament changed from guns to missiles. Avionics systems became more complex with radar, fire-control and other systems. Aircraft became larger and more expensive, and so were required to do more to make them economical. All this profoundly affected the nature of military strategy during the Cold War.

The song is a diss track aimed at rappers Nas and Prodigy of Mobb Deep. Background This song was the first official LP diss track to publicize directly the hip hop feud between Jay Z and Nas (although there exists several other rap records prior to this featuring disses from both Nas and Jay Z toward each other). It samples the song \\"Five to One\\" by The Doors and \\"Sound of da Police\\" by KRS-One. The first line in this song is taken from Jay Z's verse in \\"Celebration\\" off of the Streets Is Watching soundtrack. The song also interpolates David Bowie's \\"Fame\\". Jay-Z originally performed the first two verses of Takeover as an untitled diss to Prodigy of Mobb Deep at Hot 97's Summer Jam 2001. While performing the line \\"you was a ballerina/ I got the pictures I seen ya\\" a photograph of Prodigy, as a child, dressed in ballet clothes, appeared on the large screen. Aside from its role in the Jay-Z & Nas feud, Takeover was largely seen as damaging to Prodigy (and Mobb Deep's) careers. References to other rappers In the second verse, Jay Z alleges that Prodigy (member of Mobb Deep) took ballet classes as a child and mocks Prodigy's small stature. Jay-Z further dismisses Mobb Deep as competition in the hip hop industry by pointing out that his career had more commercial success than they ever would, and dissing Mobb Deep's famous song \\"Shook Ones Pt. II\\". Mobb Deep replied to Jay Z in a subsequent LP diss track, but their rivalry has more or less been overshadowed by the rivalry between Nas and Jay Z. In the third verse (which has 32 bars, while the other verses have 16), Jay Z ridicules Nas's discography (at the time consisting of four albums) and claims Nas has a \\"one hot album every ten year average.\\" Jay-Z referred to a widespread feeling from many hip hop critics and artists that Nas's subsequent albums after his legendary Illmatic debut were mediocre follow ups, and dissed Nas' famous song from that album \\"The World Is Yours\\". Jay Z sampled some of Nas' lines for the chorus of Jay Z's famous song \\"Dead Presidents II\\", and claimed in \\"Takeover\\" that he sampled it because Nas was using it wrong (\\"So yeah I sampled your voice, you was usin' it wrong/ You made it a hot line, I made it a hot song\\"). Jay Z also questions Nas's street credibility and claims Nas has lied or exaggerated about his past in songs, with the lines, \\"Nigga, you ain't live it you witnessed from your folks' pad/Scribbled in your notepad and created your life/I showed you your first tec, on tour with Large Professor (Me! That's who!)/Then I heard your album 'bout your tec on your dresser.\\"(This is a reference to the Illmatic song \\"Represent\\"). Jay Z also ridicules Nas's style, flow, and career decisions, with lyrics like, \\"Nigga switch up your flow, your shit is garbage/What you trying to kick knowledge? (Get the fuck outta here)\\" and \\"Fell from top ten to not mentioned at all/To your bodyguard's Oochie Wally verse better than yours/Matter fact you had the worst flow in the whole fuckin' song...\\" which \\"Oochie Wally\\" is a song by The Bravehearts from the collaborative album QB's Finest, and samples the song in this song when Jay-Z mentions it. The song initiated one of the biggest and most hyped hip hop rivalries within the industry, and the song was generally well received by fans. At the time, the song's hard-hitting caliber was such that Jay-Z and many hip hop fans had felt that this song could have potentially ended Nas's career. On the contrary, however, the track merely served to reinvigorate Nas' career as he responded to \\"Takeover\\" with a diss track of his own, entitled \\"Ether\\". Jay-Z responded to \\"Ether\\" with a freestyle entitled \\"Supa Ugly\\". Jay-Z and Nas would release other subsequent diss tracks and records referencing the feud, including \\"Blueprint 2\\" (from Jay Z's The Blueprint2: The Gift & The Curse) and \\"Last Real Nigga Alive\\" (from Nas's God's Son.) \\"Takeover\\" was produced by Kanye West and samples The Doors' \\"Five to One\\" as well as \\"Sound of da Police\\" by KRS-One. 50 Cent swards Mobb Deep in his own diss song \\"Piggy Bank\\", by telling his rival Jadakiss \\"Jada don't fuck with me if you wanna eat, 'cause I'll do your lil' ass like Jay did Mobb Deep.\\" Coincidentally, 50 signed Mobb Deep to his G-Unit Records imprint a mere few months later. On Mos Def's 2004 album The New Danger, the track \\"The Rap Over\\" is essentially a revision of \\"Takeover\\", with a similar Kanye West backing track using the same Doors sample. Mos Def's rewritten lyrics criticize the hip-hop industry in general and attribute hip- hop's direction at the time to \\"old white men\\", \\"corporate forces\\", and substance abuse. Chicago pop-rock band Fall Out Boy referenced this song in their 2007 album Infinity on High with the song \\"The Take Over, the Breaks Over\\" as a direct mention to the rivalry. In 2007 Mistah F.A.B. used the beat from the track on his Royce da 5'9\\" diss track entitled \\"C.I.A.\\" Accolades \\"Takeover\\" appeared at 51 on Pitchfork's The Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s.

At Audi he transformed the mundane Audi Coupe into the legendary Audi Quattro and subsequently became Head of Audi's Munich Design Studio. He helped introduce a slippery aerodynamic look and austere functional cockpits to the Audi range as evidenced by the 1982 Audi 100 and 1986 Audi 80. Whilst in charge of the Audi Munich Design Studio, he worked with J Mays on the 1991 Audi Avus Quattro concept car which previewed a geometrical style as well as the extensive use of aluminium.

The family was temporarily domiciled at Drumdowney while their new mansion at Bellevue, near Waterford, was under construction. Life His father was Edward Sheil, who had acquired considerable wealth in Cadiz in southern Spain and owned an estate in Tipperary. His mother was Catherine McCarthy of Springhouse, near Bansha, County Tipperary, a member of the old aristocratic family of MacCarthy Reagh of Springhouse, who in their time were Princes of Carbery and Counts of Toulouse in France. The son was taught French and Latin by the Abb√© de Grimeau, a French refugee. He was then sent to a Catholic school in Kensington, London, presided over by a French nobleman, M. de Broglie. For a time he attended the lay college in St Patrick's College, Maynooth.Eoin O'Brien Conscience and Conflict: Biography of Sir Dominic Corrigan, 1802‚Äì80, Glendale Press Dublin 1983 In October 1804, he was removed to Stonyhurst College, Lancashire, and in November 1807 entered Trinity College, Dublin, where he specially distinguished himself in the debates of the Historical Society. After taking his degree in 1811 he was admitted a student of Lincoln's Inn, and was called to the Irish bar in 1814. In 1816, he married a Miss O‚ÄôHalloran, niece of Sir William MacMahon, Master of the Rolls in Ireland. They had one son, who predeceased Sheil. His wife died in January 1822.\\"Sheil, Richard Lalor (1791-1851)\\", The History of Parliament His play, Adelaide, or the Emigrants, was performed at the Crow Street Theatre in Dublin, on 19 February 1814, with success, and, on 23 May 1816, it was performed at Covent Garden in London. The Apostate, produced at the latter theatre on 3 May 1817, established his reputation as a dramatist. His other principal plays are Bellamira (written in 1818), Evadne (1819), Huguenot (produced in 1822) and Montini (1820). In 1822, he began, along with W. H. Curran, to contribute to the New Monthly Magazine a series of papers entitled \\"Sketches of the Irish Bar\\". These were edited by Marmion Wilme Savage in 1855 in two volumes, under the title of Sketches Legal and Political. Sheil was one of the founders of the Catholic Association in 1823 and drew up the petition for inquiry into the mode of administering the laws in Ireland, which was presented in that year to both Houses of Parliament. In 1825, Sheil accompanied Daniel O'Connell to London to protest against the suppression of the Catholic Association. The protest was unsuccessful, but, although nominally dissolved, the association continued its propaganda after the defeat of the Catholic Relief Bill in 1825. Sheil was one of O'Connell's leading supporters in the agitation persistently carried on until Catholic emancipation was granted in 1829. In July 1830, he married Anastasia Lalor Power, a widow. He then added the name Lalor. In the same year he was returned to Parliament for Milborne Port, and in 1831 for Louth, holding that seat until 1832. He took a prominent part in all the debates relating to Ireland, and although he was greater as a platform orator than as a debater, he gradually won the somewhat reluctant admiration of the House. In August 1839, he became Vice-President of the Board of Trade in Lord Melbourne's ministry. After the accession of Lord John Russell to power in 1846, he was appointed Master of the Mint, and in 1850 he was appointed minister at the court of Tuscany. He died in Florence on 23 May 1851. His remains were conveyed back to Ireland by a British ship-of-war, and interred at Long Orchard, near Templetuohy, County Tipperary. His Speeches were edited in 1845 by Thomas McNevin. George W. E. Russell said of him: > Sheil was very small, and of mean presence; with a singularly fidgety > manner, a shrill voice, and a delivery unintelligibly rapid.

Overview  The Main Street Museum was founded in 1992 by David Fairbanks Ford in an area of White River Junction, known as the Old South End. The museum's collections of material culture are seemingly unfocused, although this might be the intent of the museum's highly decentralized administration. Categories include: Flora; Fauna; significant objects from around the world; evidence of tramps; Round Things; Tangled Things; journals; extraneous bits of local history; sheet music; postcard collections; electromagnetism devices; relics from the head injury of Phineas Gage; Elvis impersonators; live music; taxidermy and biological anomalies (dehydrated cats). It simultaneously pays homage to the eighteenth century W√ºnderkammern and a focal point of new technology through its website. The Main Street Museum believes itself to have been the first museum in the world with a (functioning) blog, initiated in September 2005. Described by the Washington Post as \\"quirky and avant-garde\\", a heterodox assortment of the local public, scholars, musicians, artists, historians, scientists, drunks and all other types of people have been drawn to the museum's unusual demonstrations, lectures and entertainments. Currently located at White River Junction's former fire station on Bridge Street, next to the railroad underpass on the banks of the White River, the museum has been acknowledged as an integral part of White River Junction's downtown revitalization and the new urbanism of the region.

Its plot revolves around a young pizza driver from New York City, who inherits a trillion US dollars from one of his ancestors who lived in 16th century Florence. With the money comes a prophecy that he must use it to give humanity back its lost future. The title is correctly translated into English as \\"One Trillion Dollars\\", as it refers to the long scale use of the word billion (10^{12}), which is called a trillion in the short scale.  Plot  John Salvatore Fontanelli, the son of a shoemaker in New York who works as a pizza driver, is one day invited to the Waldorf Astoria by an Italian lawyer, where he is informed that he inherited a huge fortune simply by being the last male descendant of a wealthy Italian merchant living and working in 16th century Florence. This merchant put a rather small amount of money in a bank account some 500 years ago. Through the magic of compound interest, this sum has now grown into the equivalent of roughly 1,000,000,000,000 US dollars. In one fell swoop, John Fontanelli has become by far the richest person in the world, his net worth being bigger than the GDP of most countries. Yet, his ancestor has charged his heir with the task of using the inheritance to give back mankind its lost future. After some hither and thither, he accepts the role assigned to him by his ancestor and tries to better the world socially and ecologically. On the advice of his mysterious new consultant, Malcolm McCaine, he founds a huge corporation called Fontanelli Enterprises and strategically invests the inherited fortune in a diversified group of projects to grow his power and influence. Starting with the hostile takeover of ExxonMobil, John Fontanelli's orders now decide the fate of other companies, currencies, and even complete countries' economies. With the passing of time, John recognizes that all this will not ultimately lead him to success in mastering his assigned task. To get a better picture of the future development of mankind, he sets up a gigantic and secret scientific project, which uses complex computer models to simulate different future scenarios. When the sobering result is finally announced, Fontanelli and McCaine differ about the correct approach to save humanity from its obvious self-destroying development. McCaine leaves Fontanelli, thinking that mankind is doomed to being minimized down to a small but qualified elite. By using his own money, he sets up another company and tries to entice away leading scientists in the research of the AIDS virus to withdraw their manpower from the development of an effective cure. Fontanelli, on the other side, is setting up a foundation to organize and enforce the election of a world speaker. In his belief, the multi-national companies can only be controlled by global laws to prevent a catastrophe. The opposing and contradictory strategies of Fontanelli and McCaine to save humanity from its disastrous fate culminate in an exacerbated struggle for power. Fontanelli achieves a partial victory: The election of a world speaker finally takes place. The book ends with the death of John Fontanelli, who gets shot by an old friend who gradually came under the influence of McCaine.Andreas Eschbach. Eine Billion Dollar, L√ºbbe 2001  Analysis  It would be theoretically possible to build up a fortune as described in the book. The initial investment of 300 Florin, assuming an equivalent of 10,000 US-Dollars and an annual interest rate of 4%, would have grown to roughly $1 trillion in the 470 years mentioned in the novel. However, there are certain factors that would render it probably impossible under realistic conditions. Most of the capital appreciation would only happen during the later years of the process. In a time span of 500 years, there would be a great probability of catastrophic events like hyperinflation or even a national bankruptcy which could potentially wipe out the entire investment. But since the capital was spread across various banks in numerous countries at an early point, it is unlikely that it would wipe out the entire fortune. Member of the Vacchi family: \\"While there were some setbacks, we managed to achieve the average interest rate of 4% a year.\\" Other possible causes for complete or partial loss of the money include theft and embezzlement. The lack of these, however, can be explained by the Vacchi family's faith that they are performing a sacred task, this also explains why they would continue said task even though the compensation was insubstantial for some decades. Strategies for saving humanity John Fontanelli first tries to fight poverty by forming, on the advice of its soon-to-be executive director McCaine, a multi-national company to achieve global dominance. To give this entity a positive image in the media, McCaine suggests several measures for the purpose of preservation of the environment. * After the computer simulations reveal no other conclusion than inevitable self-destruction of mankind, McCaine falls for the conviction that an acceleration of the collapse (with the help of AIDS as a global disease) is the only way to confine the damage and secure the survival of a sophisticated elite. * Lorenzo, a distant relative of Fontanelli, argues in articles he writes for a school magazine, that the root of all evil lies in the fact that the central banks are allowing a credit only with the collection of interest. The problem, in his view, is that money cannot multiply on its own. The articles are reminiscent of the theory of Freigeld. * Writer Lord Peter Rawburne advises Fontanelli to abolish the income tax and instead charge tax on commodities. This would have the effect of making products more expensive, but in turn would lead to people having more money to spend. * The novel culminates in a plea for the Tobin tax, which can only be implemented globally. For this purpose, Fontanelli sets up the foundation \\"We The People Organisation\\" (WTPO, instead of WTO) to conduct the election of a world speaker. The most promising candidate for this office in the book is Nelson Mandela.  Trivia The pages in the paperback version of the book are numbered in billions of Dollars. On some pages a certain fact in reference to the amount on that page is stated. (For instance, on page $1,000,000,000: Damage caused by the Western corn rootworm to the agricultural economy in the United States of America every year.) *The American punk rock band Anti-Flag based the song \\"1 Trillion Dollar$\\" on the novel. *The premise of a small deposit in medieval times growing into an enormous present day fortune had previously been used in a slightly different way in the 1956 short story Compounded Interest by Mack Reynolds. In this story a time traveller from the present time makes the original deposit, and also visits the caretakers of the fortune every century giving them advice on where to invest.  Adaptations  The novel was adapted as a 4-part radio play in 2003 by German radio station S√ºdwestrundfunk.

His last assignment in the Army was serving in the Pentagon as the Army's Chief Legislative Liaison. The Office of the Chief Legislative Liaison (United States Army) (OCLL) operates directly under the Office of the Secretary of the Army. Its mission is to coordinate efforts between the US Army and Congress. Prior to his assignment with the OCLL, he was the first commanding general of the Joint Force Headquarters National Capital Region (JFHQ-NCR), a dual-hatted role combined with commanding the Military District of Washington (MDW). After his retirement from the U.S. Army, Jackman was hired in October 2008 by Raytheon Company, a Massachusetts-based defense contractor, as the vice- president over U.S. Army Programs, U.S. Business Development. Jackman may be best known for his role during the seven days in June 2004 that marked the death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan. As the then-commanding general of the MDW (CG MDW), he became a known figure when he escorted former First Lady Nancy Reagan, the former president's wife. Early life Jackman was born in August 1951 in Scottsbluff, Nebraska and is one of at least three children born to Virgil and Maxine Jackman. At the time of his birth, Jackman's parents lived in the nearby city of Gering, where the family lived until they moved to Nebraska's capital, Lincoln, in 1965. Jackman graduated from Lincoln East High School in 1969. Military career Jackman attended the University of Nebraska-Lincoln on an Army ROTC scholarship. While at the University he became an active member of the National Society of Pershing Rifles, an ROTC military fraternal organization known for including many who later became successful Army officers. Upon graduation he was commissioned into active duty in the U.S. Army in June 1973. His first duty assignment was with the 1st Battalion (ABN) 508th Infantry, 82nd Airborne Division, Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where he served as a rifle platoon leader, anti-tank platoon leader, company executive officer, and battalion adjutant. He next served with the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry, 25th Infantry Division, Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, as a battalion S4, rifle company commander, and battalion S3. Following assignment as a Procurement Officer with the United States Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, he served at Fort Bragg as Procurement Officer, Squadron Executive Officer, and Support Squadron Commander in 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta (Airborne) (1st SFOD-D(A)), more commonly known as \\"Delta Force.\\" Army Major General Galen Jackman escorting former First Lady Nancy Reagan during the state funeral of Ronald Reagan, her husband, United States' 40th president Jackman has commanded the 1st Battalion, 14th Infantry, 25th Infantry Division (Light); 2nd Brigade, 7th Infantry Division (Light), Fort Ord, California; and the Ranger Training Brigade, Fort Benning, Georgia. It was under then-Colonel Jackman's command at the Ranger Training Brigade that four Ranger Candidates were killed in training on February 15, 1995 in the Florida swamps of Eglin Air Force Base. Killed were Captain Milton Palmer, Second Lieutenant Curt G. Sansoucie, Second Lieutenant Spencer D. Dodge, and Sergeant Norman Tillman. It was reported to be the worst incident in the Ranger School's 44-year history . Multiple accounts held the leadership climate, both at the command level and at the trainer level, responsible for the multiple errors that led to the training accident and deaths. Among the reasons named for the deaths include the command's lack of a proper risk assessment of the weather conditions surrounding the exercise before it took place and the Ranger trainers' decision to continue with the exercise despite poor training conditions and high water dangers. As a result of the accident, the Ranger School's command changed swamp training to include more food and sleep for trainees and now require trainers to go into potentially high water before their trainees do. No evidence exists to suggest that Jackman suffered any career-related consequences due to the incident. Jackman briefs Senator Patty Murray on the Manned Ground Vehicle program in Washington D.C. Following his command at the Ranger Training Brigade, Jackman served as the Director of Combined Arms and Tactics at the United States Army Infantry School at Fort Benning, as well as the Deputy J3 for Training and Readiness, United States Pacific Command (USPACOM), Hawaii. He was then assigned as Chief of Staff, 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry), Fort Drum, New York, during which he participated as part of NATO's \\"Follow-on Force\\" in Operation Joint Forge, Bosnia- Herzegovina. Shortly thereafter he was made Assistant Division Commander for Support for the 10th Mountain Division. Jackman served as Director of Operations, United States Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) from 2001‚Äì2003, concentrating mostly on anti-drug and anti-terrorism endeavours. He took command of the MDW in mid-2003 and subsequently the JFHQ-NCR in late 2004 at its official inception. While in this dual command capacity, Jackman organized the proceedings and security for the dedication of the World War II Memorial on the National Mall and its accompanying WWII reunion, organized former President Ronald Reagan's state funeral, served as the official escort to the former President's wife, former First Lady Nancy Reagan, and served as commander of the Joint Task Force-Armed Forces Inaugural Committee for President George W. Bush's 2005 Presidential Inauguration. Jackman was assigned as the Army's Chief of Legislative Liaison on July 21, 2005. He retired from that position, and the U.S. Army after 35 years of service, in July 2008.

In the West, it was the dominant source for pictorial cycles of the Life of Mary, especially before the Late Middle Ages.David R. Cartlidge, James Keith Elliott, Art and the Christian Apocrypha, p 32 (and pp. 21‚Äì46 generally), 2001, Routledge, London;  Composition date  According to the research of J. Gijsel / R. Beyers (1997) the archetype of the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew's Recensio-Œ± dates to 800 AD and the composition date to the first half of the seventh century, maybe to around 600 and 625 AD. Gijsel furthermore points out that Joachims representation in Pseudo-Matthew is meant to evoke the model figure of a Merovingian nobleman, this one, according to Gijsel, being Dagobert I during his reign (629639). According to Berthold, the composition date of the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew is around 650 AD at the earliest, due to the fact that it \\"shows literary dependence on Vita Agnetis of Pseudo- Ambrose\\", which itself was used in De Virginitate in 690 AD. According to G. Schneider, the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew was composed in the 8th or 9th century during the Carolingian dynasty. Pseudo-Matthew shares many similarities with, and likely used as sources, the apocryphal Gospel of James and Infancy Gospel of Thomas.  Content  The narrative is prefaced by a series of letters between the early Church father Jerome and the Bishops Comatius and Heliodorus. In these letters the Bishops request that Jerome translate a \\"Hebrew volume, written by the hand of the most blessed Evangelist Matthew,\\" concerning the birth of the virgin mother and the infancy of Jesus. Though the work is attributed to St. Jerome, it is unlikely that St. Jerome actually wrote or translated it: \\"no one who is acquainted with the style of Jerome's letters will think this one authentic.\\"The Ante-Nicene Fathers Vol. VIII pg. 351 The author of the pseudo-Jerome letter claims he compiled and translated the work, taking care to \\"render it word for word, exactly as it is in the Hebrew, since it is asserted that it was composed by the holy Evangelist Matthew, and written at the head of his Gospel,\\" though he expressed doubt as to their authenticity.The Ante-Nicene Fathers Vol. VIII pg. 369 The first half of the narrative tells the story of St. Joachim and St. Anne, the parents of Mary; Joachim's sorrow and persecution on account of their lack of progeny, his exile and return to Anna with child, and the birth of Mary; her entering service as a temple virgin, her prayerful life and vow of chastity, and the choosing of Joseph as her husband and guardian upon her becoming too old to continue as a temple virgin; the Annunciation; Joseph's distress at finding her pregnant, and his eventual acceptance of her honesty; his and Mary's being tested in the temple, and the acceptance of the people in the temple of Mary's and Joseph's innocence. The content of the text is primarily an edited reproduction of the Protevangelium of James, followed by an account of the Flight into Egypt (it is not known on what this is based), and subsequently an edited reproduction of the Infancy Gospel of Thomas. Essentially, it is a (fairly successful) attempt to merge these texts into a single work. To its sources, the Gospel adds the first known mention of an ox and a donkey being present at the nativity of Jesus. The work also helped popularize the image of a very young Mary and relatively old Joseph from the Gospel of James.Jesus‚Äô Brothers?!? And the Proto-Gospel of James It had a strong influence in medieval thought, partly due to its inclusion in the Golden Legend. One of the consequences of this is the creation of derivative works, such as the Libellus de Nativitate Sanctae Mariae (\\"book of the birth of Saint Mary\\"), which consists of just the early part of the text concerning the birth of Mary. Another text to be based on Pseudo Matthew is the Syriac Infancy Gospel, which includes many supernatural embellishments.

Before joining TUI she cruised as MV Galaxy with Celebrity Cruises, and later as Mein Schiff with TUI Cruises. She was laid down at the Meyer Werft shipyard in Papenburg, Germany, on 25May 1995, was launched in May 1996, and was delivered to Celebrity Cruises on 10October 1996. She entered service on 21December 1996. In 2008, after some twelve years of service as Galaxy, she was renamed Celebrity Galaxy.

She was renamed Mein Schiff () on 15 May 2009, Mein Schiff 1 in November 2010, and Marella Explorer in 2018. Service history =Concept and construction= Marella Explorer as Galaxy in the Meyer Werft shipyard just prior to her maiden voyage. In March 1993 Celebrity Cruises had placed an order with the Meyer Werft shipyard in Papenburg, Germany for a new ship that was eventually delivered as . The contract also included an option for two additional vessels of the same design. Celebrity Cruises decided to utilize the option for additional vessels, but changes to the overall design were made to the subsequent ships compared to the Century. Therefore, the second ship, MV Galaxy, was given a longer hull compared to the Century, and the galley and pantry areas were completely redesigned. The keel of the Galaxy was laid on 25 May 1995, she was launched from drydock in May 1996 and delivered to Celebrity Cruises on 10 October 1996. Following a promotional visit to Southampton, the ship sailed across the Atlantic Ocean without passengers. Further promotional visits in Boston, Philadelphia and Port Canaveral followed, after which the ship sailed to Port Everglades to begin her commercial career with Celebrity Cruises. =Celebrity Cruises= Marella Explorer as Galaxy docked in Key West. Marella Explorer as Celebrity Galaxy docked in Istanbul. Marella Explorer as Galaxy at the Port of Hamburg In 2004. Galaxy entered service with Celebrity Cruises on 21 December 1996 on a week- long cruise from Port Everglades to the Caribbean. Alongside her near-sister ship Century she operated week-long alternating western and eastern Caribbean cruises. During the 1997 northern hemisphere summer season the Galaxy relocated to the west coast of North America to operate week-long cruises to Alaska from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. This pattern was repeated from 1997 up until 2000.Plowman (2006). pp. 231‚Äì235 In 1998, Galaxy was the setting of BBC television's docusoap The Cruise, which made Jane McDonald famous. For the 2001 summer season, Galaxy was replaced by the brand-new in the Alaskan service. As a result, Galaxy was relocated into European waters, cruising the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas. On 2 June 2001, while departing Amsterdam in the Netherlands for a two-week cruise the Galaxy touched bottom on an outskirt of Forteiland at IJmuiden due to heavy northwesterly squalls, resulting in major damage to the port side propeller. The ship returned to the Port of Amsterdam for inspection and disembarkation of the passengers. The cruise had to be cancelled as the Galaxy went into drydock at Blohm + Voss in Hamburg, Germany. There it was discovered that all four blades of the port side propeller would have to be replaced; however the ship only carried two spare blades on board. To solve the problem two extra propeller blades carried on board Galaxys sister ship MV Mercury were flown from the Caribbean to Hamburg and installed on the Galaxy. Following repairs the ship re-entered service on 16 June 2001. For the 2002 and 2003 summer seasons the Galaxy was based in Baltimore, making 10- and 11-day cruises to the Caribbean. On May 21, 2004 the Galaxy berthed at Civitavecchia (Rome) and began its series of summer voyages in the Mediterranean. The Galaxy made multiple transatlantic crossings during the fall and winter seasons to take advantage of the Caribbean's tropical climate.

Following withdrawal from Celebrity Cruises' service, the ship sailed to the Lloyd Werft shipyard in Bremerhaven, Germany where she received a ‚Ç¨ 50 million refit to modernise her facilities and cabins to make her better suited for the needs of the German market. Additional cabins were also fitted on existing outside cabins. Following the 38-day refit the ship was renamed Mein Schiff in Hamburg on 15 May 2009, and she entered service with TUI Cruises on a Baltic Sea cruise starting from Kiel on 23 May 2009. In August 10, 2014, the 76 meter long service supply vessel Princess Marseilles struck the Mein Schiff 1 in the port of Bergen, Norway. The Mein Schiff 1 sustained minimal damage. In the evening of October 12, 2014, around 9 p.m. a fire broke out in the incinerator on deck 3 while the cruise ship was en route from Barcelona to Palma de Mallorca with more than 2000 passengers. The crew was able to extinguish the fire within short time, and the ship docked as scheduled at Palma in the morning of October 13. The message \\"Bravo, Bravo, Bravo, Fire in the Garbage\\" could accidentally be heard from the PA system. Some minutes later the master Rolf Johannes Noack notified the passengers about the incident. The show in the Theater had been interrupted until the fire was out. The passengers had remained calm. In May 2015, TUI Group announced that as part of their modernization strategy, TUI Cruises' Mein Schiff 1 and Mein Schiff 2 would be transferred to Thomson Cruises over the next few years.

Heat affected zone around a weld In welding, the heat-affected zone (HAZ) is the area of base material, either a metal or a thermoplastic, which is not melted but has had its microstructure and properties altered by welding or heat intensive cutting operations. The heat from the welding process and subsequent re-cooling causes this change from the weld interface to the termination of the sensitizing temperature in the base metal. The extent and magnitude of property change depends primarily on the base material, the weld filler metal, and the amount and concentration of heat input by the welding process. The thermal diffusivity of the base material plays a large roleif the diffusivity is high, the material cooling rate is high and the HAZ is relatively small. Alternatively, a low diffusivity leads to slower cooling and a larger HAZ. The amount of heat input during the welding process also plays an important role as well, as processes like oxyfuel welding use high heat input and increase the size of the HAZ. Processes like laser beam welding and electron beam welding give a highly concentrated, limited amount of heat, resulting in a small HAZ. Arc welding falls between these two extremes, with the individual processes varying somewhat in heat input. To calculate the heat input for arc welding procedures, the following formula is used: :Q = \\\\left(\\\\frac{V \\\\times I \\\\times 60}{S \\\\times 1000} \\\\right) \\\\times \\\\mathrm{Efficiency} where Q = heat input (kJ/mm), V = voltage (V), I = current (A), and S = welding speed (mm/min). The efficiency is dependent on the welding process used, with gas tungsten arc welding having a value of 0.6, shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding having a value of 0.8, and submerged arc welding 1.0.https://www.twi- global.com/technical-knowledge/faqs/faq-what-is-the-difference-between-heat- input-and-arc-energy ReferencesWeman, Klas (2003).

Shearer was a craftsman and the author of most of the plates in The Cabinet Maker's London Book of Prices and Designs of Cabinet Work, issued in 1788 \\"for the London Society of Cabinet Makers.\\" The majority of these plates were republished separately as Designs for Household Furniture. They exhibit their author as a man with an eye at once for simplicity of design and delicacy of proportion. Indeed, some of his pieces possess a dainty and slender elegance which has never been surpassed in the history of English furniture. There can be little doubt that Shearer exercised considerable influence over George Hepplewhite, with whom there is reason to suppose that he was closely associated, while Thomas Sheraton has recorded his admiration for work which has often been attributed to others. Shearer, in his turn, owes something to the Adam brothers, and something, no doubt, to the stock designs of his predecessors. There is every reason to suppose that he worked at his craft with his own hands and that he was literally a cabinet-maker‚Äîso far as we know, he never made chairs. Much of the elegance of Shearer's work is due to his graceful and reticent employment of inlays of satinwood and other foreign woods. But he was as successful in form as in decoration, and no man ever used the curve to better purpose. In Shearer's time the sideboard was in process of evolution; previously it had been a table with drawers, the pedestals and knife-boxes being separate pieces. He would seem to have been first to combine them into the familiar and often beautiful form they took at the end of the 18th century. The combination may have been made before, but his plate is, in point of time, the first published document to show it. Shearer, like many of his contemporaries, was much given to devising \\"harlequin\\" furniture. He was a designer of high merit and real originality, and occupies a distinguished place among the little band of men, often, like himself, ill-educated and obscure of origin, who raised the English cabinet-making of the second half of the 18th century to an illustrious place in artistic history.

Normally seen clothed in white, Lachesis is the measurer of the thread spun on Clotho's spindle, and in some texts, determines Destiny, or thread of life. Her Roman equivalent was Decima. Lachesis was the apportioner, deciding how much time for life was to be allowed for each person or being.Hamilton, Edith (1942). Mythology, p. 49. Little, Brown and Company, Boston. She measured the thread of life with her rod. She is also said to choose a person's destiny after a thread was measured. In mythology, it is said that she appears with her sisters within three days of a baby's birth to decide its fate.

Since 2012, Ford Philippines imports the vehicles it sells to the Philippine market. These imports come mostly from Thailand and the United States. History Ford's history in the Philippines can be traced back to 1913 with the local assembly of the Ford Model T. In 1929, Henry Ford established Pilipinas Ford Car Works, Inc. (PFCW). In 1967, Ford Philippines, Inc. (FPI) was established as a subsidiary of the Ford Motor Company and began production operations on May 3, 1968, located at Sucat, Para√±aque. In 1976, FPI inaugurated a body stamping plant in Mariveles, Bataan. On March 20, 1984, FPI formally and unexpectedly announced it would cease its operations in the Philippines by August 1984, in accordance with a decision reached by the management of Ford Motor Company. In 1997, Ford returned to the Philippines with the establishment of Ford Motor Company Philippines, Inc. (FMCPI), introducing US-made vehicles such as the Expedition, the F-150, the Clubwagon and the Lincoln Town Car. A new P4 Billion state-of-the-art assembly plant in Santa Rosa, Laguna opened in September 1999. The first car manufactured at the plant was the Ford Lynx, and the company began building the Mazda-based Ford Ranger in March 2000.

Founded in collaboration with the United Nations Association of the United States of America, it was the first school of international relations to be founded after the Cold War. The school offers both undergraduate and graduate programs. The School of Diplomacy and International Relations is an affiliate member of the Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs. History The school was founded in 1997, and welcomed its first class in the Fall of 1998. Among the founding members was its first dean, Ambassador Clay Constantinou, a former U.S. diplomat and graduate of Seton Hall Law. The school was later named in honor of retired Goldman Sachs executive and philanthropist John C. Whitehead, who served as deputy secretary of state under President Ronald Reagan from 1985‚Äì89; Whitehead also headed the United Nations Association of the United States of America and was the Chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. As the first school of international relations in the post‚ÄìCold War era, the Whitehead School was founded with a need to ‚Äúprepare the next generation of global leaders.‚Äù The School's founding was supported by the United Nations Association of the United States of America, with which it still enjoys a close relationship. Its close proximity to New York City has also historically allowed its students and faculty to participate in U.N.-sponsored functions. Consequently, students from the school often interact with U.N. diplomats. The alliance with UNA-USA has also afforded students opportunities to receive internships and employment with various organizations of the U.N. In June 2013, it was announced that John C. Whitehead asked for his name to be removed from the school. Dr. Andrea Bartoli, an international conflict resolution expert who has served in academic and diplomatic positions for more than two decades, joined the School as Dean in July 2013. Under his leadership the School launched three new academic and research centers in the spring of 2014: The Center for United Nations and Global Governance Studies, The Center for Peace and Conflict Studies, and The Center for Emerging Powers and Transnational Trends. These new centers are in addition to the Center for Global Health Studies. Degree programs The School offers both undergraduate and graduate degrees, a Bachelor of Science and Master of Arts in Diplomacy and International Relations, as well as an Executive M.S. in International Affairs, available in on-campus, online, and hybrid formats. It also offers Graduate Certificates in Post-Conflict State Reconstruction and Sustainability (online), United Nations Studies, Global Health Management, and Global Studies for both working professionals as well as matriculated graduate students, and a United Nations Intensive Summer Study Program for graduate students, advanced undergraduates and working professionals. The UN program may be taken as a three credit course for credit or not for credit. In addition to its formal academic programs, the school is often a venue for professional workshops and conferences. =Undergraduate= The undergraduate program, working toward a Bachelor of Science degree, is an intensive program which includes 120 total credits, 45 of which are Diplomacy specific coursework. Students take a wide range of courses in international relations, history, economics, and law. In addition, there is an eighteen-credit foreign language requirement which usually leads to the completion of a minor. As part of the curriculum, all undergraduate students complete at least one internship for academic credit. A five year B.S./M.A. program is offered for students who wish to complete a master's degree in an accelerated time frame. A six year B.S./J.D. program prepares students for both an undergraduate degree in International Relations and a law degree. =Graduate= Students enrolled in the M.A. program participate in a two-year program that culminates with either a research project or a thesis. Degree requirements include the completion of an academic internship and at least two of thirteen different specializations. Students choose between functional fields of study such as: *International Economics and Development, *Foreign Policy Analysis, *International Law and Human Rights, *International Organizations, *Global Negotiation and Conflict Management, *Global Health and Human Security, *International security, *Post- Conflict State Reconstruction and Sustainability Regional specializations include: *Africa *Asia *Europe *Latin America and the Caribbean *Middle East Students can also design their own fields of study. Each specialization consists of three or four different courses. All students have to satisfactorily complete 45 credits. In addition, with the school's emphasis on building a strong economics background, all students have to complete a series of courses in economics. To complement the M.A. degree, the School also offers several dual-degree programs in collaboration with other academic units of the university. These include: * M.A./J.D. with the Seton Hall University Law School * M.A./M.B.A. with the Stillman School of Business * M.A./M.P.A. with the College of Arts and Sciences's Political Science department * M.A./M.A. in Asian Studies with the College of Arts and Sciences's Asian Studies department * M.A./M.A. in Strategic Communication with the Seton Hall University College of Communication and the Arts In addition to these programs, the School also offers a ten course Executive M.S. in International Affairs for mid-career professionals, available in on-campus, online, and hybrid formats. Graduate Certificates are offered in Post-Conflict State Reconstruction and Sustainability (online), United Nations Studies, Global Health Management, and Global Studies.  Experiential Learning Programs  Internships are an integral part of the School as they allow students to get first-hand experience working in the international relations field and to apply what they learned in their classes to current events. Undergraduate students are required to complete at least two internships and graduate students are required to complete at least one internship prior to graduating. Students at the School have interned at ABC News, American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International, BBC, Caritas Internationalis, Council on Foreign Relations, Doctors Without Borders, Human Rights Watch, International Rescue Committee, Interpol, New York Times, U.S. Fund for UNICEF, U.S. Department of State, various missions to the United Nations, and at the offices of mayors, congressmen and women, and senators. Both undergraduate and graduate students have the opportunity to spend a semester in Washington, D.C. as part of the School's collaboration with the United Nations Foundation. While there, they take seminar-style classes and examine the causes, consequences and possible solutions to today's global policy challenges. Students are placed in competitive Washington, D.C. based internships while maintaining their financial aid and full-time student status. The School also offers study seminars in China, Cyprus, Ethiopia, and Kosovo. Each trip offers an intensive study of international affairs where students see international relations theory and practice come together. In these courses, students are immersed in political, social, economic and cultural issues as a diplomatic delegation.

Parkes, Laurie MacDonald and Lloyd Phillips, with music by James Horner, and written by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. It is the sequel to 1998's The Mask of Zorro; Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones reprise their roles as the titular hero and his spouse, Elena, and Rufus Sewell stars as the villain, Count Armand. The film takes place in San Mateo County, California and was shot in San Luis Potos√≠, Mexico, with second-unit photography in Wellington, New Zealand. The film was theatrically released on October 28, 2005, by Columbia Pictures (instead of TriStar due to Columbia holding the sequel rights to Tristar's pre-1999 film library), and earned $142.4 million on a $75 million budget. Plot In 1850, nine years after the events of the first film, California is voting on whether to join the United States of America as a state. Alejandro Murrieta/Zorro, now known as Don Alejandro De La Vega, foils a plot to steal the ballots, but during the fight with a gunman named Jacob McGivens, he briefly loses his mask. A pair of Pinkerton agents sees his face and recognize him. The following day, the Pinkertons confront Alejandro's wife, Elena, and blackmail her into divorcing him. Three months later, the separation from Elena and his son Joaquin, and the feeling that the people no longer need Zorro, are taking its toll on Alejandro. His childhood guardian, Father Felipe, convinces him to attend a party at French Count Armand's new vineyard. There, Alejandro discovers that Elena is dating the count, an admirer from her time spent in Europe. After leaving the party, Alejandro witnesses a huge explosion close to Armand's mansion and becomes suspicious of him. McGivens leads an attack on the family of Guillermo Cortez, Alejandro's friend, to seize their land deed. Donning his mask again, Zorro rescues Guillermo's wife and son, but fails to save Guillermo and the deed. Zorro follows McGivens to Armand's mansion and discovers that Armand plans to build a railroad on Cortez's land. He also encounters Elena and, learning of an upcoming shipment, he tracks McGivens to a cove where the cargo is delivered. Unbeknownst to him, Joaquin also hitched a ride on McGiven's cart, having sneaked out of a class trip. Zorro saves his son from the bandits and, examing the shipment, he sees a piece of the cargo - a bar of soap - and the name Orbis Unum on a crate lid. Upon researching the phrase, Felipe and Alejandro learn that Armand is the head of a secret society, the Knights of Aragon, which has been secretly ruling Europe. The United States is deemed a threat to the Knights, so they plan to throw the country into chaos before it can gain too much power. Alejandro is captured by the Pinkertons, who reveal that they forced Elena to divorce Alejandro in order to get close to Armand and learn of his plans without the aid of Zorro, as they dislike Zorro and his vigilante ways. Joaquin frees Alejandro from captivity. Zorro goes to Armand's mansion, meets Elena, and eavesdrops on Armand's meeting. He learns that the soap bars are secretly used as an ingredient for nitroglycerin, which Armand plans to distribute throughout the Confederate army, with the help of Confederate Colonel Beauregard, to destroy the Union. Zorro and Elena reconcile, and Zorro prepares to destroy the train carrying the explosives. McGivens arrives at Felipe's church to look for Zorro. Unable to find him, McGivens shoots the priest and kidnaps Joaquin. Meanwhile, however, Armand's butler Ferroq tracks down and kills the Pinkertons and informs his master about Elena's deception. Armand confronts Elena, and takes her and Joaquin hostage on the train carrying the explosives, making Zorro unable to destroy it. Zorro is captured and unmasked in front of his son. Armand takes Joaquin and Elena away and orders McGivens to kill Alejandro. Felipe, having been saved from McGivens's bullet by the cross he wears, arrives, and he and Alejandro overpower and kill McGivens. Zorro catches up with Armand, and they engage in a sword fight. Meanwhile, Elena has Joaquin escape into the back cars of the train, which she disconnects. Elena fights Ferroq in the nitro storage car and throws him and a bottle of nitro out of the car and at the feet of Colonel Beauregard at their prearranged meeting point, killing them. Further along the tracks, the governor prepares to sign the bill to make California a Union state. Joaquin collects Tornado, Zorro's horse, jumps off the train, and overtakes it. He hits a track switch, causing the train to harmlessly pass around the ceremony. Zorro and Armand's duel takes them to the very front of the train engine. Seeing the track is a dead end, Zorro hooks Armand to the train by tying him up on the front of the engine and escapes with Elena. The train crashes into the pile of rails at the end of the track, setting off the nitroglycerin, killing Armand and destroying the train. With Zorro as an official witness, the governor signs the bill, and California becomes the 31st state of the United States of America. Felipe remarries Alejandro and Elena, and Alejandro apologizes to his son for hiding his identity, admitting that Zorro's identity is a family secret rather than just his own. With Elena's support, Zorro rides off on Tornado to his next mission. Cast Antonio Banderas as Don Alejandro de la Vega / Zorro * Catherine Zeta-Jones as El√©na de la Vega * Rufus Sewell as Count Armand * Nick Chinlund as Jacob McGivens * Adri√°n Alonso as Joaquin de la Vega * Julio Oscar Mechoso as Padre Felipe * Shuler Hensley as Pike * Michael Emerson as Harrigan * Leo Burmester as Colonel Beauregard * Tony Amendola as Padre Quintero * Pedro Armend√°riz, Jr. as Governor Riley * Giovanna Zacarias as Blanca Cortez * Ra√∫l M√©ndez as Ferroq * Alberto Reyes as Padre Ignacio Alternate ending An alternate ending, included on the DVD, shows a grown-up Joaquin putting on the costume and riding off into the sunset, following his father's and maternal grandfather Diego de la Vega's (portrayed by Anthony Hopkins in The Mask of Zorro) footsteps as Zorro, while the elderly Alejandro and Elena watch proudly. This was changed to the theatrical ending in order to allow for future sequels with Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones, something that never happened. Historical references The fictional Bear Point, as seen in the film. The Legend of Zorro continues its predecessor's inclusion of Spanish historical elements of California history into the fiction, though many liberties have been taken. Alejandro, the Mexican-born Californian who became Zorro at the end of The Mask of Zorro, is a fictional brother to Joaquin Murrieta, for whom the character's son Joaquin is named. Military governor Bennet Riley, the last of California's heads of state prior to statehood, is portrayed, but the Maryland-born American is played by the Mexican actor Pedro Armend√°riz Jr. who speaks English with a Hispanic accent. Leo Burmester plays R. S. Beauregard, a Confederate colonel whose character is not to be confused with the historical P. G. T. Beauregard. Pedro Mira plays a pre-Presidential Abraham Lincoln as an observer to California's statehood, though the real Lincoln never traveled to the region. The film also features a fictional monument called Bear Point, commemorating the site where the original Bear Flag of the California Republic flew briefly in 1846. Although the actual flag flew in Sonoma County, the film suggests that Bear Point is located in San Mateo County. The Legend of Zorro, which takes place in 1850, includes a significant number of deviations from national history as well, particularly in depicting an organized Confederate States of America and a presumed completed First Transcontinental Railroad, each more than a decade before their times. Additional deviations include a quote from the Gettysburg Address, which would not be written until 1863. A map discovered by Zorro delineates two states (Arizona and New Mexico) that did not achieve statehood until 1912; several other states depicted on the map entered into the Union long after California. The film also features characters who identify themselves as agents of the Pinkerton Detective Agency, which had been established in the year 1850 but was known at the time as the North-Western Police Agency. A deleted scene on the film's DVD features a short discussion on a magic lantern presentation. The use of the Henry repeating rifle by Jacob McGivens is a mistake, it was introduced in the early 1860s and produced through 1866. Music ;Track listing Reception The film currently holds a rating of 47 out of 100 on Metacritic, and a 26% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with its consensus stating, \\"Zorro can survive a lot of things, but it looks like he can't survive marriage\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a below-average review, awarding it one and a half out of four stars, commenting that \\"of all of the possible ideas about how to handle the Elena character, this movie has assembled the worst ones.\\" James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave The Legend of Zorro two out of four stars, saying that \\"the action is routine\\", \\"the chemistry between the two leads, which was one of the highlights of The Mask of Zorro, has evaporated during the intervening years\\", and that the movie \\"fails to recapture the pleasure offered by The Mask of Zorro.\\" Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com praised the film, calling it \\"entertaining, bold, and self-effacing at once\\", noting the civic and parental questions it raises. Slate Magazine critic David Edelstein also praised the film, in particular the action scenes, villains, and chemistry between Banderas and Zeta-Jones. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said the film was \\"watchable ‚Äì not remotely enjoyable, but watchable.\\" Nathan Rabin of The Onions A.V. Club gave the film a lukewarm review, saying that \\"director Martin Campbell doles out action sequences stingily\\", and added that \\"The Legend of Zorro still feels like a half-hearted shrug of a sequel.\\" Brian Lowry of Variety said that The Legend of Zorro is \\"considerably less charming than The Mask of Zorro\\", but added that the film \\"gets by mostly on dazzling stunt work and the pleasure of seeing its dashing and glamorous leads back in cape and gown.\\" Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly awarded the film a \\"B-\\" score. Schwarzbaum said that \\"too many scenes emphasize gross butchery over the elegance of the blade\\", but added that the film is \\"well-oiled\\" and praised the \\"fancy fight sequences\\". Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post reacted negatively, calling The Legend of Zorro \\"a waste of talent, time, and money\\" and \\"stupid and boring\\". Marc Savlov of the Austin Chronicle was also not impressed, remarking that \\"there are precious few things for a Zorro fan ‚Äì or a film fan, for that matter ‚Äì not to loathe about The Legend of Zorro.\\" The film did reasonably well at the box office, grossing $142,400,065 internationally, but did not match the success of its predecessor. Home media The film was released on DVD and VHS on January 31, 2006. It was later released on Blu-ray on December 11, 2007. Potential crossover sequel A comic book adaptation of the Quentin Tarantino film Django Unchained was released by DC Comics in 2013. In 2015, a sequel crossover comic entitled Django/Zorro was released by Dynamite Entertainment, written by Tarantino, the latter being the first comic book sequel to a Tarantino film. In June 2019, Tarantino had picked Jerrod Carmichael to co-write a film adaptation based on the Django/Zorro crossover comic book series. Tarantino and Jamie Foxx have both expressed interest in having Antonio Banderas reprise his role as Zorro from The Mask of Zorro and The Legend of Zorro in the film in addition to Foxx himself reprising his role as Django Freeman.

The modern canon of scripture does not record Mary's birth. The earliest known account of Mary's birth is found in the Protoevangelium of James (5:2), an apocryphal text from the late second century, with her parents known as Saint Anne and Saint Joachim. In the case of saints, the Church commemorates their date of death, with Saint John the Baptist and the Virgin Mary as the few whose birth dates are commemorated. The reason for this is found in the singular mission each had in salvation history, but traditionally also because these alone were holy in their very birth (for Mary, see Immaculate Conception; John was sanctified in Saint Elizabeth's womb according to the traditional interpretation of ). Devotion to the innocence of Mary under this Marian title is widely celebrated in many cultures across globe.  Popular  Marymas Procession in Mangalore, India The Infant Mary wrapped in swaddling clothes. Museum of Valenzuela City, Philippines . The \\"Protoevangelium of James\\", which was probably put into its final written form in the early second century, describes Mary's father Joachim as a wealthy member of one of the Twelve Tribes of Israel. He and his wife Anne were deeply grieved by their childlessness. Pious accounts place the birthplace of the Virgin Mary in Sepphoris, Israel where a 5th-century basilica is excavated at the site. Some accounts speak of Nazareth and others say it was in a house near the Sheep Gate in Jerusalem. It is possible that a wealthy man such as Joachim had a home in both Judea and Galilee. However, Charles Souvay, writing in the Catholic Encyclopedia, says that the idea that Joachim possessed large herds and flocks cannot be asserted with certainty, as the sources for this are \\"...of very doubtful value....\\".  Feast day  Tradition celebrates Marymas as a liturgical feast in the General Roman Calendar and in most Anglican liturgical calendars on 8 September, nine months after the solemnity of her Immaculate Conception, celebrated on 8 December. The feast is also included in the Tridentine Calendar for 8 September. This date is also used in the Western Rite Orthodox Church. Previous to the reforms by Pope Pius XII, the General Roman Calendar of 1954 kept the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary as an Octave since the Octave was established by Pope Innocent IV in 1243. Holweck, F. (1911). Feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In The Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Retrieved September 9, 2020 from New Advent The Byzantine Rite Orthodox likewise celebrate the Nativity of the Theotokos on 8 September. The Syriac Orthodox Church, like its closely related sister church, the Byzantine Rite Antiochian Orthodox Church, also celebrates the feast on 8 September. For churches using the old Julian Calendar for liturgical purposes September 8 falls on September 21 of the Gregorian Calendar. In other words, \\"Old Calendar\\" Churches, such as the Russian Orthodox Church, still celebrate the Nativity of the Theotokos on the 8th, but the day is actually the 21st according to the everyday calendar used by society at large. The Armenian Apostolic Church also uses the traditional date of 8 September. Yet the Coptic Orthodox and Ethiopian Orthodox Christians celebrate it on May 9 (1 Bashans, EC 1 Ginbot). =History= 12-century German Nativity of Mary with her father, Joachim wearing a Jewish hat The earliest document commemorating Marymas comes from a hymn written in the sixth century. The feast may have originated somewhere in Syria or Palestine in the beginning of the sixth century, when after the Council of Ephesus, the cult of the Mother of God was greatly intensified, especially in Syria. The first liturgical commemoration is connected with the sixth century dedication of the Basilica Sanctae Mariae ubi nata est, now called the Church of St. Anne in Jerusalem. The original church built, in the fifth century, was a Marian basilica erected on the spot known as the shepherd's pool and thought to have been the home of Mary's parents. In the seventh century, the feast was celebrated by the Byzantines as the feast of the Birth of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Since the story of Mary's Nativity is known only from apocryphal sources, the Latin Church was slower in adopting this festival. At Rome the Feast began to be kept toward the end of the 7th century, brought there by Eastern monks. =Legends= The church of Angers in France claims that St. Maurilius instituted this feast at Angers in consequence of a revelation about 430. On the night of 8 September, a man heard the angels singing in heaven, and on asking the reason, they told him they were rejoicing because the Virgin was born on that night; but this tradition is not substantiated by historical proofs. =Customs= France In France, Marymas is known as \\"Our Lady of the Grape Harvest\\" among the winegrowers. The best grapes are brought to the local church to be blessed and then some bunches are attached to the hands of the statue of Mary. A festive meal that includes the new grapes is part of this day. India Marymas celebration by Roman Catholic believers in Pune, Maharashtra In Kerala, the feast of Mary's Nativity, called Nalpiravi (‡¥®‡µΩ‚Äå‡¥™‡¥ø‡¥±‡¥µ‡¥ø), is a major celebration among Saint Thomas Christians and is always celebrated as an octave. An eight-day abstinence (Ettu Nombu) of meat and alcohol is observed from September 1 through 8. During this period, vegetarian food is prepared in all families of Saint Thomas Christian and churches organize charitable activities, evangelical conventions and special prayers to honor Virgin Mary. Praying Kontha (The Holy Rosary) in groups is an important custom during these days. On the day of Marymas, a ceremonial pudding called Pachoru (‡¥™‡¥æ‡¥ö‡µç‡¥ö‡µã‡¥±‡µç) which is made using milk, rice and jaggery is prepared in churches and distributed to the devotees in the afternoon as part of the feast celebration. In houses, Theenmura (a festive meal including meat and fish dishes) is prepared. In Goa, the feast of Mary's Nativity, called the Monti Fest, is a major family celebration, serving as a thanksgiving festival blessing the harvest of new crops, and observed with a festive lunch centered on the blessed grain of the harvest. Showering flowers on idol of Virgin Mary is an important custom in Konkan region. In Mangalore it is the feast of Mary's Nativity, called the \\"Monthi Fest\\". On this day every Mangalorean Christian eats pulses and vegetables. The priest blesses a branch of grain which is added to food. Before the feast on 8 September there are nine days of novena followed by the throwing of flowers on baby Mary's statue.  In Catholic iconography  Holy card depicting the birth of the Blessed Virgin Mary. University of Dayton Libraries. Nativity of Mary, Spain, 17th century. The scene was frequently depicted in art, as part of cycles of the Life of the Virgin. Medieval depictions of Mary in infancy often include her birth by Saint Anne. In late medieval depictions the setting was often in a wealthy household. In 1730, devotion to Mary in her first infancy among the Franciscan nuns in Lovere, Italy, where a wax statue of the Santissima Maria Bambina was venerated and later brought to Milan under the care of Sisters of Charity. In Southern France, the devotion penetrated into the bride gift wedding custom of Globe de Mari√®e, where the baby Mary is placed on the cushion, representing children and fertility as one of the ideal wishes of a newlywed bride. A similar devotion showcasing the toddler years of Mary began to develop, mainly in former Spanish territories such as Mexico, Guatemala and the Philippines, where the La Ni√±a Mar√≠a is portrayed as a prepubescent girl. In 19th-century Mexico, the Conceptionists nun Sister Magdalena endorsed a devotion to the infant Virgin, using the Cabeza or head of a cherub angel from a damaged monstrance to create a Santo image. Later, Marian visionary, Rosario Arrevillaga, began a religious order devoted to the same Marian title called the Order of the Slaves of the Immaculate Child. Pope Benedict XV recognised the Marian image in Senglea, Malta under the title of Maria Bambina honouring the nativity of the Virgin Mary, granting the decree of its canonical coronation on 1 May 1920, subsequently crowned by Archbishop Mauro Caruana on 4 September 1921. The image which once adorned a Catholic galleon was shipwrecked in 1618 near the Dalmatian islands and was rescued to the present town, which also celebrates its feast on September 8. In the Philippines, pious Catholics adopted the same devotion to the toddler Virgin, dressing her in pastel colours and crowning her with flowers to emphasise her virginity and innocence, as opposed to the traditional diadem reserved for images of adult saints. Similar to Hispanic traditions, candies and cakes are popularly offered in the infant Virgin's honour, emphasizing her honorific title as La Dulce Mar√≠a or the Sweet Mary. On 27 December 2018, the House of Representatives of the Philippines officially approved bill #7856, in honor of the Virgin Mary's birthday for September 8 as a working holiday. On August 13, 2019, President Rodrigo Duterte has signed Republic Act 11370, a law declaring September 8 a special working holiday in the entire country to commemorate the Feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Though unrelated, certain places with Marian devotion juxtapose the Feast of Mary's birthdate with their own respective localised images such as the following: * Cuba ‚Äî Our Lady of Charity * Philippines ‚Äî Virgen de los Remedios de Pampanga * Philippines - Nuestra Se√±ora de la Natividad de Pangil * India ‚Äî Our Lady of Good Health * Malta ‚Äî Our Lady of Victories Commemorations =Roman Catholic= The Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary Cathedral is located in Biloxi, Mississippi. There is also a Cathedral of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Juneau, Alaska. The Nativity of Mary, Blessed Virgin Catholic Church in High Hill, Texas is a historic church built in 1906. The Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary Parish in Lorain, Ohio was founded in 1898 to serve the Polish-American community. Nativity of Mary Catholic Church and School is located in Bloomington, Minnesota and is part of the Archdiocese of Saint Paul-Minneapolis. =Orthodox Church= The Nativity of the Virgin Mary Orthodox Church in Madison, Illinois is part of the Orthodox Church in America Diocese of the Midwest. The Nativity of the Theotokos Monastery in Saxonburg, Pennsylvania, north of Pittsburgh, is the first Greek Orthodox women's monastery in America, founded in 1989.  In Islamic scripture  The birth of Mary is narrated in the third sura (chapter) of the Qur'an with references to her father Imran, after whom the chapter is named, as well as her mother, Hannah. Hannah prayed to God to fulfil her desire to have a child and vowed, if her prayer was accepted, that her child (whom she initially thought would be male) would be dedicated to the service of God (a direct parallel to the Old Testament Hannah, whose mothering of the judge and prophet Samuel followed an identical storyline). She prayed for her child to remain protected from Satan (Shay·π≠ƒÅn) and Muslim tradition records a hadith, which states that the only children born without the \\"touch of Satan\\", were Mary and Jesus. Our Lady of Victories On the Maltese Islands, the feast of Marymas is also referred to as the Feast of Our Lady of Victories (Maltese: Il-Festa tal- Vitorja) owing to its coinciding with several important events in Maltese history. Such is the importance of this feast (both religious and historical), that September 8 is a national holiday referred to by many names, mainly Victory Day, il-Vitorja and il-Bambina (a shortening of Marija Bambina).

The association's goals include building a real tennis court and functioning as the national governing body. Since 1987 the association has organized a Dutch Real Tennis Championship tournament at various clubs in the United Kingdom. The Real Tennis Club Huis ter Kleef (formerly \\"Real Tennis Club Wassenaar\\"), founded on November 20, 2001, is a private club of enthusiasts who are currently attempting to restore and operate the Kaatsbaan (real tennis court) at the castle Huis ter Kleef. The court was built around 1560 by Hendrik van Brederode, and tennis was played there likely until the early 17th century.

He was listed in American Men of Science and Who's Who in America. During his 36 years in government service, he often was called upon to provide his beetle expertise to the Smithsonian Institution and entomological organizations in the United States and elsewhere. He once provided entomological advice to writer John Steinbeck and found himself quoted on the subject of killer bees in the opening of Arthur Herzog's best-selling novel \\"The Swarm\\". Work Ramsay was widely known for his research on a potato cyst eelworm  the parasitic golden nematode (Globodera rostochiensis). The worm was discovered in 1941 in potato fields on Long Island, New York, the only state where it has established a foothold. Around 1946, the worm was found on a lily of the valley plants imported from the Netherlands. Ramsay helped trace the worm to infested flower fields in Germany that had been converted for potato cultivation during World War II. Inspectors from the Department of Agriculture began testing cargoes of lilies in Hamburg, which initially slowed the golden nematode's spread from across the Atlantic. The Golden Nematode Act was enacted on June 15, 1948, to combat the worm. As of 2003, the golden nematode is one of 22 federally regulated organisms in the United States. According to Society of Nematologists, \\"he played an instrumental role in reducing the spread of Globodera rostochiensis in the United States.\\" He also studied Dutch elm disease, termite infestations in Puerto Rico, and Mexican bean beetles in New York State, and helped develop methods for estimating losses from the parasites. He later trained inspectors from Japan, El Salvador, Jordan, and Indonesia in an effort to identify infested crops before they reached American shores. When those crops were found, agriculture officials usually ordered the cargoes dumped at sea and the ships fumigated. Raymond F. Bednar, a former director of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) in New York, recalled that Ramsay \\"always saw the new pest coming down the pike.\\" Life Ramsay was born and raised in Buffalo by his mother Lillian Maynard and father William \\"Dowie\\" Ramsay, a conductor and brakeman for the Nickel Plate Road. Ramsay studied under Albert R. Shadle and graduated from the University at Buffalo with a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology. Continuing his education at Cornell University, Ramsay graduated with a Master of Science degree in Mammalogy. While living in Staten Island, Ramsay was awarded a Ph.D. in Entomology from Cornell in 1941, and gained employment with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Ramsay was one of the first few Ph.D. holders in service to the Department, and thus, colleagues bestowed him with the nickname \\"Doc\\". Encouraged by Shadle, \\"Doc\\" Ramsay then married Alberta June Wentworth, a beautician and owner of Alberta's Beauty Shop, from Canisteo. From 1950 to 1956, he served as a port entomologist, and then in 1967 was appointed to APHIS. He retired in 1977. Dr. Ramsay was also a former president of the Insecticide Society of Washington. Alberta Ramsay died in 2003. Two years later, Maynard Ramsay died of pneumonia on March 20, 2005, in a Silver Spring nursing home. The couple resided in Bowie, Maryland.

It is unique among Infocom titles for not being interactive fiction and for being the first to incorporate graphics beyond ASCII characters. Like most Infocom titles, it was written in highly portable ZIL, but was only made available for the Apple II, IBM PC, and the Atari 8-bit family. It was not ported to the most popular home computer of the time, the Commodore 64. Gameplay Infocom marketed Fooblitzky as a \\"Graphic Strategy Game\\", and gameplay was compared to that of Clue and Mastermind. Two to four players travel around the virtual city of Fooblitzky, spending \\"foobles\\" and attempt to deduce what four objects are needed to win the game (and then obtain them). Players purchase objects in stores and can visit City Hall to have their possessions evaluated. Much in the same style as Mastermind, the player is told how many of their objects are correct, but not which ones. Feelies Each box contained four sets of laminated game boards and erasable markers which could be used to track the progress of a game. Two sets of documentation were also included: a set of \\"quick-start\\" guidelines (\\"The Bare Essentials\\") and a more detailed set (\\"Official Ordinances\\"). Reception As a test, for the first six months Fooblitzky was only advertised to those on Infocom's mailing list, although others could order it from the company. It sold very poorly; Infocom sold only 8,225 copies through 1986, the fewest of the five titles introduced in 1985, and from 1987 to 1989 the number of copies returned exceeded those sold. Computer Gaming World called Fooblitzky \\"a fun way to spend time with a few friends\\", stating that the advertising comparing it to Mastermind and Clue was correct. It noted that the game began as an Infocom project to see if graphical games could be written for easy porting between computers like the company's text adventures, and criticized the Atari version's resulting graphics as \\"jerky and slow\\". COMPUTE! stated \\"probably no game on the computer software market today gives one the feel of playing a board game as much as does Fooblitzky\\", adding that the principles Fooblitzky used were the same ones that made Monopoly popular. Cautioning that because it was so different from other computer games that \\"it probably isn't for everyone's tastes\\", the magazine recommended Fooblitzky for those seeking a game for families to enjoy.

The Gothic revival building is located at 736 Bathurst Street at the intersection with Lennox Street. The theatre is in the former church sanctuary, while the 100-seat Annex Theatre is in an adjoining building at 730 Bathurst Street. Oscar Peterson, Jim Carrey, Gordon Pinsent, Ted Dykstra, Eddie Izzard, Martin Bragg and the Toronto Theatre Fringe Festival are just some of the individuals and companies who have graced the stages and studios of 736 Bathurst Street. The Gothic revival building is a landmark, not only in the history of Toronto but also the heritage of theatre in Canada. Beautiful and functional, the building was profiled in 2009 by the Ontario Heritage Trust as a prime example of adaptive reuse of places of worship. In addition, since March 2001, the building has been home to the Randolph College for the Performing Arts, Canada's first Triple Threat(R) training institution for professional performers. History The current building was erected in 1888 by the congregation of the Bathurst Street Wesleyan Methodist Church. The cornerstone was laid by Sir John A. Macdonald, first Prime Minister of Canada. Over the years it inspired many church congregations, eventually becoming the Bathurst Street United Church. In the 1950s, facing a dwindling congregation, the building began to be rented out for concerts and plays. The building became better known as a theatre than a church. In 1985, the building became a permanent and well known theatre. The building was originally home to Bathurst Street Wesleyan Methodist Church. This congregation was an extension of Elm Street WMC, and started in 1860. In 1862, services were being conducted in a cottage on nearby Markham Street, and the area was known as Seaton Village, still outside of the Toronto city limits. After a gift of land on Bathurst Street from the son of John Strachan, the first building on this site was constructed in 1866. Following a congregational split in 1869 (when Primitive Methodists in the area formed their own congregation), this congregation continued to grow and was joined by the former Primitive Methodist congregation in 1884, following the union of Methodists across Canada. The present building (originally known as Bathurst Street Methodist Church) was erected by the congregation in 1888 to meet the demands of the growing population, and the United Methodist presence in Toronto. The building was designed by the architectural firm of Gordon & Helliwell. In 1925, the congregation joined the new United Church of Canada and became Bathurst Street United Church. A minority of Presbyterians from St. Paul's PC (then located north of Bloor) joined, as St Paul's (which merged with Dovercourt Road PC in 1968, Chalmers in 1980, Dufferin Street PC in 1994, and closed in June 2005) remained within the Presbyterian Church in Canada. In the 1950s, as the earlier families emigrated to the suburbs, the congregation shrank. A number of strategies were tried to increase attendance: one of these was the Sunday Evening Forums, wherein the Sunday evening sermon was replaced by a panel discussion on social issues among prominent guests. Running from 1944 to 1951, noted panelists included Tim Buck, who lived nearby. The small congregation had difficulty maintaining the old structure, and they began to rent out the building for concerts and plays. Increasingly, the building became better known for its role as a theatre than for being a church. In 1985, the congregation finally opted to leave the building, and it now meets at nearby Trinity-St. Paul's United Church. The building then became a permanent and well-known theatre. In 2000, the United Church of Canada sold the building to George Randolph Jr. References \\"Theatre needs angel; Parking requirements doom venerable Bathurst unless saviour comes to the rescue\\", Ariel Teplitsky.

The size of the LCD screen makes it difficult to read each feature setting, and over time the LCD screen would lose pixels (which in some cases renders the screen unreadable; this is called \\"display bug\\" by some users). This issue is due to the heat on the LCD screen-PCB board, the lamination between the crystal and the PCB is opening/splitting up from the little heat inside the Roland MC-505 from prolonged use.

Plot Alan Block is a teenage city slicker with his whole summer planned out. That is, until his parents invite Vic over, a charming wilderness survival guide. Vic convinces them that six weeks off the grid is exactly what Alan needs to become a man. Alan reluctantly joins Vic and three other teens ‚Äì‚Äì Chris, Mitch and George ‚Äì‚Äì for a trek into the great outdoors, which turn out to be not so great for him. He is taunted by Chris and George and learns that Vic is deadly serious about his job, but he does form a friendship with Mitch. On their first night, Alan carves his initials into a tree. After Vic finds out, he calls the others to vote on his punishment. They take away his knife. In another incident, the group goes swimming at a nearby river, where Alan and Mitch listen to a ballgame on the radio, but Vic confiscates the radio, declaring they've left all that behind them. Later on, Vic asks Alan to be his bowman while white water rafting. Alan is unprepared and loses an oar. While Vic praises Alan's efforts, Alan feels he was set up to fail. Later, Vic asks the boys to cross a dangerous swing bridge. Alan crosses it with the others but leaves their tent poles behind. When he later realizes this, Vic sends him back to collect them alone. Despite his best efforts, he fails to cross the bridge, when a rope snaps, nearly making him fall. Embarrassed, Alan claims that he could not find them but Vic catches him in his lie; he watched him all along and even retrieved the poles. The tension between Alan and Vic reaches a breaking point when the group go fishing on an island. Instead of following Vic's lead and catching them with his bare hands, Alan invents a fish trap. Furious, Vic tosses the fish he caught and forces him to clean the others‚Äô fish. Alan refuses and Vic leaves with the group, stranding him on the island until the fish are cleaned. Alan stays on the island for the night and does not complete the task. The next morning, Vic sends the others to retrieve him. When they return, they find that Vic has disappeared. The boys fight with each other about what to do and take cover after a storm hits. Out of the blue, Vic returns the next morning and praises their survival skills. Although everyone has grown weary of Vic, they follow him on their next group activity of climbing Devil's Tooth ‚Äì‚Äì a treacherous peak. When they reach a gap, Vic creates a pendulum for the boys to swing over it. Alan is last to go but is the only one who does not make the jump. Despite the others‚Äô protests, and Alan's pleas for help, Vic leaves Alan dangling and instructs him to figure his own way out of it. Chris challenges Vic's leadership and Vic retaliates by holding him over the edge of a cliff. Left to his own devices, Alan mangages to climb out of the gam, and create enough momentum to swing across. When he catches up to the others, everyone is impressed with him, but Alan declares this was the last straw, and the other boys agree, and they demand to end the trip. Vic refuses and the boys set off on their own. They reach the canoes the next day, but Vic catches up to them, and a heated confrontation ensues. Furious, Chris throws rocks at Vic and hits him with an oar ‚Äì‚Äì sending him over the edge of a ravine. After Vic suffers a broken leg and becomes stranded, Alan creates a pulley and the group hoist him out of the ravine. As the group's new leader, Alan instructs the others to follow the river to the ranger station. With Vic stable but losing blood, Alan sits him in a canoe and they raft down a wild river. Alan skillfully navigates the rapids but the canoe capsizes after plunging down a small waterfall. Alan brings Vic to the riverbanks. The two share a moment of camaraderie and, soon enough, a rescue helicopter arrives. An older Alan mentions that the other three boys were rescued as well, and he and Vic made their piece. Also, every summer since, Alan has taken a trip to visit nature... in Central Park! Production and release White Water Summer was originally produced as Rites of Summer in 1985, and given its current name upon release in 1987. The film's action is framed by commentary from the now-older character of Alan (Sean Astin), as he remembers a camping trip led by Vic (Kevin Bacon). The narration was filmed two years after the film itself; Astin is noticeably older. The film was photographed by John Alcott, a frequent collaborator of Stanley Kubrick. Alcott died shortly before the release of the film, which is dedicated to his memory. Scenes were shot in California's Sierra Nevada mountains, as well as in western Quebec, Canada, at the small French Quebec town of Fort-Coulonge, and New Zealand locales. Columbia Pictures released the film theatrically in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States; a wider release was planned, but never carried out.

Pseudoextinction (or phyletic extinction) of a species occurs when all members of the species are extinct, but members of a daughter species remain alive. The term pseudoextinction refers to the evolution of a species into a new form, with the resultant disappearance of the ancestral form. Pseudoextinction results in the relationship between ancestor and descendant still existing even though the ancestor species no longer exists. The classic example is that of the non-avian dinosaurs. While the non-avian dinosaurs of the Mesozoic died out, their descendants, birds, live on today. As of now it is accepted that modern birds evolved from Archaeopteryx, a small dinosaur with flight feathers from the Mesozoic period. Many other families of bird- like dinosaurs also died out as the heirs of the dinosaurs continued to evolve, but because birds continue to thrive in the world today their ancestors are only pseudoextinct. Overview From a taxonomic perspective, pseudoextinction is \\"within an evolutionary lineage, the disappearance of one taxon caused by the appearance of the next.\\" The pseudoextinction of a species can be arbitrary, simply resulting from a change in the naming of a species as it evolves from its ancestral form to its descendant form. Taxonomic pseudoextinction has to do with the disappearance of taxa that are categorized together by taxonomists. As they are just grouped together, their extinction is not reflected through lineage; therefore, unlike evolutionary pseudoextinction, taxonomic pseudoextinction does not alter the evolution of daughter species. From an evolutionary perspective, pseudoextinction entails the loss of a species as a result of the creation of a new one. As the primordial species evolves into its daughter species, either by anagenesis or cladogenesis, the ancestral species can be subject to extinction. Throughout the process of evolution, a taxon can disappear; in this case, pseudoextinction is considered an evolutionary event. From a genetic perspective, pseudoextinction is the \\"disappearance of a taxon by virtue of its being evolved by anagenesis into another taxon.\\" As all species must have an ancestor of a previous species, much of evolution is believed to occur through pseudoextinction. However, it is difficult to prove that any particular fossil species is pseudoextinct unless genetic information has been preserved. For example, it is sometimes claimed that the extinct Hyracotherium (an ancient horse-like animal commonly known as an eohippus) is pseudoextinct, rather than extinct, because several species of horse, including the zebra and the donkey, are extant today. However, it is not known, and probably cannot be known, whether modern horses actually descend from members of the genus Hyracotherium, or whether they simply share a common ancestor. One proposed mechanism of pseudoextinction is endocrine disruption (changing hormone levels). Additionally, when the primary sex-ratio (male to female ratio of a population) is male-biased, predicted levels of pseudoextinction increase. Because the variance of the population size increases with time, the probability of pseudoextinction increases with the length of the time horizon used. Mammal systematist and paleobiologist David Archibald has estimated that as many as 25% of the extinctions recorded in three different early Puercan mammal lineages are pseudoextinctions. Pseudotermination is an extreme form of pseudoextinction, when a lineage continues as a new species; phylogeny is often difficult to determine in such cases. Extirpation or regional disappearance can be a stage in pseudoextinction when progressive diachronous range contraction leads to final extinction by the elimination of the last refuge or population growth from this temporal bottleneck. The notion of pseudoextinction is sometimes applied to wider taxa than species. For instance, the entire superorder Dinosauria, as traditionally conceived, would have to be considered as pseudoextinct, because feathered dinosaurs are considered by the majority of modern palaeontologists as the ancestors of modern-day birds. Pseudoextinction for such higher taxa appears to be easier to prove. However, pseudoextinct higher taxa are paraphyletic groups, which are rejected as formal taxa in phylogenetic nomenclature; either all dinosaurs are stem-group birds, or birds are derived dinosaurs, but there is no taxon Dinosauria, acceptable in cladistic taxonomy, that excludes the taxon Aves. Pseudoextinction cannot be applied to the genus or family levels as, ‚Äúwhen a species evolves to a new form, causing the pseudoextinction of the ancestral form, the new species is normally assigned the same higher taxa as the ancestor.‚Äù When a family or genus goes extinct it must be true extinction, because pseudoextinction would mean that at least one member of the family or genus is still extant. Pseudoextinction is an event that occurs much more frequently under the assumption of a Phyletic gradualism model of evolution, under which speciation is slow, uniform and gradual. The majority of speciation would occur through anagenesis under this model, resulting in a majority of species undergoing Pseudoextinction. However, the model of punctuated equilibrium is more widely accepted, with the proposal that most species remain in stasis, a state of very little evolutionary change, for a large proportion of the species' lifespan. This would result in increased cases of speciation through cladogenesis and true extinction, with fewer cases of Pseudoextinction. Nearly all species undergo true extinction under the model of punctuated equilibrium. Charles Darwin proposed the idea of stasis in his book, On the Origin of Species. He suggested that species spend the majority of their evolutionary lifespan in the same form, having undergone very little morphological or genetic change. Another concept of species on the tree of life is the composite species concept. It sees one species as occupying all internodes of the tree that have the same combination of (morphological, ecological, etc.) characters. Here, a species starts with the acquisition of a character and ends when another change is fixed in its lineage. This process - of one lineage turning into what is afterwards seen as another species because of the fixation of a novel character - is often called anagenesis. But we have a similar situation here where a species is considered to end by definition but is not really extinct (it survived, after all, in the form of one descendent species with a different character combination), and so we could also consider it to be pseudoextinction. On the other hand, under the composite species concept a species continues through a lineage split if only one of the two resulting lineages acquires a new character, an event that is sometimes called speciation through \\"budding\\". The one that has a new character is now a new species but the other lineage, the one that looks identical to the common ancestor, is considered to be the common ancestor. An example would be a widespread breeding group remaining unchanged while \\"budding off\\" a small isolated population that accumulates changes until it cannot interbreed with the others any more.

History Pewex was created in the 1970s to help combat Communist Poland's foreign currency deficit. By the late 1960s, it had become apparent that the then socialist centrally-planned economy of Poland was inefficient. The rule of Edward Gierek led to a short period of economic prosperity. With the aid of foreign loans, Gierek instituted a programme to modernise industry and increase the availability of consumer goods. The standard of living increased markedly and for a time he was hailed a miracle-worker. The economy, however, began to falter during the 1973 oil crisis and by 1976 price increases became necessary, mostly to ease the repayment of these loans. Pekao checks were used in Pewex shops. This is an example of a US$0.02 note.To obtain much needed foreign currency from Polish society, authorities permitted in 1972 the creation of a network of shops under a state-owned bank named Pekao. There, the foreign hard currency could be exchanged for both foreign and domestic goods, many of which were unavailable to Poles at that time. Since ownership of hard currency as cash was forbidden and all dollars and Deutschmarks had to be deposited to dollar bank accounts, authorities introduced Bon PeKaO cheques, which were tied to the U.S. Dollar in a 1:1 ratio and could be used as currency in Pekao shops. Later on the Pekao bank created a separate company, Przedsiƒôbiorstwo Eksportu Wewnƒôtrznego ‚Äì the Pewex. While the letter x is not present in the Polish alphabet, it was used nevertheless. During the Communist era, Poles were allowed to own Dollars, something that was not allowed in other Eastern Bloc states. Many Poles at the time also received remittance from friends and family members in the United States. The US Dollars received by Poles could either be used for foreign travel or used at the Pewex shops. Products that Poles would otherwise have to wait a long time and settle for poor imitations of could be had immediately by buying them at a Pewex shop. Pewex offered a number of items not available for purchase on the normal market. Items were purchased outside of the rationing system then in place, and customers did not have to queue up for items. Items sold include liquor, cigarettes, household appliances, cars and furniture. Shopping at Pewex at the time was seen as a rather exclusive affair, due to the high cost of its items when compared to the average salary at the time. This turned Pewex into a symbol of luxury and privilege. At one point, Pewex had a network of 80 shops in Poland. In 1987, Pewex was noted in a report issued by the United States Joint Publications Research Service to have had a sales volume of about 70 billion z≈Çoty, based on the then-official exchange rate to the US Dollar, with a revenue of 20 billion z≈Çoty. =Post-Communist government= As part of the peaceful transition of the economic system in Poland after 1989's revolution in Poland, the Polish economy was privatised and the ownership of foreign currency was deregulated. This made the Pekao cheques obsolete and soon afterwards most of the goods that had only been available from Pewex stores started to be sold in private shops as well. In 1991, Marian Zacharski, a former Polish spy who was sentenced to life in prison by American authorities for stealing military secrets and was subsequently released in a spy exchange, became the chain's chief. In 1993, Pewex filed for bankruptcy for the first time. In December 1995, it was announced that a debt restructuring deal would see the a bank named Polski Bank Rozwoju, along with two French companies, swap a debt worth 93.6 million z≈Çoty at the time for a majority stake in 1996.

Biography Seume was born in Poserna (now part of L√ºtzen, Saxony-Anhalt). He was educated first at Borna, then at the Nikolai school and University of Leipzig. The study of Shaftesbury and Bolingbroke wakened his interest in theology, and, breaking off his studies, he set out for Paris. On the way he was seized by Hessian recruiting officers and sold to England, whereupon he was drafted to Canada. After his return in 1783 he deserted at Bremen, but was captured and brought to Emden; a second attempt at flight also failed. In 1787, however, a citizen of Emden became surety for him to the amount of 80 talers, and he was allowed to visit his home. He did not return, but paid off his debt in Emden with the remuneration he received for translating an English novel. Spaziergang nach Syrakus im Jahre 1802, 1830-1841 He taught languages for a time in Leipzig, and became tutor to a Graf Igelstrom, whom, in 1792, he accompanied to Warsaw. Here he became secretary to General von Igelstrom, and, as a Russian officer, experienced the terrors of the Polish insurrection (Ko≈õciuszko Uprising). In 1796 he was again in Leipzig and, resigning his Russian commission, entered the employment of the publisher G√∂schen. In December 1801, he set out on his famous nine months' walk to Sicily, described in his Spaziergang nach Syrakus (1803). Some years later he visited Russia, Finland, Sweden and Denmark, a journey which is described in Mein Sommer im Jahr 1805 (1807). His health now began to fail, and he died on 13 June 1810, in Teplitz (now also known as Teplice). His reputation rests on the two books just mentioned, to which may be added his autobiography, Mein Leben (1813, continued by C.A.H. Clodius). These works reflect Seume's sterling character and sturdy patriotism; his style is clear and straightforward; his descriptions realistic and vivid. As a dramatist (Miltiades, 1808), and as a lyric poet (Gedichte, 1801), he had but little success. Seume's Gesammelte Schriften were first edited by J. P. Zimmermann (1823‚Äì1826); his S√§mtliche Werke (1826‚Äì1827) passed through seven editions. The most recent edition (as of 1911) is J. G. Seume's Prosaische und poetische Werke (10 vols, 1879). See Oskar Planer and Camillo Rei√ümann, J. G. Seume. Geschichte seines Lebens und seiner Schriften (1898). Seume and Beethoven Seume died in Teplitz in June 1810. Ludwig van Beethoven spent three weeks in August 1811 and another short period during the summer of 1812 at Teplitz. He is known to have visited Seume's grave, and wrote to a music teacher from Cassel, Georg Christoph Grosheim (1764‚Äì1841), telling him of the feelings of admiration for Seume that that occasion had produced in him. In his letter to Beethoven of 10 November 1819, Grosheim talks of a \\"marriage\\" of Seume's poem \\"Die Beterin\\" (\\"The Pleader\\") with Beethoven's \\"Moonlight\\" Sonata. It is unclear whether this was a reference to an idea that had been previously discussed between the two men, or a new idea of Grosheim's. Thayer also reports that Grosheim had tried to persuade Beethoven to arrange the slow opening movement of the \\"Moonlight\\" Sonata for voice and piano, to the words of Seume's poem Die Beterin. Beethoven is said to have agreed to the idea, but nothing ever came of it.Raptus Association Nevertheless, in the minds of some writers the association between \\"Die Beterin\\" and the sonata came to assume more solidity than it ever had in reality. \\"Die Beterin\\" was also sometimes said to be a painting. In the 1954 edition of Grove's Dictionary of Music, it is specifically denied that the \\"Moonlight\\" Sonata has any connection with \\"a picture, Die Beterin (The Pleader)\\".Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed, 1954, Vol. V, p. 863, \\"Moonlight\\" Sonata Beethoven had two volumes of Seume's works in his possession when he died.Theodore Albrecht, Letters to Beethoven and other correspondence References External links * 1763 births 1810 deaths People from L√ºtzen People from the Electorate of Saxony German male writers Leipzig University alumni People associated with Ludwig van Beethoven ","title":"Johann Gottfried Seume"},{"id":"1830519","text":"Kilbirnie (Gaelic: Cill Bhraonaigh) is a small town 18,829 of(2020) weburl=http://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/ods-web/area.htmltitle=Scotland's Census 2011author=GROSpublisher=Scotlandcensus.gov.ukaccessdate=4 October 2014}} inhabitants situated in the Garnock Valley area of North Ayrshire, on the west coast of Scotland. It is around south-west of Glasgow and approximately from Paisley and Irvine respectively. Historically, the town's main industries were flax production and weaving before iron and steelmaking took over in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The suburb of Kilbirnie in the New Zealand capital of Wellington is named after the town.  History  Kilbirnie Place where the Scots mustered under Alexander III before the Battle of Largs.Knight, James (1936), Glasgow and Strathclyde. London ; Thomas Nelson & Sons. pp. 83 - 84. Archaeological digs conducted in the 19th century have shown that the area was inhabited during the Bronze Age. A crannog with a connecting causeway was discovered in Kilbirnie Loch. The town derived its name from the parish church, the \\"Auld Kirk\\". In 1740 there were only three houses; the population grew to 959 people by 1801. Half a century later, and the town had grown substantially. In 1851 Kilbirnie contained 5,484 people, due to the Industrial Revolution, hastened by the locality of the Ayr and Glasgow railways. During this time the town was a hub of industrial activity with 2 flax-spinning mills, linen-thread mills, wincey factories, 5 fishing- net factories, 2 rope-works, engineering works, mines and ironworks. The steelworks opened in 1841 and quickly became the main industry in the area causing an inpouring of people and during the early to mid 20th Century the town grew to its height of around 10,000 people. The 1913 networkers' strike in Kilbirnie was agreed at an National Federation of Women Workers meeting in late March. It lasted from April to September 1913 and it was the longest recorded strike of women workers at that time. The strike was led by Kate McLean and it enjoyed community support. In May 1913 there was a meeting in Kilbirnie where 10,000 supporters were present. The networkers dispute was resolved on 2 September 1913 with improved wages and working conditions. The Decoy Bride a film starring David Tennant and Kelly Macdonald was partially filmed in Kilbirnie. The town was hit particularly hard by the closure of traditional industries. In addition Kilbirnie has highest bankruptcy rate in Scotland. Kilbirnie has a rate of 71 insolvencies per 10,000 people, just ahead of Clydebank and Gorebridge. Industry =Glengarnock Steelworks= Glengarnock Steel Works opened its blast furnaces around 1841 which caused a massive influx of people from all over the country, as well as all over the world. Initially these works were owned by Merry & Cunninghame before being taken over by David Colville & Sons and eventually nationalised as part of British Steel Corporation and finally closed in 1985. The steelworks in Glengarnock provided employment for most men of the community. The entire collection of staff magazines of the steelworks at Glengarnock have been preserved and are held at the Mitchell Library. This provides content such as spotlights on employees and departments, and contains photographs over 100 years old.Moorpark House. =W & J Knox Threadmills= These mills are famous for their nets, used by the British Army and BT Tower. They are one of very few companies in the United Kingdom who have expertise in this area. W & J Knox Threadmills was owned by the Knox family who were prominent, not only in Ayrshire but in the South of England too, becoming important members of society. Some of the mansion houses they built still remain, the Knox Institute was donated by a member of the Knox family and housed Kilbirnie's first public library and one of the cemeteries in the town contains an underground vault where the family are interred, next to the main Knox monument. Who's Who editions of the period list many members of the family. =Modern day= Since the closure of the steel works in the 1980s, the area has been an unemployment blackspot with distinct social problems. The town has very few local employers, and people generally commute out of the town to work. Glengarnock railway station serves the town and has three trains per hour to Paisley and Glasgow. There are regular bus services to Glasgow, Paisley, Largs and Irvine provided by Western Buses and McGill's.  Social history  =Swinging Sixties and regeneration= Amongst many other old buildings in the Town, stands the Walker Hall, a memorial hall dedicated to Dr Walker, one of the first physicians in the town. In the 1950s and '60s it was a famous concert venue, coming second only to the Barrowlands. Famous bands to have played the hall include Gerry & The Pacemakers and Bill Haley & His Comets. These days however, it houses the town's Citizens Advice Bureau. Other sources of entertainment in the 1950s and 60s included two cinemas, both of which have long since closed. One of these cinemas is now the Radio City . An Association was formed in 1998 to identify ways of providing much needed local facilities. During the 1997 election campaign, Brian Wilson met with a group of local teenagers who stressed the need for facilities, and plans were developed to provide a Healthy Living Centre which would include fitness facilities, internet access, a healthy eating cafe and child care. Bids for funding were made to private organisations and the National Lottery. =Saint Brennan's Day Fair and Robert Burns= The fair was considered the largest horse market in the west of Scotland. Robert Burns refers to the town in his poem \\"The Inventory\\" about a plough-horse that he purchased at the fair: \\"My furr-ahin 's a wordy beast, As e'er in tug or tow was traced. The fourth's a Highland Donald hastle, A damn'd red-wud Kilburnie blastie!\\"'' Local football team Kilbirnie Ladeside F.C. derive their sobriquet \\"the blasties\\" from the poem, a suitable appellation and an epithet which remains to this day due to the town's past of steel and iron production, as a reference to the blast furnaces. =Notable residents=Jameson Clark, actor, starring in films such as Whisky Galore! *James Jameson, Surgeon General, Army Medical Service *Joanne Love, footballer *Gordon McQueen, former Scotland, Manchester United and Leeds United footballer and Sky Sports Presenter. *Julie Peacock, Regional Correspondent BBC Reporting Scotland *George Stevenson, former Scotland and Motherwell F.C. footballer, went on to be the club's most successful manager * Allan Wilson, Politician, former Labour Member of the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Government Minister.  Places of worship  The Auld Kirk =Auld Kirk= The \\"Auld Kirk\\" is one of the oldest churches in Scotland still in use both pre-and post-Reformation. Robert Burns allegedly came to the blacksmiths near the Kirk. It is from this Church that Kilbirnie takes its name. =Roman Catholic Church St Brigids= Father Thomas P Lee, a young Irish priest, was sent in 1859 to be the resident priest in Kilbirnie. It is unclear how he raised the money to build the church. He chose St. Brigid (devotion to the poor) to be the patron saint of the parish. Opened in 1862. The current parish priest is Father Mark Kelly. =Gospel Hall= Tracing its roots back to 1889, a full history of the assembly can be found in the middle if the article here:- http://www.plymouthbrethren.org/article/5989  Education  =Primary education=Moorpark Primary School, accessed from Milton Road or School Road by students, was opened in 1978 to replace Ladyland School built in 1869 and Bridgend School built in 1893. The school is located east of its namesake Moorpark House and is adjacent to local secondary school Garnock Academy *Glengarnock Primary School has from 10 January 2017 been situated in the Garnock Community Campus. *Saint Bridget's Primary School, located on Hagthorne Avenue, educates local Roman Catholic and Christian children. This location opened in October 1963 replacing the 1894 building. Secondary level Catholic pupils attend the Secondary school, St Matthew's Academy in Saltcoats. =Secondary education=Garnock Academy is a secondary school that was formed in 1971 by the amalgamation of Beith Academy, Dalry High School, Kilbirnie Central School and Speir's school. Opening in September 1972, it was situated on School Road adjacent to Moorpark Primary, However, as of January 2017, the school moved into the new Garnock Community Campus in the Glengarnock area alongside the Primary school, Community Pool and library and other public offices and areas. It is a non-denominational co-educational school serving Barmill, Beith, Dalry, Gateside, Glengarnock, Kilbirnie, Longbar and the surrounding area. It has around 1,100 pupils.  Transport  =Rail=The town is serviced by Glengarnock railway station which runs regular services managed by Abellio ScotRail on the Ayrshire Coast Line. There are three trains per hour to Glasgow Mon - Sat, and an hourly service on Sunday. =Bus Services= The area is served by Stagecoach West Scotland and McGill's Bus Services. * 25, 25A, 25B and 25C Beith - Irvine Cross / Bourtreehill / Broomlands / Montgomerie Park * 904 Largs - Paisley * X34 Glasgow - Irvine Cross / Irvine Railway Station / Bourtreehill * X36 Glasgow - Ardrossan  Landmarks  =Air crashes= The hills between Kilbirnie and Largs were often black spots for aircraft passing over and many crashed due to low fog.

Story The story is based on the post-apocalyptic science fiction novel series La Compagnie des glaces by the French writer Georges-Jean Arnaud. In the 21st century, mankind is being ravaged by the greenhouse effect. A last-ditch effort to counteract it is designed and executed. It works far too well. Centuries if not millennia later, the planet is entirely covered in a thick, opaque cloud layer. Giant wolf packs roam the frozen wastes, and the mammoth has re-emerged from the elephant stock. Mankind ekes out a living in a few handfuls of settlements, connected by a network of massive armored trains. The network in turn is in the hands of the gargantuan Viking Union, which is merciless towards threats to its power. A few radicals, though, are willing to attempt a change, and managing to hijack a train of the Union, the Transarctica, they set out in search of the \\"sun\\". Gameplay The game is divided into two modes; exploration and combat. =Exploration= The train roams Eurasia using its various facilities and tools, gathering coal for currency and fuel, visiting towns to trade and to enhance the train, and searching for clues for its quest. The dystopic setting is rather well integrated, and for instance the use of slave labor is necessary to complete the game. The interface is quite original but rather cumbersome. This part has been criticized for the under-efficiency of trading in comparison to mining. =Combat= The Viking Union is out for blood, and meeting with another train triggers a simple battle mode. Battles are real-time plus slow-paced and may be dull at first, but the amount of things to handle will multiply with time - though this hardly helps the common mop-up period at the end. The two sides are positioned on parallel tracks some distance away from each other. Maneuvering is limited to horizontal movement. Combat assets include cannons (to attack enemy wagons), machine guns (to mow down ground troops, on both sides if timed poorly), infantry (jacks of all trades to operate on and in between trains, attack ground troops, set charges on hostile wagons and clear them from friendly ones) and mammoth cavalry (to attack ground troops and to shield and transport infantry). All other wagons, save the locomotives, are dead weight. Combat is won when the enemy is disarmed, the train is then looted for intact wagons and materials and the contents of destroyed wagons are written off. The game is lost if the Transarctica loses a vital wagon. All engagements can be expected to take several minutes. Reception Computer Gaming World in May 1994 criticized the train controls as both too simple and \\"intentionally annoying\\", train combat as \\"painfully slow\\", and other \\"annoying, rough edges\\". The magazine concluded that the game's \\"blemishes derail an otherwise original and delightful premise\\".

The orchestra performs primarily in the Marcus Center for the Performing Arts, in Uihlein Hall. The orchestra also serves as the orchestra for Florentine Opera productions. History The precursor ensemble to the orchestra was the Milwaukee Pops Orchestra, a part-time ensemble which had been founded 10 years earlier. In 1959, the orchestra formally changed its name to the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra, with Harry John Brown as its first music director. During his nine-year tenure, Brown led the orchestra's transition from a semi-professional pops group to a fully professional, full- time symphony orchestra. During the tenure of Kenneth Schermerhorn, the orchestra's second music director, from 1968 to 1980, the orchestra had begun its 'State Tour' programme of concerts around Wisconsin, to such cities as Fish Creek, Fond du Lac, Marinette, Ripon, Rhinelander, Three Lakes, West Bend, and Whitewater, Wisconsin, as well as Naperville, Illinois. The orchestra also initiated its concerts for students, as well as giving its first performance at Carnegie Hall. The Milwaukee Symphony Chorus was also established during this time. Lukas Foss served as the orchestra's third music director, from 1981 to 1986, which saw a notable increase in performances of contemporary music and American compositions, along with the orchestra's first European tour in 1986. Zdenƒõk M√°cal was the orchestra's fourth music director, from 1986 to 1995. The orchestra began to record for Koss Classics during this period, and established its Arts in Community Education programme in 1990. From 1995 to 1997, Stanis≈Çaw Skrowaczewski served as the orchestra's artistic advisor, prior to the advent of Andreas Delfs as the orchestra's fifth music director. Delfs was music director from 1997 to 2009. During his tenure, in 1999, the orchestra performed in Cuba, the first American symphony orchestra to do so since the U.S. embargo against Cuba was implemented in 1962. Delfs became the orchestra's conductor laureate after the conclusion of his tenure in 2009. Edo de Waart was the orchestra's most recent music director, from 2009 to 2017.Tom Strini, \\"Well-traveled leader to take baton at MSO\\". Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, 2 January 2008. His appointment was unusual in that de Waart had not conducted the orchestra prior to his appointment. Upon the conclusion of his tenure, the orchestra granted de Waart the title of conductor laureate. The orchestra's current assistant conductor is Yaniv Dinur. Past principal pops conductors have included Doc Severinsen, who holds the title of Principal Pops Conductor Emeritus, and Marvin Hamlisch. In December 2017, the orchestra purchased the former Warner Grand Theatre, with the intention to relocate there in 2020. In May 2018, Ken-David Masur first guest-conducted the orchestra. The orchestra immediately re-engaged him for a subsequent guest-conducting appearance in September 2018. On the basis of these concerts, in November 2018, the orchestra announced the appointment of Masur as its next music director, effective with the 2019-2020 season, with an initial contract of 4 seasons. Masur took the title of music director- designate with immediate effect. The orchestra has presented more than 100 world and American premieres of works by composers such as Lukas Foss, Philip Glass, Geoffrey Gordon, Daron Hagen, Roy Harris, Erich Korngold, Gian Carlo Menotti, Marc Neikrug, Matthias Pintscher, Daniel Schnyder, Jean Sibelius, Roberto Sierra, Gunther Schuller, William Schuman, Ottorino Respighi, Richard Rodgers, and others.

The Winter Garden Theatre is seven storeys above the Elgin Theatre. They are the last surviving Edwardian stacked theatres in the world. History The Winter Garden was designed to be an atmospheric garden, with painted walls in watercolours, and the ceiling is decorated with lanterns and dried beech leaves. The pair of theatres were originally built as the flagship of Marcus Loew's theatre chain in 1913. The building was designed by architect Thomas W. Lamb, who also designed the Ed Mirvish Theatre nearby. Both theatres were built to show vaudeville acts and the short silent movies of the time. Each theatre was intended for a different class of patron. The gold-and-marble, domed, 'hard-top' lower theatre (originally called Loew's Yonge Street Theatre) was home to continuous vaudeville and movies. The upper- level Winter Garden is an 'atmospheric' country garden under the stars, painted with murals of plants and garden trellises, with tree trunk columns and lantern lights. The upper theatre was built for the 'Big Time' vaudeville market and had reserved seats at premium prices, catering to affluent patrons. As well as competing in a different market, the upper theatre could be used for experimentation with acts, without the risk of closing the lower theatre. By 1928, feature-length silent films were popular, but sound films were just coming into their own. In 1928, the lower theatre was converted to show sound films and the upper theatre was closed. The Winter Garden remained shuttered for about sixty years. Left inside it was a large collection of vaudeville flats and scenery, now the world's largest surviving collection. In 1969, Loews sold the Elgin to Famous Players. By the 1970s, the Elgin was showing mainly B movies and soft-core pornography. =Recent history= Since 1979, the Elgin Theatre has served as one of the hosts to the annual Toronto International Film Festival. Cats was presented at the Elgin Theatre from 1985 to 1987. The musical was very successful, and demonstrated that the Elgin Theatre was still an economically viable venue. In 1981, the Ontario Heritage Foundation bought the structure from Famous Players. From March 1985 through March 1987 the musical Cats was very successfully presented in the essentially unrestored Elgin, showing the viability of the theatre. The building closed in 1987 for a full restoration and reopened in 1989. In 1991, Dr. David Griesinger and Steve Barbar of Lexicon, Inc., at the request of acousticians Neil Muncy and Robert Tanner, installed the first production LARES system, an electroacoustic enhancement system that augments architectural acoustics, in the Elgin Theatre. This initial LARES system used two microphones placed at the balcony's front edge to pick up sound from the stage. The microphone signals were digitized and processed in two mainframe computers, and the resulting signals were sent to 56 loudspeakers in the main ceiling and 60 under the balcony, for the purpose of providing additional intelligibility and ambience.AES 90th Convention.

The visit came about via the Toronto City Council's CDN$1 million (~US$750,000 at the time) payment to NBC to have the American television program visit Toronto for a week worth of shows, part of the overall council-funded PR effort of promoting Toronto as a tourist destination for Americans in the wake of the widely publicized summer 2003 Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic which adversely impacted the city's tourism industry. The Elgin Theatre played host to the taping of Bryan Adams in Concert for the American broadcast of Great Performances on PBS. The show was filmed in July 2014 and first aired on March 1, 2015.

A bright red or orange solid, it is used as pigment, in the manufacture of batteries, and rustproof primer paints. It is an example of a mixed valence compound, being composed of both Pb(II) and Pb(IV) in the ratio of two to one. Structure Lead(II,IV) oxide has a tetragonal crystal structure at room temperature, which then transforms to an orthorhombic (Pearson symbol oP28, Space group Pbam, No. 55) form at temperature . This phase transition only changes the symmetry of the crystal and slightly modifies the interatomic distances and angles. File:Red-lead-unit- cell-3D-balls.pngUnit cell of tetragonal Pb3O4 (Key: Pb O) File:Red-lead-3D-balls.pngPart of tetragonal red lead's crystal structure Preparation Lead(II,IV) oxide is prepared by calcination of lead(II) oxide (PbO; also called litharge) in air at about 450‚Äì480 ¬∞C: :6 PbO + O2 ‚Üí 2 Pb3O4 The resulting material is contaminated with PbO. If a pure compound is desired, PbO can be removed by a potassium hydroxide solution: :PbO + KOH + H2O ‚Üí K[Pb(OH)3] Another method of preparation relies on annealing of lead(II) carbonate (cerussite) in air: :6 PbCO3 \\\\+ O2 ‚Üí 2 Pb3O4 \\\\+ 6 CO2 Yet another method is oxidative annealing of white lead: :3 Pb2CO3(OH)2 \\\\+ O2 ‚Üí 2 Pb3O4 \\\\+ 3 CO2 \\\\+ 3 H2O In solution, lead(II,IV) oxide can be prepared by reaction of potassium plumbate with lead(II) acetate, yielding yellow insoluble lead(II,IV) oxide monohydrate, Pb3O4¬∑H2O, which can be turned into the anhydrous form by gentle heating: :K2PbO3 \\\\+ 2 Pb(OCOCH3)2 \\\\+ H2O ‚Üí Pb3O4 \\\\+ 2 KOCOCH3 \\\\+ 2 CH3COOH Natural minium is uncommon, forming only in extreme oxidizing conditions of lead ore bodies. The best known natural specimens come from Broken Hill, New South Wales, Australia, where they formed as the result of a mine fire.Minium Reactions Red lead is virtually insoluble in water and in ethanol. However, it is soluble in hydrochloric acid present in the stomach, and is therefore toxic when ingested. It also dissolves in glacial acetic acid and a diluted mixture of nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide. When heated to 500 ¬∞C, it decomposes to lead(II) oxide and oxygen. At 580 ¬∞C, the reaction is complete. :2Pb3O4 ‚Üí 6 PbO + O2 Nitric acid dissolves the lead(II) oxide component, leaving behind the insoluble lead(IV) oxide: :Pb3O4 \\\\+ 4 HNO3 ‚Üí PbO2 \\\\+ 2 Pb(NO3)2 \\\\+ 2 H2O With iron oxides and with elemental iron, lead(II,IV) oxide forms insoluble iron(II) and iron(III) plumbates, which is the basis of the anticorrosive properties of lead-based paints applied to iron objects. Use Red lead has been used as a pigment for primer paints for iron objects. Due to its toxicity, its use is being limited. It finds limited use in some amateur pyrotechnics as a delay charge and was used in the past in the manufacture of dragon's egg pyrotechnic stars. Red lead is used as a curing agent in some polychloroprene rubber compounds. It is used in place of magnesium oxide to provide better water resistance properties. Red lead was used for engineer's scraping, before being supplanted by engineer's blue. It is also used as an adultering agent in turmeric powder. Physiological effects When inhaled, lead(II,IV) oxide irritates lungs. In case of high dose, the victim experiences a metallic taste, chest pain, and abdominal pain. When ingested, it is dissolved in the gastric acid and absorbed, leading to lead poisoning. High concentrations can be absorbed through skin as well, and it is important to follow safety precautions when working with lead-based paint. Long-term contact with lead(II,IV) oxide may lead to accumulation of lead compounds in organisms, with development of symptoms of acute lead poisoning. Chronic poisoning displays as agitation, irritability, vision disorders, hypertension, and a grayish facial hue. Lead(II,IV) oxide was shown to be carcinogenic for laboratory animals. Its carcinogenicity for humans was not proven. Minium from a mine fire at Broken Hill, Australia History This compound's Latin name minium originates from the Minius, a river in northwest Iberia where it was first mined. Lead(II,IV) oxide was used as a red pigment in ancient Rome, where it was prepared by calcination of white lead. In the ancient and medieval periods it was used as a pigment in the production of illuminated manuscripts, and gave its name to the minium or miniature, a style of picture painted with the colour. As a finely divided powder, it was also sprinkled on dielectric surfaces to study Lichtenberg figures. In traditional Chinese medicine, red lead is used to treat ringworms and ulcerations, though the practice is limited due to its toxicity. Also, azarc√≥n, a Mexican folk remedy for gastrointestinal disorders, contains up to 95% lead(II,IV) oxide. It was also used before the 18th century as medicine.

Emperor Pontianus, his son Diocletian and the seven wise masters (Cod pal. germ 149 at Heidelberg) Story and plot The Sultan sends his son, the young Prince, to be educated away from the court in the seven liberal arts by Seven Wise Masters. On his return to court, his stepmother, the empress, attempts to seduce him. To avert danger he is bound over to a week's silence by Sindibad, leader of the Seven Wise Masters. During this time, the empress accuses him to her husband, and seeks to bring about his death by seven stories which she relates to the emperor; but her narrative is each time confuted by the Seven Wise Masters led by Sindibad. Finally the prince's lips are unsealed, the truth exposed, and the wicked empress is executed. The frame narrative served as the flexible way to transmit tales to other listeners. Origins The cycle of stories, which appears in many European languages, is of Eastern origin. An analogous collection occurs in Sanskrit, attributed to the Indian philosopher Syntipas in the first century BC, though the Indian original is unknown. Other suggested origins are Persian (since the earliest surviving texts are in Persian) and Hebrew (a culture with similar tales, such as that of the biblical Joseph). Later history Hundreds of surviving European texts are known.Laura A. Hibbard, Medieval Romance in England. p. 174. New York: Burt Franklin. 1963. These normally contain fifteen tales, one for each sage, seven from the stepmother, and one from the prince; though the framework is preserved, only four of the commonest European tales are also found in the Eastern version.Laura A. Hibbard, Medieval Romance in England. p. 175 New York: Burt Franklin. 1963 Travelling from the east by way of Arabic, Persian, Syriac and Greek, the work became known as The Book of Sindibd, and was translated from Greek into Latin in the 12th century by Jean de Hauteseille (Joannes de Alta Silva), a monk of the abbey of Haute-Seille near Toul, with the title of Dolopathos (ed. Hermann √ñsterley, Strassburg, 1873). This was translated into French about 1210 by a trouv√®re named Herbers as Li romans de Dolopathos. Another French version, Li Romans des sept sages, was based on a different Latin original. The German, English, French and Spanish chapbooks of the cycle are generally based on a Latin original differing from these. Three metrical romances probably based on the French, and dating from the 14th century, exist in English. The most important of these is The Sevyn Sages by John Rolland of Dalkeith edited for the Bannatyne Club (Edinburgh, 1837). Literary legacy The collection later supplied tales that circulated in both oral and written traditions. Giovanni Boccaccio used many of them for his famous work, the Decameron. The Latin romance was frequently printed in the 15th century, and Wynkyn de Worde printed an English version about 1515.

It lies at one of the country's border crossing points with Ethiopia; on the other side of the border is Ethiopia's corresponding border village Metemma. History The town and district form a small ethnographical island in Al Qadarif, having been founded in the 18th century by a colony of Takruri from Darfur, who, finding the spot a convenient resting-place for their fellow-pilgrims on their way to Mecca and back, obtained permission from the Emperor of Ethiopia to make a permanent settlement there.Arthur E. Robinson, \\"The Tekruri Sheikhs of Gallabat (S. E. Sudan)\\", Journal of the Royal African Society, 26 (1926), p. 49 Lying on the main trade route from Sennar to Gondar (some 90 miles to the east) as well as being the center of the frontier province of Ras al-Fil, Gallabat grew into a trade center of some importance. The Scottish explorer James Bruce (who calls the town Hor-Cacamoot) spent two months in the town in 1772, disabled with dysentery which was cured only by the herbs of a local medicine-man and the attentions of his companion Yasin.J.M. Reid, Traveller Extraordinary: The Life of James Bruce of Kinnaird (New York: Norton, 1968), p. 216 n One notable ruler of Gallabat was Sheikh Miri, who has been described as \\"probably the most celebrated of these border chiefs\\". The Sheikh formed an alliance with the Khedive some time after Muhammad Ali of Egypt had conquered the Sennar sultanate in 1821, and proclaimed himself independent of the Ethiopian Empire. He accompanied the Turks (Egyptians) in their raid on Gondar, but escaped the ambush of Dejazmach Kinfu had sprung on the raiders. In 1838 Emperor Tewodros avenged the sack of Gondar with an attack on Gallabat; Sheikh Miri, with many of the Takruri, was killed. In about 1870, the Egyptians garrisoned Gallabat. In 1886, the town was attacked by followers of Abdallahi ibn Muhammad (the successor of Muhammad Ahmad) and sacked. From Gallabat, a Mahdist raiding party penetrated to Gondar in Ethiopia. The Mahdists then looted Gondar. In March 1889, in revenge, an Ethiopian army under Emperor Yohannes IV attacked the Mahdists close to Gallabat in what is known as the Battle of Gallabat (or Metemma). Yohannes IV was originally successful, with the Mahdists suffering many casualties, but a shot from a lone sniper killed the Emperor late in the battle, causing his army to flee and routing the attack. In 1899 the Mahdists were decisively defeated in the Sudan by British and Egyptian forces during the Battle of Umm Diwaykarat. After the even more decisive Battle of Omdurman, Mahdist rule in the Sudan was at an end. From 1899 to 1956, Gallabat was located in what was known as the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. In July 1940 during the East African Campaign, Italian forces advancing from Italian East Africa forced a small British garrison commanded by Wilfred Thesiger to withdraw from Gallabat to the pass at Khor el Otrub. The Italians then occupied the town until November when the British under Brigadier Slim launched an attack to take the town back, but due to poor morale of the Essex Regiment and lack of coordination by the British bombers, failed to capture Metemma.Anthony Mockler, Haile Selassie's War (New York: Olive Branch Press, 2003), pp. 207, 272-279 In 1956 the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan became the independent Republic of the Sudan.

The factory was founded on 2 August 1916 as the Moscow Automotive Society or AMO (). The factory was completed in 1917, just before the Revolution, and was built south of Moscow near Moscow River in Tjufeleva grove. It was a modern building with the latest in American equipment and was designed to employ 6,000 workers. The plans were to produce Fiat F-15 1.5-ton trucks under license. Because of the October Revolution and the subsequent Russian Civil War it took until 1 November 1924 to produce the first vehicle which was shown at a parade on 7 November, the AMO-F15. Nevertheless, the factory still managed to assemble trucks bought from Italy in 1917‚Äì1919. On April 30, 1923 the factory was named after an Italian coummunist Pietro Ferrero, but in 1925 was renamed to First National Automobile Factory (Russian: 1-–π –ì–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –∞–≤—Ç–æ–º–æ–±–∏–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –∑–∞–≤–æ–¥). 2 years later in 1927 Ivan Likhachov was appointed as a head of the factory, a person whose name the factory bears from 1956. In April 1929, it was agreed on to expand the plant to build Autocar 2.5-ton truck models. In 1931 the factory was re-equipped and expanded with the help of the American A.J. Brandt Co., and changed its name to Automotive Factory No. 2 Zavod Imeni Stalina (ZIS or ZiS). After Nikita Khrushchev denounced the cult of personality of Joseph Stalin in 1956, the name was changed again to Zavod imeni Likhachyova, after its former director Ivan Alekseevich Likhachov. ZiL lanes‚Äîroad lanes dedicated to vehicles carrying top Soviet officials‚Äîwere named after the car. The ZiL limousines were the official car that carried the Soviet heads of state, and many Soviet Union allied leaders, to summits or in parades. The limousines were flown to international summits as for example in 1990 to Washington, D.C. for President Mikhail Gorbachev's official state visit. ZiL had a history of exporting trucks to Cuba, a trade resumed in the early 21st century. The ZiL factory is portrayed in a 2014 documentary, The Last Limousine. After the final ZiL limousine was built in 2012, the Moscow factory administration stopped truck production and the company was declared bankrupt in 2013. ZiL still exists as a legal entity, but produces no vehicles. In 2014 it was announced that the factory site will be turned into a residential development. Most factory buildings were dismantled in 2015. The factory's equipment and other automotive assets were auctioned off to a new company, \\"MSTs6 AMO ZIL\\". It employs 47 staff, mostly former ZiL workers. The company took part in the Moscow International Automobile Salon 2016.

Deutsche Reichspost  Kaiserliches Postamt sign, about 1900 Upon the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 and the break-up of the German Confederation in the Peace of Prague, the North German Confederation was established, instigated by the Prussian minister-president Otto von Bismarck. Originally a military alliance, it evolved to a federation with the issuing of a constitution with effect from 1 July 1867. In the course of the war, Prussian troops had occupied the Free City of Frankfurt and the King of Prussia (later to become Emperor of Germany) had purchased the remnants of the Thurn-und-Taxis Post organisation. According to article 48, the federal area of the Northern German states, de facto an enlarged Prussia, came under the united postal authority, led by director Heinrich von Stephan. With the German unification upon the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì1871, the Deutsche Reichspost was established as a state monopoly and became the official national postal authority of the German Empire including the annexed province of Alsace- Lorraine. Its official name was Kaiserliche Post und Telegraphenverwaltung. The Southern German federated states of Baden (until 1872), W√ºrttemberg (until 1902) and Bavaria initially maintained separate state post authorities, that nevertheless were integrated into the nationwide administration. On 1 January 1876 a Reichspostamt under Postmaster General von Stephan was split-off from Bismarck's Reich Chancellery as a government agency in its own right. In the First World War, a Reichsabgabe tax was levied on the postal traffic from 1 August 1916 in order to finance the war expenses. Deutsche Reichspost logo, 1925 With the establishment of the Weimar Republic upon the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì1919, the former Reichspostamt in Berlin became the Reichspostministerium. After the hyperinflation period, the Deutsche Reichspost (DRP) agency was again spun off in 1924 and operated as a state- owned enterprise. On 2 June 1932 Paul Freiherr von Eltz-R√ºbenach was appointed Reichspost Minister by Chancellor Franz von Papen and he maintained his office upon the Machtergreifung of the Nazi Party in 1933, \\"assisted\\" by Nazi state secretary Wilhelm Ohnesorge. The postal area was significantly enlarged with the incorporation of the Saar territory in 1935, the Austrian Anschluss in 1938, and the annexation of the Sudetenland according to the Munich Agreement. It was during this time that the Reichspost installed the first public videophone. In the Second World War the Reichspost authority spread out to the Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany, such as the Reichsgau Wartheland, the Reichsgau Danzig-Westpreu√üen, and the Polish General Government. In 1941 postal codes were introduced. The Feldpost military mail organisation of the Wehrmacht not only served Army, Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine service members, but also SS-Verf√ºgungstruppen, Waffen-SS and Reichsarbeitsdienst members in the field, becoming the general postal authority of the occupied territories. Deliveries were more and more affected by the advance of Allied troops from January 1945 on. The Reichspost finally ceased to function with the German Instrument of Surrender on May 8. The last Reichspostminister Julius Dorpm√ºller, a member of the Flensburg Government, was arrested two weeks later, and governmental authority was officially taken over by the Allied Control Council with the Berlin Declaration of June 5.  Successors  The Reichspost was initially replaced by Allied-controlled postal authorities that provided mail services in the occupation zones. From 1947 a united agency served the British-American Bizone area. With the emergence of two German states, the Deutsche Bundespost (German federal post office) was established in West Germany, and the Deutsche Post in East Germany. In addition, there was a separate Deutsche Bundespost Berlin for West Berlin, as well as the Saar postal authority (1947‚Äì1956). After the reunification of Germany in 1990, the state-owned Bundespost continued to function as the sole provider of postal services until 1995, when the postal, telecommunications, and banking divisions were spun off as separate entities. The Deutsche Bundespost eventually became Deutsche Post AG, a share holding company, later reintegrating the Postbank, and Deutsche Telekom.History of Deutsche Post AG (1995)  Other use  Between 1894 and 1938, a daily newspaper called Reichspost was issued in Vienna, Austria. * During the Second World War there was an additional use for the postal vans; \\"01.05.1942 Transfer of Postschutz in the SS (see Gottlob Berger), shortly after that also the 'remote power mail' ('front help of the Deutsche Reichspost') used as 'SS power driving season'.

He was born at Rome and died at Florence. Life He studied at the University of Rome La Sapienza, took his degree in 1855 in natural science and mathematics, and entered his uncle's pharmacy as an assistant. His scanty leisure was, however, given to study. He learned Greek by himself, and gained facility in the modern language by conversing with the Greek students at the university. In spite of all disadvantages, he not only mastered the language, but became one of the chief classical scholars of Italy. In 1857 he published, in the Rheinisches Museum, a translation of some recently discovered fragments of Hypereides, with a dissertation on that orator. This was followed by a notice of the annalist Granius Licinianus, and one on the oration of Hypereides on the Lamian War. In 1859 he was appointed professor of Greek at Pisa on the recommendation of the duke of Sermoneta. A few years later he was called to a similar post at Florence, remaining emeritus professor at Pisa also. He subsequently took up his residence in Rome as lecturer on Greek antiquities and greatly interested himself in the Roman Forum excavations. He was a member of the governing bodies of the academies of Milan, Venice, Naples and Turin. He was appointed senator in 1891. In Pisa, in 1863, he met Leone Raffalovich, a businessman from Odessa. After a short engagement, he married Leone's daughter Elena on 13 August, and in 1865 their daughter Laura was born. Their different natures meant that the couple drifted apart, and in 1872 Elena left the family to settle in Venice. Laura married Luigi Adriano Milani, and Domenico Comparetti, wishing that their last name should be was transmitted to her daughter's male descendants, got the royal concession to the addition of his name to those of the Milani grandchildren. His great- grandson was Don Lorenzo Milani.Barbiana e la sua Scuola  La Famiglia (Italian) Works The list of Comparetti's writings is long and varied. Of his works in classical literature, the best known are an edition of the Euxenippus of Hypereides, and monographs on Pindar and Sappho. He also edited the great inscription which contains a collection of the municipal laws of Gortyn in Crete, discovered on the site of the ancient city. In the Kalewala and the Traditional Poetry of the Finns (English translation by I. M. Anderton, 1898) he discusses the national epic of Finland and its heroic songs, with a view to solving the problem whether an epic could be composed by the interweaving of such national songs. He comes to a negative conclusion, and applies this reasoning to the Homeric problem. He treats this question again in a treatise on the so-called Peisistratean edition of Homer (La Commissione omerica di Pisistrato, 1881). His Researches concerning the Book of Sindibad were translated in the Proceedings of the Folk-Lore Society. His Vergil in the Middle Ages (translated into English by E. F. M. Benecke, 1895) traces the strange vicissitudes by which the great Augustan poet became successively grammatical fetich, Christian prophet and wizard. Together with Alessandro d'Ancona, Comparetti edited a collection of Italian national songs and stories (9 vols, Turin, 1870‚Äì1891), many of which had been collected and written down by himself for the first time.

History The cinema of Burkina Faso is an important part of the history of the post-colonial West African and African film industry.Spaas, pp. 232-246 Burkina's contribution to African cinema started with the establishment of the film festival FESPACO (Festival Panafricain du Cin√©ma et de la T√©l√©vision de Ouagadougou), which was launched as a film week in 1969 and gained government support and permanent structures in 1972. It is the largest film exhibition venue in sub-Saharan Africa, with more than half a million attendees, and takes place in odd numbered years in March. Burkina is also one of the countries producing the most feature films in Africa. Many of the nation's filmmakers are known internationally and have won international prizes. For many years the headquarters of the Federation of Panafrican Filmmakers (FEPACI) was in Ouagadougou, rescued in 1983 from a period of moribund inactivity by the enthusiastic support and funding of President Thomas Sankara In 2006 the Secretariat of FEPACI moved to South Africa but the headquarters of the organization is still in Ouagaoudougou. Between 1977 and 1987 Burkina Faso housed a regional film school, Institut d'Education Cin√©matographique de Ouagadougou (INAFEC), which was instigated by FEPACI and funded in part by UNESCO. But eighty percent of its funding came from the government of Burkina Faso; no other African country participated in its funding and few sent students. Today's cinema In the late 1990s, local private production companies began to proliferate and digital production became increasingly prevalent. By 2002 over twenty-five small production companies existed in the country, many pooling their resources and expertise in order to produce. The best known directors from Burkina Faso are: Mamadou Djim Kola, Gaston Kabor√©, Kollo Daniel Sanou, Paul Zoumbara, Emmanuel Kalifa Sanon, Pierre S.

Burkina also produces popular television series such as Bobodjiouf. The internationally known filmmakers such as Ouedraogo, Kabore, Yameogo, and Kouyate make also popular television series. Distribution A cinema in Bobo-Dioulasso Many films shot in Burkina Faso by local directors have found distribution in Francophone Europe and several have received assistance from the French Ministry of Co-operation. However, while these films have won awards in Europe and are regularly featured in African Studies courses, in Africa itself they are little known outside of academic circles. Festivals and schools Burkina Faso hosts the Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou (FESPACO) every two years in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso's capital. In 2005, director Gaston Kabor√©, who won the top prize at FESPACO in 1997 for his film Buud Yam, opened a training school for new filmmakers in Ouagadougou.

Its home is the reconstructed Court Tennis Building at the Newport Casino. The National Tennis Club hosted the Real Tennis World Championship match in 2004, when Robert Fahey successfully defended his title against Tim Chisholm. The Court Tennis Building was constructed as part of the original Casino complex in 1880 and in 1980 the National Tennis Court was rededicated, largely through the efforts of Clarence \\"Clarry\\" Pell, as the symbolic home of the sport in the United States. Origins Court tennis, also known as \\"real tennis,\\" is the original indoor racquet sport from which the modern game of lawn tennis (usually simply called tennis) is descended. It is known as court tennis in the United States, royal tennis in Australia and courte-paume in France. The expression \\"real\\" was primarily used by journalists in the mid-20th century to distinguish the ancient game from modern \\"lawn\\" tennis (even though the sport is rarely played on lawns outside the few social-club managed estates such as Wimbledon). Real tennis is played today on 47 existing courts in the United Kingdom, Australia, the United States, and France. Despite a documented history of courts existing in the German states during the 17th century, real tennis eventually died out there during or after the World War II reconstruction. =Game Description= The rules and scoring are similar to those of lawn tennis. In both sports game scoring is by fifteens (with the exception of 40, which is shortened from 45), however in real tennis the player with six games wins a set even if the opponent has five games. A match is typically best of three sets, except for the major open tournaments in which the matches are best of five sets. Another difference is that unlike the latex-based technology underlying the modern lawn-tennis ball, real tennis still utilizes a cork-based ball very close in design to the original ball used in the game, which are much less bouncy than lawn tennis balls and weigh about 2 ounces (compared to the lawn tennis ball weighing at 2 ounces). Real tennis also uses long racquets (27 inches) made of wood and use very tight strings to cope with the heavier balls. A real tennis court is enclosed by walls on all four sides, three of which have sloping roofs, known as \\"penthouses.\\" A game of real tennis has characteristic features such as the various window-like openings below the penthouse roofs that offer players a chance to win the point instantly by hitting the ball into the opening. History The National Tennis Court The National Tennis Club (NTC) was formed in 1980 when the original court tennis court, destroyed by a series of arsenic fires in 1945 and 1946, was completely rebuilt. The only thing that remains original is the floor and some of the lower walls, dating back to 1880. A group of devoted players and enthusiasts, the National Court patrons, including the former President, Clarence C. Pell, provided funding for the restoration through the United States Court Tennis Association (USCTA). The informal reopening of the court, known as the National Tennis Court, occurred on September 29, 1979. The official dedication was observed in August, 1980, following ceremonies at the conclusion of the first world doubles tournament for the Tiffany Cup. The National Tennis Court has been considered to be the official court of the USCTA since its restoration in 1980. As the game has grown, new institutions have been formed, such as the U.S. Court Tennis Preservation Foundation (USCTPF) to provide complementary leadership and funding for this amateur game. The Club originally was only opened for play in summer months, but the court is now in use year round. The club has an active membership of approximately 100 players. It is also one of the busiest court tennis courts in the United States and has a program for all levels, including club handicaps, inter-city play, night leagues, and national and international tournaments. Club members compete worldwide. The Club has been led by its governors, Jonathan Isham, Barclay Douglas, Sr., Clarry Pell, Jim Wharton, Jonathon Pardee and Jane Lippincott. =Membership= Resident Active Membership These members may use the court for singles and doubles matches throughout the year and are eligible to enter all club events and tournaments and championships for which they qualify by handicap. Non-Resident Membership This category is available to individuals and families who reside further than 40 miles from the court and are limited to 50 hours of court time annually. Some members who qualify for non-resident membership will choose the Active category so that they are not limited on court hours. They are eligible to enter all club events and tournaments and championships for which they qualify by handicap. Social Membership Social members receive all club mailings and invitations to social events. International Membership For individuals who live overseas but who wish to support the National Tennis Club there is the International category. They are limited to 5 hours of court time annually without charge. Junior Membership For individuals who are 25 years or younger, the junior membership is available. Support for weekly instructions and trips to tournaments at other clubs are provided at this category. The goal of this category is to train and encourage the players of tomorrow. Taste of Tennis This program is for beginners to give the game a try and includes 60 days of full court usage, the loan of a racquet and an introductory lesson with the club professional.

It was once a modest fishing station, with all or part of the fishing station being known as Beck Hythe. In the latter part of the 19th century it was catapulted into prominence, and became known as ‚Äúthe village of millionaires‚Äù. History The Church of St Martin The London journalist and travel writer Clement Scott came to Overstrand in 1883, christened the area ‚Äò‚ÄôPoppyland‚Äô‚Äô, and wrote about the church tower on the cliff edge and its ‚ÄúGarden of Sleep‚Äù. While in Overstrand he stayed at the Mill House with miller Alfred Jermy and his daughter Louie, who became ‚Äúthe Maid of the Mill‚Äù in his articles about ‚Äò‚ÄôPoppyland‚Äô‚Äô. Scott had many London contacts in the theatrical world, and his writings led a number of them and others from London society to come to Overstrand. Some bought land in the village and had houses built there, and for a while the village was the place to visit. A large hotel was built on the cliff edge, though this slid into the sea in the 1950s. The Edwardian architect Sir Edwin Lutyens worked at Overstrand, designing Overstrand Hall for Charles William Mills, 2nd Baron Hillingdon, The Pleasaunce for Cyril Flower, 1st Baron Battersea and the Methodist Church.Pevsner Architectural Guides - Norfolk 1: Norwich and the North-East, pages 632-3 The large houses of the gentry have largely passed from private ownership to other uses. Overstrand railway station was on the Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway between Cromer and North Walsham. It is now closed. The Overstrand biplane bomber was named after the village, having been made at the Boulton & Paul aircraft factory in Norwich in the early 1930s. In popular culture Season 1, episode 2 of the BBC TV series \\"Screen Two\\" was called \\"Poppyland\\" (1985). Directed by John Madden, it took place in Overstrand and tells the story of Clement Scott in his travels there. Coastal erosion As with much of the Norfolk coast, erosion was and continues to be a major problem. Clifton Way is an experimental site; its sea defences include riprap (at ¬£1,300 a boulder, predominantly shipped from Norway), wooden groynes, revetments, gabions and Offshore Reefs. The cliffs of soft boulder clay slump because of the water running through the clay, and the resulting material on the beach is removed by the succeeding high tides. In the neighbouring village of Sidestrand, the church was moved back from the cliff edge in the 19th century, though the tower of the church was left standing on the cliff top.

Wells‚Äô The Time Machine, is an extrapolation of the class structure of the United Kingdom of his time, an extreme form of Social Darwinism; during tens of thousands of years, human beings have evolved into two different species based on their social class. Speculative societies Most story and novel-length works of science fiction include speculation (directly or indirectly) on modes of life and behaviour. They are sometimes allegorical and often serious attempts to model possible future societies, political institutions and systems. Examples include Harry Harrison's novel Make Room! Make Room!, The Dispossessed by Ursula K. Le Guin; and the Hostile Takeover Trilogy by S. Andrew Swann. Imagined societies may be based on very different assumptions. Often the future is modeled on historic forms - feudalism, or in the case of The Foundation series, the Roman Empire. A common theme is the integration of humanity into some greater interstellar society. A popular modern example is the Uplift series by David Brin where a species' status is defined based on the concept of biologically uplifting other species. Utopian societies The term Utopia was invented by Thomas More as the title of his Latin book De Optimo Reipublicae Statu deque Nova Insula Utopia (circa 1516), known more commonly as Utopia. He created the word \\"utopia\\" to suggest two Greek neologisms simultaneously: outopia (no place) and eutopia (good place). More depicts a rationally organised society, through the narration of an explorer who discovers it‚ÄîRaphael Hythlodaeus. Utopia is a republic where all property is held in common. In addition, it has few laws, no lawyers and rarely sends its citizens to war, but hires mercenaries from among its war-prone neighbours. Generally speaking, utopias are generally societies whose author believes either perfect, or as perfect as can be attainable. Ernest Callenbach's Ecotopia is a contemporary example. This can cause some confusion, in that some works generally recognized as ‚Äúutopian‚Äù, such as Plato‚Äôs Republic, can come across as much less than ideal to a modern reader. They are one of the smaller subsets of political science fiction, possibly because it is difficult to create dramatic tension in a world the author believes is perfect. Various authors get around this problem by postulating problems in the utopian society, such L. Neil Smith does. Other ways of presenting a utopian society in science fiction, is to send characters outside it to explore beyond its confines (ala Star Trek), or focus on an outsider character entering the society, as in Aldous Huxley‚Äôs Brave New World. This last method is often used to show that the utopian society shown is actually a dystopia. Kim Stanley Robinson's approach in The Mars Trilogy involved exploring the creation of utopian and ecotopian societies on Mars. Another option for a Utopian society can be found in robotocracy, or the rule of Robots or Computers, with the theory that a programmed machine can dispassionately provide for the welfare of all. Examples of this include various works of Isaac Asimov and the planet of Sigma Draconis VI in the Star Trek episode \\"Spock's Brain\\". If the machine rule becomes harsh or oppressive, it may become a dystopia instead. Dystopian societies Dystopias are societies where the author illustrates the worst that can happen. Usually this encompasses extrapolating trends the author sees as dangerous. During the 20th century many examples were written in reaction to the rise of Nazism, Communism and Religious Fundamentalism: *Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell which illustrates the ultimate totalitarian state in which the government is in control of every aspect of human existence, using propaganda, universal surveillance, and torture. *The Man in the High Castle by Philip K. Dick was written after the war in response to Fascism. It is set in a world where the Axis forces have won World War II and are rival superpowers. In it the main characters argue and are involved in politics and power. *The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood tells the tale of a woman caught up in a fundamentalist Christian dictatorship where women are forced into a system of sexual slavery for the ruling patriarchy. It is important to keep in mind that scenarios which some would describe as dystopic, others would describe as utopian. Norman Spinrad's novel The Iron Dream was generally recognised to be a dystopic novel, but lauded by neo-Nazis as a utopia. Politics Often the political focus of a science fiction novel is less on the social order, but how people maneuver and achieve their agendas within a given system. Many space operas rely on vast interstellar bureaucracies to drive their plots (see: Galactic empire). George Lucas's famous Star Wars saga features political science modeled after historic events. The Retief stories by Keith Laumer and the Chanur books by C. J. Cherryh have politics and political maneuverings as some of the main themes, and Frank Herbert's Dune books offer advanced explorations of human politics, including the dovetailing economics. Often this focus can descend into conspiracy and paranoia where the premise is that there are secret forces out to get the protagonists, the seminal example of which is the Illuminatus! Trilogy. Most commonly, science fiction deals with the political fallout of its own premises. A story will posit some new event or technology and explore its political dimensions; this includes most techno-thrillers but also encompasses a large body of traditional science fiction. An example is the Philip K. Dick story The Minority Report (upon which the film starring Tom Cruise is based), which introduces the idea of perfectly predicting a crime of violence so the perpetrator can be arrested before the crime is committed, and the political and legal ramifications of actually using such a system. =Examples by category= Adhocracy  Cory Doctorow, Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom * Alien Contact  Although encounters between humanity and non-human intelligences serve as the primary theme in the series of novels by Arthur C. Clarke that began with 2001: A Space Odyssey, they also explore the irrationality produced by Cold War military secrecy.  Carl Sagan, Contact  Peter Watts, Blindsight * Anarchy  The Dispossessed, by Ursula K. Le Guin, depicts a functional and liberated (but materially impoverished) anarcho-syndicalist society and contrasts it against its wealthy (but exploitative) capitalist neighbor.  In the Culture series by Iain M. Banks, the societies of humanity have essentially evolved into political anarchies; people associate or cooperate entirely on a voluntary basis for mutual support. There are organisations for cooperative ventures such as defense, exploration and even espionage, but they are run on an entirely voluntary basis. Advanced technology, cultural evolution and the planned economy liberate humanity from inequality and economic scarcity.  In The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, Robert A. Heinlein presents a human society on the Moon as an ideal anarchy, populated by political exiles and held together by the need for cooperation to ensure mutual survival, coupled with the ease for revenge in the event of harm. The revolutionaries in The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress are vaguely anarcho-capitalist. The LaNague Federation series of novels and stories by F. Paul Wilson.  The Fall Revolution books of Ken MacLeod.

The latter was translated from a Scots prose version at the suggestion of an aunt (\\"ane proper wenche\\"), who had found his treatment of the courtly allegory involved and uninteresting. The Court of Venus was edited by Walter Gregor for the S.T.S. in 1884. See W. A. Craigie's long list of corrections of that edition in the Modern Language Quarterly (March 1898). In The Allegory of Love (1936), C. S.

Educated at the Royal High School and the Universities of Edinburgh, Leiden, and Paris, he took his doctor's degree at the University of Angers in 1662, and soon afterwards settled as a physician working in Edinburgh. He resided at \\"Kipps Castle\\" near Linlithgow.History of Livingston, William F hendrie In 1667 with Sir Andrew Balfour he started the botanical garden in Edinburgh, and he took a leading part in establishing the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, of which he was elected president in 1684. Both Sibbald and Balfour were proponents of the Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia. In 1685 he was appointed the first professor of medicine at the University of Edinburgh. He was also appointed Geographer Royal in 1682, and his numerous and miscellaneous writings deal with historical and antiquarian as well as with botanical and medical subjects. He based many of his cartographical studies on the work of Timothy Pont. He is buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard in Edinburgh in a vault against the southern wall.

AnimalBase, last modified 23 December 2008, accessed 1 May 2011. It is used as a model organism in citizen science projects. Description Cepaea nemoralis is among the largest and, because of its polymorphism and bright colours, one of the best-known snails in Western Europe. The colour of the shell of Cepaea nemoralis is very variable; it can be reddish, brownish, yellow or whitish, with or without one or more dark-brown colour bands. Names for every colour variant were established in the 1800s; but this system was later abandoned. The thickened and slightly out-turned apertural lip usually dark brown, rarely white. The umbilicus is narrow but open in juveniles, and closed in adults. The surface of the shell is semi-glossy, and it has from 4¬Ω to 5¬Ω whorls. The width of the shell is 18‚Äì25 mm. The height of the shell is 12‚Äì22 mm. Identification The similar species Caucasotachea vindobonensis is less intensely coloured. The grove snail is closely related to the white-lipped snail, C. hortensis, shares much the same habitat, and has similar shell colour and pattern. The grove snail is usually the larger of the two species when mature, but the principal difference is that the adult grove snail almost always has a dark brown lip to its shell, whilst adults of Cepaea hortensis almost always have a white lip. However, a morph of the grove snail also has a white lip. In areas where lip colour is variable, dissection is necessary: the structure of the love dart is quite different in the two species, as are the vaginal mucus glands. A cross-section of the love dart shows a cross with simple blades, whereas that of C. hortensis has bifurcated blades. C. hortensis has 4 or more branches of body light with reddish or brownish hue, upper side often slightly darker, tentacles darker and 15 mm long. Coloration Apart from the band at the lip of the shell, lemon snails are highly polymorphic in their shell colour and banding. The background colour of the shell can sometimes be so pale as to be almost white; it can also be yellow, pink, chestnut through to dark brown, and the shells can be with or without dark bandings. The bands vary in intensity of colour, in width and in total number, from zero up to a total of six. The polymorphism has been intensely studied from 1940 onwards for its heredity, evolution and ecology. Researchers have variously asserted that the cause is random genetic drift, different natural selection pressures in different areas (the snail often has darker camouflage in woodland, lighter in rough grassland) with mixing by migration, and balanced polymorphism. Balanced polymorphism could arise when a predator like the song thrush has a given 'search image', so it tends to see and kill snails of a particular colour and pattern. Natural selection would then favour a diversity of colours and patterns as an antipredator adaptation. However it appears that no one explanation is the whole answer: most probably, the polymorphism has several causes, including selection of paler, more reflective colours in hot environments to reduce water loss.

The species is rare and scattered in northern Scotland, where it has been introduced. It is not found in the Hebrides, Orkney or Shetland. It seems to have been affected by air pollution and soil acidification in some parts of England. The species is found in France, Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, Germany, eastwards to northwestern Poland, Czech Republic, SW Hungary, southern Portugal, central Spain, Bosnia, in Italy to Lucania, and as far north as southern Sweden. In Eastern Europe it is found in Latvia, Kaliningrad, Estonia (Hiiumaa island), and Ukraine. This species has been reported in British Columbia, Canada and Northern Ontario, and western Washington State.Pacific Northwest Shell Club, personal observation No doubt aided by human transport, this species is a good colonizer, and is often found in gardens, parks and abandoned land in cities. In Eastern Europe it occurs in urban areas. More recently, the grove snail has been introduced to North America, and Venezuela. The white-lipped snail has a similar range, but that species extends further north, to border the Arctic. Biology and ecology Mating Love dart of Cepaea nemoralis This is a very common and widespread species in Western Europe, occupying a very wide range of habitats from dunes along the coastline, to woodlands with full canopy cover. It lives in shrubs and open woods, in plains and highlands, dunes, cultivated habitats, gardens and roadsides. It can be found up to an altitude of 1200 m in the Alps, 1800 m in the Pyrenees, 900 m in Wales, 600 m in Scotland. This species feeds mainly on dead or senescent plants. It is not noxious to crops. Like most pulmonate land snails, it is hermaphrodite and must mate to produce fertile eggs. Mating tends to be concentrated in late spring and early summer, though it can continue through the autumn. The snails often store the sperm they receive from their partner for some time, and individual broods can have mixed paternity. In Britain it lays clutches of 30‚Äì50 (in France 40‚Äì80) oval eggs between June and August (in France May‚ÄìOctober, in W France until November). The size of the egg is 3.1 √ó 2.6 mmHeller J.

Juveniles hatch after 15‚Äì20 days. Maturity is reached when the shell reaches full adult form, which in France is after one year. This snail is comparatively slow-growing, usually taking three years to develop from an egg to a breeding adult. The life-span for this species is up to seven or eight years, with annual survival rates of about 50% (= 3% in five years, older adults suffer higher mortalities). In winter, the snails may hibernate, but can become active again during warm spells. Cepaea nemoralis is known experimentally to be a host for Angiostrongylus vasorum.Conboy G.A.

Retrieved 03/26/2006 from Founding FESPACO Headquarters at Ouagadougou Created in 1969, it was first called the Pan-African film and television festival of Ouagadougou. It has evolved into an internationally recognized and respected event. Alimata Salambere, the cultural minister of Burkina Faso from 1987 to 1991, was one of the founders of the festival. At its third edition in 1972, the festival was named FESPACO for short, keeping its full title as Festival pan-Africain du cinema et de la television de Ouagadougou. FESPACO was recognized formally as an institution by governmental decree on January 7, 1972. Its award ceremony and base of operations is Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso, where the annual awards ceremony is also held. In 1972 the first winner of the best film award was Le Wazzou Polygame by Oumarou Ganda of Niger. Since then, the best film award has been won by directors from Cameroon, Morocco, Mali, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Algeria, Burkina Faso, Ghana and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. =Evolution from 1969 to 2017= At the festival's founding in 1969, five African nations: Upper Volta (Burkina Faso), Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Niger and Senegal, were represented, as well as France and the Netherlands. A total of 23 films were shown. At its second edition, the participant African countries rose to nine, including for the first time Algeria, Tunisia, Guinea, Mali, and Ghana, and a total of 40 films were shown. In 1983, the festival included MICA (le Marche International du Cinema et de la television Africaine), a market for African film stock and video footage. From 1985 onward, the festival adopted different themes for the annual event, starting with \\"the cinema, people, and liberation\\". The theme for the 2007 festival was \\"the actor in the creation and promotion of African films\\".Arte > FESPACO > Bala Hama. Festival de FESPACO. Interview Baba Hama.

Taylor died on October 26, 2006 in Laguna Beach, CA, from complications of a heart attack. Notable works =The Cay= The Cay, Taylor's story of a racially prejudiced white boy stranded with a black man, has become perhaps the most beloved of his young adult novels. It took only three weeks to complete, and has seen worldwide sales around four million. Taylor based the character of the boy in his book on a childhood friend. \\"The one thing I remembered about [him] was that his mother had taught him to hate black people and to hate them with a passion,\\" Taylor once told a reporter from the Los Angeles Times. In the book, the boy sheds his racist views as he learns to admire and respect the black man who had rescued him from the ocean, especially after he goes blind. For a short period of time The Cay was banned and was classified as racist. =Timothy of the Cay= In 1993, Taylor wrote and published the follow-up to The Cay, which he titled Timothy of the Cay. It describes the life of Timothy before his encounter with Phillip Enright, the narrator of The Cay, and what happened to Phillip after he was rescued, by which time Timothy had been dead for almost two months.

He was born at Castleton Manse, the son of Robert Armstrong, minister of Castleton, Roxburghshire, Scotland John studied medicine and gained his MD at the renowned University of Edinburgh (being the first to graduate 'with distinction' in 1732) before establishing a successful medical practice in London. John Armstrong is remembered as the friend of James Thomson, David Mallet, and other literary celebrities of the time, and as the author of a poem on The Art of Preserving Health, which appeared in 1744, and in which a somewhat unpromising subject for poetic treatment is gracefully and ingeniously handled. His other works, consisting of some poems and prose essays, and a drama, The Forced Marriage, are forgotten, with the exception of \\"The Oeconomy of Love\\" and the four stanzas at the end of the first part of Thomson's Castle of Indolence, describing the diseases incident to sloth, which he contributed. Under the pseudonym \\"Launcelot Temple, Esq\\", he published Sketches, or, Essays on Various Subjects in 1758. The \\"Oeconomy Of Love\\" has been described as an eighteenth-century guide to sex and is particularly interesting in that the lines: \\"To shed thy blossoms thro' the desert air, And sow thy perish'd offspring in the winds\\" are thought to be a possible inspiration for the more famous lines by Thomas Gray contained in his \\"Elegy Written in a Country Church-Yard\\" as follows: \\"Full many a flower is born to blush unseen, And waste its sweetness on the desert air.\\" However John Armstrong's use of floral metaphor in the \\"Oeconomy of Love\\" refers to the unnecessary shedding of semen whilst the author cautions young men against sexual practices that he condemns in his role as poet and physician. Strangely what must have been once the small town of Castleton, with a castle, church, manse, regular licensed markets and many homes has now totally disappeared. In the churchyard, however an obelisk stands to the memory of John Armstrong. It reads: \\"If yet thy shade delights to hover near The holy ground where oft thy sire hath taught, And where our fathers fondly flocked to hear Accept the offering which their sons have brought. Proud of the muse, which gave to classic fame Our vale and stream, to song before unknown; We raise this stone to bear thy deathless name, And tell the world that Armstrong was our own. To learning, worth, and genius such as thine, How vain the tribute monuments can pay! Thy name immortal with thy works shall shine, And live when frailer marble shall decay.\\" Of considerable note, also written on the same stone, in this deserted churchyard of a town or village of which nothing else remains, lies the further inscription: \\"In Memory of George Armstrong,M.D.,1720-1789, Brother of John the Poet. Doctor George Armstrong is the Father of modern Paediatrics, and the Founder of the World's First Hospital for Sick Children. He died in London where he had given his life for the children of the poor\\"  References  *The Border Magazine April 1926 *Liddesdale:Historical and Descriptive, by John Byers, 1952 *John McQueen and son, Galashiels Further reading External links * 18th-century Scottish medical doctors 18th-century Scottish writers 18th-century Scottish poets British medical writers 1709 births 1779 deaths Alumni of the University of Edinburgh ","title":"John Armstrong (poet)"},{"id":"1830689","text":"Richard Rodriguez (born July 31, 1944) is an American writer who became famous as the author of Hunger of Memory: The Education of Richard Rodriguez (1982), a narrative about his intellectual development.  Early life  He was born on July 31, 1944, into a Mexican immigrant family in San Francisco, California. Rodriguez spoke Spanish until he went to a Catholic school at 6. As a youth in Sacramento, California, he delivered newspapers and worked as a gardener. He graduated from Sacramento's Christian Brothers High School.  Career  Rodriguez received a B.A. from Stanford University, an M.A. from Columbia University, was a Ph.D. candidate in English Renaissance literature at the University of California, Berkeley, and attended the Warburg Institute in London on a Fulbright fellowship. A noted prose stylist, Rodriguez has worked as a teacher, international journalist, and educational consultant, and he has appeared regularly on the Public Broadcasting Service show, NewsHour. Rodriguez's visual essays, Richard Rodriguez Essays, on \\"The News Hour with Jim Lehrer\\" earned Rodriguez a Peabody Award in 1997. Rodriguez‚Äôs books include Hunger of Memory: The Education of Richard Rodriguez (1982), a collection of autobiographical essays; Mexico's Children (1990); Days of Obligation: An Argument With My Mexican Father (1992), which was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize; Brown: The Last Discovery of America (2002); and Darling: A Spiritual Autobiography (2013). Rodriguez's works have also been published in Harper's Magazine, Mother Jones, and Time. (Thomson Heinle) Instead of pursuing a career in academia, Rodriguez suddenly decided to write freelance and take other temporary jobs. Rodriguez worked as a contributing editor to newspapers and magazines, including Harpers and the Los Angeles Times.Perivolaris, J. D. (2001). Rodr√≠guez, Richard 1944- In M.

It was an account of his journey from being a \\"socially disadvantaged child\\" to becoming a fully assimilated American, from the Spanish-speaking world of his family to the wider, presumably freer, public world of English. However, the journey was not without costs: his American identity was achieved only after a painful separation from his past, his family, and his culture. \\"Americans like to talk about the importance of family values,\\" said Rodriguez. \\"But America isn't a country of family values; Mexico is a country of family values. This is a country of people who leave home.\\" While the book received widespread critical acclaim and won several literary awards, it also stirred resentment because of Rodriguez's strong stands against bilingual education and affirmative action. Some Mexican Americans called him pocho, Americanized Mexican, accusing him of betraying himself and his people. Others called him a \\"coconut,\\" brown on the outside, but white on the inside. He calls himself \\"a comic victim of two cultures.\\" Originally titled Crossing Borders - An Interview With Richard Rodriguez. Rodriguez's most recent book, Darling: A Spiritual Autobiography (2013), explores the important symbolism of the desert in Judaism, Islam and Christianity. In an interview before the book came out, Rodriguez reported that he was \\"interested in the fact that three great monotheistic religions were experienced within this ecology.\\"Rodriguez, Richard, \\"The God of the Desert\\" in The Best American Essays 2009, Ed. Mary Oliver (Mariner: Boston, 2009), 157 A sample of the project appeared in Harper's Magazine (January 2008). In this essay, \\"The God of the Desert: Jerusalem and the Ecology of Monotheism,\\" Rodriguez portrays the desert as a paradoxical temple, its emptiness the requisite for God's elusive presence.  Personal life  Rodriguez is gay. He came out in his book of essays Days of Obligation. Bibliography * Extract from *\\"Late Victorians\\" 1990.

The pensions, allowances, and benefits to which the survivors are entitled might have been adequate in the Soviet economy, but are inadequate to support a family in the new Russian economy.

Since then, the Society's charter has expanded to include the dependents of all sailors killed in submarine disasters  except those of Russian submarine K-141 Kursk. The Russian government has compensated families of Kursk sailors with at least US$32,000 and a free house in any town in Russia. This sum is orders of magnitude more generous than that provided to the dependents of any other Soviet or Russian submarine disaster, so the Society reserves its limited funds for those with the greatest need.

Willard Marriott Library is the main academic library of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, Utah. The university library has had multiple homes since the first University of Utah librarian was appointed in 1850. The current building was opened in 1968 and named for J. Willard Marriott, founder of Marriott International, in 1969. After two major renovations, the building is more than and houses more than 4.5 million volumes. The University of Utah Press and Red Butte Press are divisions of the Marriott Library. History The 1900 library as it appeared in the 1905 University of Utah Yearbook The first University of Utah librarian was appointed in 1850, the same year the school was founded. University president John R. Park opened a library and reading room stocked with his personal collection of books on loan to the university in 1874. The library moved to the LeRoy Cowles Building in 1900 and the George Thomas Library Building in 1935, both on Presidents Circle. The current five-story building was opened in 1968 and was named for J. Willard Marriott in 1969 when he contributed $1 million for library collections, the largest single contribution ever received by the university at that time. The library was expanded in 1996, which almost doubled the library's size, and was expanded again during a major renovation between 2005 and 2009. The purpose of this renovation was to improve the seismic stability of the building, provide clearer pathways through the building, improve environmental controls, and allow for more natural light. Several additions were also made to the building including an automated storage and retrieval system that can store up to 2 million items, a larger computer lab, additional classrooms and teaching labs, a new indoor caf√©, a rooftop garden, and additional study areas including the George S. Eccles Grand Reading Room. Collections The library's Special Collections department collects, preserves, and makes available books, periodicals, documents, photographs, films, and original materials, particularly those documenting the history of Utah, the Mormons, the West, the Middle East, and the University of Utah. These collections include the papers of Marriner Stoddard Eccles, Chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1934 to 1938; David O. McKay, ninth President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints; Leonidas Ralph Mecham, Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts from 1985 to 2006; and Wallace Stegner, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1972. Materials are accessible to all patrons, regardless of their status. The library hosts over 100 unique digital collections, many of which include items from Special Collections. Digital collections include USpace, Utah Digital Newspapers, the Western Soundscape Archive, and the Western Waters Digital Library. The library also hosts the Mountain West Digital Library, a digital collaborative program of the Utah Academic Library Consortium. The library provides access to print on demand books via an Espresso Book Machine. The Aziz S. Atiya Middle East Library, which is located in the Marriott Library, is named after the founder of the University of Utah Middle East Center, Aziz Suryal Atiya, and is the fifth largest library for Middle East studies in North America.

The Conference was established in April 1990, when governments of the world were discussing the dangers of global warming at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. The Conference is an educational organisation with the aim of educating people about the realities of the endangered environment and the inevitable catastrophic consequences if no proactive and preventive steps are taken. The project has reached many institutions and organisations all over the world, spreading the message Education for Preservation. The organisation has given birth to other initiatives, such as The Amazonia Society, the Amazonia Seminar, the Amazonia Experience, and the Amazonia Files. The Amazonia Conference is an educational organisation which, unlike other environmental organisations, focuses in education instead of radical campaigning. This does not mean that the organisation does not campaign. The organisation believes that it is effectively easier to 'form the minds of the young instead of attempting to amend adult ones.' Therefore, by educating the young, next generations will be equipped with environmentally aware citizens. The project also has a special division which visits companies and other organisations to educate their employees or members, on the current environmental issues which our planet is suffering due to human activities. The Amazonia Conference is considered to be the biggest educational project in Portugal (Di√°rio de Not√≠cias, 2000), and has recently received the British Airways Best Environmental Project Award 2004.  History  The Amazonia Conference was established in 1990 by Professor Valdir Bento, physicist and former head of NASA's Laser technology department. The project has developed into the leading educational project in Portugal, and is expanding to become one of the predominant environmental organisations in the United Kingdom.

It is particularly associated with the agricultural region in the Snake River Plain located in the area. The northern Magic Valley region ‚Äî particularly Blaine and Camas Counties ‚Äî is also known as the Wood River Valley after the Big Wood River. Demographics According to the 2010 Census the counties of the Magic Valley region had a combined population of 185,790, or nearly 12% of Idaho. Twin Falls is the region's largest city and metropolitan area. Burley is the principal city of the region's other micropolitan area. Other cities include Jerome, Rupert, Gooding, Wendell, Bliss, Hagerman and Hailey. History The name \\"Magic Valley\\" is a reference to the construction of Milner and Minidoka Dams and a series of irrigation canal systems (such as the Gooding Milner canal) on the Snake River during the first decade of the 20th century. In a short time these projects \\"magically\\" transformed what had been considered a nearly uninhabitable area into some of the most productive farmland in the northwestern U.S. Many cities and towns in the region were founded between 1900 and 1910 as a direct result of these projects. Education The College of Southern Idaho (CSI) in Twin Falls is the Magic Valley's only college. Most of the region's cities and towns support separate public school districts. Culture Cultural events are routinely held at CSI. County fairs are held throughout the region in the late summer, the largest being the Twin Falls County Fair in Filer during the week immediately preceding Labor Day. The Sun Valley resort in Blaine County hosts several attractions throughout the year. The town of Hagerman hosts a large blues fest in September. The Magic Valley is home to the Magic Valley Arts Council, a non-profit umbrella arts organization that serves the greater Twin Falls area and surrounding 8-county Magic Valley region. The organization's mission is to foster and promote experiences in the arts for all people in the Greater Twin Falls. It is an association of arts organizations, individuals, educational institutions and businesses looking for opportunities to improve the quality of life in the Magic Valley area by providing arts and cultural opportunities. Annual events and programs include Kids Art in the Park, Arts on Tour, Brown Bag Lecture Series, theatrical productions, the Full Moon Gallery of Fine Art and Contemporary Craft, public art projects and many others. Leisure Popular leisure activities in the Magic Valley include camping, hunting and fishing. Skiing at several resorts throughout the region is one of the most popular winter activities. Jackpot, Nevada, which is closely associated with the Magic Valley region, offers casino gaming. The Perrine Bridge draws many BASE jumpers from around the world. It is the only man-made structure in the USA that is legally jumpable without a permit.

This requirement contrasts with right in some other jurisdictions to stand one's ground, meaning being allowed to defend one's self instead of retreating. It is a specific component which sometimes appears in the criminal defense of self-defense, and which must be addressed if criminal defendants are to prove that their conduct was justified. United States law Most U.S. jurisdictions have a stand-your-ground law enacted or in practice, with only Washington, D.C. requiring a person to retreat from an attack and allow the use of deadly force in self-defense only when retreat is not possible, or when retreat poses a danger to the person under attack.See, e.g., State v. Abbott, 36 N.J. 63, 71-72 174 A.2d 881 (1961) (\\"[D]eadly force is not justifiable \\"if the actor knows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety by retreating.\\"); Commonwealth v. Eberle, 474 Pa. 548, 557-58, 379 A.2d 90 (1977) (\\"[T]he prosecution had a duty to establish that the appellant knew that she could avoid the necessity of using deadly force with complete safety by retreating... Because the prosecution has failed to show that the only escape route which appellant possibly could have used to avoid the confrontation could have been used without increasing the risk of injury to which she was already exposed, it has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant violated any duty to retreat.\\") The duty to retreat is not universal, however. For example, police officers are not required to retreat when acting in the line of duty. Other states apply what is known as the castle doctrine, whereby a threatened person need not retreat within his or her own dwelling or place of work. Sometimes this has been the result of court rulings that one need not retreat in a place where one has a special right to be.State v. Allery, 101 Wash. 2d 591, 682 P.2d 312 (1984). In other states, this has been accomplished by statute, such as that suggested by the Model Penal Code¬ß 3.04(2)(b)(ii). Still other states have passed stand your ground laws that do not require an individual to retreat and allow one to match force for force, deadly force for deadly force. Most state legal systems began by importing English Common Law such as Acts of Parliament of 2 Ed. III (Statute of Northampton), and 5 Rich. II of 1381 (Forcible Entry Act 1381)‚Äîwhich imposed criminal sanctions intending to discourage the resort to self-help.See Daluiso v. Boone, 71 Cal.2d 484, 455 P.2d 811 (1969) for English common law history. This required a threatened party to retreat, whenever property was \\"involved\\" and resolve the issue by civil means. Today, the majority of American states have construed their statutes of forcible entry, both penal and civil, in such a manner as to abrogate (i.e. abolish) the common law privilege to use force in the recovery of possession of land.1 Harper and James, op.cit. supra, at ¬ß 3.15, p. 258; Prosser, Law of Torts (3d ed. 1964) ¬ß 23, p. 125.

In Erwin v. State (1876), the Supreme Court of Ohio wrote that a \\"true man\\", one without fault, would not retreat.No Duty to Retreat:Violence and Values in American History and Society 4030 (1991) In Runyan v. State (1877), the Indiana court rejected a duty to retreat, implying it was un- American, writing of a referring to the distinct American mind, \\"the tendency of the American mind seems to be very strongly against\\" a duty to retreat. The court went further in saying that no statutory law could require a duty to retreat, because the right to stand one's ground is \\"founded on the law of nature; and is not, nor can be, superseded by any law of society.\\" English law In English law the focus of the test is whether the defendant is acting reasonably in the particular situation. There is no specific requirement that a person must retreat in anticipation of an attack. Although some withdrawal would be useful evidence to prove that the defendant did not want to fight, not every defendant is able to escape. In R v Bird the defendant was physically attacked, and reacted instinctively and immediately without having the opportunity to retreat. Had there been a delay in the response, the reaction might have appeared more revenge than self-defense.R v Bird (1985) 1 WLR 816 =Carrying weapons= As to carrying weapons in anticipation of an attack, Evans v Hughes held that for a defendant to justify his possession of a metal bar on a public highway, he had to show that there was an imminent particular threat affecting the particular circumstances in which the weapon was carried.Evans v Hughes (1972) 3 A ER 412 Similarly, in Taylor v Mucklow a building owner was held to be using an unreasonable degree of force in carrying a loaded airgun against a builder who was demolishing a new extension because his bills were unpaid.Taylor v Mucklow (1973) CLR 750 More dramatically, in AG's Reference (No 2 of 1983) Lord Lane held that a defendant who manufactured ten petrol bombs to defend his shop during the Toxteth riots could set up the defense of showing that he possessed an explosive substance \\"for a lawful purpose\\" if he could establish that he was acting in self- defense to protect himself or his family or property against an imminent and apprehended attack by means which he believed to be no more than reasonably necessary to meet the attack.Attorney General's Reference (No 2 of 1983) (1984) 1 AER 988 See alsoCastle doctrine in the United States *Stand- your-ground law *Trespasser References Further reading   *Brown, Richard Maxwell (1991).

Made with the cooperation of the Greek government, it was shot in the village of Perachora in the Peloponnese. The working title was Lion of Sparta. It stars Richard Egan as the Spartan king Leonidas, Sir Ralph Richardson as Themistocles of Athens and David Farrar as Persian king Xerxes, with Diane Baker as Ellas and Barry Coe as Phylon providing the requisite romantic element in the film. Greek warriors, led by 300 Spartans, fight against a Persian army of almost limitless size. Despite the odds, the Spartans will not flee or surrender, even if it means their deaths. When it was released in 1962, critics saw the movie as a commentary on the Cold War, referring to the independent Greek states as \\"the only stronghold of freedom remaining in the then known world\\", holding out against the Persian \\"slave empire\\". Plot King Xerxes of Persia leads a vast army of soldiers into Europe to defeat the small city-states of Greece, not only to fulfill the idea of \\"one world ruled by one master\\", but also to avenge the defeat of his father Darius at the Battle of Marathon ten years before. Accompanying him are Artemisia, the Queen of Halicarnassus, who beguiles Xerxes with her feminine charm, and Demaratus, an exiled king of Sparta, to whose warnings Xerxes pays little heed. In Corinth, Themistocles of Athens wins the support of the Greek allies and convinces both the delegates and the Spartan representative, warrior king Leonidas I, to grant Sparta leadership of their forces. Outside the hall, Leonidas and Themistocles agree to fortify the narrow pass at Thermopylae until the rest of the army arrives. After this, Leonidas learns of the Persian advance and travels to Sparta to spread the news and rally the rest of the troops. In Sparta, his fellow king Leotychidas is fighting a losing battle with the Ephors over the religious harvest festival of Carnea that is due to take place, with members of the council arguing that the army should wait until after the festival is over before it marches, while Leotychidas fears that by that time the Persians may have conquered Greece. Leonidas decides to march north immediately with his personal bodyguard of 300 men, who are exempt from the decisions of the Ephors and the Gerousia. They are subsequently reinforced by about 700 volunteer Thespians led by Demophilus and few other Greek allies. After several days of fighting, Xerxes grows angry as his army is repeatedly routed by the Greeks, with the Spartans in the forefront. Leonidas receives word sent by his wife that, by decision of the Ephors, the remainder of the Spartan army, rather than joining him as he had expected, will only fortify the isthmus in the Peloponnese and will advance no further. The Greeks constantly beat back the Persians, and following the defeat of most of his personal bodyguard in battle against the Spartans plus the killing/death of Xerxes' own two brothers, Xerxes begins to consider withdrawing to Sardis until he can equip a larger force at a later date. As he prepares to withdraw, as advised by Artemesia (who, having a Greek mother, has her own agenda to dissuade the king from continuing invasion), Xerxes however, receives word from the treacherous and avaricious Ephialtes of a secret old goat-track through the mountains that will enable his forces to attack the Greeks from the rear. Promising to richly reward the traitorous goatherd for his betrayal (just as Ephialtes had expected) an emboldened Xerxes sends his army onward. Once Leonidas realizes he will be surrounded, he sends away the Greek allies to alert the cities to the south. Being too few to hold the pass, the Spartans instead attack the Persian front, where Xerxes is nearby. Leonidas is killed in the mel√©e. Meanwhile, the Thespians, who had refused to leave, are overwhelmed (offscreen) while defending the rear. Surrounded, the surviving Spartans refuse Xerxes's demand to give up Leonidas' body. They are then all annihilated as the remaining Immortals rain down a barrage of arrowfire. After this, narration states that the Battle of Salamis and the Battle of Plataea end the Persian invasion, which could not have been organized and victorious without the time bought by the 300 Spartans who defied the tyranny of Xerxes at Thermopylae. One of the final images of the film is the stone memorial bearing the epigram of Simonides of Ceos, which the narrator recites in honour of the slain 300 Spartan men's bravery : \\"Oh stranger, tell the Spartans that we lie here obedient to their word.\\" Then ends with : \\"...But it was more than a victory for Greece, it was a stirring example to free people throughout the world of what a few brave men can accomplish once they refuse to submit to tyranny!\\" Main castRichard Egan as King Leonidas of Sparta *Ralph Richardson as Themistocles of Athens *Diane Baker as Ellas, daughter of Pentheus *Barry Coe as Phyllon, Spartan in love with Ellas *David Farrar as King Xerxes of Persia *Donald Houston as Hydarnes, leader of the Persian Immortals *Anna Synodinou as Queen Gorgo of Sparta *Kieron Moore as Ephialtes of Trachis, farm worker & Greek traitor *John Crawford as Agathon, Spartan spy and soldier *Robert Brown as Pentheus, Leonidas' second-in-command *Laurence Naismith a Greek delegate *Anne Wakefield as Artemisia, Queen of Halicarnassus *Ivan Triesault as Demaratus, exiled former King of Sparta *Charles Fernley Fawcett as Megistias, Spartan priest *Michalis Nikolinakos as Myron, a Spartan *Sandro Giglio as Xenathon, a Spartan Ephor *Dimos Starenios as Samos, a goatherd *Anna Raftopoulou as Toris, Samos' wife *Yorgos Moutsios as Demophilus, leader of the Thespians *Nikos Papakonstantinou as Grellas, a Spartan in Xerxes' camp *John G.

The Greek Defense Ministry agreed to make available to the producers up to 5,000 members of the Hellenic Army for a pre-negotiated fee. However, the film's budgetary constraints reduced the numbers drawn to only two battalions (approximately 1,100 men). The largest establishing scenes, of the Persian Army entering Greece, utilized many of these soldiers, together with a combined total of several hundred civilian extras, horses, cattle, ox carts, and chariots. For the wider establishing scenes of the battle, one battalion was retained to play both Greeks and Persians. For closer compositions of the fighting and encampments, military extras were called (call-sheeted) by company-size or smaller units, in meeting the specific needs of the day's shooting schedule. Director of Photography Geoffrey Unsworth made good use of the tree groves, which lined the coastal plain aside the Limni Vouliagmeni lagoon, to cover for the obvious deficiency in the number of troops that would have been amassed on the Persian-side of the battle line. Originally developed as an Italian sword- and-sandal project, the cooperation and blessing of the Greek government allowed the producers to both finance and complete the production on a budget of 500,000 GBP () or approximately US$1,350,000 (), roughly twice for what most Italian peplum films were being made at the time. The 300 Spartans was the last film of Richard Egan's seven-year contract with 20th Century Fox. It was also the last film appearance of David Farrar, who then chose to retire from acting. Release In 1970, despite the attributed Cold War connotations, the film was dubbed in Russian and shown in the USSR. The film proved to be very popular, with 27.1 million total viewers.Kinopoisk.ru.

He was the first thinker to introduce the Traditionalist School of Ren√© Gu√©non to Hungary. Biography B√©la Hamvas was born on 23 March 1897 in Eperjes (Pre≈°ov), in the S√°ros County of the Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Slovakia). His father, J√≥zsef Hamvas was a Lutheran pastor, teacher of German and Hungarian, journalist and writer. The family moved to Pozsony (Bratislava) in 1898, where Hamvas completed his basic studies in 1915. After graduation, like his classmates, he entered voluntary military service and was sent to the front in Ukraine. He was sent back to Budapest for hospital treatment due to severe traumatic shock, but just after recovery, he was drafted to the front line in western Italy. He never reached the battlefield, as his train was hit by a shell, and the wounded Hamvas was discharged. In 1919 his father refused an oath of allegiance to the new nation of Czechoslovakia, whereupon his family was expelled from Bratislava. They moved to Budapest, where Hamvas attended P√©ter P√°zm√°ny Catholic University. After graduation he became a journalist at the newspapers Budapesti H√≠rlap and Sz√≥zat. Hamvas considered this job shallow and menial, but he had to support his family (although his father received a pension from 1924). Three years later he quit, as he had found a better job in the main library of Budapest. He was appointed as a senior librarian in 1927. By this time he was writing articles, reviews and essays for 25 different journals. He married Ilona Angyal in 1929, but divorced in 1936 to marry Katalin Kem√©ny in 1937. She was his partner in founding the Sziget circle, a literary group which later gained prominent members like Antal Szerb, K√°roly Ker√©nyi, L√°szl√≥ N√©meth, or Antal Moln√°r. Nearly 20 years of library work was ended by World War II. Hamvas was drafted for military service three times. He continued his literary work while on the front lines - translating Laozi and Heraclitus among others. His first essay collection was published in 1943. The couple survived the siege of Budapest. Their apartment was hit by bombing, destroying his library and manuscripts. Despite the Soviet siege and repeated harassment by the authorities, 1945 to 1947 were his most fruitful years. In 1948 he was placed on the b-list (banned from publishing) by the Soviet installed socialist government, and was forced into retirement from his library job. Although he had published more than 250 works before his ban, most of Hamvas's body of work was written anonymously later on. He got a licence to farm in the garden of his brother-in-law in Szentendre, and tended plants there between 1948 and 1951, during which time he also completed Karnev√°l, one of his major essays. Between 1951 and 1964 he was employed as an unskilled worker in power plants in Tiszapalkonya, Inota and Bokod, under harsh conditions. Whenever he had spare time he translated from Sanskrit, Hebrew and Greek, and wrote about the Cabala, Zen, and Sufism. Between 1959 and 1966 he completed Patmosz, his last major work. Aged 67, he finally received a pension. B√©la Hamvas died of a hemorrhagic stroke in 1968. He is buried in Szentendre. In 1990 he posthumously received the Kossuth Prize. Literature He was a great thinker and essayist who integrated Eastern and Western traditions as well as posing many serious questions about the modern age, together with the possibility of resolving them. According to one of his central thoughts: \\"The present eon, since 600 B.C. stands in the sign of personal salvation. Only since this time is there a notion of humanity, because there is only one single collective category of personality and this is humanity.\\" B√©la Hamvas found his form of expression in the essay, a genre at once literary and philosophical. His early essays were published in Magyar H√ºperion (1936, Hungarian Hyperion), marking the end of his first period of thinking, to be followed by Szellem √©s egzisztencia (1941, Spirit and Existence), an essay discussing the philosophy of Karl Jaspers, one of the main inspirations for Hamvas‚Äô thinking. He published a selection of essays on literature, psychology, philosophy and cultural history in A l√°thatatlan t√∂rt√©net (1943, The Invisible Story). Analyzing the spiritual crisis of the age, Hamvas read himself into the metaphysical tradition, the collective spiritual knowledge of humanity conveyed by sacred books. His collection Scientia Sacra (the first six volumes, 1942‚Äì43) served to direct the attention of the age towards the philosophy of the Far East (The Upanishads, Tao Te King, The Tibetan Book of the Dead and others) and European mysticism. From 1945 Hamvas belonged to the spiritual renaissance for three years, during which time he edited the series Leaflets of the University Press, held lectures and published the metaphysical Anthologia humana: √ñtezer √©v b√∂lcsess√©ge (1946, Human Anthology ‚Äì The Wisdom of Five Millennia), the fourth edition of which was banned and pulped by the socialist regime. His essays written together with his wife on the history of art Forradalom a m≈±v√©szetben: Absztrakci√≥ √©s sz√ºrrealizmus Magyarorsz√°gon (1947, Revolution in Art: Abstraction and Surrealism in Hungary) survey Hungarian art from K√°roly Ferenczy, Tivadar Csontv√°ry Kosztka and Lajos Gul√°csy up to the activity of the ‚ÄúEuropean School‚Äù. Hamvas saw in surrealism and abstract art the heritage of magic, the ‚Äútremendous presence of a higher existence‚Äù, and opposed ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù art. This concept of modern art was attacked by the Marxist ideologist, Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs, and Hamvas was dismissed from the library and silenced for the rest of his life. His writings were published in samizdat. His essays are grounded in tradition, their sense of humour is granted by knowledge, and humour, in turn, grants their freedom. Unicornis, Titkos Jegyz≈ëk√∂nyv, Silentium (1948‚Äì51, Unicorn, Secret Protocol, Silence) were published as late as 1987, but were written alongside Hamvas‚Äôs great novel, Karnev√°l (1948‚Äì51, Carnival, published in 1985). This Magnum Opus, also called a ‚Äúcatalogue of fate‚Äù, a ‚Äúhuman comedy‚Äù, spans continents and ages, Heaven and Hell. Hamvas‚Äô three shorter novels, Szilveszter (1957, New Year‚Äôs Eve), Bizonyos tekintetben (1961, From a Certain Aspect) and Ugyanis (1966‚Äì67, Therefore) were published together in 1991, followed by his collection of essays, Patmosz (1959‚Äì1966; Patmos) in 1992, whose title alludes to John the Apostle‚Äôs exile to the island of Patmos, and the second part of Scientia Sacra: az ≈ëskori emberis√©g szellemi hagyom√°nya II. r√©sz: A kereszt√©nys√©g (1960‚Äì64, Sacred Science ‚Äì Spiritual Heritage of Mankind, part II.

A devout churchman, learned scholar, and reforming schoolmaster, Sewell was strongly influenced by the Tractarians. Early life Born on the Newport, Isle of Wight, the second son of a solicitor and Fellow of The Queen's College, Oxford, he had six brothers, four of whom became national figures. Richard Clarke Sewell was a recognised poet, legal writer and Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford. Henry Sewell worked in the family firm before emigrating to become Premier of New Zealand. James Edwards Sewell was Warden of New College, Oxford (1860‚Äì1903). Elizabeth Missing Sewell wrote devotional religious books and children's stories. She founded Ventnor St Boniface School for girls. Sewell was educated at Winchester, which he disliked because he was bullied. He went up to Merton College, Oxford, where he gained a postmastership and a first in Literae Humaniores. He was elected a Petreian Fellow of Exeter College in 1827, and then won both the Chancellor's English Essay Prize and the Chancellor's Latin Essay Prize. Still aged only twenty-six, he was ordained. From 1831 to 1853 he was a tutor there, an Examiner in Greats, Librarian to the College, Sub-Rector, and by 1839 also Dean. Tractarians In 1835 he tried for the Headmastership of Winchester, but was defeated by Dr Moberley by one vote. From 1836 to 1841 he was White's Professor of Moral Philosophy. Sewell, who took holy orders in 1830, aged only twenty-six, was a friend of Pusey, Newman, Keble and R. H. Froude in the earlier days of the Tractarian movement, but subsequently considered that the Tractarians leaned too much towards Rome, and dissociated himself from them. His novel Hawkstone was opposed to Newman's position at the time. When, however, in 1849, JA Froude published his Nemesis of Faith, Sewell denounced the wickedness of the book to his class, and, when one of his pupils confessed to the possession of a copy, seized it, tore it to pieces, and threw it in the fire. He was a prolific writer of numerous sermons, commentaries, poetry and translations. He also had a large number of correspondents, including William Gladstone. He contributed to the political Quarterly Review on various subjects that interested him. Sewell was supremely confident, had a winning manner, but lacked the droll humour of the cloistered academics.Tuckwell, Oxford Reminiscences St Columba's In April 1843 he, with some friends, Monsell and Todd, founded at Stackallan House, County Meath, St Columba's College, designed to be a sort of Irish Winchester and Eton \\"and something more than Winchester or Eton.\\" In 1861 the Clarendon Commission defined it as a public school, but Sewells aim was to provide an Anglican education for the ailing Church in Ireland, with emphasis on pastoral care and rigorous classical disciplines. The school was supported by the nobility and church. From Lord Boyne Singleton and Sewell rented the land with conspicuous approval of the Archbishop of Armagh, Lord George de la Poer Beresford, the College's Governor. Set in beautiful countryside Sewell hoped to inspire boys in locis parentis, give them cubicles to live in, and \\"strengthen, enlarge and purify their minds.\\"Sewell, \\"Reminiscences\\" With the classics they were to teach modern languages, modern history and mathematics, drawing, architecture and the Irish language. Sewell was disliked at St Columba's. In spite of his trips to raise much-needed funds, they had shown bad faith towards a financial supporter who brought much furniture and silver to the College.G. K. White, A History of St Columba's, p. 27. His connections at Oxford, particularly Magdalen College, were useful. Another substantial Sewell contribution was a large library collection. His colleagues wanted a more relaxed Irish Gaelic school, whereas he was known to have punished boys for failing to show good table manners befitting young gentlemen. Cold showers and hard beatings were necessary, but Sewell believed the most dreaded exclusion to be from chapel. Emphasis on regular attendance at Evensong and Matins was central to his scholastic vision of a High Church interpretation of the Book of Common Prayer. While he also gained a reputation for high standards of cleanliness and medical health. Singleton agreed with Sewell that there must be fasting and feast days, but this offended Irish Protestant sensibilities. The Fellows Lord Adare and William Monsell converted to Roman Catholicism. In May 1846 he resigned with Warden Singleton to return to Oxford and Exeter College, having been outvoted by the Fellows of St Columba's. Singleton met in Turl Street to discuss the opening of another college. On 9 June 1847, he helped to found Radley College, installing Singleton as Warden. Sewell's intention was that each of these schools should be conducted on strict High Church principles. Sewell was originally himself one of the managers of St Columba's, and later the third Warden of Radley, but his business management was not successful in either case, and his personal responsibility for the debts contracted by Radley caused the sequestration of his Oxford fellowship. In 1862 his financial difficulties compelled him to leave England for Germany, and he did not return till 1870.

This article is about an indigenous tribe located in central Minnesota. For the indigenous tribe located in northern northwestern Ontario, please see Sandy Lake First Nation. Sandy Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa (Ojibwe: Gaa-mitaawangaagamaag-ininiwag) are a historical Ojibwa tribe located in the upper Mississippi River basin, on and around Big Sandy Lake in what today is in Aitkin County, Minnesota. Though politically folded into the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, thus no longer independently federally recognized, for decades, Sandy Lake Band members have been leading efforts to restore their independent Federal recognition. History =Pre- treaty/Early Treaty Times= Since the earliest of days, Gaa- mitaawangaagamaag, as the Sandy Lake is known in Anishinaabemowin or the Chippewa language, acted as a commercial hub in both east-west trade (via Savanna Portage) and north-south trade (via the Mississippi River). Originally, the area occupied by the Sandy Lake Band was inhabited by the Gros Ventres (Atsina) Tribe. Approximately 1,600 years ago, the Nakota Sioux advancing northward displaced the Gros Ventres westward. With the arrival of the Chippewa approximately 800 years ago, conflicts between the Assiniboine and the Chippewa pursued. By the time the French fur traders made contact in the Sandy Lake region, the Sandy Lake Band had near full control of the area's trade routes. By the time of the arrival of the European settlers around Sandy Lake, the Sandy Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa became the instrumental tribe controlling the Savanna Portage trade-route that connected the Lake Superior and east with the Mississippi River and west. Sandy Lake Band became a treaty signatory to the 1787 British Treaty of Peace with the Dakota, Chippewa and Winnebago. Then starting with the 1825 First Treaty of Prairie du Chien, Sandy Lake Band became treaty signatory to it and other successive treaties with the United States. =Sandy Lake Tragedy= Due to last-minute changes in the annual annuity payments from a central region around La Pointe, Wisconsin, to not so central but as well known location of Sandy Lake in the fall of 1850, representatives from 19 Chippewa bands packed up and started an arduous journey to the shores of Sandy Lake, where they had been told to gather in late October for annual annuity payments and supplies. As it turned out, the annuity payments and supplies were late in coming to Sandy Lake, and the people had to wait until early December before they received the limited sums of money and available supplies. Trying to survive on spoiled and inadequate government rations while waiting for the annuities, about 150 Chippewa people died from dysentery and measles at Sandy Lake. Another 230-250 died en route home. As a result of this tragedy, the Mississippi Chippewa Bands agreed to the establishment of Chippewa Reservations. Sandy Lake Indian Reservation was established in 1855, together with other Mississippi Chippewa Reservations of Lake Pokegama, Rabbit Lake, Gull Lake and Mille Lacs Lake. The same treaty established the Rice Lake Reservation, but due to the Bureau of Land Management claims of the Rice Lake Reservation being within the boundaries of the Sandy Lake Reservation, the Rice Lake Reservation was never formally platted. =Dakota War of 1862= The Sandy Lake Band remained neutral during the Dakota War of 1862 against the United States. Due to this neutrality, the Sandy Lake Band were not forced to relocated to what eventually became the White Earth Reservation in Northwestern Minnesota, though the Band members were socially pressured to relocate and many did. Those who did relocate became the Removable Sandy Lake Band while those who remained became the Non-removable Sandy Lake Band. The Removable Sandy Lake Band members first relocated to Pokegama Lake Indian Reservation near Grand Rapids, Minnesota. Though friction developed between the Pillager Bands of Chippewa and the Mississippi Bands of Chippewa when most of the Mississippi Chippewa reservations were dissolved with all residences relocated to the area surrounding the original Leech Lake Indian Reservation, while all other removable Mississippi Chippewa Bands negotiated relocation to a less hostile area to form the White Earth Indian Reservation, the Pokegama Lake Band and some of the Removable Sandy Lake Band negotiated to remain in the area, forming the White Oak Point Band on the White Oak Point Indian Reservation in 1873, which in 1934 merged with the Leech Lake and other bands of the 5 contiguous Indian Reservations in the area to form the contemporary Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe and the \\"Greater\\" Leech Lake Indian Reservation. =Loss of Independent Recognition= When plans were being negotiated by the United States in 1887 to consolidate all the Ojibwe bands scattered about Minnesota, including the Sandy Lake Band, to the White Earth Indian Reservation, the commission for these plans, after an unsuccessful meeting with the Mille Lacs Indians and on their way to meet with the Fond du Lac Band, stopped to meet with the Sandy Lake Band, but again without success in negotiations, as they learned later the Sandy Lake Band had purposely avoided the meeting.49th-2nd- Ex.Doc.115, p. 19 In 1889 with the passage of the Indian Allotment Act to officially relocate all scattered Ojibwe bands in Minnesota to the White Earth Indian Reservation, the Treaty-established Sandy Lake Reservation of approximately 27 mi¬≤ (70 km¬≤) was erased from the maps, forcing the Non- removable Sandy Lake Band to be a federally recognized tribe without a reservation. On 4 March 1915, President Woodrow Wilson issued an Executive Order to set aside a tract of land within the Sandy Lake Indian Reservation for the Fond du Lac Band along the banks of the Sandy Lake. In addition, on August 24, 1940, Sandy Lake community managed to secure 147 acres (59.5 ha) parcel of land adjacent to the northeast corner of the original reservation for the benefit of the Sandy Lake Band, and other small tracts of land within the original Sandy Lake Reservation area. However, in 1980, the Bureau of Indian Affairs issued a Solicitor's Opinion that the Executive Order re- established a reservation at Sandy Lake and that the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe is empowered to exercise control over the reservation. The Non-removable Sandy Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa lost their independent federal recognition under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 when the Bureau of Indian Affairs approved the constitution of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, which grouped all the scattered bands in the Mille Lacs region to form the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, and then placing their lands under the auspices of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, as Mille Lacs Reservation District II. Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, according to the Bureau of Indian Affairs-approved constitution, thence comprised the Non-removable and Removable Mille Lacs Indians of the Mille Lacs Lake Reservation, Non-removable Sandy Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa of the Sandy Lake Reservation, Rice Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa, and the Snake River and Kettle River Chippewa Communities of the St. Croix Chippewa Indians. During the early years of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, each of the historical Bands that formed the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe had a representative on the new amalgamated Band's tribal council known as the Reservation Business Committee (RBC). However, after the a significant revision to the RBC structure, allowing for only one elected representative from each RBC district, Sandy Lake Band was faced with losing full representation. In protest, many Sandy Lake Tribal members dis-enrolled from the Mille Lacs Band and formally began the process of regaining independent Federal recognition. Sandy Lake Tribal members continued to reside on the original Sandy Lake Indian Reservation lands and many did not receive any tribal services or housing because the many Sandy Lake tribal members were not enrolled in the Mille Lacs Band. When the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe became a Gaming Compact Tribe in 1988, a large rush of eligible enrollees attempted to enroll with the Mille Lacs Band. Some Sandy Lake Band members who dis-enrolled and never re- enrolled elsewhere were eligible to re-enroll with the Mille Lacs Band. Sandy Lake Band members who dis-enrolled from the Mille Lacs Band and re-enrolled elsewhere were automatically excluded from dis-enrolling from their new tribe to re-enroll with the Mille Lacs Band. Meanwhile, the Sandy Lake Band members who dis-enrolled from the Mille Lacs Band without re-enrolling elsewhere continued to struggle with their effort to re-gain their independent Federal recognition. =Sandy Lake Band Today= Each of the component historical Bands and communities forming the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe still form very distinct tribal entities from each other, each with separate tribal histories‚ÄîSandy Lake Band is no exception. Today, the Sandy Lake Band community is primarily located along the north-shore of Sandy Lake while the Mille Lacs Band's Sandy Lake community is primarily located along the south- shore of Sandy Lake near Lake Minnewawa. For nearly thirty years, many Sandy Lake Band members continue to lead efforts to restore their independent federal recognition while others fully participate in the Mille Lacs Band tribal government process. Independent federal recognition status is often resisted by the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe members who urge the Sandy Lake Band to first hold regular government sessions with minutes recording their proceedings, such that the Sandy Lake Band may provide documented evidence of regular and consistent government sessions. Sandy Lake Band, in conjunction with their efforts to restore independent federal recognition, have pursued both county and state recognition. The Sandy Lake Band was recognized by Aitkin County, Minnesota in 1992 and affirmed of the recognition in 1996. For the State recognition process, bills have been sent to the Minnesota legislatures in 1997, 1999 and 2000, failing each time by a narrow margin of votes.

They are heavy-boned with thick legs and are used for draft work. Their history reaches back to Ancient Rome, and throughout the years blood from several other breeds has been added to the Ardennes, although only the Belgian breed had any significant impact. The first Ardennes were imported to the United States in the early 20th century, and the first breed registry was established in Europe in 1929. The horses have been used throughout history as war horses, both as cavalry mounts and to draw artillery, and are used today mainly for heavy draft and farm work, meat production and competitive driving events. They have also been used to influence or create several other horse breeds throughout Europe and Asia.  History  Grazing Ardennes Their history reaches back to Ancient Rome. The Ardennes breed could be a direct descendant of the prehistoric Solutr√© horse, and is claimed to be descended from the type of horse described by Julius Caesar in his Commentarii de Bello Gallico. Caesar described these horses of Belgium as \\"rustic, hard and tireless\\", and recommended them for use in heavy cavalry units. The early type was used by many later Roman emperors for military applications. The breed's ancestors are thought to have been bred for 2,000 years on the Ardennes plains, and it is one of the oldest documented European heavy draft breeds. In the Roman era, the breed stood only around high. Later, Napoleon added Arabian blood to increase stamina and endurance and used the breed in his Russian campaign. In 1780, the breed still stood only and weighed around . Percheron, Boulonnais and Thoroughbred blood were also added, although they had little impact. In the 19th century, Belgian draft blood was added to give the breed the heavier conformation it has today. The extra weight and size was desired to turn the breed into a very heavy draft breed, after their role as an artillery horse had diminished through the advent of mechanization, as well as a desire for a meat animal. The breed increased in size from an average of to their current weight, which at the same time had the consequence of reducing their vigor and endurance. The first breed registry was established in Europe in 1929. Today there are 3 separate studbooks in France, Belgium and Luxembourg, although there is extensive interbreeding between all three. The Ardennes Horse Society of Great Britain was also formed in the late 20th century to preserve and promote Ardennes horses in Great Britain, but today is not recognized as a studbook or passport issuing organization by the British government and may not exist in any form. The first Ardennes were imported to the United States in the early 20th century, but it is still not known precisely when. Originally, when imported to the United States, Ardennes horses were eligible for registration with the now-defunct National French Draft Horse Association of America or French Draft Horse Society. This organization published a stud book and registered six individual French draft breeds as belonging to a single breed, combining the information so that no totals of individual breeds are known. Many of these horses were imported to the United States with their breed being considered simply \\"French draft\\" and no individual type being specified. Some Ardennes horses imported to the United States before 1917 were called Belgians when they were imported and subsequently registered as Belgians. Ardennes horses have continued to be imported into the United States from Belgium, with imports occurring as late as 2004.  Characteristics  In France, Ardennes stallions stand about high, and mares about , while in Belgium these are the maximum allowable heights.Standard de la race Stud-Book du Cheval de Trait Ardennais (in French) Accessed August 2011 \\"Breed standard\\" They weigh .L'Ardennais Union des √©leveurs de chevaux de la race ardennaise. Les Haras Nationaux, 2010. (in French) Accessed August 2011 \\"The Ardennais\\" Their heads are heavy, with a broad face and a straight or slightly convex profile. Their conformation is broad and muscular, with a compact body, short back, and short, sturdy legs with strong joints. Their fetlocks are feathered. Their coats may be bay, roan, chestnut, gray, or palomino. Bay and roan are the two most common colors. Black is very rare and is excluded from registration. White markings are small, usually restricted to a star or blaze. The breed matures early, and they are said to be easy keepers, economical to feed despite their size. The Ardennes is a free-moving, long-striding breed, despite their compact body structure.  Uses  An Ardennes horse in harness Horses from the Ardennes region were used as war horses in the Crusades in the 11th century by knights led by Godfrey of Bouillon. They were used during the 17th century by Marshal Turenne as remounts for his cavalry. In the French Revolution, they were considered to be the best artillery horse available, due to their temperament, stamina and strength. Napoleon used large numbers of Ardennes horses to pull artillery and transport supplies during his 1812 Russian campaign. They were said to be the only breed used by Napoleon that was hardy enough to withstand the winter retreat from Moscow, which they did while pulling a large amount of the army's wagon train. They were also used to pull artillery in World War I, when they were depended upon by the French and Belgian armies. Their calm, tolerant disposition, combined with their active and flexible nature, made them an ideal artillery horse. The breed was considered so useful and valuable that when the Germans established the Commission for the Purchase of Horses in October 1914 to capture Belgian horses, the Ardennes was one of two breeds specified as important, the other being the Brabant. Today, the breed is used mainly for meat, due to its extensive musculature. Horse meat is a dietary staple in many European countries, including France, Belgium, Germany and Switzerland. However, they are increasingly used for farm, forest and leisure work. Their nimble action, stamina and good temper make them increasingly used for competitive driving across Europe, and they have also been used as mounts for therapeutic horseback riding. The breed is known for its ability to work in rough, hilly terrain. Ardennes horses have been used as foundation bloodstock to develop several other draft horse breeds and subgroups. These include the Baltic Ardennes and Russian Heavy Draft. The Swedish Ardennes is well established in that country, where it is in demand for use in forestry. It was first recognized as a separate sub-group in the 19th century, but today is considered a separate breed, even though its ancestry is entirely from the Ardennes horses of Belgium and France. Another closely related breed is the Auxois. Ardennes horses were also used in the 1920s to improve the Comtois by adding size. Along with the Breton and the Anglo-Norman, the Ardennes horse was used to create the Sokolsky horse. Similarly, the Trait Du Nord was created through a mixture of Ardennes and Belgian blood.

In the summer of 2014 the track around the football field was removed and artificial turf was laid in its place. The stadium was renovated in August 2017 with new seats, a new touchdown club behind the north end zone, and the outside walls with banners. The rim of the northern bowl also had a series of 5 flagpoles installed on both sides of the scoreboard, with one side set to feature American flags, and one side set to feature the state flag of Kansas. Capacity right right The stadium's current official capacity is 50,071. A then-record crowd of 51,574 saw the Jayhawks defeat Kansas State 25‚Äì18 in 1973. At the Jayhawks' November 5, 2005 streak-snapping 40‚Äì15 victory over Nebraska, it was announced that that attendance record was broken, with a standing-room-only crowd of 51,750. On November 18, 2006 a then attendance record of 51,821 fans watched the Jayhawks defeat Kansas State, 39‚Äì20. The home attendance average of 44,137 in seven games during the year set a new season record, surpassing the prior season's record of 43,675 in six contests. Over the last three seasons, stadium attendance has averaged more than 41,000 per game. On November 1, 2008, the Jayhawks set a new record of 52,230 fans in attendance. The Jayhawks beat Kansas State 52‚Äì21 in the Sunflower Showdown. On September 5, 2009 Kansas broke the record again as 52,530 fansPostgame Notes Kansas 49, Northern Colorado 3 September 5, 2009 watched the Jayhawks defeat Northern Colorado in the opening game of the Jayhawks' 2009 season.

The team allowed just two touchdowns in first quarters at home during the season. * In 2007, the Jayhawks went undefeated at home again, highlighted by a 76‚Äì39 victory over Nebraska. The 76 points by the Jayhawks was the third most scored in Kansas history,Kansas Football Notebook ‚Äì November 4, 2007 and also the most points given up in Nebraska history. =The Kansas Relays= Memorial Stadium also hosted the Kansas Relays track and field event every year from 1923 through 2013, except in 1943, 1944 and 1945 due to World War II and 1998 and 1999 due to construction. The Relays annually see top area high school and intercollegiate competitors, and the open events often draw Olympic runners such as Maurice Greene and Marion Jones. The Kansas Relays is the location where world-record holder Justin Gatlin tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs in 2006. Gatlin served a four-year suspension, but has since returned to track prominence. In 2014, the Kansas Relays left Memorial Stadium and moved to Rock Chalk Park, a new multi-sport complex located northwest of the KU campus. The new track facility seats 7,000 and features a nine-lane, IAAF certified track. =High school football= The stadium has also hosted numerous Kansas State High School Activities Association state championship games and Kansas Shrine Bowl all- star games, and was used by Lawrence High School before it constructed a stadium on its campus.

History =Early years= When it was founded in 1869, the brewery was named the Lorimer and Clark Caledonian Brewery, after its founders George Lorimer and Robert Clark. George Lorimer was just 18 years old when his father (George Lorimer Snr.) died in a fire at Edinburgh's Theatre Royal in 1865. Young George was a keen golfer and member of the Bruntsfield Links Golfing Society - which met at the Golf Tavern and played on the adjacent Bruntsfield Links. It was through spending time at the Golf Tavern that George became friends with many of Edinburgh's leading brewers; including Thomas Aitchison, George Bernard and Robert Clark. In 1868, George Lorimer came of age and inherited his father's estate. George was determined to use the money to start his own brewery. He enlisted the help of Robert Clark, then Head Brewer at the Alexander Melvin Brewery in Edinburgh and together they opened Lorimer and Clark's Caledonian Brewery on the Slateford Road site. In 1892, to designs by the architect Robert Hamilton Paterson, buildings on the site were re-constructed and new brewery and maltings buildings erected.Dictionary of Scottish Architects. Biography, Robert Hamilton Paterson. Retrieved 21 July 2011 Although the brewery sold its beers and a number of stouts all over Scotland, its most popular beer was Lorimer's Best Scotch, which was sold predominantly in the north-east of England. =Vaux era= On George Lorimer‚Äôs death in 1939, The Caledonian Brewery passed into the hands of Sunderland-based Vaux Breweries, who developed Lorimer‚Äôs Best Scotch brand into one of the most popular beers in the North East of England. In 1986 they decided to cease brewing in Edinburgh and transfer the operation to their base in Sunderland. Eventually neglect and lack of investment took their toll and placed the brewery under threat of closure. In 1987, the brewery was saved through a management buy-out led by Head Brewer Russell Sharp. =Scottish & Newcastle era= In 2004, the brewery site and production facilities were bought by Scottish & Newcastle (S&N;), following their closure of the McEwan's Brewery in Fountainbridge, Edinburgh. Production of McEwan's ales has been transferred to the Caledonian Brewery.Further fears after brewery cuts BBC News, 18 February 2004 At the same time, a new Caledonian Brewing Company (CBC) was formed by several former shareholders and directors of the pre-2004 business.

In 2008, S&N; bought the remaining shares in CBC to take full control of the company. The brands remain unaffected and brewing will continue at the site. Harviestoun was not part of the takeover and was retained by Caledonian's shareholders to run as a separate concern.

It is a close relative of the Grove Snail.  Shell description  Four views of a shell of Cepaea hortensis Cepaea hortensis The white-lipped snail is very slightly smaller than the grove snail, the shell being usually about in maximum dimension. Like the grove snail (brown-lipped snail), it has considerable variability in shell colour and banding, although the shell of the white-lipped snail is perhaps most commonly yellow, with or without brown banding. The principal distinguishing feature of this species is a white lip at the aperture of the shell in adult specimens, although very rarely the brown-lipped grove snail can have a white lip, and vice versa.Simon Whipps, July 2009; last updated July 2009.

The range of the white-lipped snail extends closer to the Arctic in Northern Europe than the range of the grove snail. The white-lipped snail has been introduced to northeastern parts of the USA, but has not established itself as successfully as the brown-lipped snail.

The Motorola 68881 was introduced in 1984. The addition of one of these devices added substantial cost to a computer, but added a floating-point unit that could rapidly perform floating point mathematical calculations. In the mid 1980s, this feature was useful mostly for scientific and mathematical software.  Overview  A Motorola 68882 FPU The 68020 and 68030 CPUs were designed with the separate 68881 chip in mind. Their instruction sets reserved the \\"F-line\\" instructions ‚Äì that is, all opcodes beginning with the hexadecimal digit \\"F\\" could either be forwarded to an external coprocessor or be used as \\"traps\\" which would throw an exception, handing control to the computer's operating system. If an FPU is not present in the system, the OS would then either call an FPU emulator to execute the instruction's equivalent using 68020 integer-based software code, return an error to the program, terminate the program, or crash and require a reboot.  Architecture  Die of Motorola 68881 The 68881 has eight 80-bit data registershttp://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?code=MC68882http://www.cpu- world.com/CPUs/68882/ (a 64-bit mantissa plus a sign bit, and a 15-bit signed exponent). It allows seven different modes of numeric representation, including single-precision, double-precision, and extended-precision, as defined by the IEEE floating-point standard, IEEE 754. It was designed specifically for floating-point math and is not a general-purpose CPU. For example, when an instruction requires any address calculations, the main CPU handles them before the 68881 takes control. The CPU/FPU pair are designed such that both can run at the same time. When the CPU encounters a 68881 instruction, it hands the FPU all operands needed for that instruction, and then the FPU releases the CPU to go on and execute the next instruction.  68882  Die of Motorola 68882 The 68882 is an improved version of the 68881, with better pipelining, and eventually available at higher clock speeds. Its instruction set is exactly the same. Motorola claimed in some marketing literature that it executes some instructions 40% faster than a 68881 at the same clock speed, though this did not reflect typical performance, as seen by its more modest improvement in the table below. The 68882 is pin compatible with the 68881 and can be used as a direct replacement in most systems. The most important software incompatibility is that the 68882 uses a larger FSAVE state frame, which affects UNIX and other preemptive multitasking OSes that had to be modified to allocate more space for it.  Usage  The 68881 or 68882 were used in the Sun Microsystems Sun-3 workstations, IBM RT PC workstations, Apple Computer Macintosh II family, NeXT Computer, Sharp X68000, Amiga 3000, and Atari Mega STE, TT, and Falcon030. Some third-party Amiga and Atari products used the 68881 or 68882 as a memory- mapped peripheral to the 68000.  Versions  = 68881 = 155 000 transistors on-chip * 12 MHz version * 16 MHz version ran at 160 kFLOPS * 20 MHz version ran at 192 kFLOPS * 25 MHz version ran at 240 kFLOPS = 68882 = 176 000 transistors on-chip * 25 MHz version ran at 264 kFLOPS * 33 MHz version ran at 352 kFLOPS * 40 MHz version ran at 422 kFLOPS * 50 MHz version ran at 528 kFLOPS These statistics came from the comp.sys.m68k FAQ.

Historically, the valley had been known as the Lower Snake River Valley or the Boise River Valley.

The valley was settled for the most part by ranchers and farmers, initially to supply the gold and silver mining communities in the higher elevations nearby: Idaho City in the Boise Basin and Silver City in the Owyhees. A new Fort Boise was constructed by the U.S. Army in 1863 in present-day Boise, from which the city grew.

They moved to Idaho in 1862 for mining and homesteaded right below the Boise Bench on the Boise River. Tom Davis became very successful at growing fruit, as he made over $10,000 on one year's apple crop. He later purchased more land for orchards and horses. In 1907, he donated much of this land as Julia Davis Park in honor of his wife. The Owyhee Project was one of the most influential developments of the area. It essentially began in 1903, when surveyors began investigating a site on the Owyhee River for the construction of a dam, to impound water for irrigation. The Owyhee project received official Congressional sanction in 1924 on December 5 and the Owyhee Dam was completed on September 16, 1932.\\"Owyhee Project.\\" U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Reclamation. 1996. While the dam was under construction, over of irrigation canals were being dug to the north and south. The main purpose of the Owyhee Project was irrigation. By 1965, over were being irrigated for a value of more than $23 million. In 1941, J. R. Simplot built a dehydrator and began processing large quantities of dehydrated potatoes and onions at a plant near Caldwell. His business thrived, selling potatoes to the government and fertilizer to local farmers. =Technology= In 1973, Hewlett Packard purchased a site for a future peripherals plant in Boise.

The Costa da Morte extends from the villages of Muros and Malpica. The Costa da Morte received its name because there have been so many shipwrecks along its treacherous rocky shore. The shore of the Costa da Morte is exposed directly to the Atlantic Ocean. It is an area that has suffered a number of oil spills, including the spill from the Prestige in 2002. The exterior cape region is known for anthropological, historical and geographical reasons. Its name in the Galician language is Fisterra, which descends from the Roman legend which held that this area was the end of the world (Finis- terrae). The area was largely Christianized by the Catholic Church with the aid of a large flux of Christian pilgrims arriving on the Way of St. James. The people of the area still preserve pre-Christian ritual places and pass on some of the traditional beliefs. For example, there are giant pedras de abalar (i.e. \\"oscillating stones\\", the common term in English is rocking stone) throughout the region.

Life Manhae was born in Yucheon in Chungcheongnam-do, Hongseong. During his childhood, he studied Chinese classics in Seodang, a popular elementary school during the Joseon Dynasty. Prior to being ordained, he was involved in resistance to Japanese influence in the country, which culminated in the Japanese occupation from 1905 to 1945. He lived in seclusion at Ose-am in the Baekdam Temple from 1896. During this period, he studied Buddhist sacred texts and several books of modern philosophy. In 1905 he received the robes of the Jogye Order of monks and in 1908 he went to Japan and visited several temples to study Buddhism and Eastern philosophy for six months.\\"Han Yong-un\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# In 1919 he was one of the patriot signatories to the Korean Declaration of Independence. Work As a social writer, Manhae called for the reform of Korean Buddhism. Manhae's poetry dealt with both nationalism and sexual love, often mingling the two. One of his more political collections was Nimui Chimmuk (Lover's Silence, ÎãòÏùò Ïπ®Î¨µ), published in 1926. These works revolve around the ideas of equality and freedom and helped inspire the tendencies toward passive resistance and non-violence in the Korean independence movement. In 1913, Han Yongun published \\"The Restoration of Korean Buddhism (Joseonbulgyo-yusimlon), which criticized the anachronistic isolationist policy of Joseon Buddhism and its incongruence with the then contemporary reality. The work sent tremors through the intellectual world. In this work, the author promulgated the principle of equality, self-discovery, the potential for Buddhism for safeguarding the world, and progress. His development as an activist and thinker resulted from his adherence to these very principles.Source-attribution\\"Han Yong-un\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online In 1918, Han published \\"Whole Mind\\" (Yusim), a work that aimed to enlighten young people. In the following year, he played an important role in the 3.1 Independence movement with Chae Lin, for which he was later imprisoned and served a three-year sentence. During his imprisonment, Han composed \\"Reasons for Korean Independence\\" (Joseondoglib-i- yuseo) as a response to the official investigation into his political engagement. He was later acquitted in 1922, at which time he began a nationwide lecture tour. The purpose of the tour was to engage and inspire youth, an objective first established in Han's \\"Whole Mind\\". In 1924, he became the Chair of the Buddhist youth assembly. The poems published in Han's Nim-ui Chimmuk had been written at Baekdam Temple in the previous year. This book garnered much attention from literary critics and intellectuals at the time. Despite his many other publications, from Chinese poems to sijos and the poems included in Yusim, and novels such as Dark Wind (Heukpung), Regret (Huhoe), Misfortune (Bakmyeong), this collection remains the poet's most significant and enduring literary achievement. In it, love for the motherland plainly appears under the guise of longing for the loved one, as in the poem \\"I Do Not Know\\". Han's model for such rhapsodic, long-lined expressions of devotion was Rabindranath Tagore, whose work he knew, and behind Tagore the long Indian tradition of combining mysticism with eroticism.Pankaj Mohan, \\"Revisiting Han Yong-un's Buddhist Texts and their Nationalist Contexts\\", pp.7‚Äì8 In 2007, he was listed by the Korean Poets' Association among the ten most important modern Korean poets.

Bawden taught at the Royal College of Art, where he had been a student, worked as a commercial artist and served as a war artist in World War Two. He was a fine watercolour painter but worked in many different media. He illustrated several books and painted murals in both the 1930s and 1960s. He was admired by Edward Gorey, David Gentleman and other graphic artists, and his work and career is often associated with that of his contemporary Eric Ravilious. Early life and studies Edward Bawden was born on 10 March 1903 at Braintree, Essex, the only child of Edward Bawden, an ironmonger, and Eleanor Bawden (n√©e Game). His parents were Methodist Christians. A solitary child, he spent much time drawing or wandering with butterfly-net and microscope. At the age of seven he was enrolled at Braintree High School, and began studying or copying drawings of cats by Louis Wain, illustrations in boys' and girls' magazines, and Burne Jones's illustrations of Malory's Morte d'Arthur. Later his parents paid for him to attend the Friends' School at Saffron Walden, and there, when he was fifteen, the headmaster recommended him to study for one day a week at Cambridge School of Art. Upon leaving school in 1919, he attended Cambridge School of Art full-time from 1919 to 1921. There he became interested in calligraphy and in the work of Aubrey Beardsley, Richard Doyle, William Morris and other Victorians.Malcolm Yorke, Edward Bawden & His Circle (2007), p.15-18 This was followed in 1922 by a scholarship to the Royal College of Art School of Design in London, where he took a diploma in illustration until 1925. Here he met his fellow student and future collaborator Eric Ravilious; the pair were described by their teacher Paul Nash as \\"an extraordinary outbreak of talent\\". Early work In an Air Raid Shelter, Dunkirk‚ÄîBombs are dropping. (IWM ART LD239) It was during this period that Bawden produced the tiles for the London Underground that were exhibited at the International Building Trades Exhibition at Olympia in April 1928. In 1928, Bawden was commissioned by Sir Joseph Duveen, at the rate of ¬£1 per day, to create a mural for the Refectory at Morley College, London along with Ravilious and Charles Mahoney. The mural was unveiled in 1930 by former Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, who was at the time Leader of the Opposition. By 1930, Bawden was working one day a week for the Curwen Press, as was Ravilious and their former tutor, Nash, producing illustrations for leading companies at the time such as London Transport, Westminster Bank, Twinings, Poole Potteries, Shell-Mex, the Folio Society, Chatto & Windus, and Penguin Books. In the early 1930s he was discovered by the Stuart Advertising Agency, owned by H. Stuart Menzies and Marcus Brumwell. Around this time Bawden produced some of his most humorous and innovative work for Fortnum & Mason and Imperial Airways. He also worked for The Listener. In 1932, Bawden married Charlotte Epton, who had been a fellow-student at the Royal College. They had two children, Joanna and Richard, both of whom would become artists. At first the couple lived in a flat in Hammersmith, but soon moved to a Georgian house in Great Bardfield, Essex, only a few miles from Braintree, where Bawden had been born. Following his move to the country he began to paint more, in addition to his commercial design work, developing his watercolour technique. Most of his subjects were of scenes around Great Bardfield. He held an exhibition of his Essex watercolours at the Zwemmer Gallery in 1934, and another show of his paintings was held at the Leicester Galleries in 1938. In 1938, Bawden collaborated with John Aldridge, who also lived in the village, on a range of wallpapers that they intended to be printed commercially, but from lino blocks handcut by the designers. The project left little other time for other work during the year, and war intervened before the papers could go into production. One of Bawden's most familiar designs from this era was the 'Puzzled Lion and Startled Unicorn' Observer masthead, which was created around 1939 and remained in use by the national newspaper until 1989. War artist Ravenna- Royal Engineers' working party collecting material for bridge repairs and road making at the Porta Cybo. (IWM ART LD4967) During the Second World War Bawden served as an official war artist, first with the British army in France and then, following the army's evacuation from there, in the Middle East. Already in France before World War II was declared, he recorded defences being prepared at Halluin, then witnessed the bombing of Armenti√®res and the evacuation from Dunkirk. He was posted to North Africa as a War Office Artist on a full-time War Artists' Advisory Committee contract. Bawden painted landscapes and portraits in Libya, Sudan, Cairo, Eritrea and Ethiopia, reaching Addis Ababa in May 1941. At the start of 1942 he travelled with Anthony Gross to Palestine and Lebanon. After making a series of studies of the Marsh Arabs in southern Iraq, Bawden was recalled to London. Bawden departed Cairo aboard the SS Stratheden but transferred to the RMS Laconia in Durban on 27 August 1942. After the Laconia was torpedoed and sunk, on 12 September 1942, he spent five days in an open lifeboat before being rescued by a French ship, the Gloire. He was held prisoner in a Vichy internment camp in Casablanca for two months before the camp was liberated by American troops. From Casablanca he sailed to Norfolk, Virginia. When he eventually returned to Britain, Bawden did portrait work at the Military Hospital in Colchester and in Scotland, with Polish forces training there. He returned to Iraq in September 1943, as a Ministry of Information artist to work in Baghdad and Kurdistan, before he joined the Middle East Anti-Locust Unit on its trek to Jeddah. From Jeddah, he returned to the Marsh Arabs in southern Iraq, before entering Iran to portray supply shipments to the Soviet Union. Bawden returned to England in 1944 and for a short while, painted at Southampton docks before departing for Yugoslavia, by way of Rome. Unable to enter Yugoslavia he went to Ravenna, then Greece, Austria and Florence before travelling back to England in July 1945. Later work Brick House in Great Bardfield Bawden lived in Great Bardfield, Essex from the 1930s to 1970. While living at Bardfield he was an important member of the Great Bardfield Artists. This group of local artists were diverse in style but shared a love for figurative art, making the group distinct from the better known St Ives art community in Cornwall, who, after the war, were chiefly dominated by abstractionists. In 1949, Bawden provided illustrations for the book London is London ‚Äì A Selection of Prose and Verse by D. M. Low. Bawden completed a series of eleven murals for the First Class lounge of the P&O; liner Oronsay, which was launched in 1951. The theme was the English pub and Bawden depicted traditional pub names, such as the Rose & Crown, in purely visual form in his design. For the Festival of Britain in 1951 he created a mural, English Country Life, that was displayed in the entrance of The Lion and the Unicorn Pavilion. During the 1950s, the Great Bardfield Artists organised a series of large 'open house' exhibitions which attracted national press attention. Positive reviews and the novelty of viewing art works in the artists' own homes (including Bawden's Brick House) led to thousands visiting the remote village during the summer exhibitions of 1954, 1955, and 1958. As well as these shows, the Great Bardfield Artists held several touring exhibitions of their work in 1957, 1958, and 1959. After the death of his wife in 1970, Bawden moved to the nearby town of Saffron Walden, where he continued to work until his death at home on 21 November 1989.  Legacy  Bawden's Ferry across the River Lea tile at Tottenham Hale Bawden bequeathed about 3,000 of his works to The Higgins Art Gallery & Museum, Bedford. His work can be seen in many major collections and is shown regularly at the Fry Art Gallery, Saffron Walden and at the Higgins. His notable surviving public works include a tile depicting a foot ferry on the River Lea, commissioned by London Underground and located on the Victoria line platform at Tottenham Hale station. Bawden also produced the cameo-like silhouette of Queen Victoria located at Victoria underground station. An early map, produced in 1931 for Scarborough's Pavilion Hotel and presented to Scarborough Library when the hotel was sold, was recently restored and rehung in the library. The original Morley College mural that Bawden created in the 1930s was destroyed during a wartime bombing raid; however the rebuilt and relocated college on the South Bank contains a fine surviving mural by him. In 1965 Bawden completed a mural for Queen's University, Belfast. Queen Victoria tile at Victoria station Teaching, appointments and awards Having briefly taught design and book illustration at Goldsmiths, University of London from 1928 to 1931, Bawden then went on to teach at the Royal College of Art between 1930 and 1963 (except for the years of the Second World War). In 1968, he became a tutor at the Royal Academy Schools. In 1969 Edward became a Senior Part-Time Lecturer in Graphics at the City of Leicester Polytechnic.DMU Special Collections, D/009, https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/7c3ec076-3b27-38c2-975b-976aa3fad234 Among his numerous appointments and awards that came later in his career are: * 1946 ‚Äì Appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) * 1947 ‚Äì Associate of the Royal Academy * 1949 ‚Äì Royal Designer for Industry (RSA) * 1949/50 ‚Äì Guest instructor for the Summers of 1949/50 at the Banff School of Fine Art, Canada * 1951 ‚Äì Trustee of the Tate Gallery (1951‚Äì1958 * 1956 ‚Äì Elected Royal Academician * 1962 ‚Äì Honorary Associate of Manchester College of Art * 1963 ‚Äì Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Art * 1964 ‚Äì Silver Medal from the Society of Industrial Artists * 1970 ‚Äì Honorary Doctorate from the Royal College of Art * 1974 ‚Äì Honorary Doctorate from the University of Essex * 1979 ‚Äì Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers Writings by Bawden Life in an English Village (King Penguin Books no 51) (1949, Penguin Books) * The English Scene (1952, Sheneval Press) * Hold Fast By Your Teeth (1963, Routledge & Kegan Paul) * Travels of a War Artist 1940‚Äì45 (1983, Imperial War Museum) * Edward Bawden, war artist, and his letters home, 1940‚Äì1945 edited by Ruari McLean. 1989, Scolar Press, Aldershot, in association with the Imperial War Museum.

They do not necessarily hold public office themselves; most historical bosses did not, at least during the times of their greatest influence. Numerous officeholders in that unit are subordinate to the single boss in party affairs. Bosses may base their power on the support of numerous voters, usually organized voting blocs, and manage a coalition of these blocs and various other stakeholders. When the party wins, they typically control appointments in their unit, and have a voice at the higher levels. Reformers typically allege that political bosses are corrupt. This corruption is usually tied to patronage; the exchange of jobs, lucrative contracts and other political favors for votes, campaign contributions and sometimes outright bribes. History The appearance of bosses has been common since the Roman Republic, and remains fairly common or maybe widespread today. In Spanish America, Brazil, Spain, and Portugal political bosses called caciques hold power in many places;Robert Kern, The caciques: oligarchical politics and the system of caciquismo in the Luso-Hispanic world. Albuquerque, University of New Mexico Press [1973] while in Italy they are often referred to as ras.I ras del voto \\"personale\\" che ondeggiano tra gli schieramenti Bosses were a major part of the political landscape during the 19th and early 20th centuries in the United States, such as the political machine of Tammany Hall, which controlled financing of campaigns and influence via owing of favors to arrange patronage public appointments. In the Southern United States, charismatic populist politicians like Huey Long commanded large networks of supporters. Similar practices existed in the northern cities, particularly New York City, where Boss Tweed (arguably the most infamous political boss) wielded control over the powerful Democratic political machine. In Denver, Colorado during the 1890s there was Jefferson Randolph \\"Soapy\\" Smith who operated as the Republican party boss and political fixer. Charles Brayton exercised great influence over the politics of turn of the 20th century Rhode Island.John D. Buenker, \\"The Politics of Resistance: The Rural-Based Yankee Republican Machines of Connecticut and Rhode Island\\". New England Quarterly (1974): 212‚Äì237. He exemplified rural bossism within the Republican Party. Chicago had numerous colorful bosses, such as Democrats Hinky Dink and Bathhouse John.Lloyd Wendt, and Herman Kogan, Lords of the Levee: The story of Bathhouse John and Hinky Dink (1944). Chicago's Republican counterparts included Big Bill Thompson, who became mayor in the 1920s.Douglas Bukowski, Big Bill Thompson, Chicago, and the politics of image (1998). One of Chicago's most iconic figures was longtime mayor and chairman of the Cook County Democratic Committee Richard J. Daley,Mike Royko, Boss: Richard J. Daley of Chicago (1971) who had a major voice in state and national Democratic politics. With a few exceptions in the Southwest, such as Phoenix, most large cities of 100,000 or more in the early 20th century had machine organizations, and usually claimed one or more local bosses, most of which were Democrats. Some had a major impact and hold on state politics, such as E. H. Crump in Memphis, Tennessee.G. Wayne Dowdy, Mayor Crump Don't Like It: Machine Politics in Memphis (Univ. Press of Mississippi, 2006) A few bosses had reputations as reformers, such as Frank Hague of Jersey City.Mark S. Foster, \\"Frank Hague of Jersey City: 'The boss' as reformer.\\" New Jersey History 86#2 (1968): 106‚Äì117. In October 2020 an article appeared in The Bulwark arguing that Donald Trump's appeal to white working-class voters in the 2016 United States presidential election was driven by the same kind of paternalistic and localist mentality that was exploited by the Democratic political bosses of the early 20th century.Stephanie Muravchik and Jon A.

The building was designated a New York City landmark in 1978, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.  Description  The Chanin Building was designed by Sloan & Robertson in the Art Deco style. Though the exterior contains a relatively muted design, the interior contains ample ornament. The building's design took several elements from Eliel Saarinen's Tribune Tower design.; The Chanin Building is tall to its roof, or tall when including its spire. The building is located at 122 East 42nd Street and is bounded by Lexington Avenue to the east, 42nd Street to the north, and 41st Street to the south. The lot measures along 42nd Street, along 41st Street, and along Lexington Avenue. It is part of the Terminal City area of Grand Central Terminal, and abuts 110 East 42nd Street directly to its west. The Grand Hyatt New York hotel is located across 42nd Street, while the Socony‚ÄìMobil Building is located across Lexington Avenue. = Form = The Chanin Building employs a series of setbacks that end in a \\"vigorous, toothed\\" pinnacle. Because of the varying widths of the surrounding streets, three separate groups of setbacks were mandated for each side per the 1916 Zoning Resolution, with the result that the Chanin Building was \\"design[ed] in masses rather than in facades\\". The lowest four stories occupy the entire building lot, while there is a recession in the middle of the eastern facade from the fifth through 17th stories. The subsequent stories form a jagged \\"pyramid\\", with setbacks above the 17th, 30th, and 52nd stories.; = Facade = Lower section of the facade, as seen from across 42nd Street; the Socony‚ÄìMobil Building is visible at left The Chanin Building is clad with brick, limestone, and terracotta, as well as bronze, marble, and colored glass ornament that was custom-designed. The base of the building bears black Belgian marble around the store front windows, which are each made of plate glass. Directly above, a bronze frieze depicts scenes of evolution, ranging from simple organisms to more complex animals and plants. A second terracotta frieze runs the whole length of the lower facade, presenting a dramatic collection of angular zigzags and curvy leaves. A bas- relief by Edward Trumbull, designed in the Art Deco style, wraps around the facade. The facade continues upward in relatively simple tones. The second and third floors include bronze-framed groups of triple-paned windows, with bronze Art Deco spandrel panels between the floors. Each grouping is separated by vertical piers made of limestone, topped by elaborate capitals. The fourth story is faced with ornate terracotta panels depicting plants, evoking the stylized forms common in the Art Deco style. There are buttresses on the fifth and sixth stories of the Lexington Avenue facade's recessed section, and at the corners of the 30th through 49th stories.; The crown, above the Chanin Company's 52nd floor offices, contains abstract-patterned projecting ornamentation.; Originally, 212 artificial candles at the top of the Chanin Building provided the equivalent of 30 million candlepower. These lights, meant to highlight the details of the building, were characteristic of the Art Deco style, and on cloudless nights, could be seen from more than away. They had been toned down by the late twentieth century. = Features = The interior design was mostly the work of Rene Paul Chambellan and Jacques Delamarre. The former specialized in architectural sculpture in numerous styles, such as the Art Deco style, while the latter worked for the Chanin Company.;  Lobby  The lobby is accessed by passageways from 42nd and 41st Streets, with a side entrance from Lexington Avenue. The lobby is decorated in a \\"modernistic\\" style themed around \\"The City of Opportunity\\". Eight bronze reliefs designed by Chambellan perch above ornate bronze radiator grilles. The grilles depict four categories of physical and mental life. The bronze ornamentation continues in the waves on the floor, mailboxes, and elevator doors extending the general Art Deco style from the outside inward. The lobby also contains other ornamentation such as terrazzo floors with bronze inlays, as well as tan marble walls. Marble stairs lead to the basement where there are connections to Grand Central Terminal and the New York City Subway's Grand Central‚Äì42nd Street station. Also inside are 21 high speed passenger elevators, split up into three elevator banks, as well as one service elevator. When the building was opened, the first floor, mezzanine, and second floor were used by banks and other commercial concerns. The lobby originally served as a \\"palatial\\" bus terminal operated by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The terminal was outfitted with marble surfaces and also contained waiting rooms and ticket offices. Buses would pull onto a revolving turntable within the terminal, which received boarding passengers on one side and deposited alighting passengers on the other. The coach terminal closed after the railroad discontinued all passenger service north of Baltimore in 1958.  Upper floors  Designed by Rene Paul Chambellan, these gates led to the private offices of Irwin S. Chanin The third through 48th floors consist almost entirely of leasable office space, while the 49th and 50th floors contain the Chanin brothers' board room and offices. When originally completed, the 50th floor also had a small movie theater, which was later converted into the Chanin Organization's offices. The floors above the 52nd floor were originally the offices of the Chanin Organization, with an Art Deco restroom that a building trade convention's judges referred to as \\"America's finest bathroom\\". Irwin Chanin's 52nd floor offices were accessed through a set of bronze gates designed by Chambellan, while bronze vector grilles were situated within the office. As a dominant landmark in the midtown skyline upon its opening, the building had an open-air observation deck on the 54th floor. It was one of three open-air observatories in the city following World War II, the others being at 30 Rockefeller Plaza and at the Empire State Building, though there had been several other observation decks in the city prior to the war. The Chanin Building only charged 25 cents for admission, since it was not as well known as the other two buildings with outdoor observatories. Over the years, several people have committed suicide by jumping off the 54th floor observation deck. In later years, other nearby buildings surpassed the Chanin Building in height (including the Chrysler Building, diagonally across Lexington Avenue and 42nd Street), and so the observation deck was closed in the mid-20th century. Close-up of the embrasures at the Chanin Building's crenellated top The top of the building was used as a transmission site for WQXR-FM starting on December 15, 1941, when it was relocated from Long Island City in Queens. In 1965, the transmitter was moved to the Empire State Building.  History  = Context = The completion of the underground Grand Central Terminal in 1913 resulted in the rapid development of the areas around Grand Central, and a corresponding increase in real-estate prices. Among these were the New York Central Building at 47th Street and Park Avenue, as well as the Grand Central Palace across 42nd Street from the present Chanin Building. By 1920, the area had become what The New York Times called \\"a great civic centre\\". One site that had yet to be redeveloped was the Manhattan Storage Warehouse, which was built in 1882 and still occupied the site of the Chanin Building. Irwin Chanin was an American architect and real estate developer who designed several Art Deco towers and Broadway theaters. He and his brother Henry I. Chanin designed their first Manhattan buildings in 1924; and later built and operated a number of theaters and other structures related to the entertainment industry, including the Roxy Theatre and the Hotel Lincoln. The Chanins took over an existing 105-year leasehold for the land underneath the warehouse in August 1926, upon which they planned to build a skyscraper.; The brothers still had a reputation for being involved mostly in the theater industry. According to one author, when the Chanins cleared the site in 1927, many members of the general public could not tell \\"whether the Chanins were builders or [...] theater-owners who had taken up building as a sideline.\\" The warehouse itself was difficult to clear, since its walls had been designed to protect against \\"burglary, fire and assault\\". The process entailed clearing away 7,500 truck loads of brick, 1,000 of scrap metal, and 3,500 of loose earth. = Construction = The official plans for the Chanin Building were filed with the New York City Department of Buildings in June 1927, at which point 60% of the warehouse had been demolished. Sloan & Robertson, architects of the nearby Graybar Building, Pershing Square Building, and 110 East 42nd Street, were hired to design the Chanin Building. Once the foundation had been laid, the first steel columns were installed in January 1928, with Irwin S. Chanin driving in the first rivet. The steel frame weighed an estimated and was held together by 1.5 million rivets and 160,000 bolts. Crowds frequently stopped to observe the construction process. The erection of the frame was not without problems: in one incident, the boom of a construction derrick fell from the 20th floor, nearly splitting a truck in half, though no one was injured or killed. The steelwork was completed by that June, and as was tradition at the time, two gold rivets for the Chanin Building were driven into the frame on July 2 to mark this event.; ; The building held its topping out ceremony in August 1928. = Usage = Viewed from beside the Chrysler Building, on the opposite corner of Lexington Avenue and 42nd Street The structure was declared complete on January 23, 1929, exactly one year after the first rivet had been driven into the building. It opened January 29 at an estimated cost of $12-14 million, with an informal opening attended by mayor Jimmy Walker. The Chanin Building thus became the first major skyscraper in Terminal City, and the third-tallest building in New York City behind the Woolworth Building and the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower. Though the Chanin Building was later surpassed in height by other buildings, including the adjacent Chrysler Building that opened a year later, Irwin Chanin was instead focused on attracting tenants with an \\"efficient, up-to-date\\" facility. Upon opening, the Chanin Building was almost fully rented. The builders projected that by September 1, 1929, the building would be 70% rented, though the actual occupancy rate at that date was 92%. Furthermore, in 1930, The New York Times reported that 95% of the structure's was occupied by 9,000 workers. Initially, the lobby space was occupied by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's bus terminal, ticket offices, and waiting rooms. The office space included such tenants as the Kimberly-Clark paper company, Pan American Petroleum and Transport Company, and Fairchild Aircraft, while the Chanin company took all the space above the 50th floor. In addition, the Sterling National Bank took up much of the mezzanine space on the Lexington Avenue side, and a self-service and table-service restaurant opened in the basement. Through the Great Depression, leasing proceeded actively. The building's owners filed to reorganize the operations of the Lexington Avenue and 42nd Street Corporation, which operated the Chanin Building, in 1947. In subsequent years, the Chanin Building continued to attract tenants such as Guest Keen and Nettlefolds, a Howard Johnson's restaurant, and the Barry Goldwater 1964 presidential campaign's New York state headquarters. In addition, the building hosted U.S. Chess Championships. Despite this success, the Chanin Building faced some issues: its owners, along with those of the Nelson Tower and Century Apartments, were charged with real estate tax fraud in 1974. The Chanin Building's owners were estimated to have evaded $138,549 in real estate taxes. The Chanin Building was designated a city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1978, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. By the 1990s, the building was owned by a syndicate headed by Stanley Stahl. Modern tenants include the Apple Bank for Savings, of which Stahl was the only stockholder, as well as the International Rescue Committee, which had moved to the building in 1994.  Critical reception  Shortly after the building's completion, architectural critic Matlack Price wrote in an Architectural Forum article that \\"The architects have not here compromised a fine vision either with major errors in scale or with minor trivialities.\\" Paul Goldberger of The New York Times said that the Chanin Building was \\"one of the pre-eminent pieces of American Art Deco‚Äîa gracefully ornamented, 56-story slab\\". The fifth edition of the AIA Guide to New York City, published in 2010, characterized the Chanin Building as being \\"classic style, rather than stylish ephemera. Such distinguished self-improvement seems beyond the grasp of current developers.\\" The interior design of the building was also praised. Herbert Muschamp wrote in 1992 that the Chanin Building \\"tells a story of New York as the legendary beacon for immigrants\\", and that its numerous amenities \\"were integral to the Chanin Building's drama\\". Historian Donald L. Miller stated, \\"Restrained on the outside, the inside is exuberantly ornate\\".

Since 2004, it has been operated as part of the Buffalo and Pittsburgh Railroad, which is owned by Genesee & Wyoming Inc. History The Pittsburg and Shawmut Railroad is often confused with the similarly named Pittsburg, Shawmut and Northern Railroad from which the P&S; had its origins. Further adding to the confusion is the fact that both were nicknamed the Shawmut Line, both operated in roughly the same geographic area, and both used similar diamond logos during their history. In fact the two were separate and unrelated companies after their 1916 split. The main line consisted of approximately 88 miles (140 km) of standard gauge track extending from Brockway, Pennsylvania to Freeport, Pennsylvania. The main shops were located in Brookville, Pennsylvania. =Beginnings= The Pittsburg and Shawmut Railroad Company began life on July 21, 1903 as the Brookville and Mahoning Railroad, leased by the Pittsburg, Shawmut and Northern Railroad. When the PS&N; declared bankruptcy in 1905, the B&M; was spun off into a separate entity and was renamed in 1909 due to confusion with the Boston and Maine Railroad's initials. Like its parent, the P&S; was also financially troubled in its early years. The company struggled until corporate fortunes improved with the war mobilization of the 1940s. Coal was the principal commodity for the line for its entire existence. Doodlebugs and passenger trains ran on the route in the early years but had all been eliminated by 1939. =Recent History= The company acquired a ten-mile (16 km) section of Conrail track running from Sligo to Lawsonham in 1989 and reorganized it as the Red Bank Railroad. On December 31, 1991 the company purchased about of the Low Grade Secondary track from Lawsonham to Driftwood, Pennsylvania from Conrail and organized it as the Mountain Laurel Railroad. The company began using the red Shawmut Line logo in the 1970s. It was identical to the old PS&N; RR logo in everything but color. =Spelling of Pittsburg= The spelling of Pittsburgh as Pittsburg derives from the company‚Äôs origins in the Pittsburg, Shawmut & Northern Railroad. That company was chartered in 1899 when the name of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was commonly spelled without the h. The United States Board on Geographic Names advocated the h-less spelling from 1891 to 1911 in an effort to standardize the spelling of place names in the United States. Management The company operated under its own management until 1996 when it was acquired by the Genesee & Wyoming Inc.. The Genesee & Wyoming operated the Pittsburg & Shawmut Railroad under its own banner until January 1, 2004 when it was absorbed into the Buffalo and Pittsburgh Railroad, another G&W; company. Simultaneously, a new company with the same name was created to purchase the property, which is now operated by the BPRR. (The P&S; also acquired the residual common carrier obligation on the lines.) Several portions of the main line were abandoned before the absorption and several others since.

Nevada State Route 445 runs along the east side of the range along the shore of Pyramid Lake and continues to southwest through Mullen Pass between the Virginia Mountains and the Pah Rah Range to the southeast. Structure ‚ÄúThe Virginia Mountains of Washoe County, Nevada, is an uplifted and collapsed anticlinal structure having a N-S trend but bending toward the southeast at the southern end of the range. NW and NNW fault trends in Winnemucca Valley and within the low hills on the eastern range front are believed to be a part of the Walker Lane lineament. Topographic, structural, and geologic evidence yields confidently a first-order, right-lateral, strike-slip fault interpretation. Also indicated are second-order left-lateral, strike slip movements along the eastern mountain front. The structurally very complex southern one-fifth of the range together with the northern portion of the Pah Rah Range suggest distributive branching of the Walker Lane lineament in the brittle Hartford Hill rhyolite as the lineament nears termination in southern Washoe County. The present topography of the Virginia Mountains is the result of bending of layers of volcanic rocks, high- angle and strike-slip faulting, and erosion in an arid to semi-arid climate. Major and minor drainage is controlled almost exclusively by the structure. Fault valleys are characteristic of the entire range and are the principal topographic forms, but many other types of drainage are present. The higher elevations are representative of old erosion surfaces.‚Äùhttp://scholar works.unr.edu/handle/11714. ‚ÄúStructural geomorphic analysis of the Virginia Mountains, Washoe County Nevada.

Playing career Daley joined hometown club Aston Villa as an apprentice and made his senior debut, aged 17, on 20 April 1985 in a 2‚Äì0 defeat at Southampton. He played for the Midlands club for ten seasons, nine at the highest level, and finished a runner-up in both the 1989‚Äì90 and 1992‚Äì93 league championships. He also played in their 1994 League Cup final triumph where they defeated Manchester United at Wembley. During this period, Daley was capped seven times for England between 1991 and 1992 under former club manager Graham Taylor. He made his full debut as a substitute in a vital 1‚Äì1 draw in Poland on 13 November 1991 that saw England qualify for 1992 European Championships in Sweden. He was subsequently chosen for the squad at the tournament and played in two of England's three games there, but after the tournament he never played for England again. He nearly got onto the scoresheet in the 1994 Football League Cup Final against Manchester United, but his shot hit the post and was rebounded by Dalian Atkinson, only for Andrei Kanchelskis to block it with a handball for which he was sent off. Dean Saunders converted the penalty and put Villa 3‚Äì1 ahead, a scoreline which formed the final result and gave Villa a record fifth League Cup win. Daley collected what would be the only major trophy of his career. Daley linked up with Graham Taylor again as he finally left Aston Villa for Wolverhampton Wanderers in July 1994 for ¬£1.25 million, but he was plagued with injuries and was only able to manage 21 appearances for the club in four seasons. He was signed once more by Graham Taylor, now at Watford, in July 1998, on a free transfer. His injury woes continued though and he struggled to get fit, missing the final months as the club won promotion to the Premier League, Daley scoring once in the process against Birmingham City. He was given a free transfer to newly promoted Division 1 side Walsall in June 1999, and after a six-month spell there, he finished his playing career with Conference side Forest Green Rovers, hanging up his boots in July 2002. Daley's perhaps best known goal came in a First Division game against Everton at Villa Park on 22 October 1988. A spectacular flying volley in a 2‚Äì0 win for Villa, the goal quickly ‚Äì thanks in no small part to the popular football video series 'Goals Galore' ‚Äì became known as 'Daley's Dazzler' and is also remembered for full-back Chris Price (who supplied the cross) having a little celebration all of his own. Fitness coaching Upon finishing his career in professional football due to persistent injury, Daley completed a Bachelor of Science degree in Sports and Exercise Science at Coventry University. During this time, he also remained at Forest Green Rovers as their fitness coach and worked with youth players at Aston Villa's academy. Following his studies, he joined Sheffield United as a fitness and conditioning coach in June 2003 but later quit his post following a row with new manager Bryan Robson on 30 August 2007. He was not out of work for long as he joined former club Wolves in the same role the following month. He remained at Wolves in this role for almost ten years before leaving in May 2017. In 1995, Daley was the subject of a half-hour documentary. The series Respect was produced and directed by Pogus Caesar for Carlton TV, and featured the likes of Dwight Yorke, John Barnes and Ron Atkinson all paying tribute to the winger. In March 2020, Daley joined the Lion's Den Gym, Bassett's Pole, as a personal trainer.

Career Bartos was born on 31 May 1952 in Berchtesgaden, Germany. He was the drummer in a college band called The Jokers (later The Jolly Jokers in 1975) as Carlos Bartos, around 1965 to 1972., , Between 1975 and 1991, he was, along with Wolfgang Fl√ºr, a member of the electronic music band Kraftwerk. This lineup of the group remains the most stable and productive yet assembled. He was originally recruited to play on Kraftwerk's US \\"Autobahn\\" tour. In addition to his percussion playing, Bartos was credited with songwriting on the Man- Machine, Computer World, and Electric Caf√© albums and sang one lead vocal on the latter. Bartos left Kraftwerk in August 1990, reportedly frustrated at the band's slow progress in their activities due to the increasingly perfectionist attitude of founding members Ralf H√ºtter and Florian Schneider. Karl Bartos hinted at this fact in the interview entitled \\"I was a Robot\\", which is a part of the documentary film \\"Kraftwerk and the Electronic Revolution\\"., , In 1992 Bartos founded Elektric Music. This new project released the Kraftwerk-style Esperanto in 1993, and then the more guitar-based Electric Music in 1998. In between the two albums, Bartos collaborated with Bernard Sumner and Johnny Marr on Electronic's 1996 album Raise the Pressure, and co-wrote material with Andy McCluskey of OMD, which appeared on both Esperanto and OMD's Universal album. In 1998, he also produced an album by Swedish synthpop band the Mobile Homes, much in the style of his work with Electronic: guitar-pop with very slight synthetic references. It was received as a great disappointment to synthpop fans, but it sold more than any of their previous albums and was used in an advert for an airline. In 1992 Elektric Music were asked to remix Afrika Bambaataa's song \\"Planet Rock\\" for release on a remix album. Planet Rock was the subject of an out-of-court settlement between Kraftwerk and Tommy Boy Records head Tom Silverman, as it uses significant parts from both Kraftwerk's \\"Trans-Europe Express\\" and \\"Numbers\\". Karl Bartos live in 2005. In 2003, using his own name, he released the synthpop album Communication, featuring such songs as \\"I'm the Message,\\" \\"Camera,\\" and \\"Ultraviolet.\\" In 2007 his music provided the soundtrack to the documentary Moebius Redux ‚Äì A Life in Pictures, about the graphic artist Jean Giraud. Karl Bartos announced in early 2008 that he had opened the first edition of the audio-visual exhibition Crosstalk for public viewing at the white cube section on the official Karl Bartos website. The program holds 21 films, remixes, cover versions, and mash-ups from Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, United Kingdom, the USA, and Japan. In March 2011, Karl Bartos released Mini-Composer, an iPhone app. It's a simple 16 steps sequencer with 4 basic waves synthesizer. It has been designed with Japanese artist Masayuki Akamatsu and the executive producer is Jean-Marc Lederman. On 15 March 2013 he released his next studio album, Off the Record, preceded by \\"Atomium\\" the first single taken from it.

He then entered the Malerschule of the Vienna Academy, and later became a private pupil of Professor Trenkwald. His most noted paintings refer to the life of Jews in Poland. They include: Der Besuch des Rabbi (the original of which was owned by Emperor Franz Joseph I, in the Kunsthistorisches Museum), Schachspieler, Der Zweifler (for which he received the gold medal at the Weltausstellung of 1873). Kaufmann's other honors include: the Baron K√∂nigswarter K√ºnstler-Preis, the gold medal of the Emperor of Germany, a gold medal of the International Exhibition at Munich, and a medal of the third class at the Exposition Universelle in Paris.

He was born in the city of Montpellier, where he lived and worked for most of his life. He became Professor of Botany and Director of the Royal Botanic Garden of Montpellier and held a seat in the Acad√©mie Royale des Sciences de Paris for a short while. He was one of the innovators who devised the botanical scheme of classification. He was the first to publish the concept of plant families as they are understood today, a natural classification of groups of plants that have features in common.  Youth and education  Pierre Magnol was born into a family of apothecaries (pharmacists). His father Claude ran a pharmacy as did his grandfather Jean Magnol. Pierre's mother was from a family of physicians. Pierre's older brother Cesar succeeded his father in the pharmacy. Pierre, being one of the younger children, had more freedom to choose his own profession, and wanted to become a physician. He had become devoted to natural history and especially botany at an early stage in his life, which might be regarded as self-evident for a son of a pharmacist. In Magnol's days, the study of botany and medicine were inseparable. Thus he enrolled as a student in medicine at the University of Montpellier on 19 May 1655. By Magnol's time the city of Montpellier was already long established as an important commercial and educational centre. The University of Montpellier was officially founded in 1289 (though it is said to be older) and it was the first French university to establish a botanic garden, donated in 1593 by Henry IV of France, for the study of medicine and pharmacology. Its medical school attracted students from all over Europe. Individuals well-known in medicine and botany such as Leonhart Fuchs (1501‚Äì1566), Guillaume Rondelet (1507‚Äì1566), Charles de l'Ecluse (1526‚Äì1609), Pierre Richer de Belleval (c. 1564-1632), and the great writer (and doctor) Fran√ßois Rabelais (c. 1493-1553), all studied at this university. So it was in one of the intellectual and botanical capitals that Magnol took his education. He got his doctor's degree (M.D.) on 11 January 1659. After receiving his degree, his attention once again shifted to botany, this time even more seriously.  Religion  Montpellier was a bastion of Protestantism and Magnol was raised in the tradition of Calvinism. At that time, Roman Catholicism was the official state church, but since the Edict of Nantes (1598), Protestants officially had religious freedom and the right to work in any field or for the state. The edict did not end religious persecution and discrimination. In his life, Magnol was several times denied a position because of religious discrimination. With the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, Magnol renounced Protestantism and converted to Catholicism.  Career  In December 1663 Magnol received the honorary title brevet de m√©decine royal through mediation of Antoine Vallot, an influential physician of the king. No means of his financial stability are mentioned (Magnol did not have a wealthy family to support him) but it is suggested that he was practicing medicine and had an income out of that. From 1659 on he devoted much of his time to the study of botany and made several trips through the Languedoc, the Provence, to the Alps and to the Pyrenees. In 1664 there was a vacancy for 'Demonstrator of plants' in Montpellier and Magnol was proposed for the position. He was denied the appointment because of religious discrimination. This happened again in 1667 when he was the leading candidate for the chair of Professor of medicine. Meanwhile Magnol had contacts with many prominent botanist and was highly esteemed by his contemporaries. He corresponded with John Ray, William Sherard and James Petiver (England), Paul Hermann and Petrus Houttuyn (Leiden), Jan Commelin (Amsterdam), J.H. Lavater (Zurich) and J. Salvador (Barcelona), among others. In 1687, after his conversion to Catholicism, Magnol eventually became 'Demonstrator of plants' at the botanic garden of Montpellier. In 1693, recommended by Guy-Crescent Fagon (1638‚Äì1718), then court physician, and his own student Joseph Pitton de Tournefort (1656‚Äì1708), he was nominated 'doctor to the kings court'. In 1694 he finally was appointed Professor of medicine at the University of Montpellier. Through intervention of Fagon, he received a brevet de professeur royale. Magnol was also appointed Director of the botanic garden in 1696, for a three-year period. After that, he received the title 'Inspector of the garden' for the rest of his life. Magnol was one of the founding members of the Soci√©t√© Royale des Sciences de Montpellier (1706) and held one of the three chairs in botany. In 1709 he was called to Paris to occupy the seat in the Acad√©mie Royale des Sciences de Paris that was left empty when his former student Joseph Pitton de Tournefort died prematurely. Among Magnol's students were Tournefort and the brothers Antoine and Bernard de Jussieu.  Major contribution to science  Magnol's most important contribution to science is without doubt the invention of the concept of plant families, a natural classification, based on combinations of morphological characters, as set out in his Prodromus historiae generalis plantarum, in quo familiae plantarum per tabulas disponuntur (1689) (See under major works). His work may be regarded as one of the first steps towards the composition of a tree of life. In his Prodromus he developed 75 tables, which not only grouped plants into families but also allowed for an easy and rapid identification by means of the morphological characters, the same he used to compose the groups.

[New genera of American plants]. Plumier honored several other notable persons by naming genera of plants after them. The name was later adopted by William Sherard, when he did the nomenclatural parts of Hortus Elthamensis by Johann Jacob Dillenius, and The Natural History of Carolina by Mark Catesby, to denote a flowering tree now known as Magnolia virginiana, taking it for the same species as that described by Plumier. Linnaeus took over this name in the first edition of Species plantarum, including references to both Plumier's and Sherard's names. In this way, Magnolia became the generally recognized name of a large genus of ornamental flowering trees.

Her name may mean \\"the bright one\\" (Old High German beraht, bereht, from Proto-Germanic *brehtaz) and is probably related to the name Berchtentag, meaning the feast of the Epiphany. Eugen Mogk provides an alternative etymology, attributing the origin of the name Perchta to the Old High German verb pergan, meaning \\"hidden\\" or \\"covered\\".Mogk according to Natko. Perchta is often identified as stemming from the same Germanic goddess as Holda and other female figures of German folklore (see Frija-Frigg). According to Jacob Grimm and Lotte Motz, Perchta is Holda's southern cousin or equivalent, as they both share the role of \\"guardian of the beasts\\" and appear during the Twelve Days of Christmas, when they oversee spinning.Grimm, 1882.Motz according to Hilton 1984. Grimm says Perchta or Berchta was known \\"precisely in those Upper German regions where Holda leaves off, in Swabia, in Alsace, in Switzerland, in Bavaria and Austria.\\"Grimm, 1882:272. According to Erika Timm, Perchta emerged from an amalgamation of Germanic and pre-Germanic, probably Celtic, traditions of the Alpine regions after the Migration Period in the Early Middle Ages.Timm according to Natko.  Names of Perchta  Perchta had many different names depending on the era and region: Grimm listed the names Perahta and Berchte as the main names (in his heading), followed by Berchta in Old High German, as well as Behrta and Frau Perchta. In Baden, Swabia, Switzerland and Slovenian regions, she was often called Frau Faste (the lady of the Ember days) or Pehta or 'Kvaternica', in Slovene. Elsewhere she was known as Posterli, Quatemberca and Fronfastenweiber.Ginzburg. The mother of the Franks emperor Charlemagne may have had a related albeit unwitted influence, as it did the Visigoth queen Brunhilda on her own, into its medieval folklore, Bertha or Berthrada was said to be of long and wide feet, in effect taller than her husband called precisely, Pippin the Short and may have been the reason why Charlemagne inherited from her his unusual height. In southern Austria, in Carinthia among the Slovenes, a male form of Perchta was known as Quantembermann, in German, or Kvaternik, in Slovene (the man of the four Ember days). Grimm thought that her male counterpart or equivalent is Berchtold.Grimm 1882:279. Regional variations of the name include Berigl, Berchtlmuada, Perhta-Baba, Zlobna Pehta, Bechtrababa, Sampa, Stampa, Lutzl, Zamperin, Pudelfrau, Zampermuatta and Rauweib. Description In some descriptions, Perchta has two forms; she may appear either as beautiful and white as snow like her name, or as elderly and haggard. In many old descriptions, Perchta had one large foot, sometimes called a goose foot or swan foot. Grimm thought the strange foot symbolized her being a higher being who could shapeshift to animal form. He noticed that Bertha with a strange foot exists in many languages (Middle German \\"Berhte mit dem fuoze\\", French \\"Berthe au grand pied\\", Latin \\"Berhta cum magno pede\\", Italian \\" Berta dai gran pi√®\\", title of a medieval epic poem of italian area): \\"It is apparently a swan maiden's foot, which as a mark of her higher nature she cannot lay aside...and at the same time the spinning-woman's splayfoot that worked the treadle\\".Grimm 1882:280-81. In the Tyrol she appears as little old woman with a very wrinkled face, bright lively eyes, and a long hooked nose; her hair is disheveled, her garments tattered and torn.  Traditional narratives  Initially, Perchta was the upholder of cultural taboos, such as the prohibition against spinning on holidays.Smith, John B. \\"Perchta the Belly-Slitter and Her Kin: A View of Some Traditional Threatening Figures, Threats and Punishments.\\" Folklore 115.2 (2004): 167-86 In the folklore of Bavaria and Austria, Perchta was said to roam the countryside at midwinter, and to enter homes during the twelve days between Christmas and Epiphany (especially on the Twelfth Night). She would know whether the children and young servants of the household had behaved well and worked hard all year. If they had, they might find a small silver coin the next day, in a shoe or pail. If they had not, she would slit their bellies open, remove their stomach and guts, and stuff the hole with straw and pebbles. She was particularly concerned to see that girls had spun the whole of their allotted portion of flax or wool during the year.Frazer 1920:240. She would also slit people's bellies open and stuff them with straw if they ate something on the night of her feast day, other than the traditional meal of fish and gruel. The cult of Perchta, under which followers left food and drink for Fraw Percht and her followers in the hope of receiving wealth and abundance, was condemned in Bavaria in the Thesaurus pauperum (1468) and by Thomas Ebendorfer von Haselbach in De decem praeceptis (1439). Later canonical and church documents characterized Perchta as synonymous with other leading female spirits: Holda, Diana, Herodias, Richella and Abundia.  Related beings  A Perchten mask Grimm thought Holda is her equivalent while the Weisse Frauen may derive directly from Berchta in her white form. The word Perchten is plural for Perchta, and this has become the name of her entourage, as well as the name of animal masks worn in parades and festivals in the mountainous regions of Austria. In the 16th century, the Perchten took two forms: Some are beautiful and bright, known as the Sch√∂nperchten (\\"beautiful Perchten\\"). These come during the Twelve Nights and festivals to \\"bring luck and wealth to the people.\\" The other form is the Schiachperchten (\\"ugly Perchten\\") who have fangs, tusks and horse tails which are used to drive out demons and ghosts. Men dressed as the ugly Perchten during the 16th century and went from house to house driving out bad spirits.Frazer 1920:242-243Wagner 2007. Sometimes, der Teufel is viewed as the most schiach (\\"ugly\\") Percht and Frau Perchta as the most sch√∂n (\\"beautiful\\") Percht. In Italy, Perchta is roughly equivalent with La Befana, who visits all the children of Italy on the night before 6 January to fill their socks with candy if they are well behaved or a lump of coal if they are not.Illes, p. 269. Interpretations According to Jacob Grimm (1882), Perchta was spoken of in Old High German in the 10th century as Frau Berchta and thought to be a white-robed goddess who oversaw spinning and weaving, like the myths of Holda. He believed she was the feminine equivalent of Berchtold, and was sometimes the leader of the Wild Hunt. However, John B. Smith disagrees and suggests that Perchta represents the personification of the feast of the Epiphany (Perchta's Day), and is therefore not pre- Christian.Hopkin, David. \\"Folklore and the Historian\\", The Folklore Historian, Vol. 17, Simon Bronner, 2000 Modern celebrations In contemporary culture, Perchta is portrayed as a \\"rewarder of the generous, and the punisher of the bad, particularly lying children\\". Today in Austria, particularly Salzburg, where she is said to wander through Hohensalzburg Castle in the dead of night,Vivian, Mrs. Herbert. \\"The Perchten Dancers of Salzburg\\", The Wide World Magazine: An Illustrated Monthly of True Narrative, Adventure, Travel, Customs and Sport, Vol. 21, 1908 the Perchten are still a traditional part of holidays and festivals (such as the Carnival Fastnacht). The wooden animal masks made for the festivals are today called Perchten. In the Pongau region of Austria large processions of Sch√∂nperchten (\\"beautiful Perchten\\") and Schiachperchten (\\"ugly Perchten\\") are held every winter. Beautiful masks are said to encouraging financial windfalls, and the ugly masks are worn to drive away evil spirits.Gallon, Stephanie. \\"Christmas Demons II - Krampus and Perchta\\", International Gothic Association, December 18, 2014 Other regional variations include the Tresterer in the Austrian Pinzgau region, the stilt dancers in the town of Unken, the Schnabelpercht (\\"trunked Percht\\") in the Unterinntal region and the Gl√∂cklerlaufen (\\"bell-running\\") in the Salzkammergut. A number of large ski-resorts have turned the tradition into a tourist attraction drawing large crowds every winter.

An Inner Dialogue with Frida Kahlo (Skull Ring), photograph by Yasumasa Morimura is a Japanese appropriation artist. He was born in Osaka and graduated from Kyoto City University of Arts in 1978. Since 1985, Morimura has primarily shown his work in international solo exhibitions, although he has been involved in various group exhibitions.  Education and early works  Yasumasa Marimura graduated from Ky≈çto City University of Arts in 1978, Philadelphia College of Art in 1982, and Columbia University in 1985. Then he served as an assistant at the university and devoted himself to painting, drawing, photography, and wood-block art. Morimura first attracted attention in 1988, when a number of his self-portraits were included in the Venice Bienalle's Aperto exhibition for young artists. Morimura's first published artword was a recreation titled Portrait (Van Gogh) in 1985 where he recreated Vincent van Gogh's famous portrait after he had cut off his ear. Next was his redoings of well-known pieces like (Mona Lisa in its Origin [1998]), (An Inner Dialogue with Frida Kahlo [Collar of Thorns] [2001]), (In Praise of Vel√°zquez: distinguished ones in confinement [2013]) and (A Requiem: Theatre of Creativity/Self-portrait as Pablo Picasso [2010]), world figures like Ch√© Guevara, Adolf Hitler, and Chairman Mao. Morimura's self-portraits were of Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe, Greta Garbo, and Liza Minnelli. Other earlier works include Little Sister (+ Elder Sister; 2 works), Angels Descending a Staircase, and Six Brides Six Brides all from 1991. Themes = Re-creating Western Art = Morimura borrows images of figures from history and art history (including: Douglas MacArthur, Emperor Hirohito, Audrey Hepburn, √âdouard Manet, Rembrandt, Cindy Sherman), and inserts his own face and body into them.Harumi Befu and Sylvie Guichard-Anguis, Globalizing Japan: Ethnography of the Japanese Presence in Asia, Europe and America, Routledge, 2003, p142. He also disguises himself as the principal subjects that appear in the artworks he is inspired by. Many of the works he puts himself in pushes cultural, racial, ethnic, and gender boundaries as an Asian male because most of the artworks he appropriates have Western subjects, particularly female subjects. These include Mona Lisa, Frida Kahlo's self-portraits, and the characters in Vel√°zquez's Las Meninas (1956). He also inserted himself into some of the Western male subjects, and the majority of those works mostly deal with race and ethnicity. Through the use of disguises, he overturns the effects of the male gaze, gender, race, ethnicity, and cultural standards, challenging the traditional methods of portraiture that he alters the original Western artworks by incorporating details related to Japanese culture. In one of his works, Portrait (Futago), Morimura changes the floral shawl from the original artwork, Olympia by Manet, with a kimono decorated with cranes. Because traditional portraits were mostly Western dominated, Morimura's combination of crossing multiple boundaries at a marginalized position became a major focus through his photographic works. He has also created a series of hybrid self-portraits modeled after the art of Frida Kahlo. = Parody and Pop-Culture = Parody is discussed as the postmodern strategy. It is theorized with regard to concepts of gender and sexual identities as performative acts, as much as to aesthetic practices. Using photography and his own body, Morimura re-images some of art history's masterpieces. As well as, images drawn from popular culture such as stills of female movie stars like Marilyn Monroe, Jodie Foster, Vivien Leigh, and Marlene Dietrich. Through his masterworks, Morimura transgresses his cultural and gender territories; from East to West and from male to female. His photographs also reveal that photography deconstructs the self-portrait, and that the photographic self- portrait is a new way of constituting and realizing the self, and of our contemporary way of seeing our own absence.  Exhibitions  Among others, Morimura's exhibitions have been shown at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (1992), the Cartier Foundation for Contemporary Art in Jouy-en-Josas, France (1993), the Hara Museum of Contemporary Art in Tokyo (1994), the Guggenheim Museum (1994), the Yokohama Museum of Art in Yokohama, Japan (1996), Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego (2006), the Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney (2007), and The Japan Society in New York City (2018).

Early life and writing Born in Angoul√™me, Albert-Birot moved to Paris in 1894. There he attended art school and befriended Gustave Moreau. He worked for five decades as a restorer for antique dealer Madame Lelong. He began writing after he met the musician Germaine de SurVille in 1913. Long before the First World War, he participated, as a painter, sculptor, poet, theater presenter, playwright and creator of groups and magazines, in the great adventure of modern art. His friend Apollinaire dubbed him \\"the Pyrogene,\\" so fiery was he as an innovator and exciter. From January 1916 to December 1919, Albert-Birote edited the avant-garde art magazine SIC, an acronym for Sons Id√©es Couleurs (Sounds Ideas Colors), which featured writings by Futurists, Surrealists, and Dadaists. SIC became the turntable of all avant-garde initiatives, from cubism or futurism and to surrealism, a movement that he will help to birth, but to which he will not adhere, this \\"blaster\\" having the religion of independence and objectivity. If he wrote a number of poem books (Thirty-one Pocket Poems; 1917; Daily Poems, 1919; La Triloferie, 1920; Poems to the Other Me, 1927; Amenpeine, La Cle des Champs, La Panthere noire, 1938; Natural Amusements, 1945; 110 drops of poetry, 1952, etc.) this work of an explosive lyricism, funny and eminently \\"modern\\" is inseparable from the theatrical work that Alber-Birot composed, from 1917 to 1922, in a burlesque tone which announces Ionesco: Larountala, Matoum and Trevibar, The man cut into pieces, the Bondieu, the folding women, etc, and it is dominated by two great epics in prose: Grabinoulor (1933) and the Memoirs of Adam (1943). His first volume of poems was Trente et un Po√®mes de Poche (1917). His novel Grabinoulor appeared in 1919. Grabinoulor, which was partially brought to light in 1964, is certainly his masterpiece and one of the most important works of \\"modern\\" poetry. Bernard Jourdan has finely established that the name of the hero of this poem-river, from which all punctuation is banned, is the almost successful anagram of \\"We Albert-Birot\\"; contemporary type, this Grabinoulor knows a host of adventures, some daily, others wonderful, which resemble him to the heroes of Rabelais and Lewis Caroll, but also, and above all, to the supermen of modern mythology, from Fantomas to Tarzan, from Arsene Lupine to science fiction superman, capable of traveling through the centuries as well as through the stars. We also owe to Pierre Albert-Birot, a singular man, poet on the fringes who exerted a great fascination for the new generations, fanciful novels like Remy Floche, employee (1934), learned translations of Homere, Eschyle and Virgile, transcriptions in modern French medieval poets and interesting studies on prosodic forms. Theater Albert-Birot directed the first performance of Les mamelles de Tir√©sias (Tiresias's Breasts, 1917) by Guillaume Apollinaire, a friend who had also been a contributor to SIC. He went on to compose numerous plays of his own, including Barbe-Bleue (Bluebeard); Les Femmes pliantes (The Flexible Woman); and L'homme coup√© en morceaux (The Dismembered Man). In 1929 he founded his own theater, Le Plateau, in which he produced his own series of short performance pieces entitled Pi√®ces-√âtudes.

Produced across five generations from 1961 to 2006, the model line began life primarily as a commercial vehicle, slotted above a kei truck in size. Through its production, Mazda used engine displacement to determine model designations; a B1500 was fitted with a 1.5 L engine and a B2600, a 2.6 L engine. In Japan, the B-series was referred to as the Mazda Proceed for much of its production, with several other names adopted by the model line. In Australia and New Zealand, the B-Series was named the Mazda Bravo and Mazda Bounty, respectively; South Africa used the Mazda Drifter name. Thailand used the Mazda Magnum, Mazda Thunder, and Mazda Fighter names. Through its association with Ford, Mazda produced the B-Series as the Ford Courier and the Ford Ranger. Conversely, the Ford Ranger was sold in North America as a Mazda B series from 1994 until 2010. In 2006, the Mazda B-Series was replaced by the Mazda BT-50. Historic trucks Mazda D1500 in Myanmar Mazda's first vehicles were three-wheeled trucks, also known as auto rickshaws starting with the Mazda-Go in 1931, followed with the Mazda K360 in 1959, the Mazda T-1500, and the larger Mazda T-2000. One of Mazda's first four-wheeled trucks was the 1958 D1100, briefly called the Mazda Romper, with a 1105 cc air-cooled in-line two cylinder engine installed under the seat. That engine was replaced by a water- cooled unit in 1959 and joined by the larger capacity D1500. In 1962, passenger car size requirements no longer applied to commercial vehicles and the truck grew longer, with a two-liter D2000 available and the smallest D1100 discontinued. The D1500 and D2000 remained in production until the June 1965 introduction of the Mazda Kraft.  First generation (1961‚Äì1965) The Mazda B-series pickup truck was introduced in Japan in August 1961 as the B1500 (BUA61). This model was the only Japanese market model to be badged under the B-series naming scheme, i.e. B1500. The BUD61 (second generation) that followed was the first model of the long-running \\"Proceed\\" series sold in Japan. It had a 1,484 cc OHV water-cooled engine with wet sleeve cylinders which produced , and a one-ton payload. This model also had a torsion bar front/leaf spring rear suspension, which was advanced for its time, giving it a relatively smooth ride. The B1500 was remodeled between late 1962 and September 1963; it received a new chassis code, BUB61. The BUB61 was more spacious; its cabin was extended by and it had a stretched body and wheelbase. The BUB61 had a new, upside-down, trapezoidal grille instead of the earlier full-width unit, with thirteen bars rather than nine, turn signals on the fenders, and more chrome trim‚Äîincluding a decor strip on the side. In addition to the standard two-door \\"styleside\\" pickup truck body there were also a double-cab truck, and a similar double-cab version called the \\"pickup.\\" The \\"pickup\\" had a fully integrated coup√© utility body rather than the separate bed of the truck version, as it was based on the somewhat passenger-oriented light van. This model was a two-door, fully glazed van with a fold-down tailgate and an electrically powered window, which was rare in the Japanese market at the time.Ozeki, pp. 144-145 The light van (BUAVD) was introduced in September 1962, and the two double-cab models followed shortly after. These three models were built on the shorter wheelbase chassis; when the longer chassis was introduced it was not deemed worthwhile to create new bodywork. These models were produced for only a few months. The B1500 was sleeker and considerably more powerful than its competitors in the Japanese market, but it was also markedly more expensive and it failed to sell in the expected quantities.Ozeki, p. 143  Second generation (1965‚Äì1977) The 1966 B1500/Proceed presented in October 1965 used the same 1484 cc OHV I4 engine as its predecessor, with minor changes to the cylinder head and valves and the use of a downdraft carburetor instead of the sidedraft unit used on the models sold between 1961 and 1965. The UA engine now produced at 5200 rpm.Ozeki, p. 156 The chassis was now called the \\"BUD61\\"; it was longer than its predecessor and received new bodywork of a squarer design, and four headlights. In January 1971, a 1600 cc model with the chassis code BNA61 was introduced. This had 95 PS SAE in global markets; US brochures did not specify its power output and European importers claimed DIN. In Japan, a minimum (SAE gross) was claimed; the model was advertised in Japan as the \\"GT-Truck\\". In March 1972, the Proceed 1300, with a smaller 1.3-liter engine, was released and remained available in Japan until 1975. It had in SAE gross. The B1500 was the first Japanese pickup truck to be assembled in New Zealand from CKD kits. Assembly started in 1967 at Steel's Motor Assemblies, which also built the Toyota Corona and later became Toyota New Zealand's Christchurch plant after a government order for 672 units. The model remained in local assembly at various plants for several generations. The B series was introduced to the United States with the 1972 B1600. In 1974, the similar rotary-powered Rotary Pickup was released in the US. The engine was enlarged to 1.8-liters for 1975's B1800, a model that had been available to Canadian customers since around 1970. It was known in the Japanese market as the \\"Proceed\\", where it was also sold as the Ford Courier. Its strong sales in the US market‚Äîmostly with Ford badging‚Äîrelieved Mazda's pressing cash flow troubles in the period following the 1970s energy crisis.

It is estimated that just over 15,000 units were built. Most were made for the 1974 model year (PA136 chassis), but the effect of the energy crisis on sales caused Mazda to restamp many of the 1974 models with a prefix \\"S\\", designating them as 1975 models; (SPA136). Approximately 700 units were built for the 1976 model year, when the four-speed manual transmission was upgraded to a five-speed. Mazda invested in a moderate redesign for the 1977 model (PA236), updating its electrical systems and adding a cab stretch for increased comfort. About 3,000 units were manufactured, after which the REPU was discontinued due to poor sales. Road & Track magazine was impressed with its \\"smooth, quiet power\\" and \\"nice\\" interior.Road & Track, July 1974 The vehicle retailed for about ; its observed fuel economy was . Most of the trucks are found on the West Coast of the US; they continue to be sought out by enthusiasts. Like many Mazda rotary vehicles, the REPU was raced. It took third place in the 1976 SCCA Mojave 24 Hour Rally driven by Malcolm Smith and Jack Sreenan.http://rallyracingnews.com/scca/rally/mojave76.html = Ford Courier = Ford Courier The first generation Ford Courier was introduced for the 1972 model year and sold for a little over when introduced‚Äîclose to the price of a Ford F-100. The Courier was manufactured by Toyo Kogyo (Mazda), and imported and sold by Ford Motor Company as a response to the unforeseen popularity of the small Toyota and Nissan (Datsun) pickups among young buyers in the West. Like the other mini-pickups of the time, it featured a sub-2.0-liter, four- cylinder engine, a four-speed manual transmission, rear wheel drive, a load capability of , and was fairly inexpensive compared to full-size pickups of the time. To circumvent the 25 percent chicken tax on light trucks, Couriers like Chevrolet LUV's were imported in \\"cab chassis\\" configurations, which included the entire light truck without the cargo box or truck bed, and were only subject to a 4 percent tariff. Subsequently, a truck bed would be attached to the chassis and the vehicle could be sold as a light truck. The body styling was effectively that of the related Mazda B series, but its frontal treatment was unique; its grille was designed to emulate that of the larger Ford F series and large, single headlights were fitted instead of the B series's smaller twin units. When the Courier was introduced, it was supplied with a 1.8-liter overhead cam engine that produced at 5,070 rpm and at 3,500 rpm. A four-speed manual transmission was standard; a three-speed automatic option was also offered. A five-speed manual option was added in 1976. Badging was changed several times in the first generation of the series. In 1972, the tailgate read \\"Ford Courier\\" in large, raised letters; there was a small \\"Courier\\" badge on the front of the hood. From 1973 until 1976, the hood badging read \\"Ford\\". In 1973, the tailgate read \\"Courier\\" in large letters, with a small \\"Ford\\" badge on the upper left. In 1974, it read \\"Ford\\" in large letters, with a small \\"Courier\\" badge on the lower right. In 1976, the cab was lengthened by and extra trim was added to the grille.  Third generation (PE/UC/UD; 1977‚Äì1985) The model's third generation was introduced in April 1977 as the PE chassis for the Proceed 1600. The Japanese model had a claimed and a top speed of . The new model was more comfortable than the previous; it had a woodgrain dashboard and other luxuries. Outside Japan it was sold as the B1600 and later as the B1800, which was originally sold only in North America. In the US for the 1980 model year, it was sold as the B2000, which used a 2.0-liter F/MA engine, replacing the B1800. The diesel 2.2-liter B2200 was sold from 1981 with the chassis code UD (introduced during 1982 for the United States). In the US, the 1984 B2000 continued to be sold through 1985; the next generation only appeared as a \\"1986\\". The 2.0-liter version was called PE2M6/M7 until 1981‚Äî\\"6\\" for the short wheelbase, \\"7\\" for the long bed‚Äîafter which it had the chassis code UC. In Japan, this truck was discontinued in October 1979 because commercial customers preferred vans over the less space- efficient, bonneted trucks. 1983 Mazda B2200 (UD) The B2000 was also available in a long-bed version with a longer wheelbase and rear overhang, which was given the model name Sundowner in some markets‚Äîa reference to nomadic Australian herders who would make camp wherever they were at sundown. The regular model code UC11 was changed to UC21 when it was fitted with a long bed. The chassis coding system used for the US market in 1981 when a standardized VIN code was introduced. This change led to a second coding system, complicating the identification and grouping of these trucks. The B series was reskinned during 1982, with new sheetmetal below the belt line, and was replaced in January 1985. By this time, 1.8 million Mazda B-series trucks had been built since 1961. In Australia and New Zealand, the Courier was a compact pick-up built for Ford by Mazda in Japan. It was first offered on the Australian market in 1979.Green Book Price & Model Guide, July‚ÄìAugust 1983, page 99. Both Mazda and Ford versions for New Zealand were assembled locally. Gulf Auto Restorations in New Zealand also built a run of double-cab Ford Couriers in 1979, long before Mazda themselves developed such a model.

The truck was available with front disc brakes and a Ford-built 2.3-liter engine option, which was the same engine used in the Ford Pinto and Mustang II. The key feature distinguishing the Courier from Mazda's B series was the single headlights, although with park and indicator lights were placed inset starting in 1978. 1977 models retained the turn signal lights in the bumper. In 1979, the base model engine was increased in size to 2.0-liters. The optional Ford 2.3-liter engine was produced in Brazil. The Courier was never available with a diesel engine in the US. However, the 1982 Mazda B2200 was available with the S2, a Perkins-built 4.135, 2.2-liter four-cylinder diesel engine, producing at 4000 rpm. This diesel engine was also available for the 1983 and 1984 Ford Ranger; for the 1985 to 1987 Ford Rangers it was replaced with the 2.3-liter 4D55T turbo diesel. 1985 Ford Courier camper (facelift, New Zealand) The Courier continued to be sold in North America until the model year 1982, when power steering was added. For 1983, Ford of North America introduced its own Ford Ranger to fill its compact truck segment, which replaced the Courier in the US and Canadian markets. In other markets such as Australasia, this generation of Courier continued to be sold until 1985, when the next generation was introduced. Australian models were redesigned in 1982 or 1983.  Electric variants  Between 1979 and 1982, a number of electric Ford Couriers were produced. Jet Industries purchased \\"vehicle gliders\\"‚ÄîFord Courier bodies without engines, and fitted them with a series-connected direct current motor and lead-acid accumulators; they labeled the vehicles the Jet Industries ElectraVan 750. These were sold mainly as service trucks, generally to local government departments. They had a top speed of around , and covered on a full charge. A number of these vehicles still exist, usually with upgraded motor control systems and higher-voltage battery packs.  Fourth generation (UF; 1985‚Äì1998) A new Proceed/B series (UF) was introduced in January 1985; it was produced until June 1999. A five- speed manual transmission was the primary choice in most markets, with options of a four-speed automatic transmission option and part-time four wheel drive. The 2.6-liter, Mitsubishi-powered B2600 was added in 1986. 1987 saw the Mazda inline-four engine upgraded to 2.2-liters in the B2200; the smaller engine was phased out of the North American markets after that year. In 1988, the Mitsubishi engine was replaced with a new family of Mazda powerplants. This generation also returned to the Japanese market as the \\"Proceed\\", where it was marketed mostly as a \\"lifestyle\\" truck. From 1991, an SUV/RV version of this generation was manufactured and sold as the Proceed Marvie; this was sold as the Ford Raider in Australia. The Proceed Marvie had a UV chassis code. It had three rows of seats, with the rearmost accessible by walking past the second row on the left. This car was only offered with right-hand-drive. A similar version of the vehicle was developed in Thailand, where it was sold as a version of the Mazda B series. In 1988, the larger Mitsubishi carbureted engine was replaced with Mazda's more powerful, 2.6-liter, four-cylinder, fuel-injected engine. The new model was named B2600i‚Äî\\"i\\" for injection. Both Mazda B series and the Ford Courier versions were assembled from CKD kits in New Zealand. The New Zealand lineup started with the 2.2 diesel with , with the petrol 2.2 offering and the fuel injected 2.6 . In South Africa, South African Motor Corporation (SAMCOR)‚Äînow Ford SA‚Äîfitted the B series with the 3.0- and later the 3.4-liter Ford Essex V6 as a range-topping engine option. The Essex engine was produced at Ford's Struandale engine plant in Port Elizabeth. In Zimbabwe, the B series was assembled at the Willowvale Mazda Motor Industry plant in Willowvale, Harare, where it was fitted with the 1.6 and 1.8-liter engines.

In addition to the standard cab which was available with a short bed or long bed, Mazda offered an extended cab version with jump seats called the Cab Plus. For three consecutive years (1986, 1987, 1988), Mazda trucks were rated number one in overall customer satisfaction by J.D. Power and Associates.Video \\"1989 Mazda \\"Come Drive A Mazda\\" Ad\\", accessed on 7 September 2020 19:34:10 UTC  Models  For the 1986 model year, the only available models were the B2000 (only available in 4x2) and the B2600 4x4. The latter model was powered with a 2.6-liter Mitsubishi-sourced carbureted motor. The B2200 was introduced as a replacement for the B2000 in 1987, and the B2000 was discontinued after the 1987 model year. For the 1989 model year, the B2600 was given a Mazda G6 fuel-injected engine and was renamed the B2600i. At this point, the B2600i became available either in 4x4 or 4x2, alongside the B2200 which remained only available as a 4x2. All B2600i models were equipped with a different hood with a distinct center bulge to accommodate the larger motor. The B2600 4x4 and subsequent B2600i 4x4 models had their own styling distinctions such as fender flares, a wider front bumper, and mud guards.  Trim levels  For the 1986‚Äì89 model years, there were three trim levels available in North America: base, SE-5, and LX. For the 1990‚Äì93 model years, the LX trim level was renamed the LE-5. The base model was a utilitarian vehicle and featured no amenities. The standard cab came standard with breathable vinyl upholstery, full brushed-nap carpeting, and steel wheels with blackwall radial tires. The Cab Plus base model came standard with body side pinstripes, swing-out rear side windows, checkered tweed reclining bucket seats, full cut-pile carpeting, a sports-type moulded shifter boot, a remote control fuel-filler door release, and a storage box for jack and tools. The SE-5 was marketed as the sporty trim level, with standard features including dual large black 'tow' mirrors, a black rear step bumper, full cut-pile carpeting, AM/FM stereo, white and black painted spoker wheels with white- letter Bridgestone SF Radial tires, and a prominent stripe kit. The LX was the top-of-the-line trim level, and marketed as a luxury truck. It came standard with chrome trim all around, driver's lumbar support adjustment, herringbone tweed upholstery, fully upholstered door panels with lower door carpeting and map pockets, full cut-pile carpeting, day/night rearview mirror, passenger sun visor vanity mirror, 'headlamps on' warning buzzer, windshield washer fluid level warning light, locking glove box, wrapped steering wheel, AM/FM stereo, tachometer, temperature gauge, digital quartz clock, tinted glass, sliding rear window, dual black mirrors, body side mouldings, pinstripes, a black rear step bumper, chrome spoker wheels with white-letter Bridgestone SF Radial tires. For an additional $650 option (1986 price), LX model buyers could opt for the Convenience Package, which added an electronic tuning AM/FM radio and cassette player with four speakers, power steering, tilt steering wheel, cruise control, halogen headlamps, and two-tone paint (initially available in Dover White/Sunset Wine, Sparkling Black/Sunbeam Silver, Ondo Blue/Tornado Silver, and later available in Bayside Blue/Caspian Blue, Sunbeam Silver/Caspian Blue, and Brilliant Black/Sunbeam Silver).  Appearance  Although the North American Mazda B series remained largely unchanged throughout its eight-year run, there were minor cosmetic refreshes. For instance, 1986 was the only model year when models had a small chrome and white \\"ma·¥¢·¥Öa\\" emblem on its grille. For the 1987 model year, it was replaced with a larger painted plastic piece to match the colors of the grille itself. This remained unchanged throughout the remainder of the B series' run. The 1986‚Äì87 B2000 featured a tailgate with a large \\"ma·¥¢·¥Öa\\" logo stamped into the center; all other models featured a flat tailgate with a smaller Mazda decal applied to the lower right corner. The 1990 model year saw the first major refresh in the B series: the front bumper and grille, which had been painted a dark metallic satin grey with light grey headlight bezels, were changed to black with light grey headlight bezels. Also for 1990, the wheels for the B2600i 4x4 SE-5 were changed from chrome to a new alloy design. For the 1991 model year, the LE-5 4x2 models also received alloy wheels. In the SE-5, the most noticeable yearly changes were the gradual disappearance of its stripes. The 1986 SE-5 model featured a stripe kit that covered a large portion of the body (running along the waistline of the front fenders and doors, and along the shoulder of the bed), with bold lines separating a monochrome color scheme and reading \\"SE-5\\" in front of the taillights (written either in black or white). The 1987 SE-5's stripes were reduced to a more subtle set of lines running along the body's waistline and swinging upwards towards the taillights where they read \\"SE-5\\" (this variant of stripes was available in either a dark blue/yellow/medium blue/light blue color scheme or a dark grey/red- orange/medium grey/light grey color scheme). The 1989 SE-5 featured a less prominent gradient-style stripe kit that started from the waistline of the doors and ran across towards the taillights. This variant remained mostly unchanged until the end of the B series' run in 1993.  End of production  For the North American markets, Mazda spent more than to design and develop the 1986‚Äì1993 B-series trucks to meet consumer demands. Partway through the 1994 model year, beginning in limited markets in June and expanding to the whole country in September, Mazda introduced a rebadged version of the Ford Ranger. This was done to save costs related to the Chicken tax; the truck was produced at Ford's Twin Cities Assembly Plant in Minnesota and at Edison Assembly in New Jersey. Because of declining sales and a lack of significant updates to its parent platform, the Ford-built B series was discontinued after the 2009 model year. The North American Ranger was discontinued at the end of 2011 with the closure of the Twin Cities plant. = Ford Courier / Raider= From 1991 to 1997 a badge-engineered version of the Mazda Proceed Marvie wagon was sold as the Ford Raider. Like the Mazda version, it was an SUV/MPV based on the Proceed/B-Series/Ranger/Courier.

Production at the AutoAlliance Thailand plant began in May 1998. It has the chassis code \\"UN\\". This model was also sold as the Ford Ranger in Europe and Asia and as the Ford Courier in Australia and New Zealand. Production also began that year at the Ford Motor Company Philippines plant. CKD versions were also assembled in South Africa and Ecuador. In March 2002 a 2892 cc (2.9-liter) version of the naturally aspirated 2.5-liter diesel engine was also developed and sold in \\"general markets\\" and the Gulf States as the B2900. The truck was sold in more than 130 countries under a variety of names. It was called the Fighter and Ranger in Southeast Asia‚Äîexcept in Singapore where it was called the Proceed‚Äîthe Mazda Bounty and Ford Courier in New Zealand, the Mazda Bravo in Australia, and the Mazda Drifter in South Africa. The B2600/B2200s sold in Venezuela and nearby Latin American countries were assembled in Colombia by Compa√±√≠a Colombiana Automotriz S.A. (CCA). They had a 2.6-liter inline-four engine, four-wheel-drive model and an entry level model with a 2.2-liter inline-four with rear-wheel-drive. In 2002, a \\"Freestyle\\" model with rear suicide doors became available on this platform. The rest of the range was revised in 2002 and 2004. These models are unrelated to the Mazda B-series and Ford Ranger models in North America. In Australia, in January 2005, the Courier received a 4.0 V6. It was available in GL (Super Cab and Double Cab) and XLT (Double Cab only) trims. The B series was released in September 2005, with the B4000 Bravo DX (Dual Cab only), DX+ (Freestyle and Dual Cab) and SDX (Freestyle and Dual Cab) trims being available. There were two fuel tank sizes available. For the 2WD Stretch Cab and Dual Cab, the fuel tank size is 63 L. For all 4WD models (and the 2WD Regular Cab), the fuel tank size is 70 L.  Ford-produced vehicles  2002-2009 Mazda Truck B4000 extended cab For the 1994 model year, Mazda North America ended sales of the fourth-generation (UF) B-Series, replacing the model line with a Mazda-badged version of the Ford Ranger. Effectively in reverse of the of agreement that produced the Ford Courier for 1972-1982, the Mazda B-Series for Mazda North America was produced by Ford for 1995. Shifting from Hiroshima, Japan, the B-Series was produced alongside the Ranger in St. Paul, Minnesota in the Ford Twin Cities Assembly facility. The B-Series was the second Mazda light truck produced by Ford, following the 1991-1994 Mazda Navajo (a three-door Ford Explorer). In shifting the production of the model line from Japan to Minnesota, Mazda was able to entirely circumvent the 25% \\"chicken tax\\" applied to light trucks. After struggling to establish market share in North America during the 1980s against Toyota and Nissan, the B-Series was shifted to highest-selling model line in segment. Sharing identical mechanical underpinnings with the Ranger, the 1994 Mazda B-Series was produced with a high degree of visual similarity to its Ford counterpart. The B-Series received distinct body panels for the front fascia and pickup truck bed; extended cabs were distinguished with separate exterior trim. Through its production, the Ford-produced B-Series followed the development of the Ranger in its body and chassis, undergoing a substantial update for the 1998 model year. For 2002, Mazda renamed the B-Series as the Mazda Truck in North America. During the 2000s, the Mazda Truck was gradually phased out of the Mazda product range and was discontinued after 2009 in the United States (2010 in Canada); the final vehicle was produced on 11 December 2009. As of current production, Mazda North America has no current plans to market the Mazda BT-50 in North America.

It is an independent, not-for-profit, global organisation, supported by government and NGO membership from around the world. Based mostly in the developing world, it has 20 regional, national or project offices in all continents and a head office in Ede, the Netherlands. The NGO works in over 100 countries and at different scales to tackle problems affecting wetlands. With the support of dozens of governmental, NGO and corporate donors and partners, it supports about 80 projects. Wetlands International's work ranges from research and community-based field projects to advocacy and engagement with governments, corporate and international policy fora and conventions. Wetlands International works through partnerships and is supported by contributions from an extensive specialist expert network and thousands of volunteers. History It was founded in 1937 as the International Wildfowl Inquiry and the organisation was focused on the protection of waterbirds. Later, the name became International Waterfowl & Wetlands Research Bureau (IWRB). The scope became wider; besides waterbirds, the organisation was also working on the protection of wetland areas. Later, organisations with similar objectives emerged in Asia and the Americas: the Asian Wetland Bureau (AWB) (initiated as INTERWADER in 1983) and Wetlands for the Americas (WA) (initiated in 1989). In 1991, the three organisations started to work closely together. In 1995, the working relation developed into the global organisation Wetlands International.History of Wetlands International Wetlands International works in many thematic areas throughout the world, including the links between peatlands and climate change, as well as wetlands and waterbird migration, based on extensive research as well as field projects.About Wetlands International, Wetlands International It coordinates the International Waterbird Census, a large-scale citizen science project with decades of data. Key areas of work Currently, Wetlands International has four strong areas of work, which are: =Peatlands= Wetlands International's peatlands work is focused in Eurasia and southeast Asia. The peatswamp forests of Central Kalimantan are studied and worked on in particular for climate mitigation. The project Restoring peatlands in Russia is a joint-effort with the government and Greifeswald University, and was recognised by the UNFCCC with a Momentum for Change award in 2017, for storing up to 200,000 tonnes CO2e of carbon emissions every year by rewetting peatlands and preventing fires. In the severely degraded peat lands of Central Kalimantan (Indonesia), drainage canals and logging have had disastrous impacts in an attempt to convert the unsuitable peatswamps into rice fields. By building small dams and blocks, the drainage of the area was stopped, preventing further oxidation of the peat soil. The area was then reforested with native tree species and community fire brigades to prevent the island's huge problem of peat fires. =China‚Äôs Ruoergai marshes= Previous work in China has included the Ruoergai marshes, and new work is looking at the Yellow Sea/Bohai migratory bird flyway. Runoff from the glaciers in the Himalayas towards China‚Äôs lowland is regulated and stored in the Ruoergai marshes. The Wetlands International China office worked to have this peatland declared a Ramsar site, giving the Chinese government the obligation to protect the area. Furthermore, because of the work with the local Chinese authorities in measuring the impact of different management options, peat mining and drainage are now no longer allowed in Ruoergai and the neighbouring counties. This also leads to improved water supply to the Yellow River and Yangtze River. =Turberas of Tierra del Fuego, Argentina = In Tierra del Fuego, Argentina, the Wetlands International Latin America office built awareness of sustainable use of the peatlands from the local to the national level, which have contributed to their protection. =Coastal wetlands= Coastal wetlands such as mangrove forests and coral reefs reduce the impact of storms. Mangroves can even cope with sea-level rise and provide protection from impacts of waves. =Dryland regions= In dryland regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, less rainfall and longer droughts increase the already huge importance of the Sahelian wetlands, and at the same time threaten overexploitation of these areas. Wetlands International works in Mali to improve the livelihoods and water provision of communities in the Inner Niger Delta in a changing climate. =Biodiversity and waterbirds= Wetlands International works to protect and restore the rich biodiversity of wetlands. Millions of waterbirds depend on wetlands like marshes, lakes and coastal zones. Wetlands International coordinates an International Waterbird Census in most countries of the world outside the USA where it approximates to the Christmas Bird Count run by the Audubon Society. The census takes place in 143 countries, divided into five regions, visiting 15,000 sites over 60 years. Promoting the protecting of wetlands along the flyways of waterbirds Wetlands International promotes the establishment of ecological networks of well managed, protected wetlands, along the main flyway routes of migratory waterbirds. These wetlands provide stepping stones for migratory waterbirds; crucial for their survival. Wetlands International supports international governmental agreements to create these networks.

It was intended to move BT's telephone network from the AXE/System X Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) to an Internet Protocol (IP) system. As well as switching over the PSTN, BT planned to deliver many additional services over their new data network, such as on-demand interactive TV services. BT originally stated that it would accrue annual savings of ¬£1 billion when the transition to the new network was completed, and hoped to have over 50% of its customers transferred by 2008 (see External links below for current progress on the roll-out of optical fibre by Openreach). Capital expenditure was put at ¬£10 billion over five years, this being 75% of BT's total capital spending plans in that period.  Architecture  The new network is based on an architectural model of five classes of network nodes. These are: * Premises * Access (MSAN) * Metro * Core * iNode = Premises = Premises nodes includes residential, small-medium enterprise (SME) and enterprise. The presumption is that all these will have high speed connections to the network, delivered over copper (in the form of ADSL or other DSL technologies) or over fibre, as either PON or direct fibre in the case of large enterprises. The sole exception to this presumption is for legacy PSTN, where provision will continue to be made for analogue voice. = Access node = 21CN introduced the concept of the multi-service access node (MSAN). This logical node takes the various access technologies (mentioned above) and, where possible, aggregates these onto a single backhaul network technology. This includes converting analogue voice into voice over IP (VoIP) using the MSAN as a media gateway (MGW). The aim is to implement a few hundred access nodes. Note that these will not have any IP routing capability, but will essentially be layer 2 Ethernet devices. = Metro node = The backhaul network will terminate on the metro nodes. At this point the IP-based services will be implemented, and the metro nodes are the first location where IP traffic is routed. Call control (via a softswitch or an IMS CSCF) will be implemented here, although the softswitches and the IMS components won't be described as a part of the metro node ‚Äì they are parts of the iNode. The metro nodes are also provider edge (PE) routers in MPLS terminology, encapsulating the IP traffic in MPLS tunnels for transmission over the core. The aim is to implement around 100 metro nodes. = Core node = The core nodes are MPLS switches, with the MPLS traffic carried over optical (DWDM) transport. They are completely unaware of customer IP traffic, and only switch based on MPLS tags (all customer IP traffic is encapsulated with an MPLS header by the metro node PEs). Native IP is only used by the core nodes for protocols such as MP- BGP, an IGP, LDP, and RSVP to exchange routing and label information between all core and metro nodes. The aim is to have approximately 10 core nodes. = iNode = iNodes are the logical nodes that provide the control for the services implemented using the other four types of node. BT has announced that it intends to create an IMS based iNode capability, although its initial PSTN replacement will not be an IMS implementation. The iNode will implement a set of standardized functions ‚Äì common capabilities ‚Äì that deliver layered services. Common capabilities include session management, authentication, profile, address book, presence and location. Combinations of these capability primitives will be used to deliver different service types and functionality. The iNode is built upon the AXE telephone exchange TSS (Telephony Softswitch Server) and is currently using HP Alpha processors (APZ 212 50) as well as the IS-Blade in the APZ logic. After extensive field testing in the South Wales Pathfinder area, all current logical and intelligent network services now operate in conjunction with the existing PSTN and the MPLS network.  Differences  The most significant differences between the legacy 20th century network (20CN) and 21CN are: * The use of VoIP landline telephone services served digitally, rather than the previous analogue PSTN system. This does not mean telephone services are provided over the Internet with 21CN. In reality this will make no difference to the end user. * The availability of ADSL2+ (including ADSL2+ Annex M) broadband services. The 20CN allows services up to ADSL Max with a maximum download throughput of 8Mbit/s whereas ADSL2+ allows a maximum theoretical download throughput of 24Mbit/s. * The retirement of legacy IPstream data services previously available with 20CN.  Evolution towards FTTC  Any chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and in the case of 21CN, its weakest link - the access network - is also its most valuable. Although the architecture of 21CN simplifies the network plant, it does not look to solve the problem which will have the greatest effect on data rate, that is loop length i.e. the length of cable from the exchange to the customer. Unlike the active core network, the access network is a passive network and has no capability for self-discovery. Reasonable consumer expectations can be established based upon the length and characteristics of these wires. A more global model would require precise knowledge of wire material (e.g. copper or aluminium), where the wires are routed, and the direction in which traffic flows around the circuit. This information is not held at present, and would need significant effort to obtain. By moving the MSANs deeper into the network, i.e. to street side cabinets, length issues are more likely to be reduced; however, line transmission characteristics are still highly variable since lines may be bridged with materials other than copper (such as aluminium) which have a degrading effect on conductivity and hence signal strength. In addition changes in wire gauge (thickness) are common and introduce signal reflection due to changes in impedance. The original 21CN design did not look to drive MSANs deeper into the network; instead it locates them in each exchange. Without detailed information on the critical local routings, it is difficult to ascertain what capacity remains in the duct network and which connections run through it. This makes planning of future upgrades or fibre additions difficult. Openreach considered integrating MSANs into the access network, although this was originally deemed unlikely to happen because there are only 5,600 exchange buildings and over 85,000 'primary connection points', usually in the form of street cabinets. However, in July 2007, Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of BT, stated that BT was considering fibre to the kerb and that VDSL2 was a 'likely development going forward'. In October 2007, Ofcom launched a consultation into Next Generation Access Networks in the UK after pressure from the government. Subsequently, Openreach began a rollout of VDSL2 FTTC technology over 21CN, deploying DSLAMs in thousands of new street-side cabinets. BT Retail launched their BT Infinity service in 2010BT launches 40 Mb BT Infinity broadband service Macworld UK, published 2010-01-22, accessed 2010-10-27 and expected to continue expanding availability by installing new cabinets until at least 2014.Fibre Broadband (FTTC / FTTH) Guide Thinkbroadband, accessed 2012-04-21 The FTTC deployment essentially installs a small (96-288 line) DSLAM into thousands of street cabinets, each backhauled using direct fibre to a larger exchange or metro node, removing much of the local-loop length limitations and allowing end-user speeds exceeding 100 Mbit/s following future upgrades. Suppliers In April 2005, BT announced that it had selected eight suppliers for its 21CN roll-out. These were: *Fujitsu ‚Äì MSAN *Huawei ‚Äì MSAN and core optical *Alcatel ‚Äì metro *Lucent ‚Äì core MPLS, using Juniper components *Cisco ‚Äì metro and core MPLS *Siemens ‚Äì metro, using Juniper components *Ciena ‚Äì core optical *Ericsson ‚Äì iNode Alcatel and Lucent merged in December 2006 to form Alcatel-Lucent. The fact that Britain's Marconi received no major 21CN contract was a surprise to commentators and sent the company's shares tumbling. An example of analysis before BT's announcement is Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein's: \\"[Marconi is] so advanced with its products and so entrenched with BT Group plc that its selection looks certain.\\" Criticism BT's plans for broadband internet access services were criticised. BT's main plan for providing Internet access was to upgrade their DSLAMs to ADSL2+ in the exchange. This was controversial because ADSL2+ was already an old technology and is limited to 24Mbit/s downstream, and would be even more dated by the time 21CN is completed. This led to criticisms that BT was not future proofing their network, since fibre, while more expensive to lay, is a lot more future-proof. Critics argue that fibre to the home would be more appropriate, which would mean replacing the current copper wire which supplies individual homes (the \\"last mile\\"). In late 2009, British ISP Andrews & Arnold reported severe issues with 21CN, citing multi-hour outages due to single points of failure and said that 21CN was not \\"fit for purpose\\" due to this and numerous other problems.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 16, 1993. In the episode, Springfield legalizes gambling to revitalize its economy. Mr. Burns opens a casino where Homer is hired as a blackjack dealer. Marge develops a gambling addiction, Bart opens a casino in his treehouse, and Burns' appearance and mental state deteriorate in a parody of Howard Hughes. The episode was written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, and directed by Wes Archer. Gerry Cooney and Robert Goulet guest starred as themselves. The episode features cultural references to the films Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, The Wizard of Oz, Rain Man, and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 11.7, and was the highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired. Plot At a town hall, Mayor Quimby fields suggestions on ways to improve Springfield's dwindling economy. Principal Skinner suggests the town legalize gambling to rejuvenate its economy; everyone, including frequent naysayer Marge, likes the idea. Mr. Burns and Mayor Quimby work together to build a casino, where Homer is hired as a blackjack dealer. Burns designs the casino himself, with his likeness atop a mermaid's body adorning its neon sign. While waiting for Homer's shift to end, Marge finds a quarter on the casino floor and uses it to play a slot machine. When she wins, she immediately becomes addicted to gambling. Bart is too young to gamble at Burns' Casino, so he starts his own casino in his tree house, tricking Robert Goulet into performing there. Burns grows even richer from his casino, but his appearance and mental state deteriorate, making him resemble Howard Hughes. He develops paranoia and a profound fear of microscopic germs, urinating in jars and wearing tissue boxes instead of shoes on his feet. Marge spends all her time at the casino and neglects her family. She fails to notice when Maggie crawls away from the slots and is nearly mauled by a white tiger from Gunter and Ernst's circus act. She forgets to help Lisa make a costume for her geography pageant, forcing her to wear one poorly designed by her father. Homer bursts into the casino searching for Marge. Security cameras capture his rampage, causing Burns to demote him to his old job at the power plant. After realizing how much he misses the plant, Burns decides to return to it. When Homer confronts Marge with her behavior, she realizes that she has a gambling problem. Lisa wins a special prize in the geography pageant because Homer's poor costume design makes the judges think she did it all by herself. Ralph receives the same prize for his primitive costume: a note taped to his shirt that reads \\"Idaho\\". Robert Goulet Production alt=A portrait of a man with black hair looking at the viewer The episode was written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, and directed by Wes Archer. The story of the episode originated from a newspaper article that Oakley and Weinstein found about a town in Mississippi that was introducing riverboat gambling. Oakley said another inspiration for it was that there had not been many episodes about Springfield as a whole and how \\"crummy\\" the town was, so they filled the whole first act with scenes showing how \\"crummy\\" and \\"dismal\\" Springfield was. Oakley particularly liked the animation of the lights inside the casino on the slot machines and the lamps in the ceiling. The \\"way they radiate out\\" had always amazed him. Archer, who directed the animation of the episode, also thought they turned out well. The lights were especially hard for them to animate back then because the show was animated traditionally on cels, so Archer was pleased with the results. A deleted scene from the episode shows Homer dealing cards to James Bond. The staff liked the scene, so they decided to put it in the clip show episode \\"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\\". There was a brief period when the episode had a different subplot that revolved around the restaurant chain Planet Hollywood. Groening had been told by a spokesperson that if he put Planet Hollywood in The Simpsons, the creators of the restaurant, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, and Sylvester Stallone, would agree to make guest appearances on the show. The writers of The Simpsons were excited about this so they wrote a new subplot for the episode that featured Planet Hollywood and the three actors. However, for unknown reasons, they were unable to appear in the episode. Instead, Gerry Cooney and Robert Goulet guest starred as themselves. Executive producer David Mirkin enjoyed directing Goulet because he was \\"such a good sport\\" and had \\"a great sense of humor\\". Oakley thought it was nice that Goulet was willing to make fun of himself in the episode, which at the time was rare for guest stars on The Simpsons. This episode features the first appearances of Gunter and Ernst, the Siegfried and Roy-esque casino magicians who are attacked by their white tiger, Anastasia. Ten years after this episode first aired, Roy Horn was attacked by one of the duo's white tigers. The Simpsons production team dismissed the novelty of the prediction by saying that it was \\"bound to happen\\" sooner or later. The Rich Texan also makes his debut appearance in this episode, referred to as \\"Senator\\" by Homer. Cultural references Mr. Burns's paranoid obsession with germs and cleanliness, and his refusal to leave his bedroom once the casino opens, is a parody of American magnate Howard Hughes. The title is a reference to the 1964 film Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, the music of which was composed by Laurie Johnson. Two of his songs, Happy-go-lively and Rue de la park can be heard within the News on Parade segment at the beginning of the episode. Burns' bed looks similar to the one occupied by Keir Dullea's character Dave Bowman in the end of the 1968 film, 2001: A Space Odyssey. Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise appear at the casino to reprise their roles from the 1988 film Rain Man. Homer is impressed by the card-counting abilities of a man who resembles Raymond Babbitt, Hoffman's character in the film.. Krusty's show at midnight is similar to Bill Cosby's 1971 album For Adults Only, which was recorded at a casino at midnight. Marge reminds Homer that his lifelong dream was to be a contestant on the television show The Gong Show. Burns's paranoid obsession with germs and cleanliness, and his refusal to leave his bedroom once the casino opens, parodies American magnate Howard Hughes, who had obsessive-compulsive disorder, and was involved in the casino business in his later years. The \\"Spruce Moose\\", an absurdly tiny wooden plane Burns makes in the episode, is a parody of Hughes' impractically enormous wooden plane, derisively nicknamed the \\"Spruce Goose\\". Homer parodies the scene in the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz when the Scarecrow demonstrates his newly acquired intelligence by (incorrectly) reciting the law that governs the lengths of the sides of an isosceles triangle. Unlike in the film, somebody correctly points out that the Pythagorean theorem recited applies only to right triangles, not isosceles triangles. Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"$pringfield\\" finished 35th in the ratings for the week of December 13 to December 19, 1993, with a Nielsen Rating of 11.7, translating to 11 million households. The episode was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that \\"this excellent episode includes a surprising number of concurrent plots. Homer also works in the casino and tries to care for the family without Marge. It balances them deftly and provides great laughs along the way.\\" Adam Suraf of Dunkirkma.net named it the third best episode of the season. He also praised the episode's cultural references. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: \\"There's a lovely nod to the earlier episodes in which Marge protests the citizenry's hare-brained ideas at council meetings. A series of bizarre moments rather than a story‚Äîwe're especially fond of Homer's photographic memory and Mr Burns' descent into insanity‚Äîbut great fun.\\" Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of A, and Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave it a score of 4 out of 5. The episode is Sarah Culp of The Quindecim's eleventh-favorite episode of the show, and one of Les Winan of Box Office Prophets's favorite episodes. A scene from the episode where former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger meets Burns was included in the 2002 documentary film The Trials of Henry Kissinger.

Soon after Reza Shah deposed the Qajar dynasty and made himself Shah of Iran in 1925, Prince Mohammad Hassan and his family were sent into permanent exile to England. In 1930, he declared himself the rightful heir to the crown as pretender to the throne. He died on 7 January 1943 in Maidenhead, England and was buried in Kerbala, Iraq.  Tension with Ahmad Shah Qajar  Even before the dethronement of his brother Ahmad Shah Qajar by Reza Shah, he was still an inconsequential figure in Iranian politics. This was not from a lack of trying however; in early march of 1921, the Mohammad Hassan Mirza approached the British legation with proposals to supplant his brother, the king of Iran at the time. The High Commissioner's office in Baghdad informed Herman Norman in a telegram that Zia'eddin Tabatabaee informed them that Mohammad Hassan Mirza was \\"very dissatisfied with the shah and fears for safety of Persia from the Bolsheviks...\\",FO 371/6446, Cox to Norman, Foreign Office and the Government of India, 10 July 1921. and that \\"he [Mohammad Hassan Mirza] is prepared to form new government as he considers the Shah useless...\\". Mohammad Hassan Mirza proposals were ignored, except by Percy Cox who was the former attache of Britain in Iran. Herman Norman who was current British diplomat to Iran thought of the dethronement of Ahmad Shah Qajar by his brother as a tactical mistake which would divide Persia; \\"[I am prevented] from encouraging any movement which has for its object dethronement of His Majesty.

He was a leading figure in the Rim√© movement. Having seen how the Gelug institutions pushed the other traditions into the corners of Tibet's cultural life, Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo and Jamg√∂n Kongtr√ºl Lodr√∂ Thay√© compiled together the teachings of the Sakya, Kagyu and Nyingma, including many near-extinct teachings, thus creating the Rim√© movement.Schaik, Sam van.

Yale University Press 2011, page 169. Biography Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo was born in 1820 on the 5th day of the 6th month of the Iron Dragon year of the 14th Rabjung, in the region of Yaru Khyungchen Drak in the village of Taerlung in Derge, Kham. His father was Rinchen Namgyal, the secretary of the king of Derge belonging to the Ny√∂ clan, and a descendant of Drikung Changchub Lingpa. His mother S√∂nam Tso was a daughter of Gerab Nyerchen G√∂ntse of the Sogmotsang family, from a Mongol background. At twelve, he was recognized by Thartse Khenchen Jampa Kunga Tendzin as the incarnation of Jampa Namkha Chim√©, and was given the name Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo Kunga Tenp√© Gyaltsen Palzangpo. At twenty-one, he received full ordination from Minling Khenchen Rigdzin Zangpo at Mindrolling Monastery. In all, he had more than one hundred and fifty teachers, who were masters from all four major Tibetan Buddhist schools from the regions of √ú and Tsang as well as Kham, including Minling Trichen Gyurme Sangye Kunga, Shechen Gyurme Thutob Namgyal, Sakyapa Dorje Rinchen and the khenpo brothers of Thartse, Ngorpa Tharts√© Khenpo Jampa Kunga Tendzin (1776‚Äì1862) and Tharts√© P√∂nlop Naljor Jampal Zangpo (b. 1789). In time, his fame spread throughout Tibet and he became known by the name of Pema √ñsel Dongak Lingpa, and renowned as a holder of the seven special transmissions (ka bab d√ºn). Disciples His many disciples included Jamg√∂n Kongtrul, Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso, Dodrupchen Jikm√© Tenp√© Nyima, Orgyen Chokgyur Lingpa, Tert√∂n Sogyal, Ayu Khandro and many other masters of the Nyingma school; the Sakya Trizin Tashi Rinchen, the fourth Zimwock Rinpoche of Nalendra Monastery, many of the khenpos of Ngor and many other masters of the Sakya tradition; the fourteenth and fifteenth Karmapas, the tenth and eleventh Tai Situpas, Taklungma Rinpoche and other holders of the Kagy√º teachings; K√∂nchok Tenpa Rabgy√©, the Nomihan of Drakyab, Lithang Khenchen Jampa Phuntsok, Horkhang Sar Gyalwa and other geshes of the Gelug tradition, and also followers of the Bon tradition.

The speech incarnation was the Second Beru Khyentse and the mind incarnation Dilgo Khyentse.

Early life Barnes' sports career began at Landis High School where he was a three sport star (baseball, football and basketball) and led his 1953 football team to an undefeated season. College career In the fall of 1953, Barnes enrolled at Wake Forest University. Barnes made the freshman team in 1953 and the varsity team the following year. As a junior in 1955, he led the team in rushing, punt returns, kickoff returns, pass interceptions and pass receptions, setting the ACC record in pass receptions (31) and yards out of the backfield (349). After the 1955 football season ended, he joined the baseball team at third base where he hit .319, led the league in stolen bases (17) and helped Wake Forest win the 1955 National Baseball Championship. In 1956, Barnes became the first player in the ACC to rush for more than 1,000 yards in a single season when he rushed for 1,010 yards. He was the second leading rusher in the nation, an All-American and 1956 ACC Player of the Year.http://www.theacc.com/sports/m-footbl/spec- rel/102709aab.html In 2009, he was inducted into the ACC Football Championship Game Legends Class. Professional career Barnes was drafted in the second round of the 1957 NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles. He made the Pro Bowl his first three years in the league (1957‚Äì1959) and was a key member of the backfield during the Eagles' 1960 NFL Championship team. During the title game against the Green Bay Packers, Barnes ran the ball 13 times for 42 yards. He had a nine-yard run and key 13-yard pass reception on the game-winning drive, and blocked Packer defensive end Bill Quinlan that helped Ted Dean to score the winning touchdown. Following the 1961 season, Barnes was traded to the Washington Redskins for center Jim Schrader. He had two good seasons with the Redskins, leading the team in rushing in 1962. Barnes was cut by the Redskins before the start of the 1963 season because of an injury he sustained during the pre-season. In 1965, Barnes returned to the Eagles as a free agent, but was traded to the Minnesota Vikings for a draft choice before the season began. Barnes retired following the 1966 season, and became head coach of the Continental Football League's Charleston Rockets in 1968. He eventually became an assistant coach in the NFL, and served as Norm Van Brocklin's backfield coach for the Atlanta Falcons.

The county town of Carlisle is located to the north east. Other nearby settlements include Crosscanonby, Edderside, Hayton, and Salta. Etymology 'Allonby' is \\" 'Alein's b»≥'...'Alein' is a French personal name of Breton origin.\\" ('B»≥' is a late Old English word from Old Norse 'b»≥r' and Swedish or Danish 'by' meaning 'village', 'hamlet'). Geographical aspect The village overlooks Allonby Bay in the Solway Firth. The area is within the Solway Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and the historic county of Cumberland. Allonby, and the five-mile coastal strip of the bay, has views across the Solway to the Galloway hills of southern Scotland. Both the South Saltpans beach and the West Winds beach were awarded the Blue flag rural beach award in 2005. The village is located on the Cumbria Coastal Way long distance footpath. History From the late 18th century until the mid 19th century, Allonby was home to a small fishing fleet. The main catch was herring. Fish yards were built where these were salted and packed in barrels made on the premises.‚ÄòMary Beeby's Memorandum' published by Cumbria Family History Society, Aug. 1998 There was also a smoke house where kippers were produced. In the early part of the 19th century Allonby was a popular sea-bathing resort. Baths were built in 1835. The buildings still survive as private residences in the Market Square.

He plays a wide variety of wind instruments, including saxophone, flute, and clarinet. He also occasionally plays guitar. Early life Parazaider was born in Maywood, Illinois, and began playing the clarinet at the age of 9. As a teenager, his growing talent was being groomed for a career as a professional orchestral musician, and he gained a Bachelor of Arts degree in classical clarinet performance from DePaul University. Career with Chicago Inspired by the Beatles hit \\"Got to Get You Into My Life\\", Parazaider became enamored with the idea of creating a rock 'n' roll band with horns. Early practice sessions at Parazaider's house included guitarist Terry Kath and drummer Danny Seraphine, who were both friends during his teenage years. Another friend who became involved was future Chicago producer James William Guercio. The band, originally called The Big Thing, eventually became Chicago with the addition of Lee Loughnane on trumpet, James Pankow on trombone, Robert Lamm on keyboards, and Peter Cetera on bass. Parazaider's primary musical role in the band has consisted of playing woodwinds on James Pankow's horn arrangements. Never a prolific writer, Parazaider's compositional contributions (\\"It Better End Soon: 2nd Movement\\", \\"Free Country\\", \\"Aire\\", \\"Devil's Sweet\\", \\"Window Dreamin'\\") have been few relative to the other members. Parazaider performs the highly recognizable flute solo in the Chicago hit \\"Colour My World\\", which became a popular 'slow dance' song at high school proms during the 1970s. The band's 1973 hit \\"Just You 'n' Me\\" also features a Parazaider solo, on soprano sax. In 2008, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters by DePaul University. He is also a member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia and was given the National Citation, being recognized as Signature Sinfonian along with fellow Chicago members and Sinfonians on August 26, 2009.

Most contemporary theories of technology reject two previous views: the linear model of technological innovation and technological determinism. To challenge the linear model, today's theories of technology point to the historical evidence that technological innovation often gives rise to new scientific fields, and emphasizes the important role that social networks and cultural values play in shaping technological artifacts. To challenge technological determinism, today's theories of technology emphasize the scope of technical choice, which is greater than most laypeople realize; as science and technology scholars like to say, \\"It could have been different.\\" For this reason, theorists who take these positions typically argue for greater public involvement in technological decision-making.  Social theories  'Social' theories focus on how humans and technology affect each other. Some theories focus on how decisions are made with humans and technology: humans and technology are equal in the decision, humans drive technology, and vice versa. The interactions used in a majority of the theories on this page look at individual human's interactions with technology, but there is a sub-group for the group of people interacting with technology. The theories described are purposefully vague and ambiguous, since the circumstances for the theories change as human culture and technology innovations change. Society and Technology. Who dominates Who? = Descriptive approaches = Social construction of technology (SCOT) ‚Äì argues that technology does not determine human action, but that human action shapes technology. Key concepts include: interpretive flexibility: \\"Technological artifacts are culturally constructed and interpreted ... By this, we mean not only is there flexibility in how people think of or interpret artifacts but also there is flexibility in how artifacts are designed.\\" Also, these technological artifacts determine and shape what that specific technology tool will symbolize and represent in society or in a culture. This is in relation to the SCOT theory because it shows how humans symbolize technology, by shaping it.  Relevant social group: shares a particular set of meanings about an artifact  'Closure' and stabilization: when the relevant social group has reached a consensus  Wider context: \\"the sociocultural and political situation of a social group shapes its norms and values, which in turn influence the meaning given to an artifact\\" : Key authors include MacKenzie and Wajcman (1985). * Actor-network theory (ANT) ‚Äì posits a heterogeneous network of humans and non-humans as equal interrelated actors. It strives for impartiality in the description of human and nonhuman actors and the reintegration of the natural and social worlds. For example, Latour (1992)Latour, B. (1992). Where are the missing masses? The sociology of a few mundane artifacts. In Bijker, W., and Law, J., editors, Shaping Technology/Building Society. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA argues that instead of worrying whether we are anthropomorphizing technology, we should embrace it as inherently anthropomorphic: technology is made by humans, substitutes for the actions of humans, and shapes human action. What is important is the chain and gradients of actors' actions and competencies, and the degree to which we choose to have figurative representations. Key concepts include the inscription of beliefs, practices, relations into technology, which is then said to embody them. Key authors include Latour (1997)Latour, B. (1997).

In Biagioli, M., editor, The Science Studies Reader, pages 67‚Äì83. Routledge, New York. *Structuration theory ‚Äì defines structures as rules and resources organized as properties of social systems. The theory employs a recursive notion of actions constrained and enabled by structures which are produced and reproduced by that action. Consequently, in this theory technology is not rendered as an artifact, but instead examines how people, as they interact with technology in their ongoing practices, enact structures which shape their emergent and situated use of that technology.

Organization Science, 3(3):398-427. * Systems theory ‚Äì considers the historical development of technology and media with an emphasis on inertia and heterogeneity, stressing the connections between the artifact being built and the social, economic, political and cultural factors surrounding it. Key concepts include reverse salients when elements of a system lag in development with respect to others, differentiation, _operational closure, and autopoietic autonomy._ Key authors include Thomas P. Hughes (1992) and Luhmann (2000).Luhmann, N. (2000). The reality of the mass media. Stanford, Stanford, CA. * Activity theory - considers an entire work/activity system (including teams, organizations, etc.) beyond just one actor or user. It accounts for the environment, history of the person, culture, role of the artifact, motivations, and complexity of real-life activity. One of the strengths of AT is that it bridges the gap between the individual subject and the social reality‚Äîit studies both through the mediating activity. The unit of analysis in AT is the concept of object- oriented, collective and culturally mediated human activity, or activity system. = Critical approaches = Critical theory goes beyond a descriptive account of how things are, to examine why they have come to be that way, and how they might otherwise be. Critical theory asks whose interests are being served by the status quo and assesses the potential of future alternatives to better serve social justice. According to Geuss'sGeuss, R. (1981) The Idea of a Critical Theory, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press. definition, \\"a critical theory, then, is a reflective theory which gives agents a kind of knowledge inherently productive of enlightenment and emancipation' (1964). Marcuse argued that whilst matters of technology design are often presented as neutral technical choices, in fact, they manifest political or moral values. Critical theory is a form of archaeology that attempt to get beneath common- sense understandings in order to reveal the power relationships and interests determining particular technological configuration and use. Perhaps the most developed contemporary critical theory of technology is contained in the works of Andrew Feenberg including 'Transforming Technology' (2002). * Values in Design - asks how do we ensure a place for values (alongside technical standards such as speed, efficiency, and reliability) as criteria by which we judge the quality and acceptability of information systems and new media. How do values such as privacy, autonomy, democracy, and social justice become integral to conception, design, and development, not merely retrofitted after completion? Key thinkers include Helen Nissenbaum (2001).Nissenbaum, H. (2001). How computer systems embody values. Computer, 34(3):120-118. = Group Theories = There are also a number of technology related theories that address how (media) technology affects group processes. Broadly, these theories are concerned with the social effects of communication media. Some (e.g., media richness) are concerned with questions of media choice (i.e., when to use what medium effectively). Other theories (social presence, SIDE, media naturalness) are concerned with the consequences of those media choices (i.e., what are the social effects of using particular communication media). * Social presence theory (Short, et al., 1976Short, J. A., Williams, E., and Christie, B. (1976). The social psychology of telecommunications. John Wiley & Sons, New York.) is a seminal theory of the social effects of communication technology. Its main concern is with telephony and telephone conferencing (the research was sponsored by the British Post Office, now British Telecom). It argues that the social impact of a communication medium depend on the social presence it allows communicators to have. Social presence is defined as a property of the medium itself: the degree of acoustic, visual, and physical contact that it allows. The theory assumes that more contact will increase the key components of \\"presence\\": greater intimacy, immediacy, warmth and inter- personal rapport. As a consequence of social presence, social influence is expected to increase. In the case of communication technology, the assumption is that more text-based forms of interaction (e-mail, instant messaging) are less social, and therefore less conducive to social influence. * Media richness theory (Daft & Lengel, 1986)Daft, R. L. and Lengel, R. H. (1986). Organizational information requirements, media richness and structural design. Management Science, 32(5):554-571 shares some characteristics with social presence theory. It posits that the amount of information communicated differs with respect to a medium's richness. The theory assumes that resolving ambiguity and reducing uncertainty are the main goals of communication. Because communication media differ in the rate of understanding they can achieve in a specific time (with \\"rich\\" media carrying more information), they are not all capable of resolving uncertainty and ambiguity well. The more restricted the medium's capacity, the less uncertainty and equivocality it is able to manage. It follows that the richness of the media should be matched to the task so as to prevent over simplification or complication. * Media naturalness theory (Kock, 2001; 2004)Kock, N. (2001). The ape that used email: Understanding e-communication behavior through evolution theory. Communications of the Association for Information Systems, 5(3), 1-29.Kock, N. (2004). The psychobiological model: Towards a new theory of computer-mediated communication based on Darwinian evolution. Organization Science, 15(3), 327-348. builds on human evolution ideas and has been proposed as an alternative to media richness theory. Media naturalness theory argues that since our Stone Age hominid ancestors have communicated primarily face-to- face, evolutionary pressures have led to the development of a brain that is consequently designed for that form of communication. Other forms of communication are too recent and unlikely to have posed evolutionary pressures that could have shaped our brain in their direction. Using communication media that suppress key elements found in face-to-face communication, as many electronic communication media do, thus ends up posing cognitive obstacles to communication. This is particularly the case in the context of complex tasks (e.g., business process redesign, new product development, online learning), because such tasks seem to require more intense communication over extended periods of time than simple tasks. * Media synchronicity theory (MST, Dennis & Valacich, 1999) redirects richness theory towards the synchronicity of the communication. * The social identity model of deindividuation effects (SIDE) (Postmes, Spears and Lea 1999;Postmes, T., Spears, R., and Lea, M. (1999). Social identity, group norms, and deindividuation: Lessons from computer- mediated communication for social influence in the group. In N. Ellemers, R. Spears, B. D., editor, Social Identity: Context, Commitment, Content. Blackwell., Oxford. Reicher, Spears and Postmes, 1995;Reicher, S., Spears, R., & Postmes, T. (1995). A social identity model of deindividuation phenomena. In W. Stroebe & M. Hewstone (Eds.), European Review of Social Psychology (Vol. 6, pp. 161‚Äì198). Chichester: Wiley. Spears & Lea, 1994 Spears, R., & Lea, M. (1994). Panacea or panopticon? The hidden power in computer-mediated communication. Communication Research, 21, 427-459.) was developed as a response to the idea that anonymity and reduced presence made communication technology socially impoverished (or \\"deindividuated\\"). It provided an alternative explanation for these \\"deindividuation effects\\" based on theories of social identity (e.g., Turner et al., 1987Turner, J. C., Hogg, M. A., Oakes, P. J., Reicher, S., & Wetherell, M. S. (1987). Rediscovering the social group: A self-categorization theory. Oxford, England: Basil Blackwell.). The SIDE model distinguishes cognitive and strategic effects of a communication technology. Cognitive effects occur when communication technologies make \\"salient\\" particular aspects of personal or social identity. For example, certain technologies such as email may disguise characteristics of the sender that individually differentiate them (i.e., that convey aspects of their personal identity) and as a result more attention may be given to their social identity. The strategic effects are due to the possibilities, afforded by communication technology, to selectively communicate or enact particular aspects of identity, and disguise others. SIDE therefore sees the social and the technological as mutually determining, and the behavior associated with particular communication forms as the product or interaction of the two. * Time, interaction, and performance (TIP; McGrath, 1991)McGrath, J.E. (1991). Time, interaction, and performance (tip): A theory of groups. small group research. 22(2):147-174. theory describes work groups as time-based, multi- modal, and multi-functional social systems. Groups interact in one of the modes of inception, problem solving, conflict resolution, and execution. The three functions of a group are production (towards a goal), support (affective) and well-being (norms and roles). = Other Stances = Additionally, many authors have posed technology so as to critique and or emphasize aspects of technology as addressed by the mainline theories. For example, Steve Woolgar (1991)Woolgar, S. (1991). The turn to technology in social studies of science. Science, Technology, & Human Values, 16(1):20-50. considers technology as text in order to critique the sociology of scientific knowledge as applied to technology and to distinguish between three responses to that notion: the instrumental response (interpretive flexibility), the interpretivist response (environmental/organizational influences), the reflexive response (a double hermeneutic). Pfaffenberger (1992)Pfaffenberger, B. (1992). Technological dramas. Science, Technology, & Human Values, 17(3):282-312. treats technology as drama to argue that a recursive structuring of technological artifacts and their social structure discursively regulate the technological construction of political power. A technological drama is a discourse of technological \\"statements\\" and \\"counterstatements\\" within the processes of technological regularization, adjustment, and reconstitution. An important philosophical approach to technology has been taken by Bernard Stiegler,Stiegler, B. (1998). Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus. Stanford: Stanford University Press. whose work has been influenced by other philosophers and historians of technology including Gilbert Simondon and Andr√© Leroi-Gourhan. In the Schumpeterian and Neo- Schumpeterian theories technologies are critical factors of economic growth (Carlota Perez).Perez, Carlota (2009).Technological revolutions and techno- economic paradigms. Working Papers in Technology Governance and Economic Dynamics, Working Paper No. 20. (Norway and Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn)  Analytic theories  Finally, there are theories of technology which are not defined or claimed by a proponent, but are used by authors in describing existing literature, in contrast to their own or as a review of the field. For example, Markus and Robey (1988)Markus, M. and Robey, D. (1988). Information technology and organizational change: causal structure in theory and research. Management Science, 34:583-598. propose a general technology theory consisting of the causal structures of agency (technological, organizational, imperative, emergent), its structure (variance, process), and the level (micro, macro) of analysis. Orlikowski (1992)Orlikowski, W.J. (1992). The duality of technology: rethinking the concept of technology in organizations. Organization Science, 3(3):398-427. notes that previous conceptualizations of technology typically differ over scope (is technology more than hardware?) and role (is it an external objective force, the interpreted human action, or an impact moderated by humans?) and identifies three models: # Technological imperative: focuses on organizational characteristics which can be measured and permits some level of contingency # Strategic choice: focuses on how technology is influenced by the context and strategies of decision-makers and users # Technology as a trigger of structural change: views technology as a social object DeSanctis and Poole (1994) similarly write of three views of technology's effects: # Decision- making: the view of engineers associated with positivist, rational, systems rationalization, and deterministic approaches # Institutional school: technology is an opportunity for change, focuses on social evolution, social construction of meaning, interaction and historical processes, interpretive flexibility, and an interplay between technology and power # An integrated perspective (social technology): soft-line determinism, with joint social and technological optimization, structural symbolic interaction theory Bimber (1998)Bimber, B. (1998). Three faces of technological determinism. In Smith, M. and Marx, L., editors, Does Technology Drive History? The Dilemma of Technological Determinism, pages 79‚Äì100. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA. addresses the determinacy of technology effects by distinguishing between the: # Normative: an autonomous approach where technology is an important influence on history only where societies attached cultural and political meaning to it (e.g., the industrialization of society) # Nomological: a naturalistic approach wherein an inevitable technological order arises based on laws of nature (e.g., steam mill had to follow the hand mill). # Unintended consequences: a fuzzy approach that is demonstrative that technology is contingent (e.g., a car is faster than a horse, but unbeknownst to its original creators become a significant source of pollution)  References  = Citations = = Sources = Denis, A. and Valacich, J.

Biography He studied science and mathematics at Strasbourg University, then mining at RWTH Aachen University. He served in World War I as an officer in the German Army. He lost his right leg below the knee during the war. He joined the Nazi Party in 1923 and became an Ortsgruppe (District) leader in the town of Erbendorf in Bavaria. He participated in the abortive Beer Hall Putsch of 9 November 1923. He was elected to the Bavarian Landtag and formed a Nazi Party faction in early 1925. On 1 October 1928 he became Gauleiter of the Upper Palatinate (Oberpfalz). On 1 November 1929 he was switched to Gauleiter of Greater Munich, the seat of the Nazi movement. Finally, on 16 November 1930 his Gau absorbed the neighboring Gau of Upper Bavaria (Oberbayern) and he became Gauleiter of Gau M√ºnchen-Oberbayern. He was elected a deputy to the Reichstag in November 1933.Karl H√∂ffkes: Hitlers Politische Generale. Die Gauleiter des Dritten Reiches: ein biographisches Nachschlagewerk.

Die Gauleiter Hans Schemm, Adolf Wagner, Paul Giesler und das Bayerische Staatsministerium f√ºr Unterricht und Kultus 1933-1945, 1997. Shortly after the Nazi seizure of power in Germany, Wagner was appointed acting Minister of the Interior in Bavaria on 9 March 1933. In this post, he controlled all the security apparatus of the state. On 12 April he was made permanent in this position and also became Deputy Minister President of Bavaria. He thus wielded enormous power in both the party and the government, despite nominally reporting to Reichsstatthalter Franz Ritter von Epp. On 28 November 1936, he was also made Bavarian Minister for Education and Culture. A member of the SA, he was promoted to the rank of SA-Obergruppenf√ºhrer on 9 November 1937. As Gauleiter of Munich, Wagner served as the master of ceremonies for the annual commemorations of the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch every 9 November. At the outbreak of war on 1 September 1939, Wagner was named Reich Defense Commissioner for Wehrkreis (Military Districts) VII and XIII, encompassing all of Bavaria. He was the only Gauleiter named to head two districts. As Bavarian Education Minister, in April 1941 he ordered that school prayer should be replaced by Nazi songs and that crucifixes and religious pictures be removed from Bavarian classrooms, which outraged the Roman Catholic Church and the general public. The opposition to this move was so strong that Wagner was forced to rescind the order, one of the rare circumstances of successful public opposition in Nazi Germany. Despite this setback, Hitler apparently remained on good terms with Wagner, one of the Alter K√§mpfer. Wagner suffered a stroke in June 1942 that effectively incapacitated him, and resulted in Paul Giesler taking over as Acting Gauleiter in Munich. Wagner nominally remained in his posts until his death on 12 April 1944, at which time Giesler was named his permanent successor. The increasingly reclusive F√ºhrer made a rare public appearance to attend his lavish funeral, and posthumously awarded him the German Order, the Nazi Party's highest decoration. Rare 8 mm colour film of Wagner appears in home movies (c. 1938) filmed by Hitler's companion, Eva Braun. He can be seen talking with Hitler on the terrace of Hitler's Bavarian residence the Berghof, near Berchtesgaden. Sources Winfried M√ºller: Gauleiter als Minister.

It consists of a board of polystyrene foam clad with an outer facing of paper on either side, typically white clay-coated paper or brown kraft paper. History The original white foamcore board was made in thicknesses for the graphic arts industry by Monsanto Company under the trade name \\"Fome-Cor¬Æ\\" starting in 1957. Construction, variants and composition The surface of the regular board, like many other types of paper, is slightly acidic. However, for modern archival picture framing and art mounting purposes it can be produced in a neutral, acid-free version with a buffered surface paper, in a wide range of sizes and thicknesses. Foam-cored materials are also now available with a cladding of solid (non-foamed) polystyrene and other rigid plastic sheeting, some with a textured finish. Foamcore does not adhere well to some glues, such as superglue, and certain types of paint. The foam tends to melt away and dissolve. Some glue works well in casual settings, however, the water in the glue can warp the fibers in the outer layers. Best results are typically obtained from higher-end spray adhesives. A hot glue gun can be used as a substitute, although the high viscosity of hot glues can affect finished projects in the form of board warping, bubbles, or other unsightly blemishes. Self-adhesive foam boards, intended for art and document mounting are also available, though these can be very tricky to use properly; this is because the glue sets very fast. It is considered cheaper to buy plain foam board and use re-positionable spray mount adhesive. Uses An architectural model made from foamcore on a styrofoam base Foamcore is commonly used to produce architectural models, prototype small objects and to produce patterns for casting. Scenery for scale model displays, dioramas, and computer games are often produced by hobbyists from foamcore. Photos on a foamcore backing Foamcore is also often used by photographers as a reflector to bounce light, in the design industry to mount presentations of new products, and in picture framing as a backing material; the latter use includes some archival picture framing methods, which utilize the acid-free versions of the material. Another use is with aero-modellers for building radio-controlled aircraft.

Robert DiYanni, Arts and Culture: an introduction to the humanities, 1999: \\"Ancient Egypt in the European imagination\\", pp 54ff.

After Late Antiquity, the Old Testament image of Egypt as the land of enslavement for the Hebrews predominated, and \\"Pharaoh\\" became a synonym for despotism and oppression in the 19th century. However, Enlightenment thinking and colonialist explorations in the late 18th century renewed interest in ancient Egypt as both a model for, and an exotic alternative to, Western culture, particularly as a Romantic source for classicizing architecture.

He lists the many animals to which Egypt is home, including the mythical phoenix and winged serpent, and gives inaccurate descriptions of the hippopotamus and horned viper. Herodotus was quite critical about the stories he heard from the priests (II,123), but Diodorus Siculus, who visited Hellenistic Egypt in the 1st century BCE, gave credit to what he was told by priests: that many famous Greek philosophers had studied in Egypt. Both Plutarch and Diogenes La√´rtius (3rd century) mention that Thales studied in Egypt, while nothing is really known about Thales from his own time. Iamblichus of Chalcis in the 3rd century CE reports that Pythagoras studied in Egypt for 22 years. From the classical texts that thus evolved, a mythical Egypt emerges as the mother-country of Religion, Wisdom, Philosophy, and Science. Among the Romans, an Egypt that had been drawn into the Roman economic and political sphere was still a source of wonders: Ex Africa semper aliquid novi;An overview is M. J. Versluys, Aegyptiaca Romana: nilotic scenes and the Roman views of Egypt, 2002. the exotic fauna of the Nile is embodied in the famous \\"Nilotic\\" mosaic from Praeneste, and Romanized iconographies were developed for the \\"Alexandrian Triad\\", Isis, who developed a widespread Roman following, Harpocrates, \\"god of silence\\", and the Ptolemaic syncretism of Serapis.Isis: Laurent Bricault, M.

The Septuagint, through which most Christians knew the Hebrew Bible, was commissioned in Alexandria, it was remembered, with the embellishment that though the seventy scholars set to work upon the texts independently, miraculously each arrived at the same translation. Joseph in Egypt: costume and setting translate the story to contemporary late-15th-century Ghent Middle Ages and Renaissance Following the 7th-century Muslim conquest of Egypt, the West lost direct contact with Egypt and its culture. In Medieval Europe, Egypt was depicted primarily in the illustration and interpretation of the biblical accounts. These illustrations were often quite fanciful, as the iconography and style of ancient Egyptian art, architecture and costume were largely unknown in the West (illustration, right). Dramatic settings of the Finding of Moses, the Plagues of Egypt, the Parting of the Red Sea and the story of Joseph in Egypt, and from the New Testament the Flight into Egypt often figured in medieval illuminated manuscripts. Biblical hermeneutics were primarily theological in nature, and had little to do with historical investigations. Throughout the Middle Ages \\"Mummia\\", made, if it were genuine, by pounding mummified bodies, was a standard product of apothecary shops. During the Renaissance the German Jesuit scholar Athanasius Kircher gave an allegorical \\"decipherment\\" of hieroglyphs through which Egypt was thought of as a source of ancient mystic or occult wisdom. In alchemist circles, the prestige of \\"Egyptians\\" rose. A few scholars, however, remained skeptic:Johann Kestler enumerated the contemporary critics of Kircher: \\"Some critics, Kestler wrote with amazement, believed that Kircher's explanation of the hieroglyphs was simply 'a figment of his own mind'\\" (Paula Findlen, Athanasius Kircher: the last man who knew everything, 2004:38) in the 16th century, Isaac Casaubon determined that the Corpus Hermeticum of the great Hermes Trismegistus was actually a Greek work of about the 4th century CE (even though Casaubon's work was also criticized by Ralph Cudworth).  18th century  Foire du Caire, Paris (1798), with Hathor heads and Egyptianizing frieze Early in the 18th century, Jean Terrasson had written Life of Sethos, a work of fiction, which launched the notion of Egyptian mysteries. In an atmosphere of antiquarian interest, a sense arose that ancient knowledge was somehow embodied in Egyptian monuments and lore. Following the Rosicrucian example, an Egyptian imagery pervaded the European Freemasonry of the time and its imagery, such as the eye on the pyramid ‚Äî still depicted on the Great Seal of the United States (1782), which appears on the United States one-dollar bill ‚Äî and the Egyptian references in Mozart's Masonic-themed Die Zauberfl√∂te (The Magic Flute, 1791), and his earlier unfinished \\"Thamos\\". The revival of curiosity about the Antique world, seen through written documents, spurred the publication of a collection of Greek texts that had been assembled in Late Antiquity, which were published as the corpus of works of Hermes Trismegistus. But the broken ruins that sometimes appeared in paintings of the episode of the Rest on the Flight into Egypt were always of Roman character. With historicism came the first fictions set in the Egypt of the imagination. Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra had been set partly in Alexandria, but its protagonists were noble and universal, and Shakespeare had not been concerned to evoke local color.  19th century  Rowlandson's 1806 satire on craze for ancient Egypt after Napoleon's invasion The rationale for \\"Egyptomania\\" rests on a similar concept: Westerners looked to ancient Egyptian motifs because ancient Egypt itself was intrinsically so alluring. The Egyptians used to consider their religion and their government somewhat eternal; they were supported in this thought by the enduring aspect of great public monuments which lasted forever and which appeared to resist the effects of time. Their legislators had judged that this moral impression would contribute to the stability of their empire.Reprinted in Jacques-Joseph Champollion-Figeac, Fourier et Napoleon: l'Egypte et les cent jours: memoires et documents inedits, Paris, Firmin Didot Freres, 1844, p. 170. The culture of Romanticism embraced every exotic locale, and its rise in the popular imagination coincided with Napoleon's failed Egyptian campaign and the start of modern Egyptology, beginning very much as a competitive enterprise between Britain and France. A modern \\"Battle of the Nile\\" could hardly fail to stir renewed curiosity about Egypt beyond the figure of Cleopatra. At about the same moment, the tarot was brought to Europe's attention by the Frenchman Antoine Court de Gebelin as a purported key to the occult knowledge of Egypt. All this gave rise to \\"Egyptomania\\" and occult tarot. This legendary Egypt has been difficult, but not impossible to concile with the 1824 decryption of hieroglyphs by Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion. Inscriptions that a century earlier had been thought to hold occult wisdom, proved to be nothing more than royal names and titles, funerary formulae, boastful accounts of military campaigns, even though there remains an obscure part that might agree with the mystic vision. The explosion of new knowledge about actual Egyptian religion, wisdom and philosophy has been widely interpreted as exposing the mythical image of Egypt as an illusion that had been created by the Greek and Western imaginations. In art the development of Orientalism, and the increased possibility of travel produced a large number of depictions, of varying degrees of accuracy. By the late 19th-century exotic and carefully studied or researched decor was often dominant in depictions of both landscape and human figures, whether ancient or modern.Thompson, Jason, Wonderful Things: A History of Egyptology 1: From Antiquity to 1881, 255, 2015, The American University in Cairo Press, , 9789774165993, google books; Tromans, Nicholas, and others, The Lure of the East, British Orientalist Painting, 2008, Tate Publishing, On the most popular 19th-century level, all of ancient Egypt was reduced in the European imagination to the Nile, the Pyramids and the Great Sphinx in a setting of sand, characterized on a more literary level in the English poet Shelley's \\"Ozymandias\\" (1818): John Martin's Seventh Plague of Egypt (1828) set the Biblical plague in Hellenistic Alexandria. Entrance to Egyptian Avenue, Highgate Cemetery Egyptian Revival architecture extended the repertory of classical design explored by the Neoclassical movement and widened the decorative vocabulary that could be drawn upon. The well-known Egyptian cult of the dead inspired the Egyptian Revival themes first employed in Highgate Cemetery, near London, which was opened in 1839 by a company founded by the designer-entrepreneur Stephen Geary (1797‚Äì1854); its architectural features, which included a 'Gothic Catacomb' as well as an 'Egyptian Avenue', were brought to public attention once more by James Stevens Curl.James Stevens Curl, The Victorian Celebration of Death, 1972, pp. 86-102. Ancient Egypt provided the setting for the Italian composer Verdi's stately 1871 opera Aida, commissioned by the Europeanized Khedive for premiere in Cairo. In 1895, the Polish writer Boles≈Çaw Prus completed his only historical novel, Pharaoh, a study of mechanisms of political power, described against the backdrop of the fall of the Twentieth Dynasty and the New Kingdom. It is, at the same time, one of the most compelling literary reconstructions of life at every level of ancient Egyptian society. In 1966, the novel was adapted as a Polish feature film.Christopher Kasparek, \\"Prus' Pharaoh: the Creation of a Historical Novel\\", The Polish Review, 1994, no. 1, pp. 45-50.  20th century  Nefertiti. Bust in Egyptian Museum, Berlin. In 1912, the discovery of an exquisite painted limestone bust of Nefertiti, unearthed from its sculptor's workshop near the royal city of Amarna, added the first new celebrity of Egypt. The bust, now in Berlin's Egyptian Museum, became so famous through the medium of photography that it became the most familiar, most copied work of ancient Egyptian sculpture; Nefertiti's strong-featured profile was a notable influence on new ideals of feminine beauty in the 20th century. Tutankhamun's mask. Egyptian Museum, Cairo. The 1922 discovery of the undamaged tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun introduced a new celebrity to join Nefertiti ‚Äî \\"King Tut\\". The tomb's spectacular treasures influenced Art-Deco design vocabulary. Also, for many years there persisted rumors, probably tabloid-inspired, of a \\"curse\\"; the rumors focused on the alleged premature deaths of some of those who had first entered the tomb. A recent study of journals and death records, however, indicates no statistical difference between the ages at death of those who had entered the tomb and of expedition members who had not; indeed, most of the individuals lived past age 70. The idea of a \\"mummy's curse\\" inspired films such as The Mummy, starring Boris Karloff, which popularized the idea of ancient Egyptian mummies reanimating as monsters. Another literary occurrence at that time of Egypt is Agatha Christie's 1936 mystery novel Death on the Nile. Hollywood's depiction of ancient Egypt is a major contributor to the fantasy Egypt of modern culture. The cinematic spectacle of Egypt climaxed in sequences of Cecil B. deMille's The Ten Commandments (1956) and in Jeanne Crain's Nefertiti in the 1961 Italian Cinecitt√† production of Queen of the Nile, and collapsed with the failure of Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor in Cleopatra (1963). In 1978, Tutankhamun was commemorated in the whimsical song, \\"King Tut\\", by American comedian Steve Martin, and in 1986 the poses in some Egyptian mural art were evoked in the song \\"Walk Like an Egyptian\\" by The Bangles. The Metropolitan Museum of Art resurrected the Temple of Dendur within its own quarters in 1978. In 1989, the Louvre raised its own glass pyramid, and in 1993 Las Vegas's Luxor Hotel opened with its replica tomb of Tutankhamun. A best- selling series of novels by French author and Egyptologist Christian Jacq was inspired by the life of Pharaoh Ramses II (\\"the Great\\").  21st century  HBO's miniseries Rome features several episodes set in Greco-Roman Egypt. The faithful reconstructions of an ancient Egyptian court (as opposed to the historically correct Hellenistic culture) were built in Rome's Cinecitt√† studios. The series depicts dramatized accounts of the relations among Cleopatra, Ptolemy XIII, Julius Caesar and Mark Antony. Cleopatra is played by Lyndsey Marshal, and much of the second season is dedicated to events building up to the famous suicides of Cleopatra and her lover Mark Antony in 30 BCE. La Reine Soleil, a 2007 animated film by Philippe Leclerc, features Akhenaten, Tutankhaten (later Tutankhamun), Akhesa (Ankhesenepaten, later Ankhesenamun), Nefertiti, and Horemheb in a complex struggle pitting the priests of Amun against Akhenaten's intolerant monotheism. American singer Katy Perry released in 2013 the song Dark Horse and the plot of the music video for the song was set it ancient Memphis. The video features numerous ancient Egyptian symbols and many of the things featured in it are historically accurate even though no egyptologists were consulted during its production. The turquoise makeup worn by Katy Perry in the video would have been used in Ancient Egypt, the dress she wore is similar in style to the Graeco-Roman clothes worn by nobles such as Cleopatra, the video features the Eye of Horus a powerful symbol in Ancient Egypt and the paintings behind the throne that Katy Perry sits on appear to have been made based on real examples from Ancient Egyptian tombs. Assassin's Creed launched in 2017 Assassin's Creed Origins and the plot of the game is set in Egypt during the Ptolemaic dynasty. The game follows Bayek, a medjay from the Siwa Oasis who is trying to revenge the death of his son. The depiction of Ancient Egypt in the game is really historically accurate and it offers a unique glimpse into the life of Egyptian people in 1st century AD. The buildings, landscapes, animals, even the language people are talking in were molded based on historical sources as many historians and egyptologists were consulted during the making of the game.

Early life  Habib Wali Mohammad was born in 1921 at Rangoon to a conservative Memon family, which later moved to Mumbai. His family, Tabani, an industrial house has large business holdings in Pakistan. During his childhood Habib Wali Mohammad often listened to Qawwali music. But due to economic and business reasons, he gave priority to academics. He received his MBA from Syracuse University, New York in 1947, and then lived in Mumbai for about 10 years before moving to Pakistan. His brother Ashraf W. Tabani was the governor of the province of Sindh, Pakistan around 1988. He died on 3 September 2014 in Los Angeles, USA.http://www.dawn.com/news/1129834, 'Habib Wali Mohammad passes away' on Dawn newspaper, Published 5 September 2014. Retrieved 27 June 2016 The Tabanis belong to the Gujarati-speaking Memon community.Pakistan ‚Äôs Memon Benefactors Career As a youth, Habib Wali received classical music lessons from Ustad Latafat Hussain, nephew of Ustad Fayyaz Khan. In college, he became active in the musical functions of Ismail Yusuf College, gaining the nickname 'Taan Sen'. He completed his bachelor's degree in Bombay. In 1941, Habib Wali was awarded first prize in a Bombay music competition with 1200 contestants, including the singer Mukesh Chand Mathur. His winning performance was singing the ghazal of the last Moghul Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar, Lagta Nahin Hai Jee Mera Ujray Diyar Mein. Encouraged by this honour, at a young age, he took more interest in ghazal singing. During his stay in America, he had been out of touch with music. Hence, he felt lonely and missed his earlier college functions in Bombay. In his own words, \\"He was not happy in ‚ÄòUjray dayar mein‚Äô, the same ghazal which had won him an award of a lifetime. He put a lot of effort and came out with a gramophone record of ghazals in his voice. On one side of the record, he dubbed Bahadur Shah Zafar's ghazals and on the other side, Ghalib's ghazals. Unfortunately, the Indian public was reluctant to buy them. Listening to these ghazals, actress Meena Kumari became a fan of his, and since she was at the time affiliated with Radio Ceylon, she had his recordings broadcast often. This boosted Habib Wali's sales and caused him to become a celebrity. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, his family migrated to Pakistan and established an industrial group which includes the Shalimar Silk Mills. He gave most of his time to the family business, recording ghazals and geets for films in his spare time, however music was not pursued as a profession. However he still sang ghazals for the music companies.(including a geet written by Parveen Shakir: ‚ÄòGori karath singhar‚Äô). In the eighties, he recorded ghazals on audio cassettes which were composed by the renowned music director Nisar Bazmi and the Pakistan Television, Karachi Center's music director Niaz Ahmed. In addition, he received offers to become a film playback singer for the Pakistani film industry. Habib Wali Mohammad was from an early group of singers ever to record the ghazals. But probably because of his background and as a member of a well-established family, Habib Wali had never pursued an aggressive and mainstream career as a singer, though he was still highly regarded. His famous ghazals include Bahadur Shah Zafar's 'Na kisi ki aankh ka noor hoon' and Qamar Jalalvi's 'Kab mera nasheman ahelay chaman'. All of his performances of the ghazals of Bahadur Shah Zafar have been very popular. His other well known ghazals, include Aaj Jaane Ki Zid Na Karo. He also sang the famous national song, \\"Roshan-o-Rakhshan, Nayyar-o- Tabaan, Pakistan rahay\\".  Personal life  Habib Wali Mohammad lived in Los Angeles California, United States with his wife, Rehana and his family, including his sons, Rizwan Wali Mohammad Tabani and Nadeem Wali Mohammad Tabani. Both are ghazal and geet performers in their own right.

On the lakeshore to the north of the building is the Terrace, a popular outdoor space overlooking Lake Mendota. It has gained a reputation as one of the most beautiful student centers on a university campus.  History  The exterior of the main wing was designed by University Architect Arthur Peabody. Opened October 5, 1928, the facility is operated by the Wisconsin Union, a membership organization. Porter Butts, the first director, called it a \\"college union\\" because it combines the characteristics of a student union (\\"student activity center\\" in other countries) and a student government (\\"students' union\\" in other countries) in an organization that brings together students, faculty, and members of the surrounding community. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 19, 2015.  Facility  Outside the main building is the Memorial Union Terrace, a stone outdoor dining and recreation area on the shore of Lake Mendota. The Terrace was designed by Peabody's daughter, Charlotte. It is a popular spot among students and local residents for socializing because of the backdrop of the lake, with its view of sailboats, and the sound of live music, usually free to the public in the evening. The Wisconsin Union Directorate funds music on the Terrace four nights a week in the summer, and on the Terrace or in der Rathskeller on weekends during the school year (depending on weather).

Lozano was not the only American soldier involved in this incident, but received much more attention because he was the one who fired the machine gun killing Calipari. He was assigned to the 1st Battalion of the 69th Infantry Regiment, 42nd Infantry Division of the New York Army National Guard, based in Manhattan. In 2007, a superior Italian court decided that Italy had no jurisdiction in this case‚Äîthough renouved, this motivation has been since dubbed as foul by the High Jury Italian court in 2008. Early life and education Lozano is largely of Puerto Rican ancestry, although he has a paternal grandfather who was half Sicilian ancestry. He is a native of the Bronx borough of New York City, New York. Career =Involvement in the death of Nicola Calipari= Lozano shot and killed Secret Service agent Nicola Calipari in Baghdad during a disputed incident at BP 541, a blocking position (a loose term indicating a mobile roadblock that allows no traffic to pass) located behind a ninety- degree turn on the ramp joining Route Vernon to Route Irish. (The road was between the heavily fortified Green Zone and Baghdad International Airport.) Calipari was returning from a successful rescue mission to liberate Giuliana Sgrena, an Italian independent journalist, detained by Iraqi insurgents. Both Sgrena and a colleague of Calipari, Andrea Carpani, were wounded in the shooting. Lozano and members of his squad had been directed to set up the blocking position as part of security measures for Ambassador John Negroponte's convoy from the city to the airport. Although the ambassador's convoy had already passed twenty minutes earlier, a communications failure with the dispatching unit (which had just deployed to Iraq, and was on the job for the first time), meant that Lozano's squad had been in place for more than eighty minutes, sixty-five minutes over the customary length. An internal U.S. Army investigation cleared Lozano of any wrongdoing and concluded that he acted within the standing rules of engagement. It was pointed out during the Army investigation that Calipari, who had previously been in contact with the United States Embassy in Baghdad and had previously been sharing information and working with US Coalition forces in order to free Sgrena, did not share information about the rescue attempt with the embassy. In addition, two members of Lozano's unit were killed two days previously in a car bombing very near to where the incident occurred. While 58 bullets were missing from his M-240B machine gun, forensic evidence showed that the vehicle had been struck only a total of 11 times by the 7.62mm bullets, and that 2 had entered through the windshield. Lozano told investigators that he had fired the remaining bullets while test-firing his weapon and while attempting to walk the bullets up to the speeding car to warn it of the impending danger from the blocking position. A related reportItalian report on the incident, hosted on the website of Corriere della Sera and issued by Italian authorities, rather than accusing Lozano of being the sole culprit, pointed to the inappropriate placement of the blocking position (at the end of a one-way ramp between two highways) and lack of proper warning signals and/or concertina wire. The Italian report stated that because of the short span of visible road from the BP, Lozano, being in charge of both the searchlight used to warn incoming vehicles and of the machine gun, had only seconds to react, point the searchlight, warn the vehicle, assess it was not halting, man the weapon, aim, shoot warning shots, and then disabling shots. Video On May 8, 2007, the Italian television channel Canale 5 broadcast a video of the first moments after the shooting. In this video, Calipari's car is seen stopped on the road after the shooting, with the door open, the lights switched on, and apparently more than 50 meters away from the US Army Armored Humvee. This video contradicts claims by the US that the car was traveling with its lights switched off and was fired upon by Lozano when it was less than 50 meters from his position. Political implications Calipari's death caused a major international incident, since Calipari, a highly decorated SISMI agent, had become a national hero in Italy. As a result, there was significant pressure on the Italian government to publicly support another investigation into the shooting, this time being conducted by Italian prosecutors. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi indicated in Parliament on May 5, 2005 that the government remained fully committed to supporting the ongoing judicial investigation into Calipari's death. One of the most prominent leaders of the opposition in the lower house of parliament, Piero Fassino, called for the United States to facilitate cooperation with the investigation, indicating that they believed the U.S. Army should produce Lozano for questioning by the prosecuting magistrates. Alfonso Pecoraro Scanio, head of the Italian Federation of the Greens, indicated that should the United States fail to cooperate with this investigation by allowing Lozano to be questioned, he would push for a hearing at the International Court of Justice. The non- Italian media had been reporting that it was unlikely that Italy would seek to try Lozano in absentia were the U.S. to not render him to Italian custody. Despite the Italian government's desire to maintain a firm alliance with the United States an Italian judge has decided to try Lozano in absentia. Judicial investigation Italian prosecutors actively sought to interview Lozano as part of their criminal investigation into Calipari's death. On December 22, 2005, the special prosecutors of the Magistrate's service of Rome announced that they were considering charging Lozano with voluntary manslaughter. On January 18, 2006, it was reported that the prosecutors had decided to charge Lozano with murder. The prosecutors indicated that despite making over twenty formal requests to the U.S., the U.S. refused to formally identify Lozano. After confirming Lozano's identity, the Magistrate service appointed an attorney to represent Lozano during the charging process. In June 2006, the Italian government announced that prosecutors have formally charged Lozano with murder, and were considering an extradition request. The Italian government then carried through with its request, and the U.S. government, as expected, denied the extradition request. At that point, the Italian authorities considered putting Lozano on trial in absentia. Putting foreigners on trial in absentia is a relatively uncommon practice in Italy, but exceptions are made for cases of \\"political murder\\". Prosecutors in Italy announced that the case against Lozano qualifies as a \\"political murder\\" case, and was thus eligible for trial in absentia. In the meantime, newspapers in the United States have quoted soldiers in Lozano's unit who said that he had been \\"devastated\\" when he learned that he had killed an Italian officer and wounded a female civilian, and that he was unable to sleep for days afterward. On April 10, 2007, Lozano gave an interview to CBS Television in which he appeared deeply concerned about the legal proceeding in Italy, and very sorry about the \\"pain he'd provoked to the family of Nicola Calipari\\". He also reconfirmed the version he and his superiors already gave of the incident in Iraq, providing a sole new insight: contrasting the opinion of Mrs. Sgrena's life partner Pier Scolari that he'd shot \\"300- or 400- rounds into and around the car\\", he stated that it would have been impossible for him to do so as he'd have had to reload the machine gun at least once or twice to fire that many rounds. Lozano's trial in absentia began on April 17, 2007. On October 25, 2007, an Italian court dismissed the charges against Lozano after determining that multinational forces in Iraq were under the exclusive jurisdiction of the country that sent them.

It was established in 1896 by the Society of Jesus as part of Loyola College, at the request of the English Catholic community in Montreal. It is named after St.Ignatius of Loyola, who founded the Jesuit Order in 1534. History Founded in 1896, Loyola High School began as Loyola College (an eight-year classical college or \\"coll√®ge classique\\") which assumed responsibility for the English section of Coll√®ge Sainte-Marie de Montr√©al, a French Jesuit school which existed from 1848 to 1969. In 1916, Loyola College moved from its downtown location to the west end location on Sherbrooke St. West. In 1964, the Loyola High School Corporation was established to run the school separately from the College. When Loyola College merged with Sir George Williams University in 1974 to form Concordia University, the title to the land that the school occupied on the north-east corner of the campus was transferred from the College. To this day, Loyola has remained true to its Jesuit apostolate, educating \\"Men for Others\\" who are intellectually competent, open to growth, religious, loving, and committed to doing justice. School campus Junior Building's east facing facade Loyola was originally located in an abandoned Sacred Heart Convent on Bleury and St. Catherine Street. A fire broke out at this location in 1898, provoking the college to move into the former Tucker School on Drummond Street. That summer, a wing was added, but space soon became inadequate. In 1900, the Jesuits purchased the Decary Farm in Notre-Dame-de-Gr√¢ce located in the west end of Montreal, where the school remains to this day on what is commonly referred to as the Loyola Campus of Concordia University. Junior Building's north facing facade In 1916, Loyola College officially moved to the new campus. The high school was located in the Junior Building and, until 1961, shared the Administration Building and then the north half of the Central Building. It was the Junior Building, which was designed in the Collegiate Gothic architectural style and covered in gargoyles, leaded and stained-glass windows and oak moulding, where young men began their journey to become \\"Eight-Year Men\\". After four years of high school and four years of college, they graduated with university degrees in Arts or Sciences. In 1961, the era of boarders ended and the high school moved exclusively to the Junior Building. An extension was added in 1968 and a gymnasium was built south of Sherbrooke Street in 1978. In 1988 a decision was reached to erect a new building in order to properly accommodate the student body and to enable the school to offer the curriculum outlined by the Ministry of Education. New building's north facing facade Loyola considered a number of possible options for the future building, including adding an extension onto the Junior Building, and relocating the school to C√¥te Saint-Luc on land owned by Loyola (currently the location of C√¥te Saint-Luc City Hall). The school eventually made arrangements with Concordia University to swap the Junior Building for a site on the south- west end of Loyola campus beside the school gymnasium. The new building was completed in 1992. The Bishops Atrium and a three-story wing was constructed in 2004, along with an auditorium the following year. Academic In the school‚Äôs Mission Statement, Loyola is described as a ‚Äúuniversity-preparatory school.‚Äù Students are also expected to complete the requirements for a Secondary School Diploma to be admitted to C.E.G.E.P. Core and optional subjects offered in the high school curriculum are broken down according to cycle - Cycle 1 (years 1 and 2) and Cycle 2 (years 3, 4, and 5). The high school performs competitively locally and provincially in examinations results. Religious and spiritual formation As a Catholic and Jesuit school, all of Loyola's activities are meant to be inspired by Catholic teachings in the tradition of St. Ignatius of Loyola. In 2015 Loyola's Board of Governors put forward a five-year strategic plan which identified five \\"foundational pillars\\" in order to pursue the school's mission. The plan proposed, among other things, to \\"infuse all programmes with a truly Catholic and Ignatian pedagogy\\" and to \\"foster the maintenance of an Ignatian environment that engages the broader Loyola community\\" While the school's president is ultimately responsible for ensuring the school's spiritual mission, the Loyola Ignatian Formation director oversees its particular activities in the entire Loyola community (alumni, parents, faculty, and students). The Campus Ministry is tasked with overseeing students' spiritual formation. = Campus ministry = Experience Week * Grad at Grad * Liturgy * Retreats * Youth Ministry The Christian Service Program (CSP) is both an academic course and considered part of spiritual formation. In the course of their high school years, students participate in some form of supervised program known as \\"CSP\\" involving service to others. CSP is a compulsory program for all students. CSP project opportunities are already approved by the school. Alternatively, the students may find their own project around their area, subject to approval by the school deacon. CSP is broken down into two categories. For grades 7 ‚Äì 10 students must complete a certain amount of community service hours twice a year (before Christmas break and after Christmas break. (Example: Grade 7: 2 hours before Christmas, 2 hours after Christmas; Grade 8: 4 hours before and after; Grade 9: 6 hours before and after; Grade 10: 8 hours before and after). For students in grade 11 the period of service is for 2 hours a week over the course of 12 weeks (total: 24 hours) before or after Christmas. =Jesuit affiliation= Loyola is a member of the American Jesuit Schools Network, and is administered by the Jesuits of English Canada. The two Jesuit provinces, English and French, are currently in the process of merging into one Canadian Jesuit province. Athletics Loyola fields a number of athletic teams in competition with other schools in Canada and the United States, primarily competing in the Greater Montreal Athletics Association and R√©seau du sport √©tudiant du Qu√©bec.

Originally named the \\"Invitational Winter Sports Tournament\\", the tournament was renamed after its co-founder Ed Meagher in 1996 (the year of his passing). Meagher was a former student, teacher, and sports coach at Loyola High School. The annual week-long tournament takes place each January and has grown considerably since its inception. Senior hockey (now Juvenile) was the original sport in 1971. In 1974, Senior basketball (now Juvenile) was added to the tournament, followed by Bantam hockey in 1981. Midget basketball was added in 1982, wrestling in 1995, Bantam basketball in 1998, and Pee-Wee hockey in 2003. In 2000, the Concordia University Arena (the arena used for all Loyola hockey home games and tournaments) was named the Ed Meagher Arena. Coat of arms The name \\"Loyola\\" is derived from the Spanish Lobo-y-olla, meaning \\"wolf\\" and \\"kettle\\". The school's coat of arms is a variation of St. Ignatius of Loyola's coat of arms, which depicts the union of the House of Loyola (represented by the two wolves and kettle) and the House of Onaz (represented by the seven red bars on a field of gold) in 1261. The phrase \\"Loyola y Onaz\\" typically appears at the bottom, though another variation of the school's coat of arms includes the Jesuit motto \\"Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam\\", meaning \\"for the greater glory of God\\".

Slattery, Loyola and Montreal (Montreal: Palm Publishers, 1962) Loyola in court In 2008, Quebec's Ministry of Education, Sport and Leisure introduced a mandatory \\"Ethics and Religious Culture\\" (ERC) course to all Quebec schools. Loyola had reservations about the course's ability to meet its objectives from a relativistic perspective, and applied for an exemption to teach an ERC equivalency course. Loyola's equivalency course had similar goals as the government's ERC but was structured on a methodology that was more in keeping with its Catholic, Jesuit identity. The government denied the request for exemption and, as a result, Loyola took the matter to the Superior Court of Quebec where in 2010 the Superior Court ruled in Loyola's favour. The Ministry appealed and in 2012 the appellate court overturned the Superior Court's decision. Loyola then took the case to the Supreme Court of Canada where, on 19 March 2015, it was ruled that the Quebec Ministry was in violation of Loyola's religious freedom and ordered the Ministry to reconsider the exemption.

Loyola High School of Los Angeles is the region's oldest continuing educational institution pre-dating both the Los Angeles public school and the University of California systems. The school began in the downtown plaza Lugo adobe in 1865 as Saint Vincent's College at the behest of Archdiocese of Los Angeles Bishop Thaddeus Amat. After relocating to Hill Street in 1869 and to Grand Avenue in 1889, the Vincentian fathers ceded control of the school to the Society of Jesus in 1911, and it relocated to Avenue 52 in Highland Park as the prep school Los Angeles College. In 1917 the school moved to its current location on Venice Boulevard after the copper magnate and Irish philanthropist Thomas P. Higgins helped secure land for the school. The college was renamed Loyola College the following year, in honor of St. Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Society of Jesus. Until 1929, the campus housed the college, the law school, and the high school. At that time, the Jesuits purchased additional property to house the college and separate facilities were acquired for Loyola Law School just west of downtown Los Angeles. The college, now Loyola Marymount University, was moved to the area now known as Westchester in West Los Angeles. Recent campus development of the school occurred in the 1980s: the gym, track, and swimming pool, along with additional classroom space, were built after the administration secured major donations. A $30 million renovation with donations from the William Hannon Foundation, the Ardolf Family, and others have provided for a new science building, counseling and student centers, additional classrooms, and central plaza, which were operational as of June 2007, when construction of a new Xavier Center was begun. Hannon Theatre on campus with its large stage serves the students along with actors from throughout Southern Califrornia.  Profile  = Admissions = The primary admissions entry point for Loyola High School is in 9th grade, with varying transfer opportunities offered in 10th and 11th grades. Transfer is not allowed going into the senior year, except for rare situations. Admission is based on standardized test scores; recommendations from the candidate's teachers, principal, and minister; involvement in extracurricular activities; a personal statement; and grades. Loyola draws its students from throughout the greater Los Angeles area, from Pacific Palisades to East L.A., from Pasadena to San Pedro, from the South Bay as well as the San Fernando, San Gabriel, Santa Clarita, and Hidden Valleys. Nearly 50% of the student body is composed of individuals of African-American, Latino, and Asian heritages, which serves to enhance the ethnic and socio- economic diversity of the school. Approximately 800 students apply for 310 slots in the freshman class each year. = Curriculum = Four years each of social studies and English studies courses are required, along with three years of foreign language study and of science, and one year of fine art. Eight semesters of theology are also a central part of the curriculum, covering Holy Scripture, systematic theology, Catholic social thought, moral theology, and one senior elective. Advanced Placement courses are offered in 25 subject areas with a historical \\"pass\\" rate of almost 80%,Loyola High School Advanced Placement , Loyola School News. Retrieved 2010-10-06. and students are encouraged to take a wide variety of electives outside of the required courses. Loyola also offers more than 19 Honors courses. Ninety-six percent of Loyola graduates attend a four-year college. In 2014 Loyola sent 23 students to USC which has an 18% acceptance rate: the Loyola contingent was the most from any school. In 2017, among 153 private high schools in the Los Angeles metro area, Niche ranked Loyola 13th in college readiness, and among 52 Catholic high schools 2nd overall with an A+ grade. Also, according to Niche, Loyola is the best all male school. = Service = Venice Boulevard. Since the 1970s Loyola students have performed over one million hours of service to the community. As part of its commitment to educating men for and with others, Loyola students participate in four major service-oriented projects during their high school careers. The freshman serve as tutors on the Loyola campus for the award-winning High School Placement Test Prep Projects for 8th (October - January) and 7th graders (February - April), as well as assist with the Special Olympics. The second and third service projects include minimum 25-hour service projects during each of the sophomore and junior years. The Senior Service Project is a minimum 85-hour immersion commitment to a non-profit service organization in January of senior year. Inner city grade schools, special education schools, hospitals, hospices, shelters, and soup kitchens are preferred sites for this service experience. Now in its 29th year, the Senior Service Project was featured in \\"Making A Difference\\" as part of the NBC National News hosted by Brian Williams on March 11, 2010. The film clip is accessible on the Loyola and NBC websites. Loyola students' community service has been regularly featured on the local news programs of the ABC affiliate, Channel 7, including Kool Kids and a fundraising car wash conducted on behalf of Homeboy Industries in Los Angeles, the gang member reformation program founded by Greg Boyle, a Loyola graduate and former faculty member. Loyola sponsors one of the leading Community Service fairs in metro Los Angeles during the third week of September each year with over 100 local agencies, centers, schools, and organizations sending representatives to enroll Loyola students as volunteers. This event supports all of the school's service and justice education programs and seeks to support better-informed choices for service by the students. Several times over the course of the year, the Cubs Urban Plunge in Los Angeles is offered to students and faculty as a way for them to better experience the community from the position of the poor, disenfranchised, and marginalized. This is one of Loyola's distinguishing programs. Still the only high school in Los Angeles, public or private, to offer such a program, through this three- to four-day program, students serve in a number of shelters and centers on Skid row, Hollywood, and East Los Angeles. This program continued through the summer of 2010 with four urban plunges being offered. An overview of the Cubs Urban Plunge program may be found in the July edition of the \\"Beverly Press.\\" Starting in June 2007, Loyola began an out-of-area, hands-on service program with a two-week service immersion in New Orleans. The 2008 program took Loyola students to Appalachia, focused in Wheeling and Charleston, West Virginia. In July 2008 Loyola launched its foreign service immersion in Puebla and Cholula, Mexico. In June 2009, Loyola launched a five-week, academic exchange and service immersion with Colegio Del Salvador, the Jesuit high school in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The 2009 summer service immersion program included student, faculty, and staff service teams in New Orleans/Slidell, Louisiana, in mid June and another student, staff, alumni, and parent service team to Lima and Cusco, Peru, in late July and early August. The 2010 service immersion program included one that is agriculturally based in the Salinas Valley in Northern California and an extended urban immersion in Los Angeles, both conducted in mid-June. In 2010 Loyola again conducted a six-week Argentina Intercambio program based in Buenos Aires, expanded to include nine days in metropolitan Montevideo, Uruguay. The Intercambio is conducted in conjunction with the Jesuit colegios in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and in Santa Fe, Montevideo, Uruguay. An overview of the summer service immersion program may be found in the July 31, 2010, edition of The Tidings, the weekly newspaper of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. Overall, each Loyola student completes a minimum of 150 hours of direct service by graduation with many of them matriculating with between 250 ‚Äì 300 hours. Non-credit service activities include the annual Community Service Fair conducted each September, the Community Service Leadership Team, the annual AIDS Walk Los Angeles, the Peace and Justice Coalition, the annual School of the America's Watch and Ignatian Teach-In conducted just before Thanksgiving, Catholic Lobby Day in Sacramento, California, an annual social justice speakers series, and ongoing collection of food, clothing, books, and toys for distribution to the needy served by some of the school's 1,000 placement partners. Service and justice are two significant factors considered in making the most of the \\"Big Seven\\" awards for graduating seniors each June. Outstanding service leadership is recognized at the annual student awards ceremony and the Annual Community Service Awards Banquet held each May. Loyola is an active member of the Ignatian Solidarity Network (ISN), an association of 70 US Jesuit high schools, colleges, and universities engaged in social advocacy and justice education for students and adults. National and regional topical workshops included Loyola's hosting 500 students and adults from the US and Mexico for the 2008 ISN conference on comprehensive immigration reform. In years past, Loyola delegations have participated in national conferences on racism and poverty in New Orleans (2007) and comprehensive immigration advocacy in Washington, DC (2009). The 2010 ISN program occurred in Washington, DC, and focused on immigration, the environment, health care, and education. Loyola parent, alumni, faculty, and staff involvement in various service projects with students is a distinguishing characteristic of the Loyola program. Parents and alumni are heavily involved in staffing the Saturday tutoring programs for 8th graders and 7th graders each Fall and Spring. In December 2008 and again in October 2009, the whole Loyola faculty, staff, and administration spent the better part of a retreat day serving in the same agencies and schools as their students. Loyola's service program has received numerous awards from the City of Los Angeles, the County of Los Angeles, the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, the California State Senate, and a number of various agency and civic groups for the million plus hours of student service contributed to the children, men, and women of Los Angeles. = Athletics = Loyola High School has a strong history of athletics success, including national championships in football and volleyball. Loyola has won at least one California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) title for ten years running, and in 2017 won the CIF Commissioner's Cup for the ninth year in a row. In the 2002-2003 academic year, Loyola set the California state record for most section championships (5) won in a single school year: cross-country, basketball, volleyball, track, and golf. The Cubs matched their still-standing state record in the 2015-2016 school year, winning section titles in Golf, Lacrosse, Swimming, Volleyball, and Soccer. * Baseball: CIF Champs - 1954, 2007 Mission League Champs - 1996, 2005, 2013, 2014 * Basketball: CIF AAAA/Div I-A Champs - 1953, 2002, 2003, 2011 * Cross Country: Mission League Champs - 1994 through 2018; CIF Champs - 1984, 1985, 2002, 2004, 2007; CIF State Champs - 2002, 2004, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2015; Nike Cross Nationals - 2007 (8th in U.S.), 2008 (15th in U.S.) * Football: CIF AAAA/Div I Champs - 1962, 1963, 1975, 1990, 2003, 2005; National Champs - 1975 (National Sports News Service) * Golf: CIF Northern Div Champs - 2000, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2016, 2017, 2019 * Lacrosse: CIF Certification - 2006; Mission League Champs - 2007, 2009; Division II champions - 2011, Division I champions - 2016, 2017, 2018 * Soccer: CIF Division I/Division II Champs - 1998, 2005, 2007, 2014, 2016 State Champs, Nationally ranked 24th, ranked 7th in the state * Swimming/Diving: CIF Champs - 1984, 1994, 1996, 1997, 2011 (State Champs, 4th in U.S.), 2016 * Tennis: CIF Champs Div 1-A - 1980, 2-A - 1982, 1984, 1986 * Track & Field: CIF Champs - 1984, 2000, 2003, 2004, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013; National Champs - 2011 (Nike Track Nationals) * Volleyball: CIF Div I Champs - 1983, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1995, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2009, 2010, 2016; National Champs - 2009 (ESPN RISE) CIF Div 1 STATE Champs - 2009, 2010 & 2012 * Water Polo:Mission League Champs - 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2017 Top All-Boys Athletic Program in the nation as ranked by ESPN RISE: 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 Loyola's football team competes in the highly competitive Serra League.

In spite of its name, State Socialism was a conservative ideology which supported the aristocracy, the church and the monarchy while maintaining harmony with capitalists and workers, in opposition to both liberalism and socialism. Hence, its supporters called themselves the Conservative Party while its opponents called themselves the National Liberal Party and the Socialist Workers' Party. Historian Alexander Nove argued that social ownership through government can only occur if the government is socially controlled which was not the case where an emperor rules by the will of God as in Germany since the Emperor was not the public.

According to journalist William Harbutt Dawson, an acknowledged expert on German politics and society, \\"[t]he great disagreement between Socialism and State Socialism is that the former would entirely subvert the State, while the latter accepts its political form as it is. Socialism would abolish the existing order altogether, while State Socialism would use the State for the accomplishment of great economic and social purposes, especially restoring to it the function, which Frederick the Great held to be the principal business of the State, of 'holding the balance [...] between classes and parties\\". Bismarck's biographer A. J. P. Taylor wrote that \\"[i]t would be unfair to say that Bismarck took up social welfare solely to weaken the Social Democrats; he had had it in mind for a long time, and believed in it deeply. But as usual he acted on his beliefs at the exact moment when they served a practical need\\".Taylor, A. J. P. (1955). Bismarck. The Man and the Statesman.

But as usual he acted on his beliefs at the exact moment when they served a practical need. challenge drove him forward. He first avowed his social programme when Bebel taunted him with his old friendship with Lassalle. He answered by calling himself a Socialist, indeed a more practical Socialist than the Social Democrats; and he provocatively rejoiced in echoing Frederick the Great's wish to be le roi des guex, king of the poor. Richter, the Progressive leader, called Bismarck's proposals 'not Socialistic, but Communistic'. The proposal was merely that part of the cost of Socials Insurance should be borne by the state; and nowadays Bismarck seems the progressive, Richter the unenlightened reactionary\\". When a reference was made to his friendship with Ferdinand Lassalle, a social-democratic nationalist and state-oriented reformist socialist, Bismarck stated that he was a more practical socialist than the Social Democrats. Bismarck justified his social welfare programs by stating that \\"[w]hoever has pensions for his old age is far more easier to handle than one who has no such prospect. Look at the difference between a private servant in the chancellery or at court; the latter will put up with much more, because he has a pension to look forward to\\".Taylor, A. J. P. (1955). Bismarck. The Man and the Statesman. London: Hamish Hamilton. p. 203.  Overview  According to William Harbutt Dawson, despite being labeled socialist by his opponents, Bismarck's social legislation sought to preserve the existing economic order and state in Germany. This was in stark contrast to socialists, who sought to subvert the power of the existing state and eventually replace the capitalist order with a socialist economy.Dawson, William Harbutt (1891). Bismarck and State Socialism: An Exposition of the Social and Economic Legislation of Germany Since 1870. London: S. Sonnenschein. p. 2. The Prussian welfare state was developed by the German academic Sozialpolitiker (Social Policy Supporter) group, intellectually associated with the historical school of economics. At the time, the historical school of economics influenced social liberalism in the United Kingdom and progressivism in the United States as well as the current post-World War II German economy (the social market economy) which is a continuation of similar policies.  Social legislation  The 1880s were a period when Germany started on its long road towards the welfare state as it is today. The Centre, National Liberal and Social Democratic political parties were all involved in the beginnings of social legislation, but it was Bismarck who established the first practical aspects of this program. The program of the Social Democrats included all of the programs that Bismarck eventually implemented, but it also included programs designed to preempt the programs championed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Bismarck's idea was to implement the minimum aspects of these programs that were acceptable to the German government without any of the overtly socialistic aspects. Bismarck opened debate on the subject on 17 November 1881 in the Imperial Message to the Reichstag, using the term practical Christianity to describe his program.Busch, Moritz (1898). Bismarck: Some Secret Pages of His History. II. New York: Macmillan. II, p. 282. In 1881, Bismarck had also referred to this program as Staatssozialismus (\\"State Socialism\\") when he made the following accurate prediction to a colleague: > It is possible that all our politics will come to nothing when I am dead but > state socialism will drub itself in (Der Staatssozialismus paukt sich > durch).Richter, Werner (1965). Bismarck. New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons. p. > 275. Bismarck's program centered squarely on insurance programs designed to increase productivity and focus the political attentions of German workers on supporting the Junker's government. The program included health insurance, accident insurance (workman's compensation), disability insurance and an old- age retirement pension, none of which then in existence to any great degree. After Bismarck left office in 1890, further social legislation regulated working time and conditions and sought to protect more vulnerable workers (women and children) and establish a system to allow redress for employer abuse. Based on Bismarck's message, the Reichstag filed three bills designed to deal with the concept of accident insurance and one for health insurance, although other bills were passed after Bismarck left office. Retirement pensions and disability insurance were placed on the back burner for the time being.Holborn, Hajo (1969). A History of Modern Germany: 1840‚Äì1945. Princeton: Princeton University Press. pp. 291‚Äì293. In a speech on 20 March 1884,Bismarck, Otto (20 March 1884). \\"Reichstagsprotokolle, 1884,1\\".

Otto von Bismarck stated: > The real grievance of the worker is the insecurity of his existence; he is > not sure that he will always have work, he is not sure that if he will > always be healthy, and he foresees that he will one day be old and unfit to > work. If he falls into poverty, even if only through a prolonged illness, he > is then completely helpless, left to his own devices, and society does not > currently recognize any real obligation toward him beyond the usual help for > the poor, even if he has been working all the time ever so faithfully and > diligently.

(2014). Social Insurance, Informality, and Labour > Markets: How to Protect Workers While Creating Good Jobs. Oxford: Oxford > University Press. p. 36. . = Health Insurance Bill of 1883 = The first bill that had success was the Health Insurance bill which was passed in 1883. The program was considered the least important from Bismarck's point of view and the least politically troublesome. The program was established to provide health insurance for the largest segment of the German workers. The health service was established on a local basis, with the cost divided between employers and the employed. The employers contributed one-third, the workers the rest. The contributions were made to \\"sickness funds\\" which employees could draw from when they needed medical care. The minimum payments for medical treatment and sick pay for up to 13 weeks were legally fixed. The individual local health bureaus were administered by a committee elected by the members of each bureau and this move had the unintended effect of establishing a majority representation for the workers on account of their large financial contribution. This worked to the advantage of the Social Democrats, who through heavy worker membership achieved their first small foothold in public administration. = Accident Insurance Bill of 1884 = Bismarck's government had to submit three draft bills before it could get one passed by the Reichstag in 1884. Bismarck had originally proposed that the federal government should pay a portion of the accident insurance contribution to show the willingness of the German government to lessen the hardship experienced by the German workers as a means of weaning them away from the various left-wing parties, most importantly the Social Democrats. The National Liberals took this program to be an expression of state socialism which they were strongly against. The Centre Party was afraid of the expansion of federal power at the expense of states' rights. The only way the program could be passed at all was for the entire expense to be underwritten by the employers. To facilitate this, Bismarck arranged for the administration of this program to be placed in the hands of \\"the organization of employers in occupational corporations\\". This organization established central and bureaucratic insurance offices on the federal and in some cases the state level to perform the actual administration. The program kicked in to replace the health insurance program as of the 14th week. It paid for medical treatment and a pension of up to two-thirds of earned wages if the worker was fully disabled. This program was expanded in 1886 to include agricultural workers. = Old Age and Disability Insurance Bill of 1889 = The old age pension program, financed by a tax on workers, was designed to provide a pension annuity for workers who reached the age of 70. At the time, the life expectancy for the average Prussian was 45, although this reflects the high infant mortality of the era and retired workers could expect to live until 70 years. Unlike accident insurance and health insurance, this program covered industrial, agrarian, artisans and servants from the start. Unlike the other two programs, the principle that the federal government should also contribute a portion of the underwriting cost, with the other two portions prorated accordingly, was accepted without question. The disability insurance program was intended to be used by those permanently disabled. This time, the state supervised the programs directly. = Workers Protection Act of 1891 = The law set up stricter regulations to ensure greater workplace safety, banned work on Sundays, introduced a maximum working day of eleven hours for women and ten hours for workers under 16 years of age and prohibited night work by them, banned those under the age of 13 from working in industry and encouraged the establishment of worker's committees in factories to address disputes. Industrial tribunals were set up to settle disputes between employees and employers.Berger, Stefan (2014). Social Democracy and the Working Class: in Nineteenth- and Twentieth-Century Germany. London: Routledge. p. 73. . = Children's Protection Act of 1903 = The law further tightened regulations on child labor to prevent exploitation of children.

Hasan became a presenter on Al Jazeera's English news channel in May 2012.\\"Mehdi Hasan joins Al Jazeera as host\\" , Al-Jazeera, 17 May 2012. Hasan has appeared (six times) on the BBC's Question Time programme,On 13 May 2010, 23 September 2010, 10 February 2011, 8 December 2011, 25 October 2012 and 3 October 2013 and the Sunday morning programmes The Big Questions and Sunday Morning Live. In 2013, Hasan took part in a debate at the Oxford Union to consider whether Islam is a peaceful religion. Hasan vouched for Islam as a religion of peace, citing political and cultural reasons for violence in Muslim majority countries, as opposed to holding the religion of Islam responsible. In the vote on the motion, the house affirmed with Hasan and the other proposers that Islam is a religion of peace with 286 votes in favor and 168 votes against. Recorded at the Oxford Union, Head to Head is a programme on Al Jazeera English in which Hasan interviews major public figures; it had run for three series by December 2014. Since 2015, working full-time for the network in Washington DC, Hasan has hosted a weekly interview and discussion programme. Hasan began a podcast in 2018 entitled Deconstructed, produced by the Investigative journalism website The Intercept. On air, Hasan would discuss recent news topics and host guests. Notable topics covered on the podcast include police shootings, inequality, QAnon, and President Donald Trump's activity on Twitter. Notable podcast guests include Noam Chomsky, Ilhan Omar, and Bernie Sanders. On October 2nd, 2020, Hasan announced that he would no longer host the show as part of his move to host a new primetime news show on NBC's new streaming service, Peacock. Hassan became a naturalized US citizen on October 9, 2020.

He argues that \\"Today it is difficult, if not impossible, to identify a Muslim-majority nation that could plausibly be identified as a modern, viable and legitimate \\"Islamic state\\" and that \\"contrary to popular Muslim opinion, there is not a shred of theological, historical or empirical evidence to support the existence of such an entity.\\" In November 2009, Hasan wrote a column denouncing suicide bombing from an Islamic perspective.Mehdi Hasan \\"Suicide attacks are un-Islamic\\" , New Statesman, 5 November 2009 Hasan argued that \\"There is, in fact, nothing Islamic about so-called Islamic terrorism‚Ä¶ So why are many Muslims so reluctant to condemn such cold-blooded tactics of terror?\\" In April 2010, Hasan wrote a piece condemning the controversial Islamic advocacy of the death penalty for apostasy in the New Statesman.Mehdi Hasan \\"Islam can do without Simon Cowell\\" , New Statesman, 2 April 2010 He states that \\"The sharia (or Islamic law), it is claimed, sanctions the death penalty for any adult Muslim who chooses to leave the faith, or apostatise. This is an intellectually, morally and, perhaps above all, theologically unsustainable position.\\" In April 2012, Hasan wrote an article criticising British Muslims for being obsessed with foreign affairs and the anti-war movement.Mehdi Hasan \\"British Muslims must step outside this anti-war comfort zone\\" , The Guardian, 2 April 2012 He criticised British Muslims' apparent apathy towards national issues: \\"Why is it that most British Muslims get so excited and aroused by foreign affairs, yet seem so bored by and uninterested in domestic politics and the economy?\\" Following allegations of Jewish conspiracy by British peer Lord Ahmed in March 2013, Hasan referred to antisemitism in the British Muslim community as being \\"routine and commonplace\\". In May 2013, he appeared at an Oxford Union debate proposing a motion arguing that Islam is a religion of peace. The motion was carried.Rachel Goddard-Bernstein \\"Debate: This House believes Islam is a religion of peace\\" , Oxford Student [30 May 2013] Following the 2017 Westminster attack, Hasan wrote an article in The Intercept criticising what he referred to as the \\"common stereotype of the Middle Eastern, Muslim-born terrorist.\\" He pointed out that the perpetrator of the attack, Khalid Masood, was born and raised in the United Kingdom and, therefore would not have been affected by any immigration ban. He also pointed out that Masood converted to Islam late in life and still had a history of criminality prior to his conversion. Hasan concluded, ergo, that while \\"a distorted, simplistic and politicized form of Islam\\" provided the justification for Masood's actions, the main motivation lay in \\"social networks and family ties; issues of identity and belonging; a sense of persecution; mental illness; socio-economic grievances; moral outrage over conflict and torture; a craving for glory and purpose, action and adventure.\\" Hasan also referenced to a 2008 leaked report by researchers for MI5, a 2010 Demos study, and a 2016 Egmont study, that came to similar conclusions \\"challeng[ing] the conventional... wisdom on the role of religion in the radicalization process.\\" Coverage in the media Hasan stated that the media should be sanctioned for \\"dishonest, demonising press coverage\\" of Muslims and other minorities, stating: \\"I'm all in favour of free speech and the robust criticism of all religious beliefs. But it's the made-up stories and the smearing of individuals and whole communities that I have an issue with. Why isn't anti-Muslim bigotry as unacceptable in the press as anti- Jewish bigotry?\\".Williams, Oscar.

In October 2013, on BBC Question Time, Hasan claimed that the Daily Mail was, among other accusations, \\"Muslim-smearing\\". The paper responded by claiming that he had applied to them for a column in 2010, praising their editorial standards and some of their positions.Tim Stanley \\"Mehdi Hasan, the Daily Mail, Ralph Miliband and the scary moral hypocrisy of the Left\\" , telegraph.co.uk, 7 October 2013 =Abortion= Hasan has defended his anti-abortion views in print, writing \\"What I would like is for my fellow lefties and liberals to try to understand and respect the views of those of us who are pro-life\\" in an October 2012 online column for the New Statesman.Mehdi Hasan \\"Being pro-life doesn‚Äôt make me any less of a lefty\\", New Statesman (blog), 11 October 2012. Hasan's two articles on the abortion debate were cross-posted at The Huffington Post. Hasan argued that the issue of abortion \\"is one of those rare political issues on which left and right seem to have swapped ideologies: right-wingers talk of equality, human rights and 'defending the innocent', while left-wingers fetishise 'choice', selfishness and unbridled individualism.\\" (He later regretted expressing himself in this way.)Mehdi Hasan \\"10 things I learned from debating abortion on Twitter\\", New Statesman (blog), 16 October 2012 The article gained much attention on Twitter\\"Has pro-lifer Mehdi Hasan been victimised on Twitter?\\" The Independent (website), 16 October 2012 and Hasan debated the issue with Suzanne Moore on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.\\"Can the left be anti- abortion?\\" Today, BBC News, 16 October 2012.

Hasan challenged Trump's statements in a video essay published by The Intercept in October 2018. In February 2019, during a debate organised by Intelligence Squared in London, Hasan stated that the West should cut ties with Saudi Arabia, saying > ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time we make clear that the West needs to cut its ties with Saudi > Arabia, especially military ties, arms exports, weapons, bombs,‚Äù The comments were made in response to the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, allegedly ordered by the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammad Bin Salman, as well as several human rights violations which Hasan cited as also being carried out by Saudi Arabia. Hasan had previously interviewed Khashoggi about freedom of speech in Saudi Arabia. =Controversy= During a sermon delivered in 2009,Islamic Unity Society \\"Arbaeen Majlis 2009 (Mehdi Hassan)\\" , Islamic Unity Society, 2009 quoting a verse of the Quran, Hasan used the use term \\"cattle\\" to describe non-believers. Hasan wrote in his New Statesman blog: \\"The Quranic phrase 'people of no intelligence' simply and narrowly refers to the fact that Muslims regard their views on God as the only intellectually tenable position, just as atheists (like Richard Dawkins or Sam Harris) regard believers as fundamentally irrational and, even, mentally deficient.\\"Mehdi Hasan \\"Who are you calling an Islamist?\\" New Statesman, 28 July 2009 Hasan returned to this issue in August 2012 following criticism from the columnist Peter Hitchens that \\"the entire 45-minute speech is primarily an attack on Muslim extremists who try and justify violence against non-Muslims on an 'ends justify the means' basis\\", but noted of his 2009 comments that his \\"phraseology was ill-judged, ill-advised and, even, inappropriate\\".Mehdi Hasan \\"Anatomy of a Hitchens Hatchet Job\\", The Huffington Post, 5 August 2012  Awards  In January 2014, Hasan was awarded the Services to Media award at the British Muslim Awards.

The built-up area with Minera had a population of 5,723, 2011 census. https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=W37000356 History The etymology of the placename is from Welsh coed \\"wood\\" with poeth meaning, in its original sense, \\"burnt\\",Palmer, A. N. A History of Ancient Tenures of Land in North Wales and The Marches, 1910, p.88 although the modern Welsh word translates as \\"hot\\". The name therefore translates roughly as \\"burnt wood\\", perhaps referring to the charcoal burning heritage in the village and local woods. In its early history the area known as Coedpoeth was not a settlement, but was described (in 1411) as a \\"waste\\" ‚Äì an uncultivated area ‚Äì and later as a \\"common\\", presumably a wood with rights of common, in the upper part of the township of Bersham. Even as recently as 1832, the village of Coedpoeth did not yet exist as it currently does, and was instead four small hamlets. The Nant (from the Welsh word nant, a stream or brook) to the south possessed two mills on the River Clywedog: Adwy'r Clawdd (literally \\"the gap in the dyke\\") to the north-east was named after a gap in Offa's Dyke. The Talwrn (from Welsh talwrn, a cockpit, or more usually a field or open spaceY Geiriadur Mawr (Gwasg Gomer) Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru) in the valley of the River Gwenfro to the north, was home to several small-scale coal mines, and the name of the Smelt, to the west, referred to smelting of lead in the area. These four hamlets became areas of Coedpoeth which grew, with increasing industrial development, around the inns and market hall on the ridge that became the high street of the village. The changes in population were reflected by a new church opening in 1875, with a replacement stone-built church, dedicated to St. Tudfil, being opened in 1895 as a chapel of ease within the ecclesiastical parish of Minera.Coedpoeth, St. Tudfyl, GENUKI By the 1860s, the village was named Coed Poeth, and this form of the name remained until the 1940s at the latest. The majority of 18th to early 20th century buildings in the village are constructed from local sandstone quarried at Penygelli quarries, with later examples being built with Ruabon red brick. In civil administrative terms, Coedpoeth remained within the civil parish of Bersham. Later reorganisations, notably the 1974 changes subsequent to the 1972 Local Government Act, saw Coedpoeth included in its own local government community, with Bersham village placed in the community of Esclusham. A traditionally Welsh-speaking village, the use of Welsh has declined rapidly in the last two decades. Traditional methods of employment included the areas many coal mines, lead mining and smelting at Minera Lead Mines and the Smelt, and quarrying, in the nearby Penygelli, Berwig, and Minera quarries, all served directly by local railways. The late 20th century saw a decline in the area's traditional industries, and all have now disappeared. Today Coedpoeth is a dormitory village for commuters to Wrexham, and a point of sale for goods used by local farms and hamlets. There are still many small businesses in the village centre along the high street; but these small shops face fierce competition from large chain stores in Wrexham.  Lead and coal mining  The village was surrounded by natural resources such as lime, iron ore, coal, and lead, and many ruins show the industrial past of the area. The earliest industry was lead smelting and an area of the village named \\"The Smelt\\" contains street names referencing the industry. Coal mining in Coedpoeth is documented from the early 15th century. Limited and shallow extraction took place throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, especially for the local iron industry. However, significant extraction did not begin until the sinking of the first deep shafts in the early 20th century, and now little remains of the industry. A number of colliery waste tips survive, now grown over, and the remains of shallow workings and bell pits are relatively common in some areas, with scheduled examples near Nant Mill. The most significant remains of the industry exist at Plas Power, where many buildings survive after reclamation of the waste tips in the 1990s. The owners of this colliery were also the owners of Plas Power Hall, which was built in 1757 by the Myddleton family; the name was changed to match an early owner, Sir Henry Power. The hall was damaged in a fire and demolished in 1951; but the stables remain after a campaign to list them led by Councillor Gordon Roberts of Middle Road. The estates boundary wall remains, and fills the gap between Coedpoeth and Wrexham, and the northern boundary is followed by the A525, apart from modifications at the A483 junction. Transport Coedpoeth Station, 1900 The village once had its own railway station on the Wrexham and Minera Railway of the Great Western Railway ‚Äî albeit in name only as it was sited in the parish of Minera. A campaign was launched in 1905 by the business people of Coedpoeth to have a branch line laid from the station to the village centre, one mile distant. Local businesses claimed the station's location was of little benefit to them. The Great Western Railway company did not agree, and the campaign was abandoned in 1906. In 1914, the original station buildings were destroyed in a fire set by militant suffragettes.Otago Daily Times , Issue 16107, 23 June 1914, Page 7 Originally offering through services to two further halts on the line (Vicarage halt serving western Minera, and Berwig Halt), the station was a passenger terminus from 1926 and passenger services were withdrawn from 1930, although heavy goods use of the line by Berwig Quarry and Minera Limeworks continued until closure of the line in 1970, after the Limeworks was reduced to a base for road aggregates and was served by road. Bus services first came to the village in the 1920s; they were first provided by the local government's Wrexham & District Transport Co. Ltd bus service from Wrexham, and followed by Great Western Railway's own bus services. Eventually Crosville Motor Services expanded into the area, and remained until Arriva North West & Wales came to manage all of their services, vehicles and depot in the area. Today, the village is linked to Wrexham by two bus services, one run by Arriva Buses Wales and another by D Jones and Son; also GHA Coaches provide a night time service, as well as all routes through the village going on to Ruthin and Denbigh, which now also stop along the high street. George Edwards and Son used to provide a daytime service, but in late 2008 they sold their service routes to D Jones and Son. Education Coedpoeth Old Carnegie Library Coedpoeth has two schools: Ysgol Penygelli and Ysgol Bryn Tabor (a Welsh- medium school). Originally one school in a Victorian building located to the north of the A525, Ysgol Penygelli was split into an infants school incorporating a nursery year and years 1‚Äì2, and a junior school, for years 3‚Äì6. The junior school is a feeder for the secondary school Ysgol Clywedog, in nearby Wrexham. Ysgol Bryn Tabor shared the same complex as Penygelli Infants to the south of the A525, which was part early 20th-century, with a large 1980s extension. Originally the local LEA planned to refurbish the original building on the north side of the road, but after a fire which destroyed the wooden beams supporting the original Welsh Slate roof, this building was demolished and materials reclaimed for an affordable housing scheme on the site. As a result, a new school complex was built and opened in July 2006, on the playing fields of the newer school, and Penygelli Infants and Penygelli Juniors are now one school again. Ysgol Bryn Tabor then expanded into the old Penygelli Infants site. The old junior school building was left vacant until demolition during March 2007. The site was then used for a new community centre and hall, named Plas Pentwyn.http://www.plas-pentwyn.co.uk/ Pentwyn was the name of a farm that once stood nearby, belonging to the Powell family. The original local library was a Carnegie Library built in 1904 as Coedpoeth Free Library. It cost ¬£1,500 at the time, all of which was donated by Andrew Carnegie, the Scottish-American steel magnate. It was built in the same local sandstone as other buildings in the village, from quarries nearby, and stands opposite the villages memorial park and bowling greens. When opened, the ground floor featured a billiard table in a games room, as well as a refreshments room, with the rear of the building used for meetings of the local parish government. The reading room, which could also be used as a lecture room, was on the first floor. As the library was modernised, it was moved to the large games room on the ground floor, and the rest of the building became the community council headquarters. As use of the old library increased, it became crowded, and the facilities were deemed inadequate. When Plas Pentwyn was constructed, room for a new library was provided, leaving the sole purpose for the old Carnegie Library as the headquarters for Coedpoeth Community Council, which has had a growing role in recent years. Notable people The missionary Gwenfron Moss was born here in 1898.https://biography.wales/article/s7-MOSS-GWE-1898 Olympic champion rower Tom James grew up in the village. Brighton & Hove Albion footballer Jordan Davies. Actor Ricky Tomlinson previously lived here. Locality Coedpoeth is on a hill between the Clywedog and Gwenfro valleys, surrounded by countryside with views of the Cheshire plain, Tanyfron, Southsea and the town of Wrexham. The highest point of the village is Rock Place at 800 feet (245 m) above sea- level. The neighbouring village of Bwlchgwyn is one of several claiming to be the highest village in Wales, at 1090 feet (333 m). The area is prone to snowfall, and has suffered localised flooding in recent years due to heavy rain. Welsh Water significantly invested in new drainage for the village in 2012, alleviating this problem. Football For a full history see; List of football seasons involving Coedpoeth and Minera teams The first football club in Coedpoeth was Lloftwen who there are reports of in January 1878. The next club in the village was Equitable who formed around 1880, and folded around 1884. Equitable entered the Welsh Cup in 1881.https://www.welshsoccerarchive.co.uk/welsh_cup.php?id=5 A club called Coedpoeth also existed at the same time who competed in the Welsh Cup from 1882‚Äì1884. Given that both these clubs appear and disappear at simultaneously it is possible that they were the same club, using interchangeable names depended on the reporter. In 1884 there are reports of a team called White Stars (Coedpoeth), whilst in 1887 there is reports of a team called North End (Coedpoeth) who played at a ground called The Terrace.https://newspapers.library.wales/view/4592414/4592422/58/ The short lived Minera Rovers and Minera Victoria contested the Welsh Amateur Cup in 1890 and 1891. By 1892 Adwy United had emerged to represent the area. Adwy United reached the Semi Final of Welsh Amateur Cup in 1895. By 1898 they were joined in the Denbighshire League by another local team, Minera St Marys. Minera St Marys only lasted one season in this competition, taking on the fixtures of Cerney Swifts and finishing second from bottom. Adwy United were more competitive in the Denbighshire League, finishing third in 1899. They also won the St Martins Cup beating St Martins 5‚Äì0 at The Racecourse, Wrexham. There are reports of Adwy United playing in \\"the same coloured jerseys\\" as Chirk. Whilst this does not provide a definite answer on what colours Adwy United wore, it is documented that Chirk played in White and Blue. Adwy United withdrew from the Denbighshire League in 1900 and merged with Coedpoeth Victoria to form Adwy Victoria. This team finished second in the Denbighshire League in 1901. Coedpoeth United were first mentioned in 1907 when they joined the Wrexham & District League. They finished second in the Second Division and were promoted to the First Division for the 1908‚Äì09 season where they finished third. The 1908‚Äì09 season also saw the introduction of a Coedpoeth United Reserves team in the Second Division, who were joined in the league by another team from the village, Coedpoeth St Davids. In 1909 the team also reached the final of the Denbighshire & Flintshire Charity Cup, and St Martins Cup. Coedpoeth United withdrew from the Wrexham & District League in 1910. This is the last record of any football teams in Coedpoeth prior to World War One. Following the end of hostilities Coedpoeth United re-emerged in 1920 in the North Wales Alliance League Division 2, a competition in which they finished as Runners Up, only missing out on being Champions on goals scored. From 1921-1924 Coedpoeth entered the newly formed Welsh National League (North). Between 1935-1938 the club competed in the Wrexham & District League. Following the end of World War II, Coedpoeth re-emerged in the newly formed Welsh National League Wrexham Area East. They were Champions of the East Division in 1948 and 1949. The 1949 League winning team had a 100% record, and was promoted to Welsh National League Wrexham Area Division 1. The club stayed in Division 1 for two seasons, before being relegated in 1951. The club finished as Runners Up in Division 2 in 1953 achieving Promotion back to Division 1. The team was immediately relegated again, and played a final season in Division 2 before folding at the end of the 1955 season. In 1964 almost a decade after the previous Coedpoeth team had folded, Coedpoeth Sports Club entered Welsh National League Wrexham Area Division 3. Coedpoeth SC were immediately successful and were Champions in their first season gaining Promotion to Division 2. Their stay in Division 2 lasted two seasons as in 1967 they were Champions and Promoted again. The club lasted 5 seasons in Division 1 before finishing 15th in 1972 and dropping two leagues back to Division 3. The club initially struggled back in Division 3, however in 1974 Coedpoeth SC were Champions and promoted. 1976 saw the club complete a League and Cup double as they won Division 2 alongside the Horace Wynne Cup. The club finished 10th back in Division 1, however folded in 1977 after being knocked out of the Welsh Cup in the Qualifying Round. Coedpoeth once again reformed for the start of the 1980-81 season and finished Second in Welsh National League Wrexham Area Division 4 however were not Promoted. The following the season the club went one better and were Champions of the Division 4. This marked the beginning of an astonishing rise, as the club claimed the Division 3 title at its first attempt, and finished as Division 2 Runners Up straight away too. The club finished 13th in its first season in Division 1 and was subsequently relegated. The club remained in Division 2 before folding in 1989. The current Adult section of the club reformed in 1999 and joined the Welsh National League.

As of May 2019, it has one seat in the National Parliament and is led by Minister for Foreign Affairs, Rimbink Pato.  History  There were attempts from 1964 to 1968 to form political parties. A meeting was held in Port Moresby and a Territory Country Party, organized along the Australian Country Party was formed in 1967. The connection between Australian Country Party and political parties in PNG was through the Compass Party (later United Party). Despite talks and media release, the Compass Party was formed in Minj in 1967 by certain expatriate and indigenous Members of the House of Assembly who were aligned with the farmers and planters association, the Highlands Farmers & Settlers Association Incorporated (HFSA). Members of HFSA in Parliament were Ian Downs, Highlands Special (President of HFSA), John Watts (WH Regional), Mike Casey (Kainantu), Sinake Giregire (Goroka) (first indigenous member of HFSA). The prominent national being Giregire and Members from Simbu and EH. After its formation, Tei Abal (Wabag) was appointed its Leader with Giregire as Deputy. The United went into 1968 Elections and returned as a force against the pro independence, Pangu Party. As the Partyy was conservative, most of its Members were appointed Ministers and Vice Ministers. The Party went again to the polls in 1972 and returned and with the self-government in 1973, Tei Abal and Sinake Giregire and Paul Langro were on the Constitutional Planning Committee. The third Party was the Peoples Progress Party (1970) under Julius Chan (Namatanai). At this time, the Australian Country Party sent an officer to PNG to assist the United Party in establishing its working structure. This ACP officer was in Eastern Highlands (Goroka) and so Giregire took on the advantage of the Australian canvassing and organisational assistance to form a PNG version of the Australian Country Party. Using the Constitutional Planning Committee (a faction calling itself the Nationlaist Pressure Group - Giregire, Fr. John Momis and John Kaputin) Giregire canvassed support to bring a fourth force with Members from United Party and Pangu Pati to form Country Party which was formally recognized on the floor of Parliament in March 1974. The Country Party had 14 Members under the leadership of Sir Sinake Giregire (MP for Goroka and later Daulo) and Michael Pondros (Manus). The role of Country Party featured prominently in the Constituent Assembly when it was more or was taking the lead in the Nationalist Pressure Group (Momis, Kaputin and Giregire) who wanted to present the CPC Report as it is to become the Constitution and on one hand Somare and Pangu who wanted amendments such as dropping the Provincial Government system. This followed on with Melanesian Alliance Party under Fr. John Momis and the Mataungan Association taking a political party status with John Kaputin and Oscar Tammur on floor of Parliament. Despite the breakup, United Party contested the 1977 Elections and came with a majority of Members but Pangu formed a COalition with PPP, National Party, Melanesian Alliance and Mataungan against United/Country Party with Somare as Prime Minister. Country Party, United Party and National Party were seen as a Highlands dominated Party. To break that stronghold Somare appointed Paias Wingti as his Deputy Leader in 1982. Wingti then broke ranks with Pangu and with other Members including from United Party formed Peoples Democratic Movement in 1985. With the loss of Sir Tei Abal, Leader of United Party in 1987, leadership tussle came into play with Roy Evara, Anton Parao, Paul Torato and others. Gradually, the fortunes of United Party waned in 1992 and 1997 Elections. In 1997 Elections it had only one MP in Gabia Gagarimambu. In 2002, it had three MP's in Bire Kimisopa (Goroka), Bob Dadae (Kabwum) and Ben Kiagi (Daulo). The party went to the 2007 National Elections under leadership of Hon. Kimisopa but returned with two out of 109 seats in the 2007 General Elections. At the 2002 elections, the party won 3 seats in the 109-seat national parliament. The party leader for the 2002-2007 term was Bire Kimisopa, member for Goroka Open, in Eastern Highlands province. In the 2007 elections, the party won 2 seats in parliament. Kimisopa was replaced as party leader on 22 August 2007, having lost his seat. He was replaced as leader by Bob Dadae, member for Kabwum Open in Morobe Province. Dadae crossed to the People's National Congress in May 2012, stating that his people wanted him to be aligned with a major party. The party won one seat at the 2012 election, with Rimbink Pato winning Wapenamanda Open and assuming the United Party leadership.

Plastic wrap, typically sold on rolls in boxes with a cutting edge, clings to many smooth surfaces and can thus remain tight over the opening of a container without adhesive. Common plastic wrap is roughly 0.0005 inches (12.7 Œºm) thick. The trend has been to produce thinner plastic wrap, particularly for household use (where very little stretch is needed), so now the majority of brands on shelves around the world are 8, 9 or 10 Œºm thick. Materials used Plastic wrap was initially created from polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which remains the most common component globally. PVC has an acceptably-low permeability to water vapor and oxygen, helping to preserve the freshness of food. There are concerns about the transfer of plasticizers from PVC into food. A common, cheaper alternative to PVC is low-density polyethylene (LDPE). It is less adhesive than PVC, but this can be remedied by adding linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), which also increases the film's tensile strength. In the US and Japan, plastic wrap is sometimes produced using polyvinylidene chloride (PVdC), though some brands, such as Saran wrap, have switched to other formulations due to environmental concerns. Food use =Purpose= bread wrapped in plastic wrap The most important role plastic wrap plays in food packaging is protection and preservation. Plastic wrap can prevent food from perishing, extend its shelf-life, and maintain the quality of food. Plastic wrap generally provides protection for food from three aspects: chemical (gases, moisture, and light), biological (microorganisms, insects and animals), and physical (mechanical damage). In addition to food protection and preservation, plastic wrap can also reduce food waste, tag food information, ease the distribution processes, and increase product visibility and microwavability. =Health concern= Plastic materials are widely used in the food industry due to its low price and convenience; however, there has been an increased health concern because of the possibility of releasing undesirable chemicals from plastic materials into food products. Plastic packages are made of various materials such as polyethylene, low-density polyethylene, etc. Additives, including lubricants, plasticizers, UV absorbers, colorants, and antioxidants, are added into plastic materials in order to improve the quality and properties of the plastics. Besides, plastic materials are often coated and printed in the final processes, in which inks and varnishes are used. Although the barrier properties of the plastic packages provide protection of foods from external contaminations, the additives and coating materials in the plastic packages are able to penetrate into foods and cause health-related issues. \\"It is true that substances used to make plastics can leach into food,\\" says Edward Machuga, Ph.D., a consumer safety officer in the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. ‚ÄúBut as part of the approval process, the FDA considers the amount of a substance expected to migrate into food and the toxicological concerns about the particular chemical.‚Äù A couple of cases have caught media attention in recent years. One case is in regard to diethylhexyl adipate (DEHA). DEHA is a plasticizer, a substance added to some plastics in order to make them flexible. The public concerns about DEHA exposure while consuming food with plastic wraps. There are potentials of exposure to DEHA; however, the levels of the exposure are much lower than the no toxic effect levels in animal studies. Another case is in regard to the dioxins, labeled as \\"likely human carcinogen\\" by the Environmental Protection Agency. The public has been misled by the claims that plastics contain dioxins, while Machuga stated that no evidence that shows plastic containers or films contain dioxins was seen by the FDA. Overall the use of plastic wrap in the food industry does not pose danger to human health. =Environmental concerns= The accumulation of plastic debris on the Earth threatens both wildlife and the environment. Plastic debris might choke or trap wildlife, and it could also penetrate toxic compounds into ecosystems. This land-originated problem has become a problem in ocean ecosystem as well since streams and rivers which are close to the land have carried the plastic debris into the coast, and currents transfer it to everywhere in the ocean. Plastic debris is a potential danger to all forms of aquatic life. Some marine species, like sea turtles, take plastic as prey items by mistake. Besides, some species might even pick up plastics and feed their offspring, which cause huge problems on growth and even cause mortality. Toxic compounds in plastics can disrupt hormone regulation in the cells of organisms, which can lead to alteration of animals‚Äô mating behavior, reproductive ability, and even cause the development of tumors. Plastic debris could be a big threat to lives in the ocean. A study shows that using recycled plastic materials can reduce the environmental impacts significantly as a result of minimizing exploration, mining and transportation of natural gas and oil. One of the possible ways to increase the recycling rate is adding fibrous reinforcement into plastics. The environmental impact has been assessed using the life cycle assessment method. The results showed that plastics with fibrous reinforcement added can sharply reduce resource usage and global warming in civil applications.

The film \\"introduced\\" Huntz Hall in his first of the East Side Kids film series. It was released in the United Kingdom under the title Stand and Deliver. Plot Two police officers patrolling the streets of New York City's Bowery discuss the lamentable fact that most of the young boys in the neighborhood will turn to crime and end up in jail. One exception, they agree, is Danny Breslin (Bobby Jordan), a young boxer who is studying economics and destined for success. While Danny's future looks bright, the future of his former best friend, Muggs McGinnis (Leo Gorcey), appears to hold little more than troubles with the law and juvenile probation. One day, when Danny learns that Muggs has been speaking poorly of his schoolteacher sister Mary (Charlotte Henry), he marches over to Clancy's Pool Hall, their favorite neighborhood haunt, and punches Muggs. The fight eventually turns into a pool hall riot, which results in Muggs's arrest. Officer Tom Brady (Warren Hull), Mary's sweetheart, believes that many of the boys can be reformed, and when he learns that Muggs has been involved in another fight, he tries to enlist Danny's help in determining the reason behind Muggs' propensity to fight. Danny surprises his mother, sister and Tom when he violently protests Tom's request, saying that he hates \\"coppers,\\" and vows never to return to the police gym for his boxing practice. While Tom lays plans to reform Muggs by entering him as a fighter in the upcoming Golden Glove Tournament, Danny unwittingly gets involved with notorious thug Monk Martin (Bobby Stone). Unknown to Danny, Monk has used him to drive his getaway car in a grocery store holdup. After paying Danny for his \\"services,\\" Monk manages to persuade him to quit school and join his racket. Meanwhile, Muggs, having made great strides at the Whitney reform school, goes to live with Tom and his mother (Martha Wentworth), much to the dismay of Mary, who promptly breaks off her relationship with Tom. Muggs eventually wins the respect of the entire neighborhood and earns the police department's sponsorship of his fight in the Golden Glove Tournament. So completely has Muggs given up his delinquent ways that he curses Monk when the racketeer offers him $1,000 to take a fall in the tournament fight. Later, after overhearing Tom's mother blaming his arrival for the break-up of Tom and Mary's relationship, Muggs becomes despondent and decides to move out. Just before the fight, crooked fight promoter Slats Morrison (Eddie Foster) plants the intended bribery money in Muggs's gear and tries to frame him. Danny, meanwhile, is wounded by Tom as he and Monk are caught fleeing from a robbery. Hospitalized and in desperate need of blood, Danny's life hangs in the balance until Muggs volunteers his blood and saves his best friend. Mary has a change of heart and returns to Tom, and Tom announces that Monk made a full confession before dying. Danny's family gathers around a radio and listens with pride as Muggs knocks out his opponent at the tournament. Following the fight, Slats and his boss Dorgan are arrested, and Tom and Mary look forward to their wedding. Production Huntz Hall's first East Side Kids film.

It was founded in April 2001 by Madang businessman and former MP Peter Yama, who sought a return to politics after having lost his seat at the 1997 election. He pledged that, if the party formed the next government, it would give ten percent of the national budget to churches to assist young people, stating that \\"PNG proclaimed itself to be a Christian country but the Government had not made that a reality.\\" He also pledged to fight corruption and to investigate a number of past financial deals involving the national government. The party won four seats at the 2002 election: Yama (Usino-Bundi Open), Yuntavi Bao (Kainantu Open), Miki Kaeok (Wapenamanda Open) and Ekis Ropenu (Kerema Open). It supported Michael Somare for Prime Minister and was to be allocated one ministry in his government, but Yama stated that he would step aside due to a misconduct investigation. Three more MPs were reported to have joined the party in December 2002: Cecilking Doruba (sole MP for the PNG First Party), Gordon Wesley (sole MP for the One People Party) and independent Fabian Ine, although they faced issues with anti-floor crossing laws. The misconduct proceedings against Yama were quashed in March 2003. The party won an additional seat at the Southern Highlands supplementary election in May 2003, with the election of Balus Libe in Komo-Magarina Open. Yama claimed at that time that with further defections the party had a total of 10 MPs Yama was promoted to the ministry in August 2003 as Minister for Labour and Industrial Relations, but was sacked in November. Bao also served as a minister in Somare's government, but was himself sacked in January 2004 after the party voted against an attempted constitutional amendment to curb no- confidence votes. Following their sacking, the party moved to the opposition and attempted to oust the Somare government. In May 2004, Yama was briefly recognised as Leader of the Opposition when Speaker Jeffrey Nape attempted to prevent Peter O'Neill from taking the office. However, in July, the party announced that Repenu had replaced Yama as leader, and that the party would again support the government. The party again reversed later in the term, with Yama regaining the leadership and the party pledging to strongly oppose the re-election of the Somare government by the time of the 2007 election. The party won two seats at the 2007 election: Patrick Kondo in Daulo Open and Koni Iguan in Markham Open, while Yama was defeated in a bid for Governor of Madang Province. Iguan succeeded Yama as party leader. However, Iguan crossed to the Papua New Guinea Party in January 2011. Yama attempted to re-enter parliament at the 2012 election but was unsuccessful, and was again defeated in a 2013 by-election. The party was registered to contest the 2017 election, and won two seats in the National Parliament. As of May 2019, the party has 1 seat in the National Parliament.

The term was first used in British law in a statute of the British Parliament in 1885 and was carried forward in other statutes throughout the British Empire. The offense was never actually defined in any of the statutes which used it, which left the scope of the offense to be defined by court decisions. The concept of gross indecency as a criminal offense is reflective of Victorian-era morality. History The term gross indecency was first used in the Labouchere Amendment (section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885), which criminalized sexual acts between men, including those done in private. Gross indecency statutes consequently spread throughout the British Empire. Canada adopted the term in section 178 of the Criminal Code in 1892. The term was also used in the Criminal Code (sections 206 (1906, 1927), 149 (1953‚Äì1954), 157 (1970), 161 (1985)) as well as in the Criminal Law Amendment Act (1968‚Äì1969, section 7); however, all statutes that used the term were repealed in 1985 with an amendment to both the Criminal Code and the Canada Evidence Act. The United Kingdom later used the term in the Sexual Offences Act 1956 and in section 1(1) of the Indecency with Children Act 1960. =Notable cases= Oscar Wilde was charged and convicted of gross indecency in 1895. His trial and punishment is the subject of the 1997 play Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde. Alan Turing pleaded guilty to the crime in 1952, the consequences of which led to his suicide in 1954. Turing, who had been convicted of gross indecency for consensual, private homosexual acts, received a posthumous pardon in 2013. In 2017, under the Alan Turing law, all men convicted of gross indecency due to consensual, private sexual acts were pardoned. Everett George Klippert was the last person in Canada to be arrested, charged, prosecuted, convicted, and imprisoned for gross indecency for homosexuality before the decriminalization of homosexual acts in 1969; the reform was a direct result of the Klippert case.*Donald W. McLeod: Lesbian and gay liberation in Canada: a selected annotated chronology, 1964-1975: Toronto: ECW Press/Homewood Books, 1996: . In 1965 Everett George Klippert was interrogated by the police as part of an arson investigation in the Northwest Territories. Klippert was arrested after admitting that he had had sex with other men. When psychiatrists determined that he was unlikely to stop having sex with men, he was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to life in prison.

Current legislation =Australia= South Australia In Australia, a gross indecency statute exists in South Australia, with gross indecency requiring the involvement of a minor (a person under 16 years old). A first-time offense is a three-year felony, and any subsequent offense is a five-year felony.http://www.caldicottlawyers.com.au/criminal-offences/sexual- offences/acts-of-gross-incecency =Kenya= Gross indecency between male persons of any age, in public or private, is a felony punishable by up to five years' imprisonment.Kenya Penal Code, Sections 162, 163, and 165 Gross indecency is a lesser offense than sodomy, which is punishable by up to 14 years' imprisonment. LGBT rights activists are trying to repeal the law. =United States= Michigan In the United States, Michigan is the only state that currently has gross indecency statutes. Michigan has three types of gross indecency crimes exist, all of which are five-year felonies: * Gross indecency between male persons * Gross indecency between female persons * Gross indecency between male and female persons Gross indecency between male persons was codified first, and the other two were made into laws later. Historically, the definition of gross indecency was unclear, and courts relied on nebulous notions such as the \\"common sense of society\\". The vagueness of the term allowed for adults who engaged in consensual sex with no monetary transactions in the privacy of their own homes to be charged with the crime, and men who had sex with men were particularly vulnerable to prosecution. Over time, the definition increasingly narrowed through Michigan Supreme Court decisions, and a 1994 decision officially narrowed it to sex acts that occurred in a public place or that involved a minor, the application of force, or a monetary transaction. Michigan now has separate statutes addressing all four aforementioned acts in statutes regarding indecent exposure, criminal sexual conduct (CSC), and prostitution; however, the gross indecency statutes remain in effect. The gross indecency statutes have been criticized by LGBT rights activists.

It is specifically used in heparin overdose, in low molecular weight heparin overdose, and to reverse the effects of heparin during delivery and heart surgery. It is given by injection into a vein. The onset of effects is typically within five minutes. Common side effects include low blood pressure, slow heart rate, allergic reactions, and vomiting. Allergic reactions may be severe and include anaphylaxis. The risk is greater in males who have had a vasectomy. While there is no evidence of harm from using during pregnancy it has not been well studied in this group. Protamine works by binding with heparin. Protamine sulfate was approved for medical use in the United States in 1969. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It was originally made from the sperm of salmon. It is now mainly made using recombinant biotechnology. Medical uses Protamine sulfate is usually administered to reverse the large dose of heparin administered during certain surgeries, especially heart surgery where anti-coagulation is necessary to prevent clot formation within the cardiopulmonary bypass pump apparatus. A dose of protamine is given once the patient is off-pump, when extracorporeal circulation and anticoagulation are no longer needed. It is also used in gene transfer, protein purification and in tissue cultures as a crosslinker for viral transduction. In gene therapy, protamine sulfate has been studied as a means to increase transduction rates by both viral and nonviral-mediated delivery mechanisms (e.g. utilizing cationic liposomes). Protamine is used in insulin aspart protamine and NPH insulin. =Dosage= Dosage for heparin reversal is 1.0 to 1.5 mg protamine sulfate IV for every 100 IU of active heparin. PTT should be monitored at 5 to 15 minutes after dose then in 2‚Äì8 hours afterward. Adverse effects Protamine has been reported to cause allergic reactions in patients who are allergic to fish, diabetics using insulin preparations containing protamine, and vasectomized or infertile men. These occur at rates ranging from 0.28% to 6%. Avoiding rapid infusion of protamine sulfate and pre-treating at-risk patients with histamine receptor antagonists (H1 and H2) and steroids may minimize these reactions. A 5 to 10 mg test dose is recommended following pretreatment before administering the full dose. Mechanism It is a highly cationic peptide that binds to either heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) to form a stable ion pair, which does not have anticoagulant activity. The ionic complex is then removed and broken down by the reticuloendothelial system. In large doses, protamine sulfate may also have an independent ‚Äî however weak ‚Äî anticoagulant effect. History Protamine was originally isolated from the sperm of salmon, but is now mostly made by recombinant biotechnology.

Its former leader Bill Skate served as Prime Minister from 1997 to 1999 and as speaker of Parliament from 2002 to 2004. Skate died in 2006 and the party is now led by Peter O'Neill. PNC originated from the National Capital District where former leader (late Bill Skate) was the Governor of NCD and the Parliamentary Member. The party had 22 members in the 111-seat National Parliament of Papua New Guinea as of September 2019. History The party was founded in 1993. It merged with the Christian Country Party and a number of smaller parties in April 1998 to form the PNG First Party, but split in June 1999 into a revived People's National Congress and a revived National Party. At the National General elections of 2002, the party won 2 of 109 seats. At the 2007 election, the party won 4 seats. It became a member of the coalition government led by Michael Somare's National Alliance, and received two cabinet positions. Following that on August 2, 2011, nine years after holding the position of Prime Minister, the National Alliance coalition government led by Michael Somare was superseded by the PNC Party led Peter O'Neill coalition alongside PNG Party Leader Belden Namah, and Parliament Speaker Jeffery Nape, who was responsible for determining that the office of the Prime Minister was vacant in the Papua New Guinean Constitutional Crisis. Peter O'Neill was thereafter elected Prime Minister, resulting in a political impasse between the O'Neill-Namah led coalition majority and the Somare led-minority. The nation underwent a number of difficulties and court action was brought forward against the two political groups. The police force and defence force were divided, and there was the possibility of a possible military coup and mutiny, followed by a police mutiny and public demonstrations funded by the various interest parties. The party fared well in the National General Elections of 2012 with Leader Peter O'Neill and Deputy Leader Job Pomat, led by with its free education and free health policy platform winning 27 seats nationally. In the 9th Parliament the party holds 12 Ministries, as well as the Deputy Speaker position and the Prime Ministership. Deputy Leader Job Pomat lost his seat of Manus Open to Ronny Knight, and was subsequently replaced as Deputy Party Leader by Mao Zeming of Tewa Siassi Open. In the 9th Parliament the party did not assume its relations with the PNG Party led by Belden Namah and was forced to consolidate its numbers with its political rivals including the National Alliance led by Michael Somare, the Peoples Progress Party led by former Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan and the People's Democratic Movement led by former Prime Minister Paias Wingti.

They may allow for denser packaging of DNA in the spermatozoon than histones, but they must be decompressed before the genetic data can be used for protein synthesis. However, in humans and maybe other primates, 10-15% of the sperm's genome is packaged by histones thought to bind genes that are essential for early embryonic development. Protamine and protamine-like (PL) proteins are among the sperm specific nuclear basic proteins (SNBPs). The PL proteins are intermediate in structure between protamine and Histone H1, the C-terminal of which being the precursor of vertebrate protamine.  Spermatogenesis  Alterations to the epigenome post-fertilization. The upper part of the image shows replacement of protamines with histones in paternal pronucleus shortly after fertilization. DNA packaged with protamines forms toroid-shaped structures, shown at the top left corner of the image. During the formation of sperm, protamine binds to the phosphate backbone of DNA using the arginine- rich domain as an anchor. DNA is then folded into a toroid, an O-shaped structure, although the mechanism is not known. A sperm cell can contain up to 50,000 toroid-shaped structures in its nucleus with each toroid containing about 50 kilobases. Before the toroid is formed, histones are removed from the DNA by transition nuclear proteins, so that protamine can condense it. The effects of this change are 1) an increase in sperm hydrodynamics for better flow through liquids by reducing the head size 2) decrease in the occurrence of DNA damage 3) removal of the epigenetic markers that occur with histone modifications. The structure of the sperm head is also related to protamine levels. The ratio of protamine 2 to protamine 1 and transition nuclear proteins has been found to change the sperm head shape in various species of mice, by altering the expression of protamine 2 via mutations in its promoter region. A decrease in the ratio has been found to increase the competitive ability of sperm in Mus species. However, further testing is required to determine how this ratio influences the shape of the head and whether monogamy influences this selection. In humans, studies show that men who have unbalanced Prm1/Prm2 are subfertile or infertile. Protamine 2 is encoded as a longer protein that needs its N-terminal cleaved before becoming functional. Human and chimp protamine has undergone rapid evolution.  Medical uses  When mixed with insulin, protamines slow down the onset and increase the duration of insulin action (see NPH insulin). Protamine is used in cardiac surgery, vascular surgery, and interventional radiology procedures to neutralize the anti-clotting effects of heparin. Adverse effects include increased pulmonary artery pressure and decrease peripheral blood pressure, myocardial oxygen consumption, cardiac output, and heart rate. Protamine sulfate is an antidote for heparin overdose, but severe allergy may occur. A chain shortened version of protamine also acts as a potent heparin antagonist, but with markedly reduced antigenicity. It was initially produced as a mixture made by thermolysin digestion of protamine, but the actual effective peptide portion \`VSRRRRRRGGRRRR\` has since been isolated. An analogue of this peptide has also been produced. In gene therapy, protamine sulfate's ability to condense plasmid DNA along with its approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have made it an appealing candidate to increase transduction rates by both viral and nonviral (e.g. utilizing cationic liposomes) mediated delivery mechanisms. Protamine may be used as a drug to prevent obesity. Protamine has been shown to deter increases in body weight and low-density lipoprotein in high-fat diet rats. This effect occurs through the inhibition of lipase activity, an enzyme responsible for triacylglycerol digestion and absorption, resulting in a decrease in the absorption of dietary fat. No liver damage was found when the rats were treated with protamine. However, emulsification of long-chain fatty acids for digestion and absorption in the small intestine is less constant in humans than rats, which will vary the effectiveness of protamine as a drug. Furthermore, human peptidases may degrade protamine at different rates, thus further tests are required to determine protamine‚Äôs ability to prevent obesity in humans.  Species distribution and isoforms  Mice, humans and certain fish have two or more different protamines, whereas the sperm of bull and boar, have one form of protamine due to a mutation in the PRM2 gene. In the rat, although the gene for PRM2 is present, expression of this protein is extremely small because of limited transcription due to an inefficient promoter in addition to altered processing of the mRNA transcript. = Human = The 2 human protamines are denoted PRM1 and PRM2. = Fish = Examples of protamines from fish are: *salmine from salmon *clupeine from herring sperm (Clupea) *iridine from rainbow trout *thinnine from tunafish (Thunnus) *stelline from starry sturgeon (Acipenser stellatus) *scylliorhinine from dogfish (Scylliorhinus)  Structure  The primary structure of protamine P1, the protamine used for packaging DNA in sperm cells, in placental mammals is usually 49 or 50 amino acids long. This sequence is divided into three separate domains: an arginine- rich domain for DNA binding flanked by shorter peptide sequences containing mostly cysteine residues. The arginine-rich domain consists of 3-11 arginine residues and is conserved between fish protamine and mammalian protamine 1 sequences at about 60-80% sequence identity. After translation, the protamine P1 structure is immediately phosphorylated at all three of the above-mentioned domains. Another round of phosphorylation occurs when the sperm enters the egg, but the function of these phosphorylations is uncertain. When protamine P1 binds to DNA, cysteine from the amino terminal of one protamine P1 forms disulfide bonds with the cysteine from the carboxy-terminal of another protamine P1. The disulfide bonds function to prevent the dissociation of protamine P1 from DNA until the bonds are reduced when the sperm enters the egg. The secondary and tertiary structure of protamine is not known with certainty, but several proposals have been published.

It was launched in March 2002, in advance of the 2002 election. Headed by Peter Namus, it sought to \\"correct the imbalance in the distribution of funds and resources\\" between rural and urban areas, arguing that it was unfair that so much development was concentrated in urban areas when both the bulk of people and resources were in rural areas. The party also pledged to start electoral development authorities and cooperative societies to assist in small and medium business development. By May, Menyamya MP Thomas Pelika had signed up to lead the party into the election. The party won two seats at the election: Fabian Inne in Goilala Open and Martin Tabi in North Fly Open. Both MPs later crossed to other parties, and little was heard of the party again.

He co-founded the Midland Group with Eduard Shifrin.  Early life  Shnaider moved with his family to Israel when he was 4, and then to Canada when he was 13. He graduated from York University in Toronto in 1991 with a bachelor's degree in economics.  Midland Group  In 1994, Shnaider co-founded Midland Group‚Äîoriginally a steel producer‚Äîwith former business partner Eduard Shifrin. The company operated in Ukraine before government-owned steel factories were privatized. In 1999, Midland Resources began buying shares in the Zaporizhstal steel mill. By 2001, Shnaider's consortium had bought 93 percent of the mill for $70 million. According to the Panama Papers, in 2010, Shnaider sold at least half of Midland's ownership in Zaporizhstal to buyers financed by Russian state-owned Vnesheconombank, who were then themselves acquired by the development bank.  Sports investments  Shnaider bought Jordan Grand Prix from Eddie Jordan in February 2005 for approximately US$50 million, and renamed it Midland F1 Racing for the 2006 Formula One season. On 9 September 2006, the team was sold to Spyker Cars. In December 2007, Shnaider bought Israeli soccer team Maccabi Tel Aviv for an estimated 12 million euros. On 4 August 2009, Shnaider sold the club to Canadian property developer Mitchell Goldhar, after investing $20 million in the club. Goldhar took on Shnaider's 80 per cent stake in the club by agreeing to take on its financial commitments; he also paid $750,000 to the Maccabi Tel Aviv sports foundation for its 20 percent stake.  Real estate  Shnaider partnered with Donald Trump in the construction of the Trump International Hotel and Tower, which is in Toronto. Trump was a minority shareholder in the project, and his firm owned the property management contract (the minority share and management contract were bought out in 2017, with the property renamed the Adelaide Hotel Toronto). In 2007, Shnaider was reported as having decided to keep the penthouse suite for himself, at an estimated value of $20 million. In 2017, the building and Shnaider were named as key links in a financial connection between Trump and the Russian government. Shnaider reportedly used proceeds from the sale of his Ukrainian steel mill to partially meet cost overruns at the Toronto Trump Tower. In March 2010, Shnaider invested in a property consortium that bought Toronto's King Edward Hotel for $50 million. The asset was purchased in a distressed sale from Lehman Brothers. Shnaider originally invested alongside three other real estate companies, Skyline International Development Inc., Dundee KE Inc., and Serruya Realty Group Inc. However, on 1 August 2012, Omni Hotels & Resorts CEO James D. Caldwell also took a stake in the hotel; and on 24 November 2015, Omni Hotels and Resorts announced that it had bought the other parties out and fully owned the hotel. In 2011, Shnaider formed a Delton Retail fund, a property group, with N3 Real Estate, owned by Dutch businessman A.D.G van Dam. On 30 December 2015, Shnaider invested NIS‚Ç™39 million in Mishorim Development Ltd., a real estate company controlled by developer Gil Blutrich. Shnaider had already invested alongside Blutrich in the King Edward Hotel, which Blutrich invested in via Skyline International Development Inc., a Mishorim subsidiary. On July 2016, he increased his holdings in this company from 21% to 42%. He is currently the sole holder of controlling interest when the Israeli court ruled in favor of him in August 2020, in a legal lawsuit filed by his past partner Gil Blutrich.  Personal life  Shnaider is married to Simona Shnaider (n√©e Birshtein). They have three daughters. In August 2016, they sold their home in Bridle Path, Toronto, for $22 million. Schnaider is President of the Jewish Russian Community Centre of Ontario.

It is hosted by Leo Laporte and many other former TechTV employees and currently produced by Karsten Bondy. It features round-table discussions and debates surrounding current technology news and reviews, with a particular focus on consumer electronics and the Internet. TWiT is produced in the TWiT \\"eastside\\" studios in Petaluma, California, United States, since 2016, a few miles away from the former \\"brickhouse\\" studios where it had been produced for 5 years, and earlier TWiT \\"cottage\\", where it was produced for over 6 years. The podcast is streamed live on Sundays at 2:15 P.M. PST. Format Leo Laporte typically begins an episode of TWiT by stating the show's number, title, sponsors and playing the theme tune, then introducing the week's panelists and guests. The persons hail in either live or remotely and take turns discussing their recent projects or work. The main portion of the show consists of a round-table discussion and debate, pegged loosely to a selection of the week's major technology headlines. The format of the show encourages spontaneity and the conversation often diverges wildly from technology topics. This causes the length of each episode to vary, sometimes considerably, from show to show, although most episodes run approximately two hours. Each episode typically features three or four commercial breaks, usually in the form of a \\"live read\\" from Laporte that may include interaction with the panelists (e.g., Laporte usually prompts guests for recommended audiobooks during spots for frequent advertiser Audible.com). The show closes with each panelist giving a personal \\"plug\\" for their affiliated website or Twitter account. Panelists The most frequently recurring guests on TWiT include John C. Dvorak, Patrick Norton, Wil Harris, Kevin Rose, Robert Heron, David Prager, Tom Merritt, Roger Chang, Dwight Silverman and Jason Calacanis. Other guests include Becky Worley, Steve Gibson, Xeni Jardin, Alex Lindsay, Owen Stone, Veronica Belmont and Molly Wood. The show has had a number of famous guests, including Steve Wozniak, Kevin Mitnick, John Hodgman, Lawrence Lessig, artist Roger McGuinn, as well as Star Trek: The Next Generation cast members LeVar Burton (Geordi La Forge) and Wil Wheaton (Wesley Crusher). In September 2015, Leo Laporte famously \\"banned\\" his long-time friend and frequent TWiT guest John C. Dvorak from the show for various comments Dvorak made on Twitter. In reply to Dvorak's comments that Laporte was biased, Laporte told Dvorak \\"you won't ever have to worry about it again\\", insinuating that he never wanted Dvorak back on TWiT. Laporte apologized a few days later, but continued to berate Dvorak publicly. Dvorak returned to TWiT on December 23, 2018.https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-tech/episodes/698?autostart=false History The program began when Laporte recorded a one-off round-table discussion between himself, Patrick Norton, Sarah Norton, Kevin Rose, David Prager, and Roger Chang at the 2005 Macworld Expo in San Francisco. After publishing the show on his blog to an enthusiastic public reception, Laporte decided to rename this discussion \\"episode 0\\" and turned the round-table concept into a weekly downloadable audio file, or \\"podcast,\\" featuring more cast members from his former TechTV program The Screen Savers. The first episode was posted on Monday, April 18, 2005 as Revenge of the Screen Savers, but it was temporarily renamed \\"Return of the [BEEP]\\" and shortly thereafter changed in response to a cease and desist letter sent to Laporte from Comcast, owners of TechTV's intellectual property rights, arguing it too closely resembled the defunct show's name. (TWiT started using the Screen Savers trademark after Comcast allowed it to expire, and The New Screen Savers was launched as a separate weekly program on May 2, 2015.) In episode 2, Laporte announced a contest in which listeners could suggest a new name for the show. One listener suggested This Week in Geek, which inspired Laporte to create the eventual name, This Week in Tech, or TWiT. The weekly show was originally recorded with all of the hosts staying at their respective homes and talking via Voice over IP (mostly using Skype). Starting around episode 10, Norton began physically coming to Leo's Petaluma office during the taping. Upon Rose's announcement that he was moving to San Francisco, Laporte started to gather the panelists for public live tapings in the San Francisco area, with most episodes being videotaped and released as a video podcast download. During the fall of 2005, several of the previously regular hosts began to move on to other projects, resulting in the format of the show changing from being a show with a core group of hosts and occasional guests, into Laporte being the only regular host, and inviting in a variety of different guests each show. Around the same time, the people responsible for filming the shows, the Pixel Corps and their leader, Alex Lindsay became more involved with the show, with many also contributing. During the first few years TWiT episodes were made available in a variety of file formats for individual download or RSS subscription. These included a standard 64 kbit/s MP3, a low-bandwidth 16 kbit/s MP3, Advanced Audio Coding (AAC), and open source Ogg Vorbis. However, the Ogg Vorbis version of the show ceased to be offered in August 2009 with the AAC and low bandwidth MP3 versions ending in early November 2009. In response, Leo Laporte stated that he was a believer that his content should be made available to the widest audience possible in the format of their choice, as well as philosophically agreeing with the open source nature of Ogg Vorbis. However the time and effort the TWiT Staff needed to encode, upload, and distribute alternate audio formats in the limited time between recording and release each Sunday evening was not justified by the number of people choosing to listen to them. The show recording is usually posted every Sunday evening. Awards TWiT has won two Podcast Awards, as both the \\"People's Choice\\" and as \\"Best Technology Podcast\\". This Week in Tech also made Time Magazine's Top 10 Podcasts of 2006, ranked 9th. It also won Podcast of the Year from the 2007 Weblog Awards.Best Podcast - The 2007 Weblog Awards Video TWiT began as an audio podcast, although several video episodes were filmed in the first few years of the show. Starting in 2008, the show was made available for live streaming in both audio and video formats. Since episode 215 in October 2009, the show has been available weekly as both an audio and video download as well as on YouTube. Distribution and licensing All episodes are licensed under the Creative Commons attribution share-alike noncommercial license, and are distributed via direct download from the TWiT.tv website, from Apple's iTunes Store, or as a subscription on any device with the necessary internet connection and podcasting software. There is no charge to download current or past shows. The show is typically available in three formats: 64 kbit/s MP3, 32 kbit/s MP3, and 64 kbit/s AAC. Occasionally, other bitrates are used for episodes produced in stereo, however most episodes are monaural. The files are available as direct downloads, with bandwidth provided by Cachefly. On 23 February 2014, before recording TWiT 446, Laporte stated that episode bandwidth for the entire network is around 950 terabytes per month. A sponsorship deal with America Online was announced on July 4, 2005, following the server demand that resulted from the release of iTunes 4.9's built-in podcasting directory. Since the new TWiT website was launched, the TWiT Torrent server initially preferred by Laporte has ceased operation. In several episodes, Laporte has noted that the distributed nature of BitTorrent makes it impossible to accurately gauge the popularity of the show, decreasing the likelihood of attracting advertisers. As of episode 174, TWiT began being hosted from AOL Radio. AOL hosting ended in the summer of 2013. Funding Laporte stated in episode 3 that the show would always remain free and without advertising. However, due to ongoing costs as a result of TWiT.tv's constant expansion, a roadmap for the introduction of podcast and web-based advertising was announced during episode 45 of This WEEK in TECH. On 5 September 2006, TWiT.tv officially became one of the first major advertising-supported podcast networks, sponsored initially by both Visa and Dell. Listeners have always been invited to support the network by means of an automatic PayPal subscription or one-time payment. In the past, this granted access to an exclusive TWiT forum which no longer exists, yet donations are still accepted. Listener funding has been used for the operational costs of the network including improvements to Laporte's recording studio and to purchase radio- quality microphones and digital audio-recording devices for the hosts. Financial compensation for the network mostly comes from the network's sponsors. Sponsors of the network include Ford, Audible, Lantronix, Squarespace, Hulu, Rackspace, Hover, Carbonite, Stamps.com and more. Before recording started for This Week in Tech 268 on 3 October 2010, while discussing the sale of TechCrunch to AOL, Laporte mentioned that his network would \\"do three to four [million ]\\" in advertising revenue for 2010.Justin.tv video broadcast, TWiT Live, 15:01 PDT Sunday 3 October 2010 Based on the increase in the number of sponsored programs as well as the increase in sponsors, the 2013 gross revenue is estimated to be in the eight million dollar range. This Week in Tech Episode 561 on 5/08/2016 had extensive talk about podcast revenue. In the episode, Leo Laporte said a recent New York Times article stated that podcasts ad revenue was $57 million per year and \\"If that's true, than I actually own 25% of all of the podcasting revenue in the world.\\" This would put TWIT ad revenue around $13‚Äì14 million per year.https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-tech/episodes/561?autostart=false See alsoTWiT.tv Network References External links ‚Äì official site TWiT.tv podcasts Technology podcasts 2005 podcast debuts Creative Commons-licensed works ","title":"This Week in Tech"},{"id":"1831261","text":"Laney may refer to: *Laney (surname) *Laney, Georgia, U.S. *Laney, Wisconsin, U.S. *Emsley A.

Ngari (including former Guge kingdom) in the north-west was incorporated into √ú-Tsang. Geographically √ú-Tsang covered the south-central of the Tibetan cultural area, including the Brahmaputra River watershed. The western districts surrounding and extending past Mount Kailash are included in Ngari, and much of the vast Changtang plateau to the north. The Himalayas defined √ú-Tsang's southern border. The present Tibet Autonomous Region corresponds approximately to what was ancient √ú-Tsang and western Kham. √ú-Tsang was formed by the merging of two earlier power centers: √ú () in central Tibet, controlled by the Gelug lineage of Tibetan Buddhism under the early Dalai Lamas, and Tsang () which extended from Gyantse to points west, controlled by the rival Sakya lineage. Military victories by the powerful Khoshut Mongol G√ºshi Khan that backed 5th Dalai Lama and founded Ganden Phodrang government in 1642, consolidated power over the combined region, followed by the rule of the Qing Dynasty started in 1720 by the Qianlong Emperor that continued until the British expedition to Tibet (1903‚Äì1904). √ú-Tsang is the cultural heartland of the Tibetan people, originally governed by Rinpungpa dynasty. The Tsangpa dynasty had ruled the Tsang part between 1565 and 1642. The dispute between Tsang kings, Karma Tenkyong Wangpo followers of karmapa and Khoshut khans, G√ºshi Khan, follower of gelugpa and Dalai Lamas ended by the rule on Tibet from the Potala and Norbulingka palaces in Lhasa from the last one. Jokhang, perhaps the most holy temple in Tibetan Buddhism, is also located there. The Lhasa dialect is used as a lingua franca in √ú-Tsang and the Tibetan Exile koin√© language is also based largely on it. Front and Back Tibet Tsang, whose largest cities are Gyantse and Shigatse, near where the Panchen Lama has his traditional seat at Tashilhunpo Monastery, was designated on maps of the Qing dynasty as \\"Back Tibet\\", while √ú, where the Dalai Lama has his seat at Lhasa, was designated \\"Front Tibet\\". This division was an artificial construct of the Chinese and had no currency within Tibet where the Dalai Lama exercised effective rule over both Tsang and √ú. An attempt had been made in the 18th century during the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor to split Tibet by offering the Panchen Lama dominion over Tsang, but the expansive offer was declined, the Panchen Lama only accepting a small portion of the offered territory. Later attempts, during the period 1906‚Äì1913 and in 1950, by the Panchen Lama to resurrect a separate Back Tibet over which he would have dominion were rejected by the Chinese.

Park activities include hiking, swimming, camping, fishing, horseback riding, and golf. The park is managed by the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. History Oak Mountain was created when the State Land Act of 1927 granted the park the between Double Oak Mountain and Little Oak Ridge. From 1934 to 1941, the park saw improvements made by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and the Works Progress Administration. Remnants of the CCC era‚Äîfoundations, bridges and other infrastructure, often made of stone quarried from within the park‚Äîcan be seen throughout the park. In 1943, the National Park Service (NPS) deeded the state park approximately of surrounding land that the NPS had acquired in the 1930s. Further improvements beginning in 1971 saw development of the golf course, pro shop, cottages, administrative buildings, demonstration farm and campgrounds in the area of Dry Brook basin and adjacent to the park's lakes.  Awards  In September 2020, Oak Mountain State Park was one of eleven Alabama State Parks awarded Tripadvisor‚Äôs Traveler‚Äôs Choice Award, which recognizes businesses and attractions that earn consistently high user reviews.

The college was founded by the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in 1957, and was named after the first American naturalized citizen saint, Mother Frances Cabrini. It was one of the first universities in the United States to make community service a graduation requirement for all undergraduates; it now has a core curriculum centered on social justice which includes their signature classes, Engagements in the Common Good, also known as ECG. History =Pre-History= The site of the original Cabrini College was originally the estate of Dr. John T. Dorrance, inventor of the process of making condensed soup and president of the Campbell Soup Company. It was known as Woodcrest. Dorrance owned a stable with many horses, had social events within the main hall of his mansion, and also had personal servants. The property was purchased by the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus (MSC) in 1953. It was first named \\"Villa Cabrini\\" after the organization's namesake, Saint Frances Xavier Cabrini. At first, Villa Cabrini was an orphanage. Note: This includes =Founding and growth= In 1957, Sister Ursula Infante established a school in the villa. Upon opening, it was a female-only school of only thirty-seven students. The orphanage was still a part of the community and they shared the use of the buildings. The first graduating class was in 1961. Also around this same time period, Cabrini was awarded full accreditation by the Middle States Association. In the 1950s, Cabrini was only made up of a few buildings. The mansion of the college was the central point of the college, housing the students, providing a cafeteria, classrooms, library, and a chapel. In 1958, they converted the stable house, now known as Grace Hall, to include both classrooms and dormitories. In 1960, Cabrini finished construction on the Sacred Heart Hall (now known as Founder's Hall), which was a library, cafeteria, gymnasium, and even held science laboratories. The 1960s also saw the construction of a chapel in 1961 and a library in 1965. =Late 1960s and early 70s= The early 1970s were a time of much change for the college. After Infante's ten-year presidency in 1967, three presidents were to follow in only three years. Sister Barbara Leonardo was president from 1967‚Äì68. During her time at the college, she was also a dean and taught history. In 1968, Sr. Gervase Lapadula became president, but soon had to resign due to health problems. From 1969‚Äì73, Sr. Regina Casey was president of Cabrini College. During her presidency, the college was starting to change from a girls-only to a co-educational establishment. Through a program with Eastern University, located next to the college, males started to attend classes at Cabrini. In turn, Cabrini students were offered more courses through both expansion and external courses at Eastern. =Sr. Mary Louise Sullivan: 1972‚Äì82= Even more changes took place between 1972 and 1982. Most importantly, the school became completely coeducational. = Sr. Eileen Currie, MSC '66: 1982‚Äì92 = During Sister Eileen's presidency, political science, social work, and computer science programs were added and Xavier Hall, a 124-student residence hall, was built. The faculty voted to make community service a requirement for all students, and Cabrini was recognized as one of the first colleges in the country, and the first in Pennsylvania, to integrate community service into the core curriculum. = Antoinette \\"Toni\\" Iadarola, Ph.D.: 1992‚Äì2008 = Toni Iadarola was the first lay president of Cabrini College. During her tenure, undergraduate enrollment increased from 732 to 1,700 and the number of resident students tripled. New and renovated buildings in this time included the Dixon Center, Founder's Hall, and the Center for Science, Education, and Technology (now the Antoinette Iadarola Center for Science, Education, and Technology). =Marie Angelella George: 2008‚Äì2013= Cabrini College garnered national attention when, in the midst of a national economic recession, it announced a tuition reduction of nearly 13%. = Donald B. Taylor: 2014‚Äì = Dr. Don Taylor became Cabrini College's first male President on July 1, 2014. During his inaugural address on October 25, 2014, Dr. Taylor introduced the Cabrini 2020 Roadmap to Growth. This plan is a means to measure the college's progress, as the following are promised to have occurred by 2020. The initiative promises to have 100 percent of undergraduate students participating in a Living & Learning Community, pledges all undergraduate students will experience two or more High-Impact Coeducational Practices in their first year and denotes a commitment to ensuring all students encounter at least four of these High-Impact practices before they are graduated by the college. Under Taylor's leadership, Cabrini College changed its name to Cabrini University on July 1, 2016. Academics =Programs= Cabrini University offers 40 undergraduate majors, additional minors, and specialized tracks. The institutional also offers part-time graduate degrees in Accounting, Biological Sciences, Data Science, Education, and Leadership. In 2016, it started two new part-time doctoral programs for working professionals: EdD in Educational Leadership and PhD in Organizational Development. =The core curriculum: Justice Matters= All undergraduate students participate in the university's core curriculum, Justice Matters, in which, the university asserts, \\"students learn skills that will advance their careers and that can be used for the benefit of their communities, linking theory to practice in the world, preparing them for professional careers through a rigorous liberal learning experience.\\" The curriculum drives to raise awareness of social problems, involve students hands-on in social justice issues, to teach students to see themselves as participating in value- driven decision making, and to develop liberally educated persons. =Community service requirement= Cabrini University was one of the first universities in the United States to make community service a graduation requirement for all undergraduates. =Rankings= Cabrini is ranked 122nd in the Regional Universities (North) category by US News & World Report for 2018.

It merged with Sakura Bank on April 1, 2001 to form Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation. History Sumitomo Bank was established as a private enterprise in November 1895 and reorganized as a limited company with 15 million yen of capital in March 1912. It opened numerous overseas branches during the World War I era as the Sumitomo zaibatsu business globalized. After World War II, the Sumitomo group was dismantled and its constituent companies were forbidden from using the Sumitomo name. The bank renamed itself Osaka Bank in October 1948. In December 1952, its name was changed back to Sumitomo Bank. Sumitomo was the main bank for several major Japanese manufacturers during the early postwar era, including NEC and Panasonic (Matsushita). In the 1970s, it lost nearly $1 billion in the restructuring of Osaka-based general trading company Ataka & Co., which, combined with the contemporaneous bailout of Mazda, had a major impact on Sumitomo's finances, driving it down from the most profitable bank in Japan to being only ninth-ranked. However, the Ataka and Mazda bailouts enhanced Sumitomo's industry reputation by showing its dedication to customers. It became the largest Japanese bank by deposits until the merger of Dai-Ichi Bank and Nippon Kangyo Bank to form Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank. In 1986, Sumitomo merged with Heiwa Sogo Bank in order to expand its presence in the Tokyo area. In the same year, it acquired 12.5% of Goldman Sachs. Sumitomo incurred major losses during the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble in the 1990s. In 1993 it wrote off 100 billion yen in bad loans, and in 1994 its Nagoya branch manager was murdered in possible connection with a bad debt collection. In 1995, it posted the first net loss of a major Japanese bank in the postwar era. It sold Sumitomo Bank of California, the sixth-largest bank in California, at a steep discount to Zions Bancorporation in 1998 (SBC is now part of California Bank and Trust). In 1999, amid intensifying competition as other Japanese and foreign banks consolidated, Sumitomo announced its merger with Sakura Bank to form Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation. The merger was approved in June 2000 and combined Sakura's strong retail operation and eastern Japan presence with Sumitomo's strong wholesale operation and western Japan presence. The merger created the world's third-largest banking group at the time, after Deutsche Bank and the pending merger that would form Mizuho Bank.

Fynn recounts his time spent with Anna, and gives a very personal account of her outpourings on life, mathematics, science and her mentor, Mister God. The sequels of Mister God, This Is Anna are Anna's Book (1986) and Anna and the Black Knight (1990). The book was reissued by HarperCollins in 2005 with a Foreword by Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury.London: HarperCollins; ; available online at http://browseinside.harpercollins.com.au/index.aspx?isbn13=9780007202027, pp.1‚Äì4 HarperCollins. Background The story begins on the streets of the East End of London in the mid-1930s. While roaming the docks at night, the author comes across a small girl sitting on the grating below a shop window. He sits down next to her, and engages her in conversation. Unable to find out where she came from, Fynn takes the child home, only to discover she is an abused runaway. She spends her next three years as Fynn's inseparable companion. The book gives an account of their friendship. Anna by nature is the inquisitor, the forever probing creature who likes to find a reason for everything. Fynn, a student, tries to follow her hard-to-understand, yet simple logic. Philosophical questions are investigated through the eyes of a child, who proposes simple, common-sense solutions. Many of the conversations involve religion, with Anna personalising God, calling him \\"Mister God\\". \\"At five years Anna knew absolutely the purpose of being, knew the meaning of love and was a personal friend and helper of Mister God. At six Anna was a theologian, mathematician, philosopher, poet and gardener. If you asked her a question you would always get an answer ‚Äì in due course. On some occasions the answer would be delayed for weeks or months; but eventually, in her own good time, the answer would come: direct, simple and much to the point.\\"Fynn (2000) Mister God, This Is Anna Random House Publishing Group p1 Anna is involved with everything. The gist of the book is the philosophy of a child who has the wisdom to comprehend more than what would be expected of her. The ending of the book describes Anna's death at age seven after falling from a tree and Fynn's profound grief. \\"She never made eight years, she died by an accident. She died with a grin on her beautiful face. She died saying, 'I bet Mister God lets me get into heaven for this'.\\"Fynn (2000) Mister God, This Is Anna Random House Publishing Group p2 Fynn experiences a period of angst, blaming God, but when he visits Anna's grave and sees it to be a riot of flowers, he lets go of his anger against God. The answer, he realizes, is \\"Anna is in my middle\\". This particular reference is to a conversation between Anna and Fynn. God is part of everybody and everybody is part of God. Fynn walks away from her graveyard with renewed hope. The sequels to Mister God, This Is Anna are Anna's Book (1986) and Anna and the Black Knight (1990). Author Hopkins, as a teenager and young adult, lived in the East End of London in the early 1930s. He was briefly drawn towards the politics of Oswald Mosley, but soon became disillusioned.

In his preface to both the British and American editions of the book, Vernon Sproxton remarks that he has seen Anna's drawings and notes and that he believes her to be real. There is some uncertainty about Fynn's age on first encountering Anna. Early editions of the book say he was nineteen, but this would be impossible if he was to know Anna for three years before the outbreak of war, and in the latest editions of Mister God, This Is Anna his age has been amended to sixteen.Fynn (2000) Mister God, This Is Anna Random House Publishing Group P9 SourcesMr Lyward's Answer by Michael Burn (Hamish Hamilton, 1956) *George Lyward ‚Äì His Autobiography by John Lyward (Lulu, 2008) References External linksThe Real Fynn  The background story of Sydney George Hopkins ‚Äì author of 'Mister God, This Is Anna' 1974 children's books Works published under a pseudonym ","title":"Mister God, This Is Anna"},{"id":"1831432","text":"Ronald George Van Horne (October 24, 1932 ‚Äì November 2, 2017) was a politician in Ontario, Canada.

Biography Mullany was the son of Colonel James R. Mullany and Maria Burger. Colonel Mullany, born in Ireland, had served in the War of 1812, and was Quartermaster General of the United States Army from 1816 until 1818. His son, James Robert Madison Mullany, was born in New York City, and entered the navy as a midshipman on 7 January 1832. He was promoted to passed midshipman on 23 June 1838, and to lieutenant on 29 February 1844. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War he took part in the capture of the city of Tabasco, Mexico, in June 1847. From January till March 1861, he served on the sailing frigate in the protection of Fort Pickens on Santa Rosa Island, Florida, and in April and May of that year, in command of the steam gunboat defended the fort from attacks from the Confederate Army, assisting in reinforcing the fort on 12 April 1861. Mullany was promoted to commander on 18 October 1861, and assigned to the side-wheel steamer in the North Atlantic and West Gulf Blockading Squadrons in April 1862. From April till September 1863, he commanded a division of the West Gulf Squadron, and during the war captured eleven blockade-runners, and cut out two schooners laden with cotton in the harbor of Galveston, Texas. In August 1864 Mullany commanded the screw sloop during the Battle of Mobile Bay, the Bienville being considered unfit to engage the forts by Admiral David Farragut. The Oneida, lashed to the ironclad screw steamer was in the rear of the line of battle, and exposed to a very destructive fire from Fort Morgan. Later the Oneida was attacked and raked by the Confederate ram , and Mullany received several wounds, necessitating the amputation of his left arm. From May 1865 until May 1868, Mullany was inspector in charge of ordnance in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. He was promoted to captain in 1866, and was one of the Board of Visitors to the Naval Academy in 1868. He commanded the steam sloop in the European Squadron from December 1868 until November 1871. He was commissioned as commodore on 15 August 1870, and was in charge of the Mediterranean Squadron from October 1870 until November 1871, and of the Philadelphia Navy Yard in 1872-74. After receiving his rear admiral's commission on 5 June 1874, he commanded the North Atlantic Squadron until February 1876, protecting American interests on the Isthmus of Panama. He served as the Governor of the Philadelphia Naval Asylum from 1876 until 1879, when he retired from active service. Mullany died in Bryn Mawr, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, on 17 September 1887.

Olin Foundation was a conservative American grant-making foundation established in 1953 by John M. Olin, president of the Olin Industries chemical and munitions manufacturing businesses. Unlike most other foundations, it was charged to spend all of its assets within a generation of Olin's death, for fear of mission drift over time and to preserve donor intent. It made its last grant in the summer of 2005 and officially disbanded on November 29, 2005. It had disbursed over $370 million in funding, primarily to conservative think tanks, media outlets, and law programs at influential universities. It is most notable for its early support and funding of the law and economics movement and the Federalist Society. \\"All in all, the Federalist Society has been one of the best investments the foundation ever made,\\" wrote the Foundation to its trustees in 2003.  Mission statement  According to the official website, \\"the general purpose of the John M. Olin Foundation is to provide support for projects that reflect or are intended to strengthen the economic, political and cultural institutions upon which the American heritage of constitutional government and private enterprise is based. The Foundation also seeks to promote a general understanding of these institutions by encouraging the thoughtful study of the connections between economic and political freedoms, and the cultural heritage that sustains them.\\"Jmof.org  History  The fund was largely inactive until 1969, when John M. Olin was disturbed by the Willard Straight Hall takeover at his alma mater, Cornell University. At the age of 80, he decided that he must pour his time and resources into preserving the free market system. The Foundation is most notable for its early support and funding of the law and economics movement, a discipline that applies incentive-based thinking and cost-benefit analysis to the field of legal theory. Olin believed that law schools have a disproportionately large impact on society given their size and to this end decided to focus the majority of his funding there. The executive director of the Foundation in its early years was conservative activist Michael S. Joyce, who left to head the similar Bradley Foundation. William E. Simon, a leverage buyout pioneer who was United States Secretary of the Treasury under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, was president of the Foundation from 1977 until his death in 2000. He frequently discussed the foundation's commitment to supporting the \\"counter-intelligentsia\\". Conservative scholar James Piereson was the last executive director and secretary. The foundation supported conservative thinkers such as Heather Mac Donald of the Manhattan Institute; Mac Donald is the John M. Olin Fellow at this New York City-based institution. In 2005, following longstanding plans, the foundation announced its final grants and closed its doors. The foundation closed in the same year as the Franklin W. Olin Foundation, which was established by John Olin's father, Franklin W. Olin. The Franklin W. Olin Foundation also shut down for donor intent reasons, but the two foundations were entirely independent and unrelated, except for the family connection of their founders. According to the Philanthropy Roundtable, the Olin Foundation \\"dispensed hundreds of millions of dollars to scholars, think tanks, publications, and other organizations\\" and \\"shaped the direction and aided the growth of the modern conservative movement that first sprang into visibility in the 1980s.\\" According to the New York Observer, the Foundation distributed \\"grants to conservative think tanks and intellectuals-the architects of today‚Äôs sprawling right-wing movement-for a quarter-century.\\"  Notable persons  James Piereson ‚Äì past executive director and board member * Peter M.

The area is some of the oldest known human settlements in the new world, the last native population of which was the Chumash. The Spanish Portol√† expedition, the first European land explorers of California, traveled along its coast in 1769. It became part of the extensive Spanish land grant known as Rancho Nuestra Se√±ora del Refugio, operated by the family of Jos√© Francisco Ortega from 1794. The land was purchased by William Welles Hollister after the Civil War as part of a large acquisition, the center of which was at Glen Annie, Tecolotito canyon. It continues to be privately owned, and is one of the last remaining undeveloped coastal areas in Southern California. There have been conflicts over public access to coastal parts of the ranch for nearly 40 years. Beaches along the Ranch remain technically open to the public per California state law, but access is difficult because the ranch itself is protected private property. Date palms on Hollister's ranch circa 1885. Cattle ranching history A cattle ranch since the days of the Ortegas, Hollister Ranch is the fourth largest cattle ranch in Santa Barbara County having shipped over of beef in the summer of 2005. As a result of the Hollister Ranch Owners' Association CC&Rs;, Santa Barbara County zoning and California's Agricultural Preserve Program, when fully built out, over 98% of the property will continue to be devoted to cattle grazing. Other benefits to Hollister Ranch owners as a result of the cattle operation include a reduced fuel load in the event of range fire and the tax benefits that result from adherence to the restrictions imposed by the Uniform Rules of the Agricultural Preserve. Relative to the land prices for parcels in Hollister Ranch, however, the cattle ranching is probably uneconomic, and may continue largely for the sake of fuel load management for fire protection, Agricultural Preserve tax consequences and aesthetic considerations. Recreational use The Hollister family, previous owners of the property, allowed some recreational use of the area. In the late 1950s, they granted a pass to the regional Sportsman Hunting Club, which later split into several smaller clubs, including the Santa Barbara Surf Club. During over a decade of regular use, the Santa Barbara Surf Club discovered and named many surfing spots off the coast of 8 miles (13 km) of beach, such as Razor Blades, Drake's, Little Drake's, Utah, Rights and Lefts, St. Augustine, Lefts and Rights, and on the adjacent Bixby Ranch land, Cojo Point, Perko's Point, and Government Point. Recreational use of the beach and surrounding area is restricted to both the owners of the Hollister and Bixby Ranches, and the public, who access the area by foot along the beach and by boat in the offshore waters. For decades the boat launch at Gaviota Pier allowed unfettered access to all Californians and visitors to the state tidelands all the way up to Point Conception. The launch was disabled about five years ago. The restoration of the public access it provided, is currently held up by the California Coastal Commission. California law allows public access to all land below the mean high tide line, and many surfers, divers, and fisherman access the State waters by boating or walking in from Gaviota State Park on the east and Jalama County Park on the west. The area is generally called \\"The Ranch\\" by surfers, divers, and fishermen. Development and environmental concerns Many associated with the present Hollister Ranch describe themselves as responsible stewards of the land, ardently claiming to have worked out a successful formula balancing ecological preservation with residential development which functions within both a working commercial agricultural operation and a healthy natural habitat with a wide range of flora and fauna. The Hollister Ranch Association long term practice of a \\"formal beach driving program\\" has been described by the California Coastal Commission as ‚Äúdegrading [to] beach habitats and the natural coastline‚Äù and against the law. The ranch rules were amended to prohibit beach driving in 2018. The working cattle operation that has shipped as much as 1,000,000 pounds of beef in a good and rainy year has been criticized as primarily existing for tax-front purposes and as being subsidized by the owners. Regardless of the fact that cattle have continuously grazed at Hollister Ranch since the 1860s, some environmentalists note the potential impact such an operation could have on native flora and fauna. The ranch has also been criticized for precluding public access over private property to beaches, in alleged conflict with California state law. A sharp difference of opinion exists between Ranch owners, who describe the pristine nature of the Ranch after 45 years as an owners' association versus government officials and the public, some of whom view Ranch policies as exclusivist and disingenuous. In 2004, the National Park Service abandoned a proposal to designate parts of the Gaviota coastline, including the seashore in front of Hollister Ranch, as a national seashore. Local landowners, especially those in Hollister Ranch, mounted a lobbying campaign to oppose the study. In addition to others in Santa Barbara County who, after learning of the proposed designation, hired advocates to oppose the National Seashore, the Hollister Ranch Owners' Association assessed its members to hire a former congressman to lobby against the National Seashore proposal. Previous projects proposed since the 1970s have included oil development, a nuclear power plant and high-density housing. For over twenty years Santa Barbara-area grade school children have been encouraged to participate (at no cost to the schools) in the Hollister Ranch Conservancy's \\"Tidepool Classroom\\" that preserves intertidal life forms not found elsewhere along the coast.

It was formed in April 1990 as the Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank (MTKB) by the merger of Mitsui Bank (founded 1876) and Taiyo Kobe Bank (founded 1973). The Sakura Bank name was adopted in April 1992. History The TKB-Mitsui merger, agreed in 1989 during the height of the Japanese asset price bubble, was to create the second largest bank in the world behind Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank. While TKB had a large base of individual and small business customers, Mitsui had a complementary base of larger institutional clients. The merger was aimed at leveraging these synergies, as well as providing stronger competition against European banks, which were expected to consolidate following a deregulation in 1992. Sakura became a major corporate and retail bank in the Greater Tokyo Area during the 1990s and was the largest retail bank in Japan by several measures, including housing loan and investment trust sales. Sakura incurred massive bad loan write-offs in 1998 and approached one of its major corporate customers, Toyota, for financial support, which was rejected. Sakura led the consortium that established Japan Net Bank, an online bank, in 2000, and began talks with Sony to establish a second online banking operation in Japan. Sakura merged with The Sumitomo Bank on April 1, 2001, forming the Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation. The merger was approved in June 2000 and combined Sakura's strong retail operation and eastern Japan presence with Sumitomo's strong wholesale operation and western Japan presence. The merger created the world's third-largest banking group at the time, after Deutsche Bank and the pending merger that would form Mizuho Bank. Sakura Bank used the SWIFT code \\"MITKJPJT,\\" derived from the \\"Mitsui Taiyo Kobe\\" name.

The shower is visible from about April 19 to about May 28 each year with peak activity on or around May 5. Unlike most major annual meteor showers, there is no sharp peak for this shower, but rather a broad maximum with good rates that last approximately one week centered on May 5. The meteors we currently see as members of the Eta Aquariid shower separated from Halley's Comet hundreds of years ago. The current orbit of Halley's Comet does not pass close enough to the Earth to be a source of meteoric activity. Although this shower is not as spectacular as the Leonids may be and well below the rates of the Perseids or the Geminids, it is not an ordinary event. The Eta Aquariids get their name because their radiant appears to lie in the constellation Aquarius, near one of the constellation's brightest stars, Eta Aquarii. The shower peaks at about a rate of around a meteor per minute, although such rates are rarely seen from northern latitudes due to the low altitude of the radiant. The Eta Aquariids are best viewed in the pre-dawn hours away from the glow of city lights. For northern observers, the radiant of the shower is only above the horizon for the few hours before dawn, and early-rising observers are often rewarded with rates that climb as the radiant rises before sunrise. The shower is best viewed from the equator to 30 degrees south latitude. The activity is fairly constant from one return to the next. However, in 2013, the maximum ZHR exceeded the average level significantly for about two days. An explanation was presented by Mikiya Sato (Sato & Watanabe, 2013), showing that the meteoroids are from very old ejection from the parent 1P/Halley and are trapped probably in resonances to Jupiter's orbit (similar to the Orionids observed between 2007 and 2010). The peak ZHR reached 135 ¬± 16. Updated information on the expected time and rates of the shower is provided through the annual IMO Meteor Shower Calendar.

Switch statements function somewhat similarly to the \`if\` statement used in programming languages like C/C++, C#, Visual Basic .NET, Java and exists in most high-level imperative programming languages such as Pascal, Ada, C/C++, C#, Visual Basic .NET, Java, and in many other types of language, using such keywords as \`switch\`, \`case\`, \`select\` or \`inspect\`. Switch statements come in two main variants: a structured switch, as in Pascal, which takes exactly one branch, and an unstructured switch, as in C, which functions as a type of goto. The main reasons for using a switch include improving clarity, by reducing otherwise repetitive coding, and (if the heuristics permit) also offering the potential for faster execution through easier compiler optimization in many cases. { align=\\"right\\" +Switch statement in C  switch (age) { case 1: printf(\\"You're one.\\"); break; case 2: printf(\\"You're two.\\"); break; case 3: printf(\\"You're three.\\"); case 4: printf(\\"You're three or four.\\"); break; default: printf(\\"You're not 1,2,3 or 4!\\"); } }  History  In his 1952 text Introduction to Metamathematics, Stephen Kleene formally proved that the CASE function (the IF-THEN-ELSE function being its simplest form) is a primitive recursive function, where he defines the notion \`definition by cases\` in the following manner: :\\"#F. The function œÜ defined thus :: œÜ(x1 , ... , xn ) = :::*œÜ1(x1 , ... , xn ) if Q1(x1 , ... , xn ), :::* . . . . . . . . . . . . :::*œÜm(x1 , ... , xn ) if Qm(x1 , ... , xn ), :::*œÜm+1(x1 , ... , xn ) otherwise, :where Q1 , ... , Qm are mutually exclusive predicates (or œÜ(x1 , ... , xn) shall have the value given by the first clause which applies) is primitive recursive in œÜ1, ..., œÜm+1, Q1, ..., Qm+1.\\"Definition by cases\\", Kleene 1952:229 Kleene provides a proof of this in terms of the Boolean-like recursive functions \\"sign-of\\" sg( ) and \\"not sign of\\" ~sg( ) (Kleene 1952:222-223); the first returns 1 if its input is positive and ‚àí1 if its input is negative. Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey make the additional observation that \\"definition by cases\\" must be both mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. They too offer a proof of the primitive recursiveness of this function (Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey 2002:74-75). The IF-THEN-ELSE is the basis of the McCarthy formalism: its usage replaces both primitive recursion and the mu-operator.  Typical syntax  In most languages, programmers write a switch statement across many individual lines using one or two keywords. A typical syntax involves: * the first \`select\`, followed by an expression which is often referred to as the control expression or control variable of the switch statement * subsequent lines defining the actual cases (the values), with corresponding sequences of statements for execution when a match occurs * In languages with fallthrough behaviour, a \`break\` statement typically follows a \`case\` statement to end said statement. [Wells] Each alternative begins with the particular value, or list of values (see below), that the control variable may match and which will cause the control to goto the corresponding sequence of statements. The value (or list/range of values) is usually separated from the corresponding statement sequence by a colon or by an implication arrow. In many languages, every case must also be preceded by a keyword such as \`case\` or \`when\`. An optional default case is typically also allowed, specified by a \`default\`, \`otherwise\`, or \`else\` keyword. This executes when none of the other cases match the control expression. In some languages, such as C, if no case matches and the \`default\` is omitted the \`switch\` statement simply exits. In others, like PL/I, an error is raised.  Semantics  Semantically, there are two main forms of switch statements. The first form are structured switches, as in Pascal, where exactly one branch is taken, and the cases are treated as separate, exclusive blocks. This functions as a generalized if‚Äìthen‚Äìelse conditional, here with any number of branches, not just two. The second form are unstructured switches, as in C, where the cases are treated as labels within a single block, and the switch functions as a generalized goto. This distinction is referred to as the treatment of fallthrough, which is elaborated below. = Fallthrough = In many languages, only the matching block is executed, and then execution continues at the end of the switch statement. These include the Pascal family (Object Pascal, Modula, Oberon, Ada, etc.) as well as PL/I, modern forms of Fortran and BASIC dialects influenced by Pascal, most functional languages, and many others. To allow multiple values to execute the same code (and avoid needing to duplicate code), Pascal-type languages permit any number of values per case, given as a comma-separated list, as a range, or as a combination. Languages derived from C language, and more generally those influenced by Fortran's computed GOTO, instead feature fallthrough, where control moves to the matching case, and then execution continues (\\"falls through\\") to the statements associated with the next case in the source text. This also allows multiple values to match the same point without any special syntax: they are just listed with empty bodies. Values can be special conditioned with code in the case body. In practice, fallthrough is usually prevented with a \`break\` keyword at the end of the matching body, which exits execution of the switch block, but this can cause bugs due to unintentional fallthrough if the programmer forgets to insert the \`break\` statement. This is thus seen by manyvan der Linden, Peter (1994). Expert C Programming: Deep C Secrets, p. 38. Prentice Hall, Eaglewood Cliffs. . as a language wart, and warned against in some lint tools. Syntactically, the cases are interpreted as labels, not blocks, and the switch and break statements explicitly change control flow. Some languages influenced by C, such as JavaScript, retain default fallthrough, while others remove fallthrough, or only allow it in special circumstances. Notable variations on this in the C-family include C#, in which all blocks must be terminated with a \`break\` or \`return\` unless the block is empty (i.e. fallthrough is used as a way to specify multiple values). In some cases languages provide optional fallthrough. For example, Perl does not fall through by default, but a case may explicitly do so using a \`continue\` keyword. This prevents unintentional fallthrough but allows it when desired. Similarly, bash defaults to not falling through, when terminated with ;; but more recent versions allow fallthrough with ;& instead. An example of a switch statement that relies on fallthrough is Duff's device.  Compilation  Optimizing compilers such as GCC or Clang may compile a switch statement into either a branch table or a binary search through the values in the cases.Vlad Lazarenko. From Switch Statement Down to Machine Code A branch table allows the switch statement to determine with a small, constant number of instructions which branch to execute without having to go through a list of comparisons, while a binary search takes only a logarithmic number of comparisons, measured in the number of cases in the switch statement. Normally, the only method of finding out if this optimization has occurred is by actually looking at the resultant assembly or machine code output that has been generated by the compiler.  Advantages and disadvantages  In some languages and programming environments, the use of a \`case\` or \`switch\` statement is considered superior to an equivalent series of if else if statements because it is: * Easier to debug (e.g. setting breakpoints on code vs. a call table, if the debugger has no conditional breakpoint capability) * Easier for a person to read * Easier to understand, and consequently easier to maintain * Fixed depth: a sequence of \\"if else if\\" statements may yield deep nesting, making compilation more difficult (especially in automatically generated code) * Easier to verify that all values are handled. Compilers can issue a warning if some enum values are not handled. Additionally, an optimized implementation may execute much faster than the alternative, because it is often implemented by using an indexed branch table. For example, deciding program flow based on a single character's value, if correctly implemented, is vastly more efficient than the alternative, reducing instruction path lengths considerably. When implemented as such, a switch statement essentially becomes a perfect hash. In terms of the control flow graph, a switch statement consists of two nodes (entrance and exit), plus one edge between them for each option. By contrast, a sequence of \\"if...else if...else if\\" statements has an additional node for every case other than the first and last, together with a corresponding edge. The resulting control flow graph for the sequences of \\"if\\"s thus has many more nodes and almost twice as many edges, with these not adding any useful information. However, the simple branches in the if statements are individually conceptually easier than the complex branch of a switch statement. In terms of cyclomatic complexity, both of these options increase it by k‚àí1 if given k cases.  Alternative uses  Many languages evaluate expressions inside \`switch\` blocks at runtime, allowing a number of less obvious uses for the construction. This prohibits certain compiler optimizations, so is more common in dynamic and scripting languages where the enhanced flexibility is more important than the performance overhead. For example, in PHP, a constant can be used as the \\"variable\\" to check against, and the first case statement which evaluates to that constant will be executed: switch(true) { case ($x  'hello'): foo(); break; case ($z  'howdy'): break; } switch(5) { case $x: break; case $y: break; } This feature is also useful for checking multiple variables against one value rather than one variable against many values. COBOL also supports this form (and others forms) in the \`EVALUATE\` statement. PL/I has an alternative form of the \`SELECT\` statement where the control expression is omitted altogether and the first \`WHEN\` that evaluates to true is executed. In Ruby, due to its handling of \`=\` equality, the statement can be used to test for variable‚Äôs class: case input when Array then puts 'input is an Array!' when Hash then puts 'input is a Hash!' end Ruby also returns a value that can be assigned to a variable, and doesn‚Äôt actually require the \`case\` to have any parameters (acting a bit like an \`else if\` statement): catfood = case when cat.age <= 1 junior when cat.age > 10 senior else normal end A switch statement in assembly language: switch: cmp ah, 00h je a cmp ah, 01h je b jmp swtend ; No cases match or \\"default\\" code here a: push ah mov al, 'a' mov ah, 0Eh mov bh, 00h int 10h pop ah jmp swtend ; Equivalent to \\"break\\" b: push ah mov al, 'b' mov ah, 0Eh mov bh, 00h int 10h pop ah jmp swtend ; Equivalent to \\"break\\" ... swtend: = Exception handling = A number of languages implement a form of switch statement in exception handling, where if an exception is raised in a block, a separate branch is chosen, depending on the exception. In some cases a default branch, if no exception is raised, is also present. An early example is Modula-3, which use the \`TRY\`...\`EXCEPT\` syntax, where each \`EXCEPT\` defines a case. This is also found in Delphi, Scala, and Visual Basic.NET.  Alternatives  Some alternatives to switch statements can be: * A series of if-else conditionals that examine the target one value at a time. Fallthrough behavior can be achieved with a sequence of if conditionals each without the else clause. * A lookup table, which contains, as keys, the \`case\` values and, as values, the part under the \`case\` statement. ::(In some languages, only actual data types are allowed as values in the lookup table. In other languages, it is also possible to assign functions as lookup table values, gaining the same flexibility as a real \`switch\` statement. See Control table article for more detail on this). ::Lua does not support case/switch statements: http://lua-users.org/wiki/SwitchStatement . This lookup technique is one way to implement \`switch\` statements in the Lua language, which has no built-in \`switch\`.Switch statement in Lua ::In some cases, lookup tables are more efficient than non-optimized \`switch\` statements since many languages can optimize table lookups, whereas switch statements are not optimized unless the range of values is small with few gaps. A non-optimized, non-binary search lookup, however, will almost certainly be slower than either a non-optimized switch or the equivalent multiple if-else statements. * A control table (that may be implemented as a simple lookup table) can also be customized to accommodate multiple conditions on multiple inputs if required and usually exhibits greater 'visual compactness' than an equivalent switch (that can occupy many statements). * Pattern matching, which is used to implement switch-like functionality in many functional languages.

He is currently a radio broadcaster for the New York Mets on WCBS. Previously, Rose called play-by-play for the New York Rangers and New York Islanders. Early life Rose was born in Brooklyn, New York into a Jewish family. He attended PS 205Q (The Alexander Graham Bell School), Benjamin N. Cardozo High School in Bayside, Queens, and graduated from Queens College in 1977. He lives on Long Island in Woodbury, New York with his wife and two daughters. His oldest daughter, Alyssa, was an actress who appeared on the soap opera One Life to Live, had two separate podcasts, called Scoring Position and Drunk Love, and currently works for Sportsnet New York. Career Rose started his career doing sports updates on New York City-based Sports Phone, a telephone dial-in service, during the mid-1970s, which led to sports updates on news radio station WCBS-AM through the early 1980s. Rose has called Mets play-by-play on radio or television since 1995, and is regarded by fans and media outlets alike as an expert of Mets history.http://www.amazinavenue.com/2013/4/2/4174006/a-chat-with-mets-radio- broadcaster-howie-rose He has previously hosted the \\"Mets Extra\\" pre- and post-game shows. He worked the television booth until the retirement of long- time Mets radio voice Bob Murphy in 2003. The following year, Rose took Murphy's spot alongside Gary Cohen on WFAN. Cohen became the play-by-play broadcaster on then-new Mets television network SportsNet New York starting during the 2006 season, sharing the radio booth with partner Tom McCarthy. In 2008, Wayne Hagin replaced McCarthy, and from 2012-2018, Rose called games with Josh Lewin. As of 2019, Howie calls games with Wayne Randazzo. https://www.newsday.com/sports/media/wayne-randazzo-howie-rose-mets-booth- wcbs-radio-1.27485566 From 2014-2018 he called games on WOR, before moving to WCBS in 2019. He has also co-hosted MLB Now, joining Brian Kenny, Mark DeRosa, and Ken Rosenthal on MLB Network. Rose has also been the master of the ceremonies during key Mets events, including Opening Day at Shea Stadium and Citi Field since 2004. He has hosted ceremonies marking the opening of Citi Field in 2009, the 40th anniversary of the Mets 1969 World Series victory, a special pregame ceremony honoring Ralph Kiner in 2008, and Mike Piazza's number retirement ceremony in 2016. Announcing style Rose's end-of-game catchphrase is, \\"Put it in the books\\", used after the final out is recorded in a Mets win. After Mets losses, Rose says \\"and the ballgame is over\\". When he uses the phrasing \\"and the Mets are leading by a score of _ to _\\", he is using the same diction as original Mets broadcaster Lindsey Nelson. Hockey Rose worked as a play-by-play radio announcer for the New York Rangers, and was paired mainly with Sal Messina. He is most recognized by Rangers fans for his call of \\"Matteau! Matteau! Matteau!\\" made when St√©phane Matteau scored the game-winning goal in double-overtime of Game 7 of the 1994 NHL Eastern Conference Finals against the New Jersey Devils en route to the Stanley Cup Finals. The Rangers would go on to win the cup that year over the Vancouver Canucks 4 games to 3, their first Stanley Cup victory in 54 years. Rose was the play-by-play announcer for Islanders telecasts where he worked alongside Butch Goring. For the season, Rose's work was simulcast on radio as well. Rose replaced Jiggs McDonald on Islanders broadcasts in and was previously partnered with Ed Westfall, Joe Micheletti, and Billy Jaffe. After the 2015-2016 season, Rose announced he would not return to call Islanders games after the end of the season. =Other career roles= Rose was the original prime-time radio host on WFAN when the station went all-sports in 1987, hosting the program until 1995. Rose occasionally worked games for Fox NHL Saturday in the mid-1990s, and now works for Fox Saturday Baseball. He has also called Long Island Blackbirds basketball and soccer. On March 1, 2013, his book Put it in the Book was released. The book is an autobiography and memoir of 50 years of Mets history. The book was co-written with Phil Pepe.

Unlike friction brakes, where the drag force that stops the moving object is provided by friction between two surfaces pressed together, the drag force in an eddy current brake is an electromagnetic force between a magnet and a nearby conductive object in relative motion, due to eddy currents induced in the conductor through electromagnetic induction. A conductive surface moving past a stationary magnet develops circular electric currents called eddy currents induced in it by the magnetic field, as described by Faraday's law of induction. By Lenz's law, the circulating currents create their own magnetic field that opposes the field of the magnet. Thus the moving conductor experiences a drag force from the magnet that opposes its motion, proportional to its velocity. The kinetic energy of the moving object is dissipated as heat generated by the current flowing through the electrical resistance of the conductor. In an eddy current brake the magnetic field may be created by a permanent magnet or an electromagnet. With an electromagnet system, the braking force can be turned on and off (or varied) by varying the electric current in the electromagnet windings. Another advantage is that since the brake does not work by friction, there are no brake shoe surfaces to wear, eliminating replacement as with friction brakes. A disadvantage is that since the braking force is proportional to the relative velocity of the brake, the brake has no holding force when the moving object is stationary, as provided by static friction in a friction brake, hence in vehicles it must be supplemented by a friction brake. Eddy current brakes are used to slow high- speed trains and roller coasters, as a complement for friction brakes in semi- trailer trucks to help prevent brake wear and overheating, to stop powered tools quickly when power is turned off, and in electric meters used by electric utilities. Mechanism and principle 244x244px 242x242px An eddy current brake consists of a conductive piece of metal, either a straight bar or a disk, which moves through the magnetic field of a magnet, either a permanent magnet or an electromagnet. When it moves past the stationary magnet, the magnet exerts a drag force on the metal which opposes its motion, due to circular electric currents called eddy currents induced in the metal by the magnetic field. Note that the conductive sheet is not made of ferromagnetic metal such as iron or steel; usually copper or aluminum are used, which are not attracted to a magnet. The brake does not work by the simple attraction of a ferromagnetic metal to the magnet. See the diagram at right. It shows a metal sheet (C) moving to the right under a magnet. The magnetic field (B, green arrows) of the magnet's north pole N passes down through the sheet. Since the metal is moving, the magnetic flux through the sheet is changing. At the part of the sheet under the leading edge of the magnet (left side) the magnetic field through the sheet is increasing as it gets nearer the magnet. From Faraday's law of induction, this field induces a counterclockwise flow of electric current (I, red), in the sheet. This is the eddy current. In contrast, at the trailing edge of the magnet (right side) the magnetic field through the sheet is decreasing, inducing a clockwise eddy current in the sheet. Another way to understand the action is to see that the free charge carriers (electrons) in the metal sheet are moving to the right, so the magnetic field exerts a sideways force on them due to the Lorentz force. Since the velocity v of the charges is to the right and the magnetic field B is directed down, from the right hand rule the Lorentz force on positive charges qv√óB is toward the rear in the diagram (to the left when facing in the direction of motion of the sheet) This causes a current I toward the rear under the magnet, which circles around through parts of the sheet outside the magnetic field in two currents, clockwise to the right and counterclockwise to the left, to the front of the magnet again. The mobile charge carriers in the metal, the electrons, actually have a negative charge, so their motion is opposite in direction to the conventional current shown. Due to Ampere's circuital law, each of these circular currents creates a counter magnetic field (blue arrows), which due to Lenz's law opposes the change in magnetic field, causing a drag force on the sheet which is the braking force exerted by the brake. At the leading edge of the magnet (left side) by the right hand rule the counterclockwise current creates a magnetic field pointed up, opposing the magnet's field, causing a repulsive force between the sheet and the leading edge of the magnet. In contrast, at the trailing edge (right side), the clockwise current causes a magnetic field pointed down, in the same direction as the magnet's field, creating an attractive force between the sheet and the trailing edge of the magnet. Both of these forces oppose the motion of the sheet. The kinetic energy which is consumed overcoming this drag force is dissipated as heat by the currents flowing through the resistance of the metal, so the metal gets warm under the magnet. The braking force of an eddy current brake is exactly proportional to the velocity V, so it acts similar to viscous friction in a liquid. The braking force decreases as the velocity decreases. When the conductive sheet is stationary, the magnetic field through each part of it is constant, not changing with time, so no eddy currents are induced, and there is no force between the magnet and the conductor. Thus an eddy current brake has no holding force. Eddy current brakes come in two geometries: *In a linear eddy current brake, the conductive piece is a straight rail or track that the magnet moves along. *In a circular, disk or rotary eddy current brake, the conductor is a flat disk rotor that turns between the poles of the magnet. The physical working principle is the same for both. Disk eddy current brakes Disk electromagnetic brakes are used on vehicles such as trains, and power tools such as circular saws, to stop the blade quickly when the power is turned off. A disk eddy current brake consists of a conductive non- ferromagnetic metal disc (rotor) attached to the axle of the vehicle's wheel, with an electromagnet located with its poles on each side of the disk, so the magnetic field passes through the disk. The electromagnet allows the braking force to be varied. When no current is passed through the electromagnet's winding, there is no braking force. When the driver steps on the brake pedal, current is passed through the electromagnet windings, creating a magnetic field. The greater the current in the winding, the greater the eddy currents and the stronger the braking force. Power tool brakes use permanent magnets, which are moved adjacent to the disk by a linkage when the power is turned off. The kinetic energy of the vehicle's motion is dissipated in Joule heating by the eddy currents passing through the disk's resistance, so like conventional friction disk brakes, the disk becomes hot. Unlike in the linear brake below, the metal of the disk passes repeatedly through the magnetic field, so disk eddy current brakes get hotter than linear eddy current brakes. Japanese Shinkansen trains had employed circular eddy current brake system on trailer cars since 100 Series Shinkansen. The N700 Series Shinkansen abandoned eddy current brakes in favour of regenerative brakes, since 14 of the 16 cars in the trainset used electric motors. In regenerative brakes, the motor that drives the wheel is used as a generator to produce electric current, which can be used to charge a battery, enabling the energy to be reused. Dynamometer eddy current absorbers A 6-minute ‚Äòhow-it-works video‚Äô tutorial explaining how engine-dynamometer and chassis dyno eddy-current absorbers work. Most chassis dynamometers and many engine dynos use an eddy-current brake as a means of providing an electrically adjustable load on the engine. They are often referred to as an \\"absorber\\" in such applications. Inexpensive air- cooled versions are typically used on chassis dynamometers, where their inherently high-inertia steel rotors are an asset rather than a liability. Conversely, performance engine dynamometers tend to utilize low-inertia, high RPM, liquid-cooled configurations. Downsides of eddy-current absorbers in such applications, compared to expensive AC-motor based dynamometers, is their inability to provide stall-speed (zero RPM) loading or to motor the engine - for starting or motoring (downhill simulation). Since they do not actually absorb energy, provisions to transfer their radiated heat out of the test cell area must be provided. Either a high-volume air-ventilation or water-to-air heat exchanger adds additional cost and complexity. In contrast, high-end AC- motor dynamometers cleanly return the engine's power to the grid. Linear eddy current brakes Goliath made by Intamin, at Walibi Holland (Netherlands) Linear eddy current brakes are used on some rail vehicles, such as trains. They are used on roller coasters, to stop cars smoothly at the end of the ride. The linear eddy current brake consists of a magnetic yoke with electrical coils positioned along the rail, which are being magnetized alternating as south and north magnetic poles. This magnet does not touch the rail, but is held at a constant small distance from the rail of approximately 7 mm (the eddy current brake should not be confused with another device, the magnetic brake, which exerts its braking force by friction of a brake shoe with the rail). It works the same as a disk eddy current brake, by inducing closed loops of eddy current in the conductive rail, which generate counter magnetic fields which oppose the motion of the train. The kinetic energy of the moving vehicle is converted to heat by the eddy current flowing through the electrical resistance of the rail, which leads to a warming of the rail. An advantage of the linear brake is that since each section of rail passes only once through the magnetic field of the brake, in contrast to the disk brake in which each section of the disk passes repeatedly through the brake, the rail doesn't get as hot as a disk, so the linear brake can dissipate more energy and have a higher power rating than disk brakes. The eddy current brake does not have any mechanical contact with the rail, thus no wear, and creates neither noise nor odor. The eddy current brake is unusable at low speeds, but can be used at high speeds for emergency braking and service braking.\\"Wirbelstrombremse im ICE 3 als Betriebsbremssystem hoher Leistung\\" (\\"Eddy-current brake in the ICE 3 as high-efficiency service brake system\\", by J√ºrgen Prem, Stefan Haas, Klaus Heckmann, in \\"electrische bahnen\\" Vol 102 (2004), No. 7, pages 283ff The TSI (Technical Specifications for Interoperability) of the EU for trans-European high-speed rail recommends that all newly built high-speed lines should make the eddy current brake possible. The first train in commercial circulation to use such a braking system has been the ICE 3. Modern roller coasters use this type of braking. To avoid the risk posed by power outages, they utilize permanent magnets instead of electromagnets, thus not requiring a power supply. This application lacks the possibility of adjusting braking strength as easily as with electromagnets. Lab experiment In physics education a simple experiment is sometimes used to illustrate eddy currents and the principle behind magnetic braking. When a strong magnet is dropped down a vertical, non-ferrous, conducting pipe, eddy currents are induced in the pipe, and these retard the descent of the magnet, so it falls slower than it would if free-falling. As one set of authors explained In typical experiments, students measure the slower time of fall of the magnet through a copper tube compared with a cardboard tube, and may use an oscilloscope to observe the pulse of eddy current induced in a loop of wire wound around the pipe when the magnet falls through.

The standard supports algorithms enabling seamless handover between wired and wireless networks of the same type as well as handover between different wired and wireless network types also called Media independent handover (MIH) or vertical handover. Vertical handover was first introduced by Mark Stemn and Randy Katz at U C Berkeley. The standard provides information to allow handing over to and from wired 802.3 network to wireless 802.11, 802.15, 802.16, 3GPP and 3GPP2 networks through different handover mechanisms. The IEEE 802.21 working group started work in March 2004. More than 30 companies have joined the working group. The group produced a first draft of the standard including the protocol definition in May 2005. The standard was published January 2009. Reasons for 802.21 Cellular networks and 802.11 networks employ handover mechanisms for handover within the same network type (aka horizontal handover). Mobile IP provides handover mechanisms for handover across subnets of different types of networks, but can be slow in the process. Current 802 standards do not support handover between different types of networks. They also do not provide triggers or other services to accelerate mobile IP based handovers. Moreover, existing 802 standards provide mechanisms for detecting and selecting network access points, but do not allow for detection and selection of network access points in a way that is independent of the network type. Some of the expectations Allow roaming between 802.11 networks and 3G cellular networks. * Allow users to engage in ad hoc teleconferencing. * Apply to both wired and wireless networks, likely the same list as IEEE P1905 specifies to cooperate in software-defined networking (see also OpenFlow) * Allow for use by multiple vendors and users.  Compatibility and conformance with other IEEE 802 standards especially 802.11u unknown user authentication and 802.11s ad hoc wireless mesh networking. * Include definitions for managed objects that are compatible with management standards like SNMP. * Although security algorithms and security protocols will not be defined in the standard, authentication, authorization, and network detection and selection will be supported by the protocol.  Implementation and Issues  Implementation is still in progress. Current technologies such as 802.11 that accomplish handover use software to accomplish handovers and suggest that software will also be the way that handover will be implemented by 802.21. The use of software as a means to implement 802.21 should not cause large increases in the cost of networking devices. An open source software implementation is provided by ODTONE. Crossing different administrative connectivity domains will require agreements among different network operators. Currently, such agreements are still not in place. In smart phones today, a user can manually select to use WiFi or cellular LTE, but the connections are not automatically maintained should a disconnection of one network occurs. Hence, seamless handovers across different wire/wireless networks are still not available today. =Examples= A user should be able to unplug from an 802.3 network and get handed off to an 802.11 network. * A cellular phone user in the midst of a call should be able to enter an 802.11 network hotspot and be seamlessly handed off from a GSM network to the 802.11 network and back again when leaving the hotspot.  Other similar technologies  Unlicensed Mobile Access (UMA) technology is basically a mobile-centric version of 802.21. UMA is said to provide roaming and handover between GSM, UMTS, Bluetooth and 802.11 networks. Since June 19, 2005, UMA is a part of the ETSI 3GPP standardization process under the GAN (Generic Access Network) Group. The Evolved Packet Core (EPC) architecture for Next Generation Mobile Networks (3GPP Rel.8 and newer) provides the Access Network Discovery and Selection Function element (ANDSF) (see 3GPP TS 23.402 and 3GPP TS 24.312). Its S14 interface provides the communication path between the Core Network and the User Endpoint device on which to exchange discovery information and inter-system mobility policies, enabling as such a network suggested reselection of access networks.

The river of Eagle River itself can be seen following a winding path to the south of the settlement. View of the mountainous scenery found in abundance in the upper Eagle River valley. Eagle River is a community within the Municipality of Anchorage situated on the Eagle River, for which it is named, between Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson and Chugach State Park in the Chugach Mountains. Its ZIP code is 99577. Settled by homesteaders, Eagle River has been annexed to the Municipality of Anchorage since the 1970s‚Äîa relationship that is, at times, complicated. On the one hand, Eagle River functions as an Anchorage suburb, with a number of Eagle River residents working in, shopping or participating in community life in the Anchorage bowl. Much of the community is also made up of residents from nearby Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. On the other hand, the community is itself a significant business hub between Wasilla and Anchorage, offering shopping, restaurants, recreation and employment. Secession efforts have from time to time gained traction by residents who would like Eagle River legally regarded as a separate community. Eagle River also has a close relationship with its neighboring community to the north, Chugiak, with which it shares some history. If Eagle River were not part of the Municipality of Anchorage, it would be classified as one of the five largest cities in Alaska. History The Eagle River (and Chugiak) area was settled by homesteaders and prospered on agricultural activities. The name Eagle River was first reported in 1939 by the U.S. Geological Survey, and the Eagle River post office was established in 1961. In 1964, the state legislature first divided the state into seven boroughs. Over the next decade, many area residents objected to the Chugiak-Eagle River area being lumped in as part of a Greater Anchorage-Area Borough. The Chugiak-Eagle River Borough was established in 1974, only to be dissolved shortly thereafter when the arrangement was ruled unconstitutional by the Alaska Supreme Court. In spite of some local opposition, both Chugiak and Eagle River became annexed to the Municipality of Anchorage when the City of Anchorage and the Greater Anchorage Area Borough were unified in 1975. Efforts to secede from the Municipality surfaced around 2000, and then became less prominent for a while as the community saw an influx of individuals with social and economic ties to Anchorage and the nearby Joint Base Elmendorf‚ÄìRichardson. However, secession talks began again in 2019. Geography Upper Eagle River valley, with Hiland Road neighborhoods in the left foreground and the Chugach Mountains in the background. Mount Baldy, a 3,218-foot peak in Chugach State Park is a popular hiking and hang-gliding area.Tunseth, Matt. \\"Hiking Mount Baldy: Eagle River‚Äôs hometown hill,\\" 8 July 2017, Chugiak-Eagle River Star.

The Eagle River runs through the southern end of the community. Neighborhoods along the Glenn Highway and Old Glenn Highway corridor are level or sloping, rising towards the Chugach Mountains east of the Old Glenn Highway. The remainder of the community lies along the canyon of the Eagle River; some neighborhoods built in the late 20th century and early 21st century near the Briggs Bridge are built very close to the bottom of the canyon. Neighborhoods along the northern portions of Eagle River, plus Hiland Road and Eagle River Road east of the curve where the road leaves the section line and descends into the canyon, mainly consist of houses built across the mountainsides. Wallace Mountain, on the far northeast corner of the community's road system, is home to several radio station transmitters and towers at the level. =Climate= Eagle River's average temperatures in January range from 6 to 20 degrees; in summer, temperatures range from 50 to 70. Annual precipitation is 15.9 inches, with 69 inches of snowfall. The bulk of the snowfall is usually from mid-October through December, with fewer snowstorms from January through April. On average, the area experiences 2 to 3 \\"chinooks\\" - a warm, dry wind that melts much of the snow and creates a minor thaw - during the winter months. Springtime is generally referred to as \\"break up\\" in the area and further north, referring to the breaking up of the ice on rivers and lakes. Local lore holds that seedlings should not be planted outdoors until after Memorial Day in May, and even then temperatures should be watched for light frost until June. Demographics Eagle River first appeared on the 1960 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village, and again in 1970. It was annexed into Anchorage in 1975. The 2000 census found a population of 22,236 in Eagle River and an additional 8,000 in the settlements northeast of Eagle River: Chugiak, Birchwood, Peters Creek, Thunderbird Falls and Eklutna.Community Information Summaries: \\"Eagle River-Chugiak.\\" Alaska Community Database Online, Alaska Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development. Retrieved on 2007-02-24. About 30,000 people live in the Eagle River and Chugiak areas, on both sides of the Glenn Highway. Many personnel from Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson (and formerly from their predecessors, Fort Richardson and Elmendorf Air Force Base) live in Eagle River, and many of the area's civilian residents additionally commute to jobs in the \\"Anchorage bowl.\\" Economy Eagle River is the shopping hub between Anchorage, Palmer, and Wasilla. Major stores are Wal-Mart, Fred Meyer, Carrs Safeway, and Walgreens. The last decade has seen two major improvements in local services: shopping and the availability of medical and dental services. The local movie theater reopened in 2006 with six screens, then closed down in December 2011. The number of local restaurants available almost doubled over the same 10-year span. As of 2006, leading industries in the community were the service industry, followed by trade (retail) and government (mainly working at public schools for the Anchorage School District. Arts and culture Annual community events include a Fourth of July celebration held at Lion's Park, and the Bear Paw Festival, which is in July and is celebrated with multiple events throughout Eagle River. The Bear Paw Festival kicks off on Thursday evening with the Miss Bear Paw pageant held at the Steve Primis Auditorium at Chugiak High School. This scholarship pageant sponsored by the Chugiak-Eagle River Chamber of Commerce also presents awards for Bear Paw Princess, Official Escort, Best Costume with an Alaskan Theme and Miss Congeniality. The Sleeping Lady Mountain Lions Club provides a Community Service Award scholarship. Saturday morning there is a 5k foot race, followed by a parade. A Renaissance anachronistic group does performances on Saturdays and Sundays. Education Eagle River has numerous public, parochial and charter school programs available for K-12 grades. The public school district is the Anchorage School District (ASD). ASD schools serving Eagle River are: Eagle River Elementary, Gruening Middle School, Eagle River High School, and Chugiak High School, which is located northeast of town. (The town is zoned such that roughly half of local public high school students go to Eagle River High School; the other half attends Chugiak High School.) However, due to damage from the 2018 Anchorage earthquake, Eagle River Elementary and Gruening Middle School, officials closed both schools for repairs through at least the 2019-2020 school year, with displaced students accommodated by other ASD schools. Homeschooling is also a popular form of education in the area, both through home-based charter schools and independently. The University of Alaska Anchorage provides classes in the area and formerly had a campus at the Eagle Center building, adjacent to the middle Glenn Highway interchange. In 2019, the university chose not to renew its lease, but continues to provide classes at local public school locations. There is also a local bible college. Sports VFW Post 9785, located near the middle Glenn Highway interchange, serves as the first checkpoint for the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. There is a lot of local interest in sports: hockey, both indoor and outdoor soccer, baseball, softball, basketball, football, swimming/diving, hiking, and cross- country running and skiing. A bike trail runs alongside the Glenn Highway from Anchorage past Eagle River and to Chugiak. Sidewalks are available and kept clear most of the winter in the downtown area for walking and jogging along the Old Glenn Highway and Business Boulevard. Cross-country skiing trails are available along Birchwood Road near Chugiak High School and recently trails have been put in around Eagle River High School. Hockey, figure skating, leisure skating, and indoor soccer are available at the Harry J. McDonald Memorial Center, which hosted seven games at the 1989 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. Outdoor soccer is available at the Russell Oberg Soccer Complex. Chugiak Youth Sports Association (CYSA) is a local non-profit organization that offers recreational team sport opportunities to the youth of Chugiak and Eagle River including soccer, basketball, volleyball and flag football. Eagle River Soccer Club (ERSC) provides pre-competitive soccer (U9 and U10) and recreational youth and adult leagues. Chugiak Soccer Club (CSC) provides competitive soccer for U11-U19 soccer players. Popular local activities include rafting, hiking, skiing and exploring the mountains. One of the more popular local hikes is up Mount Baldy, which overlooks the town. There is little fishing in the river, but anglers do gather at Fire and Mirror Lakes. The 1996 Arctic Winter Games were held in Chugiak and Eagle River. Media The Chugiak-Eagle River Star is a weekly newspaper that serves Eagle River, Chugiak, Eklutna, Peters Creek and Birchwood. The newspaper was founded in 1971 by Lee B. Jordan, who for decades remained active in the community as an authority on local history. He died in 2018. The Star is part of the Binkley Company family of newspapers and shares reporting resources with its nearby sister publication, the Anchorage Daily News.

He was a co-founder and vice- president of the Canadian Pacific Railway, president of the Bank of Montreal, president of the Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal, president of the Montreal Art Association, and co-founder and president of the Mount Royal Club. He was the natural successor to Lord Mount Stephen as president of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1888, but he did not desire the position; he twice refused a knighthood.The Square Mile: Merchant Princes of Montreal (1987). Donald MacKay The CPR Angus Shops were named for him, as was one of the later CP Ships. Early life In 1831, Angus was born in Scotland at Bathgate. He was a younger son of Alexander Angus (b. 1792), a merchant grocer from Rafford, Morayshire, and his wife Margaret Forrest (b. 1802), of Bathgate.Imperial Vancouver Island: Who Was Who, 1850‚Äì1950, by J. Bosher (2010), page 87 Alexander Angus was a friend of the father of Sir James Young Simpson, and five of his eight children came to Canada at various stages.Journal of the House of Lords, 1861 Educated at Bathgate Academy, Angus' first employment was in Manchester as a clerk with the Manchester and Liverpool Bank. In 1857, at Manchester, he married his wife, Mary Anne Daniels (1833‚Äì1913), the daughter of a Manchester wine merchant. In the same year as his marriage, he came with his wife to Montreal and found employment as a book-keeper with the Bank of Montreal, from where he advanced rapidly. By 1861, Angus was placed in charge of the bank's Chicago office, and two years later, he was promoted to second agent in New York. The following year, he returned to Canada as interim manager of the bank's headquarters in Montreal. By 1869, he succeeded Edwin Henry King as the bank's general manager with an annual salary of $8,000, a position he held for the next ten years. During this time, he improved relations with the federal government (at a time when the Bank of Montreal acted as Canada's national bank) and turned over respectable profits despite the economic slump of the 1870s.The Quebec History Encyclopedia Building the Canadian Pacific Railway During his time with the Bank of Montreal, Angus was free to pursue opportunities for private investment. In 1868, he went into partnership with the future Lords Mount Stephen and Strathcona at the time that they were becoming interested in developing railways across to the Canadian West. Their ventures were largely financed by the Bank of Montreal, of which Mount Stephen was president, and as his number two at the bank, Angus was closely involved. Angus resigned from the bank in 1879, briefly relocating to St. Paul, Minnesota, to represent the group's interests there as vice- president of the Saint Paul and Pacific Railroad. In Minnesota, Angus had worked closely with James J. Hill, constructing and improving the line. But by 1880, he spent most of his time with Mount Stephen as they made numerous trips to Ottawa, New York, and London to negotiate the land grants, subsidies, and building of the Canadian Pacific Railway. With Angus providing the analysis and Mount Stephen the acumen, they proved to be a formidable pair. Angus was general manager of the CPR until the appointment of Sir William Cornelius Van Horne in 1882, when Angus became vice-president. In that position, Angus was entrusted with the creation of the eastern network, notably the extension of the Ontario and Quebec Railway and the purchase of the western section of the 'Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa and Occidental Railway' in 1882. The construction of the CPR was fraught with financial peril, testing the resilience of the syndicate ‚Äì Hill resigned in 1883, followed by Angus' close friend Duncan McIntyre the next year. To lobby for funds more successfully, Angus resigned from the St. Paul Railway in 1884. The CPR, completed in 1885, was an immediate financial success, becoming \\"the world's greatest transportation system\\". He remained vice-president of the CPR after Lord Mount Stephen resigned from an active role as president in 1888. Apparently never aspiring to the position, Angus supported Stephen's selection of Van Horne as president and, 11 years later, Van Horne's choice of Lord Shaughnessy as his successor. Angus would serve as a director and committee member of the CPR for over 40 years, necessitating frequent trips to the Canadian Pacific Offices on Trafalgar Square in London. Banking and industry Angus's wealth now allowed him to further invest in the vast number of companies associated with the CPR and its directors. Among others, he sat on the boards of Canada North- West Land Company; Royal Trust Company; Dominion Bridge Company; Dominion Iron and Steel Company; Grand Falls Power Company; Pacific Coal Company; Canadian Salt Company; and the London & Lancashire Assurance Company in England. He joined Sir William Van Horne and former CPR contractors James Ross and Sir William Mackenzie as an investor in street railways in Montreal, Toronto and Winnipeg. Prior to his death, he would be the principal shareholder in Mackenzie's Toronto Power Company. He invested with Van Horne in the Laurentide Paper Company, was among the founding financiers of the British Columbia Sugar Refinery, and was a principal backer of the Federal Telephone Company. The British Columbia Sugar Refinery was started by Benjamin Tingley Rogers, the 'brash' husband of his niece, Mary Isabella Angus.Benjamin Tingley Rogers' Biography from the DCB Angus also played a role in maintaining the close relationship between the CPR and the Bank of Montreal, whose growth in the Canadian West ran side by side that of the railway. In 1891, he returned to the bank as a director, and after the death of Sir George Alexander Drummond, he was elected as the bank's president from 1910 to 1913, when he was succeeded by his son-in-law's brother, Sir Vincent Meredith. By 1912, Angus was one of the bank's largest shareholders, and after retiring as president, he remained a director until his death.The Canadian Encyclopedia Private life and philanthropy Angus at his country house, c. 1900 Drummond Street in Montreal Senneville (demolished in the 1950s) In 1878, Angus and his family moved into his new house at 240 Drummond Street in the Golden Square Mile. Like many wealthy Montrealers, Angus had a passion for floriculture, particularly his beloved orchids, and the house featured a large conservatory.The Square Mile, by Donald MacKay His new home provided a suitable space for the art collection that he had started with purchases from Montreal and London dealers in the late 1870s.Richard B. Angus ‚Äì Dictionary of Canadian Biography His collection contained many fine examples of the Old Masters. Angus served as president of the Art Association of Montreal, donating six paintings in 1889 ‚Äì the most significant gift since the Association's foundation and the first major one in contemporary art. Before his Montreal home was demolished in 1957, it served as McGill University's conservatory of music. In 1901, Angus commissioned the construction of a grand country house on an estate named Pine Bluff at 218 Senneville Road in Senneville, Quebec, overlooking the Lake of Two Mountains.Richard B. Angus House ‚Äì Pine Bluff It was designed in the Ch√¢teauesque style by Edward Maxwell and his younger brother, William Maxwell. The house was completed in 1904 and replaced a home that had been built on the site in 1886 for Angus and then remodeled by Edward Maxwell from 1898 to 1899 before being destroyed by fire soon after. The new home, which included an ice house and a peach house, was later remodelled and eventually demolished in the 1950s. Despite the dawn of the automobile, when Angus was president of the Bank of Montreal in 1910, he was still seen every morning arriving at the bank's headquarters in his four- in-hand carriage. A \\"quiet, purposeful man\\",The Square Mile by Donald MacKay Angus enjoyed vigorous health and remained active until the end of his life, even embarking on a European tour in 1921, at the age of ninety. Angus had become one of the wealthiest men in Montreal, and he was also well known for his philanthropic activities and generous donations to the causes to which he allied himself. He was President of the Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal, and in 1906 co-founded the Alexandra Contagious Diseases Hospital, serving as a governor. He was President and Governor of the Fraser Institute Free Public Library; vice-president of the Victorian Order of Nurses, Governor of McGill University (to which he donated one of his more considerable sums) and Governor of the Montreal General Hospital. He was a director of the Charity Organization Society, which he generously funded. As one of Montreal's most prominent Scots-Quebecers, he was elected President of the St Andrew's Society. In 1889, he co-founded the Mount Royal Club, where he was later President. He was a member of more than a dozen clubs throughout Canada, including: the St. James Club, of which he was formerly chairman; the Montreal Jockey Club; the Auto Club and Aero Club; the Forest and Stream Club; the Winter Club; the Rideau Club of Ottawa; The Toronto Club; the York Club; and the Manitoba Club. He was an honorary member of the Antiquarian and Numismatic Society of Montreal. Legacy and family The three eldest Angus girls before the Castanet Club Ball, 1886 Angus had occupied one of the most prominent positions in Canadian banking by the age of thirty eight. Abandoning that position for a highly speculative railway venture, he not only revealed his personality but also the allure of the railways and the riches they offered. As President of the Bank of Montreal and with the fortune he made from the CPR, he had already secured for himself a place of the highest standing in Canada, but he more than doubled that fortune through his associations with, and investments in, coal, pulp and paper, iron and steel, land and insurance.The Square Mile, by Donald MacKay Angus paid for the education of several of his nephews, including Captain Harry Angus (1891‚Äì1989), who graduated from Balliol College, Oxford, before returning to Victoria, British Columbia. Angus' estate was divided between his eight surviving children: * Elspeth Hudson Angus (1858‚Äì1936), married Charles Meredith. They died without children. * Bertha Angus, married Robert MacDougall Paterson (1859‚Äì1922), stockbroker of Montreal. He was the eldest son of Alexander Thomas Paterson (1833‚Äì1909), President of the Montreal Telegraph Company and a director of the Bank of Montreal.

Although Lord Mount Stephen is generally credited as the genius that created the CPR empire, with his banking and administrative experience, Angus was an indispensable lieutenant. In 1904, the CPR named its new repair complexes in Montreal the CPR Angus Shops in his honour. He died at his country house, Pine Bluff, on 17 September 1922. Two days later, on the day of his funeral, the CPR stopped all trains for two minutes ‚Äì a symbolic gesture to one of its founding partners. He was buried at the Mount Royal Cemetery in Montreal.

In all instances except rural areas these traditional garments have been replaced by Western clothing introduced by European colonialists. African clothing and fashion is a diverse topic that is able to provide a look into different African cultures. Clothing varies from brightly colored textiles, to abstractly embroidered robes, to colorful beaded bracelets and necklaces. Since Africa is such a large and diverse continent, traditional clothing differs throughout each country. For example, many countries in West Africa have a ‚Äúdistinct regional dress styles that are the products of long-standing textile crafts in weaving, dyeing, and printing\\", but these traditions are still able to coexist with western styles. A large contrast in African fashion is between rural and urban societies. Urban societies typically are exposed more to trade and the changing world, while it takes more time for new western trends to get to rural areas. European influence is commonly found in African fashion as well. For example, Ugandan men have started to wear ‚Äúfull length trousers and long-sleeved shirts‚Äù. On the other hand, women have started to adapt influences from ‚Äúnineteenth- century Victorian dress‚Äù. These styles include: ‚Äúlong sleeves and puffed shoulders, a full skirt, and commonly a colorful bow tied around the waist‚Äù. This style of dress is called a busuti. Another popular trend is to pair a piece of modern western clothing, such as T-shirts, with traditional wraps. Rural communities have also started to incorporate secondhand clothing/western clothing into their everyday style too. For example, rural Zambian women have started to combine ‚Äúsecondhand clothing with a single two-yard length of chitengi that was used as a wrapper over the dress‚Äù.https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/gwu/detail.action?docID=713678 With the globalization of western clothing influence from urban to rural areas, it has now become more common to find people wearing a variety of styles of clothes.Urban Algerian man wearing a burnous (woolen cloth) In Northeastern Africa, particularly in Egypt, styles of traditional women's clothing have been influenced by Middle Eastern cultures; this can be exemplified by the simply embroidered Jelabiya which are similarly worn in the Gulf states. The djellaba (worn in Northwest Africa) shares similar properties with the Grand boubou, the dashiki, and the Senegalese kaftan. In Nigeria, women wear head ties. In Sahelian Africa, the dashiki, Senegalese kaftan, and the grand boubou are worn more prominently, though not exclusively (the B√≤g√≤lanfini, for instance, is worn in Mali). The dashiki is highly stylized and is rendered with an ornate V-shaped collar. In contrast the grand boubou is simpler, even more so than the djellaba, though the color designs reach impressive proportions, especially among the Tuareg, who are known for their dyed indigo robes. In East Africa, the kanzu is the traditional dress worn by Swahili-speaking men. Women wear the kanga and the gomesi. In Southern Africa, distinctive shirts are worn, like the long dresses they wear. For instance, South Africa is known for the Madiba shirt, whereas Zimbabwe is known for the safari shirt. In the Horn of Africa, the attire varies by country. In Ethiopia, men wear the Ethiopian suit and women wear the habesha kemis. In Somalia, men wear the khamis with a small cap called a koofiyad. Used western clothing There exist non-profit organizations in all western societies that sell used clothes to for-profit companies in Africa. These \\"white man's clothes\\" are quite common in some parts of the continent. This used clothing is called Mitumba in some areas and is surrounded by some controversy. Critics point to it as a threat to local clothing manufacturers and complain that it exploits consumers. Others argue that this used clothing provides useful competition for often expensive and low quality local products. Before charitable organizations started importing used clothes, cheap cotton clothing from Asia was the biggest import of cotton clothing to Africa. Soon, western charitable organizations began to send used clothing to African refugees and the poor. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa are one of the top destinations for the import of used clothing. Although used clothing was commonly sent for the lower class communities, it is now commonly found within other social classes in Africa. Secondhand clothing is found in everyday apparel for many people, regardless of their class difference. This is because there was always a variety of clothing and it was a good price. However, typically in Muslim regions, such as North Africa, do not partake in this trade due to religious reasons. Instead, Islamic African men wear a long flowing robe and women wear hijab along with a dress covering all skin. Although these clothes are often donated by organizations in belief that people in rural and poor areas will be obtaining them first, the people who live in the cities get the clothing first. Since urban areas are full of fast and changing lifestyles, they are able to adapt to the change in cultures, such as change in tradition dress. These foreign clothes often are drastically different than what people are used to in more rural parts of Africa. People may believe that they are being insulted by being given something that they believe to be old, tattered and dirty. Generally, it seems that most countries have adapted to the use of secondhand clothing and have used it to their advantage. Impacts of Secondhand Clothes The second hand clothing industry has left both positive and negative impacts within African society. An impact that one would commonly not think of is the resale of imported western clothing. South Africa, among other nations, has created a legislation of imported/donated good in order to curb the resale of the donated items. C√¥te d'Ivoire, Nigeria, Kenya and Malawi had to completely ban the importation/donation of second hand clothes in order to try to control the resale. Another negative impact is that is commonly argued is that the importation of western clothing is leaving a negative impact on local clothing producers. However, the opposite side of the argument believes that the high importation creates new jobs for the people living in the port cities. These jobs include the sorting, washing, re-tailoring and transporting of the clothes to the markets. There is a report that revealed that ‚Äú50,000 people are employed in jobs relating to secondhand clothing in one market in Kampala, Uganda‚Äù. Another impact that could be argued either negatively or positively, is that secondhand clothing has become more common to wear than classic African textiles. In Zambia, secondhand clothing has basically become a new type of traditional clothing to them. Zambian cities are full of used clothing markets, which are extremely successful. Since Zambians have been wearing more western clothes traditional textiles and crafts have seemed to become scarce. While Senegal and Nigeria prefer to ‚Äúfollow long-standing regional style conventions, dressing with pride for purposes of displaying locally produced cloth in ‚ÄúAfrican‚Äù styles‚Äù. It can be argued that Zambia is losing a piece of its culture by wearing only western styles or even that people in Senegal and Nigeria are not open minded enough to try to incorporate western styles into their fashion. These differences in beliefs in used clothing help make African fashion a diverse topic.  Fashion in South Africa  South Africa, with an estimate of more than 57 million people from countless backgrounds, ethnicities and religions, holds in it an immense cultural diversity that is expressed through the vast array of topics ranging from cuisine, music, languages to celebrations. Fashion, connecting closely with one's daily life, also plays a crucial role in the identification of South African's culture and people, merely as it does every elsewhere in the world. Each piece of clothing people choose to put on can be simply because it is in their reach, or used as an expression of style as well as political, religious beliefs and perspective in life. No matter how it was chosen, every single piece of clothing contains a long history in it. Precolonial: One of the earliest vestiges of South African attire was traced back to around 2000 years ago when Middle Paleolithic population‚Äô descendants, the Khoisan, settled in Cape Peninsula in the south-western extremity of the African continent. These people were divided into 2 groups which were the San whose life depended heavily on hunting and gathering, and the Khoikoi who were pastoral herders. Without the contacts with foreigners, garments and cloth were unavailable for them to import. Instead, these early settlers altered available resources such as game and domestic animals' softened skin, and sometimes, plants and ostrich eggshell for attire making. In addition to these sources, the introduction of metal also gave them more choices for fashion. The arrival of the Khoisan people were followed shortly after by groups of Bantu-speaking people, who, through the Bantu expansion, ended up with conflict and occupied the land of the Khoisan people, forcing them into dispersion and absorption into the Bantu-speaking community. The settlement of Bantu-speaking people resulted in the formation of the Kingdom of Mapungubwe, from 900-1300 A.D., that flourished with trades from other foregin regions for gold and ivory in the exchange of clothes, glass bead and Chineses porcelain. Bantu-speaking's inhabitants in South Africa also lead to the derivation of nowadays main groups of people in South Africa which are the Nguni speaking people includes four smaller groups (Zulu, Xhosa, Swazi, Ndebele). The other groups of people in South Africa are the Sotho‚ÄìTswana peoples (Tswana, Pedi, and Sotho), while with the group of people in the north-eastern areas of present-day South Africa who are Venda, Lemba, and Tsonga. All of these groups of people, share the common home of South Africa, have for themselves distinctive languages and culture . Colonial: Colonization starting from the mid seventeenth century undoubtedly changed South Africa in all aspects, and fashion together all those changes was influenced heavily by the arrival of new materials from Europe as well as the Eurocentric view about the body and clothing, perceiving that South African dressed like necked imposed changes on traditional fashion of these ideginous groups of people. Traditional clothing made with local materials were incorporated with new style and items from Europe. In the early nineteenth century, glass beads and plastic beads from Europe added new materials to the traditional collection of materials that South African indigenous people used to make beadworks. Around the late nineteenth century, Isishweshwe fabric was introduced to South Africa through importation from England and Germany. The cloth was made with indigo dye and later, with synthetic form of indigo dye with a range of colors ranging from blue and red to maroon and brown, associated with decorations from replicated and orderly organized geometric patterns. Isishweshwe slowly blended itself to the fashion world of South African people, appearing on clothing of working-class people, rural women and male soldiers. Though popular, because it was imported from other countries, was not recognized as what is unique for African fashion until 1982 when South African a company, Da Gama Textiles, began producing the cloths that helped to push its status to be considered as South Africa representative type of fabric. With the influence of colonizers, Western fashion came to rule over South Africa with educated class people preferred Edwardian top coats and hats. Working men also went with Western style that boost the demand for these products. Stores in these working areas carried out a wide variety of goods such as boots, coats, tweed jackets, waistcoats, shirts, braces, belts, hats, handkerchiefs, and pocket watches. Apartheid period: During this era of classifying people by their ethnicities and races, the unique dresses of each South African indigenous community were used as one of the distinction tools. However, besides that, wearing traditional dress also acted as a way for South African coloured people to express their resistance and displeasure with the government ruled by a minority of white people. Traditional clothes were worn by leaders such as Nelson Mandela, who put on a Xhosa traditional garment, in 1962 in his trial for attempting to overthrow the government. The expression of his identity as a true South African person spoke for the aggression in resistance and asking for one's won control of one's country. With traditional dresses were worn as part of expressing one's identity, South African fashion in the aparthied period witnessed the continuing growth of influence from European fashion. The bridge between of pre-aparthied fashion when clothing in South Africa depended heavily on European fashion import and post-aparthied fashion when celebrating one's ethnicity was built by many South African designers who brought a touch of Africa to European style clothing. One noticeable example is Marianne Fassler who incorporated leopard-print with clothing in European style. She took inspiration from South African sources from clothing of indigenous groups of people to artists such as Barbara Tyrrell and Marlene Dumas. Post- aparthied: After the aparthied period ended in 1994, South African traditional dresses continue to be the way to express pride in one's nation and identity as well as an enormous source of inspiration for famous fashion brands such as Sun Goddess, Stoned Cherrie and Strangelove. Pieces such as head wraps and A-line skirt inspired by Xhosa people from the nineteenth century were brought back on the runway. South African fashion is a coming together of different style, culture and response to social circumstances. It's a hybrid between African people themselves and foreigners they interacted with. For its diversity, no single style of dress is stated as national dress, but rather each group of people has a distinctive way to dress themselves.

The main source of ethylmercury is thiomersal. Synthesis and structure Structures of two main types of complexes derived from \\"ethylmercury\\". X‚àí = anion, L = neutral Lewis base. Ethylmercury (C2H5Hg+) is a substituent of compounds: it occurs as a component of compounds of the formula C2H5HgX where X = chloride, thiolate, or another organic group. Most famously X = the mercaptide group of thiosalicylic acid as in thiomersal. In the body, ethylmercury is most commonly encountered as derivatives with a thiolate attached to the mercury. In these compounds, Hg(II) has a linear or sometimes trigonal coordination geometry. Given the comparable electronegativities of mercury and carbon, the mercury-carbon bond is described as covalent.  Toxicity  The toxicity of ethylmercury is well studied. Like methylmercury, ethylmercury distributes to all body tissues, crossing the blood‚Äìbrain barrier and the placental barrier, and ethylmercury also moves freely throughout the body. Risk assessment for effects on the human nervous system have been made by extrapolating from dose-response relationships for methylmercury. Estimates have suggested that ethylmercury clears from blood with a half-life of 3‚Äì7 days in adult humans, however this area has not been well studied. Public health concerns  Concerns based on extrapolations from methylmercury caused thiomersal to be removed from U.S. childhood vaccines, starting in 1999, but remains in all multi dose vaccines and flu shots (though many single use vaccines with no thiomersal are available). Clarkson has argued that risk assessments based on methylmercury were overly conservative, in light of observations that ethylmercury is eliminated from the body and the brain significantly faster than methylmercury. Moreover, Clarkson has argued that inorganic mercury metabolized from ethylmercury, despite its much longer half- life in the brain, is much less toxic than the inorganic mercury produced from mercury vapor, for reasons not yet understood.

Johanna Stunz came from a social- democratic family from Frankfurt, Hesse-Nassau. Her grandfather was one of Frankfurt's first social-democratic aldermen. At 14, she joined the Socialist Worker Youth, and at 18 became a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands - SPD). She worked avidly in the women's movement. In Frankfurt, she became friends with Eleonore Wolf, whose life was taking a similar path. During the First World War, Kirchner, now a mother of two daughters, busied herself in communal welfare, dedicating herself to needy women's and children's welfare. After that, she worked in the Workers' Welfare organization (Arbeiterwohlfahrt; AWO), which she founded together with Marie Juchacz in 1919. Her special concern here was children who were underfed as a result of the war and the widespread inflation that struck Germany later. Many of these children suffered from damaged health and stunted growth. They had had their childhood taken away from them by events over which they had no control. Kirchner took many of these children to Switzerland for their health. During the Ruhrkampf, a brief civil war in Germany in 1920, Kirchner helped evacuate thousands of children from the Ruhr district, sending them to stay with families in Hesse. In 1933, Adolf Hitler came to power, and the dedicated anti-fascist had to go underground, as her help in freeing an anti-Nazi from the Gestapo became known, leading to the danger of her possible arrest. She fled, without her family, to Saarbr√ºcken, which was then still under League of Nations administration. There she worked at kitchen jobs and as a waitress, also caring for German √©migr√©s through, among other means, the Persecuted Anti-Fascists' Aid Committee (). When the Second World War broke out in 1939, Kirchner fled to Forbach, Metz (both in Alsace-Lorraine, France), and then finally Paris. Even while abroad, she helped the resistance movement in Germany: she led the Saar Refugees' Committee (Saarfl√ºchtlingskommitee), drew up plans and reports for the SPD's executive in exile, and produced and distributed illegal leaflets. Even though Kirchner belonged to the SPD and Eleonore Wolf did illegal work for the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), they worked quite closely together in the Saar region as they organized the emigration of many officials of the workers' movement out of the Reich. (See: Red Help). From this they also published, under Wolfgang Abendroth's editorship \\"die Einheit der Arbeiterbewegung in der antifaschistischen Arbeit\\" (The Unity of the Workers' Movement in Anti-Fascist Work). In 1942, Kirchner was arrested by the Vichy R√©gime and handed over to the Gestapo. She was sentenced to ten years' hard labour (\\"Zuchthaus\\") for treason, the first year of which she spent in a prison in Cottbus, which she shared with several female members of the Red Orchestra resistance group, whose goal was to hasten the Nazi r√©gime's collapse. These women's solidarity greatly helped Kirchner overcome the ordeal of being thrown in prison. However, Kirchner's case was brought back before the Volksgerichtshof in 1944. This time, Roland Freisler, the Chief Justice at the Volksgerichtshof, sentenced her to death, and she was beheaded at Pl√∂tzensee Prison in Berlin. The judgment accused Kirchner of having \\"treasonably rooted herself in the evilest Marxist high-treason propaganda\\". It also accused her of \\"treasonably gathering cultural, economic, political, and military intelligence and communicating\\" the same. \\"Keep Goethe's words in mind,\\" wrote Kirchner in a letter to her children on the day of her death, \\"'Die and become'. Don't cry for me. I believe in a better future for you.\\" Legacy Since 1990, the city of Frankfurt am Main, Kirchner's birthplace, has yearly awarded the Johanna Kirchner Medal to those who fight against oppression, and stand up against terror, torture, and murder.

She attributed the positive report by the World Health Statistics (May 2013) on dramatic improvement in health in the world's poorest countries from 1993 to 2013, to the emphasis placed on poverty alleviation by the Millennium Development Goals. She announced the emergence of global action plans for noncommunicable diseases, mental health, and the prevention of avoidable blindness and visual impairment calling for a life course approach which includes \\"equity through universal health coverage,\\" preventive strategies and \\"integrated service delivery.\\" Chan declared at the assembly that intellectual property, or patents on strains of new virus, should not impede nations from protecting their citizens by limiting scientific investigations. Following the 2012 MERS outbreak, Saudi Arabia Deputy Minister of Health Ziad Memish raised concerns that scientists who applied for a patent would not allow the MERS-Coronavirus to be used for investigations by other scientists and were, therefore, delaying the development of diagnostic tests. Ten of the 22 people who died and 22 of 44 cases reported were in Saudi Arabia.

Once her patent issued in 28 December 1886, she founded Garis-Cochrane Manufacturing Company to manufacture her machines. Cochrane showed her new machine at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893 where nine Garis-Cochran washers were installed in the restaurants and pavilions of the fair and was met with interest from restaurants and hotels, where hot water access was not an issue. She won the highest prize for \\"best mechanical construction, durability and adaptation to its line of work\\" at the Fair. Garis-Cochran Manufacturing Company, which built both hand and power operated dishwashers, grew through a focus on hotels and other commercial customers and was renamed as Cochran‚Äôs Crescent Washing Machine Company in 1897. Cochran's Crescent Washing Machine Company became part of KitchenAid through acquisition by Hobart Manufacturing Company after Cochran's death in 1913, who first grew the commercial business, and in 1949, the first KitchenAid dishwasher based on Cochran's design was introduced to the public. By the 1950s, most households had access to hot water which had been limited in the past and cultural attitudes regarding the role of women were shifting so the consumer home market opened for dishwashers in the 1950s. Cochran was posthumously inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2006 for patent 355,139 issued on December 28, 1886 for her invention of the dishwasher.  Biography  She was born Josephine Garis in Ashtabula County, Ohio, on March 8, 1839 and raised in Valparaiso, Indiana. Cochrane was the daughter of John Garis, a civil engineer, and Irene Fitch Garis. After moving to her sister‚Äòs home in Shelbyville, Illinois, she married William Cochrane on October 13, 1858. William had returned the year before from a disappointing try at the California Gold Rush, but had gone on to become a prosperous dry goods merchant and Democratic Party politician. In spite of her young age and the societal norm at the time, Cochrane was guided by her independent nature and personal confidence. She assumed her husband‚Äôs name but preferred spelling it with an ‚Äúe‚Äù on the end, a point of contention with his family. Forgotten Newsmakers: Josephine Cochrane (1839‚Äì1913) Invented the Dishwasher Josephine and William had 2 children: Hallie and Katharine. In 1870 the family moved into a mansion and she joined Chicago society. After one event dinner party, some of the heirloom dishes got chipped while washing up, prompting her to search for a better alternative to handwashing the china. She also wanted to relieve tired housewives from the duty of washing dishes after a meal. = Death and recognition = Cochrane died of a stroke or exhaustion in Chicago, Illinois, on August 3, 1913, and was buried in Glenwood Cemetery in Shelbyville, Illinois. In 2006 she was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.  Cochrane's dishwasher  The first few men she tried to hire to put her design into reality insisted on changing her design, and the results didn‚Äôt work. Other attempts had been made to produce a commercially viable dishwasher. In 1850 Joel Houghton designed a hand-cranked dish soaker. In the 1860s, L. A. Alexander improved on the device with a geared mechanism that allowed the user to spin racked dishes through a tub of water. Neither of these devices was particularly effective. Cochrane designed the first model of her dishwasher in the shed behind her house in Shelbyville, Illinois. George Butters was a mechanic who assisted her in the construction of the dishwasher; he was also an employee at the first dishwasher factory. To build the machine, she first measured the dishes and built wire compartments, each specially designed to fit either plates, cups, or saucers. The compartments were placed inside a wheel that lay flat inside a copper boiler. A motor turned the wheel while hot soapy water squirted up from the bottom of the boiler and rained down on the dishes. Her dishwasher was the first to use water pressure instead of scrubbers to clean the dishes inside the machine. After receiving a patent on December 28, 1886US Patent No. 355139A: Dish-washing machine The Garis- Cochran Manufacturing Company became part of KitchenAid, and in 1949, the first KitchenAid dishwasher based on Cochran's design was introduced. It was in the 1950s that dishwashers became a common household item after new suburban homes were built with the plumbing required to handle the extra hot water.

His main interests are atomic physics, condensed matter physics and many-body physics. He is a Fellow of the American Physical Society. During the last ten years, the group of H.T.C. Stoof has been involved in the study of various aspects of the physics of ultracold atomic gases. In addition, they performed research on skyrmion lattices in the quantum Hall effect and collective modes in supersolid 4He. Below the results obtained from the study of degenerate Fermi gases are briefly summarized. Already in 1996 they predicted that an atomic gas of 6Li (a fermionic isotope of lithium) becomes a Bardeen-Cooper- Schrieffer (BCS) superfluid at experimentally obtainable temperatures. They have also performed a detailed study of the superfluid behaviour of this gas below the critical temperature. Motivated by this work, at least six experimental groups from around the world, including the groups of R. Grimm, R.G. Hulet, D.S. Jin, and W. Ketterle, started trying to achieve the necessary conditions for the BCS transition in 6Li. In the last seven years the study of superfluidity in Fermi gases has been at the center of attention of the ultracold atoms community. It is fair to say that the very successful experiments, that ultimately have led to the creation of the superconductor with, as a fraction of the Fermi energy, the highest critical temperature ever, have only been possible due to the use of so-called Feshbach resonances. These resonances were theoretically co-discovered by H.T.C. Stoof in the alkalis in 1993. At that time, the full potential of a Feshbach resonance for studying the crossover from a BCS superconductor of Bose-Einstein condensed Cooper pairs to a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of molecules was not realized yet, but this crossover is now well understood due to the strong connection between experiment and ab initio theory that is possible in this field. The group has made important contributions to the present understanding of how many-body physics affects the BEC-BCS crossover, and how to incorporate the two-body physics of the Feshbach resonance exactly into the many-body theory. Henk Stoof was elected as an APS Fellow for these contributions. In the last three years, the group of R.G. Hulet at Rice and the group of W. Ketterle at MIT have pioneered the experimental study of spin imbalance on the superfluid state. These experiments have especially concentrated on the strongly interacting or unitarity limit exactly at resonance where the attraction between the atoms is as large as quantum mechanics allows. Again, the group of H.T.C. Stoof made important contributions to this topic. For example, they were first to predict the topology of the universal phase diagram of this unitarity gas, that is now confirmed by the experiments and that contains a tricritical temperature below which the gas phase separates between an (almost) equal density superfluid and a polarized normal gas. Making use of renormalization group techniques, they are up to now the only theoretical group that has been able to accurately calculate this strong-coupling tricritical temperature from first principles. They believe that an important reason for the success in this area of physics is that they have a background in both the microscopic atomic physics and in the macroscopic condensed-matter physics. It is only through a combination of this knowledge that one can arrive at sophisticated many-body theories that can be directly compared with experiment without any fitting parameters.

Ahmet Zappa and Tanya Memme hosted all three seasons while Tanika Ray only hosted the first season with Dan Danknick replacing her for the second and third seasons. Season 1 Each preliminary show in the first season of Robotica featured four robots weighing as much as 210 pounds paired off in a series of three challenges.Robotica Season 1 rules runamok.tech The winners of each pairing faced each other in a Robot-sumo style \\"Fight to the Finish\\" to determine the winner of the show. *The first challenge was The Speedway. Robots raced in opposite directions around a figure-8 track. Robots were awarded 10 points for each lap completed (up to 8), with an additional 20 points awarded to the winner. This challenge had a two-minute time limit. *The second challenge was The Maze. Robots negotiated obstacles in two identical, twisting courses that met in the middle. Five obstacles (teeter ramp, push box, rotating paddles, guillotine, and waterfall) worth 15 points each, plus 25 points for the first robot to the center platform. This challenge had a three-minute time limit. *The third challenge was The Gauntlet. Robots crashed through barrier walls of increasing difficulty. Five barriers (glass pane, paint cans filled with sand, bricks, concrete paving stones, and a heavy safe) worth 15 points each, plus 25 points to the first robot to complete the course. This challenge had a three-minute time limit. Total points were added for the three events to determine a winner. In the event of a tie, the robot who won the greater number of events advanced. The Fight to The Finish took place on a 16' by 16' platform elevated high above the floor. A low guard rail surrounded the platform for the first minute and then fell away. The last robot on the platform moved on to the finals. The finals worked the same way as the preliminary shows, except there were six robots, competing in three pairs. Three robots met in the Fight to the Finish. The winner of the show was awarded the largest cash prize in robot combat to that date: $12,000. Seasons 2 and 3 Robotica seasons 2 and 3 featured redesigned challenges. The Speedway was eliminated, The Gauntlet was redesigned, and The Maze had been completely re-done and renamed The Labyrinth.Robotica Season 2/3 rules runamok.tech The former side-by-side Gauntlet course was now arranged in a diamond-shape. The first barrier wall was now a wooden plank, the walls of metal cans, bricks, and concrete paving stones remained, and the safe was gone. Each robot had to complete their own two legs of the diamond and then return through the opponent's rubble field before climbing a ramp up to the Forest of Glass in the center of the diamond. When all the glass strips were broken, a final glass sheet lowered as the final challenge. Scoring was 10 points for each barrier, 5 points for each rubble wall, 10 points for first up the ramp, 5 points for second up the ramp, 15 points for the final glass pane. This challenge had 150 total points available and a three-minute time limit. Jawbreaker's Revenge battles Buzzbomb at the 'Rollers' obstacle: Robotica season 3 The former two-path Maze was now a single Labyrinth wherein both robots could roam to choose from six scoring obstacles. Also roaming the Labyrinth were two rat-shaped robots named the \\"Robotica Rats\\" that could interfere with (or sometimes help) the competitors. Breaking the glass strip beyond each obstacle claimed the points. Obstacles were: #Push Box - 15 points #Lifting Spikes - 15 points #Suspension Bridge - 20 points #Flipper - 20 points #Rollers - 25 points #Sand Box - 25 points Robots started together in a motorized rotating turntable, where combat was encouraged. A robot could be penalized the entire point total for an obstacle if they broke down or got stuck in a position that blocked access to the obstacle. At the end of three minutes, or when all the obstacles were cleared, the exit opened. The final glass strip on the far side of the exit was worth 30 points. This challenge had 150 total points available and a four-minute time limit. The winning pair of robots faced each other in The Fight to The Finish. The platform was enlarged from season 1; it was now a 25' by 25' elevated platform. A new rule called for robots to hold the other robot 'pinned' for no more than 15 seconds before release.

Plot The story opens 60 years after the events of The 7th Guest. It is now 1995, and the player assumes the role of Carl Denning, an investigative reporter for the television series \\"Case Unsolved\\". Robin Morales, his producer and lover, mysteriously vanished three weeks prior in Harley-on-the-Hudson, New York. She was investigating a series of grisly murders and disappearances that had plagued the otherwise sleepy upstate town over the last few months. Denning's only solid lead is a portable computer called the GameBook delivered with only a postmark from Harley. When booted, the GameBook displays Robin's plea to help her escape. The story then flashes back to the beginning of Robin's investigation. She interviews Eileen Wiley, the only person known to have survived an encounter with Henry Stauf's mansion. Eileen confirms she lost her hand that night, claiming it had been bitten off by a dog, but offers no other meaningful details of the encounter. Suspicious of Eileen's story, Robin interviews Dr. Thornton, who treated Eileen that night. Though the doctor appears to believe Eileen about the dog, the interview proves fruitful as Dr. Thornton reveals that Eileen was not alone that night; her friend Samantha Ford was with her in the house those 18 years ago. Samantha's family used its considerable influence to keep her involvement out of the papers. He also reveals that Samantha has been paralyzed from the waist down ever since the girls' encounter. Dr. Thornton's receptionist listens to the entire conversation through an intercom, demonstrating a strangely angry behavior. Robin attempts to interview Samantha, but their meeting is adversarial. Samantha's forceful denials convince Robin that the women are not telling the truth about their encounter. Samantha confirms Robin's suspicions later that evening when she visits Robin's motel room and shares her story. Samantha claims that during their encounter with the house, something supernatural held the girls down and raped them, then let them go, though the gate slammed shut on Eileen's hand as she tried to flee, severing it. After both women ended up pregnant, Samantha had an illegal abortion that resulted in her paralysis, but Eileen went through with the pregnancy and had a daughter, Marie. Samantha claims there was always something sinister about the child and believes that \\"all hell let loose\\" around Marie's 18th birthday, that Marie is the mansion's offspring, and that Marie is responsible for the murders and disappearances. Meanwhile, Robin begins to bud a romance with Jim Martin, the local police chief. Robin confronts Eileen with the story, and Eileen denies everything. Eileen then challenges Robin to go to the house herself. After Robin leaves it's revealed that Marie, who is Dr. Thornton's receptionist, was listening to the entire conversation again. Desperate to keep her secret from getting out, Marie commands her lover Chuck Lynch to murder Robin. It's revealed that Chuck and Marie were responsible for the recent murder spree: from time to time, at Marie's orders, Chuck would kill an innocent victim as a human sacrifice to \\"feed\\" the entity that inhabits Stauf's mansion. It is implied that Chuck, who is an adulterous business man, was getting benefits magically from the entity in exchange for the sacrifices. Chuck initially resists murdering Robin, worried about the media attention a famous disappearance would bring, but Marie convinces him by reminding him of the consequences for not helping Stauf. He enters Robin's hotel and stabs someone sleeping in bed, but he actually stabbed the police chief who had a budding romance with Robin. Unable to remove the knife, he takes the body to Stauf's mansion, where he is pulled inside and killed by Stauf for his mistake. Robin comes to the house soon after and enters as Samantha watches remotely, somehow having hacked into Stauf's surveillance. As Robin moves through the house, it psychologically breaks her by systematically confronting her with uncomfortable truths about her past. The story then picks up with Carl in the mansion. Eventually Robin meets Stauf and he begins to tempt her into joining him, by enticing her with her own television network and other advantages she can get by serving the entity. Carl watches the conversation between them through the GameBook and unsuccessfully tries to convince Robin to just leave the mansion with him. As Robin ignores Carl's pleas and accepts Stauf's offer, Samantha breaks into the GameBook transmission and reveals that she was the one who sent the GameBook to Carl hoping that he could rescue Robin and warns him that it is too late now. Unable to leave Robin at first, Carl follows her cries upstairs where he meets Stauf, who is presiding over a game show called \\"Let‚Äôs Make a Real Deal\\" (a parody of Let's Make a Deal). Stauf explains that Carl must choose to open one of the doors, then offers Carl $600. Carl can keep it, or he can pay $200 and reveal what's behind one of the three doors in front of him. He pays to reveal door number two, which turns out to be a large TV. Next, he pays door number one, which is Marie. As Stauf tempts Carl with Marie's sexual prowess, Samantha hacks into the TV behind door number two, warning him not to give in to temptation as Stauf mocks her paralysis. Finally, Carl pays to reveal door number three, which is Robin. She expresses her love for Carl, pleading with him to choose her. Samantha urges Carl to choose her, revealing that this will end Stauf forever and that choosing either of the others will doom him. The game turns Carl's choice over to the player, which reveals one of three endings: * Carl chooses Samantha: reaching out his hand to touch Samantha's on the TV. On the moment Carl touches the TV screen, he is teleported to Samantha's front door, and they watch the house burn to the ground on the same TV from the game show. Carl expresses regret about Robin, but Samantha laments that Robin was lost the moment she said \\"yes\\" to Stauf. Apparently, in this ending, the entity starved to death when Carl refused its offers and chose to just save himself. * Carl chooses Robin: Carl and Robin embrace as Samantha looks on in disappointment. The story then flashes forward weeks later, where Robin is in Carl's living room watching the news of his body being found in the Hudson River. The newscaster reports that he disappeared on his honeymoon in Harley-on-the-Hudson after marrying Robin, who is the new president of the Stauf Broadcasting System. It's possible that in this ending Robin took Chuck's former place as the \\"mansion feeder\\", and murdered Carl both as a sacrifice and to silence him after all he had witnessed inside of the mansion. * Carl chooses Marie: as Samantha and Robin look on, Carl gives in to Marie's temptations. Marie leads him through a door to another room, and as the two have sex, Marie morphs into Stauf. The Stauf/Marie hybrid then taunts Carl ironically congratulating him for his \\"wise choice\\" while eating cooked ribs, which they claim to be his. On the script of the game, after morphing into Stauf, Marie was supposed to morph into the entity that controls the mansion revealing its physical appearance, but it was scrapped from the final version of the game. Gameplay Overall, the gameplay is similar to its predecessor's with the same puzzle-based gameplay structure, but with the additional element of a treasure hunt. Release Although Trilobyte stated in 1993 ‚Äî even before The 7th Guest became available‚Äîthat it planned to release The 11th Hour by October of that year, it was very late to market by over two years (eventually releasing in December 1995) and failed to meet sales expectations upon its release. Early into its development, a port to the 3DO was planned, and a release date of May 1994 was announced, but it was pushed back to March 1995, and ultimately cancelled. Trilobyte had confirmed that the game would be released on both the iPhone and iPad platforms. The release for iOS was scheduled for Q2/Q3 2011, but in March 2012 Trilobyte postponed the release indefinitely due to \\"serious technical challenges\\". In April 2012, The 7th Guest: Book of Secrets application for iOS was renamed to just Book of Secrets, and was updated to include a walkthrough and script for The 11th Hour, just as it already had for 7th Guest. In 2012, The 11th Hour was re-released for Windows, as a download from DotEmu and GOG.com. On October 18, 2013, it was re-released again on Steam, as part of a collaboration between Trilobyte and Night Dive Studios. Development The makers of the game originally intended for it to contain more adult content in its cut scenes; the script for the game (published as part of a walk-through guide) included several R-rated sex scenes. Rumors immediately surfaced that an \\"uncut\\" version of 11th Hour existed, leading to the game makers announcing that the R-rated sequences, though planned, were never filmed. Many of the videos that were filmed for the game used location shooting; the fifth scene utilised a blue screen incorporating a neutral blue drape. Macintosh Premier was used to convert the capture film into digitized images and videos. A program called 'Wavelet' was used to compress the game's videos. It was developed by Trilobyte and used a later version of the Groovie graphic engine than that used by The 7th Guest. The 11th Hour also features the music of George \\"The Fat Man\\" Sanger and Team Fat. Reception Reviews of the game upon initial release were mixed. After extensively praising the game's graphics, challenging puzzles, storyline, and atmosphere, as well as the lower amount of gratuitous gore when compared to The 7th Guest, a reviewer for Maximum concluded \\"However, the bottom line is that 11th Hour is basically a more advanced version of 7th Guest.\\" A reviewer for Next Generation also found the game much too similar to its predecessor, particularly as he considered the entire genre of puzzle adventures to be a waste of time. He also criticized that the game has long load times except when running on high-end computers. Steve Honeywell of Computer Game Review called it a \\"whopping disappointment\\". Arinn Dembo reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World.Dembo, Arinn; This Old House: The Sequel to 7th Guest Strikes Perilously Close to Midnight, p. 128. Computer Gaming World, Issue 140, March 1996 In 2010, UGO included the game in the article The 11 Weirdest Game Endings. By April 1995, Trilobyte planned to launch The 11th Hour with a shipment of 250,000 copies. However, by December, retailers in the United States had ordered 500,000 units of the game. According to Geoff Keighley, \\"The 11th Hour had the biggest ship-out of a PC game up until that point - nearly half a million units\\".https://web.archive.org/web/20010610152938/http://www.gamespot.com/features/btg- tri/part3-4.html The game was a commercial success, with sales of nearly 300,000 copies in the United States alone by May 1996. =Awards= The 11th Hour won the following awards: *1995 New Media Invision Awards - Gold-Games Strategy/Puzzle *1995 New Media Invision Awards - Bronze-Consumer Interactive Movies *1995 International Cindy Competition - Honorable Mention - Consumer Games *1995 CD-ROM Today \\"Rommie\\" Awards - Best Graphic Adventure References External links The rise and fall of Trilobyte - Detailed article on the company, including the making of The 11th Hour. 1995 video games Adventure games DOS games First-person adventure games Full motion video based games Interactive movie video games Mac OS games MacOS games Psychological horror games Puzzle video games Rape in fiction Single-player video games Video game sequels Video games developed in the United States Video games scored by George Sanger Video games set in the 1990s Video games set in the United States Virgin Interactive games Windows games Video games with alternate endings ","title":"The 11th Hour (video game)"},{"id":"1831606","text":"Sons of Satan Praise the Lord is a compilation album by the death metal band Entombed.

A Macintosh port was subsequently developed by Contraband Entertainment and released by the 3DO Company. The fourth installment of the popular Heroes of Might and Magic franchise, it is the sequel to Heroes of Might and Magic III, and was the last to be developed by New World Computing.  Gameplay  Heroes of Might and Magic IV introduced a number of major changes to the series. = Heroes = Unlike previous games, where they had little active role in combat, heroes became present on the battlefield with their troops. They can attack, and be attacked. If a hero is killed in combat he/she must be brought to a friendly town to be revived. It is possible to have armies with more than one hero, or with no heroes at all, although armies without a hero are incapable of performing certain tasks, such as capturing enemy towns or structures. The skill system also underwent a significant overhaul, and all Heroes of a given class start out with the same skills. The player has significantly more control over the development of the Hero than in previous games in the series, and Heroes \\"evolve\\" into over 40 different specialized classes. A Hero can select up to five of the nine available primary skills, and each primary skill makes available three secondary skills. Each of these 36 skills have five levels of progression as opposed to the three levels in the previous games.left = Combat = Both the adventure and combat maps were converted to a fixed-view isometric 3D display. The traditional hexagon-based battle grid was converted into a much higher-resolution square-based grid, making it easier to feature units of different sizes. Non-hero spellcasting units were given proper spell selections. Retaliation was allowed simultaneously with the attack, and ranged units were given the capability to retaliate against ranged attacks. Projectile attacks and spells now required direct line of sight to the target. = World map = Each individual troop unit was given its own movement allowance on the adventure map, with units possessing the ability to split off independently of the main army; however, the troops can no longer be \\"shuttled\\" from hero to hero to move an army large distances in a single turn. Logistics were restricted by eliminating or weakening travel spells. This, in turn, was partially compensated for by the elimination of the need to revisit resource-producing structures each week, and the introduction of caravans, which can quickly and safely transport heroes and remotely recruit troops from external dwellings. = Units = A small number of these skills are shared with earlier games, and some of the new skills can dramatically affect strategy (e.g., a Hero with Grandmaster Stealth is invisible to all non-allied units). Troop units may no longer be upgraded, and there are four recruitable ranks of units, down from seven. Each rank has two dwellings that can be built, but beyond the first rank, building one dwelling precludes the other. The creature dwellings themselves accumulate new creatures every day, as opposed to the start of each new week.Harukaba. \\"Heroes of Might and Magic IV ‚Üí Overview.\\" 12 May 2005. Celestial Heavens. Last accessed on 21 January 2006. Story alt=Following the events of Heroes Chronicles: The Sword of Frost, Gelu, the leader of AvLee's Forest Guard and wielder of Armageddon's Blade, attacks Kilgor, the Barbarian King of Krewlod, in an attempt to claim and destroy the Sword of Frost. As foretold by a prophecy, when Armageddon's Blade and the Sword of Frost clash in battle, the result is a massive explosion (known as the Reckoning), which destroys the world of Enroth. Many of the inhabitants of the planet, however, escape through mysterious portals that appear during the Reckoning that lead them to another world, called Axeoth ‚Äì also the setting for Might and Magic IX. Included among the refugees are many of the heroes of previous installments of the series, and many return to their old ways shortly after arriving on their new home. The story of Heroes of Might and Magic IV unfolds primarily through the game's six campaigns, each of which establishes how the major kingdoms of one of Axeoth's continents were forged in the wake of the Reckoning, and the arrival of the Enrothian refugees on Axeoth. Each of the campaigns centers on a faction leader, and tells the story of how that leader came to prominence. Unlike Heroes of Might and Magic III, all of the six campaigns are accessible from the beginning, and each unfolds as a stand-alone tale. * In the Haven campaign, The True Blade, Lysander, a loyal knight formerly in the service of Queen Catherine Ironfist, rules over the nascent kingdom of Palaedra, inhabited mainly by refugees from the kingdom of Erathia. His command, however, is challenged by a usurper named Sir Worton, who claims to be the only surviving heir to the Gryphonheart dynasty. Many of Lysander's generals are drawn to Worton, forcing the lord to expose Worton as a fraud or lose control of his kingdom. * At the start of the Stronghold campaign, Glory of Days Past, Waerjak, a barbarian chieftain, despairs over the changes that have come over the barbarian community. In the wake of Kilgor's death, his people have descended into interfactional strife, and are in danger of wiping themselves out. Intent on restoring the barbarian kingdom to its more peaceful state before Kilgor's ascension, Waerjak sets out to prove his strength and to subdue his rivals, guided by his mentor, Tarnum (previously the protagonist of the Heroes Chronicles series). alt= * The game's Academy campaign, The Price of Peace tells the story of Emilia Nighthaven, the peasant daughter of an Enrothian glassblower. On Axeoth, however, she finds herself taking command of a community of frightened refugees and forging them into the kingdom of Great Arcan. Queen Emilia's success, however, attracts the attention of Gavin Magnus, the Immortal King of Bracada from Heroes of Might and Magic III and Might and Magic VII, and his genie servant, Solmyr, who seek to prevent Axeoth from meeting the same fate as Enroth (i.e. being destroyed) by magically depriving its entire population of their free will. * In the Preserve campaign, Elwin and Shaera, Elwin, a simple elf from the Elven kingdom of Aranorn (mainly populated by survivors from AvLee), is in love with Shaera, but their romance is threatened by Lord Harke, a powerful rival for Shaera's affection. Elwin's continued pursuit of his beloved plunges the region into internecine war, and whoever emerges the victor will not only win Shaera's hand in marriage, but the throne of Aranorn, as well. * Half-Dead, the Necropolis campaign, relates the tale of Gauldoth Half-Dead, the half-human, half-lich victim of a necromantic spell that he cast to save his life which went horribly wrong. Tired of living on the scraps of food he can steal from fearful villagers, Gauldoth unites the forces of the surviving Necromancers and demonic Kreegans from Enroth's old kingdoms of Deyja and Eeofol into Nekross, a powerful and feared kingdom, but he is forced to act as a protector for both the living and the dead when a powerful being from another dimension arrives with plans to end all life in the universe. * A Pirate's Daughter, the game's Asylum campaign, introduces the only daughter of a famous pirate, Tawni Balfour. Tawni inherits her father's ship and crew following his unfortunate death. Sailing down the coasts of the Gold Sea, fighting feared buccaneers, sea monsters and mermaids alike, Tawni intends to claim her father's mantle as Axeoth's most feared pirate captain, all while having to face her own shady past. Expansion packs Two expansion packs were released for Heroes IV: Heroes of Might and Magic IV: The Gathering Storm (2002) and Heroes of Might and Magic IV: Winds of War (2003), both for Microsoft Windows only. The Gathering Storm offers six campaigns, more than 20 maps, 16 additional artifacts, four new creatures, and a multiplayer update. Each of the first five campaigns features a new specialty hero. The Gathering Storm also features an upgraded editor, which allows full access to new heroes, adventure objects, artifacts and creatures. A new soundtrack is also included. Winds of War introduces three new creatures and six new campaigns, which collectively tell the story of the invasion of the kingdom of Channon by the leaders of its five neighboring kingdoms. Winds of War was the last installment of the entire Heroes of Might and Magic series to be developed by New World Computing. Afterwards, the bankruptcy of the 3DO Company led to the sale of the Might and Magic franchise to Ubisoft for $1.3 million. Reception =Sales= In the German market, Heroes of Might and Magic IV debuted at #5 on Media Control's computer game sales chart for April 2002. It climbed to fourth in its second month, before dropping to 12th and 19th in June and July, respectively. =Critical reviews= The critic aggregator Metacritic determined that reviewers found the game to be generally favorable, with a weighted score of 84 out of 100. GameSpot wrote that \\"Heroes IV is clearly a worthy successor to the series and has very clearly been worth the wait\\", praising New World Computing for being \\"able to incorporate so many new and interesting features into this sequel while still making sure it kept all the core elements that made all the previous games so great\\". PC Gameworld was slightly less favorable, saying, \\"The spark might be there, but it doesn't burn as bright as it has in the past.\\" The expansions were less well received by professional reviewers, with metascores of 64 out of 100 for The Gathering Storm and 58 out of 100 for Winds of War. Heroes of Might and Magic IV was a nominee for The Electric Playgrounds 2002 \\"Best Strategy Game for PC\\" award, but lost to Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos.

She played Kristin Shepard in the television series Dallas (1979‚Äì1981, 1991).Mary Crosby profile, yahoo.com; accessed March 13, 2015. Personal life Crosby was born in Los Angeles, California, the only daughter of singer and actor Bing Crosby from his second marriage to actress Kathryn Grant. She graduated from high school at 15, after which she entered the University of Texas at Austin, where she was a member of Delta Delta Delta sorority, though she never graduated. She is fluent in Spanish. She was married to Eb Lottimer from 1978 to 1989 and, since 1998, has been married to Mark Brodka, with whom she has two children. Career Crosby played Kristin Shepard (Sue Ellen Ewing's scheming sister) on the prime time soap opera Dallas from 1979‚Äì81, and a further guest appearance in 1991. Her character is perhaps best remembered for her part in the cliffhanger ending of the 1979‚Äì1980 season of Dallas, titled \\"A House Divided\\", which was resolved in the fourth episode of the following season, \\"Who Done It\\". In that highly watched episode, J.R. Ewing (Larry Hagman) was shot by an unknown assailant. Viewers had to wait all summer (and most of the fall due to a Hollywood actors' strike) to learn whether J.R. would survive, and which of his many enemies was responsible. In the summer of 1980, the question, \\"Who shot J.R.?\\", was being asked in everyday conversations around the world. Ultimately, Kristin Shepard was revealed to have been the person who pulled the trigger in the classic episode, which aired on November 21, 1980. It was one of the highest-rated episodes of a TV show ever aired.Profile, UltimateDallas.com; accessed March 13, 2015. Her character, Kristin Shepard, later made an appearance on the Dallas spin-off series Knots Landing in 1980, before a brief return to Dallas in 1981. Once again the focus of a highly rated cliffhanger, it was revealed in the season opening episode (October 9, 1981) that it was Kristin's body floating in the Southfork Ranch swimming pool. She returned for the final episode of Dallas in 1991, playing the same character in a vision experienced by J.R. After Dallas, Crosby starred in ABC miniseries Hollywood Wives (1985) and North and South, Book II (1986). She guest-starred on Hotel, The Love Boat, Murder, She Wrote, Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Dream On, Beverly Hills, 90210, and In the Heat of the Night. In 1981, she played the leading role of a woman stalked in the remake of the Doris Day thriller Midnight Lace. Other film credits include Last Plane Out (1983), The Ice Pirates (1984), Tapeheads (1988), and The Legend of Zorro (2005).

Shown as Java Trench in ACUF (Advisory Committee on Undersea Features Gazetteer). see also: http://www.gebco.net/ is an oceanic trench located in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, formed where the Australian-Capricorn plates subduct under a part of the Eurasian Plate. It is long with a maximum depth of 23,920 feet (7,290 metres).Heather A. Stewart, Alan J. Jamieson: The five deeps: The location and depth of the deepest place in each of the world's oceans. In: Earth-Science Reviews 197, October 2019, 102896, doi:10.1016/j.earscirev.2019.102896. Its maximum depth is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean. The trench stretches from the Lesser Sunda Islands past Java, around the southern coast of Sumatra on to the Andaman Islands, and forms the boundary between Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian plate (more specifically, Sunda Plate). The trench is considered to be part of the Pacific Ring of Fire as well as one of a ring of oceanic trenches around the northern edges of the Australian Plate. In 2005, scientists found evidence that the 2004 earthquake activity in the area of the Java Trench could lead to further catastrophic shifting within a relatively short period of time, perhaps less than a decade. This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast.IOC: Towards a Tsunami Warning System in the Indian Ocean  Characteristics  For about half its length, off of Sumatra, it is divided into two parallel troughs by an underwater ridge, and much of the trench is at least partially filled with sediments. Mappings after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake of the plate boundary showed resemblance to suspension bridge cables, with peaks and sags, indicative of asperity and locked faults, instead of the traditional wedge shape expected.  Exploration  Some of the earliest exploration of the Trench occurred in the late 1950s when Robert Fisher, Research Geologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, investigated the trench as part of a worldwide scientific field exploration of the world's ocean floor and sub-oceanic crustal-structure. Bomb-sounding, echo-train analysis and manometer were some of the techniques used to determine the depth of the trench. The research contributed to an understanding of the subduction characteristic of the Pacific margins. Various agencies have explored the trench in the aftermath of the 2004 earthquake, and these explorations have revealed extensive changes in the ocean floor. = Manned descent = DSSV Pressure Drop and DSV Limiting Factor at its stern On 5 April 2019 Victor Vescovo made the first manned descent to the deepest point of the trench in the Deep-Submergence Vehicle DSV Limiting Factor (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) and measured a depth of ¬± by direct CTD pressure measurements at 11¬∞7'44\\" S, 114¬∞56'30\\" E. The operating area was surveyed by the support ship, the Deep Submersible Support Vessel DSSV Pressure Drop, with a Kongsberg SIMRAD EM124 multibeam echosounder system. The gathered data will be donated to the GEBCO Seabed 2030 initiative. The dive was part of the Five Deeps Expedition. The objective of this expedition is to thoroughly map and visit the deepest points of all five of the world's oceans by the end of September 2019. To resolve the debate regarding the deepest point of the Indian Ocean, the Diamantina Fracture Zone was surveyed by the Five Deeps Expedition in March 2019, recording a maximum water depth of ¬± at 33¬∞37'52\\" S, 101¬∞21'14\\" E for the Dordrecht Deep. This confirmed that the Sunda Trench was indeed deeper than the Diamantina Fracture Zone.  Associated seismicity  The subduction of the Indo-Australian Plate beneath a bloc of the Eurasian Plate is associated with numerous earthquakes.

While studies of the Internet are now widespread across academic disciplines, there is a growing collaboration among these investigations. In recent years, Internet studies have become institutionalized as courses of study at several institutions of higher learning. Cognates are found in departments of a number of other names, including departments of \\"Internet and Society\\", \\"virtual society\\", \\"digital culture\\", \\"new media\\" or \\"convergent media\\", various \\"iSchools\\", or programs like \\"Media in Transition\\" at MIT. On the research side, Internet studies intersects with studies of cyberculture, human‚Äìcomputer interaction, and science and technology studies. Internet and society is a research field that addresses the interrelationship of Internet and society, i.e. how society has changed the Internet and how the Internet has changed society. The topic of social issues relating to Internet has become notable since the rise of the World Wide Web, which can be observed from the fact that journals and newspapers run many stories on topics such as cyberlove, cyberhate, Web 2.0, cybercrime, cyberpolitics, Internet economy, etc. As most of the scientific monographs that have considered Internet and society in their book titles are social theoretical in nature, internet and society can be considered as a primarily social theoretical research approach of Internet studies.  Topics of study  In recent years, Internet studies have become institutionalized as courses of study at several institutions of higher learning, including the University of Oxford, Harvard University, London School of Economics, Curtin University of Technology, Brandeis University, Endicott College, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Appalachian State University and the University of Minnesota. Disciplines that contribute to Internet studies include: * Computer-mediated communication: such as the role of e-mail, social media, MMORPGs, online chat, blogs, and text messaging in communication processes. * Digital rights: including privacy, free speech, intellectual property, and digital rights management. * Digital Labour and the \\"Gig Economy\\" * Internet architecture: including the fundamental programming and architecture of the Internet, such as TCP/IP, HTML, CSS, CGI, CFML, DOM, JS, PHP, XML. * Internet culture: including the emergence of Internet slang, Cyberculture and digital music. * Internet security: such as the structure and propagation of viruses, malware, and software exploits, as well as methods of protection, including antivirus programs and firewalls. * Online communities: including Internet forums, blogs, and MMORPGs. * Open source software: focusing on the ability of Internet users to collaborate to modify, develop, and improve pieces of software which are freely available to the public without charge. * Sociology of the Internet: including the social implications of the Internet, new social networks, online societies (virtual communities), identity practices and social interaction on the Internet. * Science and Technology Studies: how and why we have the digital technologies we have, and how social shapes their development. * Social media use in politics  Key authors  A number of academic journals are central to communicating research in the field, including Bad Subjects, Convergence: The Journal of Research into New media Technologies, Ctheory, Cyber Psychology + Behaviour, Computers in Human Behavior, First Monday, Information, Communication, and Society, The Information Society, Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, M/C, New Media & Society, tripleC: Journal for a Global Sustainable Information Society, Fibreculture Journal, and TeknoKultura, but research relating to internet studies appears in a diverse range of venues and disciplines. Key foundational work, that developed in to Internet Studies has been pursued by a number of scholars. Studies of the Information Society and the Network Society have been pursued by scholars such as Manuel Castells, Mark Poster, and Frank Webster. Sherry Turkle and Robert Kraut are known for their socio- psychological contributions. Janet Abbate and Patrice Flichy are recognized for their socio-historical research; Barry Wellman and Caroline Haythornwaite for their social network approaches; Ronald E. Rice for his information science contributions; David Lyon and Philip Agre for their privacy and surveillance writings; Lawrence Lessig, Andrew Chadwick, Jonathan Zittrain for their study of law and politics; and Robin Williams, Robin Mansell and Steve Woolgar for their contributions about innovation.  History  As Barry Wellman argues, internet studies may find its beginnings with the 1978 publication of The Network Nation, and was largely dominated by computer scientists, presenting at venues like the annual CSCW conference. These were quickly joined by researchers in business fields and library and information science. By the late 1990s, more attention was being paid to systematic investigation of users and how they made use of the new technologies. During the 1990s, the rapid diffusion of internet access began to attract more attention from a number of social science and humanities disciplines, including the field of communication. Some of these investigations, like the Pew Internet & American Life project and the World Internet Project framed the research in terms of traditional social science approaches, with a focus less on the technology than on those who use them. But the focus remained at the aggregate level. In the UK, the ESRC Programme on Information and Communications Technologies (1986‚Äì1996) laid considerable ground work on how society and ICTs interact, bringing together important clusters of scholars from media and communications, society, innovation, law, policy and industry across leading UK universities. In 1996, this interest was expressed in other ways as well. Georgetown University began offering a related master's program in that year, and at the University of Maryland, David Silver created the Resource Center for Cyberculture Studies on the web. Middlebury College developed Politics of Virtual Realities, one of the first undergraduate courses dedicated to exploring the political, legal and normative implications of the Internet for liberal democracy. By 2001, The Chronicle of Higher Education noted that \\"internet studies\\" was emerging as a discipline in its own right, as suggested by the first undergraduate program in the area, offered at Brandeis University, and noted that \\"perhaps the most telling sign of the field's momentum\\" was the popularity of the annual conference created by the then nascent Association of Internet Researchers. From particularly sociological perspective, James Slevin (2000)James Slevin. 2000. The Internet and Society. Cambridge, UK: Polity. develops a social theory of the Internet that is primarily informed by the line of thought grounded by the British sociologist Anthony Giddens., while Christian Fuchs (2008)Christian Fuchs. 2008. Internet and Society: Social Theory in the Information Age. New York: Routledge. is a social theory account that is primarily grounded in the works by critical theory scholars such as Herbert Marcuse, by the concept of social self-organization, and by neo-Marxist thinking. More recent approaches to studying the internet have focused on situating technology use within particular social contexts, and understanding just how it is related to social and institutional change.

He served as member of the House of Commons of Canada for Battlefords‚ÄîLloydminster from 1997 until his resignation in 2017. He served as Canada's Agriculture minister from 2007 through 2015 under Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Life and pre- political career Ritz was born in Delisle, Saskatchewan and prior to his political career, he worked as a farmer at the family farm for over 20 years and owned a contracting business company. Federal politics Ritz was elected as the Reform Party candidate in the 1997 general election, and then re-elected with the Canadian Alliance in the 2000 election and the Conservative Party of Canada in the 2004 election. Ritz has been the vice- chair of the House of Commons Agriculture Committee since 2002. He was appointed Secretary of State for small business and tourism in the Harper government on January 4, 2007. =Minister of Agriculture= Canadian Minister of Agriculture Gerry Ritz, Mexico Secretary of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food Martinez y Martinez, and U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack On August 14, 2007, Ritz was promoted to the Cabinet as Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food replacing Chuck Strahl. Ritz made national news when, in response to the 2008 Canadian listeriosis outbreak he was quoted as saying, \\"This is like a death by a thousand cuts. Or should I say cold cuts.\\" Then when told of a death in Prince Edward Island, Ritz said, \\"Please tell me it's (Liberal MP) Wayne Easter.\\" Ritz later apologized for his comments and Prime Minister Stephen Harper kept Ritz in Cabinet after the 2008 Canadian general election. In September 2012, E. coli bacteria was found in meat from the XL Foods plant in Brooks, Alberta. This led to over 1800 products being recalled across Canada and the United States. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated that 1.1 million kilograms of meat from XL Foods were recalled from American stores. This was also the largest beef recall in Canadian history, with meat being recalled in every province and territory in Canada and 41 American states. =Opposition MP and resignation from politics= Ritz announced on August 31, 2017 that he intended to resign from the House of Commons in the near future and leave politics to spend more time with family. On September 19, 2017, Ritz caused controversy when he tweeted a link to a news story stating no industrialized nations were on pace to meet Paris Agreement carbon emission targets with the comment \\"Has anyone told our climate Barbie! \\" (referring to Environment Minister Catherine McKenna). Ritz deleted the original post within 20 minutes, afterward posted another message stating: \\"I apologize for the use of Barbie, it is not reflective of the role the Minister plays\\". Conservative leader Andrew Scheer condemned Ritz's comment later in the day and stated he would reach out to McKenna personally to \\"assure the minister that this type of behavior has no place in the Conservative caucus\\". The next day Ritz's office issued a statement confirming his resignation from the House of Commons effective October 2, 2017. Ritz's successor, Rosemarie Falk, was elected in a by- election on December 11, 2017.

The fifteenth named storm of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season, Odette formed near the coast of Panama a few days after the official end of the Atlantic hurricane season, and ultimately made landfall on the Dominican Republic as a moderate tropical storm, before becoming extratropical on December 7, dissipating two days later. The storm caused heavy damage throughout the Dominican Republic from unusually heavy rainfall in December. Preparation preceding Odette's landfall resulted in only eight deaths and 14 injuries. Total damage is unknown, though crop damage in the Dominican Republic totaled to over $8 million (2003 USD, $ million USD). Meteorological history By November 30, the last day of the Atlantic hurricane season, a stationary front extended across eastern Cuba into the southwestern Caribbean Sea. On December 1, a low pressure area developed within the frontal zone just north of Panama, and an anticyclone aloft produced good outflow over the low-level center. The low remained nearly stationary for the next several days, and it gradually became separated from the stationary front. Convection increased across the area due to moisture from the eastern Pacific Ocean and moderate divergence. Increased wind shear deteriorated the system on December 2, though convection redeveloped as the system started a northeast drift. On December 3 a mid-level circulation developed about 140 miles (225 km) north of the surface center. Convection increased and became better organized as a weak tropical wave reached the area, and it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Twenty at around 1200 UTC on December 4 while located about 345 miles (560 km) south of Kingston, Jamaica; initially, the depression was forecast to track north- northeastward and pass over western Haiti. Tropical Storm Odette shortly after being named on December 4 Upon being classified as a tropical cyclone, the depression was embedded within the southwesterly flow between a ridge over the eastern Caribbean Sea and a mid-latitude trough, which caused a steady east- northeast motion. The convection organized into a central dense overcast with a well-defined cloud band wrapping partially around the center, and based on satellite imagery estimates the depression was upgraded to tropical storm status; late on December 4, the National Hurricane Center named the storm Odette. After being named, the storm intensified despite moderate southwesterly wind shear, and an eye feature became evident on microwave satellite imagery. Additionally, about three‚Äìfourths of a mid-level eyewall developed. The storm was assessed with winds of 40‚Äì50 mph (65‚Äì85 km/h), though the National Hurricane Center remarked the winds could have been stronger due to lack of structural data. The eye feature diminished as the convective structure deteriorated slightly, and Hurricane Hunters first flew into the storm at around 1200 UTC on December 5. Odette tracked over an area of warm sea surface temperatures, and the overall cloud pattern gradually improved; the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory predicted the storm to attain hurricane status. Early on December 6, a TRMM overpass showed an 80% closed eyewall, and at 0600 UTC Odette attained peak winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) while located about 245 miles (395 km/h) southwest of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Upon reaching peak intensity, Odette had begun accelerating northeastward, which decreased wind shear and slightly increased its southwesterly outflow. The low-level center decelerated as it approached Hispaniola, though the convection continued quickly northeastward. Failing to maintain vertical organization, Odette weakened slightly and made landfall on Jaragua National Park, in the Pedernales Province of the Dominican Republic, around 2300 UTC on December 6 with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). The circulation became disrupted as it crossed the country, and on December 7 it emerged into the Atlantic Ocean with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). It accelerated to the northeast ahead of an approaching cold front, and late on December 7 Odette transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as its center became embedded within the front. The remnants continued quickly northeastward before losing its identity within the frontal zone on December 9; the frontal zone that absorbed Odette also absorbed Tropical Storm Peter a few days later. Preparations Prior to Odette's predicted arrival, the Dominican Republic government issued for the evacuation of more than 10,000 people, mostly from those living near rivers. At least 2,000 shelters were set up, capable of housing up to 800,000 people. In addition, the government mobilized the army to force those unwilling to leave from their homes. Such precautions were taken due to already saturated grounds from heavy rainfall three weeks prior. A tropical storm watch was issued between Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic/Haiti border on December 4, 56 hours prior to landfall. This was raised to a tropical storm warning on December 5 while 32 hours before landfall. In addition, tropical storm warnings were issued for all of the Haitian coastline and Jamaica. Impact While over the southwestern Caribbean Sea, Odette dropped heavy rainfall, including prior to its formation. For several days, the storm caused rains in Panama, Costa Rica, and the east coast of Nicaragua. In Colombia, the storm caused rainfall totals of up to 8 inches (200 mm) in Puerto Colombia. In Jamaica, the storm dropped moderate rainfall, flooding several roads in Saint Ann and Saint Mary Parishes. Odette caused moderate damage and 8 deaths in the Dominican Republic. =Dominican Republic= Flooding in the Dominican Republic Winds from Tropical Storm Odette were relatively light across the Dominican Republic, with a peak gust of 60 mph occurring in Santo Domingo. The storm dropped heavy rainfall for several hours, amounting to a maximum of 9.07 inches (230 mm) in Isla Saona. Several other locations reported over 4 inches as well. The rainfall caused mudslides and flash flooding, forcing several rivers to overflow in combination with previous rains. In addition, a tornado was reported near Santo Domingo, destroying one house and uproofing several others. The flooding and mudslides damaged up to 60,000 homes and destroyed 34. Gusty winds caused power outages. River flooding caused two bridges to collapse, isolating several communities. Landslides buried several roads, though authorities quickly repaired them. The rainfall also flooded fields, resulting in severe crop damage. As much as 85% of the banana crop was lost, while the coffee crop suffered losses shortly before harvest season. Crop damage totaled to around $8 million (2003 USD). In addition, excess flooding contaminated water supplies, leaving several areas without clean water or sanitation. In all, Tropical Storm Odette caused 8 deaths and 14 injuries, mostly due to flash flooding and mudslides. In addition, two indirect deaths are associated with the storm due to heart attacks. Neighboring Haiti experienced little from the storm. =Puerto Rico and United States Virgin Islands= 250px Though Odette passed 280 miles to the west of Mayag√ºez, Puerto Rico, the storm caused moderate rainfall across Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands. Rainfall in Puerto Rico was heaviest in the southeast, where a peak of 8.73 in (221.74 mm) was recorded in Jajome Alto. The storm also caused up to 2.2 in (55.9 mm) of rainfall in Christiansted on Saint Croix. Odette's rainfall caused flooding throughout the island's rivers. The river flooding destroyed three bridges, resulting in $20,000 in damages (2003 USD). The flooding also caused a mudslide near a cemetery in Humacao. The rainfall also covered numerous roads, though overall damage was minimal throughout Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Aftermath and records In all, 65,000 people were affected by Tropical Storm Odette. The Dominican Republic Red Cross and Red Crescent deployed 105 volunteers to the impacted areas, primarily in the area of Monte Cristi. The organization provided food and hygiene kits to thousands of people, as well as mosquito nets. The Red Cross also gave a 5,000 liter water tank for the citizens in Monte Cristi, an area without clean water or sanitation. When Odette formed on December 4, it became the first tropical storm since the beginning of the modern tropical cyclone record to form in the Caribbean Sea in the month of December; a documented December Caribbean hurricane occurred in 1822. However, Tropical Storm Karen, which formed in November 1989, persisted until December while located in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. In addition, Odette was the first Atlantic storm to form in the month of December since Hurricane Lili in 1984. The 2003 season was the first season since 1954 to have a pre-season storm and a post-season storm, with Ana in April and Odette.

He became nationally known for filing charges against House majority leader Tom DeLay in September 2005 for conspiring to violate Texas' election law and/or to launder money. In Texas, Earle was known for his criminal justice reform efforts which focused on crime prevention, alternative sentencing, victim advocacy, and the reintegration of former offenders into society. In 1983, Earle - an Eagle Scout - prosecuted himself for an election law violation after missing a campaign finance filing deadline by one day; he was fined $212. Earle was a fixture in Travis County politics and served in public office there for more than 30 years, joking that he was asked if he was the \\"District Eternity\\". Earle spoke extensively on his belief that the law guided public responses to crime but that it was society's collective \\"ethics infrastructure\\" that required support to deliver a safer, more just, and more livable community. This belief guided him, as he told the Austin Chronicle in 2008, \\"It really informs everything I've tried to do ‚Äì well, not everything, but most of the things I've tried to do as district attorney, especially the most progressive and innovative things that we have done in this office. And the reason is because the law doesn't teach you how to act. ... What I have come to call the 'ethics infrastructure' teaches you how to act. And that is in that work of mommas and daddies and aunts and uncles and teachers and preachers and neighbors and cousins and friends ‚Äì that's where you learn how to act, not from the law.\\" Biography =Early Life= Earle was born in Fort Worth, Texas and raised on a cattle ranch in Birdville, Texas. He achieved the rank of Eagle Scout, earned money working as a lifeguard, played football, and was president of his high school student council. Earle moved to Austin when he was 19 to attend the college at the University of Texas and law school at the University of Texas School of Law. In 1967, while a law student, he went to work in the office of Texas Governor John Connally. District Eternity - Ronnie Earle on Ronnie Earle - Austin Chronicle - https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2008-04-11/610887/ After graduating from law school, he was appointed and served as a municipal judge in that city from 1969-72. At the time, he was the youngest judge in Texas.Austin American-Statesman - \\"Former Travis County DA Ronnie Earle has died\\" - https://www.statesman.com/news/20200405/breaking-former-travis-county- da-ronnie-earle-has-died Earle was elected to the Texas House of Representatives as a Democrat in 1972, serving until 1976. He was elected district attorney of Travis County in 1976 and served until 2008. He faced opponents only twice during his unprecedented tenure. Earle was married to his second wife, Twila Hugley Earle, for nearly three decades. With his first wife, Barbara Ann Leach Earle, he had two children, Elisabeth Ashlea Earle and Charles Jason Earle. He also had one stepdaughter, Nikki Leigh Rowling, and three grandchildren. =Career as the District Attorney= The Travis County District Attorney's office investigates and prosecutes crimes related to the operation of the Texas state government. Earle was elected as a Democrat in the city of Austin. He was, and his successor now is, the only Democrat with statewide prosecutorial authority. During his tenure, Earle prosecuted a variety of elected officials from both sides of the aisle, often dismissing accusations of partisanship by pointing out that prosecutions tend to focus on officials in power. He prosecuted Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox, a Democrat; United States Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican; and - in his most high-profile case - United States House Majority Leader, Congressman Tom Delay, a Republican. Mattox was acquitted by a jury, Hutchison's case was dismissed, and DeLay was found guilty of money laundering, but his case was later overturned on appeal by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. While his high-profile prosecutions of elected officials garnered the most press attention, it was Earle's work in criminal justice reform that was his primary focus. He was an early champion of reforms that, in his words, were ‚Äúengaging the community in its own protection.‚Äù Earle's innovations focused on crime prevention, alternative sentencing, victim advocacy, and the reintegration of former offenders into society. He spoke nationally on this work, and engaged in criminal justice reform efforts until his death. In late 2007, Earle announced that he would not seek reelection to his post. His departure precipitated a race to fill his seat. Four Democrats, all employees of his office, ran for the seat. In the primary election held on March 4, 2008, no candidate received 50 percent of the vote. A runoff election was held between the top two finishers, and Rosemary Lehmberg ‚Äì whom Earle had endorsed ‚Äì won handily. She faced no Republican opponent in the general election. She took office in January 2009 and is the first woman district attorney in Travis County history. In 2010, Earle ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Texas, using the campaign to promote his criminal justice reform agenda. =Later Life= Earle retired in Austin and remained active in criminal justice reform efforts. He died in Austin, Texas on April 5, 2020 after a long illness. Major Public Integrity Investigations Conducted by Earle Through the Travis County Public Integrity Unit, Earle prosecuted politicians, including Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, United States House Majority Leader Tom Delay, Texas State Representative Mike Martin, and Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox. Defendants often accused Earle of partisanship, which he dismissed by pointing out that the prosecuted those in power, and that the bulk of prosecutions during his career had been brought against fellow Democrats. =Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Yarbrough= In 1978, Earle accused Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Yarbrough, a Democrat, of forgery, aggravated perjury, and failure to appear. =Travis County Commissioner Bob Honts= In 1979, he accused Travis County Commissioner Bob Honts, a Democrat, of official misconduct and bribery. Commissioner Honts pled guilty to a misdemeanor, \\"misapplying county property\\", in 1984. He was ordered to pay a $2,000 fine. =Texas State Senator Gene Jones= In 1980, Earle accused Texas State Senator Eugene 'Gene' Jones, a Democrat from Houston, of using a state computer to prepare campaign mailings. Jones pled guilty to a misdemeanor charge of official misconduct, paid $2,000 fine and $10,000 in restitution. =Indictment of State Rep. Mike Martin= On July 31, 1981 during the First Called Session of the Sixty-seventh Texas Legislature, Republican Representative Mike Martin, a Republican then of Longview, was shot in the left arm outside his trailer in Austin with 00-buckshot. Soon after the shooting, unidentified spokespeople from Earle's office released information to the Austin American Statesman that they felt Martin was telling inconsistent stories to the police. They claimed he first said he had no idea who did it; later he said it was a Satanic cult; in the end, he accused his political enemies. Martin responded to the leaks by saying he was asked to give police all possibilities and said he had no idea why the district attorney's office would be saying such things. Earle personally made a public announcement that Martin was cooperating with police and that no one from his office was releasing information saying otherwise to The Statesman. Earle formed a grand jury to look into the shooting of Martin and invited him to attend without issuing a subpoena. Martin refused to appear by issuing a statement that he had already given officials all the information he knew. Gregg County District Attorney Rob Foster shortly arrested Martin on a three- year-old assault charge. The charge was immediately dismissed due to time limits and lack of evidence. Upon release, Martin appeared before reporters and accused Gregg County officials of using their offices to ruin him politically. The day after his release on the assault charge, Martin voluntarily appeared before Earle's grand jury. At the time he didn't know that his first cousin, Charles Goff, had previously appeared before the grand jury and admitted helping Martin stage the event to advance Martin's political career. He claimed Martin offered him a state job as payment, despite Texas' strong nepotism laws forbidding the hiring of relatives. Goff had served prison time and had three outstanding felony warrants pending at the time of his testimony; however, the grand jury took his word over Martin's. After Martin's denial of Goff's accusations before the grand jury, Earle filed felony perjury charges against the freshman legislator. Martin pleaded not guilty and, a year later, worked out a plea bargain with Earle by admitting to misdemeanor perjury charges relating to the renting of a car around the time of the shooting. Martin resigned his House seat on April 22, 1982 and withdrew from the upcoming election. Martin filed several suits against Earle, Foster, and Goff for civil rights violations. A federal judge dismissed the last case in June 1985 on grounds that prosecutors enjoy qualified immunity from civil suits. Martin maintains his innocence regarding Earle's charges. =Texas State Treasurer Warren G. Harding= In 1981, Texas State Treasurer Warren G. Harding, a Democrat, pled guilty to class A misdemeanor of official misconduct. He received a one year deferred adjudication, paid a $2,000 fine, and paid $2,000 in restitution. =Texas Speaker of the House Gib Lewis= In 1983, the Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives, Gib Lewis, a Democrat, pled guilty to a class B misdemeanor for failing to file his financial statement. He paid an $800 fine. =Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox= In 1983, Earle accused then-Attorney General Jim Mattox of threatening Fulbright & Jaworski's municipal bond business unless one of their lawyers stopped trying to question his sister, Janice Mattox, about a bank loan. The loan was an issue in a lawsuit involving Mobil Oil Co. and Clinton Manges, a South Texas oil man and rancher who financially supported Mattox, who was acquitted after a long trial. =San Antonio Voter Registrar Marco Gomez= In 1983, San Antonio Voter Registrar Marco Gomez, a Democrat pled guilty to charges of \\"securing execution of document by deception and tampering with a governmental record.\\" He received 10 years probation, 90 days in the Travis County Jail, paid $49,994 in restitution, and paid a $2,000 fine. =Texas State Representative Charles Staniswallis= In 1983, Texas State Representative Charles Staniswallis, A Republican, pled guilty to charges of theft and tampering with a governmental record. Staniswallis received 10 years probation, paid a $2,000 fine, and paid $8,976 in restitution. =Texas Speaker of the House Gib Lewis= In 1992, the Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives, Gib Lewis, a Democrat, pled guilty to two counts of filing false financial statements. He paid a $1,000 fine on each count. =United States Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison= In 1994, Earle filed charges against Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican then serving as Texas State Treasurer, for tampering with physical evidence, tampering with a governmental record, and official misconduct. On the first day in court, following an evidentiary hearing in which it became clear that the judge would rule much of his evidence inadmissible, Earle attempted to drop the charges in order to regroup but the judge refused to allow it, instructing the jury to return a \\"not guilty\\" verdict so the charge could not be brought against her again. =Texas State Representative Betty Denton= In 1995, Texas State Representative Betty Denton, a Democrat, pled guilty to misdemeanor charges of perjury. She received six months deferred adjudication and paid a $2,000 fine. =Lane Denton= In 1995, Lane Denton, a Democrat and the executive director of the Department of Public Safety Officers' Association was found guilty of second degree theft (a felony) and misapplication of fiduciary property. He was ordered to pay $67,201 in restitution along with a $12,000 fine. Additionally, he was sentenced to 10 years of probation, 60 days in jail, and 240 hours of community service. =Texas State Representative Gilbert Serna= In 2000, Texas State Representative Gilbert Serna, a Democrat, pled guilty to multiple charges of theft by public servant. He was placed on probation for 10 years, was sentenced to 90 days in jail, and was required to pay a $3,000 fine along with restitution of more than $13,000. =Investigation and Indictment of Tom DeLay= For over two years, Earle and eight separate grand juries investigated possible violations of Texas campaign finance law in the 2002 state legislative election. Earle denies that his pursuit of DeLay was part of a partisan \\"fishing expedition\\". His investigation of two political action committees that spent a combined $3.4 million on 22 Republican Texas House races focused on a political action committee founded by DeLay, (Texans for a Republican Majority PAC). During the investigation, DeLay charged that Earle was a \\"runaway district attorney\\" with \\"a long history of being vindictive and partisan\\". On September 28, 2005, a grand jury indicted DeLay for conspiring to violate Texas state election law. Texas prohibits corporate contributions in state legislative races. The indictment charged that Texans for a Republican Majority, DeLay's PAC, accepted corporate contributions, laundered the money through the Republican National Committee, and directed it to favored Republican candidates in Texas. The presiding judge in the case, Pat Priest, a Democrat, eventually threw out the charge and the Court of Criminals Appeals upheld this decision in 2007. Earle's second attempt to secure indictments against DeLay failed. That grand jury returned a \\"no bill\\" due to insufficient evidence. The jury member questioned stated that Earle appeared visibly angry with the \\"no bill\\" decision. Earle eventually received an indictment against DeLay from a third Austin grand jury that had been seated for a few hours. This indictment was on charges of conspiracy to launder money. DeLay's lawyers asserted the indictment was flawed legally, as laundered money is defined in the Texas Penal Code as money gained in the \\"proceeds of criminal activity\\". DeLay's defense stressed that corporate donations to political campaigns are a normal, legal business activity. Due to a House rule requiring a party leader to step down if indicted, the indictment required DeLay to resign as Majority Leader. In a counter complaint, DeLay's attorney, Dick DeGuerin, filed a motion against DA Earle, charging him with prosecutorial misconduct in the DeLay indictment. DeGuerin sought court permission to depose grand jurors. DeLay filed a motion for a change of venue from the Democrat stronghold of Travis County to Fort Bend County, where he resides. The motion was denied by Judge Priest and a trial date for October 2010 was set. On November 24, 2010, DeLay was convicted of money laundering. The conviction was overturned by the Third Court of Appeals for the State of Texas in September 2013. The court found that \\"there was no evidence that [the PAC] or RNSEC [the Republican National State Elections Committee] treated the corporate funds as anything but what they were, corporate funds with limited uses under campaign finance law.\\" In its opinion, the court decided that \\"...the evidence shows that the defendants were attempting to comply with the Election Code limitations on corporate contributions.\\" The court not only overturned the verdict, but took the step of entering a full acquittal. Other Major Criminal Investigations Conducted by Earle =LaCresha Murray Case= In 1996, Earle indicted 11-year-old LaCresha Murray for capital murder involving two-year-old Jayla Belton - the youngest homicide prosecution in Texas history. Earle's evidence rested on an alleged confession by Murray, obtained by interrogation at a children's shelter in the absence of any attorney or family member. Murray's case provoked several public protests of Earle's office and at the Texas State Capitol from her detention in 1996 until her release in 1999, when the case was reviewed. Murray was again tried and convicted of intentional injury to a child, receiving a 25-year sentence. In 2001, the Texas Third Court of Appeals later reversed the verdict and remanded her sentence after discerning that her confession had been illegally obtained. Furthermore, a liver tissue examination by a pathologist expert in the field showed the injury was inflicted hours before and thus not by Murray. Clothes worn by the toddler had no blood traces which should have been present given the injuries ‚Äî indicating the clothes were changed after the toddler was beaten. Faced with the evidence Earle eventually dropped all charges against Murray. In 2002, a suit was filed against the Travis County District Attorney's Office and a host of other individuals and various agencies, which alleged the Murray family had been victimized by malicious prosecution, defamation, libel and slander, and had suffered mental anguish. Charges of racism were also raised in the suit, suggesting that the Murray family would have been treated differently had they been white. Murray's suit was dismissed; on November 28, 2005, the US Supreme Court refused to revive the lawsuit. =Maurice Pierce Case= On December 6, 1991, four teenage girls were murdered inside a local yogurt shop in Austin. In 1999, Earle led the \\"Yogurt Shop Murders\\" case against suspect Maurice Pierce, leading to a grand jury indicting him on four counts of first degree murder. Pierce was arrested, along with Robert Springsteen IV, Michael Scott, and Forrest Welborn, for the murders of four girls. Springsteen and Scott eventually confessed to the crime. Springsteen was convicted and sentenced to death. Scott was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. Welborn was never indicted for the crime. Pierce continually maintained his innocence up until his release, occurring three years after his arrest. The state could not use Springsteen's and Scott's confessions against Pierce, so, without a confession, and only circumstantial evidence to connect him to the yogurt shop, the state had to either try Pierce or release him. Earle released him and dropped all charges citing a lack of evidence. The case against Pierce remains open. On December 24, 2010, Pierce was shot dead by Austin police officers in an incident during which Pierce allegedly stabbed a police officer with the officer's knife. 2010 Texas Elections Immediately after Earle announced his retirement as District Attorney of Travis County in December 2007, he began being mentioned as a possible statewide candidate. In the spring of 2009, Earle's name began being mentioned specifically in context with a race for either Texas Attorney General or Texas Governor. Earle said he was considering a run for one of the two posts. On June 30, 2009, an Internet draft movement, DraftRonnie.com, was launched to urge Earle to run for Texas governor. The Draft Ronnie website and draft movement ended in September 2009, when Democrat Hank Gilbert entered the race for Texas Governor. On December 18, 2009, Earle filed the necessary paperwork to run for Lieutenant Governor of Texas but was defeated in the Democratic primary by Linda Chavez-Thompson, a labor union activist. She, in turn, was defeated in the general election by the incumbent Republican David Dewhurst in November 2010.

Girls were first admitted to Grade 12 in 1992 and were phased into the other grades beginning in the 1995‚Äì96 school year. Until recently, LCC was one of the few remaining schools with a covered outdoor ice hockey rink. This has been replaced by a new athletics centre, as well as a new arena. In addition to hockey, LCC has been known for fielding strong teams in Canadian football, soccer and basketball. Rugby was canceled in 2017 because it was deemed \\"too dangerous\\". LCC's traditional rival in sports and other matters is Selwyn House.Royal St. George's losing headmaster The annual tuition fees for attending LCC range from $18,695 to $23,845. The school also receives subsidies from the provincial government that is available to all private schools for Grades 7 to 11, which means all students in the high school section must have a certificate of eligibility allowing them to attend government-funded English schools in Quebec in accordance with Bill 101. History Lower Canada College was opened on Royal Avenue by Dr. Charles Fosbery on September 20, 1909. LCC can trace its roots to 1861, when the boarding school St. John's School was started by the Church of St John the Evangelist. Houses LCC, like many other Commonwealth schools, divides its students into houses. These eight houses are named after alumni. There is also one house specifically for Grade 12 students. They are: *Beveridge (Orange) *Claxton (Red) *Drummond (White) *French (Blue) *Harper (Green) *Heward (Black) *Russel (Grey) *Woods (Maroon) *Webster (Purple, Grade 12 house) It is an annual tradition for the eight houses to engage in \\"Shourawe\\", a spirited day dedicated to house competitions such as Tug of war. Prior to 2008, this day was known as \\"House Wars\\". However, the barbaric etymology of the term evoked backlash and pressure from parents, causing LCC to reconfigure the letters into a less belligerent anagram. Conversely, the Tug of war event has yet to be renamed as a politically correct euphemism. International Baccalaureate In 2013, LCC began implementing the International Baccalaureate programme for some students in its grade 11 class. They plan on extending the program to grade 12 in 2014. Currently, there are approximately 25 students in the IB programme. Admissions LCC receives subsidies from the provincial government and therefore abides by the French Language Charter, restricting enrolment of students to eligible parties specified in the charter.Valiante, Giuseppe. \\"Quebec's English private schools say admission rules limit access\\" (Archive).

It was in the middle of Summit County, bordering Akron and Cuyahoga Falls. No incorporated areas were formed within the township but Akron and Cuyahoga Falls expanded into Northamption via annexation. In 1986, Northampton Township merged with Cuyahoga Falls, the first time a township and city merged in Ohio. When created it occupied survey Town 3, Range 11 in the Western Reserve and was about in area. Its first settler, Simeon Prior named the township for the Hampshire County, Massachusetts village of Northampton. Geography Northampton was originally bounded by Portage Township on the south, Bath Township on the west, Boston Township to the north and Stow Township to the east. At the time of its merger with Cuyahoga Falls it was bordered by Akron to the south, the city of Stow to the east and Cuyahoga Falls to the southeast. History The Ottawa and Mingo tribes hunted in Northampton before Europeans arrived. (Grant, 1891). The first white settler in Northampton was Simeon Prior, who moved there with his wife and ten children from Northampton, Massachusetts in 1802. Native Americans still lived in the township and remained there until 1812 when American forces began to assemble there for the War of 1812. Northampton provided a rendezvous point for militia during the war and the two (Grant, 1891) or three (Doyle, 1908) vessels of Oliver Hazard Perry's fleet were built in the township and floated down the Cuyahoga River to Lake Erie. In 1986 Northampton merged with Cuyahoga Falls. Both Akron and Cuyahoga Falls had been annexing the southern part of the township. Also, a major portion of the township had been purchased by the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area (now the Cuyahoga Valley National Park), reducing the tax base. The residents of Northampton chose to join with Cuyahoga Falls so that their future would be settled. The township became Ward 8 in Cuyahoga Falls and kept special zoning to preserve some of its rural nature. Annexation of parts of Northampton by Akron had left an irregular border between the two communities, including several islands inside Akron. Akron and Cuyahoga Falls tried to work out a land swap to smooth out the borders. They came up with a plan but it was never approved. The two cities have a joint fire station, though, that covers part of both communities. =Counties= Northampton Township's land has been in the following counties: (Author unknown, 1999-2005) *1788 - Washington *1797 - Jefferson *1800 - Trumbull *1808 - Portage *1840 - Summit Transportation Northampton was served by Route 8, which originally went up Akron-Cleveland Road (now State Road). With Route 8 being moved to a divided highway to the east, the area is no longer served by any state highways. Schools The area of Northampton is mostly served by the Woodridge Local School District, with parts also served by the Revere Local School District. It is also served by the Cuyahoga Valley Joint Vocational School District.

World War II service  Mullany was originally Beatty (DD-528) but was renamed on 28 May 1941. Laid down 15 January 1942 by Bethlehem Steel Co., Union Plant, San Francisco, Calif., she was launched 10 October 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Elton W. Grenfell; and commissioned 23 April 1943, Commander Baron J. Mullaney in command. After shakedown and training off San Diego and escort duty in the Aleutians, Mullany joined the 7th Fleet in the southwest Pacific in December 1943. Her first action came 2 to 4 March 1944 when she protected minesweepers clearing the approaches to Seeadler Harbor, Admiralty Islands, prior to the amphibious landings on Los Negros, the island forming the northeastern side of the harbor. Attracting Japanese gunfire, Mullany silenced the Japanese harbor defenses with 5 inch fire, enabling the minesweepers to complete their vital mission. For the next 2 days Mullany fired to support American troops fighting ashore. Screening 7th Fleet flagship during the invasion of Leyte Gulf, Mullany fired to help drive off nine separate enemy air attacks from 20 to 29 October, then sailed for overhaul at San Francisco. After training near Hawaii in January 1945, she joined Task Force 54 (TF 54) for the invasion of Iwo Jima, to which she escorted troop transports. After firing in the preinvasion bombardment, she supported troops landing and fighting ashore, hitting caves and machinegun nests on Mount Suribachi 19 February. An antisubmarine picket guarding the Okinawa invasion force 6 April 1945, Mullany opened fire on a Japanese kamikaze plane at 17:45. A few seconds later the fighter was smoking from numerous hits, but somehow managed to stay together. Skipper Comdr. Albert O. Momm ordered the ship to turn out of the kamikaze's path, but couldn't get out of the way in time. The plane slammed into the after deckhouse. Before damage control parties could remove all the wounded from the twisted metal and exploding ammunition, the ship's depth charges exploded. In the next 20 minutes three more enemy aircraft attacked stricken Mullany. Her forward gunners downed two and drove the other away. An hour later, Momm received a report that the bulkhead of one of the aft magazines was hot and an explosion was apparently imminent. Many of the ship's officers had seen the disastrous consequences of a magazine explosion, and at 18:29 Momm gave the order to abandon ship. stood by to take on survivors while her rescue and assistance team continued to spray water on Mullany. The rescued 70 members of the Mullany crew from the water. The Execute then came alongside and helped fight the fires. In the next hours came alongside the burning ship and extinguished the flames. Since the expected explosion had been prevented by punctured fuel and water tanks flooding the compartments above the hot magazine, Commander Momm took a skeleton crew back aboard at 23:00. After the fires were extinguished the Execute attempted a tow using her sweep gear. At first the Mullany was in tow at low speed. With an increase in speed the sweep cable snapped and the tow attempt was discontinued. The Mullany crew then succeeded in lighting off one boiler, and Mullany limped off on one shaft for Pearl Harbor and San Francisco, arriving 29 May. Courage and determination had saved their ship, but 21 of her crew were killed, nine missing, and 36 wounded. Completely repaired, Mullany put to sea 25 September for the Panama Canal and duty with the Atlantic Fleet, until decommissioning 14 February 1946 to join the Reserve Fleet at Charleston, South Carolina  Post World War II service  Recommissioned 8 March 1951, Mullany rejoined the Atlantic Fleet and by January 1954 had made three deployments to the Mediterranean to join in the peace-keeping missions of the 6th Fleet. With her squadron, Destroyer Squadron 18 (DesRon 18), Mullany departed Newport, R.I. 1 December 1954 for San Diego, where the squadron was redesignated DesRon 21 for service in the Pacific Fleet. In the next 10 years, Mullany served eight times in the western Pacific with the 7th Fleet, joining in patrol and training operations essential to the protection of freedom in Asia. = Vietnam War = Veteran Mullany returned to combat during her ninth cruise to the coast of Asia, screening carrier in flight operations off Vietnam in 1965, as well as serving as harbor defense ship at Da Nang. On 6 July 1965, Mullany's five-inch guns were fired in anger for the first time since Okinawa. This time it was in support of the U.S. 7th Marine Regiment landing at Qui Nhon. During that cruise Mullany encountered the first known Soviet spy ship off the coast of Vietnam. The \\"Ivan\\",as Mullany's crew dubbed her, was disguised as a fishing vessel. Mullany \\"shadowed\\" the Ivan for several days, collecting vital intelligence before turning over the shadowing duty to a fleet tug. The following year she returned to the coast of Vietnam to seek out and destroy craft moving enemy supplies. From 20 to 30 November 1966, she destroyed 28 enemy watercraft and damaged 26 others with her 5 inch guns. She screened until sailing for San Diego in March 1967. Following an overhaul at Long Beach, Mullany spent the remainder of the year conducting refresher training and local operations off the coast of California. In February 1968, she once again deployed to the Western Pacific. On 24 April 1968 the positions of the 1st Battalion, 26th Marines at Wunder Beach were hit by 11-15 rounds of fire from the ship killing two Marines. On 9 July 1968, Mullany left Vietnamese waters for the last time. During 137 days at sea, she had steamed 46,468 miles, nearly twice around the earth. Over a career that spanned 25 years, she would have circumnavigated the globe more than 40 times. After a visit to Auckland, New Zealand, she returned to San Diego in September. Based in Long Beach, Mullany spent the next two years steaming up and down the West Coast as a reserve training ship. By 1971, Mullany was the oldest destroyer on active service. She was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register 6 October 1971, and sold to the Republic of China for $150,000, plus $3,000, \\"administrative charges.\\"  Awards  Mullany received seven battle stars for World War II service.

The current municipality of Chiusi (Tuscany) partly overlaps this Roman walled city. The Roman city remodeled an earlier Etruscan city, Clevsin, found in the territory of a prehistoric culture, possibly also Etruscan or proto-Etruscan. The site is located in northern central Italy on the west side of the Apennines. Location Chiusi is situated on a hill above the valley of the Clanis river near lake Clusium, both of which features had those names in antiquity. The Clanis is part of the Tiber drainage system and was navigable by boat from there. Rome was also accessed by the via Cassia, which was built over an Etruscan road. History By the time it appears in Livy's History, it is already a major Etruscan city being petitioned for assistance against the republican partisans of ancient Rome. About its life prior to that time, Livy only makes a brief statement that it was once called Camars.Liv. 10.25.11.2 http://latin.packhum.org/loc/914/1/508/1773-1779 Different theories exist of the city's origin. Villanovan pottery has been found at Chiusi. One common type is a cinerary urn dating to the 8th century BC. These urns are in the shape of wattle-and-daub huts with thatched roofs, presumably the homes of the deceased. This style of architecture is so different from classical Etruscan that many Etruscologists have denied a continuity. On the other hand, it is clear that the people of the region received a strong impetus from Greek colonies such as Cumae and from Greek immigration. The minority theory is currently the Proto-Italic. In this theory, Etruscans from the coast or from the Aegean resettled and renamed an Umbrian city called Camars, which the exponents believe means \\"marshland\\" in Italic. On enclosing the city with a wall they changed the name to \\"enclosure\\", using an Etruscanized form, Clevsin, of the perfect passive participle, clusus, of Latin cludere, \\"to close\\". Clevsin and Camars are more comfortable in their Etruscan milieu as Etruscan words. The limited known Etruscan vocabulary includes camthi, the name of a magistracy, which might be segmented cam-thi, where ‚Äìthi is a known locative ending. Ar, -arasi, -aras are plural endings of different cases. A cleva is an offering. S and -isi are genitive and dative endings. A place of magistracies or offerings is entirely harmonious with Etruscan culture and the uses of a regional capital city. The final resolution of the question waits for more evidence. It is believed that Clusium joined the Etruscan League of twelve cities in the 600s BC. The site of ancient Clusium was reoccupied in Roman and later times, obscuring and obliterating much of the Etruscan layers. For example, the ancient sources describe the tomb of Lars Porsena at Clusium as well as the sacking and levelling of the city by Sulla. Much of what remains are its tombs and its underground passages, some of which might have been associated with the monument to Porsena. Lars Porsena was king of Clusium in 508 BC. Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, formerly king of Rome, had been expelled along with his family from Rome in 509 BC. He had sought to regain the throne, firstly by the Tarquinian conspiracy and secondly by force of arms. Both attempts had been unsuccessful, the conspiracy having been discovered, and Tarquin's army having been defeated at the Battle of Silva Arsia. Bucchero Ware Tarquin convinced Lars Porsena to lead his army against Rome. The war between Clusium and Rome followed, during which Porsena besieged Rome. The siege and the war ended with a peace treaty, by which Porsena received hostages from Rome and returned to Veii lands that had previously been taken by Rome. In 507 BC Rome's hostages and lands were restored, and peace between Rome and Porsena was cemented. Tarquinius was not restored to the Roman throne.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 2.9-15 In 508 BC, after the siege of Rome, Porsena split his forces and sent part of the Clusian army with his son Aruns to besiege the Latin city of Aricia. The Clusians besieged Aricia; however the Aricians sent for assistance from the Latin League and from Cumae, and the Clusian army was defeated in battleLivy, Ab urbe condita, 2.14 Pliny the Elder wrote that a magnificent tomb was built for Porsena; a large mausoleum surrounded by cascades of pyramids over a labyrinth of underground chambers in which an intruder could get lost. Pliny never saw this tomb, so his description was based on a report from Varro and perhaps a conflated comparison to the Minoan labyrinths he describes before this tomb. Large-size tumuli of the late archaic period were built at Chiusi, and modern scholars have tried to associate these (especially Poggio Gaiella) with the legendary tomb of Porsena. In 2004 Professor of Urban Restoration Giuseppe Centauro suggested that the traditional location of Clusium at Chiusi is wrong and that it is near Florence.\\"Lost Italian City dug up in Tuscany\\" The Sunday Times 18 April 2004 As of 2008 he was trying to raise money and get permission to excavate.\\"Sotto Prato dorme una citt√† etrusca\\" In the early 4th century BC (391 BC according to Varronian chronology) it was besieged by Gauls, and the Clusines called upon Rome to intermediate. However, in the following negotiations, one of the Roman delegates, of the gens Fabia, killed a Gallic leader. When the Romans refused to hand over the Fabii and in fact appointed two members of the family as consuls for the next year, the enraged Gauls broke up their siege and under the leadership of Brennus they marched onto and subsequently sacked Rome.

The stadium no longer exists, having been demolished and replaced by a new headquarters building for Network Rail. The Stadium was used by England Hockey as their national stadium from 1995 to 2003 and then as a professional football stadium, first for Wimbledon F.C., then Milton Keynes Dons F.C.. In summer 2007, the Dons relocated to the Stadium mk, their new stadium near Bletchley leaving the hockey stadium without a tenant. From then until late 2009 (when demolition began in preparation for the site to be redeveloped), the ground remained unused. In July 2012, the new Network Rail headquarters on the site became operational. Hockey The stadium was built in 1995 as a new national field hockey stadium, with a synthetic pitch. The ground was used for national and international (field) hockey until 2003. It had a covered main stand running the full length of one side of the pitch, opposite which was an unroofed stand running about one third of the length of the pitch, straddling the halfway line. In 1997, the stadium was used as the venue for the sixth edition of the FIH Men's Junior World Cup. It was also the venue, in 2000, for the FIH Women's Qualifying Tournament for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. In 2003, when the ground was leased to Wimbledon F.C., a grass pitch was laid, meaning that the stadium was out of commission for hockey. Temporary stands were added at either end of the pitch. Hockey internationals and playoff matches were reallocated to various leading club grounds around the country. In May 2007, at the end of the lease, the temporary stands were removed. On 2 April 2007 the trustees of the National Hockey Foundation, which owned the lease of the stadium, announced that they had arranged to hand the lease back to English Partnerships since a detailed study had shown that the stadium would no longer be viable as a hockey venue particularly in light of the building of another hockey facility in Stratford, London, as part of the 2012 Olympics facilities.

The language extends classical process algebras such as Milner's CCS and Hoare's CSP by introducing probabilistic branching and timing of transitions. Rates are drawn from the exponential distribution and PEPA models are finite-state and so give rise to a stochastic process, specifically a continuous-time Markov process (CTMC). Thus the language can be used to study quantitative properties of models of computer and communication systems such as throughput, utilisation and response time as well as qualitative properties such as freedom from deadlock. The language is formally defined using a structured operational semantics in the style invented by Gordon Plotkin. As with most process algebras, PEPA is a parsimonious language. It has only four combinators, prefix, choice, co-operation and hiding. Prefix is the basic building block of a sequential component: the process (a, r).P performs activity a at rate r before evolving to behave as component P. Choice sets up a competition between two possible alternatives: in the process (a, r).P + (b, s).Q either a wins the race (and the process subsequently behaves as P) or b wins the race (and the process subsequently behaves as Q). The co- operation operator requires the two \\"co-operands\\" to join for those activities which are specified in the co-operation set: in the process P < a, b> Q the processes P and Q must co-operate on activities a and b, but any other activities may be performed independently. The reversed compound agent theorem gives a set of sufficient conditions for a co-operation to have a product form stationary distribution. Finally, the process P/{a} hides the activity a from view (and prevents other processes from joining with it). Syntax Given a set of action names, the set of PEPA processes is defined by the following BNF grammar: :P ::= (a,\\\\lambda).P\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,  \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,P + Q\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,  \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,P\\\\stackrel{\\\\triangleright \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\! \\\\triangleleft}{\\\\scriptstyle{L}}Q\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,  \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,P/L\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,A The parts of the syntax are, in the order given above ; action : the process (a,\\\\lambda).P can perform an action a at rate \\\\lambda and continue as the process P. ; choice : the process P+Q may behave as either the process P or the process Q. ; cooperation : processes P and Q exist simultaneously and behave independently for actions whose names do not appear in L. For actions whose names appear in L, the action must be carried out jointly and a race condition determines the time this takes. ; hiding : the process P behaves as usual for action names not in L, and performs a silent action \\\\tau for action names that appear in L. ; process identifier : write A \\\\overset{\\\\underset{\\\\mathrm{def}}{}}{=} P to use the identifier A to refer to the process P.

Blanshard was born in London to a wealthy mercantile family, and after reading law at Cambridge University, served in the army in British India. At the age of 32, a personal connection helped secure Blanshard the post of colonial governor of Vancouver Island. Although the commission was dated in July, 1849, Blanshard did not arrive in the colony's capital of Fort Victoria until March of the following year. Blanshard's short tenure proved unhappy from the start, largely because of the enormous power and influence wielded by the Hudson's Bay Company and its autocratic Chief Factor, James Douglas. Indeed, prior to Blanshard's appointment, there had been serious consideration given by the colonial office to appointing Douglas governor, but concerns over conflict of interest prevented it. Blanshard arrived to a colony in which the land had been given as a ten-year lease to the Hudson's Bay Company, with Douglas given a mandate to attract settlement. Almost the entire non-First Nations population were Company employees, answerable to Douglas, and Blanshard was prevented from setting up a colonial assembly by the fact that so few of them met the qualifications of electors, i.e., land ownership. Inevitable jurisdictional conflicts arose between Douglas and Blanshard, and the colonial office, too, took Blanshard to task for indiscriminate retributions taken against the First Nations population near present-day Port Hardy. The absence of any real power, combined with health concerns and the enormous cost of living drove Blanshard to resign; he abandoned the colony in September, 1851 after just one and a half years there. Blanshard evidently did not pursue further colonial service. He married and inherited his family's estates in Essex and Hampshire. He died in London at the age of 76.

Early life  Hacking spent his first six years living in a house that used to be owned by his grandparents, in the Gerrard Street and Victoria Park Avenue area of Scarborough, Ontario. When he was six his family \\"moved out to 'Scarberia',\\" he would jokingly say. Hacking described most of Scarborough at that time as a \\"sea of mud\\". \\"There was nothing but pollywogs and field mice and there was even a chicken farm on the corner of Kennedy and Lawrence.\\" Of his father, Hacking said \\"My old man was AWOL pretty early in life. He left when I was six.\\" He described his mother Kathy as a \\"saint\\"..  Musical career  After attending Winston Churchill Collegiate Institute, Hacking started performing while a student at Scarborough College (a campus of the University of Toronto), where he graduated as an English major. His career as a musician began when a representative from the student council, who had heard him play, asked him to perform at a concert. \\"I said, 'You're crazy, are you out of your mind.' And he said '50 bucks, six songs...' You got me. I got up and nobody threw anything. In fact, several women who wouldn't normally speak to me came up after the gig and were cluttering about how they liked the music. And I said, 'Wow, this is good.'\\" He then accepted an invitation to play the pub two weeks later, which he did with a lead guitar accompanist. \\"By the end of the night you couldn't hear yourself playing, it was so loud. And the table in front of the stage, they had been playing euchre all night and screaming and yelling, and they all got up in unison and mooned the stage. I said, 'OK, so that's how it is'.\\" Hacking would eventually become a regular at various establishments in Toronto. The recordings of early performances in 1976 and 1977 became his first solo album, Norm Hacking Live (1977). Critically acclaimed albums Cut Roses (1980) and Stubborn Ghost (1988) followed, and led to many festival and concert appearances. A video of the song \\"Sammy\\", from the album Cut Roses, aired on The Nashville Network. Upon becoming the single caregiving parent to his young son Ben, however, he cut back on touring. In 1996, with his son now a teen, Hacking released a greatest hits album with four new songs, Skysongs... A Writer's Collection, and returned to more active performing. In 1996, and again in 1997, he was artistic director of the Caledon Folk Festival. A group of Canadian and American songwriters recorded 18 of his songs for a tribute album, One Voice: A Tribute to Norm Hacking, Vol. 1, in 2001. Wayne Marshall of Three Flamingos Music initiated the project. The performers on the album included Michael Peter Smith, Alan Rhody, Mikel Miller, Roger James, Nancy White, Chris Whiteley, Ron Nigrini, Jory Nash, Slowpoke, Jason Fowler and many others. Hacking released I Am The Night, a collection of 33 original spoken word selections ‚Äì poetry, prose, and lyrics ‚Äì in 2005. Richard Christy, of the Kingston Whig-Standard, described each piece as \\"a very real slice of life. They are easy to relate to yet are neither simple nor boring... Hacking, like John Steinbeck, understands the depths of very simple situations and the simplicity of very complicated events.\\" On October 4, 2006, Hacking's mother Kathy died, with Norm at her side. He had spent most of his time since July with her at Scarborough Grace Hospital. Her death came as a profound emotional blow to Hacking, whose health deteriorated noticeably in the last few months, friends said. Along with performing, in 1992 Hacking started writing a column, Racetrack Hack, for Taxinews, a monthly publication for and about Toronto's taxi industry.  Death  A chronic leg infection limited his mobility in his final years. Norm Hacking died in his sleep from an apparent heart attack in his home on the night of November 25, 2007. \\"What I admired most about Norm and his songs are their realness, their honesty,\\" said Chris Whiteley. \\"He made no excuses and his songs were those of a hopeless romantic. His best work was filled with a sense of wonder, and I hope those songs will be around for a long time for others to sing.\\"  Discography  1977: Norm Hacking Live * 1980: Cut Roses * 1988: Stubborn Ghost * 1993: A Day in the Studio * 1996: Skysongs: A Writer's Collection * 1999: The Ache * 2003: Orange Cats Make the Very Best Friends (with Kirk Elliot) * 2005: I Am The Night * 2005: When Cats Go Wrong (with Cynthia Nugent; includes book , publisher: Raincoast Books) References External links Official Website 1950 births 2007 deaths Canadian folk singer-songwriters Canadian male singer-songwriters Musicians from Toronto People from Scarborough, Toronto 20th-century Canadian singers 20th-century male singers ","title":"Norm Hacking"},{"id":"1831689","text":"Van den Berg is a Dutch-language toponymic surname meaning \\"of/from the mountain/slope\\".

Set in 1066 Northumbria, before the Battle of Stamford Bridge, the serial has the time traveller the First Doctor (William Hartnell) and his travelling companions Steven Taylor (Peter Purves) and Vicki (Maureen O'Brien) attempting to outwit the time traveller the Monk (Peter Butterworth), who is plotting to change the course of European history by wiping out King Harald Hardrada's invasion fleet with neutron bombs before the fleet faces King Harold Godwinson at Stamford Bridge. Plot The First Doctor and Vicki find Steven Taylor aboard the TARDIS after he stumbled in during a disorientated state on Mechanus (The Chase). The TARDIS lands on a rocky beach and the Doctor establishes the century from a discarded Viking helmet and heads off to the village. Steven and Vicki explore the cliffs above, witnessed by a monk. The TARDIS is soon after spotted by a Saxon villager, Eldred, who runs to tell the headman of his village, Wulnoth. The Doctor encounters Edith, Wulnoth's wife, and convinces her he is a harmless traveller, while probing for more information. He finds out it is 1066, since Harold Godwinson is on the throne and has not yet faced Harald Hardrada at Stamford Bridge let alone William the Conqueror in the Battle of Hastings. At a nearby monastery, monks are heard chanting. The Doctor finds a gramophone playing the chant, and heads off towards a nearby monastery, where a mysterious monk traps the Doctor in a cell. Steven and Vicki encounter Eldred and notice he has a wristwatch, which the Monk had dropped earlier. They spend the night in a clearing, and the next morning are ambushed by the Saxons and taken to the village council. They convince Wulnoth they are but travellers, and are given provisions to travel on. Vicki is heartened to hear from Edith that the Doctor passed by her hut on his way to the monastery. Steven and Vicki visit the monastery, where the Monk tries to dissuade them from entering but gives himself away by describing the Doctor too accurately. Steven and Vicki decide he must be a prisoner inside. They break in after dark. The Monk sees a Viking ship on the horizon. The Vikings land, and two small groups are sent to search the area. A Viking finds and attacks Edith, and the Saxons go hunting for the invaders. The Vikings are drunk; the giant that attacked Edith is cut down. His companions, Sven and Ulf, flee. Eldred has been badly wounded, and Wulnoth takes him to the monastery for help. While the Monk is occupied with the Saxons, Steven and Vicki find the gramophone. They then leave the monastery via a secret passage. Steven and Vicki have found that the TARDIS has been submerged beneath the incoming tide. They resolve to return to the monastery to look for the Doctor. The Doctor has escaped by the same passage himself, and returns to the Saxon village. He soon hears of the Viking scouting party, and decides to head back to the monastery to track down Steven and Vicki. The Doctor gains the upper hand when the Monk answers the door and believes he is being held at gunpoint. The Monk is being questioned by the Doctor when they are overpowered by Sven and Ulf. In the ensuing confrontation the Monk slips away, leaving the Doctor the Vikings' prisoner. The Doctor knocks out Sven, and elsewhere the Monk does the same to Ulf. The Monk uses his freedom to persuade the villagers to light beacon fires on the cliff tops, telling them that he is expecting materials by sea, when in fact he wishes to lure the Viking fleet to land. Wulnoth agrees to light the fires, but does not do so as he realises the danger. Steven and Vicki return to the monastery via the secret passage and investigate the crypt, where a heavy power cable emanates from a sarcophagus. Looking inside, they discover that it is the Monk's TARDIS, and that he must have come from the same place as the Doctor. The Monk has returned to the monastery and is once more under the Doctor's control. He reveals his plan is to lure the Vikings to the coast and destroy the fleet. This would shore up King Harold to such an extent he would not then lose the Battle of Hastings. The Monk is a Time Meddler. The Doctor denounces the Monk for seeking to alter history, and forces him to reveal his TARDIS, where they find Steven and Vicki. Rejoined, the time travellers piece together the Monk's plot, which the Monk insists is intended to stabilise England and benefit Western civilisation. Ulf and Sven have formed an alliance with the Monk, and have tied up the Doctor's party while the three of them take the neutron bomb shells down to the cannon on the beach. The scheme is foiled, however, when Wulnoth and the Saxons arrive and engage the fleeing Vikings in a nearby clearing, killing Sven and Ulf in battle. The Monk hides while the fighting rages, little knowing that the Doctor and his friends have been freed by Edith and are tampering with his TARDIS. With his scheme in ruins, the Monk decides to leave and returns to his TARDIS, though the Doctor left a note assuring the Monk his meddling days are ended. When the Monk looks inside he realises the Doctor has taken the dimensional control and that the interior of his ship has shrunk beyond use, leaving him stranded in 1066. The tide having gone out, the Doctor and his friends are free to leave. Production The working title for this story was The Monk. The Time Meddler is the first example of what is known in Doctor Who as the 'pseudo-historical' or 'ahistorical' story, which is one that uses the past as a setting for a science fiction story, as opposed to the pure historical stories, which are set in the past but have no science-fictional elements attached to them besides the presence of the regular characters and the TARDIS. During production of this story, new producer John Wiles began taking over production duties. William Hartnell, displeased at the number of changes undergoing the production, play-acted throwing a temper tantrum during the rehearsal of this story. Footage of the Viking ship was taken from a BBC Newsreel item about a Viking recreation on the south coast of England. In the remastered DVD version this footage is restored from the original film, and the complete item appears on the DVD extras. Episodes 1, 3, and 4 were reported missing from the BBC Film and Videotape Library following an audit in 1978 (see Doctor Who missing episodes). Edited telerecordings of all four episodes were returned to the BBC from Nigeria in 1985, and complete copies of episodes 1 and 3 were returned in 1992. 12 seconds from episode 4, depicting an act of violence, remains missing from the otherwise complete prints of all four episodes, as it was removed by censors. The 2008 Region 2 DVD release includes as an extra, called The Missing 12 Seconds, the audio for this missing sequence with original script excerpts and explanatory text ‚Äì it appears that the two Vikings were seen on screen to be run through by the sword-wielding Saxons via the use of dummies. =Cast notes= William Hartnell does not appear in episode 2 as he was on holiday. A pre-taped recording of his voice is played when the Doctor is locked in a cell. Alethea Charlton also appeared in An Unearthly Child (1963) as the cavewoman, Hur. Broadcast and reception The serial was repeated on BBC2 in January 1992 on consecutive Fridays ‚Äì 03/01/92 to 24/01/92 at 7.20pm/6.50pm, as part of a season of stories to represent each of the (then) seven Doctors' adventures. The repeat achieved ratings of 2.37, 2.79, 2.58 and 2.63 million viewers respectively. Reviewing the serial in 2009, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times described it as \\"an utter delight\\", praising Butterworth and the direction. The A.V. Club reviewer Christopher Bahn was positive towards the concept of the Monk and the introduction of Steven. He also noted that it \\"keeps things moving despite its relatively simple plotline, a testament both to Dennis Spooner's script and Douglas Camfield's direction\\". Johnathan Wilkins, writing for Dreamwatch, described The Time Meddler as \\"an often forgotten gem\\" with good performances all around. However, he did note that the \\"weakest element\\" was perhaps the \\"stereotypical\\" local villagers. IGN's Arnold T Blumburg gave the serial a score of 7 out of 10, highlighting the chemistry between Hartnell and Butterworth, the competency of Vicki and Steven, and the visual atmosphere. Despite this, he noted that there were a few clich√©s in the plotting and, unlike Bahn, felt that it was \\"definitely a slow-paced story\\". Simon Brew of Den of Geek gave The Time Meddler a rating of three out of five, feeling that it \\"really hits its stride\\" with the sparring between the Doctor and the Monk, but ultimately the story was not enough to cover four episodes. Commercial releases =In print= A novelisation of this serial, written by Nigel Robinson, was published by Target Books in October 1987. =Home media= The story was released on VHS in November 2002. On 4 February 2008, it was released on DVD. The quality of the surviving prints of the later episodes was deemed low enough that the typical VidFIRE process was not applied to the story. The DVD was dedicated to the late Verity Lambert.

It was first broadcast in four weekly parts from 11 September to 2 October 1965. In this serial, the Doctor (William Hartnell) and his travelling companions Steven (Peter Purves) and Vicki (Maureen O'Brien) arrive on an arid planet within the titular Galaxy 4, where they encounter the beautiful but dangerous Drahvins and the hideous but friendly Rills, two crash landed species in conflict with one another. Both species wish to escape, but the Drahvin leader Maaga (Stephanie Bidmead) only wants for her people to make it out alive. Only the third episode (\\"Air Lock\\") is held in the BBC archives, and the other three remain missing. Plot The First Doctor, Vicki and Steven Taylor arrive on an eerily silent planet and encounter curious short and squat non-humanoid robots which resemble three domes stacked on top of each other, and Vicki decides to call the blind, beeping metre-tall machines \\"Chumbleys\\" because of what she calls the \\"chumbley\\" way they move. The TARDIS crew are still trying to decide whether the Chumbleys are hostile or not when one is disabled by an all-female party of cloned blonde Drahvin warriors from the planet Drahva in Galaxy 4. It is revealed that the unknown planet they are on is also in Galaxy 4 but is not given a name. The Drahvins are dominated by their cruel leader, Maaga, who treats her simple-minded subordinates with bullying contempt. The Drahvins are at war with the reptilian Rills, the masters of the Chumbleys, and both races have crashed spaceships on this planet. The planet will be destroyed in 14 planetary cycles and, with the Drahvin ship irreparable, Maaga and her warriors are keen to capture the Rill ship, which they believe has been made functional again. Maaga paints a picture of the Drahvins as the attacked species in the scenario, but the Doctor has witnessed some of the Drahvin aggression and is clearly not convinced. He also reworks the probability on the planet's destruction and calculates it will break up in just two days' time. The Doctor tries to keep this new finding from the Drahvins, but Maaga reveals her true colours and forces the truth from him at the point of a gun. With Steven held as hostage to ensure their co-operation, the Doctor and Vicki are sent by the Drahvins to try to seize control of the Rill ship. The Doctor works out that the ammonia- breathing Rills are a very advanced species: when he meets one he is impressed, not least by their species' use of telepathy. The huge and impressive, horned warthog-like Rill explains that they have offered to take the Drahvins away with them but Maaga has refused, preferring to maintain a state of war. The Doctor tells the Rills of the true life remaining in the planet and promises to help them escape, since the solar energy converters on the Rill craft have not gathered enough power to effect a lift-off. The Doctor and Vicki return to the Drahvin ship to find Steven unconscious after Maaga has tried to kill him by leaving him in a depressurised airlock. They all return to the Rill vessel, where the Doctor successfully develops a power converter linked to the TARDIS, which charges the Rill craft. Maaga leads the Drahvins in a final assault but the Chumbleys defend their ship long enough for it to power up and leave the planet. One Chumbley left behind to aid the time travellers helps them get back to the TARDIS. Once the ship leaves, the planet explodes, with the Drahvins perishing on the dying world. The story ends with a lead in to \\"Mission to the Unknown\\" with Vicki looking at a planet, and wondering what is happening on it. The action then switches to the planet, where Jeff Garvey in a jungle is repeating \\"I must kill\\". Production The working title for this story was The Chumbleys. Different resources alternatively spell out the numeral in the title: Galaxy Four. The BBC no longer holds the complete serial in its archives, although on 11 December 2011 it was announced that episode 3, \\"Air Lock\\", had been discovered earlier that year among material bought by former ITV engineer Terry Burnett; however, due to a break in the film, the last 27 seconds of action and the closing credits are all missing from the print. Additionally, almost six minutes' worth of footage from episode 1, \\"Four Hundred Dawns\\", is held in the archive thanks to a 1977 documentary entitled Whose Doctor Who‚Äîalthough only 30 seconds were eventually used, the footage that was discarded was kept by Jan Vincent-Rudzki, then-president of the Doctor Who Appreciation Society, who acted as a technical advisor on the documentary programme, and who returned the footage he had kept to the BBC in the 1990s. Broadcast and reception Episode is missing The ratings for this story ranged from 9 million viewers for episode one to a peak of 11.3 million viewers for episode three. Radio Times reviewer Patrick Mulkern thought the story was \\"By no means a classic\\" but did have \\"sparks of originality\\". Mulkern considered it to be \\"an entertaining if pedestrian beginning\\" to season 3. Ian Levine claimed that the Doctor Who Appreciation Society obtained legal permission to privately screen this serial at a convention in 1978, only to find that the BBC had junked the episodes about three weeks prior. Later research subsequently showed this to be mistaken, as the DWAS never held any agreement to show the serial, and BBC Enterprises appear to have junked at least one of the episodes by the end of 1976. Commercial releases =In print= A novelisation of this serial, written by William Emms, was published by Target Books in November 1985, entitled Galaxy Four. The script of this serial was published by Titan Books in July 1994, edited by John McElroy, here entitled Galaxy 4. At the time of printing, the only audio recording known to exist was a poor-quality copy of the second episode \\"Trap of Steel\\" which had several parts completely inaudible. = Home media = The existing clip from \\"Four Hundred Dawns\\" was featured in the documentary The Missing Years, which was released on VHS in 1998 and on DVD (as part of the Lost in Time box set) in 2004.

This reconstruction carries a copyright date of 2007 and had been originally prepared for the DVD of The Time Meddler, before episode 3 was rediscovered. The soundtrack for the serial is intact and was released commercially in 2002, with linking narration provided by Peter Purves.

He is sometimes called \\"Robert Johnson II\\" to distinguish him from an earlier Scottish composer. Johnson worked with William Shakespeare providing music for some of his later plays. Early life \\"Deare doe not your faire beuty wronge\\" by Johnson as it appears in the manuscript Drexel 4175the only song in the collection with authorial attribution (at bottom right) Robert Johnson was the son of John Johnson, who was lutenist to Elizabeth I. In 1594 Robert's father died, and in 1596 he joined the household of George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon as an apprentice. Robert is assumed to have been around 13 at the time, as this was a typical age to begin an apprenticeship, but his date of birth is not known. Carey and his wife Elizabeth Spencer were patrons of the lutenist and composer John Dowland, who dedicated various compositions to them. The family had a London house (in Blackfriars) and a country home Hunsdon House (in Hunsdon, Hertfordshire), which partially survives. Johnson joined the Carey household at an interesting time in their patronage of the arts. In 1597 Dowland dedicated his First book of songs and ayres to George Carey.Charles Nicholl, \\"The Lodger: Shakespeare on Silver Street\\", Penguin Books. As well as supporting musicians, Carey was patron of a theatre company to which William Shakespeare belonged. In 1596/7 the company was briefly known as \\"Baron Hunsdon's Men\\", but is better known as the Lord Chamberlain's Men (the name they used after Carey became Lord Chamberlain in 1597), or their subsequent name, the King's Men. It is not known whether Johnson worked with this theatre company on any of their productions in the 1590s, such as The Merry Wives of Windsor. However, he certainly provided music for the King's Men in a later stage of his career. Employment at court Johnson's patron George Carey died in 1603. The following year Johnson found work at the court of James I where a number of lutenists were employed. Lutes came in various sizes and Johnson may have specialised in the bass lute when playing in consort music. Johnson was lutenist to Prince Henry (until the prince's death in 1612).Robert Johnson, Here of a Sunday Morning (www.hoasm.org). He composed music for the masques and entertainments which were popular at court in the Jacobean era. For example, he wrote music for Oberon, the Faery Prince in which Prince Henry took the title role. He also served at the court of Charles I, remaining on the royal payroll until 1633, the year of his death.Matthew Spring, ‚ÄòJohnson, Robert (c.1583‚Äì1633)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2009 accessed 17 June 2015 (subscription or UK public library membership required) Compositions for the King's Men Johnson's surviving compositions for the King's Men theatrical company have been dated to 1610‚Äì1617. During these years the King's Men were producing plays by Shakespeare and other playwrights such as Ben Jonson, Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher. Johnson's main claim to fame is that he composed the original settings for some of Shakespeare's lyrics, the best- known being probably those from The Tempest: \\"Where the Bee Sucks\\" and \\"Full Fathom Five\\". He is the only composer known to have composed the original settings of Shakespeare's lyrics. While other contemporary settings of Shakespeare's lyrics exist, for example those by Thomas Morley, they have not been proved to be connected to a stage performance. =Johnson and the Blackfriars Theatre= From 1608 the King's Men company was using the Blackfriars Theatre as its winter base, and this may have influenced the songs and instrumental music required from Johnson. The Blackfriars Theatre, which had previously been used by a company of acting/singing children, offered increased scope for incidental music compared to the Globe Theatre. One difference between the theatres was that Blackfriars was an indoors venue, lit by candles which needed to be replaced between acts. It featured music between acts, a practice which the induction to Marston's The Malcontent (published 1604) indicates was not common in the public theatres at that time. Shakespeare¬¥s The Tempest (circa 1610), in which the stage directions call for music and sound effects, is an example of a play which may have been written for performance at Blackfriars.Gurr, Andrew (1989). \\"The Tempest's Tempest at Blackfriars\\". Shakespeare Survey. Shakespeare Survey (Cambridge University Press) 41: 91‚Äì102. doi:10.1017/CCOL0521360714.009. . However, the company continued to perform at The Globe, and other venues such as the court, where Johnson's theatre music would presumably also have been heard.

It has a population of about 74,100 and it's the center of the Al-Qa'im District. The river water at Al- Qa'im carries less salt and mineral, so that it takes significantly less water to sustainably produce crops here than farther downstream, where more gallons of water must be used to avoid salinity. The Al-Qa'im border crossing connects Al-Qaim to close city Abu Kamal in Syria. Pre-war history In the early 20th century, there was a khan (caravanserai) and police station in Al-Qa'im, but no village. The khan was built in 1907 and was the residence of a local administrator. The surrounding area was inhabited by Arabs from the Karablah and Jara'if tribes. Al-Qa'im was reportedly the site of Iraq's refined uranium ore production from 1984 through 1990. The officially named \\"Chemical Fertilizer Complex\\" was originally built by Belgian contractors in January 1976, and by 1982 it was processing Phosphate from the nearby Akashat mine. That year, Iraq decided to build a uranium extraction facility on the same site, and hired Belgian contractors Mebshem to build the structure, completed in 1984. Unused uranium from Al-Qa'im was stored in nearby Tuwaitha. The production facility was completely destroyed during a 1991 US bombing campaign during the Gulf War. Iraq War In the Iraq War, Qa'im was a center of attacks by the Iraqi insurgency against US military personnel at the nearby military base of Camp Gannon. The U.S. military regarded Qa'im as the entry point for foreign fighters into Iraq and viewed it as a strategically important point. It was reported by Newsweek in 2003 that American soldiers stationed in the border city entered Syria. During the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment's control, a photojournalist embedded to the unit documented the city's events, and his photos were used in Time and Newsweek. A more candid article titled \\"Iraq's a Wild West\\" appeared in the September 2003 issue of Maxim. In November 2003, the 3rd Cavalry conducted the highly successful and largely peaceful Operation Rifles Blitz. During the operation the city was sectioned into three portions and searched house-to-house over a two-week period. Large numbers of weapons and suspected insurgents were captured during the operation, but some ill will was earned during the operation since it prevented Ramadan celebrations from taking place that year. In March 2004, the 3rd ACR conducted a turnover with the 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines (3/7) of the 1st Marine Division. 3/7 served in Al Qa'im from March until September 2004. Shortly after the turnover was complete, the enemy launched a sustained offensive throughout the country, attempting to take advantage of the relative inexperience of the new force. This would become a common tactic as the war continued, but caught many units by surprise that spring. In Al Qa'im, the activity heated up during April 2004 until the day of the battalion's pivotal battle on April 17. Although reports of enemy casualties are always difficult to quantify, the Marines likely killed 80 insurgents in the town of Husaybah that day, including foreign fighters. Five Marines from 3/7 were also killed in the battle. Units from every company in the battalion were engaged in Husaybah before the day was over. On April 7, 2005, Iraqi insurgents captured the city, forcing the local police and US-supported Iraqi Soldiers to abandon the city. U.S. Marines launched several offensives in order to root out the insurgents and retake the city. On May 8, 2005, Marines launched the week-long Operation Matador to flush insurgents out of Qa'im. They faced stiff resistance from both local Iraqi fighters and foreign fighters, but succeeded. According to local residents, Qa'im remained largely under the control of the insurgents. Along with towns like Haditha, they imposed a Taliban-like law, in which Western music, clothing, and hairstyles are banned. In early September 2005, it was reported that a sign posted outside the town stated \\"Welcome to the Islamic Republic of Qa'im\\". In 2006 Qa'im, like many cities in the Anbar province, was believed to still be under insurgent dominance. The primary economic activity of Qa'im was smuggling. Damage from previous battles has somewhat depressed the local economy. Post-Iraq War =ISIL control= U.S. Army 3rd Cavalry Regiment soldiers fire M777 howitzers into Syria from Firebase Saham, al-Qa'im, 2 December 2018. Qa'im was under the control of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant from August 2014 to November 2017. In November 2014, unconfirmed reports indicated ISIS caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was travelling there and a coalition airstrike left him critically injured. On 7 December 2016, an Iraqi Air Force airstrike at the town left 100 people dead including ISIS militants and civilians. It also injured another 100 people. By November 2017, Al-Qa'im was one of the last towns still under control of ISIL. In the 2017 Western Iraq campaign, the Iraqi government advanced south of the city and by the end of October had reached its outskirts. They entered Al-Qa'im on 3 November 2017. =Control by Kata'ib Hezbollah= After the eviction of ISIL forces, the Iraqi-based and Iranian-backed militia Kata'ib Hezbollah, a group under the Popular Mobilization Units (PMU), and which is closely linked to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, has played an important military and security role on the Iraqi side of the border.Rees, Sebastian.

It focuses on concepts that are universally applicable to human existence including death, freedom, responsibility, and the meaning of life. Instead of regarding human experiences such as anxiety, alienation and depression as implying the presence of mental illness, existential psychotherapy sees these experiences as natural stages in a normal process of human development and maturation. In facilitating this process of development and maturation, existential psychotherapy involves a philosophical exploration of an individual's experiences stressing the individual's freedom and responsibility to facilitate a higher degree of meaning and well-being in his or her life. Background The philosophers who are especially pertinent to the development of existential psychotherapy are those whose works were directly aimed at making sense of human existence. For example, the fields of phenomenology and existential philosophy are especially and directly responsible for the generation of existential therapy. The starting point of existential philosophy (see Warnock 1970; Macquarrie 1972; Mace 1999; Van Deurzen and Kenward 2005) can be traced back to the nineteenth century and the works of S√∏ren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche. Their works conflicted with the predominant ideologies of their time and committed to the exploration of reality as it can be experienced in a passionate and personal manner. =S√∏ren Kierkegaard (1813‚Äì1855)= Soren Kierkegaard (1813‚Äì1855) protested vehemently against popular misunderstanding and abuse of Christian dogma and the so-called 'objectivity' of science (Kierkegaard, 1841, 1844).Dryden,Windy. 2007. Dryden's Handbook of Individual Therapy 5th ed. London: SAGE Publications, pp. 196 He thought that both were ways of avoiding the anxiety inherent in human existence. He had great contempt for the way life was lived by those around him and believed truth could only be discovered subjectively by the individual in action. He felt people lacked the courage to take a leap of faith and live with passion and commitment from the inward depth of existence. This involved a constant struggle between the finite and infinite aspects of our nature as part of the difficult task of creating a self and finding meaning. =Friedrich Nietzsche (1844‚Äì1900)= Friedrich Nietzsche (1844‚Äì1900) took this philosophy of life a step further. His starting point was the notion that God is dead, that is, the idea of God was outmoded and limiting (Nietzsche, 1861, 1874, 1886). Furthermore, the Enlightenment‚Äîwith the newfound faith in reason and rationality‚Äîhad killed or replaced God with a new Truth that was perhaps more pernicious than the one it replaced. Science and rationality were the new \\"God,\\" but instead took the form of a deity that was colder and less comforting than before. Nietzsche exerted a significant impact upon the development of psychology in general, but he specifically influenced an approach which emphasized an understanding of life from a personal perspective. In exploring the various needs of the individual about the ontological conditions of being, Nietzsche asserted that all things are in a state of \\"ontological privation,\\" in which they long to become more than they are. This state of deprivation has major implications for the physiological and psychological needs of the individual. =Edmund Husserl (1859‚Äì1938)= While Kierkegaard and Nietzsche drew attention to the human issues that needed to be addressed, Edmund Husserl's phenomenology (Husserl, 1960, 1962; Moran, 2000) provided the method to address them rigorously. He contended that natural sciences assume the separateness of subject and object and that this kind of dualism can only lead to error. He proposed a whole new mode of investigation and understanding of the world and our experience of it. He said that prejudice has to be put aside or 'bracketed,' for us to meet the world afresh and discover what is absolutely fundamental, and only directly available to us through intuition. If people want to grasp the essence of things, instead of explaining and analyzing them, they have to learn to describe and understand them. =Max Scheler (1874-1928)= Max Scheler (1874-1928) developed philosophical anthropology from a material ethic of values (\\"Materielle Wertethik\\") that opposed Immanuel Kant's ethics of duty (\\"Pflichtethik\\"). He described a hierarchical system of values that further developed phenomenological philosophy. Scheler described the human psyche as being composed of four layers analogous to the layers of organic nature. However, in his description, the human psyche is opposed by the principle of the human spirit. Scheler's philosophy forms the basis of Viktor Frankl's logotherapy and existential analysis. =Martin Heidegger (1889‚Äì1976)= Martin Heidegger (1889‚Äì1976) applied the phenomenological method to understanding the meaning of being (Heidegger, 1962, 1968). He argued that poetry and deep philosophical thinking could bring greater insight into what it means to be in the world than what can be achieved through scientific knowledge. He explored human beings in the world in a manner that revolutionized classical ideas about the self and psychology. He recognized the importance of time, space, death, and human relatedness. He also favored hermeneutics, an old philosophical method of investigation, which is the art of interpretation.Martin Heidegger and Nazism Unlike interpretation as practiced in psychoanalysis (which consists of referring a person's experience to a pre-established theoretical framework), this kind of interpretation seeks to understand how the person himself/herself subjectively experiences something. =Jean-Paul Sartre (1905‚Äì1980)= Jean-Paul Sartre (1905‚Äì1980) contributed many other strands of existential exploration, particularly regarding emotions, imagination, and the person's insertion into a social and political world. The philosophy of existence, on the contrary, is carried by a wide-ranging literature, which includes many authors, such as Karl Jaspers (1951, 1963), Paul Tillich, Martin Buber, and Hans-Georg Gadamer within the Germanic tradition and Albert Camus, Gabriel Marcel, Paul Ricoeur, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Simone de Beauvoir and Emmanuel L√©vinas within the French tradition (see for instance Spiegelberg, 1972, Kearney, 1986 or van Deurzen- Smith, 1997). =Others= From the start of the 20th century, some psychotherapists were, however, inspired by phenomenology and its possibilities for working with people. * Otto Rank (1884‚Äì1939), an Austrian psychoanalyst who broke with Freud in the mid-1920s, was the first existential therapist. * Ludwig Binswanger, in Switzerland, also attempted to bring existential insights to his work with patients, in the Kreuzlingen sanatorium where he was a psychiatrist. Much of his work was translated into English during the 1940s and 1950s and, together with the immigration to the USA of Paul Tillich (1886‚Äì1965) (Tillich, 1952) and others, this had a considerable effect on the popularization of existential ideas as a basis for therapy (Valle and King, 1978; Cooper, 2003). * Rollo May (1909‚Äì1994) played an important role in this, and his writing (1969, 1983; May et al., 1958) kept the existential influence alive in America, leading eventually to a specific formulation of therapy (Bugental, 1981; May and Yalom, 1985; Yalom, 1980). Humanistic psychology was directly influenced by these ideas. * Viktor Frankl (1905‚Äì1997) was possibly the individual most responsible for spreading existential psychology throughout the world. He was invited by over 200 universities worldwide and accomplished over 80 journeys to North America alone, first invited by Gordon Allport at Harvard University. * In Europe, after Otto Rank, existential ideas were combined with some psychoanalytic principles and a method of existential analysis was developed by Medard Boss (1903‚Äì1990) (1957a, 1957b, 1979) in close co-operation with Heidegger. * In France, the ideas of Sartre (1956, 1962) and Merleau-Ponty (1962) and of some practitioners (Minkowski, 1970) were important and influential, but no specific therapeutic method was developed from them. Development = Development in Europe = The European School of existential analysis is dominated by two forms of therapy: Logotherapy, and Daseinsanalysis. Logotherapy was developed by psychiatrist Viktor E. Frankl. Frankl was heavily influenced by existential philosophy, as well as his own experience in the Nazi concentration camps of World War II. The three main components to Logotherapy are Freedom of Will, which is the ability to change one's life to the degree that such change is possible, Will to Meaning, which places meaning at the center of well-being, and Meaning in Life, which asserts the objectivity of meaning. The primary techniques of Logotherapy involve helping the clients to identify and remove any barriers to the pursuit of meaning in their own lives, to determine what is personally meaningful, and to then help patients effectively pursue related goals. Daseinsanalysis is a psychotherapeutic system developed upon the ideas of Martin Heidegger, as well as the psychoanalytic theories of Sigmund Freud, that seeks to help the individual find autonomy and meaning in their \\"being in the world\\" (a rough translation of \\"Dasein\\"). =Development in Britain= Britain became a fertile ground for further development of the existential approach when R. D. Laing and David Cooper, often associated with the anti-psychiatry movement, took Sartre's existential ideas as the basis for their work (Laing, 1960, 1961; Cooper, 1967; Laing and Cooper, 1964). Without developing a concrete method of therapy, they critically reconsidered the notion of mental illness and its treatment. In the late 1960s, they established an experimental therapeutic community at Kingsley Hall in the East End of London, where people could come to live through their 'madness' without the usual medical treatment. They also founded the Philadelphia Association, an organization providing an alternative living, therapy, and therapeutic training from this perspective. The Philadelphia Association is still in existence today and is now committed to the exploration of the works of philosophers such as Ludwig Wittgenstein, Jacques Derrida, Levinas, and Michel Foucault as well as the work of the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. It also runs some small therapeutic households along these lines. The Arbours Association is another group that grew out of the Kingsley Hall experiment. Founded by Joseph Berke and Schatzman in the 1970s, it now runs a training program in psychotherapy, a crisis center, and several therapeutic communities. The existential input in the Arbours has gradually been replaced with a more neo-Kleinian emphasis. The impetus for further development of the existential approach in Britain has primarily come from the development of some existentially based courses in academic institutions. This started with the programs created by Emmy van Deurzen, initially at Antioch University in London and subsequently at Regent's College, London and since then at the New School of Psychotherapy and Counseling, also located in London. The latter is a purely existentially based training institute, which offers postgraduate degrees validated by the University of Sheffield and Middlesex University. In the past few decades, the existential approach has spread rapidly and has become a welcome alternative to established methods. There are now many other, mostly academic, centers in Britain that provide training in existential counseling and psychotherapy and a rapidly growing interest in the approach in the voluntary sector and the National Health Service. British publications dealing with existential therapy include contributions by these authors: Jenner (de Koning and Jenner, 1982), Heaton (1988, 1994), Cohn (1994, 1997), Spinelli (1997), Cooper (1989, 2002), Eleftheriadou (1994), Lemma-Wright (1994), Du Plock (1997), Strasser and Strasser (1997), van Deurzen (1997, 1998, 2002), van Deurzen and Arnold-Baker (2005), and van Deurzen and Kenward (2005). Other writers such as Lomas (1981) and Smail (1978, 1987, 1993) have published work relevant to the approach, although not explicitly 'existential' in orientation. The journal of the British Society for Phenomenology regularly publishes work on existential and phenomenological psychotherapy. The Society for Existential Analysis was founded in 1988, initiated by van Deurzen. This society brings together psychotherapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, counselors, and philosophers working from an existential perspective. It offers regular fora for discussion and debate as well as significant annual conferences. It publishes the Journal of the Society for Existential Analysis twice a year. It is also a member of the International Federation of Daseinsanalysis, which stimulates international exchange between representatives of the approach from around the world. An International Society for Existential Therapists also exists. It was founded in 2006 by Emmy van Deurzen and Digby Tantam and is called the International Community of Existential Counsellors and Therapists (ICECAP). = Development in Canada = New developments in existential therapy in the last 20 years include existential positive psychology (EPP)Wong, P. T. P. (2009). Existential positive psychology. In S. J. Lopez (Ed.), Encyclopedia of positive psychology (Vol. 1, pp. 361-368). Oxford, UK: Wiley Blackwell. and meaning therapy (MT).Wong, P. T. P. (2015). Meaning therapy: Assessments and interventions. Existential Analysis, 26(1), 154-167. Different from the traditional approach to existential therapy, these new developments incorporate research findings from contemporary positive psychology. EPP can reframe the traditional issues of existential concerns into positive psychology questions that can be subjected to empirical research. It also focuses on personal growth and transformation as much as on existential anxiety.Wong, P. T. P. (2005). Existential and humanistic theories. In J. C. Thomas, & D. L. Segal (Eds.), Comprehensive handbook of personality and psychopathology (pp. 192-211). Hoboken, NJ: Wiley.Wong, P. T. P. (in press). Existential theoretical framework. In A. Wenzel (Ed.), The SAGE encyclopedia of abnormal and clinical psychology. New York, NY: Sage. Later, EPP was incorporated into the second wave of positive psychology (PP 2.0). Meaning Therapy (MT) is an extension of Frankl's logotherapy and America's humanistic- existential tradition; it is also pluralistic because it incorporates elements of cognitive-behavioral therapy, narrative therapy, and positive psychotherapy, with meaning as its central organizing construct. MT not only appeals to people's natural desires for happiness and significance but also makes skillful use of their innate capacity for meaning-seeking and meaning- making. MT strikes a balance between a person-centered approach and a psycho- educational approach. At the outset of therapy, clients are informed of the use of meaning-centered interventions appropriate for their predicaments because of the empirical evidence for the vital role of meaning in healing and thriving.Batthyany, A., & Russo-Netzer, P. (Eds.). (2014). Meaning in positive and existential psychology. New York, NY: Springer. Wong, P. T. P. (Ed.). (2012). The human quest for meaning: Theories, research, and applications (2nd ed.). New York, NY: Routledge. MT is a comprehensive and pluralistic way to address all aspects of clients' existential concerns. Clients can benefit from MT in two ways: (1) a custom-tailored treatment to solve their presenting problems, and (2) a collaborative journey to create a preferred better future.  View of the human mind  Existential therapy (of the American, existential-humanistic tradition) starts with the belief that although humans are essentially alone in the world, they long to be connected to others. People want to have meaning in one another's lives, but ultimately they must come to realize that they cannot depend on others for validation, and with that realization, they finally acknowledge and understand that they are fundamentally alone. The result of this revelation is anxiety in the knowledge that our validation must come from within and not from others. Existential therapy is based on a theory of mind, and of psychology. In existentialism, personality is based on choosing to be, authentically, the real you, given an understanding based on a philosophical idea of what a person is. Therefore, practical therapeutic applications can be derived give a theory of personality, emotion, and ‚Äúthe good life.‚Äù This leads to practical therapeutic applications like dealing with personal choices in life that lead to personal happiness. Personal happiness based on a concept of yourself as having the freedom of directing your life and making necessary changes (so to speak, a radical freedom). So, a full philosophical understanding of existentialism is basic to methods implemented for emotional and life changes. That is, a background in philosophy is basic to existential therapy. Philosophical issues of the self, personality, philosophy of mind, meaning of life, personal development are all fundamentally relevant to any practical therapeutic expectations. Existentialism  Psychological dysfunction  Because there is no single existential view, opinions about psychological dysfunction vary. For theorists aligned with Yalom, psychological dysfunction results from the individual's refusal or inability to deal with the normal existential anxiety that comes from confronting life's \\"givens\\": mortality, isolation, meaninglessness, and freedom.Yalom. 1980. Existential Psychotherapy For other theorists, there is no such thing as psychological dysfunction or mental illness. Every way of being is merely an expression of how one chooses to live one's life. However, one may feel unable to come to terms with the anxiety of being alone in the world. If so, an existential psychotherapist can assist one in accepting these feelings rather than trying to change them as if there is something wrong. Everyone has the freedom to choose how they are going to exist in life; however, this freedom may go unpracticed. It may appear easier and safer not to make decisions that one will be responsible for. Many people will remain unaware of alternative choices in life for various societal reasons.  The good life  Existentialism suggests that it is possible for individuals to face the anxieties of life head on, embrace the human condition of aloneness and to revel in the freedom to choose and take full responsibility for their choices. They can aim to take control of their lives and steer themselves in any direction they choose. There is no need to halt feelings of meaninglessness but instead to choose and focus on new meanings for the living. By building, loving and creating, life can be lived as one's own adventure. One can accept one's own mortality and overcome the fear of death. Although the French author Albert Camus denied the specific label of existentialist in his novel, L'Etranger, the novel's main character, Meursault, ends the novel by doing just this. He accepts his mortality and rejects the constrictions of society he previously placed on himself, leaving him unencumbered and free to live his life with an unclouded mind. Also, Gerd B. Achenbach has refreshed the Socratic tradition with his own blend of philosophical counseling, as has Michel Weber with his Chromatiques Center in Belgium. The strictly Sartrean perspective of existential psychotherapy is generally unconcerned with the client's past, but instead, the emphasis is on the choices to be made in the present and future. The counselor and the client may reflect upon how the client has answered life's questions in the past, but attention ultimately shifts to searching for a new and increased awareness in the present and enabling a new freedom and responsibility to act. The patient can then accept that they are not special and that their existence is simply coincidental, or without destiny or fate. By accepting this, they can overcome their anxieties and instead view life as moments in which they are fundamentally free. Four worlds Existential thinkers seek to avoid restrictive models that categorize or label people. Instead, they look for the universals that can be observed cross-culturally. There is no existential personality theory which divides humanity into types or reduces people to part components. Instead, there is a description of the different levels of experience and existence with which people are inevitably confronted. The way in which a person is in the world at a particular stage can be charted on this general map of human existence (Binswanger, 1963; Yalom, 1980; van Deurzen, 1984). In line with the view taken by van Deurzen, one can distinguish four basic dimensions of human existence: the physical, the social, the psychological, and the spiritual. On each of these dimensions, people encounter the world and shape their attitude out of their particular take on their experience. Their orientation towards the world defines their reality. The four dimensions are interwoven and provide a complex four-dimensional force field for their existence. Individuals are stretched between a positive pole of what they aspire to on each dimension and a negative pole of what they fear. Binswanger proposed the first three of these dimensions from Heidegger's description of Umwelt and Mitwelt and his further notion of Eigenwelt. The fourth dimension was added by van Deurzen from Heidegger's description of a spiritual world (√úberwelt) in Heidegger's later work. =Physical dimension= On the physical dimension (Umwelt), individuals relate to their environment and the givens of the natural world around them. This includes their attitude to the body they have, to the concrete surroundings they find themselves in, to the climate and the weather, to objects and material possessions, to the bodies of other people, their own bodily needs, to health and illness and their mortality. The struggle on this dimension is, in general terms, between the search for domination over the elements and natural law (as in technology, or in sports) and the need to accept the limitations of natural boundaries (as in ecology or old age). While people generally aim for security on this dimension (through health and wealth), much of life brings a gradual disillusionment and realization that such security can only be temporary. Recognizing limitations can deliver a significant release of tension. =Social dimension= On the social dimension (Mitwelt), individuals relate to others as they interact with the public world around them. This dimension includes their response to the culture they live in, as well as to the class and race they belong to (and also those they do not belong to). Attitudes here range from love to hate and from cooperation to competition. The dynamic contradictions can be understood concerning acceptance versus rejection or belonging versus isolation. Some people prefer to withdraw from the world of others as much as possible. Others blindly chase public acceptance by going along with the rules and fashions of the moment. Otherwise, they try to rise above these by becoming trendsetters themselves. By acquiring fame or other forms of power, individuals can attain dominance over others temporarily. Sooner or later, however, everyone is confronted with both failure and aloneness. =Psychological dimension= On the psychological dimension (Eigenwelt), individuals relate to themselves and in this way create a personal world. This dimension includes views about their character, their past experience and their future possibilities. Contradictions here are often experienced regarding personal strengths and weaknesses. People search for a sense of identity, a feeling of being substantial and having a self. But inevitably many events will confront them with evidence to the contrary and plunge them into a state of confusion or disintegration. Activity and passivity are an important polarity here. Self-affirmation and resolution go with the former and surrender and yielding with the latter. Facing the final dissolution of self that comes with personal loss and the facing of death might bring anxiety and confusion to many who have not yet given up their sense of self-importance. =Spiritual dimension= On the spiritual dimension (√úberwelt) (van Deurzen, 1984), individuals relate to the unknown and thus create a sense of an ideal world, an ideology, and a philosophical outlook. It is there that they find meaning by putting all the pieces of the puzzle together for themselves. For some people, this is done by adhering to a religion or other prescriptive worldview; for others, it is about discovering or attributing meaning in a more secular or personal way. The contradictions that must be faced on this dimension are often related to the tension between purpose and absurdity, hope and despair. People create their values in search of something that matters enough to live or die for, something that may even have ultimate and universal validity. Usually, the aim is the conquest of a soul or something that will substantially surpass mortality (as in having contributed something valuable to humankind). Facing the void and the possibility of nothingness are the indispensable counterparts of this quest for the eternal.  Research support  There has not been a tremendous amount of research on existential therapy. Much of the research focuses on people receiving therapy who also have medical concerns such as cancer. Despite this, some studies have indicated positive efficacy for existential therapies with certain populations. Qualitative research has shown there is a positive learning outcome of Existential Therapy.Anders Draeby Sorensen, Rosemary Lodge & Emmy Van Deurzen: A Comparison of Learning Outcomes in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Existential Therapy: An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis.

Clothing terminology ranges from the arcane (watchet, a pale blue color name from the 16th century) (t-shirt), and changes over time in response to fashion which in turn reflects social, artistic, and political trends.  Categories  At its broadest, clothing terminology may be said to include names for: * Classes of basic garments: shirt, coat, skirt, dress, suit, underwear, swimsuit * Length, for skirts and dresses: micro-mini, mini, tea length, ballerina length, full length, midi, maxi * Contemporary and historical styles of garments: corset, frock coat, t-shirt, doublet * Parts of garments: sleeve, collar, lapel * Styles of these: juliette sleeve, Peter Pan collar * Clothing details: pocket, french cuff, zipper * Functional uses: base layer, insulation layer, outer shell * Traditional garments: cheongsam, kilt, dirndl, fustanella * Fashions and \\"anti-fashions\\": preppy, New Look, hip-hop, rational dress * Fabrics: denim, wool, chiffon, velvet, satin, silk, cotton * Fabric treatments: fabric painting, transfers, ikat, tie-dye, batik * Fabric manipulation: pleat, tuck, gather, smocking * Colors and dyes: madder red, indigo, isabella * Sewing terms: cut, hem, armscye, lining * Patternmaking terms: sloper, toile * Methods of manufacture: haute couture, bespoke tailoring, ready-to-wear * Retailers' terms:  Size ranges: Small, Medium, Large, XL (Extra Large), XXL (Double Extra Large), Junior, Misses, Plus Size, Big-and-Tall  Retail seasons: back-to-school, holiday, resort, seasonal  Departments: special occasion, sportswear, bridge fashion  Degrees of formality: formal wear, bridal, business casual  Market: high end, high street, ethical consumer, cut price  Persistence  Edward VI in a red fur- lined gown with split hanging sleeves, a men's fashion of the mid-16th century Despite the constant introduction of new terms by fashion designers, clothing manufacturers, and marketers, the names for several basic garment classes in English are very stable over time. Gown, shirt/skirt, frock, and coat are all attested back to the early medieval period. Gown (from Medieval Latin gunna) was a basic clothing term for hundreds of years, referring to a garment that hangs from the shoulders. In Medieval and Renaissance England gown referred to a loose outer garment worn by both men and women, sometimes short, more often ankle length, with sleeves. By the 18th century gown had become a standard category term for a women's dress, a meaning it retained until the mid-20th century. Only in the last few decades has gown lost this general meaning in favor of dress. Today the term gown is rare except in specialized cases: academic dress or cap and gown, evening gown, nightgown, hospital gown, and so on (see Gown). Shirt and skirt are originally the same word, the former being the southern and the latter the northern pronunciation in early Middle English. Coat remains a term for an overgarment, its essential meaning for the last thousand years (see Coat).  New sources  Names for new styles or fashions in clothing are frequently the deliberate inventions of fashion designers or clothing manufacturers; these include Chanel's Little Black Dress (a term which has survived) and Lanvin's robe de style (which has not). Other terms are of more obscure origin. = Personal names = Clothing styles are frequently named after people‚Äîoften with a military connection: *The Jinnah Cap is a fur qaraqul hat named after the founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. *The Garibaldi jacket or Garibaldi shirt were bright red woolen garments for women with black embroidery or braid and military details popular in the 1860s; they are named after the Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi who visited England in 1863. *The Eisenhower jacket or \\"Ike\\" jacket is a waist-length, military jacket of World War II origins. Called the \\"Jacket, Field, Wool, M-1944\\", it was commissioned by then General Dwight Eisenhower as a new field jacket for the US Forces in Northern Europe. The jacket was based on the British Army 'Battle Dress' jacket of the same era. *The cardigan is a knitted jacket or button-front sweater created to keep British soldiers warm in Russian winters. It is named for James Brudenell, 7th Earl of Cardigan, who led the Charge of the Light Brigade in the Crimean War (1854). *The Mao jacket is a very plain (often grey), high-collared, shirtlike jacket customarily worn by Mao Zedong and the people of China during his regime. Its drab design and uniformity was a reaction to pre-Revolution class distinctions of clothes, with elites dressing in elaborate silks, while poor laborers wore very rough clothes. *The Nehru jacket is a uniform jacket without lapels or collars, popularized by Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of independent India. *The Bloomer Costume was a type of women's clothing introduced in the Antebellum period, that changed the style from dresses to a more male-type style, which was devised by Amelia Bloomer. *The Wellington boot was a cavalry boot devised by the Duke of Wellington, originally made from leather, but now normally rubber. *The Stetson hat is named after the founder of the John B. Stetson Company. *The Mackintosh is a waterproof coat made from rubberised fabric, named after its inventor Charles Macintosh. *The Gandhi cap is a white colored sidecap made from khadi. It was popularised by Mahatma Gandhi during the Indian independence movement. = Place names = Another fertile source for clothing terms is place names, which usually reflect the origin (or supposed origin) of a fashion. Modern terms such as Bermuda shorts, Hawaiian shirts, and Fair Isle sweaters are the latest in a long line that stretches back to holland (linen), damask (\\"from Damascus\\"), polonaise (\\"in the fashion of Polish women\\"), basque, jersey (originally Jersey frock), Balaclava, Capri pants, mantua, and denim (\\"serge de N√Æmes\\" after the city). = Costume historian's terms = Costume historians, with a \\"rearward-looking\\" view, require names for clothing styles that were not used (or needed) when the styles were actually worn. For example, the Van Dyke collar is so-called from its appearances in 17th century portraits by Anthony van Dyck, and the Watteau pleats of the robe √° la fran√ßaise are called after their appearance in the portraits of Antoine Watteau. Similarly, terms may be applied ahistorically to entire categories of garments, so that corset is applied to garments that were called stays or a pair of bodies until the introduction of the word corset in the late 18th century. And dress is now applied to any women's garment consisting of a bodice and skirt, although for most of its history dress simply meant clothing, or a complete outfit of clothing with its appropriate accessories. = Short forms = A notable trend at the turn of the 21st century is \\"cute\\" short forms: camisole becomes cami, hooded sweaters or sweatshirts become hoodies, and as of 2005, short or \\"shrunken\\" cardigans are cardies. The much- older term shimmy for \\"slip\\" is most likely a false singular from chemise.  References Picken, Mary Brooks: The Fashion Dictionary, Funk and Wagnalls, 1957.

Schaft can be thought of as being a supergroup in that for the release of their debut album Switchblade Maki and Imai formed the core of the group and a rotating roster of collaborators, who are well known within their genres, were brought in to work on various songs. Raymond Watts of PIG was Schaft's most recurring collaborator, having contributed to half the songs on their debut album and toured with the band.

Gipson was born on a farm near Mason in the Texas Hill Country, the son of Beck Gipson and Emma Deishler. After working at a variety of farming and ranching jobs, he enrolled in 1933 at the University of Texas at Austin. There he wrote for the Daily Texan and The Ranger, but he left school before graduating to become a newspaper journalist. Writings In the 1940s, Gipson began writing short stories with a western theme, which proved to be prototypes for his longer works of fiction that followed. In 1946, his first full-length book, The Fabulous Empire: Colonel Zack Miller's Story, was published. Fred (on right) celebrating after book release. Hound-Dog Man, published in 1947, established Gipson's reputation when it became a Doubleday Book-of-the-Month Club selection and sold over 250,000 copies in its first year of publication. It was made into a film in 1959. His additional works included The Home Place (later filmed as Return of the Texan, a 1952 Western starring Dale Robertson and Joanne Dru), Big Bend: A Homesteader's Story, Cowhand: The Story of a Working Cowboy, The Trail-Driving Rooster, and Recollection Creek.

He was a leading member of the Progressive Movement, serving for two years as a member of the Columbus, Ohio city council and campaigning against Boss Tweed as religious editor of the New York Independent. Gladden was probably the first leading U.S. religious figure to support unionization of the workforce; he also opposed racial segregation. He was a prolific writer who wrote hundreds of poems, hymns, articles, editorials, and books. Early life Gladden was born February 11, 1836, in Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, the son of Solomon and Amanda (Daniels) Gladden. He was given the name Solomon Washington Gladden. When Gladden was six, his father died. After that, he lived with his uncle on a farm near Owego, New York. There, he learned and practiced a farmer's \\"manual arts\\" and used any free time for serious reading that included the Bible. During Gladden's formative years, western New York State was known as the Burned-Over District because it had been the center of a number of religious revivals.John H.

Gladden heard many preachers in a fruitless search for \\"assurance of divine favor\\" until, in his 18th year, a \\"clear-headed minister\\" helped him \\"trust the Heavenly Father's love\\" for him. From then on, Gladden believed that religion is \\"summed up in the word Friendship... with the Father above and the brother by our side.\\"Washington Gladden, Recollections (Houghton Mifflin, 1909), 38-39.

Early career During his early career, Gladden held five positions in pastorates and journalism. In 1860, a pivotal year for Gladden, he received his first call to a pastorate, which was followed by ordination, marriage, the secession of southern states, and the impending Civil War.

Gladden's active support for workers and their right to organize began during his years in North Adams and Springfield. His position aroused the opposition of mill and factory owners, but he was not deterred and continued his work for justice the rest of his life. Although he was deeply concerned for the well-being of workers, scholars have noted that his early lectures in 1875 and 1876 lacked the understanding of the industrial system that was characteristic of his later writings. In that era, Gladden acknowledged that the economic problems were also moral but \\"contributed little that the most conservative of industrial leaders would not have admitted to be the case.\\" He published Working People and their Employers in 1876, which advocated the unionization of employees, and was the first notable US clergyman to approve of unions. Gladden did not support socialism or laissez-faire but advocated instead the application of \\"Christian law\\" to issues.http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Social_Gospel.aspx. His 1877 book The Christian Way: Whither it Leads and How to Go On was his first national call for \\"the extension of Christian values into everyday life\\" and began his leadership in the Social Gospel movement.

He preached two 45-minute sermons each Sunday. In the morning, he preached on living the Christian life. In the evening, he preached on social problems. The evening sermon was printed in The Ohio State Journal the next day on page one. During First Church's 1902 Golden Jubilee Celebration, Gladden said on his preaching that \\"you have not always agreed with me; you could not; but when my words, and sometimes my conduct were opposed to your thoughts and interests, you never tried to muzzle me.\\"Rev.

The more Gladden addressed social issues, the more his church grew: from 500 in 1883 to 1,200 in 1914.

In 2018 an estimated 2.2 million people had HIV in Latin America and the Caribbean, making the HIV prevalence rate approximately 0.4% in Latin America. Some demographic groups in Latin America have higher prevalence rates for HIV/ AIDS including men who have sex with men having a prevalence rate of 10.6%, and transgender women having one of the highest rates within the population with a prevalence rate of 17.7%. Female sex workers and drug users also have higher prevalence for the disease than the general population (4.9% and 1%-49.7% respectively). One aspect that has contributed to the higher prevalence of HIV/AIDS in LGBTQIA+ groups in Latin America is the concept of homophobia. Homophobia in Latin America has historically affected HIV service provision through under reported data and less priority through government programs. Antiretroviral treatment coverage has been high, with AIDS related deaths decreasing between 2007 to 2017 by 12%, although the rate of new infections has not seen a large decrease. The cost of antiretroviral medicines remain a barrier for some in Latin America, as well as country wide shortages of medicines and condoms. In 2017 77% of Latin Americans with HIV were aware of their HIV status. The prevention of HIV/AIDS in Latin America among groups with a higher prevalence such as men who have sex with men and transgender women, has been aided with educational outreach, condom distribution, and LGBTQIA+ friendly clinics. Other main prevention methods include condom availability, education and outreach, HIV awareness, and mother-to-child transmission prevention.  Origin and epidemiology of HIV/AIDS in Latin America  The first documented reporting of what would come to be known as HIV/AIDS happened in June 1981. In September of 1982, AIDS is given its name and a case definition for the very first time. Specific details on the origin of HIV/AIDS in Latin America are lacking, but in 1983, the first known HIV cases in Latin America were confirmed in Mexico and Haiti in the form of the HIV-1. Blood screening in Mexico was scare in the early 1990s, which contributed to 63% of female AIDS cases stemming from blood transfusions. Currently, the prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS in Latin America is highest in Belize (2%), Honduras (1.9%), Panama (1.54%) and Guatemala (1.4%). Since 2000, the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean has been highest in Haiti (5.2%), the Bahamas (4.1%), and the Dominican Republic (2.8%).  Prevention of HIV/AIDS infections  In order to prevent and slow the transmission rates within the Latin American population public health initiatives need to target vulnerable populations. Providing treatment, education, and health services that are stigma-free and accessible to vulnerable populations is key to combating the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Latin America. Another common barrier in accessing health services among transgender women is a mistrust of the health system as a whole from past discrimination towards this community within the health system. = Prevention practices and methods = To prevent transmission between individuals, safe sex practices and treatment using antiretroviral treatment is a necessary public health intervention. Within Latin America as of 2018, 62% of those that are aware of their positive HIV status are currently on antiretroviral therapy, and of those individuals only 55% of them are virally suppressed, and carry an undetectable load. This accounts for 29% of the entire HIV positive community in Latin America. Practices to prevent transmission of HIV/AIDS * Engaging in less risky sexual behavior * Correctly using barrier methods (male condoms and dental damns) * Getting tested for HIV/AIDS and getting treated with antiretroviral therapy * Taking preventative medicines for high risk populations, like post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) * Not using or injecting drugs These safe sex practices reduce the risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. Many of these treatments are not widely available and accessible to vulnerable populations within Latin America. In order to successfully implement these prevention methods the stigma and discrimination surrounding vulnerable populations needs to be addressed within the present health systems in Latin America. = Public health initiatives = Within Latin America there are many barriers to prevention methods, including late diagnostic testing of patients, lack of testing centers in rural communities, and the stigma/discrimination within the HIV positive population. Recently in Bahamas, Brazil, El Salvador, Jamaica, Peru, and Trinidad and Tobago self tests were made available, and have the potential to increase testing in at-risk populations. However the accessibility and affordability of the tests is under scrutiny from public health professionals. Other public health initiatives include education regarding safe sex practice use and condom availability. Programs in Mexico and Brazil that aimed to prevent mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) is an important initiative that has been relatively successful at reducing the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in this population from 16.7% in 2010 to 10.4% in 2017.

She was a cabinet minister in the government of David Peterson. Background Smith was educated at St. Michael's College in the University of Toronto, receiving a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy. She was the founding member of Mme. Vanier Children's Services and Diocesan Catholic Social Services in London, Ontario, and served on the board of governors for the University of Western Ontario. In 2001, Smith received a Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Western Ontario. Smith lived in London, Ontario. Her husband Don Smith was the co-founder of EllisDon, an employee-owned construction services company that was incorporated in 1951 in London, Ontario. She and Don raised seven children. She died in London after suffering a head injury in St. Lucia in February 2016. She was 88. Politics In 1976, Smith was elected to council for London City Council. She served as alderman for nine years and was a controller for two of those years. She was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1985 provincial election, defeating Progressive Conservative incumbent Gordon Walker by 6,683 votes in the constituency of London South. She was re-elected by an increased majority in the 1987 election, and appointed to cabinet as Solicitor General on September 29, 1987. Smith was forced to resign her office on June 6, 1989. She had received a telephone call in the middle of the night from a constituent worried about the safety of a missing brother, and telephoned the police to express her concern. The opposition argued that this was an improper act, in that Smith's position as Solicitor-General could result in the case receiving preferential treatment. Thomas Walkom wrote a newspaper column about this matter, entitled \\"Even decent politicians may need to resign\\". Smith later served as Chief Government Whip. In the 1990 provincial election, she lost to NDP candidate David Winninger by 5,651 votes.

Fran√ßois Dumont (7 January 1751 - 27 August 1831) was a French painter of portrait miniatures. Dumont was born at Lun√©ville (Meurthe), and was left an orphan when young, with five brothers and sisters to support. He was for a while a student under Jean Girardet, and then, on. the advice of a Lunville Academician, Madame Coster, set up a studio for himself. In 1784 he journeyed to Rome, returning after four years careful study, and in 1788 was accepted as an Academician and granted an apartment in the Louvre. He married Marie-Nicole, the daughter of Antoine Vestier, the miniature painter,Profile of Marie-Nicole Vestier at the Dictionary of Pastellists Before 1800. and had two sons, Aristide and Bias, both of whom became painters. Dumont was one of the three greatest miniature painters of France, painting portraits of Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, Louis XVIII and Charles X, and of almost all the important persons of his day. His own portrait was engraved both by Francis Audouin and by Jean-Charles Tardieu. He resided the greater part of his life in Paris, and there he died. A younger brother, Tony Dumont, was also a miniature painter, a pupil of his brother, a frequent exhibitor and the recipient of a medal from the Academy in 1810. Each artist signed with the surname only, and there is some controversy concerning the attribution to each artist of his own work. Tony was an expert violinist and delighted in painting portraits of persons who were playing upon the violin. Many of Dumont's finest paintings came into the collection of J. P. Morgan, but others are in the Louvre, presented by the heir of Bias Dumont. The work of both painters is distinguished by breadth, precision and a charming scheme of coloring, and the unfinished works of the elder brother are amongst some of the most beautiful miniatures ever produced.

She has won two World Cup races, two World Championship medals, and, in 2004, the silver medal in the time trial in the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece. She is married to fellow professional cyclist Michael Barry. They live in Toronto, ON, CA. Biography Barry did not start as a cyclist. Her entry into sport was figure skating. All she wanted to do was race other youngsters to the end of the rink. Her coach suggested she take up speed skating, which she did, swayed by watching Eric and Beth Heiden in the world championships in her home town of Milwaukee. She was a member of the U.S. speedskating team from 1987 to 1991 and selected for the world championships in 1988‚Äì1991. Having used cycling as training for skating, Barry switched completely, prompted by a cycling race series (Superweek) on streets in front of her childhood home. Other American cyclists who excelled in both sports include Eric and Beth Heiden, Chris Witty, Connie Carpenter-Phinney and Erin Mirabella. Disappointed not to qualify for the Olympics in 1996 and 2000, Barry did not race in 2001 but came back strongly next year with victory in the Montreal World Cup, in which she used a steel Mariposa frame built by her father-in-law, Mike Barry. Her biggest success came in 2004. Picked for the U.S. Olympic team after accumulating more UCI points than other riders, she came second in the individual time trial event.

Brewer was born in Poughkeepsie, New York and grew up on a farm in Enfield, New York. In 1848 Brewer attended Yale and began studying soil chemistry under Professors Benjamin Silliman and John Pitkin Norton. There, Brewer was a founding member of Berzelius, one of Yale's oldest \\"secret societies\\". In 1852 he graduated from the first class of the Sheffield Scientific School with a Bachelor of Philosophy degree and began teaching at the Ovid Academy in Ovid, New York. It was in Ovid where Brewer first befriended Presbyterian minister Laurentine Hamilton. In 1855 Brewer travelled to Europe where he studied natural science under Professor Robert Bunsen at the University of Heidelberg in Germany. He then went to Munich to study organic chemistry under Professor Justus von Liebig. In 1857 Brewer went to Paris, France and studied chemistry under Professor Michel Eug√®ne Chevreul. In 1858 Brewer returned to the United States and married Angelina Jameson, of Ovid, New York on August 14, 1858. In October, he was appointed professor of chemistry at Washington and Jefferson College in Washington, Pennsylvania. His wife later died in June, 1859.Russell H.

Whitney to become the chief botanist of the California Division of Mines and Geology (predecessor of today's California Geological Survey). Brewer led field parties in the extensive survey of the geology of California until 1864, when he became the Chair of Agriculture at Sheffield Scientific School. Brewer wrote extensively during the survey including many letters to family and friends, a compendium of which was eventually published by the Yale University Press in 1930 as Up and Down California in 1860-1864. On September 1, 1868, he married his second wife, Georgiana Robinson, of Exeter, New Hampshire. Together they had four children, three sons and one daughter. During his tenure at Yale, Brewer took part in a survey of Greenland in 1869. In 1899 he was hired by Edward Henry Harriman to take part in his famous Alaskan expedition. In 1903 Brewer retired from teaching, and died at his New Haven, Connecticut home in 1910. He was buried at Grove Street Cemetery. He was a member of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences. Mount Brewer, located in the Sierra Nevada mountain range, is named after him, as is the very rare spruce Picea breweriana, Brewer Spruce,, p. 392 endemic to the Klamath Mountains of southwest Oregon and northwest California.

In a geocentric coordinate system, this is the axis of rotation of the celestial sphere. Consequently, in ancient Greco-Roman astronomy, the axis mundi is the axis of rotation of the planetary spheres of the classical geocentric model of the cosmos.the term is used by Geminus in his Elementa, in early modern editions misattributed to Proclus as Commentarius in sphaeram. R.B. Todd, 'The Manuscripts of the Pseudo-Proclan Sphaera', Revue d'histoire des textes 23 (1993), 57-71. The term continues to be used in modern astronomical works throughout the 18th century, e.g. Johann Samuel Traugott Gehler, Physikalisches W√∂rterbuch (1791), p. 688. In 20th-century comparative mythology, the term axis mundi, also called the cosmic axis, world axis, world pillar, center of the world, world tree) was greatly extended to refer to any mythological concept representing \\"the connection between Heaven and Earth\\" or the \\"higher and lower realms\\".Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. . p.48-51 The concept was introduced by Mircea Eliade in the 1950s.Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. . p.40 It is closely related to the mythological concept of omphalos (navel) of the world or cosmos.J. C. Cooper.

Cartouche 89: 15‚Äì21 https://www.academia.edu/8727362/World_Navels Items adduced as examples of the axis mundi by comparative mythologists include plants (notably a tree but also other types of plants such as a vine or stalk), a mountain, a column of smoke or fire, or a product of human manufacture (such as a staff, a tower, a ladder, a staircase, a maypole, a cross, a steeple, a rope, a totem pole, a pillar, a spire). Its proximity to heaven may carry implications that are chiefly religious (pagoda, temple mount, minaret, church) or secular (obelisk, lighthouse, rocket, skyscraper). The image appears in religious and secular contexts.Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. A Dictionary of Symbols. Penguin Books: London, 1996. . pp.61‚Äì63, 173‚Äì175 The axis mundi symbol may be found in cultures utilizing shamanic practices or animist belief systems, in major world religions, and in technologically advanced \\"urban centers\\". In Mircea Eliade's opinion, \\"Every Microcosm, every inhabited region, has a Centre; that is to say, a place that is sacred above all.\\"Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. . p.39 Background Mount Kailash (viewed from the south) is holy to Hinduism and several religions in Tibet. There exist multiple interpretations as to the origin of the symbol. One psychological and sociological interpretation suggests that the symbol originates in a natural and universal psychological perception: that the particular spot in which one occupies stands at \\"the center of the world\\". This space serves as a microcosm of order because it is known and settled. Outside the boundaries of the microcosm lie foreign realms that, because they are unfamiliar or not ordered, represent chaos, death or night.Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. . p.37-39 From the center one may still venture in any of the four cardinal directions, make discoveries, and establish new centers as new realms become known and settled. The name of China, meaning \\"Middle Nation\\" ( pinyin: '), is often interpreted as an expression of an ancient perception that the Chinese polity (or group of polities) occupied the center of the world, with other lands lying in various directions relative to it. A second interpretation suggests that ancient symbols such as the axis mundi lie in a particular philosophical or metaphysical representation of a common and culturally shared philosophical concept, which is that of an natural reflection of the macrocosm, or existence at grand scale, in the microcosm, which consists of either an individual, community, or local environment but shares the same principles and structures as the macrocosm. In this metaphysical representation of the universe, mankind is placed into an existence which serves as a microcosm of the universe or the entire cosmic existence, and who in order to achieve higher states of existence or liberation into the macrocosm must gain necessary insights into universal principles which can be represented by his life or environment in the microcosm.Fritjof Schuon. 'From the Divine to the Human: Survey of Metaphysics and Epistemology' World Wisdom Books, 1982 p. 23-27 In many religious and philosophical traditions around the world, mankind is seen as a sort of bridge between either two worlds, the earthly and the heavenly (as in Judeo-Christian, Hindu, and Taoist philosophical and theological systems), or three worlds, namely the earthly, heavenly, and the \\"sub-earthly\\" or \\"infra- earthly\\" (e.g. the underworld, as in the Ancient Greek, Incan, Mayan, and Ancient Egyptian religious systems). Spanning these philosophical systems is the belief that through man traverses a sort of axis, or path, which can lead from man's current central position in the intermediate realms into heavenly or sub-earthly realms. Thus, in this view, symbolic representations of a vertical axis represent a path of \\"ascent' or \\"descent\\" into other spiritual or material realms, and often capture a philosophy which considers the human life to be a quest in which one develops insights or perfections in order to move beyond this current microcosmic realm and to engage with the grand macrocosmic order.Fritjof Schuon. 'From the Divine to the Human: Survey of Metaphysics and Epistemology' World Wisdom Books, 1982 p. 27-31 In concepts of the axis mundi, certain geographic representations are used to capture this symbolic connection between the heavenly and the earthly  often a mountain or other elevated place, a spot where earth and sky come closest, gains status as center of the center, the axis mundi. High mountains are typically regarded as sacred by peoples living near them. Shrines are often erected at the summit or base.Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. . p.41-43 Mount Kunlun fills a similar role in China.Wang, Chong. Lunheng Part I: Philosophical Essays of Wang Ch'ung. Trans. Alfred Forke. London: Luzac & Co., 1907. p.337. Mount Kailash is holy to Hinduism and several religions in Tibet. The Pitjantjatjara people in central Australia consider Uluru to be central to both their world and culture. In ancient Mesopotamia the cultures of ancient Sumer and Babylon erected artificial mountains, or ziggurats, on the flat river plain. These supported staircases leading to temples at the top. The Hindu temples in India are often situated on high mountains. E.g. Amarnath, Tirupati, Vaishno Devi etc. The pre-Columbian residents of Teotihuac√°n in Mexico erected huge pyramids featuring staircases leading to heaven. These Amerindian temples were often placed on top of caves or subterranean springs, which were thought to be openings to the underworld. Jacob's Ladder is an axis mundi image, as is the Temple Mount. For Christians the Cross on Mount Calvary expresses the symbol.Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. A Dictionary of Symbols. Penguin Books: London, 1996. . pp.680‚Äì685 The Middle Kingdom, China, had a central mountain, Kunlun, known in Taoist literature as \\"the mountain at the middle of the world.\\" To \\"go into the mountains\\" meant to dedicate oneself to a spiritual life.Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. A Dictionary of Symbols. Penguin Books: London, 1996. . pp.681 Because the axis mundi is an idea that unites a number of concrete images, no contradiction exists in regarding multiple spots as \\"the center of the world\\". The symbol can operate in a number of locales at once. Mount Hermon was regarded as the axis mundi in Canaanite tradition, from where the sons of God are introduced descending in 1 Enoch (1En6:6). The ancient Armenians had a number of holy sites, the most important of which was Mount Ararat, which was thought to be the home of the gods as well as the center of the Universe. Likewise, the ancient Greeks regarded several sites as places of earth's omphalos (navel) stone, notably the oracle at Delphi, while still maintaining a belief in a cosmic world tree and in Mount Olympus as the abode of the gods. Judaism has the Temple Mount, Christianity has the Mount of Olives and Calvary, Islam has the Ka'aba, said to be the first building on earth, and the Temple Mount (Dome of the Rock). In Hinduism, Mount Kailash is identified with the mythical Mount Meru and regarded as the home of Shiva; in Vajrayana Buddhism, Mount Kailash is recognized as the most sacred place where all the dragon currents converge and is regarded as the gateway to Shambhala. In Shinto, the Ise Shrine is the omphalos. Sacred places constitute world centers (omphalos) with the altar or place of prayer as the axis. Altars, incense sticks, candles and torches form the axis by sending a column of smoke, and prayer, toward heaven. The architecture of sacred places often reflects this role. \\"Every temple or palace‚Äîand by extension, every sacred city or royal residence‚Äîis a Sacred Mountain, thus becoming a Centre.\\"Mircea Eliade (tr. Willard Trask). 'Archetypes and Repetition' in The Myth of the Eternal Return. Princeton, 1971. . p.12 The stupa of Hinduism, and later Buddhism, reflects Mount Meru. Cathedrals are laid out in the form of a cross, with the vertical bar representing the union of earth and heaven as the horizontal bars represent union of people to one another, with the altar at the intersection. Pagoda structures in Asian temples take the form of a stairway linking earth and heaven. A steeple in a church or a minaret in a mosque also serve as connections of earth and heaven. Structures such as the maypole, derived from the Saxons' Irminsul, and the totem pole among indigenous peoples of the Americas also represent world axes. The calumet, or sacred pipe, represents a column of smoke (the soul) rising form a world center.Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. A Dictionary of Symbols. Penguin Books: London, 1996. . pp.148‚Äì149 A mandala creates a world center within the boundaries of its two- dimensional space analogous to that created in three-dimensional space by a shrine.Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. . p.52-54 In the Classical elements and the Vedic Pancha Bhoota the axis mundi corresponds to Aether, the quintessence. Yggdrasil, the World Ash in Norse myths =Plants= Plants often serve as images of the axis mundi. The image of the Cosmic Tree provides an axis symbol that unites three planes: sky (branches), earth (trunk) and underworld (roots).Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. . p.42-45 In some Pacific island cultures the banyan tree, of which the Bodhi tree is of the Sacred Fig variety, is the abode of ancestor spirits. In Hindu religion, the banyan tree is considered sacred and is called ashwath vriksha (\\"I am banyan tree among trees\\" ‚Äì Bhagavad Gita). It represents eternal life because of its seemingly ever- expanding branches. The Bodhi tree is also the name given to the tree under which Gautama Siddhartha, the historical Buddha, sat on the night he attained enlightenment. The Mesoamerican world tree connects the planes of the Underworld and the sky with that of the terrestrial realm. The Yggdrasil, or World Ash, functions in much the same way in Norse mythology; it is the site where Odin found enlightenment. Other examples include Jievaras in Lithuanian mythology and Thor's Oak in the myths of the pre-Christian Germanic peoples. The Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil in Genesis present two aspects of the same image. Each is said to stand at the center of the Paradise garden from which four rivers flow to nourish the whole world. Each tree confers a boon. Bamboo, the plant from which Asian calligraphy pens are made, represents knowledge and is regularly found on Asian college campuses. The Christmas tree, which can be traced in its origins back to pre-Christian European beliefs, represents an axis mundi.Chevalier, Jean and Gheerbrandt, Alain. A Dictionary of Symbols. Penguin Books: London, 1996. . pp.1025‚Äì1033 Vitruvian Man by Leonardo da Vinci (c. 1492) =Human figure= The human body can express the symbol of world axis.Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. . p.54 Some of the more abstract Tree of Life representations, such as the sefirot in Kabbalism and in the chakra system recognized by Hinduism and Buddhism, merge with the concept of the human body as a pillar between heaven and earth. Disciplines such as yoga and tai chi begin from the premise of the human body as axis mundi. The Buddha represents a world centre in human form.Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Indian Symbolisms of Time and Eternity' in Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. . p.76 Large statues of a meditating figure unite the human figure with the symbolism of temple and tower. Astrology in all its forms assumes a connection between human health and affairs and the orientation of these with celestial bodies. World religions regard the body itself as a temple and prayer as a column uniting earth to heaven. The ancient Colossus of Rhodes combined the role of human figure with those of portal and skyscraper. The image of a human being suspended on a tree or a cross locates the figure at the axis where heaven and earth meet. The Renaissance image known as the Vitruvian Man represented a symbolic and mathematical exploration of the human form as world axis. =Homes= Homes can represent world centers. The symbolism for their residents is the same as for inhabitants of palaces and other sacred mountains. The hearth participates in the symbolism of the altar and a central garden participates in the symbolism of primordial paradise. In some Asian cultures houses were traditionally laid out in the form of a square oriented toward the four compass directions. A traditional home was oriented toward the sky through feng shui, a system of geomancy, just as a palace would be. Traditional Arab houses are also laid out as a square surrounding a central fountain that evokes a primordial garden paradise. Mircea Eliade noted that \\"the symbolism of the pillar in [European] peasant houses likewise derives from the 'symbolic field' of the axis mundi. In many archaic dwellings the central pillar does in fact serve as a means of communication with the heavens, with the sky.\\"Mircea Eliade. 'Br√¢ncu»ôi and Mythology' in Symbolism, the Sacred, and the Arts. Continuum, 1992. . p. 100 The nomadic peoples of Mongolia and the Americas more often lived in circular structures. The central pole of the tent still operated as an axis but a fixed reference to the four compass points was avoided.Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. A Dictionary of Symbols. Penguin Books: London, 1996. . pp.529‚Äì531 The caduceus =Shamanic function= A common shamanic concept, and a universally told story, is that of the healer traversing the axis mundi to bring back knowledge from the other world. It may be seen in the stories from Odin and the World Ash Tree to the Garden of Eden and Jacob's Ladder to Jack and the Beanstalk and Rapunzel. It is the essence of the journey described in The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri. The epic poem relates its hero's descent and ascent through a series of spiral structures that take him from through the core of the earth, from the depths of Hell to celestial Paradise. It is also a central tenet in the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex. Anyone or anything suspended on the axis between heaven and earth becomes a repository of potential knowledge. A special status accrues to the thing suspended: a serpent, a victim of crucifixion or hanging, a rod, a fruit, mistletoe. Derivations of this idea find form in the Rod of Asclepius, an emblem of the medical profession, and in the caduceus, an emblem of correspondence and commercial professions. The staff in these emblems represents the axis mundi while the serpents act as guardians of, or guides to, knowledge.Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. A Dictionary of Symbols. Penguin Books: London, 1996. . pp.142‚Äì145 Modern expressions A modern artistic representation of the axis mundi is the Colonne sans fin (The Endless Column, 1938) an abstract sculpture by Romanian Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi. The column takes the form of a \\"sky pillar\\" () upholding the heavens even as its rhythmically repeating segments invite climb and suggest the possibility of ascension.Mircea Eliade.

The BMA's internationally renowned collection of 95,000 objects encompasses more than 1,000 works by Henri Matisse anchored by the Cone Collection of modern art, as well as one of the nation's finest holdings of prints, drawings, and photographs. The galleries currently showcase collections of art from Africa; works by established and emerging contemporary artists; European and American paintings, sculpture, and decorative arts; ancient Antioch mosaics; art from Asia, and textiles from around the world. The museum is distinguished by a neoclassical building designed in the 1920s by renowned American architect John Russell Pope and two landscaped gardens with 20th-century sculpture. The museum is located between Charles Village, to the east, Remington, to the south, Hampden, to the west; and south of the Roland Park neighborhoods, immediately adjacent to the Homewood campus of Johns Hopkins University, though the museum is an independent institution and not affiliated with the university. The highlight of the museum is the Cone Collection, brought together by Baltimore sisters Claribel (1864-1929) and Etta Cone (1870-1949). Accomplished collectors, the sisters amassed a wealth of works by artists including Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Paul C√©zanne, Edgar Degas, Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh, and Pierre-August Renoir, nearly all of which were donated to the museum. The museum is also home to 18,000 works of French mid-19th-century art from the George A. Lucas collection, which has been acclaimed by the museum as a cultural \\"treasure\\" and \\"among the greatest single holdings of French art in the country.\\"Stanley Mazaroff, A Paris Life, A Baltimore Treasure, Chapter Fourteen, Johns Hopkins University Press, 2018. The BMA is currently led by Director Christopher Bedford, who was appointed in May 2016, after a year-long search. Prior to joining the BMA, Bedford led the Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University in Massachusetts for four years. He helped the Rose Art Museum out of the international controversy from 2009, when the university proposed selling off the museum's top-notch art collection to help with its struggling finances. In November 2019, it was announced that the Baltimore Museum of Art will only purchase works made by female- identifying artists in 2020. The decision was made in efforts to work towards ‚Äúre-correcting the canon.‚Äù To also mark the 100th anniversary of 19th amendment in 2020, all 22 exhibitions planned for the museum that year will be focused on women artists. Since October 2006, The Baltimore Museum of Art and the Walters Art Museum (formerly Walters Art Gallery), have offered free general admission year-round as a result of grants given by Baltimore City, Baltimore County, and several foundations. The Baltimore Museum of Art is the site of Gertrude's Chesapeake Kitchen, owned and operated by chef John Shields. History In February, 1904, a major fire destroyed much of the central part of the downtown business district of the city of Baltimore. In response, the municipal government established a city-wide congress to develop a master plan for the city's recovery and future growth and development. The congress, headed by Dr. A.R.L. Dohme, decided that a major deficiency of the city was the lack of an art museum. This decision led to the formation of an 18-person Committee on the Art Museum, with art dealer and industrialist Henry H. Wiegand as chairman. Ten years later, the museum was officially incorporated on November 16, 1914. Along with Minneapolis and Cleveland, Baltimore's museum was \\"modeled after two prominent 1870s predecessors, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston\\". According to a booklet published at the time of incorporation, it was stated that Baltimore lagged behind other cities ‚Äúin regard to matters of aesthetic interest.‚Äù Still without a permanent site, the fledgling museum was founded with but a single painting, William Sergeant Kendall's Mischief, which was donated by Dr. Dohme himself. As the museum's founders were confident that more art would eventually be acquired, the nearby Peabody Institute agreed to hold the collection for a time until a permanent home was established. The committee began planning a permanent home for the museum's holdings. In 1916, a building was purchased on the southwest corner of North Charles and West Biddle Streets as a possible location for the museum. Although an architect was employed to remodel it, it was never occupied. By 1915 the group had decided to permanently house the museum in the Wyman Park area, west of the then named Peabody Heights (later Charles Village) neighborhood. By 1917, the group had received a promise from Johns Hopkins University for the land further south of the new Georgian Revival architecture-Federal styled campus they were in the process of moving to. This prospective plot was near the old Homewood Mansion of 1800 and the later Italianate style mansion of \\"Wyman Villa\\" of a Hopkins donor and trustee, William Wyman, which would see them leave their downtown site at North Howard Street and West Centre, which they had occupied since 1876. However, before finally moving into its permanent home in 1929, the museum was temporarily moved in July 1922 to the former home of their prime benefactor and foundress, Mary Elizabeth Garrett (1857‚Äì1915), at 101 West Monument Street, on the southwest corner with Cathedral Street (facing West Mount Vernon Place and the Washington Monument). Garrett, a famous philanthropist in her own right who also further endowed the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, was the only daughter of John Work Garrett (1820‚Äì1884), the Civil War-era President of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, supporter of President Abraham Lincoln, and scion of the noted Robert Garrett banking firm in the city. In 1923, the museum's inaugural exhibition opened there with attendance topping 6,775 during its first week. The house was offered by Miss M. Cary as a home for the \\"collections\\" and a meeting place for the board of trustees. The old Garrett mansion was acquired in 1925 by the group of art enthusiasts who bought the property for the purpose of keeping the museum intact. Despite having limited space, the museum offered accommodations to art associations and a hall for meetings. Meanwhile, back at Wyman Park, prominent architect John Russell Pope (1874‚Äì1937) was engaged to design the museum's permanent home. With his years of study in Europe, Pope is considered to be the main examplar of the classical revival style that proved so popular with traditional American architects. He is credited with a number of major buildings along the American east coast and abroad, including the National Archives Building in Washington, New York's American Museum of Natural History, and the Tate Gallery Sculpture Hall in London. His distinct brand of classicism, both serene and monolithic, was perhaps the perfect choice for such an ambitious project. The cornerstone was laid on October 20, 1927, facing the future Art Museum Drive running diagonally from North Charles Street. The systems engineering for the building's original design was completed by Henry Adams, noted local mechanical engineer. The building consists of three floors and includes several rooms that were reconstructed and/or replicated from six local Maryland historic houses before their loss or razing. The building phase was marked by controversy over its location, cost, and the quality of workmanship, but on April 19, 1929, it opened on schedule without much fanfare. The first visitors were greeted by Rodin's The Thinker in the Sculpture Court, and most of the objects on display were lent by Baltimore and Maryland collectors. An average of 584 visitors attended the museum each day during its first two months. By the 1930s, the public reception was such that director Roland McKinney, in a letter to board chairman Henry Treide, noted, \\"People seem to feel that the Museum belongs to them and show that they are sincerely proud of it and its activities.\\" Unfortunately, these people were mostly upper-crust, privileged, and white, a fact noted in a 1937 Carnegie Corporation report. \\"[Baltimore] cultural institutions (outside of the library and the schools) have appealed to, been intended for, and been supported by a pretty small minority... they need to be opened up, for the viewpoint of the entire community and its needs\\", it concluded. Local artists were feeling slighted, as well. ‚ÄúWe, the living, resent being left to work in a vacuum of indifference and neglect while so much of the dead past is exhausted [by the BMA],‚Äù the president of the Artists‚Äô Union of Baltimore complained to The Evening Sun in 1937. The writer of the letter was Morris Louis, whose work, decades later, would be in the BMA's contemporary collection. Treide responded with an extensive community outreach survey and, in 1939, presented the city's first exhibition of African-American art. The show drew over 12,000 visitors in two weeks. Many of the objects lent to the museum when it opened were eventually donated to it. Among the donors who have shaped the museum's collection are Blanche Adler, Dr. Claribel Cone and Etta Cone, Jacob Epstein, Edward J. Gallagher, Jr., John W. and Robert Garrett, Mary Frick Jacobs, Ryda H. and Robert H. Levi, Saidie Adler May, Dorothy McIlvain Scott, Elsie C. Woodward, and Alan and Janet Wurtzburger. The growing collection is reflected in the three major expansions: the Saidie A. May Wing in 1950, the Woodward Wing in 1956, and the Cone Wing in 1957. These additions were all designed by local architects Wrenn, Lewis and Jencks to harmonize with the original Pope Building. Today, the BMA's collection includes more than 95,000 objects, making it the largest art museum in Maryland. It is governed by a private board of trustees and receives funding from the City of Baltimore; Baltimore County, Carroll, and Howard counties; the State of Maryland; various corporations and foundations; federal agencies; individual Trustees; and many private citizens. The BMA welcomes more than 200,000 visitors annually. In addition to its art collection, it organizes and hosts traveling exhibitions and serves as a major arts center for the region through its programs. Recent developments = Art acquisitions and commissions = In 2018, the BMA announced its intention to sell seven works by artists already well-represented in the collection in order to acquire more contemporary works by women and artists of color. This initiative led to the addition of works by Mark Bradford, Isaac Julian, Wangechi Mutu, Amy Sherald, Carrie Mae Weems, Jack Whitten, Lynette Yiadom- Boakye, and other notable contemporary artists. Many of these works will be on view in a major reinstallation of the Contemporary Wing that focuses on the creativity of 20th- and 21st-century black artists. In fall 2019, the BMA will also transform the East Lobby with a major new work by internationally acclaimed artist Mickalene Thomas as part of the Robert E. Meyerhoff and Rheda Becker Biennial Commission. This endowment gift is the first named public art commission in the U.S. and includes a curatorial fellowship to help strengthen the diversity of the museum. =Renovation= The BMA completed a $28 million renovation (2012‚Äì2015) that improved galleries for contemporary, American, African, and Asian art collections; improved essential infrastructure, and created more visitor amenities. The first phase of the BMA's renovation was completed in November 2012 with the reopening of the Contemporary Wing. In November 2014, after being closed for almost 30 years, the neoclassical Merrick Historic Entrance was reopened to the public to coincide with the museum's 100-year anniversary. The next phase encompassed the Dorothy McIlvain Scott American Wing, comprising the first and second floors of the BMA's original 1929 building designed by the acclaimed American architect John Russell Pope; the 1982 East Wing Lobby and Zamoiski East Entrance designed by Bower, Lewis & Thrower; and critically important upgrades to the museum's infrastructure. The architect for this phase of the renovation was the Baltimore-based architecture firm Ziger/Snead, with construction completed by Whiting-Turner Contracting Company of Towson, Maryland. The project manager was Synthesis, Inc., of Columbia, Maryland. The BMA also greatly expanded galleries for its African and Asian art collections, which opened in April 2015. The culmination of the renovation was the opening of the new $4.5 million, Patricia and Mark Joseph Education Center in October 2015. The renovation was funded by the museum's philanthropic campaign, In a New Light: The Campaign for The Baltimore Museum of Art, which raised $80.7 million and added more than 4,000 artworks to the collection during the decade leading up to the BMA's 100th anniversary. Collections =African art= The BMA was one of the first museums in the United States to obtain a collection of African art. A large part of the collection was donated by Janet and Alan Wurtzburger in 1954. It contains more than 2,000 objects whose sources range from ancient Egypt to contemporary Zimbabwe, and includes works from many other cultures, including Bamana, Yoruba, Kuba, Ndebele. The collection includes many different forms of art, including headdresses, masks, figures, royal staffs, textiles, jewelry, ceremonial weapons, and pottery. Several of the pieces are known for their use in royal courts, performances, and religious contexts, and many are internationally known. Highlights of the collection include works by carvers Zlan and Sonzanlwon, and figures by the legendary brasscaster Ldamie. Also on display are a Lozi throne (c. 1900) most likely carved in the court of King Lewanika of western Zambia, a 20th-century Hausa Koranic prayer board, and a 2006 video work by Theo Eshetu. At least several of the masks and figurative sculptures are recognized internationally as the best of their type. =American art= The BMA's American art collection includes paintings, sculptures, and decorative arts spanning from the colonial era to the late 20th century. The museum has several works of art from the Baltimore area, including portraiture by Charles Willson Peale, Rembrandt Peale, and other members of the Peale family; silver from Baltimore's prominent silver manufacturing company Samuel Kirk & Son; Baltimore album quilts; and painted furniture by John Finlay and Hugh Finlay of Baltimore. The American painting collection at the museum ranges from 18th- century portraits and 19th-century landscape painting to American Impressionism and modernism, with works by artists John Singleton Copley, Thomas Sully, Thomas Eakins, John Singer Sargent, Childe Hassam, and Thomas Hart Benton. Notable canvases include A Wild Scene (1831‚Äì1832) by Thomas Cole, La Vach√®re (1888) by Theodore Robinson, and Pink Tulip (1926) by Georgia O'Keeffe. These are complemented by holdings of prints and drawings, as well as modern photographs from the Gallagher/Dalsheimer Collection. Artists represented include Imogen Cunningham, Man Ray, Paul Strand, and Alfred Stieglitz. The BMA has a long record of collecting works by African American artists that began in 1939 with one of the first exhibitions of African American art in the country. This collection has grown with the addition of works by 19th- and 20th-century African-American artists Joshua Johnson, Jacob Lawrence, Edmonia Lewis, Horace Pippin, and Henry Ossawa Tanner, as well as numerous works by contemporary artists. The BMA's holdings of American decorative arts include an extensive furniture collection that represents the major historic cabinetmaking centers of Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston. Many of these objects came from Dorothy McIlvain Scott, a generous Baltimore philanthropist and collector. A gift in 1933 by Mrs. Miles White, Jr. of over 200 pieces of Maryland silver formed the nucleus of a silver collection that now encompasses objects by leading 18th- and early 19th-century silversmiths in Annapolis and Baltimore, as well as examples of early English silver owned by Maryland families during the Federal era. Among them is the Annapolis Subscription Plate, made by Annapolis silver smith John Inch and the oldest surviving silver object made in Maryland. Later masterworks by artists from Louis Comfort Tiffany to Georg Jensen are also on view. Other notable aspects of the decorative arts collection include a rare set of five clerestory windows and two mosaic-clad architectural columns that represent Tiffany's contribution to 20th-century ornament. Period rooms from six historic Maryland houses, along with architectural elements from other historic buildings, illustrate town and country building styles from the 18th and 19th centuries, and miniature rooms made by Chicago miniaturist Eugene Kupjack that invite scrutiny of a variety of decorative styles at close range. =Antioch mosaics= The BMA exhibits a collection of Antioch mosaics, the result of its participation in excavations of this ancient city, known today as Antakya in southeastern Turkey, near the border of Syria. With the support of BMA Trustee Robert Garrett, the Baltimore Museum of Art joined the Mus√©es Nationaux de France, Worcester Art Museum, and Princeton University during the excavations of 1932 to 1939, discovering 300 mosaic pavements in and around the lost city. The BMA received some of the mosaics from the excavation, totaling 34 pavements, 28 of which are on display in the museum's sunlit atrium court. Discovered in the affluent suburb of Daphne and the nearby port city of Seleucia Pieria, the mosaics date from the days of the emperor Hadrian in the 2nd century A.D. to the Christian empire of Justinian in the 6th century, bridging the Classical world and the early Middle Ages. The mosaics illustrate how the classical art of Greece and Rome evolved into the art of the early Christian era, and tell the story of how people lived in this ancient city prior to its destruction by catastrophic earthquakes in 526 and 528 A.D. The mosaics are notable for their grand scale and elaborately patterned borders, and the brilliance of their decorative and naturalistic effects. =Art of the ancient Americas= Ancient woman with child. Maya or Jaina. 7th-10th century. The Baltimore Museum of Art: Gift of John and Marisol Stokes, Upper Nyack, New York. BMA 2006.117 This collection contains works from 59 distinct artistic traditions from Aztec and Maya of Mesoamerica, Chim√∫ and Muisca of Andean South America, and Nicoya and Atlantic Watershed of Costa Rica. The collection includes works from 2500 BC to AD 1521. The core collection of 120 objects was given to the museum by Alan Wurtzburger in 1958, which significantly expanded the scope of the existing collection and provided momentum for a traveling exhibition of Peruvian ceramics titled Myths of Ancient Peru (1969). The collection is particularly admired for its West Mexico ceramics, including an important Nayarit house model and an enthroned chief. Also on display is a unique assemblage of 23 figures in dance regalia which celebrates ancient performance and highlights the diversity of Colima art. Other notable pieces include a finely worked serpentine figure of Olmec mastery, elegant portrayals of Maya and Aztec noblewomen showcasing the integral roles women played in the social, political, economic, and spiritual realms of society, and miniature gold votives in the Muisca tradition. =Art of the Pacific Islands= left This exhibit includes artwork from several cultural traditions of the Pacific Islands, including Melanesia and Polynesia. Works in collection include jewelry, ornaments, and tapa cloths. Of notable interest is a finely carved lizard of dark wood and shell from Easter Island; a battle pectoral created from hundreds of Nassa shells, which highlights Middi art of New Britain; and an 18th-century royal Hawaiian necklace. Other highlights of the collection include a breast ornament embellished with small birds and stars that figured as insignia of prestige for the Tonga of the Fiji Islands. Featuring whale ivory and pearl shell design, it is recognized as one of the largest of its kind. =Asian art= The museum's Asian art collection includes works from China, Japan, India, Tibet, Southeast Asia, and the Near East. The collection is particularly known for its Chinese ceramics, with a particular depth in mortuary wares from the Tang Dynasty (618‚Äì907) and utilitarian stoneware from the 11th through the 13th centuries. Although more than 1,000 objects are comprised in this collection, because of limited space, only a portion of the pieces are on display at one time. Works are on view in rotating installations in the museum's Julius Levy Memorial Gallery. Some notable works in the collection include the life-sized early-15th-century bronze Guanyin, known widely as \\"Goddess of Mercy\\"; the robust figure of a horse from a Han dynasty tomb; a 39-piece mortuary retinue, a rare example of the quantities of clay figures that were placed in tombs during the early Tang dynasty; and an outstanding foliate-shaped brush washer that represents the mastery of Chinese blue-and-white porcelain. Asian art is also represented in other areas of the museum's collection, including 475 Japanese prints and 1,000 textiles from across Asia. =European art= Sir Anthony van Dyck. Rinaldo and Armida. 1629. The Baltimore Museum of Art: The Jacob Epstein Collection, BMA 1951.103 Paysage Bords de Seine, 1879 by Pierre Auguste Renoir, was stolen in 1951 and resurfaced in 2012. The European art collection at the BMA contains works from the 15th through 19th centuries. Most of the collection was formed through donations made by private citizens of the city of Baltimore, notably Mary Frick Jacobs, George A. Lucas, and Jacob Epstein. The collection contains a large selection of 19th-century French art, including more than 140 bronze animal sculptures by Antoine-Louis Barye and several paintings by Barbizon artists such as Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot and impressionist Camille Pissarro. The collection includes a wide array of decorative arts, including jeweled snuff boxes, porcelain, and silver. The museum also exhibits a large collection of works on paper from the 15th through the 19th century. Highlights of the European art exhibit include Sir Anthony van Dyck's Rinaldo and Armida (1629), which was commissioned by King Charles I of England. It is considered one of the artist's finest paintings. Other items of northern European and French art include Frans Hals' portrait Dorothea Berck (1644), Rembrandt van Rijn's painting of his son Titus (1660), Jean-Baptiste-Sim√©on Chardin‚Äôs portrayal of a lovely maiden tossing a ball in The Game of Knucklebones (c. 1734), and French court portraitist Louise √âlisabeth Vig√©e Le Brun's exotic Princess Anna Alexandrovna Galitzin (c. 1797). Medieval and Renaissance works include a 14th-century Burgundian Virgin and Child carved of limestone and Titian's Portrait of a Gentleman (1561). There are also late-medieval and Renaissance paintings by Giovanni dal Ponte, Biagio D'Antonio, Sandro Botticelli and Workshop, Bernardino Luini, Francesco Ubertini, and Master of View of Saint Gudule. In 2012, Paysage Bords de Seine, a Renoir stolen from the museum, resurfaced after being lost for 63 years. The painting then became the subject of a dramatic legal dispute involving the FBI, the woman who said she found the painting, an insurance company's rights to the artwork, and the intentions of Saidie May, an art collector who bought the painting in Paris in 1925 and lent it to the Baltimore museum. In 2014, a judge deemed it to be the property of the BMA after reviewing related documentation from its archives. At the time of the theft, Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. paid the museum about $2,500 for the loss. The company considered whether to make a claim for the painting when it resurfaced, but decided it \\"belonged\\" at the museum. =Cone Collection= alt= Baltimore sisters Claribel and Etta Cone amassed one of the most important collections of modern art in the U.S. and gave it to the BMA in 1949. Etta Cone began the Cone Collection in 1898 with the purchase of five paintings by American Impressionist Theodore Robinson to decorate their Baltimore home. Soon after, the sisters began to make annual trips to Paris where they visited museums, salons, and the studios of emerging artists. In 1906, Etta purchased her first work by Henri Matisse during a visit with the artist arranged by Gertrude Stein‚Äôs sister-in-law, Sarah Stein. The Cone sisters were among the artist's first patrons and Etta, in particular, collected works throughout his entire career. Their collection of approximately 3,000 objects included 500 works by Matisse, as well as masterworks by Pablo Picasso, Vincent van Gogh, and Paul C√©zanne, which were displayed in their Baltimore apartments prior to coming to the museum. =Contemporary art= The BMA's Contemporary Wing was built and opened in 1994, closed in January 2011 for renovations, and reopened in November 2012 with new wall and floor finishes; a gallery dedicated to light, sound, and moving image-based art; a dedicated gallery for prints, drawings and photographs; and BMA Go Mobile, a mobile website guide. The renovated wing houses a two-part architectural intervention that made the BMA the first museum in the United States to commission and acquire a site-specific installation by artist Sarah Oppenheimer. The collection features works by Olafur Eliasson, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Franz West, Yayoi Kusama, Donald Judd, and other eminent artists alongside new acquisitions from 21st- century artists such as Guyton \\\\ Walker, Josephine Meckseper, Sarah Sze, and Rirkrit Tiravanija. The works of American artist Bruce Nauman, known for his work with neon lights, can be seen both in the contemporary collection and adorning the outside of the museum itself with his piece Violins, Violence, Silence. The BMA has the second largest collection of Andy Warhol's late work in the U.S. The Contemporary Wing will be reinstalled again in summer 2019 with a new presentation of 20th- and 21st-century art that focuses on the creativity of black artists such as Roy DeCarava, David Driskell, Joyce J. Scott, Lorna Simpson, and Jack Whitten. See also Henry Walters * William Thompson Walters References Further reading Flam, Jack.

Corporate history The original Bruegger's in Troy, New York Bruegger's was founded in 1983 by Nordahl Brue and Mike Dressell, with the first store opening in Troy, New York. The business was bought by Quality Dining (a franchisee) in June 1996 for $142 million in stock, with the founders joining the Quality Dining board. The merge was not a comfortable one; within a short period Brue and Dressell became concerned with the ongoing operations and scope for growth, leading to a critical U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing alleging a lack of strategic direction. Holding a combined 26% stake, Brue and Dressell called for reorganization of Quality Dining, resulting in Bruegger's being resold to Brue and Dressel in October 1997 for $45 million. Brue has since referred to the original sale as part of his \\"biggest mistake\\". In May 2003, James J. Greco and Sun Capital Partners acquired the company from the founders.

It was established as a village in 1924 at the consolidation of the villages of Fairview and North Pocatello which were platted on the northern boundary of the town of Pocatello in 1911 and 1914 respectively. New commercial and residential development in Alameda occurred in part as a result of its proximity to Pocatello and to a greater degree its location on the Yellowstone Highway (later U.S. Route 91), one of Idaho's first designated highways. By 1930, the village exceeded its predecessor villages' 1920 population by 144%. In just under forty years of history, the village became Idaho's eleventh most populous city. It was consolidated with Pocatello in 1962, with the support of its mayor, George Hansen, who later served seven terms as a congressman. Another nearby city, Chubbuck, opposed a similar merger and remained a separate municipality. Among its other businesses, Alameda had four pharmacies: Grand Central Pharmacy (300 block of Jefferson), Poleline Drug (Poleline Road), Alameda Pharmacy (375 Yellowstone) and Hiway Drug (320 Yellowstone).Personal Recollection, Steven N.

Botzum began as a community along the Ohio and Erie Canal where the canal spread out to form the Yellow Creek Basin near Yellow Creek. This was thought to be a good place for business. There were two warehouses, a store, and a hotel there in 1827, set up by Nathaniel Hardy. Botzum was platted in 1836 on 100 acres (0.4 km) as Niles by Peter Voris and some of his associates. The village was never actually built, though, due to the Panic of 1837. Eventually the lots were sold off, one of them to George Botzum. In 1866 the Buckeye post office opened up. In spite of this name, though, the railroad depot in town was called Botzum. The name of the post office was also changed to Botzum in 1893 to match the name of the depot. In the 1920s the city of Akron purchased 800 acres (3.2 km) of land at Botzum to build a sewage treatment plant, which opened in 1928 and remains there to this day. There is no longer any sign that there was a community there. Along with the sewage plant it is known for a viewing station for great blue herons to the east where Bath Road crosses the Cuyahoga River.

It may be considered part of the New Testament apocryphal tradition. The Naassenes (from Hebrew na'asch, snake) were a Gnostic Ophite sect. The fragmentary quotation is given by Hippolytus as expressing the fundamental ideas of the Naassene Ophites, and possibly of all Gnostics. Text =G.R.S. Mead= Translation by G.R.S. Mead: > First [was there] Mind the Generative Law of All; > Second to the Firstborn was Liquid Chaos; > Third Soul through toil received the Law. > Wherefore, with a deer's form surrounding her, > She labours at her task beneath Death's rule. > Now, holding sway, she sees the Light; > And now, cast into piteous plight, she weeps; > Now she weeps, and now rejoices; > Now she weeps, and now is judged; > Now is judged, and now she dieth; > Now is born, with no way out for her; in misery > She enters in her wandering the labyrinth of ills. > And Jesus said: O Father, see! > [Behold] the struggle still of ills on earth! > Far from Thy Breath away she wanders! > She seeks to flee the bitter Chaos, > And knows not how she shall pass through. > Wherefore, send me, O Father! > Seals in my hands, I will descend; > Through √Üons universal will I make a Path; > Through Mysteries all I'll open up a Way! > And Forms of Gods will I display; > The secrets of the Holy Path I will hand on, > And call them Gnosis. =Adolf von Harnack= The following is Adolf von Harnack's paraphrase (SBA, 1902, pp. 542 sqq.): > The generating principle of the universe, the first in order, was 'reason'; > but the second principle was the firstbom's emitted 'chaos'; and the third > principle was received by the soul, which descends from both.

Therefore, send me, O Father, with the seals in my hand will I > descend: all eons will I traverse, all mysteries reveal, and show the forms > of the gods. I will deliver the secret of the holy way, and call it Gnosis.\\" Significance Here, reason and chaos, the intelligent and the material world, stand opposed; and between them is the human soul, belonging to both spheres, yet striving toward the higher and the spiritual. The soul is unable to ascend by its own power; therefore, a heavenly being, concordant with the will of the supreme principle, descends into the human world and redeems the soul by showing it the way through the spheres which sunder it from the world divine. It is not mere thirst for knowledge that impels the Gnostics, but essentially a concern of salvation; because the Gnostic's salvation depends on the possession of the Gnosis respecting these things. Like Gnosis at large, the Ophites teach the existence of a Supreme Being, standing infinitely high above the visible world; qualified as purely spiritual, the primal basis of all things, the starting-point of the cosmic process. His names are, Father of the Universe, First Man, the \\"Uncreated,\\" the \\"Unspeakable,\\" the \\"Unapproachable God.\\" He is self-evolving, and thus becomes the source of all being. The first products of this spontaneous evolution still belong to the purely spiritual spheres. The Ophitic theology tends to separate this supreme God into an ever-increasing number of separate entities. In the aforesaid Hymn, only the Son is mentioned beside the Father; but a tetrad occurs among the Ophites of Irenaeus and the Naassenes; an entire decad among the Gnostici Barbelo; while the Nag Hammadi writings disclose a countless host of higher beings. The Supreme Being's mode of evolution is set forth, now as a generative, again as a psychologic process; and frequently the two ideas are combined. Some pagan mythology lies obviously at the root of the matter; which accounts also for their syzygial views; for, in part at least, the Ophites aimed to interpret the ancient myths as psychologic processes. Over against the Supreme Being stands chaos, the material principle. Yet there is not here a sharp dualism. In the Hymn, the phrase \\"the firstborn's emitted chaos\\" implies that it is derived from a higher being. In only very few instances is chaos an evil power, an active principle. It is not the existence of chaos which contradicts perfection; but rather the mixture of luminous parts with material elements. This mixture, in a word, is the great calamity, the loss that must be retrieved through redemption. How did this mixture come to pass? The Hymn designates the soul, the principle of this compound, as the common product of mind and chaos. Such is also the theory of the Perates and Sethians, mentioned by Hippolytus. These sects most nearly approach the dualistic scheme, yet the latter is not distinctly defined. In Justin, also, dualism is diminished.

It is considered to be the only Stradivarius in existence in as new state. It is in the collection of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, England. The violin, known as the Messiah (Messie in French), remained in Stradivari's workshop until his death in 1737. It was then sold by his son Paolo to Count Cozio di Salabue in 1775, and for a time, the violin bore the name Salabue. The instrument was then purchased by Luigi Tarisio in 1827. Upon Tarisio‚Äôs death, in 1854, the French luthier Jean Baptiste Vuillaume of Paris purchased The Messiah along with Tarisio's entire collection. \\"One day Tarisio was discoursing with Vuillaume on the merits of this unknown and marvelous instrument, when the violinist Jean-Delphin Alard, Vuillaume's son-in-law, exclaimed: 'Really, Mister Tarisio, your violin is like the Messiah of the Jews: one always expects him but he never appears' ('Vraiment, Monsieur Tarisio, votre violon est comme le Messie des Juifs: on l'attend toujours, mais il ne para√Æt jamais' Stradivarius, Dirk J Balfoort, Sdgwick and Jackson, London (undated)). Thus the violin was baptized with the name by which it is still known.\\"The Hill Collection of Musical Instruments, David D. Boyden, Oxford University Press, London, 1969 The Messiah was bequeathed by the family of W.E. Hill to the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford for preservation as \\"a yardstick for future violin makers to learn from\\". The violin is in like-new condition, as it was seldom played. The tonal potential of the instrument has been questioned due to the conditions of the Hill bequest. However it was played by the famous violinist Joseph Joachim, who stated in a letter of 1891 to the then owner of the Messiah, Robert Crawford, that he was struck by the combined sweetness and grandeur of the sound. Nathan Milstein played it at the Hills' shop before 1940 and described it as an unforgettable experience. It is one of the most valuable of all the Stradivari instruments. The top of the Messiah is made from the same tree as a P.G. Rogeri violin of 1710. The tuning pegs and the tailpiece (that shows the Nativity of Christ) are not original, but were added by Vuillaume.

He served from January 1981 until his resignation in April 1982.Texas Legislators Past and Present-Michael W. Martin In the 1980 general election, Martin, who then listed his occupation as a carpenter, unseated Democratic State Representative James E. Mankins, who was considered a prime possibility to become Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives. In the 1981 House session, Martin offered one bill, which never came to a vote, a proposal to require the teaching of creationism along with the theory of evolution in public school science classes. He was named as one of the \\"Ten Worst Legislators\\" by Texas Monthly magazine. Early life Martin became a police officer in 1971. He served in the Air Force from 1975 through 1979. Shooting In the summer of 1981, Martin was living in a recreational vehicle at a mobile home park in east Austin. Four shotgun blasts were fired at his vehicle on the night of July 31, and three struck Martin in his left arm. At first he attributed the shooting to a Satanic cult that he had reportedly been investigating. Thereafter, Charles Goff, a cousin of Martin's, said that he had fired the shots at Martin's behest to gain political sympathy for the young lawmaker who was contemplating a run for the Texas State Senate in 1982. Goff also said that Martin had offered him a high- paying state job. Martin fled, but Texas Rangers eventually apprehended Martin at his mother's farmhouse just outside Longview, where he was found hiding in a stereo cabinet. Martin was charged with perjury by Travis County District Attorney Ronnie Earle and subsequently resigned from the state House after a protracted legal fight. He pleaded guilty in April 1982 and was convicted of misdemeanor perjury and paid a $2000 fine, though his lawyer said he did not admit staging the shooting.  Texas Tale  Monday, Sept. 07, 1981  Afterward In the spring of 1982, voters in a special election returned Mankins to the vacant House seat. In 1984, he and his wife, Debbie Martin, later of Garland, Texas, divorced. In July 1986, Martin left with his two children, Michael Trent Martin (born 1978) and Arianna Martin (born 1981) to live and work in Wellington, New Zealand. A federal case was brought over the custody, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation allowed him to return the children to the United States late in 1988. By 2007, Martin said that the shots were the result of a road rage incident which he had instigated on South Congress Avenue in Austin, and he has given an account of the incident on his website. In 2007, Martin, then fifty-five and an electrical engineer for a hospital, was living in Travis County and ran for town council in Bee Cave under the name \\"Wayne Martin\\" and was defeated.

Of the 17.5 million long tons of U.S. Lend- Lease aid provided to Russia, 7.9 million long tons (45%) were sent through Iran.Immortal : A Military History of Iran and Its Armed Forces, Steven R. Ward, Georgetown University Press, 2009, pg. 176 This supply route originated in the US and UK with ships sailing around the Cape of Good Hope to the Persian Gulf. From there, the materiel transited Iran to the USSR. Other supply routes included the Northern route across the Arctic, and the Pacific Route which handled US cargo at Vladivostok and then used the Trans-Siberian Railway across the USSR. This Persian Route became the only viable, all- weather route to be developed to supply Soviet needs. Etymology English- language official documents from the Persian Corridor period continue to make the word \\"Persia\\" interchangeable with the name of Iran. In correspondence by the government of the United Kingdom, usage of \\"Persia\\" over \\"Iran\\" was chosen by Winston Churchill to avoid possible confusion with neighbouring Iraq.Churchill, Winston, The Second World War =Overthrow of the Shah= Following Germany's invasion of the USSR in June 1941, Britain and the Soviet Union became allies. Britain and the USSR saw the newly opened Trans-Iranian Railway as an attractive route to transport supplies from the Persian Gulf to the Soviet Union. Britain and the USSR used concessions extracted in previous interventions to pressure Iran (and, in Britain's case, Iraq) into allowing the use of their territory for military and logistical purposes. Increased tensions with Britain led to pro-German rallies in Tehran. In August 1941, because Reza Shah refused to expel all German nationals and come down clearly on the Allied side, Britain and the USSR invaded Iran, arrested the monarch and sent him into exile to South Africa, taking control of Iran's communications and the coveted railway. Alliances during the Second World War & The invasion of neutral Iran, 1939-1945. Reza Shah in exile. Son of Reza Shah meeting with F. D. Roosevelt at the Tehran Conference, 1943 In 1942 the United States, now an ally of Britain and the USSR in World War II, sent a military force to Iran to help maintain and operate sections of the railway. The British and Soviet authorities allowed Reza Shah's system of government to collapse, and they limited the constitutional government interfaces. They installed Reza Shah's son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi onto the Iranian/Persian throne. The new Shah soon signed an agreement pledging full non-military logistical cooperation with the British and Soviets, in exchange for full recognition of his country's independence, and also a promise to withdraw from Iran within six months of the war's conclusion (these assurances later proved essential in securing his country's independence after the war). In September 1943, the Shah went further, and he declared war on Germany. He signed the Declaration by United Nations entitling his country to a seat in the original United Nations. Two months later, he hosted the Tehran Conference between Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin. The presence of so many foreign troops in Iran accelerated social change and it roused nationalist sentiment in the country. In 1946, Hossein Gol-e-Golab published the nationalist song Ey Iran; it was reportedly inspired by an incident during the war in which Golab witnessed an American GI beating up a native Iranian greengrocer in a marketplace dispute. Strategic need for supply to the USSR After the British were pushed off the continent, Germany was essentially without any opposition in Europe. British and American leaders sought to eventually establish another front opened up to engage the German military. In June 1941 Hitler launched the invasion of the USSR. The western Allies made the strategic decision to provide Stalin with significant material support to ensure that the USSR could continue to engage a significant portion of the German military. Agreements were created (protocols) which clearly defined the type and amount of materiel that would be delivered within a given time frame. Due to German military action on the Northern route and the fact that it could not be traversed during part of the year, the US was unable to meet the demands of the first protocol. This caused increasing pressure on the Allies to develop the route using the Persian Corridor. Supply efforts The Allies delivered all manner of materiel to the Soviet Union ranging from Studebaker US6 trucks to American canned food. Most of the supplies transiting through the Persian Corridor arrived by ship at various ports in the Persian Gulf and were then carried northwards by railroad or in long truck convoys. Some goods were later reloaded onboard ships to cross the Caspian Sea and others continued their journey by truck. The United States Army forces in the corridor were originally under the Iran-Iraq Service Command - later renamed the Persian Gulf Service Command (PGSC). This was the successor to the original United States Military Iranian Mission, which had been put in place to deliver Lend-Lease supplies before the United States had entered the World War. The mission was originally commanded by Colonel Don G. Shingler, who was then replaced late in 1942 by Brigadier General Donald H. Connolly. Both the Iran-Iraq Service Command and the PGSC were subordinate to the U.S. Army Forces in the Middle East (USAFIME). PGSC was eventually renamed simply the Persian Gulf Command. =Statistics= Of the 17.5 million long tons of U.S. Lend-Lease aid provided to Russia, 7.9 million long tons (45%) were sent through Iran.Immortal : A Military History of Iran and Its Armed Forces, Steven R. Ward, Georgetown University Press, 2009, pg. 176 In addition to the Persian Corridor the Americans used Arctic Convoys to the ports of Murmansk and Archangelsk and Soviet shipping carried supplies from the west coast of the United States and Canada to Vladivostok in the Far East, since the Soviet Union was not at war with Japan until August 1945. The Persian Corridor was the route for 4,159,117 long tons (4,225,858 metric tonnes) of this cargo. However, this was not the only allied contribution via the Persian Corridor. About 7,900,000 long tons (8,000,000 metric tonnes) of shipborne cargo from Allied sources were unloaded in the Corridor, most of it bound for the USSR - but some of it for British forces under the Middle East Command, or for the Iranian economy, which was sustaining the influx of tens of thousands of foreign troops and Polish refugees. Also, supplies were needed for the development of new transportation and logistics facilities in Persia and in the Soviet Union. The tonnage figure does not include transfers of warplanes via Persia. =Supply routes= Persian Gulf Command, Camps - Posts - Stations Supplies came from as far away as Canada and the United States, and those were unloaded in Persian Gulf ports in Iran and Iraq. Once the Axis powers were cleared from the Mediterranean Sea in 1943 - with the Allied capture of Tunisia, Sicily, and southern Italy - cargo convoys were able to pass through the Mediterranean, the Suez Canal, and the Red Sea to Iran for shipment to the USSR. The main ports in the Corridor for supplies inbound to Iran were: in Iran, * Bushehr * Bandar Shahpur (now Bandar Imam Khomeini); and in Iraq, * Basra * Umm Qasr. The main overland routes were from the ports to Tehran, and then * Tehran ‚Äî Ashgabat or * Tehran ‚Äî Baku or, alternatively, * Basra ‚Äî Kazvin or * Dzhulfa ‚Äî Beslan. The main port for outbound supplies (via the Caspian Sea) was Nowshahr. Ships ferried supplies from this port to Baku or Makhachkala.

Many Allied civilian workers, such as stevedores and railway engineers, were also employed on the corridor. Many skilled engineers, accountants and other professionals who volunteered or were drafted into the armed services were made warrant officers to help oversee the complex supply operations. In addition to providing logistical support to the Iranians, the Allies offered other services as well. The Americans in particular were viewed as more neutral since they had no colonial past in the country as did the British and Soviets. The Americans contributed special expertise to the young Shah's government. Colonel Norman Schwarzkopf, Sr., who at the outbreak of the war was serving as superintendent of the New Jersey State Police was in August 1942 put in charge of training the Imperial Iranian Gendarmerie (his son, Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr., would command coalition forces fifty years later during the Persian Gulf War.) = Equipment = To help operate trains on the demanding Trans-Iranian Railway route, the US supplied large numbers of ALCO diesel locomotives, which were more suitable than steam locomotives. About 3000 pieces of rolling stock of various types were also supplied. File:Somewhere in the Persian corridor. A United States Army truck convoy carrying supplies for the aid of Russia.

Volga River to Stalingrad Beyond the Persian Corridor and across the Caspian Sea is the Volga River, flowing into the Caspian from the north. This was a key route into the core of the Soviet Union. Stalingrad, at the easternmost turn of the Volga, was an objective of the Germans in their 1942 campaign partly for reason of its industrial capacity, partly as a convenient place to block Soviet pressure on the flank of their initiative towards the Caucasus, and partly for its name. But it was also for blocking the river traffic carrying materiel north from the Persian Corridor. The Battle of Stalingrad (23 August 1942 ‚Äì 2 February 1943) reopened the river.

History Van Tassel was born in Jefferson, Ohio in 1910, and grew up in a fairly prosperous middle-class family. He finished high school in the 10th grade and held a job at a small municipal airport near Cleveland; he also acquired a pilot's license. At age 20, he moved to California, where at first he worked as an automobile mechanic at a garage owned by an uncle. While pumping gas at the garage, he met Frank Critzer, an eccentric loner who claimed to be working a mine somewhere near Giant Rock, a 7-story boulder near Landers, California in the Mojave Desert. Frank Critzer was a German immigrant trying to make a living in the desert as a prospector. During World War II, Critzer was under suspicion as a German spy and was killed by a dynamite explosion during a police siege at the Rock in 1942. Upon receiving news of Critzer's death, Van Tassel applied for a lease of the small abandoned airport near Giant Rock from the Bureau of Land Management, and was eventually given a Federal Government contract to develop and maintain the airstrip. Van Tassel became an aircraft mechanic and flight inspector who at various times between 1930 and 1947 worked for Douglas Aircraft, Hughes Aircraft, and Lockheed. While at Hughes Aircraft he was their Top Flight Inspector. In 1947, Van Tassel left Southern California's booming aerospace industry to live in the desert with his family. At first, he lived a simple existence in the rooms Frank Critzer had dug out under Giant Rock. Van Tassel eventually built a new home, a cafe, a gas station, a store, a small airstrip, and a dude ranch beside the Rock. George Van Tassel died of a heart attack in Landers, California in 1978. Integratron Historical marker near Integratron in Landers George Van Tassel started hosting group meditation in 1953 in a room underneath Giant Rock excavated by Frank Critzer. That year, according to Van Tassel the occupant of a space ship from the planet Venus woke him up, invited him on board his space ship, and both verbally and telepathically gave him a technique for rejuvenating the human body. In 1954, Van Tassel and others began building what they called the \\"Integratron\\" to perform the rejuvenation. According to Van Tassel, the Integratron was to be a structure for scientific research into time, anti-gravity and at extending human life, built partially upon the research of Nikola Tesla and Georges Lakhovsky. Van Tassel described the Integratron as being created for scientific and spiritual research with the aim to recharge and rejuvenate people's cells, \\"a time machine for basic research on rejuvenation, anti- gravity and time travel\\". The domed wood structure has a rotating metal apparatus on the outside he called an \\"electrostatic dirod\\". Van Tassel claimed it was made of non-ferromagnetic materials: wood, concrete, glass, and fibreglass, lacking even metal screws or nails. The Integratron was never fully completed due to Van Tassel's sudden death a few weeks before the official opening. In recent times some people who visit the unfinished Integratron claim to be rejuvenated by staying there, and experiencing \\"sound baths\\" inside. Conventions and organizations Van Tassel was a classic 1950s contactee in the mold of George Adamski, Truman Bethurum, Daniel Fry, Orfeo Angelucci and many others. He hosted \\"The Giant Rock Spacecraft Convention\\" annually beside the Rock, from 1953 to 1978, which attracted at its peak in 1959 as many as 10,000 attendees. Guests trekked to the desert by car or landed airplanes on Van Tassel's small airstrip, called Giant Rock Airport. Over the years, every famous contactee of the period appeared personally at these conventions, and many more not-so-famous ones. References often state that the first and most famous contactee, George Adamski, pointedly boycotted these conventions; however, Adamski did, in fact attend the third convention, held in 1955, where he gave a 35-minute lecture and was interviewed by Edward J. Ruppelt, once head of the Air Force Project Blue Book. It was apparently the only such convention Adamski ever attended. Van Tassel founded a metaphysics research organization called The Ministry of Universal Wisdom, and The College of Universal Wisdom to codify the spiritual revelations he was now regularly receiving via communications with the people from Space. Publications Van Tassel's book, I Rode A Flying Saucer (1952, 1955), recounts his claims of receiving \\"cosmic wisdom\\" from \\"Solgonda\\" and a large number of other people from space. Among his other works are Into This World and Out Again (1956), The Council of Seven Lights (1958), Religion and Science Merged, and When Stars Look Down.

Career Inspired by bulls and bullfighting in Mexico, Vavra moved to Spain in 1958 with a one-way ticket to Madrid on an old Italian ship The Valcania. With no formal training in animals, he spent six years studying the beasts. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt obtain the sort of photographs I wanted for the study, so I became a photographer out of necessity,‚Äù Vavra was quoted as saying.The Photography of Robert Vavra, Equus 241, November 2007 ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been interested in the camera ... I don‚Äôt really consider myself a photographer. I‚Äôm an artist and a storyteller.‚Äù He became immersed in the lore and life of this beast which culminated in the publishing of his book, Bulls of Iberia, in 1972. He was a personal friend of legendary matador de toros Juan Belmonte, riding with him on horseback to check his herds of black bulls, and he shared the dreams, fears, adventures and valor of other toreros, such as the American John Fulton.The San Diego Union - Tribune, February 24, 1998 In 1988, Vavra established a camp in Ololasurai, Kenya and began what would become a six-year stay with the tribal Maasai people, which led to the publication of A Tent With a View in 1991.The College Hill Independent, Brown University 2003 He has paid for the education of several Maasai children and financed the building of a school in Mexico, where, since its construction, more than 5000 boys and girls have learned to read and write. Novelist James Michener once wrote of Vavra: \\"Though equus has fired the imaginations of painters from Leonardo da Vinci, Velasquez, and Goya to Picasso; still, in the history of photography, no cameraman has recorded the horse with such excitement and personal style as has Robert Vavra.

The firm worked in the Beaux-Arts tradition for elite clients in New York City, Long Island and elsewhere, building townhouses, country houses, clubs, banks and buildings for colleges and private schools. Moving on from the classical and baroque Beaux-Arts repertory, they often designed in the neo-Georgian and neo-Federal styles, and many of their buildings were clad in brick with limestone or white marble trim, a combination which came to be their trademark. Early life and education Delano was born in New York City on January 21, 1874 and was a member of the prominent Delano family of Massachusetts. His parents were Eugene Delano (1844‚Äì1920) and Susan Magoun (n√©e Adams) Delano (1848‚Äì1904). His father was an 1866 graduate of Williams College and partner in Brown Brothers & Company banking and trading group. Among his siblings was Moreau Delano, also a banker with Brown Brothers; and two sisters, Caroline Delano, who married Augustus B. Wadsworth (a director of the Wadsworth Center); and Susan Delano, who married Charles W. McKelvey. His paternal grandparents were Moreau Delano and Sarah Ann (n√©e Abrams) Delano. He was a distant cousin of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Through his maternal aunt, Mary Elizabeth Adams Brown, he was the nephew of John Crosby Brown, the head of Brown Brothers & Company. Mary Elizabeth Adams(Brown) was the minister William Adams sister, who was Delano's maternal grandfather, and for whom he was named after. The minister William Adams'He was a son of John Adams (educator), Yale College 1795 (1772‚Äì1863), who was an American educator noted for organizing several hundred Sunday schools, and his wife Elizabeth Ripley, the daughter of Gamaliel Ripley and Judith Perkins and a great-great G=granddaughter of Union Theological Seminary. wife was Martha Bradshaw Magoun, who was the maternal grandmother of Delano, and she was the daughter of Thatcher Magoun (associated with the Thatcher Magoun clipper and 60 State Street) and Mary Bradshaw. Previously the minister William Adams was married to Susan Patten Magoun, sister of Martha Bradshaw, before Susan Patten died. A further connection between the families resides in the offspring of John Crosby Brown and Mary Elizabeth's six children, with a son Thatcher Magoun Brown named in honor of Thatcher Magoun, along with daughter Mary Magoun Brown, and their eldest child William Adams Brown, who like Delano was also named in honor of their grandfather the minister William Adams. Furthermore, Delano's father Eugene had made partner with the Philadelphia house of Brown Brothers & Co., meanwhile his mothers middle name is Magoun. Delano was educated at the Lawrenceville School and Yale University, where he served on the editorial board of campus humor magazine The Yale RecordYale Banner and Pot Pourri. New Haven: Yale University Press. 1923. p. 192. and was a member of Scroll and Key, and Columbia University's school of architecture. He also studied at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, receiving a diploma in 1903. Career He met his longstanding partner Chester Holmes Aldrich when they worked together at the office of Carr√®re and Hastings in the years before the turn of the 20th century. They formed their partnership after Delano's return from Europe in 1903 and almost immediately won commissions from the Rockefeller family, among others. Delano & Aldrich tended to adapt conservative Georgian and Federal architectural styles for their townhouses, churches, schools, and a spate of social clubs for the Astors, Vanderbilts, and the Whitneys. Separately (Delano was the more prolific) and in tandem they designed a number of buildings at Yale.Yale University Office of Facilities Delano taught at Columbia University from 1903 to 1910. Delano alone won the commission for the second-largest residence in the United States, Oheka, overlooking Cold Spring Harbor on Long Island, New York for financier Otto Kahn. Built from 1914 to 1919 in French chateau style, with gardens by Olmsted Brothers, Oheka ranges over 109,000 square feet (10,000 m¬≤) and was staffed with 125 people. In 1922, Delano designed the interiors of the Grand Central Art Galleries, an artists' cooperative established that year by John Singer Sargent, Edmund Greacen, Walter Leighton Clark, and others.\\"Painters and Sculptors' Gallery Association to Begin Work,\\" New York Times, December 19, 1922 Eight years later Delano and Aldrich were asked by the organization to design the U.S. Pavilion at the Venice Biennale.\\"American Art Show Opened at Venice,\\" New York Times, May 5, 1930 The purchase of the land, design, and construction was paid for by the Galleries and personally supervised by Clark.

It was sold to the Museum of Modern Art in 1954 and later to the Guggenheim Museum. Delano's irreverent sense of humor was subtly expressed in some his architectural details and friezes, such as the low-relief frieze of tortoises and hares in the apartment block at 1040 Park Avenue, and backgammon club rooms ornamented like backgammon boards. At the Marine Air Terminal at LaGuardia Airport, built for Pan American Airways' transatlantic seaplane service in 1939 and the oldest such passenger air facility still in use, his Art Deco terra cotta friezes feature flying fish. \\"There is as much that is new to be said in architecture today by a man of imagination who employs traditional motifs as there is in literature by an author, who, to express his thought, still employs the English language,\\" Delano wrote in 1928. Epinal American Memorial In Washington, D.C., Delano was the architect for the 1927 renovation to the White House, which later led to structural problems and rebuilding during the Truman Administration. (See White House Reconstruction.) He served on the National Capital Planning Commission and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts from 1924 to 1928, including a term as vice chairman in 1928. This service led to his firm receiving the design contract for the New Post Office building, completed in 1934, in the Federal Triangle complex. Delano served on the board of design for the 1939 New York World's Fair and consulted on the controversial White House Truman Balcony in 1946, prior to the reconstruction project of 1949‚Äì52. Delano's many awards and honors include election to the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1940. In 1948, Delano was commissioned to design the Epinal American Cemetery and Memorial (1948‚Äì56), one of fourteen World War II monuments constructed abroad by the American Battle Monuments Commission. Delano also designed terminals at La Guardia and Miami airports. He was named an officer by the French Legion of Honour and was an academician of the National Academy of Design.Thomas E. Luebke, ed., Civic Art: A Centennial History of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, 2013): Appendix B, 543.

Aldrich had left the partnership in 1935 to become the resident director of the American Academy at Rome, where he died in 1940. Marriage and descendants Delano married Louisa Millicent Sheffield (n√©e Potter) on May 23, 1907. His son, William Richard Potter Delano, was born on July 31, 1909.

It consists of a fragmentary fire-damaged parchment codex that was acquired by the Egyptian Museum of Berlin in 1961 (accessioned as Papyrus Berolinensis 22220). Its nature was only discovered in 1991, when it came round to being conserved (the sheer number of similar manuscripts being conserved causing the 30-year delay), and was revealed in a 1996 lecture by Charles W. Hedrick. It has been edited and translated into English by Hedrick and Paul Mirecki (Hedrick and Mirecki 1999) and by Bart D. Ehrman (Ehrman 2003). The fragmentary nature of the text admits of more than one sequential ordering of the contents, giving rise to more than one useful translation, and some public discussion (see ¬ß References). The manuscript appears to date from the 6th century; Hellenisms in the vocabulary and grammar suggest that it was translated from a lost Greek original. The hypothetic original Greek text on which it is based is thought to have been composed somewhere in the late second or early third century, judging from the theology and style. The Gospel is not a narrative but a dialogue, a form often chosen in Antiquity for didactic material. The content is heavily Gnostic in that salvation is available only to those who understand the secret knowledge (gnosis), and also shows parallels with the Gospel of Peter, in that the significance of the Crucifixion is somewhat watered down, being considered a part of a heavenly journey, an idea much more in keeping with a Gnostic world-view. The unnamed Saviour (assumed to be Jesus) engages in a dialogue with his apostles that is somewhat more personal than is found elsewhere. And at one point, the cross itself is addressed, as if it is a living creature, a companion rather than a device for death.
