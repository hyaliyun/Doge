The ghetto was created by the Third Reich in 1941 in the Polish town of Brzesko located in the Krak√≥w District about 40 miles from Krak√≥w. The ghetto was open when it was first created. In 1942, walls were put up and the ghetto became a closed ghetto. An estimated 4,000 Jewish people lived there but another 2,000 moved there by 1942, many arriving from Krak√≥w and the surrounding area. The Jewish people living within Brzesko were sent to the Be≈Ç≈ºec extermination camp and Auschwitz extermination camp. After the exterminations, the camp was closed end of 1942. Krakow and Tarnowalt=  Background  Before the town of Brzesko became a ghetto, about half of the population (2,119) was Jewish. When the Wehrmacht arrived in Brzesko on 5 September 1939, they took hostages from the Jewish population and demanded money from the town. The synagogue is also burnt down the same month. The town businesses owned by Jews were also forced to put signs up marking that they were owned by Jews and preventing future business. Many Jews were forced to leave their line of work and pick up new jobs given to them by the Germans forces which included many cleaning jobs. The people put into forced labor included men between the ages of 15 and 60. In addition, the Jews were outfitted with armbands displaying the Star of David on their right arm. After the armbands, the exclusion from many businesses and activities followed including that from restaurants, parks, and stores. Although they faced great discrimination in their town, many of the Jews still considered themselves citizens of the town and still felt obligated to improve it. In addition, burglaries were a problem in and around Brzesko before it became a ghetto. After the occupation of the town, the Germans would come to the town and shoot citizens. These citizens were both random and targeted by the Order Police. Some of the police involved included Wilhelm Rommelmann, Lapsch, and Beck. German Gendarmerie from Brzesko also murdered Jews from Brzesko and region and ethnic Poles.W. Curilla, Der Judenmord in Polen und die deutsche Ordnungspolizei 1939-1945, page 383 Some Jews from Krakow were resettled to Brzesko in March 1941.  Ghetto History  When the ghetto was first created in fall 1941 it was an open ghetto. It was marked by signs, but had no barriers to keep the Jewish people inside the town. The Jews were not allowed to leave and any movement in or out of the city was monitored. Having the ghetto opened allowed for smuggling of food in by nearby Aryan community. After it was closed, this responsibility fell on the Jewish Police. This section of Jewish Police was led by Diestler, an ex soldier of the Austrian army. Trades between the Jewish residents and the Jewish Police occurred at night. The Jewish people living in the ghetto were also low on winter apparel and supplies because the German Troops took them to support the invasion of Russia. In June 1941, 180 Jews were shot in the streets and 560 Jews sent to the Belzec extermination camp. In mid-July 1942, the open ghetto became a closed ghetto surrounded by a fence. It spread across 3 areas: Berka Joselewicza Street, then all the buildings north of the Market Square up to the Rynek Sienny (known today as Sobieskiego Street and Chopin Street), and finally G≈Çowackiego Street up to Trzcianka and the Kazimierz Wielki Square. Initially 3,000 Jews lived there. However, 6,000 Jews had to live in this small part of the town by summer 1942. Overpopulation became a problem when the ghetto was fenced off. The camp had about ten people per window which decreased sanitation throughout the camp. This led to an outbreak of typhoid. Typhoid was one of the major causes of death within the ghetto along with starvation. One of the doctors helping those with Typhoid fever was Maurycy Gross. Even with the outbreak of typhoid. the main source of death within the ghetto was the German forces. When a Jew was shot by someone in the Nazi party, they would force other Jews within the community to sign a document stating they died from natural causes. In addition, the Jews had to pay for any ammunition used to shoot other Jewish people within Brzesko. During the year of 1942, three Aktions took place within the Brzesko Ghetto and were conducted by the Order Police which included people such as Lapsch, Wagner, and Mikler. On 18 June 1942, 180 Jews were killed in the streets and 560 deported to the Belzec extermination camp for the third Aktion. In December 1942, fifteen Jews were brought from Zakliczyn and shot at the cemetery.  Deportation to extermination camps  On 17 September 1942 (or on the 12th), the nazis liquidate the ghetto. About 2,000 Jewish people are sent to the Belzec extermination camp, about 150 miles from Brzesko. Another 4,000 Jewish people were sent to the Auschwitz death camp that same year. In order to accomplish the deportation, all the Jews living in Brzesko were gathered in the square of the town. Throughout the process of deportation to the death camps, any citizens considered too weak to travel were shot in the town square. This could be due to illness, age, or injury. Those left behind after the deportation were sent to the ghetto of Tarn√≥w or killed. Kirkut cemetery was the site of many executions from the Brzesko Ghetto. Throughout the lifespan of the ghetto Jews within the ghetto worked to escape. Some of the Jews escaped into the nearby woods where they hid until they could escape or were caught. Other Jews tried to escape by using fake Aryan documents forged for them. Paulina Tider and her family were part of the group that got Aryan papers to escape Brzesko. Dov Landau managed to escape with his father in June 1942. Anyone who was caught outside the ghetto boundaries was caught by the Polish police guarding the ghetto and delivered to the Gestapo. During the deportation, Dr. Jan Brzeski helped some of the Jews who had escaped by keeping them healthy until they could come out of hiding. It is estimated 200 Jews from Brzesko survived. One Righteous Among the Nations, Helena Skrobotowicz, saved one child of the Brzesko Ghetto.  Jewish Council (Judenrat) of Brzesko  The Judenrat was formed to meet the demands of the Germans through forced labor. Though the council was made up of Jews who believed they were making a difference, the purpose of the served only German needs. This included taking a census of Brzesko which showed that 3,270 Jews lived in Brzesko on 31 May 1941. The division of the Jewish Council was led by Jakub Hendler who also oversaw the counties of Szczurowa and Borzecin. Additional groups within Brzesko included the Central Organization for Orphan Care (CENTOS, Centralne Towarzystwo Opieki nad Sierotami), Jewish Social Self- Help (JSS, J√ºdische Soziale Selbsthilfe), and Committee for the Aid to Refugees and the Poor.  Post war  The Jewish cemetery still contains the graves of those who died during WWII. In 1947, a monument to remember the mass grave of the 200 Jews who died in Brzesko on 18 June 1942 was built in the Jewish cemetery. A commemorative plaque is also displayed on a wall of the town library which is located on the previous site of the synagogue of Brzesko.

She had multiple aliases but is often referred to as The Lady Bushranger. In the 1920s she established herself as leader of a gang of cattle thieves in the area that is now Wollemi National Park. Forgotten for several decades after her death, she has been the subject of two recent books: The Untold by Courtney Collins (2012), and Out of the Mists: The Hidden History of Elizabeth Jessie Hickman (2014). Early life Jessie Hickman was born in either Burraga or Carcoar, New South Wales. At the age of eight she was sent to live with a travelling circus, attaining a reputation as a skilled roughrider - she was named Australian Ladies Roughriding Champion in 1905 and 1906. Career Hickman eventually became the ringmistress of Martini's Buckjumping Show, and may have been married to its one-time owner Martin Breheny (known as James Martini). In 1913 she had a son with Benjamin Hickman; the two married in 1920 and separated in 1924. She is rumored to have been married to an abusive third man, John Fitzgerald (known as \\"Fitzy\\"), whom she is alleged to have killed in self-defense. Jessie Hickman was jailed twice in the 1910s for thefts. In the 1920s she established herself as leader of a gang of cattle thieves in the area that is now Wollemi National Park. She was charged with cattle rustling in 1918 and 1928, but was acquitted on both occasions. Her legendary exploits included \\"escap[ing] from custody while in a locked toilet aboard a moving train\\" and \\"steal[ing] cattle in a police holding yard\\". Death and legacy Hickman died of a brain tumour in 1936 and was interred in an unmarked grave in Sandgate Cemetery. Although she was largely forgotten for several decades, she has recently been the subject of several books, including The Burial by Courtney Collins and Out of the Mists: The Hidden History of Elizabeth Jessie Hickman by Hickman's granddaughter Di Moore.

She is mostly remembered for her adaptations of traditional Slavic and Northern fairy tales.Giannalberto Bendazzi (2016).

Encyclopedia of Domestic Animation, pp. 14‚Äì15, 21, 691‚Äì692 Biography Olga Khodataeva was born in the Konstantinovskaya stanitsa (modern-day Konstantinovsk, Rostov Oblast of Russia), one of the three children of a tsarist official Peter Petrovich Khodataev. Her father was an illegitimate son of Agafia Kondratievna Khodataeva and a merchant from the Vladimir Governorate who seduced and left Agafia shortly after. Peter studied in the Rostov-on-Don realschule and married a local midwife Anna. He made a successful career and in 1898 moved his family to Moscow.The Stars of Russian Animation. Film 2. Nikolai Khodataev by Irina Margolina and Eduard Nazarov, 2010 (in Russian) Both Olga and her elder brother Nikolai Khodataev became interested in painting early in their lives. They both entered the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture to study fine art and graduated in 1918. During the next six years Olga had worked as a graphic arts and a scenic designer. In 1924 her brother along with the fellow artists Yuri Merkulov and Zenon Komissarenko organized an experimental workshop under the State School of Cinematography, the first Soviet animation studio where they produced a cutout short Interplanetary Revoluion. Soon they were hired by the Soviet government to create an animated feature film China in Flames to support the Chinese national liberation movement. Because of the complexity of the work they invited a number of other young artists, including Olga. With 1000 meters of film and 14 frames per second the cartoon ran over 50 minutes at the time, which made it one of the world's first animated features. For the next ten years she worked with her brother and the Brumberg sisters as a co- director, animator, art director and screenwriter. Their most famous works include One of Many (1927) that mixed live action and traditional animation in a story about the misadventures of a Komsomol girl in Hollywood; The Samoyed Boy (1928) stylized as traditional Nenets art and described by Khodataev as \\"the first steps in conquering the tradegy genre\\"; and The Little Organ (1933), an adaptation of The History of a Town that manifested \\"a plasticity of animation movement and the filmmaker's ability to nudge animation towards real art\\".Sergei Asenin (2012). The World of Animation // The Tropes of Soviet Animation. ‚Äî Moscow: Print-on-Demand, p. 44 Both Khodataevs also created experimental animation for the Natalya Sats Musical Theater during the 1920s.Olga Khodataeva at the Encyclopedia of National Cinema (in Russian) Their ways parted in 1936 when Soyuzmultfilm was established in order to produce Disney-style shorts. Olga joined the collective, while Nikolai left the industry in disappointment, feeling that it wasn't up to bold experiments.Nikolai Khodataev on why he left animation letter published at the Notes by Film Historian magazine, 2001 (in Russian) Kino-Circus (1942) From then on Khodataeva directed and co-directed around 30 animated films mostly based on traditional Slavic fairy tales and folklore of the Indigenous small- numbered peoples of the North, Siberia and the Far East. With the start of the Great Patriotic War many animators left for the frontline or were evacuated from Moscow. Among those few left in the sieged city were Olga Khodataeva and Leonid Amalrik who produced several anti-Hitler sketches that were released under the Kino-Circus name in 1942 to a great acclaim. Among her other successful works was Sarmiko (1952) about the adventures of a Chukchi boy which was named the Best Animated Film at the VII Karlovy Vary International Film Festival; Sister Alenushka and Brother Ivanushka (1953) adapted from one of the most popular Russian fairy tales; and The Flame of the Arctic (1956) which received the first prize at the VIII Kids and Teens International Film Festival in Venice and a golden medal at the 6th World Festival of Youth and Students in Moscow. In 1960 Olga Khodataeva co-directed her last film Golden Feather with Leonid Aristov. She died eight years later in Moscow aged 74.

The distribution is made for Chrome hardware including Chromebook, Chromebox, Chromebit and Chromebase. GalliumOS beta1 was released on 10 November 2015. Features Gallium is based on Xubuntu and maintains compatibility with the Ubuntu repositories. Multiple sources indicate that Galliums' boot time is faster than Linux distributions made for Chrome OS. It is optimized to limit stalls and has integrated touchpad drivers. Gallium is compatible with some Chrome devices. It is necessary to prepare the device in different ways based on the hardware chipset. Prerequisites Typically, a Chromebook on which GalliumOS is to be installed requires modification of the device itself, typically in a way which voids the warranty. The most common reason for this is to uninstall a screw which, when installed, prevents the installation of new firmware. The reason this must be done is that modern chromebooks lack the necessary firmware required to boot from an external device, making the installation of GalliumOS impossible. The firmware is typically installed through a custom script written by MrChrombox.

The station was last owned by Mediatrix SC, Inc., and operated from November 11, 1964, to April 29, 2006. History =WIDD: Early years= WIDD signed on November 11, 1964. The station was originally owned by the Holston Broadcasting Corporation, broadcasting on 1520 with 1,000 watts daytime and 500 watts in critical hours. The station was acquired in 1973 from its original ownership by Landcare, Inc. principals J. H. Lewis and Edward H. Davis, along with WLSN-FM 99.3 (changed to WIDD-FM in 1975), though Lewis had owned part of Holston since the station signed on the air. Landcare, whose other holdings included car washes, a beverage distributor and a hotel in Illinois, was forced into involuntary bankruptcy by its creditors in 1975, and a federal bankruptcy judge ordered in March 1976 that the stations be sold. Metro Broadcasting Corporation bought WIDD-AM-FM that October for $250,000. WIDD AM had been programming country music prior to the sale to Metro and remained in the format while WIDD-FM played gospel music and religious programming. One of its songs, however, would cause a legal furor. A local artist wrote \\"The Ballad of Jarvis Stout\\", about the drunk driving arrest of a local constable; alleging the invasion of his privacy, the fact that WIDD aired the song as its \\"Pick Hit of the Week\\" (whereas WBEJ refused to air it), and the fact that the publicity around the case prompted a mistrial, he sued WIDD and others involved in the creation of the song for $300,000. =Southern Signal years, bankruptcy and FDIC operation= WIDD-AM-FM was sold in 1981 to attorney H. Curtis Williams and Gene Artrip, doing business as Southern Signal Corporation, for $400,000. The new owners flipped WIDD-FM to album-oriented rock and moved its former religious programming to the AM station. The change did not last, and within a year, WIDD was back to country music, though this time it played a blend of 1950s and 1960s oldies music and current country artists, calling itself \\"Country Rockin' WIDD-AM15\\". That format did not last, and by 1983 the station had flipped to adult standards. Southern Signal's financial condition began to deteriorate after two years on the air, largely because the station was indebted when the company acquired the stations. Late in 1983, WIDD-FM was sold off to the owner of WJSO. On March 1, 1984, the Watauga Valley Bank seized the station after defaulting on a $225,000 loan. Other creditors included United Press International, Broadcast Music, Inc., and United Telephone. The bank, however, was in its own dire straits. On April 6, the Tennessee banking commissioner shut down the financial institution, with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation taking control of Watauga Valley's assets. This put the FDIC in the highly unusual position of running a radio station, though a thunderstorm in late May or early June destroyed the WIDD transmitter and plunged the station into a silence that would last nearly two years. The owner of the Elizabethton Star newspaper attempted to buy the station but was told by the Federal Communications Commission that he could not own both the newspaper and WIDD. =Return to air and change to WITM= Michael B. Glinter acquired the station at the end of 1985 and returned WIDD to air in March 1986. Among the air staff of the relaunched station was Lee Brown, who had previously been at WIDD from 1964 to 1981 and had worked at WBEJ before then. On August 22, 1986, at 12:40 p.m., Brown was on the air when he suffered a heart attack and died in the studio at the age of 61. Glinter resold WIDD in 1987 to Dale Miller and Gary Ward for $165,000. The new ownership flipped the station from gospel music to easy listening and changed the call letters to WITM (\\"In Tennessee's Mountains\\") on April 26, 1988; the new call letters and music format coincided with James Chambers, a Navy veteran who had lost his eyesight while serving, taking over as general manager. WITM changed formats again, this time to Christian programming and southern gospel music, in 1991; the programming was simulcast from WBCV in Bristol, Virginia. =WKPP= By 1993, however, WITM had gone silent again. That July, the Holston Valley Broadcasting Corporation‚Äîowners of WKPT, WTFM, and WKPT-TV in Kingsport as well as WKTP in Jonesborough‚Äîfiled to buy the inactive station from Good Shepherd Broadcasting‚Äîowned by interests that had bought out Miller and Ward over the late 80s‚Äîfor $11,200, claiming that WITM's poor financial status made it a failed station which they could own. The FCC approved the sale in June 1995 over objections by WBEJ that the acquisition would give Holston Valley too many outlets. The station became WKPP in 1995, run in a cooperative venture where Holston Valley supplied WKPT Radio Network programming, while WBEJ sold the station's advertising and handled operations. The station originally had an adult contemporary \\"mature music\\" format, though by 1998 it had changed to all-news. =WHHQ= In 1999, the St. Thomas More Broadcasting Association acquired WKPP for $65,000; the call letters officially changed to WHHQ on December 8, 1998. The change coincided with the station beginning to broadcast Catholic programming as Queen of Peace Catholic Radio; the licensee name changed to Mediatrix SC, Inc., in 2004.FCC: BAL-20040315AEM Assignment of License ‚Äî WHHQ Citing a dispute with a party that held a time brokerage agreement with Mediatrix, the licensee received special temporary authority to take WHHQ silent, as of April 29, 2006.

It is found in North America, where the larvae tunnel in the stems of wild and cultivated sunflower plants. Description The adult sunflower stem weevil is about long and a grayish- brown color with irregular whitish markings. The larva is creamy white with a brown head. Ecology The adults emerge from their over-wintering chamber in old sunflower stumps in May or June and feeds on sunflower leaves, doing no significant damage. When ready to breed, the female chews a hole in the base of a sunflower stem and inserts a single egg, protecting it with frass. The larva feeds inside the stem and when fully developed descends to the base of the plant and hollows out a chamber in the woody tissue. It is this excavation that weakens the stem. The main parasitoid of the larva of the sunflower stem weevil is Nealiolus curculionis, a braconid wasp. The female of this wasp lays an egg inside the first instar larva of the sunflower stem weevil, and when that larva enters diapause in the fall, in a chamber near the base of the plant, the wasp larva also goes into hibernation. Both larvae resume activity in the spring, and about twenty days later, the wasp larva exits the weevil larva, feeds on its carcase and pupates. The adult wasp emerges about ten days later, both insects having a single generation each year. Damage The sunflower is an important oil-producing crop in North America, and is also native to the continent. By excavating through the woody tissues, the larvae of the sunflower stem weevil makes the crop more susceptible to lodging in strong winds before the crop is harvested. Where this weevil is present in association with the pathogenic fungus Macrophomina phaseolina, the stems may develop black streaking and the crop may be affected by a Fusarium solani collar rot.

The common name comes from the place that it was described ‚Äì Pennsylvania ‚Äì and the shape of its web ‚Äì a funnel-shape web. Its closest relative is Agelenopsis potteri. The Pennsylvania funnel-web spider lives primarily as a solitary spider across the United States; this species has been found in at least 21 different states. In this species, the female commonly cannibalizes the male (pre-copulatory cannibalism: see sexual cannibalism). This small species has been used to study pre-copulatory cannibalism, boldness and aggressive foraging behavior, and the influence of microbes in the reproductive cycle and mating behavior. The bodies of females are 9 to 14 mm long, while those of males are 7 to 12 mm long. In this species, the funnel- shaped web is where individuals sit and wait for their prey. Description The adult female Pennsylvania funnel-web spider has an overall length from 9.35 to 14.00 mm. Its carapace width is around 2.38 to 4.88 mm by 1.32 to 2.65 mm at its widest and narrowest points, respectively. The adult male has an overall length of 7.64-12.82 mm, while its carapace is 2.55 to 4.50 mm wide at its widest point and 1.54 to 2.25 mm at its narrowest point. The male of this species distinguishes itself from other males of the genus by its coiling embolus. The male's embolus makes a full circle with a pointed tip positioned perpendicular to cymbium; the cymbium is a feature of the palpal bulb characteristic of the male's pedipalp. Female spiders of this species have a skull-shape bursa opening with spermathecae tending to nestle one above the other rather than positioned side by side; this whole structure is part of the female's genital region. Distribution and habitat thumb thumb =Distribution= The Pennsylvania funnel-web spider is widespread across the United States, in the states of Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, and West Virginia. However, it has been reported to be most common from New England and Great Lakes states, westward into Nebraska and eastern Colorado, south to Arkansas, Mississippi, and northern Georgia, with disjunct populations in Washington and Oregon. =Habitat= This species is usually found in open grassy habitats. It is believed that this species‚Äô range is correlated with areas of high-water availability. In this type of ecosystem (floodplains forest and habitat near to bodies of water), spiders of this species are more common, indicating that humidity is important for its distribution. Diet and feeding behavior =Diet= Adult Agelenopsis pennsylvanica feeds on a variety of insects, particularly, hemipterans (true bugs), homopterans (Homoptera a suborder of Hemiptera), coleopterans (beetles), hymenopterans (bees, ants, wasps and sawflies), dipterans (true flies), and orthopterans (grasshoppers, locusts and crickets). =Feeding behavior= When the spider is on its web, it sits and waits at the entrance of their funnel, using high-velocity movements to subdue prey that make contact with their webs. After the prey fall into the web, the spider runs out to capture the prey. Web = Web type = All members of the Agelenopsis genus have a web that ‚Äì as their common name states ‚Äì consists of a funnel-shaped commonly. The web of this spider is usually found on the ground, in understory vegetation and trees in the forest, old field lawns, in some seasons is very common in and around houses = Prey capture techniques = These funnel-webs are composed of two parts: 1) a non-sticky sensory sheet used to sense the prey; and 2) a funnel retreat, in which they sit and wait at the entrance of their funnel for prey to fall into the trap. = Construction = The funnel web of this spider is a concave silk sheet with a variable number of aerial threads above, designed to capture flying insects and anchor the web to surrounding vegetation. This kind of web usually has two ends: on one edge, the is an extended funnel which terminates in a sheltered location, while at the other end of the web the spider is located with the first two pairs of legs resting in the nest. This enables the spider to quickly react to a potential predator or prey. Reproduction and life cycle A recent study in this funnel-web spider has shown that this species develops personality traits. By testing boldness and foraging aggression in juvenile stages of development, the authors found that boldness and aggression behaviors are correlated with the penultimate instar stage of juvenile development in wild A. pennsylvanica spiders, but there is no correlation when the juveniles are reared in the laboratory. In this study, the authors also found that the boldness and foraging aggressiveness behaviors of the juvenile spider that were field-caught are a phenotypic plasticity response, which is drive by the environmental conditions where these juveniles live that do not exist under laboratory conditions. Sweeney and colleagues found two main results in this study: 1) the boldness and foraging aggressiveness behavior only occur under particular environmental conditions: and 2) this behavior is not correlated with selection. =Mating= The male Agelenopsis pennsylvanica moves around to find a mating opportunity while the female stays in her web. Males are usually attracted to webs of females that have engaged in cannibalistic behavior; cannibalism increased the male visitation rates to females‚Äô webs. = Sexual cannibalism = The female's receptivity to male mates depends upon her temperament. More aggressive females are more likely to cannibalize a potential mate. The male uses his pedipalps to transfer the sperm to the females. Also, the male uses his pedipals during the courtship stridulation or as a visual signal for other spiders. After the courtship happens, catalepsis occurs, which is a key part of the mating sequence for members of the genus Agelenopsis, where the male subdues the female with pheromones to induce a quiescent state in the female before copulation. When the mating process is finished, the male departs the web before the female awaked to avoid sexual cannibalism. The female of this species is commonly known not only for its pre-copulatory cannibalism but for its sexual cannibalism too. Sexual cannibalism is known as one of the most extreme cases of sexual conflict in nature because one of the parties loses its reproductive potential. It has been found that the females and her offspring of this species benefit when a cannibalistic behavior takes place during copulation. Particularly, the eggs produced by females that sexually cannibalize the male are heavier and have a higher hatching success than those eggs laid by females that did not cannibalize their mate. Berning and colleagues found in a study done in 2012 that females of this species that attacked their prey more rapidly are more likely to cannibalize their first male precopula. This was found to be especially true of those females that spent long periods of time with no food. The results of this study suggest that sexual cannibalism in the females of this species is caused by general aggressiveness and by their hunger state. Aggressive behavior thus favors the reproductive performance of the females. In a study done by Pruitt and colleagues in 2014, the authors found that females were approached by zero to three males during their two to three weeks of the reproductive season. In this spider species cannibalism has two major advantages for the female: 1) improved reproductive output and fecundity; and 2) increased attractiveness to males.  Enemies  = Predators = This species has been found in other spiders‚Äô webs such as Parasteatoda tepidariorum (the Common house spider) and Phidippus audax (the Bold jumper).  Mutualism with microbes  Environmental microbes have been found to play a critical role in courtship behavior, female survival, and mating dynamics of the Pennsylvania funnel-web spider. During copulation, it is possible for the male to transmit environmental microbes to the female via the seminal fluid. Therefore, copulation can alter the composition of the female microbiota. In a study by Spicer and colleagues in 2019, the authors found that when either the male or female of the Pennsylvania funnel-web spider is exposed to environmental microbes, their mating behavior, fecundity, and survivorship are altered. This study observed that when females were exposed to bacteria, males took four times longer to begin courtship and males began courtship sooner with aggressive females once they were paired with them. When males were exposed to bacteria, their mating females were observed to experience reduced survival. Additionally, courtship was not altered in those males and females that were exposed to antibiotics. The authors suggest two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses to explain the delay in courtship behavior when females are exposed to bacteria: 1) males may detect the bacterial load of their partner and adjust their behavior, or 2) females may reduce their sexual receptivity when they perceive an increase in their bacterial load, delaying courtship initiation by males. However, it is thought that males are more likely to initiate the courtship process based on assessments of female receptivity. In the particular case in which the males initiate courtship more quickly when the females are more aggressive and have been exposed to bacteria, the authors suggest that males minimized the time that they were exposed to the female to avoid a possible cannibalistic event, and therefore survived to reproduce once again.

For several decades, Costa Rica was ignored by the Spanish crown due to its distance from the regional capital of the Captaincy General of Guatemala located in Santiago de Guatemala and from the seat of the Viceroy of New Spain located in Mexico City. The colony of Costa Rica developed into a poor peasant society with no large land-owning families or large native population, most of which had been massacred during Spanish colonization. Many of the settlers in the territory subsided on cacao and tobacco farming. In 1808, coffee was introduced to Costa Rica from Cuba and became the principal crop of the country. =Independence= In 1808, Joseph Bonaparte was installed as King of Spain and several Spanish American colonies began to declare their independence from Spain. As Costa Rica and most Central American nations were governed by Mexico City; New Spain declared its independence from Spain in 1810. In 1821, the Plan of Iguala declared Mexico as a constitutional monarchy. Costa Rica declared its own independence from Spain in 15 September 1821 after a monarchical coup chose to join the Mexican Empire under Emperor Agust√≠n de Iturbide prompting the first civil war, the Ochomogo War. In March 1823, Iturbide resigned as Emperor and Mexico became a republic. Costa Rica decided to separate from Mexico on 1 July 1823. Costa Rica, along with El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua formed the Federal Republic of Central America. In 1839 the Central American Federation dissolved and Costa Rica became an independent nation. =Post-Independence= Costa Rican President Rafael √Ångel Calder√≥n Fournier and Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonz√°lez during a press conference in Madrid, January 1993. On 10 May 1850, Costa Rica and Spain established diplomatic relations with the signing of a Treaty of Recognition, Peace and Friendship.Bilateral relations between Spain and Costa Rica (in Spanish) Since independence, many Spanish migrants immigrated to Costa Rica seeking better opportunities in the nation. During the Spanish Civil War, Costa Rica officially remained neutral during the conflict and did not support either side in the conflict. As a result, few Spaniards immigrated to Costa Rica as refugees. At the end of the war, Costa Rica officially recognized the government of General Francisco Franco in April 1939.Neutralidad con matices (in Spanish) In September 1977, King Juan Carlos I of Spain paid an official visit to Costa Rica.Visita de los Reyes a Centroam√©rica (in Spanish) The King returned to Costa Rica in April 1991 and again in November 2004 to attend the XIV Ibero-American Summit.

Mohr (July 11, 1894September 10, 1968) was a German zoologist who made contributions to ichthyology and mammalogy. Mohr was long associated with the Zoological Museum Hamburg, where she was successively head of the Fish Biology Department, Department of Higher Vertebrates, and Curator of the Vertebrate Department. She was a member of the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina and held an honorary doctorate from the University of Munich. Mohr was born in Hamburg, the daughter of a school teacher, and aside from some time in Schleswig- Holstein lived for most of her life in Hamburg. Between 1914 and 1934 she taught high school while volunteering at the Zoological Museum Hamburg and also published scholarly and popular scientific articles. At the Zoological Museum she began working with Ernst Ehrenbaum on age determination in fishes, where she is credited to have been the first to use ctenoid scales to estimate age. She later worked with Georg Duncker on fish taxonomy, including works on the viviparous halfbeaks (Zenarchopteridae), sand lances (Ammodytidae) and shrimpfish (Centriscidae). After Duncker's retirement in 1934, Mohr became head of the Fish Biology department, and in 1936 became head of the Department of Higher Vertebrates. She became Curator of the Vertebrate Department in 1946. She also worked extensively with mammals, publishing on rodents, seals, hoofed-mammals, and other groups. She became a member of the American Society of Mammalogists in 1928, and in 1959 she wrote a monograph on the endangered Przewalski's horse, a \\"pre-emininet compendium... that can never be surpassed for its firsthand accounts of the early history of the species\\". She compiled studbooks for the Przewalski's horse and European bison, and was active in reintroduction efforts for the latter. Mohr produced over 400 publications during her career. She received an honorary doctorate from the University of Munich in 1950. In 1966 she was elected an Honorary Member of the American Society of Mammalogists, the Society's most esteemed honor, and as of 1996 was the only woman to have been so rewarded. Mohr died in Hamburg in 1968. She was buried in the Ohlsdorf Cemetery's Garden of Women, with a statue of a hutia (a large rodent) marking her grave. A hutia statue stands beside Mohr's grave in Ohlsdorf Cemetery.  Legacy A species of fossil salamander (Grippiella mohrae) and bat mite (Ichoronyssus mohrae) were named after Mohr. In 1984, on what would have been her 90th birthday, a street in Neuallerm√∂he, Hamburg, was named Erna Mohr Kehre (\\"Erna Mohr Turn\\").

Built at an unknown date between 1792 and 1809, it was located approximately five miles from the main mission, inland and upstream along the Ventura River. The site was buried in 1968 by the construction of California State Route 33. Prior to the freeway's construction, archaeologists excavated and studied the site. A number of foundation stones were moved and used to create the Santa Gertrudis Asistencia Monument which was designated in 1970 as Ventura County Historic Landmark No. 11. History The Santa Gertrudis Asistencia was established as an asistencia or \\"sub-mission\\" of the Mission San Buenaventura, ministering to the Chumash people in the Ventura River valley where substantial agricultural activities were conducted. The precise date of its creation is not known, though historians place its establishment during the time when the second church was being built at the main Mission, somewhere between 1792 and 1809.Greenwood and Browne, pp. 3 and 41. The asistencia was named after Gertrude the Great, a 13th century German Benedictine, mystic, and theologian who was canonized in 1677. The asistencia was built along the route of El Camino Real, a historical trail that linked California's Spanish missions. The Camino Real turned north at the Mission San Buenaventura following the course of the Ventura River.Greenwood and Browne, p. 6. The Santa Gertrudis site was located 5.1 miles north of the mouth of the Ventura River and 220 feet from the river's east bank.Greenwood and Browne, p. 7. According to one account, it was situated near a sycamore tree used in rituals by the Chumash people. Sol N. Sheridan in 1926 described the site as follows: > The spot had always been a sacred one to the Indians.

During four periods of crisis at the Mission San Buenaventura, the Mission padres, according to some accounts, temporarily relocated to the Santa Gertrudis Asistencia. The first possible relocation to Santa Gertrudis, and the one having the least historical support, followed a fire in the 1790s that destroyed the first Mission church. According to two accounts by Charles Hillinger published in the Los Angeles Times, \\"a temporary mission  the little Mission Santa Gertrudis  was erected and used for religious services until 1809 when the second church at Ventura was finally completed.\\" The second relocation followed the 1812 San Juan Capistrano earthquake when the padres moved inland and remained for several months until the Mission was repaired. During this time, adobe buildings and huts were built. However, one Mission historian has argued that a February 1813 letter indicates that the 1812 relocation was not to Santa Gertrudis but to a site closer to the main Mission.Greenwood and Browne, p. 4. The third relocation was in December 1818 due to the threat of invasion by Hippolyte Bouchard and his two ships of Peruvian pirates. The padres relocated inland with the Mission's livestock and valuable items. Although the historical record is unclear as to whether Santa Gertrudis was the site of refuge, historian E. M. Sheridan wrote as follows in an unpublished account: \\"Miguel was put in charge of the advance guard of Indians to head northward and make arrangements for the reception at Casitas, at the Chapel of Santa Gertrudis which was considered far enough back as to become an abiding place until Bouchard and the expected pirates should have come and gone.\\"(quoted by Greenwood and Browne, p. 4) The fourth relocation followed the 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake. Two historical accounts indicate that the 1857 relocation was to Santa Gertrudis. In the mid-1880s, the remains of the asistencia were plowed under when owner Salmon R. Weldon put the land under cultivation. Archaeological excavation Excavation of the Santa Gertrudis site by Greenwood and Browne, 1966 In the 1960s, the State of California planned to build California State Route 33 over the area believed to be the site of the Santa Gertrudis Asistencia. Prior construction of the freeway, the California Department of Highways entered into an inter-agency agreement with the California Department of Parks and Recreation to conduct an emergency archaeological salvage project.Greenwood and Browne, p. 2. Archaeologist Roberta S. Greenwood and R. O. Browne led the excavation with field work being conducted between March 8 and April 29, 1966. Greenwood and Browne had previously conducted test excavations in November 1964 without success.Greenwood and Browne, p. 9. During the 1966 excavation, the location of the asistencia was determined through the use of an 1853 map of Rancho Ca√±ada Larga o Verde discovered at the Bancroft Library in Berkeley, California. The excavation revealed the foundation of a structure measuring 15.5 meters by 11.25 meters, parallel to and facing the Camino Real. The foundation was built using large sandstone boulders believed to have been carried from the nearby Ventura River and placed in trenches. The structure had four rooms arranged in a U-shaped plan around a sheltered courtyard or patio.Greenwood and Browne, p. 13. Based on its size, its relation to the other rooms, and the presence of what appeared to be the main entrance, Greenwood and Browne concluded that Room 4, the largest in the structure, was used for worship.Greenwood and Browne, p. 15. Although no remnants of walls were discovered, an adobe brick was found on the site, and Greenwood and Browne concluded that the walls were built with locally-fabricated adobe bricks.Greenwood and Browne, p. 17. Greenwood and Browne found no intact roof tiles and hypothesized that Emigdio Ortega may have salvaged the tiles for the 1857 construction of the Ortega Adobe. Ortega had reportedly purchased roof tiles from the Mission padres after the 1857 earthquake. Comparison of 57 roof tile fragments from Santa Gertrudis with tiles at the Ortega Adobe showed them to be \\"identical in Munsell color, temper, and average size.\\"Greenwood and Browne, pp. 18 and 20. Greenwood and Browne further observed that the removal of the roof tiles was consistent with historical accounts of rapid and total disintegration of the adobe in the years that followed. Greenwood and Browne also hypothesized, based on an examination of floor-tile fragments from the chapel, that 35 tiles at the Rocky Mountain Drilling Company, located 275 meters northwest of the chapel, may have been salvaged from the chapel.Greenwood and Browne, pp. 20-21. Remains of two ovens or kilns located behind the structure were also discovered. Following the findings of the archaeological survey, many individuals and groups advocated for the relocation and restoration of the chapel, but no plan was adopted prior to the freeway's construction. Accordingly, in January 1968, the remains of the chapel were removed from the path of the freeway and buried in a pit located 160 meters to the southeast of the building's original location. Santa Gertrudis Asistencia Monument Memorial with trees burned, April 2018 In 1968, a number of the chapel's foundation stones were relocated to create the Santa Gertrudis Asistencia Monument. It is located approximately 500 feet south of the chapel's original location, on the east side of North Ventura Avenue three-tenths of a mile north of the Ventura Avenue Water Purification Plant (5895 N. Ventura Avenue). The monument was designated as Ventura County Historic Landmark No. 11 in December 1970. During the December 2017 Thomas Fire, trees adjacent to the monument were burned. The monument itself is made of stone and was unharmed.

It is a rare species, with a restricted range and narrow suitable habitat. Because of these reasons it is considered to be \\"Vulnerable\\" (G3) by NatureServe. However, estimating population size is difficult due to its habitat on sheer cliffs, which are dangerous for researchers to access. It is possible that in hard-to-reach areas, populations may be reasonably large. Elymus svensonii is a perennial grass. It is similar to Elymus hystrix, with which it sometimes hybridizes. It can be distinguished from Elymus hystrix by its curving lemma awns, generally larger glumes, and nodding spikes.
