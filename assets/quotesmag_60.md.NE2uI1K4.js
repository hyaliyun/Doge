Its products are used in studio and on location film sets along with in photography and live production. History Parent company to Aputure, Emgreat Group was set up by high school peers Ian Xie and Polo Zheng. As amateur filmmakers, the duo used their hobbyist knowledge to keep up with trends and eventually grow the company to be one of the largest electronics dealers on Amazon. =Origins= With the growth of Emgreat‚Äôs online business, Xie started by creating small camera accessories like monitors and adapters before moving on to light- emitting diodes also known as LED. Within three years, he was contracted by several large cinema manufacturers to begin producing his light fixtures under their in-house brands, many of which became the first-ever companies to introduce LED lighting to studios and production houses. In 2008, Aputure was founded. Its name was a play on combining the cinematography term \\"aperture\\" with \\"future.\\" =First lighting fixtures= Originally, Aputure continued to create light fixtures for other brands. However, it wasn‚Äôt long before the design and manufacturing company began developing a product of their own to bring to the market. The early team joined color scientists from Fujifilm with cinematographers from Los Angeles. Together, they engaged in product development of high-fidelity LEDs instead of low color renditioning diodes which were common at the time. The result was Aputure‚Äôs first lighting product, the Amaran series of LED panels.\\"Aputure Amaran Halo AHL-H100 Ring Light\\" ATP.

LED panel lights were the original most common form factor for LED light fixtures, due to the limitations of the LED technology. Now LED panel lights are commonplace for their ability to be used as an area light. In designing several of its LED panels, Aputure made efforts to reduce the ‚Äúmulti-shadow effect‚Äù caused by having vertical or horizontal rows of LEDs, which without any modification could create several obvious shadows after casting light on a subject. This effect was minimized in two ways, the first being with included diffusion filters, which blended the sources together, as well as using more ‚Äúorganic‚Äù LED layouts like in the LS1c and Tri-8 lights, which scattered the LEDs to make any shadow variation look more natural.\\"APUTURE'S TRI8 LED PANEL ON TEST\\" RedShark News.

Retrieved 2020-05-27. The first prototype of a Nova product, the Nova P300c RGBWW LED Softlight Panel, was shown at NAB in 2017, showing Aputure‚Äôs plans to compete against other leading lighting manufacturers, with high-quality RGB lights at an affordable price point. =Lighting modifiers= Aputure has always been focused on providing versatility with its line of lighting products, to give users flexibility when it comes to creating different qualities of light, by creating innovative both hard and soft-light modifiers for its products. =Bowens mount= As one of the first LED lighting manufacturers to embrace the Bowens mount for modular lighting, Aputure helped to pave the way for modular point-source lighting with LEDs in the film, video, and photo industries. Previously LEDs were only used as panels with wide beam angles that were not as easy to shape or control. Traditionally, tungsten and HMI lights are also point-source lights that are easy to shape with a variety of modifiers, such as barn doors, ellipsoidal spotlights, and softboxes. By utilizing COB LED technology and combining it with the concept of Bowens mount photography strobes, Aputure was able to create a system that finally allowed for easy modularity and gave users of all skill levels the ability to shape hard light into any quality of light needed. =Soft light modifiers= Light Dome & Light Dome Mini Aputure‚Äôs two most popular Bowen‚Äôs mount accessories are its line of Bowens Mount parabolic softboxes, including the Light Dome and Light Dome Mini. Both of these prolific softboxes were eventually succeeded by the Light Dome II and Light Dome Mini II in 2018, featuring an easier setup process resulting in faster setup times, and a revolutionary gel holder accessory that allowed users to easily use gels with their softboxes. Aputure‚Äôs introduction of the Light Dome parabolic softbox to the video industry significantly changed how videos were lit both in the professional film industry and in the online video space, particularly on YouTube. Space Light Aputure debuted the Space Light attachment at NAB in 2017. Like with traditional tungsten space lights, this attachment was created to take advantage of the wide beam angle of COB lights, and use that to fill a soft volumetric space light for use in studios. The Aputure Space Light could also be used quickly on location due to its lightweight collapsible design, which allowed it to quickly attach to lights in seconds. Lantern While it didn‚Äôt replace the Space Light, in 2019, Aputure released the Lantern modifier, a 26-inch China Ball-like spherical softbox modifier that also acted as a large volumetric fill light.\\"NAB 2019: Aputure‚Äôs New Gear\\" Premium Beat. Retrieved 2020-05-26.\\"Hands-On with the Aputure Bowens Mount Lantern\\" News Shooter. Retrieved 2020-05-26. The spherical softbox design allows the lantern to be used similarly to the Space Light modifier, with the addition of a fully adjustable 360¬∞ skirt to shape the light as necessary. The firm rods of the Lantern also allow it to be used simply as a softbox that can be oriented in any direction.  3rd Party Soft Light Modifiers  On July 2020 DoPchoice and Aputure announced a joint development in a softbox mount that allows you to use any of the DoPchoice Snapback softboxes on your Aputure NOVA P300c. =Hard light modifiers= Fresnel & Fresnel 2X The first Fresnel made by Aputure was announced in 2016 at NAB, the first step in allowing you to control your COB point source as a hard light source. Then following user-submitted advice, Aputure released the Fresnel 2X in 2019,\\"Aputure Fresnel 2X for 120 and 300 COB Light Storm\\" News Shooter. Retrieved 2020-05-27. making it the first publicly available Aputure product to use a dual-lens system for optimizing light output, while minimizing light leaks. Barn Doors Aputure released its Barn Doors accessory in 2018, to work alongside its existing Fresnel and Reflector modifiers for their Bowens Mount Light Storm lights. It was made to fit a 7‚Äù diameter, a photography standard, allowing it to be used with a large combination of modifiers, including the Fresnel 2X (released in 2019). Spotlight Mount With the release of the Spotlight Mount, Aputure finally made modular, professional-quality ERS-style (ellipsoidal reflector spotlight) modifiers available for LED point source lights. Utilizing a similar dual-lens optical system to the Fresnel 2X, the Spotlight Mount is able to recreate the look of popular spotlights, such as ETC‚Äôs Source Four, complete with redesigned 19¬∞, 26¬∞, and 36¬∞ lenses to minimize color fringing. This style of modifier allows you to precisely shape light, using the built-in shutters and the ability to accept gobos. =Panel modifiers= Many of the first products Aputure released were LED panel lights. Unlike COB point source lights, panel lights are more difficult to shape, because of the initial size of their light source. Therefore, in order to add flexibility to the panels, Aputure developed and co-developed a variety of softboxes to fit their lights, such as the Aputure x Chimera LS1 Lightbank and EZ-Box+ II. Aputure x Chimera LS1 Lightbank The Lightbank for the LS1s and LS1c line of panel lights was co-developed by Aputure and Chimera, an industry-standard softbox manufacturer for cinema and photography. The LS1 Lightbank slips over the barn doors of an LS1 panel to maintain the advantage of the LS1‚Äôs compact size, while still allowing it to deliver soft, professional-quality light. Knowing the importance of controlling soft light, the Lightbank also has a light control grid modifier that can be attached to it. EZ Box Aputure released the EZ box to provide a soft light modifier for its mid-sized Amaran series of LED panel lights, such as the HR528, HR 672, and Tri-8. The EZ-Box+ II is currently the primary softbox system for these lights, allowing users to attach two brackets to the side of their light, and quickly build a compact, portable softbox. Like the Chimera Lightbank, it also has a light control grid, for additionally shaping soft light. =Software= Aputure began producing software in 2015, releasing Sidus Link, a free app for Apple iOS and Android devices. The application allows the user's device to operate as a professional wireless lighting board, with a key feature being that it allows users to not only control an unlimited number of fixtures but also save presets and capture colors in real-time using the user‚Äôs built-in camera.

Miranui (MƒÅori for Big Mill) operated from 1907 to 1933, and was the largest in the district. At its peak it had seven stripping machines and 300 employees.

Retrieved on 6 May 2018.  Transportation  Tokomaru Stream near Shannon, (1908) The Miranui flax mill was the only mill that operated a long narrow gauge tramway from the mill to the fields in the swamp. It purchased in 1907 a 5-ton steam locomotive from Bagnall and Co in England to haul the bespoke flax wagons. However, even this lightweight engine proved too heavy for the flimsy tracks across the swamps and it was sold to work later on the Piha Tramway on the West Coast near Auckland and near Raetihi in the central North Island.Catherine Knight et al: The little engine that couldn‚Äôt: the Miranui tramway. Published on 17 March 2012. Retrieved on 6 May 2018. Horse-drawn narrow gauge railways on temporary tracks for harvesting the hemp on the fields were used from 1910 onwards. As Makerua railway station was nearby, it was possible to transport the bales of flax via the North Island Main Trunk railway to seaports, from where they could be exported overseas.

Habitat  The crabs can be found from Massachusetts, U.S. to areas in Argentina.Alexandre Ribeiro da Silva; Barioto, Jo√£o Gabriel; Grabowski, Raphael Cezar; Antonio Le√£o Castilho.Biologia; Heidelberg Vol. 72, Iss. 3, (2017): 325-332. They are common in shallow water on sand in ocean beaches, but can be found in depths up to two hundred feet (60m) deep. They are typically found in temperate or tropical waters between eleven and twenty-nine degrees Celsius with a salinity between twenty-eight and thirty-five PSU. Arenaeus cribrarius often bury themselves entirely in sand, but leave a gap for water to pass to their gills. The crabs maintain the gap by clearing the sand with their claws and hairs around their mouth area. Arenaeus cribrarius is a nocturnal and solitary organism, which only interacts with other crabs of its species when it wants to breed. = Feeding = The Speckled swimming crab eats primarily detritus, but have also been recorded eating fish, mollusks, and other crustaceans. They ambush prey that go near their buried bodies. Speckled swimming crabs have been recorded capturing sea turtle hatchlings. Sea turtles are the primary predator to Arenaeus cribrarius. The crabs use their coloration and spines to ward off such predators.  Anatomy  They share a very similar overall shape with the Atlantic Blue Crab. The carapace of a Speckled swimming crab is light brown, light maroon, or olive with many white or tan irregular round spots. The males tend to be more colorful. The carapace can reach lengths between 4.5 and 6 inches wide (~120-150mm). Each side of the carapace consists of nine lateral teeth with the last extending outward. Between the eye sockets there are six partially fused frontal teeth. Arenaeus cribrarius has ten legs since it is a part of the order decapoda. The first four pairs of legs have yellow tips and are used for walking. These are referred to as broad pereopods. They fifth pair of pereopods are used for swimming. They are a wide flattened paddle shape. Overall, Arenaeus cribrarius can weigh as much as forty-five grams (1.5 oz).  Reproduction  When the Arenaeus cribrarius reaches sexual maturity around five to seven years of age they begin to mate. Arenaeus cribrarius breed year-round and are polygynandrous.Pinheiro, M., A. Fransozo. 1999. Reproductive behavior of the swimming crab Arenaeus cribrarius (Lamarck, 1818) (Crustacea, Brachyura, Portunidae) in Captivity. Bulletin of Marine Science, 64(2): 243-253. The male crab, who is between molts, will select a premolt female who is expressing courtship behavior.Andrade, Luciana S; Fransozo, Vivian; Bertini, Giovana; Negreiros-Fransozo, Maria L; L√≥pez-Greco, Laura S. The crabs communicate with one another through chemical, visual, and acoustic cues. The male then carries the female for thirty days in a precopulatory position under his body until the female molts. When the female's shell is still soft the male will invert her to position themselves with their abdomens in contact together. The male then transfers his spermatophores to her gonopores. Once mating has occurred, the eggs will spawn around fifty-seven days later and will have an fecundity between 135,000 and 680,000. Nauplia will hatch from the Speckled swimming crab eggs around eighteen days and will grow into the first stage of crab thirteen days later. The average age for a Speckled swimming crab is two years.  Commercial usage  In some parts of the world Arenaeus cribrarius is important in fisheries, particularly along the Brazilian coast. The crab is harvested for its meat and residual proteins are used to produce fertilizers and feed for livestock. Along with the consumption of meat, the Speckled swimming crab is harvested for its biproducts. Chitin can be extracted from the crab and used in products like adhesives, cosmetics, photographic emulsions, and anticoagulants.

It is found in the United States and Canada. It uses an unusual hunting technique whereby it tightens up an anchor line of the web whilst waiting for prey. This effectively winds up and compresses the web. When prey touches the web, the spider releases the held anchor line, causing the web (and the spider) to spring forwards 2-3cm at high speed. This causes up to 4 additional web strands to touch the prey, and the sudden stop when the web reaches the end of its elasticity then winds the prey further into the strands. This process has analogues to the techniques by humans used to power catapults and ballistae.

It was first published as a trade paperback by Ace Books in 1979, by the first UK edition in hardcover by Sidgwick & Jackson Ltd the following year. Further editions were published by Arrow Books, Ace Books, Del Rey/Ballantyne and others; in 2001 Baen Books issued a revised edition. The novel has also been translated into German and French. This novel and the simultaneously published novel The Fountains of Paradise, by Arthur C. Clarke, are the first popularization of the space elevator. Plot The novel tells the story of Rob Merlin, the best engineer who has ever lived. His machine, the \\"Spider,\\" extrudes graphite cables of incredible strength. Darius Regulo has a monopoly on space mining, and doesn't like rockets. Half of their fuel is used to lift the other half, a waste of energy. Regulo wants to build a space elevator, and hires Merlin to do it. Merlin will need to modify his Spider to extrude pure silicon cables, and to work in space. As work progresses, Merlin becomes convinced that his parent's accidental deaths, when he was a child, were in fact murders. He comes to this conclusion based on conversations with Regulo's people he meets in the course of the project. The questions of who, and why, become urgent as Merlin becomes certain that his life is in danger. Duplicate plot This novel was published almost simultaneously with The Fountains of Paradise by Arthur C. Clarke. Through an amazing coincidence the two novels contained many similarities. Both protagonists are engineers who have built the world's longest bridge using a machine named the \\"Spider\\", both of whom are hired to build a space elevator, and both engineers modify their Spiders to produce a crystalline fiber. When Baen Books reprinted this novel in 2001, they included an open letter that Clarke wrote in 1979 when the novel was first published. Clarke reassured the world that this similarity was, \\"A clear case of plagiarism?

It is found in the coasts of the North American Atlantic seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico.  Phylogenetics  Gammarus Mucronatus is part of the Arthropod phylum: it has an external skeleton - or cuticle - with a body made up of articulated segments-bearers of appendages which are themselves articulated, and a growth by molting. More specifically, G. mucronatus is a Malacostraca, which is the monophyletic group of the superior crustaceans. Malacostraca are subdivided in three subclasses: Phyllocarida, Hoplocarida and Eumalacostraca. Like the vast majority of the Malacostraca, G. Mucronatus belongs to the Eumalacostraca and more specifically to the Peracarida. This superorder is characterized by the presence of a marsupium (an abdominal sac sheltering the eggs) formed by the oostegites, the flat and flared parts of the proximal segments of the legs. G. mucronatus belongs to the Amphipods, an order of the Peracarida, defined by the two kinds of legs that they possess. G. Mucronatus belongs to the Gammaridae family. More specifically, the species of Gammarus Mucronatus was described for the first time in 1818 .  Etymology  Pierre-Andr√© Latreille, an important French entomologist (1762-1833), specialized in the taxonomy of arthropods. In 1816, he coined the term Amphipoda. It comes from the Greek: amphi = on either side, and pode = leg. It is an allusion to the apparent distribution of the legs in 2 groups directed, one towards the front (used to cling to the substrate and grasp the food) and the other towards the rear (ambulatory or swimming legs). This term is coined in opposition to the Isopoda, another order of the Peracarida, which only present a single type of leg. Pierre-Andr√© Latreille also coined the term Gammaridae, which describes the family of Gammarus Mucronatus.  Morphology  Gammarus Mucronatus is relatively small: organisms‚Äô size varies 3.5 and 6.5 mm. That size seems to remain stable between habitats. However, a reduction in size of ovigerous and mature females from the winter months to the summer has been observed . G. Mucronatus has no carapace and a laterally compressed body, which is a synapomorphy of the Amphipods. Gammarus Mucronatus  Habitat  Gammarus mucronatus is eurytopic, which means that it is capable of tolerating a wide range of ecological conditions. For example, it can withstand a wide range of salinity levels from 4 to 35‚Ä∞. It is generally found in endemic shallow waters and coasts of the North American Atlantic seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico. It is therefore found in very different habitat: algae, grass beds, sponges, spartina marshes, soft bottoms with shells or cobbles, oysters bar and open beaches. It is a benthic organism, which means that it lives at the bottom of the water.  Life history  Sex are differentiated between females and males. Brood development lasts a mean of 31 days. The females are multivoltine, which means they have several broods in one season. That means that there is several cohorts of Gammarus Mucronatus, which sometimes overlap. Winter and summer populations of G. Mucronatus have different reproduction strategies, with the summer population having reduced egg size, brood size, development time, size at maturity, and maximum size. The mean cohort interval is 112 days and its mean turnover rate is 4.3. Most of the mature females are ovigerous. Each female produces between 3 and 200 eggs. That production depends on the female‚Äôs size: the bigger a female is, the more eggs she will produce. There is also a variation in the egg‚Äôs size from 0.308 to 0.532 mm. The egg size varies seasonally, decreasing from winter to summer. The density of the G mucronatus population peaks in late June .  Ecology  Gammarus Mucronatus has a diversified diet: it is detritivore but also eats microalgae and macroalgae, and possibly some other macrofauna. It lacks the enzymatic activity towards structural plant polysaccharides. However, G. Mucronatus can break down the glycosidic linkages in smaller molecules. It can process starch and laminarin. In seagrass beds, G. mucronatus may have different ecological roles. It participates in the decomposition process and also engage in grazing of sea grass epiphytes. Moreover, large decapods crustaceans, juvenile and adult fish prey on G. mucronatus, like the stripped killfish, Fundulus Majalis. The activity of those predators depends on the presence or the absence of some organisms in the habitat of G. Mucronatus. The presence of macroalgua reduces the predation of G. Mucronatos by fish, which directly has a positive effect on their population‚Äô size and could create ternate stable states.

The buildings of the court and the prison are registered as historic monuments under a registration number DAY-533/87 on 15.10.1987.  History  In 1901, Emanuel Harbich, the chairman of the regional court commissioned from Cieszyn architect Eugeniusz Fulda, prepared plans for a new building. The reason was that the existing premises of the regional court at the town hall in Cieszyn were insufficient. According to the plans, the building was to be located at Garncarska street, right next to the already existing building of a prison. The construction company of Eugeniusz Fulda participated in the construction of the main body of the building and interior works as well as furnishing of offices were provided by Viennese and local companies. The official opening took place on December 2, 1905 and was associated with 57th anniversary of enthronement of the Emperor Franz Joseph I Habsburg, who possessed, inter alia, the duchy of Cieszyn. The emperor Francis visited the Court on September 2, 1906 and planted an imperial oak in front of the building to commemorate the event. The building served as the Austrian Regional Court (Kreisgericht) until it was taken over by the Polish State reborn after World War I. In the past, there was a two-headed eagle and an inscription: \\"K. K. KREISGE-RICHT\\" - \\"Imperial-royal Regional Court\\" over a window on the second floor. The building currently houses the District Court in Cieszyn. In 2005, there was a general overhaul that included reconstruction of fa√ßades and the interior. The building has served its purpose continuously since the beginning of its existence.  Architecture  The design of the building was co-created by Rudolph Lang and Czes≈Çaw Fulda. The building was built on an almost square plan, 58 per 55 metres with an interior courtyard. Its cubature is 5647 m3, the fa√ßade surface is 4467 m2, and courtyard surface is 1200 m2. The main fa√ßade has a neo-baroque decor composed of rusticated belt plinth and windows surmounted by a massive key. Windows on the first and the second floor have classic bands with keystones and are located between vertical rusticated lisens. The facade is decorated by a central three-axes projection with an entrance gate with an axe and a bunch of fasces in the key (a symbol of justice) and intermittent bridgehead with sitting putti holding a scale and a sword (other attributes of justice). The building is covered by a tin gable roof with dormer windows, and the central projection is emphasised by a high mansard roof. The lobby and a triple staircase are decorated by classicistic arcades, marble columns and balustrades. Opposite the entrance there is a statue made of a Canary marble - Iustitia, sculpted by a Viennese artist, Ernest Hegenbarth. It depicts the blindfolded goddess of justice Themis with a sword and an opened book in her hands (a symbol of a blind justice). On the right side of the lobby there is a commemorative plaque made of a Swedish granite with an inscription in German: \\"Erbaut unter der Regierung Seiner Majestat des Kaisers Franz Joseph I. 1903-1905\\" (\\"Built under the reign of His Majesty the Emperor Francis Joseph I. 1903-1905\\"). Currently the spot is occupied by a plaque from 1928 that commemorates Dr Feliks Boche≈Ñski, organiser of the Polish judiciary in Silesia and the first Polish president of the District Court in Cieszyn. In the building of the court there is a representative court hearings hall. This is a two-story (9 metres high), large (15 per 9.5 metres) room with arcade windows on one of the longer walls and blind arcades in stucco decoration on the other walls. In one of the arcades there is a portrait of the emperor Francis Joseph I in his coronation attire by Aloysius Schwinger from Gratz. The hall is roofed by a mirror vault with semicircular lunettes and decorated by high wooden panelling, portals, a court grandstand and stair benches for the audience.  The prison at the District Court in Cieszyn  The prison in Cieszyn is a closed unit located in the city centre at Boles≈Çawa Chrobrego street 2, right next to the District Court. The building was handed over in 1896 and since 1987 has been registered as an architectural monument of the Voivodeship of Silesia under the same registration number as the District Court: A-533/87 from 15.10.198[5]. It has 406 places for penal recidivists and a separate branch for the temporarily arrested remaining in the disposal of: the District Court in Cieszyn, the District Prosecutor's Office in Cieszyn, the District Court in Jastrzƒôbie Zdr√≥j, the District Prosecutor's Office in Jastrzƒôbie Zdr√≥j. Austrian authorities drew up plans for the construction of the prison in November 1858 and the construction works began in March 1881. During the interwar period, the prison of Cieszyn was given the first category. During World War II the prison was used as a punishment block and an investigation division from which prisons were sent to other prisons and concentration camps. During the German occupation, there were more than 12 thousands people imprisoned there. In smaller prison cells one could keep seven prisoners and several dozens in bigger ones. Prison cells were heated by tiled stoves opened from the side of prison corridors. Large rooms and workshops were lightened by gas lamps. On the premises of the prison there were the following facilities: a pigsty, a carpenter workshop, a basket workshop, a noodle factory, garages and two chapels, Catholic and Protestant. In the mid 50's a pulmonary diseases hospital was opened in a separate part of the prison. In the eighties the prison underwent a total overhaul that included renovation of the sewage, water and electricity systems. Each prison cell was supplied with running hot water and hospital units were equipped with separate toilets with washbasins in shared prison cells. 1992 saw separation of a part for the temporarily imprisoned. The penitentiary part had 155 rooms. The prisoners could use three common rooms and two libraries and the hospital units had their own baths. Since the renovation the prison has been heated by the urban heating network. From 2005 to 2007, the prison (the residential part for the prisoners) underwent another general overhaul. Apart from a general overhaul of prison cells a separate space for a canteen for those imprisoned was allocated. Also, the library, the radio broadcast center, and the chapel were renovated. In 2005, the Pulmonary Diseases Hospital was liquidated and consequently the prison's capacity went up, which today is 406 individuals. All prison cells have separate lockable sanitary corners, and are equipped with speakers of the radio broadcast center and household intercoms for contact with the officer in charge and terminals for television signal reception.  Trivia  In 2008 prisoners of the Penitential Unit in Cieszyn worked for the Municipal Roads Administration in Cieszyn. Free of charge intervention works were carried out by 6 - 8 prisoners, who cleaned drainage ditches and did some general cleaning. On 3 June 2009 at 10.00 P.M., a video installation was organised on the prison walls, entitled \\"On the walls of the prison of Cieszyn\\" by Jaros≈Çaw Skutnik and Adam Molenda. This event was organised within the framework of the Alternative Off -stage organised along the 20th edition of the International Theatre Festival Without Borders. In 2009, prisoners of the Penitential Unit in Cieszyn cleaned up an old Jewish cemetery in Cieszyn at Ha≈ºlaska street. Persons convicted under the so-called less supervision, in groups of 7-10 erected matzevas and cleaned the bushy ground. On 23 October 2013, a theatre performance of \\"Osadzony\\" took place in the prison. It was artistically supervised and directed by Bogus≈Çaw S≈Çupczy≈Ñski and based on the novel by Daniel Smƒôtek. The theatre project was implemented by the University of Silesia Branch in Cieszyn and the Penitentiary Unit in Cieszyn.

When her husband died she tried to act as governor in the name of her children, but was forced out of power. She fell ill and died while returning to France. Marriage Marie Bonnard was the daughter of Jean Bonnard, Bourgeois of Paris, and Fran√ßoise de Jarre. She married Chesneau de Saint- Andr√©, commis g√©n√©ral of Martinique, but this marriage was annulled by a Jesuit of the island. On 21 November 1645 the Jesuit Charles Hempteau married Jacques Dyel du Parquet, Governor of Martinique, to Marie Bonnard of Paris. Witnesses were Lefort, La Pierri√®re and Bonnard. She apparently married du Parquet secretly. During the Thoisy affair of 1646-47, when du Parquet was imprisoned by Phillippe de Longvilliers de Poincy, Lieutenant-General of the French Islands, Marie led a group in Martinique that demanded the exchange of Poincy's captured nephews (Robert de Longvilliers and Charles de Tr√©val) for her husband. After his release and return to Martinique, du Parquet publicly acknowledged the marriage. The Jesuit Jean Tehenel blessed the wedding on 30 April 1647 in Saint-Jacques chapel, Martinique, in the presence of several witnesses. Under a purchase contract of 27 September 1650 du Parquet became sole owner of the islands of Martinique, Grenada, Saint Lucia and the Grenadines, to enjoy and dispose of them as he chose, subject only to the King's charges and conditions that the company had accepted in 1642. The oldest son of Bonnard and du Parquet, named Dyel d'Esnambuc after his great- uncle, was born on 12 June 1650. Their second son, Louis Dyel du Parquet, was born on 9 February 1653. Governor of Martinique Du Parquet died in Saint- Pierre on 3 January 1658 aged 52. After his death his wife took charge of the island as regent in the name of her oldest son, Dyel d'Esnambuc. Fran√ßois Rolle de Laubi√®re, who had married du Parquet's cousin, was appointed guardian of his children. A struggle began between two factions on the island, the Parisians and the Normans. Bonnard depended on the capable Sieur de Maubray for advice. This alarmed M√©d√©ric Rolle de Goursolas, Lieutenant-General of Martinique, who spread a rumour that Maubray was her lover and wanted to seize power. The Normans named the Sieur de Plainville, a lawyer, as procureur- syndic on 22 July 1658. Maubray retired to Case-Pilote, then to Antigua. However, on the pretext that Bonnard was continuing to correspond with Maubray, Plainville arrested and imprisoned her. Several officers who supported her were dismissed and placed under house arrest. Gourselas presided over an assembly on 6 August where all these acts were confirmed, and signed the minutes with Plainville. Death After Bonnard agreed to renounce the government, she was freed and restored to her property. On 15 September 1658 the King appointed her oldest son Governor and Lieutenant General of Martinique and Saint Lucia, with his uncle Adrien Dyel de Vaudroques, to act in his place until he reached the age of 20. Vaudroques delayed leaving France for a long time. Marie became extremely weak, suffered physical pain and eventually became paralyzed. She decided to seek a cure for her illness with the waters of Bourbonne-les-Bains, and took ship with her cousin Mme de Francillon and some of her officers. However, she died during the passage, and due to the superstition of some of the passengers her body was thrown overboard. Vaudroque finally embarked from Dieppe in October 1659 and reached Martinique six weeks later. He was an ineffective governor, and died on 25 September 1662, to be succeeded by Jean Dyel de Clermont, cousin of Bonnard's children. Clermont also proved ineffective. On 14 April 1664 the King revoked all grants to the Compagnie des Isles de l'Amerique and all sales and transfers it had made to private parties, and on 28 May 1664 the Compagnie des Indes Occidentales was established by royal decree in its place. Bonnard du Parquet's heirs were forced to sell Martinique and Saint Lucia to the new company on 14 August 1665. Marie Bonnard's life was the basis for the 1948 historical novel Marie des Isles by Robert Gaillard. This in turn was the basis for the 1959 French-Italian historical adventure film Marie of the Isles directed by Georges Combret and starring Belinda Lee, Alain Saury and Dar√≠o Moreno.

History  The idea of building a theatre was put forward in spring 1902. A group of wealthy citizens of Cieszyn met at the German House to follow the initiative of a member of the city council, Franz Bartha, and set up the Theatre Construction Society (). The board of the association comprised several persons: F. Bartha (chairman), Thomas Lenoch, Leopold Widenka and Johann Struhal. A vice mayor, later mayor Rudolf Bukowski was also elected to become a member of the Department. After the association was set up, fund-raising was initiated among local wealthy Germans. 35% of the amount needed was raised, so the next steps were taken - a plot of land was chosen: a central location at the spot of the former baracks. A design was prepared by Viennese architects - Ferdinand Fellner and Hermann Helmer, who already designed 48 theatres in, inter alia, Vienna, Berlin, Toru≈Ñ and ≈Åa≈Ñcut. Construction of the theatre was carried out by the company of Eugen Fulda from Cieszyn supported by an entrepreneur based in Berlin and Vienna, Hugo Baruch, experienced in constructing theatre stages and a still operating Viennese company Pittel & Brausewetter. Construction works were finished in 1909, and the theatre was opened as Deutsches Theater [German Theatre] (the German sign was removed from the fa√ßade in October 1930). The theatre had 770 seats and standing places (currently 630 seats), a rotating stage, an iron anti-fire curtain, a boiler room and a power station, a decoration and costume depot, a ballet hall and wardrobes. The ceremonial opening took place on 24 September 1910, when a play by Franz Grillparzer, Waves of Sea and Love was produced. The performance was prepared by Oskar G√§rtner, the theatre manager. On the occasion of the opening of the theatre it was stressed that the new theatre was meant to be German and not a single word in Polish should ever be uttered on its stage. Shortly after the event this statement became completely disavowed. Ten years after the opening the role of the management of artists was carried out by the German Theatre Association (, created from the Theatre Construction Association) and the Polish Theatre Association. On 14 December 1920 the first Polish play, a comedy by Aleksander Fredro, Zemsta, was performed by the Juliusz S≈Çowacki Theatre from Krak√≥w. An equally important event was a production of the opera Halka by Stanis≈Çaw Moniuszko on 6 January 1923. The opera was performed by the Polish Theatre from Katowice. During World War II the first renovation since the opening of the theatre took place: a rotating stage and an iron curtain were installed, seats in the entire auditorium were replaced (including installation of seats on the second gallery where so far there had been only standing places). For some time the theatre housed a vocational school and a ballet school, however after three seasons actors were drafted to the army and actresses were engaged in works for the army. In 1945 the Ministry of Culture and Art created an institution called the Polish Theatre in Cieszyn, the first principal of which became Mr. Stanis≈Çaw Kwaskowski. On 18 October 1945 an opening spectacle took place to inaugurate the creation of the new institution - by Aleksander Fredro entitled: Pan Jowialski. From December 1945 to April 1961 the theatre operated as the second stage of the Polish Theater in Bielsko-Bia≈Ça - the theatre presented all the productions that the theatre in Bielsko had in its repertoire. In 1961 the theatre was handed over to the authorities of Cieszyn and since that time it has been organisationally subordinated to the Municipal House of Culture in Cieszyn. In 1965 another overhaul connected with the modernization of the stage and anti-fire facilities took place; gilding in the auditorium was refreshed as well. A new opening of the theatre took place on 4 December 1965. It was celebrated by a production of The Haunted Manor by Stanis≈Çaw Moniuszko performed by Bytom Opera. Another milestone for the theatre proved to be a two-year general overhaul in 1977-1979. In the course of the overhaul the following works were undertaken: replacement of the roof cover, installation of new window frames and doors, reconstruction of the oak entrance door, replacement of the heating system, installation of new technical equipment, replacement of electric wiring, reconstruction of the stucco of the foyer, the auditorium and staircases, installation of new upholstery of seats. On this occasion a sculptor from Cieszyn, Jan Herma, sculptured for the theatre bass reliefs of Helena Modrzejewska, Stanis≈Çaw Moniuszko and Wojciech Bogus≈Çawski. After completion of the renovation, the theatre was handed over to the administration of the Polish Theatre in Bielsko-Bia≈Ça. At that time the theatre was called the State Polish Theatre Bielsko-Cieszyn of Adam Mickiewicz. The ceremonial opening of the redecorated theatre took place on 5 November 1979. The event was celebrated by a performance of Pan Tadeusz. Since 1993 the Theatre of Adam Mickiewicz has been managed by the city authorities of Cieszyn.  Architecture  Detail of the bas-relief on the theatre fa√ßade A five-story building of a cubic capacity of designed for 770 seats, constructed in the style of late Viennese Baroque. The fa√ßade is distinguished by a seven axes main fa√ßade with a triangle projection. Vertical divisions of the fa√ßade are emphasized by flat listens. A ledge, in its projection part, is finished by a pediment with a ‚Äúkidney window‚Äù and a bas-relief in the shape of leaves, tree branches and decorative motives in rocaille style. Over the window, there is an attribute of Apollo - a bas-relief in the shape of a lire braided with a twig. The building is covered by a high mansard roof with dormers and a turret. The vestibule is entered by three semi-circular portals over which windows were located and decorated by lintels of windowsills and dripstones. Over the central portal leading to the theatre a metal marquise is placed. The interior of the theatre is dominated by three colours: white, gold and red. The first and the second floor is led to by staircases located at the sides of the oval vestibule. A ticket office is designed opposite to the entrance. Behind it there is a corridor surrounding the auditorium located on the ground floor into which ten doors lead. The corridor leads also to the theatre back end: depots, wardrobes, the flat of the guard and a doctor's room. On the first floor there is a foyer with crystal chandeliers, from which one can go to ten box seats and a balcony of the auditorium. Stucco in the shape of leaves, shells and peacock tails located mainly on the ceiling and the frame of the stage. In front of the stage there is an orchestral moat, which can obscure the floor. The portal of the stage is decorated by a mask of Melpomene, and the ceiling is enriched by forged-in metal and plated ceiling. In the lobby of the theatre there is a plaque that commemorates the initiators of the construction of the theatre - Franz Barth and Johann Struhal. The following Viennese artists were responsible for decorating: Heinrich Hendner (stucco work), Friedrich Volkel (sculptures), Josef Kotts, Paul Niedoba (artistic painting), Eduard Riese (artistic metalwork), Ferdinand Moser (stage decoration). The theatre had excellent acoustics - a whisper from the stage was heard in the ninth row on the second balcony, where sound catchers in the shape of a shell were placed. The point of the best audibility was determined on the fifth row of the ground floor.  Activities  The theatre runs culture management activities. It offers performances of: theatre companies, musical companies, opera companies, operetta companies, ballet companies, folkloric companies, recitals, entertainers groups, music bands and cabarets. Frequent events taking place in the theatre are: presentations of amateur troupes, symposia, youth meetings, jubilee celebrations, school talent shows, theatre and film make-up and theatre workshops with a master. One of the recurring events in the theatre since 1989, is the International Theatre Festival At the Border (currently Without Borders), which was organized by the Association of Polish-Czech- Slovak Solidarity.  Trivia  In 1969 An Appeal to the audience of Adam Mickiewicz Theatre in Cieszyn was published, with original ‚Äúcomments on using the theatre‚Äù. They were created by The Theatre Lovers Section and the then Director - Jan Foltyn: # Punctuality is a sign of culture. Entering the audience after a beginning of a performance is not allowed. The late must wait in the corridor until a break. Leaving the audience during a performance should also be reduced to instances of illness, and escaping at the end of a performance, when artists are thanked and given flowers, should not take place. Garments shall be returned only after the lights go on. # Entering the theatre without a ticket is treated similarly to travelling by train or bus without paying a fare. # A well-behaved spectator shall not eat during a performance, make noises with wrappings, treat others with candies, talk, whisper and even hum or speak loudly. # So far smoking is allowed in the lobby on the ground floor and at the buffet on the first floor. On the stairs, in the corridors and in the toilets smoking is not allowed. (Non-compliance shall be penalised by mandates). # All instances of prank and hustle by the young at the stairs and corridors are prohibited. # Booked tickets should be purchased at least 4 days before a performance (...). One should also purchase tickets for the second balcony, where the price is lower, and visibility and acoustics in such a small theatre are good as well. # Giving tickets (especially the ones from companies) for plays for adults to children is pointless, since the young shall not be allowed inside. From 2 to 7 May 1974, inside the theatre Andrzej Wajda was shooting his film entitled The Promised Land. \\"For the purpose of the film seats were removed and replaced by chairs. Also, a classic prompter's box was installed. Small theatre shells with candles were created (this is how a theatre used to be illuminated), door handles were replaced.\\" On 31 May 1991, in the course of the second edition of the International Theatre Festival At the border an unusual event took place related to the production of The Brothers Karamazov prepared by a Czechoslovak theatre from √öst√≠ nad Labem. In the course of the performance the director of the theatre got a phone call from the Border Guard in Cieszyn. The question was: The director was informed that two individuals claiming to be actors were detained for illegal crossing of the border. It was promptly discovered that, indeed, two actors who were about to appear of the stage were missing. Thanks to the goodwill of the commanding officer of the Border Guard and the intervention of the festival organizers - the members of the Association of Polish-Czech- Slovak Solidarity, the actors were brought to the theatre and they participated in the performance. It turned out that the actors became victims of their own ignorance related to crossing the border in ƒåesk√Ω Tƒõ≈°√≠n. The actors were staying on the Czech side of the Olza River and decided to walk from their hotel to the theatre (the remaining part of the theatre group went by bus). They did not take into account the fact that there would be a long queue to the border checks (reaching the railway station in ƒåesk√Ω Tƒõ≈°√≠n). The actors did not have enough time to queue and the queuers, the so-called ants (persons dealing with carrying alcohol and cigarettes from the Czech Republic), did not let them go forward.

Early life and career Born in Woolwich, Kent, Schenley's father was an artillery officer who died in Cadiz, Spain in 1813. Schenley was a volunteer in the Peninsula War and joined the Rifle Brigade as a 15 year old lieutenant in 1814. Subsequently wounded in the Battle of Waterloo, he became friends with Lord Byron.MP of the Month: Edward Wyndham Harrington Schenley (1799-1878), Waterloo veteran and millionaire Retrieved 31 January 2020 Schenley served the Crown in Latin America. In 1825 was appointed Vice Counsel in Guatemala, and in 1828 became Counsel in Venezuela. In 1836 he was appointed as arbitrator to the British and Spanish joint commission addressing slavery in Cuba. Schenley was elected Liberal MP for Dartmouth at the 1859 general election, but was three months later unseated after an election petition committee found his win had been secured through bribery and corruption. Personal life Schenley married three times, all via elopement. He married his first wife, Catherine Inglis, in Leghorn (Livorno) Italy in 1823. He lived with her in Edinburgh, Scotland for several years, and she died in Havana, Cuba in 1837. A son from their union died. He married a second time Jane Maria Pole, daughter of Sir William Templer Pole, 7th Baronet and Charlotte Fraser. They had one child, Fanny Inglis Schenley (born ). Jane died in 1837. In 1841, after falling ill en route to the United States, he stopped in Staten Island, New York to recuperate at the home of his sister in law Lydia Inglis McLeod, who ran a school for girls. It was there that Schenley met the then 15 year old Mary Elizabeth Croghan, daughter of William Croghan and Mary O'Hara. Mary's grandfather, James O'Hara, settled in Pittsburgh prior to the American Revolution in 1773 and became a substantial landowner and businessman in that city. They eloped and were married in New York in early 1842 against the wishes of her widowed father, and they then moved to England.Gouverneur, Marian.

In 1872 she married Arthur Kindersley Blair, formerly a Captain in the 71st Highland Light Infantry. He had resigned his commission in 1861 and was then employed as land agent and business manager by George Sutherland-Leveson- Gower, 3rd Duke of Sutherland, who was one of the richest people in Britain, owning 1.4 million acres of land and Stafford House, a mansion in London. The Queen visited Stafford House and was known for noting that Stafford House was more of a palace than her own home. Mary Blair became the Duke's mistress and when in 1883 her husband died in a shooting accident there was speculation that it was suicide or murder, although he official verdict was accidental death. The affair continued after her husband's death, but in 1889 she caused a scandal when she and the Duke married only four months after the death of the Duke's estranged wife. This broke the convention that widowers should not remarry for a year and it went against written advice to the Duke from Queen Victoria. Blair now had a high rank in British society but she was not welcome at any society event. Carbisdale Castle In 1892 the Duke died and Blair was due to inherit instead of the children from the Duke's first marriage including Cromartie Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 4th Duke of Sutherland. The will was contested and the case was confused because Blair had arranged for documents to be burnt. The judge sent her to Holloway Jail for six weeks. An agreement was made and Blair was given sufficient funds to build Carbisdale Castle. The castle was built just outside the family's lands and it had a clock tower with three faces. The fourth face had no clock as it faced the family's lands and it was said that Blair did not wish to \\"give them the time of day\\". Blair bought paintings and sculptures including Andromeda by Pasquale Romanelli. Blair's third husband was Sir Albert Rollit. She died in London on 27 May 1912.

The day is celebrated on the 5th of May each year. UNESCO declared the day in 2018. Proclaimed by the 38th session of the General Conference of UNESCO (November 2015), African World Heritage Day (5 May) is an opportunity for people around the world, and particularly Africans, to celebrate the continent's unique cultural and natural heritage. While Africa is underrepresented on the World Heritage List (African properties account for some 12% of all inscribed sites worldwide), a dis-proportionally high percentage (39%) of these properties are on the World Heritage List in Danger. Faced with various contemporary threats, such as climate change, uncontrolled development, poaching, civil unrest and instability, many of Africa's wonders risk losing their outstanding universal value. It is, therefore, more urgent than ever that this irreplaceable heritage be protected and preserved for the enjoyment of future generations. UNESCO is committed to spearheading international efforts to draw on the vast potential of Africa's cultural and natural heritage as a force for poverty reduction and social cohesion as well as a driver of sustainable development and innovation. Through this international day, UNESCO aims to increase global awareness of African heritage, with a special focus on youth, and to mobilise enhanced cooperation for its safeguarding on the local, regional and global level. The Day was established to raise awareness of the immense potential of the African cultural and natural heritage. It also aims to alert the world to the vulnerability of this heritage: there are 21 African sites on the List of World Heritage in Danger. The preservation and enhancement of this heritage are essential factors in sustainable development, the only kind of development capable of meeting the complex challenges that face Africa today and include climate change, the challenge of education and the economy, and rapid urbanization. Mobilizing local communities, especially young people, around the safeguarding of the heritage, involving them in projects that place value on their cultural identity and natural environment, is one of the best ways of opening up prospects for the future and for development. It is in particular through training and education that this mobilization may eventually prove to be most effective.  Challenges and development opportunities  African World Heritage Day is the ideal time to raise awareness among the general public about the urgent need to protect African heritage. Irina Bokova, Director-General of UNESCO, declared that \\"today more than 23 African sites are on the List of World Heritage in Danger (...); all are threatened and are at risk of disappearing if we do not act quickly. We each have a role to play.\\" Africa, the cradle of humanity, remains underrepresented on the World Heritage List with only 131 sites (12%, including 90 sites in Sub-Saharan Africa and 41 sites in North Africa) Yet the 23 African sites inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger account for 42% of all sites on the List. Heritage protection on the African continent faces numerous challenges such as armed conflict, terrorism, poaching and illicit trafficking, global warming and natural disasters, uncontrolled urban expansion, unregulated tourism, and mining and oil exploration. In response to this situation, the Ngorongoro Declaration, which resulted from the first major international conference on African World Heritage (June 2016, Tanzania), affirms that sustainable development can ensure that appropriate efforts are deployed to protect endangered resources in Africa, making the safeguarding of heritage a driver for sustainable development. The Declaration also calls on \\"African States Parties to promote the role that women and youth play in the conservation and management of cultural and natural heritage\\".  African World Heritage Regional Youth Forum  The African World Heritage Regional Youth Forum on \\"Increasing youth involvement in the promotion and protection of African World Heritage\\" took place at the Robben Island World Heritage Site in Cape Town from the 28 April to the 4 May 2016. The forum was organised by the African World Heritage Fund (AWHF) in partnership with the South African Government and the UNESCO World Heritage Centre and hosted by the Robben Island Museum. The participants included a total of 27 young individuals from 23 African countries ‚Äì Botswana, Cameroon, Egypt, Ethiopia, The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Malawi, Mauritius, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Seychelles, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. In total, there were fourteen (14) females and thirteen (13) males. The Forum was also attended by various dignitaries including the Minister of Tourism of South Africa, Mr. Derek Hanekom who delivered a keynote address at the Opening Ceremony while the Closing Ceremony featured the Deputy Director General of Institutional Governance, who was representing the Deputy Minister of Arts and Culture, Ms. Rejoice Thizwilondi Mabudafhasi.
