The bronzes were cast by Fundere Foundry, Melbourne, Australia. On the front plinth is a piece of poetry about the Boer War, written by Australian poet Banjo Paterson in 1902, that mentions the Monaro region in which Canberra is sited. : When the dash and the excitement and the novelty are dead, : And you've seen a load of wounded once or twice, : Or you've watched your old mate dying, with the vultures overhead, : Well you wonder if the war is worth the price, : And down along the Monaro now they're starting out to shear, : I can picture the excitement and the row; : But they'll miss you on the Lachlan when they call the roll this year, : For we're going on a long job now.On the Trek, AB Paterson, \\"Rio Grande's Last Race and Other Verses\\" On top of the front plinth are bronze plaques showing a soldier's words in his own hand, recalling various thoughts about being at the war.

WeissmannColumbia Law Review, Vol. 84, No. 5 (June 1984), p. 1297 (born March 17, 1958) is an American attorney. Starting in 2015 he became the chief of the criminal fraud section of the U.S. Department of Justice. In June 2017 he was appointed to a management role on the 2017 special counsel team headed by Robert Mueller. To assume that position, Weissmann took a leave from his DOJ post. The Special Counsel's investigation concluded in 2019 and Weissmann went into the private sector. Education Weissmann has a bachelor's degree from Princeton University (1980). Following a Fulbright scholarship to the University of Geneva, he attended and graduated from Columbia Law School (1984). He then clerked for Judge Eugene Nickerson in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. Career In 1991, Weissmann worked as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York and would remain in this role until 2002. While at EDNY, Weissmann tried more than 25 cases, some of which involved members of the Genovese, Colombo and Gambino crime families.Darren Samuelsohn. Everything we know about the Mueller probe so far. Politico, June 6, 2017. He led the prosecution team in the Vincent Gigante case, in which Gigante was convicted. From 2002 to 2005, Weissmann was the deputy director appointed by George W. Bush, prior to his assignment as the director of the task force investigating the Enron scandal. His work resulted in the prosecution of more than 30 people for crimes including perjury, fraud, and obstruction including three of Enron's top executives, Andrew Fastow, Kenneth Lay, and Jeffrey Skilling. In a follow-up case in U.S. District Court, Weissmann also was successful at arguing that auditing firm Arthur Andersen LLP had covered up for Enron.

Antibiot., 2002, 55, 46-52 Analysis of the bacteria identified a new class of molecule containing a dimeric-tetracyclic polyketide backbone, which are now known as the hibarimicins. Hibarimicinone and its derivatives were initially extracted for their potential inhibitory properties of various protein kinases, such as calmodulin-dependent protein kinase III (CAMKIII), protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), and protein tyrosine kinase (PTK). The atropisomerism that the hibarimicin family possess arises from the hindered rotation about the biaryl axis connecting to the two monomers, with steric hindrance imposed by the four ortho substituents.Smyth, J.; Butler, N.; Keller, P. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2015, 32, 1562-1583 The absolute configuration around the axis was elucidated by Romaine et. al., utilizing a C2-symmetric shunt metabolite HMP-Y6, a glycosylated structural analogue of hibarimicinone, in tandem with biomimetic homocoupling.Romaine, I.

Rec., 2014, 14, 28-40  Biosynthesis  The biosynthesis of hibarimicinone was initially hypothesized to be produced from a polyketide synthase. Through 13C-labelling and blocked mutants of the TP-A0121 strain, Oki et al. demonstrated that hibarimicinone is produced by an oxidative coupling of two tetracyclic polyketides, which undergo an oxidative cyclization to generate the ether ring. The hibarimicinone monomer is formed initially by a Type II polyketide synthase. The 22 carbon chain is initiated by butyryl-CoA and its decarboxylative addition to a malonyl-CoA derived two carbon ketide unit. The KS/CLF binds to the starting butyryl-CoA, freeing the ACP domain to bind to another malonate group from malonyl-CoA. Thioester exchange occurs between the KS/CLF and the ACP; the cycle then repeats nine more times to produce the full carbon chain (1).Dewick, Paul M. (2002). Medicinal Natural Products. John Wiley and Sons, LTD Multiple aldol additions occur to form four six-membered cyclization and aromization (2). The CLF/KS subunit is cleaved off by a thioesterase and modified by numerous steps (four oxidations, two NADPH dependent reductions, two methylations and decarboxylation) to form the final monomeric unit (3). Two monomer units undergo oxidative coupling to form the atropisomeric axis (4). Oxidative cyclization occurs on one end of the molecule to form the ether ring (5). Finally, the hydroquinone on the same side of the previously mentioned ether oxidizes to form the quinone species, giving hibarimicinone.

The car is based on the Ariel Atom and the Lotus Elise (for the Beast Alpha X Blackbird) sports cars utilising them as its chassis. Prices start at US$95,000 to US$325,000.  Models  = Beast = The Rezvani Beast is the base model of the lineup. However, it is more expensive than its targa variant, being listed at US$159,000. Because of the car's presence as a convertible, the car has been dubbed the \\"Rezvani Beast Speedster\\". The Beast was designed by Azerbaijani designer Samir Sadikhov. The Beast contains a 2.4-liter supercharged I4 with a dual overhead camshaft and intercooler, producing . This power is delivered to the rear wheels by a 6-speed manual transmission, which is the only transmission available for the model. This car contains a chromoly tubular chassis and a dual-layer carbon fiber body without doors. The underpinnings are from an Ariel Atom. The wheels are made entirely from forged aluminum. A version of the Beast came out later. The car is the same as the older Beast, with a of 2.9 seconds, but the only difference being that the car is more powerful. The weight is at , making the car's power-to- weight ratio be set to per ton. The design for the base model Beast was built in a year. The Beast also has the original Ariel Atom brake calipers and discs installed, and has a custom horn. Because the car is a convertible, it had to have waterproof leather installed. This car contains a 2-year unlimited mile warranty. = Beast Alpha = The Beast Alpha is essentially a coupe version of the Beast. The car debuted in a Rezvani keynote in 2016. Even as the Alpha is not a base model, it is cheaper than its speedster counterpart at US$95,000, due to price drops after its debut. It was originally US$200,000. This price drop began in 2018. The car includes what Rezvani calls \\"Sidewinder\\" doors, which are doors that pop to the side and slide forward. This is the only Beast to have these doors. However, this is not standard, but a US$10,000 option. The car has a new 2.4-liter turbocharged I4 tuned by Cosworth, which pushes out . The car's acceleration time is slower than the regular Beast, at 3.5 seconds. The Alpha's top speed is . The car's power is sent to the rear wheels by a 6-speed manual. Instead of the chromoly chassis, the chassis is aluminum. The car's weight is slightly heavier, at ., which makes the car's power-to-weight ratio lower, at per ton. This is due to the addition of new features. These include air conditioning, driver-selectable traction control, air bags, a roof (targa style; removable), climate control, and functional doors. The name Alpha slightly resembles this lower specification rating because of its usage in early models before their final product. The car's options are very costly. For example, a 6-speed semi- automatic with paddle shifters is available for US$15,000, and the \\"Sidewinder\\" doors are for US$10,000. = Beast X = The Beast X is the most powerful variant of the Beast, priced at US$159,000 to US$270,000. The prices differ because there are two variants; one for the Beast, another for the Beast Alpha. Only five of these cars will be produced. The convertible X contains the 2.5-liter Cosworth I4 but is turbocharged this time by a pair of BorgWarners. This pushes out . Combined with a curb weight of , the car has a power-to-weight ratio of per ton. The car's design has been slightly changed for aerodynamic purposes. There are new added aero gaps, and fender grilles, and also a new split spoiler that loosely resembles the Pagani Zonda C12. The front and rear have been revised to add extra downforce, along with the gaps, grilles, and spoiler. This power is sent to the rear wheels by a 6-speed manual transmission, with a semi-automatic as an option for the X. The car has a time of 2.5 seconds. =Beast Alpha X= The coupe version of X, with the same 2.5-liter turbocharged Cosworth I4, but only makes . No aerodynamic pieces are added though, and is basically the same design to the Beast Alpha. The weight is the same as the Beast and Beast X, at . Power-to-weight ratio is at per ton. The power is delivered by a 6-speed manual transmission. The body is made of carbon fiber. =Beast Alpha X Blackbird= The most extreme version of the Beast Alpha dubbed the Beast Alpha X Blackbird was launched in 2018. The car features a body made from carbon fibre, sidewinder doors, a signature element of Beast Alpha and a 2.5-litre turbocharged Inline-4 engine developed in collaboration with Cosworth producing . Power is transferred to the rear wheels through a 6-speed manual transmission while sequential manual transmission is available as an option. Weight has also been reduced to . Due to the upgrades, the car is capable of accelerating from in 2.9 seconds. Comfort of the occupants is also kept in consideration and features such as power windows, air conditioning, central locking system and infotainment system is included as standard. The car is available at a base price of US$325,000.  Reception  Jay Leno featured a review about the Rezvani Beast on his YouTube channel. Overall, the car received positive reception from him. Jeff Glucker from the channel The Hooniverse reviewed the Rezvani Beast. He mentioned the car used a very well-made platform (the Ariel Atom), a good engine, good suspension, and nice looks. Forward visibility was well done, but the side mirrors weren't too practical. The car was already difficult to drive, but Glucker mentioned that Rezvani had slightly altered the wheelbase to give better stability. The removable steering was made for much a better entrance and exit on the car. Suspension was amazing, and grip was very good thanks to the width and stickiness. The transmission shifter was also well done, the clutch felt quick, and the pedals were good. Glucker also mentioned that the car felt very raw because of the absence of power steering. Matt Farah reviewed a Beast, and drove it down the Ortega Highway of California State Route 74. He mentioned that the car that the steering is very tight, making it feel like a Le Mans Prototype or a Formula One car, which made it difficult to manage around roads. He also mentioned that the gas pedal was heavy to push, and that steering without power assist and having large tires made steering harder. He then stated that braking wasn't too stable, the car felt like an actual race car and not a road car that fulfills the race car feel, and that turning radius was a bit bad. The car was also too sensitive in Farah's view. Because of these downsides when driving, he stated that professional drivers are able to take the struggles, but not so much for amateurs. it also made him frightened to push further. He did mention that the styling was beautiful, it was quick, and that the supercharger made the car sound good, in the positive side. Overall, Farah said that the car was not worth US$159,000, but he was happy it exists because of how cool and unique it is.

She has also played for English county sides Berkshire and Devon, and the New Zealand team Canterbury Magicians. Originally from Newcastle in the Hunter region of New South Wales, Hall was inspired as a young cricketer by Mark Waugh and Hunter area players Belinda Clark, Leah Poulton and Sarah Andrews. At the end of the 2004‚Äì05 season, she won the Cricket NSW female Rising Star award. However, NSW had such a strong women's cricket team that there was not a lot of opportunity for her in that state. In 2009, Hall was recruited by Cricket Tasmania to play for Tasmanian Roar, as that team began its first season in the Women's National Cricket League. After joining the Roar, she became a top order batter, and also a regular bowler. She continued to live in Sydney and train with a Sydney-based coach, but travelled to Tasmania for training camps, pre-season tours and matches. Hall was selected as a Hobart Hurricane for its inaugural WBBL01 competition (2015‚Äì16). In a memorable performance that season against the Melbourne Renegades at Aurora Stadium in Launceston, she took two sharp catches, one of them in a one-handed leap, achieved two run outs, and was named player-of-the-match. In July 2016, Hall was disciplined by Cricket Australia after admitting a charge of placing two bets relating to two matches in the Matador Cup competition. She received a two-year ban, 18 months of which were suspended. Cricket Tasmania announced that it would continue to support her, as she had accepted her penalty and apologised to the organisation, including the Cricket Tasmania Board, coaching staff and her teammates. As the ban was backdated to the date in April 2016 when Cricket Australia was made aware of the breach, the active part of it expired in October 2016. Hall remained contracted to the Roar, and was selected in the Hurricanes squad for the WBBL02 season (2016‚Äì17). In November 2018, she was named in the Hobart Hurricanes' squad for the 2018‚Äì19 Women's Big Bash League season. Off the field, Hall has studied Early Childhood and Nursing. , she was managing a retail cricket store.

The family immigrated to the United States in 1924, first settling in Washington and later moving to California. Whiteley studied microbiology at the University of California, Berkeley, where she received her B.S. in 1941. She then earned a master's degree from the University of Texas, Galveston and her Ph.D. from the University of Washington, where her husband Arthur Whiteley was at the time an assistant professor of zoology. After graduating in 1951, Whiteley returned to California and spent two years working for the United States Atomic Energy Commission. Academic career Whiteley returned to the University of Washington in 1953 and became a full professor in 1965. She held several leadership roles with the American Society for Microbiology, chairing its division of physiology and its publications board; she served as the society's president in 1976. Whiteley also chaired a committee for collaboration in microbiology research between scientists in the US and the Soviet Union. Research Whiteley's research focused on the physiology of bacteria. She is best known for work with colleague Ernest Schnepf studying insecticidal proteins (known as Cry proteins) found in the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis. This work laid the foundation for genetically modified organisms that transgenically express insecticidal proteins. Personal life Whiteley met her husband Arthur as a student at Berkeley. He held a professorship at the University of Washington when she began her Ph.D. research there. Her research and success at earning research funding have been credited with prompting the university to revise its rules against employing both members of a married couple as faculty.

He studied biology as an undergraduate at Kalamazoo College and then received a master's degree in zoology from the University of Wisconsin. He moved to the University of California, Berkeley for his Ph.D., which focused on early use of 32P radioisotope labeling in biology, supervised by Sumner Cushing Brooks. Whiteley then spent time at Princeton University on a war-related project on decompression sickness in aviation. He next moved to the University of Texas, Galveston and then back to California to work with Albert Tyler at the California Institute of Technology, where he was first exposed to the topic of sea urchin development. Academic career Whiteley joined the faculty at the University of Washington in 1947, which also marked the beginning of his long association with the Friday Harbor Laboratories. Whiteley's research throughout his career focused on the development of sea urchin embryos, with particular focus on the genetic mechanisms controlling development and on the enzymes involved in sea urchin metabolism. Whiteley was recognized as a committed teacher as well as a researcher, and was noted for his long support of a program for training graduate students in developmental biology, which he directed until 1985.

In 2008, recordings from the album were compiled as bonus tracks for the first CD issue of Pacific Ocean Blue. In 2017, the same track selection was given a dedicated release, titled Bambu (The Caribou Sessions). Background Bambu began production in 1978 at Brother Studios in Santa Monica with the collaboration of then Beach Boys keyboardist and Dennis Wilson's close friend Carli Mu√±oz as songwriter and producer. The first four songs that were officially recorded for Bambu were Mu√±oz's compositions: \\"It's Not Too Late\\", \\"Constant Companion\\", \\"All Alone\\", and \\"Under the Moonlight\\". The project was initially scuttled by lack of financing and the distractions of simultaneous Beach Boys projects. Bambu was released in 2008 along with the Pacific Ocean Blue reissue.

It has a large rosette of leaves at the base of a flowering spike and a single white flower with green or reddish-brown stripes. Description Pterostylis allantoidea, is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and which usually grows in colonies. It has a rosette of large, dark green leaves with wrinkled edges, each leaf long and wide. When flowering, there is usually only a single, white flower with green or reddish-brown stripes. The flowers lean forwards and are long, wide and borne on a flowering spike tall. The dorsal sepal and petals form a hood over the column. The dorsal sepal is longer than the petals and has a thread-like tip long. The lateral sepals are erect with thread-like tips long with a bulging sinus between them. The labellum is egg-shaped, long, about wide, thick, fleshy, dark brown and curved and protrudes above the sinus. Flowering occurs from August to September. Taxonomy and naming Pterostylis allantoidea was first formally described in 1940 by Richard Sanders Rogers in Transactions of the Royal Society of South Australia. The specific epithet (allantoidea) is from the Latin allantoideus, 'sausage-shaped', referring to the shape of the labellum. Distribution and habitat The shy greenhood grows on and near granite outcrops under shrubs between Coolgardie, Ravensthorpe and Israelite Bay in the Coolgardie and Esperance Plains biogeographic regions of Western Australia.

Pizza Panopoulos settled in Sudbury, and then Elliot Lake, Ontario, where he found work in the mines. After sampling pizza in Naples, Panopoulos first tried pizza in North America when he visited Windsor, Ontario. With his brothers Elias and Nikitas, Panopoulos owned the Satellite Restaurant in Chatham, Ontario. They offered typical American items such as burgers and fries and American Chinese dishes, some of which mix sweet and savoury flavours. In the early 1960s Panopoulos started offering pizzas, recently popular in the US. In 1962 he had the idea to add canned pineapple to pizza. This innovation (sometimes disputed) became popular with his customers, yet over time has also earned the disdain of pizza puritans. In February 2017, when Iceland's President Gu√∞ni Th.

His most famous discovery (with Robert Broom) was the nearly complete fossil skull of the hominin species Australopithecus africanus, known as Mrs. Ples.  Education and career  Giant girdled lizard Robinson was born in Elliot, South Africa to Theodore Clement Robinson and Florence Harriett Robinson (n√©e Selby), both descendants of the British 1820 Settlers. He attended the University of Cape Town where he obtained a BSc in zoology and bacteriology in 1943 and an MSc (zoology) in 1944, with a thesis on the giant girdled lizard (Cordylus giganteus). He contributed to two dissection manuals, one on the clawed frog (Xenopus) and the other on the spiney dogfish shark (Squalus). He started his doctorate in marine biology in Cape Town and even went so far as to publish descriptions of new diatoms and copepods but he interrupted it by moving to the Transvaal Museum in Pretoria at the end of 1945 to take up the position of \\"assistant professional officer\\". He became the assistant to Anthonie Johannes Theodorus Janse, a Lepidoptera specialist (a moth specialist). The pre-eminent paleontologist Robert Broom was working at the Transvaal Museum at that time and the museum felt that he needed a collection manager as Broom had gotten into the habit of merely memorising contextual information about fossil specimens instead of physically recording the provenance information systematically. It was the Canadian geologist H. B. S. Cooke who suggested that Robinson should assist Broom. This did not please Janse. Australopithecus sediba In April 1946 Robinson became the assistant to Robert Broom and he worked with him for four years until Broom's death in 1951. They focused on excavations at the caves of Sterkfontein (where they discovered \\"Mrs. Ples\\" a specimen of Australopithecus africanus, in 1947), Swartkrans (which yielded several fossils of Paranthropus robustus and Telanthropis capensis) and Kromdraai. They discovered over 300 specimens of early humans, the Australopithecinae. Between 1946 and 1952 they jointly published twenty-three books and articles. After Broom's death, Robinson worked with C.K. Brain. In 1955 Robinson completed his PhD in zoology at the University of Cape Town but with a dissertation \\"The Dentition of the Australopithecinae\\", published 1956 and arguably his most important work. He took over as head of the Department of Vertebrate Paleontology and Physical Anthropology and eventually became assistant director of the Transvaal Museum. In 1963 Robinson began a professorship in zoology and anthropology at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison where he remained until his retirement in 1983. He taught courses in evolutionary theory and human origins, zoology and anthropology. He was director of the University of Wisconsin Zoological Museum from 1979 to 1981. Robinson continued to make trips back to South Africa to carry out research.  Significance of discoveries  When Robinson first started collaborating with Broom in 1946 the scientific community was just beginning to accept the fossil ancestors of modern humans that had been found in South Africa but the nature of our early ancestors and the evolutionary trajectory from early primates to australopithecines to modern humans remained unknown. The only substantial australopithecine samples known at that time were excavated by Robinson and Broom since Louis Leakey did not find any fossils in Olduvai Gorge until 1959. The discovery in 1947 of \\"Mrs Ples\\", an essentially complete adult australopithecine skull, led to the conclusion that australopithecines were ancestral to modern humans. Robinson went on to explain the biological adaptations of the australopithecines and put their morphological characteristics into a comprehensive picture of hominid adaptation and evolution. He also established the two lineages of hominids that had existed in the past. Robinson made the first broad functional analysis of the postcranial anatomy of the australopithecines which established that australopithecines were committed bipeds. He published his finding in the book Early Hominid Posture and Locomotion (1976). The presence of both Paranthropus robustus and Telanthropis capensis at Swartkrans provided the first evidence of the co-existence of two hominid species in the Pleistocene in Africa. This was later confirmed by other paleontological sites in Africa.  Personal life  He died in Madison, Wisconsin in 2001. He was survived by his wife, Sybil Robinson who was Professor Emeritus of the University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Theatre and Drama. Their two sons predeceased him.

It is most commonly found in octahedral, diamond, or rectangular shapes, but it can also come in various other intricately woven complex forms. It is known under many different names throughout the Philippines with numerous variations, but it is usually associated with the street food cultures of the Visayan and Moro peoples. Pus√¥ refers to the way of cooking and serving rice on woven leaves, and thus does not refer to a specific recipe. It can actually refer to many different ways of preparing rice, ranging from plain, to savory or sweet. Regardless, all of them are woven pouches where rice is poured inside and cooked by boiling. Pus√¥ are differentiated from other leaf-wrapped Filipino dishes like suman, binalot, and pastil, in that the latter use leaves that are simply wrapped around the food and folded or tied. Pus√¥, in contrast, uses intricate woven leaves as the pouch. Pus√¥ is traditionally prepared as a way to pack rice for journeys and is eaten held in the hands while standing, usually paired with meat or seafood cooked on skewers (commonly satti or \\"barbecue\\"). It is still eaten this way from street food peddlers (pungko- pungko). In seated dining, it is commonly cut into pieces and served on a plate in place of regular rice. Pus√¥ were once culturally important among pre- Hispanic Filipinos as offerings to the diwata spirits and as an extension of the basic skill of weaving among women. It became linked to festivities since they were commonly served during religious events, especially the more complex woven variations. It is still used in rituals in some parts of the Philippines today, though the rituals themselves have been mostly Christianized. Similarly, it remained culturally important to Muslim Filipinos, where it became symbolic of the Hari Raya feast. Pus√¥ is related to similar dishes in other rice-farming Austronesian cultures, most notably the Malaysian and Indonesian ketupat, although the latter is restricted to diamond shapes and is woven differently. A very similar octahedron-shaped version called atupat was also found in pre-colonial Guam, before the ancient rice cultivation in the island was replaced by corn brought by the Spanish. Names Pus√¥ (also spelled puso, poso, or pus√≥) literally means \\"heart\\" in Cebuano, due to its resemblance to a heart with the two loose ends of the coconut leaf emerging at the top resembling the aorta and the venae cavae. Its other most common name, patupat, originally means \\"four-cornered [rectangle or cube]\\", a reduplication of Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *epat (\\"four\\"). This form is still evident in old Chamorro cognate atupat. Pus√¥ is also known by various names in different ethnic groups in the Philippines, including piyusopus√≥ in Mindoro languages; piyoso in Maranao, Iranun and Maguindanaon; langbay, lambay, or linambay in Waray; bugn√≥y in Hiligaynon; tam-o in Aklanon; tamu, ta‚Äômu, or temu in Tausug and Yakan; sinambong, patupat or pus√∫ in Kapampangan, Pangasinan and Ilocano; and katumpat in Sama-Bajau. Description Pus√¥ does not refer to a specific recipe, rather it is a way of packaging and serving rice. Therefore, it can actually refer to many different ways of preparing rice, ranging from plain, to savory or sweet. Regardless, all of them are woven pouches where rice is poured inside and cooked by boiling. As the rice cooks, it is prevented from spreading by the pouch, resulting in a compacted cake-like texture. It can be made with either regular white rice or glutinous rice poured into a pre-woven container and then immersed in a boiling liquid. It is commonly plain, but it can be cooked with meat or flavored with gata (coconut milk) and spices like salt or ginger. Other variants of the dish can also be sweet and can be cooked with muscovado sugar. Lechon manok (roast chicken) served with pus√¥ Pus√¥ are differentiated from other leaf-wrapped Filipino dishes like the Tagalog binalot and the Maguindanao pastil, as well as various kakanin snacks wrapped in leaves found throughout the Philippines, like suman and mor√≥n. These dishes all use leaves that are simply wrapped around the food and folded or tied. They are not woven into complex patterns unlike pus√¥. Leaf-weaving is an ancient art in the Philippines and is used to make various traditional handicrafts like baskets, hats, mats, toys, sidings, and even religious decorations (both in ancient anitism and in modern Christian Palm Sunday celebrations). Food, as well, is commonly wrapped in woven leaves, the most commonly used being banana or coconut leaves. It makes them aesthetically pleasing, practical to eat, and infuses the food with the aroma of the leaves. Pus√¥ pouches are almost always woven from coconut leaves, though they can also be made from other palm species or from pandan leaves. The coconut leaves used are freshly sprouted, usually pale yellow to light green in color and far more pliable than older leaves. These young leaves are known as lukay in most Visayan regions; palaspas, usbong, talbos, or ibus in Southern Luzon; dugokan in Leyte; ugbos in Bohol; uyok in Masbate; and langk√≥y in Bicol. There are numerous techniques by which they can be woven, which has translated into many different kinds of pus√¥. Weavers of pus√¥ are traditionally known as mamumuso or manlalah in Cebuano. Cultural significance Tausug ta'mu is commonly served with satti in peanut sauce Pus√¥ originated from a method of cooking and packing rice. It was also prominent in religious rituals in the anitism of pre-colonial Filipinos. The smaller or more elaborate versions were a traditional part of the food offerings to the diwata spirits, a tradition the Spanish referred to as offrendas. These traditions have been increasingly forgotten or syncretized as Filipinos converted to Christianity and Islam in the last few centuries. Rituals involving pus√¥ in the past in Cebuano religion include harang sa mga kalag (ritual preventing the deceased from affecting the living); sagangsang (ritual for tub√¢ palm wine gatherers); damit (pre-harvest ritual); buhat silang (a thanksgiving post-harvest ritual); tigpo (ritual asking for forgiveness from spirits of the dead); and balangkisaw (ritual asking for forgiveness from water spirits). Nevertheless, it still survives in some (Christianized) rituals today, like in the pamisa (Catholic prayer for the dead). It is also still a regular part of the offrenda. Though in modern times the offering is usually to the household Catholic altar or to deceased loved ones, and not to diwata spirits. Among Muslim Filipinos, it also survives as a festive food, and is very popular during a lot of Islamic holidays. It is particularly associated with the Hari Raya celebrations at the end of Ramadan. Variations Pus√¥ can be made in many different shapes using a wide variety of techniques. Some ethnic groups have numerous traditional variants, while in other ethnic groups, it is restricted to one or two. A lot of the techniques are also shared across ethnic groups and may be known under different names, indicating shared origins or cultural exchange between the groups in pre-colonial Philippines. Binaki-style pus√¥ with various meat grilled on skewers *Binaki ‚Äì also bakibaki, meaning \\"frog-like\\". This widespread version resembles a sitting frog with five angular points. It is made from a single strand with the loose end emerging opposite the frond base. It is also known as kongkang among the Palawan people, also a reference to its frog-like shape. It is known as uwan-uwan (\\"little pillow\\") among the Sama Bajau people and as piyusopus√∫ (a type of bird) among the Mangyan people. Other names for it in Cebuano-speaking areas include binaba (\\"mouthful\\"), and sinayop (evolving from Old Visayan sinaop, meaning \\"clasped hands\\"). It is also referred to as bayi tam-o (\\"female tam-o\\") among the Aklanon people, probably because it resembles breasts. It is also the version historically referred to as lambay, langbay, linambay, or linangbay, literally \\"crab-like\\". *Binangkito ‚Äì also binangkaso, a complex version from Anda, Bohol that resembles an upside-down bangko (a stool with four legs), usually used as a ritual offering on lantayan altars. *Binosa ‚Äì the smallest type of pus√¥. It is woven from a single strand and is shaped like a wineglass. It is unique in that it is almost always used as an offering to diwata spirits. They are from the town of Taptap in Cebu. A similar variant is called inumol in Anda, Bohol and like binosa is also used as spirit offerings. *Binungi ‚Äì literally \\"extracted tooth\\". Another small version from Talamban, Cebu, although this one is made for fun, rather than as a ritual offering. It resembles a molar, with a wide top and a base with short protrusions. *Bulasa ‚Äì very small pus√¥ from Negros Oriental that contain more or less only a handful of rice. They often contain kakanin and are served during feasts and weddings. It is also known as tamu lugus (\\"areca nut tamu\\") among the Yakan people and kimes a datu (\\"[rice clenched] in the hand of the \\"datu\\") among the Maranao people. *Hellu ‚Äì a somewhat diagonal elongated version from the Tausug people. It is very rare and isn't anymore used to cook rice. It may be the same pattern named as bayubayo by Spanish sources. *Kambing ‚Äì literally \\"goat-like\\". A Yakan version similar to the Cebuano minanok, but it has additional details that make it resemble a goat instead of a chicken. Kinasing-style pus√¥ from Cebu *Kinasing ‚Äì literally meaning \\"heart-like\\". This version is shaped like an elongated octahedron. It is woven from two strands with the loose ends emerging from the top where the base of the fronds also emege. It is the most common version found in Cebuano-speaking regions, including Cebu, Camiguin, Northern Mindanao, and Sarangani *Kumo ‚Äì a two-strand version from Samar woven to resemble a clenched fist. Like the binosa, they are often used solely as offerings. *Manan-aw ‚Äì a rare version found in Cebu. \\"Manan-aw\\" is the local Cebuano common name of the moon orchid (Phalaenopsis amabilis). This variant is named after its resemblance to its flowers. It is very large, even larger than pinawikan, and is made with eight strips. *Minanok ‚Äì literally \\"chicken- like\\". A version from Taptap, Cebu that is shaped like a chicken. It is used as a ritual offering. Also known as langgam (\\"bird\\"). *Pat bettes ‚Äì literally \\"cow hooves\\". A triangular pyramid-shaped version, very common among the Tausug people. It has four corners at the base, and three corners on each side meeting to a point. Ilocano patupat, a typically rectangular-shaped sweet variant made with glutinous rice boiled in a mixture of coconut milk and muscovado sugar *Patupat ‚Äì a version from Northern Luzon shaped like a flat rectangle. It is unique in that it is always cooked a dessert, never plain or savory. It is boiled in coconut milk and muscovado sugar or even molasses. It is also known as tikob among Tagalogs. Both names refer to its rectangular shape. *Pinagbutasan ‚Äì probably the same version used in the pagbutas funerary ritual described by Spanish sources. Although modern folk etymology attribute the origin of its name to a story about a datu who married a second wife and was abandoned by hist first wife after he offered her the smaller portion of the pus√¥ he had cut in half. It is triangular in shape with the leaf base and the loose ends emerging out at one point. *Pinawikan ‚Äì literally meaning \\"sea turtle-like\\". Also known as binadbaranay (\\"unraveling\\"), pinagi (ray-like), and binalek (\\"returned\\"). It is a large version made with four strands whose loose ends are woven back into the other strands. It is commonly found in Cebu and Negros Oriental. *Pudol ‚Äì also tinigib or dumpol, meaning \\"cut off\\". Resembles kinasing and is woven similarly, but the pointed tip at the bottom is flattened. It is also known as buwah pagung (\\"nipa palm fruit\\") among Sama- Bajau, and tamu sibulyas (\\"onion tamu\\") in Tausug. *Tamu Bawang ‚Äì literally \\"garlic tamu\\". A Tausug version that resembles the Cebuano kinasing, except that the loose ends emerge from one of the corners in the center, and not at the ends. *Tamu Buyung Kambing ‚Äì literally \\"goat's scrotum tamu\\". A Yakan version shaped like two small pouches merging in the middle. *Tamu Duwa Susu ‚Äì literally \\"two nipples tamu\\". A Yakan version named for the two corners on its upper side. *Tamu Pinad ‚Äì the most common version used by Tausug people for Hari Raya festivities. The name means \\"diamond-shaped tamu\\" because it has a flattened diamond shape. It is the most similar to Malaysian and Indonesian ketupat. *Tamu Sumbay ‚Äì a Yakan version that resembles a basket called sumbay. It has a wide base and a narrow top, somewhat resembling a woman's handbag. *Tamu Tempipih ‚Äì a Yakan version named after a similarly-shaped basket. It resembles the Tausug pinad with one corner cut off. *Tinumpei ‚Äì a complex version from the Yakan people similar to the binangkito, except that the points are flattened, making it look like a four-pointed star. The name refers to the tumpei, a traditional bag used by Yakan farmers. It may possibly be the same pattern named as binitoon by Spanish sources among Visayans. *Ulona a babak ‚Äì a version from the Maranao people identical in construction to the patupat but isn't used to hold sweetened rice. The name literally means \\"pillow of the monkey\\". It may also be the tambong and binairan versions mentioned by Spanish sources. History Leaf-wrapped dishes are one of the earliest native Filipino food described by the Spaniards when they arrived in the Philippines. The first recorded mention of rice cooked in leaves is by Antonio Pigafetta who wrote in 1525 of a Visayan meal of rice and millet wrapped in leaves served with roast fish. There are six main accounts of pus√¥ among Visayans published in Vocabularias (dictionaries) of Spanish priests during the Spanish colonial period of the Philippines. Their authors often describe numerous variants varying by shape and weaving patterns, ranging from simple geometric shapes to complex shapes imitating objects or animals. But without illustrations, it is hard to imagine what they looked like, much less how they were made. Nevertheless, they give a glimpse of how complex the traditional pus√¥ were during the pre-Hispanic period, although some of these forms have now been lost. A pile of pus√¥ being sold in Cebu Fray Mateo S√°nchez, a Jesuit priest stationed in Dagami, Leyte, is the first to describe pus√¥ by name (as \\"poso\\") in his Vocabulario de la lengua Bisaya (1615‚Äì1617). He describes it as being made by women. He also lists fourteen types of pus√¥. They include tambong, which was flat and rectangular; binairan, brick-shaped like a whetstone; and bayobayo, which was cylindrical-shaped like a small pestle. He also describes others that are even more intricately shaped, like cumol sin datu, shaped like a clenched fist; linalaqui, shaped like male genitalia; binabaye, shaped like breasts; sinaop, shaped like two hands clasped together; tinicod, shaped like the heel of the foot; linangbay or linambay, shaped like a crab; binitoon, shaped like a star; bungÃÉan gapas, shaped like a kapok fruit; binabao or pinavican, shaped like a turtle shell; and ynamo or inamo, shaped like a monkey's head. Alonso de M√©ntrida in his Diccionario de la lengua Bisaya, Hiligueina y Haraya de la Isla de Panay (1618) describes six kinds of pus√¥ among the Cebuano, Ilonggo and Karay-a people of Panay. His list repeats some of those mentioned by S√°nchez. He includes poso nga linalaque, which he describes as \\"esquinado\\" (\\"angular\\"); poso nga pinaouican, shaped like a turtle; poso nga binouaya, shaped like a crocodile; poso nga ibaiba, shaped like an iba (rice basket or jar); poso nga galangan, shaped like galangan (star fruit); and poso nga paholan, shaped like the small piece of wood worn around the waist by fishermen to attach fishing lines on. Francisco Ignacio Alcina also described the Visayan \\"posos\\" in his Historia de las islas e indios de Bisayas (1668). He described them as a ritual offering during the pagabo or saragunting ritual, a paganito animistic ritual to the diwata (spirit) of the fireplace. He notes that once consecrated to the diwata spirits, the \\"posos\\" are left alone and never opened. Like S√°nchez, he describes different types of pus√¥, namely the linangang, woven with almost white coconut leaves in the shape of a small bird; and ginawig, woven into the shape of a large hen. Another ceremony that uses pus√¥ described by Alcina is the pagbutas, which was done after a burial ceremony of the dead. The relatives and friends of the deceased would weave a pus√¥ and tie them all together in a large plate of water. The daitan shaman would then cut each pus√¥ away while praying, signifying the separation of the living from the recently departed. Juan Jose Delgado, another Jesuit priest stationed in Guiguan (modern Guiuan), Samar, writes about taking pus√¥ with him on trips to the forest to cut wood in his Historia general, sacro-profana, politica y natural de las Islas del poniente llamadas Filipinas (1751). He praised the way it kept the rice fresh longer. He also mentions how the pus√¥ is cooked with meat inside in large cauldrons called baon. Though he does not name them, he also describes numerous variations of the weaving patterns, ranging from round, square, or rectangular-shaped. He also remarks upon the skill in weaving even among children who make the pouches, likening their creations to the Gordian knot. In the late 19th and early 20th century Vocabularias, there are only brief mentions of pus√¥. Juan F√©lix de la Encarnacion in 1885 describes pus√¥ as a kind of pouch filled with rice. Although he does also mention pinaoican and pinapagan as separate dishes. Antonio Sanchez de la Rosa in his Diccionario espa√±ol-bisaya para las provincias de S√°mar y Leyte (1914) lists pus√¥ under lambay and langbay, the modern Waray name for pus√¥ derived from the \\"crab\\" version that S√°nchez described three centuries earlier. He describes it as being a \\"bolsa de figura de corazon\\" (\\"heart-shaped pouch\\") used to cook rice or rice in coconut milk. Similar dishes Puso is related to similar dishes in other rice-farming Austronesian cultures, like the Indonesian and Malaysian ketupat, although the latter refers strictly to the diamond or triangular- shaped variants. Ketupat are also woven differently, the leaf base and the loose leaf strands do not exit at the same point, as in most Filipino puso. They are also popularly associated with Eid al-Fitr like the tamu of Muslim Filipinos. Ketupat somewhat resemble the tamu pinad version among Muslim Filipinos the most, which are shaped like a flattened diamond, although they are also woven differently. In Hindu Bali, a similar diamond-shaped variant called the ketipat or tipat is used as an offering to the rice goddess Dewi Sri. An octahedron-shaped version called atupat was also found in pre-colonial Guam, before the ancient rice cultivation in the island was replaced by corn brought by the Spanish.

It is the only species in the genus Dahlbominus. Description Dahlbominus fuscipennis has a dark coloured, blue tinged head, thorax and body. The head is noticeably wider than the thorax and there is a triangular depression in the centre of the frons. The vertex is narrow and the large eyes are naked. The antennae sit in from of the clypeus and have spindle-like, compressed flagellae, those of the male are branching. The forewing shows shading and the legs are dark. The long, oval abdomen lacks a distinct waist. The females are 1.8-1.9mm in length and the males are 1.4-1.8mm. Biology Dahlbominus fuscipennis has a number of generations in a year, in eastern Europe it normally has four generations but in cooler summers only three may occur and the last generation in August is usually the most numerous, although the generations overlap. The life cycle of this wasp is completed, under laboratory conditions, in 21‚Äì23 days. D. fuscipebnnis has a number of hosts, mainly sawflies of the family Diprionidae but it can also act as a hyperparasitoid on parasites of the eonymph of Ichneumonidae. In Canada only two full generations and a partial one are completed each summer with the wasps overwintering as fifth instar larvae, prepupae or pupae. The adult females of D. fuscipennis mate soon after emergence and oviposit their white, oval eggs in groups of 10-50, the mean clutch being 30, through the cocoon and onto the cuticle of the prepupal stage of their host insects. The female first partially parasitizes the host using its sting. An adult female lives for around a week and she may lay up to 100 eggs during her adult life. They normally choose hosts where the prepupae are of the newer generation but will lay on diapausing prepupae of the previous host generation. The sex ratio is usually dominated by females and males may form only one-fifth of the total population. The females are diploid and are produced by fertilised eggs while the males are haploid and are produced from unfertilised eggs. D. fuscipennis are poor fliers and search for their hosts by flying slowly through forested areas and find their prey cocoons on the surface layer of the soil and within the crowns of young trees with cocoons in the leaf litter having the highest rates of parasitism. The larvae hatch about 5 days after laying and go through five instars, each lasting a day or so, each differing in shape and morphology. The last instar becomes segmented, mainly yellow-brown in colour with a transparent anteriot portion. It feeds on the host for four days before entering a prepupal stage which lasts two to three days. In Europe larval development lasts 11 days in the summer months. The pupal stage then lasts between seven and twelve days before the adults emerge. The entire brood of imagos emerge from the host's cocoon through a single emergence hole. It has been recorded as being a parasitoid of Apanteles rubripes which is a parasitoid of the geometrid moth Semiothisa pumila and of the European spruce sawfly Gilpinia hercyniae. However, it is most associated with outbreaks of Neodiprion certifer and Diprion similis. In some areas this species is an important control on the populations of N. sertifer but in areas where both N. serifer and Neodiprion pini cocoons are numerous then the cocoons of the latter species are preferred. The wasps detect the hosts' prepupae by detecting volatile chemicals which diffuse through the prepupal integument and the cocoon. When the wasp detects these chemicals it drums its antennae, a sign that it has recognised a potential host. Distribution Dahlbominus fuscipennis is native to Europe from France to western Siberia (Novosibirsk), north to Scandinavia and south to the Balkans. It has been introduced to North America in the United States and Canada. Naming Dahlbominus fuscipennis was original named Eulophus fuscipennis by the Swedish naturalist Johan Wilhelm Zetterstedt in 1838, it was reclassified in a monotypic genus Dalbominus by Hincks in 1945. The name Dahlbominus honours the Swedish entomologist Anders Gustaf Dahlbom. Use as a Biological Control Organism The Canadian Department of Agriculture started to import Dahlbominus fuscipennis from Europe in 1933 to be propagated in an insectary with several hundred million of the progeny being released since then in an attempt to control invasive European species of sawflies. Between 1935 and 139 the Canadian's exported a large number of the wasps to the United States where they were also released to control invasive sawflies as well as being bred at the Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine, the Maine Forest Service and the New Jersey Department of Agriculture. The first US release was in Maine in 1935 and consisted of 30,000 adult wasps and by the end of 1939 over 200 million wasps had been liberated in Maine. The species is now established in north-eastern North America.

A full-scale wooden mockup was halfly produced, but the project was terminated in favor of FCM F1, a directly competing design, which proved to be superior design. The vehicle was meant to be extremely heavy and for that time period, very heavily armored. ARL C was intended to be very long to fill up the requirement of having a long tank that could cross trenches up to 7 meters wide. The tank was multi-turreted like FCM F1; however, unlike FCM F1, ARL C had the main turret in front of the very long hull right behind the secondary turret, not in the back of vehicle. The development path of the ARL C was extremely complex, due to the existence of a number of parallel super-heavy tank projects with overlapping design goals, the specifications of which were regularly changed. For each project in turn several companies submitted one or more competing proposals.  Second World War  ARL tracteur C 1940. Note the very long hull. In September 1938, the ARL company was granted a development contract for the char maximum, the first proposal for which was presented by ARL in May 1939. It had a proposed weight of 120 tons, consisted of two detachable modules, armor up to 120 mm thick and could be armed with either a gun or a flamethrower. The commission decided that only the guntank would be considered, however. In 1940, the specifications of ARL's tank, now named as \\"Tracteur C\\" to keep the project secrecy for outsiders, were changed: the tank was designed to have two turrets, 47 mm gun on front and on new larger turret, a 90 mm gun. ARL on 17 January 1940 ordered four turrets from the Schneider company, but it agreed only to build two 105 mm gun turrets and refused the two 90 mm gun turrets, as there was simply no capacity to manufacture them. In April 1940, after AMX's AMX Tracteur C programme was terminated, the subcommission advised to go ahead with both the FCM F1 and the ARL prototypes and immediately place an order for ten or fifteen of the former. That advice was given to a new overarching Commission of Tank Study, to which ARL presented a wooden mock-up on 11 April 1940; FCM presented one the next day. It transpired that the FCM project was far more advanced and could show the new tank in every detail. Due to this, the ARL's project was terminated. Only partially finished full-scale wooden mockup was produced. After Fall of France, in July 1940, the wooden mockup was captured by German forces. However, as the French super-heavy designs were absolutely unnecessary for the Wehrmacht, the mockup was soon dismantled and design documentation was apparently destroyed.

It was originally written by Mohamedou Ould Salahi, whom the United States held, without charge, for fourteen years. Salahi was one of the few individuals held in Guantanamo whom US officials acknowledged had been tortured. Journalist Larry Siems adapted the book from notes Salahi's lawyers were able to bring from Salahi. Each page had to be submitted to military censors. The memoir was published while Salahi was still being held, without charge. Many reviewers were surprised at how lacking in bitterness Salahi was since he had no ties to terrorism, and had been subjected to brutal torture. Movie producers bought an option on the rights to make a movie from the memoirs in June 2015. Producers Lloyd Levin and Michael Bronner had previously collaborated on the films United 93 and Green Zone. In 2016 a team of producers, including Benedict Cumberbatch, came on-board.

History and description The station had two platforms with a large stone building on one side and a wooden shelter on the other. The station had no footbridge, and passengers crossed via a level crossing. The station had a signal box, which is now preserved. Rhiwderin, like the other stations on this section of the line, was relatively successful in its early years, but as the road networks expanded after the 1940s, its profitability declined. The station proved an early casualty of the blow dealt to the local passenger stations in South Wales by bus services, closing to passengers in 1954 and to freight in 1959. After closure As of 2017, the line is still in a functional condition, and sees occasional traffic from Machen Quarry, but there is no longer a passenger station in the area. Rhiwderin station is now a private residence, though much of its original character has been retained. The station signal box was acquired in 1967 by the Caerphilly Railway Society. It is now preserved on the Teifi Valley Railway.

The first European settler to see the lake was Frederick Weld in 1853, who also named it. The headwaters of the Clarence River are just to the north, and the river flows through Lake Tennyson. History Frederick Weld, who first saw Lake Tennyson in 1853, in circa 1865 Lake Tennyson was discovered by Frederick Weld in 1853; Weld was the inaugural member of parliament for the electorate. The nearby Mount Weld is named for Weld, who climbed the mountain in March 1855. The reason for Weld exploring the area was his search for an overland route between Nelson and Canterbury for driving sheep. The lake is assumed to be named for the poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Weld described the lake as follows: Description Camping shelter at Lake Tennyson The small glacial lake is above sea level. A broad moraine with a number of tarns (i.e. mountain pools) forms the downstream side of the lake. There is a basic camp ground provided by the Department of Conservation next to the lake, free to use on a first come, first served basis. The lake's perimeter is approximately and can be walked, but wading in the lake is required in places. Location Lake Tennyson is located within the headwaters of the Clarence River; the river flows through the lake. Lake Tennyson is framed by the St James Range to the west, and the Crimea Range to the east. Lake Tennyson is part of Molesworth Station, New Zealand's largest farm. Access from Hanmer Springs () is on Clarence Valley Road via Jacks Pass, and then Tophouse Road along the Clarence River to the Maling Pass car park. The Clarence River is crossed via bridge at the car park and after a short drive on the Rainbow Road, the access road to the lake is signposted on the left. This route is suitable for two-wheel drives. The alternative access is from Saint Arnaud (). Just east of the township, the route turns right off State Highway 63 onto Rainbow Road (also known as Wairau‚ÄìHanmer Springs Hydro Road). This route follows the Wairau River to Island Saddle, which is New Zealand's highest legal road at . From there, it is to the turn off to Lake Tennyson. This road is suitable for four-wheel drives only, has seasonal access restrictions, and a toll applies that is payable at Rainbow Station. The Maling Pass car park in close proximity to Lake Tennyson is the most common start point for those who want to explore the St James Cycle Trail.

The film is a feature-length version of the 2016 short film of the same name.  Plot  In the early 20th century, the public becomes aware of people with superhuman abilities, known as Powers, resulting in the government passing a law requiring all Powers to register their abilities. They quickly become a key component of the economy, notably in constructing Lincoln City as the \\"City of Tomorrow.\\" As the Second Industrial Revolution begins, Powers are marginalized in the face of increasing mechanization, leading to severe prejudice as they become second- class citizens. By the 1990s, a crime syndicate known as The Trust has flooded the streets with an addictive drug called Psyke, made from the spinal fluid of desperate or trafficked Powers. Police departments begin using advanced drones, named Guardians, and facial recognition software to combat Power- related crime while a city-wide Powers ban is debated. Connor Reed, a 26-year- old Class 5 Electric (electrokinetic) looks after his mother Mary, a Cryo (cryokinetic), who has brain cancer that causes her abilities to sometimes act erratically. As Powers, they cannot afford the treatment she needs. Connor makes ends meet by working as an unregistered day laborer alongside many other Powers, using his abilities to install electrical wiring without protection. While on a job, the police arrive and order the workers to disband and a Pyro (pyrokinetic) is killed when attempting to flee arrest. Elsewhere in the city, a drug raid is conducted by detectives Park and Davis on an apartment complex owned by crime lord Marcus Sutcliffe, the local agent of The Trust and a Reader (telepath). Almost $1 million worth of product is seized, putting Sutcliffe in conflict with Wesley Cumbo, his superior in The Trust who demands their expected cut in a week's time. Reed is approached by Garrett, Sutcliffe's underling and a TK (telekinetic), and his crew for a job. Despite warnings from a fellow worker, Reed goes with them and participates in a chemical theft, shorting out the electric fence in an amazing show of power. Reed is introduced to Sutcliffe and meets Nia, Sutcliffe's supposed girlfriend. Park and Davis arrive on the scene the next day and determine that Sutcliffe is using the chemicals that were stolen to cut his remaining product, indicating he is desperate for revenue. Garrett recruits Reed, recognizing he has untapped potential, and agrees to help him earn enough money to get his mother treatment. He begins training Reed on how to use his abilities and uses him as an enforcer in the Psyke trade. Reed also grows close with the members of Garrett's crew, including Freddie, a mute Brawn (super strength), and Maddy, Garrett's girlfriend and a Pyro. Sutcliffe has the crew rob a bank in order to pay back The Trust, but the vault only contains $50,000. Cumbo's Shifter (shapeshifter) assassin Copperhead attempts to kill Sutcliffe for not honoring his debt, but Sutcliffe's bodyguard Rhino, a Brawn with bulletproof skin, manages to kill them. Reed is injured in the scuffle and Nia reveals that she is a Healer, and only remains with Sutcliffe to ease the effects of his Psyke addiction in order to pay a debt. Reed's mother confronts him about the stash of money he has been making working with the crew. She suddenly convulses and Reed rushes her to hospital, where the doctor tells him they will need to operate soon to remove her tumor. Park and Davis bring Reed in for questioning, encouraging him to cooperate as they have already confiscated much of the Psyke on the street, weakening Sutcliffe's influence. Davis advises they plant evidence in order to coerce Reed into informing, while Park is adamant that they cut him loose due to lack of evidence. Reed is released and goes to Garrett to suggest they raid the scheduled Psyke Run, the monthly transport of seized product for destruction, which will be worth approximately $10 million. Garrett and Reed bring the idea to Sutcliffe, where Reed demands Nia heal his mother as payment and Garrett stipulates he will become a partner in running the Psyke trade. On the day of the heist, the crew blocks the truck while it is inside a no-fly zone, preventing back-up by drones that carry Guardians. Reed shorts out the truck's electronics and they manage to destroy the Guardians. As Maddy hands off the Psyke to Rhino, Sutcliffe's men execute the officers protecting the truck and turn on the crew, killing Maddy and mortally wounding Freddie before he, Garrett and Reed manage to escape. Rhino flees with the drugs while the drone pilot disregards the no-fly zone and drops additional Guardians into the area, killing the rest of Sutcliffe's men. Freddie dies as Reed and Garrett drive away. Reed tells Garrett that Sutcliffe betrayed them because of Garrett's demands, and they part ways. Davis and Park's captain is furious that Reed was not arrested before the heist, and demands they bring in those responsible. Park visits his daughter, a TK Power, who is afraid she will be given away because she is struggling to control her abilities. Reed contacts Park and offers up Sutcliffe's hideout. The cops raid Suttcliffe's hideout while Reed and Garrett seek revenge at his escape route. After killing Rhino and Sutcliffe, Garrett takes the Psyke for himself and encourages Reed to force Nia to heal his mother. Nia pleads with Reed to let her go, as her abilities do not just heal people, but force her to take the injury or disease onto herself, meaning she can die if she attempts to heal his mother. Reed takes Nia to the hospital at gunpoint, but finally tells her to stop after he sees how painful the process is for her. Reed shares a tearful goodbye with his mother before she dies. Reed drives to the police station and gives Nia his truck in order to leave the city. He decides to turn himself in to try and make up for his mistakes. Garrett hands over the Psyke to Cumbo and takes over the drug trade for The Trust in Lincoln City. Reed visits his mother's grave before he serves his sentence, while Nia has a tearful visit with her father in prison, whose debt she was paying off with Sutcliffe. Meanwhile, the Powers Ban is being voted on due to the heist while Park reluctantly accepts an award for the raid against Sutcliffe.

The animation team: Sanyukta Shrestha, Anjana Shrestha, Niyukta Shrestha, supported by Bigyan Prajapati and Prajnal Kakshepati. The Legend of Shankhadhar showcases the story about Nepalese hero Sankhadhar Saakhwa and how he had started the Nepal Sambat. This movie features the relation between Nepal's cities Kathmandu and Bhaktapur. It also features Nepal's devastating earthquake of April 2015 Nepal. The Legend of Shankhadhar first premiered in United Kingdom, London at Greenford Town Hall, brought by Yantrakala studios. After the success of the premier, Yantrakala studios have ventured on a worldwide screening in different cites around the Globe.  Plot  Shankhadhar catches sight of the porters and is surprised to see the two excavating sand from the river early in the morning. He encounters them again, while they are resting at a sattal‚Äîtheir kharpans stacked with sand lying next to them. When Shankhadhar inquires into where they are hauling the sand to, they inform him of their destination: Bhaktapur. Intrigued further, Shankhadhar invites them to his home and coaxes them to leave the sand there and to excavate another batch from the river to take to Bhaktapur, which they willingly do. A woman in Kathmandu who is unable to pay off a merchant‚Äôs debt. As a result, she is publicly humiliated on the streets privy to all. This sight weighs heavy on Shankhadhar‚Äôs mind and is seared into his memory. Meanwhile, in Bhaktapur, a famed astrologer, Siddhiwant Joshi, predicts that the sand brought from the Bishnumati River, at an auspicious time he has picked out, will turn into gold. Taking his advice, the king of Bhaktapur commands two porters to travel to Kathmandu to bring the sand as prescribed, but keeps its purpose a secret. In one of those sites, a child asks a mother if everything the earthquake destroyed can be rebuilt. The mother then recants the story of Shankhadhar who did the seemingly impossible some 1137 years ago.

After the first bombing raid on Darwin in 1942, special units consisting of Indigenous Australians were formed, one of which was the Snake Bay Patrol. \\"1942, June 18 Aboriginal patrols organised along the northern and western coasts of Australia\\" The Snake Bay Patrol unit was established by Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve officer Lieutenant J.W.B. Gribble during the Pacific War to detect any Japanese forces which landed on the island, with local Indigenous Australians being informally recruited and never formally enlisted into the military. The Patrol's 35 members served on a full-time basis, received firearms training, were issued naval uniforms and held naval ranks conferred by Gribble, but were not paid. Similar units were raised on Bathurst Island, the Cox Peninsula and Groote Eylandt. During the war the Snake Bay Patrol conducted patrols along the shore of Melville Island, rescued downed Allied airmen and determined the location of naval mines. Two members of the Patrol are also believed to have formed part of reconnaissance parties landed on Timor from Allied submarines. The former members of the Snake Island Patrol only became eligible for service medals and payments in recognition of their service in 1962. In December 1991 the few surviving members of the Patrol and the other auxiliary Indigenous units received compensation for not having been paid during the war, as well as the Defence Medal and War Medal; these were also provided to the next of kin of the members who had died by that time. The next year the surviving men became eligible for veteran's benefits under the Veterans‚Äô Entitlements Act 1986.

The bourgeois of the town defeated the army of knights of the Bishop of Strasbourg, Walter of Geroldseck. Context The relations between the Strasbourgers with their bishop, already strained, took a bad turn in 1260. As soon as he was installed on the episcopal throne, Walter of Geroldseck launched a manifesto of grievances against the citizens, stating his intention to re-establish, in all their rigor, his temporal rights as Count-Burgrave of Strasbourg. To do so, he threatened to use all the means of constraint conferred on him by his episcopal authority, foremost among which were prohibition and excommunication. Incidents between the bishop and the city multiplied and a test of force became inescapable. Preparations for war The bishop asked for reinforcements: 1,500 men from the Bishop of Trier, but also from the men sent by the abbots of St. Gall, Murbach, and above all Count Rudolf of Habsburg. He made a demonstration of strength in front of the city, which turned to his disadvantage. He then chose to put Strasbourg under blockade. The Strasbourgers tried in vain to break this blockade. 1261 proved a turning point. During a truce for the harvest, Rudolf of Habsburg changed sides and joined the city. The Strasbourgers proclaimed him the gonfalonnier of their army on 18 September 1261. At Christmas 1261, a sortie by the Strasbourgers with their new ally in the direction of Dachstein did not resolve the conflict, the bishop hesitating to clash with Rudolf. He avenged himself by plundering the possessions of Rudolf in Upper Alsace. The battle In the spring of 1262, Alsace was a scene of much violence and destruction. Things came to a head on 8 March 1262. Half of the Strasbourg garrison, led by Reimbold Liebenzeller, went to Mundolsheim, at the northern end of the Hausbergen hill, to knock down the bell tower which was feared to be a lookout for the blockade established by the bishop. The bishop, based at Molsheim, was warned and set out with his army of 300 knights and 5,000 infantrymen. Sighting the enemy approaching, Liebenzeller sent messengers to Strasbourg to call for help. He then climbed the hill of Hausbergen and awaited the troops, led by his colleague Nicolaus Zorn. When Zorn arrived, the combined force fell back toward the village of Oberhausbergen. The bishop, observing this, thought the army was trying to return to Strasbourg. Thinking to crush them with his cavalry before they escaped, he led his horsemen in a rapid advance, leaving his infantry to catch up as best they could. The Strasbourgers were not in flight, however, and deployed to face the bishop's men in good order.Delbr√ºck (1990), p. 370. The battle began with a challenge to single combat by the knight Marcus of Eckwersheim from the army of Strasbourg. This was accepted by a knight called Beckelar of the episcopal army. Both parties were unhorsed but Eckwersheim was rescued by his comrades and Beckelar was killed. Immediately after this, the cavalry of the two sides clashed. The outnumbered Strasbourgers were having the worst of the struggle when Liebenzeller led forward the militia, armed with spears and Danish axes.Delbr√ºck (1990), p. 372. These were ordered to attack the horses of the knights. Meanwhile, Zorn had led the 300 crossbowmen out to the flank of the fight to engage the bishop's advancing infantry and prevent them interfering in the fight with the knights.Bachrach & Bachrach (2017), p. 290. Such was the shooting of the bowmen that the infantry declined to advance further. Their cavalry was overwhelmed. Sixty knights were killed and another 73 captured.Delbr√ºck (1990), p. 371. The bishop was engaged in the struggle, having two horses killed under him before fleeing the field on a third. The bishop's brother, Hermann, lay among the dead. The bishop retired to Molsheim, abandoning his prerogatives over the city. He died in February 1263. Consequences Peace was concluded between the city and the new bishop, Henry of Geroldseck, cousin of the deceased Walter, confirmed on 21 April 1263 the complete independence of the Council. The past and future ducal pretensions of the Bishop of Strasbourg were declared null and inadmissible. Strasbourg was a free city of the Holy Roman Empire and its future was entrusted to its Council. In addition, the management of the Notre-Dame Cathedral was taken from the bishop and entrusted to the cathedral chapter.  Commemoration  The 750th anniversary of the battle was celebrated in 2012. A comic album was published about the event and a seminar was organised by the University of Strasbourg.

He enjoyed international appreciation as a peace activist. Ulburghs worked in the tradition of nineteenth-century priests who committed their religious commitment to the social struggle of the poor and lower social classes. Ulburghs worked in social work in the seventies. Early life Jef Ulburghs was raised in a middle class farming family. He was the youngest of six children and grew up in Zolder.

In 1962, he was appointed as Almoner of the social work in Seraing, the secretariat of which was located near the entrance of Cockerill-Sambre. Ulburghs founded a folk high school college for workers and, in the meanwhile, studied political and social sciences at the Leuven University. = Work in Limburg = After the founding of the new Roman Catholic Diocese of Hasselt, Bishop Heusschen Ulburghs returned to Limburg and became Secretary of the Pastoral Council and Chairman of the Commission Justice and Peace. He founded the Community & Development in 1969, following a concept of the Walloon Communaut√© et D√©veloppement, founded in 1968 in Li√®ge. It saw people's development as one of the ways to liberation . The name World Schools originated after 1970 when the emphasis was placed on the formation of militants on the one hand and the possibility for workers of workers to obtain a university degree on the other hand (in 1973, the University of Labor would originate). In theory, World Schools for Education and Community and Development for the Action were different, but in practice, they both ran together In the early 1970s, Ulburghs was on the barricades during the big miners' strike. His presence between the strikers at the factory gates brought him into collision with his church rulers and the ACV. The conflict was resolved with a postponement in Zwartberg. During that period, Jef Ulburghs was also literally on the barricades against the construction of the A-24 (now North-South) motorway in Limburg In 1971, Ulburghs went to the UNCTAD Conference in Santiago, Chile. There he held a hunger strike. In 1974, World Schools merged with the Center for Formation and Action (CVA), originated from the torn left-wing Young Davids Fund. World Schools took on the adult activity and CVA's youth work. The name Community and Development disappeared. During the only Congress of World Schools in 1975, the original option of a formation movement was redefined as democratic basic socialism . From 1975 onwards, national operations were influenced by local operations or base groups, and national actions were seldom organised. This translated into local forms of education (around the Third World, guest workers, city issues, women's emancipation, alcoholism, peace building, etc.), neighbourhood work, health care, workers' work and education, world shops. Only in Limburg, the movement also reached the villages, elsewhere they restricted themselves to one or two cities. In 1975, Ulburghs started working as a priest neighbourhood worker in Genk‚ÄìZwartberg. He continued his basic work. Thus he found in Genk and other former mining towns in Limburg the basis of neighbourhood and tenant syndicates.  Political career (1982‚Äì1995)  Supported and fully encouraged by his growing number of supporters, Ulburghs decided to actively pursue politics in the early 1980s. He was chosen as an independent candidate on the SP List. He served on the city council of Genk (1982‚Äì1989), where he drew attention to the problems of the miners' neighbourhoods. He often challenged Mayor Louis Gaethofs, but earned the respect of local residents whose problems he put on the table.Wij waren 'rooie studenten', en jij was een pastoor', Afscheidsbrief van Dr. Harrie Dewitte aan Jef Ulburghs, Harrie Dewitte, nieuwsblad.be He supported the Workers' Party of Belgium. He protested arm in arm, in the first row, along with hundreds of patients against some 60 police officers with a water cannon when the doorman, in charge of the Order of Physicians, wanted to charge the furniture in 1984. He gained his seat and became legislature member of the European Parliament (1984‚Äì1989). In 1986 he joined the first row, with the miners from Waterschei to Winterslag. He formed the strike leadership together with miners Luc Cieters, Jan Grouwels, Antonio Venturo, Antonio De Simone, Franco Mirisola and Harrie Dewitte. After his election to the European Parliament, he was no longer on the SP list. From January 1992 to the end of 1994, Ulburghs concurrently served as a member of the Flemish Parliament. In 1995 he retired from active politics. Later life Jef Ulburghs honored by Walloon miners. In 2002, Ulburghs eightieth birthday was celebrated in the former mine of Zolder.

Lozovsky served in the Red Army from the mid-1920s, initially serving as a junior officer and fighting in the Sino-Soviet conflict in 1929. He became an armor officer in the 1930s and served at the Battles of Khalkhin Gol. After the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, on 22 June 1941, Lozovsky became chief of staff of a tank division before becoming chief of staff of the 15th Tank Corps in mid-1942. After the corps commander was killed in the Third Battle of Kharkov, Lozovsky temporarily took command of the corps. He continued to serve as chief of staff of the unit when it became the 7th Guards Tank Corps, and transferred to the same position with the 10th Guards Tank Corps in 1944. Postwar, he served as a department head in the Main Personnel Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of the Soviet Union.  Early life and interwar military career  Lozovsky was born on 23 September 1907 in the village of Goloenishchevo, Smolensk Governorate. He was drafted into the Red Army on 14 September 1925, and was sent to study at the Western Military District Military-Political Academy, but was transferred to the Unified Military School named for the Central Executive Committee in Moscow in October 1926, where he became a section leader in September 1927. Upon graduation in September 1928, Lozovsky was sent to the 1st Pacific Rifle Division's 1st Chita Rifle Regiment, stationed in the Soviet Far East with the Special Red Banner Far Eastern Army, where he served as a platoon commander. From July 1929 to January 1930, he participated in the Sino-Soviet conflict over control of the Chinese Eastern Railway. In July, he became an assistant company commander for technical affairs. In November 1930, Lozovsky was sent to study at the Leningrad Armored Refresher Courses for Red Army commanders. After completing the course, he became a company commander of the 1st Separate Tank Battalion in the Ukrainian Military District. Transferred to the Far East in February 1934, Lozovsky became the assistant chief of the 2nd Mechanized Brigade's operations staff department. In November, he entered the Military Academy of Mechanization and Motorization of the Red Army, graduating in June 1939. Lozovsky then returned to the Far East, where he was appointed assistant chief of staff of the 9th Armored Motor Brigade, fighting in the Battles of Khalkhin Gol as part of the 1st Army Group.  World War II  In July 1941, Lozovsky became chief of staff of the newly formed 111th Tank Division, part of the Transbaikal Military District, which became the Transbaikal Front in September. He subsequently took accelerated courses at the Higher Military Academy and in June 1942 became chief of the operations department of the newly formed 15th Tank Corps. In July, Lozovsky became the corps' chief of staff, fighting in the Ostrogozhsk‚ÄìRossosh Offensive, Operation Star, and the Third Battle of Kharkov between January and March 1943. During Operation Star, the corps suffered heavy losses in personnel and equipment and shifted to the defense after a German counterattack began the Third Battle of Kharkov. The German counterattack cut off the corps from main forces in the Sokolovo area, and it was ordered to break out through Novaya Vodolaga. After corps commander Major General Vasily Koptsov died on 3 March, Lozovsky took command of the corps and led the breakout in the area of Zmiiv. Lozovsky supervised the rebuilding of the corps during the next months, while simultaneously being both corps commander and chief of staff. On 11 June, Major General Filipp Rudkin arrived to take command of the corps, and Lozovsky reverted to being the chief of staff. In July, the corps fought in Operation Kutuzov, the Soviet counteroffensive after the Battle of Kursk. During the fighting, Lozovsky was wounded but continued to perform his duties and was awarded the Order of Kutuzov 2nd class for \\"efficient organization, skilled command of the unit, and fulfillment of combat missions\\". At the end of the month, the corps was converted into the 7th Guards Tank Corps for its actions. He continued to serve as chief of staff of the corps during the Battle of the Dnieper and the Battle of Kiev. On 18 February 1944, Lozovsky transferred to become chief of staff of the 10th Guards Tank Corps. With the 10th Guards Corps, he fought in the Proskurov-Chernivtsi Offensive, the Lvov‚ÄìSandomierz Offensive, the Lower Silesian Offensive, the Upper Silesian Offensive, the Berlin Offensive, and the Prague Offensive.  Postwar  On 27 June 1945, Lozovsky was promoted to major general, and on 22 May 1946, he became head of the personnel section of the Armored and Mechanized Forces of the Ground Forces Main Personnel Directorate. He became head of the directorate's Directorate of Personnel Service's 3rd Department on 15 July 1947. On 14 April 1949, Lozovsky became the directorate's head of inspection, and from 15 April 1950 was at the disposal of the directorate.

History The Aces High March was originally entitled Luftwaffe March from the Battle of Britain. In the USA, the title of the composition was Aces High. The music is published by Faber Music. =Setting in the film= In the film, the music is played during the opening sequence with fifty Heinkel aircraft, which were actually aircraft built by Spain's CASA. These aircraft had been flying in Spain's air force until 1968. These Spanish bomber aircraft also had Rolls- Royce Merlin engines; the aircraft during the war had Daimler-Benz engines. The aircraft had been obtained by Group Captain T.G. 'Hamish' Mahaddie. The famous opening sequence of the film was shot in March 1968 at Tablada Aerodrome (Seville Airport) in Andalusia, southern Spain. The film was produced by United Artists. There is a scene showing the deserted British Army vehicles at Dunkirk (Operation Dynamo), and a BBC Radio news broadcast (on 18 June 1940) announces In the House of Commons this afternoon the Prime Minister Mr Churchill said - What General Weygand called the Battle of France is over.

He was the first Ismaili Dai in India after the shift of Daawat office from Yemen to India. He succeeded the 24th Dai Syedna Yusuf Najmuddin ibn Sulaiman to the religious post. Life Syedna Jalal acquired elementary education from Maulaya Qasim bin Maulaya Hasan. He then traveled to Yemen to seek knowledge from the 23rd and the 24th Dai and studied under Syedi Hasan bin Nooh. After arriving in back to his hometown, Ahmadabad, Syedna Jalal bought a piece of land in Saranpur (a suburb of Ahmadabad) with his personal funds so that a structure could be built that would accommodate a gathering of all followers. He collected all his savings from various businesses to cover the building expenses, but the funds were not sufficient - his personal funds only covered half the expenditure. He was in charge of affairs in India, and had access to funds in treasury. He felt that it was better to draw from it only after obtaining the blessings of Syedna Yusuf. The construction was halted for half a month until Maamji, son of Shaykh Mujaal learned of the stalled work, took it upon himself to manage and finance the project to completion. Syedna Jalal became Da'i al-Mutlaq in 974 AH /1567 AD. His period of Da'awat was from 974-975 AH/ 1567-1568 AD (<1 Years). Before the appointment of Dai, he was last Wali ul Hind in India working for the movement. Syedna Jalal Shamshuddin appointed or gave nass to Syedna Dawood Bin Ajabshah.

(See Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare on Tallahassee's other hospitals of the period.) There was no other such institution within of Tallahassee. In 1940, \\"less than a dozen\\" counties in Florida had hospital facilities for Negroes. Founding The hospital was originally designated a sanitarium, had 19 beds, and was created to allow Florida A&M; University (FAMU) to establish a nursing program. It was housed in a wooden building located slightly NW of the brick building, with 105 beds, which replaced it in 1950. Funding to build the hospital was provided in part to avoid integration at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital, by creating a \\"separate but equal\\" facility. (See Gibbs Junior College for other such efforts in Florida.) It was officially dedicated as a hospital in 1951, although since 1946 it was named the FAMC Hospital, Health Center and Nursing School. Like most hospitals serving African Americans, it was chronically underfunded; Tallahassee levied a tax on residents to support the whites-only hospital, but refused to distribute any of the funds to the FAMU hospital, whose patients were almost exclusively African Americans.  Closure The hospital closed as a result of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the federal government's threat to withhold Medicare funding from both the FAMU hospital and Tallahassee Memorial Hospital if racial segregation continued. Tallahassee Memorial started admitting black patients, and federal and state funding which previously supported the FAMU Hospital was transferred to Tallahassee Memorial. When state funding was ended in 1967, the name was changed to Tallahassee A&M; Hospital and it was leased to the city and county from 1967 to 1970, renewed for 1970-72. On December 24, 1971, citing unsustainable losses, the Hospital Board announced that it was closing down the hospital, which at that time had three patients housed there. FAMU President Dr. B. L. Perry, Jr., cited \\"the unwillingness of white doctors to commit patients to it. Concurrent with this problem was the unavailability of black doctors in this community\\". He also cited the low salary for nurses, which did not meet the requirements of the minimum wage and hour law and did not attract applicants. As was typical of racial desegregation in the U.S., it was the black facility that closed, and the employees lost their jobs. Two identical historical markers commemorating the hospital were erected in 2013. One is in front of the former hospital building. The other, at an entrance to the campus, is on the SW corner of the intersection of Palmer Avenue and South Adams Street.

Chemical Reviews 117 : 10940‚Äì11024. doi:10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00807.  History  Solar cells started in 1876 with William Grylls Adams along with an undergraduate student of his. A French scientist, by the name of Edmond Becquerel, first discovered the photovoltaic effect in the summer of 1839. He theorized that certain elements on the periodic table, such as silicon, reacted to the exposure of sunlight in very unusual ways. Solar power is created when solar radiation is converted to heat or electricity. English electrical engineer Willoughby Smith, between 1873 and 1876, discovered that when selenium is exposed to light, it produced a high amount of electricity. The use of selenium was highly inefficient, but it proved Becquerel's theory that light could be converted into electricity through the use of various semi-metals on the periodic table, that were later labelled as photo-conductive material. By 1953, Calvin Fuller, Gerald Pearson, and Daryl Chapin discovered the use of silicon to produce solar cells was extremely efficient and produced a net charge that far exceeded that of selenium. Today solar power has many uses, from heating, electrical production, thermal processes, water treatment and storage of power that is highly prevalent in the world of renewable energy.  Background  By the 1960s solar power was the standard for powering space- bound satellites. In the early 1970s, solar cell technology became cheaper and more available ($20/watt). Between 1970 and 1990, solar power became more commercially operated. Railroad crossings, oil rigs, space stations, microwave towers, aircraft, etc. Now, houses and businesses all over the world use solar cells to power electrical devices with a wide variety of uses. Solar power is the dominant technology in the renewable energy field, primarily due to its high efficiency and cost-effectiveness. By the early 1990s, photovoltaic conversion had reached an unprecedented new height. Scientists used solar cells constructed of highly conductive photovoltaic materials such as gallium, indium, phosphide and gallium arsenide that increased total efficiency by over 30%. By the end of the century, scientists created a special type of solar cells that converted upwards of 36% of the sunlight it collected into usable energy. These developments built tremendous momentum for not only solar power, but for renewable energy technologies around the world.  Electricity production  Diagram of the setup of a photovoltaic collection array. Photovoltaics (PV) use silicon solar cells to convert the energy of sunlight into electricity. Operates under the photoelectric effect which results in the emission of electrons. Concentrated solar power (CSP) Uses lenses or mirrors and tracking devices to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Solar power is anticipated to be the world's largest source of electricity by 2050. Solar power plants, such as Ivanpah Solar Power Facility in the Mojave Desert produces over 392MW of power. Solar projects exceeding 1 GW (1 billion watts) are in development and are anticipated to be the future of solar power in the US.  Thermal energy  The heat collected by the sun is highly intensive and radioactive. The sun bombards the earth with billions of charged nanoparticles with an immense amount of energy stored in them. This heat can be used for water heating, space heating, space cooling and process heat generation. Many steam generation systems have adapted to using sunlight as a primary source for heating feed water, a development that has greatly increased the overall efficiency of boilers and many other types of waste heat recovery systems. Solar cookers use sunlight for cooking, drying and pasteurization. Solar distillation is used for water treatment processes to create potable drinking water, which has been an extremely powerful player in providing countries in need with relief efforts through the use of advancing technology.  Economic development  Solar energy conversion has the potential to be a very cost-effective technology.it is cheaper as compared to non-conventional energy sources. the uses of solar energy help to increase employment and development of the transportation & agriculture sector. Solar installations are becoming cheaper and more readily available to countries where energy demand is high, but supply is low due to economic circumstances. A 1 GW solar power plant can produce almost 10 times as much power as a fossil fuel combustion power plant that would cost twice as much to establish. Solar power plants have been projected to be the leader of the energy production by the year 2050. = Rural energy access = Solar energy conversion has the potential for many positive social impacts, especially in rural areas that did not previously have grid-based energy access. In many off-grid areas, the solar-electric conversion is the fastest growing form of energy procurement. This is especially true at latitudes within 45¬∞ north or south of the Equator, where solar irradiance is more constant throughout the year and where the bulk of the developing world's population lives. From a health perspective, solar home systems can replace kerosene lamps (frequently found in rural areas), which can cause fires and emit pollutants like carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxides (NOx), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) that adversely affect air quality and can cause impair lung function and increase tuberculosis, asthma, and cancer risks. In such areas, solar energy access has been shown to save rural residents the time and money needed to purchase and transport kerosene, thereby increasing productivity and lengthening business hours. In addition to energy access, these communities gain energy independence, meaning they are not reliant on a third-party electricity provider. The concept of energy independence is relatively new; for the vast majority of the 20th century, energy analyses were purely technical or financial and did not include social impact analysis. A 1980 study concluded that access to renewable energy would promote values conducive to larger societal benefit as opposed to personal promotion. While some academics argue that historically the parties in control of energy sources are those that create social hierarchies, this type of analysis became less ‚Äúradical‚Äù and more mainstream after the introduction of technologies that enabled solar energy conversion. = Community solar = Solar energy conversion can impact not only just individual customers but whole communities. In a growing number of neighborhoods across America, the conventional model of independent, non-connected rooftop installations is being replaced by community-sized solar microgrids. The idea of ‚Äúcommunity solar‚Äù first became popular because of issues regarding energy storage. Because as of 2018 the wide-scale production of lithium-ion battery and other storage technologies lags the progress of rooftop PV installations, a main issue preventing a nationwide shift to rooftop solar energy generation is the lack of a reliable, single-home storage system that would provide contingencies for night-time energy use, cloud cover, curtailments and blackouts. Additionally, financing solar installations for single homes may be more difficult to secure given a smaller project scope and lack of access to funds. A viable alternative is to connect blocks of homes together in a community microgrid, using more proven large storage installations, thus lowering barriers to solar adoption. In some cases, a microgrid ‚Äúweb‚Äù is made by connecting each independent rooftop PV house to a greater storage facility. Other designs, primarily where rooftop installations are not possible, feature a large combined solar array + storage facility located on an adjacent field. As an added social impact, this form of installation makes solar energy economically viable for multi-family homes and historically low income neighborhoods. = Grid defection = A potential socioeconomic drawback associated with solar energy conversion is a disruption to the electric utility business model. In America, the economic viability of regional ‚Äúmonopoly‚Äù utilities is based on the large aggregation of local customers who balance out each other's variable load. Therefore, the widespread installation of rooftop solar systems that are not connected to the grid poses a threat to the stability of the utility market. This phenomenon is known as Grid Defection. The pressure on electric utilities is exacerbated by an aging grid infrastructure that has yet to adapt to the new challenges posed by renewable energy (mainly regarding inertia, reverse power flow and relay protection schemes). However, some analysts make the case that with the steady increase in natural disasters (which destroy vital grid infrastructure), solar microgrid installation may be necessary to ensure emergency energy access. This emphasis on contingency preparation has expanded the off-grid energy market dramatically in recent years, especially in areas prone to natural disasters.  Environmental impact  Installations can destroy and/or relocate ecological habitats by covering large tracts of land and promoting habitat fragmentation. Solar facilities constructed on Native American reservations have interrupted traditional practices and have also had negative impact on the local ecosphere.

He began work at the company in 1954, and as managing director from 1974 to 1984 oversaw its transition from a farmers' cooperative to a publicly listed industrial conglomerate. Early life Bennison was born in Mandalay, Burma, to Arthur and Doris Bennison. He lived in Burma until he was a teenager, when he was sent to Perth, Western Australia, to board at Hale School. Bennison completed his secondary education in 1941, and then went on to Perth Technical College. In 1943, however, he enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). He trained as a pilot at the No. 4 Service Flying Training School in Geraldton, and during the war flew Avro Lancasters. At his discharge in 1946, he held the rank of flying officer.RAAF WW2 Nominal Roll Business career After the war's end, Bennison and his new wife initially settled in Armidale, New South Wales, where he studied agriculture at the New England University College. They later moved to Melbourne, where he got a job with Wrigley's, the chewing gum manufacturer. In 1953, Bennison returned to Perth to work for Kraft.Former Wesfarmers visionary dies aged 92, The West Australian, 8 May 2017. =Wesfarmers= In 1954, at the suggestion of his father-in-law, Bennison placed an advertisement in The West Australian offering his services to \\"any suitable employer\\". Keith Edwards, the assistant general manager of Wesfarmers, saw his notice, and after a brief interview offered him a job as a \\"one-man budgetary control department\\". Bennison's contributions impressed the company's management, and in 1958 he was put in charge of the company's new Kleenheat Gas division. In that capacity, he helped negotiate a partnership with Air Liquide.Innate business sense, The West Australian, 26 May 2017. After heading up Kleenheat, Bennison spent periods as head of the industrials division and as assistant general manager.Bennison had steely conviction, Farm Weekly, 16 May 2017. On 1 January 1974, he succeeded Keith Edwards, the man who had first hired him, as Wesfarmers' general manager. Bennison was only the fourth chief executive since the company's foundation in 1917. When he took over, Wesfarmers was still organised along the lines of a farmers' cooperative. It had highly diversified interests, but had weak cash flows and lacked the capital reserves needed for growth.The man who made Wesfarmers, The West Australian, 2 March 2014. In 1977, Bennison had Wesfarmers make a takeover bid for CSBP, a large fertiliser company. When the sale finally went through in 1979, it was the largest corporate takeover in Australian history. CSBP was sold for $60 million, which was three times the official value of Wesfarmers itself. According to Bennison, \\"They had great cash flow and we were shrinking. That was the crux of it. The combination of CSBP and Wesfarmers was magic. You had something you never had ‚Äì money around the clock\\". In the last years of tenure, Bennison determined that it was in Wesfarmers' best interests to float as a public company. He met strong opposition from the board of directors, but eventually had his way, and an initial public offering was made in November 1984. Bennison retired five months earlier, in June 1984, and was replaced by Trevor Eastwood, whom he had hired as a cadet engineer in 1963. He was also responsible for hiring Eastwood's successor, Michael Chaney.Lesson helped build Wesfarmers empire, The West Australian, 19 February 2017. Personal life During the war, Bennison met Joyce Brearley, the daughter of the famous aviation pioneer Sir Norman Brearley. The two were married in 1946, and had four children together. Bennison enjoyed trout fishing, and had a collection of vintage cars. He was keenly interested in art, and initiated the Wesfarmers Collection, which is now one of the largest private collections of Australian art. Bennison was created an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1981, for \\"service to primary industry\\", and was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in 2008, for \\"service to business, particularly in the primary industry sector through the promotion and development of commercial opportunities for farmers, and to the arts\\".It's An Honour: References 1924 births 2017 deaths Australian chief executives Australian Officers of the Order of the British Empire Australian World War II pilots Burmese emigrants to Australia Members of the Order of Australia People educated at Hale School People from Mandalay Royal Australian Air Force personnel of World War II Wesfarmers people ","title":"John Bennison"},{"id":"54269813","text":"The Movement for Economic Change (MEC) is a political party in Lesotho.

Daughter of the celebrated Danish ballet master, August Bournonville, she first sang in Stockholm in 1857 before joining the Royal Danish Theatre in Copenhagen two years later. She is also remembered for giving singing lessons to the daughters of King Christian IX. In appreciation of her services, the king elevated her to the status of Kongelig Kammersanger (Royal Chamber Singer) in 1863. Biography Born on 29 November 1832 in Copenhagen, Charlotte Bournonville was the daughter of August Bournonville and Helena Fredrika H√•kansson. She received singing lessons from Carl Helsted in Copenhagen, Arlet in Vienna and Giovanni Battista Lamperti in Milan. In early 1857, she appeared in concerts in Paris before being engaged by the Royal Theatre in Stockholm in July where she appeared in several concerts and played Fides in Meyerbeer's opera Profeten. She performed in Hamburg and Frankfurt in the winter of 1858-59. She then settled in Copenhagen where she was engaged by the Royal Danish Theatre, receiving a permanent appointment until 1884. There she first appeared in Vaudeville operettas before taking mezzo-soprano parts in opera. Her roles included Azucena in Il trovatore, Diana in Les diamants de la couronne, Mme Bertrand in Le ma√ßon, fru Ragnhild in Ivar Hallstr√∂m's Den bergtagna, Marthe in Faust and Marguerite in La dame blanche. Although she performed well, Bournonville was rivalled by the mezzo-soprano Josephine Zinck whose good looks she lacked, causing her to appear increasingly less frequently. She finally retired from the theatre in 1884. Charlotte Bournonville died in Copenhagen on 22 March 1911. She is buried in Asminder√∏d Churchyard near Fredensborg.

The show traces the epic story of Goddess Parvati‚Äôs metamorphosis into Mahakali. Produced by Siddharth Kumar Tewary's Swastik Productions, it starred Pooja Sharma in the titular role of Goddess Mahakali. Plot The show's plot revolves around the much-adored tale of Goddess Parvati, the wife of Lord Shiva (sister of Lord Vishnu) and her alter-ego, Mahakali. Adi-Shakti, the supreme Goddess of the Universe (according to the Shakta faith) creates Brahma ‚Äì the progenitor, Vishnu ‚Äì the protector and Shiva ‚Äì the destroyer, and their female counterparts. According to her promise to Shiva, who expressed his love to her, she takes multiple births on earth to woo and wed Him. He is entrusted with the duty of transforming the earthly incarnations of the Goddess into Mahakali but failed 107 times (of which 107th birth was of Sati). So, Adi-Shakti finally incarnates as the princess of the Himalayas and is renowned as Parvati. With her strong will and intense devotion, Parvati becomes the wife of Shiva. However, their after marriage is threatened when the demon king Shumbha (along with his brother Nishumbha) expresses his desire to marry Parvati and wages war against Shiva. So, in an attempt to protect all those who have taken up refuge in her home at Mount Kailash, Parvati rushes into the war, successfully channeling Goddess Mahakali, her untamed warrior side through her unbound rage. She also gave confidence to other Devi's including Devi Lakshmi & Devi Saraswati & made them as warriors. Mahakali is able to overthrow Shumbha's tyrannical rule and destroy all his associates (including famed demons like Mahishasura, Bhandasura, Tarakasura, Nishumbha, Raktabija and Chanda-Munda) in the process. In years following her triumph, Shiva and Parvati expand their family to include their sons Lord Ganesha and Lord Kartikkeya. Further stories highlight the success of the female endeavor against the patriarchal anarchy which manifests as threats like Banasura, Narakasura, Arunasura, Durgamasura, Andak and the like ‚Äì all being formidable demons famously killed by the Goddess in various incarnations. The story also highlights the importance of family sticking up for each other, as the Kailash-Parivar face multiple social challenges and deconstruct many primitive thought processes. Other Shakta deities featured in the show as Parvati's incarnations are the 9 'Nava Durgas' (Shailaputri, Brahmacharini, Chandraghanta, Kushmanda, Skandamata, Katyayani/Durga, Kalaratri, Mahagauri & Siddhidhatri) and 7 of the 'Dus Maha Vidhyas' (Kali, Tara, Tripura Sundari, Chinnamasta, Bagalamukhi, Dhumavati & Matangi). Some other Goddess who manifest as Parvati's incarnations include Shakhambari, Satakshi, Sitala, Mhalsa, Kanya Kumari, Matsya, Sati and Brahmari. The Goddesses Lakshmi and Saraswati too often make appearances as Vaishnavi, Narayani and Brahmani. They two often helped Mahakali in her war. The story ends with that Parvathi learns about the entire, that who is she. She finally creates the universe, & Vishnu & Shiva become proud of Mahakali, where again for a war the Tridevi in their warrior form goes on.

There are also regional fertiliser depots in Corrigin, Dalwallinu, Goomalling, Merredin, Tambellup, and Wagin.CSBP Locations History CSBP has its origins in Cuming Smith & Co., which in 1910 began making fertilisers at Bassendean, Western Australia, under the \\"Florida\\" brand name. It was the first company in Australia to manufacture superphosphate.CSBP History =CSML= In 1927, Cuming Smith and two other firms ‚Äì Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company and Westralian Farmers Superphosphates ‚Äì established a new joint venture, Cuming Smith Mount Lyell Farmers Fertiliser Limited (known as CSML). Each company held a one-third share. The establishment of CSML came at a time when the agricultural sector in Western Australia was rapidly expanding. With a capacity output of 240,000 tonnes per year, the company produced almost all of the superphosphate used in WA ‚Äì a total of 1,925,000 tonnes in its first 20 years of operation. CSML commissioned new plants in Bunbury and Geraldton in 1930, in order to reduce the distribution distance for their products. A plant in Albany was commissioned in 1954, and at the same time CSML and Cresco Fertilisers (a South Australian firm) formed a new joint venture, the Albany Superphosphate Company. Albany Superphosphate operated both in Albany and in Esperance, where a plant was established in 1962. =CSBP= In 1963, Boral purchased Mount Lyell's share in CSML. They onsold their share to BP the following year, and CSML was consequently renamed Cuming Smith British Petroleum and Farmers Limited (CSBP). CSBP commissioned superphosphate and sulphuric acid plants in Kwinana in 1967. The Kwinana Nitrogen Company was established the following year, as a joint venture between CSBP (20 percent) and BP (80 percent). In 1970, CSBP also took over its main rival, Cresco Fertilisers. As a result of these changes, the company's plants in Bassendean and North Fremantle ceased operations in 1971. Three additional plants in Kwinana were commissioned in the 1970s. In October 1977, Westralian Farmers (now Wesfarmers) launched a takeover bid for CSBP, valuing the company at $60 million ‚Äì three times what Westralian Farmers itself was valued at. Driven by John Bennison, the deal did not go through until September 1979, after two years of protracted negotiations. At the time, it was the largest corporate takeover in Australian history.The man who made Wesfarmers, The West AustralianWesfarmers: empire that happened by accident, Australian Financial Review During the 1980s, CSBP began to increase its emphasis on industrial chemicals. In 1986, Wesfarmers acquired BP's one-third shared in CSBP, becoming the sole owner. The following year, they also bought out BP's share in the Kwinana Nitrogen Company. In 1988, CSBP formed Australian Gold Reagents Limited (AGR) as a joint venture with Coogee Chemicals and the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC).

The seven were Abuya Abuya (Kitutu East), Onyango Midika (Nyando now Muhoroni), Mwashengu wa Mwachofi (Wundanyi), James Orengo, Lawrence Sifuna (Bumula), Chibule wa Tsuma (Kaloleni) and Koigi wa Wamwere (Nakuru North, now Subukia). Others closely associated with the seven were George Anyona, Chelagat Mutai and Wasike Ndobi.  Origin of the Name  The name was coined by the then Kenyan attorney general Charles Njonjo in 1981. He picked it from the 1975 book The Seven Sisters: The Great Oil Companies and the World they Shaped by Anthony Sampson. https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2000093623/kenya-s-seven-bearded- sisters-fight-for-multi-partyism The book was about how seven of the biggest oil companies in the world conspired to overthrow governments. Njonjo used the word 'bearded' to draw a comparison with Karl Marx, as he saw these MPs to uphold Marxist ideologies. http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2015/09/26/it-was-a- huge-mistake-to-abandon-the-westminster-model-for-our_c1211528  Grievances  The MPs were left wing backbenchers who had been vocal in opposing most of the government's policies, especially what they saw as the government's close association with Western powers. The group was unofficial and most of them only knew each other through the motions they proposed and debated in parliament. They garnered most of their support in the student bodies of public universities, especially the powerful SONU (Student Organization of Nairobi University). Most of the seven served time in detention and/ or went to exile. Orengo went to exile in Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia in the 1980s to escape the oppressive KANU regime. http://www.nation.co.ke/lifestyle/lifestyle/JAMES-Orengo-lifts-the-lid- on-43-years-of-hard-tackle-politics/1214-3213116-14gnh74z/index.html Wamwere was sent to jail in 1982 for accusing the Moi government of ethnic discrimination and corruption. After his release in 1984, he went to exile in Uganda then later to Norway. http://www.unhcr.org/about- us/promref/3b725517e/wa-wamwere-koigi.html  Legacy  The MPs were the first in post-independent Kenya to openly and vocally defy the government in parliament.

She worked initially as a lecturer and tutor in Switzerland in the 1930s and later moved to teach at women colleges in Massachusetts and Virginia after emigrating to the United States. Life and career The Main Building of the University of Zurich Sweet Briar College Seal St√ºcklen, the daughter of factory owner Hermann St√ºcklen, was assistant to Eduard Riecke and earned her doctorate in 1919 at the University of G√∂ttingen with Robert Wichard Pohl with a dissertation on the question of the apparent form of the firmament. Then she went to Zurich, interrupted by a year in Delft (1921). In 1931 she qualified as a lecturer at the University of Zurich, where she was a private tutor. While St√ºcklen worked at the University of Zurich, she worked with chemist Jeanne Eder and physician Mariette Schaetzel in 1933. In October 1933, St√ºcklen was threatened to leave Switzerland to return to Germany. Jeanne Eder allowed St√ºcklen to receive a fellowship from the Rockefeller Fund which allowed her to emigrate to the United States in 1934. In 1934 she emigrated to the United States with the help of the Swiss Association of University Women and a National Research Council Fellowship. St√ºcklen taught at the Mount Holyoke women‚Äôs college in South Hadley, Massachusetts until 1939. In 1943, St√ºcklen then taught physics at the private women‚Äôs college Sweet Briar in Sweet Briar, Virginia where she retired in 1956. She retired in 1956 but spent four more years as Chairman of the Wilson College Physics Faculty in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. After retiring again in 1960, she returned to Germany, where she died in 1963. In the USA, she collaborated frequently with Hertha Sponer, who had an experimental laboratory at Duke University, not far from Sweet Briar College.

It was attached to North Station and the Boston Garden. In 1983 the building was demolished to make way for the Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Federal Building. Development On November 15, 1927, Homer Loring, chairman of the Boston & Maine Railroad, announced that plans had been finalized for the construction of a new North Station facility, which would include a sports arena, hotel, office building, and distributing terminal. On July 15, 1929, Manger Hotels and the Boston & Maine Railroad announced that the two parties had signed a contract for the construction of the hotel. B&M; and Manger would each hold 50% of the stock in the building company and the hotel would be leased to a company owned by Julius Manger. The cost of the building was to be $2.8 million. Opening The Hotel Manger (pronounced Mang-er as in hangar) opened to the public on August 30, 1930. It was the fifteenth hotel opened by the Manger chain, which also owned hotels in New York City and Chicago. The 17-story hotel contained 500 rooms, a restaurant, private dining rooms, oyster bar, banquet hall/ballroom, barber shop, and beauty salon. At the time of its opening, the Hotel Manger had proportionately more marble than any other building in New England. The top floors offered views of the Charles River, Bunker Hill Monument, and Boston Harbor. The hotel had direct access to the Boston Garden and North Station. George L. Bowles was the hotel's first manager. The hotel was formally opened on September 27, 1930. The reception was attended by over 200 guests, including Mayor James Michael Curley, Secretary of the Commonwealth Frederic W. Cook, and U.S. Representative John McCormack. Former Boston fire commissioner Theodore A. Glynn was the toastmaster for the event. From 1934 to 1936, radio station WMEX had its studio in the Hotel Manger. Notable guests and incidents Throughout its early years, acts that were performing at the Boston Garden, including Arthur Godfrey, Paul Whiteman, Gene Autry, and Roy Rogers, stayed at the Hotel Manger. Visiting hockey and basketball teams playing at the Garden stayed at the hotel until they switched from rail to air travel. Track athletes participating at the BAA Meet, including Glenn Cunningham, Harrison Dillard, Charles Beetham, and Ralph Boston, also stayed at the Manger. In 1964, The Beatles stayed and held a press conference at the hotel. On July 29, 1932, the Boston Police Department arrested 26 men they believed were involved in the pool and lottery racket. 25 of the 26 men were also charged with suspicion of knowledge of murder. On March 13, 1935, the body of Sturgis H. Hunt, a Quincy, Massachusetts political figure who was a \\"missing witness\\" in the removal proceedings against Mayor Charles A. Ross, was found by a chambermaid. Hunt had committed suicide by drinking poison. On April 5, 1947, at the Boston Bruins annual breakup party, Bill Cowley unexpectedly announced he was leaving hockey because general manager Art Ross left him off of the roster for a post-season exhibition tour of Western Canada and the United States (Cowley's wife was from Vancouver and he wanted to use the trip as a honeymoon). At the time of his retirement, Cowley was the NHL's all-time leading point scorer. On October 25, 1949, the body of Leon G. Whittemore, head of a local chemical company, was found in a third-floor restroom. The medical examiner ruled that Whittemore's death was a suicide by poisoning. On April 1, 1950, the literary scholar F. O. Matthiessen committed suicide by jumping out of a 12th floor window. On October 21, 1951, groundwork on the Central Artery resulted in the hotel losing its steam supply. The hotel used a steam locomotive to heat the hotel until service was restored. On September 19, 1953, boxing trainer and manager Ray Arcel was critically injured in front of the hotel when he was hit from behind by an assailant wielding a lead pipe. The attack was a warning from the mob, who did not want Arcel to organize a competing television broadcast. The attack was never solved and Arcel remained out of boxing until 1972, when he came out of retirement to train Roberto Dur√°n. On September 12, 1964, the Beatles stayed at the hotel and held a press conference there. On May 14, 1970, Bruins head coach Harry Sinden held a press conference at the hotel to announce he was leaving hockey to enter private business. His announcement came four days after the Bruins defeated the St. Louis Blues in the 1970 Stanley Cup Finals. Ownership changes In 1958, the Boston & Maine Railroad began negotiations to purchase full ownership of the hotel. The purchase was announced on January 30, 1959. The hotel was renamed as the Hotel Madison by B&M.; Julius Manger Jr. stated that the reason for the sale was the company's desire to focus on its motel operations. In July 1963, B&M; sold the hotel, the North Station Industrial Building, and about 17 acres of land behind North Station to Linnel & Cox. Linnel & Cox soon sold the hotel to Dison Corp. for a reported $2 million amid threats that the city would take over the property because of tax defaults. Closure and demolition As railroad traffic declined, the neighborhood surrounding North Station lost its importance as a commuter center and the hotel began to suffer financially. In 1973, Dison petitioned to convert the hotel into an elderly housing complex. The Boston Housing Authority supported the proposal and worked to get federal funding. The BHA also considered moving its headquarters to the hotel if the project was completed. However, plans for the housing development fell through. On October 21, 1976, it was announced that due to financial problems, the hotel would close on October 30. In March 1983, the Boston Redevelopment Authority purchased the hotel from the MSL Reality Trust for $2.2 million. On May 15, 1983, the hotel was demolished by explosives. An estimated 26,000 people observed the implosion, which was also televised live by WNEV. The hotel was demolished in order to make way for the construction of the Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Federal Building.

Biography Stella Maud Hinds was born in Blaauwbank, the South African Republic, on March 11, 1895. She was the daughter of Alice Maud Jennings and Thomas Charles Hinds, a burgher of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek with a farm near Magaliesburg. Stella's sister, (Hilda) Grace Hinds, was the mother of John Cranko, the South African ballet dancer and choreographer. Grace's husband, Herbert Cranko, helped to raise money and secure permissions for Stella's subsequent expedition with Chaplin Court Treatt from the Cape to Cairo. In 1923, Stella married Major Chaplin Court Treatt, an RFP pilot who had been tasked with surveying and constructing airfields for the southern portion of the Trans- African air route.The southern section of the Imperial Airways trans-African route ran 2,000 miles from Mbala, Zambia (which was then called Abercorn, after the chairman of the British South Africa Company, which ran the town in those days) through Kabwe (then called Broken Hill) and then along the railway linking Kabwe to Cape Town. Kabwe is now located in Zambia, formerly named Northern Rhodesia after Cecil Rhodes, founder of the British South Africa Company. In 1924, after an interval securing permissions in England, Stella and Chaplin Court Treatt, together with Stella's brother, Errol Hinds, and several others, undertook a seventeen-month car journey from Cape Town to Cairo. In 1926, the Treatts traveled to Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, to film a wildlife documentary. Stella Maud Treatt and Chaplin Court Treatt divorced after several trips together, evidently having had enough of each other's company. In 1937, Stella married Robert \\"Bob\\" Mosley Yeo, a doctor who had been treating her in South Africa, and they moved to India. Stella eventually returned to South Africa with Robert Yeo. Stella Maud Mosley Yeo died in Johannesburg on 20 December 1976. Cape to Cairo Expedition The Court Treatt expedition was the first successful attempt to drive a motor car from Cape Town (\\"the Cape\\"), South Africa, to Cairo, Egypt.Admittedly the Treatts were beaten by the \\"Croisi√®re noire\\" (Citro√´n central Africa expedition). The expedition was known as the croisi√®re noire (fr. \\"black cruise\\") and initiated by Andr√© Citro√´n. It was led by Georges-Marie Haardt and his deputy Louis Audouin-Dubreuil and included L√©on Poirier, Georges Specht, Eug√®ne Bergognier, Charles Brull, and Alexandre Iacovleff. They crossed the continent from north to south and arrived in Cape Town in 1925. The Citro√´n expedition was undertaken with specially adapted Half-track Citro√´n Type B2 lorries, which were more like tanks than motor cars. See The party consisted of Stella Court Treatt, Chaplin Court Treat, Thomas A. Glover, a cinematographer, Fred C. Law, special correspondent for the London Daily Express, Stella's brother Errol, Julius Mapata, the expedition's guide and translator, and Captain F.C. Blunt and Mr. McEleavey, representatives of the Crossley Motor company. On September 13, 1924, they set off from Cape Town in two Crossley 25/30 light trucks. They reached Cairo sixteen months (and 12,732 miles) later on January 24, 1926. The expedition was explicitly modeled after the fashion of Cecil Rhodes‚Äô \\"red line\\" connecting the Cape Town to Cairo, and they restricted their route to territories under British rule.The idea that came to be most associated with Cecil Rhodes was of an unbroken stretch of territory controlled by the British Empire and running across the entire African continent. The name comes from the practice of coloring the territory of the British Empire red or pink on maps. See the All-Red Route. Fred Law's account of the beginning of the trip, Woman Pioneer of Empire: Cape to Cairo venture Begun (Daily Express, September 24, 1924), began with an invocation of Rhodes' vision of a network of roads and railroads linking up British colonial possessions to afford white settlement and the more effective domination of the continent and its people: \\"The second step towards the fulfilment of Cecil Rhodes‚Äô scheme to open up the routes through darkest Africa began this morning, when Major and Mrs. C. Court Treatt left Capetown in an attempt to reach Cairo by motorcar.\\" Stella observed the difficulties that the imperial route presented; \\"[had we taken an alternative route] our problems would have been simplified [. . .] we would have found roads [. . .] and we could have avoided bridgeless rivers and swamps. But the desirability of blazing a trail through British Africa was superior to every other consideration.\\" Their route took them from Cape Town through Britstown, Pretoria, Polokwane (formerly, Pietersburg), Bulawayo (in Zimbabwe, formerly, Rhodesia, where they visited Cecil Rhode's grave), Livingstone (in Zambia, formerly Northern Rhodesia), Kabwe (in Zambia, formerly called Broken Hill),See note 1. Mbala (in Zambia and formerly called Abercorn), Karonga (Malawi, formerly Nyasaland), Mwaya (Tanzania, formerly Tanganyika), Nairobi (Kenya), Mongalla (South Sudan, formerly the Anglo- Egyptian Sudan), Rumbek, Wau, Al-Ubayyid (Sudan, formerly the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan; spelled, 'El Obeid,' by Treatt), Ed Dueim, Khartoum, Wadi Halfa, and finally Aswan (Egypt) to Cairo in Egypt. =Southern Sudan= The expedition left Nairobi on October 10, 1925, and reached Mongala eight days later, where they were received by Major Roy Brock, Deputy governor of Mongalla Province. After declining an offer to transport their cars by steamer to bypass the Sudd, South Sudan's great central wetlands, they set off again on October 25, 1925, with the aim of reaching Terekeka, which lay about 60 miles north. Their route took them through Rumbek, Tonj, Aweil, and across the Lol River and then the Kiir River and eventually to Muglad and Al-Ubayyid, which they reached on December 20th, 1925. They rarely made more than eight miles per day, frequently needing to rely on people (often hundreds at a time) living along the route to drag and pull and raft or float their cars across rivers and haul them through swamps. =Return to England= When the Treatts returned to England, \\"their journey was celebrated as a triumph of the British spirit and the superiority of British engineering.\\" In 1927, not long after their return, Stella published Cape to Cairo: The Record of a Historic Motor Journey and the film of the expedition, Cape to Cairo, was screened in Britain and the United States, \\"accompanied by lectures and numerous interviews starring the glamorous Stella Court Treatt\\". Newspapers and advertisers transformed the Treatts into celebrities, with Crossley Motors and the North British Rubber Company running advertisements alongside interviews with Stella. The General Strike of 1926, which began three months after their return to England, provided a backdrop for Stella's account of the Treatt expedition. The right- wing British Organisation for the Maintenance of Supplies, which was by that time a government agency, coordinated car and lorry drivers to work as volunteer strikebreakers to move supplies and provide public transportation. Stella met King George V and Queen Mary at Buckingham Palace, and her portrait was taken by the London photography firm Bassano Ltd, Royal Photographers. Sudan Expedition In 1928, after spending two years in England, the Treatts set out again for Sudan to make a moving picture of Sudan's wildlife. Their trip began at Port Sudan and continued the length of the railway to El Obeid, taking the Treatts through places like Abu Gabra that they had visited during their earlier Cape-to-Cairo expedition. Two motion pictures were produced, Stampede (1930) and Stark Nature (1930). Stampede is a romance scripted by Stella that concerns a man named Boru and how he found love with Loweno and ended up a \\"Sheikh\\", after first being orphaned, when his mother was killed by a lion, and adopted by a Habbaniya sheikh, who subsequently loses his life along with his son during a drought, thus opening up the position of sheikh for Boru. The film is organized around a racist, visual trope of 'primitive Africans' and their close linkages to wildlife. Stark Nature (1930) was also organized around a racist, visual trope of 'primitive Africans' and 'modern Europeans.' The film opens with cabaret dancing in London to supply a contrast with African dance. In Sudan Sand: filming the baggara Arabs (1930) Stella describes building an artificial river to provide a suitable setting for a wildlife film: \\"there is more forest than we know what to do with. The real difficulty lies in finding a suitable forest with a natural water course running in the same place.\\" Much like the narrative of Cape to Cairo (1927), the story of Sudan Sand (1930) revolves around the difficulties that the Treatts encountered in trying to compel colonial subjects to dig a river without compensation or adequate tools or any obvious purpose in the heat of Equatorial Africa.Stella's claim that African colonial subjects were \\"primitive\\" and \\"lazy\\" was a common justification for colonial rule. See Stark Nature (1930) received mixed reviews. Some complained that all the cutting between \\"primitive and modern\\" dance sequences was overwrought; others wrote that the narrative was too artificial for a \\"Nature film.\\" Published works =Writing=   =Filmography=   See also *Cape to Cairo Road *Cecil Rhodes *All-Red Route *Imperial Airways *Court Treatt expedition *Crossley Motors *List of female explorers and travelers Notes  References  1924 in Africa Female explorers South African travel writers South African documentary filmmakers South African women film directors Women travel writers Women documentary filmmakers ","title":"Stella Court Treatt"},{"id":"54270305","text":"Environmental Health and Preventive Medicine is a bimonthly peer-reviewed open access medical journal covering preventive medicine and environmental health.

He received his DDS from Gama Filho University, Rio de Janeiro in 1989, and his endodontic certificate from Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in 1991. In 1996, he received his Master's Degree in Microbiology and Immunology from Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. He concluded his PhD in Microbiology and Immunology in 1998 at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Since 2002, Dr. Siqueira is the Chairman of Endodontics, Director of the Postgraduate Program in Endodontics and Head of the Molecular Microbiology laboratory at Est√°cio de S√° University, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Dr. Siqueira has made important contributions to the field of Endodontics, specially working with microbiological issues. Along with his colleague Dr. Isabela R√¥√ßas, he developed several studies using molecular biology methods that helped to decipher the diversity of the microbiota infecting dental root canals. They were pioneers in the use of several molecular techniques to unravel the identity of endodontic pathogens. They for the first time detected several oral pathogens in association with apical periodontitis and abscesses, including Treponema denticola (year 2000), Treponema socranskii (year 2001), other treponemes (years 2003-2008), Filifactor alocis (year 2003), Synergistetes species and many other cultivable and uncultivated species/phylotypes. Siqueira and R√¥√ßas pioneered the profiling of endodontic bacterial communities, showing great interindividual variability and association of some profiles with disease conditions. Based on their findings and experience, in 2009, Siqueira and R√¥√ßas proposed a model for causation of apical periodontitis, in which the disease is a result of the collective pathogenicity of the bacterial communities in the canal - the concept of the community as the unit of pathogenicity. Studies from Dr. Siqueira's laboratory in collaboration with researchers from other countries also revealed that the composition of endodontic microbiota can vary from country to country and this may impact on the antimicrobial treatment outcome. Dr. Siqueira has also been involved in the development of clinical trials evaluating the antimicrobial effectiveness of techniques and substances used during root canal treatments. Dr. Siqueira published more than 350 scientific papers in peer reviewed journal. He authored 11 books about Endodontics, Microbiology and Immunology. He also wrote chapters for the most famous international endodontic textbooks. His ISI H-index, which measures both the productivity and impact of the published work of a scientist, is 53, one of the highest in the field. As major honors for the contribution of his work to the field of Endodontics, Jos√© Siqueira received the 2014 Louis I. Grossman Award from the American Association of Endodontists (AAE) and the 2012 Louis I. Grossman Award from the Societe Fran√ßaise d'Endodontie (SFE), maximum honors from both entities awarded to a researcher. Since 2008, is one of the few teachers from outside the United States to appear on the Recommended Speakers List of the American Association of Endodontists, whose names are endorsed by the Association for Continuing Education courses for credit in that country. He has been lecturing worldwide. Dr. Siqueira is a member of the editorial board and ad hoc reviewer of numerous international journals, having served as an Associate Editor for the Journal of Endodontics from 2006 to 2008 and is currently a member of the Scientific Advisory Board of the Journal of Endodontics and the Editorial Board of the Journal of Oral Microbiology and ENDO-Endodontic Practice Today journal.

Some kinds of molecules could have different minimum-energy tautomers in different electronic states, and if the molecular structure of minimum-energy tautomer in the excited state is proton-transferred geometry between neighboring atoms, proton transfer in excited state can occur. The tautomerization often takes the form of keto-enol tautomerism.  Characteristic  Since a proton-transferred geometry is usually the minimum- energy tautomer only in the excited state and relatively unstable in the ground state, molecules that have ESIPT character may show extraordinarily larger Stokes shift than common fluorescent molecules, or exhibit dual fluorescence that shorter-wavelength one comes from the original tautomer and longer-wavelength one from proton-transferred tautomer. However, there are some exceptional cases where ESIPT molecules have no dual luminescence or significantly red-shifted emission from proton-transferred tautomer, from various reasons. Rate of ESIPT process may slow down by deuterium substitution of hydrogen that is transferred in ESIPT, because the deuteration increases only mass of the transferred significantly while do not change electrostatic potential in the molecule substantially. However the amount of rate change may lie in the range of 1~50, depending on the shape and size of potential energy surfaces of the molecule.  Application  Based on characteristic that molecules usually have extraordinarily larger Stokes shift when ESIPT occurs, various applications have been developed using red-shifted fluorescence. Applications include turn-on photoluminescence sensor, photochromic, non- destructive optical memory, and white-light emitting materials.

With the win, Federer surpassed Pete Sampras and William Renshaw, who had each won it seven times. Federer also became only the second man in the Open era, after Bj√∂rn Borg in 1976, to win Wimbledon without losing a set. This was Federer's 70th appearance at a Grand Slam, tying the record for male players and a record-breaking 11th men's singles final at the same Grand Slam tournament. In addition, by virtue of his third-round win over Mischa Zverev, Federer won his 317th Grand Slam singles match, surpassing Serena Williams' record of 316 match wins and giving him the all-time record for the most Grand Slam singles match wins by any player, male or female. Also, with his first-round win, Federer surpassed Jimmy Connors' record for most match wins at Wimbledon. In the same match, he hit his 10000th ace, becoming only the third man to do so. The tournament marked the fifth time that Nadal and Federer won the French Open and Wimbledon respectively in the same year. Andy Murray was the defending champion, and top seed, but was defeated by Sam Querrey in the quarterfinals. Despite his loss, Murray retained the ATP No. 1 singles ranking at the end of the tournament, as Rafael Nadal, Stan Wawrinka, and Novak Djokovic all failed to gain enough ranking points to surpass him. This was also the first Grand Slam tournament since the 2009 French Open in which Murray, Nadal and Djokovic all failed to reach the semifinals, and the first time since 2004 that no player reached all four quarterfinals in a year. With his win over Murray, Querrey became the first American man to reach a Grand Slam semifinal since Andy Roddick at the 2009 Wimbledon Championships; it was also the second time he had defeated a world No. 1 player, the first was against Djokovic at the 2016 Wimbledon Championships. For the first time since the 2005 Australian Open, David Ferrer was not seeded at a Grand Slam, and it was the first time since the 2004 US Open that fellow Spaniard Guillermo Garc√≠a L√≥pez did not play at a Grand Slam, ending his streak of 50 consecutive Grand Slam appearances. Stan Wawrinka was attempting to complete the career Grand Slam but lost to Daniil Medvedev in the first round. This was also the last Grand Slam tournament for former World No. 2 Tommy Haas.

Chungmusa on Gogeum continues to hold a memorial service every year on April 28, the admiral‚Äôs birthday, and mark his patriotic fall on November 19.  History  The main building of Chungmusa was first built as ‚Äòthe Tomb of Guan Yu‚Äô in the 31st year of Seonjo of Joseon reign (1598) by a Ming dynasty admiral to enshrine and pay homage to Guan Yu, the Chinese dynasty‚Äôs war god, and wish for a victory in the war. In the 7th year of Hyeonjong of Joseon reign (1666), Yu Bi-yeon as the new commanding general of Western Jeolla Province Naval Command expanded it and built Okcheonsa Temple beside the Tomb of Guan Yu for memorial service. In the 9th year of Sukjong of Joseon reign (1686), a new shrine was built west of the Tomb of Guan Yu to commemorate Admiral Yi Sun-sin, and the whole compound came to enshrine three persons, Guan Yu and Chen Lin in the eastern building and Yi Sun-sin in the western building. During Hyeonjong of Joseon reign, the officials of the six counties or prefectures of Yeongam, Gangjin, Boseong, and Haenam conducted memorial services on two annual occasions of Gyeongchib and Sanggang. In the 15th year of his reign (1791), Jeongjo of Joseon granted a plaque of ‚ÄòTanbomyo‚Äô in his handwriting, when the shrine also began to honor Ming‚Äôs Admiral Deng Zilong who was killed in the battle of Noryang. As a 70-year-old deputy of Chen Lin, Deng Zilong met a valiant death in the same battle in which Admiral Yi Sun-sin fought alongside. During the Period of Japanese Occupation, the entire paraphernalia of artifices (armor, books, murals, and plaques) including the statue of Guan Yu and memorial tablets were thrown into the sea according to the policy that intended to suppress the national spirit, while the Buddha statue of Okcheonsa Temple alone was moved to Baegunsa Temple where it was kept.Cultural Heritage Administration of the South Korea In 1945 after the national liberation, the Korean Confucianism of Gogeumdo led the effort to rebuild the shrine on the old site of the Tomb of Guan Yu and changed the plaque to Chungmusa, thus honoring Admiral Yi Sun-sin in its main hall. In 1959, Jo Bangjang, Admiral Yi‚Äôs adjutant, and Yi Yeong-nam, then an officer in charge of Garipo, were honored in the eastern building, and services have since been held every year on Admiral Yi Sun-sin‚Äôs Anniversary on April 28 and his patriotic death on November 19 (on lunar calendar).

Background Djalout is of French-Algerian heritage. Club career Djalout began his professional career with Elite One Championship side Union Treiziste Catalane (now Saint-Esteve), he played in nine games and managed two tries in his first spell with the club. Following his stint with Saint-Esteve, the second rower joined up with the SM Pia, also of the Elite One Championship. He spent four years with them from 2008‚Äì2012. In this spell he played 38 times and scored eighteen tries and kicked three goals. In his first season the club finished third in the division with 47 points collected. After this, they suffered back-to-back defeats in the play-offs. The following year the club finished fourth with 11 less points than before but were more successful in the play- off stages as they reached the final to be beaten by L√©zignan Sangliers. During the 2010/11 season Pia picked up 50 points but again finished third in the league and lost in the Elimination Final stage of the play-offs. However, in his final season with the side they finally won the league with 46 total points. They again suffered a play-off Grand Final defeat by AS Carcassonne. Djalout then joined L√©zignan Sangliers in 2012, but he only scored once in just three appearances. After this spell with another Elite One Championship team he joined up with 2014 Grand Finalists Palau Broncos, but he played even less here making just two appearances. Having just played 5 times in two seasons and at two different clubs, Djalout rejoined his first club Saint- Esteve. From 2015‚Äì2017 he played much more frequently, making 19 apps in two seasons and racking up 6 tries. This new found good form attracted the attention of French Rugby league's best team the Catalans Dragons. In 2017 he made his Super League debut, and only game, for the Dragons against the Huddersfield Giants. After having trials with newly promoted Super League side Hull K.R.and turning down a new deal with Catalans, Djalout signed for English Championship outfit the Sheffield Eagles. He made his d√©but against the Dewsbury Rams and impressed as the Eagles went down 20 points to 18. However, during a game against the Rochdale Hornets Djalout suffered an injury that turned out to be a ruptured Achilles tendon and this ruled him out for the rest of the season. At the end of the season, Djalout's contract was not renewed with the Eagles and he returned to France to play for AS Carcassonne. =International career= He featured for France in the 2017 Rugby League World Cup and played against England and Lebanon in the Group Stages.

The book is intended to help law enforcement and intelligence officials with the professional practice of behavior analysis and criminal psychology of anticipating potential terrorists before they commit criminal acts. Nance draws from the field of traditional criminal analysis to posit that detecting domestic criminals is similar to determining which individuals are likely to commit acts of terrorism. The book provides resources for the law enforcement official including descriptions of devices used for possible bombs, a database of terrorist networks, and a list of references used. Nance gives the reader background on Al-Qaeda tactics, clandestine cell systems and sleeper agents, and terrorist communication methods. Terrorist Recognition Handbook received two separate book reviews in the academic journal Perspectives on Terrorism. The journal placed the book on its \\"Top 150 Books on Terrorism and Counterterrorism\\". Its second review of the book wrote that the Terrorist Recognition Handbook \\"provides a comprehensive and detailed treatment of terrorism and counter-terrorism.\\" A review published by RSA Conference called it \\"required reading\\", and \\"a must-read for anyone tasked with or interested in anti-terrorism activities.\\" Midwest Book Review rated it \\"highly recommended for those in charge of security and community library military collections.\\" Background Malcolm Nance, author of Terrorist Recognition Handbook Malcolm Nance is a retired U.S. Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer in naval cryptology. He garnered expertise within the fields of intelligence and counterterrorism. He served in the U.S. Navy for 20 years, from 1981‚Äì2001. Nance was an interpreter for Russian, and began working in the intelligence field through research into the history of the Soviet Union and its spying agency the KGB. He devoted years of research to analyzing Middle East terrorism and sovereign nations with ties to Russia. He graduated from New York's Excelsior College with a degree in Arabic. Nance took part in combat operations which occurred after the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings, was involved with the 1986 United States bombing of Libya, served on USS Wainwright during Operation Praying Mantis and participated in the sinking of Iranian missile boat Joshan, served on USS Tripoli during the Gulf War, and assisted during a Banja Luka, Bosnia air strike. After retiring from military service, Nance founded a consulting company based in Georgetown, Washington, D.C. where he provided advising services to United States Special Operations Command. During the September 11 attacks, Nance personally witnessed American Airlines Flight 77 crash into The Pentagon and he assisted in rescue operations at the impact site. He created a training center called the Advanced Terrorism, Abduction and Hostage Survival School. Nance manages a think tank analyzing counterterrorism called \\"Terror Asymmetrics Project on Strategy, Tactics and Radical Ideologies\\", consisting of Central Intelligence Agency and military intelligence officers with direct prior field experience. Nance is a member of the board of directors for the International Spy Museum in Washington, D.C. Nance's books on counter-terrorism include: The Terrorists of Iraq, An End to al-Qaeda, The Plot to Hack America, Defeating ISIS, and Hacking ISIS. Summary The book serves as a manual for counter-terrorism and law enforcement officials to prevent terrorist attacks. It is organized into six sections, covering topics including the motivations and methods of terrorists, warning signs of terrorism, intelligence collection management strategies, post-attack mitigation measures, and weapons used by terrorists, including weapons of mass destruction. Appendix resources include indexes of explosive materials and terrorist groups. Nance discusses suicide bombers, noting that it is crucial to understand their extremist religious views in order to anticipate their attacks. Nance also covers the modus operandi of terrorist cells which are a key component of terror operations. His analysis includes the different types of cells, as well as their common tactics, communication and recruitment methods. The book provides background on worldwide extremism ideologies and the operations of al-Qaeda across the world. It explains how al-Qaeda categorizes their targets as \\"Near Enemies\\" or \\"Far Enemies\\". The former group includes federal bureaucracies in India, Bangladesh, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia. The latter includes Israel, Europe, Australia, and the United States. Nance emphasizes the splintered nature of al-Qaeda, which operates as a collective of smaller groups inspired by Osama bin Laden, with the Internet serving as a central organizing hub. He observes that where al-Qaeda had previously functioned as a set of terrorist entities, it shaped its operations to become more business-like, serving to disseminate information, motivate members, and provide economic funding for terrorist operations. Release and reception The book was first published in 2003. Its third edition was published in 2013 by CRC Press. An e-book edition was released the same year. CRC Press published another release of the third edition of the book, both in print and e-book formats. Nance's work received a book review from Midwest Book Review, which wrote: \\"Terrorist Recognition Handbook offers an examination of common and uncommon terrorist tactics ‚Äì and how to identify an attack before it happens.\\" The review concluded, \\"Terrorist Recognition Handbook: A Practitioner's Manual for Predicting and Identifying Terrorist Activities is highly recommended for those in charge of security and community library military collections.\\" Terrorist Recognition Handbook received two separate book reviews in the academic journal Perspectives on Terrorism. The journal placed the book on its \\"Top 150 Books on Terrorism and Counterterrorism\\". Joshua Sinai wrote for Perspectives on Terrorism, \\"Written by a 20-year veteran of the U.S. intelligence community, this book provides an assessment of terrorists‚Äô motivations and methods, including a listing of pre- incident indicators of potential terrorist activity, and the methodologies required to organize such information into actionable intelligence for effective response measures.\\" Sinai wrote of the resources contained within the monograph, \\"The information is explained through numerous illustrations, including explanations of the types of conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction that might be used by terrorists.\\" In his second review of the book for Perspectives on Terrorism, Sinai wrote that the book, \\"provides a comprehensive and detailed treatment of terrorism and counter-terrorism.\\" Ben Rothke reviewed the book for RSA Conference, and called it \\"required reading\\". Rothke praised the author's expertise and writing style, \\"Terrorist Recognition Handbook: A Practitioner's Manual for Predicting and Identifying Terrorist Activities, is unique in that author Malcolm Nance is a 20-year veteran of the U.S. intelligence community and writes from a first hand- perspective, but with the organization and methodology of writers such as Pipes and Emerson. Those combined traits make the book extraordinarily valuable and perhaps the definitive text on terrorist recognition.\\" Rothke's review concluded, \\"The Terrorist Recognition Handbook is a must-read for anyone tasked with or interested in anti-terrorism activities. One would hope that every TSA and Homeland Security manager and employee get a copy of this monumental reference.\\" See also *List of books about al-Qaeda *Islamic extremism *Islamic fundamentalism *Islamic terrorism *Muslim attitudes toward terrorism References Further reading * External links * 2013 non-fiction books American non-fiction books Political science books Non-fiction books about war Non-fiction books about jihadism Books about counter- terrorism Books about al-Qaeda Books about Islamic fundamentalism Books by Malcolm Nance ","title":"Terrorist Recognition Handbook"},{"id":"54270890","text":"Shahjadpur is a city ward in Bangladesh.

The library was the first public library for a town in Estonia, and served as the nation's legal deposit library for ten years during its early existence. The library currently provides services to those who are unable to access a physical branch through a bookmobile, and provides access to works of modern Estonian literature via e-book throughout the world to anyone with internet access. History It was established on 14 October 1907 as Tallinn Town Free Public Library, and was the first town library in Estonia. The library was led by Aleksander Sibul from 1921-1950, and he made it into a central library that had multiple branches and departments. Between 1938 and 1948 the library contained an active archival department that collected 40,000 units of archival materials and received the legal deposit copies for all of Estonia. The library maintained this archival material until 1958, at which time it was distributed to other libraries. Twenty-first century In 2004 it was proposed that the library should have a bookmobile, and the library acquired one named Katarina Jee in 2008. Katarina Jee has the capacity to hold 3,800 volumes at one time and serves areas where branch libraries are absent or temporarily unavailable. The service provides books both in Russian and Estonian, with 70% of the materials being Estonian-language titles. In 2012 the Tallinn Central Library created ELLU, a e-book lending program for works of modern Estonian literature. Tallinn Central Library is the only library in Estonia that provided copies of modern Estonian literature via e-book, and access to the ELLU system is available to anyone in the world, with registered users being reported from countries in Europe, North America, and Asia. In 2017 the library expanded their e-book offerings to allow English and Russian speaking patrons to access e-books.

The type specimen was collected in Puerto Esperanza, Misiones (Argentina), where it was found growing on Pinus taeda logs in a subtropical forest. It has since been found in Gabon. Skeletocutis diluta has effused-reflexed fruit bodies, meaning they are crust-like with a margin that is extended and bent backwards. It has small allantoid (sausage- shaped) spores measuring 3.1‚Äì3.5 by 0.5‚Äì0.8 Œºm. It features a dimitic hyphal system (containing both generative and skeletal hyphae), but the skeletal hyphae dissolve in solution of potassium hydroxide.

He was Town Clerk of Adelaide 1856‚Äì1868. After his resignation he was found guilty of forgery and embezzlement. History W. A. Hughes was a son of Robert Hughes, a merchant of Liverpool, England and Mrs. Hughes (c. 1776 ‚Äì 30 January 1867). He emigrated to South Australia aboard Delhi, arriving in December 1839,Shipping records show a fellow passenger, one M. A. Hughes, who may have been his mother, but further information is yet to be found. and built a residence at Brougham Place, North Adelaide. Jane Sawle emigrated aboard Warrior with her parents and siblings, arriving in November 1839. They were married at Trinity Church, Adelaide on 29 August 1844 and had six surviving children; the three sons were prize-winning students at J. L. Young's Adelaide Educational Institution. He served for a time as clerk to solicitor James Hurtle Fisher, and was highly involved in all manner of public institutions: He was a founder of the Adelaide Lodge of IOOF on 1 January 1841 and their first Corresponding Secretary. He was secretary of the Adelaide Mining Association 1846 and the Wheal Gawler Mines Association 1848 He was founding member of North Adelaide Institute in 1851. He was in 1853 appointed secretary to the Licensed Victuallers' Society, and to the Yatala District Council. He replaced R. B. Colley as Clerk and Collector, West Torrens District Council, in 1853. He was Secretary of the Association of Chairmen of District Councils. He held various responsible positions for Christ Church, North Adelaide, where he was a regular worshipper. He was in December 1853 candidate for Councillor, Robe ward of the City Council,The wards of the Council, Hindmarsh, Gawler, Grey and Robe were named for the first four Governors, and bore no relationship to the suburbs or towns so named. but resoundingly beaten by one Edward Lawson. In December 1855 he was elected Councillor, Robe ward for Adelaide City Council, after resignation of Field, but resigned in early February 1856 preparatory to applying for position of Town Clerk, W. T. Sabben having on 4 February resigned that post. Hughes was appointed to the office on 18 February. Alexander Cumming was elected to Robe ward. In taking this position he found it necessary to relinquish many of his other responsibilities, but not Freemasonry or Christ Church. :Hughes was drawn into bitter controversy at Christ Church: with the death of Archdeacon Woodcock in 1868, a replacement had to be found. The church trustees, whose primary function was building maintenance, property and finances, and of the five members two were not even church members, opted for Rev. Charles Marryat, while the five representatives of the congregation (including Hughes, who served as their spokesman) selected Rev. T. Nowell Twopeny. Bishop Short, to the dismay of many in the congregation, exercised his casting vote in favour of Marryat, to whom he was related. The die was cast however, as Marryat had been consecrated and the appointment could not be undone. At the end of 1868 the Council declared all positions vacant. Hughes did not apply for his old job, and the newly appointed City Treasurer Thomas Worsnop was deputised to take on his duties pro tem. Worsnop acted as Town Clerk from 11 January to 27 July 1869, when the appointment was formalised This voluntary resignation came as a surprise to many, but then the truth came to light, largely due to the conscientiousness of mayor Fuller, that Hughes had been in 1866 and 1867 embezzling Council funds by clever manipulation of the cheque account, which could only be detected by careful comparison of the amount withdrawn and that written on the chequebook stubs. The truth came to light through Hughes's method of repaying the defalcations; by destroying cheques and paying creditors cash out of his own pocket. Hughes was tried, convicted and sentenced to eight years' jail with hard labour. It is likely Hughes was released in late 1873, No further requests for remission were made. but not made public. He subsequently carried on business as an accountant, first privately, then with the firm of Giles & Smith. He died at his home on Eton Street, Malvern.

This was an industrial area from the 1870s to the 1940s. It replaced a recently built building on the same site by the Hawthorne Glove and Novelty Company that had been destroyed in a fire. The back of the building opened upon the rail sidings of a branch line of the Burlington, Cedar Rapids and Northern Railway, later the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific. By the start of World War I the Shrader Drug Company occupied the building. It was one of three drug related factories that were located along the South Gilbert Street corridor at that time. The company name changed to the Hewell-Shrader Drug Company in 1930 and then the Hewell-Shrader Company in 1945 after farm fertilizer was added to its product line. The company closed in 1956, and the building was sold to the Thompson Transfer and Storage Company who used it for a warehouse. Whipple House Furniture Store took over the building three years later, and remained until 1975. In the intervening years a variety of businesses occupied the building until the 1980s when it was vacant for a period of time.

The conspiracists claim that an elite of Marxist theorists and Frankfurt School intellectuals are subverting Western society with a culture war that undermines the Christian values of traditionalist conservatism and promotes the cultural liberal values of the 1960s counterculture and multiculturalism, progressive politics and political correctness, misrepresented as identity politics created by critical theory.Stuart Jeffries, Grand Hotel Abyss, pp.6-11 , Verso 2016 The theory originated in the United States.  Origins  The conspiracy theory of Marxist cultural warfare originated in the essay \\"New Dark Age: Frankfurt School and 'Political Correctness'\\" (1992) written by Michael Minnicinno, published in the Schiller Institute, a LaRouche movement organization journal associated with the fringe American right-wing political activist Lyndon LaRouche. In a speech to the Conservative Leadership Conference of the Civitas Institute in 1998, Paul Weyrich presented his conspiracy theory equating Cultural Marxism to political correctness. He later republished the speech in his syndicated culture war letter. In the United States, the conspiracy theory is promoted by religious fundamentalists and paleoconservative politicians such as William S. Lind, Pat Buchanan and Paul Weyrich as well as the alt- right, neo-Nazi and white nationalists organizations.Paul Weyrich's promotion of Cultural Marxism:  * Promotion of Cultural Marxism by William S. Lind, neo-Nazis and white nationalists: * Promotion of Cultural Marxism by William S. Lind, Pat Buchanan and Paul Weyrich, the alt-right, neo-Nazi and white nationalists: * For the Free Congress Research and Education Foundation, Weyrich commissioned Lind to write a history of Cultural Marxism, defined as \\"a brand of Western Marxism [...] commonly known as 'multiculturalism' or, less formally, Political Correctness\\" which claimed that the presence of openly gay people in the television business proved that Cultural Marxists control the mass media; and that Herbert Marcuse considered a coalition of \\"Blacks, students, feminist women, and homosexuals\\" as a feasible vanguard of cultural revolution in the 1960s. Moreover, the historian Martin Jay said in the Dialectic of Counter-Enlightenment: The Frankfurt School as Scapegoat of the Lunatic Fringe (2011) that Political Correctness: The Frankfurt School (1999), Lind's documentary of conservative counter-culture, was effective Cultural Marxism propaganda because it \\"spawned a number of condensed, textual versions, which were reproduced on a number of radical, right-wing [web] sites\\". He further writes: > These, in turn, led to a plethora of new videos, now available on YouTube, > which feature an odd cast of pseudo-experts regurgitating exactly the same > line. The message is numbingly simplistic: All the 'ills' of modern American > culture, from feminism, affirmative action, sexual liberation, racial > equality, multiculturalism and gay rights to the decay of traditional > education, and even environmentalism, are ultimately attributable to the > insidious intellectual influence of the members of the Institute for Social > Research who came to America in the 1930s.  Aspects of the conspiracy  = Cultural pessimism = The Cultural Marxism conspiracy recycles Joseph Goebbels opinions from the Degenerate Art Exhibition (July‚ÄìNovember 1937) which the Nazis said proved that modern art was part of the cultural Bolshevism conspiracy meant to morally weaken German society In the essay \\"New Dark Age: The Frankfurt School and 'Political Correctness'\\" (1992), Michael Minnicino explains the Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory on behalf of the Schiller Institute, a LaRouche political organization. Minnicino said that the \\"Jewish intellectuals\\" of the Frankfurt School promoted modern art in order to make cultural pessimism the spirit of the counterculture of the 1960s which was based upon the counter-culture Wandervogel, the cultural liberal German youth movement whose Swiss Monte Verit√† commune was the 19th-century predecessor of Western counter-culture in the 1960s.\\"New Dark Age: Frankfurt School and 'Political Correctness.

In the 1994 conference report \\"Solving the Paradox of Current World History\\" published in the Executive Intelligence Review. . Retrieved 6 October 2020. The historian Martin Jay pointed out that Daniel Estulin's book cites Minnicino's essay as political inspiration for the Free Congress Research and Education Foundation. In Fascism: Fascism and Culture (2003), professor Matthew Feldman argues that the etymology of the term Cultural Marxism derived from the antisemitic term Kulturbolschewismus (Cultural Bolshevism), with which the Nazis claimed that Jewish cultural influence caused German social degeneration under the liberal r√©gime of the Weimar Republic (1918‚Äì1933) and was the cause of social degeneration in the West. Moreover, the academic Andrew Woods writes in the essay Cultural Marxism and the Cathedral: Two Alt-Right Perspectives on Critical Theory (2019) that \\"although the Frankfurt School conspiracy has anti-Semitic components, it is inaccurate to call it nothing more than a modernization of cultural Bolshevism.\\" = Alleged aims = In The Wanderer Catholic newspaper article \\"The Frankfurt School: Conspiracy to Corrupt\\" (December 2008), Timothy Matthews said that the Frankfurt School was \\"Satan's work\\" and listed their eleven alleged culture-war aims: # Codification of hate crimes # Causing constant social changes to provoke confusion # Teaching children sex and homosexuality # Weakening the authority of schools and teachers # Mass immigration to destroy national identity # Promoting alcoholism # Reducing church attendance # Weakening the legal system and causing it to be biased against crime victims # Making people dependent on the state or welfare # Controlling the media # Encouraging family breakdown Despite the falsity of the list, conspiracists use Matthew's allegations to promote the Cultural Marxism conspiracy in right-wing and alt-right news media as well as in far- right internet forums such as Stormfront. = Othering of political opponents = In \\"Taking On Hate: One NGO's Strategies\\" (2009), the political scientist Heidi Beirich said that Cultural Marxism demonizes the cultural b√™tes noires of conservatism such as feminists, LGBT social movements, secular humanists, multiculturalists, sex educators, and enviromentalists, immigrants and black nationalists. In Europe, the Norwegian far-right terrorist Anders Behring Breivik quoted Lind's culture-war conspiracy in his 1,500-page political manifesto 2083: A European Declaration of Independence, stating that the \\"sexually transmitted disease (STD) epidemic in Western Europe is a result of cultural Marxism\\"; that \\"Cultural Marxism defines Muslims, feminist women, homosexuals, and some additional minority groups, as virtuous, and they view ethnic Christian European men as evil\\"; and that the \\"European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is a cultural-Marxist-controlled political entity.\\" About 90 minutes before killing 77 people in the 2011 Norway attacks, Breivik e-mailed 1,003 people his manifesto and a copy of Political Correctness: A Short History of an Ideology. In \\"Collectivists, Communists, Labor Bosses, and Treason: The Tea Parties as Right-wing, Populist Counter- subversion Panic'\\" (2012), the journalist Chip Berlet identified the culture war conspiracy as basic ideology of the Tea Party movement within the Republican Party. As a self-identified right-wing movement, the Tea Party claim they are suffering the same cultural subversion suffered by earlier generations of white-nationalists. The populist rhetoric of regional economic elites encourages counter-subversion panics, by which a large constituency of white middle-class people are deceived into unequal political alliances to defend their place in the middle class. Moreover, the failures of free-market capitalism are scapegoated onto the local collectives, communists, labor organisers, non-white citizens and immigrants by manipulating patriotism, economic libertarianism, traditional Christian values and nativism to use Cultural Marxism in defense of the racist and sexist politicians opposed to the big-government policies of the Obama administration. In \\"Cultural Marxism and the Radical Right\\" (2014), the political scientist J√©r√¥me Jamin said that \\"next to the global dimension of the Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory, there is its innovative and original dimension, which lets its racist authors avoid racist discourses, and pretend to be defenders of democracy in their respective countries.\\" The article \\"How Trump's Paranoid White House Sees 'Deep State' Enemies on all Sides\\" (2017) reported that NSC advisor Richard Higgins was fired from the National Security Council for publishing the memorandum '\\"POTUS & Political Warfare\\" that alleged the existence of a left- wing conspiracy to destroy the Trump presidency because \\"American public intellectuals of Cultural Marxism, foreign Islamicists, and globalist bankers, the news media, and politicians from the Republican and the Democrat parties were attacking Trump, because he represents an existential threat to the cultural Marxist memes that dominate the prevailing cultural narrative in the US.\\" = Political correctness and antisemitic canards = In the speech The Origins of Political Correctness (2000), William S. Lind established the ideology and the etymology of the Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory, stating: Concerning the real-life political violence caused by the conspiracy in the editorial \\"The Alt-right's Favorite Meme is 100 Years Old\\" (2018), law professor Samuel Moyn said it is an antisemitic canard, arguing: Moyn concludes that \\"'cultural Marxism' is a crude slander, referring to something that does not exist [Jewish Bolshevism], unfortunately [it] does not mean actual people are not being set up to pay the price, as scapegoats, to appease a rising sense of anger and anxiety. And for that reason, 'cultural Marxism' is not only a sad diversion from framing legitimate grievances, but also a dangerous lure [to political violence] in an increasingly unhinged moment [in world history].\\"  Scholarly analysis  Contrary to the claims and underlying assumptions of the conspiracy theory, academic Joan Braune explained that Cultural Marxism is not an academic school of thought; that Frankfurt School scholars are \\"critical theorists\\", not \\"Cultural Marxists\\"; that academics of postmodernism and feminist scholars are not Marxist theorists, and have slight connections to the Frankfurt School, to Marxism, or to critical theory; and that \\"Cultural Marxism does not exist ‚Äî not only is the conspiracy theory version false, but there is no intellectual movement by that name.\\"  Promoters The conspiracy theory of Marxist culture war is promoted by right-wing politicians, fundamentalist religious leaders, political commentators in mainstream print and television media and white supremacist terrorists. = Politicians = * Fraser Anning, former Australian Senator, initially sitting as a member of Pauline Hanson's One Nation and then Katter's Australian Party, declared during his maiden speech in 2018 that \\"Cultural Marxism is not a throwaway line but a literal truth\\" and spoke of the need for a \\"final solution to the immigration problem‚Äù. * Cory Bernardi, former Australian Senator for South Australia and leader of the Australian Conservatives.

As Conservatives, we are engaged in a battle against cultural Marxism, where banning things is becoming de rigueur, where freedom of speech is becoming a taboo, where our universities ‚Äî quintessential institutions of liberalism ‚Äî are being shrouded in censorship and a culture of no-platforming.\\" Her usage of the conspiracy theory was condemned as hate speech by other MPs, the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the anti-racist organization Hope Not Hate. Braverman dismissed that the term Cultural Marxism is a antisemitic trope, stating: \\"We have culture evolving from the far left which has allowed the snuffing out of freedom of speech, freedom of thought. [...] I'm very aware of that ongoing creep of cultural Marxism, which has come from Jeremy Corbyn.\\" * Nigel Farage promotes the cultural Marxist conspiracy as dog-whistle code for antisemitism in the United Kingdom. * Rich Higgins, while acting as an aide to Donald Trump, wrote a memo framing Trump's presidential campaign as \\"a war on Cultural Marxism that needed to be sustained during his presidency\\". Higgins wrote of \\"a 'cabal' (an antisemitic trope) promoting Cultural Marxism that included 'globalists, bankers, Islamists, and conservative Republicans,' and had captured control of the media, academia, politics, and the financial system, as well as controlling attempts to tamp down on hate speech and hate groups through CVE (Countering Violent Extremism) government programs.\\" Higgins also asserted that the Frankfurt School \\"sought to deconstruct everything in order to destroy it, giving rise to society-wide nihilism.\\" * Matt Shea, a Washington Representative from the Republican Party, is a proponent of the conspiracy theory as outlined in a conspiracy-minded seven-page memo by Rich Higgins, a National Security Council staffer in the Trump administration who was fired after the document became public in July 2017. = Terrorists = The counterfeit police identity card used by the far-right terrorist Anders Behring Breivik while executing his terrorist 2011 Norway attacks which he justified as defense of the Western world against Cultural Marxism * Anders Behring Breivik justified his terrorism by citing Marxist cultural warfare as the primary subject of his political manifesto. Breivik wrote that the \\"sexually transmitted disease (STD) epidemic in Western Europe is a result of cultural Marxism\\", that \\"Cultural Marxism defines Muslims, feminist women, homosexuals, and some additional minority groups, as virtuous, and they view ethnic Christian European men as evil\\" and that the \\"European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is a cultural-Marxist-controlled political entity.\\" * Jack Renshaw, convicted for plotting the assassination of Labour MP Rosie Cooper and threatening to kill a policeman as well as being accused of criminal pedophilia, promoted the conspiracy theory in a video for the British National Party. = Media personalities = * Andrew Breitbart, founder of Breitbart News, was a proponent of the conspiracy theory. * Pat Buchanan promotes the Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory as meant to \\"de-Christianize\\" the United States. * Paul Gottfried is one of the three main proponents of the conspiracy theory. * Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, has promoted the conspiracy theory. * William S. Lind, the principal promoter of the conspiracy, said that Marxists control much of the mass communications media and that political correctness can be directly attributed to Karl Marx. * Kevin MacDonald is one of the three main proponents of the conspiracy theory. * Jordan Peterson blamed the conspiracy for demanding the use of gender- neutral pronouns as a threat to free speech. Peterson often misuses the term postmodernism as a stand in term for the conspiracy. * Ben Shapiro promotes the theory, especially that \\"Cultural Marxist\\" activity is happening in universities.McManus, Matt (18 May 2018). \\"On Marxism, Post-Modernism, and 'Cultural Marxism'\\". Merrion West. . Retrieved 2 October 2020. * Paul Weyrich promoted the conspiracy theory as a deliberate effort to undermine \\"our traditional, Western, Judeo-Christian culture\\" and the conservative agenda in American society, arguing that \\"we have lost the culture war\\" and that \\"a legitimate strategy for us to follow is to look at ways to separate ourselves from the institutions that have been captured by the ideology of Political Correctness, or by other enemies of our traditional culture.

Pattern 1911 guns found a second life on river gunboats and armored trains during the Russian Civil War and as coastal artillery during World War II. In 1941 it was estimated that 146 guns were in service. Of these, 49 were in the Baltic Fleet, 30 in the Black Sea Fleet, 30 in the Pacific Fleet, 18 in the Northern Fleet, 9 in the Caspian Flotilla and 6 in the Pinsk Flotilla.  History  The requirement to re-equip destroyers of the Imperial Russian fleet with guns larger than the current 75 mm 50 caliber Pattern 1892 was raised by the chief of the Baltic Fleet Mine Division, Nikolai Ottowitsch von Essen, in January 1907. The design for the new gun was completed with technical assistance from the British Vickers company at the Obukhov State plant in 1908 and testing was completed in August 1909. Construction Pattern 1911 guns were produced at the Obukhov state plant and the Perm artillery factory between 1911 and 1921. In 1911 an order for 505 guns was placed of which 225 were delivered by January 1, 1917. Another 200 were expected to be produced during 1917 and 83 in 1918. In 1921 an order for 85 guns was placed at the Perm factory, but this was reduced to 48 guns. The Pattern 1911 was constructed of an A tube, reinforced by three hoops which were put on while hot and screwed onto the breech. The Pattern 1911 had a high rate of fire 12-15 rpm (10 rpm practical) due to the use of Fixed QF ammunition and a semi-automatic, horizontal wedge breech mechanism. After ejecting each empty case the gun re-cocked itself and kept breech open for the next round. It also had the usual combination of hydraulic buffer and spring recuperator. The original naval mounts were short and had low angles of elevation between -6¬∞ to +20¬∞. Latter mounts were taller and had high angles of elevation between -10¬∞ to +30¬∞. Naval Use Pattern 1911 guns armed a variety of ships such as destroyers, guard ships, gunboats, landing craft, minelayers and torpedo cruisers of the Imperial Russian Navy. After the 1917 October Revolution the successor states of Estonia, Finland and the Soviet Union all used this gun. Pattern 1911 guns were also used on World War I era destroyers bought by Bulgaria and Peru. Some Romanian cruise ships were lent to Russia in WWI, to be used as auxiliary cruisers, and equipped with 102 mm Obukhov guns. During Bolshevik Revolution most of those ships returned to Romania. In WWII, about 3 to 5 guns were used by Romanians as coastal artillery in Sulina & Sf.Gheorghe Black Sea sectors. Ship classes which carried the Pattern 1911: * Derzky-class destroyers * Fidonisy-class destroyers * Finn-class torpedo cruisers * Gavril-class destroyers * General Kondratenko-class torpedo cruisers * Golub-class guard ships * Kars-class gunboats * Kazarskiy-class torpedo cruisers * Izyaslav-class destroyers * Orfey-class destroyers * Shchastlivyi-class destroyers * Ukrayna-class torpedo cruisers * Uragan-class guard ships * Vsadnik-class torpedo cruisers * Zhemchug-class guard ships  Ammunition  Ammunition was 101.6 x 790mm R and of Fixed QF type.

Signed into law by President Gerald Ford on October 20, 1976, the new statute added almost 900,000 acres of wilderness into the National Wilderness Preservation System. While the majority of designated Wilderness Areas at the time were located in National Forests, this was one of the first laws to formally establish wilderness areas in National Parks and Monuments. Background Responding to a heightened public interest in conservation and an increased threat to public lands by development, and other intrusive or consumptive activities, such as logging, Congress passed the Wilderness Act of 1964, Public Law 88-577 (16 U.S.C. 1131-1136) on September 3, 1964.http://www.wilderness.net/nwps/legisact Created, in the words of the law, ‚Äúto secure for the American people of present and future generations the benefits of an enduring resource of wilderness,‚Äù the law created the National Wilderness Preservation System and a set of criteria and administrative processes by which natural areas could be added to this system.16 U.S.C. 1131-1136 Under this new law, proposed areas on U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service could be designated as Wilderness Areas, special reserves protected from human encroachment and development. Within these areas, unless specially exempted, Congress mandated that there ‚Äúshall be no commercial enterprise and no permanent road within any wilderness area designated by this Act and, except as necessary to meet minimum requirements for the administration of the area...there shall be no temporary road, no use of motor vehicles, motorized equipment or motorboats, no landing of aircraft, no other form of mechanical transport, and no structure or installation within any such area.‚Äù To be kept in as close to a pristine natural state as possible, these areas would only be open to hikers and backpackers, who would be expected to follow low-impact, ‚ÄúLeave No Trace‚Äù camping practices.16 U.S.C. 1131-1136 Legislative History What would become Public Law 94-567 was introduced into the House on April 9, 1976 by North Carolina Democrat Roy Taylor. The bill, H.R. 13160 (94th), would have 19 co-sponsors in the House, including New Mexico Republican Manuel Lujan Jr., and Arizona Democrat Morris Udall, both of whom would successfully sponsor important Wilderness laws the next year. Passing through the House Committee on Natural Resources, the bill passed the House on September 20, 1976 and was sent to the Senate. The bill was approved, with changes, on October 1, 1976 and sent back to the House for approval, which came the same day. Passed by both Houses, the bill was signed by President Gerald Ford on October 20, 1976.https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/94/hr13160 Section I The first section of the law established designated Wilderness Areas in certain units of the National Park System. These new areas included: Black Canyon of the Gunnison, Colorado * 23,267 acres in Bandelier National Monument in New Mexico * 11,180 acres in the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Monument in Colorado * 9,440 acres in the Chiricahua National Monument in Arizona * 33,450 acres in the Great Sand Dunes National Monument in Colorado * 19,270 acres in the Haleakala National Monument in Hawaii * 131,850 acres in Isle Royale National Park in Michigan * 429,690 acres in the Joshua Tree National Monument in California * 8,100 acres in the Mesa Verde National Monument in Colorado * 12,952 acres in the Pinnacles National Monument in California * 71,400 acres in the Saguaro National Monument in Arizona * 25,370 acres in the Point Reyes National Seashore in California * 64,250 acres in the Badlands National Monument in South Dakota * 79,019 acres in the Shenandoah National Park in Virginia Section II The second section of the law ordered that maps and legal descriptions of each Wilderness Area should be available for public inspection in the office of the Director of the National Park Service, and with the superintendent of the parent unit of each new Wilderness, and, as soon as practicable, with the Interior and Insular Affairs Committees of both the House and Senate. The law further ordered that the maps and descriptions submitted should have the same force and effect as if they had been included in this law. Section III Noted that all of the areas named above would be considered as Wilderness Areas as soon as the Secretary of the Interior published a bulletin in the Federal Register stating that all activities prohibited in Wilderness Areas, such as development, consumptive activities, etc. had ceased. Section IV Pinnacles National Monument Authorized the addition of certain lands to the Isle Royale National Seashore in Michigan and Pinnacles National Monument in California. This section also ordered the Secretary of the Interior, as responsible official for the National Park Service, to attempt to obtain these additional lands by donation, purchase, transfer, or exchange, and authorized an appropriation of no more than $955,000 for their acquisition. Section V This section of the law addressed an issue concerning Wilderness Areas in U. S. Forest Service administered lands by instructing the Secretary of Agriculture, as responsible official for the Forest Service to review a 62,930 acre area of the Coronado National Forest in Arizona known as the Rincon Wilderness Study Area for its potential designation as a Wilderness Area.

Europol believes that having many people trying to identify the objects will expedite the investigative process, allowing individual law enforcement agencies to identify perpetrators and victims of child abuse faster. Individuals may submit information about objects anonymously without further contact from Europol or other law enforcement agencies. Europol's Victim Identification Task Force established the Trace an Object website as part of an overall effort to curb abuse crimes and human trafficking.  History  Europol launched the Stop Child Abuse ‚Äì Trace an Object campaign via a dedicated web page on 31 May 2017, at Europol's headquarters in the Hague, Netherlands. The impetus for the campaign was an overall rise in child pornography, including perpetrators' use of the dark web to facilitate their illegal distribution of child pornography material and the recent history of investigators' ability to solve similar crimes because of details such as logos. On launch day, the web page showed 20 images for possible identification by the public. By 12 June 2017, Europol had received 10,000 contributions (information about an image displayed on the Trace an Object site) from the public. Since launching the site in May 2017, Europol has had success in tracing several of the objects and locations depicted.

Background Davis was born Frances Hope Hale on November 2, 1903 in Iowa City, Iowa, the fifth and youngest child of Hal Hale, a school superintendent, and Frances McFarland, a teacher. Her father died young, and her mother remarried to John Overholt. When her stepfather died, too, Davis and her mother moved to Washington, D.C. There, Davis studied at the new Corcoran School of Art and George Washington University, as well as Cincinnati University and the Portland School of Art. She did not obtain a college degree. Career In 1924, Davis became assistant to the Stuart Walker Repertory Company's art director, for whom she painted scenery and designed costumes. In 1926, she moved to New York City, where she worked in advertising as a secretary at the Frank Presbrey Agency. There, she wrote copy and sold drawings. She left to become a freelance writer, publishing stories in magazines such as Collier's, The New Yorker, and Bookman. In 1929, she became promotion manager for Life magazine. In 1931, she founded and edited Love Mirror, a women's pulp magazine. In February 1933, she moved to Washington, D.C., where she worked on the Consumers' Counsel of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) under Frederic C. Howe. Her third husband, German economist Karl Brunck, worked for the National Recovery Administration. She joined the Soviet spy ring called the \\"Ware Group\\", as recounted later in her memoir. In 1934, one group meeting included J. Peters, Lee Pressman, Marion Bachrach, and John Abt. Other members included Harold Ware, Charles Kramer, Alger Hiss, Nathaniel Weyl, Laurence Duggan, Harry Dexter White, Abraham George Silverman, Nathan Witt, Julian Wadleigh, Henry Collins, and Victor Perlo. After Brunck's death, Davis returned to New York City, where she worked as a freelance writer, crafting short stories with underlying Communist themes. During her years married to Robert Gorham Davis, she edited his work while writing herself for Redbook and Town & Country, and New Leader magazines. In 1954, she identified her husband Robert Gorham Davis to the FBI as a communist, along with Len De Caux and his wife, Herman Brunce, John and Elizabeth Donovan, Harold Ware, Charles Kramer and his wife, John Abt and his wife Jessica Smith Ware Abt and his sister Marion Bachrach, Donald Hiss, Jacob Golos, Joseph Freeman, and Joe Currant, along with Pressman, Perlo, Silverman, Collins, Witt, and Alger Hiss. In 1983-84 she was a fellow at the Bunting Institute at Radcliffe College. In 1985, she received an invitation to remain as a visiting scholar. She taught a class in writing from 1985 until a month before her death. Seminar titles included \\"How to Keep a Journal\\" and \\"Autobiography as Detective Story.\\" Personal life Davis briefly married her first husband, vaudeville scenery designer George Patrick Wood. In 1932, Davis married second husband, British journalist (and Communist) Claud Cockburn. They did not live together and divorced in 1934 when Cockburn purportedly abandoned Davis while she was pregnant. Their daughter was Claudia Cockburn (died 1998), who married British performer Michael Flanders (died 1975) and had two daughters, journalists Stephanie and Laura Flanders. In 1934, she married German economist and Communist Karl Hermann Brunck, who suffered a breakdown and entered a mental institution for treatment by psychologist Frieda Fromm-Reichmann. He committed suicide in 1937. In 1939, she left the Communist Party over the Hitler-Stalin Pact, though she remained a \\"committed leftist\\". Over the same international incident, Whittaker Chambers met with New Dealer Adolf A. Berle and named Davis as a member of the Ware Group, although he did not cite her name during subpoenaed testimony before HUAC on August 3, 1948. That same year, she married fellow Communist, professor, and literary critic Robert Gorham Davis (died 1998), whom she met during a congress of the League of American Writers; the couple had two children, Stephen and Lydia. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Davises lived on the Upper West Side of New York City and were friends with Bernard Malamud, Lionel Trilling, and Diana Trilling. In the 1970s, they moved to Connecticut. In 1983, they moved to Boston after she received a fellowship from Radcliffe. Death Hope Hale Davis died of pneumonia in Boston on October 2, 2004, at age 100. Legacy At her death, the Guardian called her an \\"American author who defied social conventions with her feminist, leftwing beliefs.\\" The New York Sun called her a \\"semi-regretful ex-communist.\\" Davis' 1994 memoir recounts her membership in and details of the Soviet infiltration apparatus called the 1930s \\"Ware Group,\\" controlled by J. Peters, founded by Harold Ware, and run successively by Ware, Whittaker Chambers, and Victor Perlo. Her book served as a major source for a biography of J. Peters by scholar Thomas L. Sakmyster. Her papers include correspondence with numerous communists, New York intellectuals, and even Ware Group members, including Malcolm Cowley, Alfred Kazin, Philip Roth, Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., Diana Trilling, Sylvia Townsend Warner, and Nathaniel Weyl. (The online reference leaves out reference to most Ware Group members, however, including J. Peters, Harold Ware, Whittaker Chambers, and those named by Chambers before HUAC in August 1948.)

The area is part of the Mount Rogers Cluster. Location and access The wilderness is on the southeast side of the Mount Rogers National Recreation Area, near the town of Konnarock in Grayson and Smyth Counties. It is bounded by Whitetop Road (SR 600) on the west, Laurel Valley Road (SR 603) on the north, and Pine Mountain on the southeast.General Information: Wilderness.net - Lewis Fork Wilderness - General Information, accessdate: June 10, 2017 The Appalachian Trail passes in an out of the wilderness for a total 5.5 miles in the wilderness.

Rogers Wild PoniesHabitats created by high elevations, extended slopes and streams support a large biological diversity. The wilderness and surrounding country are considered one of the most important centers for biological diversity in the eastern United States. Besides the oak-hickory forest common in eastern deciduous woodlands, a variety of forest communities include cove forests in rich, moist secluded areas; northern hardwood forests on upper slopes; and seeps, wet places supplied by water from an underground aquifer. Mount Rogers - Spruce-Fir ForestFrazer firs on the summit of Mt. Rogers are beginning to decline because of infestation by the balsam woolly adelgid, an exotic insect pest. Streams in the area have been recognized for their high water quality. Wild natural trout streams in Virginia are classified by the Department of Game and Inland Fisheries by their water quality, with class i the highest and class iv the lowest.9VAC25-260-370.

Grayson Highlands State Park, adjacent to the wilderness, contains balds, large open grassy areas at a high elevation with good views in many directions. Ponies have been introduced into the highlands and allowed to run wild while grazing the balds. Topography Mount Rogers is a roundish knob with multiple ridges radiating in all directions. Wilburn Ridge, Cabin Ridge and Briar Ridge are on the south side of Pine Mountain, Elk Ridge is on the north side of Pine Mountain, and Elk Garden Ridge is on the west.

Chris Tabron mixed the song at Rumours Studios in New York City, and was assisted by Peter Geiser. The track was mastered by Dave Kutch at The Mastering Palace in New York. In an interview with iHeartRadio, MNDR explained that the song is about \\"celebrating life, dancing, individuality, differences, fierceness, and sometimes 'Swerlk' is even a shoulder to cry on\\". She further said that it \\"is not only a dance floor anthem, but it is a way of life, a mindset, and a show of solidarity.\\" MNDR conceived the song in honor of the one-year anniversary of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting.

The project was later joined by GLAAD as an additional partner, which was \\"excited to be able to add an uplifting and fun message to what is also such a serious time for our community\\".

On the same day, a lyric video for the song premiered on Vevo. Commenting the release, Rich Ferraro from GLAAD stated, \\"Music has the power to uplift and unite people and the Scissor Sisters and MNDR have always done that for the LGBTQ community.

She worked at Fidel Castro's headquarters in Havana as a translator and public relations worker in 1959 and 1960. After leaving Cuba, Cobb continued working for the CIA in Guatemala and Mexico. She was the first CIA asset to relay an account of Lee Harvey Oswald having attended a twist party in Mexico City weeks before the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Earlier in the 1950s, Cobb was involved with the production and trafficking of narcotics with her Colombian fianc√© and his twin brother. She later provided information to the US Federal Bureau of Narcotics that led to arrests in Cuba and Colombia. Cobb was fluent in Spanish, notably translating Castro's \\"History Will Absolve Me\\" speech and former Guatemalan president Juan Jos√© Ar√©valo's short story The Shark and the Sardines. Early life and education Viola June Cobb was born on August 24, 1927 in Ponca City, Oklahoma to Jasper E. Cobb and Jesse Lois Sharp. She graduated from Ponca City High School, and went on to attend University of Oklahoma for one year in the mid-1940s. She then worked at a Ponca City radio station and for a local newspaper as a courthouse reporter. She was an adjunct of the Civil Air Patrol squadron in Norman, Oklahoma, attaining the rank of 2nd class Lieutenant. Travels to Mexico and Colombia After leaving the University of Oklahoma, Cobb traveled to Mexico, where she met Rafael Herran Olozaga, who was from a wealthy and politically-connected Colombian family. Both his great-grandfather, Pedro Alc√°ntara Herr√°n, and his great-great-grandfather, Tom√°s Cipriano de Mosquera, had served as Presidents of Colombia. His family disapproved of the relationship, considering Cobb beneath his station. They were later engaged. Cobb took extension classes with Olozaga at the National University in Mexico City in 1947. In Mexico, she worked for an oil firm in public relations. She also edited Modern Mexico, a Mexican Chamber of Commerce publication. In 1948, Cobb traveled with Olozaga and his twin brother Tomas to Colombia. The brothers had plans to cultivate and traffic opium. By 1949, they were on a six-month expedition in the Ecuadorian jungle where they were engaged in cocaine production. Cobb worked for Pan American Airways and was a public relations employee in Guayaquil, Ecuador. Six months later, Cobb was back in Colombia. She returned to Oklahoma in 1950 and spent around ten months living with her father, working as a news reporter in Kay County. Cobb returned to Colombia in 1951 and contracted leishmaniasis,Summary of her medical record from first attack of tropical fever, HSCA Segregated CIA Collection (microfilm - reel 11: June Cobb), October 20, 1960, p. 2. a rare tropical disease. She returned to the United States for treatment, spending several months hospitalized at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. After she recovered, she spent five months working at the hospital as an administrative assistant for Dr. Isidore Snapper. In early 1952, Cobb began a relationship with the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. During the summer of 1952, she was employed with Time magazine in their letters department. Cobb then moved to Chicago and worked as a secretary again for Snapper, who was now the director of medical education at Cook County Hospital. Cobb returned to New York City in 1953 and found work as an interpreter and translator. Her friend Warren Broglie,Broglie was also a CIA informant. manager of the Waldorf Astoria, referred clients to her. Towards the end of 1953, Cobb worked briefly for Foster Wheeler, a firm that was building a refinery in Colombia. In the summer of 1954, Cobb was treated for agranulocytosis at Beth-El Hospital in New York. By 1955, Cobb was traveling in Latin America. In 1956, she worked for the Colombian-American Culture Foundation in Medellin and taught briefly at the American school. In December 1956, the Olozaga brothers were arrested in Havana for possession and distribution of heroin. The pair were apprehended by Cuban law enforcement officials, with the assistance of US FBN agents, a day after Cobb had left Cuba for Coral Gables, Florida. Cobb had traveled with the brothers to Havana to help them sell several grams of heroin and several ounces of cocaine. The brothers were released quickly, owing to their family connections. In a joint operation of the FBN and the Colombian Intelligence Service, the brothers were arrested again in Medellin, Colombia in February 1957 for running a cocaine laboratory on their parents' estate. FBN agent George Gaffney later recalled that the 1957 operation originated in New Orleans when \\"a woman with CIA connections offered information\\" to an agent. In 1957, Cobb briefly worked as a secretary for county attorney Ralph Haynes. For a time in 1958, Cobb was acquainted with Dimitre Dimitrov, a Bulgarian politician who had been imprisoned in Greece and interrogated by the CIA as part of Project ARTICHOKE. By 1959, Cobb had moved to New York City. She lived briefly at the Hotel Iroquois. Involvement with Cuba =Meeting Castro= Cobb visited Havana in February 1959 and later recounted meeting with Fidel Castro's Minister of Health regarding their campaign against vice and cooperation with doctors from Bolivia, Peru, and Colombia against the use of coca leaves. During her trip she was given a copy of Castro's 1953 \\"History Will Absolve Me\\" speech. When she returned to the United States, she set about translating the speech to English. Cuban journalist Luis Conte Ag√ºero learned of the translation and visited Cobb in New York. He wrote a prologue for the booklet and assisted with printing costs. After Castro was sworn in as Cuba's Prime Minister, he visited the United States in April 1959. One evening in New York, Cobb accompanied Ag√ºero to the Statler Hotel where she was introduced to Castro. She had brought a copy of the translated speech. Castro was pleased when he saw the booklet she had made and ordered a print run of 1,000 copies to be made and distributed in New York. Cobb also met Castro's private secretary Celia S√°nchez, who invited her to Havana to work under Castro in the Ministry Office. =Working for Castro= Cobb agreed, traveling to Cuba afterwards. Her duties in Havana included translating Castro's speeches and working as a public relations assistant. She also translated Castro's new land reform laws into English. She worked on the 18th floor, down the hall from Castro's office. She and William Alexander Morgan were the only Americans to gain any sort of influence in the new regime. Cobb returned to the United States in June 1959, and again for medical treatment in September and December of that year. While recuperating from surgery, Cobb stayed at a beach house owned by Castro and S√°nchez. Cobb disagreed with Castro openly over his turn to authoritarianism and Marxism, her anger becoming evident as the Communist influence on him became obvious. Cobb had hoped that a cessation in the US bombing of Cuban cane fields would prevent Castro's turn towards dictatorship. In early 1960, during Castro's second trip to New York, tabloids reported that 17-year-old Marita Lorenz had been raped by the Cuban leader. She was pregnant, and Cobb later said that the father was Castro's bodyguard, Jesus Yanez Pelletier. Lorenz's mother later reported that Cobb had called her and offered her employment if she would return to Cuba with her daughter. Che Guevara conducted an investigation of the incident and Cobb was included in a roundup of the suspects. She was protected by Castro and S√°nchez, but the relationship cooled and she lost the access she had had before. =CIA recruitment= CIA agent Harry Hermsdorf, undercover as a European journalist in Cuba, first met Cobb in the Havana Hilton's hotel coffee shop while having coffee with Jorge Losada, the editor of Vision, a Latin American magazine. Losada introduced Cobb to Hermsdorf, who was using the alias Heinrich Heubner. Following a brief conversation, Cobb agreed to arrange meetings with Cuban officials for Hermsdorf and Der Spiegel correspondent Claus Jacobi. From May 24‚Äì26, 1960, Cobb met with Hermsdorf, who evaluated her at her hotel. Without mentioning the CIA, he offered her a long-term employment opportunity and invited her to meet him somewhere outside of Cuba. They arranged to meet at the Drake Hotel in New York on June 3. Cobb traveled to the United States in early June 1960. She also stopped in Washington, D.C., where she stayed at the Raleigh Hotel. The CIA arranged surveillance of her hotel room and of a polygraph that she took. Cobb made a verbal agreement to work for the CIA and returned to Havana on June 7, and was to be paid 200 Cuban pesos per month plus expenses. Jean T. Pierson was designated her CIA handler. Hermsdorf asked Cobb to monitor the activities of the chief of Prensa Latina and the head of the Free China News Agency. He also requested that she determine what Antonio N√∫√±ez Jim√©nez had accomplished on his recent trip to the Soviet Union and pass on the \\"names and contacts of Soviet and satellite citizens\\" who dealt with the Cuban government. In a June CIA memo from Hermsdorf, he wrote \\"If Miss Cobb can be controlled and accepts steering, it would perhaps be desirable to mould her into a long-range asset by having her become very cozy with the communist leaders and become, overtly, ever more 'rabid' about the revolutionary movement. Later she could perhaps be used elsewhere in Latin America, probably among the rabid left wing youth groups that are becoming increasingly anti-American and more powerful in various areas.\\" Cobb left Cuba in September 1960, and on September 12 formalized her contract with the CIA, which stipulated that she received $200 each month for a year-long operation, called JMARC, \\"to penetrate the Cuban government in an effort to obtain information on present and planned activities of the Castro regime.\\" Cobb was given the cryptonym AMUPAS-1.Cobb's aliases included \\"Clarinda E. Sharpe\\" and \\"Joyce Pineinch\\". From September 21 to 29, the CIA maintained surveillance of Cobb's hotel room in New York City. Cobb was acquainted with Kennedy advisor Richard N. Goodwin, and soon had direct access to the White House through him. While in Havana, one more than one occasion, Cobb met with CIA operative David S√°nchez Morales at the house of Geraldine Shamma. Cobb's first CIA operation involved befriending CBS newscaster Richard Gibson, a co-founder of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. Cobb determined that Gibson had made a trip to Cuba, met with Castro and Osvaldo Dortic√≥s Torrado, and received money for operating expenses and to maintain the FPCC New York office. In later testimony, Cobb said that she had firsthand knowledge that Cuba was funding the committee. During 1961, Gibson wrote a number of letters to Cobb. Guatemala Around 1961, alongside Raul Osegueda, Cobb translated former Guatemalan President Juan Jos√© Ar√©valo's 1956 allegory The Shark and the Sardines to English. From Mexico, Cobb assisted Guatemalan revolutionaries fighting Miguel Yd√≠goras Fuentes, helping them obtain equipment. She was deported by the Guatemalan police on November 9, 1961. CIA Mexico City cables related that Cobb was deported with Achilles Centeno Perez. Guatemalan border officials told them they would be killed if they returned to the country. Cobb's entry to Mexico was assisted by George Frederick Munro, whose family maintained a ranch in Cuernavaca that Cobb said she visited several times. Munro advised Cobb against returning to Guatemala, where she wanted to complete an undisclosed task on behalf of the CIA. Appearance before Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security In March 1962, Cobb was called to testify before an executive session of the Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security. Prior to her appearance, She did not reveal her association with the CIA and members of the subcommittee appeared unaware of the fact. An August 12, 1962 article by Jack Anderson in Parade magazine painted Cobb as a \\"soldier of fortune\\", detailing her time working for Castro and her involvement with drug trafficking in Latin America. Mexico City In June 1963, the CIA reapproved Cobb as an informant for WH/3-Mexico D.F., despite an October 1962 CIA security memo recommending no contact with her other than assessment. Later that year, Cobb was transferred to Mexico City and her cryptonym was changed to LICOOKY-1. Cobb then moved to Mexico City. She was a CIA asset for the Mexico City station, reporting to David Atlee Phillips. Warren Broglie, who was then managing Hotel Luma, passed information to Cobb that she relayed to station chief Winston M. Scott. When she was in need of a residence, her friend Eunice Odio suggested she call Elena Garro. Following the assassination of John F. Kennedy by Lee Harvey Oswald, and the release of the Warren Report, Cobb was privy to a conversation between Elena Garro, her sister Deva Guerrero, and her daughter. They expressed surprise at seeing Oswald's face in the newspapers, as they said they recognized him from a twist party at the home of Rub√©n Dur√°n. They said that he was accompanied by two other men who looked like beatniks. In an October 5 report, Cobb informed the CIA of the conversation. Cobb wanted the women to tell American authorities what they knew, but advised them against going to the American embassy, instead suggesting that they go to Texas.On December 25, Sra. De Paz again discussed at considerable length her alleged encounter with Oswald..., Assassination Records Review Board. December 25, 1965. pp. 5‚Äì6. Cobb was asked to leave Garro's home after their cat's back legs were found broken. Oswald had checked out a copy of The Shark and the Sardines from the Dallas Public Library on about November 6, 1963. The book had not been returned. As of December 1965, Cobb was roommates with Eunice Odio. In 1965 and 1966, Cobb set up Milton Abramson, a New York-based drug trafficker, Adela Castillo, and others for arrest by the FBI in the United States. Death Cobb lived at a Manhattan senior center prior to her death on October 17, 2015. CIA files The CIA's extensive file on Cobb is estimated to include over 2,500 pages. Following the Kennedy assassination, all of the documents related to Cobb's work with the Federal Bureau of Narcotics were marked secret. Following the passage of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, many of the documents have been declassified. Some of the Warren Commission's declassified files indicate that the CIA, in the late 1970s, refused to help House Select Committee on Assassinations investigators locate Cobb for an interview about Oswald's activities in Mexico. Further documents concerning Cobb that are related to the assassination were scheduled to be released under the JFK Records Act in October 2017. The National Archives and Records Administration announced that it was preparing a 221-page file of documents related to Cobb.

It was a TubeSat which was developed by the students from the school Tancredo Almeida Neves, in Ubatuba (SP), with support for the picosat platform made by Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE), adapting and integration to launch provided by TuPOD from Italian company GAUSS Srl and by Ag√™ncia Espacial Brasileira (AEB).  Project  The idea was proposed by math teacher C√¢ndido Oswaldo de Moura, inspired in a video called \\"TubeSats\\" and kits to build personal satellites developed by the company Interorbital Systems, in the United States. To start the project, the teacher contacted the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE), where, later, he was followed by another teacher to receive training and be able to help the students. The material to construct the satellite sponsored by a salesclerk of Ubatuba and the launch was possible with help of AEB. The satellite was named ‚ÄúTancredo-1‚Äù after the school.  Characteristics  The picosatellite was 13 cm long and has a mass of 570 grams. It has five plaques in its structure. Solar arrays in the cylinder are responsible for powering the components of Tancredo-1. Some space exists inside the satellite what can be used for small scientific experiments in space, in the case of Tancredo-1, two payloads were used: one voice recorder for radio-amateurs, educational payload and one simplified Langmuir probe to study the formation of plasma bubbles in the ionosphere. The Langmuir probe was made by National Institute for Space Research. The platform tubesat passed by a total re-engineering from the work to Mestrado em Engenharia de Sistemas Espaciais Eng. Auro Tikami from INPE with orientation of Walter Abrah√£o dos Santos ‚Äì INPE. Almost 100 students took part in the project with the job of welding pieces and building electric circuits. It orbited the Earth from 310 km. The satellite suffered orbital decay and burnt up in the atmosphere.

It features James Harden of the Houston Rockets as its cover athlete and was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on September 15, 2017.https://www.easports.com/nba-live/nba-live-18-james-harden The game is the 21st installment in the NBA Live series, and the follow-up to 2015's NBA Live 16 after EA took a year off between games. Though still receiving some criticism for its gameplay, the game was noted as an improvement over recent installments, and became the highest rated game of the series since NBA Live 10, according to Metacritic. Features NBA Live 18 features Houston Rockets guard James Harden as the cover athlete. Harden previously shared the cover of NBA 2K16 with Steph Curry and Anthony Davis. The game includes an \\"UltimateTeam\\" mode that allows players to draft different players to create a custom roster, similar to EA's Madden NFL franchise. It is the first basketball video game to feature a full WNBA roster. It features a single- player career mode called \\"The One,\\" similar to 2K Sports' \\"MyCareer\\" mode. In this mode, the created player has the chance of taking their skills across leagues and even join the NBA Draft and Combine which features over the top analysis from segments of ESPN First Take hosted by Max Kellerman and Stephen A. Smith. In them, they give their open minds in opinion in the direction the player is going to progress through the mode. The game mode allows players to experience basketball life on and off the court with more clothes and a Game Face app for iOS and Android devices, allowing players to scan their face and insert it into the game. =Soundtrack= On August 8, 2017, EA Sports announced the soundtrack for the game, which would feature 31 songs, including Kendrick Lamar, Kid Cudi, Lil Uzi Vert and Rick Ross. The soundtrack was also made available for streaming on Spotify.  Release  NBA Live 18 was released on September 15, 2017, several days before its rival, 2K Sports' NBA 2K18. In order to compete with 2K, EA announced all players who pre-order the game would receive the game for $39, compared to the standard $59 cost.  Reception  NBA Live 18 received \\"average\\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Many critics noted the game as an improvement over its predecessors, but wrote the gameplay still had room for improvement. In a positive review of the game, Chris Roling of Bleacher Report wrote: \\"Here, casual means good fun. It feels as accessible as a basketball game should and is a step or two ahead of what many fans might have anticipated for a game following up on an outright cancellation.\\" EGMNow gave the game 7.5/10, writing: \\"NBA Live 18 has improved in almost every way over its predecessor, making a strong case for its continued existence.

Taking part in the show's fifth season, which aired in 2006, Gonz√°lez had attempted to convince his parents to allow him to audition for two straight years before he was allowed to present himself at the castings.

The self-taught pianist and vocalist was in love with the sounds of salsa and Latin pop, known to his family as \\"el gitanillo que canta boleros.\\" During the competition Jorge relied heavily on composers like Luis Miguel and Juan Luis Guerra for repertoire, ultimately achieving eighth place. Though not the winner, Jorge left Operaci√≥n Triunfo with significant exposure and a large enough fan base that he was offered a contract with Universal's Vale Music label.

Today it is state owned and it houses two museums: one of the historic apartments (ground floor and first floor) and the Museum of Still Life (second floor). The villa is perhaps the best example of architecture commissioned by Lorenzo il Magnifico, in this case to Giuliano da Sangallo towards 1480. It is no coincidence that this is a private building, where there are elements that later modeled for the future developments of the type of villas: internal and external penetration through filters such as loggias, symmetrical distribution of environments around a central salon (\\"Centrifugal\\" space), dominant position in the landscape, conscious recovery of classical architectural elements (such as the barrel vault and the ionic temple facade).Pierluigi De Vecchi and Elda Cerchiari, The Times of Art, Volume 2, Bompiani, Milan 1999.  History  = Fifteenth Century = The villa is located in the middle of a hilltop, the last offshoot of the Montalbano mountains, in a strategic position, lying on the promontory towards the Ombrone river and the plain and dominating the road between Florence and Pistoia, which overwhelms the small heights here. It was built by Lorenzo de' Medici after buying a rustic farm from Giovanni Rucellai, who in turn had bought what was then a simple fortress from Palla Strozzi, built by the Cancellieri family of Pistoia at the beginning of the fifteenth century. After a period of intensive land acquisition by the Medici family, in the area of Poggio a Caiano and also on the other bank of the Ombrone River, at Tavola, between 1470 and 1474, Lorenzo commissioned Giuliano da Sangallo to build a villa that became the prototype of the country's noble residences in the following centuries. In fact, Lorenzo, through his favorite architect, was among the first to conceive of an agrarian space in which the territory was ordered and shaped according to the requirements of harmony. At that time it began to set the idea of the villa-fortress (like the Medici Villa of Careggi, more like a castle made only thirty years ago by Michelozzo for Cosimo the Elder, the grandfather of Lorenzo). This new aptitude was due to political issues, thanks to the period of peace and stability reached by Lorenzo's politics, and philosophical, according to the humanists. Among the innovations of the era, the porch was placed on the ground floor (almost an interconnected area between the surrounding landscape and the villa), the classic porch and pediment on the noble floor and the lack of a central courtyard. Gradually the villa was enriched with works in a 'continuum' between architecture, painting and sculpture. The fresco of Filippino Lippi dates back to the period under the loggia on the first floor and perhaps the glazed majolica pediment attributed to Andrea Sansovino (some historians refer to a second constructive step). Giuliano da Sangallo is another building within the estate: It is a square and bastioned structure at the central court, called \\"Cascine\\" located on the other shore of the Umbrella and which, as a center of agricultural activity, built before the villa, was its ideal counterweight in the overall territorial design. At the death of Lorenzo in 1492 the work at the villa was still largely unfinished and was halted between 1495 and 1513 because of the exile of the Medici from Florence. The villa was complete only for a third, the base (Ttura) with the already complete porch and the floor planks on the first floor of the vault of the vault that had to cover the central salon. = Sixteenth Century = Eleanor of Toledo enters Poggio a Caiano, Fresco of Giovanni Stradano in Palazzo Vecchio Between 1513 and 1520, after the return of the Medici, the works were completed on the initiative of the son of Lorenzo the Magnificent, Giovanni, who had in the meantime became Pope Leo X. Giuliano da Sangallo, now an old man, was able to follow the work only occasionally and until 1516, the year of his death. However, the works continued according to his plan, probably also documented by a wooden model. The vault of the central hall on the first floor was made with the papal coat of arms (which was then referred to as Leo X's Lion), under the direction of Andrea di Cosimo Feltrini and Franciabigio. From the beginning, the large barrel vault had caused concern, from the beginning, by the buyers, who feared a collapse. This fear was allayed by Sebastiano Ximenes because of the work on his own Palazzo Ximenes da Sangallo in Florence. Already in Leo X's day, the frescoes of the salon were started by the greatest Florentine masters of the time: Pontormo, Andrea del Sarto and the Franciscan himself. The paintings were completed some fifty years later by Alessandro Allori, with a rethinking of the original project in a more monumental key, giving more space to the figures than to painted architectures. The villa was the place where foreign brides of the family members in Florence were welcomed. Here, among other events, were the weddings of Alessandro de' Medici and Margaret of Austria (1536), between Cosimo I and Eleanor of Toledo (1539), Francesco I and Bianca Cappello already his lover (1579). Bianca and Francesco also found death in this villa, for causes not fully clarified and suspected of poisoning. = Seventeenth and Eighteenth Century = In 1661 came to Florence Marguerite Louise d'Orl√©ans, Cousin of Louis XIV and wife of Cosimo III. The princess, profoundly different from Cosimo's dark and ultra-religious character, and above all overwhelmed by the Grand Duke's Vittoria della Rovere, was actually relegated to Poggio a Caiano. In order to alleviate the \\"captivity\\", in addition to the follow-up of some 150 people, he built the theater on the ground floor before returning permanently to France in 1675. There were often comedies in the theatrical theater and here he had assembled a very unique collection called the Cabinet of Works in Small of All The Most Famous Painters. It was a picture gallery set in a single room of the villa, which contained 174 paintings of as many different painters, the largest of which measured 100x75 cm, and which included works by some of the most important authors, D√ºrer, Leonardo da Vinci, Raffaello Sanzio, Rubens and so on. Today it is no longer admirable because it was dissected in 1773 by Habsburg- Lorraine. The Cabinet Room was frescoed by Sebastiano Ricci with an Allegory of the Arts, but this work has also been lost in subsequent renovations. The monumental organ of the Roman Lorenzo Testa (1703), already in Palazzo Pitti and today in the theater, is the result of Ferdinand's desire. The necessary maintenance work and periodic restoration were carried out, though, according to their economic strategy, they intended to resize their landholdings: they began to no longer use some villas (such as the Ambrogiana and Lappeggi), bringing the furnishings into Palazzo Pitti and the surviving residences. Poggio a Caiano did not suffer this fate, and only a few furnishings testify to that period, such as the small wooden chest of drawers with inlays depicting views and landscapes. The architects Giuseppe and Giovan Battista Ruggeri cared for a general restoration, with the renovation of the theater and the affixing of a clock on the facade. At the time of Ferdinand III of Tuscany, the park in front of the villa was equipped with some fun facilities: a \\"flying arcana\\", a swing, a \\"donkey rider\\" and a \\"carousel of horses\\", which are still stored in a store. = Nineteenth Century = Concerts held at the theater of the villa included Giovanni Paisello, Etienne Nicolas M√©hul and Gaspare Spontini. The frescoes of neoclassical Luigi Catani are in this hallway in the entrance hall on the first floor and in seventeen rooms of the villa, to which various guided artists collaborated Always from Catani. Detail of the Diana Temple in the English garden Always on commission by Elisa Baciocchi, in 1811 Giuseppe Manetti designed new English Gardens, featuring irregular avenues, a pond, and small neoclassical pavilions, such as a conical glacier and a temple of Diana. The project was only completed later and partially. With the restoration (1819) repairs and restoration work continued (especially in the garden where the lemonaia was built, solemn work by Pasquale Poccianti, and English park was completed. In the 1828 the sundials were arranged on the sides of the building, while the interior of the villa was updated with fine furnishings from the royal palaces of Modena, Piacenza, Parma, Torino, Lucca and Bologna, into the heritage of the new unitary kingdom. = 20th Century and Contemporary Era = During the Second World War, the villa was used as a haven for bombing for important works of art from all over Tuscany, such as the statues of Michelangelo or Monument of the Four Moors of Livorno, etc. In addition, during the passage of the forehead, he took shelter for the displaced population who took refuge in the large underground subdivisions of this period:.M. Attucci, L. Corsetti, S. Gelli, P. Gennai (ed.), Days of War Time (Poggio a Caiano, June‚ÄìOctober 1944) Diary of Ermanno Cecchi, Municipality of Poggio a Caiano, 2005. In 1984 it became a national museum and since then it has begun an important restoration cycle, where thanks to a precious inventory dated 1911, the interior of the villa was re-constructed as much as possible, recovering all the objects, furniture and artwork scattered among the various museums and state depots. In the villa and in the gardens were filmed scenes of the movie Darling (1965) directed by John Schlesinger. The restoration was concluded in 2007 with the opening to the public of the second floor, where the Museum of Still Life was housed, in which the great paintings of Bartolomeo Bimbi As well as other works from the Medici villas of Castello, Topaia, Ambrogiana Other superintendence deposits. Topaia, the Ambrogiana and other depots of the superintendence. On the night of 6 March 2017, about 30 meters of the wall surrounding the villa grounds collapsed. Heavy rainfall had undermined its foundation. = Proposals for the future = The activity of researchers and restorers has now focused on the recovery to make it available to the public in other environments of the villa. Among them are the 17th-century Cucinone and the underground Criptoportico that link it to the villa. This environment is one of the best preserved examples of architecture tailored to the home needs of a court: it includes several rooms for laundry use and also a vegetable garden with aromatic herbs for use in kitchens. Along with the 'Ballroom Hall', once a playground, these rooms could be used for the exhibition of the eighteenth- century rides.  Description  =Exterior = The loggia between the two steps of the staircase The roof was modified when in the 1575 Alfonso Parigi replaced the gutter, where there was a walkway and a crowning with a railing with fires, with a sloping roof, also obtaining an elevation of the prospect that alters significantly the proportions of Sangallo's initial project. The windows that were initially crossed, that is, divided into four parts with a kind of central stone cross, were modified, according to a late-fifteenth century model invented by Baccio d'Agnolo. In the seventeenth century, however, the clock tower was added in axis with the central pediment.  Frieze  The triangle (white, blue and green) frieze that today is seen on the tympanum mantel on the main fa√ßade of the villa is a copy made in 1986 by the manufacturer Richard Ginori, while the original is in a room on the first floor of the villa. This work is 14 meters long and 22 feet long, 58 centimeters long, of uncertain attribution and dating. It is principally attributed to Andrea Sansovino regarding the construction phase of Lorenzo il Magnifico, as It refers to the theme of the return to the Age of gold, or performed by Giuliano da Sangallo or Bertoldo. Two phases, the second of which ended at the time of Leo X. The refined and emblematic theme could also represent the choice of souls according to Platonic myth. In any case, it is clear the nature of the expression of the complex initiatory climate, relating to the philosophical circle of Lorenzo, through a series of allegorical allegories, of evocative classicism. = Interior = The interior of the villa has undergone several transformations that have changed its original appearance over the years.  Ground floor  Behind the staircase, under the loggia surrounding the villa, where there are four Roman sarcophagi, you enter the apartments on the ground floor. This floor in the sixteenth century was considered still secondary to the noble floor, so the upgrading of these environments dates back mostly to the following centuries, with the exception of Bianca Cappello's apartments. The entrance hall is plastered in A light yellow color and contains some inscriptions on Vittorio Emanuele II and the plebiscite that united Tuscany to the nascent Kingdom of Italy. He subsequently entered the \\"Teatro delle Commedie\\", which was first created by 1675 Marguerite Louise d'Orl√©ans the little-known wife of Cosimo III. It was in fact relegated to Poggio a Caiano, and to alleviate his reclusive life he thought to make a theater, of which we have the first mention in 1697. The use of the theater became more frequent with Prince Fernando. The Billiard Hall is in the Savoyard style, with a frescoed ceiling as a pergola from which overlook cherubs and cupids while a cloth painting displays real signs of the House of Savoy.  Bianca Cappello Apartment  The Buontalenti fireplace Bianca Cappello's staircase To the right there is access to the Bianca Cappello apartments, where it is possible to perceive more clearly than elsewhere the Renaissance aspect of the villa. Bianca Cappello was a well- educated and sophisticated Venetian noblewoman who had a relationship with Grand Duke Francesco I. This secret relationship involving the ruler of the city, already married to Joanna of Austria, and a newly married woman, was one of the greatest scandals of the Renaissance and one of the most romantic pages of the Medici saga: even though the two lovers did everything to be covered, their story was a topic of rumors from the beginning. In Poggio a Caiano their history lived some of the most important moments, in fact here was relegated the woman, hated by the family and the Medici court all deployed with the legitimate bride, strategically removed from Florence. At first she was confined to a secondary villa on the heights of Poggio a Caiano called Il Cerretino, and on that occasion some popular fantasies arose, such as the existence of an underground corridor between the two villas that would allow the two lovers to meet secretly. With the death of Bianca's husband and Joanna, the two lovers could finally marry and spend at Poggio a Caiano some of the most beautiful moments of their married life. The Bianca Cappello apartments on the ground floor still testify to this connection with the villa. In the villa, the two of them also died in October 1587, one day away from the other: a 2004‚Äì2006 study speaks of arsenic intoxication in the tissues of the two, although it is not possible to understand whether it is a post-mortem treatment on some symbolic organs buried together in the Bonistallo Church. (The official chronicles speak of tertian fever.) In the first hall of these apartments, a simple anteroom, there are three paintings on a biblical subject attributed to Paolo Veronese: Moses and the Burning Bush, The Passage of the Red Sea and the Resurrection of Lazarus; Here after the restoration was also the Piet√† of Giorgio Vasari, coming from the chapel of the villa that today belongs to the local mercy mission. Following is the \\"room of the Camino\\" of the apartments of Bianca Cappello. The room, although eclectically restored in the 19th century, still retains the beautiful white marble fireplace, with the floor supported by two telamons carved with remarkable plastic strength. The paternity of the work has not yet been clarified, but the scope of creation is surely close to Bernardo Buontalenti, as evidenced by the elusiveness of the torso and the imaginatively corrugated heads. Perhaps they are attributable to the Alfonso Parigi in the villa 1575, who was engaged by Cerreto Guidi at the Medici villa with Buontalenti during the same period. A door at the same level leads to Bedroom of the Duchessa Bianca, covered with pressed papermaking, imitating the coramas (decorated leather panels) and neo-Renaissance furniture, the result of a complete reconstruction of the 1865 style (non-visitable). The stone staircase in Pietra serena, connected to the fireplace, connect two upper openings in the same room, which communicate these rooms with the upper level, where today there is the room of King Vittorio Emanuele II and where it was probably that of Francesco I.  Noble floor  Detail of the ceiling in the Leo X saloon On the first floor is the most interesting environment of the villa: the Leo X saloon, placed in the middle of the building and finished around 1513. According to Vasari the decoration of the vault belongs only in part to Sangallo, the rest would be the work of Franciabigio and Cosimo Feltrini. Fresco decoration is one of the most important pictorial cycles of the Mannerism period. On the first floor is the entrance hall (with monochrome paintings of the eighteenth century, by Luigi Catani, reproducing celebratory themes referring to the foundation of the Villa: the scenes depicted are Lorenzo the Magnificent who receives the villa's model from Giuliano da Sangallo and Agnolo Poliziano who crowns with laurel the bust of Homer. On the ceiling of the so-called Dining Room there is a large fresco, by Anton Domenico Gabbiani, depicting the work of Cosimo The Elder, father of the homeland. The painting dates back to 1698 and was commissioned by Prince Ferdinando III de' Medici. This hall was also known as Salone degli stucchi but the stuccos in question, with portraits of Medici within medallions and other decorations, were removed in 1812 because they were considered too redundant. Only in some periods of the year is decorated the table with the table carp drawings designed by Agnolo Bronzino between the 1533 and 1548, beautifully woven with silk and filaments of gold and silver. Completing the first floor is Vittorio Emanuele II's apartment with four rooms: Cloakroom, Studio, Reception Room and Bedroom, and that of Countess of Mirafiori, Rosa Vercellana, (the \\"Bella Rosina\\") consisting of three rooms with antique furniture. The Bella Rosina's room is decorated in particular with a four- poster bed and walls entirely covered with pink silk with floral motifs (1865), radiated draped so as to see a pre-existing neoclassical fresco at the center. The French bath, designed by the court architect Giuseppe Cacialli, was wanted by Elisa Bonaparte Baciocchi and involved the demolition of some of the older rooms. Today it is well preserved, with its marble basin with carvings and a sculpture of Venus and Love in a niche, in addition to the original toiletries. The two mythological frescoes depict Achilles immersed in the Lete River and Teti attends the departure of Achilles. In 1807, Poccianti designed, in addition to the exterior stairs, the internal staircase connecting the ground floor to the remaining floors of the building was also commissioned for some restoration work on the upper floor of the villa. In the same period there are also fresco paintings in some saloons, of a strictly neoclassical style, with subjects drawn from ancient mythology.  Renaissance frescos  Sacrifice of Laoco√∂n by Filippino Lippi Vertumnus and Pomona by Pontormo The most ancient fresco of the villa, belonging to the period of Lorenzo the Magnificent, is the so-called Sacrifice of Laoco√∂n (according to Halm's interpretation) by Filippino Lippi, kept under the loggia at the first floor, once detached for restoration and now relocated, though it is rather faded by weather. The fresco is quoted by Vasari as \\"A sacrifice, fresh, in a loggia that remained imperfect\\" and which would go back to before Lorenzo's death, or in any case completed by 1494. The dominant theme of the first constructive phase Was the interpretation of the ancient in modern and decorative style and this fresco testifies to The kernel, as well as the frieze of the tympanum, maybe of Andrea Sansovino and the first decorated lunette in the salon of Leo X, that of Pontormo. Between 1519 and 1521, Depicts the Roman deities of Vertumnus and Pomona embedded in an unusual classical landscape. Afterwards, the theme of decoration changed, probably due to the arrival in the house of the first noble titles of Lorenzo de' Medici, Duke of Urbino and Giuliano de' Medici, Duke of Nemours, and became the illustrations of the glories of the Medici family, to which they clearly mentions the official themes of the paintings, that is, the Stories of Roman History. Triumph of Caesar by Andrea del Sarto Between 1519 and 1521 he worked Andrea del Sarto, who painted the Triumph of Caesar, an allusion to the gifts received by Lorenzo the Magnificent from the Sultan of Egypt in 1487. The fresco finished about one-third of the surface of the wall where nearer to the outer wall there was a large column painted in the wall, which was later removed and the fresco built by Alessandro Allori, who appointed his signature With that of Andrea del Sarto near the boy with the turkey in the foreground. By the time the frame of the primitive fresco was re-emerged, cutting the scene in two, but was again hidden by recent restorations. More or less at the same time the Franciabigio realized in the wall diagonally opposite the Return of Cicero From Exile, a clear metaphor of Cosimo The Elder and his expulsion with the subsequent triumphal return to Florence. This fresco is dominated at the top by fantastic architectures featured in a rich landscape in aerial perspective. This scene was also enlarged by Aldi, and the original border is hidden from the porphyry obelisk that rises unusually close to the center of the representation to the top of the painting. The painted column was partly preserved in the fresco, in fact, the Allori inserted it beside the obelisk. Alessandro Allori was then the one who integrated it completed the decorative program of the Salon, and worked there between 1578 And 1582, more than fifty years after the commencement of the decorations of the other painters, was commissioned by Francesco I de' Medici, who lived in the villa in particular with his Venetian noblewoman Bianca Cappello. In addition to expanding the existing panels, he created two new ones: Numidia's Syphace Receiving Scipione, alluding to the journey Lorenzo the Magnificent made to Naples at Ferdinand II of Aragon; The Consul Flaminio speaks to the council of the Achaeans, in which he refers to the intervention of Lorenzo the Magnificent in the Dieta di Cremona. He also frescoed, with numerous aids, the two boxes above the portals, the second bezel With the Garden of the Hesperides and the space between the lunettes and the windows and the lunettes. The elaborate and fantastic compositions with floral, zoomorphic and anthropomorphic figures are typical of the taste for the whim that is typical of the time. Altori then created a magnificent architecture throughout the room, which almost contrasts with architecture realities, with figures that seem to be carved in their strong and crystalline colors typical of manierism, creating a magnificent and virtuoso scenery. Completed the pictorial decoration a superb series of tapestries wanted by Cosimo I and his son Francesco, drawing on Stradano before, and Allori then. There were numerous hunting scenes depicted, taking the inspiration from the real jumps that were held in the huge park around the villa (far bigger than today). However, it is not possible to admire them as a whole because the collection is now dispersed among some Florentine museums, deposits and embassies abroad.  Second floor  On the second floor, the \\"Museum of Still Life\\" is set up, which is unique in its kind and exhibits about 200 paintings dating from the late sixteenth to the middle of the eighteenth century and coming from the Medici collections. Many of these paintings, up to the opening of the Museum, were in the depots of the Polo Museale Fiorentino and other public bodies and thus largely visible to the general public for the first time. In a room there are 'papiers peints' of French manufacture, with an exotic theme of the early nineteenth century. The depicted views are wide-ranging with a line of low horizon and small characters depicting \\"Les sauvages de la Mer Pacifique\\" (1804).  The frieze room  The room Is dedicated to two important masterpieces of the Medici era recently restored: the imposing frieze that adorned the fa√ßade of the Villa and was commissioned by Lorenzo himself, and the precious tapestry of the Hunting Swan, one of 36 tapestries designed by Giorgio Vasari on commission of Cosimo I, especially for the Villa. Finally, though temporarily, the room is embellished with the 17th century painting of a beautiful family tree of the Medici family.  Buildings adjacent to the Villa and Gardens  The limonaia Adjacent to the Villa are some buildings such as the chapel, (where the Piet√† con i Santi Cosimo e Damiano, painted in 1560 Giorgio Vasari, waiting for restoration), housed on the ground floor of the south-east bastion; The Cucinone built at the beginning of the 17th century and the neoclassical cellar (or limonaia) \\"with anchored water retention\\", the work of Poccianti (1825). The Hall of the Pallacorda is a building at the corner of the garden, which dates back to the late eighteenth century to practice this game, and today houses the concierge and a store. In the middle of the sixteenth century, under Cosimo I, Niccol√≤ Tribolo rearranged the gardens and finished the construction of the stables (1548). The overall view of the garden and the stables after the Tribolo's intervention is in the famous lunette of Giusto Utens (1599) kept in Florence Museum.  The Gardens  The villa in 1599, Lunetta of Giusto Utens The fountain at the center of the Italian garden The gardens around the villa date back to the nineteenth century and are very interesting. Up until the 17th century, the villa's garden was quite simple compared to those of Castello or Petraia: garden areas and wooded areas with an Italian garden on the right, all without fountains and sculptural decorations, as appears from the painting of Giusto Utens. In the eighteenth century some areas of the garden were restored, extending the hunting ground, the so-called 'phagianaia'. In the Italian garden area, a fountain is placed in the center instead of a grove of trees, fed by a new water tank. In 1813 Louis-Martin Berthault noted the desolation of the square in front of the villa and proposed to remedy the fact that the various highlights of the park, which would be vast, are actually isolated From the other: the villa and the backyard are adjacent, but the Italian garden is cut off from the road to Prato and Barco mediceo di Bonistallo (not to be confused with the much bigger \\"Barco Reale\\" placed on the Montalbano ridge), a hunting forest that still rises on the hill in front of the villa to the church of San Francesco, from the road to Pistoia; The \\"Pavoniere\\", in addition to the Cascine and still existing ones, are separated from the Ombrone river. In order to remedy these disadvantages several steps were taken: the road to Prato was defeated, the numerous walls that separated the seating areas and unified in one fence were cut down, while on the square of the villa were made some serpentine driveways with Various vegetable decoration; The Umbrella course was straightened and a new ironable bridge was built to connect with Cascine di Tavola and Pavoniere. The garden thus came to be an irregular shape. The kitchens, the watercourse and the chapel were hidden by new tree groups.  Exhibitions  The entrance and guardhouse * In the summer of 2009 the villa welcomed the works of Helene Brandt and Donatella Mei who pay tribute to Isabella de' Medici * La Hunting is the theme of the exhibition that was held at the villa where a series of tapestries were taken by Cosimo I and performed by Giovanni Stradano and Francesco Allori. The center of interest is represented by the tapestries depicting \\"The Wild Goose Hunt\\" and \\"The Swan Hunt\\".

It was edited by the VNIITE, the All-Union Technical Aesthetics Research Institute. Some of the topics it covered were the history, theory and practice of design in Russia and abroad, ergonomics, art and design education, and reviews of design exhibitions and books. The magazine regularly exposed Western design trends and innovations, which were often compared with their Soviet counterparts. It also rehabilitated the memory of movements such as Russian constructivism, which had been condemned by Stalin in favour of Socialist realism, even if they set the foundations of Russian design in the early 1920s. According to art historian Alexandra Chiriac, the term technical aesthetics was invented in Russia in the 1960s to speak about the field of design, which wasn't really developed in the country at the time, and which was promoted through the VNIITE research institute and the Technical Aesthetics magazine.

Built in the 1770s, it is one of the earliest Armenian churches in Russia. History An image of the church from 1880. =Foundation= Private stables of Empress Elizabeth of Russia stood on its location in the mid-18th century, until it was granted to Petersburg Armenians on May 2, 1770 by Empress Catherine the Great, upon the request of her Armenian jeweler Ivan Lazarev. Its construction was primarily financed by Lazarev, who provided 30,000 rubles of the total 33,000. The church was designed by Yury Felten and is an early example of Russian Classicism. Its construction began in the spring of 1771 and was completed in 1776. The church was consecrated on February 18, 1780 by Hovsep Arghutian (Prince Argutinsky- Dolgorukov), the archbishop of the Russian diocese of the Armenian church, in attendance of Prince Grigory Potemkin, the favourite of Catherine the Great. It is named after Catherine of Alexandria, a namesake of the empress. Colored white and blue, it has a neoclassical portico and single cupola. =Later history= It became the center of Armenian cultural activity in the Russian imperial capital. The first Armenian publishing house in Russia functioned nearby. The church did not have bells until 1865, when Khristofo E. Lazarev received permission to install them. The church was completely renovated by the Russian-Armenian architect Alexander Tamanian in 1906‚Äì09. The church was closed down by Soviet authorities no later than May 1930. During the Second World War, the building served as the headquarters of the anti-aircraft defense and later as a decoration room of the Leningrad Theater of Musical Comedy. The Armenian community regained ownership of the church in August 1992 and the first mass took place in March 1993. After thorough restoration, the church was reconsecrated on July 12, 2000 by Karekin II, Catholicos of All Armenians, and Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow. It was renovated again in 2014.

Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. She was unraced as a two-year-old and finished second on her racecourse debut in April 2005. She then established herself as one of the best fillies of her generation in Europe with five consecutive win including the Prix de Royaumont, Irish Oaks and the Prix Vermeille. After finishing sixth in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe she was bought by Godolphin and retired from racing in 2006. She made an immediate impact as a broodmare, with her second foal being the St Leger winner Encke. Background Shawanda is a bay mare with a narrow white blaze bred in Ireland by her owner the Aga Khan at his Gilltown Stud in County Kildare. The Aga Khan's racing manager remembered her as \\"a most attractive yearling and as much as we could tell about her as a young horse, she was very athletic\\". Shawanda was sent into training with Alain de Royer-Dupr√© in France and was ridden in all of her races by Christophe Soumillon. She was sired by Sinndar, who won The Derby, Irish Derby and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in 2000. The best of his other progeny were probably Youmzain and Shareta. Her dam Shamawna won two minor races and finished third in the Group 3 Prix du Royaumont, and also produced Shareta's dam Shawara. She was descended from the British broodmare Aimee (foaled in 1957) whose other descendants have included Blushing Groom and King Kamehameha. Racing career =2005: three-year-old season= Shawanda began her racing career in the Prix Dushka, for previously unraced three-year-old fillies over 2100 metres on heavy ground at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse on 1 April and finished second of the fourteen runners, a length behind the winner L'Enjoleuse. Later that month she started the 1.7/1 favourite for a maiden race over 2000 metres at Chantilly Racecourse and recorded her first success, going clear of her rivals in the closing stages and winning by two and a half lengths. Shawanda was stepped up in class on 15 May when she contested the Listed Prix de la Seine over 2300 metres at Longchamp Racecourse and won again, taking the lead before half way and keeping on to win by one and a half lengths from Asi Siempre. On 4 June Shawanda was moved up in class and distance for the Group 3 Prix de Royaumont over 2400 metres at Chantilly and started the 6/5 favourite against five opponents. Soumillon sent her to the front from the start and she broke away from her pursuers in the straight and won \\"easily\\" from Royal Highness by and two and a half lengths. The filly was then sent to Ireland for the Group 1 Irish Oaks over one and a half miles at the Curragh on 17 July and started the 9/2 second favourite behind the British-trained Dash to the Top. She had not been among the original entries for the race, meaning that the Aga Khan had to pay a supplementary fee of ‚Ç¨40,000 to run her in the contest. The other eleven runners included Playful Act, Saoire, Pictavia (third in The Oaks), Mona Lisa (third in the Coronation Stakes), Hazariya (Athasi Stakes), Chelsea Rose (Moyglare Stud Stakes) and Thakafaat (Ribblesdale Stakes). Thakafaat set the pace with Shawanda settled behind the leaders and turning into the straight in fifth place before beginning to make steady progress. Shawanda overtook Thakafaat two furlongs out and accelerated away from the field to win in \\"impressive\\" style by five lengths from Playful Act. After the race Christophe Soumillon said \\"I have never won a Group One race so easily. To be honest, it could have been ten lengths and not five if I had really pushed her out. She was very impressive\\". On 11 September Shawanda started the 4/9 favourite for the Group 1 Prix Vermeille over 2400 metres at Longchamp. Dash to the Top and Royal Highness were again in opposition, whilst the other three runners were Lune d'Or (Premio Lydia Tesio), Something Exciting (second in the Epsom Oaks) and Paita (third in the Prix de Diane). Shawanda took the lead after 600 metres and was never seriously challenged thereafter, accelerating clear in the straight and winning \\"comfortably\\" by three quarters of a length from Royal Highness. Soumillon described her victory as \\"just a piece of work\\". On her final racecourse appearance Shawanda was matched against male opposition in the 2005 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and started the 3/1 third favourite in a fifteen- runner field. After tracking the leader she took the lead in the straight but was outpaced in the closing stages and finished sixth behind Hurricane Run, Westerner, Bago, Shirocco and Motivator. At the end of the year Shawanda was sold Sheikh Mohammeds Godolphin organisation and transferred to the stable of Saeed bin Suroor. She remained in training in 2006 but never ran again and was retired from racing at the end of 2006.

Early and family life Thomas Sweeney was born in Armagh, Ireland to Thomas Sweeney and Sarah Ann Campbell. His family emigrated to the United States when he was a child. He and his brothers Michael (1809-1875), Campbell and Robert Henry Sweeney lived Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and by 1830 settled near the important Ohio River port of Wheeling in what was Ohio County, Virginia. Thomas Sweeney married his first wife, Rosanna Mathews (1809-1844) in Pittsburgh, and she had four children before her death in 1844. They were Andrew J. Sweeney (1827-1893), Rebecca Sweeney, Thomas Sweeney Jr. (1842-1874) and Robert H. Sweeney.http://www.ohiocountylibrary.org/wheeling-history/4335 The widower remarried the following year, to Baltimore-born Jane Bell McFerran (1819-1872), who had sons Michael T. Sweeney (b. 1849), John M.F. Sweeney (b. 1852) and daughter Annie (b. 1858). After her death, Sweeney remarried again, to Anna E. A. How (b.1834-d.1913) who had a daughter Letitia in 1876.findagrave and U.S. Census of 1880 The Sweeney mansion was at 847 Main street. Career Like Pittsburgh upriver, Wheeling and nearby Wellsburg in Brooke County and Martins Ferry, Ohio had several glass furnaces by 1830, which took advantage of the cheap river transportation for raw materials and fuel, as well as the finished glass. In 1830, the Sweeney brothers bought a glass furnace, the North Wheeling Manufacturing Company, and by 1835 had built a new flint window glass factory in the north end of town, which soon manufactured bottles as well. A few years later Plunkett & Miller built a similar factory on Wheeling's southern end, which J. L. Hobbs and J. H. Hobbs acquired by 1845. In 1864, during the American Civil War (in which Wheeling became briefly capitol of the new state of West Virginia), William Leighton Jr. of the Hobbs & Hobbs firm designed a new method of producing lime glass that made the previously inferior product suitable for producing tableware and revolutionized the industry. By 1880, six years after Sweeney's retirement and five after his younger brother's death, the city had three major firms which operated seven furnaces which included 72 pots, employed 818 men using a combined capital of %500,522, paid $296,450 in wages and used $192,564 worth of raw material to produce $714,000 worth of wares, or about 7.82% of all glassware sold in the country.http://www.ohiocountylibrary.org/wheeling- history/wheeling-glass-industry-1886/2731 About half of all American cut glass tableware was made in either Wheeling or Pittsburgh by the turn of the century.http://weelunk.com/the-mabel-files-tale-of-the-sweeny-punchbowls In 1836, Sweeney was one of eleven commissioners as the town of Wheeling became the city of Wheeling.http://genealogytrails.com/wva/ohio/history_formation.html Sweeney won election to the Virginia Senate in 1851.Cynthia Miller Leonard, Virginia General Assembly 1619-1978 (Richmond: Virginia State Library 1978), pp. 452, 466 The state senatorial district that had been represented by Rev. James G. West of Wetzel County was split into several districts after the 1850 census and new state constitution adopted after a constitutional convention that year called to address over-representation of slaveholding interests in the eastern and central portions of the Commonwealth. Sweeney represented Brooke, Hancock and Ohio Counties. Wetzel, Marshall and Tyler Counties were agglomerated with Marion County and Jefferson Martin won election, but resigned by 1853 and was succeeded by West by the 1853-1854 session; Doddridge County originally in that district was agglomerated with Ritchie, Harrison, Pleasants and Wood counties and represented by Benjamin Bassel. However, Sweeney served only one short term; Wheeling Suspension Bridge advocate Lewis Steenrod succeeded him in 1853. Four years later, Ohio County voters elected Sweeney to serve alongside Andrew F. Woods as their representatives in the Virginia House; they had replaced former mayor James Paul, John Brady and G.L. Crammer in the area's turbulent political climate, and two years later were themselves replaced by Nathaniel Richardson (politician), John Knote and Daniel M. Edgington.Leonard at p. 466 Before the Civil War, the Sweeney firm made three enormous four-foot wide and nearly five foot tall cut leaded glass bowls, in order to showcase their wares. The bowls won prizes at exhibitions in New York and Philadelphia. In 1844 at least one was given to Senator Henry Clay, partly in gratitude for helping establish a tariff on foreign glassware. Over the next decades, two were destroyed in warehouse fires (including the one sent to Clay's estate at Ashland and used to baptize him in 1847).https://historyofahousemuseum.com/tag/sweeney-glass/ The third adorned Michael Sweeney's tomb in Wheeling's cemetery from 1875 until 1948, when it was moved to the Oglebay glass museum for safekeeping.http://weelunk.com/the- mabel-files-tale-of-the-sweeny-punchbowls/https://historic- wheeling.wikispaces.com/Sweeney+Tomb In 1858, Michael Sweeney split with his brother, who refused him a loan to build a mansion.http://weelunk.com/the- mabel-files-tale-of-the-sweeny-punchbowls/ Instead, Thomas Sweeney admitted his eldest son Andrew J.

Sweeney was an inventor, and had also been appointed Wheeling's mayor in 1855. He would win election as the city's mayor thrice more in the following decades,http://www.wvgenweb.org/ohio/wheelingmayors.pdf and promoted improvements including a street railway, electric lighting company, paid fire department, fire alarm telegraph, and many new bridges and shipping facilities.

He was the father of ten children and grandfather of many more successful offspring. Thomas's son, Andrew J. Sweeney served as mayor of Wheeling, West Virginia for many years, was a business partner in his fathers foundry eventually taking over the leadership role of the company, and was appointed Colonel of the militia during the Civil War. Another son, Thomas Campbell Sweeney was a prominent River Boat Captain during the Civil War and traveled up and down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers during his career. Yet another son, John F. Sweeney, founded the Equitable Life Assurance Society. One grandson, Thomas Bell Sweeney, Jr., served in the West Virginia House of Delegates 1st District from 1939-42. Grandson, Walter Campbell Sweeney, served an illustrious military career rising to the rank of Brigadier General. Walter Campbell Sweeney's son Walter Campbell Sweeney, Jr. also served in the military eventually commanding the Tactical Air Command for the U.S. Air Force and achieving the rank of four-star general. Grandson, Andrew Thomas Sweeney (d. 1918; Andrew J. Sweeney's youngest son and married to Kate B.

He lives alone with his father, T√≠o Ratero (Uncle Ratter - so called because he hunts water rats for food), in a cave far from the village. El Nini is a savant to whom all come for advice about the harvest, the weather, animals and saints. His mother - step-sister to his father - was committed to a psychiatric hospital when El Nini was very young, and the boy's only emotional support now resides in the company of his dog and in his love and knowledge of the surrounding countryside. Under pressure from the civil Governor, the mayor of the village wants to put an end to the caves, but Uncle Ratter refuses to leave the only dwelling he has ever known. A poacher preys on all the animals in his path, while El Nini tries to save their offspring and mitigate the damage.

King Eir√≠kr of Greece has a beautiful daughter called √Üsa. Her mother Ingibj√∂rg locks her in an outhouse to learn to do needlework. While √Üsa is alone here, a red-cloaked lad called Gullk√°r enters (despite the locked door), and wins her love by magically giving her expertise in needlework. The two begin an affair; Gullk√°r is invisible to people other than Ingibj√∂rg. Realising that something is afoot, Eir√≠kr puts guards around √Üsa, but the invisible Gullk√°r beats them up. Eir√≠kr betrothes √Üsa to a series of men. However, each finds himself falling asleep every night, implicitly failing to consummate a marriage to √Üsa, and each goes home after a year leaving her with her parents. √Üsa's relationship with Gullk√°r continues. Gullk√°r warns √Üsa that their relationship will now be disrupted by an ogress who will visit with fair form, but whose gifts √Üsa must refuse. The ogress arrives in a green cloak and promises to make √Üsa healthy. Although √Üsa refuses the ogress's gifts, the ogress succeeds in leaving a splinter in √Üsa's room; this turns into a knife on which Gullk√°r cuts himself while visiting. Gullk√°r leaves the house, as does √Üsa shortly after. She wanders alone through forests, her clothes becoming tattered, until one night she comes upon a small house; by this time, she cannot even remember her father's name. In the house is Gullk√°r and his mother; the house is implicitly in √Ålfheimar. It emerges that Gullk√°r has been cursed by the ogress and lies sick. If he dies, so too will many others, and only √Üsa can heal him. √Üsa draws the affliction from Gullk√°r's heart. The poem ends rather abruptly, but implicitly the two live happily ever after. Origins and witnesses Gullk√°rslj√≥√∞ has been dated on linguistic grounds to the mid-fourteenth century. The earliest manuscript witnesses to the poem are from the seventeenth century, including manuscripts of the Poetic Edda. While concluding that the poem must have circulated orally, Haukur √ûorgeirsson finds that all surviving manuscripts probably descend from a single, lost archetype.Haukur √ûorgeirsson, 'Gullk√°rslj√≥√∞ og Hrafnagaldur: Framlag til s√∂gu fornyr√∞islags', _Gripla_ , 21 (2010), 299‚Äì334 (esp. p. 299), https://www.academia.edu/1775500.

History In 1997, a new category, \\"Eurostar\\", was introduced as the brand name of the high-speed trains run by Trenitalia in Italy. Since 2006, trains started to be operated and promoted under further sub-brands and less and less sold under the name \\"Eurostar\\". In June 2012, the category Eurostar was officially divided into various subcategories indicating various high-speed services. The new categories created were Frecciarossa (literally, Red Arrow) for the fastest trains, Frecciargento (literally, Silver Arrow) for the next category of trains and finally Frecciabianca (literally, White Arrow). Since all these three train categories are named as \\"Freccia\\" (literally, Arrow), the high- speed trains operated by Trenitalia are named \\"Le Frecce\\", on a par with TGV in France, ICE in Germany and AVE in Spain. Frecciarossa Frecciarossa trains operate at speeds of up to 300 km/h (190 mph). It runs mostly on high- speed line and is the premier service of Trenitalia and competes with .italo, operated by Nuovo Trasporto Viaggiatori. The service is provided by ETR 500 and, since June 2015, by ETR 1000. There are four classes, namely, Executive, Business, Premium and Standard class, with a restaurant car. There are plans to increase the speed of Frecciarossa service to 350 km/h in intermediate- term. Comprehensive test-runs with ETR 1000 were carried out from Autumn 2015 to the end of 2016. Frecciargento Frecciargento trains operate at speeds of up to 250 km/h (160 mph). In agreement to the use of Pendolino trains policy, only some sections of the railway lines of Frecciargento are high speed and it runs on conventional rail lines in the other sections. The third (ETR 485) and fourth (ETR 600, ETR 610) generation of Pendolino trains are employed for Frecciargento trains. There are two classes (first and second class) as well as one restaurant car.

History Red Group saw its first operational deployment in Sangin in early 2016. In the summer of that year a Taliban spokesperson reported to media that the Red Group was producing consistently \\"good\\" results in actions against the Afghan National Army and discussions were underway about utilizing it for increased operational deployments. The assessment of the unit's potency was echoed by provincial officials in Helmand who described the outfit as \\"very dangerous and very successful\\". In the subsequent time, the Red Group began operating all around Afghanistan and used by the insurgents for the most important as well as dangerous missions. In July 2018, the Red Group played an important part in the Battle of Darzab, which resulted in a major Taliban victory over the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ‚Äì Khorasan Province. By late 2018, the unit was known to be most active in Kunduz Province, Baghlan Province, and Faryab Province, aiding in a number of major Taliban advances in these areas. Tactics, equipment, and membership The Red Group, which numbered approximately 300 by 2016, reportedly employs commando tactics and is equipped with \\"advanced weaponry\\", including night vision equipment, heavy machine guns and M4 carbines. They are known to be especially proficient in night combat, and considered to be better trained and equipped than most Afghan National Army soldiers. Though generally called the Taliban's special forces, analysts have argued that the Red Group was probably not performing traditional special operations missions, but were, instead, being used as shock troops or a rapid deployment force. Moving on motorcycles, the unit often raids isolated outposts, destroying the local defences, and then retreating before other forces can respond. The Red Group often spearheads Taliban offensives, as it has proven to be very effective in combat. Nevertheless, its equipment and training are inferior to those of Western special forces. Its members differ in various regards from regular Taliban troops. Red Group fighters are mostly recruited from refugee camps in Pakistan, are indoctrinated in madrasas, and trained at camps along the Afghan-Pakistani border. Unlike other Taliban, they are not loyal to various clans or villages, but to the movement itself. By 2020, one of the unit's training camps was the so-called \\"Tariq bin Ziad Military Corps\\", located in the mountains of Paktika Province.  Leadership  The first known commander of the unit was Haji Nasarv according to a 2016 report by the Military Times. In 2017 the BBC reported the Red Group commander was Mullah Taqi. On 3 December 2017, Reuters reported that Mullah Taqi was killed by NATO forces. He was succeeded by Mullah Shah Wali (alias \\"Haji Nasir\\"), who was killed in December 2017. An advisor to Mullah Shah Wali, the German mujahid Abdul Wadood, was captured by the Afghan military in March 2018. By 2020, one of the unit's main trainers was Ammar Ibn Yasser who was described as \\"the Mujahideen of Mujahideen\\" by Taliban media.

The 420 terminals included an Intel 4748 single chip microprocessor controlling the punched card reader, the voting keys and the display lights, in addition to the serial interface to the LAN. The transmission was over a 19200 baud RS422 telephone cable using a polling- selecting software protocol controlled by the minicomputer. An \\"Intelligent Communication Controller\\" with an Intel 8080 microprocessor was installed between the Olivetti P6060 and the network of the terminals to achieve the full speed of communication. In the first system installed in Strasbourg, France, used only once for a minor vote, the polling of the terminals had been controlled by the P6060 with an interpreted Basic software with response time so long to force Simone Veil, the Parliament President, to apologize to parliament saying that \\"la machine doit chauffer\\" - the machine must warm up.see the European Parliament official acts After the first system was installed in Strasbourg it was determined that the interpreted basic software used by the P6060 was limiting the polling speed from the network. An intelligent unit was therefore installed to perform the polling selecting functions using an Intel 8080 microprocessor controlled micro programmed for the specific function. This unit was first installed in the second system of Luxembourg, where it was used for the first time for the voting of the Budget, with over 500 nominal votes were performed in just 4 hours - It would have taken about two hours for each of the 500 votes using the traditional manual procedures.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYGDyF6YBvY. The Strasbourg system was then updated with a similar intelligent unit. The P6060 was later replaced with one of the newest Olivetti personal computers. The terminals, the local area network and the intelligent polling unit were designed and manufactured by a subcontractor of Olivetti: Elema Spa, were Enrico Massetti http://enricomassetti.com/ was the general manager and the main designer. Elema Spa installed also, always as a subcontractor of Olivetti, an identical electronic voting system in the Italian Senato della Repubblica. The voting systems for the European Parliament and the Italian Senate were later updated and expanded by the Eurel Informatica Spa http://www.eurel.it/12?show_case=10 company that was founded by Enzo Costa, the former Olivetti engineer who was in charge of the original project for Olivetti when the company decided to exit the business of electronic voting systems in 1987. The first time the system was used in Luxembourg it failed miserably Enrico Massetti quick thinking and action saved the day for the Parliament and for Olivetti, and prevented it to become a total disaster. Enrico manually controlled the power of the voting terminals at each of the 500 votes that took place that day. Enzo Costa, the Olivetti engineer in charge of the project, had requested that the test software be incorporated with the operating firmware of the terminal, activated when a voting button was pressed at power-up. When activated, the test software was continuously transmitting a square wave on the transmission line, effectively killing all network communication. With 430 people interacting with the system someone would vote before the president declared the vote open, and the power to the terminals switched on automatically by the central computer.

She entered the Georgetown Visitation Convent in 1818, with her husband entering the Jesuits. She founded a convent of visitation in Kaskaskia, Illinois, in 1836, remaining there till 1844. She taught in a convent in St. Louis, Missouri, from 1844 till 1848, and in Mobile, Alabama, until the time of her death. Her only son, Samuel, became a Jesuit, and her four daughters entered the convent. Early years Barber was born in Newton, Connecticut, in 1789. Her parents were pious Protestants, strict members of their church. Career She married Virgil Horace Barber on September 20, 1807, when she was 19 and he was about 25. The husband and wife did not precipitately embrace the Catholic religion, but the husband thought Protestantism too superficial, too recent, too worldly and too inconsistent. He had been an Episcopalian clergyman and principal of their academy in Fairfield, New York. He determined to become a Roman Catholic and moved to New York where his mentor, Benedict Joseph Fenwick, received his family into the Catholic Church in 1816. Jerusha was 28 and they had five children: Mary (b. 1810); Abigail (b. 1811); Susan (b. 1813); Samuel (b. 1814); and Josephine (b. 1816). For support they opened a school, but after eight months both determined to join the religious life and, under Fenwick's direction, moved to Georgetown in Washington, D.C. In Washington, D.C., the couple went through the process of separation. Jerusha and her children were placed in a convent while the husband went to Rome to study towards ordination. In 1818 Jerusha entered the Visitation convent of Georgetown which also housed her three eldest daughters, while the baby, Josephine, was placed in the home of Fenwick's mother. When she thought she was pregnant, she left the community for a short period, but soon returned. On February 23, 1820, husband and wife took their religious vows, she as Sister Mary Augustine. Mary was a woman of superior education, and the convent and school progressed rapidly during her residence. In 1836 she founded a visitation convent in Kaskaskia, Illinois, where she remained until 1844. She was especially successful in training the younger sisters to be accomplished teachers, and was engaged in this occupation in the convent of St. Louis from 1844 till 1848, and in Mobile up to the time of her death. She died in Summerville, near Mobile, in 1860. Their only son, Samuel, became a Jesuit, and their four daughters entered the Ursuline convent.

He was born at Llandaff, Cardiff and died at Llandough Castle, Llandough, Glamorgan. Stacey was educated at Eton College and King's College, Cambridge; entry to King's was, in Stacey's time there, restricted to people educated at Eton. He played cricket for Cambridge University as a lower-order batsman and wicketkeeper; it is not known whether he was right- or left- handed, and he did not keep wicket in every match in which he played. His most successful game for the university side was the 1853 University Match against Oxford University, in which he batted at No 10 for Cambridge and top-scored with 38, though the match was lost by an innings. Stacey's cricket after 1853 was fairly intermittent, but in 1859 he made the highest score of his first- class career, 89, playing for a Gentlemen of England side against the Gentlemen of Kent. Stacey graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1854, and this was automatically converted to a Master of Arts in 1857. He remained as a Fellow of King's College until 1863, but also qualified as a lawyer, being called to the bar in 1857 and thereafter practising on the South Wales circuit. He married Theodosia, daughter of Charles Tyndall of Bristol, in 1862 and the marriage, with a subsequent legacy, made him extremely wealthy. Buying Llandough Castle near Cowbridge in Glamorgan, he served as High Sheriff of Glamorgan in 1873 and was also a justice of the peace and a deputy lieutenant for the county. Stacey's wealth enabled him to become a generous philanthropist and benefactor, and he put up the money and contributed to the design of the stained glass in the great west window of King's College Chapel, Cambridge in 1879, which had been left plain when the chapel's other stained-glass windows were constructed in the 16th century. In an article in The Spectator in 2003, Stacey's great-great-nephew, the writer and journalist Tom Stacey, wrote that the donation of the window, which depicts Doom, was considered within the family to have been a penance for Francis Stacey's dissolute lifestyle while at Cambridge. The article states that Stacey felt especial remorse over an incident in which, in advance of his own marriage, he bequeathed his town \\"girl-friend\\" to another King's Fellow, named Ridler ‚Äì Fellows of King's College were expected to be celibate ‚Äì but that Ridler had subsequently died in the girl-friend's bed; Stacey had been involved in a subterfuge which saw the dead Ridler returned to King's, where the body was \\"discovered\\" the following morning dead in his own bed.

Biography  Calvillo was born in San Antonio de Bexar in 1765. She was the oldest of six children. Calvillo defied the customs of her time and was said to have \\"rode the range like a man.\\" Her grandnephew recalled that she \\"dressed like a man and could shoot and rope like one.\\" Calvillo married Juan Lucas Gavino de la Trinidad Delgado in Bexar County sometime around 1781. She kept her maiden name and individually maintained her property under Spanish Law. They had two sons, one baptized in 1783 and the other the next year; the youngest son died at seven months. She and her husband also adopted three children. The census showed her and her husband living as ranchers in Villa de San Fernando and in 1811, they were living on her father's ranch. Between 1811 and 1814, her husband, Gavino, was involved with overthrowing Spanish rule and sometime during these years, Calvillo left her husband. In April 1814, Calvillo's father was murdered, and she inherited the ranch known as Rancho de las Cabras (the Goat Ranch). She ran the ranch herself and expanded it to include a granary, sugar mill and irrigation system. She owned around 2,000 head of cattle, and had a shepherd, a tailor, eight laborers a personal servant and all of their families living and working on her land. Calvillo didn't formally petition the Mexican government for the title to the ranch until August 28, 1828, which was granted to her in September of the same year. She was later granted three additional leagues of land in 1833. Also in 1833, she had trouble with Indians on her land. She finally had a representative in court in 1851, where she was declared by the court as non compos mentis. Calvillo died on January 15, 1856. She left the ranch to her adopted daughter and son.

He specialized in English and German philology, and among other places did work at the American-Scandinavian Foundation in Copenhagen and Oxford University, as well as at Rutgers, Princeton, and Stanford University. His work included assistance with the etymological work of the second edition of Webster's New International Dictionary, and two articles on medieval literary descriptions of weapons and armor. The second of these articles, \\"Arms and Armour in Chaucer\\", is still considered a standard on the subject. Herben was the son of Grace Foster Herben and Rev. Stephen Joseph Herben Sr., a Methodist missionary and minister, respectively. He married twice, to Mary Shattuck, another academic then beginning her career in psychology, from 1921 to 1929, and to Caroline Robbins, a professor of history at Bryn Mawr and the sister of Lionel Robbins, from 1932 until his death. He died at the age of 70, and has an endowed fund in his name at Bryn Mawr. Early life and education Stephen Joseph Herben Jr. was born on 14 March 1897 to Grace Foster Herben and Stephen Joseph Herben Sr. He was the younger brother of George Foster Herben, who was born on 17 March 1893. Like both his father and brother, Herben Jr. attended Evanston Academy in Illinois. In September 1914 he matriculated at Rutgers University. Two months later, earlier employment in the forestry commission came in useful when an estate on which he was hunting caught fire and he was put in charge of the volunteer firefighters. His graduation was delayed by the American intervention in World War I, for by May 1917 Herben Jr. had been made responsible for organizing an ambulance corps of twenty-five Rutgers students to be trained by the surgeon Fred H. Albee and serve in the war. On 5 August he sailed for Savenay, France, part of the Base Hospital Unit No. 8 Post Graduate Hospital, New York. A spell of scarlet fever in February landed him in the hospital as a patient, stricken enough that a letter home had to be dictated to a fellow Rutgers student, but in July he was sent back stateside via Ellis Island and granted a brief furlough to visit home. By October he was back in France; so too was his father, who had volunteered to serve as a chaplain with the American Red Cross. Herben Jr. was promoted to sergeant in November 1918, and discharged as disabled on 31 March 1919. He finally graduated from Rutgers in June 1920, with a Bachelor of Letters. Herben Jr. graduated from Princeton University on 20 July 1922, with the award of a $1,000 fellowship by The American-Scandinavian Foundation. The following year he left for his fellowship at the University of Copenhagen with his newlywed wife, who helped with his research into the Scandinavian backdrop of the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf; two years later, following a second year abroad as a special coach in Old English at Oxford, his return occasioned headlines proclaiming that he had discovered the site of Heorot, the fabled mead hall and seat of King Hrothgar, where the hero Beowulf travels in search of the monster Grendel. A decade later, in 1935, a paper by Herben Jr. titled simply \\"Heorot\\" placed the hall northeast of Roskilde, on the basis of the place names Stor Hiort and Lille Hiorte on an 18th-century map; the suggestion went against the conventional belief that Heorot was based on a settlement at Lejre, and has been called \\"practically groundless\\". Career Herben Jr. linked the neck protection on the Valsg√§rde 8 helmet to descriptions of helmets in Beowulf. From approximately 1925 until 1928, Herben Jr. taught English as an instructor, and then associate professor, at Princeton. A student later reminisced about his \\"happy melange of beer and literary discussion\\". The bulk of Herben Jr.'s career, however, was spent at Bryn Mawr College, where he taught for 34 years, until his retirement in 1962. At Bryn Mawr he was a professor of philology, specializing in English and German. He was put in charge of abstracting articles from philological journals for the 1934 release of Webster's New International Dictionary, in addition to his etymological work; the chief etymologist for the edition was Princeton professor Harold H. Bender, with whom Herben Jr., then still an instructor at Princeton, had written a 1927 article on the etymology of several English words rooted in German. In 1937, Herben Jr., who himself had a collection of arms and armor from the Shakespearean era, published two articles on the literary descriptions of weapons and armor by the Beowulf poet and by Chaucer respectively. In \\"A Note on the Helm in Beowulf\\", Herben Jr. linked the neck protection on the recently excavated Valsg√§rde 6 and 8 helmets with the description of in the poem as \\"encircled with lordly chains\\". His other article, \\"Arms and Armor in Chaucer\\", aimed to \\"confirm impressions of [Chaucer's] realism and establish more firmly his existing claims as a dependable source for manners and customs in the fourteenth century\\". The article was one of Herben Jr.'s better-known publications, and was still regarded 75 years later, in 2012, as \\"a groundbreaking and most useful piece of research\\" and \\"perhaps ... the most familiar [analysis of contemporary arms and armor] within Chaucerian scholarship\\". Herben Jr.'s teaching, which including a visiting stint at Stanford University, was interrupted in 1949 by injuries sustained in a car accident. Driving from Williamsburg to Washington in February, he received, according to a former student who wrote to the Princeton Alumni Weekly, \\"a severe concussion and a bad shaking-up\\". Herben Jr. underwent surgery upon arrival at a hospital and remained unconscious for nearly a week; he eventually recovered enough to be moved to a hospital in Roxborough, Philadelphia, where he remained six weeks later. The former student wrote at the time that Herben Jr. was \\"still rather dazed\\", and that \\"[i]t is doubtful if he will be able to teach for a long time\\". During his career, Herben Jr. also lectured at the University of Bonn and the Sorbonne. He retired in 1962 and became a professor emeritus. Upon this occasion, then- president of the college Katharine Elizabeth McBride remarked that he \\"was never willing to turn away a student who entered to learn\\". Personal life Wedding announcement in The Boston Post for Herben Jr. and Mary Bishop Shattuck Herben Jr. married Mary Bishop Shattuck on 27 May 1921. She was herself the daughter of a minister, Rev. Willard Ide Shattuck, who together with Herben Jr.'s father performed the ceremony. The Boston Post dubbed it \\"entirely a family affair\\", for the best man was Herben Jr.'s brother, and the maid of honor Mary Shattuck's sister, Frances. Shattuck, who as Mary Fisher Langmuir would become recognized in the field of child psychology, went on to obtain her master's degree and doctorate from Columbia University, after which she lectured at New York University and served as the director of research at the Family Consultation Bureau of Columbia's Child Development Institute. The couple had two children, Mary Joan and Lysbeth, before Shattuck filed for divorce in 1929. The divorce was filed in Reno, Nevada, on 23 September; a notice in the Reno Evening Gazette the next day reported on the proceeding. Shattuck was granted custody of both daughters, who upon her subsequent marriage to Willis Fisher took up the new surname. On 21 September 1932, Herben Jr. married again, and his father again officiated. His new bride was Caroline Robbins, an associate professor of history at Bryn Mawr, and the brother of the economist Lionel Robbins. Marion Edwards Park, the president of the college, held the ceremony in her house. Herben died on 22 December 1967, at his home in Rosemont, Pennsylvania. He was survived by his wife and six grandchildren, including the geologist and author Sarah Andrews. A fund for the purchase of history materials was established in his name, and that of Howard L. Gray, at Bryn Mawr by Mary O. Slingluff of the class of 1931. One of Herben Jr.'s books, a rare 1617 copy of The Faerie Queen; The Shepheards Calendar: Together with the Other Works of England's Arch-Po√´t, Edm. Spenser signed by John Dryden, was bequeathed at his death to Julia McGrew of Vassar College's Department of English, who subsequently donated it to the school.

Early life Landale was an early basketball prospect in Australia, but gave up the game until picking it up again at Geelong Grammar School in Corio, Victoria. A growth spurt that saw him grow almost a full foot from year 9 to year 12 raised his profile as prospect and helped him secure a scholarship to the American Saint Mary's, an NCAA Division I school. College career Landale was a bit player as a freshman, but increased his role as a sophomore and enjoyed a breakout season as a junior, in part due to improved conditioning. At times, Landale had dominant performances, such as the 5 January 2017 win over BYU in which he went 11-13 from the field for 26 points. He averaged 16.9 points and 9.5 rebounds, leading the Gaels to the 2017 NCAA Tournament. Making his numbers more impressive is that only one of the 351 Division I men's teams averaged fewer possessions per game than the Gaels that season. At the close of the season, he was named first-team All-West Coast Conference (WCC). Landale scored 33 points and grabbed 12 rebounds in an overtime loss to Georgia on 26 November. On 22 January 2018, Landale was named NBC Sports player of the week, after contributing 24 points and 12 rebounds in a win versus Gonzaga and 32 points and seven rebounds in a victory over Pacific. He averaged 21.5 points, 10.2 rebounds and 1.1 blocked shots per game as a senior. Landale was named West Coast Conference player of the year while his teammate Emmett Naar was named to the First Team All-Conference. Professional career =Partizan (2018‚Äì2019)= After going undrafted in the 2018 NBA draft, Landale signed with the Atlanta Hawks for NBA Summer League.

History The association was formed in 1895. Its headquarters were established in Melbourne, in the facilities of the Commercial Travellers' Association of Victoria, which was formed in 1880. Affiliated organisations also existed in South Australia, which was the first to be established in 1866, followed by New South Wales (1883), Queensland (1884), Western Australia (1896) and Tasmania (1900). Its remit was aiding salesmen travelling across the country on train or carriage, providing increased protection from doubtful accommodation or business practices.

The work was released by the United States Government Publishing Office in 2015 as an unillustrated committee print, by the United States House Committee on Homeland Security in September 2015 in an illustrated edition, and as a paperback book in 2016 by Skyhorse Publishing. The report discusses United States citizens leaving their country to gain fighting experience in Iraq and Syria on the battlefield. It notes some linked up with the Syrian Civil War in order to attempt to remove Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad from power, later joining ISIS. According to the work, approximately 4,500 from the Western world left their countries to join ISIS, including over 250 American citizens. The report gives thirty-two recommendations to address the problem, including tactics to stop travels of battlefield soldiers to and from their countries of origin, ways to change executive branch policies, and methods to determine which individuals are planning terrorist activities. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson spoke highly of the report and thanked the Committee for their efforts. Interpol leader J√ºrgen Stock said the recommendations emphasized the need for sovereign states to give materials to each other in collaborative counterterrorism efforts. Anthony D'Amato wrote for the Georgetown Security Studies Review that the report's recommendations were a way to address the \\"critical process\\" and \\"formulate a strategy on disrupting foreign fighter travel in the 21st century.\\" The Brookings Institution cited the report for information on terrorist recruitment tactics. The report significantly affected on the U.S. legislative process related to counterterrorism objectives. Representative Martha McSally spoke out on the floor of the United States House of Representatives in favor the Tracking Foreign Fighters in Terrorist Safe Havens Act, House Resolution 4239. Another bill based on the report, Counterterrorism Screening and Assistance Act of 2016, House Resolution 4314, passed the U.S. House of Representatives in 2016. Yet another bill in the U.S. House of Representatives, the Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel Exercise Act of 2016, House Resolution 4404, was proposed based upon research from the report. The bill was successfully reported to the full U.S. House of Representatives out of committee, as the Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel Exercise Act of 2017, H. Rept. 115-40. It unanimously passed the full U.S. House of Representatives in 2017, as Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel Exercise Act, H.R. 1302. Background Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel was a bipartisan task force made up of members from the United States House Committee on Homeland Security, begun in 2015. Its leadership included chairman Congressman Michael McCaul and ranking member Congressman Bennie Thompson, and lead members John Katko and Loretta Sanchez. Additional membership included United States Representatives Barry Loudermilk, Filemon Vela Jr., John Ratcliffe, Donald Payne Jr., Will Hurd, and Martha McSally. The writer of the book's foreword, Malcolm Nance, is a retired U.S. Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer in naval cryptology, who served in the U.S. Navy from 1981-2001. His books on the subject matter of the report include: The Terrorists of Iraq, An End to al-Qaeda, Terrorist Recognition Handbook, Defeating ISIS, and Hacking ISIS. The need for the report was emphasized prior to its executive summary with quotations from President of the United States Barack Obama, FBI director James Comey and former United States Attorney General Eric Holder. Obama warned that with globalization came an increased risk of terrorists passing through the borders of the United States in order to cause harm to U.S. citizens. Comey wrote that terrorists who had garnered battlefield experience in Iraq and Syria posed a threat if they were able to travel to the U.S. Holder said the Syrian Civil War created a fertile bed for Islamic extremism and the U.S. needed to be alert to prevent U.S. citizens from traveling there and returning to their country of origin to commit attacks. During the course of their research for the report, members of the bipartisan task force traveled to foreign countries in order to speak with government workers and intelligence community leaders about the subject matter to gain more expertise in the area. Work for the report's publication was completed in 2015. The book was first published in paperback format by Skyhorse Publishing in 2016. An e-book edition was released the same year. Contents summary The report discusses the significant problem of United States citizens leaving their country of origin in order to gain fighting experience in Iraq and Syria on the battlefield. The report documents that the amount of U.S. citizens who have tried to gain access to battlefield areas in order to fight alongside foreign terrorists numbers in the hundreds. The report faults the Obama Administration for failing to take enough action on the matter, writing, \\"The U.S. government lacks a national strategy for combating terrorist travel and has not produced one in nearly a decade.\\" The report notes that subsequent to 2011 citizens from 100 different sovereign states have left their countries of origin in order to join the battlefields in Iraq and Syria. The first waves of individuals joined the Syrian Civil War in order to attempt to remove Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad from power. The majority of these individuals then afterwards joined up with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) in an attempt to grow the global expansion of the terrorist group. According to the work, approximately 25,000 individuals left their home countries to join ISIS and related terrorist initiatives; this figure includes about 4,500 from the Western world and more specifically over 250 American citizens. The authors of the report back up their conclusions with multiple primary source documents including travel to the areas in question, interviews with subjects, examination of key records, and prior briefings to the United States House Committee on Homeland Security. The report recommends thirty-two main objectives to the United States Executive Branch, including tactics to stop travels of battlefield soldiers to and from their countries of origin, ways to change executive branch policies, and methods to determine which individuals are planning terrorist activities. Significant conclusions of the report include the main objective, that American foreign policy and homeland security policies must adapt to better stem the tide of U.S. citizens traveling to and from distant battlefields. The report identifies police officials from the non-federal level who have cited their own personal worries about lack of resources in the form of security clearances in order to help the federal government deal with counterterrorism. The report identifies weak spots along the chain of foreign travel where terrorists are able to slip out of counterterrorism oversight capabilities. The authors of the work describe holes in law enforcement checkpoints both within the United States and more significantly in European countries where it is increasingly not difficult for terrorists to travel back and forth to the Western world. The Skyhorse paperback edition includes a foreword by Malcolm Nance that gives background on the conclusions of the report. Nance emphasizes the significant necessity of a coherent plan to stem American terrorists from exiting the country and then returning again from war-torn zones in order to commit criminal acts back in their home country. Nance concludes his foreword writing, \\"This Final Report of the Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel is a keystone study of ISIS's ability to recruit terrorists from or in their home nations to abandon all they have ever known and launch themselves as a virtually programmed corps of human guided weapons globally.\\" Reception U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson spoke highly of the report and thanked the Committee. United States Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson wrote positively of the report, saying, \\"I thank the House Homeland Security Committee, in particular Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson, for their work examining the critical issue of foreign terrorist fighters traveling to Syria and Iraq. The report published by the Committee‚Äôs bipartisan task force is an important assessment of how we in the U.S. government can enhance our efforts to counter the foreign terrorist fighter threat.\\" Johnson concluded, \\"The threat of foreign terrorist fighters requires the comprehensive efforts of all our partner agencies and allied nations. We will continue to adapt to this evolving threat and take necessary action to protect the American public. As we move forward, my Department will maintain a close working relationship with Congress on this issue.\\" Interpol praised the recommendations in the document, with the United States Department of Justice reporting about its leader J√ºrgen Stock, \\"Welcoming the report, Interpol Secretary General J√ºrgen Stock said its findings once again underlined the absolute necessity for countries to share information on foreign terrorist fighters.\\" Anthony D'Amato wrote for the Georgetown Security Studies Review that, \\"In the age of unprecedented global connectedness and mass communication, we have to formulate a strategy on disrupting foreign fighter travel in the 21st century. Policymakers can start this critical process by examining the findings of the Homeland Security Committee Task Force‚Äôs Final Report on Combating Foreign Fighter Travel.\\" D'Amato concluded, \\"While the Homeland Security Committee report does not offer any lasting solutions to the crisis we are in, one thing is certain: if we keep doing what we are doing, we will most certainly be further away from that vision of a world without terrorist organizations than we were a few years ago.\\" The report became a resource cited by the Brookings Institution which noted terrorist entities use tools online in order to promote violent extremism via the Web to their followers and for recruitment purposes. Impact Representative Martha McSally sponsored legislation based on the report, which unanimously passed the full U.S. House of Representatives in 2017. Final Report of the Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel influenced subsequent legislation in the United States Congress about counterterrorism prevention and response. Representative Martha McSally spoke out on the floor of the United States House of Representatives in favor the Tracking Foreign Fighters in Terrorist Safe Havens Act, House Resolution 4239. Representative McSally cited her experiences and work on the task force a part of her rationale for supporting the resolution, which she called \\"important legislation\\". McSally noted the suggestions to the Executive Branch of the United States made in the report, and noted the bill, is \\"the direct result of one of these recommendations.\\" Another bill based on the report, Counterterrorism Screening and Assistance Act of 2016, House Resolution 4314, passed the U.S. House of Representatives in 2016. Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul said of the bill's passage in the U.S. House, \\"Nearly 40,000 jihadists from around the world have gone to fight in Syria and Iraq with groups like ISIS. Today the House acted decisively to shut down the jihadist superhighway that allows extremists to get to their safe havens‚Äîand return to the West, prepared to strike America and our allies. This legislation will streamline and elevate U.S. efforts to combat terrorist travel and make sure we are focusing our attention where it is needed most.\\" Yet another bill in the U.S. House of Representatives, the Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel Exercise Act of 2016, House Resolution 4404, was proposed based upon research from the report. Sponsored by Martha McSally, the bill would require \\"the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to develop and conduct an exercise to evaluate the nation‚Äôs preparedness against the threat of foreign fighters and terrorists.\\" H.R. 4404 would necessitate the Department of Homeland Security to carry out a practice \\"scenario involving persons traveling from the United States to join or provide material support resources to a terrorist organization abroad and terrorist infiltration into the United States\\". The bill was successfully reported to the full U.S. House of Representatives out of committee, as the Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel Exercise Act of 2017, H. Rept. 115-40. The bill passed the full U.S. House of Representatives in 2017. It was passed unanimously in the U.S. House as Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel Exercise Act, H.R. 1302.

South Carolina voters chose 8 representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Background For six decades up to 1950 South Carolina had been a one-party state dominated by the Democratic Party. The Republican Party had been moribund due to the disfranchisement of blacks and the complete absence of other support bases as the Palmetto State completely lacked upland or German refugee whites opposed to secession.Phillips, Kevin P.; The Emerging Republican Majority, pp. 208, 210 Between 1900 and 1948, no Republican presidential candidate ever obtained more than seven percent of the total presidential voteMickey, Robert; Paths Out of Dixie: The Democratization of Authoritarian Enclaves in America's Deep South, 1944-1972, p. 440 ‚Äì a vote which in 1924 reached as low as 6.6 percent of the total voting-age populationMickey; Paths Out of Dixie, p. 27 (or approximately 15 percent of the voting-age white population). This absolute loyalty began to break down during World War II when Vice-Presidents Henry A. Wallace and Harry Truman began to realize that a legacy of discrimination against blacks was a threat to the United States' image abroad and its ability to win the Cold War against the radically egalitarian rhetoric of Communism.Fredericksen, Karl A.; The Dixiecrat Revolt and the End of the Solid South, p. 52 In the 1948 presidential election, Truman was backed by only 24 percent of South Carolina's limited electorate ‚Äì most of that from the relatively few upcountry poor whites able to meet rigorous voting requirements ‚Äì and state Governor Strom Thurmond won 71 percent, carrying every county except Anderson and Spartanburg. Despite Truman announcing as early as May 1950 that he would not run again for President in 1952,Truman, Harry S.; President Harry S. Truman's Office Files, 1945-1953, p. 30 it had already become clear that South Carolina's rulers remained severely disenchanted with the national Democratic Party.Bedingfield, Sid, 'Beating Down the Fear: The Civil Sphere and Political Change in South Carolina, 1940-1962', University of South Carolina Dissertations, 2014, p. 139 Both Thurmond and former Governor James F. Byrnes would endorse national Republican nominee Dwight D. EisenhowerMayer, Michael S.; The Eisenhower Years, p. 767 ‚Äì who ran under an independent label in South Carolina ‚Äì and Democratic nominee Adlai Stevenson II only won narrowly due to two- and three-to-one majorities in the poor white counties that had given substantial opposition to Thurmond in 1948.Strong, Donald S.; 'The Presidential Election in the South, 1952,' The Journal of Politics, vol. 17, no. 3 (August 1955), pp. 343-389. During the first Eisenhower term, South Carolina‚Äôs whites who had supported him became extremely critical because Eisenhower was blamed for Brown v. Board of Education, whose requirement of desegregating the state‚Äôs schools was intolerable. Consequently, state leaders like Thurmond argued that the GOP could not be a useful tool for opposing civil rights, and most of the state‚Äôs Democrats endorsed Stevenson for his rematch with Eisenhower.Mickey; Paths Out of Dixie, p. 233 Byrnes, however, obtained 35,000 petitions for an alternative slate of unpledged Democratic electors, which he naturally endorsed when ballot access was obtained for that slate.‚ÄòSouth Carolina Democratic Party Split‚Äô; The Decatur Daily Review, September 12, 1956, p. 6 Vote In mid- October, the consensus among pollsters was that the state‚Äôs vote would be sharply split between the three slates,See ‚ÄòAssociation with Youth Can Furnish New Confidence in future fo America‚Äô; Florence Morning News, October 17, 1956, p. 4 although polls just before election day suggested that Stevenson was likely to carry the state.‚ÄòSouthern Negroes Seen Casting Heaviest Vote Since Reconstruction Days‚Äô; Tampa Tribune, November 6, 1956, p. 9 Ultimately South Carolina was won by Adlai Stevenson (D‚ÄìIllinois), running with Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver by a more decisive margin than polls predicted. Stevenson gained 45.37 percent of the popular vote thanks to his continued dominance of the upcountry, whilst Eisenhower and the unpledged slate divided the lowcountry vote, with the unpledged slate finishing second with 29.45 percent and Eisenhower ‚Äì this time running under the ‚ÄúRepublican‚Äù banner ‚Äì with 25.18 percent Wealthier whites left Eisenhower for the unpledged slate in large numbers, but unlike in 1952 when the small number of black voters strongly supported Stevenson, Eisenhower gained substantial, even majority, support from blacks able to vote in Charleston and Columbia. The 1956 election in South Carolina marks the second of only three times in the 20th century that an incumbent president has finished third in any state. , this is the last election in which Greenville County voted for a Democratic presidential candidate. It is also the last time that Lexington County was not carried by the Republican candidate.Sullivan, Robert David; ‚ÄòHow the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century‚Äô; America Magazine in The National Catholic Review; June 29, 2016 Results =Results by county= { width=\\"65%\\" class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" - ! colspan=\\"1\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" County ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Adlai Stevenson II Democratic ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Dwight David Eisenhower Republican ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Unpledged Electors States‚Äô Rights ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Margin ! colspan=\\"1\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  Total votes castScammon, Richard M.

She attended the University of Chicago Laboratory School and Putney School. She obtained an A.B. from Radcliffe College in 1955 and M.Ed. from the University of Virginia in 1962. Career During graduate school, Gregory worked at the Putney Graduate School of Teacher Education from 1957 to 1958, Highlander Folk School in 1958, and at the Catholic Worker from 1959 to 1962. In 1959, Day recorded in Catholic Worker, \\"Judith Gregory is, at present, in Tennessee, working for a while with Highland Folk School, which is fighting injustice and malice and evil on the interracial front.\\" After completing her M.Ed., she worked at the Harvard College Bureau of Study Counsel from 1962 to 1973. From 1960 to 1970, she served as an editor for the Catholic Worker. Ammon Hennacy noted her presence in his autobiography The Book of Ammon, writing, \\"When Judith Gregory was here she was interested in farming communes and co-op housing.\\" In her diary, Dorothy Day recorded her wish that Gregory become her executor: > To Dorothy Tully to sign will. Judith [Gregory] is responsible if Chas and I > both die. > Then to lunch with Chas... Delightful day. Day also described her: > When Judy is in the city working at St. Joseph's House, she keeps her nose > buried in desk work. She sits there answering the mail, answering papers, > and filing orders for books and pamphlets‚Äìand carrying on the most heated > discussions on anything from religion with any of the college crowd who > happen to drop in. In 1975, she moved to Jaffrey, New Hampshire, studied permaculture with originator Bill Mollison, and co-founded Gap Mountain Permaculture Center and the Gap Mountain Land Trust. Personal and death Gregory was a permaculturalist and eco-feminist. She headed the Palache Family Land Trust, Inc., from 1994 until its dissolution in 2001. She died on 20 January 2017. Legacy Gregory's papers serve as important sources on the life of Dorothy Day. (See \\"Works\\" below for list of books that use her papers as a source.) She has confirmed Day's authority among those around her. She herself also wrote of Day: > Dorothy was not a good listener. She was impatient to be off to her own > work... When... asked if she had really drunk Eugene O'Neill under the > table, she said testily, \\"When you stay up all night you have to have > something to keep you going\\"... Dorothy was by no means always repressive > and severe. She could enjoy the comic aspect of things. In the winter of > 1962, some young people started a magazine called F- You, and composed it > in the Catholic Worker office. When Dorothy discovered this, she told them > to leave. They were taken in by the American Friends Service Committee, > where they changed the name of the magazine to F- Thee. When Dorothy heard > about this, she laughed out loud. Gregory was a lesbian and member of the Lesbian Alumnae of Radcliffe College. She observed: > While I was at the CW, I heard virtually no talk about sexuality of any > kind... It was different in '61-'62. I don't doubt that such talk was going > on then, but I didn't join in it. Bob (Steed) and I acknowledged later that > we were gay. I don't know if any others did. I never talked with Dorothy > about my sense of myself, my sexuality. In the mid-seventies I wrote a book > that was in a way a coming-out story, and I sent a copy to Bob. I got the > impression that he showed it to Dorothy, but I never knew for sure. She > never spoke of it. I definitely did not feel like sending it to her directly > ‚Äî shy, I guess. > What led me to feel that Dorothy disliked homosexuality, that she felt an > unexamined revulsion from it? I'm not sure. I heard what other people said > about her feelings and views. I'm fairly sure I never heard her speak of > them herself... The subject, homosexuality, which later became one of such > contention, did not exist among us. Nevertheless, she and Day remained lifelong friends‚ÄìDay even made her executor of her will. As a grandchild of Charles Palache, Gregory descended from the Sephardic Pallache family, specifically Joseph Pallache, brother of Samuel Pallache. With regards to her more immediate family, she donated a significant portion of the Palache family's papers to the Schlesinger Library at Harvard University in the 2000s. She helped create a correspondence index for the collection. She helped write about her family's years in California and in Massachusetts. The papers include her own correspondence (e.g., correspondence with Dorothy Day) from 1939 to the 1990s. Her collected papers of family genealogy also cross-reference into other collections and genealogies, e.g., Austrian astronomer Samuel Oppenheim (1857‚Äì1928).

It is an expert-level trail, and considered \\"one of the toughest mountain bike trails in Pisgah National Forest.\\"http://brevardnc.com/mountain-bike Mountain Bike Pisgah National Forest.https://www.youtube.com 2015 Pisgah Race, Stage 5.https://www.youtube.com Mountain Biking Farlow Gap Trail. It is primarily a downhill trail, about in length. It can be combined with other trails to form a loop of about , requiring anywhere from three to six hours to complete.https://www.singletracks.com Farlow Gap.https://rootsrated.com Farlow Gap - Mountain Biking.  Description  Nearly the entire trail is singletrack, and starts with a relatively flat section but quickly becomes fall line into a rock garden. It has been described as \\"brutal\\" and is one of the steepest and rockiest downhill trails in Pisgah National Forest. Many people ride to the left or right of the rock garden, or dismount and walk on one side of it. The trail drops about in , then connects with the Daniel Ridge trail. After the early steep sections, the remainder of the trail includes some short uphill sections, other rocky areas, occasional drops, and other technical sections. The trail also crosses several small creeks, including Shuck Ridge Creek, and one fork of the Davidson River.https://sweetwilder.com Daniel Ridge Loop Trail, Farlow Gap Trail. Trail map, also showing some adjoining trails and forest service roads. A creek running across Farlow Gap trail. The trail is unimproved, so mountain bikers and hikers find their own path to cross the creek. Farlow Gap is usually ridden as part of a loop. This requires riding to the top, starting for example from near the trailhead of the Daniel Ridge Trail, and riding a mostly uphill route of about on a doubletrack trail. A short section of this route runs parallel to, and twice crosses the Art Loeb Trail, shortly before arriving at the starting point of Farlow Gap. After completing the Farlow Gap section, the trail links with Daniel Ridge Trail, which can be taken in one of two directions. Both directions feature more flowy technical riding, both of which return to the start point. A separate short ride from the Daniel Ridge Trail can be taken to see Toms Spring Falls.  Other activities  This trail is used mainly by mountain bikers, but can be equally enjoyed by hikers. Due to the steepness of many sections, horseback riding, and sled-dogging is prohibited. Challenges for hikers include a long strenuous climb when hiking the trail as a loop, rocky sections, and crossing small creeks. Trail rules require mountain bikers to yield to hikers; nevertheless, hikers should be watchful of mountain bike traffic. Mountain bike races sometimes include Farlow Gap as a section of the race, and hikers should either avoid the trail on these days, or be especially watchful. The trail crosses several creeks where water bottles can be filled.  Animals, plants, and geology  There is a variety of birds, reptiles and mammals in the area. Deer, rabbits and bobcats may be spotted by watchful hikers and mountain bikers. Farlow Gap and the Daniel Ridge Trail pass through forests with diverse tree species, including yellow poplar, red oak, black gum, and red maple.https://www.fs.usda.gov Farlow Gap Trail #106. Rhododendron also grows abundantly (sometimes called laurel), and remains green all year, its leaves curling in the winter.https://www.nps.gov National Park Service, Great Smoky Mountains, Blooming Shrubs.  History  The early history of Farlow Gap trail is unclear. Geological documents from the 1940s identify a small mica mine located on the trail.North Carolina Department of Conservation and Development, Bulletin Number 49, \\"Mica Deposits of the Franklin-Sylva District, North Carolina\\", 1946 Small flakes of the shiny mineral are often seen alongside the trail. The site has also been alternately identified as \\"Furlow Gap\\" or \\"Furlough Gap\\" in old historical records.

Lishus, is an American retired professional wrestler. DiMaria began his career in Killer Kowalski's International Wrestling Federation, where he held the IWF Heavyweight Championship, and was an occasional preliminary wrestler for the World Wrestling Federation. DiMaria also competed in International World Class Championship Wrestling where he was known as The Star Warrior. He was one of the most popular stars in the promotion despite never holding a championship title. During the early-2000s, DiMaria reinvented himself as an arrogant \\"heel\\" performer named Ronnie D. Lishus. DiMaria was part of The One Night Stand with partners Edward G. Xtasy and Aaron Stevens in Chaotic Wrestling. During his time with the company, he held both the Chaotic Wrestling Heavyweight Championship and Chaotic Wrestling Tag Team Championship twice with Edward G. Xtasy. He also worked for the Century Wrestling Alliance, New England Championship Wrestling and other Northeastern independent promotions. Professional wrestling career =World Wrestling Federation= In early 1985, DiMaria began working for the World Wrestling Federation as a preliminary wrestler under the name Ronnie Dee. On March 26, DiMaria was defeated by Brutus \\"The Barber\\" Beefcake at the Mid-Hudson Civic Center. He returned to Poughkeepsie the following month teaming with Tony Garea and Jose Luis Rivera against George \\"The Animal\\" Steele, The Iron Sheik and Nikolai Volkoff in a 6-man team match. DiMaria's team lost when he submitted to Steele's flying hammerlock. He made his television debut on the April 20th episode of WWF All American Wrestling against King Kong Bundy at the Civic Centre in Brantford, Ontario. On the May 23rd episode of WWF Tuesday Night Titans, DiMaria took on Ken Patera. DiMaria submitted to a swinging full nelson after a two-minute bout, however, he was attacked by Patera after the match who reapplied the hold until being stopped by referees. He also faced Brutus \\"The Barber\\" Beefcake, Don Muraco, and \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage at the Brantford Civic Centre that year. Near the end of his first WWF run, DiMaria scored a surprise victory over Terry Funk on the October 26th edition of WWF Championship Wrestling. Initially pinned by Funk following an elbow drop, DiMaria was awarded the match via reverse decision after Funk used a branding iron and continued assaulting him after the match was over. DiMaria's last WWF TV appearance was on the May 5th 1986 episode of WWF Prime Time Wrestling in a tag team match with Mario Mancini against The Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart). DiMaria's team lost when he was pinned by Hart following The Hart Foundation's \\"Hart Attack\\" finisher. =International Wrestling Federation= DiMaria wrestled for Killer Kowalski's International Wrestling Federation where he feuded with Mad Dog Richard. On April 20, 1990, DiMaria and Tony Ulysses defeated Mad Dog Richards and Big Al Mac in Brockton, Massachusetts. That same night, DiMaria took part in a 10-man battle royal which was won by his tag team partner. He also held the IWF Heavyweight Championship at one point. The following year, he toured Europe with Road Warrior Animal, Misty Blue, Tom Brandi and other American wrestlers. On March 22, 1991, DiMaria wrestled fellow IWF star Chris Duffy in Vienna. Seven months later, DiMaria teamed with The Cheetah Kid to wrestle Duffy and Johnny Rotten in front of around 1,100 fans in Oslo. =International World Class Championship Wrestling= In the summer of 1991, DiMaria enjoyed a brief but memorable run for the Savoldi family in International World Class Championship Wrestling. He wrestled as The Star Warrior, a mysterious facepaint-clad wrestler somewhat similar to The Ultimate Warrior, who was billed from \\"The Far Corners of the Universe\\". DiMaria made his IWCCW television debut against Georgia Gorilla #1 on August 3, 1991, pinning his opponent with a reverse elbow off the top rope. He quickly became one of the promotion's most popular \\"fan favorites\\" after rescuing \\"Jumpin'\\" Joe Savoldi from The Billion Dollar Babies (Mike Samson and G.Q. Stratus) and manager Kevin \\"The Truth\\" Casey. =Independent circuit= DiMaria spent most of the decade wrestling in the New England area both as The Star Warrior and Ronnie Dee. In addition to IWCCW and the IWF, DiMaria also worked for Richard Byrne's United State Wrestling Federation and smaller independent groups. He also made sporadic appearances as a preliminary wrestler on WWF Monday Night Raw between 1993 and 1994. DiMaria eventually retired The Star Warrior character in the mid-1990s. =Century Wrestling Alliance= In 1996, DiMaria began wrestling for the Century Wrestling Alliance. On March 2, DiMaria defeated Hugh Morrus by disqualification in Waltham, Massachusetts. He eventually became involved in a feud with The Brotherhood led by Tony Rumble. On March 28, 1997, DiMaria was defeated by Knuckles Nelson in Bristol, Rhode Island. He avenged this loss at an Eastern Wrestling Alliance show at Edward Little High School two months later. DiMaria, accompanied by El Mascarado and Baby Black Kangaroo, won the bout by disqualification when the rest of Nelson's stablemates attempted to interfere. On June 27, DiMaria joined Demolition Ax, Vic Steamboat and The Power Company (Dave and Dean Power) in a 10-man tag team match against The Brotherhood (Tony Rumble, Knuckles Nelson, Tre, Rick Fuller and Baldo) at Harry Dellarusso Stadium in Revere, Massachusetts. The match ended in a double disqualification. On October 4, 1997, DiMaria lost to Knuckles Nelson at the Sports Palace in New Britain, Connecticut. He also teamed with Vic Steamboat to defeat Devon Storm and Ace Darling at the same event. =Chaotic Wrestling= One Night Stand By the end of the 1990s, DiMaria had become a \\"rulebreaker\\" wrestling under the name Ronnie D. Lishus. As part of his new in-ring persona, DiMaria formed The One Night Stand with Edward G. Xtasy and were among the first wrestlers signed to contracts with Chaotic Wrestling. A 15-year veteran at that point, DiMaria was considered one of the most experienced wrestlers on the roster. They made their debut in 2000 and quickly worked their way up the tag team division. The One Night Stand spent their first year in the promotion feuding with The Millennium Killaz (Gino Martino and Ali Mohammed). On September 17, 2000, The One Night Stand battled The Millennium Killaz in front an estimated 1,000-1,500 fans at WAAF's annual Locobazooka festival at Worcester's Green Hill Park. The year-long rivalry was voted Feud of the Year by Chaotic Wrestling fans in 2000. Tag Team Champion On October 20, 2000, One Night Stand defeated The Damned (Mad Dog and Draven) at the Worcester Palladium for the Chaotic Wrestling Tag Team Championship. The team lost the title to Spike Dudley and Kyle Storm at Revere's Wonderland Greyhound Park four months later. On February 9, 2001, Master Sandy became the manager for The One Night Stand. In the spring of 2001, DiMaria took on both Ali Muhammed and Gino Martino in singles matches. On March 17, DiMaria lost to Muhammed via disqualification when he was caught passing a foreign object back to his partner at ringside. On April 6, DiMaria unsuccessfully challenged Martino for the Chaotic Wrestling Heavyweight Championship in a no-disqualification match. Ricky \\"The Dragon\\" Steamboat was the special guest referee. The tag team title was vacated on April 14, 2001, after Dudley signed with World Wrestling Entertainment and Storm suffered a shoulder injury, allowing DiMaria and Xtasy to regain the belts after defeating Touch of Reality (Jim the Messenger and Bob Steele) in Andover, Massachusetts the following week. That summer, the team defended the championship against midget wrestler Short Sleeve Sampson with partners Gino Martino and Vince Vicallo. The One Night Stand and Sampson were later included as part of a Boston article on Chaotic Wrestling. Their second championship reign lasted another four months until the team's loss to Little Guido Maritato and \\"Latin Fury\\" Luis Ortiz in Lynn, Massachusetts on August 10, 2001. One Night Stand, specifically Edward G. Xtasy and Aaron Stevens, won the tag titles back at Bryant College that fall. Heavyweight Champion On September 7, DiMaria defeated Gino Martino in Lawrence, Massachusetts to win the Chaotic Wrestling Heavyweight Championship. Marino suffered a serious neck injury during this bout and was out of action for three months. On the October 26 edition of Friday Night Chaos, DiMaria defended the Chaotic Wrestling title in a \\"champion vs. champion\\" match against AWF Heavyweight Champion Tito Santana at North Smithfield High School. The bout ended when The One Night Stand entered the ring to attack Santana as was putting DiMaria in a figure- four leglock. The group continued attacking Santana until they were chased off by Tony Atlas. Santana was declared the winner via disqualification allowing DiMaria to retain the Chaotic Wrestling Heavyweight Championship. Two months later, DiMaria was one of several Chaotic Wrestling stars involved with Toys for Tots. The One Night Stand made their final appearance at Cold Fury 1 on December 14, 2001. The group refused to defend the tag titles as Edward G. Xtasy's contract had expired five days prior to the event. Xtasy delivered a \\"worked shoot\\" in which he criticized Mike Hollow, then head instructor at Chaotic Wrestling's training facility, and announced he was taking his half of the tag team title with him. After a confrontation with announcer Rich Palladino, their opponents John Walters and Vince Vicallo stormed the ring. DiMaria was at ringside during the match and frequently interfered on the team's behalf. This later backfired when DiMaria accidentally knocked out Xtasy with his heavyweight belt and allowed Vicallo to pin Xtasy to win the tag titles. Xtasy was subsequently forced to leave the building by Chaotic Wrestling president Randy Miller and other officials. In the main event, DiMaria lost the heavyweight championship to Luis Ortiz in a Lumberjack match. DiMaria was fired by Chaotic Wrestling that same night. =Later career and retirement= DiMaria and Xtasy briefly resurfaced in New England Championship Wrestling before DiMaria's sudden retirement. On May 21, 2002, they defeated Brian Jury and Kevin Grace at the Good Time Emporium in Somerville, Massachusetts. That summer, The One Night Stand entered a tournament to declare new NECW Tag Team Champions. They were eliminated by Slyk Wagner Brown and April Hunter in the first semi-final match at NECW's second annual Birthday Bash supercard. After the match, both men \\"gave a profanity-laden promo\\" before the house mics were cut and the wrestlers thrown out of the building.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. At the time of its nomination it consisted of 47 resources, which included 32 contributing buildings, one contributing structure and 14 non-contributing buildings. Wilton got its start when the Mississippi and Missouri Railroad, later the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific, was surveyed through this area in 1853. It was named for Wilton, Maine, the hometown of one of the founders. This historic district covers the town's central business district. The buildings were built between 1856 and 1966. Most are attached, two stories tall, a single storefront wide, with exteriors composed of brick. There are a few wood-frame buildings. The buildings on the edges of the district are generally detached. Architecturally, the buildings tend to favor the vernacular forms with influences from the Victorian and revival styles. For the most part, first floors are still occupied with retail establishments and second floors with professional offices or apartments. Civic buildings include the WPA-funded city hall (1939), and the mid-century modern post office (1960). The Wilton Candy Kitchen (1856), the oldest building in the district, and the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Depot (1898) are individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

He was elected following his defeat of the incumbent mayor Ivy Taylor in the runoff for the 2017 mayoral race. Prior to his election, Nirenberg served as a member of the San Antonio City Council for District 8 for two terms. He was sworn into office on June 21, 2017. Background Nirenberg is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent (from Poland and Russia) on his father's side and of mixed Filipino, Malay, Indian, and British heritage from his mother‚Äôs side. Nirenberg's mother and father met while the couple was serving with the Peace Corps in Malaysia. His paternal grandparents immigrated to the United States before World War II, passing through Ellis Island. His Roman Catholic mother is half-Filipino and was born in Penang, Malaysia (then part of the colonial British protectorate of Malaya). His maternal grandmother was Anglo-Indian, born to a Scottish father and an Indian mother, while his maternal grandfather was a Tagalog-speaking Filipino musician with possible roots in Mindanao. Nirenberg, who is Methodist, was raised in the capital city of Austin, Texas. Nirenberg attended Trinity University in San Antonio and graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in communication. He later attended the University of Pennsylvania, from which he earned his Master of Arts in communications. After college, he was a program director for the Annenberg Public Policy Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Election history =2017 San Antonio mayoral race= On December 10, 2016, Nirenberg became the first primary challenger to Ivy Taylor for her position as mayor of San Antonio. On May 6, 2017, the first round of voting was held, with no candidate reaching the required majority of 50% of the vote. Nirenberg and Taylor finished with the two highest vote totals and advanced to a runoff election held June 10, 2017. Although Nirenberg trailed Taylor in the primary vote, he went on to defeat Taylor 54.59-45.41%. In so doing, Nirenberg became the first person in twenty years to defeat an incumbent mayor of San Antonio who sought re-election. =2019 San Antonio mayoral race= Nirenberg declared his candidacy for re-election to the office on January 29, 2019. His primary opponent was identified as Greg Brockhouse, a member of the San Antonio City Council who also took office in 2017 and frequently objected to Nirenberg's platform. The election was scheduled for May 4, 2019, but since no majority was reached by any candidate, a runoff election was scheduled for June 8. In the runoff, Nirenberg was elected to a second term, defeating Brockhouse by a 51.11% to 48.89% final vote. Tenure Although Nirenberg identifies as an independent and ran for office as a nonpartisan politician (in Texas, all municipal elections are officially nonpartisan), he was considered to have run on a more progressive platform. In 2013, Nirenberg endorsed a city ordinance which bans discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation. Taylor, then also a member of the city council, voted against the ordinance. Taylor also opposed the city's filing of a lawsuit against the new state law which defines a misdemeanor offense for municipal officials who refuse to cooperate with federal authorities seeking to halt illegal immigration. Signed by Governor Greg Abbott, the law targets the sanctuary city movement. Nirenberg, conversely, backs the lawsuit. As mayor-elect, Nirenberg called upon the city council to endorse the Paris climate accord even though U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to remove the United States from the agreement. The San Antonio City Council approved a resolution to sign the Paris climate accord one day after Nirenberg's election, and in November 2017, the City Council approved the creation of a Climate Action and Adaptation Plan. This would lead to San Antonio being one of 25 cities awarded the American Cities Climate Challenge grant in 2019 by Michael Bloomberg. In 2019, Nirenberg led the charge to have a Chick-fil-A restaurant removed from the concessions contract at the San Antonio International Airport, citing a conflict with the company's opposition of same-sex marriage. Councilman Greg Brockhouse opposed this decision and called for a re-vote on the decision but it was defeated. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton later began an investigation on the actions of Nirenberg and the San Antonio City Council, claiming the decision was in violation of existing Texas laws, the U.S. Constitution, and even San Antonio's own ethics code.

It began forming in November, 1941, in the Central Asia Military District as a \\"Turkmen National Division\\". Three other cavalry divisions, the 61st, 63rd and the 81st were formed in this district at about the same time, also from men of Central Asian nationalities, and while those divisions became the latest complement of the 3rd Formation of the 4th Cavalry Corps in November, the 97th did not join that Corps until over a year later. When formed, its partial order of battle was as follows: * 279th Cavalry Regiment * 298th Cavalry Regiment * plus an unidentified cavalry regiment.Charles C.

Gaikazyan, but on Feb. 28, 1942 he was replaced by the newly-promoted Major General Yakub Kuliev, who had previously commanded the 21st Mountain Cavalry Division. From August to December the division remained in the reserves of the Central Asia Military District.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, pp. 160, 183, 205, 227, 251 On Aug. 28, Kuliev went on to the post of deputy commander of 4th Cavalry Corps. In January, 1943, the 97th, now under command of Colonel V.A. Koninskii, was ferried across the Caspian Sea by the Caspian Flotilla to Astrakhan to join 4th Cavalry Corps, which was being rebuilt in this area after taking very heavy losses south of Stalingrad during Operation Uranus and Operation Winter Storm. In the event, this effort was abandoned, and the division, along with the rest of the Corps, was disbanded in March.Sharp, \\"Red Sabers\\", p. 70 References ;Notes ;Sources * p. 363 External links *Yakub Kulievich Kuliev 97 Military units and formations established in 1941 Military units and formations disestablished in 1943 ","title":"97th Cavalry Division (Soviet Union)"},{"id":"54274557","text":"Amparo Meza Cruz (24 April 1920 - 12 January 2002), known by her stage name Amparo Montes, was a Mexican singer, famous for her renditions of popular boleros by Agust√≠n Lara and Gonzalo Curiel.
