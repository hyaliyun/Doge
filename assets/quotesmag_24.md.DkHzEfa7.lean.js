The bank is a member of the Association of German Banks and its deposit protection fund as well as a member of ATM network CashPool.  Business areas  As universal bank Bankhaus Bauer offers all banking services. Traditionally as private bank it focuses on wealth private and business clients as well as corporate clients.  History  The business was founded in 1931 as a limited partnership business entity by banker Richard Bauer under the name Bankhaus Bauer KG in Stuttgart. During World War II the business offices were destroyed in a bomb attack. At short notice the headquarter was moved to Schwäbisch Gmünd in 1944. After the war finished the headquarter was moved back to Stuttgart in 1945. In 1986 the business was converted into the joint-stock company Bankhaus Bauer AG. In 1992 the Schuppli-Gruppe in Wiesbaden, the Hypothekenbank in Essen AG and the Hypothekenbank in Berlin AG joined the business. The shares of the Schuppli-Gruppe and the Hypothekenbank in Berlin AG were taken over by the Commerzbank AG in 1994, which then became majority shareholder of the Bankhaus Bauer AG. In 2001 the Schuppli-Gruppe, which also owned the Düsseldorf Hypothekenbank AG, again purchased the majority of the bank. Under executive board spokesman Wolfgang Kuhn the banks investment volume between 1997 and 2006 was increased to more than 700 million Euros. In May 2006 Kuhn left the Bankhaus Bauer AG at his own request. In the light of the new Mortgage Bond Act the Schuppli-Gruppe merged its two subsidiaries Düsseldorfer Hypothekenbank AG and Bankhaus Bauer AG in 2006. The Bankhaus Bauer AG was added to Düsseldorfer Hypothekenbank AG and operated as its non- independent branch. In 2010 the Bankhaus Bauer AGs re-founding or spin-off took place. Majority shareholder of the new business was the Raiffeisenbank Reutte reg.Gen.m.b.H. from the Austrian Reutte in Tirol. In March2015 the BB Beteiligungs GmbH in Essen purchased the shares the Raiffeisenbank Reutte reg.Gen.m.b.H. had owned. The present businesses and client contacts are completely continued. Business strategies are supposed to be extended in the following years. Expansions in new business areas as well as new offers in the area of funding are planned. The first expansion looked at opening a new branch in Essen in January 2017 for which BHF-Bank-Manager André Weber was employed manage the private customer service in Essen.

The springs uphill from the site were reportedly discovered by pioneer Daniel Boone, who suggested the site would be a good location for a mill.Per video at U.S. Army Corps of Engineers webpage. The mill is a three-story frame building upon a basement, in plan, supported by large stone columns. Its 1972 NRHP documentation states: \\"When the present structure was erected in 1877, a wooden wheel of 28 feet height was installed. When it was sold in 1907, the 28 foot wheel was removed and the present 40 foot high, 3 feet in breadth, wheel was installed.\\" With It goes on to state that \\"The site includes the actual mill, the numerous springs and a small area which has been converted into a small roadside park. There is also a small frame building, formerly used as a granary, which is presently used by the Monticello Woman's Club as a gift shop.\\" It was deemed \\"important because of its historical role in the local commercial trade; in the fields of industry and engineering because of the unusual 40 foot wheel.\\" The mill was restored by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1976. Includes video and photos. The site is open on weekends, seasonally, for visitors to tour and see corn being ground.

Little is known about this work in particular because it is not on display in a public museum or gallery but instead in a private collection, specifically the Alice Neel Estate. However, details of the work can be inferred through comparison to her other paintings. This piece was painted in oil on either canvas or linen, as most of her paintings at this time were. Neel rejected traditional portraiture and the aesthetic value that came along with it. She used people as an outlet to display the human condition and her own emotional and political journey. Due to her brutal honesty and interest in naturalism when depicting people, her style fell somewhere between expressionism and realism, as can be seen in the raw emotion and humanity she is able to capture in all of her paintings.  Background By 1972, Neel was nearing the end of her life and was living in New York City. 1972 also marked the beginning of the \\"New Right\\" in which conservatives reacted to the changes occurring through the Civil Rights Movement, the Feminist Movement, and the interest in the Communist Party. Neel was a Communist for almost her entire life and her radical political views are apparent in who she painted and the way she painted them. Neel always chose to paint average, every day, and underrepresented people. Dana Gordon depicts an everyday man, presumably of middle or lower class. He is not wearing any shoes and he looks tired, worn out, and dirty, the bags under his eyes emphasized through heavy shadowing. By painting him in this way she displays a specific side of his humanity. He appears as someone who has been beaten down by America's Capitalist and war-obsessed economy, as 1972 was three years before the end of the Vietnam War. The muted colors hint at the isolated existence this man lived, mirroring the feelings of someone beaten down by the unobtainable “American Dream.”  Formal qualities  In the piece, Neel utilizes color and line in order to communicate human emotion and the relationship between subject and environment within the artwork. Neel uses color to depict the man in this beaten down and emotionally drained way. The man's shirt, paints, and chair are all painted in different blue colors while the man's hair and skin are of varying browns. The color palette is generally cool, giving the painting a somber and lonely tone. The lack of warmth emphasizes the lack of life within the subject. However, the skin and hair of the man are warmer in undertone, demonstrating the human emotion felt by the man despite his apparent lack of enthusiasm. The wall in the background of the piece is cream, brown, and blue, like the figure, tying together the subject in the foreground to the wall in the background and further emphasizing the connection of emotion and the relationship the subject has with his environment. In addition to color, line is used in the painting in order to guide the viewer's eye. Lines are painted on both the man's shirt and the chair in which he is sitting, similarly to the motif of blue throughout the artwork. The striped blue chair featured in this painting is present in a number of Neel's artworks, tying her paintings together like a thread. Images with the blue chair present seem to denote that the object was commissioned by the subject or that the subject came to Neel's home to be painted. Her own self-portrait depicts her sitting in the same blue chair, indicating it as a piece of furniture in her home. The lines on the chair lead the viewer's eyes up the subject to his face which holds the bulk of his humanity and apparent strife. As aforementioned, the man appears tired and worn down. His facial features most clearly exhibit this: his dark under-eye bags, his scraggly beard, his long, unkempt hair, and his wrinkled face. The lines she paints create a coherent flow from one aspect of the painting to another, further emphasizing the relationship between subject and environment. Soft lines are used in the wall to create a pattern, separating it from the foreground.  Purpose  This painting is not particularly different from her others; she largely painted portraits of people who she either knew personally or who commissioned portraits from her. Due to this portrait being named after the subject himself, the painting was most likely commissioned by the man for his own personal ownership, before being handed over to the Alice Neel Estate.Georgia Museum of Art, Alice Neel: The Woman and her Work: 7 September – 19 October 1975, 98. She painted both people and the political climate in which they were involved, as can be seen in the quote “I want my portraits to be specifically the person and also the Zeitgeist.” References Category:1972 paintings Category:Portraits by American artists Category:20th- century portraits ","title":"Dana Gordon"},{"id":"57223837","text":"The Jones model is a growth model developed in 1995 by economist Charles I. Jones. The model is essentially identical to the Romer model (1990), in particular it generalizes or modifies the description of how new technologies, ideas or design instructions arise. This should take into account the criticism made of the Romer model that the long-term growth rate depends positively on the size of the population (economies of scale). This is problematic in several respects: on the one hand larger countries do not necessarily grow faster. On the other hand, an increasing population or intensified research work did not increase the growth rate on average. Furthermore, the extent of influence from the current state of knowledge on new inventions (standing on shoulders effect). Model Structure For a single company i According to the following modeling applies to the emergence of new ideas or design instructions: :\\\\dot A_i = \\\\delta \\\\cdot A(t)^\\\\phi \\\\cdot L_A(t)^{\\\\lambda-1} \\\\cdot L_{A_i}(t) With :L_{A}:: Number of employees in the research sector :A: Technology level :\\\\dot A refers to the derivation of the variables A A after the time, so \\\\dot A= \\\\frac{\\\\partial A(t)}{\\\\partial t} where the parameters take the following values: 0 < \\\\lambda < 1; \\\\phi < 1, For parameter values of \\\\lambda = \\\\phi = 1 results in the Romer model (\\\\dot A = \\\\delta \\\\cdot A \\\\cdot L_A). After aggregation across all companies results: :\\\\dot A = \\\\delta \\\\cdot A(t)^\\\\phi \\\\cdot L_A(t)^{\\\\lambda}. Here the parameters have the following meaning: * \\\\lambda lambda restricts the effect of additional labor input in the research sector. Although more researchers are producing more ideas , each researcher is contributing less and less. This relationship is also called standing-on-shoes effect (step on your feet, see also yield law ). This parameter reflects a possible negative externality of the duplication. For a single company, however, this problem does not exist because within a research department, all researchers know about the work of their colleagues. * \\\\phi < 0 : A negative value aims at giving only finitely many potential new ideas for a given time. This case is also referred to as a fishing-out effect: over time, the relatively \\"simple\\" inventions are made first; Today, it is becoming increasingly difficult to develop a new drug. * \\\\phi = 0 : Here, productivity in the research sector would be independent of existing knowledge. For example, a physicist should be able to develop the same new ideas, whether he lives today or 100 years ago (an unrealistic case). * \\\\phi > 0 : Describes in principle a positive externality and the case encountered in reality. The current state of the art is to a certain extent involved in research. The standing-on-shoulders effect is only weakened compared to the Romer model. Growth rate In the Jones model, growth in steady state is given by: : \\\\frac{\\\\dot{\\\\hat{A(t)}}}{\\\\hat{A(t)}} = 0 \\\\quad \\\\Leftrightarrow \\\\quad \\\\hat{A(t)} = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda \\\\cdot n}{1 - \\\\phi} n for the growth rate of persons working in the research sector.

Rebecca watches sullenly from outside the room. It transpires that after Rebecca's birth, Dawid and Allison moved to London, which Dawid hoped would allow him to write more freely about the Apartheid government. Marta has waited for Dawid's return since he left, seeming not to have ever given up hope that he would return. Dawid appears as a character onstage; a reflection of the memories being voiced by the women. After being diagnosed with Leukemia, Dawid returned to Karoo, intending on reconciling with his estranged daughter, Rebecca. Though Rebecca intended on confronting him about how he ruined her and her mothers' lives on the night before his death, Rebecca never actually revealed her identity to him, leaving Dawid with a final sense of failure. Dawid dies less than a month after returning to Karoo.

Madland was born in 1977 October 5 in Sangasar, Slemani Governorate, in Iraq. In 1998, Madland moved with his family to Norway, seeking refugee status, due to the prolonged conflict in Iraq. With the start of the Iraq War, Madland returned to Erbil and quickly became a star within the Kurdish community with the release of \\"Ba Beto\\" in 2003. He permanently moved back in 2010, and settled in the KRG capital of Erbil. Madland made his first national television appearance in 2009 on Kanal 4's show Evin Jin U Jyan. Due to the popularity of this appearance, he was invited back on the channel, this time on the Aramo Show. With this he established a close relationship with the two Kurdish stars. The 3 started to work on productions for the TV channel Kurdmax, and eventually by 2011 they moved the Evin Jin U Jyan show to the new channel. For two years, Madland was part of the production and directing team that generated the number one entertainment show in the Kurdistan Region according to IPSOS. In 2013, Madland, along with Evin and Aramo, decided to start their own channel, that would focus on business and entertainment. NET TV was dubbed as the first Kurdish economics channel, going on air from a makeshift studio in Oscar Hotel, in Erbil. In early 2014, Madland became the host of his own show called \\"Legal Daniel Gorani Ble\\", every Friday night, inviting singers from Turkey and the Iraqi Kurdistan Region to perform. After the invasion of Mosul by the Islamic State in June 2014, the KRG economy collapsed, leading to Madland changing the direction of the channel from economy to entertainment only. In 2016, the channel moved its studios to Babylon Media's headquarters in Ankara, Erbil. With the move, Madland produced and directed other shows throughout NET TV, leading it to be a top channel in the Kurdish community throughout the world.

Life  = Provenance and early years = Theodor Leipart was born into a Protestant family, the seventh of his parents' twelve recorded children, in Neubrandenburg, then in the eastern part of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, a grand duchy in the North German Confederation. Ernst Alexander Leipart (1831-1885), his father, was trained and had worked initially as a self- employed tailor specialising in women's dresses. By the time Theodor was born, however, his father had a more itinerant job, travelling for the \\"Bettfeder- Reinigungs-Anstalt\\" (literally, \\"Bed-springs cleaning institution\\"). His mother, born Wilhelmine Charlotte Friederike Schmidt, was the daughter of a machinist. She travelled with her husband, possibly working with him on the bed-springs cleaning, while Leipart was brought up by his maternal grandparents in Neubrandenburg. It was here that he attended middle school and here, in 1881, that he was confirmed into the church. His schooling was made possible through funding from a local \\"syndikus\\" and brought him into contact, as he later recalled, with some excellent teachers. Looking back, he would speculate that it was this early experience of \\"solidarity between [middle and working] classes\\" that made him a \\"less radical\\" socialist than he might otherwise have become. Pride in his working-class background and loyalty to those class roots would nevertheless remain defining themes throughout his life. Between 1881 and 1885 he lived in Hamburg, training for work as a \\"Drechsler\\" (a skilled lathe operator working, at that time, almost exclusively with wood). He had wanted to train as a gardener, but two of his uncles were lathe operators, and had offered to take him on as a trainee without charge. Having completed his training, in 1886 he joined the Social Democratic trades union movement. That year he was elected to the executive of the Hamburg section of the German Lathe-operators' Union (\\"Deutsche Drechslerverband\\"). =The Woodworkers' Union (\\"Holzarbeiterverband\\")= Over the next few years he held a succession of trades union appointments. In July 1893 the Lathe-operators' Union was merged into the newly formed Woodworkers' Union (\\"Holzarbeiterverband\\"), which had its national head office, till 1919, in Stuttgart. In 1908 Leipart became chair of the Woodworkers' Union in succession to Carl Kloß. He retained his position at the top of what was, at the time, one of Germany's principal trades unions till 1919. In 1904, he also became the first secretary of the International Union of Wood Workers. = Württemberg Landtag = As imperial Germany made way for republican Germany, during 1919 the Woodworkers' Union moved its national headquarters from Stuttgart to Berlin, and Leipart relinquished the union chairmanship. At around the same time, in the People's State of Württemberg (\\"Volksstaat Württemberg\\"), he accepted an invitation to join the regional government as Minister for Labour under the regional minister-president Wilhelm Blos in July 1919. That appointment lasted just over a year, since the Blos government collapsed in August 1920. Meanwhile, on 6 June 1920 the first regional elections of the republican era were held. The Social Democrats received 17 seats in the 100 seat regional legislature (Landtag), making them the third largest party, albeit by a very narrow margin, behind the Farmers' and Vintners' Party in second place and the Catholic Centre Party which topped he poll that year. Theodor Leipart was listed high enough up on the SPD candidate list for him to receive one of the party's seventeen seats. He resigned his Landtag membership on 14 February 1921, however, after slightly more than eight months. = Allgemeiner Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund (\\"General German Trades Union Federation\\" / ADGB) = His brief parliamentary career had never been more than a sideline. The real focus for Leipart's talents and interests remained the trades union movement. Alongside his friend and comrade Carl Legien he played a pivotal role during the war and the ensuing period of social and political turmoil in the creation of the Allgemeiner Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund (\\"General German Trades Union Federation\\" / ADGB), an amalgamation of 52 trade unions and other similar groupings. The drafting of the ADGB's statutes and the accompanying \\"programme of guidelines\\" (\\"... Richtlinien\\"), designed to place the movement ever more firmly on the path towards a free trades union movement, were chiefly his work. Following the sudden death of his \\"comrade in arms\\", Carl Legien, Leipart was elected to succeed Legien as chairman of the ADGB by the executive committee on 19 January 1921, an election that was endorsed by a full congress vote on 24 June 1922. That same year he was appointed vice-president of the International Federation of Trade Unions (IFTU). Between 1921 and 1925 he belonged to the executive council (\\"Verewaltungsrat\\") of the International Labour Organization (ILO). In addition, he continued to serve as chair of the National Economic Council and in a succession of other trades union related institutions. He also founded \\"Die Arbeit\\" (literally, \\"Work\\"), a trades union monthly news magazine which appeared between 1924 and 1933. Between 1922 and 1933, as leader of Germany's trades union movement, Leipart earned plaudits for the skill and patience with which he was able to integrate hitherto opposed groupings and works councils. He advanced in practical ways the concept of economic democracy and he was an eloquent advocate for trades union autonomy and responsibility. He was never a man for confrontation, preferring to apply compromise and flexibility in response to changing political currents and shifting power balances. The strategy worked very well during the early years of the German republic and the savage challenges of the inflation crisis. However, as later commentators, able to view history through the revealing prism of subsequent events, were quick to point out, the instinct for compromise did nothing to arrest the tide of post-democratic populism that came to the fore after 1929. There were those who later blamed the success of Nazism on the so-called \\"Leipart way\\" (\\"Leipart-Kurs\\"), which historians have subsequently competed to explain, justify or condemn. = Responding to political crises = 1932 was a year of two general elections, which together seemed to demonstrate that support for political extremism had reached such a level that the parties committed to a democratic political structure could no longer exclude the populists from power. On 22 June 1932 the ADGB executive issued a declaration to the effect that the struggle against the common enemy made it an imperative duty, incumbent on the entire German labour movement, to operate a united front. That the ADGB, representing the trades union element movement within that united front, and in particular the leadership of the ADGB, would play a central mediating role, was recognized on all sides. The problem with this analysis was that the German labour movement rested on two principal pillars: the Social Democrats and the Communists. Taking their lead from Moscow, but also mindful of their origins as a breakaway movement from the Social Democrats that had split because of opposition to support for the war, the German communists opposed the Social Democrats with a hatred and passion worthy of the Nazi Party itself. There would be no common cause between Social Democrats and Communists. On 14 October 1932 Theodor Leipart delivered a keynote speech to the ADGB national \\"trades union college\\" (\\"Bundesschule des ADGB\\") at Bernau (Berlin). He asserted that at a time of intensifying political crisis, the ADGB were no longer inclined to \\"be bound by party ties\\" (\\"Parteifesseln zu tragen\\"). He presented this as a response to the charge that the ADGB \\"was not sufficiently national\\" (\\"Man wirft uns vor, dass wir nicht national seien\\"). The carefully nuanced formulation was intended to send a message to the increasingly influential Nazi leaders that the unions could no longer be seen simply as an extension of the Social Democratic Party, despite the long-standing ties that bound the two. Attempts by Leipart to strengthen the labour movement by fostering ever greater unity between free trades unions continued, but his apparently persisting hope that the ADGB might be able to stand aside from the looming political confrontations turned out to be hugely over-optimistic. The failure of the mainstream parties to gain a parliamentary majority among themselves, combined with their refusal to enter into coalition with Nazis or Communists, mean that during 1932 Chancellor Brüning resorted to the desperate measure of administering the country through a series of emergency decrees. It provided an unfortunate precedent for 1933. In the meantime, fearful of triggering something even worse, Theodor Leipart and other ADGB bosses went along with Brüning's strategy. The strategy may have bought time for the government, but in January 1933 the Nazis nevertheless took power and lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. The union leaders continued to try and negotiate with the Nazi leadership even after the Reichstag fire. Serious talks took place with representatives of the Nazi business organisation as late as April 1933, although these were massively controversial within the union. Twelve years later, after the Nazi nightmare had run its course, it was put to Leipart that he should have reacted to the Nazi power seizure by immediately calling a general strike. He ascribed the ADGB's failure to confront the changes of January 1933 to various factors, including the crisis levels of unemployment in the country which would have weakened the union's ability to enforce a strike, the fact that the Nazis had already effectively \\"taken over\\" key utilities such as the electricity and water companies, the high level of support that Hitler enjoyed with his \\"middle-class powerbase and entrepreneurs\\" (\\"bürgerliche Kräfte und Unternehmer\\") and, finally, the fact that Hitler had come to power legally, which was (and remains) a judgment widely backed by constitutional experts, and which meant that a general strike against a legitimately installed government would have been an act of insurrection against the constitution itself. Leipart was also criticised at the time and subsequently over the resolution of the ADGB national executive of 19 April 1933, which expanded on his own call on 15 April 1933, that trades union members should participate in Nazi Labour Day celebrations scheduled for 1 May 1933. His reasoning was that he had wanted to protect union members from exposure to Nazi reprisals that would have followed if they had failed to celebrate in public the fascist version of Labour Day. Nevertheless, the verdict of subsequent commentators was that Leipart's non-confrontational approach over this matter further weakened the resolve of socialists who might otherwise have opposed the Nazis in greater numbers and with greater impact than they did. Theodor Leipart was a few months short of his sixty sixth birthday when the Nazis took power, and during the next twelve years he lived, for the most part, quietly in Berlin, and was seen to be politically inactive. He nevertheless remained consistently, if passively, hostile to the Nazis. He repeatedly refused to hand over control of the ADGB to the Nazis \\"voluntarily\\", rejecting the bribe of an enhanced pension if he were to do so. It is fair to charge the union leaders who failed actively to oppose Nazism in 1932 and 1933 of poor judgement, individually and collectively. They completely failed to understand the true character of Nazi populism till it was too late. But there is little evidence to support the accusation of wilful \\"betrayal\\". =Nazi years= The independent trades unions were outlawed on 2 May 1933 and quickly crushed. Theodor Leipart was among those arrested and taken into \\"protective custody\\". He was subjected to physical abuse. An eye-witness later recalled, \\"Leipart's personal courage was beyond question. I was present at one of the Nazi torture chambers in 1933. Nazi paramilitaries threatened him with their pistols cocked, as one of a group of four torture subjects, while trying to extract information about the whereabouts of 'Reichsbanner leader Höltermann'. The old man ... yelled defiantly at the executioners until he collapsed and was carted off to hospital\\". A few days later, on 9 May 1933, the authorities launched a \\"preliminary investigation on account of disloyalty ... against Leipart and comrades\\". The investigation was never concluded and there was no ensuing prosecution, but the actions taken were sufficient to provide a cloak of legitimacy for giving the union leaders criminal records and to create a \\"legal basis\\" for the complete confiscation of the union assets. The Nazis subsequently denied Leipart any of his pension on the grounds that he had \\"abused his office as chairman of the ADGB to promote Marxist aspirations\\". Leipart's term of \\"protective custody\\" turned out to be relatively brief, which according to at least one source was because of his poor health and his wife's intervention, as a result of which he was released in order to spend time in hospital, from where he was able to return to his home. = Final years = During the twelve Nazi years Leipart was able to remain discretely in touch with comrades from the old days, notably Wilhelm Leuschner, Jakob Kaiser und Hermann Schlimme. The old comrades were \\"of one mind, that after the Hitler catastrophe and the devastation of a second 'world war', there should no longer be any place for political or ideological divisions between trades unions, but that only unity could be the order of the day in order to cope with the immensity of the tasks ahead. War ended in May 1945, leaving the western two thirds of Germany divided into four military zones of occupation. Surrounded by the Soviet occupation zone Berlin , where Theodor Leipart still lived, was itself subdivided into military occupation zones, although it would be several more years before physical barriers appeared that would prevent people from walking freely through the ruins and across the political boundaries that now divided the city. Leipart's home had ended up in Berlin's US occupation zone. From the papers left behind when he died, it is clear that during the war years Leipart devoted considerable time and attention to working through the history of the ADGB and other aspects of trades union history in which he had participated. His papers included several lengthy manuscripts on these topics. They confirm that, like many other Social Democrats, he was more than ever committed to political unity both within the labour movement and between the parties of the political left. When in 1946 he became a member of the newly formed Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\"/ SED), it was almost certainly out of conviction and not because he had somehow been pressured into taking the step. The SED was the product of a contentious merger between the old Communist Party of Germany and the Social Democratic Party. Although the political merger seems to have been intended by its backers to apply across the whole of occupied Germany, it really only took effect in those parts of the country administered as the Soviet occupation zone. Shortly before he died, in a discussion over the postwar political situation, Leipart was asked by a reporter about the bitter hostility that the Communists had heaped on the Social Democrats before 1933, in ways which had made it completely impossible for the political left to present a united front against Nazism. Leipart's reply was characteristic: \\"You also need to know how to forget\\" (\\"Man muß auch vergessen können.\\"). The merger that created the SED was enacted in April 1946 through a ballot of party members from both the parties affected. Campaigning was not always friendly. Because he lived in the US sector Leipart was spared from the full impact of the \\"Soviet grip\\" (\\"Zugriff der Sowjets« \\") which he might have expected from canvassers if he had lived in Berlin's Soviet sector, \\"although the comrades attempted to collect the completed ballot paper from me in my apartment\\" (\\"obwohl die Genossen versuchten, bei mir in der Wohnung den ausgefüllten Stimmzettel abzuholen\\"). In order to unify the political left, he was prepared to join the merged party, but he had not been able to bring himself to vote for the party merger that created it, thereby replacing - if only in what later became East Germany - the old Social Democratic Party. By March 1947 there were still plenty of former comrades who remembered 1933 and the failure of the ADGB to take a lead in opposing the slide into what had turned out to be catastrophic dictatorship. He was shunned by most of those whom he once been able to count on as his friends. Theodor Leipart died an isolated figure.  Reflection  Irrespective of how some of his individual judgements may be viewed, it must be concluded that as a \\"democrat out of principle\\" and a social democratic trades unionist, Theodor Leipart made a lasting contribution to the democratic and social security of wage earners in the capitalist context of his time. That provided a solid foundation for further trades union advances after the Second World War. However, if he is to be evaluated in terms of his socialist objectives, striving for equality and freedom for individuals, and the \\"people's solidarity\\" (\\"Volksganze\\"), then since he was basing his aspirations on a supposedly neutral state, he failed because of the underlying political realities of the time. That the creation of the SED failed to create a unified labour movement would have been a final disappointment, but he was spared from that by the timing of his death.

Characteristics  Conodonts are small (≈3 cm), jawless, superficially eel-like animals and are early branching members of the clade Vertebrata. Conodont elements refer to the mineralized structures which are thought to be used in the consumption of foodstuff. These elements articulated together form the conodont feeding apparatus. This complex is uncommon as almost all recorded modern and fossil vertebrates (except hagfish and lampreys) utilize jaws to consume their food, which the conodont animal lacks. The conodont feeding apparatus demonstrates an uncommon solution to an important evolutionary challenge: how to acquire one's food. For a long time, the function and arrangement of these conodont elements was enigmatic as the animal, besides the mineralized elements, was soft-bodied. Upon the conodont animal's demise, the soft tissues would decompose and the individual conodont elements would separate. However, in instances of exceptional preservation the conodont elements may be recovered in articulation. By closely observing these rare specimens, Dr. Derek Briggs and others in 1983 were able to for the first time study the anatomy of the complexes formed by the conodont elements arranged as they were in life. Other researchers have continued to revise and reinterpret this initial description. Two different modes of feeding using these structures are hypothesized active predation, and filter feeding. = Arrangement of conodont elements = The arrangement of elements was first reconstructed from extremely well-preserved taxa by Briggs et al. 1983, although loosely articulated conodont elements are reported as early as 1971. Conodont elements are found within the oral region of the animal, and are organized into three different groups based upon shape. These groups of shapes are termed S, M, and P elements. The S and M elements are ramiform, elongate and comb-like structures. An individual element has a single row of many cusps running down the midline along its top side. Approximately 10 of these conodont elements are arranged towards the animal's anterior oral surface forming an interlocking basket of cusps. Cusp may point out towards the head of the animal, or back towards the tail. The number of S and M elements present as well as the direction they point may vary by taxonomic group. M elements commonly form a symmetric horseshoe, pick-like shape. S elements are further divided into 3 subtypes: * Sa element- unpaired symmetrical ramiform structures * Sb element- paired asymmetrical structures * Sc element- highly asymmetrical, bipennate structures In P elements a pectiniform row of cusps transitions into a broad flat or ridged platform moving towards the top of the element. Platforms and cusps are only found along one side of the structure. Individual elements are arranged in pairs with platforms and cusps oriented towards the animal's midline. P elements are further divided into 2 subtypes: * Pa element- blade-like structure * Pb element- arched structure  Hypothesized feeding modes  Because they are associated with the oral region of the conodont animal, it is accepted that conodont elements are used in the acquisition of food. Two primary hypotheses have arisen as to how this is accomplished. One hypothesis proposed that elements acted as support structures for filamentous soft-tissues. These small filaments (cilia) would be used to filter small planktonic organisms out of the water column, analogous to the cnidoblast cells of a coral or the lophophore of a brachiopod. An alternate hypothesis contests that the conodont elements were used to actively catch and process prey. S and M elements would open allowing prey to be captured with in the oral region of the animal. Cusps of these elements would firmly grip prey while the blade-like P elements would slice like a pair of scissors. Current consensus supports the latter hypothesis in which elements are used for predation, not suspension feeding. Evidence for this includes the isometric growth pattern exhibited by S, M, and P elements. If the conodont animal relied upon a filter feeding strategy then this growth pattern would not provide the necessary surface area needed to support ciliated tissue as the animal grew. In more recent findings, researchers have also identified cartilaginous structures similar to those present in modern hagfish and lampreys which are predatory/scavengers. It is possible that multiple feeding strategies may have arisen in different groups of conodonts as they are a diverse clade. A recent paper has suggested that the conodont genus Panderodus may have utilized venom in the acquisition of prey. Evidence of longitudinal grooves are present on some conodont elements associated with the feeding apparatus of this particular animal. These sorts of grooves are analogous to those present in some extant groups of venomous vertebrates. However, this take on the feeding structure and behaviors of particular conodont animals has been slow to permeate the scientific community and may just be a superficial similarity.  Evolutionary significance  The ability to acquire and process foodstuffs for energy is critical to the success of animals as a whole. With this in mind, the conodont feeding apparatus is evolutionarily significant for three primary reasons. Firstly, these elements demonstrate the first mineralized structures associated with vertebrate animals. Secondly, these structures are present before the rise of the jawed vertebrates. This fact has caused some researchers to called into question the relationship of the conodont group to the clade Vertebrata as a whole. However, current scientific opinion still accepts these animals as members of the vertebrates. Lastly, both the conodont feeding apparatus and jaws arose as solutions to the issue of how to effectively consume prey. The recovery of this complex demonstrates the diversity in body plan with which early vertebrate lineages used to deal with this problem.

It is one of several volcanic fields in Africa whose origin is explained with the activity of mantle plumes and their interaction with crustal structures. Meidob lies at the southern margin of the Sahara. The volcanic field is formed by overlapping lava flows, which cover an area of and emanate from about 700 vents, mainly scoria cones. Lava domes, fallout and pyroclastic flow deposits are also common. Among the vents is the Malha crater, which presently contains a small lake. The volcanic field has erupted rocks ranging from basanite to trachyte and rises from a tectonic uplift known as the Darfur dome. Volcanic activity in Meidob began 6.8 million years ago and continued into the Holocene, with the most recent eruptions dated to 4,900 ± 520 years ago. There are no geothermal manifestations at Meidob, but legends of the local people imply that they witnessed volcanic eruptions in the field.  Name  The term \\"Meidob\\" is derived from a Nubian language where peida means \\"slave\\". It is also a misspelling of \\"Midob\\", such as in \\"Meidob people\\" which is actually Midob people. The Midob people live in the Meidob hills area.  Geography and geomorphology  The Meidob volcanic field lies in northern Darfur and is part of northern Sudan. The towns of Bir Harra, Ein Basoro and Malha are near the volcanic field, while El Fasher is south-southwest from it. The Meidob volcanic field is one among several volcanic fields in northern Africa, such as Al-Haruj, Cameroon Line, Hoggar, Jebel Marra and Tibesti, some of which are considered to be part of a northeast-trending volcanic province. Meidob is a volcanic field which covers an area of in east-west direction. The field consists of cones and lava flows, which form a thick pile in the middle of the field in the form of a plateau. The central area lies at higher elevations than the peripheral parts of the volcanic field and its maximum elevation is . It features fallout and pyroclastic flow deposits in addition to cones and lava flows. Ignimbrites occur in some places. The lava flows are between several metres to several tens of metres thick and reach lengths of more than . The less eroded lava flows have surface features typical of aa lava and pahoehoe lava. Other lava flows constitute so-called \\"mesa\\" flows such as Jebel Arfinur and Jebel Sireir, which are characterized by oval or circular shapes and steep flanks. The field has about 700 vents such as lava domes, maars, mesas, tuff rings and most commonly scoria cones. The scoria cones are typically about high and wide at their base. Many lava flows originate in a scoria cone. Southwestern corner of the Meidob volcanic field; dark spot right of centre is the lake in the Malha crater About thirty maars and craters are found in the field, including the Malha crater (). Malha is a crater about deep and wide. It has been excavated into the basement rock beneath the volcanic field, and is itself surrounded by a rim less than high. Malha contains a salty lake in the middle and several springs fed by an aquifer, and in the northeast side of the Malha crater a lava flow of the Jebel Sowidor lava field has invaded the crater depression. There are other deep and wide craters in the field besides Malha. = Hydrology = The southwestern and northern side of the Meidob volcanic field drain into the Wadi Harra and subsequently into the Wadi Magrur, which flows northeastward when it carries water. In the present day most of the wadis draining the Meidob northeastward such as Wadi Umm Afarit end in inland deltas, in past wet periods they reached the Wadi Magrur. In turn, Wadi Magrur discharged into Wadi Howar, leading to the development of wetlands.  Geology  Mantle plumes and rifting processes are responsible for volcanism in northern Africa; in the case of the Darfur dome volcanic fields such as Jebel Marra, Meidob and Tagabo Hills the most likely explanation is a mantle plume. The location of the volcanism triggered by this plume would be controlled more by the tectonic stress field than by the slow movement of the African Plate, explaining why volcanism began between Jebel Marra and Meidob and then continued in these two fields, which are at opposite sides of the dome. Alternatively, an origin as an intracontinental triple junction has also been proposed but it has been contested on because of a lack of evidence supporting it. Other proposals include the presence of laccoliths. Volcanism elsewhere in northeast Africa has also been attributed to the Red Sea Rift and the Afar hotspot. = Local = Jebel Marra and Meidob lie on an uplifted basement known as the Darfur dome, which consists of various igneous and metamorphic rocks of Precambrian age, Neoproterozoic greenschists and Paleozoic-Mesozoic sandstones including the Nubian Sandstones. These rocks in Meidob are concealed beneath recent volcanic rocks, but eruptions in the field have carried large blocks of basement rock to the surface, and the sediments are exposed in craters such as the Malha crater. The Meidob volcanic field and Jebel Marra with their Holocene eruptions are younger than the Jebel Kussa and Tagabo Hills, which are of Oligocene- Pleistocene and Miocene age respectively. Erosion has exposed their subvolcanic features. The oldest volcanic activity in the region has been dated to 36 million years ago at Jebel Kussa. Tectonic lineaments control both the position of vents and that of dry valleys in the field. There are both northeast-southwest, east-west and northwest-southeast trends, in order of decreasing importance. These lineaments have been active at different times, indicating changes in the regional tectonic stress field. = Composition = The Meidob volcanic field has erupted basalt, basanite, hawaiite as well as benmoreite, mugearite, phonolite and trachyte, forming an alkaline suite of volcanic rocks. Various types of xenoliths are present in the eruption products, while phenocrysts include aegirine, amphibole, anorthoclase, augite, biotite, ulvospinel-magnetite, nepheline olivine, augitic-diopsidic pyroxene and sanidine. The total volume of erupted rocks is about , which was erupted at rates of . Basalt and basanite lava flows make up most of the erupted material. Pyroclastics and lava flows of phonolitic and trachytic composition form the \\"mesa\\" flows and are concentrated in the central part of the field. The more differentiated rocks are prevalent in the more recent rocks. Basanite is a product of mantle melts, which may involve a lithospheric component. Fractionation processes in deep magma chambers and assimilation of crustal materials have been used to explain the genesis of differentiated magmas from the basanitic precursor, with additional processes generating the basaltic and hawaiitic magmas.  Climate and vegetation  Average yearly temperatures at Malha range between . The Meidob volcanic field lies at the southern margin of the Sahara to the Sahel, with precipitation at Malha amounting to mostly during summer months. During the early Holocene between 6,000 and 12,000 years ago, precipitation was considerably higher and orographic precipitation in the Meidob area may have supplied water to their surroundings. The lava fields are mostly barren, with the vegetation of the Meidob volcanic field consisting of grasses and scrubs. Woodland grows along the course of wadis and sometimes within craters.  Eruption history  The oldest volcanic rocks in the Meidob volcanic field have been dated by potassium-argon dating, yielding ages of 6.8 ± 0.2 and 6.5 ± 0.2 million years ago. The Jebel Sireif vent has yielded ages of 1.3 ± 0.4 to 0.6 ± 0.2 million years ago. Volcanism at first took the form of lava emissions. Later, during the Pliocene to Holocene, it was dominated by pyroclastics and lavas. The field has been active during the Holocene, with thermoluminescence and tephrochronology dating giving ages of 14,600 ± 6,600 - 12,200 ± 3,300, 10,100 ± 1,400 at Malha crater, 8,000 ± 1,600 - 7,200 ± 720, 4,150 ± 1,450 BCE, possibly 3,050 BCE and 3,000 BCE, and 4,900 ± 520 years ago for eruptions. One of these recent eruptions had an intensity similar to a Plinian eruption, and a volcanic explosivity index of 4 has been assigned to some eruptions. There are no fumaroles in the field, while hot springs may or may not exist; but legends of the Midob recall that many generations ago, fire erupted from the Malha crater, and that water levels within its lake underwent changes accompanied by sounds. These legends may reflect recent volcanic activity. = Non-volcanic history = Apart from volcanism, aeolian processes and water erosion were active in Meidob, producing widespread sedimentary covers especially at the margins of the field. A number of wadis extend radially away from the centre of the Meidob volcanic field and carry water during flash floods, transporting sediment and floating pumice. Winds transport sediments onto old lava flows and volcanic landforms, but owing to its youth many landforms of the Midob volcanic field are little eroded. During the early and middle Holocene a number of craters contained lakes; some of these have left diatomite sediments and were populated by ostracods living in freshwater. The formation of these lakes began about 12,100 years before present, at Malha 8,290 before present. At Malha to episodes of partial or complete dry-up occurred, the first about 7,000 years before present and the second 2,300 - 2,200 years before present. Today only Malha crater still contains a body of water.  Human use  The Meidob volcanic field was likely used as a source of obsidian, and the Fur people obtained salt from the Malha crater. This crater is an oasis and was also a source of water for the Midob people.

They were a result of long-standing aggression between the rival powers over influence in the border kingdoms of Armenia and Iberia, as well as the desire of Shapur II, after his Arab campaign, to revoke the unfavorable terms of the Treaty of Nisibis, which had concluded the previous war between the empires. Though the Romans under Constantius II were defeated in several sanguinary encounters, Shapur was unable to secure a decisive victory.  Events  = First war:337-350 = In 335, Emperor Constantine sent his son Constantius in preparation for a campaign against the Sasanid Empire. Constantius recruited and drafted new soldiers, implemented training and drills, expanded the cavalry, and stockpiled supplies. These preparations did not go unnoticed by the Sasanids. In 336, Shapur II sent his general Narses to invade Armenia. With the help of the Vitaxa of Aljnik, he captured Amida, defeating Constantius there and at Constantia. Narses, however, was later defeated and killed at a battle against Constantius at Narasara. Following Emperor Constantine's death, Shapur besieged Nisibis, which was then regarded as the key to Mesopotamia. After sixty days, no closer to taking Nisibis and with a plague hampering his army, he lifted the siege and returned to Persia. Although he lost at Nisibis, Shapur collected tribute from the Armenian king Khosrov starting in the year 345/6. In 343/344, Constantius met Shapur's forces near Singara or Alaina. The date of this battle is uncertain. Sources are divided as to the victor of the battle. Some sources state a Sasanid victory, some a Roman victory, while another states a pyrrhic Roman victory. In 346/7 Shapur besieged Nisibis a second time, and was repulsed. In 348, a Sasanid army invaded Roman Mesopotamia and marched on Singara. The fortress city was either besieged or blockaded. While the Sasanids camped around Singara, the Romans launched a nighttime raid on their camp, killing many Sasanid soldiers in their sleep. This disrupted Shapur's 348 campaign. The Sasanid army retreated to their own territory. In 350, Shapur laid siege to Nisibis, for a third time. The dams of the river Mygdonius, which passed near the valley in which Nisibis was located, were broken down, and the valley flooded. When the whole plain was filled with water up to the walls of the city, a Sasanid fleet was embarked and floated to the ramparts. A part of the walls collapsed and the Sasanids withdrew in preparation for the assault. The attack which was launched, supported by Sasanid war-elephants, bogged down in the muddy waters formed by the lake, and Shapur gave the signal to fall back. In the interval of a single night the defenders effected the repair of the walls, this along with news of Hunnic invasions of the eastern provinces, compelled Shapur to a cessation of hostilities against Rome. Before retreating to Persia, Shapur burned all his siege equipment and executed some of his chief officers and advisors. The usurpation of Magnentius in the west occurred around the same time diverting Constantius, who left his cousin Gallus to defend the east. = Interwar: 350-359 = During 350-359 the war between the Roman and Sasanid Empires languished. Constantius was engaged in several campaigns against enemies, both foreign and domestic, while Shapur was occupied with his eastern campaign in the steppes of Central Asia. In 356, however, the Romans made serious overtures towards a lasting peace. Shapur delivered his conditions to the following effect: that should Constantius deliver up the provinces of Mesopotamia and Armenia, which Diocletian had wrested from Narseh under the Treaty of Nisibis. Constantius, though discredited by previous defeats, and even himself secretly doubtful of the outcome of a second war, treated the offer with contempt. Yet, he dispatched civil and military officers accompanied by a sophist on a new embassy to the Sasanid court, advising Shapur II of the necessity of more reasonable grounds for peace. The embassy was dismissed by Shapur when he arrived at Ctesiphon and preparations were conducted for another campaign. = Second war: 359-361 = In 359, Shapur II launched a large scale invasion into Roman Mesopotamia. During this campaign he was assisted by the Roman turncoat Antoninus who had critical knowledge of the Roman defences. With most of the eastern tribes (including the Chionites) now supporting his army, Shapur crossed the Tigris at Nineveh and marched to Singara which he stormed or blockaded. He then marched to Bebase, a major road junction on the Khabur River. From there he could threatened Nisibis to the east and Zeugma, where the main bridge across the Euphrates was located, to the west. He surprised general Ursicinus, whose headquarters was in Nisibis, by suddenly marching toward the Amida to the north. As soon as Ursicinus' spies, including later historian Ammianus Marcellinus, had informed him the Sasanian army had crossed the Tigris, he secured the defenses of Nisibis and proceeded to Amida. After giving orders for the fields of Roman Mesopotamia to be burned to prevent Shapur's army using it as fodder, the population evacuated into the fortified city. With Shapur's crossing of the Tigris secured, Ursicinus fell back to Amida, from which he could harass the Sasanians if they besieged Nisibis or threaten their lines of communication and supply in case they marched west. After setting up his headquarters at Amida, Ursicinus retreated to oversee the defense of the Euphrates. He was intercepted on the march by Sasanian cavalry, barely escaping. His body-guard was dispersed, and in the chaos the survivors were driven into Amida, which was blockaded by the Sasanian vanguard. Six Roman legions: V Parthica, XXX Ulpia Victrix, Magnentius, Decentius, Superventores and Praeventores and a detachment (vexillation) of X Fortenses had been gathered at Amida and took up its defence. The legions Magnentius, Decentius and XXX Ulpia Victrix were remnants of the army of the usurpur Magnentius, and had been sent east by Constantantius at the end of the civil war. Unlike the other legions in the area, these three legions were made up of Gallic soldiers. The numbers of the Roman force at Amida are a point of debate: Crawford puts them at 20,000, Blockley at 7,000–10,000, and Harrel at 5,300. The army of Shapur reportedly numbered 100,000 men. Shapur bypassed Nisibis and reached Bebase. From there, his scouts informed him of the flooding of the Euphrates and a strong Roman fortification on the other bank. Faced with this predicament, Antoninus advised the Sasanid monarch to force march his army and cross the Euphrates northwest of Amida. From there Shapur could advance into the interior of Asia Minor. Marching by way of Horre, Miacarire, Carcha, and the fortresses of Reman and Busan which capitulated on his approach, Shapur arrived beneath the walls of Amida at the end of July. Siege of Amida (359) The walls of Amida, built by Constantius II before the Siege of Amida of 359. Shapur convinced himself that the mere sight of his formidable army would terrorize the city into surrender. Grumbates, king of the Chionites, was sent to threaten the defiant city into submission. But before the king could make known the reason of his approach, a dart from the Roman ballistae struck his son and crown prince killing him instantly. The Sasanids encircled the city on every side; as auxiliaries, the Vertae were assigned the assault of the south wall, the Albanians on the north, the Chionites to the east, and the Segestanis with their war-elephants on the west. The operations of the siege began with a two-day mutual discharge of missiles, following heavy casualties on both sides, a truce was concluded. The Sasanids then set themselves to raising mounds for scaling the walls, and siege towers captured from the Romans in the previous war at Singara. Meanwhile, the forays of the Sasanid cavalry were devastating the surrounding country taking many prisoners and much spoils. Ursicinus, who proposed a bold attack using light infantry to divert the Sasanid blockade, was accused of fomenting a treacherous reverse through his excessive zeal for the relief of the city. A night attack on the Sasanid camp by two Gallic legions from Amida boosted Roman morale and inflicted heavy losses on the Sasanid army, but the loss of 400 Gauls was more devastating to the besieged city. Shapur increased his assaults on the city only to suffer further casualties due to the Roman scorpions and fire darts. Finally the Roman structures, under the bombardment of Sasanid ballistae, collapsed. The Sasanids carried their earth mounds to the level of the ramparts, and swarmed into the city. After a prolonged last-ditch defense the garrison was overpowered, the city sacked and the inhabitants removed to the further reaches of the Sasanid Empire. Count Aelianus and the rest of the surviving Roman commanders were crucified. The siege being successful and autumn arriving, the Sasanids were obliged to return to winter-quarters.  Campaigns of 360  In spring 360, Shapur renewed his inroads into Mesopotamia, besieging the desert town of Singara. The wall was breached after some days by battering ram, and the town fell. The 1st Flavian and 1st Parthian legions which had formed the garrison, as well as the inhabitants of Singara, were sent into captivity in Sasanid Persia. Shapur then invested Bazabde, a strong Roman fortress on the Tigris. He lingered only to repair the walls and post a strong garrison in Bazabde before he proceeded on an expedition against Virtha, a formidable fortress on the outliers of the Mesopotamian desert. But the garrison of Virtha defended themselves successfully and Shapur retired over the Tigris towards the end of the campaign season. In the meantime, towards autumn of 360, Constantius finally arrived at the head of his long-prepared army. The revolt of Julian in Gaul had momentarily delayed the emperor, but his ministers prevailed on him to campaign against the Sasanids. Before crossing the Tigris to face Shapur, Constantius was determined to retake the important fortress of Bazabde. During the ensuing blockade, the Sasanids sallied several times from the city to destroy Roman battering rams and ballistae. With winter beginning, the area was flooded with heavy rains and Constantius' attacks were beaten back, he retreated from Bazabde into Syria and wintered in Antioch.  Campaigns of 361  The following spring 361, Constantius crossed the Euphrates once more, arriving at Edessa. Unwilling to resume the blockade of Bazabde and fearing a costly siege, he sent his two generals, Arbetio and Agilo, to observe the motions of Shapur from the further bank of the Tigris to inform him when the latter should cross the river. Shapur, however, declined to venture over the Tigris and the entire summer of 361 was wasted in ineffectual maneuvering with each monarch on opposite banks of the river. Meanwhile, Constantius had requested reinforcements from Julian in Gaul, the Gallic legions, however, revolted and proclaimed Julian Augustus. On account of the immediate Sasanid threat, Constantius was unable to directly respond to his cousin's usurpation, other than by sending missives in which he tried to convince Julian to resign the title of Augustus and be satisfied with that of Caesar. Constantius saw no alternative but to face the usurper, and yet the threat of an invasion by Shapur remained. Shapur, however, did not attempt another campaign that year. This temporary respite in hostilities allowed Constantius to turn his full attention to Julian. The war ended indecisively with Constantius dying of fever on 5 October 361 at Mobsucrenae.

History The old Dewsbury Infirmary on the Halifax Road The original hospital in Dewsbury was known as the Dewsbury Infirmary and it opened in temporary accommodation at Northgate in 1876. The infirmary moved to a more permanent home on the Halifax Road in 1883: the distinctive new building was designed in the gothic revival style by Kirk & Sons of Dewsbury. After the infirmary had left the site, this building was taken over by the West Riding County Council and was renamed the \\"Municipal Buildings\\" and more recently has simply become known as \\"Boothroyds\\". Instead, in 1930, the infirmary moved to Moorlands Road where it became known as Dewsbury and District General Infirmary. After the infirmary had left the Moorlands Road site, the hospital buildings there were demolished to make way for housing. The present hospital was established on the Dewsbury Union workhouse site at Healds Road in Staincliffe in 1980; the facility was originally known as the Staincliffe General Hospital but is now known as \\"Dewsbury and District Hospital\\". It was announced in August 2017 that the accident and emergency department at the hospital would be downgraded in status to that of an urgent care centre with patients with life-threatening injuries being sent for treatment at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield instead.

This formation notably outcrops around Canyonlands National Park, Natural Bridges National Monument, and Monument Valley of northeast Arizona, southern Utah. The age of the Organ Rock is constrained to the latter half of the Cisuralian epoch by age dates from overlying and underlying formations. Important early terrestrial vertebrate fossils have been recovered from this formation in northern Arizona, southern Utah, and northern New Mexico. These include the iconic Permian terrestrial fauna: Seymouria, Diadectes, Ophiacodon, and Dimetrodon. The fossil assemblage present suggests arid environmental conditions. This is corroborated with paleoclimate data indicative of global drying throughout the early Permian.  Geographic extent  The Organ Rock Formation is present across southeastern Utah, U.S.A. It outcrops around Canyonlands National Park, Natural Bridges National Monument, and Monument Valley. In these areas the Organ Rock typically outcrops as a dark-red/brown siltstone to mudstone gently dipping towards the southeast. Within Canyonlands N.P. it forms towers which are meters to tens of meters tall. These are protected by caps of the White Rim Sandstone. In general, the Organ Rock Formation records the evolution of terminal fluvial fans, which dry up into sections of overlying formations. Animals living during the time of the Organ Rock's deposition had the capacity to travel across most of earth's landmass, as at the time, land was all concentrated into the supercontinent Pangea.  Stratigraphy and age  The Organ Rock Formation is conformably underlain by the Cedar Mesa Sandstone. It is conformably overlain by the De Chelly Sandstone around Monument Valley and by the White Rim Sandstone in the Canyonlands National Park. In locations where the De Chelly and White Rim are absent, the Organ Rock is unconformably overlain by the Triassic Moenkopi or Chinle Formations by an erosional contact. Toward its eastern extent, the Organ Rock Formation grades into the Cutler Formation, undivided. This transition occurs to the southwest of Moab, UT. The age of the Organ Rock Formation is unconfirmed. The preceding Cedar Mesa Sandstone is dated to the Wolfcampian (ICS stage: Artinskian). The anteceding De Chelly and White Rim Sandstones are dated to the Leonardian (ICS stage: Kungurian). These formations constrain the age of the Organ Rock Formation to the latter part of the Cisuralian Epoch, approximately 290.1 to 272.3 Ma. The Organ Rock Formation may contain the Artinskian/Kungurian boundary. This is during the early to mid-Permian, a time where synapsids and temnospondyl amphibians are the dominant players in terrestrial ecosystems. These animals predate the advent of archosaur reptiles which give rise to dinosaurs in the Triassic.  Depositional environments  The Organ Rock Formation is composed of sandstones, siltstones, conglomerates, and mudstones. These rocks occur in two primary facies: floodplain and channel, as well as eolian dunes and sand sheets. = Floodplain and channel = In these deposits, mixed reddish-brown sands and silts dominate with minor mudstones and conglomerates interspersed. Interpreted channel deposits grade from laterally accreting coarse sands - into conglomerates of pebble-sized carbonate clasts. Channels are 0.5 meter to 7 meters thick and may extend laterally for a few hundred meters. Fine-grained silt to mudstone deposits are proximal to interpreted channels. These deposits are interpreted as meandering streams with associated floodplains. = Eolian dune and sand sheet = Deposits are characterized by pale red fine- to medium-grained sandstones. These units are cross-bedded. Each cross-bed is composed of thin, consistently spaced laminations. These strata are interpreted as those made by migrating dunes. This facies is marked by a sharp contact at the top of the preceding floodplain and channel facies. Mud cracks found at the top of the facies are filled by fine-grained sand from the overlying dune facies. This facies is most common at the western extent of the Organ Rock Formation. Plant fossils Plant fossils include Supaia, Walchi and Yakia which lived in semi-arid conditions.  Vertebrate fossils  Fossil vertebrates represent the majority of the faunal assemblage present in the Organ Rock Formation.Vaughn, Peter P., 1973, Vertebrates from the Cutler Group of Monument Valley and vicinity in Monument Valley (Arizona, Utah and New Mexico), James, H.L.: New Mexico Geological Society 24th Annual Fall field Guidebook, 232 p.Sumida, Stuart S., Walliser, James B.D., and Lombard, B. Eric, 1999a, Late Paleozoic amphibian-grade tetrapods of Utah: Miscellaneous Publication- Utah Geological Survey, v. 99(1), p. 21 – 30.Sumida, Stuart S., Lombard, B. Eric, Berman, David S., Henrici, Amy C., 1999b, Late Paleozoic amniotes and their near relatives from Utah and northeastern Arizona, with comments on the Permian – Pennsylvanian boundary in Utah and northern Arizona: Miscellaneous Publication- Utah Geological Survey, v. 99(1), p. 21 – 30. Animal remains are most commonly preserved within ancient stream channels of the floodplain and channel facies. Within this facies, fossilized bone occurs proximal to conglomeratic lenses. Taxa recovered include: freshwater actinopterygian fishes, temnospondyl amphibians, diadectomorphs, seymouriamorphs, and early synapsids. = Freshwater Actinopterygian fishes = Fossil fish material, either bone or scale, is infrequent within the Organ Rock Formation. Scales from the extinct group of fishes Palaeoniscoidea are present. These scales, however, are only found preserved in fossilized feces (coprolites). Some coprolites are interpreted to be from fish; others from indeterminate terrestrial vertebrates. = Temnospondyls = Temnospondyl amphibian remains are present within the Organ Rock Formation. Three taxa have been reported. These include: Trimerorhachis, Eryops, and Zatrachys. Of these three taxa, fragments of Eryops are the most commonly recovered. Remains of this animal are very common in other formations of the Cutler Group and in general during the Early Permian of southwestern North America. = Diadectomorphs = Diadectomorphs are medium to large (2–3 meters), heavily- built reptiliomorphs with robust limbs. These animals are thought to be the closest outgroup to the clade Amniota. Two taxa are present within the Organ Rock Formation: Diadectes, and Tseajaia campi. Diadectes is more abundant in the Organ Rock than the other formations of the Cutler Group. Fragments of the animal are most commonly reported. The most complete two specimens include pectoral girdles and limbs. These were collected in San Juan County, Utah. Diadectes is an important animal as it is the first terrestrial vertebrate to demonstrate characteristics necessary for obligatory herbivory. These include: peg-shaped teeth in the front of the mouth, as well as broad blunt teeth used to more effectively process vegetation. Tseajaia campi is a very rare taxon known from one nearly complete specimen recovered from the Organ Rock. Originally described by Vaughn, this animal was first assigned to the group Seymouriamorpha, however, upon reassessment of the holotype it was demonstrated to have a closer affinity to Diadectomorpha.Sumida, Stuart S., Lombard, R. E., and Berman, D. S, 1992, Morphology of the atlas axis complex of the late Palaeozoic tetrapod suborders Diadectomorpha and Seymouriamorpha: Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, v. 336, p. 259-273. = Seymouriamorphs = Seymouriamorphs are small- to medium- sized (0.5 to 1.5 meters), reptiliomorphs. These animals have a generalized early amphibian body plan with a large “u”-shaped head and a sprawling lizard-like posture. The taxon Seymouria sanjuanensis is the only seymouriamorph found in the Organ Rock Formation. Seymouria sanjuanensis is a unique taxon because of its extensive geographic range. This particular animal was first described by Vaughn (1966) from the Organ Rock Formation. Since this initial find, a number of these individuals have been recovered from localities as distant as Germany.Benton, Michael J., 2015, Vertebrate Palaeontology: Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford, 4th edition. = Early Synapsids = Four early synapsid taxa are present within the Organ Rock Formation. These include Ophiacodon, as well as three sphenacodontids: Ctenospondylus, Dimetrodon, and Sphenacodon ferocior. Most taxa are known from fragmentary material. Early synapsids were dominant members of the terrestrial Permian ecosystem. Some early synapsids adapted an herbivorous diet, however, the Organ Rock Formation only preserves carnivorous animals; these were likely the apex predators of this ecosystem. The three sphenacodontids were terrestrial predators consuming other tetrapods, while Ophiacodon likely hunted fishes and other aquatic animals. = Coprolites = Coprolites associated with a labyrinthodont tooth as well as “Pelycosaur” and didectid remains have been recovered from this formation.  Paleoecological significance  The vertebrate faunal assemblage found in the Organ Rock Formation is diverse with respect to taxonomic groups, body plans, and diets. This material represents a decent cross-section of what terrestrial vertebrate life was like during the early Permian. It is noteworthy that no diapsid material has been definitively recovered from this formation. As one moves younger in time through the Organ Rock Formation, temnospondyls become less abundant with respect to other major groups such as diadectomorphs and early synapsids. This could track the general trend of aridification as indicated by sedimentology of the formation. This trend is globally recognized during the Early Permian, supported by many lines of geologic evidence including significant deposits of calcretes, eolianites, and evaporites.Tabor, Neil J., and Poulsen, Christopher J., 2008, Palaeoclimate across the Late Pennsylvanian _ early Permian tropical palaeolatitudes: A review of climate indicators, their distribution, and relation to palaeophysiographic climate factors: Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 268, p. 293 – 310.

History After the dissolution of the West India Company, a Council of the American Colonies and Possessions was established, which in 1806 was rescinded under King Louis Napoleon Bonaparte. Instead, the Ministry of Commerce and Colonies was established on 29 July 1806, headed by Paulus van der Heim. This ministry was transformed on 8 July 1808 into the Ministry of Marine and Colonies, again under Van der Heim. During the incorporation of the Netherlands at the First French Empire on 13 July 1810, the ministry continued as a separate division (Division Hollandaise) under the French Ministère de la Marine et des Colonies in Paris. After the French were defeated in 1813, a Department for the Business of Commerce and Colonies was established on April 6, 1814, headed by Godert van der Capellen, as \\"Secretary of State\\". He was succeeded on 29 July 1814 by Joan Cornelis van der Hoop. Subsequently, on 16 September 1815, the title of \\"Secretary of State\\" was replaced by that of \\"Director-General\\", Johannes Goldberg was the first to wear this title. Until 1842 the Colonies, with the exception of the period between January 1, 1834 and August 9, 1840, was united with other departments: successively as: *Commerce and Colonies (April 6, 1814 - March 18, 1818), *Education, National Industry and Colonies (March 19, 1818). 29 March 1824), *National Industry and Colonies (30 March 1824 - 4 April 1825), *Navy and Colonies (5 April 1825 - 31 December 1829), *Waterstaat, National Industry and Colonies (1 January 1830 - 30 September 1831), *National Industry and Colonies (1 October 1831 - 31 December 1834), *Colonies (independent ministry, 1 January 1834 - 9 August 1840), *Navy and Colonies (10 August 1840 - 31 December 1841). After 1 January 1842 Colonies became an independent ministry. On 23 February 1945 the name was changed to the Ministry of Overseas Territories. In 1951 the name was changed to the Ministry for Union Affairs and Overseas Departments, followed by the Ministry of Overseas Territories in 1953. in 1957 the name was changed again, now in the Ministry of Overseas Affairs. From ministry to cabinet Because of the decolonization, the ministry ceased to exist as an independent department in 1959. It became a separate \\"cabinet\\" (department), first under the Vice Prime Minister (1959-1971), later as: *Cabinet for Surinamese and Dutch Antillean Affairs (1971-1975), *Cabinet for Dutch Antillean Affairs (1975 - 1985, Suriname disappeared). after its independence in 1975) and *Cabinet for Dutch Antillean and Aruban Affairs (1985-1998, Aruba obtained status as of 1 January 1986) among various ministers who joined the policy area next to their \\"head ministry\\". In 1998, this government was included in the new Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations. Colonial army The ministry had its own armed forces. From 1816 the Dutch East Indies Army (from 1836 Royal Netherlands East Indies Army, KNIL) fell under the Ministry of Colonies. Also the Force in Suriname (TRIS) and its predecessors fell from 1868 to 1957 under the ministry or its successors. The KNIL was dissolved in Indonesia during the sovereignty transfer to Indonesia in July 1950. The TRIS, which from 1957 was part of the Royal Netherlands Army, was abolished after the transfer of sovereignty to Suriname in 1975. Housing From 1829 the ministry was located in the Huygenshuis. In 1860 an own ministerial building was built in The Hague, the first ministerial building that was designed as such. During the Second World War, the ministry was based in London from 1940 to 1945. From 1959, the cabinet was located at Plein 1813.  References  * Herman Daniël Benjamins en Joh. F. Snelleman (red.) Encyclopaedie van Nederlandsch West- Indië Martinus Nijhoff/E.J.

Under increasing scrutiny by Nazi sympathizers, she was forced to go into hiding in February 1943 for personal safety reasons, but resumed her rescue and resistance work within weeks, deeming the lives of the children she was helping as important as, or more important than her own. Arrested in June 1943 for her rescue work as a member of the Utrechts Kindercomité (Utrecht Children’s Committee or UKC), she was incarcerated, and moved from one jail to another until being transferred to the detention camp at Herzogenbusch in Vught. She was then later deported to the Ravensbrück concentration camp in Germany. Surviving until the camp was liberated, she returned home to the Netherlands, married, had children, and became active in animal rescue.Voûte, Henriëtte and Voute Family, Righteous Among the Nations, Yad Vashem.Henriette (Hetty) Voute and Gisela Wieberdink-Soehnlein, Featured Stories, Yad Vashem. Formative years Born on June 12, 1918 in Utrecht, in the Netherlands, Henriëtte (Hetty) Voûte was the youngest of seven children of Pauline Hermine Elisabeth (Pierson) Voûte (1881–1965) and Paul Antoine Voûte, Jr. (1877–1946), a native of the village of Glowaczow in Poland who had emigrated from Warsaw aboard the M.S. Batory, and had become a factory director in Utrecht.\\"Voûte, Henriette (1918–1999).\\" Amsterdam, Netherlands: Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands, retrieved online April 23, 2018.Klempner, Mark.

Her siblings were: Jan Lodewijk Voûte (1904–1962), who was also known as “Lodie”; Paul Antoine Voûte (1906–1971); Jan Reinier Voûte (1908–1993); Allard Voûte (1910–1974); Nicolaas Gerard Voûte (1913–1998); and Pauline Hermine Elisabeth Voûte (1916–1979). After completing her studies at the Stedelijk Gymnasium, she enrolled as a biology major in 1937 at Utrecht University, a state- sponsored academic institution in the Netherlands.Voûte, Henriette, Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands. It was during this period of her life that she and her family began to hear stories regarding the increase of Antisemitism in Germany. These stories were confirmed by her brother in 1938. An employee of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines who was in Germany for a work assignment in November of that year, he had been an eyewitness to the violence perpetrated against Jewish people by supporters of Adolf Hitler as part of Kristallnacht, a pogrom which took place from November 9–10, during which the Sturmabteilung (the German paramilitary force known more commonly as the \\"SA\\") destroyed synagogues and Jewish-owned stores and other buildings, murdered more than 90 Jewish people, and deported 30,000 Jewish men to Nazi concentration camps. That same year, Hetty Voûte became a member of the Red Cross.Klempner, The Heart Has Reasons.Voûte, Henriette, Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands. Occupation of the Netherlands and World War II Close to her family, Hetty Voûte opted to live at home while studying biology at Utrecht University since the academic institution was located not far from her parents' house on Kromme Nieuwe Gracht. Her ordered world was upended in 1940, however, when Germany invaded the Netherlands on May 10 and when her nation surrendered after five days of brutal fighting:Klempner, The Heart Has Reasons.Voûte, Henriëtte and Voute Family, Righteous Among the Nations, Yad Vashem. > At the beginning the Germans were very civil.... They behaved courteously > and correctly, and many people thought they were not so bad. Early on, > Seyss-Inquart issued a statement that he would respect the laws of the Dutch > people as much as possible. That’s why two of my brothers started an > underground newspaper. They wrote things like, “Don’t be fooled by them – > they say they are here to liberate us, but they are stealing everything out > of our shops.” Whenever I saw my brothers, their fingers were always black > from assembling the news. I learned from those articles what the Nazis were > up to, and I decided to throw “the stubborn ounces of my weight” against > them.... Her brothers' publication, Bulletin, was in fact the first Dutch Resistance newspaper, according to Yad Vashem. Consequently, Hetty Voûte's first act of resistance was to serve as a courier for her brothers; she delivered their publication to members of the community who were passionate about regaining control of their government.Klempner, The Heart Has Reasons.Voûte, Henriëtte and Voute Family, Righteous Among the Nations, Yad Vashem. By the fall of 1940, she and a classmate, Olga Hudig, had relocated to the village of Noordwijk in South Holland in order to conduct research as part of the requirements for a university class in marine biology. While obtaining the requisite permission from a local government official to conduct her research (because beach access was restricted by Nazi authorities at this time), she noticed \\"a very nice map showing the locations of all the anti-aircraft guns on that strip of land,\\" and realized that she could help by alerting members of a local Dutch Resistance cell to the map's contents and location:Klempner, The Heart Has Reasons. > I’d take a good look at that map, and then report what I had seen to a boy I > knew who had a secret radio transmitter. He would then send the information > to British intelligence. During this time, she and Hudig also helped identify families in and around Noordwijk, who were willing to hide and protect Jewish children from persecution by Nazi officials; they then also began to transport children sent to them by the resistance cell operated by Joop Westerweel.Voûte, Henriëtte and Voute Family, Righteous Among the Nations, Yad Vashem. In response to the persecution and deportation of Jewish men and women from the Netherlands (including the July 1942 mass deportation from Amsterdam to the Auschwitz and Sobibor) concentration camps, she then joined the Utrechts Kindercomité (Utrecht Children’s Committee or UKC), and became involved with child rescue on a significantly larger scale:Klempner, The Heart Has Reasons.Voûte, Henriëtte and Voute Family, Righteous Among the Nations, Yad Vashem. > The Nazis sealed off a whole block and went running through with their > rifles and Doberman dogs shouting, “All Jews out!” We heard how they broke > down doors, barged into houses....

By the end of > August our group had found hiding places for 140 children. According to Yad Vashem, just prior to beginning the massive July 1942 action in Amsterdam, Nazi authorities and their Dutch collaborators had designated the Hollandse Schouwberg, a Jewish Theater there, as the main holding area for the targeted families. As the round up progressed, children were separated from their parents and moved across the street to \\"the Crèche – what had been a day care center for the children of mostly Jewish working mothers.\\" The parents were then taken to the Nazi transit camp at Westerbork, and held there until transported by cattle car to a death camp. As soon as they were safely able to make their way into the Crèche, Hetty Voûte and Gisela Wieberdink- Soehnlein, a Utrech University law student, began a series of rescue visits, during which they hid at-risk children in laundry bags, milk cans and potato sacks, smuggled them out of the building, and transported them to UKC support families. Between 1942 and 1943, Voûte and Wieberdink-Soehnlein collaborated with Henriette Pimentel, headmistress of the Crèche, Dr. Johan Van Hulst, director of a nearby teachers’ seminary, and Walter Süskind, and to save 1,000 of the roughly 4,000 at-risk children.Henriette (Hetty) Voute and Gisela Wieberdink-Soehnlein, Featured Stories, Yad Vashem.Echoes of Heroism, The Times of Israel.Paldiel, Mordecai. The Path of the Righteous: Gentile Rescuers of Jews During the Holocaust. Brooklyn, New York: KTAV Publishing House, Inc., 1993, pp. 116–121. Her brother, Paul Voûte, M.D., a respected physician, also assisted her with her child rescue efforts during this time.\\"Voûte, Paul Antoine and Voûte-Waller, Margaret Quien,\\" in \\"The Righteous Among the Nations.\\" Jerusalem, Israel: Yad Vashem. By the summer of 1942, Hetty Voûte was also actively engaged in procuring ration cards for the increasing number of Jewish children being sheltered through the UKC's support network. Among her suppliers was Menachem Pinkhof, one of the Jewish members of the Westerweel group. She then also began traveling throughout the Netherlands to secure additional cards, and built a secure supply network by convincing officials at 12 distribution centers to authorize the issuance of ration cards in conjunction with each UKC child's registration papers. By November 1942, she was in charge of the UKC’s administration, and was responsible for safeguarding the codebook which documented the names and addresses of the Jewish children being hidden by the UKC. She also escorted children to their respective safehouses and, when no hiding places were available, found temporary shelters for children in need.Voûte, Henriëtte and Voute Family, Righteous Among the Nations, Yad Vashem. Also participating in this network was Willemiena Bouwman (known as Mien van Trouw), and Bouwman's love interest, Willem Pieter (“Wim”) Speelman, one of the organizers of Trouw (“True” or “Allegiance”), an orthodox Protestant underground newspaper which was published illegally in violation of Nazi laws prohibiting the free operation of independent press outlets“Mien van Trouw overladen” (“Mien van Trouw died”). Amsterdam, Netherlands: Trouw, March 5, 2007. As awareness built of her rescue work, Hetty Voûte came under increasing scrutiny by Dutch and Nazi officials. After nearly being arrested in February 1943, she was forced to temporarily halt her activities and go into hiding, staying with Adrie Knappert in Ommen, Overijsselimmediate for several weeks until the immediate danger passed. During the summer of 1943, her luck finally ran out. When she went to the Utrecht train station to retrieve her bicycle on the evening of June 12, she was arrested there by the Geheime Staatspolizei (the Nazi Secret State Police unit known more commonly as the Gestapo), and sent to jail. Her friend and fellow UKC collaborator, Gisela Wieberdink-Soehnlein, was then also arrested and jailed the next day.Klempner, The Heart Has Reasons.Voûte, Henriëtte and Voute Family, Righteous Among the Nations, Yad Vashem. =Imprisonment at Herzogenbusch and Ravensbrück= Following their arrest for their work with the Utrechts Kindercomité, Hetty Voûte and Gisela Wieberdink- Soehnlein were incarcerated, and then moved from one jail to another until being transferred to the Herzogenbusch concentration camp at Vught.Klempner, The Heart Has Reasons.Voûte, Henriëtte and Voute Family, Righteous Among the Nations, Yad Vashem. > At the camp in Vught, the Germans made us work in a big tire factory in Den > Bosch that they had converted to manufacture gas masks.

During this time, they were also interrogated by the Gestapo, but Voûte never divulged the names of her collaborators or other details of their rescue operation. According to a later interview:Klempner, The Heart Has Reasons. > The interrogations were terrible. At times, out of decency, they removed my > eyeglasses before slapping me across the face.

Transferred next to Haaren to a Catholic seminary that had been converted into a prison by Nazi officials, they were both subsequently deported to Germany as Allied troops advanced through the Netherlands. Sent to the train station near Ravensbrück, and marched from there to the concentration camp, but were not permitted to enter due to severe overcrowding.Klempner, The Heart Has Reasons. The \\"largest concentration camp for women in the German Reich,\\" according to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Ravensbrück was located roughly 50 miles north of Berlin, and was \\"second in size only to the women's camp in Auschwitz-Birkenau.\\"Ravensbrück, in Holocaust Encyclopedia.

Forced to \\"sit on a pile of coal for two days and two nights in the rain,\\" said Voûte, they realized once they were finally allowed in that their living conditions would be abysmal. Required to stand for hours during the morning and evening \\"Appell\\" as prisoners names were checked against camp rosters, they were often beaten during those reviews. Assigned to a work detail at the Siemens factory, they were given only \\"watery soup with some cabbage in it\\" for lunch, \\"and for dinner, more soup and a piece of hard bread.\\" At night, they slept on \\"hard mattresses filled with a little fetid straw\\" in dirty, lice-infested barracks. The conditions then deteriorated further. By 1945, as awareness dawned that Germany would lose the war, the guards stopped feeding the surviving prisoners, and ramped up their mass extermination efforts Klempner, The Heart Has Reasons. Following negotiations by Swedish diplomat Folke Bernadotte, Hetty Voûte, Gisela Wieberdink-Soehnlein, and other inmates were finally freed from Ravensbrück on April 28, 1945. Given fresh bread and lentil soup by representatives from the International Red Cross, they were also given medical care before being transported by van, train and ferry to Malmö. Initially not permitted to return to the Netherlands due to a severe food shortage there and because she still had not yet fully recovered from the effects of her concentration camp imprisonment, she was hospitalized at Landskrona before being transferred to Lidingö, a sanatorium near Stockholm when physicians discovered she had contracted tuberculosis. She was finally permitted to return home in April 1946.Voûte, Henriette, Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands.Klempner, The Heart Has Reasons. Post-war life On December 16, 1946, Hetty Voûte began a new life when she wed Christian Elie Dutilh (1923–1989) in Utrecht. Following their marriage, the couple relocated to the Dutch East Indies, where they greeted the arrival of two sons and two daughters. When Hetty contracted tuberculosis again in 1953, the family returned to the Netherlands, making their home in Amsterdam's Prinses Marijkestraat. She and her husband divorced in 1972. Hetty Voûte then became a biology teacher at the Huishoudschool in Amsterdam, a position she held for eight years.Klempner, The Heart Has Reasons.Voûte, Henriette, Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands.

Hungerford (1927–1993) was an American cancer researcher and co- discoverer of the Philadelphia chromosome. This discovery was the first association between a genetic abnormality and a type of cancer, and it changed the direction of cancer research and paved the way for the development of targeted cancer therapies. Education and early career David A. Hungerford was born in Brockton, Massachusetts in 1927. He received his bachelor's degree from Temple University in Philadelphia, and earned a PhD in zoology from the University of Pennsylvania. In 1959, while working as a junior research fellow at the Institute for Cancer Research in Philadelphia (the precursor to Fox Chase Cancer Center), Hungerford and Peter Nowell, a pathologist at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, discovered what became known as the Philadelphia chromosome. After earning his PhD in 1961, he spent more than two decades as a researcher at Fox Chase, retiring in 1982 due to the effects of multiple sclerosis. Hungerford died on November 3, 1993, of lung cancer, at home in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania. His widow, Alice Hungerford, was also a longtime Fox Chase Cancer Center employee. She maintains his legacy and the family's connection with Fox Chase via the David A. Hungerford Endowed Fund in Basic Chromosome Research. Every September she used to host an event to raise money for the endowment. The microscope Hungerford was using when he made his discovery is on permanent public display at Fox Chase. Discovery of the Philadelphia chromosome At the time of discovery Hungerford was pursuing his PhD, and was studying leukemia cells for a dissertation on human chromosomes. He detected a tiny abnormality in the chromosomes from cultured blood cells taken from two patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). This abnormality would turn out to be the first consistent genetic irregularity associated with cancer in humans. Part of chromosome 22, and thus some of the genetic code it carried, appeared to be missing. Hungerford and Nowell postulated that a cell was not viable with the loss of that much genetic material. They believed that it was possibly a translocation, meaning the missing piece was attached in a different spot on the chromosome, but they couldn't prove it using the techniques available at the time. In the early 1970s Janet Rowley confirmed that it was a translocation. The discovery was called the Philadelphia chromosome after the city in which the researchers' respective institutions were located. They presented their findings in the Journal of National Cancer Institute in 1960. At the time, techniques for preparing chromosomes for microscopic study were still crude, and researchers had found no abnormal chromosomes in cells from patients with CML. Further studies verified the findings. Other scientific contributions Prior to the introduction of banding techniques on somatic metaphase chromosomes, David began investigating chromosomes at the pachytene stage in the development of sperm. Each chromosome has a specific, innate banding pattern (later shown to correlate to the banding pattern of somatic metaphase chromosomes), and in 1970 he described how the trisomy mutation associated with Down syndrome developed in meiosis. At the time of his retirement due to illness in 1982, David had mapped almost half of the normal human complement of chromosomes at pachytene.

It was opened on 22 July 2018. Prior to March 2012, this station was known as the Ceintuurbaan. De Pijp is an underground station situated in the Oude Pijp neighbourhood of the borough of Amsterdam-Zuid (Amsterdam South). The station is expected to handle around 18,000 passengers and arrivals per day. History The station, designed by Benthem Crouwel Architects, is situated beneath the Ferdinand Bolstraat in the De Pijp neighbourhood. Because of the narrow constraints of the site location, between the foundations of adjoining buildings, the station has two levels, with a platform on each level. Each platform is 125 metres long and 5.3 metres wide (3 meters at its narrowest points). There are ten escalators (five per platform) as well as lifts to the mezzanine level. The lower level platform with southbound services to Zuid is 26.5 meters below street level, while the upper level platform with northbound services to Noord is 16.5 meters below street level. This makes De Pijp station the deepest station on the Noord/Zuidlijn and the deepest metro station in the Netherlands. In May 2013, a municipal advisory committee selected artwork by Argentinian artist Amalia Pica for this station. It is a multicolored painting that will run the entire span of the wall of the mezzanine level. The station has two entrances, one at Albert Cuypstraat and Ferdinand Bolstraat and one at Ceintuurbaan and Ferdinand Bolstraat. The existing corner buildings at each station entrance location had been demolished. The first designs for the new residential buildings were presented in April 2014.

History The Johnnie Mine, located about 4 miles northeast of Johnnie, was established in 1890 when a group of five prospectors were exploring the area in search of the Lost Breyfogle mine. The Johnnie Mine produced between $382,681 and over a million dollars by 1913. Outcrops of gold were discovered in the nearby Spring Mountains, and the discovery led to a rush of miners to the area. The community was named after Indian Johnnie, an acquaintance of early prospectors. By May 1891, a hundred people were in the camp. Houses, stores and saloons were built. One source states that a post office was established later that year. Another source states that the post office was named Johny Post Office from June 1898 until April 1899. Availability of water was a problem for the bustling camp. Water was retrieved from a spring four miles away, packed in canvas bags and hauled back to town by donkeys. The camp started to decline after 1893. The settlement revived in 1898 when new investors bought the two largest mines in the district, the Johnnie and the Congress mines. After 1904, Johnnie was swept up in the rush to the area near Goldfield and Bullfrog. A post office was reopened in May 1905 and a new town site was established closer to the mines. In 1907, the town had a population of 300. The Johnnie Mine and mill continued production until 1914. The Johnnie Post Office closed in December 1914, reopening in April 1916 and closing again in November 1935. Placer gold was found in gulches every few years and the area was worked off and on for the next thirty years. The Johnny settlement had less than 10 people by the late 1930s. The Johnnie Post Office was closed in 1935. The Johnnie Mine Post Office operated from September 1937 until June 1942. In 2014, ownership of the abandoned April Fool, Johnnie, Teddys and the Teddys Terror were transferred to the Pahrump Valley Museum and Historical Society.

The Archives functions currently as the subdivision of the Estonian Literary Museum but it was established in 1927 as the division of the Estonian National Museum. The current Head of the Archives is Dr. .  History  Established in 1928, the Estonian Folklore Archives was made the central folklore archive and research institution of Estonia. Located in Tartu, the main purpose of the archives was to bring together all the previous existing collections to facilitate research, to start research in a broad scope and to organize fieldwork in Estonia. = Foundation and early years = The original collections of the archives were based on manuscript reports and accounts of Estonian folklore gathered together by Estonian folklore collector Jakob Hurt (1839–1907). Estonian folklore had been previously collected by Baltic Germans, as a literary hobby or amateur linguistic activity. Jakob Hurt brought together different initiatives and encouraged people in Estonia to collect folklore. Collecting their own folklore and creating their own history through folklore collections supported the national awakening. Work of Jakob Hurt resulted in a manuscript collection of 114 696 pages containing songs, proverbs, riddles, legends, folk tales and other folklore materials from various regions of Estonia, sent by more than 1400 collectors. Hurt systematized manuscripts and arranged the collected material into volumes by format and place of collection. After the death of Hurt his collection was transferred to the repository of the Finnish Literature Society in Helsinki as by that time there was no appropriate preservation condition in Estonia for such a material. Finnish folklorist Kaarle Krohn (1863–1933) was the initiator of the move. Discussions about the return of J. Hurt's collections were started in 1924 with an idea of founding folklore archives in Estonia. Estonian folklorist Oskar Loorits (1900–1961) was one of the scholars standing behind this idea. Estonian archive was based on the example of the Finnish Literature Society and inspired by the Archives of Latvian Folklore which was founded in 1924 as the first of its kind in the region. On September 24, 1927, the Estonian Folklore Archives was formed as an independent subdivision of the Estonian National Museum, and it was headed by Oskar Loorits. The archivists concentrated on the processing of previously collected materials, making them available for research, and started to collect folklore and compile publications. Collections of the Archives grew considerably during the 13 years before the Soviet occupation. In addition to the manuscripts, the collections of sound recordings and photographs were established. The geographic distribution of the collected folklore materials was taken into consideration – the aim was to complement previous collection work. Archives begun to document the folklore of minority groups in Estonia as well as kindred Finno-Ugric peoples, broadening the area of the collections. = Second World War = In 1940 the Estonian Folklore Archives were reorganized into the Department of Folklore of the State Literary Museum. During the Nazi German occupation (1941–1944) reorganization happened again. The Folklore Department with its collections became part of the University of Tartu, and the State Literary Museum ceased to exist. Oskar Loorits was removed from the position of the director of the Archives. In 1943 in order to save collections from destruction, they were evacuated to different places all over Estonia. The Soviet Union occupied again Estonia in 1944 thus the Folklore Department belonged once again to the State Literary Museum, and collections were brought back to their former depositories. The revisions and censorships of the collections were superficial during the first part of the Soviet occupation (1940-1941), but this changed during the period that followed after 1945, when the Soviet repressions became evident. = Period of Soviet occupation = In the year 1944 Estonia was deliberated from Nazis by Soviet Army. However, in reality it was only about replacing one occupier by another. Soviets incorporated Estonia into Soviet Union and established Estonian SSR which remained until the collapse of USSR in 1991. Soviet occupation influenced all levels of political, social and cultural life in the country. The Estonian Folklore Archives – renamed at that period as the Folklore Department of the State Literary Museum – were not exception. Under the rule of Soviet ideology some significant changes took place. The approach towards folklore, the dynamics of collecting and archival practices where adjusted to fit the Soviet ideology. In addition, some of the archivists were repressed in the end of the 1940s. The Soviet approach towards folklore and national identities was in some way contradictory; on the one hand it repressed nationalism but on the other hand it supported significantly national cultures of particular Soviet Socialist Republic claiming the right for national and cultural autonomy of every republic. It was for example visibly seen in increasing numbers of various folklore ensembles, in borrowing folk motives in official art and state propaganda, in maintaining folk traditions etc. Together with that the study of folklore was supported however only in ways which fitted the regime. Generally speaking emphasize was placed on working class and lower social strata while topics like religion and beliefs were omitted. During the Stalinist era, the concept of Soviet folklore was exalted. Instead of depicting the Finnic, Scandinavian, Germanic or Baltic influences, the impact of Russian tradition was emphazised. Praise to the new social order and Soviet leaders was made, while the figures of bourgeois Estonians and German landlords were allowed to be satirized. Themes that reinforced Soviet rhetoric, such as heroic epics, were promoted consolidating a one-sided construction of history. Themes such as the struggle of social class depicted from the perspective of the working masses or life in collective farms were imposed as a reference to the modern thinking that promulgated the regime. Together with the new regime the deep re-evaluating of collections occurred. For example, Jakob Hurt was proclaimed a bourgeois researcher and the founder of archives Oskar Loorits was regarded as worthless and his name was erased from indexes and he was rarely mentioned in any new scholar works and publications. All of the existing collections were censored between 1945 and 1952, and the manuscript volumes were checked page by page. The methods of censorship included cut-outs, black ink, glue and ripping pages out from the volumes. Most of this work was carried out by folklorists themselves and censoring was part of the working plans of the staff of the Folklore Department. Some volumes were controlled by people from the Central State Archives and there, censorship had been stricter. Most of the censored materials consisted of songs and jokes of the genres that reflected the contemporary society most clearly. During the 1940s and 1950s anti-Soviet folklore that was hostile or ironic towards Soviet ideas was cut out or covered by ink. Similarly obscene folklore as blue jokes, raunchy songs, riddles or sayings was censored. Also the principles of copying and indexing were affected by dominant state ideology. For example, above mentioned Oskar Loorits, was erased from indexes and thus finding his materials was very complicated. New and detailed indexes were made about topics such as class struggles and historical events such as Great Patriotic war while other topics (for example Estonian Republic) were omitted. This indexing significantly hindered the possibility to find in the archives anything out of official stream.Kulasalu, Kaisa (2017). From Estonian Folklore Archives to Folklore Department of the State Literary Museum: sovietization of folkloristics in late Stalinist Estonia. In: Laime, Sandis; Bula, Dace (Ed.). Mapping the History of Folklore Studies: Centers, Borderlands and Shared Spaces. Newcastle upon Tyne: Cambridge Scholars Publishing, pp. 132−153. In the 1960s, after the so-called period of ‘Khrushchev's Thaw’, separated pages and documents of the Stalinist period were returned to the Folklore Department. Since the local KGB officers systematically monitored the content of the collections until the late 1980s, the material was kept in separate boxes to avoid complications. During the Soviet period collective field trips of 10 to 15 professional folklorists were introduced. Up to the 1990s, expeditions to rural areas were of main interest and focus was mostly on archaic folklore. However, step by step folklorists returned to contemporary matters. During the last decade of the Soviet period childlore became a new research topic and a special collection RKM, KP. was created. By the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the interest in the origins and roots increased as well as the topic of folk beliefs became popular. The folklore archives recovered its old name. = Present days = After Estonian re-independence and institutional reorganization of the Estonian Folklore Archives in 1995, collections of the Department of Literature and Folklore at the University of Tartu and the Tallinn Institute of Language and Literature of the Estonian Academy of Sciences were incorporated into the Estonian Folklore Archives. Thus, by the year 2000, all of the larger folklore collections formerly held by different institutions had been concentrated within the Folklore Archives. Today, the archived material is primarily intended for researchers and students in the field of folklore studies. The archives’ employees offer assistance and consultations to ethnologists, cultural anthropologists, and researchers of other disciplines in Estonia and elsewhere in the world. In addition to such researchers, the target user group of the archives could consist more generally of everyone interested in Estonian folklore. The research results of the archive's workers are published as articles and monographs, academic source publications are produced as well. In 2000 the Publication of the series Proceedings of the Estonian Folklore Archives (Eesti Rahvaluule Arhiivi Toimetused) was restored after the long break during the Soviet regime. The Archives is also responsible for preparing and publishing the collections of runic songs (such as Vana Kannel [“Old Harp”]) by parishes of Estonia and academic anthologies of folk tales in the edited series Monumenta Estoniae Antiquae. Along with digital technologies's development in the 1990s the digital means helped in keeping of various registers, and in working with texts. Various digital registers and databases were created, the digitization projects were initiated and digital materials started increase in numbers. At the same time the formation of analogue registers and cardfiles ceased one by one. However, at the beginning of the 2000s somewhat chaotic situation had arisen – it was easier to work with computers, but there was no coherent system to manage and access the data in the archives. The new, digital consolidation of the archival system was developed by the archives' team, bringing the functionality of registers and cardfiles into an archival information system. Later the idea of digital repository in order to store the voluminous digital collections was realized with the financial help of the Estonian Information System Authority (2010–2012). Emerged digital archive consisted of the repository module and the archival information module – for folklore archives as well as for the neighbouring archives in the Estonian Literary Museum. One of the outcomes of digital development was emergence of the Estonian Literary Museum's file repository called Kivike. =The Folklore Archives directors= * Oskar Loorits 1940-1942 * Gustav Ränk 1942-1944 * 1944-1945 * Hilda Nõu 1950-1952 * 1952-1966 * 1966-1977 * 1977-1988 * Urmas Oras 1988-1990 * 1990-1991 * 1991-1998 * Ergo-Hart Västrik 1999-2008 * 2009-  Collections  Collections of the Estonian Folklore Archives consist of sub-archives of manuscripts, photographs, sound recordings, films and videos, as well as of multimedia content. = Manuscripts = The EFA contains 31 collections of manuscripts, which is overall up to 1.5 million pages. The most essential period of collecting folklore in manuscript format is related to the activities of Jakob Hurt (1838–1907) and Matthias Johann Eisen (1880–1934). J. Hurt started to collect folklore in the 1860s, his collection finally reaching 162 volumes of manuscripts, now one of the most priceless parts of the EFA (all 114,696 manuscript pages of this collection are available as scans through the digital file repository of the Estonian Literary Museum http://kivike.kirmus.ee/). Moreover, Oskar Kallas (1868–1946) also played an important role in collecting Estonian folklore. He organised the campaign of collecting Estonian folk melodies in a systematic and scientific way between 1904 and 1916 in association with the Estonian Students’ Society. This collection contains a total of 13,139 folk songs together with their melodies. Each manuscript collection's name is provided with an abbreviation in accordance with the person's name who gathered it. For instance, E refers to the collection of M. J. Eisen, and H indicates the manuscript collection of J. Hurt. Some of the collections are also divided into series named after format of the manuscript, such as H I, H II, and H III according to the size of the manuscript pages. Since 2000 also digitised manuscripts have been archived. = Photographs = Among the sub-archives of the EFA there is a large collection of photographs. This was one of the EFA's earliest collections. The earliest photographs are glass plate negatives; these, however, went out of use in the first half of the twentieth century. Altogether in 2016 the collection included 17,993 black-and-white photographs, 8,075 colour photographs and 33,137 digital photographs which is the fastest growing type of photographs in the archives since then. Partly the photograph collections have been digitalised and made available at the digital file repository of the Estonian Literary Museum http://kivike.kirmus.ee/. The photograph collection also contains photographs depicting material and landscapes related to folk tradition. In the beginning of the 2000s the process of digitalization of analogous collections had been undertaken with all the collections, including the digitalization of photographs. The copies were prepared and preserved so that these would serve as security copies of analogous materials. = Sound recordings = The collection includes material on phonograph records, audio tapes, and cassettes. The first recordings, which were on wax cylinders, were made between 1912 and 1914 by the Finnish folklorist A. O. Väisänen (1890–1969). The main data carriers are DATs and Mini discs which have been used since 1995 and memory cards since the beginning of 2000. From 1992 Jaan Tamm – a sound engineer in the Estonian Folklore Archives – worked on digitalizing the earlier tape recordings. Older collections of sound recordings contain recordings of instrumental music performed on older instruments. In the 20th century, sound recordings mostly contain folksongs in newer styles. In the era of digitalization, the sound recordings were digitized in order to preserve them. = Films and videos = There are 1,377 items in the film and video collection, comprising film strips, videotapes from the 1980s, digital material on Mini DV and memory cards. These data carriers reflect the traditions of Estonians and other ethnic groups. For instance, the video collection consists of recordings of music performances taken both in authentic performance situations and at folk music festivals. Together this collection has 6 series. For example, analogue video recordings, digital tapes, digitally born recordings as files, etc. = Multimedia = In 2008 the multimedia collection was established. This includes digital material such as emails and Powerpoint presentations that do not fit into any of the other categories.  Collections of ethnic minorities  In the 19th century folklore collecting of ethnic minorities – non-Estonian Finno-Ugric peoples, Baltic Germans, Russians, Swedes, Jews, Romani people – was rather scant because of lack of interest and linguistic competence of the collectors who were mostly amateurs. The situation with Finno-Ugric folklore was approximately the same in that period as the feeling of kinship encompassed mostly with Finns. The situation changed in independent Estonia. In EFA, there appeared separate series of national minority collection (such as ERA, Vene – Russian collection; ERA, Saksa – Baltic German collection; ERA, Rootsi – Estonian Swedish collection, etc.). Folklorists of that time made systematic and thorough collection of ethnic minorities. Before the Second World War, Estonians accounted for 90% of population. Still Russians, Swedes, Baltic- Germans and Jews were granted for cultural autonomy. Besides, here lived Ingrian Finns, Izhorians, Latvians, Tartars, Romani people and others. During the Second World War, folklore collecting stopped. After the war the work started again (under Soviet Government) but it differed compared to the prewar period. Germans and Swedes mostly had fled from the country. The Jews and Romani people were nearly all murdered during the German occupation. Russian minority changed its structure. At the same time there appeared Belarusian and Polish folklore collections. After re-establishing independence in Estonia work on minority collections continued. = Non-Estonian Finno-Ugric collections = The Finno-Ugrian linguistic relatives of the Estonians were initially documented by Finnish researchers who were further along in folklore collecting. This may be surprising considering the relatively easy access Estonia had to eastern Finno-Ugrians as part of the Russian Empire. This lack of documentation by Estonian scholars was due to insufficient academic preparation and the high cost of fieldwork particularly among the more distant Finno-Ugric peoples. Exception in this respect was activities of Mihkel Veske, lecturer of Finno-Ugric languages at Kazan University, who conducted research on Mari and Mordvin languages in the years following 1886. However, although he amassed an extensive collection of Estonian folklore, which is housed at the Estonian Folklore Archives (EFA), Veske did not expand his scope to include the folklore of Finno-Ugrians of the Volga region in Kazan. Ersa- Mordvinian Tatiana Danilova with her grandchildren – Viktor Danilov (1974) During the Soviet period a separate series RKM, Soome-ugri was established for the materials of Finno-Ugric peoples. This series is made up of six volumes of around 3000 pages containing materials collected from the variety of Finno- Ugric peoples. In the sound collections of the EFA one can find also a considerable number of tape recordings of Mordvin folklore, made by Mikhail Tshuvashov and Viktor Danilov. Old Setu collection, 1932 Krakovjak Seto, 1936 f315 = Baltic Finnic folklore = The collecting campaign launched by Jakob Hurt including field research in Seto region was recognized by the Russian Geographical Society which subsidized his expeditions. In the 1920s and 1930s minor collection series ERA, Ingeri was initiated for the folklore of Ingrian Finns and Izhorians. The series for the folklore of Votians ERA, Vadja was initiated by Paul Ariste. Baltic Finnic is also presented by Finns (ERA, Soomi) and Livs. The Livonian collection (ERA, LF) has a fate on its own. Livonian materials were collected as a result of interest of Oskar Loorits. This large collection covers all folklore genres, but it represents folk beliefs at its best and includes linguistic (mostly lexical) data. When Loorits fled from Tartu to Sweden in 1944, he took Livonian collection with him. After his death, materials ended in Finnish Literary Society in Helsinki, exactly as it happened to Jakob Hurt's archive half a century before, and just as in case of Hurt, Loorits' materials returned to Estonia a while after the restoration of Republic's independence, in 1998. = Russian folklore collection = The biggest Russian folklore collection of the pre-WW2 period in the Estonian Folklore Archives is labeled as ERA, Vene.Västrik, Ergo-Hart (2007). Archiving Tradition in a Changing Political Order: From Nationalism to Pan-Finno-Ugrianism in the Estonian Folklore Archives. In: Culture Archives and the State: Between Nationalism, Socialism, and the Global Market.(Working Papers of the Center for Folklore Studies, 1.) Columbus, OH: The Ohio State University, pp. 1–25. http://hdl.handle.net/1811/46903 The head of Estonian Folklore Archives Dr. Oskar Loorits stated that Russian collection would provide important materials to do comparative studies with Estonian folklore. ERA, Vene collection has 10,656 pages which is divided into 17 volumes. Most of the materials were collected from the north-eastern and south-eastern part of Estonia. This collection was contributed as a part of voluntary work. Estonian volunteers were from the educational field while the Russian volunteers were from the intellectual background. The scholar students collected folklore from the Petseri district, and also regions by the river Narva and Lake Peipsi. To organise the collected materials, it was divided according to the language. In some cases, this classification occurred according to the ethnic identity. Professor, academician, and employee of the Estonian Folklore Archives Paul Ariste also contributed by collecting folklore materials of the Old Believers from the coast of Lake Peipsi. He arranged collecting campaign in various Russian schools and also recorded the performance situations in Russian language. Another archive employee who collected Russian folklore in a larger amount was Menda Ehrenberg. Later in the post-war period, one of the creative student collector Vera Voogla collected Russian folklore and deposited it in a separate archive that belonged to the University of Tartu. The collection was later redeposited to as series RKM, Vene. = Belarusian folklore collection = The Belarusian collection (ERA, Valgevene) contains 46 pages of manuscripts found by Paul Ariste in the abandoned flat of his teacher Peeter Arumaa, a Slavist scholar, who fled to the West during the WWII. These materials include self-records of Belarusian prisoner Ivan Kachur (Іван Качур) who wrote down tales and legends he heard from his grandparents, and materials evidently copied by Arumaa from printed sources. The whole collection is available in the digital repository Kivike. = Baltic-German folklore collection = Prior to the establishment of the Estonian Folklore Archives in 1927, Baltic Germans were the largest group of Estophiles to contribute to the folklore collection. Two cultural associations co-ordinated their efforts: the Gelehrte Estnische Gesellschaft (GEG), established in Tartu in 1838 and the Estnische Literarische Gesellschaft, established in Tallinn in 1842. Most Baltic German folklore material was collected randomly with the exception of the collection of the Learned Estonian Society. The collection is divided into materials collected in German (GEG, DH) and Estonian (GEG, EH). Even after Estonia gained independence in 1918, most members of the GEG were of German origin and remained so well into the early 1920s. Walter Anderson, a folklore professor at the University of Tartu, compiled about 2,500 pages of German folklore in five files in a series called ÕES, Anderson. After the founding of the Estonian Folklore Archives, new collections were supplemented by a designation ERA. The German collection is called ERA, Saksa which contains three volumes of about 1,200 pages. Partly these materials have been published as an e-publication titled Und Vater und Mutter und Lust und Leben. Although a substantial part of the foreign materials collected, the archived materials regarding Baltic Germans is relatively small, partly because early calls for folklore were done so in Estonian. Also because many of those collecting folklore did not have the language skills necessary to document Baltic German folklore and those who did have the skills felt it was unimportant. Further collection was also impeded by the Second World War as the Baltic Germans left Estonia after the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact was signed in 1939. = Swedish folklore collection = In the 13th and 14th centuries Swedes settled in the Western coastal regions of Estonia. Swedes had a social status similar to Estonians and it was less likely that their folklore would be documented due to inadequate knowledge of languages. This was during the first period of collection of folklore within Estonia initiated by Estophiles 1838. During the 18th century many Swedes were displaced by Russian authorities and relocated to Ukraine, where they established the community of Gammalsvenskby, but others may have been assimilated into Estonia. Data from the period of the independent Estonian Republic reflects that they represented 1% of the population. There are two files or approximately one thousand pages containing Swedish material in ERA, Rootsi. Data regarding these trends was collected primarily by Paul Ariste who focused his studies on Estonian and Swedish linguistic relations. In 1927 Ariste visited Estonian Swedes for the first time for the purpose of research and folkloric documentation with an emphasis on linguistic data, such as language of communication used among families within specific villages. Estonian Swedish folklore was also documented by Oskar Loorits. = Jewish folklore collection = Jewish communities were predominantly in urban centres. Jews and Swedes were granted cultural autonomy by the state along with Germans and Russians. Started in 1927, to 1930 the Jewish collection gathered already 385 pages.P. Ariste. Nichtestnische Sammlungen des Estnischen Volkskundlichen Archivs (1930). Sitzungsberichte der Gelehrten Estnischen Gesellschaft, Z.127-128. A The Estonian Folklore Archives contain approximately 700 pages on Jewish communities in the ERA, Juudi collection. University students of Jewish backgrounds (Elias Levenberg, Isidor Levin, S.B.Kaplan, S. Vilensky) recorded most of the material along with Estonian folklorist Paul Ariste. The Tartu Jewish school pupils were encouraged to participate by their teacher of Yiddish language and literature Elias Samuel Levenberg (Elja Levenbergs, Elja Lewnberg), former student of University Judaic studies. Tartu University folklore professor Walter Anderson supervised a portion of the collection process. Some of these materials were published in Ariste's article \\"Some Yiddish folksongs in Estonian song- repertoire\\" (1932).P. Ariste. Etlexe jidiše folkslider in dem lider-repertuar fun di estn (1932). JIVO bleter 3, Z.148-157. Jewish folklore was also documented in nearby Daugavpils Latvia by Isidor Levin. = Romani folklore collection = The collection of Romani folklore are contained under the heading ERA, Mustlased and include 250 pages. Romani people lived in Southern Estonia near the Latvian border along with Tartars and Latvians who also resided in this region. Folklorist Paul Ariste and musicologist K. Leichter made phonograph recordings and Ariste published a collection of Romani tales along with a number of essays addressing traditional culture. Paulopriit Voolaine documented a couple hundred pages on Romani folklore collected in Russian and later recorded in Estonian. This collection is under the heading of Ludza-files of the main ERA collections as his ultimate goal was to make a comparative with Ludza Estonian folklore. Romani folklorist Medni Pilve recorded a considerable amount of material in the 1960s on tape. = Latvian folklore collection = The Latvian collection (ERA, Läti) counts approximately 1500 pages, earliest part of which was gathered in border region of Valga in the end of 19 cent. Further the collection was contributed by field records from Latvians of Estonia (Kaagvere region) and East Latvia, provided by volunteer Allina Verlis, folklorists Elmar Päss, Herbert Tampere, Isidor Levin and ubiquitous Paul Ariste. Materials of ERA, Läti, recorded by Alina Verlis from Valka are available in Latvian digital archive of folklore.  Web-based databases of the Estonian Folklore Archives  With the start of the Digital Era in the mid-1990s, the Estonian Folklore Archives created the first digital registers and databases, which were intended to replace the analog index and card file system. Some archival materials received immediate digital counterparts and digital born materials were included in the collections. Currently, there are ca 30 thematic or genre based online databases, which focus on the materials, stored in the Estonian Folklore Archives. =Kivike= The File Repository and Archival Information System Kivike (an acronym of the phrase Kirjandusmuuuseumi Virtuaalne Kelder or the Virtual Cellar of the Literary Museum) is a project that was started in 2010. The aim of the File Repository is to preserve and increase accessibility of the collections of the Estonian Literary Museum and its departments (incl. the collections of the Estonian Folklore Archives), as well as to make archived materials available online for researchers and a wider audience. In the beginning, Kivike was developed mostly with the support by the European Regional Development Fund which allowed to digitize a total of 240,000 pages of publications and archival material relevant to Estonian culture and make these materials accessible through the system. By 2012, the first collections were completely digitized including the Jakob Hurt folklore collection (H), the folklore collection of the Estonian Students’ Society (EÜS). Kivike is still a growing project which has developed and supported by a variety of foundations and projects. Kivike encompasses digitized analog archival material, manuscripts, and photographs as well as digital material sent to the archives and metadata about the material.https://kivike.kirmus.ee/index.php?xid=+&dok;_id=21&module;=2&op;= It offers a general overview of all the reposited materials but also comprises specific genre-related databases for specialised research.Kulasalu, Kaisa (2015). Estonian Folklore, Cultural History and Literature in a Digital Form: The File Repository and Archival Information System Kivike. In: Folklore: Electronic Journal of Folklore 60, p. 141. https://www.folklore.ee/folklore/vol60/n04.pdf Additionally, it is possible to search the materials by keywords compiled by the Estonian Folklore Archive. =The database of Estonian runic songs= The runic song (regilaul in Estonian) is an archaic folk song tradition that plays an important role in Estonian folklore. The collection of runic songs were part of Jakob Hurt's large-scale folklore collecting activities across Estonia. In 2003 the work with the database for runic songs was started by the Estonian Folklore Archives to facilitate the access to the archival material for researchers as well as the public. Its structure was organised parallel to pre-existing publications of some of the archival material, which were compiled after the original classification system based on Estonia’s 101 parishes. The database was made available online in 2010 by the Archives’ folk song research group. It was developed with the help of the Finnish Literature Society following their example of runic song database SKVR. Each song in the database is visible in the initial version and in a semi-edited version. The initial version includes the original historic spelling and the idiosyncratic features of the collectors. The edited versions are changed according to current orthographic rules to make the songs more accessible for non-specialists. They still include dialectal peculiarities and the collector's phrasing. By late 2016 the database contained 83,547 texts which are searchable by the parish, the collector and the time (of recording) as well as by class, function, type, and genre. The database has an English-language interface but all the materials are in Estonian.Järv, Risto (2016). The Singing Wolf Meets His Kin Abroad. Web-based databases of the Estonian Folklore Archives. Estudis de Literatura Oral Popular, núm. 5, 2016, 29–44. https://revistes.urv.cat/index.php/elop/article/view/1797/1720 =The database of place-lore “Koobas”= Place-lore is an umbrella term for folklore focusing on place(name)s transmitted in prose. It includes (local) legends, beliefs, descriptions of customs, historical lore, and memoirs related to specific places. The structure refers hereby like the database of runic songs to the old parish system. Information on the current village, region, municipality or GPS-Coordinates can be found in the meta-data. Accompanying publications explain the location-specific features as well as its historical and social context. The database was originally created for on-site use in 1998 and converted into a web-based database in 2012. In late 2016 the database contained 28,560 entries. The digital material is highly dependent on the interests in specific regions by the Archives’ place-lore research group. Although the database also includes recent fieldwork, most of the materials are subject to personal data protection restriction and therefore not publicly accessible.Access can be obtained after logging in. By greater interest, the Estonian Folklore Archives era@folklore.ee can be contacted as well as the ERA Heritage Workgroup private.kohaparimus@gmail.com. This database is also part of the cluster database of the Estonian Heritage Board, which compiles archeological and folklore-related information on places. =The database of children’s games “Uka Uka” = The database of children’ games is built on the basis of several campaigns for the collection of children's games and lore. Materials were collected in 1920-1930, 1934-1935, 1992, 2007 and 2013. The collection initiative in 2013 was conveyed into a web-based publication http://www.folklore.ee/ukauka/arhiiv/1001 and inspired the creation of the online database. The materials include game descriptions, playing situations, childhood memories connected with playing as well as starting rhymes. The contemporary entries additionally provide information regarding the context, time, place, gender, age and number of players as well as the region they were collected in and data on the collectors. The materials are searchable by name, game type or activity involved. In late 2016, the database contained 2,077 descriptions of games, some of which are accompanied by photos, figures or children's drawings. =The database of folktales = The database of folktales emerged in 1999 and was released to public use in 2016. It was created by researchers from the University of Tartu and the Estonian Folklore Archives. The database is structured in three main categories: tales, storytellers and collectors. There is also a literature database with information on printed publications in relation to the stored tales. The materials are equipped with metadata, such as archival references, names of the performers and those who recorded them, places and dates of the collection of the materials, and types of folktales according to Aarne–Thompson–Uther Index. As for 2018, the database has 13000 entries,http://www.folklore.ee/era/teema/muinasjutt.htm but only small amount of texts have been made available online. Some materials are only accessible after being logged-in. =Databases compiled by the Department of Folkloristics= Materials of the Estonian Folklore Archives have been made accessible also via several other thematic databases compiled by the researchers of the Department of Folkloristics of the Estonian Literary Museum. Research and development activities While the importance of the primary role of the Estonian Folklore Archives as a physical repository of materials may have diminished, as many folklore databases are already available online, the EFA have maintained their central position largely because of specialised research. Continuing a long lasting tradition, there is still an endeavour to cover by and large all the subjects and genres of the materials in the Archives through the efforts of researchers and archivists competent within their field. Digital studio, as part of the Archives, supports digitisation of materials including video and audio records stored in the EFA as well as preparing audio and video material for publication. The research results of the Archive's workers are published mainly as articles and monographs, but academic source publications are also produced. =Research topics= Archives’ staff is currently doing research on various subjects, including such topics as ideologies and communities, runic songs, fairy tales, place lore, ethnomusicology, contemporary and children's folklore, and Estonians in Siberia. In recent years research on these topics has been funded through grants of the Estonian Research Council through the projects titled \\"Creation, Transmission and Interpretation of Folklore: Process and Institutions\\" (2003−2007), \\"Folklore and Folklore Collections in Cultural Changes: Ideologies, Adaptation and Application Context (2008−2013) and \\"Folklore in the Process of Cultural Communication: Ideologies and Communities (2014−2019). Runic songs EFA researchers work to understand poetics, pragmatics and linguistics of runic songs (regilaul). Their aim is to uncover the worldview these songs represent, the ways the songs were performed and collected as well as who were the singers. Researchers of the Archives contribute actively to the academic source publications on runic songs such as (Old Harp) and participate in complementing the database of Estonian runic songs. By the year 2020, thirteen regional volumes of Vana Kannel have been published - these editions cover runic songs from the parished of Põlva, Kolga-Jaani, Kuusalu, Karksi, Mustjala, Haljala, Kihnu, Jõhvi, Iisaku, Lüganuse, Paide, Anna, Kodavere, and Laiuse. Folklorists of the Estonian Literary Museum are currently compiling editions of songs from Peetri and Kullamaa parishes. Since 2000, the Archives has organised biennial runic song conferences that have been open to international communities of researchers in recent years. Papers of the conferences have been developed into collections of articles published in the Archives’ publication series Commentationes Archivi Traditionum Popularium Estoniae. A special issue of the journal Folklore: Electronic Journal of Folklore with a focus on Finnic runic song traditions, was published in 2014 after the conference on Regilaulu teisenemised ja piirid (Transformations and Borders of Regilaul). Members of the runic songs research group are currently , Helen Kõmmus, , , Ingrid Rüütel, Liina Saarlo, Mari Sarv and Taive Särg. Their research questions have concerned regional characteristics of runic songs including lexical and poetical devices, variety of discourses and ideologies reflected in songs, historical background of songs, relationships between runic songs and other folklore genres, stereotypes in songs, reflections of gender and singer's life in song texts, aspects of individual and collective creativity as well as the features used by particular singers. Since 2000, the Estonian Science Foundation has funded a variety of research projects on Estonian runic songs. From 2000-2003, the language and poetics of runic songs were analyzed, with three Master's theses defended, and 33 scientific articles published. From 2005-2008, the ETF's grant project focused on the myths and ideologies of runic songs, with three doctoral theses defended. Fairy tales The fairy tales research group was established in 1999 at the Department of Estonian and Comparative Folklore, University of Tartu. Since 2010 the group has been hosted by the Estonian Folklore Archives. From the very beginning the research group has focused on fairy tales stored in the Estonian Folklore Archives. The work has been conducted in order to digitalise manuscripts and sound recordings from EFA's collections, to develop typology of Estonian fairy tales and to prepare publications of Estonian fairy tales as well as conduct relevant special research on the topic. The research group also develops database of folktales and organises annual seminars on folktales. Members of the research group are currently Risto Järv (the head of the group), Kärri Toomeos-Orglaan, Mairi Kaasik and Inge Annom. The group is consulted by senior scholars Pille Kippar, and as well as by story teller Piret Päär. Estonians in Siberia The EFA's collection on Estonians in Siberia began with an expedition by Anu Korb and Astrid Tuisk in 1991 to the villages of and in the Minusinsk area, Krasnoyarsk Territory, which was largely funded by the Estonian National Culture Foundation and the Cultural Endowment of Estonia. These were later expanded to further fieldwork in the Krasnoyarsk Territory in 1992, the Tomsk Region in 1993, the Kemerovo Region and the Tomsk Region in 1994, three expeditions to the Omsk Region in 1995, 1996, and 1997, respectively, the Novosibirsk Region in 1998, the Omsk region again in 1999 and 2000 (two expeditions), the Krasnoyarsk Territory and Altai Territory in 2000, and the Tomsk Region in 2004, with the help of funding from the Compatriots and “Estonian Language and Cultural Memory”, a national program. Since 1991, fourteen people, in all, participated in the fieldwork in Siberia: Anu Korb (11 times), Astrid Tuisk (8 times), Ell Vahtramäe (3 times), Aivar Jürgenson (2 times), Andres Korjus (2 times), Kadri Peebo (Tamm) (2 times), Villi Sulger (2 times), Risto Järv (1 time), Indrek Kaimer (1 time), Aado Lintrop (1 time), Pille Niin (1 time), Mari-Ann Remmel (1 time), Mari Sarv (1 time), and Ain Urbel (1 time). Seen as a rescue collection to preserve folklore in danger of being lost, the collectors amassed files of songs, beliefs and descriptions of customs, folk tales, and firsthand accounts of daily life. In total, by the year 2014 the collection on Estonians in Siberia holds (all numbers approximated) 8,900 pages of handwritten material, 370 hours of audio recordings, 90 hours of video recordings, and 2,200 photographs. Youth-centered contemporary folklore Young people's and children's activities in daily life became a significant topic for contemporary folklore studies. As a result of large-scale political and social changes, children folklore started to change rapidly in Estonia since the beginning of the 1990s. Therefore, the Estonian Folklore Archives, in cooperation with the Department of Folkloristics of the Estonian Literary Museum, started to focus on gathering and analyzing these changes. In the light of this idea, in 1992 and 2007, there were nationwide competitions for schools about children games. For the first time in 2010, data from kindergartens were collected. Thousands of pages and tens of hours of audio and video recordings of folklore data from young people like graffiti, puzzles, proverbs, phrases, traditional tales, customs, games, and more are collected. In these surveys, the background, the impact of globalization, internet culture and the local traditions themselves formed the contemporary approach. Studies in contemporary folklore are published in the series \\"Contemporary folklore\\" published by the Department of Folkloristics of the Estonian Literary Museum. =Collecting activities= Every year Estonian Folklore Archives receive contributions from volunteers and professional folklore collectors, schoolchildren and university students. As usual in recent years, collected material are recorded on diverse media carriers. The President's Award for collecting folklore is given annually since 1994 to recognise and acknowledge the best contributors to the Estonian Folklore Archives. The circle of people, who help to record folklore, has been widening through collecting contests. Contests are dedicated to specific topics. Thus, in 2009 it was “The Finland of My Memories”, in 2011 – “Teatetants” (Relay Dance), in 2012 – “Something Funny Happened to Me”, in 2013 – competition for children's games collection, in 2014 – “Stories about Our Homes”, etc. The participants are mainly elderly people; yet, there are also schoolchildren and youngsters among them. In addition to standard Estonian, contributions are made in Russian, as well as in Estonian dialects (for instance, Võru, which can be also considered as a separate language). The availability of the means to conserve digital material has also introduced specific problems; for example, some collecting campaigns may result in the acquisition of a disproportionally large amount of a certain type of material, possibly causing diminished research interest in this type of material. In 2011, the countrywide campaign “Teatetants” was held to collect traditions of folk dance groups. In response to the appeal, 189 memory sticks, containing more than 3,000 pages of text and 13,600 photos – in addition to audio and video files – were sent to the Archives. This unprecedented large corpus consisting of an array of different media files was so unusual in the history of the Folklore Archives that after preliminary description, more radical steps had to be taken. Due to the limited human resources and storage conditions, only a quarter of the huge number of photos have been previewed; photos depicting recurring motifs have been grouped and the lists of captions compiled. It was decided that the rest of the material will be left unprocessed; for the time being it is currently waiting to be archived. On April 20, 2010 employees of the Estonian Folklore Archives created an institutional Facebook account to increase the efficacy of relevant folklore collection. The action was inspired by the ash cloud from the Icelandic volcano and the impact of this on the life of people all over the world.  Publications  There are several series published by the Estonian Folklore Archives. = Monumenta Estoniae Antiquae = This is the series of fundamental publications compiled on the basis of the Estonian Folklore Archives' materials by the EFA in cooperation with other folkloristic institutions. * Initiated in 1876 by Jakob Hurt, the first subseries Monumenta Estoniae Antiquae I: Estonum Carmina Popularia is dedicated to old type Estonian folk songs in trochaic meter (regilaul). Each volume of this series contains folk songs recorded from one parish and until now 13 volumes have been published. These include songs from Põlva (1886), Kolga-Jaani (1886), Kuusalu (1938), Karksi (1938), Mustjala (1985), Kihnu (1997, 2003), Jõhvi and Iisaku (1999), Lüganuse (2009), Paide and Anna (2012), Kodavere (2014), Vaivara and Narva (2018), and Laiuse (2019) parishes. * The second subseries Monumenta Estoniae Antiquae II: Eesti muistendid is dedicated to Estonian legends thematically divided into five volumes published between 1959 and 2014. The volumes published until now focus on legends about mythical giants (1959, 1963, 1970) and mythological diseases (1997, 2014). * The third subseries Monumenta Estoniae Antiquae III: Proverbia Estonica presents Estonian proverbs. This fundamental source publication was published in five volumes between 1980 and 1987. In addition to three volumes of texts (I–III) the series contains appendixes that provide information about folklore collectors (IV) and translations into Russian (V:1) and German (V:2). * The fourth subseries Monumenta Estoniae Antiquae IV: Aenigmata Estonica is dedicated to Estonian riddles. This series was published between 2001 and 2013. The two first volumes contain riddle texts, the third volume provides for readers indexes of folklore collectors and international parallels. * The fifth subseries Monumenta Estoniae Antiquae V: Eesti muinasjutud is the anthology of Estonian folk tales. Until now in this series have been published two volumes (2009, 2014) that concentrate on fairy tales. These scholarly editions of fairy tale types stored at the Estonian Folklore Archives provide an overview of all types of Estonian fairy tales (the first volume contains stories of ATU 300-480, the second volume ATU 500-749). There are two textual samples of most of the tale types. If there are fewer than ten recordings, one text is selected; if the archive contains more than 75 texts, three texts are included. While selecting textual samples the editors attempted to include those stories that are as complete and as narratively developed as possible. As far as the geographical representation is concerned, texts were chosen from all over Estonia. Furthermore, some textual samples have been derived from the Lutsi Estonian area in Latvia and from Estonian enclaves in Russia and elsewhere. = Commentationes Archivi Traditionum Popularium Estoniae (Eesti Rahvaluule Arhiivi Toimetused) = Commentationes Archivi Traditionum Popularium Estoniae is the Archives’ publication series that was published in 1935–1941 (16 volumes) and was restored in 2000. Since then 19 new volumes have been published, including monographs and collections of articles authored by the employees of the Archives. These works have been published in German, English and Estonian. List of the publications in this series is available on Archives' homepage. = Pro Folkloristica = The series is created as a space for young researchers participating at the traditional spring conference of young folklorists and ethnologists. Other areas of cultural research, such as history, semiotics, literature and linguistics, are also represented. The source material for the research is archival texts and recordings as well as field materials collected by the authors. In the articles, the context of Estonian folkloristics often serves for novel theories and methods of interpreting source material. Between 1993 and 2017 eighteen volumes have been published in this series. = Estonian Settlements (Eesti asundused) = The series includes publications on Estonian villages in Siberia. Between 1995 and 2017 seven volumes have published in this series. = Recordings from the Estonian Folklore Archives = This series was started in 2001. Up to May 2019 13 volumes have been published. List of the publications in this series is available at http://folklore.ee/kirjastus/?sari=9 and below some volumes (those that have online English versions available) have been listed. Vol. 3: Anthology of Estonian Traditional Music This Anthology of Estonian Traditional Music provides an overview of the earlier Estonian folk music tradition. Estonian Folk Songs and Instrumental Music compiled by Herbert and Erna Tampere and Ottilie Kõiva published in 1970 set with an accompanying song texts was the original edition. In 2003, the enlarged edition Anthology of Estonian Traditional Music was published on CDs with added parallel English translation of the texts. The anthology includes 115 archival recordings from the years 1912-1966. On the page of each song or instrumental piece there is a recording of the piece and abbreviated notation.

Dating  Graphite wheel thrown pottery occurs at Polish sites in layers dated to La Tène B to La Tène D and to the begimning of the Early Roman Period (1st century AD).

Ordia played a lead role in the emergence of Bukola Saraki who defied his party, APC's instruction to jettison his ambition for the seat and support the party's anointed candidate, Ahmad Lawan and the emergence of Ike Ekweremadu an opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP) senator as deputy president of the Senate. In September 2016, Ordia raised a security alarm that APC sponsored thugs had attacked PDP leaders and their supporters in Opoji driving them out of their homes blaming the police for doing nothing to protect the people in spite of early reports of the attack. In the build up to 2016 Edo State gubernatorial election, Ordia warned that the opposition PDP would resist all the rigging plans of the APC to win the election by manipulation. Ordia was re-elected to a second term in the Senate in 2019. In June 2019, Ordia emerged Senate deputy minority whip in a shadow election conducted by the PDP to elect its minority principal officers in the Senate.

Neal Rappleye, in the Mormon apologetics journal Interpreter, lauds Hardy's demonstrations of the Book of Mormon's \\"depth and complexity, multiple voices, and insightful readings,\\" that Rappleye believes bolsters its truth claims. In April 2016, the Journal of Book of Mormon Studies devoted an issue to Hardy's Book of Mormon studies, its editor saying, \\"We see his work as crucially transitional, bringing the scripture increasingly to the attention of the broader academy.\\" = Apologetics = Hardy, a Latter-day Saint, has joined proponents advocating tolerance within the faith for struggles with doubt. Providing context for his work, in his August 5, 2016 address at the annual FairMormon conference, he said, \\"Academics have little interest in debates about whether Mormonism is true or false, but they are increasingly interested in Mormonism as a religious and social movement.\\" When asked during the question-and-answer session concerning believers who harbor questions about the Book of Mormon's historicity, he said, \\"Can faith in the Book of Mormon as inspired fiction be a saving faith? And I think the answer is, absolutely.\\" A two-part 2017 article by Duane Boyce in the LDS apologetics journal Interpreter questions the didactic effectiveness of Hardy's study's ascriptions of possible psychological motives to individuals categorized as prophets within the Book of Mormon. Boyce believes literary analysis of this type retrograde to the book's divine purpose. Ralph C. Hancock published in Interpreter his argument that Hardy’s reading of the Book of Mormon is \\"in a way more religious than any other because it is more rational—that is, by allowing natural questions to arise and to resonate, he reveals characters to us (especially the three authors\\" [Nephi, Mormon, and Moroni] \\"that are more miraculous because they are more human.\\" = Background: Opening the Book of Mormon studies sub- discipline = Studies of the Book of Mormon–the foundational scripture of the Latter-day Saints–usually were apologetic (devotional) or polemical (critical of its truth claims) prior to about 2010. Parallel the burgeoning of Mormon studies generally as a field of more neutral scholarship in early 21st century, university courses began including literary studies of this book. In 2016, Nicholas J. Frederick said, \\"With a few notable exceptions, such as Philip Barlow’s Mormons and the Bible and Grant Hardy’s Understanding the Book of Mormon, full-length monographs devoted to [Book of Mormon studies] have been lacking.\\" In 2017, organizers of a Book of Mormon studies symposium said, \\"Grant Hardy has introduced the content and the depth of the Book of Mormon into the larger academic world...\\".

Her series Shot at Dawn records many of the sites across France and Belgium where around 1000 British, French and Belgian soldiers were executed for cowardice or desertion during the first world war. She photographed each site at dawn, the time that most of the men were executed; close to the date on which they occurred; and from around the same vantage that they were shot. It was commissioned by the Ruskin School of Art at the University of Oxford as part of a commemorative art series, published as a book in 2014 and exhibited in various places. Dewe Mathews completed an artist's residency at the Verbier 3-D Foundation, Bagnes, Switzerland in 2016 on the topic of the so-called Year Without a Summer, a period of severe climate deterioration. This provided the backdrop for Mary Shelley when writing Frankenstein (1818) whilst staying in the same area. Dewe Mathews' series made there, In Search of Frankenstein, is concerned with contemporary environmental and social issues via the themes of Shelley's novel.

The report was named after Sir Harry Platt, who was the President of the Royal College of Surgeons. Platt produced the report at the behest of the Ministry of Health in the UK government. The recommendations in the Platt Report, provided the means by which a child trauma ward of a hospital should be planned for children. Established on 12 June 1956, the committee that was to produce the report defined their remit as: :To make a special study of the arrangements made in hospitals for the welfare of ill children – as distinct from the medical and nursing treatment – and to make suggestions which could be passed on to hospital authorities. The findings of the report by the committee, was that hospitals were miserable places for children, and while in hospital, they had to follow strict ward routine, and were not allowed to play. Moreover, the most grievous of the findings, was that parents were, under no circumstances, allowed to visit their children outside visiting hours. Function Membership of the report committee included two surgeons, two physicians, one nurse and one Registered Sick Children Nurse. Over its lifetime from 1956 to 1958, the committee met 20 times to consider both written and oral evidence, taken from a number of organisations including the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, Royal College of Physicians, Royal College of Nursing, the Tavistock Institute and the National Association for Maternal and Child Welfare. The British Medical Journal confirmed in an article on 18 November 1961, that on the previous 9 November, that in reply to a question, in the House of Commons, the Minister of Health, Enoch Powell, accepted the report: :The government, with the agreement of the medical profession, accept the main principles of the report. Summary The Platt Report recommended that children should have unfettered access to their parents while ill. The Association for the Wellbeing of Children in Healthcare (NAWCH) had consistently campaigned over many years for the same position, and conducted ongoing monitoring of the effects of the report. In 1982, the NAWCH conducted a survey throughout England. The survey found that progress was slowly being made and 49% of wards studied allowed unrestricted access for parents. The survey also looked at where children were being nursed and found that despite the recommendations of the Platt Report being broadly accepted by the government in 1959, 28% of children were still being nursed on adult wards. Whilst it may have been anticipated that the parents denied open access to children were those whose children were being nursed on adult wards, the survey shows that 48% of children's wards still did not have open access. The children who fared worse were children on ear, nose and throat wards with 24% being denied visits on the day of operation and with many spending up to 36 hours away from their parents. Changes occurred rapidly from the 1980s onwards, due to a new generation of doctors and nurses who were sympathetic to the recommendations of the report. A follow-up study by NAWCH during 1986 showed great improvement, although a detailed look at changes in the interim year showed a few instances where small children's units had closed and children transferred to adult wards. The second survey was, however, on the whole very encouraging with 85% of parents having open access and another 4% of parents on open access except on operating day. With the introduction of the Leiden charter in 1988 from the European Association for Children in Hospital that became a working framework for national paediatric organisations in Europe and the creation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child formalised the Platt report recommendations at the international level. By 1993, a report by the Audit Commission, called Children First showed further improvements had been made, but highlighted the needs of adolescents, indicating that the Platt report recommendations had not been fully implemented. During the first two decades of 21st century, the re-framing of the idea of family centred care to a child-centred care approach was taking place. This approach was directly influenced by the UN convention, which in turn was driven by the Platt Report recommendations. Without the Platt Report directing policy at the national level within the United Kingdom from the 1950s onwards, it would have been unlikely these changes would have taken place. Even now, the Platt report is still considered relevant to the forming of policy that aims to improve childcare and associated services. Hospital visiting of sick children =1850–1910= To understand why the Platt Report was produced and put into effect, an examination of the hospitalization of children, leading up to the mid-1950s must be made. From the 1850s to around 1910, most of the cities in the UK had built their own children's hospitals, which included a large number of prestigious hospitals, e.g. Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow, Great Ormond Street Hospital and the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital. These were independent institutions funded by voluntary donations, and from research, were shown to be designed for the deserving poor largely reflecting Victorian values. Children could only be admitted, if they were sponsored by a letter of recommendation, from a hospital affiliate. The undeserving poor were sent to workhouse infirmaries, whilst middle class children were generally cared for, and indeed operated on, at home. These hospitals set their own rules and had their own way of working, including regulating admissions, that often excluded infants and children under the age of two on humanitarian and pragmatic grounds. The Scottish paediatrician George Armstrong, who established the first British dispensary, in 1769, was against in-patient care, i.e. hospitals for sick children. Armstrong stated: :\\"But a very little reflection will clearly convince any thinking person that such a Scheme as this can never be executed. If you take away a sick child for its Parents or Nurse, you break its heart immediately.\\" Objections to admission were sometimes based on pragmatic reasons, e.g. reducing the threat of cross infection from children with diseases such as typhus, diphtheria and measles, that were a major cause of infant mortality. The voluntary nature of hospitals meant that such outbreaks were very costly. Babies and small children required more nursing care. However, by the 1880s more and more hospitals were accepting children. By the 1870s, the prevalent view among doctors and nurses was that children were better off by being removed to hospital, away from the often poor, unsanitary conditions at home. There were enlightened people like surgeon James Henderson Nicholl of the Glasgow Hospital for Sick Children, who pioneered day surgery procedures such as Hernia and cleft palate and who stated in 1909 that: :in children under 2 years of age, there a few operations indeed that cannot be as advantageously carried out in the out patient departments as in the wards. Nicholl's believed that hospitalization wasn't necessary, and children were better cared from in their own home, both by their parents and by nurses who made daily visits to the children. Nicholl's recognised that separation from mother is often harmful. However, Nicholl's views were in the exception. For almost 50 years, whether children were in a workhouse infirmary, sanatorium or a hospital, they separated from the mothers and families and only visited, on a very strict visit schedule. By the end of the 20th century, children's hospitals had become :depersonalised scientific institutions dominations by both male and female professionals. =1910–1950= With the rising of behaviourism from the 1900s to the 1950s, children were rarely see as individuals, and they became more of a collective problem to be solved. Behaviourism had many advocates, and amongst the strongest proponents of the philosophy were John B. Watson and Truby King. Watson stated the following advice regarding children: :Treat them as though they were young adults. Never hug and kiss them, never let them sit on your lap. If you must, kiss them once on the forehead when they say goodnight. Shake hands with them in the morning ... try it out ... In a week’s time you will be utterly ashamed of the mawkish, sentimental way you have been handling it. King, who promulgated a specific kind of child rearing, advocated that the child had to be breastfed, based on a strict schedule every 4 fours, not to cuddle them, and not to feed babies or children at night, lest they cried and became spoiled. King had become well known, as a child rearing expert during the interwar period, and his advice was widely accepted by the medical community. By the 1920s, hospitals were grim places for children, and only addressed the physical needs of the child, never noticing the emotional and psychological needs. However, there were dissenting voices, both for those who had started to question the tenets of behaviourism, and those who already recognized the unique link between the child and their mother, who would nurse them in times of ill health and who always felt responsible for the child's recovery. Sir James Calvert Spence began the practice, then unique in Britain, of admitting mothers to hospital with their sick children, so that they might nurse them and feel responsible for the child's recovery. However, as a visionary, Spence was unique in this position, during that period in the 1920s, when he established his resident mother and baby unit in 1926. By the 1930s there was physicians who recognised the need, including Agnes Hunt, who introduced open visiting. During the interwar period, leading up to the World War II, research conducted by people like Harry Edelston and John Bowlby further eroded the importance and veracity of behaviourism. Edelston, a Psychiatrist in Leeds, detailed that children were emotionally damaged by their stay in hospital. In 1939, John Bowlby wrote an open letter to the British Medical Journal which criticized government plans to evacuate a million children from towns and cities to the safety of the countryside. Controversially, Bowlby and his co-signatories pointed out in a letter that the psychological danger of removing children under the age of five years, from their mothers far outweighed the dangers of leaving them in cities. Despite L.A. Perry's 1947 Lancet article, that vigorously protested the restrictions of parental visits on hospitalized children, Edelston wrote in 1948, that many of this colleagues still refused to believe in hospitalisation trauma Bowlby would later study 44 juvenile thieves and found that a significantly high number had experienced early and traumatic separation from their mother. Bowlby would use the data in 1949 on the delinquent and affectionless children and the effects of hospitalised and institutionalised care in the commission to write a report for the World Health Organization's on the mental health of homeless children in post-war Europe. In the late 1930s, work by René Spitz, an Austrian-American psychoanalyst, confirmed the findings by Edelston, Bowlby and Perry, specifically deleterious effects of hospitalization, based on his research with institutionalized children. Empirical research from both America and the United Kingdom now evidenced the premise that maternal deprivation was damaging to the child and this simple fact further challenged the tenets of Behaviourism. During interwar period, there was a growing realization, that the adhoc system of municipal hospitals, many that were former work house infirmaries and voluntary hospitals that provided 25% of care services, no longer provided the level of services that were needed and were no longer considered a good fit with the needs of the medical community. Indeed, by the 1930s many voluntary hospitals had already become fee-charging institutions. During World War II, the Emergency Medical Service that was established to care for civilian casualties during war, acted as a blueprint for what a future integrated medical care service, in the UK, could look like. With the publication of the Beveridge Report in November 1942, that posited the foundation of a Welfare state as well as an integrated medical care service in the form of a National Health Service, that was subsequently established in 1948, it enabled national policy directives to be applied to the whole service. The Platt Report was one of those directives, designed in a manner, to improve the delivery of care. =1950–1959= With the introduction of Penicillin into the majority of the medical community by the 1940s, the major objection by doctors and nurses, that visits by parents into hospital wards introduced cross infections had been removed. A major review in 1949, over an 11-month periods showed that children admitted to 26 wards in 14 hospitals showed no correlation between visits and cross infection from parents to children. Indeed, by that time, the working practices of doctors and nurses, still posed the main objection to visiting. Hunt reported that: :The hospitalised child was considered essentially a biological unit, far better off without his parents who, on weekly or bi-weekly visiting hours, were fundamentally toxic in their effect, causing noise, generally disorderly conduct, and rejection by hospital personnel However, the prevailing view was starting to change. John Bowlby, the British British psychologist, psychiatrist, and psychoanalyst along with his research assistant at the Tavistock Clinic, James Robertson, the Scottish social worker, and psychoanalyst, started researching the separation of young children by their parents. Bowlby was the scientist who developed classic theories about maternal separation. Robertson focused his research on separation of mother and child due to hospital admission. When Robertson first started to make observations of young children in hospital wards, he was shocked by the unhappiness he saw among the youngest children, in particular those aged under 3. The competent, efficient doctors and nurses gave good medical care but seemed unaware of the suffering around them. They saw that children initially protested at separation from the parents, but then settled, becoming quiet and compliant. However, Robertson saw this as a danger signal. Based on several years of observations in long and short stay wards, Bowlby and Robertson formed a theory of phases of response of the under 3's to a stay in hospital without the mother: Protest, Despair and Denial/Detachment. In the protest phase, the child is visibly distressed, cries and calls for their mother. In the despair phase, the child gives up hope of his mother returning and becomes withdrawn and quiet, and may appear to be 'settling'. In the denial/detachment phase, the child shows more interest in his surroundings and interacts with others - but seems hardly to know the mother when she visits or care when she leaves. Finally, the child seems not to need any mothering at all. His relationships with others are shallow and untrusting. Bowlby's and Robertson's research was met with hostility by the medical profession. Even their colleagues at the Tavistock Clinic, although accepting, did not feel the same sense of urgency. In 1951, Bowlby and Robertson attempted to get their views across, by presenting to the British Paediatric Association but these views were rejected. Instead Robertson decided to take a different tack, by making a short, silent, black and white, documentary film in November 1952, called A Two-Year-Old Goes to Hospital Using a hand-held camera, Robertson working with his wife Joyce Robertson, a researcher, selected a little girl, called Laura, aged 2 years and 5 months, who was admitted to hospital, for the removal of tonsils, a common operation in those days. Laura was initially composed, until she realised her mother had actually left her there, and the film shows how she developed acute and continuous distress... Laura pleaded to be taken home, but as her protests and pleadings were useless, they were gradually followed by despair. She became listless, unsmiling and her traumatised emotional state was heart-rendingly clear, and on those occasions when her mother did visit during the eight days she was in hospital, Laura would turn away from her. Robertson's film was shown to the Royal Society of Medicine on 28 November 1952, before a large audience of doctors and nurses. Donald Winnicott on seeing the film spoke of highly successful film that dealt with a real problem and evidenced the fact that he himself had seen irreversible change as a result of the separation of small children from their mothers. Both the editors of The Lancet and The BMJ discussed the meeting. The BMJ agreed that the 2-year-old girl was unhappy, and that this was in line with the findings of John Bowlby. The Lancet stated that the audience frankly refused to admit that the child was distressed and were reluctant to believe that it might cause long term damage. Robertson's memory of the meeting, was that it was if we had dropped a bomb in the hall and that the film encountered much resistance and rejection. The speakers also supposedly also said that Robertson had slandered paediatrics and the film should be withdrawn. Two people who were at the meeting were Donald Winnicott and Sister Ivy Morris from Amersham Hospital and they agreed to a second filming on their ward. Robertson later took film and viewed it to American paediatricians in 1953, but curiously American audiences confirmed that the film findings were applicable to British children, but they did not apply to American children, and were perhaps less cared for and protected in an overindulgent way, and were, therefore, less upset at being separated from their parent. However, Robertson's subsequent research in the United States merely confirmed his findings, and showed that on both sides of the Atlantic, there were those who were in favour of unrestricted visiting, and those who were not. Robertson eventually viewed the film to paediatricians and other healthcare professionals in the United Kingdom, France, Denmark, Netherlands, Norway and Yugoslavia. Robertson noticed that younger professionals were more accepting of the evidence, while senior professionals tended to reject the film. Robertson's successor film was called, Going to Hospital with Mother. Robertson chose Amersham Hospital specifically, as every mother of a child under 5 years was invited to come into residence in the hospital, without discriminating between good mothers and over-anxious mothers. Bowlby and Robertson created a film, which was more about the study of human relationship, and showed how children responded differently to treatment when mother was present and how the staff of one hospital had created a way of admitting the mother with the child without making structural changes to the ward. The second film was based on Sally, who is 20 months old, and is lively and funny. When attending hospital for a minor operation, she arrives with her mother. When the surgeon calls, Sally protests, but with her mother there, her protest is brief. The film follows Sally throughout the hospital visit with her mother present throughout. When Sally returns home, she has none of the attendant disturbed behaviour of those who have been in hospital without their mother. Even though the film was shown widely, the pace of progress was still glacial. Indeed, The Lancet reported in 1956, that only 10% of hospital now restricted visiting, even though the Minister of Health Robin Turton was repeatedly asking for changes. Platt report The glacial process resulted in pressure being bought to bear by both James and Joyce Robertson with other doctors and parents against the medical establishment, and resulted in Robin Turton commissioning the Central Health Services Council, that was part of the Ministry of Health, to establish a committee to undertake a special study of the arrangements made in hospital for children and the very young and to make recommendations to those hospitals, in the form of a report. The Terms of Reference for the production of the report was: :To make a special study of the arrangements made in hospital for the welfare of children - as distinct from their medical and nursing treatment - and to make suggestions which could be passed on to the hospital authorities. The report was commissioned on 12 June 1956. Sir Harry Platt, who was a former president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England was chosen to be Chairman of the committee. The committee met 20 times to take evidence from both sides of the debate in a manner that was scrupulously fair. Both parents and health professionals as well as children's organisations including charities gave evidence. The Association of British Paediatric Nurses provided evidence to the contrary, arguing for the status quo, that frequent visitors bought infection into the ward. Both James Robertson and John Bowlby also provided evidence. James Robertson appeared in front of the committee with Dermod MacCarthy to show his film A Two-Year-Old Goes to Hospital, but upon requesting the BBC to show the film nationally, were refused, as the BBC had consulted medical opinion, which agreed that the film would cause anxiety to parents. However, the evidence provided by James and Joyce Robertson was extremely influential to the final recommendations of the report. The final report was sent to Lord Cohen of Birkenhead, Chair of the Central Health Services Council on 28 October 1958. The Platt Report was made up of four sections, dealing with preparation for admission, admission procedure, in- patient care and patient discharge, respectively. The Report had profound and lasting effects on the welfare of children, not only with the United Kingdom, but in other countries like New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the United States. The main recommendations of the report were: * Hospitals should have a separate children's outpatients department or a separate waiting room in an adult department or casualty department. Children and adolescents should not be nursed on an adult ward. There should be facilities for inside and outside play. Each nursing team should include a sick children's nurse and the child should have access to other staff such as social worker, occupational therapist and nursery nurses. * Prior to admission there should be hospital open days allowing families to have preparatory talks with hospital staff. Hospital leaflets and letters should be available. GP's and health visitors should give explanations and reassurances to children and families. * Whilst in hospital, children should be allowed to keep their personal possessions and wear their own clothes. Children should have access to education. Admission of mothers should be considered in the first few days for children under 5 years of age. There should be unrestricted visiting from parents, at reasonable hours of the day and there should be facilities for visitors such as playrooms for siblings and a canteen. Parents should be kept informed of their child's progress by both nursing and medical staff. * Unpleasant medical techniques should be kept to the minimum. There should be separate treatment and recovery rooms so other children do not witness distressing procedures. Parents should be present at recovery of anaesthesia. Discussions between medical staff should be kept to the minimum in front of children. * Children with special needs may need more in the way of pre-admission preparation. There should have access to any special equipment that is necessary. They should be taught by children who have specialist skills or can access such expertise. * On discharge from hospital, parents should be warned about behavioural problems that may arise at home, and how to get advice on how to deal with them. General practitioners should be informed in advance and sent as full a report as possible. * Doctors, nurses and other staff who care for children should be given training about the emotional needs of children in hospital, and how to adjust their procedures to suit children. =1959–1980 Post Platt= During the twenty years after the Platt Report, parents wanting to visit their sick child who were formerly excluded, moved to parents being tolerated by the medical community when they wanted to visit their sick child and this was a break from what could be considered tradition and a move towards a more humanitarian viewpoint. James Robertson continued to research the problem and to share his findings. He wrote four influential articles for The Observer and The Guardian newspapers to disseminate his ideas, and the issue started to gain traction. In 1961, the BBC agreed to show excerpts of A Two-Year-Old Goes to Hospital and his other films and Robertson gave an live introduction to the films and asked parents to submit their experiences of hospital care to him. The stories Robertson received from the parents were published in 1962 in a book called Hospitals and Children:A Parent's-Eye View. Harry Platt himself wrote the foreword to book. Jane Thomas, a young mother living in Battersea, contacted Robertson, to ask what she would do if her own child was hospitalised, and Robertson suggested forming an organisation, which Thomas and a group of women did. The organisation was called the Mother Care for Children in Hospital and was founded in 1961. Thomas sent a letter to The Guardian detailing her experiences, and the responses allowed the organisation to grow and campaign for the full implementation of the report. Soon regional groups appeared all over the UK and these amalgamated in 1963, and became the National Association for the Welfare of Children in Hospital (NAWCH) in 1965. Although the Platt Report was accepted by the Ministry of Health and government, they were under no legal obligation to implement the report. In this manner, the NAWCH became a pressure and advocate group, applying pressure both on the government and the nursing profession, which throughout the 1960s and 1970s continued to resist the new recommendations, and advocating for sick children and their families. The NAWCH developed a series of techniques to get hospitals to relax their strict rules. One of these techniques was carrying out surveys of all hospitals, which found that although the hospital said they allowed unrestricted visiting, the reality would be different. One hospital reported they allowed unrestricted visiting, but not in the mornings. Another stated, that It was the aim of the board of Governors to have unrestricted visiting, as long as the parents understand that they can't be in the wards all the time. Otorhinolaryngology wards were particularly bad, often getting parents to sign a consent form, that made them agree not to visit the child on the day of operation. Another technique was to recruit sympathetic doctors and nurses who could advocate for change. The NAWCH drew attention to these practices by issuing press releases detailing their findings and providing leaflets to parents when visiting hospitals that allowed unrestricted visits, telling them of this fact. By 1969, a NAWCH survey of 67 hospitals showed that only 57% allowed unrestricted visiting. The same picture emerged regarding the results of survey of 636 hospitals in the United States, reporting only 62% allowed unrestricted visiting. With a desire to seek a more benevolent approach to the care of children in hospital, changes occurred that led to a broader trend within the development work. In Toronto, the Hospital for Sick Children was at the forefront of this approach, when it introduced a blueprint to enable parents to care for their children. The kind of approach developed in Toronto was called Rooming-in, and described a hospital unit at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, where both the mother and father look after their newborn baby in a room where both mother and baby are cared for together. The Rooming-in concept as a philosophy of family centred care was later adopted in Canada. A good example of this was developed at McMaster University in 1969, in building a new Health Science Centre. Nursing staff arranged visits to specialised facilities for the architects of the centre, enabling the nursing unit and nursery design to be changed to incorporate the Rooming-in concept to be adopted at the centre. In the 1960s, the Care-by- parents model was being developed with the first unit developed and established in Lexington, Kentucky. In these Care-by-parents units, parents would live with their sick child. This model was developed to both safe money and quality of care, under the supervision of a nurse. The Care-by-parents room was designed with en-suite facilities. Coffee and tea making machines were provided with laundry facilities. In these units, parents were taught to care for their child and were particularly beneficial for babies who were being breast fed. For that model, the role and expectations of the parents were outlined on admission. In findings by Clearly et all in a structured observational study, found that children in these units spent less time alone, slept less and cried less. In contrast those children outwith the units, spent time with an ever-changing group of nurses, spent more time alone, spent more time sleeping and cried more. For chronically ill or handicapped children, the benefits of these units were more apparent in terms of shorter and fewer visits. The study noted that where a care by parent option could be introduced into a paediatric unit, it had a distinct social and psychological advantages for the children in hospital as well as longer term benefits. In a 1968 study by Brain and Maclay's in the University Hospital of Wales in the United Kingdom, 197 children who underwent tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy were split into three control groups. The study found that children without a resident parent did sleep more than the others, children who in the scheme cried less in total than the others outside it, and that nursing staff spent less time with the care by parent group that with the others despite the demands of teaching and support. It also found that children who were accompanied by their mother had significantly lower rates of post-operative complications, including infection and emotional distress, than those who were unaccompanied. However, nurses involved in the study still preferred the children to be admitted on their own, but also admitted that mothers were a great help to their children, but felt it was much easier to carry out the medical procedure when the child was left on their own, which enabled the nurse to have a closer contact with the child. Research also showed, that 4% of mothers were difficult to handle by the nursing staff The seminal report by Pamela Hawthorn, published in 1974 and called Nurse, I want my mummy! changed the face of patient care in the UK. Commenting on the report in the BBC article, Professor Martin Johnson, professor of nursing at the University of Salford, stated of the report that: :Pamela's study was done against the background of a lively debate in paediatrics and psychology as to the degree women should spend with children in the outside world and the degree to which they should be allowed to visit children in hospital... Of course we know now that they had almost given up hope that mum was ever coming back....But children were alone and depressed so Hawthorn said parents should be allowed to visit. Hawthorn investigated nursing care in 11 hospitals, used qualified nurses who asked questions from standardised questionnaires to gather the research, and found that unrestricted nursing times ranged from the full days access to just a few hours a day. In wards that recognised and implemented Platt's recommendations, it was found that children were less likely to be lonely or miserable. The most important finding from the study and what prevented the widespread uptake of Platt's recommendations was the lack of Registered Sick Children's Nurses (RSCN) on the wards. Hawthorn's report found that only 575 RSCN nurses were being trained annually in the 1960s and 1970s, which was insufficient to ensure that every children's emotional and psychological needs were being addressed properly while in ward. =1980–2009 Shift to parental participation= By the 1980s it was obvious to observers that the situation was changing in respect of the ability of parents to visit their sick children in hospital and care for them. Pressure groups like the National Association for the Welfare of Children in Hospital worked tirelessly to push back the boundaries of care, and influenced the development of advocacy in the wider social contract. In 1982, an NAWCH survey was conducted that looked at access on children's wards throughout England by Rosemary Thornes. The report found that 49% of wards studied allowed unrestricted access for parents. The report looked at where children were being nursed and found that despite what the Platt Report recommended, 28% of children were still being nursed on adult wards, and that 48% of children's wards still did not have open access. The children who fared worse were those on the otorhinolaryngology wards, with 24% being denied visits on the day of the visit, with many children spending up to 36 hours away from their parents. It was clear that attitudes were changing as a new generation of doctors and nursings arrived, that naturally accepted the findings of the Platt report, but were stymied by outdated processes, infrastructure and traditional attitudes. In 1984, the National Association for the Welfare of Children in Hospital decided to issue a charter to reflect their values and in order to raise the quality of services for children. Jenny Davison of the NAWCH wrote that it was formulated by procedures which have become a model for later standard setting. The charter was constructed of 10 principles, with e.g. principle 2 stating that Children in hospital shall have the right to have their parents with them at all times. (with caveats). Principle 3 stated that it was the child had the right to information appropriate to age and understanding. The charter was approved by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) and the British Paediatric Association (RCPCH). The Sainsbury report, A study by the NAWCH in 1986 showed huge improvements in the proportion of wards with entirely unrestricted access for parents with 85% of wards allowing open access to parents, but estimated that only 67% of parents were welcomed, and 24% only accepted and 9% only tolerated. The study report also stated that where small children's units had been closed, the children had been transferred into adult wards. The 1988 study by Rosemary Thornes, for the NAWCH, supported by the RCN and the RCPCH recommended that all parents under the age of five years should be offered overnight accommodation. During the 1980s, the medical community continued to research the problem domain, identifying the benefits of parents caring for their children both with the UK and internationally. The Keane report, 1986, found that a number of resident parents in hospital perceived their children as temperamentally vulnerable, and needed special reassurance and explanation. The Sainsbury report, 1986, found that nurses believed that their work role was enhanced, and that most parents coped with caring duties, and were grateful for being considered important in the process of healing. International research focused on different aspects of parent-child care. A Canadian report of 1983, by Evans and Robinson focused on the economic aspects of care-by-parent units by a parent's stay on the ward can reduce costs by resuming nursing tasks, limiting unnecessary procedures, and encouraging early discharge An American report by Stull and Deatrick in 1986, tried to find a methodology for measuring the effectiveness of parental participation in the care of the hospitalized child. The process used was for 24 parents to be tested with 11 parental involvement activities and the research submitted to 19 experts for analysis. The 11 categories were then to subject to metrics to identify their effectiveness of focus on the activity. An Irish report in 1989, by Taylor and Connor also looked at the reduction in costs associated with parents caring for their child in hospital. The report found that hospital visits were 31% shorter than those whose parents were not resident, representing a shorter stay in hospital, and a saving as well as meeting the needs of the child, including less emotionally disturbing time spent in hospital visits. Although research was being conducted in the 1980s to explore the different benefits of parents caring for their children both within hospital, within the community and at home, and were wholly accepting of the Platt report, the British government had a restored focus on the needs of both young and adolescent children, due to a number of sentinel events, that occurred during the late 1980s and early 1990s with the Platt Report being referred to during proceedings. This resulted in the UK government allocating additional funding to train more Registered Sick Children's Nurse's (RSCN). This one action sped up efforts to achieve the full implementation of the Platt Report in the UK. In the international stage, events were occurring that was progressing both the implementation and acceptance of the Platt report recommendations. The European Association for Children in Hospital (EACH), was an umbrella association representing a number of member associations involved in the welfare of all children in Europe. In 1988, twelve of the member associations of EACH, met in Leiden and created a charter, based on the recommendations of the Platt report and the charter created in 1984 by the Action for Sick Children charity, the new name of the NAWCH. The NAWCH changed names in 1990. The Leiden Charter, as it was colloquially named, became a working framework for the national associations that were part of the EACH. The Leiden charter consisted of 10 points. and was eventually ratified by 16 European countries and Japan. Other events were taking place at the same frame as Leiden charter. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child was ratified by the UK 16 December 1991, and most of the rest of the world as well, except the United States. Somalia was the last state to finally ratified it on January 2015. The convention not only dealt with the specific needs and rights of children, but also decided that states must act under the principle of best interests of the child, specifically in this context of not being separated from their parents. Signers are bound under international law. That is defined under Article 3 of the convention. =2010-2018= During the first two decades of the 21st century, the re-framing of the idea of family centred care to a child-centred care (CCC) approach was taking place. The child centred approach is an evolution of family centred care, but neither approach can exclude the other, with CCC recognising the critical importance of parents. The recognition of the idea of the child as active member and equal, meant the child was to be included in the care partnership, defining a conceptual relationship as child in family rather than child and family. The relationship was not either/or but either/and. The child-centred approach is cognizant of the fact that the child has their own ideas and can make choices, that are in the best interest of the themselves, i.e. being an active member in the partnership. Recent research has show that children are capable of learning skills as healthcare members, the ability to effectively communicate with both health professionals and parents, defining goals, and using decisions to get the best possible outcome. Although agreement on the definition of child centred care has proven elusive, some principles of child of the approach have been definedPrinciples underpinning child-centred health services, Department of Health, 2003 * Consider the whole child, not simply the illness or condition. * Treat children as children and young people as young people. * Be concerned with the overall experience of the child and the family * Treat children, young people and parents as partners in care. * Integrate and coordinate services around the child's and families particular needs. * Graduate smoothly into adult service at the right time * Work in partnership with children, young people and parents to plan and shape service and develop the workforce. For much of the 20th century, healthcare has been one of the many contexts in which the child has disenfranchised, and denied their right to participation in their own care. With the release of the Platt report, this slowly changed, until family centred and later child centred care became well understood. However, even now the full recommendations of the Platt report have not been implemented. For example, where similar standards are in place, the co-location of children within adult wards is common.

Biography As a writer, Valdés began publishing poetry – his first book appeared in 1954 – but he then moved on to prose. His first novel, Cuerpo creciente, saw the light in 1966, and won the Santiago Municipal Literature Award the following year. Valdés studied film in Prague in the 1960s. He lived a couple of years in Paris, and in 1970 he returned to Chile by sea. Pablo Neruda was also traveling on the ship and Valdés brought the originals of his second novel: Zoom. He left in 1971, under the Popular Unity government, and it would be the last work he published in Chile before departing for exile. After Pinochet's coup d'état, on 12 February 1974, armed civilian agents entered his apartment in Santiago in search of Miguel Enríquez, leader of the Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR). Although they were mistaken – Valdés declared that he did not know anyone from the MIR – he was arrested and admitted the following day to the prison camp of Tejas Verdes (Llolleo), where he was tortured. Valdés spent a month in Tejas Verdes, and when he was released, he sought asylum at the Swedish embassy. In May of that year he arrived in Barcelona, and a few days later began to write what would become Tejas Verdes: Journal of a Concentration Camp in Chile, \\"the best story that exists about the pain of a subject put through military humiliation in the first months of the dictatorship.\\" After his testimonial book – published the same year in Spain, but only be published in Chile 22 years later, in 1996 – Valdés returned to fiction and wrote other novels. A partir del fin, focused on the military coup of 1973, came out in Mexico in 1981 (in Chile, also 22 years later).

He is an Iranian writer and a literary critic. He belongs to the Third Generation of Iranian writers. He is the fiction editor of the international literary magazine Neweshta. He was one of the speakers at the Commemoration of Omar Khayyam, held on 18 May 2014. His research on Omar Khayyam suggests that Khayyam as mathematician, employed the least vocabularies and simplest words to express his thoughts in his work. Therefore, his work resembles the short story style of our time. He is one of the Juries at the Mehregan Adab.[ مهرگان ادب] By creative employment of Gonabad's folklore such as dialect, culture, traditions, ceremonies, and myths in his short story collections \\"Mahi dar bad\\" (Fish in the wind) and \\"Anduh\\" (Sarrow), as well as in his novel \\"Khiyaban-e Bahar abi bud\\" (Bahar avenue was blue), Hossein Atashparvar presents a portrait of the people living in this region to the Iraninan literature. To honor Atashparvar's contribution and to employ his expertise, the Gonabad's literature association has been renamed to \\"Hossein Atashparvar's House of fiction\\". Atashparvar started to write before 1970s. His first short stories were published in 1972 by Khorasan Newspaper.

Robinson compass mask is similar to kirsch compass masks, but is simpler to implement. Since the matrix coefficients only contains 0, 1, 2, and are symmetrical, only the results of four masks\\"Computer imaging: Digital image analysis and processing (Second ed.)\\" by Scott E Umbaugh, (2010) need to be calculated, the other four results are the negation of the first four results. An edge, or contour is an tiny area with neighboring distinct pixel values. The convolution of each mask with the image would create a high value output where there is a rapid change of pixel value, thus an edge point is found. All the detected edge points would line up as edges. Example An example of Robinson compass masks applied to the original image. Obviously, the edges in the direction of the mask is enhanced. original_image Robinson North Mask Robinson NorthWest Mask Robinson West Mask Robinson SouthWest Mask Robinson South Mask Robinson SouthEast Mask Robinson East Mask Robinson NorthEast Mask References Category:Feature detection (computer vision) Category:Image processing ","title":"Robinson compass mask"},{"id":"57225049","text":"This is a list of 924 species in Hydraena, a genus of minute moss beetles in the family Hydraenidae.

It is a form of pruning in that it removes noisy or redundant branches (spurs) generated by the skeletonization process, while preserving information-rich \\"trunk\\" segments. The value assigned to individual branches varies from algorithm to algorithm, with the general goal being to convey the features of interest of the original contour with a few carefully chosen lines. Usually, clarity for human vision (aka. the ability to \\"read\\" some features of the original shape from the skeleton) is valued as well. DSE algorithms are distinguished by complex, recursive decision-making processes with high computational requirements. Pruning methods such as by structuring element (SE) convolution and the Hough transform are general purpose algorithms which quickly pass through an image and eliminate all branches shorter than a given threshold. DSE methods are most applicable when detail retention and contour reconstruction are valued.  Methodology  = Pre-processing = Input images will typical contain more data than is necessary to generate an initial skeleton, and thus must be reduced in some way. Reducing the resolution, converting to grayscale, and then binary by masking or thresholding are common first steps. Noise removal may occur before and/or after converting an image to binary. Morphological operations such as closing, opening, and smoothing of the binary image may also be part of pre-processing. Ideally, the binarized contour should be as noise-free as possible before the skeleton is generated. = Skeletonization = DSE techniques may be applied to an existing skeleton or incorporated as part of the skeleton growing algorithm. Suitable skeletons may be obtained using a variety of methods: * Thinning algorithms, such as the Grassfire transform * Voronoi diagram * Medial Axis Transform or Symmetry Axis Transform * Distance Mapping = Significance Measures = DSE and related methods remove entire spurious branches while leaving the main trunk intact. The intended result is typically optimized for visual clarity and retention of information, such that the original contour can be reconstructed from the fully pruned skeleton. The value of various properties must be weighted by the application, and improving the efficiency is an ongoing topic of research in computer vision and image processing. Some significance measures include: * Discrete Bisector Function * Contour length * Bending Potential Ratio * Discrete Curve Evolution = Iteration = Each branch is evaluated during a pass through the skeletonized image according to the specific algorithm being used. Low value branches are removed and the process is repeated until a desired threshold of simplicity is reached. = Reconstruction = If all points on the output skeleton are the center points of maximal disks of the image and the radius information is retained, a contour image can be reconstructed  Applications  = Handwriting and text parsing = Variability in hand-written text is an ongoing challenge, simplification makes it somewhat easier for computer vision algorithms to make judgements about intended characters. = Soft body classification (animals) = The maximal disks centered on the skeleton imply roughly spherical masses, the features of the extracted skeleton are relatively unchanged even as the soft body deforms or self-occludes. Skeleton information is one facet of determining whether two animals are the \\"same\\" some way, though it must usually be paired with another technique to effectively identify a target. = Medical uses = Investigation of organs, tissue damage and deformation caused by disease.

The parasitoid that has been recently studied for its mechanism of parasitism. It reproduces by laying eggs within the abdomen of a spider by oviposition, slowly developing as an ectoparasitic koinobiont that will eventually kill its host. The wasp larva protects itself during the parasitism process through neuroparasitism affecting and controlling the behavior of the spider to the extent that they are unable to attack the larva. The mechanism is still fairly unknown, but it is believed that it involves hormones and/or polydnaviruses. The larva will influence the spider to the extent that it will build a web/cocoon for the pupal stage of the parasitoid wasp. Z. percontatoria wasps are distributed worldwide within several different countries, mostly within terrestrial locations that are rich with tree species preferring woodlands. Members of the order Hymenoptera are both parasitic and non-parasitic as some families continued to evolve as parasites while others lost parasitism as a trait. The family Ichneumonidae is one of the largest in the animal world, containing over 20,000 species that have been described or identified in some way. Although it is difficult to pin down exactly how many species there are within the family, there have been estimates that range from 60,000 to over 100,000.  Morphology  General example of wasp morphology Z. percontatoria is symmetrical with the females being generally larger. The flagellum, which are the antenna on the wasp's head excluding some of the base section, has around 18-20 segments in the female. The head, as well as most parts of the body, is covered with small hairs known as pubescence. This is especially long around the mouth of the wasp. The area covering the head of the wasp has a grainy exterior. The eyes are bare to the environment and the head appears to be convex upon further inspection. However, the head converges downward when viewed from the lateral side. In the jaw or mandible, the upper tooth is longer and wider than the lower tooth. The head is black with yellowish white sections with the flagellum being light brown. The mesosoma is rather rigid in terms of flexibility. There can be wrinkles seen increasing closer to the different ends of wasp's mesosoma. The pubescence are shorter on the mesosoma compared to the head. The hairs are short so that the mesosoma appears to be smooth and bare. The mesosoma is a darkened and reddish brown, with yellowish white sections. The legs are a pale brown. The wasp has two pairs of membranous wings, which are held to the body by small hooks. Veins run through the wings. The fore wings are larger than the hind wings. The average female fore wing length is 3.0-3.8 mm. The legs are slender and held together by segments. The metasoma goes back breaking into five different parts. The wasp will get skinnier the closer to the caudal end. The ovipositor is black and brown. The ovipositor has a strong, slender base that thickens to a tapered point medially used for quick insertion. The wings are brown and clear in the sections that are mainly membranous. The metasoma like the mesosoma is a darkened and reddish brown. Male Z. percontatoria wasps are similar to females except that they are smaller and darker in color. The flagellum for the males contain 18 segments and they have an average fore wing length of 2.9 mm. Larvae are usually a pale yellowish white. There are small differences between the parasitic wasps as they are distributed around the world, but this description mainly refers to the Z. percontatoria native to Japan.  Lifecycle  Silk cocoon of Zatypota percontatoria (RMNH.INS.593327), preserved specimen - BDJ.1.e992 The lifecycle begins when a female wasp is able to successfully oviposit an egg within the abdomen of a spider within the family Theridiidae. Z. percontatoria is a unique species in that although the wasps are koinobionts, they are one of the rare cases of being ectoparasitic as well. Although the egg begins inside of the spider, eventually it will hatch into a larva. It does not use an immobilization or paralyzing agent, so the spider develops as the egg/larva develops. As time progresses, the larva bursts out of the spider and continues as an ectoparasitoid. The larva will develop using the nutrients from the spider's hemolymph. When the larva moves out of the abdomen, it remains connected to the hemolymph for nutrients as an ectoparasitoid. How large the larva gets ultimately depends on the size and nutrient availability of the spider. The spider may continue to forage and take part in activities that ultimately increase the fitness of the larva. However, Z. percontatoria has to be careful because it have to protect itself and the spider from their predators. The spider when it is parasitized is not able to defend itself as it could before it was parasitized. The mechanism is unknown as to how the larva is able to alter the behavior of the spider, but there are multiple hypotheses. One is that it may be controlling the central nervous system directly through the influence of neurons, although it is unlikely as Z. percontatoria connects to the hemolymph not directly associated with the nervous system. The more likely of the hypotheses is that Z. percontatoria is not controlling the spider directly but influencing it through hormones in the endocrine system by activating certain pathways of the spider. The spider does not exhibit any behaviors that are outside of its normal scope, however the usual timing of the behaviors is altered. This is because the larva is using the spider's behaviors to increase its fitness and chance of survival. By increasing the levels of hormones that promote certain actions, the larva alters the normal behavior of the spider to its advantage. The larva also has a mutualistic relationship with polydnaviruses that suppresses the immune system preventing it from making any counter-action. However, if the larva is ever removed the spider returns to normal control and behaviors. The longer that a larva is able to remain on a spider, the longer it will take that spider to recover if the larva is taken off. This action also supports the hypothesis that the change in behavior is most likely the result of an accumulation of hormones stimulated or released by the larva. Before the spider is fully able to reach adulthood, the larva enters the pupal stage. This stage is the most vulnerable state of the parasitoid wasp's lifecycle. This is the part of the lifecycle that explains why Z. percontatoria prefers the web-building spiders of the family Theridiidae. The larva will begin influencing the spider to build a web. Scientists hypothesize that the larva is somehow able to increase levels of the hormone that encourages behaviors that the spider would conduct before molting or ecdysis. This hormone is elevated levels of 20-OH-ecysone. The web is not the typical type used for capturing prey, but resembles a web similar to one that it would build before overwintering. The web can be seen to be shorter for a stronger build, thickened webs that won't break, and a reinforced frame. The web is stronger, defense-based, and depending on the spider will create a cocoon that will house the larva. This will aid the fitness of the larva when it enters the pupal stage by creating a camouflage, and protecting it from predators and the outside conditions of the environment. When the web is done, the larva kills the spider host and consumes its body. The larva is then ready to enter the cocoon where a metamorphosis takes place. The pupa will emerge as an adult wasp, usually female as they are able to reproduce starting the cycle again. As an adult, the wasps mainly feed on nectar. Some larva will overwinter during winter. The active months of Z. percontatoria are between March and November varying depending on the climate of the geographical location. Example of web-building spider from the family Theridiidae (Theridion impressum)  Host-parasite dynamic  Z. percontatoria, like many parasitoids, is host specific with a narrow range. Z. percontatoria parasitizes members of the arthropod family Theridiidae. The specific host species for Z. percontatoria in a given area varies depending the species of the family Theridiidae that are abundant within that area. Spiders as hosts are able hunters making them difficult prey to parasitize. An additional factor adding to the level of difficulty in ovipositing is that the spider is usually the same size if not larger than the wasp. The wasp has to be big enough to be able to handle itself in a battle with the spider and precise enough to oviposit an egg in the abdomen of the spider. If the wasp is not careful, it will get injured and/or be unsuccessful in an attempt to parasitize the spider. Z. percontatoria prefers female spiders because they forage more than males leading to increased nutrients that the host can provide. The wasps increase their chances by usually parasitizing juvenile spiders that are less able to defend themselves against the wasp. Juvenile spiders are also preferred due to the koinobiont lifecycle of the wasp. On average, they will spend around 34 days parasitizing a host. So adult spiders are better able to defend themselves and may die before parasitism is complete. On the other hand, infant spiders cannot handle the stress of the parasitism. However, Z. percontatoria wasps are adaptable and will change its habits based on the climate, size of the spider population, and the abundance of spiders. As parasitoids, the wasps will keep the spider population stable as to promote a better fitness for itself. There is a correlation between the number of parasitized spider and the abundance of the population. The more spiders there are, the higher the number of spiders that are parasitized. Warmer climates promote faster lifecycles and colder climates will take longer for the lifecycle to be complete. Parasitic wasps are unable to reproduce and survive at any temperatures at or below 5 degrees Celsius. The rate of parasitism within a given spider population is low, usually around 1%. Spiders will defend themselves and without an immobilization agent are difficult to parasitize. Mortality rates are highest in the egg and larval stages of the parasitoid wasp as well so they may die before they get the chance to finish their lifecycle. Also unless they are able successfully camouflage or protect themselves, predators in the environment can take advantage and kill them as well. With its parasitoid lifecycle taking a great deal of time, there is much that could go wrong resulting in mortality. These are fairly recent studies that need further research to back up and confirm.  Habitat and distribution  Map of Holarctic areas. Z. percontatoria is Holarctic in distribution. The parasitoid wasps prefer terrestrial woodland locations with a high population of trees. The parasitoid wasp is found in equal distribution in the understory or in the leaves of the canopy, as web-building spiders can be found in both levels. An abundance of plant species and numbers promote species diversity including those of parasitoids and hosts. Parasitoid wasps, although located in many places in the world, are rarely the dominating population in terms of influence or numbers.  Evolution and phylogeny  Evolution is a process where traits that increase the fitness of an organism are favored and therefore natural selection keeps them in the lineage creating speciation. So for parasites, it is most likely that the way that they harm and feed off another organism was beneficial to them and caused an evolutionary change. The environment most likely could not provide completely for the organism, forcing it to prey on another organism for nutrients forming what would be the basis for parasitism. The complexity of the strategies make it difficult to pin down exactly how they were created. In the order Hymenoptera, parasitoidism only evolved once. This created the bee, ant, and parasitoid wasp species that followed. Parasitism was lost in species that it did not benefit or add to their fitness. For the parasitoid wasps, evolution added a wasp waist and the ability to sting which formed the basis of the mechanisms that Z. percontatoria employs.

Greene's Energy Group, LLC, 584 U.S. ___ (2018), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the inter partes review process granted by Congress to the United States Patent and Trademark Office for challenging the validity of patents, rather than a jury trial, is constitutional and did not violate either Article III of the Constitution nor the Seventh Amendment.. Background The United States Congress passed the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act in 2012. Among its provisions, the Act gave the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) the ability to handle challenges to patent validity following their granting through an improved inter partes review process.. Prior to the Act's passage, a party could request USPTO to initiation a full re-examination of a patent, which was a lengthy and costly process for the office. Alternatively, the party could challenge the patent through a jury trial within the Circuit Court system. With the new inter partes review process, a party can seek to invalidate specific claims of a patent based on published prior art by filing a petition with the USPTO. The owner of the patent may then file a response to the petition. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) then reviews the materials, and if it deems there is a reasonable challenge, it will hold a trial hearing with the parties, and issue a ruling on the validity of the claims in question. This process was designed to reduce the time and costs of dealing with inter partes challenges to patents. Since its implementation, the inter partes review process has come under some criticism. Large tech firms support the process as it enables them to fend off patent infringement challenges from patent trolls without extensive costs.Joe Mullin, \\"Supreme Court will weigh in on troll-killing patent-review process\\", Ars Technica (June 13, 2017), Archive In contrast, biomedical and pharmaceutical firms are critical of the process since it is a non-judicial review by which rival companies can challenge and invalidate their patents, which often are the product of extensive time and costs for research and development.Susan Decker, \\"Likes the Patent 'Death Squad.'

In 2012, Oil States filed a patent infringement lawsuit within the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against Greene's Energy Group, LLC, claiming that Greene's Energy were violating their oilwell protection patent. In addition to defending itself and attempting to prove the patent was invalid in the District Court, Greene's Energy filed a petition for an inter partes review with PTAB to challenge two of the claims of Oil States' patent, which if found invalid, would nullify the patent infringement claims. Following receipt of Oil States' response to the petition, the PTAB found that there was a likelihood that Greene's Energy's challenge would prevail and initiated the inter partes review. Both the District Court trial and the inter partes review ran simultaneously. While District Court denied summary judgment to Greene’s Energy, allowing the case to proceed,Oil States Energy Servs., L.L.C. v. Trojan Wellhead Prot., Inc., No. 12-cv-611, 2014 WL 12360946, at *11 (E.D. Tex. June 23, 2014). the PTAB ruled that the two claims were invalid and cancelled Oil States’ patents.IPR 2014-00216. Oil States appealed PTAB's decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, both on the patentability of the claims in question, as well as challenging the inter partes review process. Oil States stated that patents were considered to be a private right, and challenges to patent validity is a judicial process requiring a jury trial. Therefore, they claimed the inter partes review process violated Article III of the Constitution and the Seventh Amendment. Because Oil States' appeal challenged the America Invents Acts, the federal government joined as a respondent to the case. Both Greene's Energy and the federal government called upon the Federal Circuit decision in MCM Portfolio LLC v. Hewlett-Packard Co., which had ruled in a similar manner that the USPTO's patent granting authority was \\"a federal regulatory scheme\\" and considered a public right based on the Supreme Court's ruling in Stern v. Marshall,. and that the inter partes review did not violate Article III nor the Seventh Amendment. While MCM Portfolio was petitioned to the Supreme Court, it declined to hear the case at that time.Brian Mudge & Clifford Ulrich, \\"to Decide 2:Are AIA Patent reviews Constitutional?\\", Nat'l Law Review (June 22, 2017), Archive The Federal Circuit Appeals Court summarily affirmed the PTAB's ruling, leading Oil States' to petition the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari to hear the case in November 2016. The Court granted certiorari in June 2017 specifically to address the Article III and Seventh Amendment questions raised by Oil States. Supreme Court The case was heard by the Court on November 27, 2017, and announced judgment against Oil States on April 24, 2018. Voting 7-2 to affirm the lower court, the Court held that the inter partes review process did not violate Article III or the Seventh Amendment. =Opinion of the Court= The majority decision was written by Justice Clarence Thomas and joined by Justices Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Thomas asserted that the granting of a patent was a public right and more specifically, a public franchise, and as found in Louisville Bridge Co. v. United States,. the government can authorize and deauthorize that franchise to a private entity without intercession of an Article III court.Timothy Lee, \\"Supreme Court upholds patent review process, dealing trolls a blow, Ars Technica (Apr. 24, 2018), Archive Thomas stated that the inter partes review \\"is simply a reconsideration of that grant, and Congress has permissibly reserved the PTO's authority to conduct that reconsideration\\". The Court stated that its opinion did not contradict established case law that patents are private property, such as found in United States v.

It was created by digital painter Israel Herzl, a fourth cousin of Theodor Herzl. He was joined by fellow Israeli artists Shai Yehezkeli, Yael Bar Tana, and Boaz Arad. The exhibition commemorated the 120th anniversary of the First Zionist Congress in Basel, in 1897. Within eight years, Herzl had positioned Zionism as a world movement with institutions that led to the establishment of the State of Israel. The first exhibition opened in the Herzl Museum on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem on 1 October 2016. Foreign Ministry Director General Yuval Rotem heard about the exhibition at the Herzl Museum. He was deeply impressed and asked to present it in four other exhibitions under the sponsorship of the Foreign Ministry – in Jerusalem, Vienna, Geneva and Basel.

Ivan Mazepa (1639–1709) was a significant figure in the history of Ukraine. One story about him says that as a young man, he was caught in flagrante with a noblewoman, whose husband punished him by tying him naked to a wild horse and setting them free; eventually he reached the Cossacks and became their military leader. This legend caught the attention of the English poet Lord Byron (\\"mad, bad, and dangerous to know\\"), whose Mazeppa (1819) brought the events to wider attention. His narrative poem inspired many paintings, particularly by French Romantics, which in turn stimulated musical compositions, stage plays, more poems, and so on. New life was breathed into the equestrian tale when it was transposed to the American Wild West. With the independence of Ukraine in 1991, the figure of Mazepa is once again on the international stage. The historical figure Mazepa served as Hetman of Zaporizhian Host (head of state of a Cossack military territory) in 1687–1708. He played an important role in the Battle of Poltava (1709), where - after learning that the Russian Tsar, Peter the Great, intended to replace him with Alexander Menshikov - he deserted his army and sided with King Charles XII of Sweden. The political consequences and interpretation of this switch of allegiance have resonated in the national histories both of Russia and of Ukraine. The alienation of Mazepa from Ukrainian historiography continued during the Soviet period, but post-1991 in independent Ukraine there have been strong moves to rehabilitate Mazepa's image, although he remains a controversial figure. Byron's poem Currier and Ives illustration to their 1846 printing of the poem Lord Byron published his narrative poem in 1819. According to the poem, the young Mazeppa is serving as a page at the Court of King John II Casimir Vasa when he has a love affair with the Polish Countess Theresa, married to a much older count. On discovering the affair, the count punishes Mazeppa by tying him naked to a wild horse and setting the horse loose. The bulk of the poem describes this traumatic journey. The poem has been praised for its \\"vigor of style and its sharp realization of the feelings of suffering and endurance\\". There is no historical evidence to support that Mazepa was exiled from Poland because of a love affair, nor that he was punished by being strapped to a wild horse. However, this colorful legend was in circulation before Byron published his poem. Voltaire repeats it in History of Charles XII, King of Sweden (1731). This appears to have been Byron's main source for his poem: his 'Advertisement' to the poem includes three long quotations from this work. Several critics have also speculated that Byron was familiar with the Mémoires d'Azéma (1764) by the French writer André Guillaume Contant Dorville, as there are significant similarities between the plot of that novel and of Byron's poem. The first wave of reaction Louis Boulanger, Mazeppa Byron's poem was both popular and influential in the Romantic period. Horses in art had long been a popular theme, so when the poem was translated into French the same year by Amédée Pichot, a wave of French painters decided to depict Mazeppa's \\"wild ride\\", including Théodore Géricault (1823, now held in the Metropolitan Museum of Art), Eugène Delacroix (1824, Finnish National Gallery), Horace Vernet (1826, Musée Calvet in Avignon), and Louis Boulanger (1827, the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen). Boulanger's The Ordeal of Mazeppa and Vernet's Mazeppa and the Wolves both competed in the Salon of 1827. This last was adapted by John Doyle as a satirical print in the Reform Crisis of 1832, with King William IV tied to a horse labelled \\"Reform\\", and about to leap over the \\"Revolutionary Torrent\\", while the wolves have the faces of the Duke of Wellington and other politicians.Image with National Portrait Gallery note Depictions in art continued for at least fifty years; the usual moments shown were the hero being mounted on the horse, his nighttime ride, with or without pursuing wolves, and the eventual collapse of the horse. The next scene of a herd of wild horses surrounding him and his dead mount is sometimes shown, mostly after another Vernet painting. A theatrical version of the story soon appeared: a show called Mazeppa, or the Tartar Horse premiered at Antonio Franconi's Cirque Olympique in Paris in 1825. This was copied in both the USA and England. Aleksandr Pushkin wrote a poem-response to Byron entitled Poltava (1828–29), which opens with an epigraph from the Englishman's poem, and in which he portrays Mazeppa as a villain who betrayed Russians. Victor Hugo was inspired by the French Romantic paintings to compose \\"Mazeppa\\", one of the major pieces in Les Orientales (1829), which he dedicated to Boulanger. The first part of his poem describes Mazeppa's run across Ukrainian plains. The second part compares Mazeppa to a poet banned from the living world because of his eccentricities, the banned poet is attached to the wild horse of his inspiration. The comparison to the poet ends by saying that this crazy trip through suffering finally gives success and glory to the poet.

Another French Romantic painter, Théodore Chassériau, re- interpreted Byron's poem, with Cossack girl at Mazeppa 's body (1851, Musée des Beaux-Arts de Strasbourg). The Irishman Michael William Balfe composed a cantata known as The Page or Mazeppa in 1861. The subject reached the very popular medium of Staffordshire figures, where the fancy of the painters sometimes showed him tied to a zebra.Example, c. 1860 Milner's hippodrama was adapted and burlesqued over the decades. For example, in 1856 it was re- written as an equestrian burlesque in two acts, by blackface minstrel entertainer Charles \\"Charlie\\" White. The main antagonist is Castiron, and his daughter is Olinska. The Mazeppa story became \\"a well-worn melodrama in dire need of revitalization\\", which it received from the performer Adah Isaacs Menken. Other women had played Mazeppa (see Breeches role), including Charlotte Cushman, but Menken's interpretation  \\"sexing up\\" the part, scandalously performing the nude scene clad only in a flesh-colored bodystocking—really caught the public imagination. Many other female Mazeppas followed, as did a new wave of burlesques. Mazeppa was very popular during the American Civil War and became the most widely performed drama in the American west from the 1860s until the turn of the century, and was also popular in London. Agnes Thatcher Lake, a circus performer and equestrian all her life, took a production of Mazeppa to Europe in 1865, performing before Prince Karl of Prussia. She then took her production across the United States, the only circus to do so, performing under her company's big top tents in towns and cities without a theatre big enough to host a stage show. A 2009 biography of Lake (who later married Wild Bill Hickok) estimates that two million Americans saw her athletic interpretation of Mazeppa, many more than saw Menken's sexualised one . The 1870s-1880s Bogomir Korsov as Mazeppa, Bolshoi Theatre, Moscow, 1884 In 1877, Albert Aiken wrote a dime novel called The Indian Mazeppa or The Madman of the Plains, in which the myth is transposed to the Wild West. Pushkin's poem became the subject of an opera entitled Mazeppa, written between 1881 and 1883, with three acts and six scenes. The music is by Tchaikovsky and the libretto by Victor Burenin. It is set in Ukraine in the 18th century, and is a story about love, abduction, political persecution and vengeful murder. In 1910, Francis Boggs produced a short film based on the stage play of Byron's poem titled Mazeppa or the Wild horse of Tartary. Since 1990 In 1991, Ukraine declared independence, and Mazeppa rose again in international consciousness. A French drama film titled Mazeppa, based loosely on the lives of the painter Géricault and the equestrian Franconi, won a prize at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival. Gericault decided to stay and live with the circus and painted only horses to try and understand the mystery of this animal; Mazeppa embodies a man carried away by his passion. A Ukrainian film by Yuri Ilyenko loosely based on historical facts, called A Prayer for Hetman Mazepa was released in 2002.Molitva za getmana Mazepu (2002) A South African interpretation of the Mazepa-Mazeppa motif describes it as \\"Romantic Phaethon\\" (a character in Greek mythology who drove the sun-chariot too recklessly) and points to its appeal to Modernist poets such as Bertolt Brecht and Roy Campbell.VOSS, Tony.

Creation In the spring of 1972, Mutual Broadcasting System president C. Edward Little announced the creation of two new networks designed to target minority audiences: the Mutual Black Network (MBN) and the Mutual Spanish Network, or Mutual Cadena Hispanica. Both services signed on May 1, 1972; MBN had 32 affiliates, while MSN began with 17 affiliates, mostly in the southwestern United States. Miguel Bomar was hired as news director for MSN, which aired 16 newscasts every day at :45 minutes past the hour between 7:45 a.m. and 11:45 p.m. eastern time. Two sportscasts were fed weekdays, three on Saturday and Sunday.Mutual Radio Tribute Site One advertisement for the new network (headlined \\"A Spanish News Network? Si!\\") stated, \\"Now, for the first time, advertisers can reach the U.S. Spanish market on a national basis with network radio...one order, one billing covers outstanding Spanish radio stations in all the important U.S. markets.\\"Robert L. Hilliard, \\"Media, Education and America's Counter-Culture Revolution\\" (Ablex Publishing, 2001), p.89 Problems and closure From the start, advertiser support was lacking for MSN: it wasn't until August that the network signed its first sponsor, when Sterling Drug bought 15 commercials on an alternate-week basis for Bayer Aspirin. One problem was a lack of commonality among the then-eleven million Americans who spoke Spanish. Instead of one audience united by an ethnic background, Mutual found three distinctly different groups of Spanish-speaking Americans: those of Puerto Rican descent on the east coast; Cuban-Americans in the southeast; and those of Mexican descent in the southwest and on the west coast. And with each group using a different dialect, the network's newscasts were unintelligible to a large portion of the audience.Mutual Radio Tribute Site Ultimately, MSN didn't have enough advertisers to keep it going, and the network signed off after about six months.

For her aid to Jews in Brittany during the Second World War, she as well as her parents were recognised as Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem. A militant communist who was involved with the French Resistance during the Second World War, she was imprisoned for supporting the FLN in the Algerian War.  Biography  = Early life = Anne Beaumanoir was born in Brittany on 30 October 1923, in Guildo, a commune in the Arrondissement of Dinan in the Côtes-du-Nord department, the daughter of restaurateurs Jean and Marthe Beaumanoir. = Second World War = During the Second World War, Beaumanoir was a medical student and a clandestine militant member of the French Communist Party. Her parents regularly sent food parcels to her through friends. One day in June 1944 these friends informed her that there would be a raid the following night in the 13th arrondissement of Paris, and asked her to warn a woman called Victoria, who was hiding a Jewish family. Although she knew that the Communist Party frowned on unauthorised rescue missions, Beaumanoir went to Victoria's apartment to warn her. She was introduced to the Lisopravski family, and its two youngest members, the son, Daniel, aged 16, and the daughter, Simone, aged 14, agreed to go with her. She took them to a hiding place where several members of the French Resistance were staying. Soon after it was raided by the Gestapo, but the two teenagers escaped over the rooftops along with the leader of the Resistance group. Beaumanoir was not in Paris at the time, but when she returned she collected the children from the temporary hiding place where they were staying, and took them to live with her parents at their home in Dinan. In Dinan, her father, Jean Beaumanoir, was interrogated by the police, who suspected that he was a member of the Resistance, but was released for lack of evidence. Her mother, Marthe Beaumanoir, hid the two children in different locations for a fortnight, but the couple then kept them at their home for a year. After the war, the two children remained in contact with Beaumanoir and her parents. = Post-war = Beaumanoir returned to her medical studies in Marseille. She became a professor of neurology, and married a doctor. She had a falling out with the Communist Party, and left it in 1955. In Marseilles, she met the worker- priests and became familiar with their social work among the Algerians there. She returned to Paris, where she became a medical researcher. She sided with the FLN in the Algerian War, and was arrested in November 1959 and sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. Incarcerated in Baumettes Prison, Beaumanoir was initially kept in solitary confinement, but was then tasked with teaching fellow prisoners how to read and write, and writing letters for them. Because she was pregnant, she was provisionally released after serving eight months in order to give birth. After the birth of her son, she escaped to Tunisia, where she joined the FLN, serving as a neuropsychiatrist under Frantz Fanon. After the Évian Accords ended the Algerian War, Beaumanoir worked for the Minister of Health in the government of Ahmed Ben Bella. When he was overthrown in 1965, she fled to Switzerland, where she became the director of the neurophysiology department of the University Hospital of Geneva. She is currently retired, and lives some of the time in her hometown of Saint-Cast- le-Guildo in Brittany, and some of the time in Dieulefit in the Drôme department. She has called for the reception of Syrian refugees. = Recognition = Anne Beaumanoir was recognised as one of the Righteous Among the Nations on 27 August 1996 by Yad Vashem, along with her parents. In 2016, investigative journalist and documentary filmmaker Denis Robert and his daughter Nina Robert co-produced a documentary on Beaumanoir's life titled Une vie d'Annette.

The band consists of lead singer Arrow de Wilde, guitarist Henri Cash, bassist Tim Franco and drummer Seth Trump. They have released two studio albums, Starcrawler (2018) and Devour You (2019). Starcrawler lead singer Arrow de Wilde and guitarist Henri Cash both attended Los Angeles' Grand Arts High School. De Wilde is the child of photographer Autumn de Wilde and drummer Aaron Sperske. History =Origins= In the summer of 2015, Arrow de Wilde and Austin Smith came together to collaborate in making music. When the school year began in 2015/2016, the two decided to recruit new members, a guitarist and bassist. One day during school Wilde saw Henri Cash and asked: \\"You look cool, do you play guitar?\\" Cash was actually carrying a tuba. Wilde later recruited bassist Tim Franco. In an interview with FY Magazine when asked about the origins of the name Starcrawler drummer Austin Smith said \\" It’s something I just came up with, random word association\\" Arrow also added \\" We got our first show booked and didn't have a name.\\" http://fuckingyoung.es/starcrawler-band/ = 2017 - 2018: Early period and debut album = Starcrawler's debut 7\\", \\"Ants\\" / \\"Used To Know\\", was released in 2017 on red/white splatter vinyl with a picture sleeve in a limited edition of 500, which sold out quickly. Starcrawler released their first 7\\" single from their debut album, \\"I Love LA\\" / \\"Castaway\\", on Rough Trade Records on February 16, 2018. The single features a photo of the band on the front and back labels, and comes in a pink sleeve. In March 2018, Starcrawler performed a number of shows at the world's biggest music showcase, South By Southwest (SXSW), in Austin, Texas. Their performances gained notoriety for their energy and antics. During their final gig at SXSW, lead singer de Wilde terrorized the crowd by spitting blood in the face of a photographer, hurling attendees' personal possessions into the crowd, and snot-rocketing in the face of another member of the audience. Starcrawler won the Grulke Prize for Developing U.S. Act at SXSW for their performances at the festival. Starcrawler performed their singles \\"Love's Gone Again\\" and \\"I Love LA\\" live on Later With Jools Holland on May 29, 2018, before starting their 2018 European Tour. The tour ran from May 30 to June 23 and included concerts in Spain, Luxembourg, Germany, Portugal, United Kingdom, Austria, France and the Netherlands. The band's self-titled debut album Starcrawler was released that year by Rough Trade Records on both white vinyl and black vinyl. 200 copies were also pressed on white vinyl with an alternate cover. Starcrawler released the single \\"Hollywood Ending\\" along \\"Tank Top\\" as a B-side on November 16. =2019–present: Devour You= On February 26, Starcrawler released the second single \\"She Gets Around\\" that recalls '90s alternative rock bands like Nirvana and The Breeders with heavy power chords and Arrow's outstanding vocal performance who snarls the tune's dark lyrics in between enthusiastic growls and howls. The band participated in the motion picture soundtrack for the film Pet Sematary by making a cover of the Ramones song with the same title and was uploaded on April 5, 2019. On October 11, the band released their second studio album Devour You. On August 2, 2020, De Wilde stated on an Instagram post that she was sexually assaulted in a dressing room by a male stripper earlier in January while on tour with The Growlers in Melbourne, Australia. She clarified that none of the band members themselves had participated in the act, but had laughed and filmed the incident, and that she had repeatedly attempted to leave but was pushed down each time. The band's guitarist, Henri Cash, later made a statement that De Wilde's claims were true, and that the band had tried to break in to no avail. Lead singer of The Growlers, Brooks Nielsen, who was said to have orchestrated the incident, issued an apology on Instagram, and stated that guitarist Matt Taylor had taken temporary leave despite denying the allegations. On October 8, Smith announced on Instagram his departure from the band, citing in a post that he needed the time to “[find] the joy of life with family and friends,” and to take a “much needed break”.

Description Pseudupenus prayensis has a moderately compressed body with a head profile which is not markedly convex. It has a single spine on the rear margin of the gill cover and a pair of thick barbels below its chin. Both jaws are equipped with strong, conical teeth with a few of the outer teeth in the upper jaw being backward pointing and theser are obvious when the mouth is closed. There are no teeth on vomer and palatines. There are 8 spines in the first dorsal fin with the first spine being very short, the second dorsal fin has a single spine and eight soft rays. The body is covered in large scales with a count of 28–29 in the lateral line. It is normally a rosy colour marked with three or four horizontal red lines along its body. The largest fishes may have a standard length of but they are more normally . Distribution Pseudupenus prayensis occurs in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of Africa between southern Morocco and Angola, including the Cape Verde Islands and also in the Mediterranean Sea. Habitat and biology Pseudupenus prayensis occurs mostly over muddy or sandy sea beds where it feeds on benthic invertebrates. It may also be found over rocky reefs to depths of . It is common in estuaries. Usage Pseudupeneus prayensis is an important species for commercial fisheries along the West African coast. They are mainly taken using trawls, although they are also taken using trammel nets and entangling nets.

It is often accessed from the standard main menu (in Photoshop, Paint Tool SAI, and GIMP, as common examples), by clicking the icon of a dotted line shaped like a rope lasso, from which the common name arises.  Standard operation  The lasso tool operates on the active layer of an image, and is used by clicking and dragging to trace the edges of a selection. Most software supports multiple closed contours, which can be selected by crossing over the edge path multiple times. It is also typically not necessary to close the shape: releasing the mouse button triggers the software to close any open loop(s) automatically. The area enclosed by the cursor path will remain selected and open to various transform operators (shift, scale, cut, copy, and paste, for example) until elsewhere in the image is clicked. At this point, the lassoed selection will merge with the layer it was selected from.  Characteristics  In contrast to other image selection algorithms such as intelligent scissors, magic wand, or grabcut, lassoing places no requirements on the image, as the user is free to create any closed path.  Technical description  From an image processing standpoint, the lasso is fundamentally a masking tool. The edges of the mask are defined by user input, aka. the path of the cursor while the button is held down. A temporary new active layer is created which contains the logical AND of the masking layer and the active image layer. Meanwhile, the original active layer is masked (logical AND) with the inverse of the lasso selection. This creates the impression that the tool has sliced out a piece of the original image for selective transforms and edits. Most operations available for a full image can now be applied to the temporary active layer. When the layers are merged, pixels in the temporary active layer will replace the pixels in the active layer that they coincide (aka, pixels with which they share a location (row, column) in the 2D plane). \\"Empty\\" pixels are handled in one of two ways depending on whether or not the imaging software supports alpha compositing. They may take on the value of a default \\"background\\" color, or they may continue to be defined as transparent with an alpha channel value of zero.

Because of the report of pirates, she left in a convoy of eight vessels, of which she was the chief ship. Unfortunately, one of the vessels was Morning Star, a noticeably slow sailer, which was returning from Ceylon. The other six vessels soon out-sailed Susan, which held back to accompany Morning Star. Eventually Susan too left Morning Star at some point before 21 February. As Susan was sailing she encountered the pirate ship Black Joke, which was under the command of Benito de Soto. Black Joke was armed with one long gun amidships. At her approach, Susan ran out her four starboard guns. Black Joke pursued for two hours, and then sailed away. This was fortunate as although Susan had loaded shot, by some oversight she had not loaded powder. On 19 February 1828 Black Joke captured Morning Star near Ascension Island. de Soto killed Captain Souley and several others. The boarding party also assaulted the women passengers and plundered Morning Star.

Teta is currently the executive producer of The View, joining the series in its 19th season after spending 11 years working on The Late Show with David Letterman.  Early life and education  Teta attended Baldwin High School in Nassau County, New York. After graduation, he attended Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania. At Muhlenberg, Teta made his first forays into the broadcast industry, holding internships over the course of his career at Live with Regis and Kathie Lee, Montel, and The Late Show with David Letterman. He would later go on to work at Montel and The Late Show with David Letterman full-time. Teta worked as Paul Shaffer’s intern at the Late Show in 1997. Teta also worked as a sports editor, entertainment editor and associate editor of the Muhlenberg Weekly, the official, independent student-run newspaper of Muhlenberg College, as well as hosting a weekly radio show on WMUH, which was named one of the top 20 college radio stations by the Princeton Review in 2000.  Career  = The Late Show with David Letterman = After graduating, Teta spent five years working as a talent booker and producer for shows such as Montel, Ricki Lake and Judge Hatchett before breaking into late night television as a talent coordinator at The Late Show with David Letterman, responsible for booking guests. One of his first tasks with The Late Show was at the 2004 Summer Olympics, tasked to booking gold medal winners for each show. Teta also started out booking guests for David Letterman’s iconic segments “Stupid Pet Tricks and “Stupid Human Tricks.” [NY Post “Fetch Sketch” article]. He went on to work in numerous aspects of the show, including producing celebrity guest interviews, cooking segments, outdoor stunts, political guests and sports stars. He often produced Letterman's Christmas show, specifically Jay Thomas’ iconic annual segment with his Lone Ranger story and the “Quarterback Challenge.” Teta's success booking sports guests led to a unique statistic for The Late Show: They are the first show to book the Super Bowl-winning quarterback 10 years in a row, dating back to Tom Brady after Super Bowl XXXIX in 2005. Teta would run down to the field at the end of the game to book the quarterback, often going up to the player himself to ask them personally. In an interview with the New York Post in 2012, Teta spoke about turning The Late Show into a Super Bowl institution: “After the game the guy who wins is the hero of the moment and can do anything in the world. Lucky for us, that’s turned into, first, they’re going to Disney World, then they’re going to ‘The Late Show.’” Teta was elevated to Segment Producer in 2006, Producer in 2009, and finally Supervising Producer from 2012 until the show’s end in 2015. Teta was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Series – Talk in 2015 for The Late Show with David Letterman. = The View = In August of 2015, two months after Late Show ended, Teta was named Co-Executive Producer of The View at ABC, joining the show in its 19th season. ABC tapped Teta to produce “Live from Hollywood: The After Party with Anthony Anderson,” the network's post- Oscars show. Teta was elevated to Executive Producer on September 1, 2017, ahead of the debut of Season 21 of The View. The premiere week of Season 21 drew the show's largest overall audience in 3 years. Since Teta joined the show, The View has been nominated for 26 Daytime Emmy awards, including 4 nominations for Teta for Outstanding Talk Show / Entertainment and 1 nomination and win for Outstanding Talk Show / Informative.  Personal life  Teta resides in Rockville Centre, New York, with his wife Heather and their two daughters. He is an avid New York sports fan, rooting for the New York Giants and the New York Yankees. Teta, a lifelong comic book fan, was made a part of the Marvel Universe in April, 2006 when he was mentioned in Ms. Marvel Vol. 2, Issue #1, written by Brian Reed and illustrated by Roberto De La Torre, referencing his role as a talent booker for The Late Show with David Letterman.

She was not the only poet to leave her mark on this monument, or even the only female poet to leave her mark, but the inscriptions left by female poets on Memnon's leg are almost 6% of the surviving works by women from the ancient world. It is likely that she did not inscribe her poem herself, but instead paid a local stonecutter to do it for her in memory of her visit after she composed each poem. A popular belief at the time was that the statue of Memnon sang to his mother Eos, the goddess of dawn, because the stones made a sound as they were warmed by the rising sun. It is possible that this sound inspired her to mention her own mother.  Surviving poetry  1\\\\. By Trebulla.

Scarborough was president of the University of Akron from 2014-2016. At the beginning of his tenure, the University of Akron was heavily in debt after his predecessor's 15-year-tenure, which had seen major, expensive expansions. During his tenure, he sought to overcome this debt, but his decisions lead to major opposition from the university community, and he resigned after only two years in the position. After Scarborough took the University of Akron in July 2014, in an attempt to reduce spending, there were major layoffs of staff, including most of the university's press, and the intercollegiate baseball team was disbanded. The university sought to rebrand itself as \\"Ohio's Polytechnic University,\\" initially considering an attempt to change the name. The rebranding process often involved expensive advertising, and Scarborough at times made comments that outraged the several other presidents of universities in northeast Ohio. In a move some felt was an attempt to raise tuition in violation of Ohio legislative action on the matter, Scarborough imposed at $50 a credit-hour fee for upper level classes. At the same time, introductory-level courses were offered at lower prices in a way suggesting they were a better value than community college courses, a move that alienated the leaders of regional community colleges. Under Scarborough's leadership, the University of Akron founded a Center for Data Science, Analytics and Information Technology. It also established the Experiential Learning Center for Entrepreneurship and Civic Engagement. At the same time, the university president's residence was refurbished for just under $1 million. This was viewed by some as too costly, especially at a time of layoffs and increased tuition. The end of Scarborough's tenure came as he involved the University of Akron in talks with ITT-Tech to become the center of a national educational chain. Enrollment for fall of 2016 showed a very steep decline from previous years.

These trackways provide crucial insights to the study of the transition of aquatic to terrestrial lifestyles in vertebrate evolution. Such fossils help to illuminate not only the timing of this keystone transition of evolutionary history but also what the earliest forms of tetrapod locomotion may have entailed.  Occurrences  =Victoria, Australia= A set of three trackways was found within a single sandstone layer of the Genoa River Formation of Victoria, Australia. The Genoa River Formation is a very fine grained purplish-brown non-marine sandstone considered Late Devonian in age based on fern-like plant fossils within the bed and stratigraphic correlation. The tracks preserve four or more impressions each. Each trackway has a roughly parallel structure to the left and right tracks. None of the impressions are reported to include evidence of body dragging, though one includes evidence of tail drag. This is interpreted to illustrate that the movement shown here demonstrates the animal fully suspending its body with its limbs. Additionally, one of the tracks is interpreted to preserve digitation of the limbs, which are reported to possess 5 digits. These trackways then imply that by the Late Devonian a \\"typical\\" tetrapod condition had fully evolved. =Valentia Island, Ireland= Nine tetrapod trackways from three sites have been reported from the Valentia Slate Formation of Valentia Island, Ireland. The Valentia Slate Formation is composed mostly of purple coloured fine-grained sandstones and siltstones interpreted to represent a fluvial setting. The trackways are late Middle Devonian in age based on a palynological assemblage from the Valentia Slate Formation and the U-Pb radioisotopic dating of an interstratified air-fall tuff bed to ca. 385 Ma, making these tetrapod trackways some of the earliest recorded, along with traces of early Middle Devonian (Eifelian) age from Poland. The most extensive of the Valentia Island trackways is preserved in a fine-grained sandstone and records some 145 imprints in a parallel orientation of the left and right impressions. The systematic variation in size of the impressions affords distinction between tracks left by the manus and pes of the animal, but the trackway does not preserve any finer details. Other trackways at the same site preserve tail and body drag impressions; the nature of the impressions and that of the sandstone led to the interpretation that the setting was not saturated in water. Consequently, these tracks are interpreted as evidence of fully terrestrial locomotion. =Holy Cross Mountains, Poland= A collection of trackways and impressions is reported from the Wojciechowice Formation of the Holy Cross Mountains located in south- eastern Poland. Alt URL The Wojciechowice Formation is a shallow marine-fed tidal or lagoonal unit that dates to the Eifelian Stage of the Middle Devonian, approximately 395 million years ago based on conodont fossils and previous biostratigraphy on bounding units. The preservation of the track assemblage varies with some clearer tracks preserving finer morphology such as digitation while others are more vague, preserving only an outline. Showing consistency with the aforementioned tracks, these fall into two parallel rows of impressions and show no evidence of body or tail drag.  Interpretation  In addition to these early trackways providing additional evidence of tetrapod activity on land as early as the Devonian, recent work has also been aimed at gleaning biomechanical interpretations from these occurrences. Typically, it is assumed that the earliest tetrapods had a movement pattern very similar to modern amphibians where the entirety of the pectoral and pelvic girdles would swing as the animal moved forward causing the angular pattern seen in these trackways. Although this movement is quite common in animals such as salamanders, recent work has also been done showing similar patterns created by terrestrially locomoting actinopterygian and sarcopterygian fish. In animals such as the actinopterygian cavefish, the alternating footfalls and general layout of the ancient trackways was readily reproduced. Similarly, modern lungfish, a sarcopterygian fish, were shown to be able to produce somewhat similar trackways through axial flexing rather than limb driven locomotion. These studies do not necessarily disprove that these trackways were in fact produced by tetrapods but do at least muddy the interpretation of these trackways. Work by Niedźwiedzki et al., particularly analyzing the trackways from Poland, interprets some of the tracks as being dominated by only two limbs. This \\"ladder-like\\" pattern produces symmetric trackways that imply that one set of limbs is dominating the motion with the other limbs either not supporting as much weight or not being used at all. Recent biomechanical work on Ichthyostega shows support for this showing that the range of motion in the animal's limbs was not capable of the rotation necessary to support an alternating footfall in the gait. Instead, Icthyostega appears to have moved in a manner more akin to the modern mudskipper, lunging forward by pushing its limbs back and then rotating them back into position. The fact that the alternating footfall gait interpreted from the majority of other tracks is not feasible for Icthyostega implies that there are undiscovered early tetrapods with a different limb and girdle configuration than those of the earliest body fossil remains.

After the end of the Cultural Revolution, he was declared a follower of the radical Gang of Four and was dismissed from the government in 1978. He returned to his former life as a factory worker in Tianjin and later became a company manager.  Biography  Sun Jian was born 1936 in rural Dingxing County, Hebei Province. In 1951, he became a worker at the Tianjin Internal Combustion Engine Factory. Starting at the bottom, he was known as a hard worker and rose through the ranks, eventually becoming the party secretary of the factory. During the Cultural Revolution, he was elevated to the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Machinery to serve as vice-director of its Revolutionary Committee in charge of production, and then promoted to (deputy) party secretary of Tianjin in charge of industry. At the 4th National People's Congress in January 1975, Sun, aged 39, was elected as a Vice Premier of the State Council, together with fellow model worker Wu Guixian and peasant leader Chen Yonggui. Sun was made responsible for industrial production, and also became an alternate member of the 10th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The Cultural Revolution ended in 1976 following Mao Zedong's death, and the radical Gang of Four was arrested. Sun stayed in his position for two more years, but was declared a follower of the Gang of Four and purged in the spring of 1978. Sun was sent back to Tianjin, where he underwent \\"supervised reformation\\" at the Tianjin Machinery Factory. When his wife Pang Xiuting (庞秀婷) was allowed to visit him, he promised her that he would not kill himself. He returned to his old life as a factory worker, although he was now a centre of attention for being a former vice-premier. In 1985, the national government gave permission for his promotion to a middle-management position, and Sun was put in charge of a US$5 million German investment in a motorcycle production line in Tianjin. He was later appointed as manager of a state-owned machinery company in the Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area (TEDA). In November 1997, Sun died from lung cancer in Tianjin, at the age of 61.

In its eleven years of operation between 1988 and 1999 it produced 1,500,000 ounces of gold and 900,000 ounces of silver. The mine's two ore bodies are part of the gold-rich Carolina Slate Belt rock package that runs through the upstate Piedmont foothills. The operator of the mine, the Ridgeway Mining Company, is a subdivision of Kennecott Minerals. Kennecott is a subdivision of Rio Tinto which is one of the world's largest mining companies. The mine faced fierce opposition from the local community while applying for permits and licensing from government regulators. These neighbors created Gold Camouflage, a group organized to bring legal and procedural challenges against the mine. Gold Camouflage was unable to stop the mine from opening and eventually settled with the owners. After the mine was exhausted Ridgeway began reclamation of the mine which continues to this day. The mine's waste rock piles were covered with clay and grass to create an artificial hill and water is filling the mine pits to create two artificial lakes. Mine management hopes that one of the lakes will eventually be usable by the public for recreation. Ridgeway mine entrance  Extraction  Two open pits were dug to extract the gold-bearing ore from the earth. Explosives were used to blast the ore out of the bottom of the mine pits. After the blast the loose rocks were hauled in 85-ton trucks to temporary storage heaps near the edge of the pit at surface level. There was roughly one truckload of waste rock hauled out of the pit for every truckload of gold ore and each truckload of gold ore contained only 1.5 to 3 ounces of gold. Ridgeway's gold deposits were microscopic and a complex, multi-step process was needed to refine the heaps of ore into gold bars. A mill was used to crush the ore to an extremely fine powder of 200 mesh. This powder was soaked in a mixture of sodium cyanide, lime and water in one of ten giant tanks. While the powder soaks the tiny flecks of gold within the ore dissolve into the cyanide solution. After twenty-seven days the powder is removed and the remaining solution was filtered through activated charcoal which absorbs the gold out of the liquid in what is called a carbon in leach process. That gold-bearing carbon gets removed from the first solution and was put into a second solution that dissolves the gold for a second time. The second solution was put in a stripping column where high pressure vapor jets through the solution causing the dissolved gold to vaporize. The gold-bearing vapor escapes through the column and was captured and cooled to make a third solution. Once captured the third solution was used in an electrowinning process that uses electricity to deposit the gold out of the solution onto steel wool cathodes. This gold-plated steel wool undergoes a second round of electrowinning to deposit the gold onto stainless steel plates. At this point the gold deposits are thick enough to be mechanically scraped off of the stainless steel plates. The resulting scrapings were fed into a gold crucible and melted into doré bars.  Geology  The Carolina Slate Belt (CSB) originated in the Proterozoic or Cambrian age with a volcanic arc terrane, a chain of volcanoes that form on the edge of one continental plate when it has another continental plate subducted under it. Another subduction of the eastern edge of the ancient North American continental plate (Laurentia) caused the Taconic orogeny and created a new mountain range on the eastern coast of North America. These new mountains eroded over time to form the Piedmont but while they stood their weight was just enough to metamorphose the old volcanic arc rocks into greenschist, a rock produced by some of the lowest metamorphic pressures. The eastern edge of the North American plate continued to be battered by the Avalonia continent, causing the Acadian orogeny, and the ancient African plate (Gondwana), causing the Alleghanian orogeny. These collisions squeezed the CSB, causing it to crack under pressure (shear) and creating intrusive granite from magma seeping up into the cracks. The mine is located in a section of the CSB that trends from east to west. This is unusual for the CSB as it typically trends from northeast to southwest. To the north of the mine is a rock terrane called the Sawney's Creek volcanics and to its south is the Bear Creek turbidites. The Sawney's Creek terrane is older and was formed by volcanic activity. The newer Bear Creek turbidites were made from liquefied sediments that slid into place as part of a landslide. There are two mine pits and the gold ore in each one has its own unique geology. The North Pit's ore is a chert, a rock made from microscopic crystals of quartz that precipitated out of hot water from an underwater geothermal vent. These exhalative sediments need a deep geothermal vent whose water is hot enough to dissolve gold from inside the crust. The hot water precipitates the dissolved minerals onto the ocean floor as fine crystals when it mixes with cold ocean floor water and cools off. A later, epithermal (cooler geothermal vents closer to the surface) process concentrated the gold further by dissolving other minerals surrounding the gold and leaving the gold behind. The South Pit's ore is made from fine sediments of felsic (rich in feldspar and quartz) ash from a volcano that flowed underwater and settled into thin laminated layers.  History  Gold was first found in the Carolina Slate Belt in 1827 at the Haile mine in nearby Lancaster County. Placer mining, hydraulic mining and later use of the Newbery-Vautin chlorination process kept South Carolina mines in operation but by the year 1900 mining became unprofitable and had mostly stopped. In the 1960s interest in mining the Ridgeway area increased after John Chapman found gold while panning in nearby creeks. Amselco Minerals, a company later merged with Kennecott Minerals, began investigating Ridgeway after geologist Irving T. Kiff noticed similarities between Ridgeway's slate outcrops and outcrops at the Haile mine. Kennecott Minerals began buying land for the Ridgeway mine in 1980 and began mining in 1988. For most of its life the Ridgeway Mine was the only active gold mine in the eastern United States. = Public opposition = Some local residents opposed the opening of the mine and formally appealed permits granted by government environmental and land use regulators. As a part of the mine's refining operation waste rock soaked in a cyanide solution was trucked to an outdoor heap where the cyanide solution was allowed to drain off into a settling basin called the tailings pond. The opposition argued that this waste cyanide could potentially leak out of its containment into the groundwater killing aquatic wildlife or poisoning downstream civil water supplies. The tailings pond was also uncovered to allow water to evaporate but also allowing cyanide to enter the atmosphere or wildlife to drink from the contaminated pond. The mine pits were below the water table and dewatering pumps had to be installed to prevent the mine from flooding. These pumps lowered the groundwater levels around the mine and could potentially dry out nearby residential wells. The wastewater from these pumps had to be treated before it could be discharged into local creeks and risked harming the aquatic wildlife in those creeks. There was also opposition to the nuisances of the mine's operation, such as the dust and loud noises that come from blasting and the heavy machinery used to mine. The organized front of the resistance was a group called Gold Camouflage who pursued legal challenges before mine permits were issued and demanded that regulators conduct a further review of the environmental hazards from the mine. Gold Camouflage first appealed to the EPA and the United States Army Corps of Engineers to conduct further studies on the project and halt South Carolina's permit-granting processes but were turned down by both in May and June 1987. On June 10, 1987 the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) issued waste water and air permits to the mine with provisions to protect the thicklip chub in nearby Sawney's Creek. The next day the Land Resources Commission (LRC) granted a permit for the gold mine itself. Both permits had an appeal process, however, and Gold Camouflage pursued appeals against both on grounds of environmental and archaeological concerns. A public debate ensued that summer as both the Ridgeway Mining Company and Gold Camouflage took out full-page ads in the Sunday edition of The State newspaper on July 26. However, on February 26, 1988 Gold Camouflage announced that they had entered a settlement with the mine and DHEC to drop legal opposition to the permits in exchange for increased environmental monitoring of the mine and around $350,000 to cover Gold Camouflage's legal expenses. Some members of Gold Camouflage publicly contested the decision to settle, arguing that the decision was forced through by leadership and lacked popular consent. These members attempted to prevent the LRC from granting the mine a land use permit but were unsuccessful. On April 18, 1988 the LRC's Mining Council ruled to accept the settlement between Gold Camouflage and the Ridgeway Mining Company and issued the mine's final required permit, allowing the gold mine to open. = Accidents = The Ridgeway mine was a relatively safe operation, only killing three employees in eleven years of operation. On August 18, 1988 James F. Wise, while working as a spotter for a pan scraper, was crushed to death when it backed over him. Roosevelt Williams, the scraper driver, was also injured and was sent to the hospital to receive first aid for minor injuries. Scraper drivers were taught to not start the vehicle until eye contact was made with the spotter and to keep the spotter in eyesight while driving. On the day of the accident Williams did not locate the spotter before moving and only watched the left side of the vehicle while backing it out. Wise was crushed under the right tires of the scraper. On April 21, 1993 Johnny Ray fell to his death after he was pushed into the mine pit by a forklift. Steven Crapps, the forklift driver, was attempting to park the forklift by putting it in neutral and engaging the parking brake. However, he also turned off the forklift's engine which provides power to the hydraulic brake system pumps. Without brakes and with a failed backup breaking system the forklift rolled down a slope towards the edge of the mine pit. Ray, the victim, was between the forks of the forklift when it started rolling and was pushed into the pit where he suffered a drop of around 85 feet. Ray was evacuated by helicopter to a local hospital and later died from his injuries. On February 2, 1997 Joseph Sumpter was fatally crushed by a runaway haulage truck. The truck, assigned to Sumpter for the day's work, had a bad battery and starter and had to be jump started by another vehicle. It also had a completely inoperable parking brake. His co-worker, Robert Stover, pulled his truck in front of Sumpter's truck to jump start it. Sumpter climbed across the engine decks of both trucks to connect jumper cables. Sumpter's truck was immobilized with a wooden chock but when Stover parked facing Sumpter's truck he pushed Sumpter's truck backward about two feet behind the chock. The jump start was successful and Stover backed his truck away while Sumpter was still climbing around the engine deck of the truck. Because the trucks were separated Sumpter's truck could now roll forward, continuing to run over the chock and down a hill. Sumpter held on to the engine deck while the truck rolled for around 57 feet, but near the end of the ride Sumpter fell off and was run over by the front wheel of the truck. Sumpter was pronounced dead at the scene. On the weekend of December 3, 1988, soon after the mine began chemically processing the mined ore, a flock of around 400 sea gulls landed in and around the tailings pond and 65 of the seagulls died. Ridgeway Mining had installed scare cannons to prevent birds from landing in the cyanide pond but in this case it was ineffective. The South Carolina Department of Natural Resources levied a $6,500 fine against Ridgeway Mining for killing the birds. = Closure = Mining stopped in the South Pit mine in September 1996 and the North Pit shut down in November 1999. Ore processing finished on December 3, 1999. The Confederate States Mint struck commemorative gold, silver and bronze coins with metal from the mine and sold them to the general public. The coins were marketed as wholly South Carolina gold and featured a local building used by the Confederate army during the American Civil War. The Ridgeway Mining Company also commissioned the Confederate States Mint to mint a coin out of the mine's gold and silver which it gave to the mine employees as gifts.  Reclamation  Ridgeway began the mine reclamation process in 1999 after processing the last of the gold ore from the mine. The mine tailings (waste rock) needed to be contained and the North and South pits had to be flooded. The tailings at the Ridgeway mine are a pyrite-bearing rock which, when exposed to water and oxygen, causes acid rock drainage and environmental damage. Ridgeway designed an impoundment for the tailings that seals them off from both runoff (water) and the atmosphere (oxygen). If fresh water was allowed to run through the tailings it would constantly dissolve and oxidize the rock's sulfides. Ridgeway chose to keep the tailings in stagnant water that has already had a chance to fully saturate with sulfides. The tailing impoundment was created by saturating the tailings with water, mining nearby saprolites and clay, sending the saprolites and clay through the ore mills and pouring them over the existing pile of tailings to create a layer over it. The impoundment was then graded to give it steep sides and a flat top and grass was planted on it to prevent erosion. The Ridgeway mine recovery has been an ecological success with minimal seepage of acid water into the environment, a stark contrast to the nearby Barite Hill and Brewer gold mines that were both declared Superfund sites after being abandoned by their owners. Both mine pits are expected to fill with water by 2020 and the public may be able to access the South Pit Lake. To make the lake safe for public use and to control environmental hazards management hopes to turn it into a meromictic lake, a self-regulated lake with distinct layers of water that do not mix. To see if this was possible the South Pit Lake's physical, chemical and biological properties were measured in a limnology study from 2000 to 2004. The lake successfully achieved meromixis in the winter of 2001 and maintained it until the end of the study in 2004.  Future mining  The Strongbow Exploration company announced that it was investigating a possible new strike of gold within three miles of Rio Tinto's Ridgeway mine in 2011. After releasing several press releases announcing positive test results from drilling samples and the signing of property purchase option agreements with landowners there has been no further communication on their Ridgeway exploration since December 2012.

Don and Connie share their stories about their modest beginnings, which foreshadows Connie potentially appearing again in the series. While Betty is waiting for Trudy Campbell, a well groomed man approaches her and asks about her pregnancy. He says; “I’m going to blame this on martinis” before he requests to touch her stomach. Later, Cooper and Sterling introduce Don and Betty to Henry Francis (Christopher Stanley), the man who touched Betty's stomach. After that introduction, Trudy and Pete show off the Charleston to the guests. They dance to hide their jealousy of the Draper and Crane's talk about their pregnancy process. The Derby Party seems to have a bad ending for Don and Betty as drunken Jane reminds the Drapers of their recent separation. This upsets Betty, and she leaves Don alone with Jane. Roger sees Jane grabbing at Don's waist asking him why he doesn't like her, and sternly asks Don what's going on, then asks for a glass a milk for Jane as if he is dealing with a child. Don tells Roger that no one thinks he's happy, they think he's foolish. The last scene is a shot of Don and Betty sharing a passionate and sincere kiss. The picture shows off their marital happiness, as if they were posing for a magazine.  Cultural references  Sally Draper reads a book to Eugene Hofstadt titled The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, which was published in 1776. He warns her; “You just wait.

In 2015, as part of New York City’s ongoing tribute to “Mad Men\\" at Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center, the show's creator Matthew Weiner. explained the discomfort surrounding the writing, and then shooting, of the scene involving Roger in blackface. Weiner stated, “There was a lot of controversy in the writers’ room. A lot of the writers were like, ‘you can’t do this.’ I was like, ‘Well, I think that season takes place in 1963 and blackface was not removed from the Philadelphia Police Parade until 1968 or something.’ That episode is about white people and what they’re like when they’re alone. We have a very diverse crew, and everyone understood what was happening, that it was a period piece, and it was not pleasurable for anyone. It was so well established that this was a part of the framework of that time, and it was so clear that we were criticizing it, but we had to live through doing it to criticize it.”  Reception  The episode had a viewership of 1.608 million, which revealed growth in viewership compared to the previous season's third episode. The episode was the most watched program of the week. The demographic was between the ages of 18–49. Critical Reception for “My Old Kentucky Home” was critically acclaimed by many. Keith Phillips of The A.V. Club gave the episode an “A-”. He mentioned he was at a loss of words and in shock for several of the scenes. He especially pointed to the scene where Roger performs in blackface, as well as when Betty's stomach is touched by Henry Francis, which left Phillips thinking that Henry would appear in future episodes. TV critic, Alan Sepinwall, responded with, “‘My Old Kentucky Home' is one of those Mad Men episodes where very little seems to happen in terms of story, but where the atmosphere and character work are both so rich that plot becomes irrelevant.” Sepinwall continued by saying he too was shocked with a few scenes, and also had hopes for Carla to be more involved in the season, since Carla has a unique perspective of the family. Other reviewers commented similarly, responding with similar reactions to the episode, but overall enjoyed the episode.  Production  Series creator and executive producer, Matthew Weiner, wrote “My Old Kentucky Home” with Dahvi Waller. In an interview Matthew Weiner did with AMC, he revealed his vision and thoughts about important moments from the episode. He mentioned how the episode was shown in three parties; the different ages, classes, as well as who belongs where. In regards to Peggy's character in this episode, she is shown smoking marijuana, but production chose not make the character look or act high. Instead, Peggy's confidence is revealed. In Joan and Greg's party, they are seen for the first time since the incident that occurred in season two, showing that not only has she not left him, but is going to host a party for Greg. While the guests are over, it is mentioned that Greg has lost a patient, which Joan is unaware of. Instead of speaking about it further, Greg has Joan perform to win his guests over. Mathew wanted to emphasize the fact that Greg having Joan perform could been seen as a loving act, but it could also be interpreted as controlling. Weiner stated; “And the fact that he is keeping this appearance up to help himself, to cover for his own inadequacies, is very painful.” When the show's writers asked Christina Hendricks whether she could play the piano she told them of her accordion skill, which they incorporated into the story. Weiner also wanted to highlight the fact that Don and Roger have different views on life. Don is not very understanding about Roger's choices, and seems to feel out of place at Roger's party. Regarding Don and Betty's relationship, Weiner wanted to highlight on their marital status, and how even by the very end of the episode, after Betty has gotten hit on and Don noticing how in love Roger and Jane are, Betty and Don kiss. Although they kiss, they seem to be both kissing other people. Weiner wanted to reveal how Betty and Don want something else in this episode.

Falcao, Jorge Stolfi, and Roberto de Alencar Lotufo have created and proven that the Image Foresting Transform (IFT) can be used as a time saver in processing 2-D, 3-D images, and moving images.Falcao, A.X.

Bellman, “On a Routing Problem,” Quarterly of Applied Math., vol. 16, pp. 87-90, 1958 that computed the cost of the paths in a general graph. The Bucket sorting technique is how Dial improved on the algorithm a decade later.R.B. Dial, “Shortest-Path Forest with Topological Ordering,” Comm. ACM, vol. 12, no. 11, pp. 632-633, Nov. 1969 The algorithm has been tweaked and modified in many ways since then. It is on this version that Falcao, Stolfi, and Lotufo improved upon. Definition  The transform is a tweaked version of Dijkstra’s shortest-path algorithm that is optimized for using more than one input and the maximization of digital image processing operators. The transform makes a graph of the pixels in an image and the connections between these points are the \\"cost\\" of the path portrayed. The cost is calculated by inspecting the characteristics, for example grey scale, color, gradient among many others, of the path between pixels. Trees are made by connecting the pixels that have the same or close cost for applying the operator decided upon. The robustness of the transform does come at a cost and uses a lot of storage space for the code and the data being processed. When the transform is through, the predecessor, cost, and label are returned. Most of the operators that are used for digital image processing can use these three pieces of information to be optimized. Optimization  Depending on which digital image processing operator that has been decided upon the algorithm can be further tweaked for optimization depending upon what that operator uses. The algorithm can also be optimized by cutting out the recalculation of paths. This is accomplished by using an external reference table to keep track of the calculated paths. \\"Backward Arcs\\" can be eliminated by comparing the cost of the path in both directions and eliminating the more expensive path. There is also a case where the algorithm returns infinity for some of the paths. In this case a threshold number can be set to replace infinity, or the path will be eliminated and not used in further calculations.

History The history of Italian immigrants in Panama begins from 1510, when several Italian citizens decided to emigrate to Panama City founded by Pedrarias Davila. The \\"Casa de los Genoveses\\" (house of Genoans) in Panama Viejo From 1520 some Genovese merchants ruled the commerce of Old Panama (Panamá Viejo) on the Pacific Ocean for a centuryPanama Viejo. Between 1596 and 1597 already there were 11 Italians in Panama, for naturalization and the right to stay in Panama. According to a census around 1607, Panama City had 548 inhabitants (some of them descendants of the first Genoese settlers), of whom 53 were foreigners and of these 18 were Italians, 6 of which were domiciled by the composition of foreigners. After de independence, the Italian presence continued to emphasize immigrants such as Agostino Codazzi and Napoleone Garella, who in the nineteenth century and at different times, performed studies that recommended Panama as the ideal for the construction of an interoceanic canal. Meanwhile, in 1844, Garella was the first engineer assigned by the French government to find a route for the construction of the Canal and in his studies recommended the route of the isthmus of Panama over the routes suggested by the isthmus of Tehuantepec and Nicaragua. During the isthmus canal project and construction continued to arrive eminent Italians from scientists, artists, priests and merchants, to craftsmen and laborers. They founded families whose descendants were quickly integrated the dynamic process of formation of the Panamanian nationality. One was elected President of Panama in 1949 and 1960: Roberto Francisco Chiari Remón (March 2, 1905 in Panama City – March 1, 1981) was the President of Panama in 1949 and later from 1960 to 1964. He belonged to the Liberal Party. In the 1920s even his father (Rodolfo Chiari) was president. The Italo-Panamanian Nicolás Ardito Barletta Vallarino, President of Panama in 1984-1985 The wave of Italian immigration occurred around 1880. With the construction of the Canal by the Universal Panama Canal Company came the arrival of up to 2,000 Italians. Two years later in 1882, at the initiative of Mr. Oreste Badio (a prominent member of the Italian colony), the \\"Italian Benevolent Society\\" was established in order to help the countrymen affected by disease or who needed some kind of help, with an initial membership of 37 persons. To this migration belongs the ancestors of another Panamanian president: Nicolás Ardito Barletta Vallarino (born August 21, 1938, in Aguadulce, in the province of Coclé) was President of Panama from October 11, 1984, to September 28, 1985Biography of president N. Ardito Barletta. The President Barletta Vallarino belonged to the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD). Ricardo Martinelli Ricardo Martinelli served as president from 2009 through 2014, during which time the Panamanian economy grew robustly and steadily. His achievements were even lauded by The Economist: \\"Though it lies in Central America, the poorest and most violent region in the West, the country’s 3.6m citizens are now richer than most Latin Americans.\\" Indeed, Martinelli - during his five-year presidential mandate - promoted a huge urban development of Panama city, with the construction of some of the tallest skyscrapers in Latin America. Another Italo-Panamanian, Alberto Motta, has successfully created companies in Panama and with a \\"Fundacion\\" is helping the poorest PanamaniansFundacion Alberto Motta. Actually there it is an agreement/treaty between the Italian and Panamanian governments, that facilitates since 1966 the Italian immigration to Panama for investmentsLittle known Treaty In 2017 the Italians residents are nearly 3900, while about 10% of Panama inhabitants are white (of whom nearly one fourth are descendants of Italians). In other words: of the total population of Panama that was of about 4 million in that year, approximately 400,000 are white and the descendants of Italians are nearly 100,000.

It is sometimes considered a spiritual successor to the 1991 title Creepy Castle, which the game's head of technology William Appleton had previously written for Reactor Inc. Skull Cracker was conceptually designed by Ben Calica.  Development  After the release of Titanic: Adventure Out of Time, Cyberflix released this old project which had been sitting in the vaults for a few years. The game was demoed on October 28, 1995 at the Double Tree Hotel (Crowne Plaza) in Rockville. It also previewed at the 1994 Summer Consumer Electronics Show along with other Cyberflix games, presented by Paramount.  Plot and gameplay  The developers described it as an \\"old- fashioned side-scrolling arcade game\\". The game sees the player battle through 16 levels of the undead and monsters. The game contains 50s-style monsters and 90s-style urban grit.  Critical reception  GameSpot offered a scathing review, panning the title's \\"bad art, poor animation, limited controls, no decent action, lame gameplay\\". MacLedge felt the game was a letdown from Cyberflix's previous work. Inside Mac Games praised the title's intriguing storyline, witty humor and exciting gameplay. Cyberflix head Scott Scheinbaum would later say \\"Every company makes mistakes, and that was ours...It should have come out a year and a half before it did\\", noting that 1994 technology seemed stale by 1996.

Drosera hookeri is found in south-eastern Australia. Although the holotype was collected in Tasmania, its distribution also includes Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia. This species has a complex taxonomic history, and its specific epithet acknowledges the original recognition of the taxon by Joseph Dalton Hooker. Hooker originally called his species Drosera foliosa Hook.f. ex Planch. in 1848, a name that was illegitimate as it had previously been used to describe a different species (Drosera foliosa Elliott 1824). The nomenclature of D. hookeri was later clarified and the taxonomic concept significantly broadened to include most of the south-eastern Australian and New Zealand forms of the species complex that includes Drosera peltata. Like other tuber sundews, D. hookeri aestivates as an underground tuber to survive summer drought.  Description  Drosera hookeri flower buds Drosera hookeri is a perennial tuberous herb. Its underground tuber is white and generally found 2 – 5 cm under the soil surface. Its aerial parts range from 5 – 10 cm in height, normally yellow-green to distinctly yellow in colour. Drosera hookeri has a well-developed rosette of lunate to semi-orbicular leaves at the soil surface, as well as lunate cauline leaves. The aerial stem is normally branched multiple times from the base of the plant. Flowers are white, and can appear very close to the basal leaf rosette. The seeds are black and cylindrical.  Habitat and distribution  Drosera hookeri is typically a plant of winter- wet, summer-dry grasslands and grassy woodlands. It frequently co-occurs with other species in the D. peltata complex.

The conservation park consists of the following crown land in the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Tatiara which previously was the “former parklands and closed road reserves on the western and southern sides” of the town of Wolseley - Allotment 100 of DP 53044, Allotment 1 of DP 55986, Allotments 50, 51 and 52 of DP 28840, Pieces 20 and 21 of FP 218022, and Section 1013. It is divided into two parts by the alignment of West Terrace and its continuation as Teatrick Road to the south-west. It came into existence on 29 November 2001 by proclamation under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 to protect both “the nationally threatened Buloke Woodland” which is “one of the last remaining in South Australia” and the “plant and fauna species of conservation significance” located within its boundaries. As of 2016, it covered an area of . The land within the conservation park was part of the parklands around the town of Wolseley (then known as Tatiara) proclaimed on 8 May 1884. The parklands had a history of being used for “depasturing animals, firewood gathering and rubbish dumping.” During World War 2, part of the land in the western parkland was cleared to create a “sports oval” with a cycling and running track on its perimeter. By the 1960s, the land now under protection “was reported to have been reduced to bare ground with only a few scattered Buloke trees…” However, the decline of Wolseley as a railway town reduced the above-mentioned impacts on the land with the subsequent regeneration of the native vegetation. In 2006, the conservation park was described as follows: # It has an “intact remnant of Buloke (Allocasuarina luehmannii) Low Woodland” with an understorey which “retains a high diversity of native grasses, sedges and herbaceous species” and was considered to be “the best example of a remaining pure Buloke Low Woodland ecosystem on gilgai soil in South Australia.” # It had “at least 68 native plant species” of which eleven species were listed as threatened under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972. #It had “at least 30 bird species” including the following seven species having “a conservation rating within the South East region” - yellow thornbill (Acanthiza nana modesta), white-winged chough (Corcorax melanorhamphos whitaea), red-capped robin (Petroica goodenovii), collared sparrowhawk (Accipiter cirrhocephalus), sulphur-crested cockatoo (Cacatua galerita) and long-billed corella (Cacatua tenuirostris). # It had six reptile species including the Olive Snake-lizard (Delma inornata) which is listed as rare in South Australia. #The only native mammal recorded to date is the Fat-tailed dunnart (Sminthopsis crassicaudata). As of 2006, visitation was limited to ‘casual’ use by low residents. The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category III protected area.

It has also been cataloged as World Music. According to the specialized critics they have been called as popular musicians for refined and demanding listeners.  History  In October 1997 they made their first concert at the Teatro Universidad de Chile. Then the label Mundo Vivo proposes the recording of the first album, a project that took form in March 1998. The year 1998 culminates with three important recognitions: The SCD (Chilean Copyright Society) grants Entrama the award -now recognized as Pulsar- for the interpretation as Best Group in the Jazz Fusión genre; and two of its members: Juan Antonio Sánchez and Manuel Meriño, are awarded as the best composer and best acoustic guitar player, respectively. In 1999 Entrama composes the incidental music for the documentary about the work of the Chilean painter Roberto Matta, entitled \\"A century of mind\\", interview that was made by the Chilean intellectual Volodia Teitelboim. In 2001 they obtained a Fondart (Fund for the Development of Culture and the Arts) to finance the production of his second record material and thus originates Centro, album that remains in the same instrumental line that characterizes them.http://www.musicapopular.cl/grupo/entrama/ During 2003 they perform a Concert with the Symphony Orchestra of the Universidad de Concepción, where they present orchestral arrangements of compositions belonging to their two previous recordings: Entrama and Centro. This experience gave rise to his third record production entitled Simbólico \\"Symbolic\\", published in April 2005 thanks to the support of Fondart and which constitutes an important moment for the musical development for the group as it proposes a new format that enhances the sound possibilities of the group when inserted in a symphonic context.http://www.musicapopular.cl/grupo/entrama/ In May 2012 they present their new album Año luz (light year) after seven years without producing a record. The album features 2 songs, for the first time with voices with lyrics, and a major use of piano than the previous albums. They have made international tours to Canada (2006), Perú (2011), and Argentina (2014).http://www.mundo-vivo.com/es/entrama-celebra-sus-20-anos/ The depth of Entrama’s musical and instrumental quest makes possible the creation of a musical weave (as the word ‘Entrama’ implies) whose threads transform this music band in a bridge between Latin-American folk, popular, classical, jazz, and world music.http://www.danielpearlmusicdays.org/artist_detail.php?id=1829  Influences  Among his main influences are Congreso, Víctor Jara, Inti- Illimani, Violeta Parra, Los Jaivas, Horacio Salinas, Tilo González, Roberto Márquez, Antonio Restucci, Luis Advis, Latinomusicaviva, Silvio Rodríguez, Leo Brouwer, Egberto Gismonti, Hermeto Pascoal, Heitor Villa-Lobos, Chico Buarque, Caetano Veloso, Jacques Morelembaum, Astor Piazzolla, Flairck, Ralph Towner, Pat Metheny, Paco de Lucía, Dino Saluzzi, Gurrufío, Editus, The Beatles, Sting, Bach, Satie, Ravel, Stravinsky, and many more.http://www.danielpearlmusicdays.org/artist_detail.php?id=1829  Members  = Current = * Pedro Suau, (1997–present) direction, quena, flute, zampoña and tarka * Rodrigo Durán, (1997–present) cello * Carlos Basilio, (1997–present) percussion * Daniel Delgado, (1998–present) guitar, percussion and accordion * Marcelo Arenas, (2000–present) batería * Guillermo Correa, (2001–present) guitar and mandolin * Sebastián Iglesias, (2001–present) bass * Juan Antonio Sanchez (1997–2001, 2017–present) guitar = Past = * Manuel Meriño, (1997–2001) guitarra * Ítalo Pedrotti, (1997–2006) charango * Pedro Melo, (1997–2014) bajo, flauta, teclado  Discography  * Entrama (Mundovivo 1998), * Centro (Prod.

Time 1 followed by time 3 is the length of a solar day or a sol. Sol (borrowed from the Latin word for sun) is a solar day on Mars; that is, a Mars-day. A sol is the apparent interval between two successive returns of the Sun to the same meridian (sundial time) as seen by an observer on Mars. It is one of several units for timekeeping on Mars. A sol is slightly longer than an Earth day. It is approximately 24 hours, 39 minutes, 35 seconds long. A Martian year is approximately 668 sols, equivalent to approximately 687 Earth days. The sol was originally adopted in 1976 during the Viking Lander missions and is a measure of time mainly used by NASA when, for example, scheduling the use of the Mars rover.  Length  The average duration of the day-night cycle on Mars — i.e., a Martian day — is 24 hours, 39 minutes and 35.244 seconds, equivalent to 1.02749125 Earth days. The sidereal rotational period of Mars—its rotation compared to the fixed stars—is only 24 hours, 37 minutes and 22.66 seconds. The solar day lasts slightly longer because of its orbit around the sun which requires it to turn slightly further on its axis. Usage in Mars lander timekeeping When a spacecraft lander begins operations on Mars, the passing Martian days (sols) have been tracked using a simple numerical count. The two Viking lander missions, Mars Phoenix, Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity, and InSight counted the sol on which each lander touched down as \\"Sol 0\\". It is expected that the Perseverance rover mission will also count the sol of touchdown as \\"Sol 0\\". Mars Pathfinder and the two Mars Exploration Rovers instead defined touchdown as \\"Sol 1\\". Generally speaking, the choice between counting from Sol 0 or Sol 1 has been made so that Sol 1 would be the first sol with \\"meaningful\\" or \\"useful\\" lander operations. Thus, landers that touched down late in the Martian day have begun their sol count at 0, while those that touch down early in the day began their count at 1. Although lander missions have twice occurred in pairs, no effort was made to synchronize the sol counts of the two landers within each pair. Thus, for example, although Spirit and Opportunity were sent to operate simultaneously on Mars, each counted its landing date as \\"Sol 1\\", putting their calendars approximately 21 sols out of sync. Terminology The word \\"yestersol\\" was coined by the NASA Mars operations team early during the MER mission to refer to the previous sol (the Mars version of \\"yesterday\\"), and came into fairly wide use within that organization during the Mars Exploration Rover Mission of 2003. It was eventually picked up and used by the press. Other neologisms include \\"tosol\\" (for \\"today\\" on Mars), as well as one of three Mars versions of \\"tomorrow\\": \\"nextersol\\", \\"morrowsol\\", or \\"solmorrow\\". NASA planners coined the term \\"soliday\\" at least as far back as 2012 to refer to days off due to time phasing or the synching of planetary schedules.  Conversion  Considering a possible colonization of Mars, one question that arose was \\"how does one convert a Sol to standard Earth time?\\" In the science fiction series Mars trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson, the Mars settlers use traditional Earth watches that stop ticking at midnight for 39 minutes and 40 seconds before resuming their timekeeping. This creates something like a \\"witching hour\\" which compensates for the time difference between a Sol and an Earth day. This follows the method previously given by Philip K. Dick in his novel Martian Time-Slip. An alternative idea was suggested in 1988 by David Powell (the Davidian Mars calendar). In this case the clocks simply run slower than the ones on Earth so that their hour hands complete two cycles per one Sol. For example, 1 Mars-second is 1.027 Earth-seconds, 1 Mars-minute is 61.62 Earth-seconds, and 1 Mars-hour is 61 minutes and 36.968 Earth-seconds. NASA once commissioned custom watches using this method. An alternative method is to maintain the SI second, but divide it into different forms. Rounded to the nearest whole second, there are 88775 SI seconds in a sol; 88775 factorizes into 5×5×53×67. 53 and 67, both prime numbers, are reasonably close to 60, the standard sexagesimal division of seconds per minute and minutes per hour, while 5×5=25, a number close to the 24 hours in a day on Earth. Thus, a system with 25-hour sols could use a 67-minute/53-second system, or a 53-minute/67-second system. Either system would require frequent leap seconds (one approximately every four sols) to maintain synchronization with Mars's rotation.

He is presently the dean of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School and executive vice president for academic affairs and provost of UT Southwestern Medical Center. Lee focuses on translational research on immune modulation for vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) and the implementation of protocols to minimize immunosuppression in hand transplant and other VCA programs. Early life and education Lee was born in the town of Gangshan in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, where his father was serving in the Republic of China Air Force. He immigrated to the United States at the age of 15 to join his siblings. He followed his siblings to different towns due to their job re-location, and went to three high schools in three years while adapting to his new country and learning a new language. Lee graduated with honors from Harvard College in 1979 with a bachelor's degree in physics. He received his medical degree from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, where he also completed his general surgery residency. He received plastic surgery training at the Massachusetts General Hospital and completed his orthopedic hand fellowship at the Indiana Hand to Shoulder Center. In 1991, he joined the academic faculty at Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, where he became the Director of Plastic Surgery Research Laboratory and Chief of Hand Service in Department of Surgery.  Career  In 2002, Lee was named the division chief of plastic surgery at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. In 2010, he moved to Johns Hopkins Hospital to become the inaugural chairman of the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. From 2010 to 2019, he was the Milton T. Edgerton, M.D., Professor and Chairman of the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Johns Hopkins. He chaired the Associate Professor Promotion Committee of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine from 2014 to 2017 and was Chair of the Medical Board from 2016 to 2018.

Research  Lee with Bonnie Amos, Brendan Marrocco, and Commandant of the Marine Corps James Amos in 2013. A hand surgeon and translational researcher, Lee investigates tolerance strategy for vascularized composite allografts (VCA) to ameliorate the need for long- term systemic immunosuppression. He has been principal investigator on numerous federal research grants totaling over $10 million. Lee established multidisciplinary programs for hand transplantation at Johns Hopkins and the University of Pittsburgh using an immunomodulatory protocol based upon the work from his laboratory. He led the surgical team that performed the first bilateral hand transplant (2009) and the first trans-humeral transplant (2010) in the United States. A key feature of the protocol is single-agent immunosuppression that aims to minimize the long-term risks of VCA. He has led one of the largest hand and arm transplant programs in the field, and his group was especially focused on restoring functions to military servicemen with upper extremity amputations that resulted from combat injuries. In March 2018, Lee oversaw the team that performed the world's first total penis and scrotum transplant. The operation included transplants of the penis, scrotum, and abdominal wall to a wounded serviceman and was the most complex surgery of its type. Lee has authored about 230 original peer-reviewed publications and 40 textbook chapters and co-edited the book Transplantation of Composite Tissue Allografts, (2008). He has served on the editorial boards of Transplantation, Journal of Surgical Research' and Hand. He co-founded Vascularized Composite Allo-transplantation in 2014 and serves as its co- Editor.

In February 2019, SPHEREx was selected by NASA for its next Medium-Class Explorers mission, beating out two competing mission concepts: Arcus and FINESSE. As of September 2020, SPHEREx is targeted to launch on 17 June 2024. The principal investigator is James Bock at Caltech in Pasadena, California.  Overview  SPHEREx will use a spectrophotometer to perform an all-sky survey that will measure near-infrared spectra from 0.75 to 5.0 micrometers. It will employ a single instrument with a single observing mode and no moving parts to map the entire sky four times during its nominal 25-month mission; the crucial technology is a linear variable filter. It will classify galaxies according to redshift accuracy, categorizing approximately 450 million galaxies and fitting measured spectra to a library of galaxy templates. Specifically, SPHEREx will probe signals from the intra-halo light and from the epoch of reionization. It would explore what drove the early universe inflation, explore the origin and history of galaxies, and explore the origin of water in planetary systems.Missions to probe exoplanets, galaxies, and cosmic inflation vie for $250 million NASA slot. Daniel Clery, Science Magazine, 16 August 2017Proposed Astrophysics Mission to Conduct the First Infrared Spectral Survey of the Entire Sky 27 August 2017 SPHEREx will complement planned Euclid and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope spectroscopic surveys. High precision redshift information of foreground galaxies provided by SPHEREx in correspondence with weak gravitational lensing measurements of background galaxies from Euclid and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will allow a for a direct measurement of the dark matter distribution surrounding the foreground galaxies. Although, the SPHEREx low redshift survey allows its measurement of inflationary parameters to be mostly independent to provide a new line of evidence. The telescope lens will have a diameter of 20 centimeters with a 3.5° x 11° field of view and six 2k x 2k mercury cadmium telluride (HgCdTe) photodetector arrays.

SPHEREx, Caltech. The detailed concept study report was submitted to NASA on 19 July 2016, but it was not selected for SMEX. An enhanced version of SPHEREx was submitted on 15 December 2016 as a Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX), and it was selected as a finalist in August 2017, along two other competing missions: Arcus, and Fast Infrared Exoplanet Spectroscopy Survey Explorer (FINESSE). Each team received US$2 million to refine their mission concepts over nine-months. SPHEREx was selected as the winner in February 2019, and the mission has been given the green light to proceed with construction and launch. The launch is currently targeted for June 2024. Medium-Class Explorer mission costs are capped at US$250 million, not including the launch vehicle. As of April 2020, the preliminary total cost of the mission is approximately US$395 million to US$427 million.

Born in Geelong, Victoria, Robertson volunteered for service with the Australian Imperial Force in the First World War. He served on the Western Front as a non-commissioned officer. On return to Australia he went back to work, including in his grandfather's timber company. He joined the 23rd Battalion (The City of Geelong Regiment). At the onset of the Great Depression he lost his job but managed to survive and then succeed selling fuel. The 23rd and 21st (Victorian Rangers) Battalions were merged in 1929 to become the 23rd/21st Battalion as the number of recruits available had dwindled. At the outbreak of the Second World War, Robertson, who was second in command of the 23rd/21st Battalion at the time, was asked to raise and command the newly formed 2/29th Battalion. After training at Bonegilla and Bathurst, the 2/29th Battalion was sent to Malaya via Singapore. The battalion was based mostly around the Segamat area of Johore State, Malaya (now Malaysia) until 17 January 1942 when it was deployed to the Bakri crossroads area south of the Muar River, to push back the advancing Japanese forces. Robertson died from gunshot wounds and other injuries when he fell off a motorbike after returning to his battalion from a brigade conference on Sunday 18 January 1942.

A notice on page 2 of The Age (Melbourne) in 1932 refers to the sale of Pettitt Robertson's stock.The Age (Melbourne), 17 September 1932 Robertson lost his job at a critical point in his life with a very young family. Robertson was forced to move out of the family home he had built. He found work heaving bails of wool in the wool stores and driving an ice truck. Eventually, with the help of his father-in-law Alexander Aikman, he started selling wood from a house with a vacant block in Chilwell. As a result of the economic depression and the dwindling number of voluntary recruits after compulsory training ceased, the 23rd (Geelong) and 21st (Victorian Rangers) Battalions were merged in 1929 to become the 23rd/21st Battalion, known commonly as the City of Geelong Regiment or the Victorian Rangers.Grey 2008, p. 138Keogh 1965, p. 44 In 1932, Robertson was top of his 21A Course under Major Pain of 4th Division.

General Bennett established his headquarters at Johore Bahru on 29 August 1941 and the 22nd Brigade replaced the 12th Indian Brigade in the Mersing-Endau area, where it was considered adequate defences needed to be prepared in light of the strategic importance of roads and airfields from that area across to Kluang just off the main north/south highway. The planned strategy was that, in case of a Japanese attack on the east coast, the 22nd Brigade would defend the coast at Mersing with the 2/18th and 2/20th Battalions (less one company), leaving the 2/19th in reserve at Jemaluang. A company of the 2/20th would be posted at Endau, with companies from the 2/18th and 2/19th at Sedili Besar. In the event of war, the 2/26th Battalion of the 27th Brigade would protect the road north of Sedili Besar. The 2/30th would be a mobile unit located near the Jemaluang junction, and the 2/29th would be responsible for the Bukit Langkap iron mine area and the airfields at Kahang and Kluang. On Monday 15 September 1941, the 2/29th moved from Singapore to the Segamat area (including Kluang, Kahang, Buloh Kasap and Jemaluang) where it would be based, train and prepare to defend.Bennett, 1944Wigmore, 1957, pp. 98–99 The Reverend Hamilton Aiken of Ipoh made a home movie of the 2/29th marching and conducting other training activities at Segamat on 11 October 1941.

In the first few days of January 1942, General Bennett outlined a plan to defend Johore State following the withdrawal of British and Indian forces from the north of the country. He recommended that the Muar River line be defended by the newly arrived 45th Indian Brigade and that the 22nd Brigade located on the east coast should be replaced by an Indian Brigade and moved to western Johore.Bennett, pages 70, 89, 91.Wigmore, pages 168, 182, 198 On 8 January 1942, General Bennett ordered the 2/30th (Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Galleghan), 2/26th (Lt Col Boyes) and 2/29th (Lt Col Robertson) back to Segamat to prepare for an ambush of the Japanese 5th Regiment at the Gemencheh Bridge near Gemas.Bennett, 1944, p. 104. Lt Col Galleghan, Brigadier Maxwell, Lt Col Boyes and Lt Col Robertson in December 1941. The poorly trained 45th Indian Brigade under Brigadier Duncan arrived in Malaya on 11 January, the day that Japanese forces occupied Kuala Lumpur. It located its HQ at the 99.5 mile post on the road between Parit Sulong and Muar south of the Bakri crossroads. Its role was to defend Muar and the river hinterland area. Its ability to do so was in doubt even by senior Indian Army (British) officers.Wigmore, pages 189, 192. Percival, Chapter 14.Bennett, 1944, p. 104. By the morning of Monday 12 January, the 2/29th Battalion (less C and D Companies) was at Buloh Kasap, a small village on the Muar River about half way between Segamat and Batu Anam. Although not recorded in the War Diary, this would suggest that the battalion continued its movement from Tenang towards and then past Segamat during Sunday 11 January. Bennett met Maxwell and his three Battalion Commanders (Boyes, Robertson, and Galleghan) at Maxwell's headquarters on 12 January.Bennett, 1944, p. 107 On the morning of 13 January, Robertson, the Adjutant (Morgan), the Intelligence Officer (Wastell), and the 2/29th’s A and B Company Commanders reconnoitred the area up to five miles north of Gemas.

The brigade’s 5/18th Royal Garhwal Rifles was located just north of the Bakri crossroads, with one company at Simpang Jeram further down the road towards Muar.Wigmore, 1957, p. 222Whitelocke, 1983, pp. 79–80Coates, 2004, p. 208Lodge, 1986, p. 90 and pp. 110–113 During the afternoon of 15 January and overnight, the Japanese Imperial Guards 5th Regiment with the Gotanda Medium Tank Company overran the two companies of the 7/6th Rajputana Rifles further east on the northern bank of the river. The regiment crossed the river upstream and quickly moved towards Simpang Jeram, pushing the company of the 5/18th Royal Garhwal Rifles back towards the Bakri crossroads. Japanese troops from the 4th Regiment in small coastal craft travelled by sea down the coast, coming ashore at Parit Jawa and Batu Pahat in an encircling action designed to cut the road from Muar to Yong Peng.Lodge, 1986, p. 91Tsuji, 1960, p. 230)Farrell & Pratten, 2009, p. 167 Bennett received reports that a small Japanese force with upwards of 200 men had broken through the defences at Muar.Wigmore, 1957, pp. 224–225Lodge, 1986, p. 91Bennett, 1944, p. 124 After receiving further reports of the incursion, he ordered Robertson's 2/29th Battalion along with a troop of carriers and a combined section of anti-tank gunners to the area north of the Bakri crossroads on Saturday 17 January 1942 and push the Japanese forces the next morning Sunday 18 January 1942.Bennett, 1944, pp. 125–127 Various sources including the Battalion’s official history claim that John was ‘medically boarded’ around this time and about to be sent home to Australia. These sources allege that John 'pleaded with Bennett to be allowed to take his Battalion into action for the first time and that his request was granted on the understanding that he would be relieved at the end of 24 hours'. There is no evidence to support these allegations. Neither his service file (accessible via the National Archives Records Search) nor his medical history file (accessed in early 2019) make any mention of the subject.Bowring, 1954, pp. 2–3Christie, 1983, p. 45 The battalion – less its D Company and a platoon from A Company – arrived in the area and deployed in a rubber plantation on a straight stretch of road around the 101 mile post, replacing the Indian Garhwalis at that location.

Both sides tested each other's positions that night. The 2/29th's front C and B Companies came under attack as the Japanese launched frontal 'holding' attacks designed to draw fire, identify the opposing side and distract from outflanking activity.Farrell & Pratten, 2009, p. 170Wigmore, 1954, p. 133 The 2/29th Battalion War Diary includes a secret report accessible at the time only to officers, indicating that it was aware of the potential for both tanks and flanking activity. It was warned to avoid remaining in fixed defensive positions (which they subsequently maintained, possibly to await the arrival of the Jats).https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/C1360933 AWM 2/29th Battalion War Diary It may not have realised, however, that the frontal attacks were deliberate tactics designed to distract from flanking activity through what seemed like impenetrable jungle to its west.For example, see Technical Manual – Handbook on Japanese Military Forces (TM-E 30–480), Chapter III, Field Organisation 15 September 1944 Early on Sunday morning, nine tanks drove down the road towards and through the 2/29th Battalion position.

The battalion arrived at the 45th Indian Brigade HQ at the 99.5 mile peg at around 0930 hours. Anderson reported to Brigade HQ at 0945 hours, noting that ‘owing to a breakdown of comms [communications] the tactical position was not very clear’.https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/C1361035 Australian War Memorial – 2/19th Battalion War Diary Robertson was probably sufficiently confident with the success of the ambush to head off to Brigade HQ at the 99.5 mile peg to join a conference at Brigade HQ, leaving in time to arrive there at 1000 hours.https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/C1361035 Australian War Memorial – 2/19th Battalion War Diary Communications with Brigade HQ were probably cut at around this time. Soon after 1000 hours, Japanese infantry, including ‘a couple of hundred’ troops on bicycles, advanced towards B and C Companies with machine gunners in front – likely another distracting action. Dozens of Japanese were reportedly killed in this attack.Bowring, 1954, pp. 2–3 A small number of Japanese soldiers had managed to infiltrate unnoticed between the 2/29th and 2/19th Battalions, including on a slight bend in the road on the other side from the swamp. On his return from the conference at Brigade HQ riding as a pillion passenger on a motorbike, Robertson was shot at by Japanese soldiers from the side of the road. Robertson fell off the back of the motorbike within 100 or 200 yards of Battalion HQ. The Despatch Rider, VX36113 Private Sydney Thomas Bauckham made it back to the battalion, with one arm wounded, and ‘a strained smile on his face’. Upon learning of the situation, Sergeant Wedlick and Captain Gahan took an armoured carrier to where Robertson had fallen off and brought him back in.Christie, 1983, p. 66Geelong Advertiser 21 January 1942 Claims stating that Robertson was travelling from his battalion to the conference are not supported by the evidence contained in the 2/19th and 2/29th War Diaries. Robertson was seriously wounded, having been hit by at least one bullet in the knee or thigh and likely with critical head injuries received when he fell off the motorcycle. Consistent with the photographer’s account reported three days later, Captain Brand stated that after arrival at the RAP, Robertson ‘was lifted out of the carrier, badly wounded and only partly conscious. Half an hour later he quietly died’.Christie, 1983, p. 66 Captain Bowring (who was not near the RAP at the time) stated in his account that Robertson ‘died from loss of blood and shock half-an-hour later’.Bowring, 1954, pp. 2–3 The 2/29th Battalion's War Diary noted that ‘he died a few minutes after reaching HQ’.

Padre Macneil also wrote to Dorothy on 28 January 1942. He stated that, [Robertson] '... was shot by Japs while running the gauntlet back to the Unit from Brigade H.Q. on the back of a motor bike. It was a probable risk and he took it willingly. ... [he] rose to the occasion and had the satisfaction of leading the battalion bravely and skillfully in their first really heavy action.' ... He retained a deep sympathy with and understanding of the men right through. They respected and liked him. ... He was facing battle bravely and I shook hands as we parted.' Brigadier Maxwell's letter to Dorothy, dated 2 February 1942, stated that [Robertson] 'had endeared himself to us all, and personally after our close association of the last six months, he and I had become personal friends. ... He had been discussing the situation with a senior member of the staff, and was moving forward again, on the back of a motor bicycle [sic] to his leading troops, when he was shot and killed. ...

Colding, 344 U.S. 590 (1953), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a lawful permanent resident, who departs from and returns to the country as a seaman on an American ship, retains procedural due process rights and cannot be deported under 8 CFR § 175.57(b) without a hearing.. Background Kwong Hai Chew was a Chinese seaman who was admitted to the United States in 1945. He married a U.S. citizen, resided in New York, and obtained a suspension of deportation after proving his good moral character for the preceding five years. In 1949, he was admitted to permanent residence in the United States as of January 10, 1945. Chew served with credit in the United States Merchant Marine in World War II and never had difficulty with governmental authorities. He filed a petition for naturalization in April 1950, and he was screened and passed by the Coast Guard for employment as a seaman on a merchant vessel in November 1950. That same month, he became employed as chief steward on the S.S. Sir John Franklin, a ship registered in the United States with its home port in New York City. The S.S. Sir John Franklin set off on a voyage, which included calls at several foreign ports in Asia. Chew remained aboard the ship during the voyage. However, as the ship arrived in San Francisco in March 1951, the immigration inspector ordered him \\"temporarily excluded,\\" under 8 CFR § 175.57, as an alien whose entry was deemed prejudicial to the public interest. When the ship arrived in New York on March 29, the government continued Chew's \\"temporary exclusion\\" and did not permit him to land. On March 30, Chew petitioned the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that his detention was arbitrary and capricious and a denial of due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Attorney General J. Howard McGrath, purporting to act under 8 CFR § 175.57(b), ordered Chew's \\"temporary exclusion be made permanent\\" and denied him a hearing before a Board of Special Inquiry. After the Attorney General denied Chew all information as to the nature and cause of any accusations against him and all opportunity to be heard in opposition to the order for his \\"exclusion,\\" Chew was detained at Ellis Island \\"for safe-keeping on behalf of the master of the S.S. Sir John Franklin.\\" The District Court issued but subsequently dismissed a writ of habeas corpus, and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal on appeal. Both of the courts relied upon Knauff v. Shaughnessy (1950) in their decisions. Both courts also denied Chew's applications for bail. Supreme Court Kwong Hai Chew filed for a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court. The Court granted certiorari, agreeing to hear the case. = Opinion of the Court = Justice Harold Hitz Burton wrote the opinion of the court, issued on February 9, 1953. The ruling reversed the Second Circuit's decision and held that the Attorney General lacked the authority under 8 CFR § 175.57(b) to order the exclusion and deportation of a lawful permanent resident \\"without notice of the charges against him and without opportunity to be heard in opposition to them.\\" The ruling also held that an alien who \\"is a lawful permanent resident of the United States and also is a seaman who has gone outside of the United States on a vessel of American registry, with its home port in the United States, and, upon completion of such voyage, has returned on such vessel to the United States and is still on board\\" retains his rights to procedural due process under the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution.Kwong Hai Chew v.

As Iyase, he was the prime minister in the court of the Oba of Benin, in addition, his strong support of Oba Akenzua II in the early 1950s created his alias B-2, or Benin authentic number 2, a mockery of Gaius Obaseki who was then Iyase. From 1963 to 1966, Omo-Osagie was influential in the administration of Dennis Osadebay, Premier of the Mid- Western region, he had a close relationship with Festus Okotie Eboh and his political group was influential in Benin division during the 1960s. He led a pro-Benin monarchy group called Otu-Edo but cultivated an antagonistic attitude towards his opponents and was at times strong willed in his commitment to Otu-Edo causes. Life Omo-Osagie was born in Iyekuselu quarters of Benin, his father was a grandson of Iyase N'Ohenmwen. He was educated at King's College, Lagos, completing studies in 1919. Thereafter, he joined the sanitary department as inspector, he worked in the colonial civil service from 1919 to 1945. As a civil servant, he joined Herbert Macaulay's NNDP and later joined the Nigerian Youth Movement after its founding in 1934. Upon retirement, he was nominated to represent his constituency in the new regional House of Chiefs in 1946. Omo-Osagie was soon influenced by the political aspiration of Gaius Obaseki, the Iyase of Benin who was in the process of whittling down the influence of the traditional authority in Benin, the Oba of Benin, Akenzua II. Omo-Osagie sided with the traditionalists and joined Otu-Edo, a political group in support of the Oba that was growing in popularity. He was a longtime president of the association. In the local Benin election of 1951, he led Otu-Edo's alliance with NCNC to victory over Obaseki's Action Group; he also became a member of the regional House of Assembly. In 1954, he was elected House of Representative member from Benin and re-elected in 1959. From 1955 to 1959, he was Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Finance where he developed a relationship with Festus Okotie- Eboh. After the Mid-western region was created, Omo-Osagie served as an interim deputy administrator and then parliamentarian in the regional House of Assembly. Omo-Osagie's leadership of Otu-Edo coincided with the rise of Owegbe, a secret cult aligned with Otu-Edo's objectives, the secret society grew in numbers in the aftermath of Obaseki's headship of both the Benin Divisional Council and the Benin lodge of the Reformed Ogboni from 1948 to 1951. Obaseki was perceived to have created a privileged class of Ogboni members who had access to government employment and near monopoly of contracts. Ogboni rivals soon congregated under Owegbe Society as an antidote and protection from alleged abuse of power by Ogboni members who were accused of using intimidation and blackmail tactics and also abusing tax powers by placing high tax burden placed on opponents. Members of the Owegbe created a ritual initiation process for members to tie their allegiance to the society and Otu-Edo. The society encouraged members to use herbs as medicine and for protection. After the victory of Otu-Edo in 1951 election, the society grew and became an important political mobilization tool of the party. In 1959, the opposition party which controlled the regional government banned the society, sensing its political importance to Otu-Edo's victories in Benin division in the 1950s.

It concerns a Levite from Ephraim and his concubine, who travel through the Benjaminite city of Gibeah and are assailed by a mob, who wish to sodomize the Levite. He turns his concubine over to the crowd, and they rape her until she dies. The Levite dismembers her corpse and presents the remains to the other tribes of Israel. Outraged by the incident, they swear that none shall give his daughter to the Benjaminities for marriage, and launch a war which nearly wipes out the clan, leaving only 600 surviving men. However, the punitive expedition is overcome by remorse, fearing that it will cause the extinction of an entire tribe. They circumvent the oath by pillaging and massacring the city of Jabesh-Gilead, none of whose residents partook in the war or in the vow, and capturing its 400 maidens for the Benjaminites. The 200 men still lacking women are subtly allowed to abduct the maidens dancing at Shiloh. Biblical account =The outrage at Gibeah= A Levite from the mountains of Ephraim had a concubine, who left him and returned to the house of her father in Bethlehem in Judah. Heidi M. Szpek observes that this story serves to support the institution of monarchy, and the choice of the locations of Ephraim (the ancestral home of Samuel, who anointed the first king) and Bethlehem, (the home of King David), are not accidental. According to the King James Version and the New International Version, the concubine was unfaithful to the Levite; according to a note in the SeptuagintCambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on Judges 19, accessed 16 November 2016 and in the New Living Translation she was \\"angry\\" with him.Translations of Judges 19:2 at Biblehub. Rabbinical interpretations say that the woman was both fearful and angry with her husband and left because he was selfish, putting his comfort before his wife and their relationship,Kadari, Tamar. \\"Concubine of a Levite: Midrash and Aggadah\\", Jewish Women's Archive. and the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges argues that the translation as 'angry' \\"suits the context, which implies a quarrel, but not unfaithfulness, on the woman’s part\\". The Levite travelled to Bethlehem to retrieve her, and for five days her father managed to persuade him to delay their departure. On the fifth day, the Levite declined to postpone their journey any longer, and they set out late in the day. The Levite attempts to find lodging in Gibeah – by Charles Joseph Staniland, circa 1900 As they approached Jebus (Jerusalem), the servant suggested they stop for the night, but the Levite refused to stay in a Jebusite city, and they continued on to Gibeah. J. P. Fokkelman argues that is a chiasm, which hinges on the Levite referring to Jebus as \\"a town of aliens who are not of Israel.\\" In doing this, the narrator is hinting at the \\"selfishness and rancid group egotism\\" of the Levite. Yet, it is not the \\"aliens\\" of Jebus who commit a heinous crime, but Benjaminites in Gibeah.J. P. Fokkelman, Reading Biblical Narrative (Leiderdorp: Deo, 1999), 110–11. They arrived in Gibeah just at nightfall. The Levite and his party waited in the public square, but no one offered the customary hospitality. Eventually, an old man came in from working in the field and inquired as to their situation. He, too was from the mountains of Ephraim, but had lived among the Benjaminites for some time. He invited them to spend the night at his house rather than the open square. He brought him into his house, and gave fodder to the donkeys; they washed their feet, and ate and drank.Judges 19 The Israelite discovers his concubine, dead on his doorstep – by Gustave Doré, Circa 1880 Suddenly certain men of the city surrounded the house and beat on the door. They spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, \\"Bring out the man who came to your house, that we may know him.\\" \\"To know\\" is probably a euphemism for sexual intercourse here, as in other biblical texts and as the NRSV translates it.Stone, Ken. \\"Concubine of a Levite: Bible\\", Jewish Women's Archive. The Ephraimite host offered instead his own maiden daughter and the Levite's concubine. Ken Stone observes, \\"Apparently the sexual violation of women was considered less shameful than that of men, at least in the eyes of other men. Such an attitude reflects both the social subordination of women and the fact that homosexual rape was viewed as a particularly severe attack on male honor.\\" When the men would not be dissuaded, the Levite thrust the concubine out the door. They abused her all night, not letting her go until dawn, when she collapsed outside the door, where the Levite found her the next morning. Finding her unresponsive, he placed her on a donkey and continued his journey home. The account does not state when or where the woman died. Upon his return, he carved up her body into twelve pieces which he sent to all the Israelite tribes, demanding revenge.Arnold SJ, Patrick M., Gibeah: The Search for a Biblical City, A&C; Black, 1990 =The war against Benjamin= Outrage at Gibeah, the Levite carries his dead concubine away – by Gustave Doré, circa 1890 Outraged, the confederated tribes mobilized to demand justice and gathered a combined force of about 400,000 confederated Israelites at Mizpah. They sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, demanding that they deliver up the men who committed the crime to be executed, but the Benjaminites refused and decided to go to war to defend the men of Gibeah instead. They gathered a rebel Benjaminite force of 26,000 to defend Gibeah. According to Judges 20:16, among all these soldiers there were seven hundred select troops who were left-handed, each of whom could sling a stone at a hair and not miss. When the Tribe of Benjamin refused to surrender the guilty parties, the rest of the tribes marched on Gibeah. On the first day of battle the confederated Israelite tribes suffered heavy losses. On the second day Benjamin went out against them from Gibeah and cut down thousands of the confederated Israelite swordsmen. Then the confederated Israelites went up to the house of God. They sat there before the Lord and fasted that day until evening; and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord. (The ark of the covenant of God was there in those days, and Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it.) And the Lord said, \\"Go up, for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hand.\\" On the third day the confederated Israelites set men in ambush all around Gibeah. They formed into formation as before and the rebelling Benjaminites went out to meet them. The rebelling Benjaminites killed about thirty in the highways and in the field, anticipating another victory where unaware of the trap that had been set as the confederated Israelites appeared to retreat and the Benjaminites were drawn away from the city to the highways in pursuit, one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah. Those besieging the city sent up a great cloud of smoke as a signal, and the Israelite main force wheeled around to attack. When the Benjaminites saw their city in flames, and that the retreat had been a ruse, they panicked and routed toward the desert, pursued by the confederated Israelites. About 600 survived the onslaught and made for the more defensible rock of Rimmon where they remained for four months. The Israelites withdrew through the territory off Benjamin, destroying every city they came to, killing every inhabitant and all the livestock. =Finding new wives= Tribe of Benjamin (light pink – center) invaded by the rest of Israel According to the Hebrew Bible, the men of Israel had sworn an oath at Mizpah, saying, \\"None of us shall give his daughter to Benjamin as a wife.\\"Judges 21 Then the people came to the house of God, and remained there before God till evening. They lifted up their voices and wept bitterly, and said, \\"O Lord God of Israel, why has this come to pass in Israel, that today there should be one tribe missing in Israel?\\" So it was, on the next morning, that the people rose early and built an altar there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. The children of Israel said, \\"Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who did not come up with the assembly to the Lord?\\" For they had made a great oath concerning anyone who had not come up to the Lord at Mizpah, saying, \\"He shall surely be put to death.\\" And the children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother, and said, \\"One tribe is cut off from Israel today. What shall we do for wives for those who remain, seeing we have sworn by the Lord that we will not give them our daughters as wives?\\" And they said, \\"What one is there from the tribes of Israel who did not come up to Mizpah to the Lord?\\" And, in fact, no one had come to the camp from Jabesh Gilead to the assembly. For when the people were counted, indeed, not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead was there. So the congregation sent out there twelve thousand of their most valiant men, and commanded them, saying, \\"Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, including the women and children. And this is the thing that you shall do: You shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman who has known a man intimately.\\" So they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins who had not known a man intimately; and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan. Then the whole congregation sent word to the children of Benjamin who were at the rock of Rimmon, and announced peace to them. So Benjamin came back at that time, and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh Gilead; and yet they had not found enough for them. And the people grieved for Benjamin, because the Lord had made a void in the tribes of Israel. Illustration from the Morgan Bible of the Benjaminites taking women of Shiloh as wives. Then the elders of the congregation said, \\"What shall we do for wives for those who remain, since the women of Benjamin have been destroyed?\\" And they said, \\"There must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, that a tribe may not be destroyed from Israel. However, we cannot give them wives from our daughters, for the children of Israel have sworn an oath, saying, 'Cursed be the one who gives a wife to Benjamin.'\\" Then they said, \\"In fact, there is a yearly feast of the Lord in Shiloh, which is north of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.\\" Therefore, they instructed the children of Benjamin, saying, \\"Go, lie in wait in the vineyards, and watch; and just when the daughters of Shiloh come out to perform their dances, then come out from the vineyards, and every man catch a wife for himself from the daughters of Shiloh; then go to the land of Benjamin. Then it shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to us to complain, that we will say to them, 'Be kind to them for our sakes, because we did not take a wife for any of them in the war; for it is not as though you have given the women to them at this time, making yourselves guilty of your oath.'\\" And the children of Benjamin did so (on Tu B'Av); they took enough wives for their number from those who danced, whom they caught. Then they went and returned to their inheritance, and they rebuilt the cities and dwelt in them. So the children of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and family; they went out from there, every man to his inheritance. According to the Book of Judges 20:15–18, the strength of the armies numbered 26,000 men on the Benjamin side (of whom only 700 from Gibeah), and 400,000 men on the other side. Richard A. Gabriel, The Military History of Ancient Israel. Rabbinical interpretation R. Ebiathar and R. Yonatan explained that this incident shows that a person should never abuse his household, for in this narrative it resulted in the death of tens of thousands of Israelites in the ensuing warfare. What happens within the small family unit is reflective of society as a whole, and marital peace is the basis for every properly functioning society. According to some rabbinical commentators, Phineas sinned due to his not availing his servitude of Torah instruction to the masses at the time leading up to the battle of Gibeah.Yalkut Shimoni, 19,19 In addition, he also failed to address the needs of relieving Jephthah of his vow to sacrifice his daughter.Genesis rabbah, 60,3 As consequence, the high priesthood was taken from him and temporarily given to the offspring of Ithamar, essentially Eli and his sons.  Scholarly view  Traditionally the story of the Concubine of a Levite and the preceding story of Micah's Shrine have been seen as supplemental material appended to the Book of Judges in order to describe the chaos and depravity to which Israel had sunk by the end of the period of the Judges, and thereby justify the establishment of the monarchy. The lack of this institution (\\"At that time, there was no king in Israel\\") is repeated a number of times, such as Judges 17:6; 18:1; 19:1; and 21:25.Szpek, Heidi M., \\"The Levite’s Concubine: The Story That Never Was\\", Women in Judaism, Vol.5, No.1, 2007 Yairah Amit in The Book of Judges: The Art of Editing, concluded that chapters 19–21 were written by a post-exilic author whose intent was to make the political statement that Israel works together. According to scholars, the biblical text describing the battle and the events surrounding it is considerably late in date, originating close to the time of the Deuteronomist's compilation of Judges from its source material, and clearly has several exaggerations of both numbers and of modes of warfare. Jewish Encyclopedia Additionally, the inhospitality which triggered the battle is reminiscent of the Torah's account of Sodom and Gomorrah. Many Biblical scholars concluded that the account was a piece of political spin, which had been intended to disguise atrocities carried out by the tribe of Judah against Benjamin, probably in the time of King David as an act of revenge or spite by David against the associates of King Saul, by casting them further back in time, and adding a more justifiable motive. More recently, scholars have suggested that it is more likely for the narrative to be based on a kernel of truth, particularly since it accounts for the stark contrast in the biblical narrative between the character of the tribe before the incident and its character afterwards.  Feminist interpretation  It is evident that the victimized woman has no voice, as is often the case with rape. According to Brouer, many biblical authors \\"…highly value women and speak adamantly against rape.\\" The woman stands apart from the other characters in the story by not being given a name or voice. A woman from Bethlehem, she grew up in a family- centered, agrarian society soon after the death of Joshua (Judges 1:1). She had the status of a concubine (Hebrew pilegesh), rather than a wife, to a Levite living in Ephraim. Madipoane Masenya writes > ...it appears that she was not an ordinary pilegesh. This is buttressed by > the observation that the word 'neerah can be translated as 'newly married > woman'. In addition, the 'pilegesh’s father is referred to as 'hatoh' or > 'hatan', which literally means, 'he who has a son-in-law', that is, a > father-in-law in relation to the pilegesh’s husband, the Levite. I therefore > choose to translate the word 'pilegesh' as 'a legitimate wife', one of the > wives of the Levite... Because it was rare for a woman to leave her husband, the narrator uses harsh language to describe the reason for the concubine leaving. She is said to have prostituted herself against her husband. Though it is assumed that she is a prostitute, the Hebrew verb for prostitution, zanah, can also mean \\"to be angry.\\" It is more plausible that because the Levite spoke harshly towards her, she acted on her own and fled to her father's home where she was welcomed. Therefore, the Levite had to change his way of speaking in order for her to return with him. Throughout the story, the concubine never has a speaking role. Only the men ever speak, even though the story is centered around a woman. When the Levite stumbles over his concubine in the morning, it is unclear whether she is dead, as there is no reply. When the concubine dies is unknown; whether it was during the brutal night, on the way back to Ephraim, or when the Levite dismembers her body. Because of the Levite's actions, The Levite of Ephraim, A.F.Caminafe (1837) At a time when there was no king or ruler in Israel, the old man uses the concubine in order to protect the Levite, thinking this was the right thing to do. The men of the city never saw a problem with their actions against the foreigners. The Priscilla Papers, a Christian egalitarian journal, makes mention of the narrative, writing: \\"By equating 'rape' with doing the 'good in their eyes,' the text makes a powerful rhetorical statement by connecting a key theme throughout Judges with the rape of the concubine: Everyone was doing what was good in their eyes, but evil in God’s eyes.\\" Judges 19 concludes by saying that nothing like this had happened since the Exodus of the Israelites from Ancient Egypt. Comparing the lamb sacrifice on the doors in Egypt to the concubine on the doorstep using sacrificial language, Brouer furthers the narrator's final statement saying, See also * Sati (Hindu goddess), cut into 51 pieces after her death * Sodom and Gomorrah  References  Further reading *Bohmbach, Karla G. \\"Conventions/Contraventions: The Meanings of Public and Private for the Judges 19 Concubine.\\" Journal for the Study of the Old Testament, vol. 24, no. 83, 1999, pp. 83–98., doi:10.1177/030908929902408306. *Szpek, Heidi M. \\"The Levite's Concubine: The Story That Never Was.\\" Women in Judaism: A Multidisciplinary e-Journal, 19 Jan. 2008.

It takes only 4 minutes to walk from Yaowarat Road. Nana is nestled between the old culture of China and the invading modernism. It is famous for being a hipster bar street in Bangkok where modern culture meets with the traditional Thai-Chinese culture of the Bangkok.  History and development  This little alley has always changed since the Era of \\"Gangsters in the City\\" (in the 1950s). In the 1950s and 1960s, Soi Nana used to be a horde of gangsters as almost every street of Bangkok had “owners”. The community in this era is dark and scary form the power of the gangs. When the time passed, all of those gangsters failed down, and Soi Nana gradually changed into a large Chinese drugstore area according to immigrating Chinese who lived in the area. Until now, the smell of herbal remedies is still embedded in the community. In the 2010s, from being isolated in the alley, it has started to come to life since there have been a lot of popping cafes and bars from the new generation. Nana is hit by the new wave which consists of joy and lively life of the new generations who come to this area to create a society of their era. There are many cafes, bars, restaurants and galleries in the streets. \\"From gangsters to Chinese drug stores until now, Soi Nana is settle to be a place to support all kinds of people and allow them to rotate and create new meaning for this small alley.\\" (Wonngwisethpiboon, P., 2017, para 12)  Reasons for popularity  Soi Nana is a good alternative nightlife spot to escape from the familiarity of Bangkok like Sathorn, Sukhumvit, or Silom area. \\"The unassuming and utterly charming Soi Nana in Yaowarat has gained momentum as a destination for intrepid drinkers and art lovers.\\" (Doman, 2018, para. 1). The theme and style of bars and restaurants in this street is mainly about cultural content of the community, for example modern Chinese bars and restaurants that serve modern Thai-Chinese food and cocktails, There are modern traditional Thai bars that serve some Thais drinks and play traditional Thai music or modern Thai teen movies. Even Though it is located in Yaowarat (Chinatown), this area is offering new experiences to customers in the same level as 5 star bars and restaurants.  Interesting places to visit  (Rodsom, 2016) * Tep Bar: A mixed culture bar between traditional Thai and modernism creating new uniqueness and good strange experience of drinking. * Ba Hao: A combination between modernism and traditional Chinese which is the root the community to create new style of drinking space and hotel together. * Cho Why: The one and only gallery space where a lot of artists come to show their works and exchange their experience with other. * El Chiringuito: The first bar and cafe that is popped up in this alley serving Spanish drinking style by a Spanish owner.

She began her career more than 75 years ago, in 1939. Marilú was born in Cárdenas, San Luis Potosí, Mexico. After her father's death, the family moved to Tampico, Tamaulipas, where Marilú won a singing contest and joined the troupe of a comedian named Don Catarino. In November 1940 she joined Paco Miller's troupe, which later toured Mexican states. In Mexico City, Marilú became an XEW radio performer and appeared in her first film, La liga de las canciones (1941). She also sang at the Teatro Lírico and the Teatro Follies. In 1943, she sang at the Waikiki nightclub and joined Alfonso Brito's troupe at the Carpa Colonial. After signing a contract with Filmex (a production company), she studied drama with Gustavo Villatoro and co-starred with actor and director Joaquín Pardavé in three of his films: Los hijos de Don Venancio (1944), Los nietos de Don Venancio (1946), and El barchante Neguib (1946).

Traditionally they have been massively produced in Loštice, a town in the Olomouc Region of the Czech Republic and the surrounding area (former North Moravia) since the end of the 14th or at the beginning of the 15th century and ceased to be manufactured sometime in the early 16th. These goblets have been a highly prized form of trading goods. They are found in many of the castles of Central Europe. The first slim brown- colored goblets with nodules in the surface were found in Loštice in 1874.Měřínský Z., Přehled typů loštické keramiky, jejich vývoj a datování, [w:] Vlastivědný věstník moravský 21, Brno 1969, p. 89-105  Technology of production  The pottery from Loštice have been divided into five basic ceramics categories. The first comprises blister-marked surface ceramics (with the nodules), the second is very well baked, so-called stoneware, the third is made up of soft kaolinite clay, mostly white baked, the fourth includes sand, and the fifth contains graphite.Goš V., Loštice. Město středověkých hrnčířů, Opava 2007, p. 56-93, 117-123 Craftsmen added graphite slate to fat clay. The Svinov deposits they used, however, contained a natural admixture of pyrite. The latter, when fired at high temperature, became active by creating intumescent gas bubbles, which burst, exploding, forming on the surface the small bumps or craters.Mackiewicz M., Post-Medieval artistic pottery from excavations of St. Peter's and St. Paul's church on the Cathedral Island in Wroclaw [w:] Vratislava Antiqua 17, Wrocław 2012, p. 145. Vessels were turned on rapidly rotating potters' wheels; the potters used oxidation baked in simple furnaces, with combined firing and heating space. Vessels were fired at a temperature almost 1000 °C, getting the Loštice effect required more than 1200 °C. The surface tint is light or dark brown-colored.  Morphology of ceramics  The largest number of pottery are mugs with a barrel-shaped body, flat base and various edging. The edging is a period indicative. Very common form is the goblet with blister-surface or made from soft kaolinite clay. Other forms are jugs with a cylindrical or S-shaped neck, bowls with a conical body and flat base, often decorated with red markings, vessels with a conical body and a club-shaped rim, lids, miniature vessels, tiles, pipes and flagsones. The most far-famed are the so-called \\"Loštice goblets\\", categorised in three basic classes. Type I. is slim with a circular rim, group A having flat walls, whilst in group B walls have curvature. Type II. has a wreath handle on the body, group A with a cylindrical neck and group B conical neck. Type III. has a slim body and rim.Goš V., Loštice. Město středověkých hrnčířů, Opava 2007, p. 56-93, 117-123 Ceramics from Loštice were decorated with engravings as parallel grooves or notches, raised forms, above all the so- called \\"lípané maliny” (made up of the soft clay wheel-shaped ornaments decorated with small nodules like balls) and painting, especially red.  Goblets with Loštice effect  Typical slim goblets with nodules on the surface and a plain rim first appeared at the beginning of 15th century. One of the oldest examples is the goblet discovered at Tovačov, which held silver coins the so-called „groše český” of the Czech kings Charles IV and Waclaw IV. Taking into account the goblet's type and the dates of minting these coins, probably the goblet was made at the turn of the 14th and 15th century. Around the mid 15th century, craftsmen began to produce goblets with a wreath handle, designated type II. Some of the Loštice goblets had been edged with silver. The manufacture of these goblets ceased sometime before 1550, when the handiwork of southern Moravian craftsmen of higher quality forced them out of the marketplace. The example of type II.B is portrayed in the painting of Hieronymus Bosch The Garden of Terrestrial Pleasures from the early 16th century.  Imitations of Loštice goblets  Loštice was not the sole site for production of pottery displaying the Loštice effect. Pottery workshops have been discovered in nearby Mohelnice, Žádlovice, Masnice, Líšnice and Svinova. Goblets of type II. were very popular thanks to their unusual shape and surface. They have been found in towns and castles of Moravia and Central Europe; their range of occurrence covered the area from Poland to Serbia. Success of the Loštice goblets on the market was an inspiration for potters to devise similar vessels, but these imitations often surpassed the originals in quality. In the area along the Danube river, goblets were produced with sand sprinkled on the surface and with a brown glaze. In Moravia craftsmen placed so-called \\"lípané maliny” on the goblets. From Budapest there are known goblets in Loštice style, which were made up with a majolica glaze and richly adorned.

Maurice Max-Ingrand, better known as Max Ingrand (20 December 1908, Bressuire - 25 August 1969, Paris) was a French artist and decorator, known for his work in studio glass and his stained glass windows. He was educated at the École nationale supérieure des beaux-arts and École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs, studying under Jacques Grüber and Charles Lemaresquier. He married Paulette Rouquié (1910−1997) in 1931. He worked with his wife in glass etching, exhibiting work at the 21st Société des artistes décorateurs in 1931. Ingrand began to work in stained glass windows for private commissions. His first church windows were for Sainte-Agnès, Maisons-Alfort and participating in the design for Notre-Dame de Paris in 1937. He was drafted for military service in 1939 and fell into captivity at Hoyerswerda in May 1940. He returned from captivity only in 1945. He divorced his wife in 1946 and married Marie-Alberte Madre-Rey, with whom he had two children. He was artistic director of Milano interior design company Fontana Arte during 1954-1967.Max Ingrand (fontanaarte.com) He was elected president of the French scouting association (Association Française de l'Éclairage) in 1968. He founded the company Verre Lumière, one of the first producers of halogen lamps, in 1968. Ingrand created numerous church stained glass windows during the late 1940s to 1960s (in some cases replacing windows that had been destroyed in World War II) including windows in Pontoise Cathedral (1955),Cathédrale Saint-Maclou de Pontoise, Denis Pichon, éd.

Journal of Medical Entomology, 31(1),99-104. https://academic.oup.com/jme/article/31/1/99/2221354  Description  = Adults = B. nobilis is a medium-sized Bezzia species with wing lengths ranging from 1.5 mm to 2.6 mm. Their wings are white but contain thin yellow veins that may give the wings a yellowish tint. Their legs have distinct stripes, with thick alternating bands of yellow and black. These black bands are located specifically on the bases and apices of the femurs and tibia of adult flies. Black setae cover the legs, particularly occurring on the black bands at the apices of the tibia and femurs. These setae are more numerous in males than females. Adult B. nobilis flies generally have thoraxes with colors varying by segment and sex.  Females  Female adult B. nobilis flies have curved claws. While upper portions of their body, like the head and antennae, are a darker brown or gray color, the majority of females' abdomens are lightly colored with a range from white to yellow and covered in fine black setae. They have one pair of long yellow gland rods running along their body. Adult females have two asymmetrical spermathecae chambers that collect and store sperm, reachable through a short passage.  Males  Male adult B. nobilis flies have been described in less detail than females. Their abdomens are brown, but existing descriptions focus lies on their reproductive organ attached to the abdomen: the adeagus. Adeagi of B. nobilis males are arched, small and stout, tapering into a blunt dististyle, a blade-shaped accessory on the adeagus. Males, like females, have antennae on their heads, but they also sport yellow, fan-like plumage. = Pupae = B. nobilis pupae are 3.5 mm - 4.0 mm long. They have respiratory horns 0.22 mm to 0.27 mm long. The body of B. nobilis pupa is brown in color and covered in short abdominal spines. = Larvae = B. nobilis larvae are approximately 7.0 mm in length. Their brown colored heads are long, thin, and tapered, with a curved mandible and topped by two eyes. B. nobilis larvae have white bodies, and unlike adults have very few setae. The only setae are located on the last body segment where there are eight long ones neatly arranged in pairs.  Distribution  B. nobilis is widely considered one of the most common of all Bezzia species. B. nobilis can be found across extensive regions of the world, occupying regions of Eurasia, covering North and Central America, and even being found as southern as Brazil and Uruguay. This is one of the largest distributions of all Bezzia species, covering a much greater area in comparison to most other species within the genus.  Habitat  Typical habitat B. nobilis flies are often found living in sandy and muddy areas. They are especially associated with algae that grow near the edges of shallow pools of water. In European regions, B. nobilis larvae have been found in sand or sand-silt that surround lakes, or stagnant pools of water in woody areas. Adult flies have been observed to mate in brackish water. In the southern United States, B. nobilis have been found in the marshes located within the Everglades National Park.Jacobsen, R. E. (2008). Midge (Diptera: Chironomidae and Certaopogonidae) community response to canal discharge into Everglades National Park, Florida. Retrieved from http://publications.cm- funchal.pt/jspui/bitstream/100/962/1/Bolmmf_s13_2008_pp039-050.pdf150x150px  Life history  Though the specifics describing the life cycle of B. nobilis are mostly unknown and research is lacking compared to many other Diptera species, description of the various life stages, suggest B. nobilis follows a life cycle similar to other Dipterans. Physical descriptions of B. nobilis exist for larva, pupa, and adults indicating B. nobilis at least moves through these three stages in life as many other flies do.  Food resources  = Predation on other flies = The feeding habits of Bezzia species are widely unknown, but the little research available suggests B. nobilis, and other closely related species are predatory, relying on other adults or larvae of other species as food sources. The brine fly Ephydra thermophylla was observed as a major prey item for B. nobilis flies living in hot springs. Brine Fly Much of the research available suggests larvae of multiple Bezzia species including B. nobilis seem to especially rely on Aedes aegypti Mosquito Larvaemosquito larvae as prey. An experiment revealed that B. nobilis larvae easily gave up when mosquito larvae fought back. They did not observe any successful consumption of the mosquito larvae during this experiment, instead their lack of aggression led B. nobilis larvae to fail in preying on mosquito larvae, unlike another closely related species, Bezzia sp. nr. expolita. B. nobilis larvae did not successfully pupate when only given mosquito or other larvae to prey upon, but they did successfully survive on bacteria, protozoa, or dead adult flies. These observations suggest that B. nobilis are predatory in nature but prefer easy and immobile prey. = Feeding behavior = B. nobilis larvae failed to reach pupation on mosquito larvae alone. B. nobilis larvae were observed feeding on dead adult insects. To do this, they burrowed into the bodies of the adults and formed a bolus that they then swallowed. When forming this bolus, the larvae exhibited consistent behavior of a series of rhythmic motions. They gently moved their heads side-to-side, and once this motion stopped, switched to using their mandibles to form the bolus before bringing it into their mouths.  Mating behavior  Though there is little research available on the mating habits of B. nobilis, they have been observed to mate in brackish water. = Females = The anatomy of female B. nobilis flies includes two asymmetric spermathecae chambers. Spermathecae are structures common to Dipteran species in which females are capable of storing sperm. Flies with spermathecae often allocate this sperm to eggs at some time after copulation has occurred. = Males = The physical description of male B. nobilis is less detailed than that of female adults and focuses on reproductive structures. Male B. nobilis adults have short, stout adeagi, that seem to complement the short chamber from which females' spermathecae are accessible. Their adeagi are external, and located on their abdomens, and only males of B. nobilis have yellow plumage on their heads. The presence of this plumage may hint at the existence of male competition for female mates, as throughout animal species, bright plumage on males is often involved in mating rituals.

Early life and education Quinn and her sister Cath both entered a competition at school to write a novel. Both sisters were announced as joint winners of the award, both Quinn and her sister have gone on to become authors since that competition. She studied Sociology at the University of Nottingham. Career She began her career working as a journalist and ghost writer. She wrote for a number of British newspapers, including The Guardian, Sunday Times Magazine and The Sun. While working as a journalist, she signed her first book deal with Hodder & Stoughton in 2011 and released a psychological thriller. In 2012, Quinn signed a two-book deal with Hachette Livre and released her novel, \\"Glass Geishas\\" The novel was later retitled, Night Girls. The book drew on her experiences of working as a geisha in Japan during her twenties. It follows events in the Roppongi district after a hostess goes missing. The novel has also been published in Russia. What's On Dubai listed the book under its top 10 reads for summer 2012. After having a second daughter, Quinn wrote the Bad Mother's Diary, a romantic comedy about new motherhood and single motherhood. The book also became a bestseller. Quinn's Bad Mother's book series began life as a concept for a magazine article. In an interview, Quinn stated she \\"just couldn't stop writing\\" once she started the story of Juliette and Nick (characters from the Bad Mother's Diary). The series has since grown to a collection of six books, which follows the life of a mother through both motherhood and romance. The first of the \\"Bad Mother's\\" series outsold all her other books, reaching first position on the romantic comedy list on Amazon. In 2018, Quinn received a two-book deal from HQ Harper Collins for two psychological thrillers, Don't Tell Teacher and Not My Daughter. Don't Tell Teacher reached number 7 in the UK Kindle charts on its release in March 2018. In May 2020, Quinn released \\"Not My Daughter,\\" a story about a 16-year-old runaway. Not My Daughter reached number 27 in the UK Kindle charts on its May 2020 release. In 2020, Quinn released her sixth installment, Bad Mother's Virus. The book was written and released during the UK's COVID-19 pandemic, and tells the story of self-isolating mum during lockdown in Quinn's comical style used throughout the Bad Mother series.

Five years later, in 1829, a colonial prospector named J. T. Thomson recorded the historical site as Tombs of the Malayan Princes, which is the name that appeared on a map by G. D. Coleman, published in Calcutta in 1836 and in London in 1839. Another name appearing on early maps is Sultan Keramat, meaning Sultan’s Holy Grounds. The cemetery features tombstones with inscriptions in a diversity of languages and writing systems, reflecting the indigenous peoples of Singapore, including Malay, Javanese script, Buginese Lontara script, Arabic, English, Mandarin and Gujarati. In 1852, Syed Omar Aljunied donated the large plot of land as a waqf (inalienable charitable endowment) to be used as a Muslim burial ground under the trusteeship of his descendants. In 1987, Singapore Land Authority acquired ownership of the cemetery grounds. In 1998, Singapore’s Urban Redevelopment Authority earmarked the site for residential redevelopment.

She is the author of 29 cookery books in English and 30 books in Tamil, together containing more than 4,000 recipes. Some of her books have been translated into Telugu, Kannada and Hindi. Her books include the Tamil “Siru Dhaniya Samayal” series, containing recipes using traditional nutritious ingredients and millets such as Sirudhaniyangal Ragi, kambu, Saamai, thinai, varagu, cholam and kudhiraivali. Early life Born and brought up in Salem, a town in Tamilnadu, India, Mallika completed her Bachelors in Home Science from Salem. In the late 1980s, at the age of 21, she married Badrinath a chartered accountant from Chennai. In an interview with The Hindu, she admitted to have rarely cooked before marriage as they lived in a large joint family of 25, and had a cook and an assistant cook to do the cooking. However, she was interested in recipes and collected them in a scrap book, handwriting all of them. Literary career In Chennai, Badrinath continued to cook and collect recipes. These included recipes that she had received from her mother and aunt, which she would rewrite into notebooks, with variations based on her experience. Soon, she had 10 such handwritten books, including 80 recipes for side dishes. Her husband encouraged her to publish these recipes, resulting in her first book \\"100 Vegetarian Recipes\\" published in 1988. As her books became popular she took up writing full-time, publishing later books through her own publishing house \\"Pradeep enterprises\\". Her husband too reduced his work to help her market her books. The 1990s saw an increase in access to cable television in India, however there were few cookery programs in regional language such asTamil. As a result, Badrinath began to get offers for television shows on cookery, initially with Doordarshan and then with Sun TV. Badrinath says she tries to write one book per year. To date, she is the author of 32 cookery books and a number of cookery articles. Other ventures In 1999, Badrinath started to market masalas (Indian cooking powders) under the company \\"Mallika Home Products\\", often known as MHP. She continues to write articles related to cooking in magazines including Kungumam, Kumudam, Mangaiyar Malar, Snegithi, Porpadham and Gokulam kadir. She has hosted cookery shows on Sun TV (Ungal Manasukku Pidichadhu Mattum), Jaya TV (“Arusuvai Neram”) where her shows have run for more than 15 years. She has also featured in cookery shows in Polimer TV and Sakthi TV-Sri Lanka. She hosts her own YouTube channel called \\"Mallika's cookery\\". Personal life Badrinath is married and lives in Chennai with her husband. They have two children and three grandchildren. Awards Badrinath has received a number of awards including the “Priyadarshini Award” in 1998, which is given to women entrepreneurs in India. Her other awards include: *“Mahila Ratna” Award - presented by the Tamil Nadu Arya Vysya Mahila Sabha in 1998 *“Arusuvai Gnaana Kalamani” Award presented by the Thenn Indhiya Samayal Kalaignargal Sangam *“Acharya Award” in the field of cooking presented by Call Chennai in 2006 *“Best Cookery Show Host” Award presented by the Mylapore Academy in 2006 *“Arusuvai Arasi” Award presented by International Lions Clubs in 2008 *“Nala Maharani” conferred by Kungumam – Tamil magazine *“Professional Excellence Award” by Rotary Club – Tirunagar & My Madurai *“Sigaram Thotta Penmani” Award by Vijay TV on Women\`s Day 2012 References Category:Living people Category:Indian food writers Category:Women cookbook writers Category:Indian television chefs Category:Tamil people Category:Chefs of Indian cuisine Category:Writers from Chennai Category:Women chefs Category:20th-century Indian women writers Category:20th-century Indian writers Category:21st-century Indian women writers Category:21st-century Indian writers Category:20th-century Indian non-fiction writers Category:21st- century Indian non-fiction writers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Mallika Badrinath"},{"id":"57228322","text":"Opilidia chlorocephala, the lime-headed tiger beetle, is a species of flashy tiger beetle in the family Carabidae.
