Liebmann Brewery (later Rheingold Breweries) in Brooklyn, New York. The brewery's main brand Rheingold Extra Dry was one of the most popular beer brands in New York City in the 1940s to 1960s. Biography Heinrich Liebmann was born to a Jewish family in Schmiedelfeld in 1836, the son of Dara (n√©e Selz) and Samuel Liebmann. His father was, at the time, the owner of the estate Schloss Schmiedelfeld. In 1840, the family moved to Ludwigsburg and ran the inn \\"Zum Stern\\" and its attached brewery; and where Henry attended secondary school. His father determined to immigrate to the United States for political reasons and sent his son, Joseph, in 1850 in advance to procure a home. In 1854, the remainder of the family immigrated settling in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The family first leased and operated the old Maasche Brewery and later, pooling their resources, built a new brewery in Bushwick named the S. Liebmann Brewery. After the death of his father in 1872, the three sons took over the management of the brewery and incorporated it as S. Liebmann's Sons Brewing Company. The Liebmann brothers alternated with each other as Chief Executive Officer each year. Henry was responsible for brewing; Joseph for financial matters; and Charles for management and operations. In 1903, the Liebmann brothers retired and handed over the management of the company to six of their sons. Liebmann died in 1915 in New York City.

Arcus is an X-ray grating spectrometer space observatory that combines X-ray optics and gratings to disperse the X-rays, much like how a prism separates sunlight into the colors of the rainbow. It would observe astrophysical phenomena in X-ray band over a broad target size range. Its mission includes investigations on the composition of cosmic dust grains, stellar evolution, identify the launching mechanisms of supermassive black hole winds, and structure formation of galaxy clusters. Using new technologies, it offers a resolution improvement of ten times better than existing X-ray observatories.High-resolution X-ray gratings enable state-of-the-art spectrometer.

The agreement came after 2 weeks of negotiations that began with a Syrian Army ultimatum on 3 April. Around 1,500 rebels handed over heavy weapons and equipment to the Syrian Army, and were evacuated by 124 buses in 4 convoys to Turkish-held areas in the northern Aleppo Governorate along with their families, totaling around 5,000 people. On 25 April, the last batch of rebels and their families left the eastern Qalamoun pocket, and the region came under full Syrian government control. Background Rebels in the town of al-Dumayr and the rest of the eastern Qalamoun pocket have been in a state of ceasefire with government forces throughout 2016, with both sides focusing on fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. In mid-2017, however government forces launched an offensive against rebels in the Syrian Desert to the east of the pocket, following a previous rebel offensive against ISIL in the region. In late March 2018, the Levant Liberation Army launched an attack on Syrian Army positions in the eastern Qalamoun Mountains. This came amidst the Syrian Army offensive in eastern Ghouta. Rebel surrender and evacuation On 3 April 2018, rebel groups in the eastern Qalamoun pocket formed a unified military command, which met with a Russian and Air Force Intelligence Directorate officer, the latter issued an ultimatum to the rebels, demanding that they either disarm and reconcile, or leave the eastern Qalamoun pocket entirely. The rebel committee refused to leave and demanded the release of prisoners. The Levant Liberation Army stated that it was not part of the unified military command, denied any coordination with it, and rejected negotiations with Russia. On 8 April, the rebel unified command again met with Russian and Syrian Army officers, and reached a preliminary agreement. On 17 April, the government-run Syrian Arab News Agency announced that Jaysh al-Islam and the Forces of Martyr Ahmad al-Abdo in Dumayr have surrendered, and began to hand over heavy and medium weapons to the government. 5,000 people, which included 1,500 rebel fighters and 3,000 civilians, prepared to leave. Clashes also continued in the nearby mountains. On 18 April, Shaher Juma, head of the rebel negotiations committee in Dumayr, was assassinated by unidentified gunmen. On 19 April, the rebel unified command agreed to hand over weapons and surrender the entire eastern Qalamoun pocket, including the towns of Dumayr, Jayrud, and al-Naseriyah. Russian officers pledged to pardon people who evaded conscription in the towns. The first batch of 2,500 people, including 600 rebels, were then transported by 44 buses from Dumayr to Jarabulus. The second convoy of at least 30 buses departed in the early hours of 22 April, and included 1,200 Tahrir al-Sham and Ahrar al-Sham fighters and their families, who arrived in the Afrin District. The 3rd convoy arrived in the al-Bab area on 24 April, and the 4th and final batch of 60 buses arrived in northern Aleppo on 25 April. With this, the eastern Qalamoun Mountains came under full government control, and the flag of the Syrian Arab Republic was raised in Jayrud's main square. Along with the territory, the Syrian Arab army said that it also gained back several heavy weapons including a dozen of tanks.Pictures: Syrian Army‚Äôs Tiger Forces capture platoon of tanks, loads of pickups from fleeing militants in east Qalamoun After further territorial sweeps on 17 May, pro-government media reported that eight more tanks were found.VIDEO: Syrian Army discovers hidden weapons caches, tanks in East Qalamoun See also *Rif Dimashq Governorate campaign *Eastern Qalamoun offensive (September‚ÄìOctober 2016) *Syrian Desert campaign (December 2016‚ÄìApril 2017) *Syrian Desert campaign (May‚ÄìJuly 2017) *Rif Dimashq offensive (February‚ÄìApril 2018) *Southern Damascus offensive (April 2018) References Category:April 2018 events in Syria Category:Rif Dimashq Governorate in the Syrian Civil War Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War in 2018 Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving Tahrir al-Sham Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving the Syrian government Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving Ahrar al-Sham Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving Russia Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving the Free Syrian Army ","title":"Eastern Qalamoun offensive (April 2018)"},{"id":"57232408","title":"Alpine skiing at the 2018 Winter Paralympics ‚Äì Women's giant slalom"},{"id":"57232421","text":"Guangren Temple (), also called Guangren Lama Temple, is a Buddhist temple located in Lianhu District of Xi'an, Shaanxi, China.

The important thing that they need to do is to propagate any species to enough for agriculturist. From the experiment at the beginning founded that, there are many fruits that grow very well in the area of the north of Thailand. In 1979 the foundation of Royal project was selected the area of department of Agriculture at Pangda village, Samoeng, Chiangmai to be the experiment area for cereal and winter plant. However when the demand of the plants was increased, this station can‚Äôt produce enough plant for farmer so the foundation was decided to move to the new place that have the area around 25 rai and close to Plagung water reservoir. In 1985 the foundation was increased the area next to the primary area around 65 rai and was operated underneath of Pangda Royal Project station (Royal Project Foundation, 2555).

Bohen (born 1982) is an American politician. A former member of the New York State Assembly, he represented the 142nd district; this district includes South Buffalo, the City of Lackawanna, and the towns of West Seneca and Orchard Park. Bohen was elected to the Assembly in an April 24, 2018 special election, but was defeated in his bid for a full term on November 6, 2018. He is notable for having won election to the Assembly on the Republican line despite being an enrolled Democrat.  Early career  Bohen has worked in the Buffalo Public Schools as a special education teacher. He was the campaign manager for Carl Paladino's two successful school board campaigns. He has been active in numerous South Buffalo charities and organizations, including the Ryan Purcell Foundation. His father, Billy, was the longtime business agent for the local ironworkers union.  State Assembly  In 2018, after Mickey Kearns had stepped down from the Assembly to become Erie County Clerk, Bohen announced that he would seek Kearns's vacated seat in District 142; Bohen indicated that he was running as a conservative Democrat. The Erie County Democratic Committee denied Bohen its endorsement and instead gave it to Erie County Legislator Patrick B. Burke, the legislator who sponsored the county's ban on conversion therapy. The Erie County Republican Committee and its chairman, Nicholas A. Langworthy, endorsed Bohen and gave him operational support. In an April 24, 2018 special election, Bohen defeated Burke; he received 52% of the vote to Burke's 48% in a race in which less than 15% of eligible voters participated. Bohen planned to caucus with the Democrats in the Assembly. However, Democratic Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie stated that before Bohen could join that caucus, he would have to \\"prove\\" that he was a \\"true Democrat\\". Based on Bohen's outspoken support for Heastie, Republican Assembly Minority Leader Brian Kolb did not invite Bohen to join the Republican caucus. These two actions left Bohen as the only member of the Assembly without a home caucus. Bohen announced his intention to run for a full term in the November 2018 general election. He issued a press release stating that he could not \\"align himself\\" with Andrew Cuomo or the Democratic Party, and would run once more on the Republican line. Bohen lost his bid for election to a full term in a November 6, 2018 general election. He was defeated by his special election opponent, Patrick Burke.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. The building is a rare example of coursed, cobblestone construction, and is the only known commercial building in Michigan featuring this type of construction. History Rollin Sprague was born in Ontario County, New York in 1806. He moved with his family to Oakland County by 1821, and by 1831 was a prominent local physician. in that year, he opened a drug store in Rochester in a partnership with his father-in-law, David Cooper. The drugstore was located in what was previously Rochester's first schoolhouse, and remained in that building until 1849, when Sprague commissioned the construction of this building. The mason who built it was Thomas Anscomb, an English-born stonemason living in Troy Township. Dr. Sprague died in 1872 and left his business to his wife, Adeline Cooper Sprague. She continued to operate it until 1875, when she sold it to Barnes & Goodison, who operated it as a general store. In 1899, the front facade of the building was remodeled. Barnes & Goodison continued to use the building as a dry goods store and drug store until 1904. It later housed an auto dealership and a dairy. In 1947, Harry Schaefer and Donald Bennett opened the Scha-Ben bakery in the building, which later became the Home Bakery. The bakery has occupied the building since. Description The Rollin Sprague Building is a two-story gable front commercial building with walls of coursed cobblestone construction. The building sites on a fieldstone foundation The rear and side walls are of cobblestone with corner quoins, while the current front facade replicates a Late Victorian pressed metal facade constructed in 1899.

It depicts then-current President Barack Obama standing in front of the White House beside a destitute citizen while being haunted by figures of all past Presidents. The subject matter of the painting was inspired by the passage of the Affordable Care Act. McNaughton unveiled the painting in a YouTube video on September 14, 2010. It was the second in a series of politically charged portraits painted by McNaughton. Description The 43 men who as of 2010 had served as President of the United States are gathered in a park in front of the White House, above which the American flag can be seen, at half mast. In general, the 18th and 19th century presidents are on the left, the later ones on the right, some appear lost in thought while others, Bill Clinton and the two Roosevelts, are applauding. The only non-president in the painting is a young man, who sits alone on a park bench, hunched over in despair, contemplating his future. Some of the presidents, including Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Reagan reach out to him, while looking toward Barack Obama who stands in the foreground right. James Madison, the Father of the Constitution, is outraged by Obama's actions, for beneath Obama's foot is the U.S. Constitution. Scattered on the ground are dollar bills, laws and amendments that form part of the Bill of Rights. Reception and influence The painting gained initial notoriety in 2010 when it was featured on MSNBC television host Rachel Maddow's blog as part of a caption contest. In 2012, it drew satirical praise during an episode of The Colbert Report from Stephen Colbert's conservative persona. After being purchased by conservative commentator Sean Hannity in 2016, The Forgotten Man was rumored to have been bought as a gift for then President-elect Donald Trump, though a spokesperson for Fox News (Hannity's employer) later clarified that the painting was never intended to be given as a gift.

F. Klaveness & Co of Sandefjord. She was primarily employed as an ore carrier and collier doing tramp trade during her career. Design and Construction In March 1903 A. F. Klaveness & Co had a cargo ship SS Sangstad delivered which they planned to use on West India to North America route as a fruit carrier. On November 25, 1903 it was reported that SS Sangstad was removed from Norwegian registration and sold to Compa√±ia Mexicana de Navegaci√≥n, and an order for a new steamer with the same name was placed. The ship was laid down at Robert Thompson & Sons Southwick shipyard in Sunderland, launched on 16 May 1904 (yard number 233), with Mrs. Andresen, wife of the ships's commander Captain M. A. Andresen, being the sponsor. After successful completion of sea trials the ship was delivered to her owner in June 1904. On June 8, 1904 a new company (Dampskibsaktieselskabet \\"Sangstad\\"), a subsidiary of A. F. Klaveness & Co, with NOK 550,000 starting capital was registered in Larvik to operate the new vessel.

In July the ship conducted several trips up and down St. Lawrence river between Montreal and North Sydney. On August 5, 1905 Sangstad left Portland for Buenos Aires with a cargo of 636,000 feet of spruce timber. After arrival in Argentina the ship sailed back to North America and reached Philadelphia on December 18. On October 6, 1905 the charter with Tweedie Trading Company was extended for 3 more months at a rate of ¬£900 per calendar month. The vessel then was sub-chartered by the New York Central & Hudson River Railroad along with other ships to transport 10,000 tons of paving bricks and other construction materials to the Panama Canal area. The ship left New York on January 22, 1906 and arrived at Col√≥n a week later. After unloading, the ship proceeded back to the US via Cuban ports of C√°rdenas and Matanzas and arrived in Philadelphia on March 18. Sangstad was then subchartered to carry cotton to Europe, and continued to Wilmington arriving there on April 12. After loading 11,782 bales of cotton, the ship departed for Bremerhaven on May 1. Between June and September Sangstad was involved in iron ore transportation from Wabana to Philadelphia and Rotterdam. On her return journey from Europe she departed Stettin on November 6 with a cargo of sugar for Philadelphia, but ran into some heavy weather on her trip and arrived at St.John's on November 26 with significant damage about her decks and a broken rudder. She was put into dock for repairs which took about a month to finish delaying her arrival at Philadelphia until December 30, 1906. On January 15, 1907 the ship left Philadelphia for Col√≥n, and returned to New York on March 21 after visiting Cuban ports and New Orleans on her way back. The vessel was then employed in coal and iron ore trade for the remainder of the year. Sangstad left Norfolk with a cargo of coal for Col√≥n on April 1, and on her return voyage she called at Daiquir√≠ and sailed from it on April 24 with 5,375 tons of iron ore arriving at Baltimore on May 3. During the summer 1907 the ship was involved in coal carriage between Philadelphia and Tampico and iron ore from Cuba on her return journeys. During the fall and winter 1907 the vessel was employed on Baltimore-Col√≥n-Cuba-Baltimore trade route. For example, Sangstad brought 5,375 tons of iron ore from Cuba to Baltimore on September 22. On October 11 Sangstad left Newport News with 5,083 tons of coal bound for Col√≥n and from there proceeded to Cuba where the ship loaded 5,300 tons of iron ore and sailed for Baltimore reaching it on November 9. After unloading Sangard loaded 2,100 barrels of spikes and proceeded to Newport News where she took on 4,837 tons of coal and left for Col√≥n on November 20. On her return voyage the ship stopped at Daiquir√≠ and loaded 5,300 tons of iron ore for Baltimore which she reached on December 24, 1907.

The vessel then proceeded to Fernandina to load 2,300 tons of phosphate rock for Hamburg, then stopped at Savannah to load other cargo including 174 bales of cotton and left for Europe on February 20. Sangstad returned to North Sydney on April 28, and was employed on the coal trade route to Montreal and Quebec during the months of May and June 1908. For the rest of the year Sangstad was chartered to carry iron ore between Wabana and Middlesbrough. After finishing her charter, the ship sailed for Argentina on December 17 via Cadiz and arrived at Buenos Aires on January 28, 1909. Sangstad left Buenos Aires on her return voyage to Hamburg and Antwerp with a cargo of wheat on March 27 and arrived in Europe in early May.

It portrays patients suffering from aphasia and follows their experiences through their recoveries. Notable for its innovative artistic direction and empathetic approach to patients with aphasia, the film was added to the National Film Registry in 2015.  Plot  The film follows Marge Nelson (portrayed by Naomi Feil), a nurse who treats patients suffering from aphasia. Marge is overworked and unsympathetic towards her patients, experiencing frustration at their behavior and apparent inability to communicate. Upon having an accident and suffering brain damage, Marge herself experiences aphasia and undergoes treatment at the same hospital where she previously worked. While struggling to deal with the emotions around her trauma and new issues with processing information and communicating, Marge also discovers a startling lack of empathy from hospital staff and therapists treating her. Marge finds a new friend in a second patient who is suffering from aphasia. The film shows us that, like Marge, this second patient has also experienced a lack of empathy from others, except in his case it is his family members who are unable to understand his illness. Through this new friendship and her own determination, Marge changes the emotional direction of her life and takes the first steps towards her recovery.  Reception  The Inner World of Aphasia was praised by contemporary sources for its attention to patient experience, particularly for drawing attention to the ways in which patients treated for aphasia in the 1960s were dehumanized by hospital staff and family members. Compared to other media portrayals of aphasia the time, The Inner World of Aphasia was unique for its focus on portraying \\"the complex subjective feel of what it is like to be an aphasic.\\" Its use of flashback, optical distortions, and audio editing techniques were noted by medical professionals as accurately conveying the experience of a person suffering from aphasia (such as hemiplegia and hemianopsia).  Awards and Recognition  In 1968, The Inner World of Aphasia received the Golden Eagle from The Council on International Non-Theatrical Events (CINE), the organization's highest honor. In 1969, The American Journal of Nursing included The Inner World of Aphasia on its list of films screened by the American Nurses Association / National League of Nurses Film Committee and recommended for screening to nurses and nursing students. In 2015, The Inner World of Aphasia was added to the National Film Registry, a selection of films noted as worthy of preservation by the United States National Film Preservation Board.

It was written by Matthew Weiner and Robin Vieth; and was directed by Lesli Linka Glatter. The episode originally aired on September 14, 2008.  Plot  Betty Draper (January Jones) is struggling on how to confront Don Draper (Jon Hamm) on his recent affair with Bobbie Barrett (Melinda McGraw). Don and Betty are planning a dinner party for Crab Colson. Don tells Betty not to worry about it and he will make sure to get done the things on the list. Later that day, Betty sees that one of the chairs has a loose leg and bangs it repeatedly until it breaks into pieces. Back at the office, Harry Crain (Rich Sommer) is struggling to keep up with the work load as a head of television. When Roger denies his request for some help, Joan steps in. Joan is shown at home reading the scripts as her new fianc√© says she should be ‚Äúwatching those shows with a box of bon bons on her lap to soothe her craving‚Äù. She says she enjoys doing it. Later in the show, Roger tells Harry he can hire someone at $150 a week to help him. He calls Joan into his office to introduce her to the new hire and asks her if she can show him the ropes. Joan, clearly disappointed, explains the basic tasks and says she will be around. Father Gill asks Peggy Olson for her help jazzing up a flyer so the kids will come to the Catholic Young Organization dance. She comes up with the slogan ‚ÄúA Night to Remember‚Äù but is later disappointed when Father Gill calls to say that the ladies on the committee don‚Äôt like her slogan. They think it will cause trouble. Peggy insists that it is romantic and will get the girls to come, which will in turn get the boys to come. Peggy says, ‚ÄúI know better than them‚Äù. She agrees to meet with the committee which results in them still not being happy with her idea. She says she will see what she can do and pulls Father Gill aside. She explains that he asked for her expertise so he should be supporting her and he apologizes. Back at the Draper household, Betty has set up a ‚Äútrip around the world‚Äù with food from all around the world, including Heineken from Holland. This is ironic since Don said it would appeal to housewives and they all share a laugh about it. Duck asks if Don put her up to this and Don says no and that he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt even get to pick where he sits.\\" Betty, still not in on the joke, asks for an explanation. Duck says, ‚Äúhe said you were the market, and you are‚Äù. Betty laughs but shows she is not happy. After the dinner party she tells Don, ‚Äúyou embarrassed me‚Äù multiple times. We know this is not only about dinner but about the Bobbie situation as well. She works up the courage to blurt out she knows he is having an affair. He denies it, saying Jimmy would make that up because he hates them. Later that night, Betty wakes up Don and he claims he loves her and the kids and doesn‚Äôt want to lose all of it. Betty seems to have some compassion until the next day. As Betty is sitting at home, an Utz commercial with Jimmy Barrett comes on. This puts Betty over the edge, telling Don ‚Äúdon‚Äôt come home. I don‚Äôt care what you do, I just don‚Äôt want you here.‚Äù  Production  Series creator and executive producer Matthew Weiner wrote ‚ÄúA Night to Remember‚Äù together with Robin Veith. This episode was directed by Lesli Linka Glatter. In an interview with AMCTV, Weiner explains how in real life, there is a certain time to say things on your mind. He explains that sometimes you don‚Äôt know how to say it so it comes out of nowhere. Weiner also explains how the scene between Father Gills and Peggy is set up like a confessional, giving her the opportunity to share the truth, which she denies. Jon Hamm and January Jones, also share their own perspectives. Jones explains when she says, ‚Äúyou embarrassed me in front of all these people‚Äù, talking about the dinner party, she is deep down explaining in general with everything that happened with Bobbie Barrett. Hamm also explains how he is torn. He ‚Äúdesperately wants this to work and yet, he‚Äôs genuinely unsure of if he really loves his wife.‚Äù  Cultural References  Harry mentions the TV series show Love of Life (1951) while he‚Äôs talking with a client from Maytag, he tells them they should buy airtime during Love of Life because women will be watching and they like to fantasize about having active lifestyles. Joan mentions the TV series show As the World Turns (1956) to her husband after she‚Äôs been reading the scripts. She then brings it up again while talking to clients from Maytag, since she‚Äôs read the scripts she knows something big is coming. If they buy airtime with that now, they will be making more money when it gets really popular.  Reception  This episode had a total of 1.87 million viewers, which is a slight decline from 2.1 million the first episode of season two had. Alan Sepinwall, was a fan of how Christina Hendricks (Joan) was so perfect in the moment where Harry unwittingly delivered the news to Joan that Danny was taking over and Joan needed to fill him in on what she‚Äôd been doing. Noel Murray, writing for The A.V. Club in 2008, praised the episode for containing moments that were concise, funny, and character defining. Examples are when Betty smashed the wobbly chair from the dining room and when Peggy was pretending to be her own secretary. Dan Owen, from Dan‚Äôs Media Digest, wrote about how suitable the title of the episode was since it was the night that Betty confronts Don about his affairs, making it a real turning point in the series. The Chicago Tribune compliments how January Jones (Betty) has grown as an actress from the amount of intense work she had to do in this episode and how her performance was restrained, nuanced, and detailed.

It is located at a distance of circa 130 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 3147 is about 140,000 light years across. It was discovered by William Herschel on April 3, 1785.NGC 3147 cseligman.com It is a Type II Seyfert galaxy.  Structure  The galaxy has a small and bright nucleus and tightly wound multiple spiral arms. The overall appearance of the galaxy resembles that of NGC 488, however the nuclear bulge is smaller. The arms consist of spiral segments that branch after approximately one quarter of a revolution. HII regions can be detected in the arms. = Active galactic nucleus = NGC 3147 has been characterised as a Seyfert II galaxy. It is considered the best candidate to be a true type II Seyfert galaxy, galaxies which feature optical/UV spectrum lacking broad emission lines due to the lack of the broad line region rather than its obscuration, since the nucleus is simultaneously seen unobscured in the X-rays. The galaxy was observed stimultaneously in the optical and X-ray spectrum by Bianchi et al. and concluded that the X-ray spectrum is unabsorbed while its optical spectrum lacks broad lines, a mismatch with respect to the Unification Model. Birghtman et al. confirmed their findings and also noted that the hard X-ray flux dropped by a factor of ‚àº2 between the observation by Chandra (2001) and XMM- Newton (2006). Further flux variation was observed by Suzaku in 2010, confirming the variability of the source. The nuclear emission in the UV band shows negligible variability. Shi et al. used data from Spitzer Space Telescope and ground-based optical spectropolarimeteric observations and observed lack of polarised broad emission lines in NGC 3147. NGC 3147 was observed by NuSTAR at the 3-40 keV X-ray spectrum, which is characterised by a simple power-law, with a standard Œì ‚àº 1.7 and an iron emission line, with no need for any further component up to ‚àº 40 keV. There is a debate whether the lack of broad lines detection observed with NGC 3147 is caused by the presence of an Compton-thick column with the presence of a highly ionised reflactor to account for the X-ray spectrum or not. Bianchi et al. rejected the presence of a Compton thick column on the grounds of low-equivalent width of the iron KŒ± line (‚âÉ130 eV), and of the large ratio between hard X-ray and [O III] fluxes. Birghtman et al. confirmed their findings using data from XMM-Newton and Chandra. They also found that the X-ray flux is variable, meaning that the nucleus may be observed directly. However, they noted the presence of Compton- thick column cannot be ruled out. The observations by Suzaku in the hard X-rays spectrum didn't cast more light, but along with the observations performed by XMM-Newton put tight constraints on the column density. After the observations by NuStar in 2015, Bianchi et al. concluded that the spectral properties and the significant variability on time-scales as short as weeks strongly support an unobscured line-of-sight for the nucleus of NGC 3147 and the Compton-thick scenario is strongly disfavoured. = Central black hole with thin disk = Artist's impression of NGC 3147 black hole disc. In July 2019 researchers using the Hubble Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph reported the presence of a thin disk of material around a supermassive black hole at the center of NGC 3147. The black hole is 250 million times as massive as the Sun. Black holes at the center of galaxies of such low activity have been considered to be \\"malnourished\\" or \\"starving\\", that is, little or no material would be falling into the black hole to feed it. The presence of a disk that is similar to the much brighter disks surrounding the black hole of more active galaxies was surprising, since models of low activity galaxies did not predict it. The disk is also unusual because it is deep within the gravitational well of the black hole and rotates around it at more than 10% of the speed of light. Its high velocity results in the effect known as relativistic beaming, in which the light coming from the side moving toward the Earth is brighter than that coming from the side that is receding.\\"Hubble discovers mysterious black hole disc\\", ESA/Hubble Information Center news release, 11 July 2019.\\"Hubble uncovers black hole that shouldn't exist\\", NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center news release, 11 July 2019.

It extends the size of virtual addresses from 48 bits to 57 bits, increasing the addressable virtual memory from 256 TiB to 128 PiB. The extension was first implemented in the Ice Lake processors, and the 4.14 Linux kernel adds support for it.  Technology  x86-64 processors without this feature use a four-level page table structure when operating in 64-bit mode. A similar situation arose when the 32 bit IA-32 processors used two levels, allowing up to four GiB of memory (both virtual and physical). To support more than 4 GB of RAM, an additional mode of address translation called Physical Address Extension (PAE) was defined, involving a third level. This was enabled by setting a bit in the CR4 register. Likewise, the new extension is enabled by setting bit 12 of the CR4 register (known as LA57). This is only used when the processor is operating in 64 bit mode, and only may be modified when it is not. If the bit is not set, the processor operates with four paging levels. As adding another page table multiplies the address space by 512, the virtual limit has increased from 256 TiB to 128 PiB. An extra nine bits of the virtual address index the new table, so while formerly bits 0 through 47 were in use, now bits 0 through 56 are in use. As with four level paging, the high-order bits of a virtual address that do not participate in address translation must be the same as the most significant implemented bit. With five-level paging enabled, this means that bits 57 through 63 must be copies of bit 56. Intel has renamed the existing paging system as \\"4-level paging\\", which used to be known as IA-32e paging. Extending page table entry to 128 bits allows full 64-bit address space in 4-level paging scheme, and makes possible arbitrary allocation unit sizes in 5-level scheme.  Implementation  5-level paging is implemented by the Ice Lake microarchitecture. Support for the extension was submitted as a set of patches to the Linux kernel on 8 December 2016. As was reported on the Linux kernel mailing list, it consisted of extending the Linux memory model to use five levels rather than four. This is because, although Linux abstracts the details of the page tables, it still depends on having a number of levels in its own representation. When an architecture supports fewer levels, Linux emulates extra levels that do nothing. A similar change was previously made to extend from three levels to four.  Drawbacks  Adding another level of indirection makes page table \\"walks\\" longer. A page table walk occurs when either the processor's memory management unit or the memory management code in the operating system navigates the tree of page tables to find the page table entry corresponding to a virtual address. This means that, in the worst case, the processor or the memory manager has to access physical memory six times for a single virtual memory access, rather than five for the previous iteration of x86-64 processors. This results in slightly reduced memory access speed. In practice this cost is greatly mitigated by caches such as the translation lookaside buffer (TLB). Further extensions may reduce page walks by using 4096 128-bit page table entries, and allow a larger 64 KiB page allocation size and backward compatibility with 4 KiB page operations.

Here it is restricted to a small rocky area in the mountainous south west of the country, near the border with Tanzania. =Discovery and history in cultivation= Aloe juvenna clump in cultivation Aloe juvenna clump in cultivation It has long been common in cultivation, but its origin was not known. The first recorded cultivated specimens were in South Africa, but although there were rumours that it had come from Kenya, its origins were a mystery even then. It was first believed to be a juvenile Aloe, due to its small size, and it was labelled \\"juvenna\\" (\\"juvenile\\") for this reason. However that label eventually became its formal name. Later, it was thought to be a hybrid perhaps of Aloe distans with Haworthia coarctata or a species of Astroloba. It underwent genetic testing in the 1970s and, when it was discovered that Aloe juvenna had a doubled set of chromosomes (tetraploidy), it came to seem more likely that this Aloe came from East Africa, where most other tetraploid Aloes originate. The name Aloe juvenna was finally published as a valid species name in 1979. Finally, in 1982, an expedition in the far south west of Kenya discovered a few plants on a tiny rocky mountainous ridge, high about tropical rainforest. The existence of these plants in such a remote locality confirmed that the species was a natural one. However, how it originally came to be brought into cultivation in the first place, remains a mystery.Aloe juvenna rediscovered - 1982.Brandham, P.E., Carter, S. (1982) Aloe juvenna rediscovered. Cactus and Succulent Journal of Great Britain, 44,70. Identification Aloe squarrosa from Socotra. Aloe juvenna is often confused with this species, but Aloe squarrosa has only a few, long, recurved leaves. Aloe juvenna is frequently confused with Aloe squarrosa from the island of Socotra. However Aloe squarrosa has long, smooth, spotted leaves that curve backwards. These recurved leaves are kept only around the head or top of each stem, with dead leaves falling off the lower parts of the stem. It is relatively rare in cultivation. Aloe juvenna has many short, straight, compact triangular leaves, which are densely packed all along the stems. It is common in cultivation but extremely rare in habitat. Aloe juvenna is also a tetraploid, with a double set of chromosomes (28, instead of 14) and, in appearance, does not resemble any other Aloe species from the region.http://www.llifle.com/Encyclopedia/SUCCULENTS/Family/Aloaceae/636/Aloe_juvennahttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/232689307_Distribution_diversity_and_conservation_of_the_genus_Aloe_in_Kenya References juvenna Category:Endemic flora of Kenya ","title":"Aloe juvenna"},{"id":"57233049","title":"The Best So Far... 2018 Tour Edition"},{"id":"57233087","text":"Numerous studies around the world have found a relationship between socioeconomic status and mental health. There are higher rates of mental illness in groups with lower socioeconomic status (SES), but there is no clear consensus on the exact causative factors. The two principal models that attempt to explain this relationship are the social causation theory, which posits that socioeconomic inequality causes stress that gives rise to mental illness, and the downward drift approach, which assumes that people predisposed to mental illness are reduced in socioeconomic status as a result of the illness. Most literature on these concepts dates back to the mid-1990s and leans heavily towards the social causation model. Social causation The social causation theory is an older theory with more evidence and research behind it. This hypothesis states that one's socioeconomic status (SES) is the cause of weakening mental functions. As Perry writes in The Journal of Primary Prevention, \\"members of the lower social classes experience excess psychological stress and relatively few societal rewards, the results of which are manifested in psychological disorder\\". The excess stress that people with low SES experience could be inadequate health care, job insecurity, and poverty, which can bring about many other psycho-social and physical stressors like crowding, discrimination, crime, etc. Thus, lower SES predisposes individuals to the development of a mental illness. =Research= The Faris and Dunham (1939), Hollingshead and Redlich (1958), and Midtown Manhattan (1962) studies are three of the most influential in the debate between social causation and downward drift. They lend important evidence to the linear correlation between mental illness and SES, more specifically that a low SES produces a mental illness. The higher rates of mental illness in lower SES are likely due to the greater stress individuals experience. Issues that are not experienced in high SES, such as lack of housing, hunger, unemployment, etc., contribute to the psychological stress levels that can lead to the onset of mental illness. Additionally, while experiencing greater stress levels, there are fewer societal rewards and resources for those at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder. The moderate economics assets available to those just one level above the lowest socioeconomic group allows them to take preventative action or treatment for psychoses. However, the hypothesis of the social causation model is disputed by the downward drift model. Faris and Dunham (1939) Faris and Dunham analyzed the prevalence of mental disorders, including schizophrenia, in different areas of Chicago. The researchers plotted the homes of patients preceding their admission to hospitals. They found a remarkable increase of cases from the outskirts of the city moving inwards to the center. This reflected other rates of distributions, such as unemployment, poverty and family desertion. They also found that cases of schizophrenia were most pervasive in public housing neighborhoods as well as communities with higher numbers of immigrants. This was one of the first empirical, evidence-based studies supporting social causation theory. Hollingshead and Redlich (1958) Hollingshead and Redlich conducted a study in New Haven, Connecticut, that was considered a major breakthrough in this field of research. The authors identified anyone who was hospitalized or in treatment for mental illness by looking at files from clinics, hospitals, and the like. They were able to design a valid and reliable construct to relate these findings to social class using education and occupation as measures for five social class groups. Their results showed high disproportions of schizophrenia among the lowest social group. They also found that the lower people were on the scale of social class, the likelier they were to be admitted to a hospital for psychosis. Midtown Manhattan Study (1962) The study by Srole, Langner, Micheal, Oplear, and Rennie, known as the Midtown Manhattan Study, has become a quintessential study in mental health. The main focus of the research was to \\"uncover [the] unknown portion of mental illness which is submerged in the community and thus hidden from sociological and psychiatric investigators alike\\". The researchers managed to probe deep into the community to include subjects usually left out of such studies. The experimenters used both parental and personal SES to investigate the correlation between mental illness and social class. When basing their results on parental SES, approximately 33 percent of Midtown inhabitants in the lowest SES showed some signs of impairments in mental functioning while only 18 percent of the inhabitants in the highest SES showed these signs. When assessing the relationship based on personal SES, 47 percent of inhabitants in the lowest SES showed signs of weakening mental functions while only 13 percent of the highest SES demonstrated these symptoms. These findings remained the same for all ages and genders. Downward drift In contrast to social causation, downward drift (also known as social selection) postulates that there is likely a genetic component that causes the onset of mental illness which may then lead to \\"a drift down into or fail to rise out of lower SES groups\\". This means that a person's SES level is a consequence rather than a cause of weakening mental functions. The downward drift theory shows promise specifically for individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. =Research= Weich and Lewis (1998) The Weich and Lewis study was conducted in the United Kingdom where researchers looked at 7,725 adults who had developed mental illnesses. They found that while low SES and unemployment may increase the length of psychiatric episodes they did not increase the likelihood of the initial psychotic break. Isohanni et al. (2001) In the Isohanni et al. longitudinal study in Finland, the researchers looked at patients treated in hospitals for mental disorders and who were aged between 16 and 29. The study followed the patients for 31 years and looked at how their illness affected their educational achievement. The study had a total of 80 patients and it compared patients who had been treated in the hospital for diagnoses of schizophrenia, and other psychotic or non-psychotic diagnoses, to those of the same 1966 birth cohort who had received no psychiatric treatment. They found that individuals who were hospitalized at 22 years or younger (early onset) were more likely to only complete a basic level of education and remain stagnant. Some patients were able to complete secondary education, but none advanced to tertiary education. Those who had not been hospitalized had lower completion rates of basic education but much higher percentages of completing both secondary and tertiary education, 62% and 26%, respectively. This study suggests that mental disorders, especially schizophrenia, impede educational achievement. The inability to complete higher education may be one of the possible contributors to the downward drift in SES by individuals with mental illness. Wiersma, Giel, De Jong and Slooff (1983) The researchers in the Wiersma, Giel, De Jong and Slooff study looked at both educational and occupational attainment of patients with psychosis compared to their fathers. Researchers assessed both topic areas in the fathers as well as in the patients. In a two-year follow-up, the downward mobility in both education and occupation was greater than expected in the patients. Only a small percentage of patients were able to keep their job or find a new one after the onset of psychosis. Most of the individuals participating in the study had a lower SES than when they were born. This study also showed that the drift may begin with prodromal symptoms rather than at full onset. Debate Many researchers argue against the downward drift model, because unlike its counterpart, \\"it does not address the psychological stress of being impoverished and fails to validate that persistent economic stress can lead to psychological disturbance\\". Mirowsky and Ross discuss in their book, Social Causes of Psychological Distress, that stress frequently stems from lack of control, or the feeling of lack of control, over one's life. Those in lower SES have a minimal sense of control over the events that occur in their lives. They argue that lack of control does not only stem from jobs with low income, but that \\"minority status also lowers the sense of control, partly because of lower education, income, and unemployment, and partly because any given level of achievement requires greater effort and provides fewer opportunities\\". The arguments posed in their book support social causation since such high stress levels are involved. Although both models can be existing, they do not need to be mutually exclusive, researchers tend to agree that downward drift has more relevance to someone diagnosed with schizophrenia. =Implications for schizophrenia= Although social causation can explain some forms of mental illnesses, downward drift \\"has the greatest empirical support and is one of the cardinal features of schizophrenia\\". The downward drift theory is more applicable to schizophrenia for a number of reasons. There are varying degrees of the disease, but once a psychotic break is experienced, the person often cannot function at the same level as before. This impairment affects all areas of life‚Äîeducation, occupation, social and family connections, etc. Due to the many challenges, patients will likely drift to a lower SES because they are unable to keep up with previous standards. Another reason why the downward drift theory is preferred is that, unlike other mental illnesses such as depression, once someone is diagnosed with schizophrenia they have the diagnosis for life. While symptoms may not be constant, \\"individuals with this diagnosis often experience cycles of remission and relapse throughout their lives\\". This explains the large discrepancy between the incidence of schizophrenia and prevalence of the disease. There is a very low rate of new cases of schizophrenia in comparison to the number of total cases because \\"it often starts in early adult life and becomes chronic\\". Patients will usually function at a lower level once the illness has manifested itself. Even with the help of antipsychotic medication and psycho-social support, most patients will still experience some symptoms making moving up out of a lower SES nearly impossible. Another possible explanation discussed in literature regarding the relation between the downward drift theory and schizophrenia is the stigma associated with mental illness. Individuals with mental illness are often treated differently, usually negatively, by their community. Although great strides have been made, mental illness is often unfavorably stigmatized. As Livingston explains, \\"stigma can produce a negative spiraling effect on the life course of people with mental illnesses, which tends to create...a decline in social class\\". Individuals who develop schizophrenia cannot function at the level they are used to, and \\"are particularly likely to experience the effects of ostracism, being amongst the most stigmatized of all the mental illnesses.\\" The complete exclusion they experience helps to maintain their new lower status, preventing any upward mobility. The downward drift theory may be mainly applicable to schizophrenia; however, it may also apply to other mental illnesses since each is accompanied by a negative stigma. While it can be hard to maintain status once the schizophrenia appears, some individuals are able to resist a downward drift, particularly if they start out at a higher SES. For example, if a person is from a high SES, they have the ability to access preventative resources and possible treatment for the disease which can help buffer the drift downwards and help maintain their status. It is also important for those with schizophrenia to have a strong network of friends and family because friends and family may notice signs of the illness before full onset. For example, individuals that are married show less of a drift downwards than those who are not. Individuals who do not have a support system may show early signs of psychotic symptoms that go unnoticed and untreated.

It reaches 6-7 meters in height. It is very similar in appearance to the much more common Adonidia merrillii with the chief visual differences being a slightly more golden coloration, more slender trunk, more upright inflorescence, thinner leaves, and less clefted trunks. However, the basic overall appearance is quite similar and, given the relatively short biological distance between Sabah and Palawan, suggests a recent speciation in the past few million years or less. Notably, this species, though critically endangered, may be the older of the two. First discovered in 1998 from a mere 14 individuals in the wild, it took some time to ascertain the scientific aspect of this species. This was in part due to the process of allowing the collected seeds to grow and mature at Sabah's Forest Research Centre. Over time, differences between this species and Adondia merrillii became evident. It was finally described scientifically in 2015.

It is found in deep waters in the Atlantic Ocean, burrowing in the mud. Distribution and habitat Molpadia musculus is found in the northern Atlantic Ocean at depths of about . It lives buried in the mud on the seabed with its anterior (mouth end) directed downwards and its posterior (rear end) on the surface of the sediment. This sea cucumber can be very common on the deep seabed, with up to 220 per square metre having been recorded. Ecology Molpadia musculus is a detritivore, ingesting the mud through which it burrows, extracting the nutritious fragments as the mud passes through the gut and voiding the rest onto the surface of the sediment. The mud has a high content of bacteria, archaea and other prokaryote organisms, especially the top centimetre. There is also a large diversity of micro-organisms present in the sea cucumber's gut, however, research has shown that the fauna of the gut are different from the fauna present in the sediment. To provide an explanation for this, the researchers hypothesized that the fauna in the gut were living there as commensals, to the mutual benefit of themselves and the sea cucumber. It seems that the sea cucumber does not need to build up a gut community of bacteria where the sediment is rich in organic matter, as in the Nazar√© Canyon, but such a community is necessary where the sediment quality is poor as in the Cascais Canyon. Like other sea cucumbers, Molpadia musculus is gonochoric, with separate sexes. Fertilisation is external, the larvae are planktonic and settle on the seabed when sufficiently developed, undergoing metamorphosis into juveniles.

They are found above the kidneys. *Allergy ‚Äì Allergies, also known as allergic diseases, are a number of conditions caused by hypersensitivity of the immune system to typically harmless substances in the environment. These diseases include hay fever, food allergies, atopic dermatitis, allergic asthma, and anaphylaxis. Symptoms may include red eyes, an itchy rash, sneezing, a runny nose, shortness of breath, or swelling. Food intolerances and food poisoning are separate conditions. *ADHD ‚Äì Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. *Alzheimer's disease ‚Äì (AD), also referred to simply as Alzheimer's, is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and worsens over time. It is the cause of 60‚Äì70% of cases of dementia. The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events (short-term memory loss). *Anal canal ‚Äì is the terminal part of the large intestine. It is situated between the rectum and anus, below the level of the pelvic diaphragm. In humans it is approximately 2.5 to 4 cm (0.98-1.58 in) long. It lies in the anal triangle of perineum in between the right and left ischioanal fossa. *Anatomy ‚Äì is the branch of biology concerned with the study of the structure of organisms and their parts.Merriam Webster Dictionary Anatomy is a branch of natural science which deals with the structural organization of living things. *Anesthesiology ‚Äì Anesthesiology, anaesthesiology, anaesthesia or anaesthetics (see Terminology) is the medical speciality concerned with the total perioperative care of patients before, during and after surgery. *Angiology ‚Äì is the medical specialty which studies the diseases of the circulatory system and of the lymphatic system, i.e., arteries, veins and lymphatic vessels, and its diseases. *Ankle ‚Äì The ankle, or the talocrural region, is the region where the foot and the leg meet. The ankle includes three joints: the ankle joint proper or talocrural joint, the subtalar joint, and the inferior tibiofibular joint. The movements produced at this joint are dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of the foot. In common usage, the term ankle refers exclusively to the ankle region. In medical terminology, \\"ankle\\" (without qualifiers) can refer broadly to the region or specifically to the talocrural joint. *Anterior tibial artery ‚Äì The anterior tibial artery of the leg carries blood to the anterior compartment of the leg and dorsal surface of the foot, from the popliteal artery. *Antibiotic ‚Äì is a type of antimicrobial substance active against bacteria and is the most important type of antibacterial agent for fighting bacterial infections. Antibiotic medications are widely used in the treatment and prevention of such infections. *Antibody ‚Äì (Ab), also known as an immunoglobulin (Ig), is a large, Y-shaped protein produced mainly by plasma cells that is used by the immune system to neutralize pathogens such as pathogenic bacteria and viruses. *Aorta ‚Äì is the main artery in the human body, originating from the left ventricle of the heart and extending down to the abdomen, where it splits into two smaller arteries (the common iliac arteries). The aorta distributes oxygenated blood to all parts of the body through the systemic circulation. *Appendix ‚Äì *Arm ‚Äì is the part of the upper limb between the glenohumeral joint (shoulder joint) and the elbow joint. In common usage, the arm extends to the hand. It can be divided into the upper arm, which extends from the shoulder to the elbow, the forearm which extends from the elbow to the hand, and the hand. Anatomically the shoulder girdle with bones and corresponding muscles is by definition a part of the arm. The Latin term brachium may refer to either the arm as a whole or to the upper arm on its own. *Arteriole ‚Äì is a small-diameter blood vessel in the microcirculation that extends and branches out from an artery and leads to capillaries. Arterioles have muscular walls (usually only one to two layers of smooth muscle) and are the primary site of vascular resistance. The greatest change in blood pressure and velocity of blood flow occurs at the transition of arterioles to capillaries. *Artery ‚Äì is a blood vessel that takes blood away from the heart to all parts of the body (tissues, lungs, etc). Most arteries carry oxygenated blood; the two exceptions are the pulmonary and the umbilical arteries, which carry deoxygenated blood to the organs that oxygenate it. The effective arterial blood volume is that extracellular fluid which fills the arterial system. *Arthritis ‚Äì is a term often used to mean any disorder that affects joints. Symptoms generally include joint pain and stiffness. Other symptoms may include redness, warmth, swelling, and decreased range of motion of the affected joints. *AS ‚Äì Asperger syndrome. *Asperger syndrome ‚Äì (AS), also known as Asperger's, is a developmental disorder characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. As a milder autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it differs from other ASDs by relatively normal language and intelligence. Although not required for diagnosis, physical clumsiness and unusual use of language are common. *Asthma ‚Äì is a common long-term inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs. It is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and bronchospasm. Symptoms include episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. *Atrial fibrillation ‚Äì (AF or A-fib) is an abnormal heart rhythm characterized by rapid and irregular beating of the atria. Often it starts as brief periods of abnormal beating which become longer and possibly constant over time. Often episodes have no symptoms. *Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ‚Äì is a mental disorder of the neurodevelopmental type. It is characterized by problems paying attention, excessive activity, or difficulty controlling behavior which is not appropriate for a person's age.\\"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder\\". National Institute of Mental Health. March 2016. Archived from the original on 23 July 2016. Retrieved 5 March 2016 *Auscultation ‚Äì is listening to the internal sounds of the body, usually using a stethoscope. Auscultation is performed for the purposes of examining the circulatory and respiratory systems (heart and breath sounds), as well as the gastrointestinal system. *Autism ‚Äì is a developmental disorder characterized by troubles with social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice signs during the first two or three years of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace before worsening. *Axilla ‚Äì (also, armpit, underarm or oxter) is the area on the human body directly under the joint where the arm connects to the shoulder. It also provides the under-arm sweat gland. *Axillary artery ‚Äì is a large blood vessel that conveys oxygenated blood to the lateral aspect of the thorax, the axilla (armpit) and the upper limb. Its origin is at the lateral margin of the first rib, before which it is called the subclavian artery. B *Back ‚Äì The human back is the large posterior area of the human body, rising from the top of the buttocks to the back of the neck and the shoulders. It is the surface of the body opposite from the chest. The vertebral column runs the length of the back and creates a central area of recession. The breadth of the back is created by the shoulders at the top and the pelvis at the bottom. *Back pain ‚Äì is pain felt in the back. It is divided into neck pain (cervical), middle back pain (thoracic), lower back pain (lumbar) or coccydynia (tailbone or sacral pain) based on the segment affected. The lumbar area is the most common area for pain, as it supports most of the weight in the upper body.Church E, Odle T. Diagnosis and treatment of back pain. Radiologic Technology [serial online]. November 2007;79(2):126-204. Available from: CINAHL Plus with Full Text, Ipswich, MA. Accessed December 12, 2017. Episodes of back pain may be acute, sub-acute, or chronic depending on the duration. The pain may be characterized as a dull ache, shooting or piercing pain, or a burning sensation. Discomfort can radiate into the arms and hands as well as the legs or feet, and may include numbness, or weakness in the legs and arms. *Beta cell ‚Äì Beta cells (Œ≤ cells) are a type of cell found in pancreatic islets that synthesize and secrete insulin. Beta cells make up 50-70% of the cells in human islets. In patients with type I or type II diabetes, beta-cell mass and function are diminished, leading to insufficient insulin secretion and hyperglycemia. *Biceps ‚Äì also biceps brachii (Latin for \\"two-headed muscle of the arm\\"), is a large muscle that lies on the front of the upper arm between the shoulder and the elbow. Both heads of the muscle arise on the scapula and join to form a single muscle belly which is attached to the upper forearm. While the biceps crosses both the shoulder and elbow joints, its main function is at the elbow where it flexes the forearm and supinates the forearm. Both these movements are used when opening a bottle with a corkscrew: first biceps unscrews the cork (supination), then it pulls the cork out (flexion). *Biceps brachii ‚Äì The biceps, also biceps brachii (Latin for \\"two-headed muscle of the arm\\"), is a large muscle that lies on the front of the upper arm between the shoulder and the elbow.

Both these movements are used when opening a bottle with a corkscrew: first biceps unscrews the cork (supination), then it pulls the cork out (flexion). *Bile duct ‚Äì is any of a number of long tube-like structures that carry bile. Bile, required for the digestion of food, is secreted by the liver into passages that carry bile toward the hepatic duct, which joins with the cystic duct (carrying bile to and from the gallbladder) to form the common bile duct, which opens into the intestine. *Biliary tract ‚Äì The biliary tract, (biliary tree or biliary system) refers to the liver, gall bladder and bile ducts, and how they work together to make, store and secrete bile. Bile consists of water, electrolytes, bile acids, cholesterol, phospholipids and conjugated bilirubin. Some components are synthesised by hepatocytes (liver cells), the rest are extracted from the blood by the liver. *Binge eating disorder ‚Äì (BED), is an eating disorder characterized by frequent and recurrent binge eating episodes with associated negative psychological and social problems, but without subsequent purging episodes (e.g. vomiting). BED is a recently described condition, which was required to distinguish binge eating similar to that seen in bulimia nervosa but without characteristic purging. Individuals who are diagnosed with bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder exhibit similar patterns of compulsive overeating, neurobiological features of dysfunctional cognitive control and food addiction, and biological and environmental risk factors. Indeed, some consider BED a milder version of bulimia, and that the conditions are on the same spectrum. *Biological engineering ‚Äì or bioengineering/bio-engineering, is the application of principles of biology and the tools of engineering to create usable, tangible, economically viable products. Biological engineering employs knowledge and expertise from a number of pure and applied sciences, such as mass and heat transfer, kinetics, biocatalysts, biomechanics, bioinformatics, separation and purification processes, bioreactor design, surface science, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, and polymer science. It is used in the design of medical devices, diagnostic equipment, biocompatible materials, renewable bioenergy, ecological engineering, agricultural engineering, and other areas that improve the living standards of societies. *Biology ‚Äì is the natural science that studies life and living organisms, including their physical structure, chemical processes, molecular interactions, physiological mechanisms, development and evolution.Based on definition from: *Biochemistry ‚Äì sometimes called biological chemistry, is the study of chemical processes within and relating to living organisms. *Bioinformatics ‚Äì is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data. As an interdisciplinary field of science, bioinformatics combines biology, computer science, information engineering, mathematics and statistics to analyze and interpret biological data. *Biopsy ‚Äì is a medical test commonly performed by a surgeon, interventional radiologist, or an interventional cardiologist involving extraction of sample cells or tissues for examination to determine the presence or extent of a disease. *Biostatistics ‚Äì are the application of statistics to a wide range of topics in biology. It encompasses the design of biological experiments, especially in medicine, pharmacy, agriculture and fishery; the collection, summarization, and analysis of data from those experiments; and the interpretation of, and inference from, the results. A major branch is medical biostatistics, which is exclusively concerned with medicine and health. *Bipolar disorder ‚Äì is a mental disorder that causes periods of depression and periods of abnormally elevated moodAmerican Psychiatry Association (2013). Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.). Arlington: American Psychiatric Publishing. pp. 123‚Äì154. *Birth control ‚Äì also known as contraception and fertility control, is a method or device used to prevent pregnancy. *Bladder cancer ‚Äì is any of several types of cancer arising from the tissues of the urinary bladder. It is a disease in which cells grow abnormally and have the potential to spread to other parts of the body. Symptoms include blood in the urine, pain with urination, and low back pain. *Blood pressure ‚Äì is the pressure of circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels. Used without further specification, \\"blood pressure\\" usually refers to the pressure in large arteries of the systemic circulation. Blood pressure is usually expressed in terms of the systolic pressure (maximum during one heartbeat) over diastolic pressure (minimum in between two heartbeats) and is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg), above the surrounding atmospheric pressure. *Blood vessel ‚Äì The blood vessels are the part of the circulatory system, and microcirculation, that transports blood throughout the human body. *Bone ‚Äì is a rigid organ that constitutes part of the vertebrate skeleton. Bones support and protect the various organs of the body, produce red and white blood cells, store minerals, provide structure and support for the body, and enable mobility. Bones come in a variety of shapes and sizes and have a complex internal and external structure. They are lightweight yet strong and hard, and serve multiple functions. *Bone marrow ‚Äì is a semi-solid tissue which may be found within the spongy or cancellous portions of bones. Bone marrow is the primary site of new blood cell production or hematopoiesis. It is composed of hematopoietic cells, marrow adipose tissue, and supportive stromal cells. In adult humans, bone marrow is primarily located in the ribs, vertebrae, sternum, and bones of the pelvis. On average, bone marrow constitutes 4% of the total body mass of humans; in an adult having 65 kilograms of mass (143 lb), bone marrow typically accounts for approximately . *Brachial artery ‚Äì is the major blood vessel of the (upper) arm. It is the continuation of the axillary artery beyond the lower margin of teres major muscle. It continues down the ventral surface of the arm until it reaches the cubital fossa at the elbow. It then divides into the radial and ulnar arteries which run down the forearm. In some individuals, the bifurcation occurs much earlier and the ulnar and radial arteries extend through the upper arm. The pulse of the brachial artery is palpable on the anterior aspect of the elbow, medial to the tendon of the biceps, and, with the use of a stethoscope and sphygmomanometer (blood pressure cuff) often used to measure the blood pressure. *Brachial plexus ‚Äì is a network of nerves formed by the ventral rami of the lower four cervical nerves and first thoracic nerve (C5, C6, C7, C8, and T1). This plexus extends from the spinal cord, through the cervicoaxillary canal in the neck, over the first rib, and into the armpit. It supplies afferent and efferent nerve fibers to the chest, shoulder, arm and hand. *Brachial veins ‚Äì In human anatomy, the brachial veins are venae comitantes of the brachial artery in the arm proper. Because they are deep to muscle, they are considered deep veins. Their course is that of the brachial artery (in reverse): they begin where radial veins and ulnar veins join (corresponding to the bifurcation of the brachial artery). They end at the inferior border of the teres major muscle. At this point, the brachial veins join the basilic vein to form the axillary vein. The brachial veins also have small tributaries that drain the muscles of the upper arm, such as biceps brachii muscle and triceps brachii muscle. *Brachioradialis ‚Äì is a muscle of the forearm that flexes the forearm at the elbow. It is also capable of both pronation and supination, depending on the position of the forearm. It is attached to the distal styloid process of the radius by way of the brachioradialis tendon, and to the lateral supracondylar ridge of the humerus. *Bradycardia ‚Äìis a condition typically defined wherein an individual has a resting heart rate of under 60 beats per minute (BPM) in adults. *Brain ‚Äì The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system, and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system. The brain consists of the cerebrum, the brainstem and the cerebellum. It controls most of the activities of the body, processing, integrating, and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs, and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body. The brain is contained in, and protected by, the skull bones of the head. *Brain tumor ‚Äì occurs when abnormal cells form within the brain. There are two main types of tumors: malignant or cancerous tumors and benign tumors. *Brain metastasis ‚Äì is a cancer that has metastasized (spread) to the brain from another location in the body and is therefore considered a secondary brain tumor. The metastasis typically shares a cancer cell type with the original site of the cancer. *Breast ‚Äì The breast is one of two prominences located on the upper ventral region of the torso of primates. In females, it serves as the mammary gland, which produces and secretes milk to feed infants. Both females and males develop breasts from the same embryological tissues. At puberty, estrogens, in conjunction with growth hormone, cause breast development in female humans and to a much lesser extent in other primates. Breast development in other primate females generally only occurs with pregnancy. *Breast cancer ‚Äì is cancer that develops from breast tissue. Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, a newly inverted nipple, or a red or scaly patch of skin. In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin. *Broca's area ‚Äì or the Broca area, is a region in the frontal lobe of the dominant hemisphere, usually the left, of the brain with functions linked to speech production. *Bronchiole ‚Äì The bronchioles or bronchioli are the passageways by which air passes through the nose or mouth to the alveoli (air sacs) of the lungs, in which branches no longer contain cartilage or glands in their submucosa. They are branches of the bronchi, and are part of the conducting zone of the respiratory system. The bronchioles divide further into smaller terminal bronchioles which are still in the conducting zone and these then divide into the smaller respiratory bronchioles which mark the beginning of the respiratory region. *Bronchus ‚Äì A bronchi is a passage of airway in the respiratory system that conducts air into the lungs. The first bronchi to branch from the trachea are the right main bronchus and the left main bronchus. These are the widest and enter the lungs at each hilum, where they branch into narrower secondary bronchi known as lobar bronchi, and these branch into narrower tertiary bronchi known as segmental bronchi. Further divisions of the segmental bronchi are known as 4th order, 5th order, and 6th order segmental bronchi, or grouped together as subsegmental bronchi. The bronchi when too narrow to be supported by cartilage are known as bronchioles. No gas exchange takes place in the bronchi. *Bruit ‚Äì also called vascular murmur, is the abnormal sound generated by turbulent flow of blood in an artery due to either an area of partial obstruction or a localized high rate of blood flow through an unobstructed artery. *Bulimia nervosa ‚Äì also known as simply bulimia, is an eating disorder characterized by binge eating followed by purging.\\"Bulimia nervosa fact sheet\\". Office on Women's Health. July 16, 2012. Archived from the original on 19 June 2015. Retrieved 27 June 2015. Binge eating refers to eating a large amount of food in a short amount of time. Purging refers to the attempts to get rid of the food consumed. *Buttocks ‚Äì are two rounded portions of the anatomy, located on the posterior of the pelvic region and comprise a layer of fat superimposed on the gluteus maximus and gluteus medius muscles. Physiologically, the buttocks enable weight to be taken off the feet while sitting. C *Calcium ‚Äì Calcium ions (Ca2+) contribute to the physiology and biochemistry of organisms and the cell.

Many enzymes require calcium ions as a cofactor, those of the blood-clotting cascade being notable examples. Extracellular calcium is also important for maintaining the potential difference across excitable cell membranes, as well as proper bone formation. *Calf ‚Äì is the back portion of the lower leg in human anatomy. The muscles within the calf correspond to the posterior compartment of the leg. The two largest muscles within this compartment are known together as the calf muscle and attach to the heel via the Achilles tendon. Several other, smaller muscles attach to the knee, the ankle, and via long tendons to the toes. *Cancer ‚Äì is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body.\\"Cancer\\". World Health Organization. 12 September 2018. Retrieved 19 December 2018.\\"Defining Cancer\\". National Cancer Institute. 17 September 2007. Retrieved 28 March 2018. These contrast with benign tumors, which do not spread to other parts of the body. *Capillary ‚Äì is a small blood vessel from 5 to 10 micrometres (¬µm) in diameter, and having a wall one endothelial cell thick. They are the smallest blood vessels in the body: they convey blood between the arterioles and venules. These microvessels are the site of exchange of many substances with the interstitial fluid surrounding them. *Carcinogen ‚Äì is any substance, radionuclide, or radiation that promotes carcinogenesis, the formation of cancer. This may be due to the ability to damage the genome or to the disruption of cellular metabolic processes. *Carcinogenesis ‚Äì also called oncogenesis or tumorigenesis, is the formation of a cancer, whereby normal cells are transformed into cancer cells. *Cardiac arrest ‚Äì a sudden loss of blood flow resulting from the failure of the heart to effectively pump. Symptoms include loss of consciousness and abnormal or absent breathing. Some individuals may experience chest pain, shortness of breath, or nausea before cardiac arrest. If not treated within minutes, it typically leads to death. *Cardiac catheterization ‚Äì (heart cath or just cath), is the insertion of a catheter into a chamber or vessel of the heart. This is done both for diagnostic and interventional purposes. *Cardiac muscle ‚Äì (also called heart muscle or myocardium), is one of three types of vertebrate muscles, with the other two being skeletal and smooth muscles. It is an involuntary, striated muscle that constitutes the main tissue of the walls of the heart. The myocardium forms a thick middle layer between the outer layer of the heart wall (the epicardium) and the inner layer (the endocardium), with blood supplied via the coronary circulation. It is composed of individual heart muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) joined together by intercalated discs, encased by collagen fibres and other substances that form the extracellular matrix. *Cardiac surgery ‚Äì or cardiovascular surgery, is surgery on the heart or great vessels performed by cardiac surgeons. It is often used to treat complications of ischemic heart disease (for example, with coronary artery bypass grafting); to correct congenital heart disease; or to treat valvular heart disease from various causes, including endocarditis, rheumatic heart disease, and atherosclerosis. It also includes heart transplantation. *Cardiology ‚Äì is a branch of medicine dealing with disorders of the heart as well as parts of the circulatory system. *Cardiothoracic surgery ‚Äì (also known as thoracic surgery) is the field of medicine involved in surgical treatment of organs inside the thorax (the chest)‚Äîgenerally treatment of conditions of the heart (heart disease) and lungs (lung disease). *Cardiovascular disease ‚Äì (CVD), is a class of diseases that involve the heart or blood vessels. CVD includes coronary artery diseases (CAD) such as angina and myocardial infarction (commonly known as a heart attack). Other CVDs include stroke, heart failure, hypertensive heart disease, rheumatic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, heart arrhythmia, congenital heart disease, valvular heart disease, carditis, aortic aneurysms, peripheral artery disease, thromboembolic disease, and venous thrombosis. *Carotid artery, common ‚Äì In anatomy, the left and right common carotid arteries (carotids) OED 2nd edition, 1989.Entry \\"carotid\\" in Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary.) are arteries that supply the head and neck with oxygenated blood; they divide in the neck to form the external and internal carotid arteries. *Carotid artery, external ‚Äì The external carotid artery is a major artery of the head and neck. It arises from the common carotid artery when it splits into the external and internal carotid artery. It supplies blood to the face and neck. *Carotid artery, internal ‚Äì The internal carotid artery is a major paired artery, one on each side of the head and neck, in human anatomy. They arise from the common carotid arteries where these bifurcate into the internal and external carotid arteries at cervical vertebral level 3 or 4; the internal carotid artery supplies the brain, while the external carotid nourishes other portions of the head, such as face, scalp, skull, and meninges. *Carotid artery stenosis ‚Äì is a narrowing or constriction of any part of the carotid arteries, usually caused by atherosclerosis. *Carpal bones ‚Äì Are the eight small bones that make up the wrist (or carpus) that connects the hand to the forearm. In human anatomy, the main role of the wrist is to facilitate effective positioning of the hand and powerful use of the extensors and flexors of the forearm, and the mobility of individual carpal bones increase the freedom of movements at the wrist.Kingston 2000, pp 126-127 *Carpal tunnel syndrome ‚Äì (CTS), is a medical condition due to compression of the median nerve as it travels through the wrist at the carpal tunnel. The main symptoms are pain, numbness and tingling in the thumb, index finger, middle finger and the thumb side of the ring fingers. *Cartilage ‚Äì is a resilient and smooth elastic tissue, a rubber-like padding that covers and protects the ends of long bones at the joints, and is a structural component of the rib cage, the ear, the nose, the bronchial tubes, the intervertebral discs, and many other body components. It is not as hard and rigid as bone, but it is much stiffer and much less flexible than muscle. The matrix of cartilage is made up of chondrin. *Cartilaginous joint ‚Äì Cartilaginous joints are connected entirely by cartilage (fibrocartilage or hyaline). Cartilaginous joints allow more movement between bones than a fibrous joint but less than the highly mobile synovial joint. Cartilaginous joints also forms the growth regions of immature long bones and the intervertebral discs of the spinal column. *Catheter ‚Äì Is a thin tube made from medical grade materials serving a broad range of functions. Catheters are medical devices that can be inserted in the body to treat diseases or perform a surgical procedure. By modifying the material or adjusting the way catheters are manufactured, it is possible to tailor catheters for cardiovascular, urological, gastrointestinal, neurovascular, and ophthalmic applications. *Celiac disease ‚Äì another way of spelling coeliac disease *Cell biology ‚Äì also called cytology, is a branch of biology that studies the structure and function of the cell, which is the basic unit of life. Cell biology is concerned with the physiological properties, metabolic processes, signaling pathways, life cycle, chemical composition and interactions of the cell with their environment. *Central nervous system ‚Äì (CNS), is the part of the nervous system consisting of the brain and spinal cord. *Cephalic vein ‚Äì is a superficial vein in the arm. It communicates with the basilic vein via the median cubital vein at the elbow and is located in the superficial fascia along the anterolateral surface of the biceps brachii muscle. Near the shoulder, the cephalic vein passes between the deltoid and pectoralis major muscles (deltopectoral groove) and through the deltopectoral triangle, where it empties into the axillary vein. *Cerebellum ‚Äì (Latin for \\"little brain\\"), is a major feature of the hindbrain of all vertebrates. Although usually smaller than the cerebrum, in some animals such as the mormyrid fishes it may be as large as or even larger. In humans, the cerebellum plays an important role in motor control. It may also be involved in some cognitive functions such as attention and language as well as in regulating fear and pleasure responses, but its movement-related functions are the most solidly established. The human cerebellum does not initiate movement, but contributes to coordination, precision, and accurate timing: it receives input from sensory systems of the spinal cord and from other parts of the brain, and integrates these inputs to fine-tune motor activity. Cerebellar damage produces disorders in fine movement, equilibrium, posture, and motor learning in humans. *Cerebrum ‚Äì is a large part of the brain containing the cerebral cortex (of the two cerebral hemispheres), as well as several subcortical structures, including the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and olfactory bulb. In the human brain, the cerebrum is the uppermost region of the central nervous system. The prosencephalon is the embryonic structure from which the cerebrum develops prenatally. In mammals, the dorsal telencephalon, or pallium, develops into the cerebral cortex, and the ventral telencephalon, or subpallium, becomes the basal ganglia. The cerebrum is also divided into approximately symmetric left and right cerebral hemispheres. With the assistance of the cerebellum, the cerebrum controls all voluntary actions in the body. *Cervical cancer ‚Äì is a cancer arising from the cervix. It is due to the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Early on, typically no symptoms are seen. Later symptoms may include abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, or pain during sexual intercourse. While bleeding after sex may not be serious, it may also indicate the presence of cervical cancer. *Cervix ‚Äì or cervix uteri, is the lower part of the uterus in the human female reproductive system. The cervix is usually 2 to 3 cm long (~1 inch) and roughly cylindrical in shape, which changes during pregnancy. The narrow, central cervical canal runs along its entire length, connecting the uterine cavity and the lumen of the vagina. The opening into the uterus is called the internal os, and the opening into the vagina is called the external os. The lower part of the cervix, known as the vaginal portion of the cervix (or ectocervix), bulges into the top of the vagina. *Cheek ‚Äì The cheeks constitute the area of the face below the eyes and between the nose and the left or right ear. \\"Buccal\\" means relating to the cheek. In humans, the region is innervated by the buccal nerve. The area between the inside of the cheek and the teeth and gums is called the vestibule or buccal pouch or buccal cavity and forms part of the mouth. *Chin ‚Äì is the area of the face below the lower lip and including the mandibular prominence. It is formed by the lower front of the mandible. *Chronic fatigue syndrome ‚Äì (CFS), also referred to as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), is a medical condition characterized by long-term fatigue and other persistent symptoms that limit a person's ability to carry out ordinary daily activities.Guideline 53: Chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (or encephalopathy). London: National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. 2007. . *Ciliary muscle ‚Äì is a ring of smooth muscleSchachar, Ronald A. (2012). \\"Anatomy and Physiology.\\" (Chapter 4) . in the eye's middle layer (vascular layer) that controls accommodation for viewing objects at varying distances and regulates the flow of aqueous humor into Schlemm's canal. It changes the shape of the lens within the eye, not the size of the pupil which is carried out by the sphincter pupillae muscle and dilator pupillae. *Circulatory system ‚Äì *Clavicle ‚Äì also known as the collar bone, is a long bone that serves as a strut between the shoulder blade and the sternum. There are two, one on the right, and one on the left side of the trunk. Along with the shoulder blade, the clavicles make up the shoulder girdle. The clavicle has many functions. It connects the axial and appendicular skeleton in conjunction with the scapula, helps extend range of motion, and protects neurovascular structures. *Clinic ‚Äì (or outpatient clinic or ambulatory care clinic) is a healthcare facility that is primarily focused on the care of outpatients. Clinics can be privately operated or publicly managed and funded. *Clinical research ‚Äì is a branch of healthcare science that determines the safety and effectiveness (efficacy) of medications, devices, diagnostic products and treatment regimens intended for human use. These may be used for prevention, treatment, diagnosis or for relieving symptoms of a disease. Clinical research is different from clinical practice. In clinical practice established treatments are used, while in clinical research evidence is collected to establish a treatment. *Coeliac disease ‚Äì Coeliac disease or celiac disease is a long-term autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the small intestine.\\"Celiac Disease\\". NIDDKD. June 2015. Archivedfrom the original on 13 March 2016. Retrieved 17 March 2016. Classic symptoms include gastrointestinal problems such as chronic diarrhoea, abdominal distention, malabsorption, loss of appetite and among children failure to grow normally. This often begins between six months and two years of age. Non-classic symptoms are more common, especially in people older than two years. There may be mild or absent gastrointestinal symptoms, a wide number of symptoms involving any part of the body or no obvious symptoms. Coeliac disease was first described in childhood; however, it may develop at any age. It is associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as diabetes mellitus type 1 and thyroiditis, among others. *Colorectal surgery ‚Äì *Common carotid artery ‚Äì In anatomy, the left and right common carotid arteries (carotids) ) are arteries that supply the head and neck with oxygenated blood; they divide in the neck to form the external and internal carotid arteries. *Common cold ‚Äì *Common iliac artery ‚Äì The common iliac arteries are two large arteries that originate from the aortic bifurcation at the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra. They end in front of the sacroiliac joint, one on either side, and each bifurcates into the external and internal iliac arteries. *Common iliac vein ‚Äì The common iliac veins are formed by the external iliac veins and internal iliac veins. The left and right common iliac veins come together in the abdomen at the level of the fifth lumbar vertebra, forming the inferior vena cava. They drain blood from the pelvis and lower limbs. Both common iliac veins are accompanied along their course by common iliac arteries. *Coronary arteries ‚Äì are the blood vessels (arteries) of coronary circulation, which transports oxygenated blood to the actual heart muscle. The heart requires a continuous supply of oxygen to function and survive, much like any other tissue or organ of the body. *Corpus callosum ‚Äì also callosal commissure, is a wide, thick nerve tract consisting of a flat bundle of commissural fibers, beneath the cerebral cortex in the brain. The corpus callosum is only found in placental mammals. It spans part of the longitudinal fissure, connecting the left and right cerebral hemispheres, enabling communication between them. It is the largest white matter structure in the human brain, about ten centimetres in length and consisting of 200-300 million axonal projections. *Cranial nerves ‚Äì are the nerves that emerge directly from the brain (including the brainstem), in contrast to spinal nerves (which emerge from segments of the spinal cord). Ten of the cranial nerves originate in the brainstem. Cranial nerves relay information between the brain and parts of the body, primarily to and from regions of the head and neck. *Cure ‚Äì is a substance or procedure that ends a medical condition, such as a medication, a surgical operation, a change in lifestyle or even a philosophical mindset that helps end a person's sufferings; or the state of being healed, or cured. *Cytogenetics ‚Äì is a branch of genetics that is concerned with how the chromosomes relate to cell behaviour, particularly to their behaviour during mitosis and meiosis. *Cytokines ‚Äì are a broad and loose category of small proteins (~5‚Äì20 kDa) that are important in cell signaling. Cytokines are peptides, and cannot cross the lipid bilayer of cells to enter the cytoplasm. D *Deep circumflex iliac vein ‚Äì is formed by the union of the venae comitantes of the deep iliac circumflex artery, and joins the external iliac vein about 2 cm. above the inguinal ligament. It also receives small tributary branches from the thoracoepigastric vein *Deep temporal arteries ‚Äì The deep temporal arteries, two in number, anterior and posterior, ascend between the temporalis and the pericranium. They supply the muscle, and anastomose with the middle temporal artery. The anterior communicates with the lacrimal artery by means of small branches which perforate the zygomatic bone and great wing of the sphenoid. *Deltoid muscle ‚Äì is the muscle forming the rounded contour of the human shoulder. Anatomically, it appears to be made up of three distinct sets of fibers though electromyography suggests that it consists of at least seven groups that can be independently coordinated by the nervous system. *Dentistry ‚Äì also known as Dental and Oral Medicine, is a branch of medicine that consists of the study, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases, disorders, and conditions of the oral cavity, commonly in the dentition but also the oral mucosa, and of adjacent and related structures and tissues, particularly in the maxillofacial (jaw and facial) area. *Dermatitis ‚Äì also known as eczema, is a group of diseases that result in inflammation of the skin. These diseases are characterized by itchiness, red skin and a rash. In cases of short duration, there may be small blisters, while in long-term cases the skin may become thickened. The area of skin involved can vary from small to the entire body.\\"Handout on Health: Atopic Dermatitis (A type of eczema)\\". NIAMS. May 2013. Archived from the original on 30 May 2015. Retrieved 29 July 2016. *Diagnosis ‚Äì Medical diagnosis (abbreviated DxSee List of medical abbreviations: D for variants. or DS) is the process of determining which disease or condition explains a person's symptoms and signs. It is most often referred to as diagnosis with the medical context being implicit. The information required for diagnosis is typically collected from a history and physical examination of the person seeking medical care. Often, one or more diagnostic procedures, such as medical tests, are also done during the process. Sometimes posthumous diagnosis is considered a kind of medical diagnosis. *Diabetes mellitus ‚Äì (DM), commonly known as diabetes, is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by a high blood sugar level over a prolonged period. Symptoms of high blood sugar include frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased hunger.\\"Diabetes Fact sheet N¬∞312\\". WHO. October 2013. Archived from the original on 26 August 2013. Retrieved 25 March 2014. If left untreated, diabetes can cause many complications. Acute complications can include diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, or death. Serious long-term complications include cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, and damage to the eyes. *Dietary reference intake ‚Äì (DRI), is a system of nutrition recommendations from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academies (United States). *Differential diagnosis ‚Äì is the distinguishing of a particular disease or condition from others that present similar clinical features. *Digestive system ‚Äì The human digestive system consists of the gastrointestinal tract plus the accessory organs of digestion (the tongue, salivary glands, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder). Digestion involves the breakdown of food into smaller and smaller components, until they can be absorbed and assimilated into the body. *Disease ‚Äì is an abnormal condition in an organism, or part of it, that negatively affects structure or function. Disease can be caused by external factors, or internal dysfunctions, such as abnormal immune responses. E *Ear ‚Äì is the organ of hearing and, in mammals, balance. In mammals, the ear is usually described as having three parts‚Äîthe outer ear, the middle ear and the inner ear. The outer ear consists of the pinna and the ear canal. Since the outer ear is the only visible portion of the ear in most animals, the word \\"ear\\" often refers to the external part alone. The middle ear includes the tympanic cavity and the three ossicles. The inner ear sits in the bony labyrinth, and contains structures which are key to several senses: the semicircular canals, which enable balance and eye tracking when moving; the utricle and saccule, which enable balance when stationary; and the cochlea, which enables hearing. The ears of vertebrates are placed somewhat symmetrically on either side of the head, an arrangement that aids sound localisation. *Ear infection ‚Äì *Elbow ‚Äì is the visible joint between the upper and lower parts of the arm. It includes prominent landmarks such as the olecranon, the elbow pit, the lateral and medial epicondyles, and the elbow joint. The elbow joint is the synovial hinge joint between the humerus in the upper arm and the radius and ulna in the forearm which allows the forearm and hand to be moved towards and away from the body. *Embryology ‚Äì is the branch of biology that studies the prenatal development of gametes (sex cells), fertilization, and development of embryos and fetuses. Additionally, embryology encompasses the study of congenital disorders that occur before birth, known as teratology. *Emergency medicine ‚Äì also known as accident and emergency medicine, is the medical specialty concerned with the care of illnesses or injuries requiring immediate medical attention. Emergency physicians care for unscheduled and undifferentiated patients of all ages. As first-line providers, their primary responsibility is to initiate resuscitation and stabilization and to start investigations and interventions to diagnose and treat illnesses in the acute phase. *Endocrine system ‚Äì is a chemical messenger system comprising feedback loops of hormones released by internal glands of an organism directly into the circulatory system, regulating distant target organs. In humans, the major endocrine glands are the thyroid gland and the adrenal glands. In vertebrates, the hypothalamus is the neural control center for all endocrine systems. The study of the endocrine system and its disorders is known as endocrinology. Endocrinology is a branch of internal medicine. *Endocrinology ‚Äì is a branch of biology and medicine dealing with the endocrine system, its diseases, and its specific secretions known as hormones. It is also concerned with the integration of developmental events proliferation, growth, and differentiation, and the psychological or behavioral activities of metabolism, growth and development, tissue function, sleep, digestion, respiration, excretion, mood, stress, lactation, movement, reproduction, and sensory perception caused by hormones. Specializations include behavioral endocrinologyNelson, R. J. 2005. An Introduction to Behavioral Endocrinology, Fourth Edition. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA. and comparative endocrinology. *Epidemiology ‚Äì is the study and analysis of the distribution (who, when, and where), patterns and determinants of health and disease conditions in defined populations. It is a cornerstone of public health, and shapes policy decisions and evidence-based practice by identifying risk factors for disease and targets for preventive healthcare. Epidemiologists help with study design, collection, and statistical analysis of data, amend interpretation and dissemination of results (including peer review and occasional systematic review).

His prior assignment was as the Additional Chief Secretary in the Public Health Department, Government of Maharashtra. Banthia also served in United Nation Population Fund (UNFPA), on deputation for four years, as Chief Technical Adviser to Nigerian Census. He was the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India from 1999 to 2004 and the 2001 Census was rolled out under his command. During his initial stint in the IAS, he worked as Assistant Collector, Osmanabad and Beed, Chief Executive Officer Z.P. Wardha, Collector Nagpur and Bhandara, and Managing Director, Maharashtra State Textile Corporation.  Career  After his initial postings as chief executive officer of a Zilla Parishad, Banthia was appointed collector, Bhandara. After a three-year stint, he took up a central deputation post as director of census operations under the ministry of home affairs, where he was promoted as registrar general and census commissioner and held the post till May 2005. In June 2005, he was appointed the chief technical advisor with the United Nations population fund. On 6 January 2010, he returned to the state government and was appointed commissioner, family welfare. Last year, he was promoted as additional chief secretary (public health). An IAS officer of the 1977 Batch, Banthia started out as Assistant Collector, Osmanabad and Beed, followed by becoming the CEO of Zilla Parishad Wardha, and then Collector, Bhandara. Thereafter he was appointed as Director of Census Operations, under central government deputation. There he was promoted as the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India. Later he took a deputation assignment with the United Nations to work as Chief Technical Advisor stationed in Nigeria. He joined the Maharashtra state government services again in 2010, as commissioner, family welfare. A year later, he was promoted as Additional Chief Secretary Public Health. During his tenure as the Chief Secretary, Banthia activated the Mumbai First group, a PPP involving the leading Corporates of Mumbai and the Govt. of Maharashtra / Govt. of India officials, for revival/ pushing through several innovative infra-structure projects of water ways, Metro and Mono Rail, New Railway Stations, resolution of pending infrastructure projects, etc.  Post retirement  Banthia was a part of the Mumbai Metro fare fixation committee, formed to resolve a dispute over metro fare between the government and its private partner in the project - MMOPL. Other members of the committee included Retired Justice E Padmanabhan and former law secretary T K Vishwanathan. While the other two members supported price hike, Banthia issued a dissent note, citing the following: \\"...the existing rules to guide the FFC to enable it to fix the fare... have not been clearly spelt out so far, specially for a PPP project. This has proved to be a major challenge and constraint for the FFC. It is suggested that this aspect be dealt (with) by Government of India, at the earliest, specially for PPP metro projects, since affordability and reasonability of fare structure will be the essence for the common public at large (sic),\\" \\"The very applicability of the provisions of Fare Fixation in this case did not arise, since it was a PPP project, whose pre-bid parameters were already decided and frozen in terms of fare structure and service levels‚Ä¶ This action, however, does not alter the BASIC and FUNDAMENTAL NATURE of the PARAMETERS, which were conditions precedent to the bidding process and inherent part of the bid document for the proposed execution of the Mumbai Metro Project. (sic).\\" The price hike was later on felled by the Bombay High Court, leading to a challenge to the judgement in the Supreme Court by MMOPL. However, the Supreme Court referred the matter back to the High Court for taking it up for final hearing.  Publications  Journal Article: Smallpox in Nineteenth-Century India. Dec 1999.

Significance The significance of Jiba is described in all three Tenrikyo scriptures ‚Äì the Ofudesaki, the Mikagura-uta, and the Osashizu. Phrases in the scriptures define Jiba as simply \\"the origin,\\" and more specifically \\"the origin where God began human beings,\\" \\"the origin of this world,\\" and \\"the origin of all things.\\" In the context of Tenrikyo's creation narrative, the Jiba is said to be the spot where Izanagi- no-Mikoto and Izanami-no-Mikoto, the models of husband and wife, conceived the first children. The scriptures also assert that Jiba is the place where God the Parent and the everliving Oyasama reside. The Jiba is closely associated with Tenrikyo's understanding of salvation. The core ritual of Tenrikyo's liturgy, the Kagura Service, is performed around Jiba. The Osashizu and stories from Anecdotes of Oyasama refer to Jiba as the place where one can request one's own salvation or the salvation of others, and accordingly an important religious practice for adherents is to make pilgrimages there.

Retrieved November 13, 2019. Biography Agnes Edna Ryan was born in Stuart, Iowa, to Edward and Mary A. Ryan. She had two siblings, John and Katherine Ryan. Graduating from Boston University in 1903, Ryan went on to work for the Riverside Press in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and as a staff member of the Congregationalist and National magazines, as well as the Boston American. In 1910, she became managing editor of a suffrage publication, the Woman's Journal. In 1915, Agnes E. Ryan married Henry Bailey Stevens, who worked as the assistant editor for the Woman's Journal. In order to keep her last name, she went to court and successfully challenged the law that required women to take their husband's last name. The couple adopted two children, Peter and Patricia. In 1917, Ryan and Stevens resigned from the Woman's Journal in part because of their opposition to World War I. In 1918, when Henry accepted a job in Durham, N.H., as the director of the Agricultural Experiment Station and Cooperative Extension Service at the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts, later the University of New Hampshire, Agnes followed, organizing the New Hampshire Peace Union, writing poetry, becoming active in the MacDowell Colony of Peterborough, New Hampshire, and serving as a speaker for the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. Ryan was among the feminist vegetarians who, during World War I, made a connection between meat eating and the killing of human beings in the Great War.Adams, C. J. (1990). The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory. New York: Continuum. In Ryan's unpublished novel, \\"Who Can Fear Too Many Stars?,\\" she depicts vegetarianism as a way of resisting male dominance. Ryan's papers are archived at the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Harvard University, and include unpublished novels, diaries, correspondences, an autobiography, and other writings. Reception Carol J. Adams argues that Ryan's \\"the Cancer Bogy\\" was perhaps the first modern vegetarian health guide. Josephine Donovan mentions that Ryan is one of the many first-wave feminists who advocated for animal rights. Selected publications *The Torch Bearer.

This topic has been discussed among German sociologists from completely opposite points of view. However, there is no definitive statistic on the topic so far.Is there such a thing as a classic lower-class name? , Die Welt, 27 February 2008, last viewed on 24 December 2015 On account of the unusual and sudden popularity of the name, the term Kevinism (or Chantalism after the female given name Chantal) for this clich√© was first created by the satire-website Uncyclopedia, and was subsequently picked up by journalists and made into a topic of discussion.Kevinisms as an avoidable childhood illness , Die Welt, 23 December 2007, last viewed on 24 December 2015 According to a master's thesis authored at the University of Oldenburg in 2009, certain given names of students can indeed lead to prejudices on the part of teachers.Julia Isabell Kube, \\"Given name research, Questionnaire study of teachers, whether prejudices concerning specific given names of grade school students are associated with specific personality markers\\", University of Oldenburg, Masters thesis, 2009 For example, the name Kevin (of Irish origin), given to a German child, indicates to German teachers that such a student is prone to attention-seeking behaviour, as well as lower scholastic performance, and is also indicative of a lower socioeconomic status. It was not possible to determine whether this also causes a student to be treated less well.Oliver Trenkamp: \\"Kevin is not a Name, but, instead, a diagnosis\\" , Der Spiegel, 16 September 2009, last viewed on 17 September 2009. Prejudice of this type is understood to be more prevalent amongst teachers in Western Germany. English or otherwise exotic given names are often understood/stigmatised in the old states of Germany to be typical \\"Ossi\\".\\"Discrimination based on names ‚Äì Mandys Suffering\\" , Migazin, 27 February 2012, last viewed on 25 October 2015. In fact, English given names in East Germany were particularly popular in the two decades preceding German reunification. There, this trend was also popular amongst the middle class, while the preference for such given names today, particularly in Western Germany, is perceived as a lower class phenomenon.\\"What is supposed to be the meaning of this?\\" Die Zeit, 31 October 2012, last viewed on 25 October 2015 According to a 2012 study by Leipzig linguist Gabriele Rodriguez, \\"Kevinism\\" given names (in Germany) such as Mandy, Peggy or Kevin have an undeservedly bad reputation. Statistics analysed by her former students at the Leipzig University prove, according to this name expert, that, by now, there are many college and university graduates bearing such names. Amongst German academics with the given name Kevin found in the aforementioned data set from Leipzig University, one could see doctorate-degreed chemists, theologists and Germanists. The word \\"Alpha-Kevin\\" (combination of Alpha male and the given name), as being representative of a particularly unintelligent young person, was, for a time, at the top of the list, which was the subject of a 2015 online poll for the Word of the year (Germany) and, particularly, the youth word of the year. However, it was struck from the list of suggestions on account of being discriminatory to people bearing the name Kevin.\\"Youth word of the year 'Alpha-Kevin' is a non-starter\\" , Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 26 July 2015 The phenomenon in Germany, especially during limited periods of time, that particularly popular given names are associated with negative prejudices, at times, to the point of being used as swear words, is not new from a linguistic perspective. In the past, this was the case, as an example, for given names including Horst, Detlef, Uschi and Heini (German short form of Heinrich).How names can become swear words, jetzt.de , S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, 7 September 2015, last viewed on 19 September 2015 The onomatologist and linguist Damaris N√ºbling spoke at a September 2015 convention on the topic of \\"given names as social markers\\" about a \\"smear campaign\\" having been waged against given names (in Germany) such as Kevin and Chantal and criticised the rhetoric concerning such given names as being \\"very cheap polemic\\".Difficult given names \\"Nobody takes a Lilly seriously\\" , Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 14 September 2015, last viewed on 19 September 2015.

Bred and owned by King George VI she was one of the best two-year- old fillies in England in 1945 when she won two of her four races including the Dewhurst Stakes as well as finishing second in the Middle Park Stakes. In the following year she became increasingly temperamental but after finishing second on her seasonal debut she won the 1000 Guineas despite throwing her jockey and bolting before the start. In her two subsequent races she finished fourth in the Epsom Oaks and unplaced in the Coronation Stakes. As a broodmare she had an enduring influence on the breed through her granddaughter Highclere. Background Hypericum was a bay mare bred and owned by King George VI. She was trained throughout her racing career by Cecil Boyd-Rochfort at the Freemason Lodge Stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. The filly was ridden in most of her races by Doug Smith. She was sired by Hyperion, who won the Epsom Derby and the St Leger Stakes in 1933 and went on to become an internationally significant sire: Hypericum's successes enabled Hyperion to claim the second and third of his six sires' championships in 1945 and 1946. Her dam Feola finished second in the 1000 Guineas and third in the Epsom Oaks before becoming a very successful broodmare. Her other female-line descendants included Round Table, Pebbles, Aureole, Lassalle, Jet Ski Lady and Johannesburg. Racing career =1945: two-year-old season= In 1945 Hypericum won one of her first two races. In October the filly was stepped up in class for the Middle Park Stakes over six furlongs and finished second to the Aga Khan's colt Khaled. Later that month she started 4/7 favourite and won the seven-furlong Dewhurst Stakes. In the Free Handicap, a ranking of the season's best juveniles, Hypericum was assigned a weight of 122 pounds, eight pounds below the top filly Neolight. =1946: three-year-old season= On her debut as a thee-year-old Hypericum finished second to Neolight in the Katheryn Howard Stakes at Hurst Park. On 3 May she started at odds of 100/6 for the 133rd running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course. Neolight was made the 4/6 favourite while the best-fancied horses were the Aga Khan's Cama and Lord Rosebery's Iona. As the thirteen runners approached the starting tapes Hypericum swerved, unseating Doug Smith and cantered three-quarters of a mile before she was caught and returned to the start. When the race began, fifteen minutes later, the filly swerved again but soon settled and won by one and a half lengths from Neolight, with Iona three-quarters of a length back in third. Hypericum's victory, which was witnessed by Princes Elizabeth, was described as one of the most popular ever seen at Newmarket. After her victory it was explained that Hypericum was a \\"problem\\" horse who had thrown off every rider who had mounted her, including her trainer. In the Epsom Oaks on 7 June Hypericum started 9/4 second favourite behind Iona but after misbehaving at the start again she finished fourth of the ten runners behind Steady Aim, Iona and Nelia. The filly was dropped back in distance for the Coronation Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot but ran poorly behind Neolight and was retired from racing soon afterwards. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Hypericum an \\"average\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas. Breeding record After her retirement from racing to become a broodmare for the Royal Stud. On the death of the King in 1952 she passed into the ownership of Queen Elizabeth II. She produced at least seven foals between 1949 and 1964: *Prescription, a chestnut filly, foaled in 1949, sired by Epigram. *Belladonna, bay filly, 1952, by Donatello. Winner.

She was an X-ray crystallographer in the lab of William Astbury. In 1938 they published a paper in Nature that described the structure of DNA as a \\"Pile of Pennies\\". Early life Florence Ogilvy Bell was born at 47 Hanover Road, Brondesbury Park, London, the second daughter of Thomas Bell and his wife, Annie Mary Lucas. Her father was a photographer and later advertising manager who had been born in Allendale, Northumberland, and later he moved to Greycotes, Ambleside. Florence grew up in London and attended Haberdashers' Aske Girls School in Acton.  Education  Bell studied Natural Sciences at Girton College, Cambridge between 1932-1935, concentrating on chemistry, physics and mineralogy. Whilst a student at Girton College, Cambridge, she was taught how to use x-ray crystallography to study biological molecules by John Desmond Bernal. She moved to the University of Manchester, where she worked with Lawrence Bragg on protein crystallography. In 1937, William Astbury wrote to Lawrence Bragg looking for a good crystallographer, and he recommended Bell as an \\"excellent candidate\\". In 1937 Bell arrived at the University of Leeds, where she joined Astbury's laboratory. During her graduate studies she used X-ray diffraction to characterise biomolecules, including nucleic acids. Her initial work was on the structure of protein multilayers, but after Leeds received samples of highly purified DNA, Astbury directed her to study DNA as the second part of her Ph.D. thesis. She received her Ph.D. in 1939. Her notebook and thesis are held at the University of Leeds Special Collections (File).\\"Florence Bell's PhD Thesis\\", Museum of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine, University of Leeds, 2010. Retrieved 2019-10-20.  Career  Astbury's original appointment at the University of Leeds was to study textile physics, where he identified a change in keratin inside wool fibres from alpha to beta form on stretching. In 1939 Bell gave a talk about textiles during an Institute of Physics conference at the University of Leeds, which was covered in the Yorkshire Evening Post in an article entitled \\"Women Scientist Explains\\". In the article Bell was described as a \\"slim University of Cambridge graduate\\". =DNA crystallography= In 1937, Astbury became interested in DNA and directed Bell to work on the molecule. Bell came up with a method to stretch out the fibers to make dried films of purified DNA, with which she took x-ray diffraction photographs that were clearer than previous work. Her work confirmed it was a regular, ordered structure with periodicity of 3.3 - 3.4 √Ö along the axis. She studied the nucleic acids in yeast, pancreases, tobacco mosaic virus and calf thymus. She recognised that the \\"beginnings of life are clearly associated with the interaction of proteins and nucleic acids\\". Bell and Astbury published an X-ray study on DNA in 1938, describing the nucleotides as a \\"Pile of Pennies\\". Astbury presented their work at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. At the time, they were unaware that DNA can change conformation from A to B-form with humidity, and as a result their photographs are more blurry than the later Photo 51 x-ray image taken by Gosling in 1952. Astbury and Bell's recent developments on x-ray studies of proteins were included in the conference proceedings, \\"X-ray and the Stoichiochemistry of Proteins\\", \\"An X-ray Study of Thymonucleic Acid\\" and \\"Optical and X-ray Examination and Direct Measurement of Built-up Protein Multilayers\\". Astbury greatly admired Bell's willingness to challenge his ideas, referring to her as his \\"vox diabolica\\" (Devil's Advocate). =World war II and after= In 1941 Bell was enlisted to the Women's Auxiliary Air Force. The University of Leeds and William Astbury fought to get her back to the laboratory, keeping her position on hold and writing to the War Office. But Bell had fallen in love with an American serviceman, Capt. James Herbert Sawyer, and wrote to the University to say she was going to get married and move to the States. Bell and Sawyer were married 21 December 1942 at St. Mary's Church in Ambleside. She then moved with her husband to the United States where she was employed by the British Air Commission in Washington, D.C. and later she worked as an industrial chemist for the Magnolia Petroleum Company in Beaumont, Texas. She died in Hereford in 2000. Legacy The importance of Bell's work on DNA is that, although today we know that several features of her proposed model are incorrect, it nevertheless showed that DNA had a regular, ordered structure that could be studied using X-ray crystallography and so laid the foundations for later work by Maurice Wilkins, Rosalind Franklin and Raymond Gosling, as well as providing James Watson and Francis Crick with a key measurement - the distance between adjacent bases - when they began their own attempt to build a model of DNA. It is also worth noting that this work was done at a time when most scientists believed that proteins were the genetic material and that DNA was just a structural component composed of a monotonous repeat of bases. Bell's note book is held in the Leeds University archives. She is included in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.

Highlighting the problem of immense social injustice in Russia, it elicited high praise from, among others, Alexander Pushkin (who described it as \\"the first piece of Russian literature worth sacrificing your supper for\\"), Pyotr Chaadayev and Vissarion Belinsky. One influential detractor proved to be Tsar Nicholas I, who banned Three Novellas from being re-issued, for its \\"ideas and aims [being] quite horrible\\"Muravyov, Vl.

In the 1830s Pavlov continued to translate from French, German and English. The works by Honore de Balzac first published in Russian were translationed by Pavlov. He authored several vaudevilles, numerous essays and critical articles, as well as the book On the Sources and the Forms of the Russian Fable-writing (–û–± –∏—Å—Ç–æ—á–Ω–∏–∫–∞—Ö –∏ —Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ö —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –±–∞—Å–Ω–æ—Å–ª–æ–≤–∏—è, 1859). The next piece of writing that (according to the literary historian Leonid Krupchanov) \\"made the whole of educated Russia talk about it\\" was his set of Four Letters to N.V. Gogol, published originally by Moskovskiye Vedomosti (Nos. 28, 38 and 46, 1847), criticizing the \\"Selected Passages from Correspondence with Friends\\" which shocked many people with the new tone of religious righteousness and didacticism the great writer had adopted in it. In 1837 Pavlov married the poet and translator Karolina Jaenisch. For years the pair ran a popular literary salon in their Moscow house on the Rozhdestvensky Boulevard. Their marriage ended in 1853, when, having squandered away her inherited fortune by gambling, Pavlov was forced to declare bankruptcy and spent several months in jail. His house was searched by the police, some politically dangerous papers were found and he was exiled to Vyatka where he spent the next two years. After the return Pavlov resumed writing and became a respected literary critic. Later in his life he published and edited the newspapers Nashe Vremya (1860‚Äî1863) and Russkiye Vedomosti (1863‚Äî1864). He died on 10 April 1864 in Moscow after prolonged illness and was interred in the Pyatnitskoye cemetery. The location of his grave since then has been lost. Pavlov's six novellas as well as the select poems, essays and correspondence were re-issued in 1985 by Sovetskaya Rossiya Publishers.

He has worked in financial services, health care, telecommunications, information management and energy. He is former chairman, chief executive officer and president of The Equitable Life Holding Corporation. Broms is credited with creating and developing \\"the demutualization of The Equitable\\" and the life insurance industry.  Education and career  Broms attended Baruch College, leaving the college in 1940 to enlist in the U.S. Army. He eventually served in Europe as general staff officer in Third Army Headquarters, and as assistant G-1 in the headquarters of the Ninth United States Army. He spent seven years in active service, including the Korean War, and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal in 1945. After his service, an uncle invited him to join his life insurance agency where Broms achieved early success selling group coverage. He left to establish the Nelson Broms Company Inc. in 1956. In 1960, Broms' firm created a new type of life insurance policy to be purchased by apartment building owners in New York. The policies covered tenants, guaranteeing landlords that a deceased tenant's rent would continue to be paid, and allowing the tenant's family to avoid losing the lease. In 1971, Broms was asked to join The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States (later part of AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company) as a member of senior management, and served for 14 years in leadership roles including chief strategy officer and chief marketing officer (a position he created), culminating in his service as president and chief executive officer (six years), and chairman (three years) of The Equitable Life Holding Corporation. Broms led efforts to divest the company of international partners to focus on U.S. operations, and to secure regulatory approval for the demutualization‚Äîthe conversion from mutual ownership to stock ownership‚Äîof The Equitable. Within 10 years, firms such as Prudential, Metropolitan Life, John Hancock and Principal followed The Equitable's example. Broms was instrumental in the formation and development of the financial services and managed healthcare sectors in the United States. He left The Equitable in 1983 to become a partner of the leveraged buyout management company, Clayton & Dubilier (later Clayton, Dubilier & Rice), one of the oldest and largest private equity investment firms in the world. Broms co-founded and served as vice chairman of Financial Security Assurance, the financial guaranty (or monoline) insurance company which pioneered insuring securitized asset-backed securities with AAA credit. He was personally instrumental in arranging $234 million of equity funding from U.S. and international institutional investors. Broms served as vice chairman until 2000, when FSA was sold to Dexia Group for $2.6 billion. In 1982, Broms co- founded with Anthony M. Frank First Nationwide Bank, the first U.S. bank created by aggregating savings and loan companies. Broms was a member of the board of directors of Contel Inc., serving as a member of the strategic planning committee and chairing the audit committee until the 1991 merger with GTE Corporation. The merger resulted in a $6.6 billion cash purchase price. Many of the cellular properties included in the transfer became the core of Verizon wireless communications. In 1992, Broms joined the board of directors of Covenant Investment Management Inc. in Chicago. That same year, Covenant created The Covenant Portfolio, a diversified mutual fund focused on investment in socially responsible U.S. companies. Broms was a senior adviser to the chief executive of UtiliCorp United, a provider of electricity and natural gas distribution and operator of power generation assets, that ranked as high as 33rd on the Fortune 500. In 2002 he was named senior adviser to Barry Sloane, chairman and CEO of Newtek Capital Inc. He served as a founding board member at Preferred Healthcare Ltd., the first managed mental health care company in the U.S. He served as a board member of MacGregor Sporting Goods Inc, and of Primark Inc. Primark, a global provider of financial, economic and market-research information, merged with Thomson Corp. for $842 million in cash plus the assumption of $235 million of debt.  Philanthropies and community service  In 1965, Broms endowed the Nelson Broms Chair in Private Enterprise at Hofstra University on Long Island, New York. In 1976, Broms served as an adviser to Daniel Patrick Moynihan (Democrat) during his campaign for U.S. Senate. In 1980, Moynihan authored the book, \\"Counting Our Blessings; Reflections on the Future of America\\", in which he scripted, \\"Nelson Broms is one of our blessings\\". Along with William J. Casey (Director of Central Intelligence from 1981 to 1987) Broms co-founded the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, where he remains a director emeritus. He was a co-founder and director of the Ethics Resource Center in Washington, D.C., and served as co-chairman of the Council on Economics and National Security for the National Strategy Information Center. Broms was a founder of Stamford Theatre Works in Stamford, Connecticut; served as an adviser to the founder of the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, D.C.; and was a board member of the Spoleto Festival USA in Charleston, South Carolina. He is a member of the board of advisers for Distinctive charter schools, and a former member of the board of directors for Great Hearts Academies nonprofit charter schools and Harlem's Family Academy.e is the co-founder, initial financial supporter and founding board chairman of Latino Educational Equity Partnerships. He participated in the group that took Edison Schools private, and served as an adviser to senior members of Edison's management. In that role, he created an innovative partnership with Reasoning Mind to improve elementary school mathematics instruction in Edison's schools in St. Louis, Missouri using a computer-based curriculum. During the last 28 years, Broms has served as strategic adviser to Michael Crow, president of Arizona State University, beginning when Crow was at Iowa State University, followed by Columbia University, and now at Arizona State University.  Honors and awards  In 1945, Broms received the Bronze Star Medal for heroic service and meritorious achievement in the U.S. Army. In 2002, he was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, Connecticut. He served as a distinguished visiting entrepreneur at Columbia University.

The concept is usually credited to Paul Halmos. Specifically, consider f\\\\colon\\\\left[0,1\\\\right]\\\\longrightarrow X, where X is a Hilbert space with inner product \\\\langle\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot\\\\rangle. We say that f is a crinkled arc if it is continuous and possesses the crinkly property: if 0\\\\leqslant a then \\\\langle f(b)-f(a),f(d)-f(c)\\\\rangle=0, that is, the chords f(b)-f(a) and f(d)-f(c) are orthogonal whenever the intervals \\\\left[a,b\\\\right] and \\\\left[c,d\\\\right] are nonoverlapping. Halmos points out that, if two nonoverlapping chords are orthogonal, then \\"the curve makes a right-angle turn during the passage between the chords' farthest end-points\\" and observes that such a curve would \\"seem to be making a sudden right angle turn at each point\\" which would justify the choice of terminology. Halmos deduces that such a curve could not have a tangent at any point, and uses the concept to justify his statement that an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space is \\"even roomier than it looks\\". Writing in 1975, Richard Vitale considers Halmos's empirical observation that every attempt to construct a crinkled arc results in essentially the same solution and proves that f(t) is a crinkled arc if and only if, after appropriate scaling, : f(t) = \\\\sqrt{2}\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty x_n \\\\frac{\\\\sin\\\\left(n-1/2\\\\right)\\\\pi t}{\\\\left(n-1/2\\\\right)\\\\pi} where \\\\left\\\\\\\\{x_n\\\\right\\\\\\\\} is an orthonormal set.

The head of the effigy rests on three books. Gower wrote Vox Clamantis in Latin, Speculum Meditantis in French and Confessio Amantis in English. Photographed by Karen Townsend in 2006.Mirour de l'Omme (\\"the mirror of mankind\\") (also Speculum Hominis), which has the Latin title Speculum Meditantis (\\"mirror of meditation\\"), is an Anglo-Norman poem of 29,945 lines written in iambic octosyllables by John Gower (c. 1330 ‚Äì October 1408). Gower's major theme is man's salvation. Internal evidence (no mention of Richard II) suggests that composition was completed before 1380. G. C. Macaulay discovered the only manuscript in the Cambridge University Library. Summary The union of the Devil and Sin produces the seven daughters: Pride, Envy, Ire, Sloth, Avarice, Gluttony and Lechery. Reason and Conscience are unable to save mankind from the daughters and their granddaughters. In the second third of Mirour, God sends the seven Virtues who have granddaughters who oppose the Devil's forces. Much of the final third is an \\"extensive examination of the corruption of the Three Estates of society  Church, State and Workers. Everyone is tainted.\\" Repentance requires the intercession of the Virgin. The conclusion of the poem has been lost. Literary merit Macaulay starts with: \\"it would be absurd to claim for it a high degree of literary merit, but it is nevertheless a somewhat noticeable and interesting performance\\". He then praises it for its design and thoroughness. R. F. Yeager compares this poem to Milton's poems. Mirour is \\"not easy, either to read or always to appreciate\\". The magnitude of vision and Gower's creative eclecticism make the Mirour unique. Choice of language Yeager gives two quite different reasons for the poem being written in French. When composition started in the 1360s, Anglo-Norman was an important language in the court of Edward III. Gower was writing for the moral instruction of the king and his court. Existing Anglo-Norman literature leaned toward romance (although Duke Henry's Le Livre de Seyntz Medicines was an exception); English literature was moralistic. Gower followed a \\"bait and switch\\" strategy to attract readers looking for a romance. After the death of Edward III he was probably resident at St Mary Overie. This priory was an Augustinian institution where Anglo- Norman was spoken. Benedictine and Augustinian houses produced \\"acceptable alternatives to popular literature\\". \\"Gower could well have felt himself moved to provide for his new associates with a pen as well as pounds sterling.\\" Importance Mirour is the basis for the claim for that Gower was a major innovator of form. Gower is sometimes credited with a major innovation in poetic form. Chaucer \\"left it to Gower to invent the iambic tetrameter, and to later centuries of poets to solve the problems of its potential monotony; he himself merely polished the traditional Middle English short line.\\" Fisher pointed that lines 26482 foresaw the Peasants' Revolt with \\"startling clarity\\". The centre section is an example of estate satire. Gower considered Mirour to be his first major work. It is described in a recurring colophon composed in 1390.

Presided over by the French Resident- General or his representative, its remit was originally very narrow: it was not allowed to discuss political or constitutional matters, or public finances and accounts. At the same time the it was accountable for ‚Äúobligatory‚Äù spending, which included the civil list of the Bey and subsidies paid to the ruling Husainid dynasty, as well as the servicing of Tunisia‚Äôs public debt and the management costs of French services in the protectorate (decree of 2 February 1907). The steady evolution of this institution over time was a measure of the development of nationalist ideas. A generation of Tunisian politicians, including Abdeljelil Zaouche, Tahar Ben Ammar and Mohamed Chenik, made their entry into public life through the conference, and eventually negotiated the terms of Tunisian independence.  Early period (1891-1907)  Justin Massicault, Resident General, who established the conference in 1891 From 1688, the French community in Tunis, mainly merchants, made representions to the French consul through two deputies.Rodd Balek, La Tunisie apr√®s la guerre, √©d. Publication du Comit√© de l‚ÄôAfrique fran√ßaise, Paris, 1920-1921, On 23 June 1885, after the establishment of the French protectorate, this arrangement was superseded by a chamber of commerce. The Resident General, Paul Cambon, wanted it to represent all the interests of French colonists in the context of the Protectorate, but the members of the chamber wanted Tunisia to be annexed outright by France, and would not confine themselves to the limited role he envisaged for them. They were supported from France by d√©put√© Honor√© Pontois, a former magistrate in Tunis, who in June 1890 brought forward proposals in the National Assembly for legislation to create a representative body for colonists in Tunisia, with the explicit remit of defending France‚Äôs interests there. Although this bill did not go forward, it prompted the Foreign Minister Alexandre Ribot to write to the Resident General Justin Massicault on 24 October 1890 suggesting that he gathered representatives of French colonists periodically to seek their views on agricultural, industrial and commercial matters of importance to them.David Lambert, Notables des colonies. Une √©lite de circonstance en Tunisie et au Maroc (1881-1939), √©d. Presses universitaires de Rennes, Rennes, 2009, A consultative conference was therefore established, which met for the first time in a wing of the Resident General‚Äôs building in January 1891. It was composed of representatives of chambers of commerce and agriculture, and the French deputy mayors of towns which had been incorporated as communes. On 22 February 1896, representatives of French people who were neither farmers nor businessmen were admitted, thus including workers, civil servants, and the liberal professions for the first time.Rodd Balek, op. cit., The number of delegates rose to 37 (sixteen representing farmers and businessmen, two representing vine growers, four from the North, three from the South, and twelve for the municipalities). The delegates for the North and the South were elected by indirect suffrage - French colonists voted for twelve delegates in the north and seven in the south, who then voted among themselves to decide who should take seats in the conference.Arfaoui Kh√©mais, Les √©lections politiques en Tunisie de 1881 √† 1956, √©d. L‚ÄôHarmattan, Paris, 2011, This method allowed the Resident General to make sure that those taking seats were those of established position, or indeed, in the case of the deputy mayors, chosen personally by him. Even with this composition however, most sessions of the conference were taken up with two demands that never went away - the election of a full assembly based on full suffrage for the French, and the right to examine the budget.David Lambert, op. cit., On 2 January 1905, the first of these demands was met. The conference was to be elected by universal suffrage of male French colonists, now divided into eight constituencies (Northwest, Bizerte, Tunis, Northeast, Centre-East, Centre-West, Sfax and South) and three colleges - agricultural, commercial (now including industrialists) and a third for others (workers, civil servants and professionals). Each college selected fifteen delegates, constituting a conference of forty-five, elected for four years.Rodd Balek, op. cit., Arfaoui Kh√©mais, op. cit., The electorate was French males over the age of 21 with two years‚Äô residence in Tunisia, excluding those who had specified court judgements against them.Rodd Balek, op. cit., In 1914, there were 10,406 electors out of 44,000 French colonists in Tunisia.Rodd Balek, op. cit., This constitution ensured that farmers were overrepresented in the conference, even as their numbers declined as a proportion of the French population. In 1920 for example, they accounted for a third of delegates when they accounted for just 15.3% of the electorate.David Lambert, op. cit., From 1898, sessions of the conference were held in a building bought by the Resident General at 20 Avenue de Paris. It originally had a ground floor and a first floor, but when the Tunisian section was added in 1907, a second floor was added to accommodate it. In 1910, when the French and Tunisian sections began to sit separately, the Tunisians sat on the first floor, and the French on the second.David Lambert, op. cit.,  French and Tunisian sections (1907-1920)  Abdeljelil Zaouche, one of the first Tunisians appointed to the conference On 24 March 1906, B√©chir Sfar first demanded that the Resident General make provision for the representation of native Tunisians. Faced with the wrath of the colonial landowners, he was made caid of Sousse to get him out of Tunis,Taoufik Ayadi, Mouvement r√©formiste et mouvements populaires √† Tunis (1906-1912), √©d. Publications de l‚ÄôUniversit√© de Tunis, Tunis, 1986, but his claim could not be ignored. A decree of Naceur Bey on 2 February 1907 extended the remit of the conference in two important ways. First, it allowed examination of the state budget, and second, it established a Tunisian section for the first time.David Lambert, op. cit., Sixteen Tunisians - fifteen Muslims and one Jew - were appointed for life by the government. Four were selected from Tunis (including the Jewish representative) and two from Sousse, with the rest drawn from the remainder of the country. Not every region of group was represented however; the Fraichiche, Majeur, Jlass, Ouled Ayar, and Ouled Aoun tribes were unrepresented, as were T√©boursouk and Djerba.Rodd Balek, op. cit., This process of choosing Tunisian delegates was intended to ensure that they were accommodating towards the Protectorate government, and the conference quickly developed a reputation as being an institution for \\"b√©ni oui-oui\\" (colonial yes-men). The intended effect was not however always achieved. In one early case, El Hadj Sa√Ød Ben Abdelattif was appointed as a delegate, but a few years later, in 1915, died in the South of the country fighting the French army.Arthur Pellegrin, Histoire de la Tunisie, √©d. Bouslama, Tunis, 1975, Among the first Tunisian delegates appointed was Abdeljelil Zaouche, and his selection prompted the first dissent in the ranks of the Young Tunisian movement. Ali Bach Hamba felt that participation in the conference should be based on elections, not appointment. Zaouche's view was that taking part in the conference was a way of making Tunisians' voices heard, and he used his position to speak out on many topics of importance to the nationalist movement. Zaouche remained a vociferous and leading member of the conference until 1917, when he was appointed ca√Ød of Sousse, a post which required him to step down.Daniel Goldstein, op. cit., Some of the delegates chosen for their loyalty could not even speak French, which hindered discussions considerably. Zaouche noted in 1910 that each year these brave men arrived in Tunis fully briefed on the needs of their regions, but once the conference began its work, they felt completely out of place and, unable to follow the discussion, reached the end of the session without having been able to say a word.‚ÄùTaoufik Ayadi, Mouvement r√©formiste et mouvements populaires √† Tunis (1906-1912), √©d. Publications de l'Universit√© de Tunis, Tunis, 1986, For three years, the fifteen Tunisian and forty-five French delegates sat together. Their interests were often at odds, and hardly any were bilingual. Interpreters were introduced, but this led to translation problems. Above all, most of the French delegates remained irreconcilably opposed to the presence of Tunisians. Accordingly, the French delegates opposed every measure that would give any advantage to the Tunisians, including the proposed suppression of the mejba. Meetings grew more and more heated. Paul Lambert, one of the French delegates, commented that \\"One felt that these honourable colleagues - the French delegates - took a perverse delight in speaking badly of the Arabs, of making fun of them, at making the other French delegates laugh at the native delegates. Frankly, it made one feel ill to hear such sweeping and completely unjustified attacks. In one session, the arguments were so violent that two of the three French-speaking Muslim delegates walked out so as not to hear any more.\\"Taoufik Ayadi, op. cit., ¬´ R√©formes tunisiennes ¬ª, Le Temps, 4 mai 1910, The Resident General Gabriel Alapetite eventually decided this arrangement could not work, so from 27 April 1910, the two sections sat separately. A Higher Council was set up, composed of ministers and heads of service, as well as three French and three Tunisian conference delegates, chosen by their peers. It was this Couuncil's role to come to decisions in cases where the two sections of the conference were irreconcilably opposed. In 1911, the term of service for French delegates was extended from four to six years.David Lambert, op. cit., In 1912, a number of Tunisian delegates (Zaouche, √âlie Fitoussi, Mohamed Ben Mabrouk and Brahim Ben Zouari) demanded that Tunisians be allowed in future to elect their representatives. This demand was renewed in 1920.Fran√ßois Arnoulet, R√©sidents g√©n√©raux de France en Tunisie, √©d. Narration √âditions, Marseille, 1995, That year, some of the French delegates began protesting against the fact that a third of the seats in their section of the conference were reserved for farmers, although they were a declining proportion of the French population. Four of them resigned in November over this issue and, at the last session in December, twenty more of their colleagues (out of 45) walked out of the session because they felt the real powers of the assembly were \\"non-existent.\\" At the same time, the issue for the Tunisian delegates was the lack of any elections. At their last session in 1920, seven of the sixteen delegates, from Tunis, Sousse, Bizerte and Le Kef) made a statement decrying the fact that they had been appointed to their positions as long ago as 1907, calling for their terms of office to be ended, and for the replacements to be directly elected.Rodd Balek, op. cit.,  Grand Council (1922-1951)  Decree establishing the Grand Council in 1922 The problems of 1920 in the conference was followed by a serious political crisis between Naceur Bey and the Resident General Lucien Saint in the spring of 1922. The Bey's death in July led to the accession of the more pliable Habib Bey and the setting up of a new representative structure, the Grand Council, that went some way to responding to the frustrations of the old consultative conference. Established on 13 July 1922, this consisted of: * A French section with 44 members, including 21 representing major economic interests (industry, commerce and agriculture) and a further 23 elected by indirect suffrage of colonists, divided into five constituencies: Bizerte (5 delegates), Tunis (seven delegates), Le Kef (three delegates), Sousse (four delegates) and Sfax (four delegates). * A Tunisian section with 18 members, including two elected from each of the same constituencies, plus two designated representatives for the South, four representing Tunisian chambers of agriculture and commerce, and two Jewish delegates. The first elections returned Mohamed Chenik, Tahar Ben Ammar, Aziz Djellouli, Mohamed Badra, Mohamed Tlatli, Sadok Tlatli and Victor Bessis. As before the two sections conducted their business separately, with the French section presided over by the Resident General, and the Tunisian section by one of his nominees. An arbitration committee with seven members from each section and seven or eight high officials resolved any issues on which the two sections could not agree. The Grand Council had increased powers - it could now modify the budget instead of just scrutinising it, and the Resident General now had to secure the agreement of both sections before contracting any loans.David Lambert, op. cit, Elections for the French section were conducted by universal male suffrage using a list system which allowed for panachage. The electoral process for the Tunisian section was more complex, but represented a real step forward compared to the system of designated delegates created in 1907. Tunisian candidates for election had to be taxpaying men over the age of twenty-five, recognised as notable in their local area by virtue of their age, piety, education, social, or recognised service to the state. Those representing the chamber of agriculture and commerce were elected from lists approved by the government. Votes were not cast in secret - each Tunisian voter had to cast they vote by voice in front of two lawyers. Only the Jewish delegates were permitted to stand for election by direct suffrage on a secret ballot.Arfaoui Kh√©mais, op. cit, This form of election was universally denounced by the nationalist and communist press in Tunisia. Only rich landlords were represented in the Tunisian section, with workers and intellectuals excluded from the electorate. Tunisians accounted for just 29% of delegates (a small increase on the 26% under previous system) when they were the vast majority of the population. From the late 1920s to the Second World War, a steady series of reforms expanded Tunisian representation in the Grand Council. In 1928 Tunisians who held a high school diploma were given the vote for the first time, and the number of delegates they elected indirectly rose from 18 to 26 (33% of the Council). At the same time, the number of French delegates went up from 44 to 52.Henri Cambon, Histoire de la r√©gence de Tunis, √©d. Berger-Levrault, Paris, 1948, In 1934, the number of Tunisians elected (rather than appointed) rose from 10 to 19, and there were henceforth 41 Tunisian delegates (42%) including four Jews, and 56 French.Henri Cambon, Histoire de la r√©gence de Tunis, √©d. Berger-Levrault, Paris, 1948, This was the last reform before the War - on 21 November 1940 the Grand Council was suspended and its powers were exercised by the Resident General assisted by a consultative committee comprising five French members and five Tunisians (Chenik, Ben Ammar, Albert Bessis, Ahmed Acacha and Abderrahmane El Louze). The Grand Council was restored on 3 June 1943Khalifa Chater, Tahar Ben Ammar (1889-1985), √©d. Nirvana, Tunis, 2010, and then completely reconstituted on 15 September 1945. The French and Tunisian sections now had 53 delegates each, but the Tunisian Muslim delegates were still elected indirectly, and the ballot was still not secret.Arfaoui Kh√©mais, op. cit, The French and Tunisian sections once again reached deadlock on 1 December 1951.Mohamed Sayah (texte r√©unis et comment√©s par), Histoire du mouvement national tunisien.

Imprimerie officielle, Tunis, 1974, The attempt to break this by calling new elections also ran into trouble, as the Resident General Louis P√©rillier tried to push ahead while Mohamed Chenik, grand vizir since 17 August 1950, refused to convene the Tunisian electors until his demands for internal autonomy for Tunisia had been met. The Grand Council met for the last time on 9 December 1951, and was then suspended owing to the serious political tensions spreading through the country.Arfaoui Kh√©mais, op. cit, On 4 March 1954 a final attempt was made to set up a Tunisian National Assembly, although the proposal was still based on indirect elections for the Tunisian section, with the French section able to block legislation. Insecurity in the country meant that the proposed elections to this body were never held.Arfaoui Kh√©mais, op. cit,  References   Bibliography  * Marie Dauphin, La Conf√©rence consultative tunisienne (th√®se de doctorat), √©d.

It stars Corey Sevier as Jay Berry Lee and Michael Ontkean and Leslie Hope as Jay Berry's parents. It also stars Katie Stuart, Don Francks, and Wilford Brimley. Plot In the summer of 1910, a group of circus monkeys named Henri, Jacques, Antoinette and Dominique escape from a French circus due to a train wreck and end up in the Oklahoma river bottoms, where the main character, Jay Berry Lee lives with his family. Weeks later, 14-year-old Jay Berry Lee is fighting a bully named Toby on the last day of school when Jay steals Toby‚Äôs prized pocketknife. Their teacher Miss Freeman stops the fight, returning the pocketknife to Toby. Jay later visits a man, Mr. Patterson, at his horse ranch and is desperate to buy Annie - his favorite horse. Mr. Patterson promises Annie to Jay only if he pays no less than $75. When Jay returns home, he is punished for the fight. When Daisy, his crippled sister, sneaks a biscuit to him, she sees Jay's drawings of the horse. She then explains her own resentment, relating to her brother, as their parents forbid her physical activity due to her condition. The next morning, Jay arrives at his Grandpa Sam Ferrans' general store looking for a job so he can earn enough money to buy himself a horse. On the way there, his dog Rowdy goes to explore the forbidden river bottoms. Jay hears monkeys screeching in the distance and after visiting the store, he then discovers the monkeys camping on the drunk Bayliss Hatcher's property. Jay tells Daisy his discovery, but she doesn't believe him. Jay returns to his grandfather's store and finds a wanted poster of the monkeys, paired with a bounty of $85. Toby and two other bullies also find the poster and set out to trap them. Jay makes a trail of apples leading the monkeys to the family farm, to trap them under a heavy box. The trap fails, so Jay borrows a monkey doll from Daisy for bait and places a padded bear trap. The monkeys instead go to the house once more, and wreak havoc while nobody is home. Daisy sets out to follow Jay to the bottoms, when Bayliss Hatcher steps in the bear trap and accidentally shoots his gun into the sky. Scared by the gunshot, Daisy falls down a steep hill. Jay hears Daisy calling for help and comes to her rescue. Their parents, seeing the monkey's mess, get into an argument with Jay and ground him from working at Sam's store for the next two weeks. The next day, Jay runs away. He heads back to the river bottoms to get revenge on the monkeys. He finds a box of ashes and runs to Bayliss' cabin to make a deal with him about the monkeys, while begging him not to shoot them. Bayliss finds out that Jay had set the bear trap and gets angry. Sam finds Jay and decides to take him to Ridgewell so he can research the monkeys. Jay's parents are reluctant as Jay has been disobedient, but Sam tells Mrs. Lee about when he forbade her to go to the fair to enter her pet pig in a contest. His parents agree. Sam takes Jay to the library where Jay researches chimpanzees, learns many ways to train monkeys, and meets a woman named Rose who teaches him how to speak some French words. Sam later shows Jay the house Bayliss used to live in and tells Jay that Bayliss' family left him due to his drinking. Later, when returning with Rowdy to the bottoms, Jay saves Jacques the monkey from Toby's dangerous non-padded bear trap that would have killed the animal. Toby, in a fight with Jay, hits Rowdy with the bear trap, injuring the dog. Bayliss Hatcher suddenly appears, scares the bullies away, and heals Jay and Rowdy. After Jay returns home, he sets up a place in the barn for the monkeys and begins to build a cage for them. A storm arrives, bringing along a tornado that destroys the farm's surroundings. Afterward, Jay discovers Bayliss' cabin was destroyed, and that Bayliss has died in the wreckage of his collapsed house. Heartbroken, Jay goes with his father to get supplies for repairs. Before they go, Daisy shows her family a garden of mushrooms that have appeared. Jay later discovers that Jacques the monkey is dying and takes him home for care. The other monkeys also arrive at the farm, following Jay. The owner Jobert, soon arrives at the farm and gives Jay $85 for finding and returning his chimpanzees. In the morning, Jay borrows Annie from the ranch and gives Daisy a horseback ride. Upon returning, Jay notices his father making a new horse stall for Annie, but Jay tells him not to, explaining that the $85 will instead pay for Daisy's life-saving operation. Daisy overhears, and gives Jay a hug of deep gratitude. Jay then walks Annie back to the ranch.

This is also her fourth and last album with Hispavox before departing from that label two years later. In this album, Casal turned into a melodic singer. She recorded this album in eight different studios in Madrid, London, Mexico City and Buenos Aires. The performer's executive production team included Nick Patrick, along with the collaboration of other musicians such as the French drummer Manu Katch√© and the British Nick Igman.  Style  After suffering from personal problems due to the death of her father, \\"Un mar de confianza\\" shows feelings of loneliness, self compassion and sadness. The album reflects, both in the cover, the black and white promotional photos and in the songs, a general atmosphere of desolation and coldness. It has been reported that she recorded a more mature album with a more elaborated production and arrangements and a wider range of musical influences. Those feelings of loneliness and need for support are clearly shown in the first maxi single of this album entitled \\"Mi confianza\\" (My confidence), a song that was arranged with acoustic guitars and soft drums. This song aired on Spanish radio stations one month before the release of the album. It aroused great interest in the media thanks to its moving lyrics. The interest was so great that the album won an Ondas Award for the best song in October 1999, an event in which the singer presented the song. In the first months of 2000, Luz Casal released the following single from this album entitled \\"Sentir\\" (To feel), a track written and composed by Torres Muniz and Pedro Ayres Magalhaes, members of the Portuguese band Madredeus, in which the performer talks about the need of having the company of the most loved ones while there's still time left. This song received an even better response by the audience and in fact, reached the first place in the Los 40 Principales top 40 chart. The third single of this album was \\"Sumisa\\" (Submissive), a song with feminist lyrics which talk about the discrimination, violence and various humiliations that women still suffer in many aspects of life. One fragment of the lyrics says \\"In the name of whom have you lost your voice, turned into a hostage of your owner and lord?\\" This single was performed for first time in the RTVE music show \\"El s√©ptimo de caballer√≠a\\", presented by Miguel Bos√©. The last maxi single from this album was \\"Inesperadamente\\" (Unexpectedly). This song, composed by the Portuguese singer Rui Veloso, talks about the need to start again after suffering a sentimental loss and finally, the fifth and last single was \\"Quisiera ser y no puedo\\" (I would like to be but I just can't), a rock song similar to the ones of Casal's previous releases.

His work has focused on the still life, the landscape and the interior. Other than a few early exceptions, the human figure is entirely absent from his oeuvre. Piet Raemdonck trained in fine art printmaking at Sint-Lukas in Antwerp (today the Karel de Grote-Hogeschool) and studied film directing at Sint-Lukas in Brussels for a year. Although primarily known as a painter, the artist produces work in a wide variety of mediums (oil, acrylic, watercolour, coloured pencil and oil pastel) and on different supports (canvas, panel and paper). He often uses collage techniques. The first comprehensive monograph dedicated to his oeuvre, Piet Raemdonck, what I‚Äôve seen and what I‚Äôve dreamt, was published by Hannibal in November 2016. This illustrated publication contains essays by writers and art critics Leonard Koren, Abdelkader Benali, Els Fiers and Philip Feyfer. Of Raemdonck‚Äôs work, the film director Joachim Lafosse has said: ‚ÄúAt the corner of an Antwerp district, I discovered the paintings, their vitality, their light, their welcome. I didn‚Äôt stop immediately and continued on my way. Driven by forgotten memories and a feeling that I was destined to miss the paintings, I turned around, I looked again, and I understood that this work was ‚Äòa room in oneself‚Äô. I understood that, and never again shall I forget it.‚Äù Piet Raemdonck has been exhibiting with galleries in Belgium and the Netherlands since 1994. In 2007, he opened an exhibition space for his own work in the modernist Fierens building in Antwerp, adding a second wing just a few years later. The artist has organised several thematic exhibitions in the gallery, which is now an established destination in the ‚ÄòZuid‚Äô neighbourhood of Antwerp. In late 2017, Raemdonck‚Äôs work was shown in a two-venue exhibition in Havana, Cuba. Piet Raemdonck‚Äôs paintings feature in the film Hannah (Andrea Pallaoro, USA/IT/B), starring Charlotte Rampling. He has also collaborated with Axel Vervoordt, Gert Voorjans, Dries Van Noten and Christian Wijnants, amongst others.

Not only gave this document the Duke a nefarious influence over affairs of state in the Republic, but when it became public in 1784 it caused such a scandal that the stadtholder's regime was almost fatally undermined in the political upheaval of the Patriottentijd. Background When William V's father William IV, Prince of Orange died in 1751, the young prince was only three years of age. His mother Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange became Regent for her son in as far as the hereditary office of stadtholder was concerned. Before his death, however, William IV had already made arrangements to give the Duke a role as her adviser. In any case, the ancillary office of Captain-General of the Dutch States Army could not be exercised by a woman, and the Duke was appointed its Captain-General.An honor which even the Duke of Marlborough had not received when he was only appointed lieutenant-Captain-General of the States Army in 1702. The Duke remained in this position during the subsequent regencies of Landgravine Marie Louise of Hesse-Kassel and Princess Carolina of Orange-Nassau. During this entire period he had great influence on the prince's education, and an almost father-son relationship developed between the two.Schama, pp. 55-56 The Act and its influence In the eyes of contemporaries the young prince had not fully matured before he reached his majority on 8 March 1766, and became stadtholder in his own right. The class of ruling Regenten therefore felt anxious about his taking the reins of power unchecked, and the pensionary of Delft, Pieter van Bleiswijk, a leading member of the States of Holland and the States General of the Netherlands for Holland, together with other grandees, like the Grand Pensionary Pieter Steyn took the initiative of making an arrangement in which \\"for the time being\\" the influence of the Duke would be informally continued.Klein, p. 10 This was formalized in a contract (which later became known as the Acte van Consulentschap or Act of Advisorship), drawn up by van Bleiswijk, and concluded between the Prince and the Duke on 3 May 1766. Both signed it, and the Duke swore to it, according to the witness, the Princes' secretary, F.J. de LarreyThe text of the Act is included as Appendix IV to chapter VIII, pp. 255-256 in Nijhoff. The Act consisted of our articles. :1. The Duke promised to advise and assist the Prince in military matters, and matters pertaining to all other departments of state, whenever required or needed; :2. The Duke would be obliged to advise and assist the Prince so as in good conscience to preserve the prerogatives and rights of the Prince, and to promote the welfare of the Dutch Republic, without showing bias in favor of any of the provinces, cities, members of the several States and public colleges, or private interests and citizens, all while keeping the public interest in view under all circumstances; :3. To that end the Duke would permanently accompany the Prince (especially on a tour of the country which was about to begin); :4. The Prince promised to indemnify the Duke from all accountability and responsibility to others than himself for whatever he would advise or do in the fulfillment of his responsibilities under the Act, because he did not want the Duke to account to anybody but himself, and, in case the Prince would die, the Duke would only be obliged to hand over the state papers in his possession at that time, without any obligation to give an account of his actions to the Prince's heirs. All of this until further notice from either party.Nijhoff, pp. 255-256 The Act remained secret for a long time, but of course the inner circle around the Prince knew about it. If necessary, the Duke would brandish it, if challenged by other courtiers, like Willem Bentinck van Rhoon.Klein, pp. 9-10 The immediate effect of the Act was that an attempt to saddle the stadtholder with an \\"advisory council\\" was thwarted.Nijhoff, p. 110 As will be clear from the above account of the contents of the Act, it did not give the Duke formal powers over the stadtholder, but it helped him exploit the natural ascendancy he had enjoyed over William from an early age. The relationship helped to perpetuate the dependence of the younger on the older person to an \\"unhealthy\\" extent, as was recognized by many in their environment. The Duke was instrumental in obtaining the hand in marriage of Wilhelmina of Prussia, Princess of Orange, a niece of the Prussian king Frederick the Great, whom William married on 4 October 1767, but the Princess soon started to resent the Duke's influence, and she became one of his main opponents.Nijhoff, p. 170 The Duke had many other enemies, who blamed him for many of the mistakes the Prince made. The conduct of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War was seen as one of his main failures, and in other military respects, like the encroachments of the new emperor of Austria, Joseph II, in the Austrian Netherlands. This caused the dismissal of the Duke as Captain-General on 24 May 1782, though he remained governor of the fortress of 's-Hertogenbosch until the crisis of the Kettle War in 1784. Because of this removal the Act was no longer operational, and in any case the Duke no longer was a convenient lightning rod for the political opposition from the Patriots, who from then on more and more attacked the stadtholder himself.Nijhoff, pp. 194-195 When in the issues of 19, 23, 26, and 30 June 1784 of the De Post van den Neder-Rhijn, a Patriot newspaper, its editor Pieter 't Hoen published the previously secret text of the Act, a tremendous scandal broke out in the Republic, which made the position of the Duke untenable, and severely harmed the political position of the stadtholder. The fact that it was a private contract that never gave due deference to the position of the true sovereign of the country, the States General, drew 't Hoen's stentorian criticism. It proved in his eyes that the Duke (and by extension the Prince) from the beginning of William's stadtholderate had denied the true constitutional relationships within the Republic, and arrogated a \\"monarchical\\" position for the Prince, which was contrary to what that position in the eyes of the Patriots ought to be.Theeuwen, p. 301 The scandal gave his opponents the opportunity to engineer the Duke's definitive removal. Princess Wilhelmina demanded his dismissal. The States of Holland on 18 August 1784 declared the Act null and void. In the States General they proposed his dismissal as field marshal of the States Army, a rank he still held after his dismissal as Captain-General in 1782, and his deportation from the country. The States of Friesland already had demanded this on 11 June. The Duke resigned his commission on 14 October 1784, and left the Republic for Aachen.Theeuwen, p. 303 Notes and references =Notes= =References= Sources   Category:Legal history of the Netherlands Category:Patriottentijd Category:1780s in the Dutch Republic Category:1766 in law ","title":"Acte van Consulentschap"},{"id":"57235673","text":"The North Dayi District () or Dayi dzigbe District is one of the 25 districts in the Volta Region of Ghana.

Family background and early life Thomas Sturge was born in 1787, one of at least ten children of Thomas Sturge the elder (1749-1825), tallow chandler and oil merchant of Newington Butts, about a mile south of London Bridge. Thomas the younger joined his father's business early in the 19th century, as did at least three of his brothers, Nathan, George and Samuel. Thomas Sturge & Sons, oil merchants and spermaceti processors operated from premises near Elephant and Castle, Newington Butts, until 1840.London Metropolitan Archives, index to the records of the Sun Fire Assurance Office, 1840. He was a first cousin of social reformer and philanthropist Joseph Sturge. Oil merchant and shipowner Hunting the sperm whale Thomas Sturge junior had become the senior partner in the business by 1816, when he began to buy ships and send them to the Southern Whale Fishery to obtain whale oil, seal oil and spermaceti for processing and sale in London. He became the principal owner of at least 23 vessels, most of them South Sea whalers.Howard, p.414. His Quaker faith and values were reflected in his business dealings. He tried to choose committed Christians to command his whale ships and in his sailing instructions gave his captains detailed advice on how to treat their crewmen.Howard, p.433. His vessels each seem to have been supplied with a small library and at least five of his vessels carried a \\"surgeon\\" or ship's doctor.Howard, p.425. One of these was Dr Thomas Beale who later wrote, The Natural History of the Sperm Whale (1839), which he dedicated to his employer.Thomas Beale, The Natural History of the Sperm Whale, London, John Van Voorst, 1839; reprinted by The Holland Press, London, 1973, p.ix-x.

Another member of the society was the historian and politician Thomas Babington Macaulay (1800-1859) who became friends with Sturge. There were many Quakers in the abolition movement. Among these was his cousin the prominent anti-slavery abolitionist and philanthropist Joseph Sturge (1793-1859).

Baker, was an American actor who usually performed with Rudolph Valentino, Ramon Novarro, Harold Lloyd and Charlie Chaplin. This Indiana-born actor played the Link in the film The Missing Link (1927), whose imposing presence combined with the era's casual racism and its attendant limitations, made him a natural for early jungle flicks. His most easily recalled role may have been Hugo in Sherman S. Krellberg's notorious serial The Lost City (1935). His most memorable role was Queequeg in The Sea Beast (1926). Baker's filmography is brief, as the sound era saw him move quickly from featured roles as African chieftains to bits as black convicts. His first screen appearance was in a genre project: he was the sworder in Douglas Fairbanks' The Thief of Bagdad (1924). In John Barrymore's The Sea Beast, a silent Moby Dick, he played Queequeg. In the sound remake of The Island of Lost Ships (1929), he played himself and received the smallest mention. He died in Abilene, Kansas, in early May 1982.

Biography Komarovsky graduated from the Khabarovsk Institute of Railway Transport Engineers. From 1974 to 1976 he served in the Soviet Army. From 1976 to 1990, he worked as an engineer, a flight safety inspector, and a first deputy commander of the Naryan-Mar aviation enterprise for manufacturing. From 1990 to 1991 - deputy chairman of the Naryan-Mar City Executive Committee. On 30 November 1991 by presidential decree, Komarovsky was appointed head of administration of the Nenets Autonomous District. In April 1993, Yury Komarovsky resigned as head of the administration, which was satisfied with President Boris Yeltsin on April 16, 1993. However, he was reappointed of the region. By an order of December 24, 1993, Komarovsky entered the Nenets Autonomous Okrug] as Governor of the Nenets Autonomous Okrug, providing for a change in the structure of the district administration, and the emergence of the institution of vice- governors. In 1994, Komarovsky tried to hold a referendum on the direct entry of the district into the Russian Federation. But then, the decree on the referendum was abolished by the decree of Yeltsin.. Since 1995, Yury Komarrovsky was chairman of the Council of the regional branch of the Movement \\"Our Home - Russia\\" in the Nenets Autonomous Okrug. On 12 December 1993, he was elected along with Leonid Sablin, to the Nenets dual-mandate electoral district No. 83 as a deputy to the Federation Council of the Russian Federation. On the same year, he plagued a scandal with the district newspaper Naryan Vynder. \\"She published false information about what was happening in the district,\\" he claims. On February 22, 1996, he was released by presidential decree from the post of head of the administration of the Nenets Autonomous Okrug at his own request. In December of the same year he ran for the governors of the district, but collected only 15% of the vote, he was not elected. =Moscow Oblast= From March 1997 to November 2005, Komarovsky was the head of the city administration of Vereya, Naro-Fominsky District,in the Moscow Oblast. In November 2005 he was elected head of the urban settlement of Vereya. In October 2009, he was elected chairman of the Council of Deputies of the city of Vereya, he is a deputy of the Council of Deputies of the Naro- Fominsk municipal district. Since 2009 - Director of the Verey Museum of History and Local Lore. Criminal case In 1997, a criminal case was brought against Yury Komarovsky on the fact of his violation of the law in the distribution of loan funds for delivery to the Far North, and on June 5, 1997, he was taken into custody, being accused of abuse of authority by an official. This time Komarovsky was already the head of the city administration of Vereya. On 23 June 1997, the Naryan-Mar City Court found Komarovsky's preventive measure insufficiently substantiated and motivated, and therefore released him from custody in the courtroom. In May 1998, the criminal case against Yuri Komarovsky was terminated.

It was first described by Josef Rostafinksi in 1873 and remains a well-defined genus of the slime molds. Hemitrichia species exhibit either plasmodiocarp or sporangium fruiting bodies, both of which are well- known and recognizable slime molds seen on multiple continents. The genus includes Hemtrichia serpula, known as the pretzel slime mold, an iconic and widespread species that has been used to examine speciation in slime molds. Etymology Hemi comes directly from the Greek prefix hemi, meaning ‚Äúhalf‚Äù. Trichia is combination of the Greek trichios, which refers to hair or hair- like structure and ‚Äìia, referring to a condition, leading to ‚Äìtrichia being the condition of having hair. Hemitrichia therefore refers to the condition of partially having hair. Josef Rostafinkski described Hemitrichia in the family Trichiaceae, along with another genera Trichia. Trichia was described as having numerous capillitium threads, which are free and tapered at the ends. Hemitrichia is described as having capillitium threads that can either be free or fused into a net. History of knowledge As in all members of the Trichiida order, the structure of the capillitium plays a major role in identifying and defining the different families and genera. The presence of a net-like capillitium is likely the most defining and recognizable feature of the genus Hemitrichia, as it has been mentioned by almost every author in his or her description of the genus. It was first described by Josef Rostafinkski in his 1873 book ‚ÄúVersuch eines systems der mycetozoan‚Äù. Rostafinksi places Hemitrichia as one of two genera under the family ‚ÄúTrichiaceae‚Äù, the other being Trichia. Rostafinksi describes the genus as having ‚Äú[c]apillitium tubes fused into nets, free or with single tapered ends trapped between stalk contents‚Äù. The genus has also previously been referred to as ‚ÄúHemiarcyria‚Äù by Fries in 1829 and as ‚ÄúHyporhamma‚Äù by Corda in 1854. In 1922, Thomas MacBride published his second edition of The North American Slime Moulds, the monograph in which he first describes the Trichida order. In this book, the genus Hemitrichia is described as having the ‚Äú[c]apillitium a tangled net of more or less branching and [cross-connecting] fibres‚Äù as well as detail about the capillitium threads, which are ‚Äúconspicuous spirally winding bands or ridges‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe Myxomycetes‚Äù by G.W Martin and C. Alexpoulous, a monograph considered to be one of the most important and influential works on the plasmodial slime molds, describes the genus as having a capillitium with tube-like threads that are connected into a net, with either free or connected free ends, and decorated with several spiral bands. Martin and Alexpoulous‚Äô monograph also mentions that the genus includes some species that would also fit well under two other Trichia genera: the Arcyria and Trichia. In MacBride's book, Hemitrichia represents an intermediate between Arcyria and Trichia, and he notes that the presence of the net formation in the capillitium was similar to Arcyria, while the spiral bands are a distinct feature in the Trichia genera. Currently, Hemitrichia remains a well-studied slime mold genus, with over 40 described species found on multiple continents. Very little molecular research has been done to fully explore the phylogeny and evolution of the slime molds. The majority of the field has relied on morphological features, which often only emphasize the plasmodium life cycle of the organism. Further molecular research into slime mold taxonomy could reveal more information on the family tree and evolution of Hemitrichia. Habitat and ecology The majority of Hemitrichia species can be found on rotten or dead logs in lowland forest. Species of Hemitrichia have been found on four major landmasses: Asia, Europe, North America and South America. Of the 26 recognized species, 13 have been found in the Neotropical Region. Description of organism Hemitrichia is one of six current genera within the family Trichiaceae within the order Trichiida. Trichiida are endosporous Myxomycetes, meaning their spores are held within an acellular structural wall. They are members of the superorder Lucisporidia, which are the brightly coloured Myxomycetes that lack a feature called the columella, which is an extension of the spore stalk through the structure that holds the spores. Members of the family Trichiaceae are described as having sessile or stalked fruiting bodies, and either hold spores in a plasmodiocarpic or a sporocarpic vessel (see Life cycle). Family members also have tube-like capillitium that are hollow and can have ‚Äúdecorations‚Äù such as spirals or spines. In the genus Hemitrichia, these tube-like capillitium threads will form an ‚Äúelastic net‚Äù. These nets will take on the colour of the spores within them, which ranges from yellow to red as is expected in superorder Lucisporidia, or the brightly coloured slime molds. Life cycle Members of the Hemitrichia follow the typical plasmodial slime mold life cycle, which exhibits two main stages as well as possible sexual reproduction. Slime molds spend a period of their life cycle as a myxameoba or a swarm cells. These cells are able to exist as either amoeba or flagellates depending on the conditions the cell experiences, and are hence known as amoeboflagellates. The amoeba form is preferred for terrestrial environments, while the swimming ability of flagella is preferred in a wet environment. These amoeboflagellates also contain a single nucleus, which at this stage in the life cycle is haploid. Under adverse conditions, such as a poor environment, overcrowding or the presence of toxins, these cells can encyst into small, walled cysts that can return to the amoeboflagellate form if conditions improve. The amoeboflagellated stage will undergo sexual reproduction, as two cells fuse to create a diploid cell. This cell will then undergo many rounds of nuclear division without any cellular division, resulting in a rapidly growing, membrane-bound cell with multiple nuclei known as the plasmodium. Fusion with more diploid stage cells, and even with other plasmodium of the same species, will continue to increase the size of the plasmodium. These macroscopic forms of the slime mold are the most well-known and best-studied stage of the life cycle. The plasmodium feeds on bacteria, other microorganisms and can even cannibalize other slime molds. The massive cytoplasm contains multiple nuclei, contractile vacuoles, mitochondria and food vacuoles found on the peripheral edge of the plasmodium. This plasmodium stage usually exists from late spring until early fall. Plasmodium will then begin to form fruiting bodies, which will hold the haploid spores. The spores will develop within a walled structure, and when they are mature they will be released to disperse through multiple means. Wind has often been cited as the main means of dispersal, but other modes such as sticking to insect legs have been proposed. Hemitrichia species can have two kinds of fruiting bodies. One kind is known as a plasmodiocarp. These are immobile, tube-like veins of fruiting bodies that form a net. The best example of this is Hemitrichia serpula, which forms distinctive gold-yellow networks of tubes that will burst to reveal spores when they are mature. The other kind is the sporangium, which is a round case that holds a mass of spores. An example of this is Hemitrichia clavata, which forms small sporangia held on a stalk that open to reveal brightly red to yellow coloured mature spores. These spores will then disperse and change into the haploid ameoboflagellate stage, starting the process over again. Practical importance Two species of Hemitrichia offer important insights into the evolution of the myxomycetes. Hemitrichia serpula is probably one of the most well-known and recognizable slime molds due to its distinct golden yellow net-shaped appearance, which acts as the main morphological feature used to identify the species. H. serpula can be found in lowland forests of most of the major continents, including Asia, Europe, North America and South America, demonstrating their ability to disperse spores upwards of thousands of miles. The species' distinct morphology and its extremely wide spread habitat allowed Hemitrichia serpula to be used to study the process of speciation and gene flow in the Myxomycetes. DNA analysis of H. serpula was able to show that Myxomycetes, like most species, are subject to environmental barriers in gene flow, allowing for the development of new species or clades. Spores of the species Hemitrichia clavata spores were found to be viable and able to germinate after 75 years in storage. This demonstrated the hardiness of the spores, as well as providing an explanation for their ability to survive widespread dispersal.

This facility is dedicated to the study of the interaction of ion beams with matter. The facilities combine ion accelerators in situ with Transmission Electron Microscopes (TEM): a technique that allows real-time monitoring of the effects of radiation damage on the microstructures of a wide variety of materials. Currently the laboratory operates two such systems MIAMI-1 and MIAMI-2 that are the only facilities of this type in the United Kingdom, with only a few other such systems in the world. The MIAMI facility is also part of the UKNIBC (UK National Ion Beam Centre) along with the Universities of Surrey and Manchester, which provides a single point of access to a wide range of accelerators and techniques.  MIAMI-1  MIAMI-1 consists of a JEOL 2000FX TEM combined with a 10 keV Colutron ion source that can be post accelerated up to a 100 keV. This system was initially constructed at the University of Salford in 2008 and moved to the University of Huddersfield in 2011. It is capable of irradiating materials with Inert gas atoms within the energy range of 2-100 keV, enabling the observation at the nanoscale of displacing irradiation. In particular it has been used to observe effects such as: large sputtering yields of gold nanoparticles that have been irradiated with Xe ions; kink band formation in graphite under heavy ion irradiation; and the observation of ordered arrays of helium nanobubbles in tungsten.  MIAMI-2  An image of the MIAMI-2 system, showing the TEM and low energy beamline, with the medium energy beamline coming down from the floor above. Stephen E. Donnelly Recently built within the MIAMI facility is the new MIAMI-2 system, this was funded by an EPSRC grant that was awarded in 2015 and was officially opened on 16 March 2018 by Sir Patrick Stewart and Professor Stephen E. Donnelly (Centre Director). MIAMI-2 consists of two ion beams: a 10-350 kV medium-energy beamline (National Electrostatic Corp.) capable of running most ions up to Pb, at energies > 1 MeV (when using triple-charged ions); and a 1-20 keV low energy beam for light ions (H,He). These are coupled with a 300 kV H-9500 Hitachi TEM, that is equipped with EELS and EDS for elemental and chemical analysis and a gas injection system to allow for the ion irradiation of materials under non-ambient conditions (> 1 Pa). The primary application of the dual ion beam capability of the MIAMI-2 system is to study the synergistic effects of large amounts of damage from the heavy ion and the injection of He or H gas (to represent transmutation gas build up) as to better replicate the effects of neutron irradiation. One of the initial studies on the MIAMI-2 system has shown that tungsten (the material for choice in the divertor armour in the ITER and DEMO Fusion reactors) suffers a buildup of a higher number of immobile defects which inevitably cause increased embrittlement when irradiated under dual heavy and light ion irradiation as compared with light ion irradiation alone.

I struggle to see what anyone sees in Aaron besides that he's apparently good in business. Aaron's brother, Derek (Wilson Cleveland) doesn't yet have a meaty enough role to latch onto, and Olivia (Daniela DiIorio) is almost right up there with how I feel about Aaron: lots of negative vibes.\\" The International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences honored Leap Year with the 2012 Webby Award for Best Online Series.

Aaron is the voice of reason behind Jack's insanity. * Daniela DiIorio as Olivia Reddox, C3D's acerbic chief marketing officer, whose short temper leads her to quit C3D until she meets Sam Berry, an enigmatic stranger who motivates her to reconsider her resignation and rejoin the team. * Drew Lanning as Jack Sather, C3D's CEO who is obsessed with the idea of becoming an iconic, Steve Jobsian leader, but cannot get out of his own way. * Rachel Risen as Lisa Morrison, Aaron's long-suffering wife. =Recurring= Episodes = Season 1 (2011) = = Season 2 (2012) =  References  External links   * Category:American comedy web series Category:YouTube series Category:Streamy Award-winning channels, series or shows Category:2011 American television series debuts Category:Television shows set in Santa Clara County, California Category:Television series about computing Category:2010s American comedy-drama television series ","title":"Leap Year (TV series)"},{"id":"57236114","text":"Whylandra Parish is a civil parish of Gordon County, New South Wales.Robert McLean, The New atlas of Australia : the complete work containing over one hundred maps and full descriptive geography of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia, together with numerous illustrations and copious indices (Sydney :J.

Its mantle is about 75 millimeters long, while its total body reaches 305 millimeters long. G. abyssicola's shell is shaped like a saddle. This octopus is different from other members of Grimpoteuthis because of how many suckers it has, and how its shell is shaped. The species is also disctintive in its number of suckers. It has first 6-8 average sized suckers, then 30-35 enlarged, followed lastly by 30-35 rapidly decreasing in size. \\"Grimpoteuthis Abyssicola O'Shea 1999.\\" Grimpoteuthis Abyssicola, tolweb.org/Grimpoteuthis_abyssicola/20117.

The ship was later dismasted in a storm in January 1914, with the crew taking to a lifeboat and being rescued by the Snohomish, according to the notes. Another source, however, states the dismasting occurred in December 1913. In either case, she was towed to Seattle and repaired by her owner Rolph Navigation & Coal Co., and renamed the Golden State. The Golden State caught fire in the Atlantic Ocean off Pensacola, Florida, on February 17 or 18, 1922, and was abandoned. She was towed into Pensacola in a capsized state on February 23.

Born to two well-known artists, Jean Tinguely and Eva Aeppli, she was raised by her paternal grandparents in Geneva and Bulle and rarely saw her famous parents during her childhood, though her mother supported her artistic pursuits. She took an apprenticeship with photographer Jacques Th√©voz, then began to travel when she was 16. In 1978, Tinguely moved to San Francisco and worked there for 20 years. Her first exhibit was in 1982 in San Francisco. During her time in California, she created large oil paintings and wood sculptures. She continued to exhibit her work in the United States, and expanded to European galleries. After she moved back to Switzerland, Tinguely became intrigued with the process of engraving, and began experimenting with it. Her more recent work is a combination of drawing, watercolor, engraving, and collage. In contrast to her earlier output, her later art is mostly diminutive in size, often only a few inches across. Tinguely has had many solo exhibitions during her life, and has often participated in group exhibits. Several of her works are held permanently in the Atelier-Galerie J.-J.

An upper-level low moved across the area on April 13, generating a mesoscale convective system that moved over eastern Oahu, producing localized heavy rainfall that reached . The heaviest rainfall occurred on northern Kaua ªi. There, a rain gauge owned by the WaipƒÅ Foundation, just west of Hanalei, recorded of rainfall in the 24 hours between 12:45 p.m. on April 14 and 15. This was the greatest 24-hour rainfall total on record in the United States, surpassing the previous record of in Alvin, Texas on July 25‚Äì26, 1979, set during Tropical Storm Claudette. Through the entire event, the same gauge recorded a total of of rain. The heavy rainfall produced flash flooding and landslides that covered roads and washed away several vacant houses. The floods damaged or destroyed 532 houses. Public damage totaled $19.7 million (2018 USD), and overall damage was estimated at over $125 million. Damage on Kauai was the worst from a natural disaster since Hurricane Iniki in 1992. Landslides and flooding covered parts of Kuhio Highway in Hawaii. Meteorological history On April 11, 2018, an upper- level low was located west of the Hawaiian island of Kaua ªi. The low moved toward Hawaii and drew deep tropical moisture from the south. The low eventually opened into a trough, which crossed over the Hawaiian islands on April 13\\\\. That day, a mesoscale convective system (MCS) developed northwest of Molokai and intensified while moving westward through the trade winds. The MCS moved over eastern Oahu, dissipating after moving ashore. Another upper- level low developed on April 14, fueling additional rainfall through April 16, which caused record rainfall on Kaua ªi. The first of a series of thunderstorms moved over northern Kaua ªi around midnight (local time) on April 14\\\\. After a five hour break in rainfall, another set of thunderstorms hit northern Kaua ªi around midnight on April 15 and lasted for about eight hours. The third set of thunderstorms began around 10:00 AM on April 15 and continued until around 7:00 PM. Impact The Honolulu National Weather Service issued various flash flood watches and warnings for the flood event. The trough began dropping heavy rainfall over Hawaii on April 13\\\\. Flooding damaged or destroyed 532 houses. The flooding knocked down trees and power lines, eroded many bridges and roads, and washed away crops, beehives, and livestock. Overall damage was estimated at over $125 million. Damage to public buildings was estimated at $19.7 million (2018 USD). Despite the damage, there were no deaths or injuries. =Oahu= Across eastern Oahu, the mesoscale convective system produced rainfall rates of about per hour. Over a 15 minute period, a rain gauge in Niu Valley recorded of precipitation, which has a 4-10% annual return period. The same station recorded of rainfall over a two hour period, which has a 0.5-1% annual return period. The rainfall on Oahu was largely limited to the eastern one-third of the island. A station at Daniel K. Inouye International Airport recorded of rainfall, just west of Niu Valley, which recorded during the same 24-hour period. At Waimanalo Stream north of Niu Valley, the rains caused the waters to rise in 30 minutes, and in an hour. During the rain event, Wailupe Gulch reported an rise in floodwaters. Flooding entered cars and hundreds of houses on Oahu. The floods also caused significant runoff, leaving a layer of debris on roads. A portion of Kalanianaole Highway was covered with nearly of water, closing a stretch of the highway from Aina Haina to Makapu ªu. A mudslide covered a portion of the same highway near Kailua. Downed trees closed one block of Maunaloa Avenue in Kaimuki. =Kaua ªi= On Kaua ªi, the rainfall event occurred at low elevations near the northern coast. This was unusual, as previous rain events on the island usually occurred over higher elevations. The heaviest rainfall occurred early on April 15. A rain gauge owned by the WaipƒÅ Foundation, just west of Hanalei on Kaua ªi's northern coast, recorded of rainfall in the 24 hours ending at 12:45 p.m. local time. The total greatly surpassed the Hawai ªi 24-hour rainfall record of set on January 25, 1956, at Kƒ´lauea . Furthermore, this total broke the national 24-hour rainfall record of set during Tropical Storm Claudette on July 25‚Äì26, 1979 in Alvin, Texas, a record confirmed in December 2018. The WaipƒÅ rain gauge also recorded over 15 minutes, over an hour, over 6 hours, over 12 hours, and over 48 hours. Elsewhere on northern Kaua ªi, a rain gauge in Wainiha recorded , and a gauge in Hanalei recorded before it failed. Minimal rainfall occurred on the southern and western coasts of Kaua ªi. The intense rainfall washed out several river gauges. Along the Hanalei River, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimated that floodwaters rose , representing a peak flow rate of 32,700 cubic feet per second (ft3/s, 926 m3/s), before the station failed. The Wainiha River reported a record flow rate during the storm event. The rain event caused the worst natural disaster in Kauai since Hurricane Iniki in 1992. The sudden rains caused landslides, mostly in isolated areas, as well as flash flooding, causing power outages in Hanalei and Wainiha. Rising waters washed out four vacant homes and entered dozens of other homes. The rising waters forced guests at the Hanalei Colony Resort to move to the second floor. The floodwaters reached deep near Hanalei, closing parts of Kuhio Highway. Landslides occurred at 15 locations along the same highway, leaving residents in Wainiha and Haena without regional road access, disrupting relief efforts. Three bridges along the route were damaged, which delayed repairs from being made, leaving the Kuhio Highway closed as of November 2018. Residents used a detour on a dirt road. The flooding forced the temporary closure of three beaches - Kalapaki Beach, Koloa Landing, and Moloaa Bay - as well as two parks, NƒÅ Pali Coast State Park and Ha ªena State Park. Residents in Wainiha and Haena were urged to limit their water use due to contaminated water supply. Aftermath and records Kauai Mayor Bernard Carvalho Jr. declared a state of emergency for portions of Kauai, which effectively restricted tourist operations in the Hanalei region. The mayor extended the emergency four more times, effective through January 4, 2019. After the floods, Hawaiian Governor David Ige also declared a State of Emergency. On April 18, the Hawaiian legislature approved $125 million in disaster funding, including $100 million for Kaua ªi. On May 8, United States President Donald Trump declared a federal disaster area for Kaua ªi and Honolulu counties. Initially, the declaration was limited to federal reimbursement for repairs to public infrastructure, but was expanded to include individual assistance on June 27\\\\. Ultimately, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) approved 250 individual assistance applications, which totaled about $1.5 million, with another $2.6 million in public assistance grants. FEMA opened three disaster recovery centers, which provided resources for the application process; these centers were closed by July 20. On November 30, Kauai Mayor Carvalho granted $500,000 to six nonprofits for counselors, meals, emergency supplies, and rebuilding parts of the Limahuli Garden and Preserve. Local and national emergency crews rescued people from their flooded homes by helicopter, boat, and bus, including 475 by helicopter; more than 40% of those rescued by helicopter were tourists. The Hawaii Department of Transportation ran convoys throughout the day along the damaged portions of Kuhio Highway while the roadway was being repaired. The cost of reconstructing the Kuhio Highway was estimated at around $100 million; much of it would be covered by the federal government. In August 2018, Hurricane Lane dropped heavy rainfall in the same area, causing further flooding damage to houses and the Kuhio Highway. The Hanalei post office, damaged during the flooding event, was reopened on July 30. A Red Cross shelter in Kilauea housed 13 people after the event. Some of the displaced stayed with family or friends. The Hanalei Colony Resort evacuated its guests on April 16 and remained closed through October. The resort temporarily housed National Guardsmen and families displaced by the floods. At least two dozen students used the resort as a temporary school. The staff of the resort won the Excellence in Community Service Award at the 29th Annual Na Po‚Äòe Pa‚Äòahana Awards, a ceremony for excellence in the hospitality industry. On August 2, 2018, National Weather Service Senior Hydrologist Kevin Kodama inspected and calibrated record-breaking rain gauge at WaipƒÅ Garden, confirming that the instrument was functioning normally. On December 4, 2018, the National Climate Extremes Committee verified that the accumulation was the highest 24-hour rainfall total in the United States.

Its simple lyrics, written in the first person plural, repeatedly express the indifference of its performers to the entirety of the State of Michigan and declare their place of origin to be Knoxville, Tennessee, or some other location. The earliest known usage of the song was in the 1890s by alumni of Cornell University. It has also been used in a variety of contexts by baseball and football fans from Chicago, Minnesota, and Ohio. \\"We Don't Give a Damn\\" is set to the melody of the American folk song \\"The Old Gray Mare\\". History The song dates back at least to the 1890s and was used in multiple variations and contexts. In 1896, a group of Cornell alumni gathered in Chicago and sang a song with the following lyrics: \\"We don't give a  For the whole State of Michigan; We're from Illinois.\\" During the 1907 World Series, fans of the Chicago Cubs celebrated their team's victory by running onto the field and singing: \\"We don't give a rap for the whole State of Mich-i-gan, whole state of Michigan, whole state of Michigan, we're from Illinois.\\" The song appears to have been popularized as a college football song in the context of the Little Brown Jug rivalry between the Universities of Michigan and Minnesota. In November 1923, Minnesota fans paraded through the streets of Ann Arbor \\"crying at the top of their voices their new battle cry of 'We don't give a d-mn for the whole state of Michigan for today the Gophers will show it some new things in football.\\" In November 1925, Minnesota fans sang the song in preparation for the annual rivalry game, using the lyrics: \\"We don't give a [deleted by censor] For the whole State of Michigan The whole State of Michigan The whole State of Michigan.\\" In December 1926, the Lansing State Journal reported that the singing of \\"We don't give a damn for the whole state of Michigan\\" to the tune of \\"The Old Gray Mare\\" had become common practice at football games among \\"gay collegians of other states.\\" In October 1928, the Detroit Free Press reported that, during a football game between and Michigan, the Ohio Wesleyan band played \\"that old familiar air, 'We Don't Give a Dm for the Whole State of Michigan'\\" as it marched onto the field. The song was credited with inspiring Ohio Wesleyan to upset the Wolverines, 17 to 7. According to another account, Ohio Wesleyan coach George Gauthier, a Michigan State alumnus, led his team in singing the song in the locker room before the 1928 game began. More recently, the song became associated with the Michigan‚ÄìOhio State football rivalry. Some sources incorrectly assert that the lyrics were written in the 1920s when an inebriated supporter of the Ohio State football team began spontaneously vocalizing it in a hotel in Columbus, Ohio, as an organic expression of hostility towards Michigan, and was joined in chorus by several other intoxicated individuals. A 1933 article in the Akron Beacon Journal reports that the song was, at that time, a \\"familiar\\" one at Ohio State fraternities and sororities. The song was performed in the 1940 play The Male Animal, written by Ohio State University alumni James Thurber and Elliott Nugent, and subsequently turned into a in the 1942 motion picture of the same name. The song is performed in the play by supporters of the fictitious Midwestern University in advance of their American football contest against the University of Michigan. The song is set to the melody of the American folk song \\"The Old Gray Mare\\". Performance Singing of \\"We Don't Give a Damn\\" often occurs spontaneously among groups of people - generally alumnae or supporters of The Ohio State University - wishing to express hostility towards Michigan including \\"at any point during a sporting event, at any bar on campus, or really at any establishment in the state of Ohio\\".

She was a well-known health-care practitioner in one of the largest slave cities in the New World. She had an important impact on the community of African healers.  Early life  De Eguiluz was born in Santo Domingo. Her mother, Guiomar, was an enslaved woman for a man named Diego de Leguizam√≥n. De Eguiluz lived in this house with her mother until her teenage years when she was bought by √ç√±igo de Otaza. She was enslaved to him for many years until she was sold to a man named Juan de Eguiluz in Havana.  Career  When de Eguiluz lived in Cartagena, there was a significant population of enslaved African women and African inhabitants in this area. Many people came and went since Cartagena was a port city. Owing to the number of people coming and going into the city, there was a substantial number of healers and ritual specialists. There was also a large amount of sickness and disease that would make its way through the city. Many of the healers tried to create cures for these diseases. However, Spaniards and Creoles saw these women as the cause of the sickness and disease. De Eguiluz learned about remedies and rituals to help heal others. = The Three Trials = De Eguiluz was accused and tried for witchcraft three separate times. These trials took place between 1623-1636.!!! The first time de Eguiluz was accused of withcraft was around 1624. Paula‚Äôs Cuban neighbors provoked this first arrest with their shocking accusations against her, which included: killing a newborn by sucking on its navel, jumping out a window to avoid a blow from her master, but suffering no injuries; practicing erotic magic; and she had a pact with the devil as a member of a witches‚Äô gathering. Showing her pride and personal sense of honor, Paula explained away these serious accusations as resulting from the jealousy of ‚Äúpeople who hate her because her master loves her and they see her well-dressed.‚Äù Paula boasted accurately in terms of her wardrobe, which the Cuban Holy Office functionaries inventoried as including nine skirts, seven bodies, six shirts, and four headscarves. All of her clothing was new and expensive, far beyond any of our expectations for an enslaved woman. She owned (and presumably wore, despite the tropical climate) heavy wool skirts lavishly dyed in blue, scarlet, dark green, and dark gold. She also had damask skirts, dyed blue or yellow, decorated in silver. Her bodices were equally luxurious, in bright combinations including blue with gold braid, green and scarlet with silver buttons, and white and yellow with silver braid.Nicole von Germeten, Violent Delights, Violent Ends: Sex, Race, and Honor in Colonial Cartagena de Indias (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 2013), 152-152. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0826353959/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i1= After three months and thirteen hearings Paula understood what the Inquisitors wanted to hear as her testimony: the story of the witches sabbath. The Inquisitors were not going to settle with any explanation she gave unless it was her confessing that she was a witch. She told a story about her witchcraft and her pact with the devil. None of it was true. It was all fiction, but it is what the Inquisitors wanted to hear. She was charged with witchcraft, had to be whipped around 200 times in public streets, and serve two years in the general hospital wearing the sambenito. The second time de Eguiluz was arrested was in 1632. There was suspicion that she had returned to withcraft and made another pact with the devil. In the eight years between her first and second periods of imprisonment, even as she served her penance, Paula took advantage of her taste of freedom, earning her income as a healer and washerwoman, as well as taking part in passionate love affairs and socializing with other Afro-Caribbean women who dealt in erotic magic, powders, remedies, and possibly even witchcraft and occult-influenced sexuality. As was traditional in Cartagena and other cities in the Iberian peninsula and Spanish America, due to a popular interest in manipulating emotions and sexuality via potions and spells, women of a variety of social classes and nationalities gathered to confer, support each other‚Äôs efforts in relationships with men, and buy and sell nostrums to help attract and keep men‚Äôs interest and patronage. Paula and all of her peers and clients regularly spoke of their magical practices as attempts at achieving ‚Äúgood love,‚Äù although the inquisitors described the relationships the women craved as ‚Äúdishonest friendships.‚Äù Most of the experts in erotic magic in Cartagena were African- descent freedwomen and enslaved women, working in domestic servitude or in menial jobs such as washerwomen. These women practiced divination in an effort to learn about potential lovers who could give them gifts or alleviate their financial worries, however temporarily. Motivated by emotion cravings and sexual desires as well as financial expediency, they said binding spells and tied knots to keep these men with them. Invocations calling on souls in purgatory and hell demanded that the men would feel pain in their most sensitive and vital organs if they left the women. They also discussed ‚Äústupefying‚Äù men to make them more compliant. Paula taught her comadres incantations that could reignite the ‚Äúflames of love‚Äù in a disaffected lover. She also knew how to make potions that would ‚Äúget rid of a man‚Äôs love,‚Äù when he was no longer wanted.Germeten, Violent Delights, 103-122, https://www.amazon.com/Violent-Delights-Ends-Colonial- Cartagena/dp/0826353959/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1452711012&sr;=1-1&keywords;=violent+delights+violent+ends For her second trial, she had 21 hearings in which she developed a script of what the Inquisitors wanted to hear. By this time, however, she has made friends and connections within her local area. De Eguiluz used these connections to try and help reduce her sentence. However, she also gave the Inquisitors a list of peoples names who may also be witches. This list had 21 women arrested due to witchcraft. For her testimony in this trial, she said what the Inquisitors wanted, but also included her experience with herbs, recipes and healing. She stressed the fact that she was trying to heal others, not harm, but was also saying that she did worship the devil. De Eguiluz knew this was the only way the Inquisitors would listen to her. In 1634, a prosecutor wanted to have de Eguiluz 's second trial reviewed. Some of the women that de Eguiluz gave up in her testimony during her second trial were angry and wanted to testify against her. Five women said they confessed to participating in witchcraft because de Eguiluz convinced them to. De Eguiluz did not talk as much in this trial as she did in the others. She knew this trial was more serious, and she could potentially be executed. She emphasized her works as a healer. She even calls herself a curandera in this trial. = The Story of the Bishop and the Witch = One of the people Paula de Eguiluz tried to heal was Bishop P√©rez de Lazarraga. He was a very wealthy man and had a competitive job in the New World. However even with this money, he chose to have de Eguiluz try to heal his sickness. Per√©z did not care about de Eguiluz's ideals or beliefs; he just wanted her to help him. He kept seeing her and having her try to heal him even though there were social issues with their relationship. This action shows how much he believed in her ability to help him.The couple just wanted to be free from all worries yet they were found and she died from a fire at stake  References   Further reading  McKnight, Kathryn Joy., and Leo J.

Roosevelt began on January 20, 1941, the date of Roosevelt's third inauguration, and ended with Roosevelt's death on April 12, 1945. Roosevelt won a third term by defeating Republican nominee Wendell Willkie in the 1940 United States presidential election. He remains the only president to serve for more than two terms. Unlike his first two terms in office, Roosevelt's third and fourth terms were dominated by foreign policy concerns, as the United States became belligerent in World War II in December 1941. After defeating Willkie, Roosevelt won congressional approval of the Lend-Lease program, which was designed to aid Britain in its war against Germany. After Germany declared war on the Soviet Union, Roosevelt extended Lend-Lease to the Soviet Union as well. In Asia, Roosevelt provided aid to the Republic of China, which was resisting an invasion by the Empire of Japan. In response to the July 1941 Japanese occupation of southern French Indochina, Roosevelt expanded a trade embargo on Japan. After attempting to re-open oil exports, Japan launched an attack on the U.S. fleet stationed at Pearl Harbor. In response, Congress declared war on Japan and, eventually, Germany and Italy. Along with Britain, China, and the Soviet Union, the United States became a leading member of the Allied Powers. In consultation with military officials and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Roosevelt decided on a Europe first strategy, which focused on defeating Germany before Japan. Rather than immediately launching an invasion of occupied France or other parts of Europe, Britain and the U.S. began the campaign against Germany with an invasion of North Africa. After some initial difficulties, Allied forces compelled the surrender of Axis forces in North Africa in May 1943. Meanwhile, the United States won a decisive victory over Japan in the Battle of Midway and began a campaign of island hopping in the Pacific Ocean. In 1943, the Allies launched an invasion of Italy and continued to pursue the island hopping strategy. The major Allied leaders met at the Tehran Conference in 1943, where they began to discuss post-war plans. Among the concepts discussed was the United Nations, an intergovernmental organization championed by Roosevelt that would replace the League of Nations after the war. In 1944, the U.S. launched a successful invasion of northern France and won a decisive naval victory over Japan in the Battle of Leyte Gulf. By the time of Roosevelt's death in April 1945, the U.S. had occupied portions of Germany and was in the process of capturing Okinawa. Germany and Japan would both surrender within six months of Roosevelt's death during the administration of Roosevelt's third and final vice president, Harry S. Truman. Though foreign affairs dominated Roosevelt's third and fourth terms, important developments also took place on the home front. The military buildup spurred economic growth, and unemployment fell precipitously. The United States excelled at war production; in 1944, it produced more military aircraft than the combined output of Germany, Japan, Britain, and the Soviet Union. The United States also established the Manhattan Project to produce the world's first nuclear weapons. As in Roosevelt's second term, the conservative coalition prevented Roosevelt from passing major domestic legislation, though it did increase taxes to help pay for the war. Congress also passed the G.I. Bill, which provided several benefits to World War II veterans. Roosevelt avoided imposing heavy-handed censorship or harsh crackdowns on war-time dissent, but his administration relocated and interned over a hundred thousand Japanese Americans. Roosevelt also prohibited religious and racial discrimination in the defense industry and established the Fair Employment Practice Committee, the first national program designed to prevent employment discrimination. Scholars, historians, and the public typically rank Roosevelt alongside Abraham Lincoln and George Washington as one of the three greatest U.S. presidents. Election of 1940 1940 electoral vote results The two-term tradition had been an unwritten rule (until the ratification of the 22nd Amendment after Roosevelt's presidency) since George Washington declined to run for a third term in 1796. Both Ulysses S. Grant and Theodore Roosevelt were attacked for trying to obtain a third non-consecutive term. Roosevelt systematically undercut prominent Democrats who were angling for the nomination, including Vice President John Nance Garner and two cabinet members, Secretary of State Cordell Hull and Postmaster General James Farley. Roosevelt moved the convention to Chicago where he had strong support from the city machine, which controlled the auditorium sound system. At the convention the opposition was poorly organized, but Farley had packed the galleries. Roosevelt sent a message saying that he would not run unless he was drafted, and that the delegates were free to vote for anyone. The delegates were stunned; then the loudspeaker screamed \\"We want Roosevelt... The world wants Roosevelt!\\" The delegates went wild and he was nominated by 946 to 147 on the first ballot. The tactic employed by Roosevelt was not entirely successful, as his goal had been to be drafted by acclamation. At Roosevelt's request, the convention nominated Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace for vice president. Democratic party leaders disliked Wallace, a former Republican who strongly supported the New Deal, but were unable to prevent his nomination. World War II shook up the Republican field, possibly preventing the nomination of isolationist congressional leaders like Taft or Vandenberg. The 1940 Republican National Convention instead nominated Wendell Willkie, the first major party nominee who had never held public office. A well-known corporate attorney and executive, Willkie rose to public notice through his criticism of the New Deal and his clashes with the TVA. Unlike his isolationist rivals for the Republican nomination, Willkie favored Britain in the war, and he was backed by internationalist Republicans like Henry Luce the publisher of influential magazines like TIME. Willkie's internationalist views initially prevented disputes over foreign policy from dominating the campaign, helping to allow for the Destroyers for Bases Agreement and the establishment of a peacetime draft. FDR was in a fighting mood, as he called out to an enthusiastic audience in Brooklyn: :I am only fighting for a free America ‚Äì for a country in which all men and women have equal rights to liberty and justice. I'm fighting against the revival of government by special privilege....I am fighting, as I always have fought, for the rights of the little man as well as the big man....I'm fighting to keep this nation prosperous and at peace. I'm fighting to keep our people out of foreign wars, and to keep foreign conceptions of government out of our own United States. I'm fighting for these great and good causes. Susan Dunn, 1940: FDR, Willkie, Lindbergh, Hitler the Election amid the Storm (2013) p. 249. As the campaign drew to a close, Willkie warned that Roosevelt's re-election would lead to the deployment of American soldiers abroad. In response, Roosevelt promised that, \\"Your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars.\\"Steven M. Gillon, Pearl Harbor: FDR Leads the Nation Into War (2012) p. 13. Roosevelt won the 1940 election with 55% of the popular vote and almost 85% of the electoral vote (449 to 82). Willkie won ten states: strongly Republican states of Vermont and Maine, and eight isolationist states in the Midwest. The Democrats retained their congressional majorities, but the conservative coalition largely controlled domestic legislation and remained \\"leery of presidential extensions of executive power through social programs.\\" Personnel =Executive branch= As World War II approached, Roosevelt brought in a new cohort of top leaders, including conservative Republicans to top Pentagon roles. Frank Knox, the 1936 Republican vice presidential nominee, became Secretary of the Navy while former Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson became Secretary of War. Roosevelt began convening a \\"war cabinet\\" consisting of Hull, Stimson, Knox, Chief of Naval Operations Harold Rainsford Stark, and Army Chief of Staff George Marshall. In 1942 Roosevelt set up a new military command structure with Admiral Ernest J. King (Stark's successor) as in complete control of the Navy and Marines. Marshall was in charge of the Army and nominally led the Air Force, which in practice was nearly independent and was commanded by General Hap Arnold. Roosevelt formed a new body, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which made the final decisions on American military strategy. The Joint Chiefs was a White House agency and was chaired by his old friend Admiral William D. Leahy. The Joint Chiefs worked closely with their British counterparts and formed the Combined Chiefs of Staff. Unlike Stalin, Churchill and Hitler, Roosevelt rarely overrode his military advisors. His civilian appointees handled the draft and procurement of men and equipment, but no civilians ‚Äì not even the secretaries of War or Navy, had a voice in strategy. Roosevelt avoided the State Department and conducted high level diplomacy through his aides, especially Harry Hopkins. Since Hopkins also controlled $40 billion in Lend-Lease funds given to the Allies, they paid attention to him. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. played an increasingly central role in foreign policy, especially regarding China.Julius W. Pratt, \\"The Ordeal of Cordell Hull.\\" Review of Politics 28.1 (1966): 76-98 online. =Judicial appointments= Due to the retirements of Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes and Associate Justice James Clark McReynolds, Roosevelt filled three Supreme Court vacancies in 1941. He elevated Harlan F. Stone, a Republican appointed to the Court by Coolidge, to chief justice and then appointed two Democrats. Senator James F. Byrnes of South Carolina and Attorney General Robert H. Jackson became associate justices. The combination of the liberal Jackson, centrist Stone, and conservative Byrnes helped ensure the Senate confirmation of all three justices. Byrnes disliked serving on the Court, and he resigned to take a top position in the Roosevelt administration in 1942. He was replaced by Wiley Blount Rutledge, a liberal federal appellate judge who would serve on the Supreme Court for just seven years. By the end of 1941, Roosevelt had appointed Stone, Hugo Black, Stanley Forman Reed, Felix Frankfurter, William O. Douglas, Frank Murphy, Byrnes, Jackson, and Rutledge, making Owen Roberts the lone Supreme Court justice whom Roosevelt had not appointed to the Court or elevated to Chief Justice. Roosevelt's appointees upheld his policies, but often disagreed in other areas, especially after Roosevelt's death. William O. Douglas and Black served until the 1970s and joined or wrote many of the major decisions of the Warren Court, while Jackson and Frankfurter advocated judicial restraint and deference to elected officials.Michael R. Belknap, The Supreme Court under Earl Warren, 1953‚Äì1969 (2005) pp. 13-14  Prelude to war: 1941  The geopolitical disposition of Europe in 1941. The grey area represents Nazi Germany, its allies, and countries under its firm control. =Britain and Germany 1941= After his victory over Wendell Willkie in the 1940 election, Roosevelt embarked on a public campaign to win congressional support for aid to the British. In December 1940, Roosevelt received an appeal from Churchill explaining London could not finance the ‚Äúcash and carry‚Äù provision of the Neutrality Act. With British forces deeply committed to fighting Germany, Churchill asked Washington to provide loans and shipping for American goods. Roosevelt agreed and delivered a speech in which he called for the United States to serve as the \\"Arsenal of Democracy,\\" supplying aid to those resisting Germany and other aggressors. He stated, \\"if Great Britain goes down, the Axis Powers will control the continents of Europe, Asia, Africa, Australasia, and the high seas‚Äìand they will be in a position to bring enormous military and naval resources against this hemisphere.\\" In his January 1941 Four Freedoms speech, Roosevelt laid out the case for an American defense of basic rights throughout the world. In that same speech, Roosevelt asked Congress to approve a Lend-Lease program designed to provide military aid to Britain. The cover story was that the supplies were only being lent and would be returned after the war. With the backing of Willkie, the Lend-Lease bill passed by large majorities in both houses of Congress, with most of the opposition coming from Midwestern Republicans. Isolationists did, however, prevent the U.S. from providing naval escorts to merchant ships heading to Britain. Roosevelt also requested, and Congress granted, a massive boost in military expenditures. Military facilities, shipyards and munitions plants were built across the country (especially in the South) and the unemployment rate dropped below ten percent for the first time in over a decade. To oversee mobilization efforts, Roosevelt created the Office of Production Management, the Office of Price Administration and Civilian Supply, and the Supply Priorities and Allocation Board. In late 1940, Admiral Stark had sent Roosevelt the Plan Dog memo, which set forth four possible strategic war plans for fighting an anticipated two-front war against Japan and Germany. Of the four strategies, Stark advocated for the so-called \\"Plan Dog,\\" which contemplated a Europe first strategy and the avoidance of conflict with Japan for as long as possible. A key part of this strategy was to ensure that Britain remained in the fight against Germany until the United States, potentially with the aid of other countries, could launch a land offensive into Europe. Roosevelt did not publicly commit to Plan Dog, but it motivated him to launch talks between American and British military staff, codenamed \\"ABC‚Äì1.\\" In early 1941, American and British military planners jointly agreed to pursue a Europe first strategy. In July 1941, Roosevelt ordered Secretary of War Stimson to begin planning for total American military involvement. The resulting \\"Victory Program\\" provided the army's estimates of the mobilization of manpower, industry, and logistics necessary to defeat Germany and Japan. The program planned to dramatically increase aid to the Allied nations and to prepare a force of ten million men in arms, half of whom would be ready for deployment abroad in 1943. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, Roosevelt extended Lend-Lease to Moscow. Thus, Roosevelt had committed the American economy to the Allied cause with a policy of \\"all aid short of war.\\" Some Americans were reluctant to aid the Soviet Union, but Roosevelt believed that the Soviets would be indispensable in the defeat of Germany. Execution of the aid fell victim to foot-dragging in the administration, so FDR appointed a special assistant, Wayne Coy, to expedite matters. =Battle of the Atlantic 1941= In February 1941, Hitler refocused the war against Britain from air raids to naval operations, specifically U-boat (German submarine) raids against convoys of food and munitions headed to Britain. Canada and Britain provided naval escorts but Churchill needed more and asked Roosevelt. Roosevelt said nohe was still reluctant to challenge anti-war sentiment. In May, German submarines sank the SS Robin Moor, an American freighter, but Roosevelt decided not to use the incident as a pretext to increase the navy's role in the Atlantic.Thomas A. Bailey, and Paul B. Rayan, Hitler Versus Roosevelt: The Undeclared Naval War (1979). Meanwhile, Germany celebrated victories against Yugoslavia, Greece, Russia, and the British forces in the Mediterranean. In August 1941, Roosevelt and Churchill met secretly in Argentia, Newfoundland. This meeting produced the Atlantic Charter, which conceptually outlined global wartime and postwar goals.Douglas Brinkley and David R. Facey-Crowther, eds. The Atlantic Charter (1994) pp 1‚Äì32. excerpt Each leader pledged to support democracy, self- determination, free trade, and principles of non-aggression. Less than a month after Roosevelt and Churchill met at Argentia, a German submarine fired on the U.S. destroyer Greer, but the torpedo missed. In response, Roosevelt announced a new policy in which the U.S. would attack German U-boats that entered U.S. naval zones. This \\"shoot on sight\\" policy effectively declared naval war on Germany and was approved by Americans in polls by a margin of 2-to-1. The Roosevelt administration also took control over Greenland and Iceland, which provided useful naval bases in the northern Atlantic Ocean. Seeking to bolster U.S. power in the Western Hemisphere and eliminate German influence, the Roosevelt administration increased military, commercial, and cultural engagement with Latin America. Nelson Rockefeller played a major role. The FBI trained the secret police of friendly nations. German sales to military forces was displaced by American aid. Pro-German newspapers and radio stations were blacklisted. Government censorship was encouraged, while Latin America was blanketed with pro-American propaganda. Gerald K. Haines, \\"Under the Eagle's Wing: The Franklin Roosevelt Administration Forges an American Hemisphere.\\" Diplomatic History 1.4 (1977): 373-388 online. Hitler did not aggressively respond to U.S. actions, as he wanted to avoid any incident that would bring the U.S. into the war prior to the defeat of the Soviet Union. In October 1941, the USS Kearny, along with other warships, engaged a number of U-boats south of Iceland; the Kearny took fire and lost eleven crewmen. Following the attack, Congress amended the Neutrality Act to allow U.S. ships to transport material to Britain, effectively repealing the last provision of the cash and carry policy. However, neither the Kearny incident nor an attack on the USS Reuben James changed public opinion as much as Roosevelt hoped they might.Douglas M. Norton, \\"The Open Secret: The US Navy in the Battle of the Atlantic April-December 1941.\\" Naval War College Review (1974): 63-83 online. =Tensions with Japan= By 1940, Japan had conquered much of the Chinese coast and major river valleys, but had been unable to defeat either the Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek or the Communist forces under Mao Zedong. Though Japan's government was nominally led by the civilian government of Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoye, Minister of War Hideki Tojo and other military leaders controlled the Japanese government. Tojo sent his military to take control of lightly-defended French colonies in Indochina, which provided important resources as well as a conduit of supply to Chinese forces. When Japan occupied northern French Indochina in late 1940, Roosevelt authorized increased aid to the Republic of China, a policy that won widespread popular support. He also implemented a partial embargo on Japan, preventing the export of iron and steel. Over the next year, the Roosevelt administration debated imposing an embargo on oil, the key American export to Japan. Though some in the administration wanted to do everything possible to prevent Japanese expansion, Secretary of State Hull feared that cutting off trade would encourage the Japanese to meet its needs for natural resources through the conquest of the Dutch East Indies, British Malaya, British Burma, or the American Philippines. With Roosevelt's attention focused on Europe, Hull took the lead in setting Asian policy and negotiating with Japan. Beginning in March 1941, Hull and Japanese ambassador Kichisabur≈ç Nomura sought to reach an accommodation between their respective governments. As the U.S. was not willing to accept the Japanese occupation of China, and Japan was not willing to withdraw from that country, the two sides were unable to reach an agreement. After Germany launched its invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, the Japanese declined to attack Soviet forces in Siberia, ending a long- running internal debate over the best target for Japanese expansion. In July, Japan took control of southern French Indochina, which provided a potential staging ground for an attack on British Burma and Malaya and the Dutch East Indies. In response, the U.S. cut off the sale of oil to Japan, which thus lost more than 95 percent of its oil supply. Following the American embargo, Japanese leaders turned their attention to the conquest of the Dutch East Indies, which had a large supply of oil. In order to consolidate control of the Dutch East Indies, Japanese military planners believed that they needed to capture the Philippines and the British base at Singapore, and defeat the United States Pacific Fleet, which was stationed at the naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. No Japanese leader saw the total defeat of the United States as a feasible outcome, but many hoped that a decisive naval victory would convince the Americans to leave control of the western Pacific to Japan. Prime Minister Konoye sought a summit with Roosevelt in order to negotiate a deal, but Roosevelt insisted the Japanese withdrawal from China first. Tojo succeeded Konoye as prime minister in October, and the Japanese began preparations for an attack on the United States. In November, Nomura made a final offer, asking for reopened trade and acceptance of the Japanese campaign in China in return for Japan's pledge not to attack Southeast Asia. In part because the U.S. feared that Japan would attack the Soviet Union after conquering China, Roosevelt declined the offer, and negotiations collapsed on November 26. =Entrance into the war= On the morning of December 7, 1941, the Japanese struck the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor with a surprise attack, knocking out the main American battleship fleet and killing 2,403 American servicemen and civilians. Scholars have all rejected the conspiracy thesis that Roosevelt, or any other high government officials, knew in advance about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The Japanese had kept their secrets closely guarded, and while senior American officials were aware that war was imminent, they did not expect an attack on Pearl Harbor. Map of Japanese military advances, until mid-1942 After Pearl Harbor, antiwar sentiment in the United States evaporated overnight. For the first time since the early 19th century, foreign policy became the top priority for the American public. Roosevelt called for war in his famous \\"Infamy Speech\\" to Congress, in which he said: \\"Yesterday, December 7, 1941 ‚Äî a date which will live in infamy ‚Äî the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.\\" On December 8, Congress voted almost unanimously to declare war against Japan. On December 11, 1941, Germany declared war on the United States, which responded in kind. Roosevelt portrayed the war as a crusade against the aggressive dictatorships that threatened peace and democracy throughout the world. He and his military advisers implemented a Europe-first strategy with the objectives of halting the German advances in the Soviet Union and in North Africa; launching an invasion of western Europe with the aim of crushing Nazi Germany between two fronts; and saving China and defeating Japan. Public opinion, however, gave priority to the destruction of Japan. In any case, Japan was attacking the American Philippines and so in practice the Pacific had priority in 1942. Japan bombed American air bases in the Philippines just hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor and destroyed the B-17 fleet parked on the ground.Samuel Limneos, \\"Death from Within: The Destruction of the Far East Air Force\\" Army History 104 (2017): 6-29 online. By the end of the month, the Japanese had invaded the Philippines. General Douglas MacArthur led American resistance in the Philippines until March 1942, when Roosevelt ordered him to evacuate to Australia, which became the forward American base.Peter Dean, MacArthur's Coalition: US and Australian Military Operations in the Southwest Pacific Area, 1942-1945 (2018). American forces in the Philippines surrendered in May 1942, leaving Japan with approximately ten thousand American prisoners. While it was subduing the Philippines, Japan also conquered Malaya, Singapore, Burma, and the Dutch East Indies. In his role as the leader of the United States before and during World War II, Roosevelt tried to avoid repeating what he saw as Woodrow Wilson's mistakes in World War I. He often made exactly the opposite decision. Wilson called for neutrality in thought and deed, while Roosevelt made it clear his administration strongly favored Britain and China. Unlike the loans in World War I, the United States made large-scale grants of military and economic aid to the Allies through Lend-Lease, with little expectation of repayment. Wilson did not greatly expand war production before the declaration of war; Roosevelt did. Wilson waited for the declaration to begin a draft; Roosevelt started one in 1940. Wilson never made the United States an official ally but Roosevelt did. Wilson never met with the top Allied leaders but Roosevelt did. Wilson proclaimed independent policy, as seen in the 14 Points, while Roosevelt sought a collaborative policy with the Allies. In 1917, the United States declared war on Germany; in 1941, Roosevelt waited until the enemy attacked at Pearl Harbor. Wilson refused to collaborate with the Republicans; Roosevelt named leading Republicans to head the War Department and the Navy Department. Wilson let General George Pershing make the major military decisions; Roosevelt made the major decisions in his war including the \\"Europe first\\" strategy. He rejected the idea of an armistice and demanded unconditional surrender. Roosevelt often mentioned his role as Assistant Secretary of the Navy in the Wilson administration, but added that he had profited more from Wilson's errors than from his successes.Robert Dallek, Franklin D. Roosevelt and American foreign policy, 1932‚Äì1945 (1995) pp 232, 319, 373 Robert E. Sherwood argues: :Roosevelt could never forget Wilson's mistakes....there was no motivating force in all of Roosevelt's wartime political policy stronger than the determination to prevent repetition of the same mistakes.Robert E. Sherwood, Roosevelt and Hopkins, an Intimate History (1948) p. 227. Alliances, economic warfare, and other wartime issues =Four Policemen= In late December 1941 Churchill and Roosevelt met at the Arcadia Conference, which established a joint strategy between the U.S. and Britain. Both agreed on a Europe first strategy that would prioritize the defeat of Germany before Japan. With British forces focused on the war in Europe, and with the Soviet Union not at war with Japan, the United States would take the lead in the Pacific War despite its own focus on Germany. The U.S. and Britain established the Combined Chiefs of Staff to coordinate military policy and the Combined Munitions Assignments Board to coordinate the allocation of supplies. An agreement was also reached to establish a centralized command in the Pacific theater called ABDA, named for the American, British, Dutch, and Australian forces in the theater. On January 1, 1942, the United States, Britain, China, the Soviet Union, and twenty-two other countries issued the Declaration by United Nations, in which each nation pledged to defeat the Axis powers. These countries opposed to the Axis would be known as the Allied Powers. Roosevelt coined the term \\"Four Policemen\\" to refer to the \\"Big Four\\" Allied powers of World War II: the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China. Roosevelt, Churchill, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, and Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek cooperated informally on a plan in which American and British troops concentrated in the West, Soviet troops fought on the Eastern front, and Chinese, British, and American troops fought in Asia and the Pacific. The Allies formulated strategy in a series of high-profile conferences as well as contact through diplomatic and military channels. Roosevelt had a close relationship with Churchill, but he and his advisers quickly lost respect for Chiang's government, viewing it as hopelessly corrupt. General Joseph Stilwell, who was assigned to lead U.S. forces in the China Burma India Theater, came to believe that Chiang was more concerned with defeating Mao's Communists than with defeating the Japanese. U.S. and Soviet leaders distrusted each other throughout the war, and relations further suffered after 1943 as both sides supported sympathetic governments in liberated territories. =Other allies= By the end of the war, several states, including all of Latin America, had joined the Allies. Roosevelt's appointment of young Nelson Rockefeller to head the new, well- funded Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs provided energetic leadership.Cary Reich, The Life of Nelson A. Rockefeller: Worlds to Conquer, 1908‚Äì1958 (1996) pp 260-373. Under Rockefeller's leadership, the U.S. spent millions on radio broadcasts, motion pictures, and other anti-fascist propaganda. American advertising techniques generated a push back in Mexico especially, where well-informed locals resisted heavy-handed American influence.Kornel Chang, \\"Muted reception: US propaganda and the construction of Mexican popular opinion during the Second World War.\\" Diplomatic History 38.3 (2013): 569-598. Nevertheless, Mexico was a valuable ally in the war. A deal was reached whereby 250,000 Mexican citizens living in the United States served in the American forces; over 1000 were killed in combat. In addition to propaganda, large sums were allocated for economic support and development. On the whole the Roosevelt policy in Latin America was a political success, except in Argentina, which tolerated German influence and refused to follow Washington's lead until the war was practically over.Randall B. Woods, \\"Hull and Argentina: Wilsonian Diplomacy in the Age of Roosevelt\\" Journal of Interamerican Studies and World Affairs 16#3 (1974) pp. 350-371 onlineReich, pp 270-75, 305-17. Outside of Latin America, the U.S. paid particularly close attention to its oil-rich allies in the Middle East, marking the start of sustained American engagement in the region. =Lend-Lease and economic warfare= The main American role in the war, beyond the military mission itself, was financing the war and providing large quantities of munitions and civilian goods. Lend-Lease, as passed by Congress in 1941, was a declaration of economic warfare, and that economic warfare continued after the attack on Pearl Harbor.Warren F. Kimball, Forged War: Roosevelt, Churchill and the Second World War (1997), p 74. Roosevelt believed that the financing of World War I through loans to the Allies, with the demand for repayment after the war, had been a mistake. He set up the Lend-Lease system as a war program, financed through the military budget; as soon as the war with Japan ended, it was terminated.William Hardy McNeil, America, Britain and Russia: Their cooperation and conflict 1941-1946 (1953) pp 118-50, 772-86. The president chose the leadership‚ÄîHopkins and Edward Stettinius Jr. played major roles‚Äîand exercised close oversight and control.Burns, 2:248. One problem that bedeviled the program in 1942 was the strictly-limited supply of munitions that had to be divided between Lend-Lease and American forces. Roosevelt insisted to the military that Russia was to get all the supplies he had promised it.Maurice Matlof and Edwin M. Snell, Strategic Planning for Coalition Warfare 1941-1942 (1953) pp 205-10. Lend-Lease aid to the Soviet Union declined somewhat in mid-1942 after the United States began to prepare for military operations in North Africa. The U.S. spent about $40 billion on Lend-Lease aid to the British Empire, the Soviet Union, France, China, and some smaller countries. That amounted to about 11% of the cost of the war to the U.S. It received back about $7.8 billion in goods and services provided by the recipients to the United States, especially the cost of food and rent for American installations abroad.R.G.D. Allen, \\"Mutual Aid between the U.S. and the British Empire, 1941‚Äì5\\", in Journal of the Royal Statistical Society no. 109 #3, 1946. pp 243‚Äì77 in JSTOR Britain received $30 billion, Russia received $10.7 billion, and all other countries $2.9 billion.Allen (1946) p 250. When the question of repayment arose, Roosevelt insisted the United States did not want a postwar debt problem of the sort that had troubled relations after the first world war. The recipients provided bases and supplies to American forces on their own soil; this was referred informally as \\"Reverse Lend-Lease,\\" and the combined total of this aid came to approximately $7.8 billion overall.Allen (1946) p 258, 260; McNeill p 781. In the end, none of the Allied Powers paid for the goods received during the war, although they did pay for goods in transit that were received after the program ended. Roosevelt told Congress in June 1942:McNeil, America, Britain and Russia (1953) pp 137-50. : The real costs of the war cannot be measured, nor compared, nor paid for in money. They must and are being met in blood and toil.... If each country devotes roughly the same fraction of its national production to the war, then the financial burden of war is distributed equally among the United Nations in accordance with their ability to pay. A major issue in the economic war was the transportation of supplies. After Germany declared war on the United States, Hitler removed all restrictions on the German submarine fleet. German submarines ravaged Allied shipping in the Atlantic, with many of the attacks taking place within ten miles of the East Coast of the United States in early 1942. The U.S. Navy faced difficulties in simultaneously protecting Atlantic shipping while also prosecuting the war against Japan, and over one millions tons of Allied shipping was lost in 1942. The cracking of the German Enigma code, along with the construction and deployment of American naval escorts and maritime patrol aircraft helped give the Allied Powers the upper hand in the Battle of the Atlantic after 1942. After the Allies sank dozens of U-boats in early 1943, most German submarines were withdrawn from the North Atlantic. The United States began a strategic bombing campaign against Axis forces in Europe in mid-1942. Attacks initially targeted locations in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands; U.S. bombers launched their first attack against a target in Germany in January 1943. In an attempt to destroy Germany's industrial capacity, Allied bombers struck targets such as oil refineries and ball- bearing factories. After taking heavy losses in Operation Tidal Wave and the Second Raid on Schweinfurt, the U.S. significantly scaled back the strategic bombing of Germany. General Carl Andrew Spaatz redirected U.S. strategic bombing efforts to focus on German aircraft production facilities, and the Allies enjoyed air superiority in Europe after February 1944. Allied strategic bombing escalated in late 1944, with an emphasis placed on Germany's transportation infrastructure and oil resources. With the goal of forcing a quick German surrender, in 1945 the Allies launched attacks on Berlin and Dresden that killed tens of thousands of civilians. =Reaction to the Holocaust= After Kristallnacht in 1938, Roosevelt helped expedite Jewish immigration from Germany and allowed Austrian and German citizens already in the United States to stay indefinitely. He was prevented from accepting more Jewish immigrants by the prevalence of nativism and antisemitism among voters and members of Congress, resistance in the American Jewish community to the acceptance of Eastern European Jewish immigrants, and the restrictive Immigration Act of 1924. The Immigration Act of 1924 allowed only 150,000 immigrants to the United States per year and set firm quotas for each country, and in the midst of the Great Depression there was little popular support for revisions to the law that would have allowed for a more liberal immigration policy. Roosevelt pushed the limits of his executive authority where possible, which allowed for several Austrian and German Jews, including Albert Einstein, to escape from Europe or remain in the United States past their visa expirations. Hitler chose to implement the \\"Final Solution\\"‚Äìthe extermination of the European Jewish population‚Äìby January 1942, and American officials learned of the scale of the Nazi extermination campaign in the following months. Against the objections of the State Department, Roosevelt convinced the other Allied leaders to jointly issue the Joint Declaration by Members of the United Nations, which condemned the ongoing Holocaust and promised to try its perpetrators as war criminals. In January 1944, Roosevelt established the War Refugee Board to aid Jews and other victims of Axis atrocities. Aside from these actions, Roosevelt believed that the best way to help the persecuted populations of Europe was to end the war as quickly as possible. Top military leaders and War Department leaders rejected any campaign to bomb the extermination camps or the rail lines leading to the camps, fearing it would be a diversion from the war effort. According to biographer Jean Edward Smith, there is no evidence that anyone ever proposed such a campaign to Roosevelt himself. Homefront =Relations with Congress= Up until Pearl Harbor, Congress played a very active role in foreign and military policy, dealing with neutrality laws, the draft, and Lend Lease. As with the general public, congressional sentiment was very hostile toward Germany and Japan, favorable toward China, and somewhat less favorable toward Britain. Democratic congressman with strong German, Irish Catholic, or Scandinavian constituencies generally supported isolationist policies, as did most Republicans. After Pearl Harbor, isolationism disappeared in Congress and was not a factor in the 1942 or 1944 elections. Some leading isolationists, most notably Senator Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan, Senator Warren Austin of Vermont, and Congressman Everett Dirksen of Illinois, became leading internationalists.Garry Boulard, \\"Arthur H. Vandenberg And The Formation Of The United Nations\\" Michigan History (1987) 71#4 pp 38-45.Edward L. Schapsmeier and Frederick H. Schapsmeier, \\"Senator Everett M. Dirksen and American Foreign Policy: From Isolationism to Cold War Interventionism.\\" Old Northwest 7 (Winter 1981-1982): 359-72. Senator Robert A. Taft stayed quiet on foreign and defense issues, while many of the energetic isolationists of the 1930s, including Hiram Johnson and William Borah, were in poor health or had seen their influence decline. During the war, there were no secret briefings, and members of Congress were often no better informed than the average newspaper reader. Congressman did pay attention to military installations in their district, but rarely raised issues of broader military or diplomatic scope, with the partial exception of postwar plans.Roland Young, Congressional Politics in the Second World War (1956), pp 144-96. Congress also established the Truman Committee, which investigated wartime profiteering and other defects in war production. Debates on domestic policy were as heated as ever, and the major Republican gains in Congress in 1938 and 1942 gave the Conservative Coalition the dominant voice on most domestic issues.Young, Congressional Politics (1956), pp 220-23.James T. Patterson, Mr. Republican: A Biography of Robert A. Taft (1972), pp 251-67, 285-98. =Domestic legislation= The home front was subject to dynamic social changes throughout the war, though domestic issues were no longer Roosevelt's most urgent policy concern. The military buildup spurred economic growth. Unemployment fell in half from 7.7 million in early 1940 to 3.4 million in late 1941, and fell in half again to 1.5 million in late 1942, out of a labor force of 54 million. To pay for increased government spending, in 1941 Roosevelt proposed that Congress enact an income tax rate of 99.5% on all income over $100,000; when the proposal failed, he issued an executive order imposing an income tax of 100% on income over $25,000, which Congress rescinded. The Revenue Act of 1942 instituted top tax rates as high as 94% (after accounting for the excess profits tax) and instituted the first federal withholding tax. It also greatly increased the tax base; only four million Americans paid the federal income taxes before the war, while by the end of the war over 40 million Americans paid federal income taxes. In 1944, Roosevelt requested that Congress enact legislation which would tax all \\"unreasonable\\" profits, both corporate and individual, and thereby support his declared need for over $10 billion in revenue for the war and other government measures. Congress overrode Roosevelt's veto to pass a smaller revenue bill raising $2 billion. Congress also abolished several New Deal agencies, including the CCC and the WPA. bill of social and economic rights in January, 1944. (excerpt) Roosevelt's 1944 State of the Union Address advocated a set of basic economic rights Roosevelt dubbed as the Second Bill of Rights. In the most ambitious domestic proposal of his third term, Roosevelt proposed the G.I. Bill, which would create a massive benefits program for returning soldiers. Roosevelt was out-maneuvered by conservatives on bill; he wanted a much narrower bill focused more on poor people, but the American Legion pushed for comprehensive coverage, regardless of income or combat experience, that would avoid the prolonged disputes in the 1920s and 1930s over the aid to veterans. Benefits included tuition and living expense to attend high school or college, a year of unemployment pay at $20 a week, and low-cost loans to buy homes, farms and businesses.Glenn C. Altschuler and Stuart M. Blumin, The GI Bill: A New Deal for Veterans (2009) pp 54-57. The G.I. Bill passed unanimously in both houses of Congress and was signed into law in June 1944. Of the fifteen million Americans who served in World War II, more than half would benefit from the educational opportunities provided for in the G.I. Bill. =War production= To coordinate war production and other aspects of the home front, Roosevelt established the War Shipping Administration, the Office of Price Administration, the Board of Economic Warfare, and the War Labor Board. The U.S. government generally relied on voluntary contracting to mobilize the production of war materials, but in rare cases the Roosevelt administration temporarily took control of industrial facilities. Congress also created tax incentives designed to encourage the shift to military production, while the Reconstruction Finance Corporation continued to offer loans to help expand industrial capacity. Despite efforts made by Congress to encourage contracting with smaller companies, most military contracts went to the largest corporations in the United States. War production increased dramatically after the attack on Pearl Harbor, but that production fell short of the goals established by the president, due in part to manpower shortages. The effort was also hindered by numerous strikes, especially among union workers in the coal mining and railroad industries, which lasted well into 1944. Mobilization was also affected by the military service of over 16 million individuals during the war; approximately one-in-five families had at least one individual serve during the war. Despite various challenges, between 1941 and 1945, the United States produced 2.4 million trucks, 300,000 military aircraft, 88,400 tanks, and 40 billion rounds of ammunition. The production capacity of the United States dwarfed that of other countries; for example, in 1944, the United States produced more military aircraft than the combined production of Germany, Japan, Britain, and the Soviet Union. The United States suffered from inflation during the war, and the administration instituted price and wage controls. In 1943, Roosevelt established the Office of War Mobilization (OWM) to oversee war production. The OWM was led by James F. Byrnes, who came to be known as the \\"assistant president\\" due to his influence. As inflation continued to present a major challenge, the administration expanded a rationing program that covered an increasing number of consumer goods. =Atomic bomb= In August 1939, Leo Szilard and Albert Einstein sent the Einstein‚ÄìSzil√°rd letter to Roosevelt, warning of the possibility of a German project to develop nuclear weapons. Szilard realized that the recently discovered process of nuclear fission could be used to create a nuclear chain reaction that could be used as a weapon of mass destruction. Roosevelt feared the consequences of allowing Germany to have sole possession of the technology, and authorized preliminary research into nuclear weapons. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Congressional leaders secretly gave the administration the necessary funds. Roosevelt selected General Leslie Groves, the Army's top engineer, to manage the Manhattan Project. It was charged with developing the first nuclear weapons. Roosevelt and Churchill agreed to jointly pursue the project with the Quebec Agreement. American scientists cooperated with their British counterparts, including at least one spy. The Manhattan Project cost more than $2 billion, employed 150,000 individuals, and required the construction of massive facilities at Oak Ridge, Los Alamos, and other parts of the country. =African Americans during the war= In 1941, A. Philip Randolph and other African-American leaders planned a march on Washington to protest segregation in the military and the defense industry. In response, Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802, which prohibited racial and religious discrimination in employment among defense contractors. Randolph then cancelled the march on Washington.John H. Bracey, and August Meier, \\"Allies or Adversaries?: The NAACP, A. Philip Randolph and the 1941 March on Washington.\\" Georgia Historical Quarterly 75.1 (1991): 1-17 online. Roosevelt also established the Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) to enforce Executive Order 8802. The FEPC was the first national program directed against employment discrimination, and it played a major role in opening up new employment opportunities to non-white workers. During the war, the number of African Americans employed in the defense industry increased dramatically, primarily outside the South. Likewise, there was rapid growth in the number of African Americans employed by the federal government in segregated roles. Many African Americans were drafted into the Army. Military units remained segregated and most blacks were assigned to non-combat roles. The NAACP grew dramatically during the war, buoyed in part by Randolph's role in convincing Roosevelt to issue Executive Order 8802. The war also saw the acceleration of the Great Migration, as African Americans moved from rural Southern areas to manufacturing centers outside of the South. Roosevelt encouraged employers to hire African Americans, as well as women and ethnics workers, to meet the needs of the wartime labor shortage. =Civil liberties= Manzanar internment camp for relocated Japanese. Roosevelt had cultivated a friendly relationship with the domestic press throughout his presidency, and his good relations with the press helped ensure favorable coverage of his war-time policies without resorting to heavy-handed censorship. During World War I, the U.S. had passed acts such as the Sedition Act of 1918 to crack down on dissent, but Roosevelt largely avoided such harsh measures. He did order FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover to increase its investigations of dissidents and signed the Smith Act, which made it a crime to advocate the overthrow of the federal government. The trials against antiwar spokesmen on the far left and far right collapsed in failure.Patrick S. Washburn, \\"FDR Versus His Own Attorney General: The Struggle Over Sedition, 1941‚Äì42.\\" Journalism Quarterly 62.4 (1985): 717-724. The attack on Pearl Harbor raised concerns in the public regarding the possibility of sabotage by Japanese Americans. This suspicion was fed by long-standing racism against Japanese immigrants, as well as the findings of the Roberts Commission, which concluded that the attack on Pearl Harbor had been assisted by Japanese spies. The size of the Japanese population in Hawaii precluded mass internment in that territory, but there was strong popular support for the removal of Japanese from the West Coast. In February 1942, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which provided for the relocation of hundreds of thousands of Japanese-American citizens and immigrants from the West Coast. They were forced to liquidate their properties and businesses and interned in hastily built camps in interior, harsh locations. Distracted by other issues, Roosevelt had delegated the decision for internment to Secretary of War Stimson, who in turn relied on the judgment of Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the executive order in the 1944 case of Korematsu v. United States. The internment order was rescinded shortly after the Korematsu decision, and Japanese-Americans were allowed to return to the West Coast. Many German and Italian citizens were also arrested or placed into internment camps. Course of the war The two alliances of World War II, with the Axis Powers in blue and the Allied Powers in green =Mediterranean and European theater= The Soviets urged an Anglo-American invasion of German-occupied France in order to divert troops from the Eastern front. Churchill in particular was reluctant to commit troops in Europe in 1942, and strongly favored launching a campaign designed to expel the Axis Powers from North Africa and to consolidate Allied power in the Mediterranean. General Marshall and Admiral King opposed the decision to prioritize North Africa, which they saw as relatively unimportant to the overall war. Roosevelt overrode their objections, as he wanted the U.S. to commit ground forces in the European theater, in 1942, and with British cooperation. The Allies invaded French North Africa in November 1942, securing the quick surrender of local Vichy French forces. That surrender was arranged through a deal between General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the supreme commander of the Allied invasion of North Africa, and Vichy Admiral Fran√ßois Darlan. The cooperation with Darlan allowed the Allies to quickly gain control of much of North Africa, but it also alienated Free French leader Charles de Gaulle and other opponents of the Vichy regime. Darlan was assassinated in December 1942, while Vichy France broke relations with the United States and requested that German forces prevent the Allies from gaining control of French Tunisia. The experience with de Gaulle, Darlan, and another French leader, Henri Giraud, convinced Roosevelt of the necessity to avoid becoming closely associated with any French faction for the remainder of the war. In the Tunisian Campaign, Eisenhower initially faced great difficulties in leading his inexperienced force to success, but Allied forces eventually gained the upper hand. 250,000 Axis soldiers surrendered in May 1943, bringing an end to the North African Campaign. At the January 1943 Casablanca Conference, the U.S. and Britain agreed to defeat Axis forces in North Africa and then launch an invasion of Sicily after the North African campaign, with an attack on France to follow in 1944. At the conference, Roosevelt also announced that he would only accept the unconditional surrender of Germany, Japan, and Italy. The demand for unconditional surrender was calculated to reassure the Soviets, who were still insisting on an immediate attack on German-occupied France, that the United States would not seek a negotiated peace with Germany. In February 1943, the Soviet Union turned the tide on the eastern front by winning a decisive victory at the Battle of Stalingrad. The Allies launched an invasion of Sicily in July 1943, capturing the island by the end of the following month. During the campaign in Sicily, King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy arrested Mussolini and replaced him with Pietro Badoglio, who secretly negotiated a surrender with the Allies. Despite his earlier insistence on unconditional surrender, Roosevelt accepted armistice terms that allowed Badoglio to remain in power. Germany quickly restored Mussolini to power and set up a puppet state in northern Italy. The Allied invasion of mainland Italy commenced in September 1943, but the Italian Campaign moved slowly until 1945. Roosevelt consented to the campaign only on the condition that the British commit to an invasion of France in mid-1944, and the Allied Powers began to build up a force for that operation, diverting soldiers from the Italian Campaign. To command the invasion of France, Roosevelt passed over Marshall and in favor of General Eisenhower. Roosevelt had originally wanted to appoint Marshall to the command, but top military leaders argued that Marshall was indispensable in his role in Washington. While building up forces in Britain, the Allied Powers engaged in Operation Bodyguard, an elaborate campaign designed to mask where the Allies would land in Northwestern Europe. Eisenhower launched Operation Overlord, a landing in the Northern French region of Normandy, on June 6, 1944. Supported by 12,000 aircraft that provided complete control of the air, and the largest naval force ever assembled, the Allies successfully established a beachhead in Normandy and then advanced further into France. Though reluctant to back an unelected government, Roosevelt recognized Charles de Gaulle's Provisional Government of the French Republic as the de facto government of France in July 1944. After the Battle of the Falaise Pocket, the Allies pushed Axis forces back towards Germany, capturing Paris in August 1944. That same month, the Allies launched Operation Dragoon, an invasion of Southern France. Facing logistical issues, Allied forces attempted to secure the Belgian port of Antwerp before moving on Germany's Ruhr region, but the failure of Operation Market Garden delayed the Allied invasion of Germany. In late 1944, Hitler began to amass forces for a major offensive designed to convince the United States and Britain to seek a negotiated peace. A surprise German attack in December 1944 marked the start of the Battle of the Bulge, but the Allies were able to beat back the attack in the following weeks. The Allies advanced across the Rhine River in March 1945, and took control of the Ruhr and the Saarland, another key industrial region. By April 1945, Nazi resistance was crumbling in the face of advances by both the Western Allies and the Soviet Union. =Pacific theater= After sweeping across Maritime Southeast Asia in the months following Pearl Harbor, Japan looked to further expand its territory, taking control of the Solomon Islands and parts of New Guinea. In May 1942, American and Australian forces defeated the Japanese in the Battle of the Coral Sea, prompting a Japanese land campaign across the island of New Guinea. Seeking to seize control of a strategically-placed island and destroy the U.S. fleet in the Pacific, Japan also launched an attack on the American-held Midway Atoll. With the assistance of the Magic cryptanalysis project, Admiral Chester Nimitz led an American force that defeated the Japanese navy at the Battle of Midway. The Battle of Midway resulted in the Japanese fleet's loss of four crucial aircraft carriers, and the battle marked a major reversal of fortune in the Pacific War. In August 1942, the United States launched an invasion of the Japanese-held South Pacific island of Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands; Japanese and American forces contested control of Guadalcanal until February 1943. After the Battle of Guadalcanal, the U.S. adopted an island hopping strategy in order to avoid entrenched Japanese garrisons. By early 1944, Allied forces had established control over much of New Guinea and had landed on the adjacent island of New Britain. While the campaign in the Southwest Pacific continued, U.S. forces launched an offensive in the Central Pacific, beginning with the November 1943 Battle of Tarawa. The U.S. next captured Japanese positions in the Marshall Islands and the Caroline Islands. In June 1944, the U.S. launched an attack on Saipan, in the Mariana Islands, gaining control of the island in early July at the cost of fourteen thousand casualties. As the Battle of Saipan continued, the U.S. won a major naval victory in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, sinking three Japanese aircraft carriers. In July 1944, Roosevelt met with Nimitz and MacArthur, where he authorized the continuation of the campaigns in the Southwest Pacific and the Central Pacific. MacArthur's force would continue its advance towards the Philippines, while the Central Pacific campaign would work its way towards Japan. The U.S. landed on the Philippine island of Leyte in October 1944, provoking a Japanese naval response, as the Philippine Islands maintained a critical position on the Japanese oil supply route from the Dutch East Indies. The Japanese navy was decimated in the resulting Battle of Leyte Gulf, which is sometimes claimed to be the \\"largest naval battle in history.\\" MacArthur's forces secured control of Leyte in December and had largely re-taken control of the Philippines by March 1945. The U.S. began launching strategic bombing raids on Japan from the Mariana Islands in November 1944, but Japan still controlled several islands that provided defense for the Japanese archipelago. In February 1945, the U.S. launched an invasion of the well-defended island of Iwo Jima, taking control of that island the following month. On April 1, the U.S. landed on Okinawa Island, the largest of the Ryukyu Islands. The Japanese allowed the Americans to land on the island before launching a fierce attack that included kamikaze suicide attacks by Japanese aircraft. Japanese forces on Okinawa held out until June 1945; U.S. forces suffered over 60,000 casualties during the operation. Post-war planning Churchill, FDR, and Stalin at Yalta, two months before Roosevelt's death In late 1943, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin agreed to meet to discuss strategy and post-war plans at the Tehran Conference, which marked Roosevelt's first face-to-face meeting with Stalin. At the conference, Britain and the United States committed to opening a second front against Germany in 1944, while Stalin committed to entering the war against Japan at an unspecified date. Roosevelt also privately indicated acceptance of Soviet control of the Baltic states and Soviet plans to shift Poland's borders to the west. Stalin, meanwhile, committed to joining the war against Japan after the defeat of Germany. Post-war plans increasingly came to the fore as the Allies won several major victories in 1944. The wartime economic boom and the experience of the Great Depression convinced many Americans of the need to lower trade barriers. Lend-Lease agreements included provisions for eliminating tariffs, and the U.S. especially desired the dismantlement of the British Imperial Preference system. At the Bretton Woods Conference, the Allies agreed to the creation of the International Monetary Fund, which would provide for currency stabilization, and the World Bank, which would fund post-war rebuilding. Taking up the Wilsonian mantle, Roosevelt also pushed for the establishment of the United Nations, a permanent intergovernmental organization that would succeed the League of Nations. Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin met for a second time at the February 1945 Yalta Conference. With the end of the war in Europe approaching, Roosevelt's primary focus was on convincing Stalin to enter the war against Japan; the Joint Chiefs had estimated that an American invasion of Japan would cause as many as one million American casualties. In return for the Soviet Union's entrance into the war against Japan, the Soviet Union was promised control of Asian territories such as Sakhalin Island. With the Soviet Union in control of much of Eastern Europe by early 1945, Roosevelt had little leverage over Soviet actions in Eastern Europe. He did not push for the immediate evacuation of Soviet soldiers from Poland, but he did win the issuance of the Declaration on Liberated Europe, which promised free elections in countries that had been occupied by Germany. Against Soviet pressure, Roosevelt and Churchill refused to consent to imposing huge reparations and deindustrialization on Germany after the war. Roosevelt's role in the Yalta Conference has been controversial; critics charge that he naively trusted the Soviet Union to allow free elections in Eastern Europe, while supporters argue that there was little more that Roosevelt could have done for the Eastern European countries given the Soviet occupation and the need for cooperation with the Soviet Union during and after the war. =Founding the United Nations= At the Yalta Conference, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin agreed to the establishment of the United Nations, as well as the structure of the United Nations Security Council, which would be charged with ensuring international peace and security. The participants at Yalta also agreed that the United Nations would convene for the first time in San Francisco in April 1945 in the United Nations Conference on International Organization. Roosevelt considered the United Nations to be his most important legacy. He provided continuous backstage political support inside the United States, and with Churchill and Stalin abroad. He made sure that leading Republicans were on board, especially Senators Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan,James A. Gazell, \\"Arthur H. Vandenberg, Internationalism, and the United Nations.\\" Political Science Quarterly 88#3 (1973): 375-394. online and Warren Austin of Vermont.George T. Mazuzan. Warren R. Austin at the U. N., 1946-1953 (Kent State UP, 1977). The Allies had agreed to the basic structure of the new body at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in 1944. The Big Four of the United States, Britain, Soviet Union and China would make the major decisions, with France added later to provide permanent members of the all-powerful Security Council. Each had a veto power, thus avoiding the fatal weakness of the League of Nations, which had theoretically been able order its members to act in defiance of their own parliaments.Townsend Hoopes and Douglas Brinkley, FDR and the Creation of the U. N. (1997) =Anti- imperialism= British, French, and Dutch leaders all hoped to retain or reclaim their colonial possessions after the war. The U.S. was committed to granting independence to the Philippines following the end of the war, and Roosevelt frequently pressured Churchill to similarly commit to the independence of India, Burma, Malaya, and Hong Kong. His motives included principled opposition to colonialism, practical concern for the outcome of the war, and the need to build support for the U.S. in a future independent India. Churchill was deeply committed to imperialism and pushed back hard. Because the U.S. needed British cooperation in India to support China, Roosevelt had to draw back on his anti-colonialism.Kenton J. Clymer, \\"Franklin D. Roosevelt, Louis Johnson, India, and Anticolonialism: Another Look.\\" Pacific Historical Review 57#3 (1988): 261-284. online That annoyed Indian nationalist leaders, though most of those leaders were in British prisons for the duration because they would not support the war against Japan.William Roger Louis, Imperialism at Bay: The United States and the Decolonization of the British Empire, 1941‚Äì1945 (1987)Eric S. Rubin, \\"America, Britain, and Swaraj: Anglo-American Relations and Indian Independence, 1939‚Äì1945.\\" India Review 10.1 (2011): 40-80. online Roosevelt also promised to return Chinese territories seized by Japan since 1895, and ended the practice of American special rights in China. Election of 1944 1944 electoral vote results Unlike 1940, Roosevelt openly sought re-election in 1944, and he faced little opposition for the Democratic nomination. Roosevelt favored Henry Wallace or James Byrnes as his running mate in 1944, but Wallace was unpopular among conservatives in the party, while Byrnes was opposed by liberals and Catholics (Byrnes was an ex- Catholic). At the behest of party leaders, Roosevelt accepted Missouri Senator Harry S. Truman, who was acceptable to all factions of the party. Truman was best known for his battle against corruption and inefficiency in wartime spending as the head of the Truman Committee. Thomas E. Dewey, the Governor of New York and an internationalist, was the odds-on favorite and easily won the nomination at the 1944 Republican National Convention. The GOP lambasted FDR and his administration for domestic corruption, bureaucratic inefficiency, tolerance of Communism, and military blunders. Dewey largely avoided foreign policy issues because of the deep split in his party between internationalists and isolationists. Labor unions threw their all-out support behind Roosevelt. Roosevelt won the 1944 election by a comfortable margin with 53.4% of the popular vote and 432 out of the 531 electoral votes.Robert A. Divine, Foreign policy and U.S. presidential elections, 1940-1948 (1974) p 154 online. Final days and death Last photograph of Roosevelt, taken the day before his death (April 11, 1945) After returning to the United States from the Yalta Conference, Roosevelt addressed Congress on March 1, and many were shocked to see how old, thin and frail he looked. He spoke while seated in the well of the House, an unprecedented concession to his physical incapacity. Still in full command mentally, he firmly stated his primary commitment to a powerful United Nations: > The Crimean Conference [Yalta] ought to spell the end of a system of > unilateral action, the exclusive alliances, the spheres of influence, the > balances of power, and all the other expedients that have been tried for > centuries‚Äîand have always failed. We propose to substitute for all these, a > universal organization in which all peace-loving nations will finally have a > chance to join. Roosevelt had been in declining health since at least 1940, and by 1944 he was noticeably fatigued. In March 1944, shortly after his 62nd birthday, he underwent testing and was found to have high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, and coronary artery disease. His heart was failing and there was no cure. On April 12, 1945, he died from a massive cerebral hemorrhage (stroke). Less than a month after his death, on May 8, the war in Europe ended. Harry Truman, who had become president upon Roosevelt's death, dedicated Victory in Europe Day and its celebrations to Roosevelt's memory. Truman kept the flags across the U.S. at half-staff for the remainder of the 30-day mourning period, saying that his only wish was \\"that Franklin D. Roosevelt had lived to witness this day.\\" As the Japanese remained in the war, Truman considered authorizing an invasion of the Japanese island of Kyushu, but instead ordered the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki after being informed that the Manhattan Project had successfully developed nuclear weapons. The Russians then invaded as they had promised. The helpless Japanese surrendered on the terms that the emperor would remain. Historical reputation President Donald Trump quotes Roosevelt's address to the nation during a D-Day commemoration event on 5 June 2019 in Portsmouth, England. The rapid expansion of government programs that occurred during Roosevelt's term redefined the role of the government in the United States, and Roosevelt's advocacy of government social programs was instrumental in redefining liberalism for coming generations. Roosevelt's direct appeals to the public, legislative leadership, and executive reorganization dramatically changed the powers and responsibilities of the president. The New Deal Coalition that he established transformed national politics, ushering in the Fifth Party System.James Ciment, Encyclopedia of the Great Depression and the New Deal (2001) Vol. 1 p. 6 Through his actions before and during World War II, Roosevelt firmly established a leadership role for the United States on the world stage. His isolationist critics faded away, and even the Republicans joined in his overall policies. Both during and after his terms, critics of Roosevelt questioned not only his policies and positions, but even more so the consolidation of power in the White House at a time when dictators were taking over Europe and Asia.Black, Franklin Delano Roosevelt: Champion of Freedom (2005) p. 272. Many of the New Deal programs were abolished during the war by FDR's opponents. The powerful new wartime agencies were set up to be temporary and expire at war's end. The internment of Japanese-Americans is frequently criticized as a major stain on Roosevelt's record. After Roosevelt's death, his widow continued to be a forceful presence in U.S. and world politics, serving as delegate to the conference which established the United Nations and championing civil rights and liberalism generally. Truman replaced the Roosevelt cabinet members but the New Deal coalition persisted into the 1960s. Young New Dealer Lyndon B. Johnson as president in 1964-1966 revived the energy and liberalism of the mid 1930s. In polls of historians and political scientists, Roosevelt is consistently ranked as one of the three greatest presidents alongside George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Summing up Roosevelt's impact, historian William E. Leuchtenburg writes: > Franklin Delano Roosevelt served as President from March 1933 to April 1945, > the longest tenure in American history. He may have done more during those > twelve years to change American society and politics than any of his > predecessors in the White House, save Abraham Lincoln. Of course, some of > this was the product of circumstances; the Great Depression and the rise of > Germany and Japan were beyond FDR's control. But his responses to the > challenges he faced made him a defining figure in American history. See also *First and second terms of the presidency of Franklin D.

The engine weights approximately 108 metric tonne (106.3 imperial tons). The locomotive is used exclusively on railroads in Argentina having been built for use on the broad gauge routes in the country.  History  In 1956 American Locomotive Company (ALCO), responded to an order for 130 diesel electric locomotives for use in the Republic of Argentina. Three contracts were signed for the Ferrocarril Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, Ferrocarril General Bartolom√© Mitre, and the Ferrocarril General San Mart√≠n. The engines were built at ALCO's Schenectady, New York factory in 1957, with the finished locomotives for export shipped from 1958-1959. The locomotives' electrical systems were made using General Electric components, and the air brake system was built using Westinghouse parts. The ALCO RSD-16 was one of the first North American built locomotives to be used in large quantities in Argentina. The 30 locomotives that Ferrocarril Nacional Domingo Faustino Sarmiento owned were not well suited for that line due to a lack of on-line traffic. From 1964-1967, 20 of those engines were leased to the San Mart√≠n line although they would later return to the Sarmiento. During the same era, several engines from the Mitre and San Mart√≠n were loaned to the Ferrocarril Nacional General Roca where they were put in use between Mar del Plata and San Carlos de Bariloche. During the 1970s the RSD-16's were heavily used in services between C√≥rdoba, Rosario, Mendoza, Santa Rosa, and the resorts in Mar del Plata. In 1978, one engine was rebuilt with a FIAT A-230-12 diesel engine replacing the original ALCO 251 engine block. In 1980/1981, 16 other locomotives were rebuilt with 251-C Bombardier engines imported from Canada. Materfer would later use shop space at an Electro-Motive Diesel plant in Argentina to build new engine blocks for use in the RSD-16's.

The diplomatic row was a result of the discovery of the corpse of Joanna Demafelis, a Filipino domestic worker working in Kuwait which has been inside an abandoned warehouse since November 2016. In response to the discovery, President Rodrigo Duterte ordered the suspension of deployment of Filipino migrant workers to Kuwait and organized a voluntary repatriation program for Filipinos already working in Kuwait. The move was criticized by the Kuwaiti government but both the Philippines and Kuwait went on to cooperate regarding the Demafelis murder case leading to the conviction of Demafelis' killers in absentia as well as improve the working conditions of Filipino migrant workers in Kuwait in general. However relations were further strained in late-April after a video emerged showing Philippine embassy officials purportedly rescuing Filipino maids from allegedly abusive employers. Kuwait called the operations as a violation of its sovereignty, expelled the Philippine Ambassador to Kuwait and recalled its own envoy in Manila. Background A diplomatic crisis between Kuwait and the Philippines began when the killing of Joanna Demafelis, a Filipino domestic worker working in Kuwait, came to public attention in 2018. The Philippine Department of Labor and Employment directed its staff to stop processing deployment certificates to Filipinos seeking to work on Kuwait on January 19, 2018 following a series of death of Filipino domestic workers mentioned by President Rodrigo Duterte in a speech the day before. Duterte has requested for a total ban of Filipino worker deployment to Kuwait. The case of Demafelis was the particular incident that resulted to the ban. Demafelis had been killed two years earlier and her death only came to public attention when her corpse was found inside a freezer in a warehouse abandoned since November 2016. It was on February 12, 2018, that DOLE officially enforced a deployment ban of Filipino migrant workers in Kuwait. It was clarified that seafarers boarding from Kuwait, rehired workers who would be returning to the gulf country, and tourists are exempted from the ban. In addition to the deployment ban, the Philippine government has offered Filipino workers already in Kuwait to be voluntarily repatriated. There are around 250,000 Filipinos working in Kuwait, 65 percent of which are domestic helpers, according to the Philippine embassy in 2018. Developments =Kuwaiti government response= The Kuwaiti government has criticized the migrant worker ban imposed by the Philippines in gulf country and has stated that all cases of alleged abuse against Filipino migrant workers are being handled by its laws. The National Assembly of Kuwait has discussed the situation of the Filipino migrant workers in the country. On April 3, 2018, the Kuwait government announced that it aims to recruit more Ethiopians as domestic workers to compensate for deficit in the labor force caused by its diplomatic row with the Philippines. =Repatriation of Filipino workers= The Philippine Ambassador to Bahrain speaking with Filipino workers from Kuwait who are transiting through the Bahrain International Airport. By the end of March 2018, 4,000 Filipino workers has been voluntarily repatriated from Kuwait and the Philippine government is negotiating with Kuwait for the repatriation of 6,000 more workers =Demafelis murder case= Lebanese man Nader Essam Assaf, and his Syrian wife were accused for the killing of Demafelis. With the help of Interpol the two were detained in the Syrian capital of Damascus in February 2018. The Syrian government handed custody of Assaf to Lebanon while Assaf's wife remained in Syria. On April 1, 2018, a Kuwaiti court convicted the couple of murder and sentenced them to death by hanging. They were tried in absentia. =April 21 Philippine embassy operation= Relations between the two countries became more strained when a video emerged depicting operations of Philippine embassy officials purportedly rescuing Filipino maids from alleged abusive employers. The operation conducted on April 21, 2018 was seen by Kuwait as a \\"flagrant\\" violation of its sovereignty. Filipino diplomats in the Philippines insist that the operations were not clandestine. Two embassy staff members were alleged to have encourage Filipino migrant workers to leave their employers. Presidential Guest House in Davao City on April 23, 2018. The Philippine government on April 24 apologized for the incident saying it acknowledges Kuwait has its own laws while maintaining that the welfare of Filipino migrant workers are also within its interest. The following day, Kuwait declared Philippine Ambassador Renato Villa persona non grata demanding Villa to leave the gulf country within the week, and recalled its envoy in Manila for consultations. The Philippines called the move \\"deeply disturbing\\" and said that Kuwait \\"reneged\\" on an earlier agreement to cooperate. Kuwait arrested four drivers and three diplomats involved in the operation and pressed charges against them. Following a meeting between officials of the two countries, the four drivers involved were released and the charges against them were dropped. Agreement =Negotiations= Authorities from both countries have been engaged in talks to defuse diplomatic tensions. On February 14, 2018, the governments of Kuwait and the Philippines announced they come to consensus to sign an agreement on working conditions regulations. Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte has also been invited to make a state visit to Kuwait. Duterte, on March 6, laid two conditions for the labor deployment ban on Kuwait to be lifted; the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding on labor policies between Kuwait and the Philippines, and that \\"justice be served\\" in regards to the death of Joanna Demafelis. On March 16, a draft agreement was accomplished by officials from the two countries and was expected to be signed in Kuwait in two weeks. Despite Kuwait's action on the Philippine Ambassador and its own envoy in Manila, Philippine Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano stated on April 25, that the agreement is now planned to be signed in the Philippines and the Kuwait government has followed-up regarding the agreement. Cayetano also encouraged Duterte to accept Kuwait's invitation to make a state visit to the Middle Eastern country. However, President Rodrigo Duterte shortly declared that the labor deployment ban as \\"permanent\\". Duterte also said that the signing of the labor agreement with Kuwait will not push through and that he will not make a visit to the gulf country. Harry Roque, the Philippine presidential spokesperson later contradicted Duterte's statement saying that the ban is not \\"permanent\\" and may still be lifted. =Signing= Signing of the \\"Agreement on the Employment of Domestic Workers\\" between Kuwait in the Philippines which was led by Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sabah Al-Khalid Al-Sabah and Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano. The memorandum of agreement (MoU) entitled \\"Agreement on the Employment of Domestic Workers\\" between the Philippines and Kuwait was signed by representatives of Kuwait and the Philippines on May 11, 2018. The two countries had a consensus on labor matters which covered all migrant domestic workers in Kuwait regardless of their nationality. Under the deal, certain rights of migrant workers were recognized: They can't have their passports and other travel documents kept by their employers; and they have the right to use their mobile phones. Workers are now also entitled to be provided food, housing, clothing, and health insurance by their employers and at least a day off from work each week. Filipino workers can't be a transferred to another employer without the consent of the worker or approval from the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA). Contract renewals which used to be automatic now had to be subject to approval of the POEA. =Aftermath of the deal signing= Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano has announced that a new Philippine Ambassador to Kuwait will be appointed and that he will advised Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte to lift the deployment ban of Filipino workers to Kuwait. Duterte on his part has stated that he is open to lifting the ban following the signing of the deal. On May 12, 2018, a partial lifting of the ban was announced by the Philippine government allowing the deployment of \\"skilled\\" and \\"semi-skilled\\" workers to Kuwait and Philippine Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque has stated that relations between the two countries has normalized. Duterte ordered the deployment ban to be fully lifted on May 16 and on May 22 he declared that his country's relation with Kuwait is now \\"okay\\". Killing of Villavende The killing of another Filipino worker Jeanelyn Villavende in December 2019 tested Kuwaiti‚ÄìPhilippine relations. While a partial deployment ban was imposed by the Philippines for Filipino workers seeking to work in the Gulf state, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said that the response of Kuwaiti authorities to the case is more satisfactory this time with the suspect of Villavende's case already detained. However, there are calls to impose more stringent deployment restrictions after Kuwaiti authorities are accused of whitewashing the case since the autopsy report they sent to their Philippine counterparts only showed the possible cause of death of Villavende and a separate autopsy by the Philippine National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) suggests that the Filipino worker may have also been raped. The NBI report convinced Philippine Labor secretary Silvestre Bello to threaten to impose a total deployment ban of Filipino workers to Kuwait. The total deployment ban of workers to Kuwait will remain in effect ‚Äúuntil we get justice for Ms [Jeanelyn] Villavende and a consensus on the standard employment contract,‚Äù Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III said in a press briefing on Thursday. ‚ÄúIf we cannot get that, there will be no deployment. It has to be simultaneous,‚Äù Bello added of the ban approved on Wednesday in a Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) resolution.

Saddle point problems arise in the discretization of Stokes flow and in the mixed finite element discretization of Poisson's equation. For positive-definite problems, like the unmixed formulation of the Poisson equation, most discretization schemes will converge to the true solution in the limit as the mesh is refined. For saddle point problems, however, many discretizations are unstable, giving rise to artifacts such as spurious oscillations. The LBB condition gives criteria for when a discretization of a saddle point problem is stable.  Saddle point problems  The abstract form of a saddle point problem can be expressed in terms of Hilbert spaces and bilinear forms. Let V and Q be Hilbert spaces, and let a : V \\\\times V \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}, b : V \\\\times Q \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} be bilinear forms. Let f \\\\in V^*, g \\\\in Q^* where V^*, Q^* are the dual spaces. The saddle-point problem for the pair a, b is to find a pair of fields u in V, p in Q such that, for all v in V and q in Q, :\\\\begin{align}a(u, v) + b(v, p) & = \\\\langle f, v\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ b(u, q) & = \\\\langle g, q\\\\rangle.\\\\end{align} For example, for the Stokes equations on a d-dimensional domain \\\\Omega, the fields are the velocity u and pressure p, which live in respectively the Sobolev space H^1(\\\\Omega)^d and the Lebesgue space L^2(\\\\Omega). The bilinear forms for this problem are :\\\\begin{align}a(u, v) & = \\\\int_\\\\Omega \\\\mu abla u : abla v\\\\,dx \\\\\\\\\\\\ b(u, q) & = \\\\int_\\\\Omega ( abla\\\\cdot u)q\\\\,dx,\\\\end{align} where \\\\mu is the viscosity. Another example is the mixed Laplace equation (also called the Darcy equation) where the fields are again the velocity u and pressure p, which live in respectively the spaces H_\\\\text{div}(\\\\Omega)^d and L^2(\\\\Omega). Here, the bilinear forms for the problem are :\\\\begin{align}a(u, v) & = \\\\int_\\\\Omega u \\\\cdot v\\\\,dx \\\\\\\\\\\\ b(u, q) & = \\\\int_\\\\Omega ( abla\\\\cdot u)q\\\\,dx,\\\\end{align} where \\\\mu is the viscosity.  Statement of the theorem  Suppose that a and b are both continuous bilinear forms, and moreover that a is coercive on the kernel of b: :a(v, v) \\\\ge \\\\alpha\\\\v\\\\_V^2 for all v such that b(v, q) = 0 for all q \\\\in Q. If b satisfies the inf‚Äìsup or Ladyzhenskaya‚ÄìBabu≈°ka‚ÄìBrezzi condition :\\\\sup_{v \\\\in V, v eq 0}\\\\frac{b(v, q)}{\\\\v\\\\_V} \\\\ge \\\\beta\\\\q\\\\_Q for all q, then there exists a unique solution u, p of the saddle-point problem. Moreover, there exists a constant C such that :\\\\u\\\\_V + \\\\p\\\\_Q \\\\le C(\\\\f\\\\_{V^*} + \\\\g\\\\_{Q^*}).

He served as the logistics head of the Red Army during the Long March and of the Yan'an Communist headquarters during the Second Sino-Japanese War. In 1945, he was among the first three officers awarded the rank of lieutenant general by the Communist Party of China, together with Peng Zhen and Chen Yun. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, he served as the country's first Minister of Trade and then Minister of Foreign Trade until his death in 1967.  Early life  Ye was born in 1893 into a poor peasant family in Xinxing County, Guangdong, Qing dynasty China. He was admitted to Guangdong Provincial Law and Politics School in 1912, and worked in the local governments of Jiangmen and Xinxing after graduating in 1914. In June 1925, he organized the Jiangmen General Union and participated in the Great Canton‚ÄìHong Kong strike. He joined the Communist Party of China (CPC) at the end of that year.  Red Army and Long March  After Chiang Kai-shek turned against the Communists at the Shanghai massacre in 1927, Ye participated in the Guangzhou Uprising (1927) and the Baise Uprising (1929) led by Deng Xiaoping. He was a co-founder of the Seventh Army of the Chinese Red Army and served as Director of its Political Department. After the Seventh Army reached the Jiangxi Soviet, the central Communist base, he was appointed Director of the Logistics Department of the Red Army. When the Long March began in October 1934, Ye was in charge of logistics for the Red Army under extremely difficult conditions, as the Communist force was under constant attacks from the Kuomintang and its allies. In his memoirs, Yang Shangkun, who later served as President of the People's Republic of China, recalls a feast Ye prepared for the officers in Hadapu, Gansu, after the army starved for days following the Battle of Lazikou. He remembered that Ye specifically asked everybody not to overeat, as it could be dangerous immediately after starvation. After the Red Army reached Yan'an a year later, Ye became the logistics head of the new Communist base there, and of the Eighth Route Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War. He worked on developing agriculture, manufacturing, foreign trade, and medical care for the Yan'an base, which was under economic blockade from the Kuomintang government in Chongqing.  Northeast China  After the surrender of Japan in 1945, the former Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo in Northeast China became a major area of contention between the Communists and the Kuomintang. The CPC Central Committee sent a six-person team to Shenyang to negotiate with the Soviet Union which had taken over the region from Japan. To facilitate their negotiation with Soviet commanders who held military ranks, the CPC awarded Peng Zhen, Chen Yun and Ye the rank of lieutenant general, Wu Xiuquan the rank of major general, and two other officers the rank of colonel. It was the first time the CPC issued military ranks. Ye served as Minister of Finance and Minister of Commerce in the , the transitional government in the Northeast in preparation for the establishment of the People's Republic of China.  People's Republic of China  With the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in October 1949, Ye was appointed the country's first Minister of Trade. In August 1952, the ministry's foreign trade division was expanded into the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and Ye became its inaugural minister. It was a large ministry with many layers of organization, which served not only commercial, but also diplomatic functions. Ye served as head of the important ministry until his death in 1967. A major task of his was to circumvent the trade embargo against the PRC by the United States and its allies. Under the leadership of Zhou Enlai, he developed trade relations with Asian and African countries and signed China's first trade deal with Ceylon. After the Sino- Soviet split, Ye played a key role in China's export drive in order to repay Soviet debts and finance grain purchases from abroad. Ye suffered a stroke in 1961 when he was on an official trip in Guangzhou. He became incapacitated by another stroke in 1964, and his deputy Lin Haiyun took over as acting minister in 1965. Already in very poor health, Ye came under persecution when the Cultural Revolution began in 1966. He was pressured to incriminate his former superior Deng Xiaoping, but refused to do so. As he was bedridden, his doctors prevented the Red Guards from taking him to struggle sessions, and his wife Ma Luzhen () was taken in his place. Ye died on 27 June 1967 at the age of 74. He was politically rehabilitated after the end of the Cultural Revolution.

The documentary alleges that a spate of fatal cancers and other illnesses is due in part to the factory's emissions and improper waste disposal of known carcinogens including formaldehyde, dioxin, acetaldehyde, and chloroform. The plant has been owned by David Koch and Charles Koch since 2005. The film includes testimony from whistleblower David Guice, whose company was allegedly contracted to quietly dispose of \\"two hundred thousand cubic yards of 'ash' dredged from the Georgia-Pacific paper mill‚Äôs sediment ponds\\" across Georgia-Pacific property in the town. Baptist pastor David Bouie, 'riverkeeper' Cheryl Slavant, and others organize the Crossett community, many of whom work for the plant, and engage the regional Environmental Protection Agency office with limited results. The movie features commentary from American news commentator Van Jones.  Background  = Georgia-Pacific Paper Mill = Georgia-Pacific employs nearly 1,200 people in Arkansas. In Crossett, Arkansas, with an estimated population of 5,507 in 2010, many residents are employed by the local Georgia-Pacific Paper Mill. In fact, \\"most residents are fiercely protective of the plant.\\" However, there have been allegations that the Georgia-Pacific Paper Mill is responsible for clusters of cancer deaths in Crossett, particularly among mill-workers and those who live close to the mill. (Although, the \\"Arkansas Department of Health cancer registry shows the age-adjusted rate of cancer deaths in Ashley County, Arkansas to be slightly below the state average.\\") The plant, which employs many of the town's residents, \\"emits upwards of 1.5 million pounds of toxic chemicals every year according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Toxic Release Inventory,\\" including \\"known carcinogens such as formaldehyde, dioxin, acetaldehyde and chloroform\\". The plant also emits hydrogen sulfide into both the air, and the water, earning one creek the nickname \\"Stink Creek\\". Residents have complained about the plant's emissions since the 1990s, causing Georgia-Pacific to offer thousands of dollars to residents, in return for \\"signed release forms absolving the company of any responsibility for damages to the residents‚Äô property ‚Äî or their health.\\" In 2012, the Louisiana Environmental Action Network commissioned air-monitoring stations in Crossett that found \\"hydrogen sulfide levels were highest nearest the stream and that higher levels corresponded with greater and more severe symptoms among residents.\\" In November 2015, an EPA inspection \\"found 33 areas where Georgia- Pacific was noncompliant with federal laws and dozens of other areas of concern,\\" including \\"several defective pieces of equipment that were allowing unidentified gases to escape into the atmosphere\\" and \\"filtrate tanks and storage tanks that were knowingly being vented into the atmosphere rather than through a controlled system, as required by the Clean Air Act.\\" = Ouachita River = The Ouachita River begins in western Arkansas, upstream from Lake Ouachita, flows south and passes about 10 miles west of Crossett. In 2007, alarmed by the change of the river from \\"vibrant blue\\" at its source in western Arkansas, to a \\"dark coffee color\\" with a \\"foul stench\\", Cheryl Slavant began the Ouachita Riverkeeper organization to \\"restore and monitor the Ouachita River watershed\\". However, Georgia-Pacific believes the \\"water treatment system is thorough, carefully monitored and in full compliance with the law,\\" including the water treatment canal known as 'Stink Creek'. They referenced their permit from the Arkansas Department for Environmental Quality. However, an employee from Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility alleges that, because the water known as 'Stink Creek' is a natural body of water known as Coffee Creek, it is protected under the 1972 Clean Water Act. The United States Geological Survey maps seem to support this allegation, showing Coffee Creek originating inside the land that Georgia- Pacific would eventually own. However, the Clean Water Act only specifies that pollutants not \\"disrupt the activities in those waters, such as fishing, drinking and supporting animal life\\". Since the Arkansas Department for Environmental Quality found that the water affected by the pollutants does not have \\"fishable/swimmable or domestic water supply uses\\", the use of the water by Georgia-Pacific was not illegal. However, a December 2007 Use Attainability Analysis (UAA) by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found that ‚Äúaside from the fish and macroinvertebrate communities using Coffee Creek and Mossy Lake, other wildlife live in or frequently contact the [Georgia-Pacific] effluent. Muskrat, beaver, nutria, turtles and ducks are known to use Coffee Creek and Mossy Lake, sometimes in very large numbers.‚Äù Relevantly, ‚Äúthe waters of Coffee Creek and Mossy Lake have the potential to support aquatic life indicative of streams in the ecoregion.‚Äùhttps://cars.uark.edu/ourwork/Water-Quality-Quantity- Management/final- report_ouachita_dec07.pdfhttps://www.peer.org/assets/docs/ar/3_16_11_EPA_factsheet_ouachitariver.pdf In response, Georgia-Pacific accused the EPA of \\"acting without its knowledge and demanding the opportunity to redo the study using a contractor of its choosing,\\" causing the UAA to be discarded. = Ouachita Riverkeeper = After a phone call from citizens in Crossett, who believed that the Georgia-Pacific Paper Mill was the source of much of Ouachita River pollution, Cheryl Slavant helped organize Crossett Concerned Citizens for Environmental Justice. Members included Baptist pastor David Bouie, who features in the documentary. In May 2016, \\"the Ouachita Riverkeeper and Louisiana Environmental Action Network filed petitions with the EPA under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act demanding that it take action against the plant; they argue that its waste disposal disproportionately affects nearby African-American neighborhoods\\" with help from the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic. The Ouachita Riverkeeper organization currently lists Georgia-Pacific Paper Mill in Crossett as its main environmental threat to its mission for releasing \\"toxic chemicals, carcinogens, and toxic metals.\\"  Reception  The film opened at the Mill Valley Film Festival. Company Town has received positive responses from critics. It received an 83% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The Los Angeles Times called the film \\"powerful\\", nothing that \\"Although the movie... could use some second-half tightening and a bit more objectivity (Georgia-Pacific and Koch Industries did not comment in the film), it remains a vital, eye-opening portrait.\\" The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film paints the EPA as \\"incapable of stopping flagrant polluters even when a community and journalists did its investigations,\\" and \\"will add to the case files of industry-vs.-America crime-fighting\\". However, \\"the film would be well served by some objective third-party input and hard stats: Kottke-Masocco and Sardarian have mostly offered us (horrific) anecdotal evidence, along with general discussion of Koch Industries' efforts to quash regulation\\" Ben Kenisberg of the New York Times wrote that the film \\"feels fueled by pure desperation\\" and the \\"rudimentary qualities of the filmmaking... somehow add to its urgency.\\" Kenisberg comments that \\"staff members from the Environmental Protection Agency... do not appear overly concerned by the seriousness of the complaints.\\"  See also  * Koch Brothers Exposed * Dark Money * Citizen Koch  References   External links   Ouachita Riverkeeper website * ","title":"Company Town (film)"},{"id":"57237920","text":"Exoprosopa rostrifera is a species of bee flies in the family Bombyliidae.

It was originally commissioned by the National Power Corporation (NAPOCOR).  Route description  The line starts at Barangay San Jose Matulid, Mexico, Pampanga and passes through East Gate Village (where the former h-frame wood pole was located before being replaced by a three-level steel pole). It crosses into North Luzon Expressway (NLEx), Hermosa‚ÄìDuhat‚ÄìBalintawak transmission line (first and second time), Jose Abad Santos Avenue (Olongapo‚ÄìGapan Road), and MacArthur Highway in San Fernando, Pampanga. Between Bacolor and Guagua are 19 lattice towers that were used for the Lahar-Affected Transmission Line Relocation Project, where the line crosses the avenue (second time) and Hermosa‚ÄìDuhat‚ÄìBalintawak line (third time). It will also cross and run parallel with the Hermosa‚ÄìSan Jose transmission line from lattice towers 28 to 37. After the intersection of Guagua‚ÄìSta Rita Road and Jose Abad Santos Avenue, it will now parallel with the Hermosa‚ÄìGuagua 69,000 volt line. It continues on a straight route, crosses into Jose Abad Santos Avenue (third time) and Hermosa‚ÄìDuhat‚ÄìBalintawak line (fourth time), and turns right. At Lubao, the line crosses into an avenue for the fourth time and the said other line (fifth time). It turns to the left and continues until the line turns right upon approaching Hermosa Substation, where it ends. The four new bipole towers (totalling to 8 steel poles) and some new steel poles are located in Lubao and near Hermosa Substation, respectively.  Improvements  The National Transmission Corporation (TransCo) relocated its Bacolor‚ÄìGuagua section through the Lahar-Affected Transmission Line Relocation Project, using 19 new steel towers. It was completed in April 2003. In 2015, wood pole 5A was replaced with a more durable three-level steel pole. The reconductoring of a line was done in 2017, with four new bipole towers (totalling to 8 steel poles) and poles near Hermosa Substation which were erected earlier in 2018.

The book was released on February 27, 2018, nearly two years after McNamara's death and two months before an arrest would be made in the case. The book's title is a reference to a direct quote spoken by the Golden State Killer to one of his victims: \\"You'll be silent forever, and I'll be gone in the dark.\\" Development After becoming interested in the crimes of what was then known as the \\"East Area Rapist\\" (among other names) McNamara wrote a 2013 Los Angeles magazine article about the serial killer, and ultimately signed a book deal with HarperCollins to write about the case. McNamara is credited with coining the moniker Golden State Killer to refer to the serial killer/rapist who had previously been referred to by various other names including the East Area Rapist, Original Night Stalker, Visalia Ransacker, East Bay Rapist and Diamond Knot Killer. McNamara's coining of the Golden State Killer moniker is credited with heightening awareness of the uncaught killer that operated throughout California. With her book two-thirds completed, McNamara died in her sleep on April 21, 2016 at the age of 46 due to an accidental prescription drug overdose in conjunction with atherosclerosis. Crime writer Paul Haynes, investigative journalist Billy Jensen, and McNamara's husband comedian Patton Oswalt helped complete the book following her death. Jensen later explained that while McNamara had completed numerous chapters for the book they were not in any particular order in her computer files; consequently he, Haynes and Oswalt mainly focused on sequencing her material and filling in gaps from her voluminous notes and copies of police documents.Billy Jensen (2019). Chase Darkness with Me: How One True-Crime Writer Started Solving Murders. Sourcebooks, The book McNamara's debut was released on February 27, 2018 and reached the top of The New York Times Best Seller list for non-fiction. The book remained on the list for 15 weeks. I'll Be Gone in the Dark contains an introduction by Gillian Flynn and afterword by Oswalt. Impact On April 25, 2018, the Sacramento Sheriff announced the April 24 arrest of a suspect in the Golden State Killer case: 72-year-old Joseph James DeAngelo (born November 8, 1945). DeAngelo, a former police officer in Auburn and Exeter, California, was arrested and charged with six counts of first-degree murder. Authorities in Sacramento, Orange, Santa Barbara, and Ventura counties prepared charges against DeAngelo for all twelve of the murders in the Golden State Killer case. Sheriff credited McNamara's dedication to the Golden State Killer case for raising publicity, but added that her work did not directly generate any critical tips or information that led to DeAngelo's arrest. The book and McNamara's work on the case are frequently discussed in the true crime podcast My Favorite Murder, which boasts a large fan base of true crime aficionados. The debut episode of the show \\"\\"Episode 1: My Firstest Murder\\" featured the case as well as discussion of McNamara's work. Prior to the arrest, \\"Episode 115: I'll Be Gone in the Dark at Skylight Books\\" featured Oswalt and Jensen discussing the book and their roles in finishing the project following McNamara's death. In that episode Oswalt discussed McNamara's writing process, including making \\"era-appropriate playlists to help her get into a proper mindset\\". Oswalt described finishing of the book as a bittersweet experience: \\"It's another part of her that's kind of gone. In a very sick way, not having the book done‚Äîand us working on it‚Äîmeant she was still here.\\" \\"Episode 118: Golden State Serial Killer Caught\\" released on April 26, 2018 (immediately after the arrest was made) featured Jensen discussing the case and his work on the book following McNamara's death. \\"Episode 122: Surprise! It's Paul Holes\\" featured Jensen and Holes discussing the case and the impact of McNamara's work. Following their involvement in the Golden State Killer case and McNamara's work, in 2019 Jensen and Holes began a podcast called Jensen & Holes: The Murder Squad where they discuss \\"unsolved murders, unidentified remains, and missing persons cases\\" with contributions from their listeners\\". The show is produced with the Exactly Right podcast network, which was created by My Favorite Murder hosts Georgia Hardstark and Karen Kilgariff. Adaptation In April 2018, HBO announced they had purchased the rights for I'll Be Gone in the Dark and were developing it into a documentary series. Filming for the series began April 24, 2018, directed in part by Academy Award-nominee and Emmy-winner Liz Garbus. The documentary premiered June 28, 2020.

For her last few years of service, she was renamed the Anne C. Maguire. History She departed New York City on her maiden cruise on February 8, bound for San Francisco under the command of Captain L. F. Doty. All three of her topsails were carried away on February 10, forcing her to put into Rio de Janeiro for repairs, departing on April 6 and reaching her destination on July 12. She left San Francisco on August 2 for Shanghai, arriving there 54 days later. The Golden State stopped at Anjer and Deal, Kent, arriving at the latter on February 9, 1854. She then returned to New York in ballast. Her second cruise was under Captain Barstow. The Golden State left New York City on May 25, 1854, reached San Francisco on September 28, departed on October 14 and arrived at Shanghai 42 days later. She then sailed for New York on January 1, 1855, arriving 88 1/2 days later. Originally built for Chambers & Heiser, she was sold in 1855 to A. A. Low & Brother. Her next two voyages saw her make port at San Francisco, Hong Kong and Foo Chow. Captain Hepburn took command for her fifth cruise, departing New York City on March 19, 1857, taking 93 days to reach Hong Kong and 93 days from Foo Chow to New York City. On her next voyage, a mutiny broke out off Penang on the way to Hong Kong. The mutineers fled to Penang after beating the officers and boatswain with handspikes, but were captured; the first mate died of his injuries. In the early 1860s, she worked in the grain and guano trades. In 1864, she returned to the China-Far East trade, delivering the largest cargo of tea to New York, valued at $1 million, in May 1867. In 1869, she underwent a major overhaul. Eventually, she was rerigged as a bark. The Golden State began her last cruise as an American ship on January 18, 1883, departing New York City for Anjer. However, she had to put into Rio de Janeiro due to a bad leak. There she was sold to D. & J. Maguire of Quebec, who renamed her Anne C. Maguire and placed her under the Argentine flag. She plied the Atlantic until December 1886, when she went ashore and broke up at Cape Elizabeth, Maine.

Kenny (3 March 1917 ‚Äì 13 January 2010) was an American philatelist and businessman. Kenny worked as manager of the stamp department of Macy's. He arranged the sale of the unique British Guiana 1c magenta in 1940, and continued to look after it for the next thirty years, often being mistaken for its owner. In the 1960s, Kenny made deals with a number of the Trucial States in order to print stamps on their behalf for sale to collectors. These Dune Stamps consisted of large numbers of brightly colored stamps whose topics had little or no relationships to their issuing countries. The arrangement ended when the United Arab Emirates was formed in 1971. Today, collectors generally ignore them. In 1965, Kenny was hired by the Prime Minister of the Cook Islands, Sir Albert Henry, to print stamps for collectors. Kenny's firm, Cook Islands Development Company, a subsidiary of his Kenny International Corporation, had the exclusive franchise as the nation's overseas postal agent, and splits the profits 50-50 with the government. In 1978 Henry asked Kenny for an advance of $337,000 on the next year's philatelics revenue to finance his re-election campaign. Henry used the money to fly voters in to the country, even though the money had been earmarked for the nation's old age pension scheme. The Chief Justice of the time, Sir Gaven Donne, nullified the extra votes and installed Thomas Davis as Prime Minister. In 1979, Kenny became the first American to plead guilty of violating the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits Americans from paying bribes overseas to increase business. The courts considered the advance a bribe, and Kenny was fined $50,000. He also returned the $337,000 to the Cook Islands government.

He led community based health services in the National Health Service. He was described as the \\"father of modern general practice\\" and also as \\"the Pope of Portuguese general practice\\". Early life John Horder was born on 9 December 1919, to Gerald Morley Horder, a quantity surveyor, and his wife Emma. He was a distant cousin of the eminent royal physician Lord Horder. Prior to having her children, Horder's mother Emma, played the violin and attended the Royal Academy of Music. His upbringing was in Ealing Green, west London. He was educated at Lancing College, Sussex. He originally wanted to be a professional musician in which aim he was influenced and inspired by his grandfather who was a congregational minister. He recalled sitting next to the church organist at the age of 10 and was once given the keys to St Mary's Church in Elsworthy Road, Primrose Hill, so that he could rehearse there, as well as frequently playing at Tewkesbury Abbey in Gloucestershire. He was also interested in literature, philosophy and medicine, and became an accomplished pianist and proficient in watercolour painting. Horder changed his mind about his ambitions at various times. His early education and schooling up until age 19, was concentrated on the humanities and, as a result, when he went up to Oxford University, he started as an open classical scholar, with breaks in Paris studying music. He subsequently switched to medicine as a result of the prospect of war in the 1930s and the desire to study human nature. Medical career =Early general practice= After studying medicine at the University of Oxford and then completing a medical registrar post at the London Hospital, Horder entered general practice in 1951 as a locum at John Wigg's practice at Kentish Town. Horder's wife, Elizabeth was already a part- time assistant there and he soon went into partnership with Wigg. The previous year had seen the publication of the J.S. Collings's report, which revealed stretched GPs in deprived, often sub-standard buildings with poor clinical standards. This was also a time when Horder was briefly chairman of the local division of the British Medical Association causing him to become increasingly disillusioned with general practice. He saw sarcasm, grumbling, and disturbing worries about money amongst his colleagues. In addition, there was a general opinion that the specialist was of superior status to the general practitioner. In 1952, as a result of the formation of the new College for General Practitioners founded particularly by John Hunt and Fraser Rose, Horder became one of its Foundation Associates. Horder was an advocate of generalism and in 1952, used the example of James Mackenzie, founder of the London Hospital's cardiac department and generalist to argue his point, asserting the importance of protecting generalists in an age of mounting specialism. In addition, he defined the position of the GP as an educator and researcher. Horder was hopeful that heroes of general practice would one day exist, as they did for other specialities. More than 50 years later, Marshall Marinker argued that Horder had entered \\"the first rank of these leaders\\". For a short time, Horder was involved with Michael Balint's research at the Tavistock, the report of which was published in The Doctor, His Patient and the Illness in 1957. =Other medical roles= In 1974, he co-founded the Leeuwenhorst European Study Group that produced an agreement about the role of general practice. He was at one time president of the section for general practice at the Royal Society of Medicine. Horder was elected president of the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) from 1979 to 1982. On taking up the role of RCGP president, Horder discovered that for young GPs, the college had uncertain significance and questionable meaning, with time constraints being a key issue. He chaired the review of general practice that produced The Future General Practitioner: Learning and Teaching. In addition, he was deeply involved in developing and implementing vocational training for general practice. He went on to found the Centre for the Advancement of Inter- professional Education (CAIPE) in 1987. He advised the Department of Health and Social Security on matters relating to general practice, a position he held for 6 years. By the late 1980s, general practice was held in much higher importance and seen as the cornerstone of the National Health Service. Horder was the first British general practitioner to be selected as a consultant to the World Health Organization. Illness There was a history of depression in Horder's family and he too suffered from bouts of severe low mood throughout his life. He had a number of major episodes, the first occurring during the Second World War when he was dismissed from duties and admitted to hospital. Despite the success of the RCGP in promoting his ideals, the strains of a demanding practice and RCGP work in the 1950s contributed to a second episode of severe depression. He was originally a Jungian and sceptical of chemically altering the mind but later became an advocate for anti- depressants, particularly monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI). He once described the pain of depression as more overwhelming than the pain of coronary thrombosis. He was involved in the treatment of Sylvia Path's depression in the last 3 months of her life (1962‚Äì63). Much later, he was deeply involved in the Defeat Depression campaign, organised by the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the RCGP. Later life and legacy He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). He instituted an annual John Horder Award for an \\"outstanding contribution by a member of the College staff\\". A family man, he constructed model diggers with push and pull levers for his grandchildren. Horder died on 31 May 2012. An annual John Horder Award is presented by the Royal Society of Medicine.
