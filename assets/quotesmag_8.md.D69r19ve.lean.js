His father, Antonius Struycken, was a lawyer and taught law at the University of Amsterdam. He was also a member of the Dutch Council of State, represented the Netherlands at the League of Nations and was a member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration of the Hague and of the Dutch Electoral Committee.

Through his work, started during the summer of 1949 and the creation of the Council of Europe, he played a significant role in the writing of the European Convention of Human Rights, signed on November 4, 1950, and in the creation of a European Commission of Human Rights (from 1954 to 1999) and of the European Court of Human Rights, to which every European citizen can now appeal, as Arnold Struycken had envisioned. He was named rapporteur of the committee of experts in charge, from March 1950, of the preliminary work designed to lay the ground for a European Convention of Human Rights.Conseil de l'Europe, Recueil des Travaux Pr√©paratoires de la Convention europ√©enne des Droits de l'Homme, vol. 4, √©d.

Along with other Council officials, he recommended that the prelude to the Ode to Joy be adopted as European anthem, after it was suggested as early as 1929 by the Count of Coudenhove-Kalergi, President of the Paneuropean Movement. Although the Ode to Joy became the unofficial European anthem in the 1950s, the decision to make it an official anthem was finally taken in 1971 by the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe. Arnold Struycken died at the age of 55 years, of a heart attack while at his desk of the Maison de l'Europe in Strasbourg. He was buried in the cimeti√®re du Nord in Strasbourg-Robertsau. = Personal life = Arnold Struycken married Marie-Louise Maas Geesteranus in 1926 and they had three children, Anton, Arnold and Jos√©phine. = Trivia = Arnold Struycken was also an uncle of Anton (Teun) Struycken, a lawyer and European Property Law Professor at the University of Nijmegen, of Carel Struycken (eng), actor playing in Hollywood comedies, in particular as Lurch in The Family Adams, and of the painter Peter Struycken (nl), these last two being sons of his cousin Huib Struycken.

Human Rights Watch  Brody was with Human Rights Watch from 1998 to 2016 and was an integral part of the organization‚Äôs efforts to hold perpetrators of large-scale human rights violations accountable for their crimes. Most notably, Brody directed Human Rights Watch‚Äôs participation in the landmark case of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet before the British House of Lords, a seminal case that many say marked the beginning of the end of impunity for powerful former heads of state. Brody credits the Pinochet case as the defining moment in pushing him to pursue similar cases that would serve as a \\"wake-up call\\" to tyrants and a ‚Äúspark of hope for victims.‚ÄùThe Associated Press, \\"Despot Crusade: American Human Rights Activist on Marathon Mission to try African Dictator\\", 3 July 2006, at Human Rights Watch.Associated Press, \\"U.S. Rights Lawyer on Quest to Try Habre\\", 2 July 2006, Online at Highbeam (subscription required).

Hiss√®ne Habr√© case  Brody has worked since 1999 with the victims of the former dictator of Chad, Hiss√®ne Habr√© to bring Habr√© and his accomplices to justice. Habr√© is accused of thousands of political killings and systematic torture when he ruled Chad from 1982 to 1990 and has been living in exile in Senegal ever since.

It was the first time ever that a head of state had been prosecuted in the courts of another country. The New York Times, among others, hailed the case as ‚Äúa Milestone for justice in Africa.‚Äù On April 27, 2017, an appeals court confirmed the verdict and ordered Habr√© to pay approximately 123 million euros in victim compensation. Also as a result of the victims‚Äô campaign, on March 25, 2015, a Chadian criminal court convicted 20 Habr√©-era security agents on charges of murder, torture, kidnapping and arbitrary detention.  Current Work  While away from Human Rights Watch in 2016-2017, Brody was active in human rights causes in the United States. In October 2016, he represented the journalist Amy Goodman, host of the television and radio show Democracy Now!, who was charged with criminal offenses for her reporting on an attack against Native American-led anti- pipeline protesters at Standing Rock, North Dakota. The charges were droppedSam Levin, \\"Judge rejects riot charges for journalist Amy Goodman after oil pipeline protest\\", The Guardian, 17 October 2016 In January 2017, Brody was elected to the International Commission of Jurists. In 2017, he returned to Human Rights Watch to work with victims of the former dictator of Gambia Yahya Jammeh who is now in exile in Equatorial Guinea. Brody organized a meeting between the victims of Hiss√®ne Habr√© and the victims of Yahya Jammeh and helped launch the ‚ÄúCampaign to Bring Yahya Jammeh and his Accomplices to Justice‚Äù- (‚Äú#Jammeh2Justice\\").

It was first published in paperback by DAW Books in June 1978. Plot Each volume of the Chronicles of Kylix is set on a different world in the magical solar system of the fictional star Kylix in the constellation of the Unicorn. The system consists of the five planets Zao, Olymbris, Thoorana, Zephrondus and Gulzund. The Wizard of Zao takes place on Zao. Oolb Votz, the titular wonder-working wizard, fat, green and full of himself, makes an unlikely hero, but nonetheless has a humorous romp of a quest he must undertake. He is accompanied on his journey by the 15-year-old Wild Girl Ooo, his newly purchased chela, who assists him as servant, apprentice and concubine. Strange beasts and stranger people are encountered along the way. The true identity of the wizard, a mystery in itself, is revealed in a surprise ending. The narrative is spiced with authorial asides and footnotes. Reception Robert M. Price, while noting that The Wizard of Zao was \\"Carter's favorite among his own novels,\\" judges the book \\"ingenious, but badly written, ... As in the sloppy Gondwane books, Carter lamely explains away various inconsistencies, or he claims to be guessing the answers, as if he, too, is merely a reader of his sources and cannot be any more consistent than they. [But w]hat is really unforgivable is the way Carter just chucks out all his critical canons for literary 'world-making' as set forth in Imaginary Worlds. Sword & Sorcery is supposed to be set in a pre-industrial era, yet here is Oolb Votz talking about 'enzymes' and 'blowing fuses.' ... Our narrator, too, is free in his comparisons of various things to a 'locomotive' or a 'dive bomber.' ... Perhaps he reasoned that the rules were different in a fantasy burlesque, but I cannot think him correct. If it's all right to have Chianti and locomotives, why bother setting the story on a fantasy world in the first place?\\"Price, pp. 73-74.

It aired on Fox in the United States on November 25, 2012. Plot Mr. Fischoeder, who needs a new attraction at Wonder Wharf, arrives at Bob's Burgers to seek guidance from the Belchers. Bob remembers that the town served as the filming location of a shark-themed ‚Äò80s B movie, The Deepening. The family discovers that the original prop shark from the movie is up for sale and convinces Fischoeder to buy it. However, Teddy ominously objects. At the unveiling of the shark, the Belchers find out Fischoeder has filled it with diesel. The shark, which is now able to move, nearly causes an accident by ripping off a woman‚Äôs prosthetic arm. Early the next morning, the Belcher kids sneak off to Wonder Wharf to steal the shark‚Äôs fin for \\"mechanical shark fin soup.\\" Gene mounts the shark with a knife to cut off its fin, but he accidentally knocks the shark off its perch: the kids leave, and Louise tells her siblings to act like they were \\"never there.\\" That same morning, Bob notices people panicking outside and goes to investigate. He arrives at Wonder Wharf to find the mechanical shark flopping around on the ground. Fischoeder reveals there is no way to stop the shark until it runs out of gas; furthermore, he is reluctant to stop it, as it is now drawing larger crowds than ever. Bob worries the shark will leave the wharf and pleads with Fischoeder, but it is already too late: the shark smashes through the gates of Wonder Wharf and runs amok in traffic. Bob, as ‚ÄúBlock Captain,‚Äù rallies the local business owners to figure out what to do about the shark. Tina, who empathized with the shark after watching The Deepening, tries to dissuade the townspeople from stopping its progress. After she impulsively confesses that she and the kids knocked over the shark, the townspeople begin to turn on the Belchers. But Teddy encourages the townspeople to work together, and they begin brainstorming how to stop the shark, which is now heading towards Bob's restaurant. Each of the townspeople's ideas goes horribly wrong and only serves to make the shark more dangerous: a spike strip becomes attached to the shark, an oil slick intended to ‚Äúslow its momentum‚Äù ends up making it faster, and after it hits a telephone pole, it becomes electrified. Finally, the shark falls into a hole in the ground that the townspeople dug to catch it. This seems to work until subterranean noises indicate the shark has eaten its way into Bob‚Äôs basement. Bob, Teddy, and Mort enter the restaurant to try and stop the shark. Teddy reveals the reason for his hatred of the shark: he acted as a lifeguard in The Deepening. While talking to a girl on set, the prop operator startled him with the shark, causing him to spill his drink on the girl and embarrass himself. Bob asks Teddy why he resents the shark instead of the operator; Teddy stops to consider this logic briefly before deciding he still hates the shark. The shark emerges from the ground, knocking Mort into the basement. Teddy falls into the shark‚Äôs mouth, though his \\"boydle\\" prevents him from being crushed by its teeth. Tina gets the idea to fill the shark with yogurt from their frozen yogurt machine, which has fallen inside the shark‚Äôs body. Bob is able to plug in the machine, and the shark, now filled with yogurt, finally ends its rampage. On a news report, Hugo, the health inspector and \\"Quadrant Captain,\\" takes credit for stopping the shark. Reception Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, saying \\"This sweet, hilarious confusion helps Bob‚Äôs Burgers to operate at the two levels it requires during the course of the episode. The character work keeps it grounded as an episode of Bob‚Äôs Burgers. Meanwhile, the monster-movie parody works in large part because, as everyone plays it straight, there‚Äôs Tina in the corner, defending a mechanical shark on the grounds that it was used in a movie to depict a confused shark. Bob tries to tell her that she‚Äôs wrong by comparing it to a toaster, but Tina‚Äôs empathy knows no bounds: 'Our toaster is also confused. It doesn‚Äôt know why we put bagels in it.'\\" Ross Bonaime of Paste gave the episode 8.3 out of 10, saying \\"The Deepening‚Äù is one of the more fulfilling episodes of Bob‚Äôs Burgers‚Äô third season, making the family one singular unit against the shark (even though Tina‚Äôs allegiances are split), and having the family forced against the town is a familiar scenario, but it still works well. ‚ÄúThe Deepening‚Äù has one focused storyline instead of splitting the family into several that don‚Äôt feel fully fleshed out, and that makes for one of the funniest episodes so far this year.\\" The episode received a 2.0 rating and was watched by a total of 4.66 million people. This made it the fourth most watched show on Animation Domination that night, beating The Cleveland Show but losing to The Simpsons with 7.46 million.

Their award-winning work spans across the UK, USA and Mexico; empowering people aged 12‚Äì25 to overcome bullying. They are a digital charity, which means that most of the support provided is through their website and partnerships with games and social networks. History= Infancy = In 2005, after 10 years of ignoring it and telling the teachers, founder and current CEO of Ditch the Label Liam Hackett, took to the Internet to post about his experiences of being bullied. He talked about the extreme verbal and physical bullying he had experienced, including his hospitalisation after being attacked by a group of people from school. Overnight, hundreds of people came together, united by their experiences. A community rapidly grew and the movement became so large, that in 2006 Hackett launched a specific MySpace profile to host the conversations and named it ‚ÄòDitch the Label‚Äô. Hackett recognised the potential of Ditch the Label and approached the local Chamber of Commerce in 2007. Aged 16, he became the first person below the age of 18 to receive a grant in his local area to develop a Ditch the Label website. Ditch the Label continued to grow in momentum behind the scenes as Hackett studied for his degree at the University of Sussex. In 2012, he graduated with a degree in business and management and immediately registered Ditch the Label as a legal entity and began to develop the organisation. = Official registration (2014) = Income requirements had disqualified Ditch the Label from becoming a recognised charity. Gaining charity status was required in order to attract funding. In March 2014, Ditch the Label was officially registered as a charity in the UK. = Expansion to USA and Mexico (2015-2016) = In 2015, Ditch the Label announced plans to expand across the United States and Mexico, aiming to support 500,000 young bullying victims. 2016 also saw the launch of the fifth and most comprehensive Annual Bullying Survey in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. Research=The Cyberbullying Report (2013)= This reportCyberbullying Report combined a bullying-related data set of over 10,000 young people with key questions surrounding cyberbullying and the use of integrated digital technology within the lives of young people. Upon publication in October 2013, media publications were quick to respond; turning the findings of the report into global headlines. As a result, the report went on to consult Government, social networks, schools, colleges and other organisations in their counter cyberbullying strategy. =The Annual Bullying Survey (2013 - present)= Each year the organisation partners with schools and colleges across the UK, to conduct a survey which highlights the current climate of bullying amongst 13 - 18 year olds.

N. Balagangadhara, is a book published in 2012 about the problems that the postcolonial studies, India studies and Indology are facing today, and the possible new directions for rejuvenating them. The emergence of the postcolonial scholarship had ingested a new life in the quest of the 'third world countries' to produce knowledge about themselves. However, over the years, postcolonial scholarship has become obsolete and is in need of a rejuvenation and rethought. This book is a stronger voice in the recent attempts to do this. This book avers that the post-colonial studies about India is, perhaps, unknowingly, promoting \\"the same old colonial ideas it had set out to debunk, lacking an original framework to study India from the Indian perspective the current model borrows the Oriental/colonial framework, thereby constraining the social science studies in India. The author of the book, S.N. Balagangadhara, here \\"urges his fellow-intellectuals from India to stop ‚Äòmimicking‚Äô western descriptions of India and to provide descriptions of themselves and their society against the background of their own culture. Although his book is addressed to Indian intellectuals, it ... reminds [the western social scientists and philosophers] ... that the social sciences as these have developed until now, cannot lay a claim to the predicate ‚Äòscience‚Äô if and in so far their research-objects cannot escape from the scope of secularized Christian discourse.\\" Reviews and Discussion According to Prakash Shah of Department of Law, Queen Mary, University of London, this book is written in a very accessible way. However, one should not read this book before reading the authors' first major work, The Heathen in his Blindness... (1994). For, one will not understand the gravity of claims that this book makes. GLOCUL, Centre for Culture and Law, School of Law, Queen Mary, University of London Elsewhere, Shah writes, \\"the diatribes directed towards Indian culture are based on the ‚Äòfact‚Äô that they manifest Brahmanism and that it is Brahmin upper castes and their followers who perpetuate the backwardness of India. Such stories are retold by many Indian intellectuals also because they suffer from what S.N. Balagangadhara refers to as ‚Äòcolonial consciousness‚Äô.\\"http://aryalegal.wordpress.com/2013/04/09/caste- discrimination-reflection-needed-not-legislation/ His co-author and former student, Jakob De Roover, notes that \\"if it weren't for political correctness, most social scientists would today explicitly agree with the old colonial assessment of Indians as immoral and superstitious. ... [The] scientific study of Indian culture ... [has] ended up reproducing descriptions of India that transform it into an inferior and backward culture.\\" This book, De Roover says, \\"raises the question how this could happen?\\" The book comes as a wake-up call. If we keep travelling along the same route,\\"we shall continue to view other cultures as erring variants of the West. This is problematic not because all cultures are equal, but because this framework prevents us from learning from alternative forms of life.\\"http://www.flw.ugent.be/agenda/220 According to Harry van den Bouwhuijsen, \\"In Reconceptualizing India Studies, apart from briefly examining the possibility and preconditions for a Comparative Science of Cultures, hemainly urges his Indian fellow-intellectuals to provide the descriptions which are a conditio sine qua non for such a science to get off the ground.\\" A writer of nationalist Flemish publications, Koenraad Elst, points out that in the \\"Reconceptualizing India Studies..., the attentive reader will see a critique of the Indological establishment in the West and the political and cultural establishment in India. ... [This work] questions their legitimacy. The reigning Indologists and India-watchers would do well to read it.\\" As a reviewer pointed out, this \\"book is not written as the fruit of the genius of one important intellectual but rather as an invitation to think, to be part of a research programme, a project of enriching our life and culture. That this research programme is intended as a challenge to the current social scientific theories and practice is a way of saying that they (the current social sciences) are the major impediments in living a meaningful and dignified life as Indians.

It originally aired on CBS in the United States on January 8, 2013. The episode is written by Christopher J. Waild and directed by Dennis Smith, and was seen by 21.11 million viewers. The episode centers on the return of Ziva's father, Mossad Director Eli David, whom she has not seen in more than two years. Eli claims to be repentant for some of his past choices and that his motives are pure, though Ziva expresses doubt over his sincerity. Meanwhile, the team investigates the death of a man dressed in a petty officer's uniform whose body was found in a lake. \\"Shabbat Shalom\\" is part of a two-episode story arc, followed by \\"Shiva\\", in which two recurring characters (Eli David and Jackie Vance) were killed off in a single shootout. It also sets in motion a long- term storyline leading up to the NCIS season finale. \\"Shabbat Shalom\\" was the first NCIS episode of 2013 and was received with mostly positive reviews. Etymology Shabbat shalom (◊©÷∑◊Å◊ë÷∏÷º◊™ ◊©÷∏◊Å◊ú◊ï÷π◊ù), which literally means \\"a peaceful Sabbath\\" in Hebrew, is a common greeting used in Israel on the Jewish Sabbath.Jew Faq: \\"Judaism 101: Expressions and Greetings\\" Several characters in the episode ‚Äî Ziva and Eli David, Jackie and Leon Vance ‚Äî are shown observing the Shabbat shortly before the fatal shootout at the end. Background NCIS follows a team of government agents who work for the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. The main cast includes Mark Harmon as team leader Leroy Jethro Gibbs, Michael Weatherly as Senior Agent Anthony \\"Tony\\" DiNozzo, Cote de Pablo as Mossad Liaison Officer turned NCIS Agent Ziva David, Pauley Perrette as Forensic Specialist Abby Sciuto, Sean Murray as Special Agent Timothy McGee, David McCallum as Autopsy Technician Donald \\"Ducky\\" Mallard, Rocky Carroll as NCIS Director Leon Vance, and Brian Dietzen as Medical Assistant Jimmy Palmer. In previous years, Ziva's relationship with her father, Eli David, was scripted as complex; this is heightened during the seventh season when he orders her to continue on a hazardous assignment even after the risks made it a suicide mission. Cote de Pablo has opined, \\"These characters are able to justify [their actions] because they come from a country that's at war. You learn to sympathize with her dad, who's played so beautifully by Michael Nouri.\\" Despite this, she considered her character's subsequent actions ‚Äî cutting all ties with Eli ‚Äî warranted. Ziva later manages to partly reconcile with Eli, her only surviving relative, in the eighth season, though he remains estranged. Plot In the opening scene, a father and son discover a man in a petty officer's uniform dead in a lake while fishing. Back at the NCIS squad room, Tony, McGee, and Ziva are sifting through a box of old undercover gear that is being thrown out to make more room for supplies. They reminisce about past cases, including one involving Ziva having to wear a prosthetic pregnant belly. The team is called to the scene at the lake and quickly learns that the victim is not Navy personnel. Rather, he is a \\"government paparazzo\\" named Tyler Wilkes, a disgraced reporter who had lost credibility after distributing digitally altered photographs in the previous year. It is also found that, at the time of his death, Wilkes had been undercover working a story on alleged drug use in the Navy. The team narrows down four suspects who all confess to the murder, evidently believing that doing so will confuse the investigators and, in turn, clear them. Instead, Gibbs arrests each of them and puts them in separate holding cells. Ducky, on examining the body, realizes that the death was most likely an accident as the deceased had mono and died from internal bleeding due to a split in his liver. However, the perpetrator still attempted to hide the killing. At the end of the day, Ziva leaves to find her father Eli is waiting for her at her car in the parking lot. He insists that he is in town to make amends with his daughter and that his intentions are honorable. Despite being suspicious, she cautiously accepts his efforts, though also informs Gibbs immediately, who tells Vance. The latter notes that Eli may be nearing retirement but fears that the presence of Iranian ambassador Arash Kazmi, with whom he had a possibly volatile history, will complicate the situation. Ziva and Eli begin to repair their relationship, spending time together at a coffee shop and looking through photographs. Eli expresses particular interest in a picture of a \\"pregnant\\" Ziva, which had accidentally been mixed into the photo stack, asking if it was a boy or a girl. She at first deflects, reminding him that she was only undercover, but quickly admits that she would tell people that the baby was a girl when asked. Eli proceeds to discuss the possibility of retiring in the near future and asks that his visit \\"be the first step to [his] redemption.\\" Gibbs and Vance's fears of trouble with Kazmi and Eli are abated when they learn that the two are in fact negotiating a peace agreement. They arrange a meeting to explain that Kazmi and Eli had lived on opposite sides of the same stretch of the Green Line between Israel and Palestine, and that he and Eli had grown up knowing each other through the olive harvest. They request Vance's help with proceeding, who arranges for Eli and Ziva to come to his house for dinner. Soon after, Ziva discovers that her father had accidentally killed Wilkes when the latter took pictures of him arriving at the airport. Eli had struggled with the reporter over the camera, causing his enlarged liver to burst. She confronts Eli shortly afterwards, who admits that he had covered Wilkes' death to prevent word from getting out that he was in Washington D.C., which would ruin the peace arrangements. Ziva is nonetheless furious and disheartened by this, but agrees to sit across from her father at the dinner table one last time. Vance's wife Jackie prepares a Shabbat meal, and Eli tries to lighten the tension by saying the blessing and expressing thanks for \\"life, freedom, and family\\". However, Ziva is unable to continue and goes outside to call Gibbs. Then, an unknown assailant shoots up Vance's house. Ziva pursues the shooter, wounding him, and is joined by Gibbs, who rushes to the scene after hearing the gunshots. The shooter is cornered but commits suicide before he can talk. Tony and McGee hurry to the site of the shootout and tend to the victims. However, Ziva returns to the house to find that Eli has been killed and breaks down sobbing, cradling his head and praying in Hebrew. Jackie is critically wounded and rushed to the hospital. After several hours in surgery, Vance emerges from the operating room and quietly states that his wife is dead which has Gibbs devastated. Production=Writing= Michael Nouri guest starred as Ziva's father Eli David, who was killed in the episode. \\"Shabbat Shalom\\" is written by Christopher J. Waild and directed by Dennis Smith. Executive producer Gary Glasberg began to consider possibly killing off Ziva's father and Vance's wife in the spring of 2012 and discussed the idea with Vance's portrayer, Rocky Carroll. Glasberg and Carroll agreed that the storyline would provide a more in-depth storyline for Vance, whose family life had always been relatively stable. Glasberg also approached Cote de Pablo, who plays Ziva, and discussed Eli's role in the series and how killing Ziva's last remaining family member would affect her character and personality. Both Paula Newsome and Michael Nouri, who portray Jackie Vance and Eli David respectively, were dismayed by the direction that the producers chose to take but decided to go forward with it and \\"give it everything they could\\". The episode largely focuses on the relationship between Ziva and Eli and the latter's attempts to repent for his past wrongs, though Waild ultimately decided to kill off Eli without allowing them to reconcile. He explained: Waild added that with the death of Jackie Vance \\"the tragedy of Ziva and Eli now also extends into the Vance family. Fitting, I think, given Eli and Vance were 'forged in blood.'\\" The killings continue the season's theme of fallen heroes. When questioned about the choice to kill off two characters in the same episode, particularly one that was not a finale or set during sweeps Glasberg responded, \\"I don't necessarily see that as ruthless. I have no problems coming up with stuff that keeps audiences on their toes.\\" He concluded that he was very pleased with the final product. =Promotion= Minor details of the January plots were released a few months in advance. Glasberg first announced in October that there would be a \\"huge Ziva story\\" that would \\"rock Vance's world\\" following the Christmas break. Eli David's scheduled return was reported, and Cote de Pablo assured that, despite her character's tumultuous relationship with Michael Nouri's, the reunion would not be intentionally destructive on his part. \\"He comes to make peace with his daughter...but then drama unfolds,\\" she relayed. Glasberg agreed, saying that the audience would most likely be surprised by the way they interacted in the episode. De Pablo further commented, \\"It's an interesting thing to explore ‚Äì and something we have never seen my character go through.\\" However, despite focusing on Ziva and Vance, all of the characters would feel the repercussions of what would happen, and the events would be the start of a long-term story arc that would carry through the rest of the season. \\"I think it all sticks to the idea of knocking people down and picking them back up again, emotionally and psychologically,\\" said Glasberg. Reception=Ratings= \\"Shabbat Shalom\\" was seen by 21.11 million live viewers following its broadcast on January 8, 2013, with a 3.5/10 share among adults aged 18 to 49. A rating point represents one percent of the total number of television sets in American households, and a share means the percentage of television sets in use tuned to the program. In total viewers, \\"Shabbat Shalom\\" easily won NCIS and CBS the night. The spin-off NCIS: Los Angeles drew second and was seen by 17.90 million viewers. Compared to the last episode \\"You Better Watch Out\\", \\"Shabbat Shalom\\" was up in both viewers and adults 18‚Äì49. It was also the season high in viewers when it aired, though it was surpassed by the following episode, \\"Shiva\\".Ratings: NCIS Hits a Season High, Parenthood Again Tops Time Slot But NBC Sitcoms Plunge. January 9, 2013. =Critical reviews= Immediate reception was overwhelmingly positive. Douglas Wolfe from TV Fanatic gave the episode 5 (out of 5) and stated that \\"This story was amazing and filled with sadness. I cannot imagine a more compelling episode. The writing, the dialogue, the incredible performances all combined to a bring heartbreaking masterpiece to the small screen. I can't wait to see the second part of this story.\\" Steve Marsi, also from TV Fanatic, called the episode \\"powerful and unexpected\\" and said in a round table, \\"Ziva screaming 'Abba' and bawling was enough to give anyone the chills, as was Gibbs standing stone-faced and ignoring the SecNav's calls. These scenes are enhanced by the fact that we're so invested in these characters after 10 seasons...Superb TV entertainment, but also emblematic of the uncertain times we live in.\\" Eric Hochberger added, \\"Sometimes, I wish they wouldn't do this. Jackie in particular felt unnecessary to kill off. However, as Steve said, there's no denying the collective brilliance of the cast and writers last night and in similar episodes. So, I guess we have to trust them and see where they take this next week and beyond.\\" Bradley Adams of SpoilerTV.com wrote, \\"The final few minutes were incredibly emotional. Ziva's reaction to seeing her father's lifeless body was heartbreaking. Her shout of 'ABBA!' was enough to cause a robot to cry. We could all predict that Eli was going to die, but the way he was killed was unpredictable. At first thought, Jackie Vance's death seemed unnecessary. However, the anger and sadness shown by the Director when informing Gibbs 'My wife is dead', alongside Ziva's grief, was almost overwhelming. It left us with a brilliant cliffhanger. Reviewers also praised the performances of Cote de Pablo and Rocky Carroll in the aftermath of Jackie Vance and Eli David's deaths, and Wolfe opined that the best scenes of the episode were a \\"three-way toss up: Ziva's agony over the death of her father was heartbreaking. The scene with Tony and Gibbs standing sentinel at the hospital waiting room was, I think, the best scene cinematically. So stark, and filled with such tension. I rewound it and watched it again. And finally, the dead look in Vance's eyes as he answer's Gibbs' question. 'She's dead. My wife is dead, Gibbs.'\\" Hochberger said, \\"Rocky and Cote were both amazing. The latter deserves Emmy consideration for this effort I'd say.\\" Sandra Gonzalez from Entertainment Weekly wrote \\"Cote de Pablo was absolutely fantastic in this scene ‚Äî the crying, the praying in Hebrew. If you weren‚Äôt crying right along with her, you‚Äôre stronger than I am.\\" Later, TVLine named Cote de Pablo Performer of the Week, noting that \\"As Ziva set her own eyes upon Eli's lifeless body, de Pablo's expression instantly morphed from professional resolve into horror, as she cradled his head in her arms, the weeping visage of a little girl who'd lost her Abba. There was no holding back for de Pablo as the actress let her alter ego's emotions, and tears, flow, whispering a Hebrew prayer into her late father's ear.\\" Michelle Calbert from BuddyTV included \\"Shabbat Shalom\\" in her list of \\"The 10 Best Ziva Episodes\\" and wrote, \\"Ziva screaming for her father is one of the most heartbreaking and chilling moments we've seen from her in the entire series.\\" A few weeks after the episode aired, Latina published a list of \\"Cote de Pablo's 15 Best 'NCIS' Moments\\" and included the scene of Ziva's reaction to her father's death, going on to describe de Pablo's performance as \\"Emmy-worthy\\" and \\"Shabbat Shalom\\" as \\"one of the show's most heartbreaking episodes.\\" References Category:2013 American television episodes Category:NCIS (season 10) episodes ","title":"Shabbat Shalom (NCIS)"},{"id":"38178224","text":"Lazhar may refer to: *Monsieur Lazhar and the titular character, Bachir Lazhar *Lazhar Hadj A√Øssa (born 1984), Algerian footballer *Lazhar Bououni (1948‚Äì2017), Tunisian politician *Lazhar Karoui Chebbi (born 1927) *Lazhar Ben Mohamed Tlil ","title":"Lazhar"},{"id":"38178235","text":"Muhammad Askari Mirza, sometimes known simply as Askari (1516 ‚Äì 1557/1558DELHI (Mughal Empire) http://members.iinet.net.au/~royalty/ips/families/mughal.html ) was a son of Babur Mirza, the founder of the Mughal dynasty and Gulrukh Begum.

He was also the older brother of Gulbadan Begum (the author of Humayun-nama), the younger half-brother of the second Mughal emperor Humayun, as well as the paternal uncle and father-in-law of the third Mughal emperor Akbar. Hindal's long military career started at the age of ten, with his first appointment as a viceroy being in Badakshan, Afghanistan. The young prince subsequently proved himself to be a successful and courageous general.Gulbadan, p. 142 Thus, by the age of 19, Hindal was considered to be a strong and favourable contender for the Mughal throne as Humayun's successor by the imperial council, which despised his older brother. However, unlike his rebellious half-brother, Kamran Mirza, Hindal eventually pledged allegiance to Humayun and remained faithful to him till his untimely death in 1551, when he died fighting for the Mughals in a battle against Kamran Mirza's forces. He was survived by his wife and his only daughter, the princess Ruqaiya Sultan Begum, who married his nephew, Akbar, and became Mughal empress in 1556. Early life Abu'l-Nasir Muhammad was born on 4 March 1519 in Kabul to the first Mughal emperor Babur and his wife Dildar Begum. Upon hearing the news of his birth, Babur named his youngest son, Hindal (Turkish: \\"Taker of India\\"), since the prince was born while he was on his way to conquer \\"Hind\\" (India) which he felt was a good omen. Babur further commemorated the birth of his son in his memoir: the Baburnama. Two years after his birth, the prince and his sister, Gulbadan Begum, were placed in Maham Begum's care; Babur's chief wife and the mother of Hindal's older half-brother, Humayun. Maham Begum had recently lost four children of her own in infancy, and wished to raise Hindal and his sister Gulbadan Begum in her own care. Hindal's other siblings included his two sisters Gulrang Begum and Gulchehra Begum and a younger brother, Alwar Mirza, who died in his childhood. Among his siblings, Hindal was very close to his sister Gulbadan Begum. Hindal's father, Emperor Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire Hindal had also been his father's favourite when Humayun lost favour with him at the time of his death in 1530. On his deathbed in Agra, Babur desperately asked for his youngest son, Hindal (who was fighting a campaign in Kabul at the time), instead of Humayun. This incident, hinted at the depth of the older prince's imperial disfavour. =Marriage and private life= In 1537, Hindal married his cousin, Sultanam Begum, in Agra. She was the daughter of Muhammad Musa Khwaja and the younger sister of Mahdi Khwaja, who was Babur's brother-in-law, being the husband of his sister, Khanzada Begum. Sultanam had been lovingly brought up by Hindal's childless aunt, Khanzada Begum, since she was a child and had been reared to become Hindal's wife in future.Gulbadan, p. 38 In honour of their marriage, Khanzada Begum organized a grand feast, which is described in great detail in the Humayun-nama. The feast, known as the 'Mystic Feast' was a grand affair and in the words of Gulbadan Begum was \\"most splendid and entertaining\\", being attended by innumerable imperial and royal guests as well as high-ranking court amirs. Gulbadan further stated that such a wedding feast had not been organized previously for any other children of Babur. Mahdi Khwaja had presented his brother-in-law, Hindal, with a large amount of dowry and Khanzada Begum also gave extravagant gifts.Gulbadan, p. 126 In 1541, when negotiations for Humayun's marriage with Hamida Banu Begum were going on, both Hindal and Hamida bitterly opposed the marriage proposal, possibly because they were involved with each other.Eraly, p. 65 It seems probable that Hamida was in love with Hindal, though there is only circumstantial evidence for it.Eraly, p. 526 In her book, the Humayun-nama, Hindal's sister and Hamida's close friend, Gulbadan Begum, pointed out that Hamida was frequently seen in her brother's palace during those days, and even in the palace of their mother, Dildar Begum. Hamida's father, Shaikh Ali Akbar Jami, had also been one of Hindal's preceptors. Vice-royalty Hindal's first appointment as a viceroy was in Badakshan, Afghanistan, when the prince was merely ten years old. Hindal's older half-brothers Humayun and Kamran Mirza conferred and persuaded the young prince to take up the government of Badakshan. Upon invading India in 1525‚Äì6, Hindal was briefly awarded Badakshan again in 1529 by Babur. At the time of his father's death in 1530, the eleven-year-old Hindal was serving as the viceroy of Kabul, and was also the viceroy of Qandahar at a later time. Upon Humayun's accession to the throne in the same year, Hindal was granted Babur's favourite retreat of Alwar, in addition to the governorship of Malwa. Further, Humayun granted the province of Ghazni and Mewat (among others) as Hindal's jagir, while Kamran was granted Qandahar. Hindal, however, attempted to withdraw into seclusion in Badakshan, seemingly in repudiation of Kamran Mirza's rebellion. When the Mughals conquered India again in 1541, one third portion of it was owned by Hindal. Siege of Kannauj In 1537, Sher Shah Suri had gradually overrun all the countries on the southern or Behar side of the Ganges; and Muhammad Sultan Mirza, had raised the standard of revolt in the upper provinces. The long absence of the Emperor Humayun had latterly encouraged them to act with greater boldness and security. Muhammad Sultan, having gained possession of a great portion of the countries on the left bank of the Ganges, had fixed the seat of his government at Bilgram, opposite to Kannauj, and had gained sufficient strength to send his son, Ulugh Mirza, with a large force to besiege Juanpur; while Shah Mirza, another of his sons, reduced Kara-Manikpur. Kannauj too had fallen into his hands.Erskine, p. 89 Hindal Mirza, whom Humayun had left in command at Agra, marched to quell this revolt, and soon retook Kannauj. As soon as Muhammad Sultan Mirza heard of his approach, he called in all his detachments, and was joined by Shah Mirza, while Ulugh Mirza wrote to say, that he would hasten with all possible speed to meet him; at the same time urging him not to hazard a battle till his arrival. Muhammad Sultan and Shah Mirza, encamping on the left bank of the river, used every exertion to obstruct the passage of the imperial army. Hindal, however, eager to engage the enemy before Ulugh Mirza could join them, having discovered a fort ten miles above Kannauj, left his camp standing, and effected a passage, unobserved, with all his troops.Erskine, p. 89 The two armies soon met face-to-face; but when they were on the point of engaging, a strong north-wester rising, blew such clouds of dust right in the eyes of the insurgents that they could not keep their position. The imperial army, who had the wind on their backs, availing themselves of their advantage, pressed hard upon their enemy, whose retreat was soon converted into a flight. Hindal, after taking possession of Belgram and the surrounding country, pursued the remainder of their army, as they marched to form a junction with Ulugh Mirza. He overtook them at Oudh where Muhammad Sultan and his sons, having concentrated all their forces, halted to check his advance. The two armies lay opposite to each other for nearly two months, when news arrived that Humayun had left Mandu, and was on his way back to Agra. This decided Muhammad Sultan to bring on an action, as his only chance of safety. He marched out of his trenches; and engagement ensued, in which the imperial troops had the advantage. The insurgents, dispirited by their continued want of success, began to despair, and soon after dispersed. Muhammad Sultan Mirza, and three of his sons, fled to Kuch-Behar; while Hindal Mirza, following up on his advantage went on to Juanpur. Having soon after heard of Humayun's arrival at the capital, he left the army and joined his brother there.Erskine, p. 90 Revolt at Agra and proclamation as Emperor Hindal's older brother, the Emperor Humayun In 1538, Humayun received reports from Agra that his younger half-brother, Hindal, had put to death Sheikh Bhul, soon after his arrival, had thrown of his allegiance, had assumed all the ensigns of sovereignty; and caused himself to be proclaimed Emperor.Erskine, p. 151 At first, the Emperor did not believe the news and found it unfounded and impossible, but he soon found out that it was no time to linger on. Humayun entered Bengal and proceeded to Gour, Hindal Mirza, instead of remaining to keep the rebels in check, and maintain the communications with grand army, taking advantage of the season, abandoned his post and set out for Agra, without leave. His absence, and the death of Hindu Beg, had encouraged and enabled Sher Shah Suri to pass the Ganges and take Benaras, defeat Yusuf Beg, and lay siege to Juanpur; besides cutting off all the communications of Humayun's army.Erskine, p. 159 Hindal, who was now twenty years old, misled by the counselors who so often surround an aspiring prince, and incite him to sacrifice every duty for his own ambitions, on his arrival to Agra, entered the city, took possession of the Emperor's palace, issued his orders as if vested with absolute power, and seemed to direct his views to the throne itself. =Siege of Juanpur= Alarmed at the course which Hindal was pursuing, Humayun hastened down to Agra to meet the prince and represented to him in the strongest terms the danger to which he was exposing the power and the very existence of the Chughtai race in India. He pointed out that it was a moment when, instead of destroying everything by discord and disunion, it was essential that every friend of the House of Timur, should exert himself, to break the rapidly increasing power of Sher Khan and the Pashtuns. By such remonstrances, he prevailed upon Hindal to leave the city to cross over the Jamna into the Doab, and there collect whatever forces could be brought together, to march and raise the siege of Juanpur.Erskine, p. 160 The Emperor's cousin and brother-in-law, Yadgir Nasir Mirza, who commanded Kalpi, was induced by Mir Fakhir Ali to put his troops in motion so as to form a junction with those of Hindal in the territory of Karra, so that they might thence proceed in concert to Juanpur. =Possibility of accession= At this time, Zahid Beg, Khusrau Beg Kokiltash, Haji Muhammad Baba Khushke, and other discontented and turbulent nobles, who had fled from Bengal, arrived, and had secret communications with Nur-ud-din Muhammad Mirza, the governor of Kanauj, who had married Gulrang Begum, Hindal's sister, and who seems to have been privy to his designs.Erskine, p. 161 Nur-ud-din wrote to Hindal Mirza, announcing the arrival of these noblemen, and at the same time forwarded to him a petition from them, asking his favour and protection, and proffering their own duties and services. To this address the Mirza, who, in spite of his change of conduct, had still a strong leaning to his treasonable purposes, returned a gracious answer, which he gave to Muhammad Ghazi Taghai, one of his trusty adherents, by whom he at the same time wrote to inform Yadgar Nasir Mirza, and Mir Fakhir Ali, of the arrival of the Amirs. Sher Shah Suri, the usurper to the rule of Emperor Humayun The Amirs did not wait at Kanauj for his answer, but proceeded to Kol, a jagir of Zahid Beg's. Hindal's envoy, hearing of this movement, instead of first going to Yadgar, went straight to meet them. The conspirators, finding that Hindal was irresolute or insincere, and being themselves desperate, told the envoy, explicitly, that their mind was made up; that they had forever shaken off their allegiance to the Emperor; that, if Hindal would assume the imperial dignity, and read the khutba in his own name, they were to be his most faithful subjects. But if not, that they would straightway repair to Kamran Mirza, and make him the same offer, which would not be refused. The envoy, returning to Hindal, reported what had passed, and added in his own opinion; that the Mirza was so far committed as to have only one of two measures to adopt. He must either at once call in the Amirs, accede to their advice, and declare himself Emperor; or get them into his power, cast them into prison, and treat them as rebels. Hindal, whose mind was misled by high and dazzling projects, was not long of coming to a decision on this alternative. He agreed to accept to the proposal of the fugitive nobles and to raise the standard of rebellion.Erskine, p. 162 It was at this very juncture that Sheikh Bhul or Behlul, who had been sent by Humayun from Gour, on a mission to the Mirza, arrived near Agra. Sheikh Bhul was revered by Humayun, as his religious teacher and spiritual guide, and had acted as a councillor to Hindal himself. Hindal, on hearing of his approach, went out and received him with much honour. Bhul had been sent from Bengal by the Emperor, when he had first heard of the Mirza's defection, to reason with him on the folly of his proceedings. Bhul brought assurances from Humayun, not only of forgiveness for his past misconduct, but of every favour and exaltation for the future, that the affection and generosity of a prince and brother could bestow. The weak and wavering mind of Hindal was shaken by these remonstrances of duty and wisdom. He had not yet made any irrevocable manifestation of his rebellious intentions, and was once more persuaded to return to his allegiance, and to join in an active effort to drive the common enemy out of the field, free his sovereign from distress and peril. The very next day, he sent to make fresh requisitions from Muhammad Bakshi, the governor, of such a quantity of warlike stores and equipments, arms, cattle, money etc. as would enable him to put his army instantly in motion and to proceed to the relief of Juanpur.Erskine, p. 163 =Siege of Delhi= Unfortunately Nur-ud-din arrived while these measures were being expedited and he was able to destroy the whole effect of Sheikh Bhul's mission, and Hindal was persuaded once more to accept the support of the rebel nobles, for which they demanded the sacrifice of Sheikh Bhul as he had caused Hindal to break his former promises to them.Wheeler, 1953, p. 32 They hoped that Hindal, involved in such a disgraceful crime, would irretrievably be separated from Humayun, whom they hated and despised. A frivolous charge of conspiracy with Sher Khan was laid and the Sheikh was executed under the orders of Nur-ud-din. Such a crime revolted the ladies of the harem and all the officers who had remained faithful to Humayun. It marked the destruction of Hindal's ambitious designs, for when he advanced on Delhi instead of marching to assist the Emperor, Yadgar Nasir and Fakhir Ali forestalled him by hasty marches and reached the city before he arrived. While Hindal was unsuccessfully besieging Delhi, his step-brother, Kamran Mirza, arrived from Punjab. After successfully capturing Kandahar, Kamran completed his domination over all of Afghanistan and Punjab. Now, in 1539, he moved towards Humayun's territory and Hindal, uncertain of his intentions, abandoned the siege of Delhi and withdrew to Agra. Although Kamran was persuaded to leave Delhi untouched and to follow Hindal to Agra, his intentions were completely selfish. On Kamran's approach, Hindal withdrew to his own government at Alwar, but soon was persuaded to offer his submission, together with the rebel officers who were almost his sole adherents. The brothers set out as if to help march to Humayun's help, but the ambition of Kamran and the weakness of Hindal made them yield to the suggestion of nobles that if Sher Khan defeated Humayun, the Empire would fall to his brother and that if the Emperor won he could be persuaded to forgive them. So after a few marches they turned back to Agra just as Humayun's affairs reached a crisis.Wheeler, 1953, p. 33 Siege of Sehwan In the summer of 1541, Hindal had repeatedly asked for the Emperor's permission to attack and occupy the rich province of Sehwan in Sindh, but was not allowed, due to an ongoing negotiation between the Emperor and Shah Hussein regarding some procurement of resources. However, as soon as the negotiations were made, Hindal was at length authorized to reduce the district, and informed that the Emperor himself would soon visit the prince's camp. Shah Hussein had fortified the town of Sehwan, and now ordered the surrounding country to be laid waste. Humayun, alarmed by some intimations that had reached to him, of Hindal's having a design to desert from him and march to Qandahar, quitted for a short time the gardens of Baberlu and proceeded to Hindal's camp. Five days later, he reached Pater, which lies about twenty miles west of Indus and was met by Hindal.Erksine, p. 219 Here, negotiations for Humayun's marriage with Hamida Banu Begum began, and Hindal was so furious at the prospect of his brother's marriage with Hamida that he subsequently threatened to quit the Emperor's service. Hindal was much offended by his brother's conduct as he felt that Humayun had come to Pater to \\"do him honour and not to look out for a young bride\\". Hindal's mother, Dildar Begum, who overheard this altercation, interposed, reproved her son and attempted to settle the dispute. But, as Hindal refused to apologize for the unseemly language he had used, Humayun left the house in high displeasure. Hindal, on the other hand, soon left for Afghanistan just as the Emperor's men began to increasingly desert him.Erksine, p. 220 Death Nangarhar province location in present-day Afghanistan. The place where Hindal Mirza died. On the eve of 20 November 1551, Hindal and Humayun had set camp in the province of Nangarhar, Afghanistan, the brothers learned that Kamran Mirza was intending to attack the imperial camp that night with a body of Khalil and Pashtun soldiers. Despite various security measures, about the end of the first watch of the night, an attack was made accordingly. The Emperor was on the rising ground; Hindal in the camp below.Erksine, p. 402 The onset of the attack was furious and continued hot for some time, each offer defending his own portions of work, some part of which, however, the enemy succeeded in scaling, and entered the enclosure. Some men of note were slain; all was confusion and uncertainty, friend and foes being mixed together and covered by the darkness of the night, but soon the imperialists recovered their superiority. Inside the Gardens of Babur, located in Kabul, Afghanistan The assailants took to flight, but Hindal had fallen in the fray. \\"When the affair was over\\" says Jouher, \\"and his Majesty (Humayun) inquired for his brother Hindal, no one had the courage to tell him.\\" Humayun then called out aloud from the height; but, although surrounded by three hundred persons, none answered. The Emperor ordered Abdal Wahab to go and bring news of the prince. Wahab went in search of the prince, but was shot by one of the imperial army's own match-lock men, who mistook him for an Afghan. Mir Abdal Hai was next sent, and brought back the melancholy intelligence, which he communicated by two verses of a poet. The Emperor instantly retreated to his pavilion, where he was overwhelmed with grief, till his Amirs came and consoled him, saying that his brother was blessed, in having thus fallen a martyr in the service of the Emperor.Erksine, p. 403 It appears that Hindal, on hearing the news of the intended night-attack, had carefully visited all his trenches, after which he retired to his tent for some rest, when he was roused by the uproar and alarm occasioned by the onset of the Pashtuns. They had attacked the works on every side on foot, and a body had succeeded in getting over the prince's trenches in the dark night. Hindal started up, and hastened to meet and repel the assailants, having only his bow and arrow in hand. His men had hurried away in confusion, to protect their horses from being plundered, therefore none of Hindal's immediate servants were with him. He soon met a Pashtun face to face, and so near that it was necessary to get close with him. By main strength he had gained the upper hand, when his enemy's brother, Tirenda, a Mehmend Pashtun, came to his assistance, and slew the prince without knowing him. When the battle was over, the Pashtuns brought Hindal's ornamented quiver and arrows, unknowing to him it belonged, and presented them to his brother, Kamran, as the spoils of a man of rank. Kamran no sooner saw the quiver, than he recognized it as his brother's, and dashed his turban on the ground in an agony of grief. Hindal's body was left for some time unnoticed, where it fell. After the first confusion, when the troops began to collect, and were returning to assail the Pashtuns, Khwaja Ibrahim, one of Hindal's servants when passing the prince's tent, saw, in the darkness of the night, a man in black armour lying on the ground. He did not stop at first, but pushed on towards the Pashtuns, till he recollected that Hindal had that evening put on a black cuirass. Turning back, he examined the body, and found that it was the prince's. His right hand had been cut off, and some fingers on his left, apparently in his attempt to defend his head; and a cross blow, that had fallen on his mouth, had nearly separated the head from the one ear to the other.Erksine, p. 404 With great presence of mind, Ibrahim carried the body to the prince's pavilion, where he laid it down and covered it with a cloak, ordering the porters to admit no one as the prince was fatigued with his exertions, and had received a trifling wound; and desired that no noise or bustle should be allowed, that could disturb him. When the enemy was finally repulsed, Ibrahim, mounted a rising ground, and in the prince's name returned thanks to the troops for their exertions which had secured the victory of the Mughals. His conduct was warmly applauded by the Emperor. Hindal's death bears testimony to the young prince's courage and pluck. Hindal's remains were conveyed first to Jui-Shahi and after a time, to the Gardens of Babur in Kabul, where they were interred at the feet of his father, Emperor Babur. He was thirty-two years of age at the time of his death. Ghazni, which was one of Hindal's jagir, was given to his nephew, Akbar, to whom were also transferred Hindal's army, adherents and wealth and his daughter, Ruqaiya Sultan Begum, was betrothed to Akbar.

By presenting himself as a contrast to Akbar, he became a focus of anti-Akbar rebels who requested him to invade and dethrone Akbar in 1566 and 1581. His invasion however met with little success as only a few north Indians supported him. Hakim made a plea to Akbar's Central Asian officers to not help him occupy Kabul and instead attack the Indians in the Mughal army. His efforts however failed and Kabul was occupied. Hakim was defeated in 1582 and his prime minister Khwaja Hasan Naqshbandi was exiled by Akbar. After his death in 1585 due to alcohol poisoning, Akbar had his sons expelled to India and ended his princely appanage.

It was heard in the Cape Provincial Division by Corbett J on March 15, 1965, with judgment handed down on April 7. The attorneys of the excipient (or second defendant), who was represented in court by DL Kooy, SC (with him DO Delahunt), were Reilly, Reilly & Tucker. The respondent's attorneys were Sonnenberg, Hoffman & Galombik, and he was represented by S. Aaron. The case involved an exception to a declaration, and turned on the question of the meaning and effect of section 11(1) of the Motor Vehicle Insurance Act,Act 29 of 1942. in particular the meaning of the word \\"Driving\\" (regard being had to section 1(3). The court determined that, when the driver of a car opens its door after parking it, he has not perpetrated an act \\"caused by nor arising out of\\" the driving of the car.  Facts  After the third defendant had manoeuvred his car into a parking bay, switched off his engine and applied the hand-brake, he had reached behind him to remove an article from the back seat, and then opened the door preparatory to alighting. At this moment, a trackless tram struck the door, which protruded into its path, causing it to crash into another motorcar, and thus to injure the plaintiff and his wife. To a summons and declaration claiming damages from the insurer of the tram, the insurer of third defendant's car (the second defendant) and the third defendant, the second defendant had excepted on the ground that the plaintiffs' injuries had neither been \\"caused by\\" nor \\"arisen out of\\" the third defendant's driving of the car within the meaning of section 11 (1) of the Motor Vehicle Insurance Act.  Judgment  In order to give a wider application than the phrase \\"caused by\\" to the phrase \\"arising out of\\" (and thereby to prevent it from becoming redundant), Corbett J held that it must be regarded, as it appeared in section 11 (1) of the Act, as covering cases where the driving is an indirect cause of the infliction of the injury. Where the direct cause is some antecedent or ancillary act, then it could not normally be said that the death or injury was \\"caused by\\" the driving, but it might be found to \\"arise out of\\" the driving. Whether this would be found would depend upon the particular facts of the case and whether, \\"applying ordinary, common-sense standards,\\"870E. it could be said that the causal connection between the death or injury and the driving was sufficiently real and close to enable the court to say that the death or injury did in fact arise out of the driving. The word \\"driving,\\" as used in relation to the insured motor vehicle, means \\"ordinarily [...] the urging on, directing the course and general control of the vehicle while in motion and all other acts reasonably or necessarily incidental thereto.\\"870H. Corbett J held, as against the second defendant, that the plaintiffs' injuries had not been caused by, nor had they arisen out of, the driving of the insured vehicle; accordingly, the exception was upheld with costs.

Family background  Sarah Gildersleeve was born in Gildersleeve, Connecticut to Ferdinand and Harriet Northam Gildersleeve, the second of 4 children. Her family had been in Connecticut since the early 1600s and trace their origins in England for hundreds of years before that.Gildersleeve genealogy http://hausegenealogy.com/gildersleeve.html Her grandfather, Philip, fought with Colonel Josiah Smith during the American Revolution.

Provo, UT, US She married Robert Herndon Fife, Professor of Germanic Languages and Literature at Columbia University. They had no children. She died in Hartford, Connecticut.  Advocate for women bibliophiles  In 1944, Fife helped found the Hroswitha Club of women book collectors in New York City and served as its first president. The club was named for Hrotsvitha, a 10th-century German secular canoness, as well as a dramatist and poet who lived and worked in the Abbey of Gandersheim, in modern-day Lower Saxony. The club gave women a place to exchange information about books and collecting. Until creation of the Hroswitha, there were no institutions available to women bibliophiles in the New York area. For example, it would not be until 1976 that the Grolier Club accepted its first woman member.Abraham, Mildred. The Spirit of '76: The First Women of the Grolier Club. Gazette of the Grolier Club, Number 52, 2001 pp. 31-47. In 1948 the club founded its library and the following year, following Mrs. Fife's death, named it the Sarah Gildersleeve Fife Memorial Library. The Club held its 200th meeting in 1994 and continued until at least 1999. Many members eventually joined the Grolier Club.The Grolier Club, Archives, Letters  Garden Club of America  Sarah Fife was a local and national leader in American gardening. Her involvement with organized gardening began in the Connecticut town of Middleton where she became president of the garden club. As an affiliate of the Garden Club of America, she reported on their activities which included the establishment of a reference library. Her leadership in developing plantings around the public library was a harbinger of her later work, on a national level, to develop plantings around military hospitals.Report of the Garden Club of Middleton, Connecticut 1919-1920\\\\. Bulletin of the Garden Club of America. Dec 1920, No. VII (new series) pp 31-32 The Garden Club of America provides leadership as the national organization of regional gardening clubs promoting conservation, coordinating activities, sharing knowledge and skills and advocating beautification projects at all levels of community life in America. A notable member of the Club, she served on numerous committees, including the Bulletin, Flower Show, Horticultural and Library committee. It is perhaps for her work on the Committee for the Supervision of Redwood Grove that she made her most lasting impact. In 1931, the Committee raised $75,000 (equivalent to over $1,000,000 in 2010) towards the purchase of a 2,552 acre tract of old growth redwoods known as Canoe Creek Grove. This amount matched that donated by the California State Park Board Fund, making the purchase possible.Bulletin, Garden Club of America. May, 1931, page. 2 The Canoe Creek Grove became part of what is now Humboldt Redwoods State Park. In the late 1930s, Fife served alongside Mrs. Harriet Barnes Pratt as an officer of the Horticultural Society of New York during the period that the Horticultural Society was active in the preparations for the 1939 New York World's Fair. The Horticultural Society was a member of the non-profit corporation Hortus, the entity chosen for planning and administering the Gardens on Parade exhibit at the Fair.Bulletin of the Horticultural Society of New York, May 1939, page 2 As a result of her tireless and productive work, she was elected president and served from 1935 - 1938. She edited the Club‚Äôs periodical, The Bulletin, and during World War II was chairman of the Club's committee on planting gardens at army camps and hospitals. In recognition of her outstanding contributions to the activities of the Club and to American Gardening and Horticulture, the Sarah Gildersleeve Fife Award was created (see below).

Life and work Gourd is credited as being one of the most prominent figures in the 20th-century Swiss feminist movement. She first became involved in the movement in her mid-30s, but thereafter dedicated her life to the cause. She was particularly active in Geneva, where she was born, but also campaigned nationally for women's rights in Switzerland. The particular causes she campaigned for included women's education, equal pay, maternity benefits, disability benefits, and women's employment opportunities.

He was the maternal grandfather of Nadira Banu Begum, wife of Prince Dara Shikoh (eldest son of emperor Shah Jahan). Birth and education According to the Jahangirnama, he was a son of Akbar, born from a royal serving-girl just like his younger half-brother, Daniyal Mirza. Although some sources cite Akbar's wife, Salima Sultan Begum, as his mother.Vincent Arthur Smith, Akbar the Great Mogul, 1542-1605, 1917 Murad was first educated by Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak and, as from 1580, by Jesuit priests Antonio de Montserrat (as tutor) and Francisco Aquaviva, who were called up by Akbar himself to teach Murad Portuguese and the basics of Christianity. Murad became the first Mughal prince to be educated by western Jesuit priests or, as Dr. Oscar R. G√≥mez points out, the first person to be educated in the paradigmatic model driven by Murad's father Jalaluddin Muhammad Akbar, the 3rd Dalai Lama Sonam Gyatso, and Jesuit Antonio de Montserrat, which resulted in the current existentialist model. Hence, Sultan Murad Pahari has become the first person resulting from the amalgamation of Tibetan tantric Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity (Din-e-Ilahi). Military Command and Death In 1577 (at the age of seven), Murad was awarded his first military rank, receiving a mansab of 7000 men.Mansabdari system In 1584, after he attained puberty, this was enhanced to 9000 men.Dr. Ricard Von Garbe, Akbar, The Emperor Of India, 1909 From 1593 Prince Murad was in command of the army in the Deccan. He was ineffective in command largely due to his drunkenness. His condition led to his replacement by Abu'l-Fazl, who arrived at Murad's camp in early May. Shazada Sultan Murad Mirza died in Lahore Fort on 12 May 1599. Family One of Prince Murad's wives was Habiba Banu Begum, the daughter of Mirza Aziz Koka, Known as Khan Azam. He was the son of Akbar's foster mother, Jiji Anga. The marriage took place on 15 May 1587, when Murad was seventeen. She was the mother of Prince Rustam Mirza born on 27 August 1588 and died on 30 November 1597, and Prince Alam Sultan Mirza born on 4 November 1590 and died in infancy. Another of his wives was the daughter of Bahadur Khan, the son and successor of Rajah Ali Khan, ruler of Khandesh. Akbar arranged this marriage, in order to exact more help from Khandesh for the Mughals‚Äò future operations in the Deccan. His only daughter Princess Jahan Banu Begum was the wife of Prince Parviz Mirza, son of Emperor Jahangir.

It is a morphologically variable species with four recognised varieties. The species is used medicinally in Venezuela, and as an aphrodisiac in Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela. Description The species ranges in size from shrubs to trees, usually tall, but sometimes ranging up to tall. The leaves are usually simple in adult plants, but are occasionally compound. It is an ochlospecies‚Äîa species that is highly variable morphologically, and that variability \\"cannot be satisfactorily accommodated within a formal classification\\"‚Äîwith a very wide distribution. Consequently, a large number of species and varieties have been described based on variations between collections. Taxonomy The species was first described by Jean Baptiste Christophore Fus√©e Aublet in 1775. The name Roupala was based on roupale, a name used locally in French Guiana. The Latin specific epithet montana refers to mountains or coming from mountains.Archibald William Smith In their 2007 monograph, Ghillean Prance, Katie S. Edwards and coauthors recognised four named varieties within the species: R. montana var. montana (the \\"nominate\\" variety, based on Aublet's original description of the species), R. montana var. brasiliensis (Klotzsch) K.S.Edwards, R. montana var. impressiuscula (Mez) K.S.Edwards and R. montana var. paraensis (Sleumer) K.S.Edwards. Distribution Roupala montana ranges from Mexico in the north, through Central America, to Trinidad and Tobago, and across South America to southern Bolivia, Argentina, Paraguay and southern Brazil. Uses The species is used for fuel wood, high quality charcoal, medicinally and to a limited extent for woodworking and construction, The wood is commonly used for wood turning and sold in small spindles and blocks. Specialist exotic wood suppliers typically refer to this timber as Leopardwood but it can be confused with other species such Lacewood (Panopsis -P. rubescens and P. sessilifolia). The wood shows strong figuring in quartersawn sections. It turns well and gives a good finish. Quatersawn lacewood and leopardwood showing characteristic figuring It is one of several species including Parinari campestris and Richeria grandis which known by the common name bois band√©.

Plot  Sick of his baseball-obsessed father Frank's abuse, a boy beats him to death with a bat while practicing in 1981. Seventeen years later, catcher David J. Walker of The Devils is kicked out of a baseball game attended by scouts, and is blamed when The Devils lose. On the same day, David's girlfriend leaves, tired of him putting his love of baseball before her, and he is informed by Coach Foster that his contract is not being renewed. Elsewhere, in a stadium locker room, Tyrone Jackson of The Wombats, who had just scored a major contract, is bludgeoned by someone wearing a catcher's uniform. Tyrone's assailant proceeds to delete David's file from the Devils' computer system, which they infect with a virus. The catcher's next victim is Devils player, and assistant coach Terry's fianc√© Billy. He is taped onto a table, and is sodomized with a baseball bat. Out on the field, one of the commentators notices the catcher taking swings at non-existent balls, drilled by visions of Frank, who calls the catcher \\"Johnny\\". When the announcer goes to investigate, he is incapacitated, tied down to home plate, and killed when Johnny runs the bases, and kicks him in the head as he slides into home. In her office, Terry notices that her computer has made a list (everyone killed by Johnny so far) and that it is typing out more names on its own. David drops by to deal with paperwork related to his dismissal, but since the computer system is down and the antivirus program will take a while to fix it, he and Terry go to a lunchroom being cleaned by the janitor, Carl. David's erratic behavior causes Terry to storm back to her office, where the computer still refuses to work. Carl barges in, and leads Terry and David to a large amount of blood he has found. David takes off, so Terry has Carl pursue him, but the custodian loses the ex-catcher, and returns to Terry. At the batting cages, Coach Foster is strung up and shot to death with a pitching machine. Johnny then goes to the field, and finds Devils player Anthony making out with a woman. Johnny snaps Anthony's neck, and gives chase to the girlfriend, stuffing her into a washing machine when she is cornered in the laundry room. As that occurs, Carl tells Terry that it is the anniversary of the day Johnny McIntosh (the boy from the intro) bludgeoned his father, and that when Johnny was arrested he swore he would one day return. Terry dismisses Carl's story, until the two find Billy's body. The duo goes to look for David, and find him in the batting cages with Coach Foster's corpse. The two are convinced that David is the killer, and try to escape through the front gate, but David catches up to them, and a fight breaks out between him and Carl. David knocks Carl out, takes his keys, and chases after Terry, with the two of them encountering Johnny, who kills Carl. Terry and David flee, but Johnny catches them, knocks them unconscious, and places them on the field, which has been decorated with the bodies of all the male victims. A bat-wielding Johnny enters the field (which he hallucinates is full of spectators and players) and goes to home base, where David is bound and dressed like a catcher. Johnny forces Terry to be his pitcher, hits the third ball she throws, and drags her along as he runs the bases, distracting him and allowing David time to escape his binds. David and Johnny (who are dressed identically) fight, and Terry stabs one of them with a splintered bat, realizing too late it was David. As Johnny strangles Terry, she is saved by Anthony's girlfriend, and together the two bash Johnny's head in.  Cast  * David Heavener as David J.

The film was held in similar disdain by Vegan Voorhees, which awarded it a half-star, and criticized the plot, acting, editing, and gore effects. A Slash Above had a lukewarm reaction to The Catcher, writing that while the death scenes and mystery angle were fun and the direction was decent, the story, editing, lighting, score, and sound mixing left a lot to be desired.

This is borne out by the fact that around half of the national monuments declared by the NMC were located in what is now the Western Cape Province.Compare: List of heritage sites in South Africa with List of heritage sites in Western Cape = The Apartheid Era = Most of the period of existence the NMC fell within the apartheid era. During this period the organisation was governed by a Council made up exclusively of white South Africans and had a professional staff of similar composition. However, from not long after PW Botha's introduction of the Tricameral Parliament in 1984 the membership of the Council included one representative from each of the Coloured and Indian communities. During the de Klerk era (1989‚Äì1994) the organisation began to shift focus and declared a number of sites important to the history of the African community, including those associated with anti-apartheid movements, commencing with the declaration of the Sol Plaatje House in Kimberley in 1992.Government Gazette of South Africa, No. 14048, Pretoria: 19 June 1992 = Post-Apartheid = From 1994, under the post-Apartheid government, the make-up and focus of the organisation began to change to reflect the changes in South African society. During this period the composition of the Council and professional staff came to reflect the demographics of the country and a concerted effort was made to declare sites that reflected a broader national heritage. At the end of March 2000 the National Monuments Council was replaced by the South African Heritage Resources Agency, SAHRA, and over the following years the establishment of provincial heritage resources authorities saw the shift of the majority of its functions to provincial level. In terms of Section 58 of the National Heritage Resources Act national monuments became the responsibility of provincial heritage resources authorities and are now known as provincial heritage sites. A new category of national heritage site was created and is the responsibility of SAHRA. = Independence of Namibia = In 1990, when the territory of South West Africa became Namibia, the National Monuments Act remained in force and a National Monuments Council was established for the newly independent country. This organisation continued to operate until the promulgation of the Namibian Heritage Act of 2004 in terms of which the National Heritage Council was established.National Heritage Act , Government Notice 287, Government Gazette of the Republic of Namibia , No. 3361, Windhoek: 29 December 2004 = Legacy = The most noticeable legacy of the National Monuments Council is the bronze badge which still adorns most provincial heritage sites in South Africa and heritage places in Namibia. The term 'national monument' is still used by most South Africans and Namibians to refer to anything protected in terms of heritage legislation. Badge used on former national monuments More fundamental inheritances of present heritage resources authorities are: * The lists of provincial heritage sites and heritage places is heavily biased towards colonial heritage and the built environment. * There is a lack of integration of heritage management into the planning systems of local government, a legacy of the lack of relevant provisions in the National Monuments Act. * A lack of understanding of the importance and relevance of heritage conservation amongst the majority of South Africans and Namibians stemming from the focus of the NMC being for most of its existence mainly on heritage relevant to the white community.  Logo  The logo of the National Monuments Council was almost the same as that used by its predecessor, the Historical Monuments Commission. It depicts the entrance gate of the Cape Town Castle (the first historical monument to be declared by the Commission)p.2, Oberholster JJ, The Historical Monuments of South Africa, Cape Town: The Rembrandt van Rijn Foundation, 1972 surrounded by a wreath of King Proteas (South Africa's national flower) and capped with the national coat of arms that was used between 1910 and 2000. The only change from the Historical Monuments Commission period is the inclusion of a padr√£o in the centre of the castle gateway, a symbol of the Portuguese 'discovery' of Africa and apparently symbolic of the inclusion of South West Africa (now Namibia) within the area of jurisdiction of the organisation.  Offices  The Head Office of the National Monuments Council was in Cape Town and for most of its existence was the only base from which the organisation operated. From the mid-1980s 'regional offices' were established. The first was in Pretoria to service the then Transvaal province and thereafter in the other two provinces of the time, the Orange Free State (Bloemfontein) and Natal (initially Durban, but later Pietermaritzburg) provinces. The Cape Province came to be served by regional offices in Cape Town (Western Cape), Kimberley (Northern Cape) and Grahamstown (Eastern Cape). An office was also established in Windhoek, the capital of the South African governed territory of South West Africa. Following the establishment of nine provinces in 1994 the boundaries of the regions served were brought into line with those of provinces and over the next few years what were now called 'provincial offices' were established in those provinces that did not yet have an office. With the coming into effect of the National Heritage Resources Act in 1999, the records and in some cases staff of these offices were taken over by provincial heritage resources authorities.  Funding  The National Monuments Council received the bulk of its funds as a transfer payment from the department of the Minister responsible for culture. For most of its history this was the Department of National Education, but after 1994 the Department of Arts, Culture Science and Technology. The organisation also administered a number of trust funds established for the care of particular sites or types of heritage and derived income from properties which it owned, most notably Dal Josaphat near Paarl in the Western Cape.  Successor organisations  The following organisations are successors to the National Monuments Council: * Amafa aKwaZulu-Natali (KwaZulu-Natal Province) * Eastern Cape Provincial Heritage Resources Authority (Eastern Cape Province) * Heritage Free State (Free State Province) * Heritage Western Cape (Western Cape Province) * Limpopo Provincial Heritage Resources Authority (Limpopo Province) * Mpumalanga Provincial Heritage Resources Authority (Mpumalanga Province) * Northern Cape Heritage Resources Authority, (Northern Cape Province) * National Heritage Council of Namibia * North West Provincial Heritage Resources Authority (North West Province) * Provincial Heritage Resources Authority Gauteng (Gauteng Province) * South African Heritage Resources Agency (SAHRA) In Namibia the National Heritage Council is the successor in all respects whereas in South Africa the National Heritage Resources Act, specifically, but not exclusively Sections11-13, 23‚Äì26 and 58 thereof, establish how responsibilities are divided between the South African Heritage Resources Agency and provincial heritage resources authorities.National Heritage Resources Act, Act 25 of 1999, Government Notice 506, Republic of South Africa Government Gazette, Vol. 406, No 19974, Cape Town, 28 April 1999Section 68, National Heritage Act , Government Notice 287, Government Gazette of the Republic of Namibia , No. 3361, Windhoek: 29 December 2004  See also  * Provincial heritage resources authority * Amafa aKwaZulu-Natali * Heritage Western Cape * Northern Cape Heritage Resources Authority * National Heritage Council of Namibia * South African Heritage Resources Agency * Historical Monuments Commission * Provincial heritage site (South Africa) * National heritage site (South Africa) * Heritage objects (South Africa) * List of heritage sites in South Africa References External links  * National Heritage Council, Namibia * South African Heritage Resources Agency * Provincial Heritage Resources Authorities:  Western Cape ‚Äì Heritage Western Cape  KwaZulu Natal ‚Äì Amafa/Heritage KwaZulu Natal  Free State ‚Äì Heritage Free State  Eastern Cape ‚Äì Eastern Cape Provincial Heritage Resources Authority  Mpumalanga ‚Äì Mpumalanga Provincial Heritage Resources Authority  Limpopo ‚Äì Limpopo Heritage Resources Authority  North West ‚Äì North West Provincial Heritage Resources Authority  Northern Cape ‚Äì Ngwao-Boswa Jwa Kapa Bokone  Gauteng ‚Äì Provincial Heritage Resources Authority Gauteng * Legislation  Natural and Historical Monuments, Relics and Antiques Act, Act 4 of 1934  National Monuments Act, Act 28 of 1969 as amended to 1979  National Heritage Resources Act, Act 25 of 1999, Government Notice 506, Republic of South Africa Government Gazette, Vol. 406, No 19974, Cape Town: 28 April 1999  National Heritage Act, Government Notice 287, Government Gazette of the Republic of Namibia, No. 3361, Windhoek: 29 December 2004 Category:South African heritage resources Category:South African heritage sites Category:Heritage registers in South Africa Category:Government of Namibia Category:Namibian culture Category:Heritage organizations Category:History organisations based in South Africa ","title":"National Monuments Council (South Africa and Namibia)"},{"id":"38178734","text":"Perez v. Campbell, 402 U.S. 637 (1971), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that Arizona's law suspending a driver's license was unconstitutional due to its conflict with the federal Bankruptcy Act under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution.  Background  The plaintiffs, Mr. Adolfo and Mrs. Emma Perez, were licensed uninsured motorists in the state of Arizona. Insurance was not required under Arizona law. Mr. Perez was involved in a traffic accident and, unable to pay the associated costs, soon filed for bankruptcy. Arizona, under its financial responsibility laws, withdrew the Perez' licenses, and the couple filed suit in district court, where their claim was denied. The Perez family's appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit was denied, and they subsequently appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which granted certiorari.  Opinion of the Court  Justice White delivered the five-justice majority opinion, which held that the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act interfered with the purpose of the Bankruptcy Act ¬ß 17, a purpose which included giving those exiting bankruptcy the chance for a \\"clear field for future effort, unhampered by ... pre-existing debt.\\" This decision overruled precedent in Keeler v. Department of Public Safety, 269 US 153 (1962) and Reitz v. Mealey, 314 US 33 (1941), stating that those rulings \\"have no authoritative effect to the extent they are inconsistent with the controlling principle that state legislation that frustrates the full effectiveness of federal law is invalidated by the Supremacy Clause.\\",*Court Opinion at Justia and was seen as reinforcing \\"the Hines test\\", the rule specified for identifying Supremacy Clause violations in Hines v. Davidowitz (1941). Justice Blackmun, writing for a four-member minority, concurring in part and dissenting in part, would have upheld Keeler and Reitz, suggesting that the primary purpose of the Arizona law was not bankruptcy, but motorist responsibility.

The episode was written by Dan Greaney and directed by Matt Sohn. It originally aired on NBC on January 17, 2013. The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Clark returns from his stint as Jan's sexual assistant and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) enlists his help; the two pose as a father and son so that they can successfully sell to the owner of a suit warehouse. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) travels to Philadelphia with Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) to interview at Jim's new company. Meanwhile, Pam starts to realize that her family may have to leave Scranton. \\"Suit Warehouse\\" received mainly positive reviews from critics. The episode was also viewed by 4.15 million viewers and received a 2.1/5 percent rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, ranking second in its timeslot. The episode ultimately ranked as the highest-rated NBC series of the night. Synopsis Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) is off to Philadelphia to interview at Jim Halpert's (John Krasinski) new company, Athlead, and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) decides to come along, since office manager Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) is still not back from his sailboat excursion. She asks Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) to take care of a shipment of pens while she has gone. Pam's lack of specific instructions leaves Erin in a state of indecision over whether she should put the pens away once they arrive. She eventually decides to put them away for fear of being called lazy, but as she does so the other office workers teasingly accuse her of trying to take over Pam's job of office administrator in her absence. Mortified, Erin puts the pens back in the shipping box. On the drive to Athlead, Darryl opens up to Pam that he is worried about the interview, [Search Committee (The Office)having bad experience with interviews. At Jim's new company, Pam gives Darryl a thumbs up as he heads into the interview room, and then is chatted up by an employee who says \\"Jim speaks about you all the time\\" and we \\"can't wait for you to move here.\\" The thought of moving to Philadelphia disturbs her. Meanwhile, Darryl initially fumbles his interview due to nerves and feelings of inadequacy, but everyone else helps calm him down, and he makes a strong reversal. Darryl concludes the interview by attempting to shoot a basket with the room's sports decorations, but instead knocks a light fixture into the fish tank, electrocuting all the fish. Pam commiserates with Darryl over this embarrassing misstep. Jim returns to inform Darryl that although he will have to pay for the fish, he has the job. During the drive home, Darryl gushes over his new job and the chance to live in Philadelphia while Pam worries about where she and her family will be in the future. At Dunder Mifflin, Clark Green (Clark Duke) returns from his stint as Jan Levinson's (Melora Hardin) sexual assistant, in exchange for Jan giving them her business. Despite the awkward past couple of weeks, Jan has gifted them an espresso machine, and the rest of the office jumps on the opportunity to \\"test\\" out several espresso flavors. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) enlists Clark's help to snag a newly freed account at a suit warehouse; the two will pose as a father and son so that they can successfully sell to the Stones, father and son owners of the warehouse. Dwight leads off on how proud he is of Clark to Sam Stone Sr. (Ed Lauter), but when Stone admits that he and his son are not on good terms, Dwight and Clark awkwardly shift gears and begin a show of childishly sniping at each other. Clark tries to move on to business, but Dwight continues to interrupt him with insults, and even makes a dig at Sam Stone Jr. (Will Greenberg) when he arrives. When the elder Stone reveals that his son has forced him out of the company and that he is now there strictly for his own social benefit, Clark takes the lead and makes the sale to the younger Stone. Both Dwight and Clark also buy a suit from the company to celebrate their team sale. Back at the office, the staff have drunk multiple cups of espresso and experience a caffeine rush along with a powerful surge in office productivity. As the rush dies down, they all begin to sweat profusely, become highly irritable and argumentative, try to relocate the copy machine and frantically tear up the office carpet to reveal the hardwood underneath. At five o'clock everybody leaves the office in total disarray. When Pam and Darryl arrive back from Philadelphia, Erin angrily tells Pam she didn't take care of the pens, and they are bewildered by the sight they encounter. Production \\"Suit Warehouse\\" was written by consulting producer Dan Greaney, his second writing credit for the series, after \\"Mrs. California\\". The episode was also directed by Matt Sohn, his seventh directorial effort for the series, following the ninth season entry, \\"Roy's Wedding\\". The episode features the return of series regular Clark Duke, having previously left for several episodes in order to film Kick-Ass 2. The episode is the fourth not to feature Andy Bernard (Ed Helms). Helms left the series temporarily, in the season's sixth episode, \\"The Boat\\", in order to film The Hangover Part III. The official website of The Office included several cut scenes from \\"Suit Warehouse\\" within a week of the episode's release. In the first 64-second clip, more scenes of the effect of the espresso machine are seen and the increased productivity from the Scranton branch. In the second 47-second clip, Erin grows ecstatic when the pens are finally delivered. In the third 80-second clip, the Scranton branch gets distracted on their smartphones. Cultural references When Oscar gets excited about drinking all the types of espresso, he shouts \\"YOLO\\", a carpe diem-esque phrase popularized by the song \\"The Motto\\" by Canadian rapper Drake. Pam calls Jim \\"Gumby with hair\\" to calm down a nervous Darryl; this is a reference to the green clay humanoid character created and modeled by Art Clokey, who also created Davey and Goliath. Both Pam and Darryl marvel at how Jim has managed to \\"Zuckerberg\\" his new office, a reference to Mark Zuckerberg, the American programmer and internet entrepreneur, who founded Facebook. Broadcast and reception=Ratings= \\"Suit Warehouse\\" originally aired on NBC on January 17, 2013. In its original American broadcast, the episode was viewed 4.15 million viewers and received a 2.1 rating/5 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 2.1 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 5 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. The Office ranked second in its timeslot, being beaten by an episode of the ABC series Grey's Anatomy which received a 3.0 rating/8% share. In addition, The Office was the highest-rated NBC television program on the night it aired. =Reviews= The episode featured the return of Clark Duke, who received positive reviews for his performance and storyline. IGN writer Cindy White criticized the espresso subplot and the episode in general, for the lack of authority in the office, due to Jim, Andy and Pam leaving the office. She also called the plot too similar to the season five episode, \\"Cafe Disco\\". She complimented the use of the ensemble players throughout the plot and praised the Dwight-Clark storyline, comparing it positively to the season three episode, \\"Traveling Salesmen\\". She also compared the Jim-Darryl-Pam storyline to the style of the early seasons, writing that it \\"was the stuff of classic Office, making you cringe as you are forced watch someone digging a hole deeper and deeper for himself\\". She gave the episode a 7.5/10, calling it \\"Good\\". Damon Houx of Screen Crush called the episode \\"solid\\" and praised the use of the whole ensemble cast. He also complimented the build-up towards a future conflict between Jim and Pam, and said that while he is \\"still waiting for the show to hit the gravitational pull of wrapping up\\" and that the show \\"probably should have ended three years ago\\", the episode was still good. New York writer Michael Tedder wrote that the episode had a nice balance of cringe humor, particularly in Darryl's job interview for Athlead. He also praised the set-up for the Dwight-Clark subplot, saying that the plotline was perfect for their dynamic and could not work with previous seasons. He was also complimentary towards the espresso subplot and gave the episode four out of five stars.

The episode was written by Jonathan Green and Gabe Miller, and directed by Kelly Cantley. It originally aired on NBC on January 24, 2013. The episode guest stars Chris Diamantopoulos as Brian the boom mike operator, and Ben Silverman as Isaac, a coworker of Jim's. The series‚Äîpresented as if it were a real documentary‚Äîdepicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) is forced to miss his daughter's first recital after a major investor exits his company, leading to a fight with his wife Pam (Jenna Fischer). Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) tries to prevent Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) from leaving the office. Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) tries to put an end to Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) and Erin Hannon's (Ellie Kemper) flirting with each other. This episode also begins to finally reveal who is behind the documentary. The episode received largely positive reviews from television critics; many praised Krasinski and Fischer for the dramatic fight at the end. Furthermore, the reveal of the camera crew was commented upon by many critics. The episode was viewed by 4.19 million viewers and received a 2.0/5 percent rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, ranking third in its timeslot. The episode ultimately ranked as the highest-rated NBC series of the night. Synopsis Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) is upset that Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) will be leaving Dunder- Mifflin to join Athlead, Jim Halpert's (John Krasinski) startup. He tries to browbeat Darryl into staying with Dunder-Mifflin by tallying up his perceived job failures since taking the Athlead job and holding a meeting on customer loyalty with a customer he describes as \\"enraged\\", but who demurs at the characterization. When this is ineffective, Dwight joins Darryl's delivery run to make the job more \\"fun\\", including ordering a milkshake at a fast food drive-through and throwing it at the server, shouting \\"Fire in the hole!\\" Morally outraged, Darryl forces Dwight to stay behind and clean up the mess, whereupon another customer pulls the same prank on Dwight himself. Darryl later laughs at footage of the event that has been uploaded onto the internet, saying that this is what he will miss when he moves to Philadelphia. Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) assigns Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) to a social media project that meets with some success. She notices the two flirting with each other for the first time and assumes that she brought it on with the project, citing several unintentional double entendres in her project e-mails. She feels guilty because Erin is Andy Bernard's (Ed Helms) girlfriend and Andy recommended Nellie to the adoption agency, and is afraid that Andy will fire her when he finds out. She hijacks Dwight's customer loyalty meeting to talk about fidelity in relationships, which soon zeroes in on Erin and Pete. Nellie also ends the social media project so they will not be able to flirt. Shamed by Nellie's fidelity speech, Erin assumes a coldly professional attitude towards Pete. However, a talk with Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) reminds Nellie that Andy was not the best boyfriend to Erin and Nellie has second thoughts. She soon restarts the project, \\"forcing\\" Erin and Pete to work together again, much to their delight. Jim's plan to drive home from Philadelphia to see his daughter Cece's ballet recital hits a snag when a major investor says he is backing out. Jim asks his wife Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) to record the recital with her phone, which she agrees to do. During the opening of the recital, she stops recording to take a phone call informing her that she has been chosen to paint an important public mural. In her excitement, she messes up the recording and fails to record any of Cece's appearance. Jim calls her that evening to tell her the investor backed out, and his group will have to work long hours to make up the lost funds. He asks her to send him her recording of the recital as a way to cheer him up, and Pam confesses that she did not tape it. She tries to make light of the mishap by making self-deprecating remarks and pointing out that they can get recordings of the recital from other attendees, but he becomes frustrated at her, scolding her and starting a fight over his new job, the time he spends away from the family, and the sacrifices they are making to get their new life to work. After he hangs up, Pam breaks down in tears. A previously unseen boom operator named Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos) enters into the shot and comforts her, and tells the crew to stop filming. Production The episode guest starred Chris Diamantopoulos as the boom mic operator for the fictional documentary. \\"Customer Loyalty\\" was written by co- executive producers Jonathan Green and Gabe Miller, their second writing credit for the series after \\"Andy's Ancestry\\". It was directed by Kelly Cantley, making her television directorial debut; Cantley previously served as a first assistant director on the series and directed The Office webisode series The Mentor. The episode is the first of the series to actively feature a member of the documentary crew interacting with the characters on screen; before the episode was aired, showrunner Greg Daniels stated that this episode would begin to reveal who was behind the documentary. Originally, the idea to have a sound man named Brian comfort Pam when she was crying was proposed by former series actress and writer Mindy Kaling. According to an interview with B. J. Novak, she had proposed it during the show's third season. The episode guest stars Chris Diamantopoulos as Brian the boom operator. Brian's character is named after the series' actual boom mic operator, Brian Wittle. Wittle played the part of one of the annoyed parents at Cece's recital. Ben Silverman also appears as Issac, one of Jim's coworkers at Athlead. This marks Silverman's third appearance, after cameoing in the episodes \\"Here Comes Treble\\" and \\"Suit Warehouse\\". The cold open features a montage of Jim setting up a prank‚Äîwhich involves sending Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail. Through Jim's voice-over, it is heavily suggested that Jim set up the prank sometime circa 2006, which would have taken place during the show's second season. Appropriately, the montage was filmed to look as if the documentarians were using archival footage of Jim; his hair matches the style that Jim had during the first few seasons of the show. This is not the first time this technique has been used on the show. During the cold open for the sixth season episode \\"Shareholder Meeting\\", a montage of Dwight harassing past receptionists was shown. Furthermore, during the seventh season episode \\"Threat Level Midnight\\" was filmed to give the impression that Threat Level Midnight, an amateur feature directed by Michael Scott, had been filmed and edited during the first seven or so seasons of the show. Broadcast and reception=Ratings= \\"Customer Loyalty\\" originally aired on NBC on January 24, 2013. Before the premiere of the episode, OfficeTally‚Äîthe largest fan site for the series‚Äîwas given a message by the show's producers that urged fans to watch \\"Customer Loyalty\\" due to the major reveal at the end of the episode. Reportedly, the producers had never done this before. In its original American broadcast, the episode was viewed by 4.19 million viewers and received a 2.0 rating/5 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 2.0 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 5 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. The Office ranked third in its timeslot, being beaten by an episode of the ABC series Grey's Anatomy which received a 3.0/8 percent rating, and an installment of the Fox series Glee which received a 2.6/7 percent rating. The Office was the highest-rated NBC television program on the night it aired. 2.04 million viewers watched the episode through DVR playback, bringing the total viewership to 6.24 million. =Reviews= \\"Customer Loyalty\\" received largely positive reviews from television critics. James Poniewozik of Time magazine concluded that it \\"showed the stakes behind its characters' paper- pushing lives in a way it hasn't since Michael Scott left Scranton.\\" He called the first half a \\"wacky ensemble show\\", but said that the last part featured elements that allowed the audience to \\"all but hear the old machinery [of earlier episodes] waking up and sliding into place\\". Poniewozik stated that Jim and Pam's fight was \\"believable in its arc and its parameters\\" and that both characters were presented in a way in which their plights were understandable. Ally Serrigran of Hollywood.com wrote that the \\"episode was one worth tuning in for.\\" She felt that, for fans of the show who had left when Steve Carell departed, \\"Customer Loyalty\\" was the right episode for them to come back to the series. She called the fight between Jim and Pam \\"jarring in and of itself\\". Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald commented on the fight between Jim and Pam, writing that it \\"felt just like the kind of argument that two real people would have.\\" Brett Harrison Davinger of the California Literary Review wrote that the episode was \\"fine\\" and was composed of \\"several small storylines, all of which worked\\". Davinger called the ending \\"odd\\" but \\"effective\\". Michael Tedder of Vulture wrote positively of the episode and awarded it four out of five stars. He called the final fight between Pam and Jim \\"ugly and real\\" and one in which \\"the writers didn't flinch\\", in that it truly made him feel uncomfortable. Tedder complimented both Fischer and Krasinski, and wrote that Krasinski \\"doesn't try to make Jim look charming in this fight, just terrified and exhausted.\\" He called Nellie's subplot \\"the best use of this new version of Nellie\\", but wrote that Dwight and Darryl's subplot was undeveloped. Rick Porter of Zap2it felt that, while the episode was \\"up and down\\" (he wrote that Dwight and Darryl's subplot was \\"flat\\", but that Erin and Pete's yielded several humorous lines) the final confrontation between Jim and Pam was \\"a big dose of reality\\" and that it was not \\"a contrived fight\\". David Wilcox of The Citizen wrote that the fight between Pam and Jim was \\"welcome\\" because their relationship had grown stale ever since they had \\"hooked up and started living their perfect little lives together.\\" Wilcox praised the way in which the fight was written, and wrote that he \\"couldn't help smiling. Not because the fight wasn't wrenching to watch. But because it was.\\" Cindy White of IGN awarded the episode a 7.8 out of 10, denoting a \\"good\\" episode. She reasoned that while the episode was funny but largely forgettable, the final scene made it worth watching. Not all reviews were as positive. Erik Adams of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"C+\\", and called it \\"a middle-of-the-road table-setting episode of The Office\\" with a \\"tacked-on coda\\". Adams wrote that the episode was \\"not really a 'story' at all\\" because it was dragged down by elements that are necessary for the episode to play as a standalone piece, even though \\"it's not meant to be taken as\\" one. Adams was complimentary towards the episode's cold open but wrote that \\"there aren't a whole lot of quality laughs in 'Customer Loyalty. Nick Campbell of TV.com felt that the Erin and Pete relationship was not constructed properly, nor was the conclusion satisfying. Furthermore, he felt that the ending fight was \\"petty\\". Many reviews commented on the reveal of the documentary crew. E! Online named the reveal one of the \\"Best TV Moments of the Week\\". Verne Gay of Newsday called the scene a \\"historic\\" moment for the show. Serrigran wrote that, between Jim and Pam fighting, and the cameramen making an appearance, the scene was \\"a lot to take in\\". However, she felt that the scene was properly done. Jason Hughes of The Huffington Post called the reveal a \\"huge\\" and \\"shocking\\" moment. Tedder called the reveal \\"something that we've never seen before on The Office.\\" He admitted that, \\"the last five minutes of this episode genuinely startled me, which is an impressive feat for a series on its ninth and final season.\\" Porter called the shots with Brian \\"good\\" because it reaffirmed that the camera crew was a character, one that had been an integral part of the show. Wilcox wrote that Brian's appearance was a \\"weird turn\\", and that it was \\"kind of funny\\" that the first time a member of the camera crew intervened with the characters was when Pam needed comforting and not \\"one of Dwight or Michael's dozens of near-death experiences.\\" Poniewozik enjoyed the reveal of the documentary crew. However, he wrote that, \\"I don't know if I'm going to like the idea of making Brian an actual player in the events, if indeed that's where the show is going.\\" Adams, on the other hand, said that the reveal of the cameramen was \\"a Big Moment for The Office, but it has a hollow ring to it\\" because the cameramen had never before interacted with the members of the office before. Campbell wrote that \\"the show played its documentary crew trump card WAY too early\\" and noted that the crew had never intervened in past events that were on the same level as Pam crying.

Following their inception, they sponsored over 60,000 units of cooperative housing in 35 states across the US. In the 1960s the organization began operations outside of the U.S. developing cooperative housing in Central America. In the 1970s this trend of working outside of the U.S. to develop housing continued and in the 1980s Global Communities' programming was entirely international. Through the rest of the 1980s and the 1990s the organization expanded its portfolio of programs and began addressing other community needs and not just housing.

It is referred by the deaf community as \\"gestel\\" when signed in Dutch Sign Language. The School was founded in 1840 by Father Martinus van Beek, a Roman Catholic priest. It was one of the five big deaf schools in the Netherlands.  History  SInce 1828, Van Beek gave religious instruction to the four deaf children in Gemert, North Brabant, using a mixture of sign language, writing and fingerspelling. The motivation behind his teaching was to teach the Scriptures as he was anxious about deaf Catholics not knowing Church teachings. At that time, there was another deaf school in the north of the Netherlands, established in 1790. As in Groningen was led by a Protestant, Van Beek was quite anxious to create a boarding school for deaf children from Catholic families, to prevent them from going to Groningen. With help from the Roman Catholic Bishops of 's-Hertogenbosch and Breda, Van Beek was given the castle at Sint-Michielsgestel. which was used as a former seminary. The were asked to come and help teaching deaf children, They came on 15 September 1840 in St. Michielsgestel. Five years later in 1845, the Brothers of Maastricht came to educate the boys at IvD. In 1908, the foundation stone for the huge neo-Gothic building was laid on Theerestraat, Sint-Michielsgestel. The design was done by Hubert van Groenendael. The new building was completed in 1910 and the School moved out of the castle. Due to dwindling numbers of the Sisters in their Order, 31 October 1990 saw the last two Sisters leaving the School.  Hostiebakkerij St. Michael  In 1844, the Sisters started which is a wafer bakery, created as an employment scheme for deaf people. There they would make communion breads and sell them to churches and Catholic organisations. It is now taken over by Kentalis. There the hosts are produced for churches in the Netherlands, the United States, the United Kingdom and Suriname. Hosts are sent to missionaries. After many years, a new building was built on Mgr. Hermuslaan, a stone's throw from the old bakery. It is one of the largest host bakeries, producing approximately 70m hosts every year, including gluten-free wafers.  Language Use at IvD  At its location at Nieuw-Herlaar, oralism was introduced gradually in 1855 with sign language being banned in 1990. From the beginning, the School used the Van Beek gestures system, which is still used there today, mainly with deaf people with intellectual disabilities. A few interpreters reported saying they still use the system as their deaf parents were educated at IvD. After the School's change to oralism, the use of sign language and gestures was actively discouraged with children being punished in the classroom. This happened both psychologically (through public lists of students who are most gestures were made) as physically, through the tying of hands and repeatedly hitting the fingers with a ruler after occasional use of gestures. It is speculated that the quality of education was in decline because much time was spent on speech training at the expense of other subjects and general language development. Professor , a former teacher at IvD, got into a fight with the school in 1964 about language use there as Father Van Uden discouraged the use of sign language there. However, from the 1990s, the School started to understand Tervoort's arguments who was way ahead of his time. Viataal had two of Tervoort's PhD students on its board of trustees.  Merge  The merge between IvD and the Nijmegen-based Mgr. Terwindt Foundation was taken place in 1998 with the new name being IvD / MTW. In 2003, it was renamed as Viataal, with its main offices being on the IvD campus. In 2009, it was decided that Viataal was to be merged with KEGG and Sint-Marie to consolidate as Kentalis.  Controversy  The School was the last deaf school in the Netherlands resisting the adoption of sign bilingualism campaigned by the deaf community, however with Kentalis taking over Viataal (the IvD successor organisation), sign bilingualism is enforced. In 2002, sexual abuse among the pupils there at the School was reported. A book written by a former pupil was released at the same time, recounting his experiences with sexual abuse at IvD.

Floris of Montmorency. by Hillebrant van Wouw I. Floris van Montmorency, baron of Montigny (?, 1528 - Simancas, 14 October 1570) was a noble and diplomat from the Spanish Netherlands. He was born as the son of Jozef van Montmorency, Count of Nevele and Anna van Egmont the Elder, and was the younger brother of Philip de Montmorency, Count of Horn. Floris had a military training at the court of his relative Anne de Montmorency, Constable of France. He accompanied Emperor Charles V to Spain after his abdication. At his return, Floris became a Knight in the Order of the Golden Fleece with the support of William the Silent and against the wishes of Philip II of Spain. He was also appointed as Governor of the Tournaisis. As the rest of the high nobility in Flanders, Floris was a strong opponent to Cardinal Granvelle. In April 1566, he was sent by the Council of State with John IV of Glymes to Spain in a last attempt to avoid war. As Glymes was wounded on the leg before leaving, Floris travelled alone. When the Beeldenstorm raged across the Low Countries, Floris was arrested and kept in house arrest in the castle at Simancas. When Egmont en Horn were arrested in Brussels, Floris was also condemned to death by the Council of Troubles. Instead of returning him to the Low Countries for his sentence to be executed, Philip II of Spain had Floris strangled in secret despite the pleas of his new wife Anna of Austria to release Floris, and spread the rumor that he had died of disease.

It was heard in the Natal Provincial Division on November 17, 2000, with judgment handed down the same day. GM MacKenzie was counsel, as State Attorney, for the plaintiff; CJ Hartzenberg SC appeared for the first defendant. There was no appearance for the second defendant. The presiding officer was Combrinck J, to whom fell the adjudication of a stated case in an action for damages arising from a motor vehicle accident. The case concerned a claim for compensation in terms of the Motor Vehicle Accidents ActAct 84 of 1986. The question was whether or not the injuries resulting from the accident were \\"caused by or [had] aris[en] out of the driving of a motor vehicle\\" as contemplated in section 8(1) of the Act. Words \\"caused by\\" referred to the direct cause of the injury, while the words \\"arising out of\\" referred to the case where the injury, although not directly caused by the driving, was nevertheless causally connected with the driving, and where the driving was a sine qua non thereof. Some limitation, however, had to be placed on the application of the sine qua non concept: The court held that it ought to be guided by the object and the scope of the Act, and by notions of common sense. It was possible that, where the direct cause of the damage was some act antecedent or ancillary to the driving, such damage might be said nonetheless to have \\"aris[en] out of\\" the driving. The court would have to have regard to the facts of case and to apply ordinary, common-sense standards in determining whether or not there existed a causal connection between the damage and the driving sufficiently real and close to enable it to say that the death or injury had \\"aris[en] out of\\" the driving. In the present case, the spillage of fuel from a stationary vehicle onto the road surface, as a result of the driver's attempt to rectify a fault in the fuel system, that he might continue driving, had caused other vehicles to skid on the fuel and collide, resulting both in injuries and in deaths. These the court found to have \\"aris[en] out of\\" the driving of the truck, notwithstanding the fact that the truck was stationary at the time of the accident.  Facts  A collision had occurred between two vehicles when one of them skidded on diesel that had spilled from a truck belonging to the second defendant. The truck had broken down alongside the road. It appeared that, after the truck had broken down, the driver, supposing that there was a problem with the vehicle's fuel supply, opened a stopcock, which permitted diesel fuel to flow into the main fuel tank from another tank. He also opened the filler cap of the main fuel tank, to inspect its interior. Thereafter he not only omitted to close the stopcock, but also omitted properly to replace the filler cap. As a result, diesel escaped from the main fuel tank onto the road surface, thus causing the accident. One person suffered injuries and another died as a result of the accident.  Judgment  The court found that the words \\"caused by\\" in section 8(1) of the Motor Vehicle Accidents Act refer to the direct cause of the injury, whereas the words \\"arising out of\\" refer to the case where the injury, although not directly caused by the driving, is nevertheless causally connected with the driving and the driving is a sine qua non thereof. An uncontrolled application of the causa sine qua non concept, however, could bring about consequences never contemplated or intended by the Legislature. Combrinck J decided, therefore, that some limitation must be placed on the application of this concept: The Court should be guided by a consideration of the object and the scope of the Act, and by notions of common sense. Where the direct cause of death or bodily injury is some act antecedent or ancillary to the driving, it could not normally be said that the death or injury was \\"caused by\\" the driving, but it might be found to have arisen out of the driving. Whether that could be found would depend upon the particular facts of the case and whether, applying ordinary common-sense standards, it could be said that the causal connection between the death or injury and the driving was sufficiently real and close to enable the court to say that the death or injury did indeed arise out of the driving.984F-985D.

Combrinck J held, on the facts, that there was a sufficiently close link between the injuries and death, on the one hand, and the driving of the second defendant's truck, on the other, to justify the conclusion that the injuries and death had \\"arisen out of\\" the driving of the truck, as contemplated in section 8(1). The very reason why the driver had removed the filler cap of the main fuel tank was because he had experienced trouble while driving the truck. His act in opening the stopcock and removing and replacing the filler cap was intended to rectify the problem, and to allow him to continue driving the vehicle. The direct result of that ancillary act was the spilling of the diesel, which caused the accident and the resultant damage. In the circumstances, common sense dictated that the death and injuries had arisen from the driving of G the second defendant's truck.985I-986A, 986D-E.

It was also termed a blind promise or rash boon. It is classified as Aarne-Thompson M223 and likely has an Oriental origin.  Examples  The motif involves a character who makes a promise pertaining to love for another character. The first character promises to grant the other his/her love if an impossible wish is granted. Alternately, the first character could promise the second anything he/she asks for in exchange for escape from a life-or-death situation. A notable example of the first scenario is Geoffrey Chaucer's \\"The Franklin's Tale\\", itself partly based on Boccaccio's The Filocolo; Dorigen, a married woman whose husband is absent, promises another suitor that he may have her if she makes the rocks on the coast of Brittany disappear. An example of the second variation is found in Chaucer's \\"The Wife of Bath's Tale\\", where the main character, a young rapist knight threatened with execution if he cannot answer the question \\"What do women want?,\\" promises an older woman (the proverbial \\"loathly lady\\") anything she desires if she can provide the answer (she desires to marry him).

It is not found in primates, including humans, who have lost the GGTA1 gene. Their immune systems recognize it as a foreign body and produce xenoreactive immunoglobulin M antibodies, leading to organ rejection after transplantation. Anti-alpha gal immunoglobulin G antibodies are some of the most common in humans. Regular stimulation from gut flora, typically initiated within the first six months of life, leads to an exceptionally high titre of around 1% of all circulating IgG. Alpha gal has also been suggested to play a role in an IgE-specific allergic response to some meats. While this allergic response is quite well documented, there is significant discrepancy between laboratory tests and clinical findings, indicating that much research must still be done on the alpha gal mechanism of action and related tests. Recent studies are showing increasing evidence that this allergy may be induced by the bite of the lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum)\\"Bad bite: Doctors see surge of sudden meat allergies caused by ticks that are spreading in US\\" USNews, July 7, 2014 in North America and the castor bean tick (Ixodes ricinus) in Sweden.

Augmenting traditional corporate philanthropy and participatory cause marketing, democratized transactional giving empowers consumers to become better brand and cause advocates while promoting a strong behavioral influence that seeks to yield greater loyalty and brand commitment. Successful democratized transactional giving is the outgrowth or result of a fully realized cause-related loyalty marketing campaign which not only links nonprofits and for-profits together, but does so in the context of an existing company's loyalty program. The result is that consumers can convert any unused rewards issued by the company in the form of points, miles or other units to causes and nonprofits of their own choosing.  Difference from traditional corporate philanthropy  According to KULA Causes, Inc., of Boulder, Colorado, which in 2010 designed and launched the Cause-Related Loyalty Marketing (CLM) software solution for companies looking to improve their loyalty and philanthropic efforts, corporate philanthropy/cause marketing has evolved in three phases. Phase one was an autocratic approach where the brand selected the cause in question, the brand told the ‚Äúcause story,‚Äù and the result was low customer behavioral influence. Phase two witnessed the growth of participatory cause marketing. Under this improvement, the brand still selects a number of causes (and tells the cause story) while customers choose causes from among that limited selection. The result is growing customer behavioral influence. In democratized transactional giving decisions and brand advocacy responsibility has been passed on to the consumer ‚Äì a level of control that inspires a strong behavioral influence.  Benefits for companies  When companies allow customers to donate unused rewards to causes of the customer's choosing, the customer develops a greater appreciation for the company. Edelman PR found in its 2012 Goodpurpose Study that \\"72% of consumers would recommend a brand that supports a good cause over one that doesn‚Äôt, a 39% increase since 2008.\\"Allison Goldberg, \\"Introducing: Goodpurpose 2012\\", Purpose. Edelman.com, April 25, 2102 By facilitating democratized transactional giving, companies can see that benefit as deepened customer loyalty.  Benefits for consumers  Humans‚Äô hard-wired capacity for empathy fuels the desire to help those in need, because people can imagine themselves in the same situation.Ray B. Williams, \\"Are We Entering the Age of Empathy?\\", Psychology Today, October 25, 2009 Consumers who act on this impulse benefit from the positive feelings associated with spending money on a good cause.Elizabeth W. Dunn, Daniel T. Gilbert and Timothy D. Wilson, 2011, \\"If money doesn't make you happy, then you probably aren't spending it right\\", Journal of Consumer Psychology 21, 117-118  Benefits for nonprofits  Nonprofits as a whole benefit when consumers rather than companies dictate where donations, including donations of unredeemed loyalty-program rewards, will go. This is because increasing numbers of consumers participating in democratized transactional giving also mean a wider diversity of nonprofits being helped according to each individual consumer's cause affinities ‚Äì the types of causes they tend to support.

Life Paul Mebes was born on 23 January 1872 in Magdeburg. He completed practical training as a carpenter and then studied at the Braunschweig University of Technology and the Berlin Institute of Technology in Charlottenburg. After graduating he worked as a government architect (assessor) in the public works department. By 1906 (according to some sources as early as 1902) Mebes was working for the Berlin Civil Servants Dwelling Association. From 1909 to 1919, he served as a part-time member of its technical board. From 1911, he and Paul Emmerich ran the architectural firm of \\"Mebes and Emmerich\\", which was devoted mainly to the Dwelling Association's buildings. The firm also created designs for other buildings, including schools and administrative buildings. On 19 November 1920 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Braunschweig University of Technology. In 1931 Mebes became a member of the Prussian Academy of Arts. He resigned this membership on 15 May 1933. Mebes died on 9 April 1938 in Berlin. His memorial grave is located in the St√§dtischer Friedhof Berlin-Zehlendorf.. The \\"Paul Mebes Park\\" on Potsdamer Strasse at the corner of Fischer-Dieskau-way in Zehlendorf, Berlin was named in his honor. Style Former commerce building of the Iduna insurance company at Charlottenstra√üe No. 82 in Berlin-Kreuzberg. It was built in 1913 to a design by Paul Mebes. The building has been designated as a cultural heritage monument. Mebes' designs were innovative and won him recognition in Europe. He was one of the pioneers of housing estates before the First World War. His apartment building designs for the Berlin Civil Servants Dwelling Association and the Kroch village in Leipzig were particularly notable. The activity of Mebes can be divided into three periods: the early phase (1909‚Äì1918), an expressive phase (1918‚Äì1924) and the substantive phase that continued until his death (1925‚Äì1938). The early phase was characterized by work within the traditional architecture of Berlin's early days, with elaborate stucco facades and indiscriminate eclecticism. Here, Mebes worked entirely within existing styles: particularly often using classical details, but various forms of North German or Baroque Dutch details, and even early Gothic forms, occur. In the expressive phase, residential buildings were created with expressive, but sparingly used elements, such as contrasting colors of alternating brick and plaster, jagged protruding stairways and pointed windows. From the second half of the 1920s he created buildings in a classical modernism style. Mebes was less concerned about the details than before, but still designed aesthetically coherent works. He continued to emphasize color effects. He made carefully considered floor plans, with bright and well ventilated apartments.

Hamilton. It was first published in 2012 by Macmillan. Jonathan Wright of SFX magazine said, \\"Peter F Hamilton‚Äôs latest novel may be a standalone tale (although there‚Äôs plenty of scope for sequels), but it‚Äôs a thuddingly imposing 1,100 pages in length. Not that it seems that way when you‚Äôre reading it. Balancing a multi-stranded plot, different exotic locales and a huge cast of characters, Hamilton plunges us straight into a murder mystery set in a near-future Newcastle, a city now adjacent to a portal to another world, the tropical St Libra.\\" Synopsis In AD 2142, where portal technology allows instantaneous travel to other planets, Newcastle police detective Sidney Hurst heads a high-tech investigation of the disturbing murder of a clone of the wealthy North family. Hurst has the added challenge of the politics and media associated with the high profile murder, as well as the opaque mystery itself. The body shows the same wounds as that of Bartram North, murdered twenty years ago on the tropical planet St Libra. The bio-fuel that flows from St Libra is a mainstay of Earth's economy and so powerful vested interests are watching over Hurst's shoulder. Angela Tramelo was convicted and jailed for that murder but it seems that her story of an alien attack might be true. Tramelo, who has not aged in her twenty years in prison, is released into the custody of the Human Defence Alliance and taken on an expedition via the Newcastle gateway to St Libra.

Yadav grew up in the Kasturba Nagar slum, which is outside the Indian central city of Nagpur, Maharashtra. He lived and did business in the slum which housed a number of criminals and two rival gangs. Yadav's earliest known crime was a gang rape in 1991. Yadav and his gang committed crimes like rape, murder, home invasion, and extortion in Kasturba Nagar for 13 years until his death. Yadav tried to create a small business empire; he extorted money, harming and threatening those who resisted him. During his life as a criminal, Yadav murdered at least three individuals. He tortured and kidnapped people, invaded homes, and raped over 40 women and girls. He bribed police, giving them money and buying them drinks to convince them to let him continue committing crimes. As a result, the police not only refused to stop Yadav for many years but supported him. Yadav and his associates gang raped women and girls as young as age 10 as a warning to those who resisted him. After a woman named Usha Narayane resisted Yadav and his gang, a mob burned down his house. Yadav went to the police seeking protection. On 13 August 2004, he was lynched by several hundred women who stabbed and stoned him. He had chili powder thrown in his face, and his penis was hacked off. The women all claimed responsibility for the murder, and although some were arrested, they were eventually acquitted. Although hundreds of women were involved in the lynching, the State CID had a different version of the events. Senior police sources said the lynching was carried out by four men and that the women who had claimed responsibility were protecting them. None of the women agreed with the police version. Police said that both men and women were present when the lynch mob appeared. On the day of the lynching, BBC News initially reported that about 14 women and several children forced their way into the courtroom and stabbed Yadav to death. Biography=Early life= Akku Yadav grew up in the Kasturba Nagar slum outside the central Indian city of Nagpur, Maharashtra. He had two brothers‚ÄîSantosh and Yuvraj. Yadav lived and did business in the slum, which housed some criminals and, according to police, two rival gangs who worked the area. In her book Killing Justice: Vigilantism in Nagpur, author Swati Mehta wrote: \\"by all accounts, a child of the neighborhood, Akku had graduated from milkman's son to local menace.\\" =Crimes= In their book Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide, authors Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn wrote: \\"Akku Yadav was, in a sense, the other 'success' of Kasturba Nagar. He was a higher-caste man who had turned an apprenticeship as a small- time thug into a role as a mobster and king of the slum.\\" Yadav ruled a gang of criminals who controlled the Kasturba Nagar slum. They robbed, tortured, and killed people with impunity. Yadav committed crimes for several years as he created a small business empire. Akku and his gang members often harassed and intimidated people to extort money. Extortion was his main source of income. Yadav characteristically threatened to rape anyone who resisted him. He would hurt people if they did not give him money or if they angered him in any way. Pratibha Urkude and her husband Dattu ran a small grocery shop and Yadav harassed them for years. He would pick up goods from the shop and refuse to pay or would simply pay much less than was owed. Sometimes he would demand money and become violent if they were unable to pay. Yadav often worried he was being plotted against. As a result, he did not permit men or women to gather and talk. He made sure young boys did not play together, and if they did, Yadav would break up their games. Suspicious that people were asking questions about him, he would warn people against reporting his crimes to police, threatening them if they did so. Killing left inconvenient corpses that required him to bribe police to prevent them from stopping his crimes. Rape, however, was very stigmatizing and, as a result, the victims could be relied on to remain silent. Yadav raped people to silence them far more frequently than murdering them. The women who killed Yadav claimed that he had been raping and abusing local women with impunity for over a decade. They alleged that local police had refused to help his victims or pursue charges because Yadav was bribing them. According to Mehta, Akku Yadav's first crime was a gang rape in 1991. His other crimes included rape, murder, robbery, extortion, home invasion, assault, and criminal intimidation. Before his death, Yadav had been arrested some 14 times. In late 1999, he was detained for a year under the Maharashtra preventive detention law‚ÄîThe Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Slumlords, Boot-leggers, Drug Offenders and Dangerous Persons Act 1981. Yadav allegedly raped so many people that according to residents of the Kasturba Nagar slum, a rape victim lives in every other house there. Yadav allegedly raped over 40 women; his youngest victim being a 10-year-old girl. One person described Yadav as \\"the Gabbar Singh of Kasturba Nagar\\" saying, \\"We stayed mostly indoors when Akku was around\\". Women have said Yadav and his gang would invade homes any time of the day. He sometimes wanted a motorcycle or would grab a mobile phone or extort money. Yadav and his gang members would beat up anyone who resisted them. He murdered a woman named Asha Bai, a daughter of Anjana Bai Borkar, in front of her 16-year-old granddaughter. Borkar was one of five women arrested for Yadav's lynching. Speaking of Yadav, the granddaughter said: \\"We were eating dinner when he came to the front door and pretended to be a friend of my brother. When my mother opened the door, he dragged her out and stabbed her. He then cut off her ears for her earrings and her fingers because he could not get her rings.\\" Yadav had reportedly murdered at least three people and dumped their bodies on local railroad tracks. One woman described how she and her husband were attacked by Yadav. He came to their house at 4:00‚Äì AM‚Äì5:00 AM. Yadav knocked aggressively on their door saying he was a police official, and asked them to open it. Once Yadav entered, he stabbed the husband in the thigh with a knife, locked him in the bathroom and dragged the wife by her hair away to a place where he raped her. Yadav allowed her to return after three or four hours. In January 2004, Yadav was banned from entering Nagpur city. An elderly man named Harichand Khorse, who earned a small amount of money playing a musical instrument called a baja, was beaten violently by Yadav because he was unable to pay 100 rupees. According to neighbors in Kasturba Nagar, Yadav once raped a woman right after her wedding. He also stripped a man naked and burned him with a cigarette, then forced him to dance in front of his 16-year-old daughter. Yadav took a woman named Asho Bhagat and tortured her in front of her daughter and several neighbors by cutting off her breasts. Yadav then sliced Bhagat into pieces on the street, killing her. A man named Avinash Tiwari, one of the neighbors, was horrified by the murder and planned to report Yadav to the police. As a result, Yadav butchered him. Yadav and his men gang-raped a woman named Kalma ten days after she gave birth. After what happened to her, Kalma committed suicide; she burned to death after dousing herself with kerosene and lighting it. Yadav's gang pulled another woman from her house when she was seven months pregnant. They stripped her naked and raped her on the road in public view. Yadav ordered his men to drag girls as young as age 12 to a nearby derelict building to gang rape. Although admitting to being a rape victim in India was taboo, many of Yadav's victims reported his crimes. Instead of arresting him, the police told him who had reported the crime; Yadav would go after them. The police worked with Yadav, protected him and supported him; he gave them bribes and drinks. When a 22-year-old woman reported being raped by Yadav, the police accused her of having an affair with him and sent her away. Several women were turned away by police after being told: \\"You're a loose woman. That's why he raped you.\\" One woman told the police she was gang-raped by Yadav and his associates. The police responded by gang raping the woman themselves. Twenty-five families moved out of Kasturba Nagar. Dalits, however, removed their daughters from schools and kept them locked inside their homes where nobody could see them. Vegetable vendors avoided Kasturba Nagar, so housewives had to go to far away markets to buy food. As long as Yadav only targeted Dalits, police would not interfere. After Yadav raped a 13-year-old girl, he and his men went to the house of a woman named Ratna Dungiri to demand money. The gang smashed her furniture and threatened to murder her family. When a woman named Usha Narayane arrived afterward, she told Dungiri to go to the police. Dungiri refused, so Narayane went to the police herself and filed a complaint. They told Yadav about the complaint. Enraged by her actions, two weeks before he died, Yadav and forty of his associates went to the Narayane house and surrounded it. Yadav carried a bottle of acid and shouted through the door that he would not harm Narayane if she withdrew the complaint. Narayane barricaded the door and refused to surrender. She called the police and although she was told they would come, they never arrived. Meanwhile, Yadav continued to pound on the door and threaten her, saying: \\"I'll throw acid on your face, and you won't be in a position to file any more complaints! If we ever meet you, you don't know what we'll do to you! Gang rape is nothing! You can't imagine what we'll do to you!\\" Narayane shouted back insults, and Yadav responded with descriptions of how he would rape, burn her with acid, and murder her. Yadav and his men tried to break the door down. In response, Narayane turned on a cylinder of gas that the family used for cooking and grabbed a match. She warned that if they broke into the house, she would light the match and blow herself and all of them up. The criminals smelled the gas and left Narayane alone. The neighbors heard about what Narayane had done and were now willing to go after Yadav. Soon there were many angry Dalits on the streets, and they started to pick up sticks and stones. People threw stones at Yadav's associates. His men saw the crowd's mood and fled. The Dalits marched through the slum and celebrated. On 6 August 2004, they went to Yadav's house and burned it down. Yadav now feared for his life and went to the police for protection; they arrested him for his own protection on 7 August 2004. Yadav's mother vacated his house. On 7 August, Yadav was due to appear the city district court and 500 slum residents gathered. As Yadav arrived, one of his men tried to pass him knives wrapped in a blanket; the police failed to notice this. After the women protested, the accomplice was arrested, and Yadav was taken back into custody. He threatened to return and teach every woman in the slum a lesson. On 8 August 2004, a group attacked Yadav while he was being taken before the court; he survived the attack only to be lynched five days later. =Death= Crime scene photo depicting Yadav's blood on the courtroom floor After the police arrested Yadav for his own protection, a bail hearing was scheduled for him on 13 August 2004 in India's Nagpur District Court. Word spread through the adjoining neighborhood that he would be released. The police planned to keep him in custody until everyone had calmed down and then release him. The bail hearing was supposed to take place miles away in the center of Nagpur. Hundreds of women marched from the slums to the courthouse carrying vegetable knives and chili powder, walked into the courtroom and took seats near the front. Yadav walked in and was confident and unrepentant. At about 2:30 to 3:00 PM, when Yadav appeared, he saw a woman he had raped. Yadav mocked her, called her a prostitute and said he would rape her again. The police laughed. The woman started hitting him on the head with her footwear. She told Yadav either she would kill him or he would have to kill her saying, \\"We can't both live on this Earth together. It's you or me.\\" Yadav was then lynched by the mob of 200‚Äì400 women who showed up. He was stabbed at least 70 times, and chili powder and stones were thrown in his face. The chili powder was also thrown into the faces of police officers who guarded him. The police officers, overwhelmed and terrified, fled immediately. One of his alleged victims also hacked off his penis. The lynching occurred in Nagpur District Court No. 7 on the marble floor of the courtroom. As he was being lynched, Yadav was horrified and shouted: \\"Forgive me! I won't do it again!\\". The women passed their knives around and kept stabbing him; each woman agreed to stab Yadav at least once. His blood was on the floors and walls of the courtroom. In 15 minutes, Yadav was dead; he was 32 years old. The mob continued attacking his corpse post-mortem. The women claimed the murder was unplanned. One woman said: \\"We didn‚Äôt have any formal meetings, but it spread by word of mouth that we had to take united action.\\" The State CID had a different version of the lynching. According to senior police sources, the lynching was done by four men with sharp weapons, and the women of Kasturba Nagar claimed responsibility for the lynching to protect those men. None of the women agreed with the police version, and police said both men and women were there when the lynch mob appeared. BBC News reported on the lynching on the day it occurred saying: \\"Initial reports said about 14 women and several children forced their way into the courtroom\\" and stabbed Akku Yadav to death. Aftermath Crowd demanding bail for the accused killers of Yadav The women returned to Kasturba Nagar to tell their husbands and fathers they had killed Yadav. The slum celebrated, and families put on music and danced in the streets. They bought food and handed out fruit to their friends. Five women were arrested immediately but released following demonstrations in the city. Every woman living in the local slum claimed responsibility for the lynching. Usha Narayane was arrested and charged with murder, as were other women. A crowd of 400 women and more than 100 men and children gathered at the courthouse to support the women. The crowd said they would not move until the women were granted bail. In 2012, Narayane was acquitted. Twenty-one others, including six women, were also arrested and released due to lack of evidence. A judge noted a lack of reliable witnesses to the lynching, including unreliable police statements, and cited Yadav's autopsy report, which showed alcohol in his system, as proof that he was receiving preferential treatment from police. Retired high court judge Bhau Vahane publicly defended the women who lynched Yadav, saying: \\"In the circumstances they underwent, they were left with no alternative but to finish Akku. The women repeatedly pleaded with the police for their security, but the police failed to protect them.\\" Vahane also said: \\"If they took law into their hands, it was because the law and law-enforcing agencies had not given them succour.\\" ACP Dalbir Bharati said: \\"There are 200 women who say we did it. The investigating officer found no weapon or blood marks on the five women who were arrested, we found no evidence against these women.\\" Shortly after Yadav's death, Outlook, an Indian magazine, reported that local police spoke indirectly about gang-war rivalries between Yadav's group and a smaller one that allegedly supported the women. According to Outlook, a nephew of Yadav swore revenge for his lynching. In 2014, it was reported that all of the remaining accused in the Akku Yadav murder case were released due to a lack of evidence. In 2011, a documentary about Yadav called Candles in the Wind was released. On the night of December 4, 2013, a nephew of Yadav named Mukri Chhotelal Yadav was stabbed to death at age 30 by two teenagers ages 15 and 17. Mukri allegedly made sexual advances on one of the teenagers' grandmothers and had once threatened her with a knife. The grandmother, who was in her 50s, was teased by Mukri and he often intimidated her. The grandmother told the teens about this and the teens warned Mukri, but he continued to victimize the grandmother. Mukri, like Yadav, also had a history of crime. In 2015, a movie inspired by Yadav called Keechaka was released. It was controversial and women protested against the movie because of the graphic violence against women depicted in it. The movie's director, S.V.B. Chaudhary, defended the film, saying it supports women.

The inaugural running of the event, Joe Ruttman won the pole, while Mike Wallace won the race, the third win of his Truck Series career. A quarter of this race was held under the caution flag, mainly due to Geoff Bodine's violent crash near the start/finish line on lap 57. Background Daytona International Speedway is one of two superspeedways to hold Camping World Truck Series races; the other one is Talladega Superspeedway. Its standard track is a four- turn, superspeedway. Daytona's turns are banked at 31 degrees, and the front stretch (the location of the finish line) is banked at 18 degrees. Race summary=Start= Joe Ruttman, driving the No. 18 for Bobby Hamilton Racing, was on the pole. He would lead the field to the green flag and led the first lap before Lyndon Amick briefly took the lead for two laps. The lead would then switch between Andy Houston, Mike Wallace, and Bobby Hamilton before the first caution came out for a crash in Turn 2, which began when Geoff Bodine spun after making contact by Amick. Defending Truck champion Jack Sprague, Steve Grissom, Rick Crawford, and Bryan Reffner were also involved. The race restarted, and the lead was taken by a couple more drivers before the second caution came out when Mike Cope cut a tire and spun in turn 4. At the restart, Terry Cook was the leader but Houston, Wallace, and Hamilton again swapped the lead. Wallace had a tire go flat and had to make a pit stop. That same lap, Kurt Busch made contact with Hamilton and spun him out in the tri- oval, collecting Ruttman, Randy Renfrow, Randy Tolsma, and Houston. Renfrow almost flipped over. Wallace managed to stay on the lead lap. The race restarted on Lap 43, and went green until lap 50 when Jimmy Kitchens spun on the backstretch. Most of the leaders made pit stops except for Rob Morgan, who stayed out. =Lap 57 crash= On the restart, Rob Morgan led but was quickly overtaken by Mike Wallace, and Morgan began slipping back. On lap 56, rookie Kurt Busch, in his Truck series debut, was racing three-wide with Geoff Bodine. As he dove underneath Bodine on lap 56, Busch turned Morgan, causing him to spin down to the flat apron and then veer back up the banking. His right-front tire contacted Bodine's left-front tire, catapulting Bodine into the catch-fence at a speed of nearly . Upon impact, Bodine's fuel tank exploded and the truck flipped over nine times extremely hard across the track before coming to rest on its roof in turn 1. The truck, now little more than a crushed, mangled roll cage, was struck on the driver's side by Ryan McGlynn, whose truck was damaged from the contact and retired later in the race. Instantly in the announcer's reactions, the crash was described as similar to Richard Petty's rollover crash in the 1988 Daytona 500 at a similar portion of the track. The red flag was waved as the track was blocked with debris and rescue workers rushed to Bodine's aid. The crash was so violent that the impact ripped the engine out of the truck, found in turn two from where Bodine's truck came to rest on its lid. The crash collected 12 more trucks. Upon seeing the crash, the fans went silent and called for paramedics to the grandstands. Just 16 minutes later, they and the announcers hardly spoke because they were worried that Bodine was fatally injured. However, the fans applauded when they heard the announcers say that Bodine was seen talking to medical crews and that he was moving around while he was being taken to the ambulance. Bodine had suffered a broken jaw, wrist, shoulder, and a concussion. After several nights of medical treatment at the nearby Halifax Medical Center, Bodine was in stable condition and eventually returned to racing a month later. Fellow driver Jimmy Kitchens was also hospitalized, but he, however, did not suffer any major injuries. After 55 minutes under the red flag (including slow caution periods before and after it waved), the race restarted. TV coverage moved to ESPN2 due to the length of the red flag period. =Finish= On the final lap, Andy Houston jumped to the lead on a last-lap restart but got loose in turn 3 and Mike Wallace slipped by to take the first truck victory at Daytona as Busch, after barely avoiding Bodine's truck in the lap 57 crash, finished second.

Created by writer Geoff Johns and artist Shane Davis, the character first appears in Final Crisis: Rage of the Red Lanterns #1 (December 2008). Publication history Created by writer Geoff Johns and Shane Davis, she made her first appearance in Final Crisis: Rage of the Red Lanterns #1, and has since featured prominently in several other Green Lantern related titles, especially in the Green Lantern: New Guardians series. She started out as a ruthless, feral villain but over time has gained control of her powers and become more of an anti-hero, occasionally siding with heroes such as the Green Lanterns. She is one of the foremost members of the Red Lantern Corps. She is an alien from the planet Havania who was inducted into the Red Lanterns after being abused and tortured by members of the Sinestro Corps during the Sinestro Corps War. Her race have large feathered wings, but as part of the torture Bleez' wings were cut off, when she became a Red Lantern she regrew the bone part of her wings. In the rebooted DC Comics universe of 2011's \\"The New 52\\", Bleez joined representatives of the seven Lantern Corps to form \\"The New Guardians\\", led by White Lantern Kyle Rayner. At times, Bleez has opposed Red Lantern Corps leader Atrocitus, and has even fought him for control of the Corps. In spite of this, she is a loyal member of the Red Lanterns, and usually serves as one of Atrocitus' chief enforcers. Fictional character biography=Origin= Bleez before the Red Lanterns, as depicted in Blackest Night: Tales of the Corps #2 (2009) Bleez was once a princess on the planet Havania, renowned for her great beauty. Many men sought her hand, but she rejected them all, often in an extremely rude and abrasive manner. Two of her suitors, especially humiliated, sought out a Sinestro Corpsman and tempted him with stories of Bleez's beauty. He went to Havania, where he murdered Bleez's mother and captured Bleez, taking her to Ranx the Sentient City. For some time during the events of the Sinestro Corps War, Bleez was raped and tortured by members of the Sinestro Corps, but managed to escape when Ranx came under attack during the Battle of Mogo. The Sinestro Corpsman who had originally abducted her pursued and caught her, and forced her to kiss him. As she was being pushed to her limits by this final indignity, a red ring found Bleez and inducted her into the Red Lantern Corps. Her blood was transformed into burning plasma, and she vomited it into the Corpsman's throat. Before he could recover, she killed him in a blind fury. Later, she was among the strike force that ambushed the Green Lanterns transporting Sinestro back to Korugar for execution. =Blackest Night= During the Blackest Night, Bleez and the Red Lantern Corps fought alongside the other Corps against the Black Lantern Anti-Monitor. =Brightest Day= During the Brightest Day, Guy Gardner and Ganthet made a pact with Atrocitus to search for the Emotional Entities in response to a prophecy seen by Gardner. Gardner was sent to patrol the Unknown Sectors for the Entities, and Atrocitus sent Bleez to \\"help\\" him. When Gardner attempted to have himself purified of the red energy of Odym, Bleez stopped him. =The New 52= In September 2011, \\"The New 52\\" rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Bleez was tasked with finding and recovering a red power ring that had mysteriously abandoned its bearer.Green LanternNew Guardians #1 (Sept 2011) This assignment led her to confront Green Lantern Kyle Rayner, who had been chosen by the wayward ring as its new bearer. Subsequently, Bleez, along with representatives of the other Lantern Corps (including Arkillo, Munk, Glomulus, Fatality, and Saint Walker) tracked Rayner to Oa, intending to take back the stolen Red Lantern ring.Green LanternNew Guardians #2 (Oct 2011) When they arrived on Oa, they became embroiled in a battle with the Guardians of the Universe, during which the Orange Lantern Corps attacked the Oan Citadel.Green LanternNew Guardians #3-#4 (Nov-Dec 2011) As the battle escalated, Rayner ordered Munk of the Indigo Tribe to teleport the assembled Corps members away from Oa. They escaped to the planet of Okaara. When Saint Walker attempted to heal her with his blue power ring, Bleez fled and returned to Ysmault to report on what she had learned.Green LanternNew Guardians #4 (Dec 2011) When she arrived on Ysmault, she was unable to communicate her findings to Atrocitus, due to the immense rage clouding her mind. Frustrated, Atrocitus threw her into the Blood Ocean of Ysmault, an act that restored not only her memories, but also her self-control, thus enabling her to fully be in control of her actions and behaviour. She later rejoined the other New Guardians as they fought the Archangel Invictus at the Orrery.Green LanternNew Guardians #7 (March 2012) After Rayner convinced Invictus to let them go in exchange for assassinating Larfleeze, Bleez accompanied Rayner to Earth so that he could recharge his ring, which brought them into a brief conflict with Blue Beetle and an alien bounty hunter.Blue Beetle vol 6 #9 (April 2012) Afterwards, she returned to Ysmault on unspecified business, only to be brought back to the team by Munk on Rayner's orders.Green LanternNew Guardians #11 (July 2012) She joined with the rest of the Guardians to defeat Larfleeze and Invictus, and was present when Sayd admitted to having stolen the six power rings in order to help Rayner learn to master the emotional spectrum so that he could save Ganthet. Like the other New Guardians, Bleez refused to have anything more to do with a team built on deceit and murder, and once again departed for Ysmault.Green LanternNew Guardians #12 (Aug 2012) Red Lanterns In the aftermath of the War of the Green Lanterns and the death of the rogue Guardian Krona, Atrocitus felt his rage dimming, and feared that he might be losing control of his Corps.Red Lanterns #1 (Sept 2011) He decided to uplift one of his Red Lanterns, making them almost his equal. He chose Bleez as his new second-in-command, and hurled her into the Blood Ocean in order to restore her intellect and memories. After she emerged from the ocean, he took her back to her home planet of Havania, where she confronted Count Liib and Baron Ghazz, the men who had been responsible for her kidnapping and torture by the Sinestro Corps. After killing Ghazz, she and Atrocitus disagreed over Liib's fate. Bleez wanted to leave him alive and hunt him down later, but Atrocitus, uninterested in her 'subtleties', simply killed him outright.Red Lanterns #3 (Nov 2011) Despite this initial clash, events seemed to progress smoothly. Bleez was able to regain some measure of control over the Red Lanterns, but Atrocitus came to believe that she was manipulating the Corps for her own ends. When Atrocitus decided to immerse three more Red Lanterns in the Blood Ocean to keep Bleez in check, she attempted to dissuade him, noting that the trauma of regaining their memories might drive them insane.Red Lanterns #4 (Dec 2011) After Krona's body disappeared from Ysmault, Atrocitus attacked Bleez, believing her to be responsible. She held her own against him, causing the other Red Lanterns to realize that Atrocitus was losing his rage and his focus.Red Lanterns #6 (February 2012) Bleez subsequently seized control of the Corps, leading them on a galaxy-wide hunt for Sinestro, whom she held ultimately responsible for her condition.Red Lanterns #7 (March 2012) After the Red Lantern central power battery was poisoned by Abysmus, Bleez returned to Ysmault with her Red Lanterns, briefly coming into conflict with Atrocitus, who had been drawn back by the dying battery. After Atrocitus reasserted his leadership over the Corps, Bleez decided to confront the Star Sapphires, whom she believed to be responsible for the battery's destruction.Red Lanterns #9 (May 2012) Bleez led a squadron of Red Lanterns, including Rankorr, Zilius Zox, and Ratchet, to Zamaron to confront the Sapphires, only to be defeated and captured by them.Red Lanterns #11 (July 2012) The Star Sapphire Fatality attempted to convert Bleez into a Star Sapphire, using her violet ring to envelop Bleez in a crystalline dome. Bleez, in turn, attempted to poison Fatality with some of her own blood, in an effort to make her a Red Lantern. Fatality tried to make Bleez see that she could be redeemed by the violet light of love. Under the influence of the crystal, Bleez finally admitted that all her acts of vengeance had not brought her peace, and nearly accepted a violet ring from Fatality.Red Lanterns #11 (July 2012) However, before she could take the ring, Atrocitus killed Abysmus and restored the central battery, whereupon Bleez's ring returned to full strength. She rejected the Star Sapphires and returned to Ysmault with her Red Lanterns.Red Lanterns #12 (August 2012) During the events of Rise of the Third Army, Bleez was one of the first Red Lanterns to encounter the Third Army, when she and several other Reds were attacked by Third Army drones on the planet of Arhtky.Red Lanterns #13 While Atrocitus rallied the rest of the Corps to confront the Guardians and the First Lantern, he ordered Rankorr to return to Earth and kill Baxter, the man who was indirectly responsible for his transformation into a Red Lantern. Bleez chose to accompany Rankorr, to ensure that the deed was done properly. Rankorr quickly found Baxter, but hesitated to kill him.Red Lanterns #14 Bleez responded by poisoning Baxter with her napalm blood, which Rankorr interpreted as her attempt to prove that she was still worthy of being a Red Lantern after nearly accepting a Star Sapphire ring from Fatality. Bleez admitted that she had indeed been tempted by Fatality's offer, and that a part of her longed to be something other than a Red Lantern, but that there was no other path for her, or for him. She then attempted to seduce Rankorr so that she could obtain his blood, which would allow her to create light constructs. Rankorr rejected her and escaped, attempting to live life as a human.Red Lanterns #15 Bleez tracked him down and again attempted to take his blood, but she was interrupted by Atrocitus, who issued an order for all Red Lanterns to hunt down and kill him, as he now deemed himself responsible for the destruction of his homeworld. She joined the rest of the Corps in attacking Atrocitus, during which he finally experienced the true depth of his Corps' rage. Declaring himself 'reborn', Atrocitus led the Red Lanterns to Oa to destroy the Guardians for good.Red Lanterns #19 They arrived at the climax of the battle with Volthoom, and aided in his defeat. In the aftermath of the battle, Bleez led the Red Lanterns back to Ysmault, where they found the Four Inversions attempting to destroy the central power battery. Their dark magic nearly defeated the assembled Lanterns, but Bleez was able to withstand their sorcery, and they fled. Skallox suggested that she ought to assume leadership of the Corps, but before she could decide one way or the other, Atrocitus returned to the planet, and she re-pledged her loyalty to him.Red Lanterns #20 =DC Rebirth= In \\"DC Rebirth\\", Bleez was a Red Lantern that accompanied Atrocitus and the Red Lantern Corps to Earth, where the Hell Tower had taken root. There the Red Dawn would begin, terraforming Earth into a new Red Lantern homeworld to save them from extinction. Upon arrival, she was sent by Atrocitus to attack Simon Baz and Jessica Cruz, keeping them from destroying the Hell Tower. After engaging, she quickly defeated Jessica and almost killed Simon, though Jessica blasted her with a power blast. An enraged Bleez blasted Jessica through a building, and proceeded to continue killing Simon. However Simon managed to use his willpower to cure her of the rage. She was horrified by her deeds and was about to relapse into rage to punish herself when Simon managed to convince her to begin a new life. However, a recovered Jessica attacked her, and she flew off in a rage, hiding from both the Red Lantern Corps and the Green Lantern Corps. Powers and abilities Bleez wears a red power ring, from which she derives all of her abilities. The ring channels the red light of rage, and grants her most of the same abilities as other power rings, including flight, enhanced strength, and forcefield generation. The ring has also transformed her blood into a fiery, highly corrosive fluid, referred to as 'napalm' by the Red Lanterns. She can regurgitate this napalm as an offensive weapon; it is capable of eating through nearly any known material, destroying Black Lanterns faster than they can regenerate, and corrupting other power rings beyond repair. Since the ring has replaced her heart, she cannot remove it without risking death by cardiac arrest. She is also vulnerable to blue and violet light, which can reverse the effects of a red ring. Due to being immersed in the Blood Ocean of Ysmault, she has regained her intellect and her memories, unlike many of the other Red Lanterns.

Definitions Œõ is a complete Noetherian local ring with residue field k, and C is the category of local Artinian Œõ-algebras (meaning in particular that as modules over Œõ they are finitely generated and Artinian) with residue field k. A small extension in C is a morphism Y‚ÜíZ in C that is surjective with kernel a 1-dimensional vector space over k. A functor is called representable if it is of the form hX where hX(Y)=hom(X,Y) for some X, and is called pro- representable if it is of the form Y‚Üílim hom(Xi,Y) for a filtered direct limit over i in some filtered ordered set. A morphism of functors F‚ÜíG from C to sets is called smooth if whenever Y‚ÜíZ is an epimorphism of C, the map from F(Y) to F(Z)√óG(Z)G(Y) is surjective. This definition is closely related to the notion of a formally smooth morphism of schemes. If in addition the map between the tangent spaces of F and G is an isomorphism, then F is called a hull of G. Grothendieck's theorem showed that a functor from the category C of Artinian algebras to sets is pro-representable if and only if it preserves all finite limits. This condition is equivalent to asking that the functor preserves pullbacks and the final object. In fact Grothendieck's theorem applies not only to the category C of Artinian algebras, but to any category with finite limits whose objects are Artinian. By taking the projective limit of the pro-representable functor in the larger category of linearly topologized local rings, one obtains a complete linearly topologized local ring representing the functor. Schlessinger's representation theorem One difficulty in applying Grothendieck's theorem is that it can be hard to check that a functor preserves all pullbacks. Schlessinger showed that it is sufficient to check that the functor preserves pullbacks of a special form, which is often easier to check. Schlessinger's theorem also gives conditions under which the functor has a hull, even if it is not representable. Schessinger's theorem gives conditions for a set-valued functor F on C to be representable by a complete local Œõ-algebra R with maximal ideal m such that R/mn is in C for all n. Schlessinger's theorem states that a functor from C to sets with F(k) a 1-element set is representable by a complete Noetherian local algebra if it has the following properties, and has a hull if it has the first three properties: *H1: The map F(Y√óXZ)‚ÜíF(Y)√óF(X)F(Z) is surjective whenever Z‚ÜíX is a small extension in C and Y‚ÜíX is some morphism in C. *H2: The map in H1 is a bijection whenever Z‚ÜíX is the small extension k[x]/(x2)‚Üík. *H3: The tangent space of F is a finite-dimensional vector space over k. *H4: The map in H1 is a bijection whenever Y=Z is a small extension of X and the maps from Y and Z to X are the same.

Looney Tunes theatrical animated short directed by Rudy Larriva. The short was released on March 12, 1966, and stars Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. Plot Clippety Clobbered begins with Wile E. Coyote waiting at his mailbox. He looks up to see a U.S. Mail helicopter which drops a big box with a parachute attached to it. As Wile E. holds out his arms to catch the box, Road Runner runs by and taunts him long enough so that he forgets about the descending package which lands on top of his head. After some more taunting from Road Runner which causes his backside to be pricked by a cactus, Wile E. opens his package to reveal a chemistry set. Wile E. wastes no time as he pours red liquid back and forth between two beakers until it vanishes completely. He pours the invisible liquid into a bucket marked \\"Invisible Paint\\", then paints himself invisible with it (he is outlined for the viewers to keep track of his presence). Wile E. gets into position to catch Road Runner near the side of a cliff, but the Road Runner runs into him and knocks him off. For good measure, the Road Runner paints a giant boulder and pushes it off the cliff; it lands on top of the unsuspecting Coyote. For his second and final try with the invisible paint, Wile E. builds a brick wall and quickly paints it upon seeing the Road Runner coming towards him. Watching from behind a boulder, he is stunned when Road Runner runs right through the invisible wall. The Coyote attempts to do the same, but smashes headfirst into the wall. As he attempts to get up, a brick falls on top of his head and knocks him out. Back at his chemistry lab, Wile E. adds a chemical to a beaker filled with blue liquid, creating a bounceable substance. After a successful test, Wile E. covers himself entirely with the blue liquid, forming a bounceable rubber suit. Road Runner comes down the road and passes Wile E. who runs towards an opposite wall and bounces off of it, moving towards his prey. However, Road Runner ducks before he can be caught, sending Wile E. bouncing uncontrollably off rocks, cliffsides and down into a canyon. He bounces off the ground and high into the air to get back up to the top of the canyon, but part of the rubber suit gets caught on a branch and the whole thing tears off the Coyote. Relieved to be rid of the bounce liquid but then remembering that he is still in midair, he plummets to the ground on his face. Returning to the chemistry set, Wile E. reads about \\"Hand Jets\\" from a book called Space Science. Wile E. creates his own hand jet by mixing an orange chemical and pouring it into a spray can like container. A quick test is successful, so off he goes after Road Runner with the hand jet. After crashing into an \\"Acme Garment Co.\\" truck and exiting out its back, he sees the Road Runner head into a train tunnel and follows him in. Suddenly, he sees what appears to be a train headlight coming towards him; Wile E. turns around to escape but sees that it's the Road Runner wearing a coal miner's hat. Wile E. turns around and resumes his chase with Road Runner who also turns back the other way. They enter the tunnel again and Wile E. sees another approaching headlight. Refusing to be tricked by Road Runner again, Wile E. continues full speed ahead... and smashes into a real train! Plastered to the front of the train, the dismayed Coyote looks towards the camera and the shot zooms into his eyes. Inside, the Road Runner speeds toward the audience, and waves goodbye before speeding off into the distance. Production The train tunnel gag is recycled from earlier Bugs Bunny cartoons, Hare-Less Wolf (1958) and Bill of Hare (1962). Release Clippety Clobbered was released March 12, 1966.

He was known primarily for the spy missions he carried out in Puerto Rico and Cuba prior to the start of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Early life Whitney was born in Glen Hope, Pennsylvania on December 25, 1866. The son of a clergyman and Union Army veteran of the American Civil War, he graduated from Dickinson Seminary and passed a competitive examination for appointment to the United States Military Academy in 1888. He graduated number 11 of 62 in the class of 1892, and was the class president for all four of his years at West Point. Start of career Whitney was commissioned in the 4th Field Artillery. He was on special duty at the War Department from 1896 to 1898. In 1898, he was appointed Military Attach√© to the American legation in Buenos Aires, and soon afterwards agreed to undertake a covert mission for the Secretary of War in anticipation of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Whitney disguised himself as an English sailor, evaded capture by Spanish authorities, and made a military reconnaissance of Puerto Rico and Cuba, thereby gaining intelligence upon which General Nelson A. Miles based the war's Puerto Rican Campaign, and General William Rufus Shafter based his campaign in Cuba. In 1918, Whitney was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for heroism in carrying out this spy mission. Whitney served throughout the war as an assistant adjutant on the Miles's staff; after the war he was appointed as an aide-de-camp to Miles, and accompanied him on his around the world tour from 1902 to 1903. After the war, Whitney served in the Philippines; commanded the Presidio of San Francisco and Fort Point, San Francisco during the Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition; and served on the Mexican border during the Pancho Villa Expedition. World War I During World War I, Whitney commanded the 63rd Field Artillery Brigade and was promoted to temporary brigadier general. He was later appointed a member of the staff of the American Expeditionary Forces headquarters, and was Chief of Staff for the Military District of Paris. Whitney retired as a colonel in 1920, and in 1930 he was promoted to brigadier general on the retired list as the result of a federal law which allowed World War I general officers to retire at the highest rank they had held. Retirement and death After the war, Whitney lived in California, where he was the president of a real estate finance company. He subsequently moved to New York City. Whitney died Madison, New Jersey on April 2, 1949. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, Section 3, Site 1920 EH. Awards In addition to the Distinguished Service Cross, Whitney received the Army Distinguished Service Medal, French Legion of Honor (Officer), Romanian Order of the Crown (Commander), and Montenegro's Order of Prince Danilo I (Commander). Family In 1897, Whitney married Ellen Wadsworth Closson; they were the parents of two children, Julie and Henry Wadsworth Whitney (1907‚Äì1958). Henry W.

It is situated in Lauriston, midway between the Grassmarket and Tollcross, on the edge of Edinburgh‚Äôs historic Old Town. The church building was opened in 1860 and is a category A listed building. History=Founding= The church had its beginnings when Bishop James Gillis, Vicar Apostolic of the Eastern District invited the Society of Jesus to come to Edinburgh and set up a parish close to the city centre. The architect of the church was a Jesuit priest, Fr. Richard Vaughan SJ, who was also uncle of Bernard Vaughan, a notable Jesuit preacher and writer. Initially, while the church was being built, Mass was celebrated in a temporary chapel on Hunter's Close in the Grassmarket part of the city. The first Mass was on 31 July 1859 by Albany James Christie SJ. The first Mass in the newly constructed Sacred Heart Church was celebrated on 8 July 1860: Bishop Gillis preached at the Mass and the celebrant was the then Jesuit provincial, a Fr. Thomas Seed SJ.Sacred Heart Edinburgh Brief History =Twentieth Century= Over the years, the church was restored and renovated on numerous occasions. In 1907, the organ was installed and was modified in 1963 and 1974. In 1957, a mural was painted in the church above the altar.

The school, founded in Manhattan's Lower East Side in 1896, provided immigrant families of the day with a day-care option to allow both parents to seek employment and thus bolstered the economy of the region. In recognition of her efforts, local residents came to call Curry \\"The Little Missionary\\", and the school was formally renamed as The Little Missionary's Day Nursery on her retirement. The school remains open to the present day. It is the oldest continuously operated non-denominational pre- school in New York City. The nursery was renamed Little Missionary's DayNursery/Sara Curry Preschool in 2005, in order to avoid the image of a sectarian or religious school and to invoke the name of the founder. The school has always been non-sectarian and catered to working families from all over the world. Curry was born in Brookhaven, New York' and was orphaned around age ten. She moved to Utica with two of her siblings and worked in a cap factory. She moved to New York City in her twenties and was saddened by the plight of young children of who were left to wander in the streets in Manhattan's Lower East Side or were tied to balconies while their parents worked in factories. She began her work by taking in children to her apartment on Avenue C around 1896. By 1901, she had gained support from generous donors and was able to secure the building at 93 St. Marks Place. Curry was able to take care of 200 children a day at the nursery, and the work included feeding and educating them, as well as providing cooking classes for parents, and holding regular sobriety meetings. She made friends with influential people who helped fund the nursery, including Frederick Cooper Hewitt, Louis Rolston, Alexander Morgan, and Mrs. John D. Rockefeller. After her death in 1940, the nursery declined, and at one point the building was on the brink of being sold. Since 2001, the nursery has been on a path of consistent growth, and on October 5, 2013, St. Marks Place between Avenue A and First Avenue was co- named Sara Curry Way. The Sara Curry Humanitarian Award has been presented annually since 2004. This award is given to individuals who exemplify the qualities of Sara Curry: \\\\- A vision of a better future for others \\\\- Dedication to the well being of the community \\\\- Selfless commitment to giving \\\\- Energy and passion to overcome obstacles Recipients of the award include Gloria Steinem, Jennifer Clement, Michael Rosen, Lily Tomlin, Senator Thomas K Duane, Natasha Weiss, Anne Weisberg, Dr. David Ores, Margarita L√≥pez, Dan Zanes, Nilaja Sun, Dr. Michel Cohen, Mary Spink, Michael Rosen and Vallejo Gantner.

It is distributed with air gaps to help condense its magnetic field to minimize core losses. Its composition is made from approximately 79% nickel, 17% iron, and 4% molybdenum. It maintains the lowest core losses out of all the magnetic powdered cores used. Its permeability can range from 14 to 550. (See permeabilities of common materials.) Toroidal powder cores are used in the development of a subgroup of microelectronics known as inductors, transformers and electronic filters. An MPP core possesses many positive magnetic qualities which makes it more optimal to use in the creation of such devices. A few of its properties include: low eddy current losses and hysteresis, low permeability changes in high temperatures, high Curie temperature, high electrical resistivity at operating frequency and exemplary inductive stability under both AC and DC currents. MPP cores are primarily used in inductors that require a core to have higher saturation point while maintaining other valuable magnetic properties. A standard MPP core saturates at around 0.75 Tesla. A ferrite core saturates at around 0.45 Tesla. Molypermalloy powder cores are commonly used in the making of: flyback transformers, resonant circuits, quartz filters, loading coils, choke coils, pulse transformers, and other industrial and military circuits.McLyman, Colonel William T. Transformer and Inductor Design Handbook, Third Edition. Dekker, February 18, 2009. Molybdenum permalloy powder is made by grinding hot-rolled and embrittled cast ingots; then, the alloy is insulated and screened to a fineness of 120 mesh for use in audio frequency applications, and 400 mesh for use at high frequencies.Beaty, Wayne H. and Fink, Donald G. Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers. McGraw- Hill, Inc., October 24, 1991. MPP was developed into cores by the Western Electric Company and the Bell Telephone Laboratory (formerly known as AT&T;) in the early 1940s. It has made its largest impact in the power conversion field by permitting increased frequency, resulting in weight reduction and increased compactness in computer systems.McLyman, Colonel William T. High Reliability Magnetic Devices: Design & Fabrication. Dekker, February 18, 2009. As frequency increases, desired permeability decreases. Thus, when using frequencies higher than 500 kHz MPP cores are often replaced by ferrite cores.Wohlfarth, E.P. Ferro-Magnetic Materials: A Handbook on the Properties of Magnetically Ordered Substances, Volume 2. Elsevier Science B.V., 1980. Disadvantages of MPP cores are: High manufacturing costs per unit, are limited to a toroidal shape and have maximum operating frequency of around 1 MHz.

It lies south of the Upper Mur valley in the Styria near its border with Carinthia. The Lavant, a left tributary of the Drau, has its source on the southern slopes of the mountain. Its name is not derived, as popularly supposed, from the Swiss pine trees (known in German as Zirben) that dominate the woods in places, but from the Slovenian word zirbiza, that can be translated as \\"red mountain pasture\\", which is a reference to the red-petalled alpenrose (Rhododendron ferrugineum) that is common hereabouts. In the local region this rhododendron plant is also known as Almrausch (\\"alp delirium\\"), perhaps an indication of the toxicity of the plants. The summit block of the Zirbitzkogel is formed of crystalline rock; slate, gneisses and granites predominating. In spite of its comparatively low height it exhibits a definite high mountain character. Its relief was formed by ice age glaciers and subsequent slope movements. In the very spring-rich region are several tarns, such as the two Winterleitenseen. Dense spruce forests cover the slopes up to the subalpine zone before being succeeded by scattered stands of spruce, larch and Swiss pine (Swiss pine-larch forest). In the summit area a ragged sedge grassland dominates, interspersed with almost level plateaus. The summit became well known to ornithologists as a breeding habitat for the dotterel, a few pairs of which bred almost all year round until 1995. Thereafter no more broods were sighted, although individual migrants and roosting birds were observed. Wind-exposed spots are dominated by Alpine Azalea and various lichens. The area is also known to butterfly researchers for several very rare species, including the endemite, Elophos zirbitzensis. The touristically well developed Zirbitzkogel is a very popular hiking and touring region. At its summit is the Zirbitzkogelhaus, other huts lie along the routes of ascent. Suitable starting points for climbing the Zirbitzkogel are St. Anna and St. Wolfgang bei Obdach on the northern side and Neumarkt on the southern side. The Zirbitzkogel region was incorporated into the Natura 2000 regions and has been designated a European protected area since May 2006.

Initially gaining recognition for his Jewish outreach programs aimed at Phish concertgoers, Skaist taught in yeshivot in New York and Israel for several years before deciding to pursue a music career. His debut studio album, Protocols, was released in 2006 by the Jewish Music Group label.  History =Early life= Shmuel Skaist was born on December 8, 1964 to a devoutly Orthodox family in Brooklyn, New York's Crown Heights neighborhood. He is descended from a long line of prominent rabbis. Although forbidden from listening to secular music, Skaist heard his first secular song, \\"Dream Weaver\\" by Gary Wright, at age 12, and subsequently began listening to bands like The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, and Led Zeppelin. As a teenager growing up in Queens and Baltimore, he hung out at arcades and pool halls. He studied at the Sh'or Yoshuv Yeshiva, where he became close with the rosh yeshiva, Rabbi Shlomo Freifeld. After his ordination, he became a rebbe at a yeshiva high school in New York, where he would often get his student's attention by playing his guitar in class. He also oversaw youth outreach programs for the Orthodox Union , taught at Stern College for Women, and recorded a Jewish-themed grunge album. =Shabbat Tent and Gefiltefish= Skaist later relocated to Israel, where he taught philosophy at Bar-Ilan University and gave weekly performances at Mike's Place in Jerusalem. During this time, one of his students introduced him to the band Phish and, after initially being unimpressed, he ultimately became a fan. He later met fellow Phish fan and concert promoter Adam Weinberg and, in 1998, the two founded Gefiltefish, an outreach organization traveling to stops on Phish tours to provide community and spiritual advice to disaffiliated Jews in attendance. The following year, Skaist and Weinberg created the similarly-minded Shabbat Tents, which hosted Shabbat prayers and meals for people at the tour stops. This project received a boost in publicity after Jewish reggae singer Matisyahu requested a Shabbat Tent at a festival he was headlining. Gefiltefish and Shabbat Tents have been present at several Phish festivals including Camp Oswego, Coventry, and Festival 8, as well as venues like the Empire Polo Club and Radio City Music Hall. =Music career= Moving back to New York, Skaist became the head of Yeshiva @ IDT, a yeshiva program run by the IDT Corporation in Newark, New Jersey. In 2005, Skaist released an album called Some People Think That I Am Damned through My Friend Steve Records. Looking to pursue his music career, Skaist found an open mic night at East Village's SideWalk Cafe via Google search. Receiving a positive response despite his blatantly rabbinic appearance, he began performing there regularly and developed a following. He caught the attention of the non-profit Jewish Music Group label, who released his debut album Protocols on September 30, 2006. A month later, Skaist released another album, also through Jewish Music Group, called B'yameinu, which featured more traditional Hasidic songs. In 2010, he was featured in the music video for The Groggers' song \\"Eishes Chayil\\". Skaist performed at the 2014 New York Antifolk Festival alongside artists like Hamell on Trial and Anne Husick of Band of Susans. In 2016 he debuted a new original song to his YouTube channel entitled \\"I Want To Know\\", about his feelings on turning 50. Personal life Skaist lives in New York with his wife and six children.

Formed in 2008 by lead singer Yishai Romanoff and guitarist Mike Wagner, they released their debut album, Better Get Ready (2009), on Shemspeed Records, followed in 2011 by This World is Nothing. They were prominently featured in the 2012 documentary Punk Jews.  Band history  Moshiach Oi! was started in 2008 by singer/guitarist Yishai Romanoff, who had sought to reconcile his then-recently renewed Jewish faith with the punk rock music he had loved as a teenager. Initially a solo act, Romanoff eventually brought in his friend Mike Wagner, as well as bassist Mitchell \\"Mordechai\\" Harrison and drummer Paul \\"Pesach\\" Alpert, to complete the band. The band's name is derived from a combination Moshiach, the Jewish name for the Messiah; oy vey, a Yiddish expression conveying exasperation and dismay; and Oi!, a British working-class genre of punk music. The group's debut album, Better Get Ready, produced by Wagner and mastered by veteran punk producer Don Fury, was released by Shemspeed Records and the band's own Shabasa Records label on August 25, 2009. A second album, This World is Nothing, was released two years later just on Shabasa, accompanied by the single and music video \\"Got Nothing On Me\\". The band was prominently featured in the 2012 documentary Punk Jews. A third album, Rock Rabeinu, was released on August 10, 2017.  Musical style  Moshiach Oi's music combines the sound of traditional hardcore punk with lyrics that promote Jewish ideals and values. While the music is inspired by Romanoff's teenage love of punk bands like Left√∂ver Crack and F-Minus, lyrical topics include blessing God, Shabbat, Torah study, idolatry, Moshiach, and Rebbe Nachman of Breslov. Patrick Aleph of the website Jewcy summarized Better Get Ready as \\"a blistering punk rock siddurim that effortlessly ties together Black Flag and Rambam, 7 Seconds and the Rebbe, The Casualties and the Kabballists.\\"  Shabasa Records  All of Moshiach Oi!'s music has been distributed through their self-owned independent label Shabasa Records.

She is a multiple-time Tunisian record holder in the pole vault, and a gold medalist at the 2007 All-Africa Games in Algiers, Algeria. She also holds a dual citizenship, and chose to represent her father's birthplace Tunisia at numerous sporting events, including the Olympic games. Athletic career Born in Sidney, Montana to a Tunisian father and a French mother, Ben Youssef started out her athletic career in pole vault at the age of fourteen. She excelled at her sport and academics throughout her years at Sidney High School, where she became a three-time Class A state champion, and posted a personal record of 12 feet and 7.5 inches (3.84 metres). Coming out of high school in 2000, Ben Youssef attended Stanford University in Stanford, California on a full academic and sport scholarship. She majored in human biology, minored in archaeology, and competed for the University's track and field team as a member of Stanford Cardinal. After completing her undergraduate degree in 2004, Ben Youssef also earned a master's degree of medical anthropology from the University. Since graduating from Stanford University in 2005, Ben Youssef continued to compete for pole vault this time, as a member of the Tunisian national track and field team. In 2007, she reached her breakthrough season by winning gold medals at the Pan Arab Games in Cairo, Egypt, and at the All-Africa Games in Algiers, Algeria, with a height of 3.80 and 3.85 metres, respectively. The following year, Ben Youssef improved her performance at the African Championships in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, when she cleared 4.00 metres to clinch another career gold medal. She also set a national record, and vaulted a personal best of 4.30 metres at an athletics meet in Los Gatos, California, earning her a spot on the Tunisian team for the Olympics. At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Ben Youssef successfully cleared a height of 4.00 metres in the women's pole vault. Unfortunately, she fell short in her bid for the final, as she placed thirty-second overall in the qualifying rounds, tying her position with Finland's Vanessa Vandy. Shortly after the Olympics, Ben Youssef announced her retirement from pole vault to pursue her studies at the University of Washington School of Medicine at Montana State University in Bozeman. She is now a 4th year resident at Highland Hospital in Oakland, California.

Thompson, was an American topographer, geologist, explorer, educator and Civil War veteran. Often called \\"The Professor\\" or simply \\"Prof\\", Thompson is perhaps best known for being second in command of John Wesley Powell's Second Geographical Expedition (1871‚Äì1875), a federally funded scientific expedition that retraced the route of Powell's original expedition in order to further explore and map the drainages and canyons of the Green and Colorado Rivers in what is now southern Utah and northern Arizona. Thompson's diary of the expedition was originally published in the Utah Historical Quarterly in 1939. Through his work on the Powell expeditions and later as a geographer at the U.S. Geological Survey, he was responsible for naming many geographic locations in the Western United States. Thompson is also known for being a founding member of the National Geographic Society. Early life and education Thompson was born on September 24, 1839, in Stoddard, New Hampshire. Later, his family moved to Southborough, Worcester, Massachusetts (1848‚Äì1856), where he attended school. Thompson enjoyed mathematics and science. He attended Wheaton College in Illinois from 1857 to 1861, where he met John Wesley Powell. After graduation, he married Powell's sister, Ellen Louella (Nellie) Powell (1840‚Äì1909), on July 8, 1862, in Wheaton, Illinois. They had no children. On May 16, 1864, Thompson enlisted in the United States Army, noting his residence as Hennepin, Illinois. He was commissioned as a lieutenant in Company B, 139th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment on June 1, 1864. Thompson was part of the Hundred Days Men enlistment program near the end of the American Civil War. He mustered out in Peoria, Illinois, on October 28, 1864, as a 1st Lieutenant. After the war, Thompson served as superintendent of schools at Lacon, Illinois (1865‚Äì1867) and Bloomington, Illinois (1867‚Äì1868). In the 1870 census, Thompson was listed as living in Normal, Illinois, with his wife Ellen, mother Mary, as well as Emma and John Powell. Both Thompson and Powell are listed as schoolteachers. Expeditions In 1867, Thompson's brother-in-law, John Wesley Powell, organized an expedition to the Rocky Mountains to collect specimens for the Illinois State Natural History Society. Thompson acted as the entomologist of the party. After the expedition, in 1868, Thompson resumed the superintendency of the Bloomington, Illinois, schools. He was appointed acting curator of the Illinois State Natural History Society in 1869. Following the completion of Powell's first expedition through the unexplored canyon country of Utah and Arizona in 1869 (of which Thompson was not a member), Powell and Thompson began plans for what became known as Powell's Second Expedition, which intended to retrace the earlier route to provide photographs, more accurate maps, and further scientific study of the Colorado River and the surrounding country. They secured supplies at Fort Bridger and Salt Lake City to be shipped to three locations along the expedition route. The group set out from Green River, Wyoming, in May 1871, with the geographical work in Thompson's hands. He served as chief topographer and geographer, and was in charge of field operations when Powell was absent. Because Powell was often away from the work site, Thompson was often in charge. The explorers mapped much of Utah and northern Arizona while traveling by boat from Green River, Utah, to Lees Ferry. In addition to the river survey, Thompson also led a significant overland expedition. Along with other members of the survey, he left Kanab, Utah, on May 30, 1872, to identify a passage to the mouth of the Dirty Devil River, where the Second Expedition crew had stored a boat. Their route led them along the Paria River, at the southern end of the Aquarius Plateau, over Boulder Mountain, through the Waterpocket Fold, and across the Henry Mountains. After finding the boat, Thompson mapped a return route overland while other members of the group took the boat downstream. In \\"Chapter X: Report on a Trip to the Mouth of the Dirty Devil River\\" in The Exploration of the Colorado River of the West, Thompson describes his experiences. During the trip, he named the Escalante River, the last river in the contiguous United States to be identified. He also became the first European American to reach the summit of the Henry Mountains, which likewise was the last mountain range in the contiguous United States to be surveyed. He named the highest peak Mount Ellen after his wife. Ellen Powell Thompson accompanied her husband on some of his surveying activities, including trips into the mountains and boating the rapids of southern Utah. While residing in Kanab in 1872, she collected and identified many new types of plants. Under Thompson's direction, the expedition created the first preliminary map of the southern Utah region in the winter of 1872‚Äì73. Ultimately, Thompson constructed maps of Utah, Wyoming, Arizona, and Nevada based on field work from the Powell expeditions. After the expedition, both Thompson and his wife returned to Aurora, Illinois. They were both listed as members of the Illinois State Association for Schoolmasters in 1873‚Äì1874. Powell gave Thompson credit for his work in the Preface of one of their reports, stating, \\"Professor A. H. Thompson has been my companion and collaborator during the greater part of the time, and has had entire charge of the geographic work; the final maps will exhibit the results of this learning and executive ability\\". In 1875, Thompson, along with Frederick Dellenbaugh, returned to Utah to focus on field studies and mapping of the land. At the completion of their expedition assignments in 1878, Thompson began to look for work. The April 25, 1878 Winfield (KS) Courier reported that Thompson was exploring locations to start a sheep business in Kansas. The 1880 census listed Thompson as living in Salem, Greenwood, Kansas, and working as a wool grower. After the Powell expeditions In the early 1880s, Thompson began work for the U.S. Geological Survey under the new USGS director, John Wesley Powell. He and Ellen moved to Washington, D.C. Thompson was sent to New Mexico to begin topographical surveying. The Sundry Civil Bill of 1888 appropriated funding for an irrigation survey. Thompson directed work parties throughout the west. Later, Thompson was appointed the chief geographer for the USGS. As a geographer and cartographer, he authored or co- authored many USGS maps, including maps of the Green River from the Union Pacific Railroad to the mouth of the White River. Thompson was also involved in a number of other projects, including serving as cartographer on projects in California, Colorado, Nevada, Idaho, Oregon, and Wyoming. Thompson also devised a survey instrument used during geographical operations to provide measurements that could be used in determining the irrigable land. He contributed Chapter IX to the Report on the Lands of the Arid Region by John Wesley Powell. The chapter, titled \\"Irrigable Lands of the Portion of Utah Drained by the Colorado River and its Tributaries\\", focuses on river drainage, tributaries, and geography. National Geographic Society Thompson was part of a tight-knit community of explorers, scientists and businessmen in Washington, D.C., interested in forming a geographic society. He was one of several signatories on an invitation to meet on January 13, 1888. Thompson called the meeting to order and introduced the resolution to form the society. Within two weeks, an organizing committee consisting of Thompson and others created the plan for the National Geographic Society. Serving as one of the vice-presidents of this new organization, Thompson was actively involved in its growth. Later years In a report submitted July 1, 1893, Thompson described work conducted in all of the western states and the establishment of new field offices in California, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. Thompson retained his post at the United States Geological Survey until his death on July 31, 1906. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery in the Officers Section, Site 1567, in August 1906. Naming of geographic locations Thompson is credited with naming many geographic locations during his work with John Wesley Powell and the USGS. He named the Waterpocket Fold in what is now Capitol Reef National Park, the Aquarius Plateau, the Markagunt Plateau, Mount Ellen, Boulder Mountain, Canaan Mountain, the Escalante River, and the town of Escalante in Garfield County, Utah. Thompson had strong opinions about the need for principles to aid in geographic nomenclature. He stated that \\"a geographic name should be short, euphonic, pronounced as spelled, and have a meaning or express some sentiment to help fix it in the memory\\". In choosing geographic names during the Powell expeditions, Thompson selected a combination of Piute terms such as Kaibab and Toroweap, Mormon pioneer terms like Pipe Springs and Wild Band Pockets, and also used descriptive words like Tantalus Creek and Thousand Lakes Mountain. Thompson Mesa in the Henry Mountains, Thompson Point in the Grand Canyon, Mount Thompson in the Sierra Nevada, and Thompson Peak in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains near Santa Fe were all named in honor of A. H. Thompson. Legacy Thompson's accomplishments are often overlooked in history books and websites. Dellenbaugh notes that although Thompson was largely responsible for the \\"scientific and practical success of the second expedition\\", Powell ignored Thompson's contributions in his reports. In the introduction to Thompson's diaries, Herbert Gregory states that \\"Thompson possessed that rare combination of qualities that brings success to the explorer: a rigid insistence on discipline and order of procedure, kindness toward his subordinates, and sympathetic interest in the native people with whom he came in contact\\". Frederick Dellenbaugh, author of The Romance of the Colorado River and a fellow member of the Second Expedition, stated that \\"to his (Thompson's) foresight, rare good judgment, ability to think out a plan to the last minute detail, fine nerve and absolute lack of any kind of foolishness, together with a wide knowledge and intelligence, this expedition, and indeed the scientific work so admirably carried on by the United States Survey of the Rocky Mountain region and the Geological Survey for three decades in the Far West, largely own success\\".

She was the president of the French Union for Women's Suffrage (Union fran√ßaise pour le suffrage des femmes / UFSF) movement. She married into the Schlumberger family and became a powerfully influential matriarch and the mother of several sons who achieved notability in their own right. For her active involvement and service to the government, she was awarded the Croix of the French Legion of Honour in 1920. Early life and education Marguerite de Witt was the daughter of , a mayor of Saint-Ouen-le-Pin who later became a conservative deputy representing the Calvados Department in the French National Assembly. The name \\"de Witt\\" disclosed the family's Dutch origins, as a result of which they also were members of France's minority Protestant community. Marguerite's mother, Henriette Guizot de Witt, was a prolific novelist who, as the daughter of prime minister Fran√ßois Guizot, also came from a leading family of French Protestants. Marguerite and her sister, Jeanne, were educated by their mother. According to Coste, their mother demonstrated to her daughters how a woman could combine interest in spiritual matters with the ability to earn money to support a family, while at the same time filling the role assigned to a woman by the social norms of the time. (\\"leur montra qu'une femme pouvait s'int√©resser √† la vie de l'esprit et gagner de l'argent pour faire vivre les siens, tout en remplissant le r√¥le que la soci√©t√© de l'√©poque lui assignait\\") Catherine Coste in Fran√ßois Guizot, \\"Lettres √† sa fille Henriette (1836‚Äì1874)\\", 2002 While girls, they lived in a family environment in which they were surrounded by cousins. Along with members of the extended de Witt- Guizot families, there was an abundance of Broglie relatives as well as some of the younger kinsfolk of George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen, who was a family friend of the Guizots. Career Marguerite and Jeanne participated actively in their mother's philanthropic ventures. In 1865 a \\"workplace\\" for young girls was opened at Le Val Richer, a former abbey that had been a Guizot family property since 1836. Five years later, a children's asylum was added. For twenty years Marguerite served as a Protestant prison visitor, becoming associated with the campaigning of the abolitionist Protestant philanthropist Sarah Monod in respect of the \\"fallen women\\" detained in the Hospital-prison of Saint-Lazare. During that time, she married Paul Schlumberger (1876). She took over her mother's work that involved the rehabilitation of prostitutes. She campaigned with energy for the abolition of \\"regulated prostitution\\", also presiding over the International Commission for a Single Standard of Morality and against the White Slave Trade. She was also vigorous in her campaigning against alcohol abuse and was a member of the National League against Alcoholism. In her hometown (after 1876) of Guebwiller, she opened two \\"tea-total\\" cabarets where revelers could drink broth in place of beer. She was on record as suggesting that one should neither drink alcohol nor offer [alcoholic] drinks to visitors. Like many who were involved in the 19th-century social purity movement, de Witt-Schlumberger moved into feminism at the turn of the century. The moral crusades of earlier decades had opened discussion on previously taboo topics, such as legal double standards for men and women. From 1913, she served as the president of the French Union for Women's Suffrage (Union fran√ßaise pour le suffrage des femmes / UFSF) and urged women during World War I to move into the workplace while their men were fighting in the war. Recognizing that international support might further their cause, feminists added suffrage to the agenda of the 1913 International Congress on Women's Charities and Institutions meeting in Paris. The following year, de Witt-Schlumberger was in Rome meeting with women from the International Women's Suffrage Alliance (IWSA). By 1917, de Witt- Schlumberger had become a vice president of the IWSA. In 1917, the women had presented a petition to the Chamber of Deputies asking for voting equality in return for the work they had done during the war. Although it passed in the chamber in 1922, three years after it was introduced, the senate shelved the legislation and de Witt-Schlumberger vowed to fight on. At the end of the war, when armistice talks were held and the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 was debating terms of peace, de Witt-Schlumberger proposed that women's issues become part of the treaty process. After being refused the right to participate, she organized the women from the French Union for Women's Suffrage and the National Council of French Women, to invite international colleagues to meet in Paris in a parallel conference, known as the Inter- Allied Women's Conference, scheduled to open on 10 February 1919. Gathering delegates from countries aligned with the IWSA, she led them to propose to U.S. President Woodrow Wilson and the Prime Minister of France, Georges Clemenceau, that women be appointed to participate on the committees and allowed to present a plea for women's equality. Initially, the women were denied, but were given leave to make a presentation to the commission tasked with drafting the documents forming the League of Nations. On 10 April 1919 the women made their presentation, asking for women to be allowed to serve on commissions and as part of the executive council of the league. They asked for trafficking of women and children to be banned, for education to be protected, and for suffrage to be recognized in principle. Several of their ideas were incorporated into the final treaty. In 1920, de Witt-Schlumberger was appointed as the sole woman to be a member of the Conseil sup√©rieur de la Natalit√© (CSN) (Birth Council) and argued that women should be able to protect themselves from diseased or unfit fathers. That same year, she was awarded the Croix of the French Legion of Honour for her active involvement and service to the government. In 1923, when Carrie Chapman Catt stepped down as president of the IWSA, de Witt-Schlumberger was seen by many as her successor. Though elected, she declined the post, citing health reasons. Personal life Marguerite de Witt married Paul Schlumberger (1848‚Äì1926) on 30 June 1876. He was from a family of Protestant industrialists who traced their wealth back to Paul's grandfather, (1782‚Äì1867), who had made a fortune as a textiles (cotton) baron. Records indicate that Marguerite gave birth to five sons and one daughter, born in Guebwiller (Alsace). The eldest son, Jean (1877‚Äì1968), achieved fame as a journalist and writer. Conrad and Marcel Schlumberger qualified as a physicist and engineer, respectively, becoming noteworthy for their inventions in the fields of geophysics and petroleum technology. In 1926 these two founded what in 2012 became the world's largest oilfield services company. Another son, Daniel Schlumberger, was killed in the First World War. Although Marguerite was from western France, her husband's family was from Alsace, which had become part of Germany following frontier changes mandated in 1871. After 1871 it was not practical to move the family's large factories across the new frontier into France, and to do so would have involved leaving large numbers of factory employees behind, rendering them jobless in Alsace. Her children, therefore, were born in the recently unified German state, however, as each of her sons neared the age of 15, the age at which they could have faced conscription into the German army, Marguerite moved them out of Alsace and into France. By doing so, she achieved further plaudits from those sources favouring the French national version of history, because in her home town near Mulhouse she became an \\"upper-class [French] patriot\\", leading \\"passive resistance\\" against what Francophone commentators tended to identify as German occupation. She died 23 October 1924.

Hall was born in Wivenhoe, near Colchester, in 1739. He studied under the French immigrant engraver Simon Fran√ßois Ravenet. A fellow student was William Wynne Ryland, later executed for forgery. In 1756 and 1761, he won prizes from the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce.John Hall, National Portrait Gallery Hall was appointed a fellow of the Society of Artists in 1765, later serving as its director (an annual appointment requiring election). He was elected director in 1768, 1769 and 1771. In 1785 he was appointed historical engraver to George III, following the death of William Woollett. He engraved a number of portraits, including one of Richard Brinsley Sheridan painted by Joshua Reynolds. He also engraved the plates for Bell's British Theatre. This included illustrations of scenes, created by Hall himself, and portraits of actors performing well-known roles. Hall created the earliest visual image of Hamlet holding Yorick's skull, with his 1773 engraving (after a design by Edward Edwards) in Bell's edition of Shakespeare's Plays.Alan R.

Unfortunately, Tina accidentally hits another car which turns out to be Jimmy Pesto's, Bob's rival. Bob decides to lie about the accident, saying that it was him who was driving the car at the time. Tina becomes extremely uncomfortable about the lying, and she starts to believe that she is a jinx. Mort the mortician offers to drive the family around while their car is at the shop. This proves inconvenient for him however, as the family goes to many places and is consuming much gas. He tries to confront the Belchers about this, but always fails to do so. Mort then finally finds the courage to tell the family how he feels, but then finds out that the car will be back tomorrow and Linda has already left a thank you package on his doorstep for his help. The family meets Chase, an insurance adjuster who at first seemed like he believes the story Bob and Tina invented in order to get their insurance claim. He invites the family to cater a party at his house, where Tina (who was manning the grill) accidentally sets the house on fire. Tina gets nightmares from the lies and Bob finally decides to come clean to Chase and the rest of the family. When they arrive at his office however, Chase reveals that he knew the story was just invented, but he figured that if he helped the Belchers get their insurance claim, they could help him earn money by committing insurance fraud. He then admits that the fire was no accident: he used unscented gas to burn down the house. After refusing to go along with his crimes, Chase blackmails the two of them and he tells Tina that Bob could go to jail. He then says that they should flood their basement in order to file another insurance claim. The family then tries to trick Chase by making it look like the children drowned in the basement so he would leave them alone, but he sees through their lies and tells them that he wasn't letting go of them, since restaurants are magnets for accidents. Bob thinks they will never be able to escape Chase, until Tina reveals that she used Gene's Casio keyboard to record Chase implicating himself in all the crimes. They send the keyboard to the FBI, and Chase gets caught. Tina finally lets go of the idea that she is a jinx, after she saves the family from Chase. Reception Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a A, saying \\"This all adds up to an episode that got everything right, and when that‚Äôs combined with two hilarious scenes and some better-than-normal character work, you have one of the best episodes Bob‚Äôs Burgers has done‚Ä¶ although it may have the worst title of the series.\\" The episode received a 1.8 rating and was watched by a total of 3.97 million people.

Plot While at school, Gene learns that a girl named Courtney, who he finds irritating, is infatuated with him. While surrounded by her and her friends, Gene is pressured into pretending that he shares her feelings. As Courtney believes they are in a relationship, she constantly spends time around Gene, which irritates him. Gene finds himself unable to end his relationship with Courtney, and when he gets home, he complains about his situation to his parents, Linda and Bob, however, they do not see the problem. Later, Gene is invited on a double date to the movies with Courtney and her friend, and Bob drives them. After Courtney repeatedly kicks Bob's seat during the drive, Bob begins to agree that Courtney is irritating and that Gene should break up with her. After practicing terminating a relationship with his sisters Louise and Tina, Gene makes his way over to Courtney's house to talk to her. However, he is instead greeted by her father Doug, who is a jingle writer. Impressed by Doug's collection of electronic musical instruments, he decides to stay in the relationship in order to use the equipment, thinking Doug will sign him a record deal.

Gene loses his patience and yells at Courtney to stop interrupting. After Gene finishes his tangent, she begins to stop breathing, leaving her in the hospital. Gene visits her in her room, and apologizes for shouting. He finally breaks up with her. Gene asks Doug if he can continue to visit to use his equipment, but Doug says no. In a subplot, Linda decides to go on a diet after a visit from her stylist Gretchen, who has recently lost weight. She picks a diet that involves solely eating the skins of fruits and vegetables. She becomes increasingly sour as her diet progresses, and eventually gives up after learning she has not lost any weight. Production \\"The Unbearable Like-Likeness of Gene\\" was written by series regular Holly Schlesinger and directed by Don MacKinnon. It is the first episode of the season to be written by Schlesinger and is also the first episode of the season to be directed by MacKinnon. The episode, produced as part of the second season production cycle, was executive produced by series creator Loren Bouchard and series developer Jim Dauterive. Jon Schroeder served as producer for \\"The Unbearable Like-Likeness of Gene,\\" while Bernard Derriman served as supervising director. The episode guest stars comedian and actor David Wain as Courtney, the student who is infatuated with Gene. Series creator Loren Bouchard praised Wain's performance as Courtney, stating that \\"he did such a good, funny, weird job.\\" During the writing of the episode, the staff attempted to find a trait in Courtney that would convince people that Courtney was irritating and that Gene would have to convince himself to like her. Holly Scheslinger came up with the idea of Courtney constantly sucking on her necklace, which was used as the trait in the episode. Wain, who recorded his scenes in New York City, had to bite on a pen to replicate the sound of Courtney chewing, which Bouchard described as \\"a little bit of studio magic.\\" In addition to Wain, the episode features several other guest stars. John Michael Higgins voiced Courtney's father, Doug. On Higgins' performance, Bouchard said that \\"I think he did such a fantastic job with that guy. Just dorky and proud of his gear.\\" Other guest stars include Kurt Braunohler as the doctor at the hospital, Melissa Galsky as Julie, and Kulap Vilaysack as Rupa.

Reviews of the episode were mostly positive. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club wrote of the episode, \\"Being \\"real\\" is also one of the episode's bigger weaknesses.\\" He continued, \\"I worried a little bit last week that focusing on the kids growing up might cause them to lose some of their anarchic power, and that's certainly the case here. I found \\"The Unbearable Like-Likeness Of Gene\\" to be fairly sweet and subdued for a Bob's Burgers. This isn't a bad thing. But I'm not sure it plays to Bob's chaotic strengths, like the scene where the kids charged into the bedroom last week, or pretty much all of \\"Art Crawl/\\" He ultimately graded the episode as a B+. Ross Bonaime of Paste wrote positively about the episode, saying, \\"This week's Gene-centric episode isn't as great as Tina's brilliant driving mishap, but the two work well together under the theme of the children growing up and the entire family having to deal with their decisions and problems.\\" He continued, \\"I like that the Belchers are calmer this week, dealing with Gene's problem and helping each other out.\\" He also noted that the scene where Gene and Bob talk at the movie theater \\"might [be] one of my personal favorite moments in the show‚Äôs history.\\" However, he criticized the subplot, saying that \\"it doesn't really go anywhere.\\" He gave the episode an 8.1 out of 10.

This festival is the brainchild of Sarod maestro Pandit Tejendra Narayan Majumdar, his vocalist wife, Manasi Majumder and their son Indrayuddh Majumder, who is also a brilliant Sarod player. The festival is dedicated to Swara Samrat Ustad Ali Akbar Khan. Indian Classical Music and Dance Legends such as Pandit Shivkumar Sharma, Pandit Birju Maharaj, Pandit Hari Prasad Chaurasia, Pandit Jasraj, Ustad Zakir Hussain, Ustad Aashish Khan, Dr. Girija Devi, Begum Parveen Sultana, Pandit Swapan Chaudhuri, Guru Karaikudi Mani, Ustad Rashid Khan, Shankar Mahadevan, Pandit Budhaditya Mukherjee, Pandit Ulhas Kashalkar, Pandit Venkatesh Kumar, Pandit Ajoy Chakraborty, Pandit Anindo Chatterjee, Pandit Sanjay Mukherjee, Ustad Shahid Parvez, Ustad Shujaat Khan, Pandit Tejendra Narayan Majumdar, Pandit Kushal Das, Pandit Rajendra Gangani, Guru Sujata Mohapatra, Pandit Subhankar Banerjee, Pandit Yogesh Samsi, Pandit Bickram Ghosh, Pandit Tanmoy Bose and Kaushiki Chakraborty are some of the artists who have previously performed in this festival.  Background  Swara Samrat festival started as a two-day festival of Indian Classical music & dance on 5 & 6 January 2013, featuring some of the greatest living icons of Indian classical music & dance before a 3500 plus audience each day at Nazrul Manch, Kolkata. The festival was initially planned as a festival to celebrate the 90th Birth Year of Swara Samrat Ustad Ali Akbar Khan (1922-2009). Bharat Ratna Pandit Ravi Shankar was informed about the event and had expressed his joy and support. But just a month before this festival, the Sitar icon breathed his last (11 December 2012). After his demise, Shree Ranjani Foundation Trust decided to dedicate this festival to the Sitar legend too. The Majumdars called this festival a dedication to \\"The Immortal Duo ‚Äì Swara Samrat Ali Akbar Khan and Bharat Ratna Ravi Shankar\\". Both of them had learnt from the same Guru and had performed exemplary duet concerts across the globe, which are still regarded as the greatest of North Indian Instrumental Jugalbandis (Duets). The full house was overwhelmed by this grand gesture. Every of the audience wanted this festival to repeat. Swara Samrat Festival received enormous love and affection not only from the audience but also from the performers and sponsors. Shree Ranjani Foundation Trust decided to continue this festival annually and from then onward the festival is held during the winters every year.  Swara Samrat - The Title  Acharya Baba Ustad Allauddin Khan, who is regarded as one of the greatest saints of Indian Classical Music in 19th & 20th Centuries, who had founded the Maihar Senia Gharana, had gifted his son Ali Akbar Khan, the title Swara Samrat (meaning Emperor of Melody).  Swara Samrat Festival - Time Period  Initially Swara Samrat Festival was a two-day festival. It used to be held in the months of January/February every year. But after the 4th season, which was held on 10 & 12 January 2016, SSF wanted to fix the time period of the festival to the month of December. So in the same year 2016, the 4th season was held in January and 5th season was in December. Since then, SSF is maintaining the December time frame. 2018 onward, SSF has become a 4-day festival of Indian Classical Music & Dance.  SSF Lifetime Achievement Award  In 2018, SSF honored Janaab Abul Khair Litu (Chairman, Bengal Foundation, Bangladesh) with the SSF Lifetime Achievement Award for his enormous contribution to the propagation, promotion and facilitation of proper training of Indian Classical Music & Dance as well as other forms of Arts across Bangladesh. In 2019‚Äì20, Pandit Vijay Kichlu, an eminent musician, musicologist, music producer and founder of ITC Sangeet Research Academy was honored with the SSF Lifetime Achievement Award for his lifelong contribution to the entire fraternity of Indian classical music and dance across India and abroad.  One Star Introduces Another Star on Stage  SSF has a very unique way of introducing the stars on the dais. One star (who is not performing on that day of the festival) introduces another star on the dais when the latter takes the stage for performance. Through this, the audience see numerous beautiful and rarest of moments when these stars greet each other on the dais. = Season 8 (1, 7 & 8 December 2019, and 13 February 2020)= *Pt.

He was repeatedly billed by music critics as \\"the finest successor of Pablo de Sarasate\\",Ana Luque Fern√°ndez, THE WORKS OF MANUEL QUIROGA: A CATALOGUE and he is sometimes referred to as \\"Sarasate's spiritual heir\\". Enrique Granados, Eug√®ne Ysa√øe (whose sixth Solo Sonata is dedicated to Quiroga) and other composers dedicated compositions to him. The greatest violinists of the time ‚Äì Ysa√øe, Fritz Kreisler, George Enescu, Mischa Elman and Jascha Heifetz ‚Äì as well as composers such as Igor Stravinsky and Jean Sibelius, held Quiroga's artistry in great regard. Guilhermina Suggia, the Portuguese cellist (and one-time companion of Pablo Casals), described his playing of Tartini's Devil's Trill Sonata as \\"marvellous and flawless\\". Quiroga was also a composer of two violin concertos, sets of variations, studies and smaller violin pieces, and cadenzas to major concertos from the core repertoire. He was the first to extensively use Galician nationalistic folklore as the basis of classical music compositions, and he was also a respected caricaturist and portraitist in oil and charcoal. Quiroga has not had the ongoing recognition outside his native land that he perhaps deserves. His career was halted prematurely, before he had made a significant body of recordings, and shortly after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. Nevertheless, his legacy has been preserved in Galicia, and is being brought back to international attention. Biography=Early years= Manuel Quiroga Losada was born in Pontevedra, Galicia, Spain in 1892. His first study of the violin was with a local amateur named Juan Sayago. He then moved on to a more qualified teacher, Benito Medal. He gave his first public concert in 1900, at the age of 8. He gave other concerts, on 12 July 1903 at the Cafe Moderno in Pontevedra, and in 1904 at the Circulo Mercantil in Santiago de Compostela. In June 1904, he was awarded a grant to study at the Madrid Royal Conservatory with Jos√© del Hierro, an exponent of the Franco-Belgian school of violin playing who was considered the leading Spanish violinist of his time. In 1906 he was given a 1682 Amati violin by an admiring family. He continued to give concerts in Madrid and throughout Galicia while he studied. His skill as a graphic artist was also starting to reveal itself by this time. In 1907 some of his early drawings and caricatures were published in the magazine Galicia, in Madrid. In 1909 he and his father set out for Berlin, Germany to take lessons with Fritz Kreisler, whose playing he greatly admired. But while in Paris en route they decided Manuel should audition for a place at the Conservatoire de Paris, and his name was the first among several hundred candidates to be accepted. There he studied with √âdouard Nadaud (1862‚Äì1928) and Jules Boucherit; he also had some lessons with Jacques Thibaud in 1911. He also associated with George Enescu and Eug√®ne Ysa√øe, and learned some of Kreisler's compositions, while enjoying the friendship of Manuel de Falla, Joaqu√≠n Turina, Pablo Casals, Darius Milhaud, the cellist Juan Ruiz Casaux and the French pianist Marthe Lehman, a fellow student at the Conservatoire. Her family helped Quiroga financially and arranged social introductions. =Early adulthood= On 4 July 1911, aged 19, Quiroga won the Conservatoire's Premi√®re Prix nomm√©, awarded by a jury that included Gabriel Faur√©, Kreisler, Thibaud, Boucherit, Lucien Capet and Martin Pierre Marsick. He was the first Spanish winner of the prize since Pablo de Sarasate in 1861. Other prizes and awards followed, such as the Prix Sarasate and the Prix Jules Garcin. Quiroga was a soloist in performances with the Conservatory Orchestra and the Concerts Lamoureux. In a concert in his home town Pontevedra on 26 August 1911 he was accompanied on the piano by Enrique Granados, who became his friend. He then gave a large number of highly successful concerts throughout Spain and France, often appearing with chamber associates such as the cellist Juan Ruiz Casaux, and the pianists Jos√© Cubiles (who premiered de Falla's Nights in the Gardens of Spain in 1916) and Jos√© Iturbi. He made Paris his base, and he associated there with musicians such as Paul Paray, Manuel Infante, Joaqu√≠n Nin and Ricardo Vi√±es, along with Casals, Falla, Turina, Milhaud and others. He made some recordings in April 1912. In 1913 he was contracted to the concert promoter Jos J. Sch√ºrmann, who also managed Jan Kubel√≠k, Ignacy Jan Paderewski, Isadora Duncan and other artists. C√©sar Lombera. At the start of World War I, he was giving concerts in Austria with Jos√© Iturbi when he was accused of espionage and jailed for a short time, until the intercession of the Spanish king Alfonso XIII secured his release. The war led to the cancellation of that European tour, but it opened the door to new horizons in the United States, which was still neutral. Before setting out, he married Marthe Lehman on 21 July 1915. He made four highly successful tours of the United States and Canada during the war years, starting in 1914, again including Cubiles and Casaux. His American debut was before an audience of 5,000 people at the New York Hippodrome. Other great violinists such as Mischa Elman, Efrem Zimbalist and Albert Spalding attended his concerts. He refused a fifth planned American tour when his friend Enrique Granados drowned in the English Channel while returning from New York City in 1916, a victim of a German submarine torpedo attack. In 1918‚Äì19 he made a major tour of Spain and Portugal, often with Jos√© Iturbi as his associate artist. In Galicia, he was widely hailed as the most notable Galician artist of the day, and he was even at times used as a symbol for the Galician nationalistic movement. He was named an honorary member of the Madrid Philharmonic Orchestra and was appointed one of King Alfonso XIII's court musicians. =Professional success= The years between the two world wars were the height of Quiroga's career. After the war, he returned to Spain and received a huge public reception at the Palau de la M√∫sica Catalana in Barcelona. He made his British debut in 1919, and played in many notable venues there such as the Wigmore Hall in London (14 April 1920). Then followed more concerts all over Europe: Portugal, France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Belgium. He was often accompanied by pianists such as Iturbi, Paul Paray (he premiered Paray's Sonata for Violin and Piano with the composer at the piano in 1922) and Juan Jos√© Castro. His wife Marthe Lehman (Madame Quiroga) was just as often his accompanist. The first of his compositions appeared in print in 1921. In 1923 Eug√®ne Ysa√øe dedicated the last of his Six Sonatas for solo violin to Quiroga, the other dedicatees being Joseph Szigeti, Jacques Thibaud, George Enescu, Fritz Kreisler and Mathieu Crickboom. Ysaye noted: : It is in remembering the Spanish violinist's playing style, which reminded him of Sarasate, that the master conceived his last Sonata for unaccompanied violin. Here, even more than in the others, the master endeavors to adapt the violinistic writing to the playing of the artist to whom the work is dedicated. Quiroga never performed it publicly. He returned to the United States in 1924, where his two Carnegie Hall concerts amazed Mischa Elman. He also played under the baton of Arturo Toscanini. Back in Britain he played with the London Symphony Orchestra under Sir Thomas Beecham, touring as well in Belgium and Spain. Memorial to Manuel Quiroga in Pontevedra. On 31 March 1925 in A Coru√±a, Manuel Quiroga premiered a major composition of his own, Concierto de Intrata. He later renamed this Primer Concierto en el estilo antiguo (First Concerto in the old style). He often performed this work during his career, but mostly in an arrangement for violin and piano. In June 1925 he was admitted to the Soci√©t√© des auteurs, compositeurs et √©diteurs de musique in Paris. He made his first South American tour in 1926, visiting Argentina and Uruguay, followed by Cuba, Mexico and the United States once more. He made a series of recordings of short pieces in 1928 for RCA Victor and Path√©. One of his best paintings, a self-portrait in oil, was finished in 1930. He made more tours of America in 1933 and 1937, where he gave recitals with Mischa Levitzki and Jos√© Iturbi, and concerts with the New York Philharmonic under the baton of George Enescu (playing √âdouard Lalo's Symphonie espagnole in February 1937). He also continued to premiere his own compositions such as \\"Danza Argentina\\" and \\"Canto y Danza Andaluza\\". In this last tour he also played Joaqu√≠n Turina's 1934 Sonata \\"Espa√±ola\\", Op. 82, in his New York concerts, even though the piece was not premiered in Spain until 1941. =Accident and retirement= On 8 June 1937, following a New York recital with Iturbi, Quiroga was hit by a truck while crossing Times Square. He survived and continued his career for some time, but progressively lost feeling and mobility in his arm, and was forced to retire from performing. (Curiously, his idol Fritz Kreisler was hit by a truck while crossing a street in the same city four years later.) He returned to Spain and continued painting, entering competitions, and completing two more self-portraits. He also sought out the company of important figures in the art world such as the painter Ignacio Zuloaga, the sculptor Francisco Asorey, and many others. He had earlier met Joaqu√≠n Sorolla. In 1940 he made an extensive series of caricatures of his friends: Fritz Kreisler, Jos√© Iturbi, Eug√®ne Ysa√øe, Pablo Casals, Carlos Ch√°vez, Andr√©s Segovia, Arthur Rubinstein, Lucien Capet, Ricardo Vi√±es, Jacques Thibaud, and others. He also continued composing, but was later stricken by Parkinson's disease. He became virtually confined to a sanatorium in Madrid, and in 1959 moved back to his home town of Pontevedra, where he was cared for by his second wife Maria Eladia Galvani Bolognini (whom he called Gigi). He died there on 19 April 1961, aged 69. Recordings Manuel Quiroga recorded no major repertoire such as sonatas or concertos. He made recordings of numerous short pieces in 1912 and again in 1928. Most or all of these are included in a recording called \\"Great Violinists, Volume 5\\", issued by Symposium Records. The pieces include works by Alb√©niz, Falla, Kreisler, Sarasate, Wieniawski and others, and importantly, four of his own compositions: Segunda Guajira, Danza espa√±ola, Rondalla, and Canto amoroso. Some of these recordings can also be accessed on YouTube. Dedications Musical works dedicated to Manuel Quiroga included: * Enrique Granados: Violin Sonata (one movement) * Eug√®ne Ysa√øe: Sonata No. 6 for solo violin * Eduardo Fabini (1882‚Äì1950): Fantas√≠a para violin y orquesta * Joaqu√≠n Nin: Sur un air de danse de Pablo Esteve, 1779, the fifth of \\"Cinq comentaires\\" * Marcel Samuel-Rousseau: Les Promis * √âdouard Nadaud: the fifth of his Six √âtudes de Concert * C√©sar Espejo (1892‚Äì1988): Fileuse, Op. 12 * Roger Penou: Air de danse * Jacques Arnay: Fragment Lyrique, Op. 11. The Spanish writer Ram√≥n del Valle-Incl√°n dedicated his poem ¬°Del Celta es la Victoria! to Quiroga, and had copies handed out as nationalistic propaganda at a concert by Quiroga in A Coru√±a in 1918. Honours and legacy The King of Spain appointed Manuel Quiroga a Commander of the Order of Alfonso X, the Wise (Encomienda de Alfonso X El Sabio). On 24 September 1931, he was named a Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur by the French Government. The Pontevedra Conservatory, founded in 1863, is now the \\"Conservatorio Profesional de Musica Manuel Quiroga\\". The street on which he was born, Calle del Comercio, has been renamed Calle Manuel Quiroga in his honour. The people of A Coru√±a in Galicia erected a sculpture in his honour in 1950. There is also a memorial bust in Pontevedra, the work of the sculptor Francisco Asorey, and in the city square is a full-size statue of him shown playing the violin to a group of friends seated around him. In his centenary year 1992, the City Museum of Pontevedra organized a series of commemorative events such as an exhibition of his paintings and drawings and some musical homages. These utilised some of his music manuscripts, paintings, drawings, caricatures, and other memorabilia, which Quiroga's family had donated to the museum in 1972. A compilation of some of his autograph scores was published by M√∫sica en Compostela, a musical institution based in Santiago de Compostela). His biography was published in 1993 by Fernando Otero Urtaza, and an article by Tully Potter in the special Iberian issue of The Strad in July 1998 traced his career. The Cuarteto Quiroga was named in his honour.

He had the option to appeal but dropped it on April 30, so the suspension would take effect. Ventura pitched to a 5.19 ERA before the Royals optioned him to Omaha on July 21.

It aired on Fox in the United States on December 16, 2012. Plot When Bob inherits a storage unit around Christmas, the family hope that they will contain riches, but instead they find a squatter named Chet who claims he was previously a display mannequin. The family take him in, only to discover that he has a talent for creating seasonal window displays out of mannequins, in which he also poses. The displays Chet put up in preparation for Christmas prove very popular with people stopping to look at the display and helps increase business for the restaurant. As Christmas approaches Chet becomes increasingly unstable, eventually claiming that he is in love with another mannequin Nadine from whom he has become separated, after the store he used to reside in went out of business due to a mall that reduced business. Chet then further claims that he met Nadine when the store, Lombard's Department Store, was at its peak in business, and his relationship with Nadine became more \\"casual\\" and that one day Nadine had an accident that ended with her right hand being destroyed and Nadine coming back with two left hands instead of a replacement right hand. Chet then claims that when Lombard's Department Store eventually went out of business because of the mall, OMG Mall, he was separated from Nadine soon after and that the pain of being separated from her \\"turned him into a human.\\" Tina proclaims that Chet's story is \\"the greatest love story ever told\\" and convinces Chet they could help him find Nadine even if they have to look far and wide to find her. Bob doesn't approve of the kids looking for her and says Chet was never a mannequin and that Nadine is probably in a dump somewhere, upsetting him. Upset with her husband, Linda storms to her bedroom and demands a snack. In his misery, Chet creates a macabre and terrifying display, and the desperate family track Nadine down to a sex store, much to the dismay and disapproval of Bob, who reluctantly joins the kids in going to the sex store and get Nadine back. Liberating the mannequin, they reunite her with Chet and convince him to create a more appropriate display in time for Christmas. The display gets a brief moment of success but is interrupted by the sudden arrival of the sex shop owner demanding they give Nadine back and wrecks the display in the process of trying take Nadine back. The kids then pay the owner $263 to buy the mannequin back so Chet can keep Nadine. Eventually the crowd becomes fed up with the wrecked display, and everyone leaves. The family then decides to let Chet stay until January. On Christmas morning the family then enjoys Christmas morning with Gene getting a door exit sign, Tina getting a shoe-sizer and Louise a security tag remover. Bob then asks what Chet plans on doing after they kick him out when January arrives, and Chet reveals that he plans on staying at his apartment in Manhattan and that he plans on seeing how a renovated loft turns out, revealing that he wasn't homeless at all, much to Bob's shock and anger. Reception Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a A‚Äì, saying \\"The entire episode hits that sweet spot between sweet and weird. Even the moment where Chet goes a little crazy and makes a horrifying window display is oddly endearing, thanks to the ketchup bottle squirting 'blood.' That‚Äôs clever, weird, but also impressive. That‚Äôs Bob‚Äôs Burgers, and I‚Äôm happy that the show is getting a chance to apply its impressive clever weirdness to the holidays.\\" Ross Bonaime of Paste gave the episode 8.5 out of 10, saying \\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentle-Mannequins\\" is essentially everything you could want from a holiday episode of Bob‚Äôs Burgers. Chet‚Äôs story of finding mannequin love with Nadine is so ridiculous, yet everyone in the family except Bob finds it to be beautiful. Tina even proclaims it to be the greatest love story ever told. That may not be accurate, but it‚Äôs definitely the weirdest love story you‚Äôre going to find in a holiday TV special.\\" The episode received a 1.5 rating and was watched by a total of 3.09 million people. This made it the fourth most watched show of Fox's Animation Domination block that night, beating The Cleveland Show but losing to The Simpsons with 3.77 million. The likely reason that this episode was the least-watched upon premiere of any of the episodes of 'Bob's Burgers' to date is due to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that had occurred on December 14, 2012, two days prior to the episodes' airing on December 16, 2012.

Expanded on the back of William Froude's patent for inventing the water brake dynamometer, their most famous creation was the high Blackpool Tower. History After service on developing the East India Railway (EIR), Hammersley Heenan returned to England and purchased the engineering company and works of Woodhouse and Co. in Newton Heath, Lancashire. In 1881, he went into partnership with former EIR colleague Richard Hurrell Froude, forming Heenan & Froude Ltd. In 1883, after the death of his father William Froude, Richard inherited the rights to his father's patents, including that for the manufacture of the water brake dynamometer. From its base, the company undertook a number of significant late-Victorian era engineering projects, including supplying and constructing the steelworks for Folkestone Pier (1887) and in the same year supplying a girder bridge to Empresa de los Ferrocarriles del Estado (EFE) the national railway of Chile. The company developed two designs of steerable torpedo, the first to the design of Colonel Lay which were demonstrated to both the Admiralty, and the second to an Australian design. In 1882 Heenan & Froude were appointed structural engineers to the Blackpool Tower, supplying and constructing both the main tower, the electric lighting and the steel front pieces for the aquariums. After purchasing a factory in Birmingham, West Midlands in 1902, the company greatly expanded after incorporating and moving its headquarters to Worcester in 1903. By then a general purpose engineering company, they made: exhaust and mine ventilating fans; colliery and mining plant; belts, conveyors and elevators; sawing machines; bench chains; water dynamometers; spherical, horizontal and vertical engines; patent water boilers; bridge and roof iron work; and refuse destructors. =STD Motors= After World War I, the French motorcar company Darracq acquired a major stake in the company. After Darracq was merged into STD Motors in 1920 (the merger of the Sunbeam- Talbot-Darracq motorcar companies), STD acquired the residual shares in Heenan & Froude. =Heenan Group= After STD Motors went bankrupt in 1935, the business was acquired by investors and renamed Heenan Group Ltd. At this point it comprised seven engineering companies across five factories, and resultantly listed on the London Stock Exchange. After agreeing a 50/50 joint- venture company in 1938 with Caprotti Ltd to develop and sell steam locomotive valves, the board then began to build the business further through acquisition, including buying Gloucester-based Fielding & Platt in 1939. =Acquisitions= Having become a shadow factory during World War II supplying precision aircraft parts, postwar the company was chaired by A.P. Good. Through acquisition, he created a railway engineering business division by amalgamating significant parts of the UK's locomotive building industry: *Associated Locomotive Equipment: which operated from Shrub Hill Works, Worcester *W. G. Bagnall of Stafford: which specialised in building railway rolling stock and locomotives. It was sold to W.H. Dorman & Co. Ltd. of Stafford in 1959. *Brush Electrical Engineering Company *Caprotti Ltd: acquired all outstanding shares ALE owned the UK rights for the production of poppet valve gears for steam locomotives, including British-Caprotti, and the Lentz Rotary Cam and Oscillating Cam systems. The most important locomotive equipped by the company was the unique BR Standard Class 8 4-6-2 No.71000 Duke of Gloucester. Good died in 1953, after which the various businesses were sold off piecemeal by his successor James Fielding. After the company supplied dynamometers to Ford UK to test the Ford GT40, Fielding acquired the first UK- supplied and fourth built model of the car. =Redman Heenan Froude= In 1968 Heenan Group was acquired by Redman Engineering, and renamed itself Redman Heenan Froude Ltd. Soon afterwards the company decided to cease its heavy engineering business and concentrate instead on property development and leasing, changing its name again to Redman Heenan International plc. In the late 1980s, the division of Froude Engineering became part of Babcock International. =St. Modwen Properties= In April 1986, Sir Stanley Clarke CBE led the reverse takeover of the company, by backing his Clarke St. Modwen property development business into the virtual shell company that was Redman Heenan International plc. Following completion of the deal, the company was renamed St. Modwen Properties plc. The residual engineering businesses were sold to FKI Group in 1987.

She used the ambiguity of a law, that issued the right to vote to literate head-of-households over 21, to cast her vote in the election of the Constituent National Assembly in 1911. Shortly thereafter, on July 3, 1913, a law was passed to specify the right to vote was only for male citizens, literate and over 21. Her act was widely reported on throughout Portugal and among feminist associations in other countries. Life Carolina Beatriz Angelo was a medical doctor practicing in Lisbon. She was a feminist and suffragette who participated in multiple women's associations.

The events can include other nuclei such as helium ions and HZE ions. These particles cause multiple effects. They can penetrate the Earth's magnetic field and cause ionization in the ionosphere. The effect is similar to auroral events, except that protons rather than electrons are involved. Energetic protons are a significant radiation hazard to spacecraft and astronauts.  Description  Solar protons normally have insufficient energy to penetrate the Earth's magnetic field. However, during unusually strong flares, protons can be produced with sufficient energies to reach the Earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere around the north pole and south pole. Protons are charged particles and are therefore influenced by magnetic fields. When the energetic protons leave the Sun, they preferentially follow (or are guided by) the Sun's powerful magnetic field. When solar protons enter the Earth's magnetosphere where the magnetic fields are stronger than solar magnetic fields, they are guided by the Earth's magnetic field into the polar regions where the majority of the Earth's magnetic field lines enter and exit. Energetic protons that are guided into the polar regions collide with atmospheric constituents and release their energy through the process of ionization. The majority of the energy is extinguished in the extreme lower region of the ionosphere (around 50‚Äì80 km in altitude). This area is particularly important to ionospheric radio communications because this is the area where most of the absorption of radio signal energy occurs. The enhanced ionization produced by incoming energetic protons increases the absorption levels in the lower ionosphere and can have the effect of completely blocking all ionospheric radio communications through the polar regions. Such events are known as Polar Cap Absorption events (or PCAs). These events commence and last as long as the energy of incoming protons at approximately greater than 10 MeV (million electron volts) exceeds roughly 10 pfu (particle flux units or ) at geosynchronous satellite altitudes. The more severe proton events can be associated with geomagnetic storms that can cause widespread disruption to electrical grids. However, proton events themselves are not responsible for producing anomalies in power grids, nor are they responsible for producing geomagnetic storms. Power grids are only sensitive to fluctuations in the Earth's magnetic field. Extremely intense solar proton flares capable of producing energetic protons with energies in excess of 100 MeV can increase neutron count rates at ground levels through secondary radiation effects. These rare events are known as Ground Level Enhancements(or GLEs). Some events produce large amounts of HZE ions, although their contribution to the total radiation is small compared to the level of protons.Contribution of High Charge and Energy (HZE) Ions During Solar-Particle Event of September 29, 1989 Kim, Myung-Hee Y.; Wilson, John W.; Cucinotta, Francis A.; Simonsen, Lisa C.; Atwell, William; Badavi, Francis F.; Miller, Jack, NASA Johnson Space Center; Langley Research Center, May 1999. High altitude commercial transpolar aircraft flights have measured increases in radiation during energetic proton events, but a warning system is in place that limits these effects by alerting pilots to lower their cruising altitudes. Aircraft flights away from the polar regions are far less likely to see an impact from solar proton events. Significant proton radiation exposure can be experienced by astronauts who are outside of the protective shield of the Earth's magnetosphere, such as an astronaut in-transit to, or located on the Moon. However, the effects can be minimized if astronauts are in a low- Earth orbit and remain confined to the most heavily shielded regions of their spacecraft. Proton radiation levels in low earth orbit increase with orbital inclination. Therefore, the closer a spacecraft approaches the polar regions, the greater the exposure to energetic proton radiation will be. When energetic protons strike the sensitive optical electronics in spacecraft (such as star trackers and other cameras) flashes occur in the images being captured. The effect can be so pronounced that during extreme events, it is not possible to obtain quality images of the Sun or stars. This can cause spacecraft to lose their orientation, which is critical if ground controllers are to maintain control. Energetic proton storms can also electrically charge spacecraft to levels that can damage electronic components. They can also cause electronic components to behave erratically. For example, solid state memory on spacecraft can be altered, which may cause data or software contamination and result in unexpected (phantom) spacecraft commands being executed. Energetic proton storms also destroy the efficiency of the solar panels that are designed to collect and convert sunlight to electricity. During years of exposure to energetic proton activity from the Sun, spacecraft can lose a substantial amount of electrical power that may require important instruments to be turned off.

Her father died when she was young and, in order to help her mother, she did not go to primary school. However, despite the difficulties, she learned to read and write. At the age of 18, she married Manuel Ramos Fernandes Cabete, who encouraged her to study. At the age of twenty-two, Cabete took the primary education exam, and in 1894 she completed her high school diploma with distinction. In 1895, the couple moved to Lisbon. The following year, Adelaide Cabete enrolled at the (Medical-Surgical School of Lisbon), concluding her course in 1900 with the thesis \\"Protection of poor pregnant women as a means of promoting the physical development of new generations\\", in which she proposed the introduction of maternity leave. She was only the third woman to receive a medical degree in Portugal and went on to open her own Gynaecology practice in Lisbon. She became a prominent voice in the support of maternity hospitals in Portugal, finally succeeding in 1932 when Portugal‚Äôs first maternity hospital was opened. Activism In 1907 Cabete became a freemason, joining the Grand Orient of Portugal Lodge. In 1909, together with Ana de Castro Os√≥rio, Carolina Beatriz √Çngelo and other feminists who supported the Republican cause, she became one of the founders of the Republican League of Portuguese Women, which both sought the end of the Portuguese monarchy and advocated for women's emancipation and suffrage. As a militant republican, like her husband, she actively participated in the propaganda that preceded the regime change on 5 October 1910. After the regime change, she worked to set up several women‚Äôs organizations, most notably the Conselho Nacional das Mulheres Portuguesas (National Council of Portuguese Women), of which she would be president from 1914 to her death in 1935. From 1920-29 she also edited the Council‚Äôs bulletin, Alma feminina. She helped organise the first two feminist congresses held in Portugal, in 1924 and 1928. She wrote many articles, primarily of a medical nature, but also in line with her social concerns. These included: \\"Role that the Study of Childcare, Feminine Hygiene, etc. must play in Domestic Education\\" (1913), and \\"Protection of Pregnant Women\\" (1924). She also wrote feminist articles in Alma feminina and elsewhere. She advocated sex education for children in schools, and spoke out against bullfighting and against the use of war toys. At the first feminist congress in 1924 she presented a paper on \\"The situation of married women regarding the couple‚Äôs property\\". For the time, her ideas were very progressive. In 1929, disillusioned with the authoritarian Estado Novo government, accompanied by her nephew, Cabete went to Portuguese Angola, where she worked to defend the rights of indigenous people and to provide medical treatment. In 1934 she was injured in a firearm accident and decided to return to Lisbon. There, with her health still poor, she suffered a fall and broke a leg. She died in Lisbon on 14 September 1935.

Seeing the potential this event gave to the village, a local land owner called James Renwick Abbs decided to build a hotel in the village. The site he chose was only 200 yards from the new station. It opened for business in 1899 and then had 34 bedrooms. =Golf course= The Links golf course Abbs also contacted John Henry Taylor the professional golfer. Taylor was one of the pioneers of the modern game of golf. He was also a significant golf course architect and Abbs asked Taylor to design a new golf course for his guests to enjoy, on the land adjacent to the new hotel. The nine-hole golf course opened in 1903. In 1906 Taylor extends course to 18 holes which circles around nearby Incleborough Hill. Finally in 1912 Abbs purchased a clubhouse pavilion from Sheringham Golf Club and this was erected next to the hotel. =World War II= After the start of World War II in 1939 the hotel and golf course were commandeered by the British Army. Troops were billeted in the hotel and the golf course was used for final troop training and as a firing range. After the war the golf course was reinstated and Bobby Locke participated in the opening game.

It reasons that by adopting contemplative (e.g. meditative) disciplines related to Spirit and commissioning them within a context of broad science, that \\"the spiritual, subjective world of ancient wisdom\\" could be joined \\"with the objective, empirical world of modern knowledge\\". The text further contends that integrating science and religion in this way would in turn, \\"have political dimensions sewn into its very fabric\\". Importance Underscoring how important the relationship between science and religion is to our unfolding world, Wilber explains that science \\"has given us the methods for discovering truth, while religion is the force that generates meaning\\". To illustrate this point, the author enlists his AQAL model to show how varying understandings of Spirit, from romanticism to idealism through postmodernism have over time, predicated humanity's own development in relation to the Big Three cultural value spheres of art (Upper Left quadrant), morals (Lower Left quadrant), and science (Right hand quadrants). Overview=Part I: The Problem= As Roger Walsh notes in his review of the book, although there's \\"enormous variation from one religion to another there is also wide agreement\\" among academics that the Great Chain of Being can be found \\"at the center of virtually all major religions\\". Also, and because \\"the Great Chain of Being was\\" at one time \\"humankind's dominant worldview\\", \\"with the rise of modernity the West became the first civilization in history\\" to discard it. In recognizing that \\"each senior dimension\\" of the Great Chain actually envelopes or enfolds \\"its junior\\" in a manner said to \\"transcend and include\\" the previous stage however, Wilber appropriates the term 'Great Nest of Being' in visualizing \\"a series of concentric spheres or circles\\" as a holarchy reaching from matter to mind to Spirit. This three-level scheme subsequently \\"show(s) up as the hierarchy of earth, human, and heaven\\" in \\"even the earliest shamanic traditions\\", and subsequently reappears with \\"the Hindu and Buddhist notion of the three great states of being: gross (matter and body), subtle (mind and soul), and causal (spirit)\\" [emphasis in original]. Furthermore, where \\"the standard position of most classical religions and the religions of antiquity\\" had viewed science as \\"but one of several valid modes of knowing\\" having \\"an important and rightful place in the Great Chain of Being\\" alongside \\"theology and mysticism\\", this point of view \\"is now generally called epistemological pluralism\\". This perspective though too, according to Wilber, \\"was given perhaps its clearest statement by such Christian mystics as St. Bonaventure and Hugh of St. Victor: every human being has the eye of flesh, the eye of mind, and the eye of contemplation\\" [emphasis added]. As Wilber notes however, the underlying 'problem' as posed has been further obfuscated by a set of 'new paradigms' which \\"in effect replace the eye of contemplation with the eyes of mind and flesh\\". Consequently, he further clarifies that \\"the eye of flesh is monological; the eye of mind is dialogical; and the eye of contemplation is translogical\\" [emphasis added]. Likewise, but along with the Enlightenment, an entire set of values including \\"equality, freedom, and justice; representational and deliberative democracy, the equality of all citizens before the law; regardless of race, sex, or creed; political and civil rights (freedom of speech, religion, assembly, fair trial, etc.)\\"; all, gradually emerged. As a result, and because they'd \\"existed nowhere\\" on a large scale in \\"the premodern world\\", Wilber refers to these values and rights \\"as the dignity of modernity\\" [emphasis in original]. Subsequently, then, but pointing to the work of Max Weber and J√ºrgen Habermas, the book further contends that 'modernity' is chiefly defined by its \\"differentiation of the cultural value spheres\\" or the Big Three; \\"art, morals, and science; the Beautiful, the Good, and the True\\"; I (Upper Left quadrant), WE (Lower Left quadrant), and IT (Right hand quadrants) [emphasis added]. Yet, where this modern differentiation could be said to have begun \\"in earnest around the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\\", \\"by the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth the differentiation was already drifting into a painful and pathological dissociation\\". Consequently, but in just this way, the Left-Hand or interior dimensions were ultimately \\"reduced to their Right-Hand or exterior correlates which utterly collapsed the Great Chain of Being, and with it, the core claims of the great wisdom traditions\\" [emphasis added]. =Part II: Previous Attempts at Integration= Immanuel Kant Ascribing a recognition to Immanuel Kant of this \\"leveling and deadening of the modern monological collapse\\" however [emphasis added], Wilber chronicles the philosopher's subsequent attempt to integrate \\"moral we-wisdom with scientific it-knowledge\\" [emphasis added]. From this vantage point, Kant's Critique of Pure Reason is described as an affirmation that \\"science alone gives cognitive knowledge, \\"real\\" knowledge, and all else is nonsensical metaphysics.\\" Likewise, his second installment, Critique of Practical Reason ferreted humanity's moral dimensions in concluding that while \\"(m)en and women are not free as empirical objects‚Äîin the world of ITS . . . as ethical subjects, men and women are indeed autonomous\\" [emphasis in original]. Further pursuing this line of thought, but utilizing the moral rationale of \\"ought\\", Kant's third critique, Critique of Judgement begins by examining the realm of aesthetics in route to ascertaining; as Wilber paraphrases it, \\"that the interior \\"ought\\" of moral reasoning could never get going in the first place without the postulates of a transcendental Spirit\\". Consequently, but in the aftermath of Kant's contributions, the Romantics \\"began an intense effort to make the I-domain, the subjective domain‚Äîand especially the domain of aesthetics, sentiment, emotion, heroic self-expression, and feeling‚Äîthe royal road to Spirit and the Absolute\\". However, because \\"romanticism was a philosophical revolt against rationalism\\" the movement \\"fell violent prey to\\" what Wilber has termed, \\"the pre/trans fallacy [emphasis in original], namely, the confusion of prerational with transrational simply because both are nonrational\\" [emphasis added]. Similarly, there also existed an ambiguity \\"between premodern and modern cultures\\" as to \\"the direction in which the universe\\" was said to be unfolding. Where a \\"time of creation\\" as recounted amongst premodern religions often entailed \\"a Great Spirit of one sort or another\\" creating \\"the world out of itself, or out of some prima materia\\", these traditions also commonly point to \\"a series of strange events\\" in which it was told, \\"either God began slowly to withdraw from humans, or humans withdrew from this God\\"; but generally depicting scenarios in which mankind inevitably \\"lost touch with the primal Eden\\". Sometime during the modern era however, this \\"idea of history as devolution (or a fall from God) was slowly replaced by the idea of history as evolution (or a growth toward God)\\". Thus, where history for premodern cultures was merely devolution, \\"one of the great announcements of the Idealists\\" asserted that \\"cosmic and human history\\" instead, was \\"most profoundly the evolution and development of Spirit\\". Beginning then with Kant's assertion \\"that we can never know \\"the thing in itself\\", only the appearance or phenomenon that results when the thing in itself is acted on by the categories of the human mind\\" [emphasis added]; German Idealism shared much of its inception in \\"the notion that the world is not merely perceived but constructed.\\" [emphasis in original] For them, \\"(n)ot naive empiricism, but mental idealism,\\" was of essence in one's \\"perception of the world\\" [emphasis added]. In much this way, and to his credit, Johann Fichte is of special note in reasoning that \\"if you cannot know anything at all about the thing in itself\\" then ultimately, self-consciousness too is a social phenomena . Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Consequently, too, but in sublimating these same lines of thought, Wilber delineates three principal features of spiritual evolution: :1. Involution. This original \\"descent\\" of Spirit \\"is a forgetting, a fall, a self-alienation of Spirit\\". :2. Evolution. In this \\"second major stage of development, Spirit evolves from objective Nature to subjective Mind\\" [emphasis added]. :3. Nondual Spirit. Spirit comes to know \\"itself objectively as Nature; knows itself subjectively as Mind; and knows itself absolutely as Spirit‚Äîthe Source, the Summit, the Ground and the Process of the entire ordeal\\" [emphasis added]. Thus, he subsequently notes that \\"for both Schelling and Hegel, Spirit goes out of itself to produce objective Nature, awakens to itself in subjective Mind, then recovers itself in pure nondual Spirit, where subject and object are one pure act of nondual consciousness that unifies both Nature and Mind in realized Spirit\\" [emphasis added]. Unfortunately, yet underscoring Idealism's remarkable percipience in discerning \\"the integration of empirical evolution with transcendental Spirit\\" as reflecting \\"Spirit-in-action\\"; \\"it possessed no yoga‚Äîthat is, no tried and tested practice for reliably reproducing the transpersonal and superconscious insights that formed the very core of the great Idealist vision\\". Furthermore, and \\"because the Idealists lacked a genuine spiritual injunction (practice, exemplar, paradigm), they were indeed, at least in this respect, caught in \\"mere metaphysics\\"\\". Consequently then, and \\"lacking the means of consistently delivering direct spiritual experience‚ÄîIdealism in this regard degenerated into abstract speculations without the means of experiential confirmation or rejection\\" [emphasis in original]. Simply because \\"every holon has a Left- and a Right-Hand dimension, and therefore every holon without exception has an objective (Right) and an interpretive (Left) component\\" [emphasis added], postmodernism would ultimately assume \\"the great and nobel\\" aim of introducing \\"interpretation as an intrinsic aspect of the Kosmos\\" [emphasis in original]. Yet, and for \\"postmodernism, this moment of truth‚Äîevery actual occasion has an interpretive component‚Äîwas taken to absurd and self-defeating extremes\\" leading to a facile reasoning that since \\"(t)here is nothing but interpretation\\", dispensing \\"with the objective component of truth\\" at times, merely serves as practical convenience. Disconcertingly though, \\"(t)his extreme denial of any sort of objective truth\\" has subsequently amounted \\"to a denial of the Right-Hand quadrants altogether, precisely the reverse disaster of modernity\\" [emphasis in original]. For this reason perhaps, Wilber cites the relevance of three core assumptions which underlie postmodern expression in the form(s) of constructivism, contextualism, and integral-aperspectival as all, coming \\"to the fore with the linguistic turn\\" [emphasis added]. Similarly too, and crediting Jean Gebser for coining the term 'integral-aperspectival', Wilber further elucidates the word's meaning as a \\"pluralistic or multiple- perspectives view\\" privileging \\"no single perspective\\" but which in turn, affords \\"a more holistic or integral\\" vantage point. Enlisting the same term somewhat interchangeably with \\"vision-logic or network-logic\\" [emphasis in original], Wilber recognizes Ferdinand de Saussure for taking vision-logic and applying \\"it to language, thus disclosing, for the first time in history, its network structure.\\" Likewise, he further asserts \\"(t)he linguistic turn is, at bottom, vision-logic looking at language itself\\" [emphasis added]. Nonetheless, but \\"(s)tarting from the admirable reliance on vision-logic and integral-aperspectival awareness‚Äîyet still unable to escape the collapse of the Kosmos‚Äîthese postmodern movements ended up subtly embodying and even extending the reductionistic nightmare\\". Serving as an example of this, and referring to William H. Gass's, The Tunnel as epitomizing what many claim \\"to be the ultimate postmodern novel\\", Wilber voices accord with RobertAlter's view that the book's defining strategy is reflected through the manner in which \\"everything is deliberately reduced to the flattest surface.\\" Thus Gass's text is said to do this by \\"denying the possibility of making consequential distinctions between, or meaningful ranking of, moral or aesthetic values. There is no within: murderer and victim, lover and onanist, altruist and bigot, dissolve into the same ineluctable slime\\". Thus Wilber subsequently concludes that \\"under the intense gravity of flatland, integral- aperspectival awareness became simply aperspectival madness‚Äîthe contradictory belief that no belief is better than any other‚Äîa total paralysis of thought, will, and action in the face of a million perspectives all given exactly the same depth, namely, zero\\" [emphasis added]. =Part III: A Reconciliation= Tiffany window Education (1890). Consequently, and because \\"(a) modern and postmodern spirituality has continued to elude us,\\" Wilber poses his vision for a spirituality capable of standing \\"up to scientific authority . . . by announcing its own means and modes, data and evidence, validates and verifications\\". Along these same lines, the author subsequently outlines what he regards as empirical science's two primary objections to an integration of science and religion: :* That \\"there are no irreducible interior domains that can be studied by different modes of knowing, there are only objective ITS (atomistic or holistic) studied best by science. In short, interior domains have no reality of their own; thus there are no \\"interior\\" modes of knowing that cannot be explained away, literally.\\" :* \\"Even if there were other modes of knowing than the sensory-empirical, they would have no mean of validation and thus could not be taken seriously.\\" In addressing the first objection Wilber reasons that if \\"empirical science rejects the validity of any and all forms of interior apprehension and knowledge, then it\\" must also reject \\"its own validity as well\\". This is so because \\"a great deal\\" of this knowledge itself, already \\"rests on interior structures and apprehensions that are not delivered by\\" and hence can't be confirmed by, \\"the senses (such as logic and mathematics, to name only two).\\" Likewise, \\"(i)f science acknowledges these interior apprehensions, upon which its own operations depend, then it cannot object to interior knowledge per se. It cannot toss all interiors into the garbage can without tossing itself with it.\\" Similarly, Wilber asserts \\"(o)bjection number 2 can be answered by showing that the scientific method, in general consists of three basic strands of knowing (injunction, apprehension, confirmation/rejection). If it can be shown that the genuine interior modes of knowing also follow these same three strands, then objection number 2 . . . would be substantially refuted\\" [emphasis in original]. In this way, and \\"(w)ith the two major scientific objections to the interior domains undone\\", \\"a genuine reconciliation of science and religion (and the Big Three in general)\\" is afforded practical viability [emphasis added]. For these reasons, Wilber subsequently deduces that \\"sensory empiricism\\" cannot be included as one of \\"the defining characteristics of the scientific method\\", arguing that the \\"defining patterns of scientific knowledge\\" instead, \\"must be able to embrace both biology and mathematics, both geology and anthropology, both physics and logic‚Äîsome of which are sensory-empirical, some of which are not.\\" In this same regard however, he notes \\"there is sensory empiricism (of the sensorimotor world)\\" or empiricism in the narrow sense, \\"mental empiricism (including logic, mathematics, semiotics, phenomenology, and hermeneutics), and spiritual empiricism (experiential mysticism, spiritual experiences)\\" or empiricism in the broad sense. \\"In other words, there is evidence seen by the eye of flesh (e.g., intrinsic features of the sensorimotor world), evidence seen by the eye of mind (e.g., mathematics and logic and symbolic interpretations), and evidence seen by the eye of contemplation (e.g., satori, nirvikalpa samadhi, gnosis)\\" [emphasis in original]. 1579 drawing of the Great Chain of Being from Didacus Valad√©s, Rhetorica Christiana. Wilber then outlines what he states as believing \\"are three of the essential aspects of scientific inquiry\\"; referring to them as the \\"three strands of all valid knowing\\": :1. Instrumental injunction. \\"This is an actual practice, an exemplar, a paradigm, an experiment, an ordinance. It is always of the form \\"If you want to know this, do this.\\" :2. Direct apprehension. \\"This is an immediate experience of the domain brought forth by the injunction; that is, a direct experience or apprehension of data (even if the data is mediated, at the moment of experience it is immediately apprehended).\\" :3. Communal confirmation (or rejection). \\"This is a checking of the results‚Äîthe data, the evidence‚Äîwith others who have adequately completed the injunctive and apprehensive strands\\" [emphasis added]. Advocating that science \\"expand from narrow empiricism (sensory experience only) to broad empiricism (direct experience in general) [emphasis added], Wilber similarly reasons that religion too \\"must open its truth claims to direct verification‚Äîor rejection‚Äîby experiential evidence.\\" He subsequently asserts that \\"(r)eligion, like science, will have to engage the three strands of all valid knowledge and anchor its claims in direct experience\\" [emphasis added]. Likewise, Wilber contends that \\"in the modern and postmodern world\\", religion \\"will rest on its unique strength‚Äînamely, contemplation\\" or serve to merely \\"support a premodern, predifferentiated level of development in its own adherents: not (as) an engine of growth and transformation, but (as) a regressive, antiliberal, reactionary force of lesser engagements\\". He subsequently observes that \\"(i)f religion possesses something that is uniquely its own, it is contemplation\\" [emphasis in original]. Moreover, though, \\"it is the eye of contemplation adequately employed, that follows all three strands of valid knowing\\" [emphasis added]. \\"Thus religion's great, enduring, and unique strength is that, at its core, it is a science of spiritual experience (using \\"science\\" in the broad sense as direct experience, in any domain, that submits to the three strands of injunction, data, and falsifiability)\\" [emphasis in original]. In this same way, but \\"namely, to find some scheme that could accommodate both premodern and modern worldviews, and thus integrate religion and science\\"; because \\"the core of premodern religion was the Great Chain, and since the essence of modernity was the differentiation of the value spheres (the Big Three or the four quadrants)\\" [emphasis added], Wilber's text claims to accomplish a reintegration of religion and science by conjoining \\"the Great Chain with the four quadrants\\" [emphasis in original]. =Part IV: The Path Ahead= Wilber similarly notes however, that \\"(w)hat needs to be integrated is not the dissociations but the differentiations of modernity, for not only do these define the dignity of modernity [emphasis added], they are an irreversible part of the evolutionary process of differentiation-and- integration\\" [emphasis in original]. Also, but by virtue of the likelihood that this \\"future evolution\\" proves to be a \\"process of collectively unfolding the yet higher stages of the Great Chain, as it has already unfolded the lower\\", Wilber envisions too that \\"real religion‚Äîgenuine spirituality and the deep sciences of the interior\\" could subsequently serve \\"an unprecedented role as the vanguard of evolution, the growing tip of the universal organism, growing toward its own highest potentials, namely, the ever-unfolding realization and actualization of Spirit [emphasis added]\\". For this reason too, and because \\"(t)raditional conservatism is \\"in many ways\\" adduced as being \\"anchored in premodern worldviews . . . whereas liberalism is largely anchored in the rational differentiations of modernity\\", Wilber envisages an integration of religion and science as opening \\"up the possibility of a significant reconciliation of conservative and liberal views\\". Prospects for this harmonization are further expressed as the means by which transrational awareness [emphasis added], \\"standing within the political freedom‚Äîthe liberal freedom‚Äîoffered by the Enlightenment . . . moves into its own higher estate by pursuing Spiritual Enlightenment, which it then offers, within that same political freedom, to any and all who desire to be released from the chains of space and time, self and suffering, hope and fear, death and wonder\\" [emphasis in original]. This \\"politics of meaning\\" then, in \\"its own spiritual realization\\" is \\"thoroughly transliberal, bringing together the Enlightenment of the East with the Enlightenment of the West\\" [emphasis added]. Criticism Reflecting an array of impassioned thought concerning a demarcation problem in the relationship between religion and science, The Marriage of Sense and Soul has spawned a range of intellectual response; both affirming and derogatory. Included among these many views was that of Dutch author Frank Visser who published an article addressing the book's detractors. From his perspective, Wilber's tome had \\"alarmed several critics, not too familiar with [the author's] works\\" even though (or perhaps, because) it represents \\"a view of reality which is large enough to absorb ANY conclusion of science‚Äîbe it natural, human or spiritual‚Äîwithout giving science the last word\\" [emphasis added]. In response to Visser's piece, Wilber drafted a reply of his own saying that his \\"critics have completely missed\\" one \\"simple but essential point\\"; that was, by assuming \\"that in expanding science to include the higher realms\\", they'd inferred he was \\"somehow reducing the higher realms to science.\\" This misconception is negated in the fact however, that \\"even with an expanded definition of science\\", he never reduces \\"the higher realms to science only, for there are the art and morals and science of the higher realms. And the art and morals have different specific methodologies than the sciences, as\\" he'd already explained in length [emphasis added].

He previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies in and and the LG Twins of the KBO League. High school Joseph attended Horizon High School in Scottsdale, Arizona, where he played for the school's baseball team. A first baseman in his first three years of high school, Joseph became a catcher in his senior year. In 2009, he was named the Arizona high school player of the year. Professional career=Minor Leagues= The San Francisco Giants selected Joseph in the second round, with the 55th overall selection, of the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft as a catcher and first baseman. In 2010, Joseph was named a South Atlantic League all-star for his performance with the Augusta GreenJackets. He suffered a concussion during the 2010 season. The Giants invited Joseph to spring training in 2011. Joseph played for the Richmond Flying Squirrels of the Class AA Eastern League in 2012, and appeared in the All-Star Futures Game that year. =Philadelphia Phillies= During the 2012 season, the Giants traded Joseph with Nate Schierholtz and Seth Rosin to the Philadelphia Phillies for Hunter Pence. The Phillies assigned Joseph to the Reading Fightin Phils of the Eastern League. After the 2012 season, he was assigned to the Peoria Javelinas of the Arizona Fall League (AFL), and participated in the AFL Rising Stars Game. Joseph played in 36 games in the 2013 season due to a concussion. The Phillies added him to their 40-man roster on November 20, 2013, to protect him from being exposed to the Rule 5 draft. Joseph suffered a wrist injury in 2014 which limited him to 27 games played, and required season ending surgery. Joseph began the 2015 season with the Lehigh Valley IronPigs of the Class AAA International League, where he suffered his third concussion in May 2015. Due to the concussions, the Phillies converted him into a first baseman. After posting a .347 average and a .611 slugging percentage in the first 27 games of the 2016 season, the Phillies promoted Joseph from Lehigh Valley to the major leagues on May 13, 2016. He hit his first major league home run on May 17. On June 1, Phillies manager Pete Mackanin announced his plans to give Joseph extended playing time at first base and keep the slumping veteran Ryan Howard on the bench. Joseph officially supplanted Howard as the everyday first baseman on June 10, and he punctuated the move by hitting his sixth and seventh home runs of the season that day, with Mackanin calling Joseph \\"the real deal\\". In 2017, Joseph batted .240 with a .289 on-base percentage. After the 2017 season, the Phillies acquired Carlos Santana to play first base. On March 12, 2018, Joseph was designated for assignment. =Texas Rangers= On March 19, 2018, the Texas Rangers claimed Joseph off of waivers. He was designated for assignment on March 29. He cleared waivers and was outrighted to the Class AA Frisco RoughRiders. He declared free agency on October 2. =LG Twins= On November 28, 2018, Joseph signed a one-year, $1 million contract with the LG Twins of the KBO League. Joseph was waived by the Twins on July 9, 2019. =Boston Red Sox= On August 5, 2019, Joseph signed a minor league contract with the Boston Red Sox, and was assigned to the Gulf Coast League Red Sox. =Team Texas= In July 2020, Joseph signed on to play for Team Texas of the Constellation Energy League (a makeshift 4-team independent league created as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic) for the 2020 season.

She was the first woman to gain tenure in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Yale University, and subsequently the first woman to be appointed a full professor in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Yale. Wright's influential 1957 monograph, The Last Stand of Chinese Conservatism, argued that the mid-19th century T'ung Chih (Tongzhi) Restoration failed because \\"the requirements of modernization ran counter to the requirements of Confucian stability.\\" She was married to historian Arthur F. Wright. Biography Wright was born Mary Oliver Clabaugh on September 25, 1917, in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. She attended Ramsay High School in Birmingham, Alabama. In 1934 she received a scholarship to Vassar College at Poughkeepsie, New York. After graduating in 1938, she went to Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to study European history, but she was attracted by John K. Fairbank to investigate modern Chinese history instead. Fairbank recalled that when he first met her, \\"she seemed \\"at first glance tall, smooth and beautiful, a bit shy, with a soft southern accent,\\" but \\"at second glance not so smooth as sharp, a summa from Vassar, tremendously quick and a ferocious worker, racing to keep up with her imagination.\\" She received her Master of Arts in 1939. On July 6, 1940 she married Arthur F. Wright, who was a graduate student studying Chinese and Japanese history at Harvard University, and the two of them immediately went to Asia to carry out research for their PhDs. For the first year they stayed in Kyoto, Japan, and then in June 1941 they moved to Beijing, China. The pair were caught in China as a result of World War II, and in March 1943 they were interned in the Weixian Internment Camp in Shandong (modern Weifang city). He coaxed fire from dirty coal in the boiler room; she did the hospital laundry. She took advantage of the opportunity to learn Russian. They remained until liberated by American paratroopers in October 1945. At the end of the war the Wrights decided to remain in China to further their research. Based in Beijing, they traveled throughout China and met important figures, including Mao Zedong. They also became representatives of the Hoover Library, helping to gather a wide range of material for the library (Mary was mainly responsible for these collection activities). Fairbank characterized her style as \\"accumulating an avalanche of bits and pieces, mixed rarities and handouts; sorting and listing and getting them properly packed actually shipped, meanwhile keeping all in mind and communicating the results.\\" In 1947 they returned to America, and while her husband joined the faculty at Stanford University, Mary accepted an appointment as curator of the China collection at the Hoover Library at Stanford. She obtained her PhD in 1951 from Radcliffe College, with her dissertation on the Tongzhi Restoration (1862‚Äì1874). In 1959 Arthur and Mary Wright both accepted positions as associate professors in the history department at Yale University. Mary's appointment made her the first woman to gain tenure in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Yale University. Fairbank recalled that she defended Owen Lattimore in the 1950s and denounced American bombings of Vietnam in the 1960s. In 1964 she became the first woman to be appointed to a full professorship in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Yale. She was responsible for founding the Society for Ch'ing Studies and its journal, Ch'ing-Shih Wen-T'i. She died at home in Guilford, Connecticut, of lung cancer, aged 52, on June 18, 1970. She and Arthur had two sons, Charles Duncan Wright (born 1950) and Jonathan Arthur Wright (born 1952). Legacy The historian Paul A. Cohen in his Discovering History in China notes that Wright, Teng Ssu-yu, Albert Feuerwerker, and Joseph R. Levenson, all students of Fairbank in the decade following the war, were leaders in promoting the paradigm embodied in \\"China's Response to the West.\\" He praises but critiques Wright's The Last Stand of Chinese Conservatism (1957), a study of the Tongzhi Restoration. He quotes Wright that \\"the Restoration failed because the requirements of modernization ran counter to the requirements of Confucian stability,\\" then questions the \\"viability of the very terms\\" in which Wright's argument is set.

He is known for his work on the Carthusian monastery of Champmol for Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy at a time when the Burgundy became a major cultural centre of Europe. Virgin and child, detail of the portal, Chartreuse de Champmol, Dijon, Burgundy, France Portal of the Chartreuse Champmol, Dijon, Claus Sluter Origins From his name it appears that Jean de Marville originated in Marville in what is now the department of Meuse, in northern France. At that time Marville was in Burgundy. Some say that he was Flemish. He is also known by the names Hennequin or Hannequin de Marvile, Jan van Mergem, Jehan de Marville or de Mervile. Career The Jean or Hennequin de Marville who worked on the tomb of Philip the Bold has been identified with the Jean de Menreville who was named in 1366 as working on the church of Saint-Pierre at Lille. He is named as working in Rouen Cathedral in 1369, where he helped decorate the chapel of the king's heart at the command of King Charles V of France. He joined the service of Philip the Bold on 22 January 1372 as ymagier et valet de chambre de Monseigneur. The next year he moved to Dijon on the command of the Duke. An account from 27 January 1377 records the purchase of 26 pounds of ivory for Mainreville, tailleur de menues oeuvres. Based on this an ivory figure of the Trinity in the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston may be attributed to him. Jean de Marville created an important school of sculpture. Claus Sluter was the most noted member. Sluter's nephew Claus de Werve was another member of this school. Lesser sculptors of this school were Jehan de la Huerta and Antoine le Moiturier. Claus Sluter (c. 1360 - 1405), a sculptor from Harlem in the Netherlands, joined Jean de Marville's studio in 1383. At that time de Marville was directing the construction and decoration of the Chartreuse of Champanol, which was to be the Duke's burial place. The image of the virgin and child in the center pillar of the monastery's chapel is attributed to either Marville or Sluter. On 29 March 1381 Marville was charged by the Duke with making an alabaster sepulcher for him in Dijon, and the work was started in October 1384. Sluter succeeded Jean de Marville as ymagier when he died in 1389. There seems little doubt that the bulk of the work was done by Sluter, or under Sluter's direction, since it was not completed until 1404. The tomb is unusual in being decorated with free- standing statues of monks, clergy and laity rather than the conventional relief figures. This concept may have been Marville's, but could have been a change introduced by Sluter when he took charge of completing the project.

The Supreme Council of the Royal Arcanum, commonly known simply as the Royal Arcanum, is a fraternal benefit society founded in 1877 in Boston, Massachusetts by John A. Cummings and Darius Wilson, who had previously been among the founders of the Knights of Honor, a similar organization, in Kentucky.Royal Arcanum - A proud history of service! royalarcanum.com The Royal Arcanum home office is located in Boston, Massachusetts.  History  The Royal Arcanum was found by Dr. Darius Wilson, who had also played a prominent role in the foundation of the Knights of Honor, American Legion of Honor and the Royal Society of Good Fellows, as well as being a prominent official in the Order of United American Mechanics, Ancient Order of United Workmen, a Freemason and an Oddfellow.Sackett, Myron Ward, 1841-Early history of fraternal beneficiary societies in America Meadville, Pa., The Tribune publishing company p.220 For three years he had tried to convince the knights to adopt a graded assessment plan, but to no avail. Therefore, he decided to create his own society that would work on the plan. To make sure he would have control over the direction of the group, he wrote its ritual, constitution, beneficial plan, passwords and even designed the organization's emblem himself. On June 23, 1877, he called together a group of his friends at 1066 Washington Street, Boston and initiated them as the first Supreme Council of the new order. Among the other participants was J. A. Cummings, at that time Grand Vice Dictator of the Knight of Honor in Massachusetts, who was offered, but refused, the post of Supreme Regent of the Royal Arcanum.Sackett p.227  Organization  The structure of the Royal Arcanum follows a three tiered system. Local groups are called \\"Subordinate Councils\\" or \\"Councils\\" which consist of at least 16 members who meet the qualifications of its elective officers.Royal Arcanum Constitution Part III Section 179 p.39 Five Councils in a given state, territory, Canadian province or any two of the same, with at least 1,000 members may petition the Supreme Council for institution as a \\"Grand Council\\".Royal Arcanum Constitution Part II Section 148 p.31 The highest authority is the biennial Supreme Council.Arcanum Constitution Part I Section 1, Section 3 p.5-6 This basic organizational structure has not changed substantially since the nineteenth century, nor has the group's headquarters moved from Boston.Stevens, Albert C.

B. Treat and Company, New York 1899 p.186Schmidt, Alvin J. Fraternal Organizations Westport, CT; Greenwood Press pp.294  Membership  The RA's membership requirements have varied over time. In the early stages of its existence it was confined to \\"acceptable\\" men between eighteen and fifty five years old.Stevens p.186 It also required its members to believe in a Supreme Being and state that \\"Mongolians, whether of pure or of mixed blood, no matter what they believe, are ineligible.\\" These restrictions have been removed.Alan Axelrod International Encyclopedia of Secret Societies and Fraternal Orders New York; Facts on File, inc 1997 p.216 For a while the RA had a female auxiliary called the Loyal Ladies of the Royal Arcanum, founded in 1909. This group was recognized by the main order in 1923.Axelrod p.216 There was also a group called the Loyal Additional Benefit Association, which operated as a kind of side degree open only to members of the RA. It was founded in 1889 and incorporated in New Jersey the next year. By the mid 1890s it had a membership of 6,000 and offered $1,000 and $2,000 certificates, as well as funds for sick and distressed members.Stevens p.187 The order was successful in acquiring new members in the early decades of its existence. Its annual report of April 23, 1878 noted that the organization had 2,781 member in 82 Councils spread out across Massachusetts, Maine, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Virginia, Georgia and Ontario, Canada; there were also petitions for the formation of Councils in Kansas, Illinois, California, and New Hampshire.Sackett p.228 By 1896 it had in excess of 200,000 members.Stevens p.186 In 1919 the order had over 135,000 members. This declined to 36,000 in 1965, 28,000 in 1979Schmidt p.293, 28,111 members in 1994.Axelrod p.216  Benefits  As stated, the order worked on the graded assessment system at its inception. The Supreme Council administered death benefits, called the Widows and Orphans Benefit Fund, paying out over $40 million by the mid-1890s in $1,500 and $3,000 certificates. Sick and disability benefits were administered by the Subordinate Councils. However, with increasing assessments in 1896, the order switched from the graded assessment modal to an actuarial modal at its Supreme Council in Cleveland in 1898 and went into effect August 1 of that year. The new system based the benefits on 21 separate assessments collected in twelve different payments yearly. Eighteen of these covered mortality costs, one the \\"war danger,\\" and two for an emergency fund.Stevens pp.186-7 By the 1970s this system had been modernized, somewhat, and the benefit categories were listed as \\"Death, Disability, Old Age Benefits, Educational Loans, Retirement Income Annuities and Weekly Hospital Indemnity Benefits.\\" In the 1970s the Society awarded scholarships to high school students who had been members of the RA for three years. Scholarships are awarded to RA orphans, and student loans were also given available.Schmidt pp.293-4  Ritual  Even as late as the 1970s, the order put a good deal of emphasis on its ritual. It was described at that time as being quite elaborate, and made use of the number 1105, which had a sort of esoteric meaning to the members of the order. It required members to take lengthy oath or obligation at the time of initiation. The order's motto is \\"Mercy, Virtue, Charity\\".Schmidt p.293  Legal history  Royal Arcanum has been on one side or the other of three rulings by the Supreme Court of the United States, in each having to do with benefits offered by the Council: *Wishart v.

He started out with instrumental band the Strangers in Bethnal Green, East London, in the summer of 1961. In 1963 Waller adopted the name Mickey Finn ‚Äì after having heard about the drummer named Micky Waller ‚Äì and joined with John \\"Fluff\\" Cooke (keyboards), John Burkett (bass), Alan Marks (lead vocals) and Richard Brand (drums) to form \\"Mickey Finn & the Blue Men\\", who released their debut single in January 1964. Jimmy Page recorded with the band over the following months. With Burkett replaced by first Mick Stannard in late 1965 and then Rod Clark, the band were renamed \\"The Mickey Finn\\" in 1966.

Reverting to his original name (percussionist Mickey Finn had by then become famous as a member of T.Rex), Waller played guitar with Sam Gopal (1969‚Äì70) and the Heavy Metal Kids (1972‚Äì74), before relocating to France and becoming a sought-after session musician.

He represented the 146th District from 2013 until 2015. The district is located in Montgomery County, including Limerick Township, Lower Pottsgrove Township, Perkiomen Township, Trappe, Royersford, and parts of Pottstown. Early life Mark Painter was born in Stowe, Pennsylvania and graduated from Pottsgrove High School in 1974. He then attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned degrees in electrical engineering and law, graduating in 1978. After his two sons were diagnosed with autism, Painter became concerned with the lack of access to special education programs. Along with his wife, he helped organize parents of special needs children to help develop new programs for students with autism. This experience led Mark into the field of special education law, where he represented parents advocating for better services from their school districts. From 1998 to 2012, Painter served almost four terms as tax collector for Limerick Township, until he was elected to the House. He attends St. James Lutheran Church in Limerick, where he has also taught Sunday School. He is a lifetime member of the Limerick Historical Society, and serves on the board of directors of the Royersford Free Public Library and Royersford Community Chest. Political career In 2010, Painter unsuccessfully ran for the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in the 146th District against the incumbent Tom Quigley, by a margin of 56%‚Äì44%. In 2012, Painter again challenged Quigley, this time winning the seat 50.4%‚Äì49.7%. Mark Painter was defeated in his re-election bid in 2014, losing to former state representative Tom Quigley by a margin of 52%‚Äì48%. While serving as a state representative, Painter made property tax reform a priority. He was a co-sponsor of House Bill 76 to eliminate property taxes in Pennsylvania and replace them with increases in the income and sales taxes, and also voted in favor of that change. Painter had also introduced legislation to expand the property tax rebate program for seniors, including HB 2215 to allow families to deduct property taxes from their income for eligibility in the property tax rebate program, and HB 2214 to allow seniors to receive up to 15 percent of their paid property taxes back through the property tax rebate program. He also supported increased state funding for education as a means to lower local property taxes. Painter introduced the Pennsylvania Pregnant Workers Fairness Act to prohibit workplace discrimination against pregnant women and women with newborn children and proposed two amendments that would add protections to the Landlord and Tenant Act for tenants who are victims of domestic violence. He also supported increased state funding for education and opposed heavily relying on local property taxes. During his term as state representative, Painter served on the Agriculture & Rural Affairs, Human Services, Local Government, Commerce, and Policy committees. Other ventures Since September 2015 Painter has been hosting and producing a podcast on the history of the twentieth century, taking an interdisciplinary approach that includes both politics but also culture, literature, religion and art.https://historyofthetwentiethcentury.com Personal life Painter lives in Limerick Township with his wife Coleen. They have two biological children and two foster children from Southeast Asia.

There he married Margaret Dongan, a judge's daughter, whom he portrayed lovingly in his book The Character of a Truly Virtuous and Pious Woman.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol.1 p.340 He was the brother of Gerard Boate, author of The Natural History of Ireland, for which Arnold supplied much of the material. Both Gerard and Arnold were members of the Hartlib circle. Background Born Arnold de Boot in Gorinchem in the Netherlands, he was a younger son of the Dutch knight Godfried de Boot (c.1570-1625) and his wife Christine van Loon.Gilbert, p.283 Like his brother he attended the University of Leiden and qualified as a doctor of medicine. He also developed a deep interest in Hebrew studies and in particular the correct reading of the Old Testament. His first book, co-written with Francis Taylor and entitled Examen Praefationis Morini in Biblia Graeca de Textus Ebraici et Graeci authoritate was published in Leiden in 1630.Gilbert p.283 Career He and his brother Gerard moved to London about 1630 to practice medicine. It was said that they became involved in a dispute with the Royal College of Physicians, but Arnold was lucky enough to become personal physician to Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester.Gilbert p.283 Leicester was later appointed Lord Deputy of Ireland and, though he never actually went to Ireland, he may have recommended Arnold to his Irish friends. Arnold's writings had already brought him to the attention of James Ussher, Archbishop of Armagh, and it was Ussher who invited Arnold to Ireland in 1636.Gilbert p.283 He became Ussher's personal physician, and was later appointed Surgeon-General to the Irish Army. He also built up a flourishing private practice among the Dutch community in Dublin. In 1641 Gerard and Arnold co-wrote Philosophia Naturalis Reformata, an attack upon Aristotelianism. Arnold's experience as an army doctor also led him to write Diverse remarkable passages .. of our Army in Ireland (1642) and Observationes medicae de affectibus a veteribus omissis (1649). His marriage, which was a love match, to Margaret Dongan, daughter of Thomas Dongan, judge of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland) and his first wife Grace Palmer strengthened his ties with the Irish Protestant ruling class, although his father-in-law, according to Elrington Ball, was not much respected, partly because he was known to be a Roman Catholic who conformed to the Protestant faith only for the purpose of his career.Ball p.340 Arnold however wrote of Dongan in his memoir of Margaret with affection and respect. Dongan was a wealthy man, but suffered heavy losses during the Irish Rebellion of 1641.Ball p,340 In 1644 Arnold decided to quit Ireland. He moved briefly to stay with his brother in London but then settled permanently in Paris. Much of his later career was spent in scholarly dispute with Louis Capel, who had questioned his Biblical readings and the result was a lengthy pamphlet war, involving several scholars on both sides, including Ussher.Gilbert p.283 Like his brother he was a member of the Hartlib Circle, the circle of scholars who corresponded with Samuel Hartlib on scientific, religious and political issues, and he is credited with having established the Irish branch of the circle; even after he left Ireland he acted as a conduit between Hartlib and Ussher. Gerard's most famous work The Natural History of Ireland was written , at Hartlib's suggestion, from material collected by Arnold.Gilbert p.283 After Gerard's death in 1650 Hartlib suggested that Arnold continue the work, but Arnold himself died in Paris in 1653. Family On Christmas Day 1642 Arnold married Margaret Dongan (1626-1651).Ball p.340 Of their three children two died young. Mariana, their only surviving daughter, married Marcus Beyerman. Margaret died in April 1651 from complications during pregnancy. Arnold was devoted to his wife, and shortly after her death he published a remarkable tribute, The Character of a Truly Virtuous and Pious Woman as it has been acted by Mistress Margaret Dongan, which was dedicated to Thomas Sydserf, Bishop of Galloway .Gilbert p.283 It paints a picture of a young woman who was notable for beauty, religious fervour, kindness, peaceful nature, charity and family loyalty Works * Examen Praefationis Morini in Biblia Graeca de Textus Ebraici Corruptione et Graeca Authoritate (co-author) (1630) * Philosophia Naturalis Reformata (co-author) (1641) * A Remonstrance on Diverse Remarkable Passages by our Army (1642) * Animadversiones sacrae ad textum Hebraicum veteris testemetnti (1644) * Observationes medicae de affectibus a veteribus omissis (1649) * De textus Hebraici veteris tetementi certitudine (1650) * The Character of a Truly Virtuous and Pious Woman...

His father Bob Osborn started BMX Action magazine. He, along with Mike Buff and Bob Haro are considered the forefathers of BMX freestyle, a style of BMX bike riding that involves flatland and ramp tricks. In 1978, R.L. and Bob Haro teamed up to create the very first freestyle BMX team, which made its debut at ABA's Winternationals in Chandler, AZ and then another show in Amarillo, Texas at an ABA BMX Race. Shortly after those shows, R.L. Osborn and Bob Haro had a falling out and parted ways. In 1981 R.L. and Buff created the BMX Action Trick Team, the first BMX freestyle team that toured in a van and put on shows for fans of the sport using a portable kickramp and quarter pipe. R.L. Osborn quickly rose to fame when he appeared on \\"That's Incredible!\\" in 1983, where he raced a horse. He also appeared as a stunt rider in the 1986 movie \\"RAD\\". He was the first BMX rider to popularize BMX freestyle (flatland) and the first person to use endorsements to become the first millionaire in the sport. He was endorsed by Haro, acs, General, Ame, and Redline. He founded Hammer Bodywear in 1988 and Bully Bikes in 1989. In 1991, he sold the companies to MCS in Florida. In 1992, R.L. Osborn stepped away from professional BMX riding and started a carpet cleaning business RL Osborn Carpet and Rug Cleaning Monterey, CA, which he still owns and operates today. In 2009, R.L. Osborn was bestowed the highest honor when he was inducted into the National BMX Hall of Fame along with legendary riders such as Mike Buff, Eddie Fiola, Danny Oakley, D.D. Leone, Troy Lee, and special recognition to Jeremy McGrath. On a May 8, 2020 Facebook post, R.L. Osborn announced that he was getting back into BMX freestyle riding. His oldest son, Dylan Osborn was brought in as a producer of video and photo content for all R.L. Osborn social media and his official website. Much of the content created are \\"how-to\\" videos of BMX tricks, a regular Q and A series with R.L. Osborn, as well as a step-by-step process of customizing an original General RL Osborn signature bike. On occasion, Dylan Osborn will step out from behind the camera to join his father in videos, as well as RL's friend, Patrick Trantham, who works with R.L. at the R.L. Osborn Carpet Cleaning Company. In his return to the BMX freestyle world, R.L. Osborn has found new sponsorships with Etnies, SE Racing, Flatland Fuel, JD Cycle Supply, and BSD Bikes.

The club has two playing fields. The main field is just south of the village, close to the Fane bridge, which marks the border with County Monaghan. A sister club competes in camogie. History The present club is the successor to one of the earliest GAA clubs in Ireland, Culloville William O'Brien's, founded in 1888, and named after the then- imprisoned agrarian agitator and Member of Parliament. In 1910 a club named Culloville Sons of O'Connell was formed, named after the 19th-century Irish political leader Daniel O'Connell. The present name, Culloville Blues, was registered in 1916, when the blue and white colours were adopted in place of the previous green and black. In 1918, political divisions in the district disrupted both the Blues and nearby Crossmaglen Rangers GAC, leading to the creation of Crossmaglen Plunketts, supported by republicans, and Clonalig Dillons, supported by Redmondites.Newry Memoirs feature on GAA At various times other clubs or teams operated in or around Culloville, including the Corlis Mitchels, Creggan Red Hands, the Crievekiernan Harps and Mobane, all long defunct.

Early life Mathew John Anthony Wilson was born 2 October 1935 and was the son of Anthony Thomas Wilson (1908‚Äì1979), and Margaret Holden. His paternal grandparents were Lt. Col. Sir Mathew Richard Henry Wilson, 4th Baronet of Eshton Hall and the Hon. Barbara Lister, daughter of Thomas Lister, 4th Baron Ribblesdale (1854‚Äì1925). Educated at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, Wilson was commissioned into the King‚Äôs Own Yorkshire Light Infantry (KOYLI) on his 21st birthday on 2 October 1956, and thus represented the fourth consecutive generation of his family to serve with the regiment. Over the next few years he took part in military operations in Aden, Borneo, Malaya, Cyprus and Northern Ireland. Career In 1967 he was promoted to major and was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1971. Shortly afterwards, in May 1972, he received the Military Cross \\"for Gallant Services\\" in Northern Ireland. Promotion to lieutenant colonel followed in 1973 and after a further engagement in Northern Ireland and a posting to Hong Kong, he was advanced to Officer of the Order of the British Empire. =Falklands War= With his promotion to colonel he moved to the General Staff of the Ministry of Defence in London, and on 31 December 1980 he was promoted to brigadier assuming command of the 5th Infantry Brigade which he was to lead during the Falklands War. Wilson commanded the 5th Infantry Brigade during the campaign to liberate the Falkland Islands after their seizure by the Argentinian Armed Forces, and was responsible for the southern flank of the East Falkland for the British armed forces, who advanced towards the Islands' capital, Stanley. First, Wilson was able to secure a large part of the eastern island, with the so-called \\"bold move\\", but during the further advance, an Argentine air attack on two British landing ships occurred at Port Pleasant (sometimes also called Fitzroy or Bluff Cove) at noon of 8 June 1982. 46 British soldiers and three Asian crew members were killed, and 115 men suffered severe burn injuries. It was the largest single loss of men on the British side in this war. At the time of the attack, several TV crews were on site and footage of the attack was shown on TV news bulletins later that same day. Wilson was subsequently the only senior British officer who failed to receive any recognition of his service in the conflict in the form of honours at its conclusion., although whether as a consequence of this is not known. On 31 December 1982 he stepped down from all his military posts and retired from the British Army on 31 January 1983. =Later career= From 1983 to 1985 Wilson was managing director of the British \\"Wilderness Foundation United Kingdom\\", a non-profit organization that provides the opportunity to its seminar participants to experience nature and wilderness. Personal life He was married to Janet Mary Mowll and is the father of a son and a daughter. *Mathew Edward Amcotts Wilson (b. 1966), who married Imogen Wilson in 1993 *Victoria Mary Wilson (b. 1968) He and his wife lived in the United States.

The show features Edgers, an arts and entertainment reporter for The Boston Globe, on a journey through America in search of strange and unique forms of entertainment and culture. Edgers samples bizarre foods and joins in activities such as bicycle jousting, rattlesnake hunting, and Pig-N-Ford Races. The show ended after a run of ten episodes on March 14, 2013. Premise Edge of America follows Edgers as he discovers and participates in traditions such as bicycle jousting and Pig-N- Ford Races in Oregon, lobster boat racing in Maine, and a calf testicle festival in Oklahoma. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Edgers described the content of the show: \\"It's history, entertainment and action ... To me, this is the greatest kind of Americana, where people take a necessity‚Äîlike castrating cows and killing rattlesnakes‚Äîand make a big party out of it.\\" Edgers also said that the show would feature \\"strange American things in scenic American places\\" in an interview with The Boston Globe. Production and reception The Travel Channel announced that it had picked up Edge of America in September 2012, and slated a run of six episodes, to be broadcast in early 2013. The premiere was eventually set for January 22, 2013, with two episodes‚Äî\\"Oklahoma\\" and \\"Oregon\\"‚Äîto be broadcast back-to-back at 9:00 pm ET. Promoting the new series, Travel Channel general manager Andy Singer said of Edgers' hosting: \\"As a journalist, Geoff Edgers is a curious storyteller. He's also crazy and up for anything, which makes him the ideal host to help introduce our viewers to these surprising pursuits\\". Edge of America initially received good reviews and strong ratings upon release. The New York Times Neil Genzlinger wrote a mostly positive review, saying that \\"The intent is to make you marvel at just how bizarre Americans' recreational preferences can be .... Too often, Mr. Edgers settles for .... Phrases like 'What am I doing?' and 'What have I gotten myself into?' .... But once in a while he lets his deadpan side run loose, to good effect.\\" Scott Christian wrote in the preface to an interview with Edgers in GQ that the show was \\"Charles Kuralt meets Jackass\\". After a successful premiere the show's ratings slipped, leading Travel Channel to shift Edge of America's time slot out of primetime to 11:00 pm. The show was then moved to 2:00 pm on Saturdays, and finally to 11 am on Thursdays. After a run of ten episodes, Edge of America was cancelled, although reruns continue to be shown on the Travel Channel. Edgers chronicled the brief success and eventual demise of the show in an article for Esquire entitled \\"The Rise and Fall of a Reality TV Star. In Nine Days\\". \\"The whiplash wore off and I realized I had little to regret\\" wrote Edgers. \\"Yeah, I would have loved a few more weeks at 9 p.m. so we could have at least tried to find our audience. But how could I complain? A television network gave me a shot. They invested time, money and creative energy into Edge of America. I'm proud of the show we made.\\" EpisodesReferences Category:2013 American television series debuts Category:American travel television series Category:English-language television shows Category:Travel Channel original programming Category:2013 American television series endings ","title":"Edge of America"},{"id":"38181955","text":"Yandian Township () is a township under the administration of Wafangdian City in southern Liaoning province, China, located about northwest of downtown Wafangdian, north of Dalian, and served directly by China National Highway 202. , it has 7 villages under its administration.

Father John Penketh, the first Jesuit priest in Bedford in 1678 was imprisoned in Lancaster. John Shaw built the old chapel from which Chapel Street is named in 1778. One of his successors, Father John Reeve who served from 1828 until 1840, built the school. The brick-built chapel was replaced by St Joseph's Church which opened on 3 May 1855. Father John Middlehurst raised funds for construction of the nave, chancel and tower base and his successor, Father James Fanning completed the tower in 1878. Among the priests to serve the parish was the poet Gerard Manley Hopkins who arrived in 1879. Architecture Front of the church The church was designed in the Gothic Revival style by Joseph Hansom and built in 1855 in hammer- dressed stone with a slate roof with fishscale bands. In plan it has a wide nave, polygonal chancel, chapels on the north and south sides, a sacristy, south porch and west tower. =Exterior= The north and south elevations have nine bays on a projecting plinth separated by buttresses and three-light windows with Geometrical tracery. The chancel has two and three-light windows. The three-stage tower has angled buttresses with an octagonal stair turret in one corner. Above the arched west door at the second stage is a statue and niche. The third stage has four lancet windows and above them two-light belfry openings below the gables. The gable roof has a statue finial flanked by pinnacles. =Interior= Nikolaus Pevsner describes the interior as \\"startling\\". It is a very wide \\"preaching box\\" with an apsidal chancel. Its hammerbeam roof failed and slender cast iron columns with palm capitals were installed with iron arches and braces above them creating an arcade.

The film is a meditative psychological drama set in apocalyptic atmosphere. The story is a sensory battle of the two female characters: sound therapist Mary Taggert and her patient, a disturbed young woman named Alaska. The doctor evacuates with her patient, driving a car away from the city to unspecified northern territory towards the border. Having run out of gas, two women are stranded in mysterious rough and rocky wilderness close to the ocean where it becomes a battle for survival and a struggle with the inner wounds and salvation with sound and nature. The psychologically complex and slow narrative of Condition relies on sequences of abstract images that one could expect to see at a museum or gallery. Condition features Antonella Lentini (Alaska), Jessica Kaye (Dr. Mary Taggert), Steve Moshier (fisherman). Three excerpts from the sonic compositions by Richard Garet can be heard in the film: Winter, Subtracted and For Shimpei Takeda. No musical instruments were used in any of the sounds heard in Condition. The film premiered at the 29th Torino Film Festival and was recognized by the Gandhi Glasses award. The film was shot on location in New York City and the northern shoreline of Maine.

The index is the predecessor of the Human Freedom Index, which has been published annually since 2015. The coauthors of both indexes are Ian V√°squez and Tanja Porƒçnik (n√©e ≈†tumberger). The index is based on measures of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, individual economic choice, freedom of association, freedom of assembly, violence and crimes, freedom of movement, and women's rights. Other components of the Freedom Index include human trafficking, sexual violence, female genital mutilation, and homicide. The index rates countries on a scale from 10 (freest) to 0 (least free). In 2019, the freest countries/regions were New Zealand (8.88), Switzerland (8.82), and Hong Kong SAR, (8.81). Least free were Syria (3.79), Venezuela (3.80), and Yemen (4.30). The components on which the index is based can be divided into economic freedoms and other personal freedoms. Highest ranking in economic freedoms were Hong Kong (8.91) and Singapore (8.71). Highest ranking in personal freedoms were Sweden (9.45) and the Netherlands (9.28). In 2019, United States has dropped to rank 15 according to The Human Freedom Index. The Freedom Index does not measure democracy, but it does measure freedom of speech and media, press killings, political imprisonment, etc. According to the report, democracy may be the form of government that best protects freedom, but democracy may both increase and reduce freedom. Nevertheless, democracy strongly correlates with freedom (7.9), as measured by the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index and the Freedom Index. The Freedom Index is included as part of the book Towards a Worldwide Index of Human Freedom, written by 13 academics and economists from Canada (Fraser Institute), the United States (Cato Institute, Emory University), Germany (Liberales Institut, Goethe-University Frankfurt am Main), and Russia (Institute of Economic Analysis). Among other claims, the report argues that the criminalization of and the war on drugs have restricted many components of freedom.

He specialized in primitives societies (like those of the Australian Aborigines and the hunter-gatherers in general) and comparative anthropology. His research themes included: slavery, marriage arrangements, funeral practices, gift and exchange, typology of societies, the political, the evolution of the societies, and questions of interpretation in prehistoric archaeology. With his works Alain Testart argued for the autonomy of anthropology as a social science and, against the anti-evolutionism that has dominated social anthropology over the past century, for a sociologically founded evolutionism.An exhaustive discussion of the question of evolutionism in social anthropology can be found in Alain Testarts article on the issue that appeared in the Revue Fran√ßaise de Sociologie Nr. 33, April‚ÄìJune 1992, pp. 155-187. Read also the last paragraph of this article. With force of arguments he contested naturalist approaches of the evolution of the societies that draw their explanatory models from evolution in biology.See for instance the article ‚ÄúAre the biological models useful for conceptualizing the evolution of the societies?‚Äù in Pr√©histoires m√©diterran√©ennes 2011/2. Based on a critical review of the foundations of ethnology, in particular of the work of Lewis H. Morgan,A re-edition of Lewis H. Morgan‚Äôs Ancient Society (1877) was published in 1985 with a preface by Alain Testart that can be obtained via the official website. Alain Testart has attempted to renew an almost forgotten tradition in ethnological research, basing himself on the data acquired by a century of research in ethnography and prehistoric archaeology. In his synthetic work Prior to history. The evolution of societies, from Lascaux to Carnac (2012) he has explained his scientific approach in a systematic way, and has designed a surprising panorama on the prehistory of the societies, including those of the Indo-European ensemble. With this book Alain Testart obtained a late recognition from a broad audience for his work as a sociological researcher.Following an enthusiastic welcome in the newspaper Le Monde of 23 November 2012, a discussion of this book in the review Sciences Humaines (update of 23 December 2013) shows a continuing interest in the evolution of the societies. After his death a circle of friends and former colleagues has taken up the edition of unpublished works.End of January 2014 the essay The Amazon and the Kitchenmaid: Anthropology of the sexual division of labor was published by Gallimard in Paris. The following article shortly presents the social-anthropological oeuvre of Alain Testart at the hand of three of his research themes: the anthropology of hunter-gatherers; concepts of comparative sociology, and the evolution of the societies. In the footnotes web links point towards abstracts, papers, articles in scientific reviews, book critiques by others, colloquia and resources for further reference. An extract of his copious bibliography has also been included. An engineer in the social sciences After graduating as an engineer from the √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure des Mines in Paris,Higher National (engineering) School of Mine. and after brief employment in an enterprise, Alain Testart began to study ethnology. In 1975 he received his doctorate with his thesis On the dualistic classifications in Australia: Essay on the evolution of social organization 1978 : Des classifications dualistes en Australie : Essai sur l'√©volution de l'organisation sociale. Paris et Lille : Maison des Sciences de l'Homme & Lille III, 222 p. French Summary: http://www.alaintestart.com/class_dual_austra.htm under the direction of Jacques Barrau. In 1982 he began working at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) and became, subsequently, a member of the team ‚ÄúSocial appropriation of Nature‚Äù at the National Museum of Natural History, and of the Laboratory of Ethnology and Comparative Sociology at the Paris X ‚Äì Nanterre University, where he carried out a number of educational assignments. Alain Testart was a member of the Laboratory for Social Anthropology at the Coll√®ge de France and an emeritus research directory at the CNRS.  Anthropology of the Hunter-Gatherers  The first works of Alain Testart treat the social organization of the Australian Aborigines and of the hunter- gatherers, peoples who did not engage in any form of agriculture or animal herding at the time of colonization (Australian Aboriginals, San, arctic and subarctic American Indians, Pygmies, etc.). =The opposition Gathering / Storage = His book The Hunter-Gatherers, or the Origins of Social Inequalities (1982) 1982 : Les chasseurs-cueilleurs ou l'origine des in√©galit√©s, Paris : Soci√©t√© d'Ethnographie (Universit√© Paris X-Nanterre) rapidly became a classic among prehistorians. It revisits the classical opposition between hunter‚Äìgatherers and agriculturalists (or horticulturalists). This opposition was accepted as valid in both ethnology and prehistoric archeology, as was the notion of the ‚Äúneolithic revolution‚Äù earlier advanced by V. Gordon Childe: a radical transformation of social and economic structures that was said to mark the transition from an economy of gathering and hunting to one based on the domestication of plants and crops. In his book, Alain Testart points out that more than half of the hunter‚Äìgatherer societies known to ethnology, in fact, share the same characteristics as agricultural societies: a sedentary society which indicates village life; an increased demographic density (higher than neighboring agriculturalists); significant hierarchies, including slavery and the differentiation in social strata such as nobles and commoners. These are typically the American Indians of the Pacific coast, of California and the peoples of Southeastern Siberia. These peoples, who only exploit wild (undomesticated) food resources like salmon, acorns etc., collect them in large quantities during the season of abundance and store them in order to provide for sufficient foodstuffs during the remainder of the year. These hunter‚Äìgatherers live on their stored food just as the agriculturalists live on the reserves of grain they keep in their barns or silos. They thereby possess what Alain Testart terms a ‚Äútechno-economical structure‚Äù analogous to that of the grain growers. As a consequence their societies are analogous as well. He proposes to substitute the classic opposition of hunter ‚Äì gatherers and agriculturalists with a more general classification, depending on whether or not their economies rely on the large scale stockpiling of a seasonal, basic food resources. The evolutionary implications of this recasting are very clear. In no case it is possible to retain a unilinear conception. Rather, one finds an evolution which diverges, resulting, in one case, in food-storing hunter-gatherers, who remain unchanged into the 19th century and, in the other case, in agriculturalists, some of whom came to develop into very different forms of society. =The sexual division of labor as ideology= In a second work Alain Testart traces some invariance that one could almost term as transhistorical, as they are widely found in very different societies, including those of the first industrial era. One of these is how work is divided between men and women. A brief observation shows for instance that women are generally kept far from all professions related to blood (surgery, the armed professions, hunting, etc.). A consideration of the ethnographic data collected on hunter‚Äìgatherers shows that the division of tasks between men and women regarding gathering and hunting obeys a simple law: women are not excluded from hunting but from those forms of hunting that shed blood. With the Inuit, the Siberians and the Australian Aboriginals women can be observed hunting with nets and clubs, but never with bows and arrows or with harpoons. These data refute the idea that the sexual division of labor with hunter‚Äìgatherers could be based on nature (women not hunting because of repetitive pregnancies) and had no connection to economical rationality, because what could justify women hunting but not using typical hunting weapons? In his Essay on the Foundations of the Sexual Division of Labor with the Hunter-Gatherers (1986)Video of the last College conference with Alain Testart at the Cit√© des sciences, December 1st, 2011. Alain Testart argues that this division must be based on an ideology involving the symbolism of blood. Finally relating these prohibitions or taboos regarding weapons to the very numerous taboos associated with the female blood, he shows that this ideology appears to bar anyone from adding animal to female blood.  Concepts of Comparative Sociology Alain Testart was often very critical about social anthropology; he reproached it for using concepts that are vague, inexact and much too simple, compared to the concepts used in the sciences of history or in the history of law. He maintains that for a scientific project in a comprehensive sociology it is of fundamental importance to consider small, precolonial stateless societies, that so far have been studied only by this discipline. According to Alain Testart, today‚Äôs major scientific challenge when studying these societies is to be able to use the same terms and the same problematic as those used by the historical sciences. In this perspective he has reexamined a number of issues in order to define the terms with more precision. =Slavery = For instance: slavery, conceived as an extreme form of servile dependency, needs to be carefully distinguished from other forms like serfdom, the Roman colonat, helotism, etc. In Slaves, Debt and Power: Studies in comparative Sociology 2001, L'esclave, la dette et le pouvoir : √âtudes de sociologie comparative. Paris : Errance, 238 p. Alain Testart notices that the slave is not assigned a single typical way of life. This is particularly true for the slave of Antiquity: the slave of the latifundia and the slave who works at his master‚Äôs side have very little in common; the gladiator and the Prince‚Äôs favorite, who carries out important functions in the imperial offices, have even less in common. There is no single material and social condition characteristic of slavery. These slaves have in common only their legal status as slaves: to consider only the Greek and Roman examples, the favorite concubine of the master and the worker in the mines of the Laurion cannot have legitimate children. And, according to laws common to both classical Athens and ancient Rome, both the concubine and the miner are subject to torture when they are called to testify in a law court. The slave cannot be conceived of except as a clear legal category. But the legal conditions of slavery, for instance in Ancient Rome and with the Ashanti, are not at all the same. They even completely change from the beginning to the end of the Roman empire, likewise they differ between the Ashanti kingdom and that of Abomey. This legal dimension needs to be enlarged to encompass a wider sociological characterization. Alain Testart sees exclusion as one of the most important characteristics of the slave, he cites the work of Africanists who have shown that the slave in pre-colonial Africa was considered as a man ‚Äúwithout kin‚Äù, as someone without a name and without descendants. The slave in Antiquity was excluded from the city state, namely from the rights associated with citizen status. According to Islamic law the slave could only be slave when he was an outsider to the community of the faithful at the time he was enslaved. In many old Asian kingdoms the slave had no connection to the king, did not pay taxes and was not obliged to serve in the military. Alain Testart summarizes these facts by saying that everywhere the slave was defined by an exclusion from areas considered as most fundamental by society. The nature of this exclusion could vary; in one society there is exclusion from parenthood, in another from the city state; in a third one from any contact with the Prince. This sociological characterization adequately distinguishes slavery from other forms of dependence. =The gift = He uses the same approach to propose a new definition of the gift. The difference between a gift and an exchange does not depend on a gift being returned: the regular exchange of presents is well known. Nor does the distinction depend on whether the reciprocity is expected: gift-giving with selfish motives also exists, giving something in the hope of getting back more in return (for example: the baksheesh). The radical difference between a gift and an exchange is that the gift-giver cannot legitimately claim a counter gift (even when he expects a gift in return, or when this hope is his most important motive), whereas the person who exchanges always has the right to demand compensation. The difference does not depend on the form of payment or on the motives of the actors. Here too it is the juridical aspect that enables us to distinguish both phenomena: the right to demand compensation characterizes the exchange but is absent with the gift. On this basis one can show that the kula with the Trobriand is not a gift but an exchange: one can compel compensation, by force if necessary. This is clearly not the case with the potlatch of the American Indians of the Pacific coast, which has to be characterized as a series of gifts and counter gifts.

Alain Testart reproaches Mauss for not specifying whether the nature of obligation is juridical or only moral and, by consequence, thus obscuring the nature and importance of the gift in history and in society. These theses are currently being widely discussed and debated.  The Evolution of Societies From his earliest writings, Alain Testart confirms himself very explicitly as an evolutionist. This is particularly true in the article The Question of Evolutionism in Social Anthropology from 1992.1992 : La question de l'√©volutionnisme dans l'anthropologie sociale. Revue Fran√ßaise de Sociologie 33 : 155-187. http://www.alaintestart.com/doc_textes/qevol.pdf In this article he welcomes the often unappreciated originality of the great 19th Century anthropologists, primarily that of Lewis H. Morgan, but simultaneously criticizes their methods. Comparative anthropology or solely the observation of ‚Äúpre-current‚Äù and current societies is in no case adequate for reconstructing the evolution of past societies and cultures. He underlines that this reconstruction has to rest on historical documents or on those of prehistoric archeology. For this reason he considers collaboration, as well as debate, with archeologists, whether prehistorians or protohistorians, to be extremely important.A revue of ‚ÄúLa d√©esse et le grain‚Äù can be found in the French Revue de l'Histoire des Religions: http://rhr.revues.org/7838. (April 4, 2012)Video of Alain Testart at the Mus√©e du quai Branly : ¬´ The prehistory of the others, from denial to challenge ¬ª. (2011) This conviction led him to take a dual perspective on the funeral practices from both an archeological and an ethnological viewpoint, and to introduce a thesis on the origin of the State. Here he focuses on what he terms as ‚Äúthe accompanying dead‚Äù, referring to one or more men who must die in order to accompany the deceased. In Voluntary Servitude (2004, 2 parts) 2004 : La servitude volontaire (2 vols.) : I, Les morts d‚Äôaccompagnement ; II, L‚Äôorigine de l‚Äô√âtat. Paris : Errance, 264 p. et 140 p. [Voluntary Servitude (2 Vol.): Part I, The ‚ÄúAccompanying Dead‚Äù ; Part II, The Origins of the State]. English Summary : http://www.alain.testart.com/UK/documents/engservitude.html . he examined all ethnographic and historical reports of this practice. It appears to have been extremely widespread in the past, not only in kingdoms, as is often thought, but in the societies based on lineage (in Africa) or in acephalous societies, like those of the American Indians of the Pacific coast. Slaves who have played the role of faithful servants to their masters are often implicated. It is the idea of fidelity that the master wants to take with him to his grave. Alain Testart points out that in ethnology one finds this practice in stateless societies, and in archeology in Neolithic societies, all of which indicates that it existed in non-State societies. It can also be found in certain forms of the archaic State. These data all indicate that the germs of a State power ‚Äì and of despotic power ‚Äì are present well in advance of the State. A powerful person derives his power from dependents, who depend on him to such a degree that they know they will not survive him. They are his faithful servants, and the ethnographic data show quite clearly that his power rests more on such servants than on kin. Family members having a dual liability because of having rights analogous to those of the pretender, which make them his potential rivals. The historical and ethno-historical data reveal numerous kingdoms, especially in Africa and in the Islamic world, where kings rely on ‚Äúthe slaves of the crown‚Äù; they even possess whole armies of slave regiments. How can we not see a continuity here? The ‚Äúexceptional loyalty of the slaves‚Äù, as an Arab saying goes, provides a secure base for a power that wants to assert itself and, as Alain Testart maintains, to a power that want to assert itself in the form of a state.

Establishment William Cuthbert and the Quaker printer Isaac Thompson (1703-1776) printed a prospectus for a new Newcastle newspaper in January 1739. The enterprise, they announced, would be sustained by strict political impartiality: Facing down mockery from the existing Newcastle Courant, the first issue of the Newcastle Journal appeared on 7 April 1739. By the summer the editors claimed they were selling \\"nearly 2000 of these Papers weekly\\".Newcastle Journal, 15 July 1739. Cited in They also claimed a wide regional circulation, with agents in towns as far afield as Berwick and Newhaven, Derbyshire. Politics In the competition between the Journal and the Courant, each newspaper \\"consciously struck a balance between sales and politics\\". The Newcastle Journal robustly defended its right to print opposition speeches, such as the April 1740 speech against the government by John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll in the House of Lords. In 1742 the newspaper included an anonymous criticism of David Hume's essay on the character of Robert Walpole, to which Hume replied in the Scots Magazine.David Hume Bibliography. Accessed 9 January 2013. Later history Thompson continued printing the Journal until the end of his life, though he also published the Newcastle General Magazine from 1746 to 1760. The printer Thomas Slack worked with Thompson at the Newcastle Journal throughout the 1750s. However, the two men fell out, and in 1764 Slack attempted his own weekly newspaper, the Newcastle Chronicle, in competition with the Newcastle Journal. In 1773 the Newcastle Journal claimed circulation over an area with a 600-mile circumference. After Thompson's death in 1776, the paper was bought by T.

The \\"Passenger\\" Shed is in the centre, the \\"Goods\\" Shed on the right, while on the left is the ex-GWR Locomotive Works. Between the two engine sheds is the \\"Vinegar Branch\\", which goes down through the town to serve Hill, Evans & Co, the Vulcan Works, and Heenan & Froude Hill, Evans & Co Ltd were vinegar manufacturers based in Worcester, England. Founded in 1830 and at one time the world's largest producer of vinegar, the works closed in 1965. History Hill, Evans & Co was founded in the centre of Worcester in 1830 by two chemists, William Hill and Edward Evans. The pair started producing vinegar, but later the company also produced: wines from raisin, gooseberry, orange, cherry, cowslip, elderberry; ginger beer; fortified wines including port and sherry; as well as Robert Waters branded original quinine which was drunk to combat malaria. As the company quickly expanded, they purchased a site at Lowesmoor. In 1850 the company built the Great Filling Hall, containing the world's largest vat, which at high could hold of liquid. For a century this made the works the biggest vinegar works in the world, capable of producing of malt vinegar every year. Vinegar Works branch As the firm expanded, it was decided that a connection to the national railway network was required via the nearby joint Worcester Shrub Hill railway station of both the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway and the Midland Railway. The resultant Worcester Railways Act 1870 allowed Hill, Evans and Co to extend the existing branchline that had served the Worcester Engine Works, from where it crossed the Virgin's Tavern Road (now Tolladine Road) by a further to terminate in St Martin's Street opposite the northern boundary of the vinegar works. This route required a level crossing at Shrub Hill Road, a bridge over the Worcester and Birmingham Canal, and a second level crossing at Pheasant Street. The Act also permitted a second siding to be constructed that was wholly within the parish of St.Martin, which enabled the branchline to connect to both the local flour mill, and the Vulcan Works of engineers McKenzie & Holland. Completed in 1872, the new private branchline became known as the Vinegar Works branch or the Lowesmoor Tramway. As an engineering company, McKenzie & Holland supplied the required shunting locomotive. From 1903, engineering company Heenan & Froude also built a works in Worcester, which was served by an additional extension. After the closure of the flour mill in 1915, post-World War I that part of the branchline was lifted, and the flour mill and original part of the Vulcan Works redeveloped in the mid-1920s as a bus depot. In 1936, Heenan & Froude took over McKenzie & Holland, and hence responsibility for the supply of the private shunting locomotive. Post World War II, the Great Western Railway and then British Railways took over supply of the shunting locomotive to the branchline. Supplies to the vinegar works switched to road transport in 1958. The last train on the branchline ran on 5 June 1964, hauled by GWR Pannier Tank engine No.1639. The branchline was taken up from the late 1970s. Present The vinegar works closed in 1965. The Great Filling Hall was made a Grade II listed building in 1974. Today it is the local Territorial Army headquarters and training centre. The rest of the buildings on the site were cleared, and the land redeveloped as an Asda supermarket.

History The Balƒ±klƒ± Greek Hospital was originally established as the Yedikule Hospital through Ottoman government edict in 1753. The hospital was built and sponsored by the Union of Greek Grocers. The immediate objective of the hospital was to help cure epidemics and common diseases specifically affecting the ethnic Greek population of Constantinople. The hospital however was subjected to a fire in 1790, which completely destroyed the structure. The hospital was rebuilt in 1793 under the sponsorship of Patriarch Neophytus VIII (reigned 1891-1894). Church on the premises of the hospital By the end of the 18th century, the Greek community of Constantinople had built three hospitals: this one, in 1762 another in the district of Galata and in 1780 a third in Pera. All three hospitals had their own particular constitutions, but they were all placed under the supervision of the Ecumenical Patriarch, who was responsible for nominating the administrative boards of the hospitals. In 1852, through the sponsorship of Patriarch Cyril VI, the Balƒ±klƒ± hospital established an orphanage on the premises. The hospital also features a church, which serves not only for the patients but the Greek Orthodox community at large. During the Istanbul riots of 1955, the hospital received many patients, who suffered from trauma, rape, and physical abuse. The hospital was restored in 1991 and in 1994, the first private clinic for the treatment of alcohol and substance abuse in Turkey was established.

The wife of the late President Hafez al-Assad, Makhlouf held the position of First Lady of Syria from 1971 until 2000. Her five children include Bashar al-Assad, the President of Syria since 2000. The Economist described Anisa Makhlouf as \\"a formidable figure\\" within the al-Assad family and the Ba'athist government. A highly influential member of the government, she was one of the few people with whom Bashar al-Assad regularly consulted during the Syrian Civil War. She is believed to have advocated for a heavy, military crackdown on Syrian protesters and rebels during the ongoing Civil War. Makhlouf was born in Latakia, Syria, to the Makhloufs, an influential family from Bustan al-Basha, Latakia Governorate. She married Hafez al-Assad, an officer of the Syrian Arab Air Force, in 1957. They had five children: Bushra (b. 1960), Bassel al-Assad (1962‚Äì1994), Bashar al-Assad (b. 1965), Majd al-Assad (1966‚Äì2009), and Maher al-Assad (b. 1967). Her marriage to Hafez al-Assad elevated the status and wealth of the Makhlouf family. Anisa Makhlouf's relatives were awarded lucrative contracts within the country's banking, oil and telecommunication sectors. One nephew, Rami Makhlouf, is believed to be the wealthiest man in Syria, with a net worth of US$5 billion, as of 2012. Following the death of Bassel al-Assad in 1994, Makhlouf favoured Maher al-Assad, her youngest son and a Syrian general, as a possible successor for her husband. Instead, Bashar al-Assad returned from London, joined the military, and succeeded his father as President of Syria in 2000. In 2012, Makhlouf, as well as other members of the Al-Assad family, were sanctioned by the European Union amid the country's civil war and attacks on protesters by the Syrian government. The EU sanctions included a travel ban and the freezing of her assets. Prior to the travel ban, she had reportedly made frequent trips to Germany for medical treatments for an undisclosed illness. Death Anisa Makhlouf died in Damascus on 6 February 2016 from undisclosed causes.

These include issues by the Kingdom of Ireland, issues by the United Kingdom specifically for use in Ireland or briefly Southern Ireland, and issues of an independent southern Ireland since 1922 (including the Provisional Government of Ireland, the Irish Free State and the Republic of Ireland). Revenue stamps of Northern Ireland were also issued from 1921 to the 1980s, but they are not covered in this article. Union with Britain 2s6d Registration of Deeds key type stamp depicting Edward VII, issued 1902 In the 18th century, Ireland was an independent kingdom in personal union with and a de facto client state of the Kingdom of Great Britain, and in 1801 both kingdoms were merged into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. During this period, some revenue stamps of the United Kingdom ‚Äì both directly embossed or adhesive ‚Äì were used in Ireland. However, since the island had many unique branches of the legal system, it required its own revenue stamps for some uses. The first revenue stamps specifically for use in Ireland were impressed duty stamps introduced in 1774 to pay for stamp duty. Like British issues, the stamps could be embossed directly onto a document or on pieces of coloured paper with a cypher label at the back. Initially, colourless embossing was used although later on coloured ink was also used. Embossed adhesives were introduced in 1858, and these were either inscribed IRELAND or were regular British issues but with die letters which were exclusively used in Ireland only. Apart from general duty stamps, there were also directly embossed revenue stamps for Affidavit, Bankers Note or Bill, Bonds, Chancery Fee Fund, Civil Bill Duty, the Court of Bankruptcy and Insolvency, Enrolment, Intermediate Education, Judgements Registry, Law Fund, Lease, Lunacy Fee, Protests, Record of Titles, Registration of Deeds, the Supreme Court of Judicature, and Writ. Embossed adhesives were also used for Admiralty Court, Chancery Fee Fund, Petty Sessions and Registration of Deeds. 6d Dog Licence Registration stamp (overprinted on a Petty Sessions key type depicting George V), used in 1922 British key types specifically inscribed for use in Ireland were first issued in 1873, a year after key types were introduced in Britain. These depicted the reigning monarch, initially Queen Victoria and later King Edward VII and King George V, and they remained in use until the partition of Ireland. Key types were issued for Bankruptcy, County Courts, Judicature, Land Commission, Land Registry, Petty Sessions (some of which were overprinted for Dog Licence Registration), Records, Registration of Deeds, Registration of Title and Registration of Title Insurance Fund. British Admiralty Court, Chancery Court and Judicature stamps were also overprinted for use in Ireland. In addition, specific designs depicting Queen Victoria were also used for Admiralty Court, Chancery Fee Fund, Petty Sessions, Record of Titles and Registration of Deeds. Dog licence stamps depicting an Irish Wolfhound were introduced in 1865 and remained in use until partition. Following partition, the following George V key types were issued for Southern Ireland in 1921‚Äì22: Civil Service, Companies Registration, Contract Note, County Courts, Estate Duty, Foreign Bill, Judicature, Land Registry, Official Arbitration and Petty Sessions. At this point, revenue stamps of Northern Ireland were also introduced, and these continued to be issued until the late 20th century. Irish Free State and Republic A block of British 6d Contract Note stamps with a Saorst√°t √âireann overprint, issued 1922 Following the Irish War of Independence, Ireland was partitioned and in 1922, the southern part fell under the administration of the Provisional Government of Ireland (). Various revenue stamps, either Irish issues as described above or regular British issues, were therefore overprinted accordingly. Rialtas overprints can therefore be found on Bankruptcy, Civil Service, Companies Registration, Contract Note, County Courts, Dog Licence Registration, Excise, Foreign Bill, Health & Pensions Insurance, Judicature, Land Registry, National Health Insurance, Official Arbitration, Petty Sessions, Records, Registration of Deeds and Unemployment Insurance stamps. The Irish Free State () was established at the end of 1922, and British or Irish revenues were once again similarly overprinted. Saorst√°t overprints may be found on Contract Note, County Courts, Dog Licence Registration, Estate Duty, Excise, Foreign Bill, Judicature, Land Commission, Land Registry, National Health Insurance, Petty Sessions, Public Records, Registration of Deeds and Unemployment Insurance stamps. 1960 Wet Time unemployment insurance stamp overprinted 2/10 The Southern Ireland issues and the Rialtas and Saorst√°t overprints include some of Ireland's rarest revenues. For example, only one copy has been recorded of the 6d Dog Licence Registration stamp with the Rialtas overprint. Key type stamps depicting the Celtic harp, a national symbol of Ireland, were introduced in 1925, and these were issued for Bankruptcy, Circuit Court, Companies Registration, Consular Service, Contract Note, Court of Justice, Customs, District Court of Justice, Estate Duty, Film Censorship, Foreign Bill, Judicature, Land Commission, Land Registry, Official Arbitration, Passport, Public Records, Registration of Deeds and State Service. Some key types had inscriptions in both Irish and English, with others being inscribed solely in Irish. Some remained in use after decimalization in 1971, with the last stamps being issued in the 1980s. 2d impressed duty stamp used in 1959 Another design featuring the harp, but smaller than the regular key types was also used for Customs Entry Duty, Customs Late Fee and Old Age Pensions between 1924 and the 1960s. Ireland also issued embossed adhesives in the 1920s, and continued to use impressed duty stamps for a number of decades after independence. A postage stamp was also overprinted for use as a Passport stamp in around 1930. Apart from these, stamps with specific designs were also used for Animal Slaughter fees, Children's Allowance, Excise, Exported Livestock Levy, Income Tax, National Insurance and Unemployment Insurance. Excise stamps have been issued for various purposes, including entertainments taxes and taxes on cigarettes, and stamps for the latter are still in use today.

In addition to national issues, the provinces of Balochistan, North West Frontier, Punjab, Sindh, as well as Azad Jammu and Kashmir, West Pakistan and the capital Islamabad also have or had their own stamps. Until 1947 Pakistan was part of India, and used Indian revenue stamps. A number of princely states which issued their own revenues also became part of Pakistan following independence, and therefore may also be considered as Pakistani forerunner issues. These include Bahawalpur and Las Bela. Prior to 1971, Pakistani national issues were used in both West Pakistan and East Pakistan. Later that year East Pakistan became the independent state of Bangladesh, which issues its own revenues to this day. National issues Like Great Britain and India, some of Pakistan's revenues were keytypes. They showed the star and crescent, Pakistan's national insignia. They were used for the following purposes: *Agreement (c.1950) *Broker's Note (c.1950) *Displaced Persons Adhesive (c.1950-c.1961) *Foreign Bill (1947-c.1992) *Identification Card (c.1990) *Insurance (1947-c.1992) *Notarial (1947-c.1992) *Notarial High Court (c.1960) *Refugee Adhesive (c.1950) *Share Transfer (c.1947-c.1995) *Special Adhesive (1947-2003) Apart from keytypes, some types of revenue stamps had their own specific designs. These include: *Attestation (c.1960) *Central Excise Revenue (c.1958-c.1990) *Court Fees (1948‚Äìpresent) *Entertainment (c.1965-c.1972) *Income Tax (1991-1992) *Insurance (c.1995‚Äìpresent) *National Identity Card (c.2010‚Äìpresent) *Passport and Visa (c.1950) *Revenue (1947‚Äìpresent) *Welfare (c.1972) West Pakistan Prior to Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 in 1971, the territory of modern-day Pakistan was known as West Pakistan (with Bangladesh being East Pakistan), and some revenue issues were made exclusively for this area. Around 1956, Bahawalpur Court Fee, Notarial and Receipt stamps were overprinted for use in the new state. Later Pakistani Court Fee stamps were overprinted for use as Arms Licence stamps in West Pakistan. In 1969 and 1970, stamps were issued for Arms Licence, Driving Licence and Motor Vehicles Tax, and these were in use before being replaced by separate issues for the provinces in 1971. Provincial issues=Azad Jammu and Kashmir= Azad Jammu and Kashmir's only revenue stamps were regular Pakistani issues overprinted for use in the state, either in English or in Urdu. There were issues for the following taxes: *Court Fees *Revenue *Special Adhesive =Balochistan= Balochistan's first revenue stamp issues were in 1971. Since that year, stamps have been issued annually to pay for the following: *Arms Licence *Driving Licence *Motor Vehicles Fitness Certificate *Motor Vehicles Tax *Route Permit Issues from 1971 to 2012 were inscribed Government of Baluchistan.

Larger specimens can be piscivores. They look for areas with pebbly or stony bottom on steep slopes, at depths between 30 and 120 m during the spawning season.EOL - Salvelinus umbla - Lake Char Distribution This char species lives in alpine and subalpine glacial valley lakes of central Europe, between France and Austria and between Germany and Northern Italy. It has been introduced in high altitude lakes as well. Although it is assessed as a least concern species by IUCN, the eutrophication of the lakes in the Subalpine region, which began in the 1950s and peaked in 1979, badly affected Salvelinus umbla populations, which crashed during that period. The lake char became locally extinct in lakes such as Mondsee and other char species, such as Salvelinus profundus, were driven to extinction in the same period. Currently, however, most lake char populations are gradually recovering.The German Federal Nature Conservation Agency (BfN): Red List - Volume 1: Vertebrates (2009) - General assessment for the vertebrate groups The name Salvelinus umbla has also been used in Sweden of char populations of central parts of the country, referred to as storr√∂ding (large char) in distinction of the northern fj√§llr√∂ding ( = Salvelinus alpinus).Svensson M et al.

Parallel to working with Planet Funk, Alex started his career as a solo artist in 2017. Alex Uhlmann in 2018 Biography= Childhood and his entry into Friday Night Hero = Born in Luxembourg of German parents, Uhlmann in his adolescence was a promising tennis player, representing his country in many international tournaments. He started playing piano at a young age but later migrated to the guitar. Being self-taught he thought of it being an advantage rather than a burden especially in terms of songwriting: Uhlmann quickly moved to the UK in order to explore the vast British musical landscape, and formed the indie rock band‚Äö Friday Night Hero, with whom he released the album Tourist In Your Own Town on 2 October 2009 on Capitol East Records. The band performed in several European countries and were nominated for the Indie award as ‚Äúbest UK live act‚Äù in 2008. In his time in the UK Uhlmann also obtained a master's degree in international relations at the University of Sussex in Brighton. = With Planet Funk and the international success = In 2010 Uhlmann left Friday Night Hero to join Planet Funk, the famous international band, with whom he began a lively period of production. That is how he rose to international fame. On 22 September 2011 the album The Great Shake was released (the fourth Planet Funk studio album and the first with Uhlmann on vocals and guitar), including hit singles such as \\"Another Sunrise\\" (used as the soundtrack for the Hyundai i20 Sound Edition TV advertisement), and \\"Ora il mondo √® perfetto\\", with Giuliano Sangiorgi, frontman of the Italian band Negramaro‚Äô. A month later Planet Funk were asked to record a cover of Nancy Sinatra‚Äôs classic \\"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\\", as the soundtrack for the movie La kryptonite nella borsa by Ivan Cotroneo. The song rapidly topped the Italian dance charts and was awarded gold status in Italy for over 15.000 legal downloads. Later on, the single was included in the new version of the album, entitled The Great Shake + 2. Moreover it was used for the italian Wind tv advertisement campaign in 2011/2012. Since May 2011, Planet Funk played over a hundred live concerts as part of \\"The Great Shake Tour\\" throughout Europe, including shows such as the Formula One Gran Prix in Monza with Jamiroquai, the Olympic stadium in Rome with Tiesto and at the MTV Days in Turin in 2011. In September 2012 Uhlmann was chosen as protagonist for the Italian Reebok REEBOK CLASSICS ‚Äì with Alex Uhlmann of Planet Funk campaign for which he shot a TV spot in Paris. Together with Planet Funk he also designed a Reebok shoe, the \\"PF 1999\\", Planet Funk create the Reebok Classic Leather PF1999 that will be released in March 2013. In the same year, during the MTV Digital Days in Turin, Uhlmann performed the \\"Planet Funk DJ Set\\" for the first time alongside Alex Neri and a successful tour of Italy followed, which included a set at the MTV European Music Awards after party in Milan in October 2015. On 13 October 2015 Planet Funk released their single \\"We People\\", again with Uhlmann on vocals, chosen by Save The Children as soundtrack for their \\"Everyone\\" campaign, dedicating all profits to their fight against child mortality in the world. \\"We People\\" will be included in the upcoming 2017 album, which Planet Funk recorded between London and Rome. The album also sees the comeback of two memorable singers of the band: Dan Black and Sally Doherty, who also feature in the \\"Recall Tour\\", that Planet Funk started in November 2016, promoting the revival of the \\"collective nature\\" of Planet Funk: Thanks to his charisma, the success of The Great Shake album and tours as well as being able to interpret even Planet Funk's oldest songs with the necessary credibility, Uhlmann succeeded in establishing himself since 2010 as an integral part of the Planet Funk collective. = Solo career = Alex Uhlmann insieme alla \\"superband\\" formata da Sergio Carnevale dei Bluvertigo. Parallel to his activity in Planet Funk, Uhlmann started producing and writing for other artists as well as collaborating on a project created by Bluvertigo's drummer, Sergio Carnevale, the \\"Superband\\" which unites members of some of the most important Italian bands for events and special performances. With the \\"superband\\" (featuring Carnevale, Uhlmann, Ligabue's memorable guitarist, Federico Poggipollini and Marco Garrincha Castellani of Le Vibrazioni) Uhlmann took part in the documentary \\"Vinyl Talk\\", which was broadcast on Sky Italia in February 2016. A little later in the same year Uhlmann and the \\"Superband\\" appeared for a guest performance in the final episode of the talent show \\"Top DJ\\", aired on Mediaset on July 4, 2016. In 2017 Uhlmann has started a solo career. He released a single entitled \\"Anyway\\", January 24, 2017, in collaboration with one of the most important DJs of Central America, Francis Davila, from Guatemala: Alex Uhlmann, live with Planet Funk for \\"The Great Shake Tour 2012\\" On 14 July 2017 Uhlmann released \\"The Ocean ft.

The collaboration resulted in a first single entitled \\"Back home\\" which was released on 6 April 2018 to critical success, being also played on BBC radio 1 by Danny Howard. During the same time Uhlmann was chosen by IBM Italy to experiment with artificial Intelligence in songwriting. The result was the lyrics to his second solo single 'Butterfly', released on 15 June 2018 (Universal). With the help of IBM's Watson software, Uhlmann was provided with data retrieved from social media that inspired him to write lyrics about family values: On 7 June Uhlmann was awarded the 'Thinker Award for Creativity' for his work with IBM's Watson software. In the summer of 2018 Uhlmann started live activity with his solo project as well as several dates alongside David Morales throughout Europe.

Biography Palace gate Jean-Fran√ßois de Neufforge was born on 1 April 1714 in Comblain-au-Pont, close to Liege, to a family of gentry whose fortunes had declined by the time of his birth due to the revolutions and religious wars that had ravaged the low countries. He had one brother and one sister. He moved to Paris around 1738. He studied engraving under Pierre Edm√© Babel and architecture under Jacques- Fran√ßois Blondel. He contributed nineteen engravings to David Le Roy's book The Ruins of the Most Beautiful Monuments of Greece. It was not until 1755 that he began to become known. At that time he launched on the project that would occupy the rest of his life, the eight folio volumes of the Recueil √©l√©mentaire d'architecture... His planned work was presented to the Academy of Architecture, which approved it on 5 September 1757, and on 27 November 1757 an advertisement appeared in the Ann√©e litt√©raire announcing the work, which had 96 plates, for use by artists, amateurs and students. Almost all the illustrations were his own work, an immense undertaking. The Academy encouraged Neufforge with another endorsement in 1758. In February 1762 four volumes divided into 48 six-page sections appeared, soon followed by the fifth volume. The work was well-received, and was followed by additional volumes in subsequent years. Eventually the full set, published in Paris between 1757 and 1780, contained 900 engravings of aspects of eighteenth-century architecture, most of which he designed and engraved himself. The engravings cover the full range of buildings of his day and included facades, floor plans, doors, columns, vases, stairways, fireplaces and fences. The book was widely used by architects in the 1700s. Jean-Fran√ßois de Neufforge died in Paris on 19 December 1791. He had married twice, and left one son, Joseph de Neufforge, born in 1768. Style Neufforge's designs were intended for a wide range of people, from the middle class to the extremely wealthy. Most of his work was in the Rococo style. His work on the engravings for Le Roy's Les Ruines des plus beaux monuments de la Gr√®ce brought him into contact with Jean-Fran√ßois Le Lorrain, whose influence shows in the earlier volumes of the Recueil elementaire which included all the elements of the Greek revival style. His later work, however, banished these influences and showed that Neufforge had adopted the views of Marie-Joseph Peyre and Andrea Palladio. The later designs, with cubic houses, flat undecorated exterior walls, prostyle porticos and other elements gave clear evidence of borrowings from English Palladianism. His work was highly geometrical. Thus a design that he made of a temple exactly matched tiling designed by Kepler. Even his designs for small bourgeois gardens were elegant and geometrical. Neufforge was not interested in the practicality of his designs, but mainly concerned with style and appearance. The Journal de Tr√©voux announced the fifth volume in February 1762, describing the work as being in good taste with mature composition, invention subordinated to the rules, avoiding frivolous, bizarre or singular elements.

The Straight-Eight engines replaced Daimler's earlier Double-Six V12 engines. Unlike the Double-Six engines, which used sleeve valves based on the Knight patents, the Straight- Eights used conventional poppet valves in the overhead valve configuration. Three series of Straight-Eight engines were built between 1934 and the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939; another series, the DE36, was built after the war from 1946 to 1953. Origin The Straight-Eight engine was announced by The Daimler Company Limited on 1 May 1934 with its first vehicle, Daimler's new Twenty-Five saloon and limousine. The new engine was the first of a series intended to replace Daimler's outmoded large sleeve-valve six- cylinder and twelve-cylinder engines. The sleeve-valve engines with silence and great low-speed torque were unable to spin fast enough to make full use of new combustion technology and remain reliable.New Eight-Cylinder Daimler.The Times, Thursday, May 17, 1934; pg. 13; Issue 46756 These new engines were intended to run comfortably at 4,000 rpm. The general aim with the engine was \\"to give the greatest luxury in travel as expressed by quietness, smoothness, flexibility, and general ease and safety of control rather than great speed\\". While a great deal of useful experience had been acquired by Daimler from Lanchester, who were still building their overhead camshaft straight-eight when they were purchased in 1931, the Daimler Straight-Eight is not a copy. Twenty-Five V 26 {1934 Twenty-Five Straight-Eight limousine by Hooper In the Daimler Twenty-Five the straight-eight was mounted using their Daimler- patented bi-axial design by which flexible support is given to the engine at five points. The gearbox was also held with rubber at three points and one underneath. The one-piece cylinder-head had the spark plugs sunk into it at an angle along the nearside. The make and break and the distributor were set almost vertically at the side of the block. Alongside was the coil with a spare mounted beside it. The generator on the offside shares a triple belt drive with the water pump and the radiator cooling fan. } The crankshaft was fully counterbalanced, mounted in nine main bearings, and fitted with a vibration damper. The valves, like other poppet valve Daimlers, had wide clearances, in some cases more than . They were overhead and driven by pushrods from a chain driven camshaft taking power from the rear end of the crankshaft. =Increased engine size= In September 1935 it was announced that the cylinder bore was now increased to 80 mm increasing the engine's capacity from 3.746 to 4.624 litres following the 25% reduction in horsepower tax which took effect on 1 January 1935. intended to provide improved performance but more important lighter running for the engines and a consequent extension of silent and comfortable service. The tax horsepower rating is now 31.74. Thirty-Two V 4¬Ω In most respects, the Thirty-Two V 4¬Ω was a bored out version of the V26, which it replaced. The compression ratio was increased to 6 to 1. These engines were also fitted to a number of chassis made after 1936 which were fitted with a Lanchester radiator and nameplates.

He wrote a dozen books of poetry from 1953 to 2006, writing in epigrammatic style about things in his everyday life. As an editor, he was always affiliated with The New York Times in some capacity, mainly in the magazine and book reviews, from 1957 to 2005. Early life and the war Harvey Irwin Shapiro was born in Chicago on January 27, 1924, into a Jewish family from Kiev. He spoke Yiddish. When he was a boy, his family moved to Manhattan and later to Long Island. He studied at Yale University but joined the Army Air Forces when World War II broke out. He flew 35 combat missions over Europe as a B-17 tail gunner and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. He returned to Yale to earn a bachelor's degree in English in 1947 and a master's degree in American literature from Columbia University in 1948. Newspaper career Shapiro spent the first half of the 1950s teaching English at Cornell University and Bard College. He then became an assistant editor at Commentary magazine and was the poetry editor at The Village Voice and a fiction editor at The New Yorker before joining The New York Times in 1957. He worked in various editorial positions there‚ÄîThe New York Times Magazine, The New York Times Book Review from 1975 to 1983 he was the Editor of The Book Review and prior to that he was deputy editor of the Magazine. Perhaps the most notable public legacy at The New York Times was in 1962 when he had read that civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. had been jailed. He phoned Dr. King's foundation, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and suggested that, the next time King was jailed he should compose a letter to publish in the manner of Gandhi. This letter became the Letter from Birmingham Jail, after Dr. King was arrested for the Birmingham campaign in April 1963. Shapiro's superiors would not allow him to print Dr. King's letter in The New York Times, but the letter was printed elsewhere 50 times in 325 editions, including Dr. King's own book Why We Can't Wait. Poet Shapiro continued to write poetry while working as an editor, publishing a dozen books, such as The Eye (1953), The Light Holds (1984) and National Cold Storage Company (1988). He also edited an anthology entitled Poets of World War II. His poetry often displayed a subtle sense of humor. Personal life Shapiro was married to and later divorced from Edna Lewis Kaufman. He resided in Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn until his death on January 7, 2013, after complications of recent surgery. He was 88 years old.

Both benefit corporations and Low-profit limited liability companies (L3C) fall under this category. As well as generating a profit, a charitable for-profit entity concentrates on setting a social objective. The business must achieve its social purpose as well as having a profit income if it is to be successful. Lately, there are movements to refining strategies', retuning community-oriented activities based on ROI of Little Investment or Small Capital, Low Risk, yet, higher return (impacts and outcome's; both in social and economic factor) and rebranding Non-profits entity from wholly-dependable funding beneficiary from Governments or public i.e. business organization or individual. previously, we often heard Non-profits community-based organization, now, For-profits community-based Social Enterprise The case of organizing charitable work under for-profit rules rather than as a traditional charity such as a foundation gained prominency when Google announced its Google.org branch in 2006. Since then, the subject has been under both academic and public debate with U.S. law professor Eric Posner arguing in favor of expanding Charity law to include for-profit charities, while Brian Galle considered the legislative popularity of social enterprises a \\"race to the bottom among states competing to siphon away federal tax dollars for local businesses.\\" Legal forms= Benefit corporations = When a company is created under corporate law it is called Benefit corporation. This differs from a ‚ÄòB Corp‚Äô which is qualified by B Lab to meet detailed standards for social and environmental performance. Being a benefit corporation can be very beneficial for the company as it allows them to legally protect their social goals by concentrating on other sectors rather than only considering profit. This allows the business to instead of only concentrating on the shareholders that designated them in the first place, they are able to concentrate on all stakeholders and take into consideration of their interests which can help them solve social and environmental challenges. The demand for corporate accountability is increasing rapidly and is at the highest it has ever been and therefore benefit corporations can differentiate their company from other leading company‚Äôs and concentrate on these customers. There can be many drawbacks of a benefit corporation such as expanded reporting requirements. This provides shareholders of the business with sufficient information to determine whether your business is achieving its purpose and goals. A benefit corporation must produce an annual report for each of its shareholders so that the company can be assessed by a third party. The report will have to include the efforts that have been made in order to achieve a general public benefit and will all have to be stated on the annual report that should be available on the company website. = Low-profit limited liability company = A Low- profit limited liability company (L3C) is a low limited liability company that has a set mission of being socially beneficial similarly to the way a non- profit company has also. However a non-profit company will not distribute its profits the way a for-profit company does. A limited liability company takes advantage of both non-profit and for profit sources of capital. An L3C can attract a diverse group of creditors to finance its operations, including private foundations and socially conscious for- profit entities.  Differences between charitable for-profit entity and not- for-profit charities  Charities are organizations that are set up to provide help and raise money for those in need. Traditional charities aim to provide a service to the needy with no profits earned for the owners of the organisation. All the money that is donated to the organization is used for the purpose of the business and is used to pursue their objectives. A charity is founded to serve a humanitarian or environmental need to the public. A charitable for-profit entity however differs from this as the organization will aim for a profit whilst still providing similar services as a charity. The for-profit entity may also be directed by a sole proprietor, while a non- profit organization needs a board of directors. Like any other for-profit organization it will base its accounting on the quarterly income, whereas a non-profit charity will purely focus on the activities carried out. A large majority of businesses will usually concentrate on the financial benefits of its owners and shareholders when setting up a business. The main aim of most businesses, including Charitable for-profit entities, are to generate some sort of profit for the business. By producing profit, the charitable for- profit entity is able to continue its work to a high standard and also pay the stakeholders of the company. Charitable for-profit entities will however have to pay taxes on the profit that is made. This differs from a traditional (non- profit) charity because they do not have to pay taxes as no profit is generated for themselves. If a charitable for-profit entity was to go out of business, its assets can be liquidated and the proceedings will be distributed to the shareholders of the business. However, if a charity was to go out of business they would have to distribute their assets to another non-profit organization.  Similarities between charitable for-profit entity and not- for-profit charities  Although there are many differences between charitable for-profit entities and traditional charities, they do hold some similarities that can be said to be quite major. Both will have a strong vision in what they want from the business overall. Both will therefore have similar strategic plans in order to get the best out of the business regardless of their aims and objectives being different to an extent. For-profit entities and non-profit charities will both strive to meet their objectives that are laid out on their mission statements. They are both given limited funds, so will therefore have to aim to meet their goals with the funds provided.

They were the first two officers in Massachusetts state history to be murdered by an assailant using a sub-machine gun, and the crime attracted attention across the northeastern United States. Their sacrifices are commemorated by the city of Needham, Massachusetts through its Haddock-McLeod Plaza. Life Haddock was born in Newton, Massachusetts, the son of William Oliver Haddock (May 12, 1861 ‚Äì February 7, 1903) and Elizabeth Helen McAdams (March, 1864-April 22, 1901). His two oldest siblings died in infancy, and he and his older brother Joseph Ernest \\"Joe\\" Haddock (February 15, 1891 ‚Äì January 17, 1954) and younger sister Mary Florence \\"Mae\\" Haddock (May 30, 1894 ‚Äì April 16, 1965) were orphaned upon Ellen‚Äôs death in 1901. William had fled from Newton for unknown reasons to Chicago around 1899. The children were sent to different homes; Mae to her first cousin (twice removed) on her mother‚Äôs side Francis Alonso McAdams and his wife Ellen (Slattery), Frank to the home of Mary J. (O‚ÄôBrien) Kingsbury, and Joe to a local farmer. Apparently, conditions on the farm were harsh, for Frank used to visit Joe, find him hungry, and would sneak back at night with food for him. Kingsbury, the elderly widow of Amasa Kingsbury (whose family were prominent early residents and citizens of Needham) who resided on a farm on Greendale Avenue then on the outskirts of town, alerted authorities and Joe went to live with the McAdams‚Äô. Haddock enlisted in the Army in June, 1917 and spent the remainder of World War I driving an ambulance at Camp Upton, NY, discharged sergeant first class. He had met and then married on Apr. 24, 1919, Helen Frances \\"Nell\\" Callanan (October 18, 1893 ‚Äì October 27, 1979), in Newton. They settled in Needham, and in 1920 he became one of the first full- time officers hired by Needham. There, they raised four daughters, Mary Florence Haddock (March 21, 1920 ‚Äì June 2, 1987), Helen Veronica Haddock (March 31, 1923 ‚Äì March 17, 2009), Dorothy Frances Haddock (August 13, 1924 ‚Äì June 12, 1993), and Phyllis Teresa Haddock (September 1, 1926 ‚Äì March 9, 2007). Haddock was a popular member of the force and especially concerned with children, even as he was stern with juvenile delinquents, and family, given the background of own formative years. He would invite them to dine with the family during the Depression years, and until his death coordinated the junior crossing guard program for schools. He enjoyed the close family relations on his wife‚Äôs side and especially holidays; at Christmas, he would decorate lavishly the house and yard at 4 River Park Drive (that site now part of an interchange on Massachusetts Route 128, with the house having been moved nearby and still owned by the family). He also liked gardening and typically had a thriving set of flower beds in addition to vegetables during the warmer months. He especially prized bulbs and plants brought back from flower shows across the country by one of Needham‚Äôs prominent knitwear manufacturers and philanthropists, William Carter. Death At 9:30 AM on Feb. 2, 1934, the Needham Trust Company was robbed by the trio of Murton Millen, Irving Millen, and Abraham Faber. Prior to their exiting the bank, McLeod was shot fatally three times, from a short distance, with Murton Millen the likely triggerman. The bandits took two hostages who they placed on the running board of their car facing the street and proceeded to drive away. Off duty police Sgt. Howard Mills saw them drive off, took down the description of the car and its direction of travel, and called police headquarters at 9:34. This was in the direction of Needham Heights, which then (since demolished) had a fire station that was part of the beat of Haddock. He happened to be there commiserating with the on-duty firemen after his crossing guard duties when a call came from fire department headquarters about the robbery at 9:45. Informed, Haddock went to the front of the station, pistol drawn, only to hold fire as one hostage (the other having leapt to safety moments earlier) remained on the running board. Machine gun fire came from the car, striking Haddock three times with two mortal wounds. Helped onto a truck and driven to Glover Memorial Hospital, he died there early the next day. Legacy The town was shocked by the event. Its offices closed on Feb. 5 for the funeral of McLeod, and Feb. 6 for that of Haddock and hundreds turned out in bitterly cold weather with snow on the ground. Both days a parade of officers escorted the coffins through town in the funeral processions. At that time there was no formal pension plan for officers, but the Needham Citizens‚Äô Committee granted a payment of $50 a month for Haddock‚Äôs family that would last for the remainder of his wife‚Äôs life; she never remarried. The incident also spurred the cash-strapped town government to buy more equipment for the department and to hire more officers. In 2001, the town decided to rename the plaza in front of police headquarters after the two slain officers. A ceremony on May 15, attended by the two surviving daughters Helen Sadow and Phyllis Murphy and by other relatives, dedicated a plaque in their honor. For many years prior and continuing since, pencil drawings of the officers have hung in the station itself. In 2009 on the 75th anniversary of the event, in conjunction with the Needham Historical Society, a memorial to the officers was placed at the site, the plaque having disappeared. Of Haddock‚Äôs children only Helen Sadow, who would live just six weeks more, remained alive but was too ill to travel, however his great grandson Brian Barnicle (daughter Mary's grandson) attended with his wife Crystale and two children Sahsha and James. Within days of the crime, Faber was apprehended, followed by the Millens and Murton Millen‚Äôs wife Norma, who had waited in the getaway car. A trial quickly followed establishing their guilt of the murder of McLeod and on Jun. 7, 1935, the Millen brothers and Faber were executed. Norma Millen was convicted of being an accessory to the crimes and was sentenced to a year of imprisonment. The robbery and aftermath was featured as \\"The Millen-Faber Case\\" in Issue #24 of True Crime Comics, published in November, 1942. A documentary about the crime, by Risner Productions, appeared on the local Needham public access channel with the initial public showing of the film having occurred Feb. 16, 2013, at the Needham Town Hall. In 2015, Nathan Gorenstein (related to the Millens) published the most exhaustive accounting to date of the crime, entitled Tommy Gun Winter. Haddock has a memorial inscription (panel 62, W-10) as part of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, DC. Haddock‚Äôs grandson Michael Murphy serves as a Police Sergeant in Addison, Texas. Haddock's granddaughter, Monica Pratt, is a magazine editor and writer in Redlands, California. Another grandson is political scientist and opinion columnist Jeffrey Sadow. With Haddock‚Äôs death, this ended a streak of three generations of Haddocks with the first or middle name of \\"Oliver\\" who died prematurely; his father died of pneumonia, and his grandfather Oliver James Haddock (November 2, 1837 ‚Äì July 2, 1871), discharged from the Army for wounds suffered during the Civil War, died of consumption.

The building was constructed in 1896 to house the city's first high school, Great Falls High School (later known as Great Falls Central High School). The high school moved to new quarters in 1931, at which time the building was renamed Paris Gibson Junior High School. The junior high school vacated the premises in 1975 for a new building. In 1977, Paris Gibson Square Museum of Art was formed, and it took ownership of the building. It is one of six museums in the city. The structure was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in September 1976. The museum focuses primarily on contemporary art by artists from the region. Much of its collection consists of folk art, abstract art, postmodern art, and functional artwork such as jewelry. In addition to two floors of galleries, the museum also hosts an outdoor sculpture garden. The structure should not be confused with the Roman Catholic parochial school also named Great Falls Central High School.

It was incorporated on November 28, 1888.Federal Writers' Project, p. 150. By 1890, Black Eagle Dam had been built within the city limits on the Great Falls of the Missouri River, a meat packing industry (the largest between St. Paul, Minnesota, and Spokane, Washington) had arisen, a railway had come to town, and a silver smelter had been built. The city's public school system was established in 1886. That year, the city opened the Whittier Building (later known as Whittier Elementary School) and began holding ungraded educational instruction for all students there.Bureau of Agriculture, Labor and Industry, p. 306. Accessed 2011-05-06. Great Falls High School was founded in the fall of 1890 by the city of Great Falls after four teenage girls (newly arrived in the city) asked to receive a high school public education.Superintendent of Public Instruction, p. 65. Accessed 2011-05-06. The four young women constituted the first class, which met in a corner of a classroom in the Whittier Building (which, by that time, featured instruction in the sixth, seventh, and eighth grades). By September 1892, Great Falls High School was an independent school within the city public school system. Its 23 students also had a specified course of instruction (rather than general classes). The original Great Falls High School Building (pictured) was constructed in 1896. In 1896, the Great Falls Public Schools built the first Great Falls High School building. City voters passed an initiative in 1893 to sell bonds to build a high school, but the Panic of 1893 delayed construction.\\"About Us: Our History.\\" Paris Gibson Square. 2009. Accessed 2010-05-06. A design by local architect William White was chosen over three other proposals. =About the high school building= White's Romanesque Revival three-story structure featured a small central circular building, two rectangular wings, and an eight-story, four-faced clock tower. Construction on the building, located at 1400 First Avenue North, began in 1894. The high school was built of gray sandstone obtained from quarries near both Helena and Great Falls.Baumler, p. 33. Accessed 2010-05-06. The walls, which were thick at the bottom of the building but only thick at the roof, were sunk into the earth and stood on shale bedrock. To compact the foundation's backfill, a herd of sheep was driven around the structure 100 times. Wood for the interior supports, roof, and steps were cut from massive trees logged in the Rocky Mountains and floated down the Missouri River. The finished building featured a tin mansard roof (molded and painted to look like tile), gables, and an attic suspended from the roof joists. The interior woodwork was solid oak, all rooms had high wainscoting, the solid doors were thick, and highly detailed molded pediments were emplaced over each door. Ornate brass doorknobs and hinges were used throughout the building, and heat was supplied by cast iron radiators with delicate, filigreed covers. The building (whose original cost was estimated at $59,940) was completed by McKay Brothers in 1896 at a total cost of $110,000. The structure, which was designed to educate 500 students, contained 14 classrooms, a physical laboratory, a chemical laboratory, an art studio, and an assembly hall that could seat 400. A boiler system was installed in the basement. A brick annex, designed by architect W.R. Lowery, was constructed against the high school's south side in 1913 at a cost of $200,000.Madison, Erin. \\"Square's Past Saw Students, Explosion.\\" Great Falls Tribune. July 11, 2010. At this time, the boiler system was moved from the basement of the high school to the area between the main building and the annex. An urban legend (which may have begun as early as the 1910s) began to circulate that the old boiler room was turned into a swimming pool, and that a student drowned in the pool‚Äîleaving the high school haunted. An investigation in the 1990s revealed that although student Grant Mill from Great Falls High School did drown in 1915, he did not drown in a fictitious pool in the basement but rather in the Missouri River.Baumler, pp. 34-36. (Nonetheless, in July 2010, museum executive director Kathy Lear admitted that she once heard ghostly radio music coming from the basement late one afternoon.) The clock tower was removed in 1916 after its massive weight began to compromise the building. In 1917, a janitor was permitted to live on the site with his family. Frank Miles was given $150 and allowed to construct an apartment for himself, his wife, and his five children in the southeast corner of the high school's attic. It is uncertain how many years he and his family lived there.\\"What Else Happened at the Old High School?\\" Great Falls Tribune.

The north entrance was closed in the 1940s after the front steps were discovered to be sinking.\\"Square's Front Doors Reopened After Decades.\\" Great Falls Tribune. September 22, 2000. The driveway in front of this entrance was removed in the 1970s and replaced with sod. The south entrance was used as the main entrance after 1940. In the late 1960s, while repairs to the structure's roof were being made, a student broke into the building and climbed atop the elevator. He rode the elevator to the roof. But he touched a power line as he climbed off the elevator, giving him a severe electrical shock and causing his shirt to catch fire. He survived with minimal injuries. Another accident occurred shortly before the building was closed in the 1970s. A student in the gymnasium (which was housed in the brick annex), attempted to do chin-ups on a water pipe. The pipe snapped, causing the gym to be flooded. The junior high school vacated the premises in June 1975 for a new building at 2400 Central Avenue.Robison, p. 48. Several local Catholic parishes joined together in the late 1940s to construct a Catholic high school, named Great Falls Central High School. The low brick, steel, glass, and plaster building, constructed in 1950, occupied half a city block next to the Ursuline Academy. Two large wings were added in 1966. However, the building closed in 1973 due to lower enrollment, rising costs, and fewer volunteer priests and nuns to act as teachers. The Great Falls Public Schools purchased the structure in 1975 for $1.4 million. It spent another $800,000 renovating the building and adding an industrial arts wing on the southwest corner. Paris Gibson Junior High moved there in 1976 from the old high school building.Paris Gibson Junior High School closed in 1985 due to rapidly declining enrollment in the city school system.

Paris Gibson Square Museum of Art=Founding and early years= After the departure of Paris Gibson Junior High School from the old Great Falls High School building in June 1975, there was deep concern that the building might be demolished. The building was in disrepair from decades of use as a public school, the HVAC and mechanical systems needed upgrading, and the building was ill-prepared for mothballing. Vandalism, weather, and lack of use quickly began to take its toll, as the building sat vacant for a year. A local coalition of historic preservationists, concerned citizens, and art aficionados quickly formed to save the historic structure. Great Falls had long been home to the C. M. Russell Museum (dedicated to the works of Western artist Charles Marion Russell and others), but there was no institution supporting contemporary artists or art in other genres. The effort to save the historic high school began in 1974, during the citywide debate over whether to purchase the Catholic high school for use as a junior high. Jean Warden Dybdal and Pam Marlen, leaders in the Junior League chapter in Great Falls, organized an informal citizen's task force to come up with a plan to save the high school building. The initial plan was to create a community cultural center, although over time this changed into a more formal museum proposal. The Junior League and its allies successfully pushed the Great Falls Public Schools and Commissioners of Cascade County to sign an agreement whereby the structure became jointly owned by both governmental bodies. Cascade County agreed to provide funding for the structure's renovation and operations. The art museum was tasked with becoming financially self-sustaining. GFPS agreed to lease the structure to the museum for $1 a year, but not pay for any renovations. As part of the agreement with GFPS, the museum also agreed to devote a substantial portion of its resources to educating students and the public about art and art-making. Paris Gibson, the museum's namesake. The Paris Gibson Square Museum of Art (PGSMA) was incorporated as a nonprofit institution in 1976. It was named for Paris Gibson, the city's founder. The museum faced two immediate problems. First, the historic building was climate controlled for the storage or display of perishable art, and lacked storage space. Second, the museum had no collection to display. Renovations began immediately, with community volunteers providing most of the work. Some aspects of the building‚Äîsuch as the highly detailed brass doorknobs and door hinges, the carved door frames, and ornate iron grating over the air vents‚Äîwere retained. However, the high oak wainscoting and historic slate blackboards were covered over with drywall, which both protected them from damage as well as provided much-needed display space. As the Great Falls High School structure was renovated, the museum quickly began acquiring art for display, primarily through donations. In late 1976, it acquired 243 sculptures by Lee Steen, a nationally known folk artist from Roundup, Montana.Durden, Bob. \\"Paving the Way.\\" Behind the Vault Door: Selections from the Permanent Collection.

The explosion was planned by the producers of the motion picture Telefon. City and GFPS officials agreed that the 1913 brick annex, which was not historic and which marred the southern side of the structure, should be demolished. The film's producers sought permission from the city to film the demolition, which involved ramming the building with a prop Jeep and causing it to explode (saving the city $23,000). The explosives were rigged so that the explosion occurred solely in a southern, eastern, and western direction‚Äîaway from the historic building. The museum was undamaged. However, the explosion was so powerful that it hurled flaming debris onto the rooftops of several nearby homes, causing some damage.Wilmot, Paula. \\"Quiz Answers: 1970s Saw Big Changes in Electric City.\\" Great Falls Tribune. September 12, 2010. Initially, Cascade County budgeted for the museum's support annually. But in 1993, the county signed an agreement with PGSMA and the Cascade County Historical Society in which the county agreed to give the museum $66,000 a year for building maintenance. Additionally, the county sought voter approval for a mill levy which would generate income to support both the museum and the historical society. Under a formula included in the agreement, PGSMA received slightly more of the mill levy than the historical society.Lee, Sonja. \\"County Reduces Financial Support for Art Museum, Historical Society.\\" Great Falls Tribune.

In its early years, the museum built is collection and upgraded its space to accommodate its mission of displaying contemporary artwork as well as providing classrooms for lectures, art-making, teaching, and performances. Due to the limited size of the collection, the museum leased space to the Cascade County Historical Society, Great Falls Genealogy Society, Junior League, and Montana Wilderness Society.Wilmot, Paula. \\"Preservation Efforts Awarded.\\" Great Falls Tribune.

The other piece was local artist Mike Hollern's untitled, undated piece near the north entrance. This metal work is reminiscent of an upright chipped flint arrowhead with a fish's tail. Beginning in 1995, PGSMA began a $1.5 million \\"Centennial Campaign\\" fund-raising effort to make major improvements to its facility and to begin an endowment. The capital campaign, chaired by Diane Volk (whose father founded Volk Construction, a large building company in the state), surpassed its goal by $170,000 in early 1999. The funds allowed the museum to remove the sod from its north entrance and reinstall a historically accurate circular driveway. Local architectural firm L'Heureux Page Werner designed the new drive and staircase stabilization. The Helena, Montana, firm Dick Anderson Construction performed the stair work.Wilmot, Paula. \\"Preservation Commission Announces Awards.\\" Great Falls Tribune. May 14, 2002.

October 1, 2000. In addition to the driveway, all the windows in the building (which leaked significant amounts of air and permitted dust to filter inside) were replaced, the north steps were stabilized and repaired, the HVAC system repaired and made functional, the roof repaired, exhibit space renovated, oak trim throughout the building conserved and refinished, and the building's antique light fixtures restored (improving exhibition lighting dramatically). Historically accurate wooden doors replaced the existing doors, and the plaster in the entrance porticos repaired. The driveway and new stairs opened on September 30, 1999. The restoration effort won a Cascade County Historical Society Preservation Award in February 2000 and a Great Falls/Cascade County Historic Preservation Advisory Commission preservation award in May 2002. At the same time, the museum made changes to its grounds as well. The museum's Pam Marlen Memorial Garden underwent restoration, with new plantings and signage donated by Tilleraas and Forde (a local plant nursery). A new outdoor children's playground (in the museum's colors) was also constructed adjacent to the building's south entrance.

Under severe budgetary stress, the county reduced PGSMA's maintenance budget to $60,720. The county also advised that the mill levy would raise only $157,280 in 2003 (about $22,000 less than the previous year). The historical society asked the county to revise the 1993 agreement so that it would receive more of the mill levy, but the county declined. In response to the budget cuts, PGSMA implemented an admission fee in June 2003 for the first time in its history. The $2 admission fee applied only to adults who did not participate in the museum's membership program. (Children under 12 were also exempt.) PGSMA also cut its operating budget by 3 percent, slashed its travel and staff training budget by 75 percent, and cancelled its janitorial contract.

Seven galleries\\"Paris Gibson Square Showcases Up-to-Date Art.\\" Great Falls Tribune. March 30, 2008. with display space for paintings, sculpture, and other art forms occupy the first and second floors. A visitor information kiosk is also located on the first floor. The second floor also houses classroom space, where courses (by the museum and by other groups), performances, lectures, and other educational activities are offered. The basement houses additional classrooms.Paladino, K.L. (Kelly). \\"For the Love of Art.\\" Best of Great Falls Winter 2011, p. 16. Accessed 2013-01-09. The museum's collection focuses on contemporary art from artists who live in Montana, the western United States, and western Canada. In 2000, the museum's collection numbered 500 pieces. Due to the lack of a freight elevator and freight doors, the museum is limited in the size and weight of the pieces it may display. The classroom space at PGSMA is used primarily for educational offerings. The museum strives to offer programming which is not duplicative of that offered by the Children's Museum of Montana, C.M. Russell Museum, The History Museum, or the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail Interpretive Center. Two educational programs are especially distinctive. The museum's \\"Vision, Strength and Access Program\\" is aimed at at-risk youth; people with mental, physical and developmental challenges; and senior citizens. This program provides these individuals with the opportunity to create art in a setting specifically designed to meet their developmental, educational, emotional, mental, and physical challenges. In addition, the museum's \\"After School Program\\" is designed for children in kindergarten through the 12th grade. This program provides a nurturing and safe environment that not only allows children to express their creativity but also develop critical thinking skills. Both programs are free. In addition to educational offerings, the museum also allows use of its classrooms for community events, meetings, and private events. The museum hosts a small outdoor sculpture garden, and maintains the Pam Marlen Memorial Garden (which has seating for outdoor dining). In addition to art galleries and classroom space, museum amenities include a gift shop and a restaurant (open for lunch only). The museum had roughly 29,000 visitors in 2010. Since 1977, PGSMA has hosted a mid-November event known as Christmas Collection. The three-day event features arts and crafts from local artists, each of whom must apply to be in the show. According to museum officials, it is the largest arts and crafts show in the city. Tickets ($25 in 2011) are required in order to gain access to the show. Items range in price from $1 to $1,000, and the event raises $20,000 to $40,000 a year for the museum.Lashway, Zachery. \\"Christmas Collection Unveiled at Paris Gibson Square Museum.\\" KRTV.com.

In 1925, Hilldale won the best-of-nine series, five games to one. On the eve of the series, the Monarchs' star pitcher, Bullet Rogan, who had pitched a shutout in the deciding Game 7 of the NNL championship series, was injured while playing with his child at home, when a needle ran into his leg, leaving him unable to play in the World Series. Kansas City's manager and occasional pitcher was future Hall of Famer, 38-year-old Jos√© M√©ndez. Hilldale featured three future Hall of Famers‚Äîcatcher, Biz Mackey, third baseman, Judy Johnson, and 35-year-old backup catcher and pinch hitter, Louis Santop. Attendance for series was disappointing‚Äîdown more than 50 percent in comparison with the previous year's series. The financial results were so disappointing that one Kansas City Monarchs player said they would have been paid better barnstorming than playing in the series.

The teams qualifying to play in the league were the Kansas City Monarchs, the St. Louis Stars, the Memphis Red Sox, the Chicago American Giants, the Birmingham Black Barons, the Detroit Stars, the Indianapolis ABCs, and the Cuban Stars (West). The first half opened on April 27 and closed on July 8, and the second half ran from July 11 through September 16. The American Giants got off to an early lead in the NNL first half race, winning six of their first eight games.; The next week, Detroit pulled ahead, but by May 26 the Monarchs reached first place when they took three games of four from the visiting Detroit Stars.; ; The following week, the Monarchs took five straight from the American Giants, opening a lead on the other teams.; In mid-June, the St. Louis Stars narrowed the lead but weren't able to catch the Monarchs, and on June 29 the Monarchs clinched the first-half title with a 2‚Äì1 victory over the Cuban Stars.; ; The St. Louis Stars started the second half going 7‚Äì1, jumping to an early lead. Soon the Chicago American Giants gained a slight lead, and during the first half of August the race between St. Louis and Chicago was neck and neck.; ; When the American Giants dropped three games of four to the Monarchs from August 15 to 18 and then lost three straight to St. Louis on August 22 to 24, they dropped to third place and fell out of the race.; ; Kansas City were now in second place, and when they swept four games against St. Louis on September 5 to 8, they moved to within just .005 the Stars.; St. Louis held onto their lead, and finished the second half with a .760 winning percentage, .022 ahead of second place Kansas City. The NNL scheduled a best-five-of-nine championship series, with the first three games in St. Louis on September 19 through 21 and the next three games (home games for the Monarchs) played in Chicago because the American Association's Kansas City Blues were finishing their season at home, tying up Muehlebach Field. Kansas City won the first game 8 to 6, as Bullet Rogan pitched a complete game and Newt Allen, Dobie Moore, and Frank Duncan hit home runs. St. Louis won the second game 6 to 3, behind the pitching of Roosevelt Davis and excellent plays in the field by Willie Wells, Cool Papa Bell, and Branch Russell. Rain prevented the third game from being played on September 21 or 22. The league directors met and decided that the league championship series should be shortened to a best-of- seven series instead of best-of-nine. On September 23, St. Louis won the third game 3 to 2, behind a home run by Dewey Creacy, an RBI double by Bell, and another run scored by Bell on a wild throw by Moore. Kansas City evened the series in game four, played in Chicago on September 26, beating St. Louis 5 to 4 with Bullet Rogan not only pitching, but also getting four hits, including a game-winning single in the bottom of the ninth. The next day, St. Louis won 2 to 1, scoring both runs in the top of the ninth. On September 28, the final two games were scheduled as a doubleheader, with Kansas City needing to win both games to avoid elimination. The Monarchs won the first game 9 to 3 behind a strong pitching performance by William Bell. Rogan took the mound for the second game with only one day of rest and pitched a 4 to 0 shutout over the Stars, winning the league championship and the chance to face Hilldale in the World Series. =Hilldale= The ECL agreed to a 70-game schedule, with the league consisting of eight teams: the Bacharach Giants of Atlantic City, New Jersey, the Baltimore Black Sox, the Brooklyn Royal Giants, the Cuban Stars (East), the Harrisburg Giants, the Hilldale Club, the Lincoln Giants of New York City, and the Potomacs, formerly of Washington, DC, who announced that they were moving to Wilmington, Delaware for the 1925 season. The season opened on April 25 and finished on September 19.; ; Hilldale started the season with a 9‚Äì2 record, jumping to an early lead. By June 13, Harrisburg had taken a narrow lead and was scheduled to face Hilldale in a two-game series. Hilldale won the first game 11 to 9, retaking the lead, and the next day second game was called due to rain after Harrisburg had taken a 6‚Äì2 lead, prompting an outraged letter to the editor from Oscar Charleston, Harrisburg's manager and star center fielder. Charleston complained about the quality of the umpiring in the first game and the decision to call the second game.; Charleston's outburst prompted a strong rebuttal from Ed Bolden, owner of the Hilldale Club and chairman of the ECL commission. Shortly after the game, Harrisburg retook the lead and held it for nearly a month.; On July 19, Hilldale regained the lead when Baltimore swept a doubleheader from Harrisburg.; In mid-July, George Robinson, owner of the Wilmington Potomacs, announced that his team was folding; the league contracted to seven teams and the Potomacs players dispersed to other teams.; Over the next few weeks Hilldale widened its lead, and by early September they appeared to have the championship in hand. With the Potomacs no longer playing and with many teams having missed games, teams in the league were unable to complete their 70-game schedules. Hilldale easily won the ECL championship, finishing the season with a 45‚Äì13 record, while second-place Harrisburg finished 37‚Äì18. Series plans The ECL commissioners and Rube Foster, president of the NNL, announced that the World Series would be a best-five-of-nine series. The first four games would be played in the home field of the NNL champion on October 1, 2, 3, and 4, with October 5 and 6 available for make-up games in case of rain. Then the series would move to Philadelphia, the home for Hilldale, on October 8, 9, and 10. On Sunday, October 11, play would move to Jersey City, New Jersey because of blue laws in Philadelphia (though the leagues originally planned to play the game in New York City), and game nine (if necessary) would be played back in Philadelphia on October 12. Because the parks had to be secured in advance, the teams agreed to play exhibition games on October 10 and 11 if the series ended early. The games in Kansas City would take place at Muehlebach Field, the American Association ballpark, and the games in Philadelphia would take place at the Baker Bowl, the National League park, and the game in Jersey City would take place at the International League park.; ; Rosters Hilldale's regular lineup included Biz Mackey as the catcher, Tank Carr at first base, Frank Warfield, the manager, at second, Judy Johnson at third, Jake Stephens at shortstop, Clint Thomas in left field, George Johnson in center field, and Otto Briggs in right field. Briggs was the leadoff hitter, while Warfield batted second in four of the six games, Carr batted third, Mackey was cleanup hitter, Judy Johnson hit fifth, Thomas sixth, and George Johnson seventh. Their starting pitchers were Rube Currie, Phil Cockrell, Scrip Lee, and Nip Winters, with Red Ryan pitching in relief. From the bench, Louis Santop, Namon Washington, and Newt Robinson played as pinch hitters or defensive replacements. Kansas City's roster took a major hit the day before the first game, when Bullet Rogan, their star pitcher, ran a needle into his leg while playing with his child on the floor. While attempting to remove it himself, he broke it, and had to have it removed surgically, leaving him unable to play in the series. Utility player Dink Mothell was confined to bed and also unable to play. During the World Series, Kansas City's regular lineup consisted of Frank Duncan at catcher, Lemuel Hawkins at first base, Newt Allen at second, Newt Joseph at third, Dobie Moore at shortstop, Wade Johnston in left field, Hurley McNair in center, and George Sweatt in right. Their most common batting order had Johnston leading off, Allen batting second, McNair third, Moore in the cleanup spot, Joseph fifth, Hawkins sixth, Sweatt seventh, and Duncan eighth. The starting pitchers were Cliff Bell, William Bell, Nelson Dean, and Bill Drake, with manager Jos√© M√©ndez pitching in relief. The only Monarchs bench player to appear in the series was pinch hitter Hooks Foreman. Series=Game 1= Hilldale won the series opener in Kansas City, 5‚Äì2, in 12 innings. The winning pitcher was Rube Currie, who struck out six and gave up nine hits, two runs, and one walk in a 12-inning complete game. Bill Drake, who pitched the last two innings for Kansas City in relief for starter Cliff Bell, was charged with the loss. Otto Briggs drove in the go-ahead run with a single in the top of the 12th. The game was scoreless until the bottom of the fourth inning, when McNair led off with a single to left, then scored on Moore's double to right. In the top of the seventh, Hilldale evened the score. Thomas drew a walk to lead off the inning, and with the infield drawn in looking for a bunt, George Johnson drilled a single into center, advancing Thomas to third. The next batter, Warfield, hit the first pitch for a long fly to right field, and Thomas scored after the catch. The game remained tied 1‚Äì1 through the ninth inning, so it went to extra innings. In the top of the 11th, Briggs led off with a line drive single up the middle, which Cliff Bell attempted to catch, hurting his hand. After Bell walked Stephens, Kansas City brought in Drake as a relief pitcher. The next batter, Carr, singled to left- center and Briggs attempted to score from second, but was out on George Johnson's throw to the plate. According to The Chicago Defender, \\"in tagging Briggs, he [Duncan] pulled him two feet off and away from the plate for an out. The crowd rose en masse to cheer. It was indeed a great play as well as a great peg by Johnston.\\" However, the next batter, Mackey, singled to center and scored Stephens from second, giving Hilldale the lead. In the bottom of the inning, McNair reached with one out on an infield single. He then stole second, and Moore tripled to right, scoring McNair. But when the next batter, Joseph, hit a ground ball to third, Judy Johnson was able to bluff Moore back to third before throwing Joseph out. Hawkins then grounded out to short, ending the inning with a 2‚Äì2 tie. In the top of the 12th, Drake hit the first batter he faced, George Johnson. Warfield singled to right, advancing Johnson to third. After Currie struck out, Briggs singled to left, scoring Johnson, and advanced to second on the throw to the plate. After Stephens struck out, Carr singled and drove in McNair and Warfield. Mackey then struck out to retire the side, but Hilldale was ahead 5 to 2. In the bottom of the inning, Sweatt grounded out to the pitcher, Duncan flew out to left, and Foreman, pinch hitting for Drake, grounded out to second, ending the game. =Game 2= In the second game, the Monarchs evened the series with a 5‚Äì3 victory. Nelson Dean was the winning pitcher as he struck out two and gave up eight hits, three runs, and four walks in innings. William Bell got the save. The losing pitcher, Phil Cockrell, was hurt by a couple of costly errors, as he struck out four and gave up 10 hits and four walks in a complete game. In the bottom of the eighth, Kansas City broke open a 2‚Äì2 tie when an error by Jake Stephens was followed by RBI singles by Lemuel Hawkins and Frank Duncan. In the top of the ninth, Hilldale answered with one run, but was unable to catch the Monarchs. Kansas City got the first run on the board in the first inning, when McNair knocked a one-out double over Thomas's head in left field and Allen drove him in with a single to right. In the top of second, Hilldale responded with two runs. Mackey led off with a walk and Judy Johnson bunted him to second. Thomas then singled to left center, driving home Mackey. George Johnson hit a single to center, and Thomas advanced to third and Johnson to second when McNair fumbled the ball. Hilldale then put on a squeeze play to score Thomas, with Warfield out at first. Hilldale held onto their 2‚Äì1 lead until the seventh inning. In the top of the fourth, they threatened when Judy Johnson led off with a single and stole second. With two outs, Warfield hit a line drive headed for right field, but Hawkins made a leaping catch. In the bottom of the seventh, Sweatt led off for Kansas City with a single to center. Duncan sacrificed, then Dean doubled to right to score Sweatt, tying the game at two runs apiece. In the bottom of the eighth inning, Allen led off with an infield hit. Moore struck out, but Joseph reached when Hilldale shortstop Stephens fumbled a ground ball. Hawkins then singled to center, scoring Allen. Next, Sweatt walked, loading the bases, and Duncan hit a bounder to third that Judy Johnson had to leap to catch, allowing Joseph to score an unearned run and Duncan to reach first. Dean then hit a fly ball that Stephens caught on the edge of the grass, but he let Hawkins score from third. The Chicago Defender wrote, \\"The crowd was puzzled, because it looked like Stephens had plenty of time to set himself to throw. It looked to the scorers as if he hadn't figured wheretu Hawkins would take a chance to score after the catch. When he did wake up he threw wide to Mackey.\\" The Monarchs now led 5‚Äì2. In the top of the ninth, Warfield led off with a walk. Cockrell grounded into a force play by Moore at second, then Briggs singled to center. Santop, pinch hitting, made the second out on a fly to right center, then Carr singled to right to score Cockrell. An intentional walk was issued to Mackey, and Judy Johnson ended the game with a fly out to center. =Game 3= Hilldale won the third game, 3‚Äì1, in ten innings, taking a series lead of two games to one. Red Ryan, who pitched two scoreless innings in relief of Hilldale starter Scrip Lee, was credited with the win, and Monarchs manager and pitcher Jos√© M√©ndez, who gave up all three runs in a three-inning relief outing for starter William Bell, was charged with the loss. The game was scoreless until the bottom of the eighth, when Kansas City scored a run, which was matched by Hilldale in the top of the ninth. Hilldale's decisive runs in the top of the tenth‚Äîan RBI double by Namon Washington, followed by an RBI single by Newt Robinson‚Äîwere provided by late inning substitutes. Although no runs were scored in the first seven innings, Hilldale mounted several threats. In the second inning, they left runners at second and third after a walk by Thomas and a double by Stephens. In the third, Briggs led off with an infield single and was sacrificed to second, but was then picked off by Bell. In the fourth, Mackey led off with a single, and Judy Johnson followed with a double. Thomas then grounded to short, and Moore threw out Mackey at the plate. After Thomas stole second, George Johnson lined out to first. Stephens walked to load the bases, but Lee struck out to end the threat. In the top of the eighth, Carr led off with a walk, Mackey got an infield hit, and Judy Johnson singled to short left to load the bases with no outs. M√©ndez came in to relieve William Bell. Thomas grounded to short, and Moore threw out Carr at home. Santop pinch hit for George Johnson; according to The Chicago Defender: \\"'Big Bertha' hit one to Moore that was hotter than tabasco sauce. Moore knocked it down with his gloved hand as it bounded fast over the ground, stumbled over second, forcing Thomas out and throwing to Hawkins from a half crouching position, getting Santop headed for first and making one of the prettiest of double plays.\\" Meanwhile, Lee held the Monarchs hitless through the first four innings, and to one hit through seven. With two outs in the bottom of the eighth, the Monarchs offense finally came alive, when Johnston singled to right, and McNair reached on an error by Carr. Allen then singled to right, driving in Johnston to take a 1‚Äì0 lead. Hilldale responded in the top of the ninth, when Cockrell, pinch hitting for Lee, reached base with a one-out walk. Briggs followed with a single to left, and Warfield grounded to shortstop, forcing Briggs at second. With two outs, Carr singled to right, scoring Cockrell and tying the game. In the bottom of the ninth, Hilldale reliever Ryan retired the side in order. In the top of the tenth, Judy Johnson led off with a single to center. Thomas sacrificed him to second, then Washington doubled to center to drive in the go-ahead run. Robinson singled to right, scoring Washington, and took second on the throw to the plate, but was thrown out trying to take third as well. In the bottom of the tenth, Duncan hit a one-out double to left, but Foreman and Johnston both flied out to end the game, with a 3‚Äì1 victory for Hilldale. =Game 4= Hilldale won the fourth game, 7‚Äì3, in front of the largest crowd of the series. The winning pitcher was Nip Winters, who pitched a complete game, allowing eight hits and three runs, striking out eight, and walking three. The loser, Bill Drake, also pitched a complete game and yielded 11 hits and seven runs, struck out three, and walked three. A high wind caused both teams trouble with judging fly balls. Hilldale took a 2‚Äì1 lead in the fourth when Biz Mackey tripled and Judy Johnson drove him in with a sacrifice fly. They added a run in the fifth, and Kansas City answered in the seventh, narrowing the margin to 3‚Äì2. In the top of the ninth, Hilldale broke the game open with four runs in the top of the ninth, and the Monarchs only managed one run in the bottom of the ninth as they fell behind in the series, three games to one. In the top of the first, Warfield singled with one out on a hit that Allen was just able to knock down. Carr then singled to center, with the wind causing an unusual hop that enabled Warfield to race home with the first run. In the bottom of the second, Kansas City answered, with Joseph hitting a one- out triple to right. Hawkins then grounded to Warfield, who threw home. Joseph slid into home spikes first, and Mackey dropped the ball, allowing the run to score and tying the game. In the top of the fourth, Mackey hit a one-out triple to right field. Judy Johnson followed with a long fly out to right, scoring Mackey and giving Hilldale a 2‚Äì1 lead. In the next inning, Hilldale added on. With two outs, Stephens grounded to short and beat out Moore's throw. He then stole second and advanced to third on a passed ball. Briggs singled to right, scoring Stephens. In the bottom of the seventh, Sweatt led off with a hit to right. After Duncan struck out, Drake hit a fly ball to center, which the wind caused George Johnson to misjudge; when it rolled away, Drake reached third with a triple, driving in Sweatt, and narrowing Hilldale's lead to 3‚Äì2. In the top of the ninth, George Johnson led off with a triple to center. Winters drove him in with a single to center. Stephens grounded to third, forcing Winters at second. Briggs followed with a double to right, advancing Stephens to third, and Warfield tripled to right-center, driving in two more runs, and scored himself when Joseph missed McNair's throw to third. Kansas City entered the bottom of the ninth trailing 7‚Äì2, and Joseph led off with a single to right. Hawkins beat out an infield hit to Judy Johnson at third. Sweatt singled to right, scoring Joseph and advancing Hawkins to third. The next three Kansas City batters, however, made easy outs, ending the game 7‚Äì3. =Game 5= The series resumed in Philadelphia, where Hilldale won their first home game, 2‚Äì1, taking a series lead of four games to one. The winning pitcher was Rube Currie, who gave up six hitsAccording to The Chicago Defender Currie gave up six hits; whereas according to The Afro-American, he gave up seven hits. and one run, striking out four and walking one in a complete game. The losing pitcher, Cliff Bell, lasted innings and gave up eight hits and two runs, striking out one. Both of Hilldale's runs came in the fourth inning, when Tank Carr hit a one-out solo home run, which was followed by a pair of doubles by Biz Mackey and Clint Thomas. Moore led off the top of the second inning with a hit off Currie's glove, but he was caught off first by catcher Mackey and thrown out trying to advance to second. In the top of the fourth, McNair led off with a single to right, and a one-out single by Joseph advanced him to second. Again, the Monarchs lost their opportunity to a baserunning blunder, when McNair was caught trying to steal third with two outs. In the bottom of the fourth, Hilldale took the lead with Carr's one-out solo home run over the high right field wall. Mackey followed with a double hit against the same wall. With two outs, Thomas hit a ground ball past Moore for a double, scoring Mackey, and giving Hilldale a 2‚Äì0 lead. In the bottom of the fifth, they threatened again with Stephens and Currie hitting a pair of singles to lead off the inning. Briggs then hit into a double play, and with Dean brought in to relieve Cliff Bell, Hilldale tried a squeeze play, but Warfield was thrown out on the bunt. In the top of the sixth, Allen hit a one-out double to the fence in center field. With two outs, Moore doubled to right, driving in Allen and narrowing Hilldale's lead to one run. In the bottom of the sixth, Hilldale had runners on first and third with one out, and Thomas hit a fly caught by Allen in short right near the foul line. Carr tried to score from third, and was gunned down on the relay from Allen to Hawkins to Duncan. Kansas City's only hit in the last three innings was a one-out double by Duncan in the top of the seventh, so they were unable to catch Hilldale. =Game 6= On October 9, heavy rain forced the sixth game to be delayed a day. On Saturday, October 10, play resumed despite freezing temperatures and gusting winds that kept all but the hardiest of fans away. Phil Cockrell, a spitball pitcher, was the winner, as he allowed eight hits and two runs, striking out six, and walking four, in a complete game. William Bell, the loser, also went the distance, as he allowed nine hits and five runs, struck out four, and walked one. Hilldale scored runs in the fourth and fifth innings and two in the sixth, then Biz Mackey hit a solo home run to lead off the seventh. The Monarchs answered with one run each in the seventh and ninth innings, but fell to Hilldale, 5‚Äì2, ending the series with Hilldale victorious five games to one. The Hilldale Club was first to score in the bottom of the fourth, when Thomas hit a two-out double to center. George Johnson drove him in with a single to left. In the fifth, Warfield reached base with one out on an error by Moore. Carr walked, and Mackey doubled off the right field wall, driving in Warfield. Judy Johnson grounded to Bell, and Carr was thrown out trying to get back to third after attempting to score on the play. Thomas flied out to end the inning, and Hilldale was up, 2‚Äì0. In the sixth, Cockrell reached with one out on an error by Joseph. Stephens doubled, driving in Cockrell. Briggs grounded out to Allen, advancing Stephens to third, and then Stephens scored when Warfield beat out a hit to Joseph at third, widening Hilldale's lead to 4‚Äì0. In the top of the seventh, Allen led off with a single to right. McNair sacrificed, and after Moore flied out, Allen stole third. Joseph was hit by a pitch, and Hawkins beat out a slow roller to Judy Johnson at third, scoring Allen, and making the score, 4‚Äì1. In the bottom of the seventh, Mackey led off with a home run over the right field fence, making it 5‚Äì1. The Monarchs' final opportunity came in the top of the ninth, when McNair led off the inning with a double off the scoreboard. Moore followed with a double off the right field wall, scoring McNair. Joseph reached base safely on an error by Judy Johnson. But when Hawkins hit a short fly to left, Thomas raced in to catch it. Stephens fumbled a ground ball hit by Duncan, loading the bases with one out. Foreman pinch hit for Sweatt, but struck out, and George Johnson sprinted in to catch William Bell's fly for the last out, ending the game, 5‚Äì2, and the series, five games to one. =Exhibition Game= Because the ballpark in Jersey City had already been retained, the two teams played an exhibition on game in Jersey City on Sunday, October 11. The Monarchs' young pitcher, Chet Brewer, held the champions to one run, as Kansas City beat Hilldale, 6‚Äì1. The Hilldale players made seven errors, and the Hilldale starter, Nip Winters, gave up five walks. Although the game did not count in the series, it was counted in the financial results of the series. Financial results Total attendance for the series (including the exhibition game) was 20,067, less than half the 45,857 who had attended the ten games of the 1924 series. Total receipts were $21,045, in comparison with $52,113 the previous year. Total expenses were $15,173, including $3,748 for park rent, $5,543 for railroad fares and hotels for the two ball clubs, $2,050 for war tax, and $827 for umpires. A surplus of $5,872 was available for distribution, with $1,233 going to the owners of the victorious Hilldale club, the same amount split among their players, and $822 each going to the owner and the players of the Kansas City Monarchs. Newspaper reports described the financial results as disappointing and attributed the poor attendance to cold weather and a shortened and lopsided series. Frank A. Young, sports editor of The Chicago Defender, noted that each player on the victorious Hilldale club received only about $80, or $6.66 a day, for his efforts, and quoted a Kansas City player who said, \\"We could have made more in two games barnstorming than we'll get out of the whole series.\\" NotesSee also *1925 Negro World Series References  * Colored World Series 1925 Colored World Series 1925 Colored World Series Category:Negro World Series Colored World Series Colored World Series Category:1925 in American sports ","title":"1925 Colored World Series"},{"id":"38183596","title":"List of Car Warriors episodes"},{"id":"38183608","text":"Cythnia is a genus of sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Rissoellidae.

It was developed by Jonathan Brandt and Chris Kampf with Sean P. Dennis in 2008, and it was first published by Tessera Games LLC in 2009.http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/40943/booleo Game The deck consists of 64 cards: :* 48 ‚ÄúGate‚Äù cards using three Boolean operators AND, OR, and XOR :::8 OR cards resolving to 1 :::8 OR cards resolving to 0 :::8 AND cards resolving to 1 :::8 AND cards resolving to 0 :::8 XOR cards resolving to 1 :::8 XOR cards resolving to 0 :* 8 NOT cards :* 6 Initial Binary cards, each displaying a ‚Äú0‚Äù and a ‚Äú1‚Äù aligned to the two short ends of the card :* 2 Truth Tables (used for reference, not in play) Play Starting with a line of Initial Binary cards laid perpendicular to two facing players, the object of the game is to be the first to complete a logical pyramid whose final output equals that of the rightmost Initial Binary card facing that player. The game is played in ‚Äúdraw one play one‚Äù format. The pyramid consists of decreasing rows of gate cards, where the outputs of any contiguous pair of cards comprise the input values to a single card in the following row. The pyramid, therefore, has Initial Binary values as its base and tapers to a single card closest to the player. By tracing the ‚Äúflow‚Äù of values through any series of gate, every card placed in the pyramid must make ‚Äúlogical sense‚Äù, i.e. the inputs and output value of every gate card must conform to the rule of that gate card. The NOT cards are played against any of the Initial Binary cards in play, causing that card to be rotated 180 degrees, literally ‚Äúflipping‚Äù the value of that card from 0 to 1 or vice versa. By changing the value of any Initial Binary, any and all gate cards which ‚Äúflow‚Äù from it must be re-evaluated to ensure its placement makes ‚Äúlogical sense‚Äù. If it does not, that gate card is removed from the player's pyramid. Since both players' pyramids share the Initial Binary cards as a base, ‚Äúflipping‚Äù an Initial Binary has an effect on both players' pyramids. A principal strategy during game play is to invalidate gate cards in the opponent's logic pyramid while rendering as little damage to one‚Äôs own pyramid in the process. Some logic gates are more robust than others to a change to their inputs. Therefore, not all logic gate cards have the same strategic value. The standard edition of the game does not contain NAND, NOR, or XNOR gates. It is possible, therefore, for a player to arrive at an unresolvable pair of inputs. Variations The number of cards in Booleo will comfortably support a match between two players whose logic pyramids are six cards wide at their base. By combining decks, it is possible to construct larger pyramids or to have matches among more than two players. For example: :* Four players may play individually or as facing teams by arranging a cross of Initial Binary cards, where four logic pyramids extend like compass points in four directions :* Four or more players may build partially overlapping pyramids from a long base of Initial Binary cards Tessera Games also published bOOleO-N Edition, which is identical to Booleo with the exception that it uses the inverse set of logic gates: NAND, NOR, and XNOR. bOOleO-N Edition may be played on its own, or it may be combined with Booleo.

The French army and the Chadian army fought armed Salafist jihadist groups led by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Ansar Dine. After being defeated in January in the Battle of Konna and the Battle of Diabaly, the jihadists abandoned Timbuktu and retreated into the Adrar Tigharghar, a mountain of the Adrar of Ifoghas in northeastern Mali, which has been their sanctuary for years. The French started quickly a pursuit, and they took control of the towns of Tessalit and Aguelhok and begun the operation Panther in the Tigharghar. The first clashes erupt on February 18 and are mainly concentrated in the Ametettai Valley. It is caught between two armored columns, one French to the west and another Chadian to the east, while the paratroopers manage to surprise the jihadists by attacking on foot from the north. The valley is taken on March 3 and jihadists begin to gradually abandon the Tigharghar. Excavation missions and some skirmishes, however, continue to take place the following days. The operations cease on March 31. The battle was a turning point in the war, as with the capture of the Tigharghar, the jihadists lose their main sanctuary in the Sahel as well as most of their military arsenal, taken from the Malian army or Libya .Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, Paris, Tallandier, 2014, 650 p. Deployment of Franco-Chadian forces in the Kidal region The evening of January 29, 2013, two Tiger helicopters, a Gazelle and four Puma reach Kidal airport and disembark 30 French soldiers of the CPA-10 and the Penfentenyo commando against MNLA pick-ups. They are followed by three planes landing men of 1 RPIMa and Commando de Montfort. The officer in charge of the French special forces then meets Colonel Mohamed Ag Najem, commander-in-chief of the MNLA's military wing. The French then settle in one of the two military camps of the city and begin their cohabitation with the Tuareg rebels, but unlike Gao, Timbuktu , and the southern cities where they had been celebrated as liberators, in Kidal the French are seen as the vanguard of the Malian army and the reception of the population is much colder.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 368.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 347-350. But the goal of the French army, at that time, remains the Tigharghar . From the end of January, the surroundings of the Adrar are bombarded by Rafale. Then on the evening of February 2, a first mass air raid struck the interior of the mountain; four Mirage and four Rafale destroy twelve objectives, supported by three Atlantic, a Harfang drone, an AWACS and Tiger helicopters. The raid mainly targets the area known as the \\"Garage\\", west of Ametettai, where two BMP-1 armored vehicles have been located, as well as an anti-aircraft battery that was probably inoperative.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 373.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 374-375. On 1 February, a column of fifteen vehicles of the MNLA and thirty men from the French Special Forces leave Kidal to conduct a joint operation towards the Adrar Tigharghar . The night of 2 to 3, the French and the Tuaregs separate. The first pursued towards the valley of Assamalmal, targeted a few hours earlier by the air strikes. On the spot, the balance sheet is rather thin, no body nor destroyed vehicle is discovered, only a stock of gasoline and some motorcycles were swept by the bombs. The Touareg rebels, meanwhile, take control of the town of Aguelhok where the French come back from Assamalmal to join them. The population, strongly hostile to jihadists, welcomes newcomers. The MNLA captured some suspects and discovered several hundred kilos of ammunition, which he then handed over to the French forces as a sign of goodwill.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 375-377. France was also seeking the help of Chad's President Idriss D√©by. He agreed to deploy his army in the Adrar of Ifoghas. On February 3, the first Chadian soldiers arrived in Kidal.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 379-380. On the night of February 7 to 8, the French special forces lead Operation Takouba on Tessalit. Thirty men from the 13 th RDP, CPA-10, a marine CTLO and the ESNO are parachuted near the airport. They spot a piece of runway where two C-160 Transall can land and land four vehicles and a few more men. From Aguel'hoc, the 30 soldiers - mainly from the 1st RPIMa - who had led the reconnaissance mission in the Assamalmal valley are also moving on Tessalit. In the morning, the special forces make their junction and enter the city without encountering any resistance. A few hours later, from Kidal, the Chadians of General Deby arrived on their turn after passing through Aguel'hoc. Then, 54 soldiers of the 1st RCP are deposited by a third plane. Finally, a sub-GTIA party from Gao, consisting mainly of soldiers from 1 RIMa and forming a column of 90 vehicles, arrives at the scene and invests the military camp of Amachach.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 383-393. On February 13, the Special Forces made a first foray into the Tigharghar during Operation Tazidert, whose goal is to find a record of the Western hostages held by AQIM. They infiltrate the \\"camp of the sands\\" and the \\"camp of the rocks\\", but find no trace of the hostages, or - to their surprise - jihadists. The operation ends on February 16.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 416-419 At the same time, GTIA 4 unfolds in the far north. 400 French soldiers are present in Tessalit on February 12. The first patrols, dubbed Panther 0 and Panther I, take place between Tessalit and the Tigharghar, but they encounter nothing.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 421-422Bernard Barrera, Op√©ration Serval : notes de guerre, Mali 2013, Paris, Seuil, 2015, 433 p. (). Order of Battle=Islamist coalition forces= Adrar Tigharghar was mainly the territory of AQIM and Ansar Dine, while MUJAO was more established in the region of Gao. However elements of the Signatories by the blood and Boko Haram were also present in the Adrar. Mercenaries from the Polisario Front also reportedly took part in the fighting despite the denials of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 393.Bernard Barrera, Op√©ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 214-217.Fr√©d√©ric Gout, Lib√©rez Tombouctou ! : journal de guerre au Mali, Paris, Tallandier, 2015, 251 p. () Jihadist forces in Tigharghar were estimated at between 400 and 600 men. For the Directorate of Military Intelligence (DRM) the number of their fighters would be about 500.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 372. The Tuareg Islamists of Ansar Dine were led by their leader, Iyad Ag Ghali. On March 26, the movement said in a statement that it is continuing the fighting in northern Mali. Ag Ghali knows the region well, Adrar Tigharghar was already his base during the Tuareg rebellions, when he commanded the Popular Movement of Azawad. Among the other Ansar Dine chiefs present in the Adrar was Ibrahim Ag Inawalen, commander of the region of Aguel'hoc and former colonel of the Malian army.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 591.Serge Daniel, Les mafias du Mali : trafics et terrorisme au Sahel, Paris, Descartes & Cie, 2014, 320 p. (). \\"Emir of the Sahara\\", Djamel Okacha, known as \\"Yahia Abu el-Hammam\\", the leader of the AQIM forces in Mali, according to a jihadist source of the Sahara Medias agency, he took part in the battle. Four brigade or katiba chiefs were subordinated to him. Abu Zeid, the emir of the katiba \\"Tarek Ibn Ziyad\\", participated in the battle. The presence of Abdelkrim al-Targui, chief of the katiba \\"al-Ansar\\" and Sedane Ag Hita, called \\"Abu Abdel Hakim al-Kidali\\", who commanded the katiba \\"Youssef Ibn Tachfin\\" were also possibly fought, as the area of Tigharghar being considered their domain. On the other hand, Mohamed Lemine Ould El-Hassen, emir of the katiba \\"al-Fourghan\\", was killed on 24 February by the French special forces during the Battle of Timetrine.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 451. In their radio communications, Islamist insurgents routinely nicknamed the French \\"dogs\\" and Chadians or helicopters as \\"flies\\". Excellent fighters with light weapons and with real military training, jihadists were much less skilled with heavy weapons, they include guns, SA-7 ground-to-air missiles or RPG -rocket launcher 29 which they do not know how to use. In comparison with the Taliban , which the French also faced in Afghanistan, the jihadists of Mali were considered better organized and more tenacious, able to sacrifice themselves while the Afghan insurgents used to flee to limit the losses. In contrast, FDIs were at this time less used than in Afghanistan and were generally poorly manufactured. Some fighters, including child soldiers, have also used drugs to support the shock of fighting, bags will be found near corpses including ketamine, an anesthetic that inhibits fear and erases pain.Bernard Barrera, Op√©ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 181.Fr√©d√©ric Gout, Lib√©rez Tombouctou !

It included five Puma, three Gazelle and two Tiger helicopters based at Tessalit. On the side of the air force, eight Rafale based in N'Djamena and six Mirage 2000D based in Bamako take turns bombing the Tigharghar. For the aerial reconnaissance, Operation Serval mobilized five Atlantique 2 and two Mirage F1 CRs. It also has a Harfang drone 108. For the vehicles, 22 AMX-10 RC tanks are engaged in the battle 109 and for the two Caesar artillery of the 11th Marine Artillery Regiment ( 11th RAMa) are deployed and supported by an intelligence battery of 68 African Artillery Regiment ( 68th RAA). Supply between Gao and Tessalit is provided by a logistic detachment of the 511th Train Regiment ( 511 th RT). The 9th Advanced Surgical Antenna, initially based in S√©var√© , is deployed in Tessalit. The command of the land operations is assured by Brigadier General Bernard Barrera. A forward command post is established in Tessalit on 12 February . This staff, called the G08, is under the leadership of Colonel Laurent de Bertier de Sauvigny and Xavier Vanden Neste and is made up of about forty to fifty people from the 11th Parachute Brigade, a few officers of the 3rd Light Armored Brigade were soon amalgamated to form a centralized command post. The special forces and the DGSE set up in Kidal where they have a helicopter base, their mission being to locate the jihadist leaders and the hostages. The special forces are autonomous, they act without coordinating with the Serval brigade and do not come under the command of General Barrera. 1,200 French soldiers take part initially in the operation Panth√®re, at the end of the fighting their number is 1,400 . The majority of French soldiers engaged in battle have combat experience, most of them participated in the Afghanistan war, some even in the Gulf War . In addition to Afghanistan, the air forces also took part in Operation Harmattan in Libya . Many infantry have already experienced extreme heat similar to that of Tighargh√¢r in the FFDj Djibouti.Fr√©d√©ric Gout, Lib√©rez Tombouctou !

Their numbers changed during the fighting. In February, 800 men took part in the offensive on the Ametettai Valley, in mid-March 1,400 to 1,500 Chadian soldiers were deployed in the Adrar Tighargh√¢r. They had more than a hundred armored vehicles, including about ten BMP-1s 128. The elite troops of the presidential guard form the spearhead of this force, 500 of its members have been integrated into the contingent deployed in Mali. Troops of the National Guard and Nomad of Chad (GNNT) and the Close Action Detachment (DAR) were also engaged in the Adrar. Chadian forces in Mali were commanded by General Oumar Bikimo. The second command, initially ensured by General Abderrahmane Youssouf Me√Øri, passes from mid-February to General Mahamat Idriss D√©by Itno, son of President Idriss D√©by. From 2005 to 2010, the Chadian army fought hard during the Chadian civil war. Its soldiers, most of whom are of Zaghawa ethnicity, are accustomed to the climate and fighting in the desert and are considered to be by far the most experienced and seasoned African forces deployed in Mali.Bernard Barrera, Op√©ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 241. The campaign=Battle of the Tibeggatine Valley, February 18‚Äì20= On February 18, the French army launched Operation Panther IV. The objective was to find the forces of AQIM and Ansar Dine, as the army had knowledge that jihadists were present in the Tighargh√¢r but did not know what their defense system and the areas they intend to protect as a priority. The operation begins with a reconnaissance mission conducted by GTIA 4 on In Taghlit, a village used by jihadists to stock up, in the Tibeggatine Valley, west of the Ametettai Valley. The column was made up of soldiers from 1st RIMa, GCP from 2nd REP and 17th RGP, artillerymen from 35th RAP and some Tuareg guides from the Malian army, about 150 men.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 422-428. The French entered the village of In Taghlit in the morning without encountering resistance. They found only a few unarmed men who all say that the jihadists had fled for a dozen days. The paratroopers then go to a nearby wadi and discover a first abandoned logistic depot. They unearth trucks filled with shells, a ton of food, telephones, an engine, gas drums and a large generator. In the afternoon, the French pushed their recognition to the village of Tabankort and camped there to spend the night. The next morning, they divided into two groups. The first, consisting of two platoons of porpoises goes north on the village of Abancko where intelligence suspects the presence of an ammunition depot. The soldiers meet an old man on the spot who guides them to a stockpile of shells that the jihadists had taken over the Malian army after the Battle of Tessalit. The second group headed for the area called the \\"Garage\\" bombed by aviation on February 2. Coming from the west, the French stop in front of two rocky mounds, about forty meters high, between which a vehicular passage runs eastward. Veteran officers who fought in Afghanistan and Tuareg guides suspect an ambush and the column is moving cautiously. Around 9 am, the leading vehicles were attacked by a jihadists ambush at 300 meters. A first group of a dozen fighters is located in a green zone a little further north. The soldiers retreat, take cover and half an hour later the Mirage 2000 D intervene and destroy a machine gun nest. The three AMX-10 RC tanks then take control of the neck between the two mounds and open fire with their 105 mm guns. Despite the intensity of the fire, the jihadists do not hesitate to move short in front of the tanks, they send some rockets with RPG-7, but the range is too fair. As for the tanks, they fire with thirty explosive shells.Bernard Barrera, Op√©ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 155-160. On their side, the paratroop legionaries of the 2nd REP attack the mound on the right with the aim of controlling the dominant position and to prevent the jihadists from overflowing from the south. They seize the summit but collide with other fighters on the counter. A legionnaire is killed, hit by a bullet that ricochets on his bullet-proof vest in the armpit and reaches him in the head. He collapses and his body rushes down the slope.Bernard Barrera, Op√©ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 155-156. On the left, the paratroopers of the 17th RGP are in turn attacked by a group posted about fifty meters. Returning from Abancko, the porpoises of 1st RIMa join the fight from the north. Then, at 10:45, a Mirage drops a GBU on the counterpoise. In the south, the jihadists were contained. The planes remained permanently on zone, supplied by an American tanker. Other Mirage 2000 D, then Rafale, a Puma helicopter loaded with ammunition and finally, at the end of the afternoon, two Tiger helicopters arrive on the scene. The clashes cease in the afternoon, after having lasted five hours. The French retreat about ten kilometers to the west, in an isolated area to spend the night there. According to the French staff, more than 20 jihadists were killed during the fighting. French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian mentions 25 killed. According to Jean-Christophe Notin, most of the losses were probably inflicted by the tanks of the 1st RIMa. The next morning, the column returns to Tessalit, but sone stay put with their tanks. Then in the afternoon, General Barrera decides to send two Tiger helicopters from Gao to check if the jihadists were still there. When the tigers arrived on the old battlefield, the two devices are extensively strafed. One of them is riddled with 21 impacts and fails to be shot. It retreats to Tessalit urgently. On the ground, the tanks of the 1 stRIMa open fire for an hour, while the second Tiger, less severely hit, and destroys a pickup in the green zone.Fr√©d√©ric Gout, Lib√©rez Tombouctou ! Journal de guerre au Mali, p. 165-168.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 427-428. According to Colonel Thierry Burkhard, spokesman for the staff of the armed forces, \\"a little less than a dozen terrorists\\" are \\"neutralized\\" during this day. Porpoises the 1 st RIMa fold again and hold their area for six days without being attacked. After the fighting on 19 and 20 February and the fierce resistance of the jihadists, the French staff is now convinced that the Ametettai Valley is the heart of the AQIM device in the Adrar. From the beginning of the fighting, the intelligence intercepted dozens of calls by satellite phones or mobile phones from the valley that had remained silent until then. The French army had \\"founded the enemy\\" and it could now prepare for the offensive. After crossing the border between Niger and Mali at the beginning of the month, the GTIA 3 leaves Gao on February 20, and arrives in the Adrar of the Ifoghas two days later. 1800 French soldiers are present at Tessalit.Bernard Barrera, Op√©ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 151. =Fighting East of the Amettetai Valley, February 22= For their part, the Chadians were deployed east of the valley of Ametettai. A first column, left Tessalit and commanded by General D√©by, bypassed the Tigharghar from the north, accompanied by a detachment of French special forces. Coming from Kidal, the second column led by General Bikimo arrived from the south. The two forces make their junction east of the Adrar.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 422. The February 22, after a few days, Chadian troops reached the eastern entrance to the Amettetai valley. Unlike the French who had advanced cautiously in the Tibeggatine Valley, Chadians were attacking in force. Shortly after 11 am, they clash with jihadists. Clashes broke out on several points of the wadi, but the bloodiest fighting took place on a hill, north of the entrance to the valley. The Chadians were launching a real charge. Many fall under the fire of jihadists entrenched in the caves and behind the rocks. Despite the losses the soldiers are \\"euphoric\\" and \\"galvanized\\", one of them, the commander Moussa, will declare: \\"The terrorists faced us. They say they are crazy. We too wanted to be more crazy than them \\". The clashes were confusing, some soldiers chased after jihadists who retreated to a neighboring wadi, other Islamists ambushed the Chadians, by Chadians overtake them and then shoot them in the back. The fighters are too entangled and the French air force can not intervene. Chadians, however, form a line against the main Islamist position and deliver heavy fire with guns and machine guns. The jihadists repel the first assault but several others follow and the Chadians eventually reach the caves where the last insurgents deliver a desperate resistance. The fighters clash in hand-to-hand combat, a Chadian soldier declares: \\"In the caves, nothing was seen. We do not have lamps. We were shooting everywhere, hoping to kill them, then we went home. \\" Jihadists pretend to surrender before blowing themselves up, killing several soldiers. At the end of the day, the French air force drops two bombs and the fighting ends at dusk.At the end of the day, the French air force drops two bombs and the fighting ends at duskBernard Barrera, Op√©ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013,Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 442-446.Serge Daniel, Les mafias du Mali ; Trafics et terrorisme au Sahel, p. 129-133.Bernard Barrera, Op√©ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 170-172. The losses were very heavy. 26 Chadian soldiers were killed or fatally wounded, and according to sources about 70 were wounded. Commander Abdel Aziz Hassane Adam, leader of the special forces in Mali and number two of the Directorate of Reserved Actions (DAR), is among the dead. The only two doctors and nurses in the Chadian column were overwhelmed and the French had to send two Puma helicopters to evacuate the wounded by rotation to Tessalit's vital surgery module (MCV). The jihadists leave about 93 or 96 dead, about twenty prisoners and six vehicles destroyed according to the Chadian staff. For Jean-Christophe Notin, however, it is not impossible that the Chadians were able to exaggerate the losses of their opponents to compensate for theirs. In his war memos, General Barrera refers to a loss of dozens of men among jihadists. For its part, the group of Signatories by the blood is the only one among the jihadists to provide a balance sheet. On April 1, Moghrane, spokesman for the Katiba \\"Al-Muthalimin\\" challenged the figures of the Chadian staff and told the Nouakchott Agency of Information, \\"that during the offensive Tagharghart, where the Chadians had announced the death of 25 soldiers, only 5 mujahideen died. http://www.nord-mali.com =Fights in Puebla and Sontay, February 26= The Chadian column is victorious but has been severely affected by the fighting in eastern Amettetai, in addition to the casualties of many vehicles. No offensive was launched on February 23.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 447.Bernard Barrera, Op√©ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 172 On 24 February, Brigadier General Barrera left Gao and headed in Tessalit to conduct the next round of operations. The general of division Gregory de Saint-Quentin, chief of the operation Serval, entrusts to him the command of the terrestrial operations in the Adrar Tigharghar. The French army then planned its offensive, it plans to resume the attack on the west with the GTIA 3 and to surprise the jihadists by advancing the GTIA 4 north, on foot, through the mountainous terrain. According to General Barrera's war notes, the plan was partly inspired by the Battle of Dobro Pole and Operation Diadem. However, the French-Chadian forces were not numerous enough to cover the south. The zone of the south is then left to the surveillance of air forces. On the night of February 25 to 26, Operation Panther III begins. The GTIA 4 leaves Tessalit, more than 500 parachutists are loadeded on all available vehicles: VAB, GBC 180 trucks and even TRM 10000. The convoy was heading east for 80 kilometers. Around 3 pm, the parachutists were disembarked and deployed about ten kilometers north of the Ametettai. Colonel Desmeulles places the 1st RIMa tank platoon in the west, the 2nd company of the 2nd REP in the center and the company of the 1st RCP in the east. Two other companies of the 2nd REP are behind the leading units. For the parachutists, a long and trying walk begins, each soldier carries about 50 kilos of water, food and equipment in heat that can exceed 50 degrees. Every night, the troop must be refueled by helicopters, mainly in water. The first day, the progression is slower than expected, the GTIA 4 advance one kilometer and a half. For their part, armored GTIA 3 commanded by Colonel Gougeon set in motion at 3 am west of the Ametettai. Two Caesars from Gao also reach the entrance of the valley at dawn, just arrived they open fire to cover the advance of the column. After 5 kilometers of road, the GTIA 3 arrives at the scene of the fight of 19 February but no jihadist appears. The French continue their progression and reach the crests of Sontai and Puebla. This time the jihadists were present, dozens of fighters open fire, sometimes within 100 meters of the French. Some are ambushed at the top of the ridges, others on the counterpoise or in a green zone below, entrenched in huts or hidden in holesBernard Barrera, Op√©ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 180-181.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 452-457.Bernard Barrera, Op√©ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 177. About ten porpoises moved on a height and aviation intervenes according to their indications. Airplanes drops Mark 82 and GBU-12 bombs while mortars and Caesar shell Islamist positions. The AMX-10 RC tanks and the VABs also take position at the top of the counter-flank and are missed by five RPG-7 rockets. Meanwhile, a 2nd RIMa sniper kills a jihadist in motion at more than 1,000 meters. Exchanges of artillery and light weapon fire lasted several hours, but the French held the summit of the ridges and the attempts of the jihadists to circumvent them were repulsed. The fight ended at the end of the afternoon, when the Caesar and the mortars make a synchronized shot on two combat positions. Around 7 pm, the jihadists unhook and take away their dead, Sontay and Puebla are in the hands of the French. These consolidate their positions to spend the night. Their losses were three wounded, those of jihadists were estimated at fifteen killed. GTIA 3 resumes its course the next morning, but shortly after its departure a VBL jumps on an anti-tank mine and two soldiers, including a captain, were wounded. For their part, the Chadians have resumed their progress to the east but they also encounter mines that also wounded some of them. To the north, GTIA 4 continues to advance. In the afternoon, tanks and aviation opened fire on a battle station. While further east, the legionnaires collide with a first group of half a dozen fighters armed with machine guns and rocket launchers. The clash lasts about six hours and the planes intervene again. The next day, an armor BRDM-2 is destroyed by two Rafale.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 459-463Bernard Barrera, Op√©ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 192-194.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 464-466. =Bombings in In Sensa and death of Abu Zeid= On February 27, a concentration of jihadist vehicles with forty men is spotted by the French in the crossroads called the \\"Garage\\". Around 3 pm, their communications are intercepted, a leader expresses himself in Arabic and affirms to be Abu Zeid. At 17:30, the Mirage 2000 D intervene and drop three bombs \\"Airburst\\". Five minutes later, the Caesar cannon opened fire and dispatched 12 explosive rounds. Troops on the ground were not able to check the extent of the damage on the spot, but according to General Barrera, \\"the shows stop\\" and then some interceptions indicate a \\"very hard blow\\". After the strikes, the images filmed by the air force no longer detect any movement.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 466-469.Bernard Barrera, Op√©ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 196. But thereafter, different versions were given on the circumstances of the death of Abdelhamid Abu Zeid. On February 28, the Algerian television channel Ennahar is the first to announce the death of the AQIM leader. The channel claims that the latter was killed by French forces in the Adrar Tigharghar with about forty combatants, but sets the date of his death to Monday, February 25. The same day, Paris-Match reports that according to the MNLA and notables of the city of Kidal, 45 men of AQIM and Ansar Dine were killed on Saturday, February 23 by an air raid of the French army in the area. In Sensa, on the bases of Tinwel√®ne and Ticherfen. The MNLA also claims to have supported the French special forces and captured seven survivors - four from the region, an Algerian, a Mauritanian and a member of the Polisario - then handed over to the French. Another AQIM leader, Sedane Ag Hita, the commander of the katiba \\"Youssef Ibn Tachfin\\", fled to Aguel'hoc after escaping the bombings. He made contact with the MNLA present in the city and reported having defected from AQIM. He is said to have testified to the death of Abu Zeid and 43 of his men allegedly by him in the area of In Sensa and Etagh, near Tabankort on 23 February. For its part, the French newspaper Le Monde announces on March 1 that the death of Abu Zeid is confirmed by a \\"reliable source close to the ongoing military operations in northern Mali . \\" It would have occurred in the \\"very last days\\" in the Etagho area and 43 fighters of his katiba would have been killed with him. Colonel Thierry Burkhard, spokesman for the French armies, then said he had \\"no specific information on this person\\" but confirmed that a French air raid took place in the In Sensa area and destroyed six vehicles. In January 2014, in Kidal, AFP journalist Serge Daniel meets a young Touareg from Tessalit nicknamed \\"Tic - Tac\\", a battle survivor in Tigharghar. \\"Tic-Tac\\" claims to be non-Islamist and to have joined Ansar Dine out of admiration for his leader Iyad Ag Ghali . He gives more details about the death of Abu Zeid which he claims to have witnessed. According to him, the convoy of the fighters of AQIM and Ansar Dine was about sixty kilometers from Tessalit when it is attacked by French planes. Abu Zeid, driving the lead vehicle, is killed instantly by the first strike. Iyad Ag Ghali is then right behind him, driving the second vehicle of the convoy. Mad with rage, almost in a trance, he throws himself on the 14.5 mm machine gun stuck on his own pickup shouting \\" Allahu akbar \\". It is ultimately his own men who must force him out after seeing a second plane. Iyad Ag Ghali narrowly survives the bombing that follows, his vehicle is sprayed shortly after being abandoned. Hiding in the bushes with some of his relatives, he manages to win another pickup hidden behind tarpaulins, with which he finally manages to escape. According to journalist Serge Daniel, this \\"version of the facts corresponds to the information collected from military sources in the Sahel region\\". On March 1, Chadian President Idriss Deby gave a completely different version and declares that Abu Zeid was killed by his troops in the fight of February 22, east of the Ametettai: \\"On February 22 we lost our soldiers in the Ifoghas massif after destroying the base of the jihadists. This is the first time that there has been a face to face with the jihadists. Our soldiers shot down two jihadist leaders, including Abu Zeid, and freed Tessalit. \\" Then on Saturday, March 2, Chad claimed the death of Mokhtar Belmokhtar and said: \\"Chadian forces in Mali have totally destroyed the main base of jihadists in the Adrar mountains of Ifoghas, more precisely in the valley. Chad relied on prisoner testimonies, as well as on photographs taken by soldiers. However, on 4 March, the Mauritanian agency Sahara Media announces that according to the statements posted on the same day by an AQIM member, Abu Zeid was killed \\"by a French aerial bombardment in the mountains\\" and \\"not by the Chadians \\" The jihadist also denies the death of Mokhtar Belmokhtar and claims that the latter fights in the region of Gao and not in the Adrar of Ifoghas. The announcements of the Chadian government, especially that concerning Belmokhtar, were rechived with skepticism by the French. The clash took place about fifteen kilometers from the Garage and it appears that the Chadians have exaggerated their success because jihadists still largely held the valley of Ametteta√Ø. The staff then addresses Commander Jack, the leader of the French Special Forces detachment accompanying the Chadian column. He was present during the fight of February 22 but he himself learned the death of Abu Zeid only by the press. However, he obtained from Chadian soldiers photos of a corpse resembling the jihadist leader and the indication of the place where he was buried. On March 3 and 4, the special forces went on the spot by helicopter and collected fragments on the body which were then given to the DRS, the Algerian intelligence services, to be compared with members of his family.Serge Daniel, Les mafias du Mali ; Trafics et terrorisme au Sahel, p. 129-133 The DNA tests prove conclusive and on March 23 the French government officially confirms the death of Abu Zeid. On 1 April, following contact with the Nouakchott Information Agency, Belmokhtar's death is belied by Hamada Ould Mohamed Kheirou, head of MUJAO, and by Moghrane, spokesman for Katiba \\"Al- Mouthalimin \\"(the turbaned), Signatories by blood. However, on June 16, 2013, AQIM officially confirms the death of Abu Zeid. The exact circumstances of his death - Chadian bullets, French bombardment or suicide - remain however unknown. =Taking the Amettetai Valley, from February 28 to March 3= On February 28, GTIA 3 continued slowly west of Amettetai, uncovering several weapons stocks as deminers probe the terrain for mines and FDI. Meanwhile, in the north, two sections of the 2nd company of the 2nd REP, supported by a Tiger, attacked at 1 o'clock a group of jihadists entrenched on a height spotted the day before. The clash lasts five hours and ends with a grenade at the bottom of the caves. About 10 to 15 jihadists are killed, some are slaughtered within five meters by legionaries paratroopers. The French have only one injured, hit by a bullet in the helmet. To the east, Chadians still face mines and eight of their soldiers are wounded. A combat post is also destroyed by the air force on the same day and 15 jihadists spotted by a Harfang drone are eliminated by the strikes of a Mirage 2000D.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 471-473.Bernard Barrera, Op√©ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 197-201. On the 28th, the French army announces that it estimates that the fights delivered the previous days made about 130 dead among the Islamists. An official of the administration of Aguel'hoc, also says that a young boy from the city was surprised by the Islamists and executed for setting pointing devices for the French air strikes. The same day, a sub-group maintained in reserve in Tessalit leads the Septenk√©ro operation. An agreement had recently been reached in which Algeria undertook to supply the French army with fuel to confront AQIM. The French soldiers leave to meet the Algerian soldiers on the Bordj Badji Mokhtar border, in front of the Malian city of In Khalil, held by the MNLA . The reception is very cold, the Algerians show themselves with weapons, helmets and bulletproof vests and fly over the area by many helicopters. Four other Septenk√©ro operations will still be conducted between 8 and 25 March.Jean- Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 480-482. On the morning of March 1, the men of GTIA 4 reached northern Amettetai. The valley then undergoes its most massive bombardment since the beginning of the battle; shots of helicopters, mortars, more than 20 explosive shells shipped by Caesar and fourteen other smoke bombs to cover infantry advance. The 3rd company of the 2nd REP then crosses the valley to reach the southern heights, while the 2nd company remains on the northern heights. However, the forces deployed east and west were delayed by the mines and around noon General Barrera ordered the GTIA 3 and asked the Chadians to speed up the march so as not to leave the GTIA 4 isolated. In the west, GTIA 3 manages to cross the mined lock at the cost of one of its VABs, which is damaged by the explosion of a mine. The jihadists then begin to retreat, the leaders order their men to exfiltrate south to the Terz Valley and Tahor Pass. On the night of March 1 to 2, around 2 am, five pickups were spotted near Tahor. The Atlantic-2 cameras do not identify any hostages, the convoy is then rolled up by three Airburst bombs and twenty shells fired by the Caesar. After this carnage, the jihadist leaders ask their men to retreat on the back of dromedaries. On the evening of March 1, General Barrera goes to the GTIA 4 in the Amettetai, he then goes Tessalit aboard his Puma helicopter with the only prisoner made during the day, a Franco-Algerian jihadist named Djamel Ben Hamdi and nicknamed \\"Djamel the Grenoblois\\" Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 482-488.Bernard Barrera, Op√©ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 200-206Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 474. The next day, around 8 o'clock in the morning, the 2nd company of the 2nd REP attacks two mounds north of the valley, while the 3rd company attacks a rocky peak in the south, near the \\"camp of the sands\\" and the \\"camp of rocks \\", in the wadi that connects the valley of Ametteta√Ø to the valley of Integant. The north position is taken around 10 o'clock, and the southern position around 11 o'clock. On each of the two points, the assault gives rise to very close combats which end in caves. About twenty jihadists die into these two clashes. Further east, the 140 men of the 1st RCP attack around 9 am an ultimate rock lock held by a dozen fighters. The French are first targeted by snipers, the hunters replicate and some of them perform a bypass movement on the right. The air force and the Tigers intervene but without success, the thickness of the rocks protects the defenders from the bombs. Around 11 am, the hunters storm, but the jihadists repel them twice. Soldiers hurt themselves by spraining the rocks. Around 18 hours, a third assault fails and a French soldier is shot in the head. The shelling then resumes again. During the seven hours of the fighting, the piton is struck by six Milan missiles fired at AT4, two GBUs and six HOTs fired by two Gazelle helicopters and two Tigers who also empty their ammunition, but at nightfall the jihadists still hold the position.Bernard Barrera, Op√©ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 206-209. According to the French staff, the day's record is of more than fifteen \\"neutralized\\" Islamists, three destroyed pick-ups and three important caches of ammunition, equipment and several heavy weapons seized. A Chadian soldier is also killed.Fr√©d√©ric Gout, Lib√©rez Tombouctou ! Journal de guerre au Mali, p. 196. The next day at dawn, the 1st RCP is relieved by 25 men of the 2nd REP and elements of the 17th RGP . The hunters bypass the position and head east. The legionaries on their side launch the ultimate assault. They take the peak and kill the only jihadist they find, hidden in a cave. Nevertheless, traces of blood, clothing and ten Korans found on the spot suggest that other fighters have managed to escape, perhaps later dead or injured. On the morning of March 3, the 2nd company of the 2nd REP goes down from the northern heights and takes control of the small village of Ametettai. For its part the GTIA 3 destroys a pickup and captures a BM-21. Chadians are also advancing, but complain about four injuries due to FDI. Shortly after the three columns make their junction near the village. A group of jihadists open fire on the crowd at 300 meters but the French and Chadians immediately retaliate and kill four men. Some clashes still occur, especially near water points, but at the end of the day, the Ametettai Valley is considered taken. In the words of General Barrera : \\"the dungeon has fallen\\". The columns then restart. The Chadians go west to cross the valley to refuel, then join their bivouac in Aguel'hoc. For its part, the GTIA 3 turned around to go to search the area of the \\"Garage\\", there is no resistance but discovered a lot of weapons and equipment. Further south, towards the Terz Valley, a group of 14 insurgents on the run is spotted by the air force despite its attempt to conceal the vegetation. The group is annihilated by an air strike.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 488-491.Bernard Barrera, Op√©ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 210-214. On March 4, some jihadists went to the French in the Ametettai Valley and the Garage. Among them are three child soldiers and a Nigerian who admitted to being Boko Haram fighters. From February 28 to March 4, according to the French General Staff, a dozen pick-ups and a 122- mm gun were destroyed and a lot of equipment and ammunition captured; including a BM-21, three other 122mm guns, a towable 100mm gun, an 82mm mortar and a 60mm mortar, weapons, rockets and anti-personnel mines. In addition to a soldier killed on March 2, the French army has two casualty wounded in combat.Jean- Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 491-495. =Capturing the Sands, Rocks camp= After the capture of the Ametettai valley, the fighting decreased in intensity, the French and Chadians continued the excavations in the Adrar Tigharghar and punctually encountering a few scattered small groups. As of March 5, loudspeakers mounted on helicopters flying over the valleys of the Ametetta√Ø and Terz, called in Arabic and Tamashek the last defenders to surrender.Bernard Barrera, Op√©ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 217-220. On March 6, the 3 e company 2 e REP continued south to the \\"Rock camp\\". They meet a small group of four jihadists who are all killed after two hours of fighting and whose last man is shot to less than one meter. Already visited twice in February, the \\"camp of rocks\\" is again searched by the special forces the night of March 4 to 5, and that of 6 to 7. They remain there even the next day before retiring. Then, on the morning of March 8, 200 paratroopers took control. The resistance is weaker than expected, a French lieutenant is wounded, and six jihadists are killed. Corpses of fighters probably killed by mortar fire a few days earlier are also discovered. For its part, the GTIA 3 goes down the valley of Integant and advances towards the \\"camp of the sands\\". Along the way, three jihadists are targeted by the firing of a tank. Two are killed, the third, wounded, traps the bodies of his comrades with grenades before being surprised again and shot not far away. The sands camp is taken without the French suffering any casualty. The Panth√®re III operation ends then and on the evening of March 8 the GTIA 4 starts to be repatriated on Tessalit in vehicles or helicopters. This movement lasts until the morning of March 10.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 495-496.Bernard Barrera, Op√©ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 236-239. On March 7, Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian visits the French troops in Tessalit and in the Amettetai Valley. According to a statement from the Defense Ministry, he addresses the troops \\"a message of pride and encouragement for the mission they perform against terrorist groups that had made the massive Ifoghas their sanctuary\\". On that date, the French seized 1,000 rockets and grenades, 60,000 ammunition, and 1,500 shells and equipment for making homemade explosives.Bernard Barrera, Op√©ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 231-233.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 497-495.https://www.defense.gouv.fr/actualites/operations/serval- point-de-situation-du-lundi-04-mars-18h-au- jeudi-07-mars-18hhttps://www.defense.gouv.fr/actualites/articles/jean-yves-le- drian-est-arrive-au-mali =Operations in the Terz Valley of March 15 to 21= After taking the Ametetta√Ø Valley, the French army and Chadians planned a new operation in another valley, that of Terz further south. The operation for the valley of Terz is named Panther VI by the French. The maneuver is close to Panther III ; GTIA 3 is to enter the valley from the west, GTIA 4 to the north by Tahor Pass to the north and Chadians to the east to close the lock.Jean- Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 519.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 520.Bernard Barrera, Op√©ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 263-264. However, the climatic conditions and the nature of the terrain put the vehicles and equipment of the Chadian forces under severe strain. Many armored vehicles have broken down, half of the AMX-10 RC can no longer ride and 200 infantrymen have no more shoes. For three days, the mechanics repaired the two tank squadrons, sometimes \\"cannibalizing\\" other vehicles, while new pairs of shoes were collected and returned to French soldiers for two days.Bernard Barrera, Op√©ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 215.Bernard Barrera, Op√©ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 251-256.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 496-497. On March 11, Chadians leave Aguel'hoc accompanied by French mortar gunners. They bypass the Adrar Tigharghar from the south and recognize the Assamalmal Valley. A battle occurs around 15 hours after. In a statement, the Chadian staff says that they had dead and wounded and have six dead and five prisoners among jihadists. However, General Barrera does not mention in his war notes of killed on both sides during this conflict. Later, he even said that Chadian soldiers would have encountered a lone fighter. On the 13th, two Chadians wounded by bullets are evacuated by a Puma.Bernard Barrera, Op√©ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 250.Bernard Barrera, Op√©ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 252.Bernard Barrera, Op√©ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 303 On the 15th, the GTIA 3 and 4 of the French army leave Tessalit while the Chadians leave the valley of Assamalmal, to take position east of the valley of Terz. The next day, the French enter the valley. The paratroopers do not encounter any resistance on the heights of Tahor, some empty pickups are bombarded by the air force and quickly the soldiers discover arms depots and food in shooting positions. The armor of the GTIA 4 is first preceded by sappers, but the column is late and must accelerate. Around 16 pm, a tank AMX 10 RC the 1 st RIMa hit a mine, three crew members were seriously burned and the driver is killed.Bernard Barrera, Op√©ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 272-278.https://www.defense.gouv.fr/operations/actualites/serval- point-de-situation-sur-les-operations-du-lundi-18-marsJean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 520-522. The next day the GTIA 3 gives up passing through the west entrance, considered too narrow and too risky, it bypasses the north to take the path taken by the GTIA 4, now secure. But while the French and Chadians expected to find strong resistance, it turns out that Terz was recently abandoned by jihadists. The valley is searched, a pickup containing a large stock of ammunition and shells is destroyed by the engineers. A 14.5 mm machine gun, an anti-tank gun SPG-9, mortars and a missile 107 107 type firing station are also found in a cache. On March 20, the French and Chadian make their junction and Operation Panther VI ends the next day.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 522-524.Bernard Barrera, Op√©ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 279-295.https://www.defense.gouv.fr/actualites/operations/operation-serval- point-de-situation-du-jeudi-21-mars =Operations in Adrar Tigharghar, from March 21 to 31= On March 21, the French and Chadian forces moved south of the Adrar Tigharghar to the area known as \\"Jason\\", where there is an oasis called the \\"Garden\\", caves and the circus of Assamalmal - or Tigharghar - a natural amphitheater of 15 km in diameter in the middle of which is a mineral desert. On March 23, GCPare dropped at night by helicopter near the Garden, but the area turned out to be empty. The Chadians approached the circus but they did not find any passage that would allow vehicles to access the interior, the staff deduced that no material could be conveyed by the jihadists. There is nothing either on the side of the parachute dragons who search the Adrar Dourit from March 23 to 30. On March 23, the Chadians return to Aguel'hoc and the GTIA 4 does the same to Tessalit. The GTIA 3 returns in turn on March 25. From 21 to 25 March, 122 and 120 mm shells, four boxes of PG9 rockets, 60 mm mortarsand some mines were seized.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 524-529.https://www.defense.gouv.fr/operations/operations/autres- operations/operations-achevees/operation-serval-2013-2014/actualite/operation- serval-point-de-situation-du-lundi-25-marsBernard Barrera, Op√©ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 297-307. On March 26, a company of the 2ond REP and another from the 1st RCP leads Operation Tigris in the town of Tessalit to search the city and to ensure the absence of any jihadi presence. There are no arrests or seized material.http://www.defense.gouv.fr/operations/actualites/operation-serval- point-de-situation-du-29-mars-2013 On the 27th, GTIA 3 comes out again from Tessalit. One of its subgroups led the operation Panth√®re VIII, that went to recognize the valley of Assamalmal south of Adrar Tigharghar, then again the \\"Garden\\". A printing press is discovered during the excavations, as well as some stocks of weapons. The other sub-group, commanded by Colonel Gougeon, is leading the Renard operation with the Chadians. He go to Boghassa, then Abeibara. In the latter city, a Togolese jihadist is arrested. Generals Barrera and Bikimoand Colonel Gougeon then meet the notables and residents indicate the location of depots of weapons, medical equipment and ammunition. These transactions end on March 31.Bernard Barrera, Op√©ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 325-329.https://www.defense.gouv.fr/operations/mali/actualite/operation- serval-point-de-situation-du-jeudi-4-avril-2013 The Adrar Tigharghar is now considered empty and French troops begin to be disengaged. GTIA 3 returns to Kidal and on April 2 it is in Gao. In early April the GTIA can repatriate and two of its SGTIA Abidjan, return to France after ten days in the Ivorian capital. On 5 April, Chadian forces return to Kidal. On 9 April, the French garrison of Tessalit rose in ten days from 2.000 to 400 men. In May, all the GTIAs engaged in Operation Serval were relieved and returned to France after a stopover in Paphos, on the island of Cyprus, to decompress at the request of General Barrera. Chadians, on the other hand, remain deployed much longer in the Kidal region; in September 160 soldiers of the Tessalit garrison desert the Amachach military camp after having complained of not having been relieved after nine months of mission in the great north of Mali.Bernard Barrera, Op√©ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 340.Bernard Barrera, Op√©ration Serval : Notes de guerre, Mali 2013, p. 358.Jean-Christophe Notin, La guerre de la France au Mali, p. 562. Aftermath The Battle of Ifoghas completes the reconquest phase of northern Mali. After this defeat, the jihadists sought to blend in with the population and avoided clashes. In Terz Valley, even the French were discovering the cut beards the jihadists left. Salafist rebels now had gone underground. The jihadists left hundreds of dead in the first months of Operation Serval, and according to General Barrera, after their defeat in the Tighargh√¢r;\\"They are no longer able to occupy the field, nor numerous enough to fight a classic battle. It only remains small terrorist groups conducting asymmetric warfare and avoid contact \\". The jihadists then change their tactics and go to guerrilla warfare ; they carry out suicide attacks, ambush, fire rockets at military barracks, lay mines and IEDs on the roads, and kill supporters of the Malian government or the Tuareg rebellion. On 25 April, AQIM calls for jihad against France in a speech delivered by Abu Obeida Youssef al-Annabi. Iyad Ag Ghali reappears in turn on July 29, 2014 in a video and affirms his will to continue to fight the \\"crusaders, with France in the lead\\". On April 16, a pickup group spotted northwest of Tessalit was destroyed by French aviation. Several jihadists were killed but Senda Ould Boumama, spokesman of Ansar Dine, escaped the strikes when he was directly targeted. Traumatized by the bombing, he traveled several tens of kilometers in the desert to go to Algerians Bordj Badji Mokhtar.

Signs and symptoms As a syndrome, this condition is poorly defined. Diagnostic criteria require one or more antisynthetase antibodies (which target tRNA synthetase enzymes), and one or more of the following three clinical features: interstitial lung disease, inflammatory myopathy, and inflammatory polyarthritis affecting small joints symmetrically. Other supporting features may include fever, Raynaud's phenomenon and \\"mechanics hands\\"-thick, cracked skin usually on the palms and radial surfaces of the digits.A man with fevers, arthrhalgias, and pulmonary infiltrates, L Christopher-Stine et al. NEJM 367: 2134-2147. The disease, rare as it is, is more prevalent in women than in men. Early diagnosis is difficult, and milder cases may not be detected. Also, interstitial lung disease may be the only manifestation of the disease. Severe disease may develop over time, with intermittent relapses. Pathogenesis It is postulated that autoantibodies are formed against aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. The synthethases may be involved in recruiting antigen-presenting and inflammatory cells to the site of muscle or lung injury. The specific molecular pathway of the process awaits elucidation. =Antisynthetase antibodies= The most common antibody is \\"Anti-Jo-1\\" named after John P, a patient with polymyositis and interstitial lung disease detected in 1980. This anti-histidyl tRNA Synthetase antibody is commonly seen in patients with pulmonary manifestations of the syndrome. The following are other possible antibodies that may be seen in association with antisynthetase syndrome: Anti- PL-7, Anti-PL-12, Anti-EJ, Anti-OJ, Anti-KS, Anti-Zo, Anti-Ha-YRS, and Anti- SRP.Lazarou IN, Guerne PA. Classification, diagnosis, and management of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. J Rheumatol. 2013 May;40(5):550-64 Diagnosis In the presence of suspicious symptoms a number of test are helpful in the diagnosis: * Muscle enzymes are often elevated, i.e. creatine kinase * Anti-Jo-1 antibody testing * Electromyography * Muscle biopsy * Pulmonary function testing * Lung biopsy * Imaging such as High Resolution computed tomography ANTISYNTHETASE SYNDROME AND ITS ASSOCIATION WITH INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE-A CLINICAL AND RADIOLOGICAL REVIEW Naresh Kumar,Bhavya Basetti, Rajoo Ramachandran, Prabhu Radhan,Venkata Sai P.M. http://ijomcr.net/radiology/ In certain situations, testing of other antibodies, specific imaging (MRI, thoracic high resolution computed tomography), and swallowing evaluation may be needed. Treatment  Unfortunately, treatment for the anti-synthetase syndrome is limited, and usually involves immunosuppressive drugs such as glucocorticoids. For patients with pulmonary involvement, the most serious complication of this syndrome is pulmonary fibrosis and subsequent pulmonary hypertension. Additional treatment with azathioprine and/or methotrexate may be required in advanced cases. Prognosis Prognosis is largely determined by the extent of pulmonary damage.

The mountain is high. The mountain is locally known as Mount Baldy. History Several people in the area around the mountain, including some scientists, believe that Big Baldy Mountain including nearby mountain ranges were formed from magma that never made it to the earth's surface several thousands of years ago. Even though evidence is slim at the summit of Big Baldy itself, satellite views of the mountain show noticeable craters and features that indicate possible volcanic activity. Many features such as craters, lakes at the summit of the mountain, and stains that look like an old lava trail or spill make the mountain look as if it were a volcano many years ago. It is believed that when the Rocky Mountains were forming from plate tectonics, the Little Belt Mountains underwent a period of being subjected to magma moving close to the surface in which created several intrusions on the surface. A theory suggests that a bulge of volcanic magma and gases began to raise the surface that is now Big Baldy Mountain. The magma never exactly reached the surface, but some volcanic gases did, which created the sunken craters on the mountain after the magma disappeared from below the surface. The bulge remained, creating Big Baldy Mountain, and due to the way it was created, no vegetation is present on the top of the mountain; which is possibly where the name of the mountain came from.

Historically women have played a major role on the home front. By the 18th century, some women accompanied armies assigned combat missions, usually handling roles such as cooking and laundry. They sewed bandages, rubbed cow pat as 'medicine' and other medical equipment for the soldiers. Women worked in munitions factories. Nursing became a major role starting in the middle 19th century. The main role in World War I (1914-1918) was employment in munitions factories, farming, and other roles to replace men drafted for the army. Women played an important role in making the system of food rationing work. World War II (1939-1945) marked a decisive turning point, with millions of women handling important homefront roles, such as working in munitions factories and otherwise replacing drafted men. Volunteer roles expanded. The most romantic new change was millions of women in regular military units. Typically they handled clerical roles so that men could be released for combat. Some women (especially in the Soviet Union, Germany, and Britain) were assigned limited combat roles, especially in anti-aircraft units, where they shot down enemy bombers while at the same time being safe from capture. Underground and resistance movements made extensive use of women in support roles. Reaction set in after 1945, and the roles allowed to women was sharply reduced in all major armies. Restarting in the 1970s, women played an increasing role in the military of major nations, including by 2005 roles as combat pilots. The new combat roles were highly controversial for many reasons including differences in physical capabilities of the sexes and issues of gender identity for both women and men.Barton C.

In July 1917 the seagoing yacht was ordered taken by the U.S. Navy for service in international waters, but the yacht was never acquired and instead remained in private hands. It was the second of two yachts named Oneida by owner Elias Cornelius Benedict, a prominent New York City banker and one of the world's leading yachtsman. In 1922, after Benedict's death, the Oneida was purchased by publisher William Randolph Hearst. In November 1924 the yacht was associated with the mysterious death of American film producer Thomas H. Ince, a scandal that became part of early Hollywood lore. The Oneida was sold by Hearst sometime after 1927. In 1932 the yacht was in use as a ferry vessel on Lake Champlain, based at Burlington, Vermont. In 1940, the rusty hull of the Oneida was purchased as scrap by Canada, for conversion into munitions for World War II. Design and construction Designed by Albert S. Cheseborough, the Oneida was a 552 gross ton steam yacht built in 1897 by the Harlan and Hollingsworth Company of Wilmington, Delaware. The yacht measured 200 feet overall, with a breadth of 24 feet and a draught of 11.5 feet.Summers, Capt. James C., \\"Com. E. C.

Benedict (1834‚Äì1920) aboard the Oneida, soon after purchasing the yacht in March 1913 The yacht was originally owned by George William Childs Drexel (1868‚Äì1944), son of Anthony Joseph Drexel, and named the Alcedo. It was sold to John Hays Hammond, who renamed it the Atreus, in 1912. In March 1913 Hammond sold the yacht to Commodore E. C. Benedict for a reported $100,000.\\"Benedict Buys Yacht\\". The New York Times, March 23, 1913 \\"Benedict has decided to re-christen the yacht Oneida, which is the name of a smaller yacht which he also possesses,\\" reported The New York Times. \\"He will rename the latter.\\" The old Oneida was renamed Adelante and converted into a tow vessel, and the new Oneida became a fixture in the yachting centers of the East Coast. On April 24, 1913, Benedict set out on his fourth South American trip in his new Oneida, to see the Panama Canal before it was opened and to sail through the new waterway. An avid yachtsman and fisherman, Benedict took many extended ocean trips in the company of many friends and distinguished guests.\\"Old Benedict Yacht Sold.\\" The New York Times, August 4, 1922 In July 1917 the Oneida was ordered taken by the U.S. Navy for service during World War I, and the yacht was given the identification number SP-432. In September 1917 the orders were cancelled, and the Oneida continued to remain in Benedict's possession. Within the year the yacht was equipped with oil-burning boilers that increased her cruising radius to 4,000 miles.\\"Yacht Oneida Sold\\". The Rudder, Volume 38, No. 9, page 50 The yacht was reconstructed and overhauled in 1920, when its length was increased and state-of-the art equipment and luxurious fittings were installed.The Boston Sunday Globe, August 6, 1922, page 5 In August 1922 the Oneida was purchased from Benedict's estate by publisher William Randolph Hearst, owner of the International Film Service Company of New York, for use by the film studio. Extensive improvements were made under the direction of Cox and Stevens, and the yacht cruised to the Pacific Coast that winter. On November 19, 1924, American film pioneer Thomas H. Ince died under suspicious circumstances after being a weekend guest on Hearst's yacht. The mystery surrounding his death became an enduring scandal in Hollywood lore. The Oneida was still in Hearst's hands in 1927,\\"Chaplin Refuses Comment; Hearst's Guest on Yacht. He Won't Discuss Divorce Charges.\\" The New York Times, July 3, 1927 but by 1932 the yacht was in use as a ferry vessel on Lake Champlain. The author of a \\"Talk of the Town\\" feature in the October 15, 1932, issue of The New Yorker magazine recognized the Oneida after driving aboard for the crossing from Port Douglas to Burlington, Vermont, and disclosed the yacht's fate: > The ferry company, it came out, had got her at a bargain, taken her through > the St. Lawrence and the Richelieu Canal, remodelled her, and put her to > work.

Clement is the adopted son of Geoffrey Wedderburn, a banker, who wants him to marry his niece, Minnie. Minnie has another suitor, Horace, an American. Mrs. Rolt discovers that Wedderburn is not only Clement's adoptive father but also Lavender's real father. She is very angry and breaks off the relationship between Clement and Lavender. Wedderburn's bank is threatened with failure; he takes ill and learns humility. Mrs. Rolt forgives and nurses him, while Lavender flies back into Clement's arms to console him after the financial ruin. Phenyl unexpectedly offers his own fortune to save the bank and Wedderburn's reputation, and all ends happily.

Since Williamsons had not produced an Australian play in over 20 years this was seen as a positive step for Australian playwriting. The play made its professional debut on 15 March 1944 at the Theatre Royal in Sydney and was positively received.

Naturally, the professional production will be a more elaborate one particularly in the last act, which requires sliding panels and secret passages.‚Äù The play was published in 1944. 1945 Broadway production The play was also optioned for production on Broadway, although it was rewritten by Alexander Kirkland to be set in Australia and be about a Japanese spy ring.

Lux Feininger (June 11, 1910 Berlin, Germany ‚Äì July 7, 2011 Cambridge, Massachusetts) was a German-American painter, avant-garde photographer, author, and art teacher who was born in Berlin to Julia Berg and Lyonel Feininger, an American living in Germany from the age of sixteen. His father was appointed as the Master of the Printing Workingshop at the newly formed Bauhaus art school in Weimar by Walter Gropius in 1919.Bauhaus100. Lyonel Feininger (Accessed: 3 February 2017 He had two older full brothers, including Andreas Feininger, and two half sisters, even older, by Clara F√ºrst and his father (from his first marriage). Early career begins with photography At sixteen, Lux Feininger became a student at the Bauhaus at Dessau, where he studied painting with Josef Albers, Paul Klee, and Wassily Kandinsky, played in the Bauhauskapelle, the Bauhaus jazz band,Bauhaus100. Members of the Bauhaus Band (Accessed: 10 February 2017) and participated in experimental theater. It was here that he began taking photographs and assumed the role of an artistic photojournalist chronicling the daily life at Bauhaus. Although no photographic studio was part of the Bauhaus until 1929, his photography was influenced by the aesthetic of L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy, who lived adjacent to the Feininger family. Soon Feininger was selling his photographs to periodicals and newspapers through an agency. By 1929 his work was featured in Film und Foto, a survey of modern photography. A retrospective of his early photography was held in 1962 at the Busch-Reisinger Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts and in 2001, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in Manhattan, showed his works at an exhibit entitled, Dancing on the Roof: Photography and the Bauhaus (1923-1929).R√∂seler, Clemens, T. Lux Feininger (American (born Germany), Berlin 1910‚Äì2011 Cambridge, Massachusetts), Collections, The Metropolitan Museum of Art Painting career begins in 1929 In 1929 he also began to exhibit his paintings under a pseudonym, Theodore Lux, by which his stated intention was to avoid preferential treatment arising from the fame of his father. These are his first and second given names without his family name, he had never used his first name prior to this time. His initial paintings included maritime subjects, frequently of old sailing ships. From 1930 to 1935 he spent time in Paris. In 1936 Feininger left Germany and settled in the United States. His family had been targeted by the Nazis as undesirable foreigners participating in \\"decadent\\" cultural activities and they, along with many Bauhaus artists and designers, emigrated. The majority of the negatives for his collection of photographs had been left behind during his departure from Germany and none of these have been recovered. In 1937 he had his first solo show of paintings in Manhattan. Transportation subjects such as train locomotives, as well as, toys were featured in his paintings along with what the New York Times described as, striking self-portraits. After the United States entered World War II, Feininger served in its army intelligence. In 1947 he ceased using the pseudonym to sign his paintings and began using his family name in his signature. During the 1940s he continued his photography as a personal activity only, focusing upon transportation subjects that included ferries, ships, trains, and trucks as well as street scenes in Manhattan. He never exhibited this later photography, however, and completely abandoned the art in 1950s. During the 1950s Feininger painted a mural in the home of John M. van Beuren that was being built near Morristown, New Jersey by architect, Bertrand Goldberg. A personal friend of Feininger, van Beuren was the brother of Michael van Beuren,Feiniger, Lyonel, Photograph of Lux Feininger and Michael van Beuren in Siemensstadt, 1935 Busch-Reisinger Museum, Division of Modern and Contemporary Art a Bauhaus furniture designer who hosted Gropius and other Bauhaus staff and faculty members fleeing the Nazis, at a van Beuren family residence in M√©xico while they relocated and selected destinations in the Americas for refuge.Hernandez, Daniel, Footprints of the Bauhaus in Mexico: Exploring the legacy of Michael van Beuren, Los Angeles Times, July 13, 2010Abren la exposici√≥n \\"Huellas de la Bauhaus.

By the 1960s Feininger had adopted the semi-abstract prismatic painting style of his father and Kandinsky. He continued to paint for the remainder of his life. A joint exhibition of Feininger's paintings was held in 2010 at the Berlin and the Manhattan galleries of Moeller Fine Art.

Presson has collaborated with the film collective of Gonzoriffic based in the Atlanta Georgia area in many films, as well as co-created Niha pictures with fellow Gonzoriffic alumni Kert Rats. Early years Presson spent most of her youth active in theater, acting in many plays and competed in regional and state competitions in the State of Georgia both for acting and singing. She was awarded the prestigious National School Choral Award in 1997 and 1998 and was invited to perform with other award-winning junior level singers at the University of Georgia during her high school years. She was a member of the Classic City Singers (2002-2004), a collective of classically trained singers which performed free shows throughout the greater Atlanta area. Presson became involved in the alternative rock scene in her late teens and was in the band Scratch for over a decade (1998-2009) Acting Presson was a theater actress beginning at the age of 15, playing roles in A Midsummer Night's Dream, the 1940's Radio Hour, You Can't Take It with You, Harvey (play), Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (play), and Oliver!. Through Priscilla's musical background she and film director Andrew N. Shearer (co-founder of Gonzoriffic film collective) were first made aware of one another. Through this meeting her cult film career began with a small role in the film Fake Blood, and other roles began to be written for her to play. She is a character and method actor which has led her to becoming a seasoned comedian. Presson has said that her goal as an actress is to spread a positive message to plus sized women, stating \\"women of all shapes and sizes are beautiful and sexy, regardless of what conventional standards tell them.\\" Presson aspires to be a positive role model for girls and women of all shapes and sizes. After becoming established as a standard player in the Gonzoriffic Collective, Presson set out with fellow Gonzoriffic alumni and childhood friend Kert Rats creating Niha Pictures. Presson and Rats co-write, produce, film, and direct all their no- budget films. Together they have written, filmed, and produced films including Legend of the Sineater, Tooth Fairy Assassin, and The Univited. Priscilla is fiercely loyal and protective of her art, which has had its consequences over the years at one point costing her her career in law enforcement. However Presson has no regrets, stating \\"My art is my life, so if they don't get it, screw 'em\\" Presson continues to act, write, and film while living a relatively quiet lifestyle. She still occasionally records music with one of the other founding members of Scratch as well as other local musicians, and will perform publicly from time to time to raise money and awareness for causes she believes in. (Such as AIDS Athens, Human Rights, the LBGTQ community's rights and awareness, Women's' Rights and awareness, Ending Childhood violence, etc...)

According to the band, they at times tried to replicate strange noises made inside the ship. Stated Tong, \\"You could hear other boats passing by up the Thames. You could hear the propeller noises.

On its cover is a relatively famous photo of Janet Hodgson flying across her bedroom, supposedly by a poltergeist.

A review by Pitchfork was mixed. According to James Monger of Allmusic, \\"The group takes traditional folk music and then filters it through the swirling psych rock of Piper at the Gates of Dawn-era Pink Floyd, the electro-freak folk of Animal Collective, and the pastoral creep of bands Espers and Vetiver, resulting in a wild pastiche of digital trickery and oral tradition that channels the spirit of '70s progressive rock while staying true to pop-song brevity.\\" In her review for This is Fake DIY, Mary Chang wrote, \\"While Erland & The Carnival have moved on quickly to a newer sound for Nightingale, the overall effect is mostly successful. With this album they‚Äôve proven their worth in instrumental experimentation; with original ideas in the lyric department merged with such imagination, the possibilities for this band are endless.\\" According to Dusted Magazine, \\"Clearly steeped in the great tradition of the British folk song, yet able to combine its structure and ethos with rock rebellion from both classic psych and more recent guitar rock, Erland & The Carnival‚Äôs Nightingale is a distinctive exemplar of folk revivalism for the age of indie.\\"  Track listing ReferencesExternal links *Erland and the Carnival Category:Erland and the Carnival albums Category:2011 albums Category:Full Time Hobby albums ","title":"Nightingale (Erland and the Carnival album)"},{"id":"38184312","title":"1826 Pennsylvania's 13th congressional district special election"},{"id":"38184315","text":"Sir Edmund Wickham Lawrence (born 14 February 1932) was the Governor-General of St. Kitts and Nevis from 2013 to 2015.

Background  It is not known when or where Pan Qiao was born. It was said that his ancestors were originally from the Hexi region.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms (ÂçÅÂúãÊò•Áßã), vol. 41.  During Former Shu  It is also not known when Pan Qiao initially came to serve under Wang Jian (while Wang Jian was still a Tang Dynasty warlord), but it is known that after Wang Jian declared himself emperor of a new state of Former Shu, he initially made Pan a director of palace affairs (ÂÆ£ÂæΩ‰Ωø, Xuanhuishi). In 911, Wang Jian made Pan's older brother Pan Kang, who was then the director of palace communications, the military governor of Wutai Circuit (Ê≠¶Ê≥∞, headquartered in modern Chongqing), while making Pan Qiao the new director of palace communications.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 268. By 913, an intense rivalry between Wang Jian's son and crown prince Wang Yuanying and Wang Jian's close associate Tang Daoxi flared up on the eve of the Qixi Festival, when Wang Yuanying held a feast for the high-level officials. However, Wang Jian's adoptive son Wang Zonghan (ÁéãÂÆóÁø∞) the Prince of Ji, as well as Pan Qiao and the chief imperial scholar Mao Wenxi did not attend. Wang Yuanying became angry, believing that Pan Qiao and Mao must have alienated Wang Zonghan from him. The next day, he accused to Wang Jian that Pan Qiao and Mao were alienating him and his brothers, and Wang Jian initially believed so, ordering Pan Qiao and Mao demoted while making Pan Kang the director of palace communications again. However, Tang later accused Wang Yuanying of plotting treason. Tang's accusations eventually led to a battle between imperial guards under him and the guards under Wang Yuanying's command. During the battle, Wang Yuanying arrested Pan Qiao and Mao and nearly battered them to death, while Tang was killed in battle. However, after Wang Jian (at Pan Kang's urging) personally met the senior generals to encourage them, Wang Yuanying's army collapsed, and Wang Yuanying was killed by a soldier. After Wang Yuanying's death, Pan Qiao was again made director of palace communications. In 914, Pan Qiao was made the military governor of Wutai Circuit and given the honorary chancellor designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 269. That was the last historical reference to him, and it was said that he died after a long while due to illness, implying that he died while still serving as the military governor of Wutai.

History In July 1984, Comeng were awarded a contract to build 76 3100/3200 class electric locomotives with Hitachi supplying the electrical equipment. These were ordered to operate coal trains on the Blackwater and Goonyella railway lines that were in the process of being electrified. A further ten were later ordered. Design of the electrical equipment was by General Electric and Hitachi, with the bodies being built and assembled at Comeng's Rocklea factory.Comeng/Hitachi 3100/3200 Class Queensland's Railways Interests Group The first locomotive, 3101 Sir Joh Bjelke-Peterson, was delivered on 26 May 1986. All were fitted with Locotrol systems that allowed remote control locomotives in the centre of a train to be controlled from a command unit.

Deemed a success, it was decided to rebuild 60 more at United Group's Townsville and Broadmeadow factories.3700 Class Railpage The weight and dimensions of the 3100 class meant that they had to have components removed at the Jilalan Depot, Mackay before they could be moved by rail to Townsville. These components were used both for spare parts for the rest of the 3100/3200 class and to allow a reduction in weight to comply with mainline track restrictions. At Townsville the locomotives were stripped down to the body shell with all internal components removed. The bodies were then sandblasted and any minor defects were repaired. They were rebuilt with only one cab, with the redundant cab enclosed with steel plating. Bodies were then transported by road to Broadmeadow for rebuilding. There are several major changes to the locomotives. These include now using AC traction motors, distributed power locotrol system instead of Locotrol II, increased weight and increased traction effort. With the increased tractive effort, the number of locomotives on each train has decreased from five to three locomotives on the Goonyella network.

He was known as a controversialist. As a churchman he exemplified the high-and-dry tradition. Life He was the son of Henry Godfrey Faussett of Kent (son of Bryan Faussett) and Susan Sandys. He graduated B.A. at Corpus Christi College, Oxford in 1801, and M.A. in 1804 as a Fellow of Magdalen College. He became B.D. in 1822 and D.D. in 1827, the year in which he was elected Lady Margaret Professor. Faussett was Bampton Lecturer, publishing The Claims of the Established Church to exclusive attachment and support, and the Dangers which menace her from Schism and Indifference, considered (1820). He took the conservative side of the religious issues in the university, opposing the 1834 bill of George William Wood to allow dissenters to enter (on a committee with Edward Burton, John Henry Newman, Edward Pusey and William Sewell), and defending subscription to the Thirty Nine Articles in 1835 with Vaughan Thomas and Newman. Faussett's 1838 sermon The Revival of Popery was provoked by the Tractarian publication of the Remains of Hurrell Froude, who had died in 1836; in it Faussett denounced Newman and John Keble. It echoed an 1831 sermon of Burton preached against Henry Bellenden Bulteel. It also proved a turning point as far as traditional High Church support for the Oxford Movement went within the university, since Faussett's alienation reflected the views of others in the camp. Newman replied in a \\"Letter to Faussett\\" in June of that year, significant in its abandonment of his previous views on the Antichrist. In 1843 Faussett complained to the vice-chancellor Philip Wynter about a sermon by Pusey. The outcome was that Pusey was banned from preaching for two years. Works In 1830, Faussett attacked Henry Hart Milman's History of the Jews (1829) in a sermon Jewish History Vindicated from the Unscriptural View of it Displayed in the History of the Jews. The Alliance of Church and State Explained and Vindicated (1834) protested against the power of non-Anglicans to legislate for the Church of England. Family Faussett married first Marianne-Elizabeth Bridges of Thanet; they had two sons and two daughters. Thomas Godfrey Faussett was his son by his second wife Sarah Wethered of Great Marlow.

The strong interaction is one of the fundamental interactions of nature, and the quantum field theory (QFT) to describe it is called quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Quarks interact with each other by the strong force due to their color charge, mediated by gluons. Gluons themselves possess color charge and can mutually interact. The gluon field strength tensor is a rank 2 tensor field on the spacetime with values in the adjoint bundle of the chromodynamical SU(3) gauge group (see vector bundle for necessary definitions). Convention Throughout this article, Latin indices (typically ) take values 1, 2, ..., 8 for the eight gluon color charges, while Greek indices (typically ) take values 0 for timelike components and 1, 2, 3 for spacelike components of four- vectors and four-dimensional spacetime tensors. In all equations, the summation convention is used on all color and tensor indices, unless the text explicitly states that there is no sum to be taken (e.g. ‚Äúno sum‚Äù).

Miake and Greiner, Sch√§fer. =Tensor components= The tensor is denoted , (or , , or some variant), and has components defined proportional to the commutator of the quark covariant derivative : : G_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} = \\\\pm \\\\frac{1}{i g_s} [D_\\\\alpha, D_\\\\beta]\\\\,, where: :D_\\\\mu =\\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\pm ig_s t_a \\\\mathcal{A}^a_\\\\mu\\\\,, in which * is the imaginary unit; * is the coupling constant of the strong force; * are the Gell-Mann matrices divided by 2; * is a color index in the adjoint representation of SU(3) which take values 1, 2, ..., 8 for the eight generators of the group, namely the Gell-Mann matrices; * is a spacetime index, 0 for timelike components and 1, 2, 3 for spacelike components; *\\\\mathcal{A}_\\\\mu = t_a \\\\mathcal{A}^a_\\\\mu expresses the gluon field, a spin-1 gauge field or, in differential-geometric parlance, a connection in the SU(3) principal bundle; * \\\\mathcal{A}_\\\\mu are its four (coordinate-system dependent) components, that in a fixed gauge are traceless Hermitian matrix-valued functions, while \\\\mathcal{A}^a_\\\\mu are 32 real-valued functions, the four components for each of the eight four-vector fields. Different authors choose different signs. Expanding the commutator gives; :G_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} =\\\\partial_{\\\\alpha}\\\\mathcal{A}_\\\\beta-\\\\partial_\\\\beta\\\\mathcal{A}_\\\\alpha \\\\pm ig_s[\\\\mathcal{A}_{\\\\alpha}, \\\\mathcal{A}_{\\\\beta}] Substituting t_a \\\\mathcal{A}^a_\\\\alpha = \\\\mathcal{A}_{\\\\alpha} and using the commutation relation [t_a, t_b ] = i f_{ab}{}^{c} t_c for the Gell-Mann matrices (with a relabeling of indices), in which are the structure constants of SU(3), each of the gluon field strength components can be expressed as a linear combination of the Gell-Mann matrices as follows: :\\\\begin{align} G_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} & = \\\\partial_\\\\alpha t_a \\\\mathcal{A}^a_{\\\\beta} - \\\\partial_\\\\beta t_a \\\\mathcal{A}^a_\\\\alpha \\\\pm i g_s \\\\left[t_b ,t_c \\\\right ] \\\\mathcal{A}^b_\\\\alpha \\\\mathcal{A}^c_\\\\beta \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = t_a \\\\left( \\\\partial_\\\\alpha \\\\mathcal{A}^a_{\\\\beta} - \\\\partial_\\\\beta \\\\mathcal{A}^a_\\\\alpha \\\\pm i^2 f_{bc}{}^ag_s \\\\mathcal{A}^b_\\\\alpha \\\\mathcal{A}^c_\\\\beta \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = t_a G^a_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align}\\\\,, so that: :G^a_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} = \\\\partial_\\\\alpha \\\\mathcal{A}^a_{\\\\beta} - \\\\partial_\\\\beta \\\\mathcal{A}^a_\\\\alpha \\\\mp g_s f^{a}{}_{bc} \\\\mathcal{A}^b_\\\\alpha \\\\mathcal{A}^c_\\\\beta \\\\,, where again are color indices. As with the gluon field, in a specific coordinate system and fixed gauge are traceless Hermitian matrix-valued functions, while are real-valued functions, the components of eight four-dimensional second order tensor fields. =Differential forms= The gluon color field can be described using the language of differential forms, specifically as an adjoint bundle-valued curvature 2-form (note that fibers of the adjoint bundle are the su(3) Lie algebra); :\\\\mathbf{G} =\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mathcal{A}} \\\\mp g_s\\\\,\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mathcal{A}}\\\\wedge \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mathcal{A}}\\\\,, where \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mathcal{A}} is the gluon field, a vector potential 1-form corresponding to and is the (antisymmetric) wedge product of this algebra, producing the structure constants . The Cartan- derivative of the field form (i.e. essentially the divergence of the field) would be zero in the absence of the \\"gluon terms\\", i.e. those \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mathcal{A}} which represent the non-abelian character of the SU(3). A more mathematically formal derivation of these same ideas (but a slightly altered setting) can be found in the article on metric connections. =Comparison with the electromagnetic tensor= This almost parallels the electromagnetic field tensor (also denoted ) in quantum electrodynamics, given by the electromagnetic four-potential describing a spin-1 photon; :F_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}=\\\\partial_{\\\\alpha}A_{\\\\beta}-\\\\partial_{\\\\beta}A_{\\\\alpha}\\\\,, or in the language of differential forms: :\\\\mathbf{F} = \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\,. The key difference between quantum electrodynamics and quantum chromodynamics is that the gluon field strength has extra terms which lead to self- interactions between the gluons and asymptotic freedom. This is a complication of the strong force making it inherently non-linear, contrary to the linear theory of the electromagnetic force. QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory. The word non-abelian in group-theoretical language means that the group operation is not commutative, making the corresponding Lie algebra non-trivial. QCD Lagrangian density Characteristic of field theories, the dynamics of the field strength are summarized by a suitable Lagrangian density and substitution into the Euler‚ÄìLagrange equation (for fields) obtains the equation of motion for the field. The Lagrangian density for massless quarks, bound by gluons, is: :\\\\mathcal{L}=-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\mathrm{tr}\\\\left(G_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}G^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}\\\\right)+ \\\\bar{\\\\psi}\\\\left(iD_\\\\mu \\\\right)\\\\gamma^\\\\mu\\\\psi where \\"tr\\" denotes trace of the matrix , and are the gamma matrices. In the fermionic term i\\\\bar{\\\\psi}\\\\left(iD_\\\\mu\\\\right)\\\\gamma^{\\\\mu}\\\\psi, both color and spinor indices are suppressed. With indices explicit, \\\\psi_{i,\\\\alpha} where i=1,\\\\ldots ,3 are color indices and \\\\alpha=1,\\\\ldots,4 are Dirac spinor indices. Gauge transformations In contrast to QED, the gluon field strength tensor is not gauge invariant by itself. Only the product of two contracted over all indices is gauge invariant. Equations of motion Treated as a classical field theory, the equations of motion for the quark fields are: :( i\\\\hbar \\\\gamma^\\\\mu D_\\\\mu - mc ) \\\\psi = 0 which is like the Dirac equation, and the equations of motion for the gluon (gauge) fields are: :\\\\left[D_\\\\mu , G^{\\\\mu u} \\\\right] = g_s j^ u which are similar to the Maxwell equations (when written in tensor notation). More specifically, these are the Yang‚ÄìMills equations for quark and gluon fields. The color charge four-current is the source of the gluon field strength tensor, analogous to the electromagnetic four-current as the source of the electromagnetic tensor. It is given by :j^ u = t^b j_b^ u \\\\,, \\\\quad j_b^ u = \\\\bar{\\\\psi}\\\\gamma^ u t^b \\\\psi, which is a conserved current since color charge is conserved. In other words, the color four-current must satisfy the continuity equation: :D_ u j^ u = 0 \\\\,.

After finishing unplaced on his only race as a two-year-old in 1900, he won five times in 1901 as well as finishing second in The Derby. He reached his peak as a four-year-old, winning five consecutive races including the Ascot Gold Cup, Queen Alexandra Stakes and Doncaster Cup. His career was ended by injury in early 1903 and he was retired to stud, where he had considerable success as a sire of winners. Background William the Third was a bay horse with a narrow white blaze and two white socks bred by his owner William Cavendish-Bentinck, 6th Duke of Portland. Like most of the Duke's horses, he was trained by John Porter at his Kingsclere Stables near Newbury, Berkshire. When fully grown he stood 16 hands high and was described as being of \\"superb quality\\" with a \\"beautiful and intelligent\\" head. William the Third was one of the last notable horses sired by St. Simon, an undefeated racehorse who was considered one of the best British runners of the 19th Century. In an outstanding stud career he won nine sires‚Äô championships, having sired ten Classic winners. His dam, Gravity, was a daughter of the influential broodmare Enigma, the direct female ancestor of many major winners including Reigh Count, Candy Spots and Martial. Gravity herself produced William the Third's full-sister Gravitation, the great-great-granddam of the American Horse of the Year Granville. Racing career=1900: two-year-old season= William the Third showed little immediate promise as a two-year-old and made only one racecourse appearance. In October he ran in the Clearwell Stakes over five furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse and finished unplaced. =1901: three-year- old season= In the spring of 1901, William the Third showed much improved form. On his first appearance as a three-year-old he won the Wood Ditton Stakes at Newmarket in April by six lengths. He was then sent to Sandown Park in early May where he won the Esher Stakes, again by six lengths. Later that month, the colt established himself as a classic contender when he won the ten furlong Newmarket Stakes by a short head, beating Doricles, a horse who finished second in the 2000 Guineas on his previous start. William the Third was then sent to Epsom Downs Racecourse to contest the 122nd running of the Derby Stakes for which he started at odds of 100/7 in a field of twenty-five runners. Ridden by Morny Cannon, he turned into the straight in seventh place and moved up to second approaching the final furlong, but although he \\"struggled on hard\\" he was beaten three quarters of a length by Volodyovski, four lengths clear of the remainder. William the Third and Volodyovski met again in the Lennox Stakes at Hurst Park in August. Carrying three pounds less than his opponent, the Duke's colt defeated the Derby winner by a head. William the Third had not been entered for the St Leger Stakes (won by Doricles), and ended his season by running against older horses for the first time in the Kempton Park Stakes. He ran disappointingly, finishing unplaced behind the four-year-old gelding Epsom Lad. =1902: four-year-old season= William the Third won his first five races of 1902, proving himself the best stayer of the year in England. On his debut he was sent to Royal Ascot for the two-and-a-half-mile Gold Cup which attracted an extremely strong field. The runners included the classic winners Volodyovski and Cap and Bells (Epsom Oaks), the leading British older horses Osbech (Coronation Cup) and Santoi (1901 Ascot Gold Cup), and the French challengers Cheri (Grand Prix de Paris) and La Camargo (Prix de Diane). The day attracted a large and fashionable crowd to Ascot, including the Queen and the Prince and Princess of Wales Ridden by Morny Cannon, William the Third, who started the 2/1 favourite, was held up towards the back of the field of runners until the straight. He then accelerated past his rivals and won easily by five lengths to record a popular victory. The winner reappeared the following afternoon for the Queen Alexandra Stakes over two miles and six furlongs. Despite carrying top weight of 136 pounds, he won by six lengths. After a three-month break, William the Third returned in September for the Doncaster Cup and won by eight lengths at odds of 1/10. At Newmarket in October he walked over in the Lowther Stakes when no horse appeared to oppose him and then wonn the Limekiln Stakes over one and a half miles. On his final start of the season he started odds on favourite for the two-and-a-half-mile Jockey Club Cup but was surprisingly beaten by the Cesarewitch Handicap winner Black Sand. William the Third remained in training as a five-year-old but sustained a serious pastern injury in training and was retired to stud without racing again. Assessment In their book A Century of Champions, based on an adaptation of the Timeform system, John Randall and Tony Morris awarded William the Third a rating of 135, making him a \\"superior\\" Gold Cup winner, and the best British racehorse of his generation. Stud career William the Third was retired to become a breeding stallion at his owner's stud at Welbeck Abbey. He was a successful sire of winners, twice finishing second in the sires' championship. His only classic winner was the 1000 Guineas winner Winkipop (later a successful broodmare). He died suddenly of a cerebral haemorrhage at Welbeck on 21 February 1917. Five years later he was Leading broodmare sire in Great Britain & Ireland.

While born in Malaysia, Tovey grew up in Perth and has always called Western Australia home. Early life Tovey was born in Penang, Malaysia. He grew up in Perth, Western Australia and attended Willetton Senior High School, where he was a member of the silver-medal winning team at the 2002 Australian National High School Tournament. Between 2003 and 2006, Tovey played for the Willetton Tigers in the State Basketball League (SBL), earning SBL Most Improved Player honours in 2004. In 2004, Tovey moved to the United States to play college basketball for Augusta State University. In March 2005, he was named the Peach Belt Conference Freshman of the Year, becoming the fourth Jaguar to earn the Freshman of the Year award. Tovey was second on the team and 17th in the PBC in scoring with 11.6 points per game and was also ranked 10th in the PBC in assists with 3.2 per contest. He completed his freshman year having started all 30 games for the Jaguars, averaging 12.0 points, a team-high 7.4 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 1.5 steals per game. Following the conclusion of the Peach Belt Conference Tournament, Tovey returned to Australia and ultimately did not return to Augusta. Professional career=Perth Wildcats (2005‚Äì2006)= In June 2005, Tovey signed with his hometown team, the Perth Wildcats. However, his season was cut short after injuring his knee against West Sydney on 10 December 2005. In 22 games for the Wildcats in 2005‚Äì06, he averaged 4.5 points and 1.9 rebounds per game. In March 2006, he parted ways with the Wildcats. =Sydney Kings and Townsville Crocodiles (2006‚Äì2010)= In September 2006, Tovey competed with the Sutherland Sharks at the ABA National Finals, where he earned All-Star Five honours. Later that month, Tovey debuted for the Sydney Kings. In 32 games for the Kings in 2006‚Äì07, he averaged 5.0 points and 2.2 rebounds per game. After another stint with the Sutherland Sharks in 2007, Tovey helped the Kings win the minor premiership and reach the NBL Grand Final series in 2007‚Äì08. In his second season with the Kings, he averaged 6.0 points, 2.8 rebounds and 1.1 assists in 37 games. After returning to Perth in 2008 for a stint with the Kalamunda Eastern Suns, Tovey joined the Townsville Crocodiles for the 2008‚Äì09 NBL season. In 2009, Tovey played for the Townsville Heat in the Queensland Basketball League and competed with the Australian University National Team in Serbia at the World University Summer Games. Tovey then returned to the Crocodiles for the 2009‚Äì10 season. =Second stint with the Wildcats (2010‚Äì2013)= Following the conclusion of the 2009‚Äì10 season, Tovey walked out on the Crocodiles to become an accountant, moving to Perth to begin a career with KPMG which he believed would not allow him to continue his sporting career. Considered one of the league's best defenders, Tovey believed his future career had to take precedence over his present day sporting ambitions. However, in May 2010, Tovey reversed his decision to retire and signed with the Perth Wildcats. In August 2010, Tovey helped the Willetton Tigers win their first SBL Championship with a 107‚Äì96 win over the Lakeside Lightning in the grand final. He was named MVP after finishing with 31 points, nine rebounds and seven assists. Tovey's first season back with the Wildcats saw him hold down jobs as both an NBL basketballer and accountant at the same time. Despite this, he averaged career-best numbers in 2010‚Äì11 with 8.1 points, 5.0 rebounds and 2.6 assists per game. He subsequently re-joined the Willetton Tigers for the 2011 season, but he missed their finals run. Over the following two seasons, Tovey helped the Wildcats reach back-to-back NBL Grand Finals, both resulting in losses to the New Zealand Breakers. On 28 March 2013, Tovey announced his decision to retire at the conclusion of the 2012‚Äì13 season. Personal Tovey is the son of David and Julie Tovey, and has two sisters, Stephanie and Hannah.Cameron Tovey Bio In September 2020, Tovey was elected Chairman of Willetton Basketball Association (WBA).

SCEC was a non departmental public body. It focussed upon three broad themes - promoting lifelong learning; confronting social change; and, releasing local dynamic and liberating resources. SCEC's first Chair was Elizabeth Carnegy, who had previously chaired a government committee into professional community education training. The Council had four directors Ralph Wilson 1982-86, Dorothy Dalton 1986-90, Esther Robertson 1990-93 and Charlie McConnell 1993-2002. SCEC provided information, publications, training and consultancy services to community education practitioners. It was later given the function of validating and endorsing professional community education training. In the nineties SCEC opened a European office in Brussels, which became the hub of a European wide network of information services - called Eurodesk. SCEC also hosted the International Association for Community Development, the main international organisation for practitioners in this field. SCEC published three professional journals, research and practice publications and a regular supplement in Scotland's largest selling paper the Daily Record, ran conferences and training to support practitioners and trainers of community educators. SCEC played a lead role in creating a UK wide training standards organisation for community learning and development. This was called PAULO, named after the Brazilian community educator Paulo Freire. After this the term community education was replaced by community learning and development to describe the sector. Following devolution, the new Scottish government decided to split the agency up, with its core advisory and professional validation and endorsement functions being located within a new agency called Communities Scotland. The professional validation and endorsement function was extended following the Government's report Empowered to Practice and this led to the establishment of the Scottish Standards Council for Community Learning and Development.

Plot Akaash (Kartik Aaryan) is a bold and fun-loving young man, while Vani (Nushrat Bharucha) is a conservative but friendly girl. They are both accepted in the same college in Delhi, and after a series of adventures, soon become friends, forming part of a group of four. Akaash and Vani eventually fall in love and embark on a four-year relationship, which is kept secret from Vani's traditional parents. As their final year comes to an end, Akaash decides to go to the UK for his further studies. Vani returns to her home town of Dehradun to attend her sister's wedding, after which she plans to study for an M.B.A. She tells her sister about her relationship with Akaash, but her sister reacts negatively, saying that their parents would not approve. The next day, amidst the wedding preparation, Vani finds out that her sister has eloped with another man, who she was in love with but was not accepted by her parents. Vani's parents are heartbroken and have to endure the shame of their neighbours and community. In the fear of society's response, they decide to get Vani married to the son of an acquaintance. Pressured by her parents and feeling guilt over her sister's actions, Vani reluctantly agrees. She emotionally ends things with Akaash via a phone call and requests him not to try and meet her. Akaash is devastated but slowly becomes bitter and detached with time. Vani's husband Ravi (Sunny Nijar) is a charming but controlling man who pressures Vani to have sex, despite her reluctance. Ravi is emotionally abusive and expects Vani to cater to his every need, but pretends to be a perfect husband in front of friends and family. He prevents her from going out, working or furthering her studies, and expects her to be a full-time housewife. After an argument, Vani returns home and reveals her unhappiness to her parents. However, they send her back to Ravi after he charms them, and ask him to consider starting a family in order to occupy Vani's time. Time goes by and Vani slowly begins losing self- confidence and becomes resigned to her fate. One day, Vani's aunt and uncle unexpectedly come to visit her and suggest that she go back with them for several days to Delhi, in order to attend her college reunion. Ravi is unhappy but reluctantly agrees, since he will also be away for some time on a business trip. At the college, Vani reunites with her friends, who find her to be reserved and depressed. She also comes across Akaash, who is still bitter and hurt about their break up. He angrily confronts her and she runs away, deciding to return home that night. Her friends meet her at the train station and Akaash finally breaks down and cries, something which he has not allowed himself to do previously. Vani decides to stay. The group spend the week together, during which time they have fun and re-live their college memories. Vani tells Akaash the truth about her marriage but says that she cannot divorce Ravi because her parents won't be able to handle it, especially after her sister eloped. Akaash tells his friend that he hopes to reunite with Vani and plans to fill her days with adventures and happiness. He hopes that this will raise her spirits and give her the courage to leave Ravi. The group travel to Chandigarh where Akaash and Vani spend time alone together and rekindle their romance. The trip is cut short by a phone call from Vani's parents, requesting her to visit them. Conflicted, Vani chooses to return home and emotionally leaves her friends and Akaash behind. Akaash decides that he can't lose Vani once again and the group follows Vani to her home. They stay happily with Vani's parents until Ravi arrives there, too. Akaash observes the way Vani assumes the role of a subservient wife and how she is ill-treated by her husband. That night, Vani finally realizes that she can no longer live with a man who cannot respect her. In front of Ravi and her friends, she reveals the truth to her parents about the rape and emotional abuse and says that she wants a divorce. They are stunned and try to reason with her but she stands her ground. An argument breaks out and she slaps Ravi, after which he moves to hit her, only to be stopped by Akaash. Ravi realizes that the two are in love and insults Vani's parents. Vani's parents are embarrassed but she defiantly tells them that her happiness is more important than their shame, and leaves the house. Vani returns to Delhi with her friends, where she is able to finally further her studies and get her M.B.A. degree. She happily divorces Ravi and later marries Akaash.

The film stars John Schneider as Michael Landon, Cheryl Ladd as his second wife Lynn Noe Landon, and Joel Berti, Trever O'Brien and Shawn Pyfrom sharing the role of their eldest son, Michael Landon Jr. throughout his childhood years. The film originally premiered on CBS on May 23, 1999. Synopsis The film opens with Michael Landon Jr. as a child (Shawn Pyfrom) living a comfortable and happy life with his family; his father, Bonanza star Michael Landon (John Schneider), his mother, Lynn Noe Landon (Cheryl Ladd), and his elder sister, Leslie Landon (Rachel Duncan). Michael Sr. is a compassionate and loving father who dotes on his children and, when Lynn announces a new baby is on the way, the family moves to a larger house in the San Fernando Valley. As the family grows and life begins to change, Michael Sr. becomes dissatisfied with his career and home life and his desire to fulfil his own needs begins to take precedence over those of his wife and children. Soon, a now teenage Michael Jr. (Trever O'Brien) and the rest of the Landon family learn that Michael Sr. has begun an extra-marital romance with Little House on the Prairie make-up artist, Cindy (Julie Condra), prompting Michael Sr. to eventually divorce Lynn and marry the younger woman. Feeling rejected as a result of the distant relationship that develops over time as their father begins a new family with Cindy, a now young adult Michael Jr. (Joel Berti) begins to struggle in his college classes and turns to alcohol, while his sister Leslie (Sarah Lancaster) develops bulimia, believing that her estranged father might take more of an interest in her if she were thinner. After dropping out of school and overcoming his alcohol dependency, Michael Jr. eventually meets his future wife while working on the set of Highway to Heaven and the young couple are soon married. However, the newlyweds' happiness is short-lived when Michael Jr. learns that his father has been diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer. In one of their final conversations, Michael Sr. discloses the truth of his own unstable childhood, which may have been part of the reason for his irrational behaviour and turbulent family life as an adult.

Ashley Landon Development Michael Landon Jr. has stated that the film is based on a combination of his own experiences growing up and the last interview his father gave which was published in the June 1991 issue of Life magazine shortly before his death. In February 2005, Landon Jr. explained how the screenplay was conceived, saying \\"The movie was centered around the divorce, and that was my main reason for making the film. I basically used the guidelines my father had set in his Life magazine article, the last interview he gave before he died. The movie put things in perspective from my point of view ‚Äî the affair, his drinking, everything in the Life article. I went by the parameters set by my father in that article, and I was not going to disrespect those parameters. The only difference was that it was exploring what I was going through, and my brothers and sisters were going through.\\" Reception The film received mixed reviews, with some critics detecting an element of retribution in Landon Jr.'s screenplay. Entertainment Weekly critic Ken Tucker gave the film a C+ writing, \\"[L]ove starved, Michael Landon Jr. harbors little affection for one of TV's most beloved stars. Where the public saw the elder Landon as a cocky-but-concerned family man, Junior recalls a workaholic who neglected the kids of his multiple marriages in favor of a succession of ever- younger wives. [...] As therapy for its creator, The Father I Knew is probably healing; as drama for us, it's congealing. But the movie is also so excessive ‚Äî in its abject emotionalism, its dime-store psychologizing, its casting ‚Äî that this version of Daddy Dearest exerts a certain undeniable pull.\\" People magazine critic Terry Kelleher felt similarly, writing \\"There's talk of forgiving and moving on in the last stages of this TV movie. But its director, Michael Landon Jr., seems more intent on making sure the world knows that his famous father (who died of cancer in 1991) was a hypocrite. No matter how well-founded the son's grievances, his film memoir feels vindictive as well as heavy-handed. [...] The story ends on a note of reconciliation, but the dominant chord is one of resentment. Bottom Line: Honesty is fine, but this smacks of getting even with Dad.\\" Variety critic Stuart Levine felt the film did a good job of chronicling the elder Landon's emotional phases, writing \\"Michael Landon, who starred in wholesome family dramas throughout his five- decade television career before his death in 1991, didn't always find that warmth in his own home, as illustrated in CBS' thoughtful, if somewhat predictable, \\"Michael Landon, the Father I Knew.\\" John Schneider does a solid job of capturing Landon's life as an actor, father and often-confused husband, but it's helmer Michael Landon Jr.'s memories of a loving but then suddenly distanced parent that make for a touching story.\\" ReferencesExternal links  * Category:1999 television films Category:1999 films Category:1990s biographical drama films Category:American films Category:American biographical drama films Category:Biographical films about actors Category:Drama films based on actual events Category:English-language films Category:CBS network films Category:Films directed by Michael Landon Jr. ","title":"Michael Landon, the Father I Knew"},{"id":"38185112","text":"Gaocheng () is a town in Gaoqing County in northern Shandong province, China, located southeast of the county seat. , it has 42 villages under its administration.

It is reported to be the most estrogenic phytoestrogen known. The compound is equipotent at the two forms of estrogen receptors, ERŒ± and ERŒ≤, and it acts as a full agonist of ERŒ±. Its effects are similar to those of estradiol, but it is considerably less potent in comparison. 8-PN is found in hops (Humulus lupulus) and in beer, and is responsible for the estrogenic effects of the former. It can be produced from isoxanthohumol in fungal cells cultures, and by flora in the human intestine. Properties=Estrogenic= 8-PN was shown to preserve bone density and has been demonstrated to reduce hot flashes. 8-PN also induces the secretion of prolactin, and increases other estrogenic responses. The compound binds to and activates ERŒ± more times than it does to ERŒ≤. This prenylflavanoid has drawn interest in the study of hormone replacement therapy, and it is comparable to some selective estrogen-receptor modulators. In an in vivo study, 8-PN has activated proliferation of mammary cells. At the concentration found in beer, it is unlikely to have an estrogenic effect in breast tissue. Similar to other estrogens, 8-PN induces the expression of the progesterone receptor in various tissues. Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) are suppressed by 8-PN, indicating that it possesses antigonadotropic properties. 8-PN adversely affects male sperm. The role 8-PN plays in fertility requires further research. =Other= In an in vitro study, 8-PN and synthetic derivatives demonstrated anticancer properties. More recently, a radioligand binding study showed enhancements in GABAA receptor activity by 8-PN Prenylflavonoids from hops, including 8-PN, are ingredients in some breast enlargement supplements, though there is no evidence of its effectiveness for this purpose. Chemistry The enzyme naringenin 8-dimethylallyltransferase uses dimethylallyl diphosphate and (‚àí)-(2S)-naringenin to produce diphosphate and sophoraflavanone B (8-prenylnaringenin). The enzyme 8-dimethylallylnaringenin 2'-hydroxylase uses sophoraflavanone B (8-prenylnaringenin), NADPH, H+ and O2 to produce leachianone G, NADP+ and H2O. Synthesized derivatives of 8-PN are: 7,4‚Ä≤-di-O- methyl-8-prenylnaringenin; 7-O-pentyl-8-prenylnaringenin; 7,4‚Ä≤-Di-O- allyl-8-prenylnaringenin; 7,4‚Ä≤-Di-O-acetyl-8-prenylnaringenin; and 7,4‚Ä≤-Di-O- palmitoyl-8-prenylnaringenin. 8-Neopentylnaringenin and 8-n-heptylnaringenin are synthetic derivatives of 8-PN. Etymology There is another compound, 8-isopentenylnaringenin, also known as sophoraflavanone B, from Sophora flavescens, that could properly be called 8-prenylnaringenin by scientific naming convention.
