He was the third son of Nicol√≤ di Alvise of the family branch of San Polo and Maria Barbarigo di Antonio. In 1622 he was sentenced to death for high treason by the Council of Ten and executed. Ten months later, the same council rehabilitated Antonio Foscarini and explicitly informed the European courts of his posthumous exoneration, and the revocation of the guilty verdict and death sentence. Notwithstanding the about turn, mystery still remains as to why an art-loving nobleman was embroiled in a Venetian tale of political intrigue, that involved factional infighting, institutional disputes between Church and State, and religious hostilities over Protestantism and Catholicism at the beginning of the Thirty Years' War, that led to the death of an innocent man. Background and early political career Antonio Foscarini had two brothers, Alvise (1560‚Äì1617) and Girolamo (1561‚Äì1580), and three sisters, Caterina, Agnesina, and Luca Contarini. The Foscarini family lost a substantial part of their wealth, from the Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War (1570‚Äì1573) and only the sons received financial support. His father Nicol√≤ died in 1575, and his mother died in 1582, probably by suicide. Antonio studied in Padua, where he made several lifelong friendships. From 1590 he and his remaining brother Alvise led the household, and in 1592 they agreed to share the considerable fortune of about 70,000 ducats that remained. The family property included estates in Padua, Mestrino, Verona and Venice, including the family home in San Polo. In 1595 Foscarini gained a seat in the Grand Council and in September 1597 was elected to the 'Savio agli Ordini', - the lowest level in the council of ministers the 'Collegio' - where he was witness to the factional infighting between 'conservatives' and 'innovators', the two opposing groups of the nobility. He became a supporter of the 'innovator' Paolo Sarpi. Diplomatic career Foscarini began his political career as an envoy to the court of Henry IV of France in 1601 and was present at the king's marriage to Maria de Medici. On May 26, 1607 he was appointed as ambassador to France but did not assume the role until February the next year. In July 1610 he was made ambassador to England, but here too he delayed taking up the position until May 4 of the following year. These delays in taking up his two appointments formed part of the accusations against him during his two trials, but it was found that he otherwise behaved fittingly. Accusations that he dressed poorly and was stingy were not trivial matters in the estates society. His opposition to the Pope and the Jesuit order was no secret. First Arrest In February 1615 his secretary, Giulio Muscorno, denounced Foscarini before the Council of Ten, accusing him of selling state secrets to Spain. When Muscorno returned to Venice in March, his replacement, Giovanni Rizzardo, was requested to secretly gather evidence against Foscarini. Foscarini was arrested on his arrival in Venice in December. Three years later he was released without charge and formally absolved on July 30, 1618. In London between January 1616 and June 1617 his successor as ambassador to England, Gregorio Barbarigo, and his secretary Lionello, had searched in vain for evidence against him. In 1620 Foscarini was elected to the senate.Rizzardo's letters to the Inquisitors of State in Vols. XIII and XIV of Calendar & Appendix latter vol. The Countess of Arundel and the Second Arrest In 1621, Alethea Howard, Countess of Arundel, reached Venice. She was the granddaughter of Elizabeth of Hardwick, a goddaughter of Queen Elizabeth I, and wife of Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel, a leading person at the court of King James I of England. Foscarini was a friend of the art-loving couple from London and visited the pair at the Palazzo Mocenigo on the Grand Canal where they were staying. On April 8, 1622 Foscarini was arrested leaving the Senate. The Council of Ten accused him of meeting with ministers of foreign powers, both in Venice and abroad, and of betraying in words and in writing the most intimate secrets of the Republic. Foscarini was accused of disclosing state secrets to the secretary of Emperor Ferdinand II and to the nuncio of the Pope at the Arundel residence. The agents of the State Inquisition, Domenico and Girolomo Vano were the key witnesses. These, in turn, had received their information from Gian Battista, the servant of the Spanish Ambassador. Sir Henry Wotton, England's ambassador to Venice, wrote to Arundel that the Senate would declare her an 'unwanted person' and advised her to leave the city immediately. Instead, she hurried to Wotton and requested an audience with Doge Antonio Priuli.Thomas Duffus Hardy, 'Report', in Report to the Master of the Rolls On Documents in the Archives of Venice (London, 1866), pp. 3-41. She threatened the ambassador, whom she suspected of being involved in the action of the Council of Ten to call for her removal. In fact, she was not only admitted to the Doge, but he assured her that no one wanted to banish her, and promised to restore the honor of Foscarini by writing to London. Six months later she left Venice, bestowed with gifts from the Doge.Thomas Duffus Hardy, 'Appendix: F. Papers Relating to the Countess of Arundel', in Report to the Master of the Rolls On Documents in the Archives of Venice (London, 1866), pp. 76-84. The Trial The account of the advocate Andrea Querini:Case of the Cavalier Foscarini, by the Advocate Andrea Querini.734. The case against Foscarini was preceded by about twelve processes of small consequence that began with letters from England in 1605 written to the Supreme Tribunal by his secretary Giulio Muscorno. Foscarini was said to have incurred the hatred of the King and Court by imprudent discourse to the detriment of public affairs. He wrote to defend himself and Muscorno replied that he went in danger of his life from the ambassador. Subsequently, Foscarini was accused of corresponding with foreigners, and the greater part of the process turned upon this, but in the absence of real proof, only a caution was issued. In 1622, informers declared to the tribunal to have repeatedly seen Foscarini talking with the Spanish ambassador under a certain 'sottoportico in Canareggio'. When questioned Foscarini did not deny the place or the hour but the person and the fact. A presumption of his guilt being established, he was condemned. Giovan Battista Nani describes these events in his Historia della Republica Veneta,Historia della Republica Veneta, book five published in the latter half of the century, but his account contains inaccuracies, as Foscarini's arrival in England was after the beginning of May, 1611 and Muscorno's letters were sent in 1613. Despite the assurances of the Doge given earlier to the Countess Arundel, Foscarini was convicted on April 22. He was strangled in jail and his body was, in the manner usual for those convicted of high treason, hung head down between the pillars in the Piazzetta. Before being so hung, his body had been dragged along the ground, from morning to dusk by one leg. Rehabilitation Meanwhile, one of the inquisitors was suspicious and had interrogated the Spanish servant further, whereby he confessed to not having seen Foscarini in the Spanish ambassador's house. Girolamo, who had received a salary on May 23 for services not mentioned, and Domenico Vano, were both summoned and interviewed in August. They confessed to a conspiracy to discredit Foscarini, but the redacted court records reveal no motive, nor who may have been behind the conspiracy. The Vano pair were convicted but before they were executed, the Foscarini nephews, Nicol√≤ and Girolamo Foscarini, had petitioned the Council of Ten for further interrogation to reveal any co-conspirators, but this was declined. The English ambassador suspected this suggested either the statements of the convicted were of no value, or there were reasons of state. On 16 January 1623, ten months after the Council of Ten had convicted Antonio Foscarini of high treason, he was exonerated of all charges by the same council. The prosecutors were brought before the State Inquisition and the Council of Ten. The latter publicly acknowledged their error. Copies of the corresponding letters were sent to the Foscarini family and to all the estates in Europe. Foscarini was exhumed and reburied with a state funeral. A statue was erected in the Foscarini Chapel in the church of San Stae on the Grand Canal. The Doge Marco Foscarini (1762-1763), a descendant of Antonio's brother Alvise, praised the Council of Ten for revoking its earlier judgment. Background Antonio Foscarini was a follower of the so-called 'Giovani', a group in the Venetian nobility with sympathy for the Protestant rulers who supported them during the Thirty Years' War. When Foscarini was an ambassador to London, he made friends with Sir Henry WottonSmith, Logan Pearsall, The Life and Letters of Sir HenryWotton, Vol. II, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1907), pp. 163-4. (later to become British ambassador to Venice) and formed a formal alliance with England. In addition, Venice had drawn the consequences in a lawsuit since 1605 and banished Theatines, Capuchins and Jesuits from its dominion. In return, the Pope had imposed on 17 April 1606, the Interdict on Venice. When this was abolished in 1607, the Jesuits were not allowed to return. The Venetian Republic challenged Papal authority and mistrusted the Jesuit order, with its strong Spanish ties. Venice resented Spanish power and her league with Florence, Milan and Naples. Savoy was the only other Italian state not subject to Spanish supremacy. Paolo Sarpi led an anti-papal group, opposing temporal privileges of the Pope. The conflict between the 'Giovani' (the boys), and their opponents, 'Il Vecchi', (the ancients), also Papists was an important background to Foscarini's conviction. Until the death of Doge Leonardo Donato (1606-1612), 'the boys' dominated, but until 1631 they had intermittent influence. The Habsburgs, leaders of the Counter-Reformation forces, involved Venice in a war under the leadership of Archduke Ferdinand, who in 1617 entered into the Treaty of Madrid. The Spanish Viceroy in Naples, the Duke of Osuna, refused to surrender. While his ships attacked Venetian merchants in the Adriatic, rumors circulated in Venice that the Spanish embassy was forming a core of supporters against the city. Many Venetians gathered before the embassy and the courts condemned more than a hundred men for treason. Three Spaniards were executed immediately. The coup attempt sparked strong anti-Spanish sentiment in Venice even among pro-papal groups. Significantly Giambattista Bragadino, a member of the impoverished nobility, the so-called Barnabotti, having confessed to contact with the Spanish ambassador, was also executed. With the crowd surrounding the embassy, the Spanish Ambassador, the Marquess of Bedmar, decided to leave the city. The denunciation of Antonio Foscarini by his secretary Giulio Muscarno, and subsequent arrest in 1615 had come in the midst of this crisis. He was eventually acquitted of selling information to the Spaniards but only after three years in detention. Muscarno was stripped of his office and sentenced to two years in prison. Foscarini's second denunciation in 1622 may have arisen from first indictment, his Protestant sympathies, the antipathy of his secretary Muscarno, or the general fear of Spain's intrigue, but which of these, is impossible to ascertain. Since 1310 the Council of the Ten dealt with cases of high treason. For both important dates, the day of the conviction (22 April 1622) and day of the rehabilitation (16 January 1623), the composition of the Council of the Ten is known. This Council of Ten, which had six councilors in addition to the Doge, consisted of ten senators, although a total of 17 men participated at the meetings. From their circle these determined three administrators of state, or 'Avogadori di Commun', one of whom would be a council of the Doge, the other two were elected by the senators. The three 'Avogadori' retained numerous informers, informants and henchmen, paid for from their own cash funds, and kept no records. The senate election to the council were for one year terms, but the term commencement dates varied, so the Council composition changed monthly, but gradually. Doge Antonio Priuli, Alvise Contarini, Francesco Molin and Battista Nani were all possible Papists, but the number of Papist members of the Council in 1622 cannot be determined. In 1623, the presidents, (Capi), were Anzolo da Mosto, Marcantonio Mocenigo and Nicol√≤ Contarini. According to Sarpi, Contarini was one of the brains of the Giovani, and Mocenigo supported them. Only Battista Nani, the third to sign the rehabilitation, was not one of them. Nani had been in the Council of Ten at the time of the sentencing of 1622, but had been one of four who voted for imprisonment and not execution. Vincenzo Dandolo, like Nani, was present at both sessions. He was an old acquaintance of Contarini and probably owed him his Senate seat, and they had fought together in the Gradisca War 1615‚Äì1617. He had sought the harshest condemnation, and in 1623, voted for rehabilitation. Whether the 'Giovani' and 'Papalisti' rivalry was behind the execution and rehabilitation is unknown. In 1622 Foscarini was so discredited that Paolo Sarpi had publicly declined the 100 ducats from the legacy of Foscarini, provided in his Will, on the eve of the execution for Sarpi's prayers. Sarpi may have rejected the inheritance in the belief of his guilt, or he may have feared for himself and his group.

He used numerous aliases, taking Lisle as a surname additional to his original name, and published in 1799 The Life of Major J. G. Semple-Lisle, an autobiography, from Tothill Fields Prison. Life He was born James George Semple at Irvine, Ayrshire, the son of James Semple, an exciseman and peerage claimant to the title Viscount Lisle. In 1776 he was soldier serving in British North America, was taken prisoner in the American Revolutionary War, then was released and came back to Great Britain. Semple came to know the novelist Elizabeth Sarah Gooch, with whom he had a brief relationship.Joseph W. Reed, Jr., Boswell and the Major, The Kenyon Review Vol. 28, No. 2 (Mar., 1966), pp. 161‚Äì184, Published by: Kenyon College Marrying a goddaughter of Elizabeth Pierrepont, Duchess of Kingston-upon-Hull, he accompanied the latter to the continent of Europe. He made autobiographical claims about this period to 1784, involving Frederick the Great during his bloodless campaign of 1778, Catharine of Russia, and Prince Potemkin. He also visited Copenhagen. Returning to England in 1784, Semple was arrested for obtaining goods by false pretences, and on 2 September 1786 was sentenced to seven years' transportation. Released on condition of leaving England, he went to Paris: he later claimed to have served on General Jean-Fran√ßois Berruyer's staff, and so to have witnessed in the execution of Louis XVI. Back England to avoid arrest, he was again, on 18 February 1795, sentenced to transportation for defrauding tradesmen. In Newgate Prison that year he had dinner with James Boswell, to whom as a lawyer he applied for help with his case. Unable to obtain a pardon, Semple stabbed himself in Newgate Prison in 1796, when about to be shipped for Botany Bay, and then tried to starve himself to death. He recovered, however, and in 1798 was despatched in the Lady Jane Shore transport, bound for Australia. During the voyage a mutiny broke out, Semple's warning of the plot having been disregarded by the captain, Wilcox. Semple, with several others, was allowed to put off in a boat, landed in South America, and, after adventures, reached Tangier, where he gave himself up, and was sent back to England. Semple was committed to Tothill Fields prison, and at the time of publishing his autobiography in 1799 was still confined there. In 1804 he offered himself to the government, as a spy. In 1807 he was charged with fraud, but was acquitted. In 1814 he was once again sentenced to transportation, in a fraud case for food. Pardoned by the Prince Regent, he undertook to go to Morocco, and died in Lisbon in 1815.

History  Heilung was founded in 2014 by vocalist Kai Uwe Faust (a German tattoo artist who specializes in Old Norse tattoos), Danish producer Christopher Juul and the Norwegian singer Maria Franz (of the trio Songleikr and the progressive rock/pop-rock band Euzen). In 2015, the band self-released their debut album, Ofnir. The band's first performances in 2017 were at Castlefest and at the Midgardsblot Metalfestival. The Castlefest performance was recorded and released with the title Lifa on YouTube and as a live album. Their 2017 performance at Midgardsblot was listed as one of the ten best performances of 2017 by Metal Hammer. Later that year, the band signed a contract with the label Season of Mist. On 20 April 2018, the two previously self-released albums Ofnir and Lifa were reissued on vinyl and CD.  Style  According to Faust, the name of the band \\"Heilung\\", healing in German, says something about the style of the band: \\"The listener is supposed to be left at ease and in a relaxed state after a magical musical journey that is at times turbulent\\". The recordings of the band are not limited to music, but also contain poems. The references to the early ages of European Civilization are also made by using texts from historical artefacts or historical poems. The languages used are varied, with German, English, Gothic, Old High German, Icelandic, Old English, Proto-Norse, Proto-Germanic, and Viking age Old Norse being used. As instruments, items are used that may have been already available to humans in the Iron Age, such as drums, bones or spears. According to an August 2018 interview, the instruments they use consist of: * drums, including one with horse skin painted with human blood, two drums with deerskin and a drum with goatskin * bones, including a human forearm bone and deer bones * a buffalo horn rattle * a clay rattle with human ashes * a Hindu ritual bell * antiques from temples * a reconstructed silver cup from the Viking age * a ravanahatha (an ancient Indian instrument) * other rattles, whistles and percussive instruments Faust's throat singing recalls the Tibetan or Mongolian style. Juul uses a chirping whisper as vocals. Elaborately designed costumes are worn by the band members on stage. These are partly based on the \\"spiritual traditions of the Eurasian circumpolar peoples\\", or are historically correct reproductions of Nordic Bronze Age clothing.

They were enacted in November 1910 by the Fisher Labour Government intent on breaking up a number of very large holdings of underutilised, arable land that was secured during the colonial period. The Land Tax Act's main provision was a graduated tax on the unimproved value of land that applied to the total value of land owned by absentees and applied to the value of the land minus the first ¬£3,000 for non-absentees. A Commissioner of Land Taxation was appointed to administer the legislation and an office under the direction of the Commissioner was created as a branch of Treasury. The first tax return forms were sent on 10 January 1911, which landholders were required to complete so they could be assessed for their land-tax liabilities. The returns were due back by 1 March 1911. Assessments were issued to taxpayers by 21 April 1911, and the tax was payable by the end of June 1911. The tax was not popular with landowners, but a challenge to it in the High Court of Australia found it constitutional. Land valuations brought loud complaints and became the most contentious aspect of the new tax. Landowners had to state the value of their land in their returns, but the tax office could reject those valuations. Landowners could object to assessments, and by mid 1913 over 1,800 appeals and objections had been filed. In its first year about 15,000 land tax returns were assessed. In the first three years land tax revenue was around ¬£1.3 to ¬£1.4 million a year. While the land tax made a contribution to Commonwealth revenue, it was debatable whether it had done much to break up the large estates for closer settlement, and the statistics did not paint a clear picture of what had happened. Some landholders, for example, would reduce their tax liability by splitting their landholdings to relatives, partners or companies to take them below the taxable threshold, and in many cases the cost of the tax was passed on to purchasers or tenants. The land tax was abolished by the Land Tax Abolition Act 1953.

After showing modest form as a juvenile in France she emerged as a top-class performer in the first half of 1957 when she was an unlucky second in the Princess Elizabeth Stakes before winning the 1000 Guineas and finishing third in the Epsom Oaks. In the autumn she added victories in the Prix du Moulin and the Champion Stakes but died at the end of the year. Background Rose Royale was a bay filly bred in France by her owner Aga Khan III. During her racing career she was trained by Alec Head at Chantilly. She was sired by Prince Bio, who won the Poule d'Essai des Poulains in 1944 and became a very successful breeding stallion whose other offspring included Sicambre. Rose Royale was the first foal of her dam Rose of Yeroda who won twice as a juvenile in 1950. She was descended from Honora (foaled 1907), a British mare whose other descendants have included Tap On Wood, Jaazeiro and Skip Away. Racing career =1956: two-year-old season= Rose Royale ran six times as a two- year-old in France in 1956 but failed to win a race. =1957: three-year-old season= On her three-year-old debut Rose Royale was sent to England to contest the Princess Elizabeth Stakes over eight and a half furlongs at Epsom Racecourse and looked a most unlucky loser as she finished second to the Queen's filly Carrozza. On 3 May at Newmarket Racecourse the filly started at odds of 6/1 in a 20-runner field for the 144th running of the 1000 Guineas. Ridden by Charlie Smirke, who had been criticised for his performance at Epsom, she won by two lengths from her stablemate Sensualita with the Irish- trained favourite Angelet in third. The French jockey Jean Massard took over from Smirke when Rose Royale was stepped up in distance and started 11/10 favourite for the Oaks Stakes at Epsom on 7 June. She appeared ill at ease on the firm ground and finished a well-beaten third behind Carrozza and Silken Glider. The filly took a long time to recover from the race and was off the course until September when she finished sixth behind Denisy in the Prix de la Nonette. In the inaugural running of the Prix du Moulin in the following month she was ridden by Roger Poincelet and won from her four-year-old stablemate Chief.https://web.archive.org/web/20160304194528/http://www.france- galop.com/All-the- races.233+M52087573ab0.0.html?&course;_id=9145&no;_cache=1‚Ññ_id=8 Later in October she was back at Newmarket for the ten furlong Champion Stakes and started at odds of 5/2 against opponents including Ballymoss and the Coronation Cup winner Fric. With Massard in the saddle, she came home six lengths clear of the Irish outsider No Complaint, with Fric third and Ballymoss unplaced. Rose Royale was sent to the United States to contest the Washington D C International but ran poorly and finished unplaced behind Mahan. The filly became sick soon after the race and died from an intestinal tumour. Assessment and honours The independent Timeform organisation gave Rose Royale a rating 129 in 1957. In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Rose Royale a \\"superior\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas.

The Blathwayts invited leading suffragettes to visit their house. They created over 40 memorial trees to celebrate these visits in what was known as 'Annie's Arbour'. Militant Suffragettes as secretly identified by the Criminal Record Office (See No. 14) Forrester led an attack on the Manchester Art Gallery on 3 April 1913. She, Evelyn Manesta and Annie Briggs waited until the gallery was closing and then proceeded to break the glass on many of the most valuable paintings. The three attacked the glass of thirteen paintings including two by John Everett Millais and two by George Frederick Watts. Staff were alerted by the sound of broken glass and the three were apprehended. Four of the paintings had been damaged by the broken glass. They were bailed to appear before magistrates the next day. Briggs persuaded the court that she had been present but had not been involved. Evelyn Manesta was given a sentence of a month and Forrester's sentence was three months for malicious damage.

Picture of William Hallet Green Family and education Greene was born in New York City as the son of Susan Bulkley and Hallett Green, recorded in the census as a mulatto coachman who owned his residence on W. 31st Street.Hallett Green family in the 1870 and 1880 census William graduated from City College (now part of the City University of New York) at the age of 19 with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1884. The New York Times reported on his class' graduation, noting that \\"W.H. Greene is the first colored boy who has ever graduated from the college, and he has made a good record. The audience applauded him liberally last night.\\" His portrait now hangs in the Trustee Lounge of the City University of New York. Enlistment in the Signal Corps Greene applied to the U.S. Signal Corps but was initially rejected, as they did not accept any black members at that time. His case was taken up by the then-president of City College, General Alexander Webb, who wrote to Secretary of War Robert Todd Lincoln on behalf of Greene. Lincoln agreed that Greene deserved a place in the Signal Corps but faced strong opposition from Brigadier General William Hazen, Commanding Officer of the Signal Corps. Hazen's opposition rested on the convention (approved by Congress) that black soldiers could only serve in four regiments, two in the cavalry and two in the infantry. After Lincoln overruled Hazen's interpretation of this convention, Greene was accepted into the U.S. Signal Corps as its first African-American member. He had received a high score on the Corps' competitive entrance exam. Greene served under conditions of duress in Pensacola, Florida, before being transferred to Rochester, New York. In 1887, only a few years after he enlisted, Greene was unfairly yet dishonorably discharged from the Corps after a series of disputed claims regarding his behavior and character. He later changed his name and moved to New Orleans, Louisiana to start a new life with a new identity to escape the pain and dishonor brought to him at the hands of the military during Jim Crow. Legacy His enlistment in the Signal Corps in September 1884 opened the door for other African-Americans to enlist in some branches of the Army from which they were previously barred, including the Hospital Corps, Ordnance Corps, Commissary, and Quartermaster Departments. Greene is considered to be the first black meteorologist and first black station chief in the Signal Corps. In 2007, the New York State Assembly's Standing Committee on Veterans‚Äô Affairs paid tribute to Greene's triumphs and challenges with a resolution, \\"Honoring the Life and Accomplishment of William Hallett Greene, the First Black Graduate of the City University of New York, and Member of the United States Army Signal Corps.\\"  See also  * Military history of African Americans * Henry Ossian Flipper * List of African-American firsts References Category:1864 births Category:Date of birth unknown Category:1942 deaths Category:Year of death uncertain Category:African- American history of the United States military Category:19th-century American military personnel Category:African-American military personnel Category:City College of New York alumni ","title":"William Hallett Greene"},{"id":"57286640","text":"A greenfield airport is an aviation facility with greenfield project characteristics. The designation reflects certain environmental qualities (using previously undeveloped or empty greenfield land, for example) and commissioning, planning and construction processes that are generally carried out from scratch. While a green field found in nature is defined as a wide expanse of natural land (meadow, prairie, grassland), here greenfield denotes that a project lacks any constraints imposed upon it by prior work or existing infrastructure. (A brownfield, on the other hand, remodels or improves upon existing facilities.) Such projects can be highly coveted by engineers as no time must be allotted for demolition of unneeded buildings, etc. constructed in developed areas for the development of the particular place While modern greenfield airports are under construction in Beijing, Istanbul, and Sydney, India's greenfield airport project schedule is among the world's most robust.

It is endemic to New Zealand. It is classified as critically endangered by the Department of Conservation. Taxonomy This species was first described by Cajetan Felder and Alois Friedrich Rogenhofer in 1875 as Cidaria obarata. The holotype specimen was collected by Thomas R. Oxley in Nelson and is held at the Natural History Museum in London. Edward Meyrick placed the species within the genus Larentia in 1884. In 1898 George Vernon Hudson placed the species within the genus Xanthorhoe. In 1971 John S. Dugdale assigned Xanthorhoe obarata to the genus Asaphodes.  Description  Hudson described A. obarata as follows:  Distribution  A. obarata is endemic to New Zealand. As well as Nelson, it has been collected in Wellington, Christchurch and at the foot of Mount Hutt. It has also been collected at Waimarino and Ohakune in the North Island as well as Akaroa, Otira, Dunedin, Queenstown and Invercargill in the South Island. There has been a contraction of range in Dunedin and Southland and this species is now regarded as being locally extinct in both Dunedin and Invercargill. Ecology and habitat Hudson states that this species could be found on the margins of forests and R. W. Fereday communicated that it was a plain-frequenting species that has an affinity for gorse hedges. Hudson also stated that adult moths were on the wing in December and January.  Host plants  The host plants of this species are unknown. Conservation status This moth is classified under the New Zealand Threat Classification system as being Nationally Critical. It has been hypothesised that this species is under threat as a likely result of habitat loss.

The Tacna Province was a territorial division of Chile that existed between 1884 and 1929, was created on 31 October 1884, on the basis of the provinces of Tacna and Arica of the Tacna Department. It covered from the Sama River to the north, to the Quebrada de Camarones to the south, and from the Andes mountain range to Pacific Ocean. This was under the conditions of Treaty of Anc√≥n, by means of which Chile achieved dominion over the Tarapac√° Department, and possession of the provinces of Tacna and Arica for a decade, after which a plebiscite was to be held to determine the region's sovereignty, however there were some problems to carry out the plebiscite. The provisional legal organization will end up working for 50 years until 1929. In 1885 Chile integrated Tarata to the administration since this country considered that the town was to the east of the Sama river. In 1925 Chile gave back Tarata because Calvin Coolidge, the President of the United States that was in charge of giving a solution to the issue, said that Tarata was in the west of the Sama river. In 1929 the Treaty of Lima was signed, Tacna was given to Peru and Arica to Chile, after the treaty, the Arica Departament was moved to the Tarapac√° Province and the Chilean Tacna Province stopped to exist. Some of the important persons that lived in Tacna during the Chilean administration is Salvador Allende and his family, they lived eight years in the city.

Up to 1910, the school prepared 4,371 podpraporshchiks and junior officers. During World War I, it relocated to Poltava and operated there in 1915‚Äì1918. In total, about 10,500 men graduated from the school, many becoming prominent military leaders and commanders in the post-war Eastern Europe. History The poor preparation of the Russian army became evident during the Crimean War (1853‚Äì1856) and Count Dmitry Milyutin, Minister of War, introduced wide-ranging reforms to modernize the army. He established military districts and each district established a cadet school. Completion of a cadet school became mandatory for recruits and from 1875 for drafted men if they wanted to be promoted to officers. The Vilnius Junker Infantry School was officially established on 29 October 1864 by the command of the Vilnius Military District. The school took over premises of a military hospital. Initially, it was a two-year school that had about 200 junkers (cadets). From 1868, the school had a special section to train Cossack officers. About 35 cadets were organized into a special equestrian platoon. When the section was closed in 1885, the students were sent to cavalry schools in Yelisavetgrad and Novocherkassk. In 1874, the number of cadets increased to 300. Since many applicants had poor knowledge of basic subjects, the school had a preparatory class from 1877 to 1885. In 1881, the school constructed barracks and an Eastern Orthodox church named after Saints Cosmas and Damian. During the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878), the studies were accelerated. In 1901, it became a three-year school. In 1904, the school expanded to 400 students. At the same time, graduates would be promoted to junior officers rather than to podpraporshchiks. In 1912, the school published a booklet on its ten alumni that were awarded the Order of St. George. At the outbreak of World War I, the school introduced a four-month accelerated training course and increased the number of students to 900 cadets. On 15 July 1915, the school was evacuated to Poltava. Officially, the school was liquidated on 2 January 1918. Badges The school had two badges ‚Äì one for cadets and the other for graduates. The cadet badge was established in 1910. The averse depicted coat of arms of Russia (eagle) in a circle of rays on top of the larger silver coat of arms of Lithuania (armed knight) on red enamel. The knight was surrounded by a Russian slogan on blue enamel proclaiming that even if he is alone on the field, Vilnius graduate is a warrior (). The reverse depicted the same Russian eagle on top of rays shooting from a star down to the seven silver stars forming the Big Dipper on blue enamel. The slogan reads Know the true way to nobility and light (). The graduate badge was established in 1915. Depending on available funds, it was either silver of bronze. It is a Greek cross in size. The cross is covered in black and white enamel. The top arm depicts royal monograms of Tsars Alexander II and Nicholas II of Russia. The center depicted the Lithuanian knight under the rays shooting down to the Big Dipper (i.e. a combination of both averse and reserve of the cadet badge). After the February Revolution, the royal monograms were removed and the Big Dipper was replaced by two stars. Both of school mottoes were recorded in the edges of the badge. Notable alumni In 53 years, the school educated 68 classes of about 10,500 officers. About 340 men were awarded the Order of St. George and about 230 were promoted to generals. After World War I, 21 alumni became Ministers of Defense or commanders of the national armies of the newly independent Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland.

The medal was the only one struck for the Kandyan Wars. Background On 16 June 1818, several regiments of British colonial forces were on the road to Badulla: the 19th, 73rd, the 1st and 2nd Ceylon Regiments, and the 7th, 15th and 18th Madras Native Infantry. The column took rest at Passara, and a Lieutenant Wilkinson directed a party of troops to go on ahead to Badulla and rendezvous with an escort party; this scouting party consisted of \\"6 Europeans, 6 Malays and 6 Caffres\\". The party, being unfamiliar with the area, were caught in a Kandyan ambush at a point about from Badulla; the Ceylon Government Gazette of 4 July 1818 describes the events that then unfolded: The General Orders of 7 July 1818 and 3 June 1819 notes the party of ten holding off the attackers for nearly two hours, until relief arrived in the form of a detachment from the 83rd regiment from Badulla. It goes on to promote McLaughlan to the rank of Sergeant, and recommend that the men involved be given some sort of formal distinction or recognition for their actions. The Ceylonese Government struck the medal in 1819, with the total number awarded varying between sources, some stating 45 and others 47 (2 in gold, 45 in silver). By regiment, recipients included 39 men of the 1st and two of the 2nd Ceylon Regiment, together with four men of the 73rd Regiment. Four men were awarded the medals posthumously, having died of fever in the interim: Lance Corporal Richard McLaughlan, Private John Wilson, Private Christopher Sheppard and Private William Connor, all of the 73rd. Design The medal had a diameter of , with the obverse bearing the inscription \\"CEYLON 1818\\" surrounded by a wreath of bay and oak leaves, while the reverse had \\"REWARD OF MERIT\\" around the edge, with the recipient's name engraved in the centre.

His debut in maezum≈ç was in January 2008, and his first makuuchi division honbasho was the Natsu tournament in May 2018. His highest rank has been maegashira 8. He has one special prize for Fighting Spirit. He is a member of Tomozuna stable. Career =Early career= He was originally a judo practitioner, but was strongly encouraged by his father and sponsors from his hometown of Asahikawa to join sumo which he initially rejected. When asked again by his father after he finished high school, he agreed. He was then accepted to ≈åshima stable by ≈åshima-oyakata. He was light entering sumo at 83 kg so to add weight he would eat as much and as often as he could even waking up in the middle of the night for snacks to add on the calories. Because of him being so light his oyakata would tell him to imitate Ama later known as Harumafuji who also was a light wrestler. Early on he disliked sumo citing homesickness and the hard life style, he even ran away in the middle of the night to live with one of his friends to get away from sumo. This didn't last long though as he was talked into going back to the stable in time for the next tournament. He was the star of a French documentary, Tu Seras Sumo, or A Normal Life: Chronicle of a Sumo Wrestler, released in 2013, which covered the first nine months of his sumo career in 2008. In July 2014 he made the sekitori ranks for the first time when he was promoted to the j≈´ry≈ç division, but he was demoted back to makushita after only two tournaments. He returned to j≈´ry≈ç in September 2015. =Makuuchi career= His first makuuchi division honbasho was the Natsu tournament in May 2018 which he debuted at maegashira 15. He was the first top division wrestler from Hokkaid≈ç since the demotion of Kitakachidoki exactly 20 years earlier, in May 1998, and the first Hokkaid≈ç native to win promotion to makuuchi since Tatsuhikari in January 1992. In his debut tournament he went 10‚Äì5 and was awarded the fighting spirit prize for his efforts, this is his first sansh≈ç (special prize). He was promoted to his highest rank to date of maegashira 8 for the July 2018 tournament, where he scored a make-koshi 6‚Äì9. He withdrew from a tournament for the first time in his career in September, after injuring his knees in his Day 3 bout against Daieisho. He returned to the tournament on Day 9, but withdrew again on Day 11 after aggravating the injury. He was demoted to the j≈´ry≈ç division in November 2018 and did not manage to return to makuuchi until almost two years later in September 2020. He withdrew on Day 5 of the September tournament with an Achilles' tendon injury. Fighting style Kyokutaisei is unusual in that he prefers a maemitsu grip on his opponent's mawashi or belt ‚Äì grabbing the front part directly below the stomach area. He is also fond of dashinage techniques, which involve throwing the opponent in a pulling motion. His most common winning kimarite is oshi-dashi, or push out. Personal Kyokutaisei registered his marriage to Yoshie Kobayashi on 18 September 2017. The reception was held on 9 June 2018, about 450 guests attended with Hakuh≈ç giving a speech.

It was founded by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and Online Computer Library Center (OCLC). Access to the articles was lost when the journal closed in 1996 after being sold, but some access was restored in 2018. History Plans by AAAS and OCLC for a digital journal began in 1989 and were announced in 1990. The journal launched on July 1, 1992, edited by Edward Huth, who was earlier the editor of Annals of Internal Medicine. As part of Primary Journals Online, AAAS was responsible for the editorial processes and OCLC for the technology side. Peer review was also done online. One aim of the journal was to reduce the time until publication of medical research. The launch was postponed from April due to technical difficulties, but it already had 1000 subscribers in the month of its launch and won the 1992 Database Product of the Year Award. The first issue published three clinical trials and several opinion pieces. Submissions were lower than anticipated; Cliff McKnight and colleagues noted that \\"Paradoxically, although the system was designed to be accessed directly by readers, it seems to have received a more enthusiastic reception from the information profession than from end users.\\" AAAS sold the journal in 1994 to Chapman & Hall (later part of CRC Press and then Taylor & Francis), who hosted the journal at www.chapmanhall.com/cu.html. Library and information scientist Robin Peek noted in the mid-'90s that \\"Mounting a single journal is particularly problematic because most institutions are not willing to adapt their delivery infrastructure for one, or even a dozen, unique journal titles. Thus, even with the Internet, there remains the problem of achieving the needed mass.\\" By 1996 OJCCT was the second-most cited electronic journal with 190 citations, and while its total citations in 1995 were \\"well below the median medical journal\\", \\"the average article in OJCCT [was] cited more than 88 percent of the e-journals indexed by JCR.\\" As of 1996, OJCCT had published the then most-cited article in any electronic journal, a review of breast cancer screening. =Closure and preservation= Despite the impact of the journal, it closed in 1996 and access was lost as no plans were made for preservation of the content. The former editors, including associate editor Kay Dickersin of Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, had considered putting copies of articles online but \\"we don't want to get into trouble\\". In March 2018, access was finally restored to over 50 of the around 80 articles by the digital preservation service Portico, with the permission of the copyright holder Taylor & Francis, after Dickersin worked with the JHU Sheridan Libraries, including librarian Mariyam Thohira, to organize an effort to find copies of the articles from colleagues and in libraries. The editor, Huth, provided many articles on a CD- ROM. Portico are seeking the missing content, which they hope may be in researchers' personal hardcopy archives. Technical details The journal was accessible with an online subscription, initially costing $110USD per year via CompuServe and OCLC Net, using either GUI software called Guidon that used SGML and ran on DOS on an IBM-compatible computer or the Electronic Publishing Service, a more limited ASCII format also available on the internet. The system requirements were high for the time: an Intel 286 with 2 MB memory running Windows 3.0. By 1995, three more journals were available via Guidon on the Electronic Journals Online platform: The Online Journal of Knowledge Synthesis for Nursing, Electronics Letters Online, and APL Online. The journal was indexed on MEDLINE (and, from January 1994, Index Medicus), BIOSIS and Worldcat. Articles in OJCCT were published within 24 hours after the decision to accept. Access and support was limited to Monday-Friday 6am-10pm (Eastern Daylight Time), Saturday 8am-8pm, Sunday 12pm-8pm. Unlike other electronic journals at the time, the articles included figures and tables as well as typeset text. Downloading articles cost extra and printed copies could also be ordered from the publisher for a fee. Legacy OJCCT was the first online- only full text journal with graphics, and was followed by many other electronic journals, as they were called at the time, which changed how librarians provided content to their users and how publishers priced their content. By 1996, there were 115 electronic STM journals. The journal was the first electronic content to be indexed in Index Medicus. OJCCT introduced what is now called continuous publication, publishing articles as they are accepted rather than in an issue, with no space restrictions. In the first editorial, Huth promoted \\"the virtues of hypertext, the space electronic publishing offers for providing actual study data, and the ability to update meta- analyses\\". The journal was one of the first to have guidelines for the reporting of clinical trials and to encourage the publication of negative results.

Life Kenneth Cross was educated at St Paul's School, London from 1930 to 1935 and then at St Mary's Hospital, London where he won a Moran Scholarship, a Rugby Scholarship, that was established by Lord Moran Charles Wilson, 1st Baron Moran as a way of picking up the best students for medicine. Within 2 years, Cross had passed the membership examination of the College, in 1940. After several junior house appointments at the beginning of World War II, Cross served in the emergency medical service. Although considered combative by nature, Cross was a self confessed pacifist by conviction, and even though he spent time with the Friends' Ambulance Unit in China during World War II, Cross rarely spoke about the work. Cross was married twice. His first wife Joyce Wilson n√©e Lack, was a depressive, who eventually committed suicide in 1970. Cross was also a depressive himself but he usually managed to adapt his depression into high spirits which was evidenced by his colleagues, but this resulted in facing many many long hours of misery and gloom while he was at home. The depression was only made bearable by his second wife, Sheila Cross n√©e Lewis, with whom he had a nurturing and fulfilling marriage. Career After returning from China, Cross abandoned a potential career as a physician, to become a physiologist working in the physiology department at St Mary's Hospital. In 1948, he started to research foetal and neonatal physiology for the ventilation of the newborn baby. He was one of the first to apply physiological techniques, to the problem of resuscitating newborn babies. Through this work he became a leading member of a group of physiologists and paediatricians who founded the Neonatal Society in 1959. Cross's life work became neonatal research. Cross was promoted to the academic rank of reader in 1952. Cross spent a year in America in 1958-1959 at the Cardiovascular Research Institute located in the University of California, San Francisco. Working alongside Julius H. Comroe Jr., Cross helped organize and establish the study into neonatal research that later grew into one of the largest paediatric research groups in America. Upon returning from the US, Cross moved to London Hospital Medical College with a promotion to Professor of Physiology in 1960, a post he held until 1981. In 1963 he became an honorary director of a Medical Research Council group on the respiration and energy metabolism in the newborn. During 1973, he organized the Joseph Barcroft Centenary meeting for The Physiological Society. In 1974 he gave the Bertram Louis Abrahams lecture called Investigating the newborn: the ethical imperative Contributions Cross as an individual, had no time for fools or knaves, and was considered a rather forthright character who didn't value position, but did value and respect people. This was possibly the reason he was passed over for membership of the Royal Society, a position he clearly deserved. Indeed, the physiologist Arthur Huggett later stated, that on his own membership of the society, was in recognition of work carried out by Kenneth Cross. Cross contributions to medical science before 1957, specifically to physiology of the new-born, were so many and so fundamental that it was a surprise that his first proposal for membership to the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, formerly the British Paediatric Association (BPA) was not automatic. Indeed, when his name was put forward for election, dissenting voices stalled the proposal as they saw no reason to include a physiologist. When he was finally elected to the learned society in 1957 on the second proposal for election, Cross wasn't having an easy professional life. Paediatricians were slow to recognize the importance of his work. Both paediatricians and physiologists found it impossible to believe that the type of fundamental research conducted by Cross, could be done on the new-born. Indeed, as Professor Otto Herbert Wolff stated in his speech,when awarding the James Spence Medal to Cross, that Cross was told by his professor St Mary's that now he was turned down by the BPA that it was time he stopped playing with babies and got down to some proper physiology. Cross's approach to physiology was simple. Once practical solutions were developed, they were turned into a process that could be applied to everyday clinical problems. Cross operated with an exceedingly high standard of approach to ethical standards and used this approach to train a large number of high quality research students, many who would later become neonatologist's themselves. Awards On 28 March 1979 Cross was awarded the James Spence Medal, named after Professor Sir James Calvert Spence, and is the highest award of the British Paediatric Association.

The Woolfs In January 1930, Easdale sent what Virginia Woolf called \\"piles of dirty copy books written in a scrawl without any spelling, but I was taken aback to find, as I thought, some real merit... it may be a kind of infantile phosphorescence.... Very odd.\\" The Woolfs nevertheless took up publishing her books, despite opposition from John Lehmann.Edinburgh Scholarship Online Retrieved 1 May 2018.

He had studied at the Royal College of Music, written his first opera at the age of 17, and was assisted by his friend Benjamin Britten. He also introduced his sister to Naomi Mitchison. He went on to write the music for an Oscar-winning film classic, The Red Shoes (1948). Easdale herself later worked in London and published in the periodical The Adelphi. She was married in 1938 to the geneticist James Meadows Rendel, who was related to the Strachey family. Her Amber Innocent (1939) was a verse narrative told in symbols. She bore a first child in 1940. After moving to Australia with her husband, she began to suffer from severe paranoia and returned, leaving her three children, aged 13, 10 and 6, behind. She lived latterly in Nottingham under an assumed name, Sophie or Sophia Curly. There she was intermittently visited by her children and grandchildren.

Early life  Morozova was born on 23 May 1921 to a Russian peasant family in Polyana village within the Kaluga Governorate. She moved in 1936 to Bryansk when her father got a job as manager of a tailor shop. After graduating from eight grades of secondary school she studied to become an accountant. In 1938 she was hired to work as a telephone operator until her job was no longer needed. In November 1939 she worked at a tailor's shop until she began working for the Soviet Air Force. Partisan activities Not long after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 Morozova's home city of Seshcha was taken over by the German military on 9 August. After the Germans took over the airfield where she worked they ousted the 9th Heavy Bomber Aviation Brigade of the Soviet Air Forces from the field and parked an estimated 300 German bombers of the Luftflotte 2 at their new airbase. The German occupiers used the airbase during their bombings of Moscow and other major cities. The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Soviet Union was in desperate need of information about the state of the strategically important airbase that had been taken over by the Luftwaffe. To gain such intelligence for the Red Army, an underground reconnaissance organization was created by resistance members in Bryansk to infiltrate the airbase. Morozova returned to Seshcha to work undercover at the airbase as a laundress, where she ended up meeting several of her friends from school that were unable to leave the city in time. She invited them to join her partisan group; from Spring 1942 to September 1943 they operated as part of the 1st Kletnyanskaya Partisan Brigade, spying in enemy forces, sabotaging and outright destroying Luftwaffe aircraft, and disabling ground equipment. The brigade eventually became an international resistance organization, spanning the Soviet Union, Poland and Czechoslovakia. When the unit got their hands on magnetic landmines they used them to destroy twenty aircraft, six trains, and two ammunition warehouses. The unit transferred information on the specifications of Tiger tanks, identification papers of German soldiers, and medical technology. The information Morozova provided to the Air Force made sure that Soviet bombers attacked the correct airbase where the Germans were stationed instead of a dummy base constructed by the Germans. Later other partisans used the information she gathered to storm the airbase, killing an estimated 200 German airmen and 30 cars. In September 1943 Morozova left the partisan movement and joined the Red Army after Soviet forces retook control of Seshcha in the operation to retake Bryansk. She was awarded the Medal \\"For Courage\\" and the Order of the Red Star by the 10th Army of the Soviet Union for her activities in the partisan movement. After joining the Red Army and graduating from radio operator's courses in July 1944 she was deployed to Poland as part of the 10th Army in Poland, using the pseudonym \\"Swan\\". In late 1944 she was assigned to a Soviet-Polish partisan unit. On 31 December 1944 after she was badly wounded in battle when a bullet shattered her wrist she detonated a grenade on herself in order to avoid capture, ending her life and killing two SS soldiers.  Recognition  Morozova's image was featured on a 1966 postage stamp of the Soviet Union and a postal cover of the Russian Federation.

She became a cause celebre after her husband V. Shankar was hacked to death by killers hired by her family. They were opposed to her, a Thevar, marrying Shankar, a Dalit. Her case, known as Udumalai Shankar murder case became emblematic of the endemic issue of \\"honour killings\\" of intercaste couples as well as the enduring issues of caste violence in Tamil Nadu. On 9 December 2018, she wedded Mr. Sakthi in Coimbatore.https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil- nadu/2018/dec/09/anti-caste-crusader-kausalya-done-self-respect-marriage-with- folk-artist-sakthi-1909173.html Her decision to get remarried was received well with wishes pouring in from many sections.  Biography  Kausalya was born to P. Chinnasamy, an auto driver and financier, and Annalakshmi, a house wife in Kuppamapalayam village, Dindigul district in southern Tamil Nadu. She has a younger brother Gowtham. In 2007, the family moved to Palani when Kausalya was studying 6th standard. According to her brother, she was a good student, getting over 1000 marks in her 12th board exams, and was \\"allowed\\" to go to PA Engineering College in Pollachi in 2014. On the first day, she was met by Shankar, who proposed to her on their second day. Shankar came from an economically backward family, his father was a daily-wager. At first she turned him down, but later developed a strong friendship over the next 6 months that blossomed into romance. However, she was seen by relatives with Shankar, who told her parents. However, once they found out Shankar was a member of the Dalit Pallar community, who have clashed with Thevars before, they fought with Kausalya about her relationship with him. After this fight, Kausalya decided to marry Shankar and drop out of college in March 2015. She moved to Shankar's village. A month after their marriage, Chinnasamy tried to forcibly separate the couple. He lied that Kausalya's grandfather was ill, and instead abducted her and took her to Dindigul. This plot was foiled when Shankar filed a Missing Person's complaint. Afterwards, the family tried to bribe Shankar with 10 lakhs to end the marriage, but he refused. Afterwards, Chinnasamy decided to kill the couple by hiring killers. On 12 March 2016, Shankar and Kausalya left their hut and went to buy a new shirt for Shankar in Udumalaipettai. As they were returning from a clothing shop, they both were about to cross the road to the bus stop. At that moment, 6 killers hired by Chinnasamy arrived on 2 motorbikes. In front of a large crowd, they attacked the couple, slashing them with long knives. After 36 seconds, they fled on the bikes. Shankar struggled to run away, while Kausalya was attacked again until she got under a car. An ambulance took the two to the hospital. Kausalya held her husband in her arms and he stopped breathing as they passed the hospital gate. Shankar had 34 cuts on him. After the killing, she remained in hospital for 20 days. She told police her father was responsible. The case gained substantial media attention, and a trial was soon launched. In the prosecution of the killers, including her father, Kausalya was the main witness. She later gained a government job, but later lost it. After the killings, she struggled a lot with depression and even attempted suicide. However, during the case, she testified against her entire family and wished them all convicted for their crime. She testified that her mother repeatedly said she would kill her and she was better off dead than married to Shankar. She also became an anti- caste and Dalit's rights activist, following the ideologies of Ambedkar and Periyar. All accused except for Annalakshmi and two others were convicted of the crime. Chinnasamy and 4 others were given death sentences, while 2 of the accused were given life. Kausalya has continued to work against caste, visiting other victims of caste violence and \\"honour\\" killings throughout the South and fighting for Dalit rights and the annnihilation of caste. She also teaches underprivileged children at a school in Shankar's village. On 9 December 2018, she wedded Sakthi in Coimbatore. Sakthi belongs to the same community as Kausalya. She has also visited victims of other \\"honour\\" killings like Divya, whose elopement with Ilavarasan (a Dalit) sparked the Dharmapuri riots of 2012, and Amrutha, whose husband Pranay was also killed by her parents in an \\"honour\\" killing. She continues to fight for a separate law against \\"honour\\" killings. In Popular Culture The honour killing of Kausalya's first husband, Shankar, was the subject of two plays ‚Äî Koumarane Valavane's Chandala: Impure and Sharmistha Saha's Romeo Ravidas and Juliet Devi. Their life was roughly depicted in the Tamil movie Magalir Mattum.

Its development was abandoned after early tests revealed incurable engine-mounting vibration problems. Development Until the mid-1930s the Polish government had supported amateur aeronautical activity. The end of this support forced designers to consider low cost powered gliders and other small, low powered, structurally simple aircraft. The AMA, a powered glider designed by Andrzej Anczutin, Henryk Malinowski and Ro≈õcislaw Aleksandrowicz from the Warsaw Technical University, was one of many such designs. Its first flight, made in August 1935 and piloted by Szczepan Grzeszczyk, was as a glider, towed by an RWD 8. It was first flown under its own power by Aleksander Onoszko on 13 September 1935. Over the next two days it was flown by Kazimierz Chorzewski in displays celebrating the start of the Warsaw-based 23rd Gordon-Bennett Championships. These flights revealed two significant problems: stability and engine vibration. The former was reduced by empennage modifications but the latter proved incurable. Development was abandoned after only six powered flights. Design The AMA was a high wing monoplane with a wooden structure. Its wing was in three parts, a short, partly metal skinned centre section and two outer panels of constant chord and thickness out to rounded, thinned tips. The outer panels were built around a single box spar with a ply-covered D-box ahead forming the leading edge. Elsewhere the wing was fabric covered. Ailerons reached to the wing tips. The wing was supported centrally on a streamlined pylon and braced on each side with a single, streamlined steel strut between spar and lower fuselage longeron. Its Poinsard air-cooled flat twin engine was mounted in pusher configuration over the wing above the central pylon, an arrangement used earlier on the BAC Planette. The fuselage of the AMA was rectangular in section, cross-braced with wire and fabric covered, with a single-seat, open cockpit immediately ahead of the wing pylon. The fixed empennage surfaces were covered with ply and the control surfaces with fabric. Together, the tall fin and rudder had a blunted triangular profile. The AMA's low, divided-type undercarriage placed the fuselage underside close to the ground, with each wheel on a V-strut hinged on the lower fuselage longeron and a bracing strut to the upper fuselage. These struts were rigid and the AMA relied on Dunlop low-pressure tyres to absorb landing shocks.

He played college basketball for Butler. At O'Fallon Township High School, he led the team to the semifinals of Illinois' 2010 Class 4A state tournament. He was a three-star recruit ranked in the 2011 Rivals.com 150 and committed to playing for Butler. As a sophomore at Butler, Jones made a buzzer beating shot to defeat Gonzaga and averaged 10.1. points per game. He missed the following season after tearing ligaments in his left wrist during a preseason trip to Australia. As a redshirt junior, Jones averaged 12.7 points per game and was named to the Second-team All-Big East. He repeated on the Second Team All-Big East as a senior, averaged 13.8 points per game, and had a rare triple double in a February 6, 2016 win over St. John's. After his senior season, Jones was drafted by the Canton Charge of the NBA G League and had 20 rebounds in a game, the fifth most in D-League history. He announced his retirement from competitive basketball in August 2017 but returned to the game in January 2018. Early life Jones was born and raised in East St. Louis, Illinois, the son of Robert Jones Jr. and Vickie (Jones) Franklin. He has two older siblings, Robert Jones III and Tonia (Jones) Wiggins, and his brother and father are Baptist ministers. He moved to O'Fallon, Illinois as a child, and grew up playing a number of sports, including tennis and football. \\"Roosevelt was probably the clumsiest child that we had because he was very, very awkward,‚Äù his father said. ‚ÄúBut when a basketball entered his hands, that all changed.‚Äù Jones developed his unorthodox playing style after his father enrolled him in a church league as a child and he could not get his shot off against older players. In eighth grade, he broke his wrist, permanently affecting his shot. Jones attended O'Fallon Township High School, where he was coached by Rick Gibson. He took to weightlifting to fill out his \\"pencil-thin\\" frame and was the sophomore leader on a 14‚Äì15 team. As a junior he led O'Fallon to the semifinals of Illinois' 2010 Class 4A state tournament. Jones had 22 points and 19 rebounds in that game, a 48‚Äì42 loss to Simeon Career Academy which featured Jabari Parker. He averaged 19.3 points and 12.1 rebounds per game that year. In his senior season, Jones averaged 17.2 points, 10.4 rebounds, 4.5 assists, 2.9 steals and 1.1 blocked shots per game. He led O'Fallon to a 20‚Äì7 record and a win in the Southwestern Conference championship while being named to the All-Metro First Team. He was a three-star recruit ranked in the 2011 Rivals 150 and the 33rd best freshman small forward in his class. Assistant coach Terry Johnson recruited Jones to Butler, but he did not notice Jones's poor shooting style due to his athleticism. He received recruiting interest from Purdue, Iowa, Oklahoma State and Kansas, but stuck with Butler. } College career In a win against Milwaukee on March 2, 2012, Jones tallied a season-high 17 points as well as 10 rebounds. Jones averaged 7.8 points and a team-high 6.0 rebounds per game as a freshman. He was named to the Horizon League all-newcomer team. He had a memorable game on January 3, 2013, scoring a season-high 24 points in Butler's eighth straight win over Penn. On January 22, he was named Oscar Robertson National Player of the Week after contributing 20 points, five rebounds, four assists, one block and one steal in a 64‚Äì63 upset over No. 8 Gonzaga for College GameDay in a game in which leading scorer Rotnei Clarke was sidelined. Jones stole the ball at midcourt with ten seconds to go and hit a ten foot floater at the buzzer for the win. Jones was named to the Atlantic 10 All-Defensive Team as a sophomore. He averaged 10.1 points and 5.6 rebounds per game and led the team in assists, with 3.5 per game on a 27‚Äì9 team. On August 16, it was announced that Jones tore ligaments in his left wrist during a preseason trip to Australia and needed to undergo surgery that would force him to miss the entire season. He travelled with the team most of the year but missed the conference tournament as his Butler teammates struggled to a 14‚Äì17 season. In June, he was medically cleared to practice again. Coming into his redshirt junior year, Jones was a preseason All-Big East Honorable Mention. On January 17, 2015, Jones scored a career-high 28 points in a 61‚Äì59 loss to Georgetown. He had 18 points, grabbed six rebounds and added six assists in a 58‚Äì56 win over Creighton on February 16, and hit the game-winning layup with 1.9 seconds remaining. Jones had 23 points in Butler's 67‚Äì64 loss to Notre Dame in the NCAA Tournament despite playing with a strained knee. As a junior, he averaged 12.7 points, 5.2 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game. He was named to the All-Big East Second Team. Jones became known for his defense and his passing vision and rarely shooting outside . Jones playing against Texas Tech in the 2016 NCAA Tournament Jones was a preseason All-Big East First Team selection as a senior. He earned a spot on the Puerto Rico Tip-Off All- Tournament Team. On December 2, he hit a last-second shot to defeat 17th ranked Cincinnati after teammate Kellen Dunham led a second-half comeback.

His 1,533 career points is twelfth highest in Butler history. Jones earned a bachelor of arts degrees in both strategic communications and digital media production. Professional career Jones was selected by the Canton Charge 16th overall in the 2016 NBA D-League Draft. He did not play very much to start his professional career due to a back strain and a minor leg injury, as well as the faster game. By December, Jones began logging more minutes, and had a 21-point, 13-rebound performance on January 11 against the Santa Cruz Warriors. He scored 15 points and grabbed 20 rebounds, fifth most in D-League history, in a 114‚Äì107 loss to Grand Rapids Drive on February 2.

However, in August 2017 he announced his retirement from basketball due to \\"unbearable\\" back pain. On November 6, Jones was charged with drunken driving and resisting arrest as his blood alcohol level was measured at .185. He was found asleep behind the wheel of an automobile in O'Fallon, Illinois and taken into police custody. Jones came out of retirement in January 2018 and rejoined the Charge. Jones missed a game against the Erie BayHawks due to an undisclosed injury in February. He averaged 4.3 points and 7.6 rebounds per game in his second season. Coaching career On July 19, 2018, Jones was named an assistant coach at Indiana University Kokomo, a NAIA institution. His roles include recruiting coordinator and director of player development initiatives, while contributing to on-court coaching and scouting. Head coach Eric Echelbarger said that Jones \\"has an unbelievable passion for teaching the game, and his Indianapolis-area connections will be a great asset in our recruiting efforts.\\" In his first season, Jones helped the team to a 26-8 record and a berth in the NAIA Division II Sweet 16. Following the season he was promoted to associate head coach, with an emphasis on teaching defense. In the 2019‚Äì20 season, Jones helped the Cougars achieve a 27-7 record and reach the Sweet 16 of the NAIA Tournament before the season was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The church and the green on which it sits are local landmarks, and are considered of special historic interest by the London Borough of Hounslow. History Christ Church was commissioned in 1841 to serve the growing population of the suburb of Turnham Green who found it inconvenient to walk to St Nicholas Church by the River Thames. The building cost ¬£6,900; the Church Building Commissioners contributed ¬£500 under the Church Building Act 1818, and therefore Christ Church is deemed a Commissioners' church. A re-ordering took place in the early 1990s, during which the pews were removed and replaced with discrete chairs, and the floor concreted and carpeted. In 2000 the west bays were converted, under the supervision of architect Ian Goldsmith, into two-storey community rooms. Architecture The church was designed in the Gothic revival style by Sir George Gilbert Scott and his partner William Moffatt; construction was completed in 1843. In 1887 the chancel was extended and given the current square eastern end under architect James Brooks. The design of Christ Church was praised in the 1841 edition of the journal The Ecclesiologist, which stated that the tower and spire were \\"peculiarly excellent, and worthy of any ancient architect\\". Daughter church St Alban's Church, Acton Green (St Alban the Martyr), on the green at the northern edge of Chiswick, which had fallen into disuse, was restored and rededicated in 2016, and now forms part of the Christ Church ministry.

He was stationed at West Point, New York from 1908‚Äì1912, where he excelled in both cricket and American football. =Playing career= Banks was spotted playing as a quarterback in New York by a one-time member of Hunslet's management committee, and the club bought him out of the army and brought him to the UK, apparently partly because the club thought an exotic player would boost revenue. The strategy seems to have worked, as 'his presence significantly swelled the attendance at his first game'. Local news reporting on Banks's first game in England included some prominent racist coverage, with a local evening paper running the headline 'Hunslet's Coloured Coon' and the Yorkshire Post suggesting that local players should have been hired instead and commenting that \\"if the club wanted to sign 'coloured' players they should go to South Africa, where there are reputed to be capable goal kickers with bare feet\\". Banks's performance seems to have been fairly successful: playing on the wing, he scored four tries during his first four games for the club, the first of which was on 27 January 1912, against York. He later moved to playing as , before returning to America following his last game with the club, on 26 December 1912.

In an interview for Italian Osservatorio Balcani e Caucaso Transeuropa he explain his motivation to run as a non-party candidate on SDSS list by \\"desire to influence European politics\\" particularly related to Western Balkan integrations, academic duty to take active part in political life and to \\"express my solidarity with the Serbian community, not so much because of ethnicity, but because I think that the Serbian community is a trait of Croatia as a country\\".

Gibbs' book was therefore considered controversial by British historian Marko Hoare for allegedly denying the genocide in Srebrenica and for other controversial views.Marko Attila Hoare, Genocide, Justice and denial, Centre for Advanced Studies, Sarajevo, 2017; pp. 21-32, pp. 247, pp. 59 Joviƒá was thus, due to his positive review of the book, accused by the North American Congress Of Bosniaks of \\"silently denying Serbian aggression and genocide\\".https://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/kongres- bosnjaka-proziva-josipoviceva-savjetnika-dejana-jovica-916016 Hoare previously criticized his book \\"Slobodan Milosevic‚Äôs place in Serbian History\\", accusing Joviƒá of being an apologist of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá and the JNA during the war in the 1990s.https://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/savjetnik-predsjednika- josipovica-podrzava-teze-iz-velikosrpskog-pamfleta-918181European History Quarterly guest edited by Dejan Djokic, vol. 36, no. 3, July 2006, pp. 445-462. Former professor at Yale University, Ivo Banac described Joviƒá as an \\"ordinary falsifier of history\\".https://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/hrvatsko- proljece-drzao-je-manjinskom-manifestacijom-925792 Joviƒá responded by stating that the accusations are \\"completely tendentious and incorrect, and the campaign itself has political rather than academic motives\\", he also defended Gibbs by claiming he had never denied genocide in Srebrenica, that he is a distinguished professor of history at the University of Arizona whose book had a number of positive reviews in academic journals, and that the same people who are now accusing him as a genocide denier for a book review have previously accused many, including the Washington Times and The Guardian that they are genocide deniers. His claims were, however, disputed by Hoare in a subsequent response to his response which stated \\"It is dangerous to both Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina for someone holding such views, and with such poor analytical judgement and grasp of reality, to occupy the position that he does.\\".https://www.tacno.net/novosti/hoare-jovic-i-gibbs-nastoje- minimalizirati-krivnju-srpskih-agresora-za-rat-1990-i-prebaciti-krivnju-sto- vise-na-hrvatske-i-bosnjacke-zrtve-rata/ During the same year, he was sacked by president Ivo Josipoviƒá after Joviƒá claimed in his article that 1991 Croatian independence referendum was \\"very non-liberal. Maybe they were ‚Äòdemocratic‚Äô if by ‚Äòdemocracy‚Äô we mean only the determination of those who have more and who less [votes]. But they were certainly not liberal\\" and that it can not be compared with Scottish independence referendum arguing that, unlike the Croatian one, every opinion was considered legitimate and was equally present in public debate. This statement was described by president Josipoviƒá as \\"malicious and false\\".https://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/josipovic- smijenio-svog-savjetnika-dejana-jovica-964717 President sacked him shortly before 2014‚Äì15 Croatian presidential election while politicians from major opposition right-wing Croatian Democratic Union expressed opinion that he was sacked because his opinions were damaging Josipoviƒá's reelection prospects. The left-leaning British political website openDemocracy opined that sacking of Joviƒá was the result of \\"(re)establishment of a certain dogmatism in interpreting or discussing about the past\\". Balkan Insight described Joviƒá's statements as \\"highly controversial\\" and politicians from both SDP and HDZ criticized Joviƒá, while 24sata columnist Tomislav Klau≈°ki criticised Josipoviƒá‚Äôs move instead and asked if it is possible to comment meaningfully and non-passionately the independence referendum 23 years after it took place .

Description Hudson described the species as follows: Distribution O. pseudostinaria is endemic to New Zealand. Hudson first collected the species at Otira. The moth was subsequently also found to be present at Gouland Downs near Nelson as well as in the Nelson district, Mount Grey and White Rock in Canterbury. Plant hosts The plant host of O. pseudostinaria is unknown. Given the rarity of the moth species it has been hypothesized that the host plant is also uncommon. Conservation status In 1928 Hudson regarded this species as being very rare and this moth is now classified under the New Zealand Threat Classification system as being Nationally Critical.

He sought to develop gene therapies to make inexpensive treatments available for incurable conditions such as AIDS and the herpes simplex virus. His lack of any medical training and his unconventional methods‚Äîsuch as broadcasting an associate injecting himself with an ‚Äúuntested experimental gene therapy‚Äù, then later doing the same to himself in an onstage public demonstration‚Äîdrew widespread criticism.  Education  Aaron Traywick was a resident of Elmore, Alabama, and a graduate of Stanhope Elmore High School. He graduated from the University of Montevallo in Alabama with a degree in interdisciplinary studies; he held no background in the sciences or formal training in clinical medicine.  Career  From January 2016 to his termination in July 2016, he worked to advocate investment in radical approaches towards anti-aging at the Global Healthspan Policy Institute started by his cousin.Jan. 25, 2015: New Thinktank to Promote Research, Innovation for Treatment of Underlying Causes of Aging-Related Diseasehttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/19/style/biohacker-death-aaron- traywick.html In 2017 he founded Ascendance Biomedical in Washington, D.C. with the mission to ‚Äúmake cutting edge biomedical technologies available for everyone‚Äù. Traywick's self-administered do it yourself homemade gene therapies received substantial media attention. In October 2017, Ascendance Biomedical shared a live broadcast of Traywick's associate Tristan Roberts injecting himself with an ‚Äúuntested experimental gene therapy‚Äù for HIV over Facebook's live-streaming service. During a presentation at the February 2018 BodyHacking Con in Austin, Texas, Traywick injected himself with something he referred to at the time as a ‚Äúresearch compound‚Äù. In a later conversation with BBC reporters, he spoke of it as a ‚Äútreatment‚Äù for Herpes virus, a term with a specific meaning subject to FDA regulations. Shortly after the event, the FDA issued a statement on the inherent dangers of this approach to untested gene editing, without mentioning the company by name: At the time of his death, Traywick was planning a CRISPR gene therapy trial for the treatment of lung cancer in Tijuana, Mexico, and served as managing director for Inovium Rejuvenation, which was conducting pre-enrollment for FDA-approved trials in several US locations to reverse menopause, rejuvenate ovaries, restore fertility, and bring hormone levels back in line with those found in youth. He was featured as a subject in an as-yet unreleased documentary film directed by Ford Fischer: Transhuman: Biohackers and Immortalists.. He is also a subject in the limited Netflix series \\"Unnatural Selection.\\"  Death  Traywick was found unconscious in a sensory deprivation isolation tank, or ‚Äúfloat pod‚Äù, at a float spa on April 29, 2018. A spa spokesperson informed reporters that the spa's co-owner arrived twenty minutes after Traywick's float session was scheduled to end, and asked why someone was still in the float room. The door was closed although unlocked. The room was dark, though its automatic lights should have been activated when the tank's lid was opened. Traywick was discovered in the tank, which had automatically drained by that point. Emergency responders arrived within four minutes of the spa's 911 call. Traywick's body was taken to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner for an autopsy. A spokesperson for the spa told reporters that police twice told her they found drug paraphernalia among Traywick's belongings; Police did not confirm this point. Toxicology reports were said to be expected six to ten weeks following autopsy. An autopsy report provided to Bloomberg News on June 28 by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner showed that he accidentally drowned with the drug ketamine in his system. Ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic, is sometimes used as a recreational drug. The U.S. Transhumanist Party issued an official statement about his death, saying it was, as far as they were aware, a \\"tragic accident\\". Traywick was 28 years old.

The strike ended on May 12, 2018 with an agreement between the teachers' union and school officials for a 2 percent pay raise. The strike was part of the larger wave of teachers' strikes in the United States where protests occurred in West Virginia, Oklahoma and Arizona. Background =State of public education in Colorado= The Colorado Education Association says that teacher salaries after inflation have dropped 17 percent in the last 15 years, and that the state has underfunded education by $6.6 billion since 2009 by failing to implement a constitutional amendment that requires education funding to grow on pace with inflation. =Pension costs= One of the largest reasons for decreasing teacher pay and less funding for schools is the large amount of money diverted from current budgets to pay educators' unfunded pension liabilities. For example: \\"In Colorado, school district payments to the public pension fund have roughly doubled since 2006, from about 10 percent of payroll to 20 percent.\\" A 2016 study found that only 30% of the money that school districts pay towards the retirement benefits of an educator actually go toward that educator's pension, with 70% being used to pay off unfunded debt in that pension system. \\"The disparity is about twice as stark in Colorado. Just $3 of every $20 spent per teacher goes to their retirement, according to an analysis by the state retirement system.\\" Strike The strike began on Friday, April 27. On that day, 10 school districts were closed in the state due to the strike. The topic of educational funding in various states within the United States has become a controversial subject. In early 2018, teachers in the states of Arizona, Colorado, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and West Virginia conducted strikes. In Colorado, the strikes occurred because of low teacher salaries and insignificant benefits. Colorado teachers were represented by the Colorado Education Association (CEA) and were opposed by officials of state government. The CEA demanded a two percent salary increase and a significant favorable adjustment to the Colorado Public Employees‚Äô Retirement Association (PERA). In response, on April 20th, 2018, Colorado Senator Bob Gardner and Representative Paul Lundeen introduced Senate Bill 18-264. Gardner and Lundeen intended to discourage teachers from conducting protests. ‚ÄúThe bill prohibits public school teachers and teacher organizations from directly or indirectly inducing, instigating, encouraging, authorizing, ratifying, or participating in a strike against any public-school employer‚Äù (SB18-264, n.d.). SB18-264. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb18-264 However, Senate Bill 18-264 was heavily criticized and was dismissed. Despite the threat of the bill, Colorado teachers began to strike on April 27th, 2018 and continued to do so until May 12th, 2018. Ultimately, the state government of Colorado agreed to give teachers a two percent salary increase. Reactions from state officials Two Republican state senators, Bob Gardner and Paul Lundeen responded by proposing a bill that would fine teachers $5,000 per day for striking and send to teachers to jail for six months for striking. The bill was met with harsh criticism and was killed in subcommittee on April 30, although Gardner indicated he would consider reintroducing the bill in 2019 should there be a strike. On April 30, Democratic governor, John Hickenlooper signed a $28.9 billion budget into law. In the law, $225 million was allocated to the state pension, and increased K-12 education funding by $150 million annually. Additionally, public colleges and universities would receive a 9 percent increase in state funding aimed at limiting increases in tuition rates.

West Virginia is one of the leading coal mining states in the USA and the environmental debate has never been stronger. There have been battles fought and protest marches to raise awareness for environmental impacts of coal mining. The US government took action and put in place guidelines and restrictions for mining as well as laws to protect the land after mining is completed. This was done with the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. The impact of this act on the reclaimed land and its uses have made a positive impact, nowhere more so than in West Virginia. Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) was approved on August 3, 1977. This Act established guidelines for the regulation of surface mining and the reclamation of the mine sites. This is enforced under the administration of the Office of Surface Mining, Reclamation and Enforcement, in the Department of the Interior. The law establishes minimum requirements uniform for all surface coal mining on Federal and State lands, including exploration activities and the surface effects of underground mining. Mine operators are required to minimize disturbances and the adverse impact on fish, wildlife and related environmental elements and maintain the integrity of such resources when possible. Restoration of land and water resources is a priority in reclamation planning. Uses for reclaimed land There are multiple ways that reclaimed land can be used. One of the main goals of SMCRA is to restore the land as close to its original state, or better, and use it for the good of the environment. Some popular ways this reclaimed land is used include: range land, prime farmland, wildlife refuges, wetlands, recreation areas, and military training outposts. In the U.S. there has been approximately 2.6 million acres of land reclaimed over the past 35 years. This also accounts for land mined before SMCRA was enacted and contributed nearly $10 billion dollars. Lavender growing in reclaimed mining site on Taylor Morgan Mining site in West Virginia Reclaimed Land in West Virginia In West Virginia, the main uses for reclaimed mining sites are recreational, farming, and military training. One such farming use is the growing of lavender. There are many different types of lavender but surprisingly, they all thrive in the dry rocky soil that surface mining leaves behind. The Green Mining Project has taken full advantage of this and has planned for many lavender fields on reclaimed sites in WV, such as Prichard mining sites, including the Taylor Morgan Mine. Another reclamation project in West Virginia is in Mingo County. Nathan Hall, President of Reclaim Appalachia spoke at Tamarack on plans to develop a commercial agroforestry site next to Buck Harless Wood Products. This site is in Holden and would be used for growing and harvesting produce native to West Virginia such as blackberries, hazelnuts, lavender, and paw paws. This site would also be used to farm animals such as hogs, goats, chickens, and honeybees and they would be used for \\"rotational grazing techniques\\" for optimal harvesting. Hall says ‚ÄúYou have the animals in between the orchard growth keeping the areas maintained,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs benefiting the roots and the trees. You‚Äôre also able to sell the meat and eggs while harvesting fruit and berries.‚Äù Reclamation just for usable water is also taking place on West Virginia Mine sites. The West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection has started water reclamation on at least 2 sites, Carson One Mining and Cheyenne Sales Company. The Carson One Mining site cost $2.7 million and the Cheyenne Sales Company site cost $2.1 million to fund. These are ongoing and require continuous testing of the water but long term investments could well exceed the cost of the initial reclamation. The Green Mining Project Andrew Jordan, operator of the Prichard Mining company, explained that the lavender planted on their Taylor Morgan mining site was planted, in part by students from West Virginia State University. They have partnered with the Green Mining Project to make these mining sites profitable and beautiful again for the state of West Virginia. In order to sell to large commercial companies, these sites must produce at least 2,000 gallons of lavender oil. According to an interview with Mr. Jordan, Johnson & Johnson it indeed one of the buyers of the lavender oil produced from their site. Pictured are Andrew Jordan (on left) with one of his mine employees. Picture taken by Amie Moss, WVSU The coordinators with the Green Mining Program say they‚Äôre applying for another federal grant to help them transition to a co-op model. If they succeed, the lavender farmers would be the owners of the entire business and operation within three years. This movement will not only prove profitable for the state of West Virginia, but also to the citizens of the state as well as the country.

History  ‚ÄúGroup 33‚Äù was founded on the same day Nazis began burning books en masse, 10 May 1933. It was formed by 15 artists out of a shared political ideology in conjunction with a growing resistance to Nazi influence in the border town of Basel. The members also opposed the dominance of older conservative artists who controlled the Society of Swiss Painters, Sculptors, and Architects (German: Gesellschaft Schweizerischer Maler, Bildhauer und Architekten, or GSMBA). The collective was mostly made up of artists and architects from many different disciplines, but also included poets, musicians, actors, and writers. Their work was varied in expression as well as medium, incorporating avant-garde, surrealism, constructivism, and New Objectivity. Over the course of several decades, 38 artists came to be associated with Gruppe 33. It continued to serve as a network emerging expressions and artistic movements. The group was officially dissolved in 1970. In 1983, a retrospective of the group‚Äôs work was held at the Kunsthalle Basel.

It has a rosette of dull green leaves on side growth at its base and up to fifteen pale green, insect-like flowers with reddish to brownish glands on its labellum. Description Arthrochilus sabulosus is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herb with an underground tuber that produces daughter tubers on the end of root-like stolons. It has a rosette of between two and three egg-shaped to lance-shaped leaves on side growth at the base of the flowering stem, each leaf long and wide. Between three and fifteen pale green, insect-like flowers long are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is linear but tapered, long, about wide and partly wrapped around the base of the column. The lateral sepals are lance-shaped but curved, long and about wide. The petals are also linear and curved, long and about wide. The lateral sepals and petals are turned back against the ovary. The labellum is green with a dark purplish blotch at its base, about long and wide on a short stalk or \\"claw\\". There is an insect-like callus about long with reddish brown, hair-like glands in a central band. The tip of the callus is about wide and brownish with shiny black glands. The column is about , curved, light green with a few purplish spots and has two pairs of curved wings. Flowering occurs from November to July. Taxonomy and naming Arthrochilus sabulosus was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen collected on Horn Island. The description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (sabulosus) is a Latin word meaning \\"full of sand\\" or \\"sandy\\", referring to the sandy places where this orchid tends to grow. Distribution and habitat The spotted elbow orchid grows in sand dunes with scrub vegetation. It is found on the northern part of the Cape York Peninsula and on Horn Island in the Torres Strait. Ecology As with other Arthrochilus orchids, A. sabulosus is pollinated by male thynnid wasps of the genus Arthrothynnus although the species involved is not known. It also reproduces asexually by producing new tubers.

His research interests and areas of expertise include inorganic geochemistry, igneous petrology, metamorphic petrology, volcanology, and chemical oceanography. Arculus graduated with a first-class degree in Geology from Durham University in 1970. He then earned a PhD from the same institution in 1973. Following his time at Durham he was a post-doctoral fellow of the Carnegie Institution for Science. Career Through the 70s, 80s, and early 90s he held academic positions in the United States at Rice University and the University of Michigan, before moving to Australia to work at the University of New England. Arculus joined ANU as a full professor in 1994. He successfully campaigned for Australia to join the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program and subsequently participated in a number of research voyages on board the RV Franklin and RV Southern Surveyor. He returned to Durham in October 2009, where he was a fellow at the Institute of Advanced Study through December. In 2017 he argued that volcanic eruptions could take place in Melbourne or Auckland and suggested that volcanic eruptions may have contributed to the outbreak of war in ancient Egypt.

Early life Born Mable Daisy Shrock on February 3, 1905, in Van Vleck, Texas, a small town in Matagorda County, near the Gulf of Mexico. She attended a boarding school in Conroe, Texas where she organized the students to create a student government, which, once established, Howard became the first student body president of. Mable was politically active throughout her life. BART Lawsuit In the 1960s, Mable fought against a proposed above-ground BART rail system that was to divide her community. She helped preserve the undivided quality of life in South Berkeley by spearheading an effort to underground the line that would have divided and degraded the neighborhood. Howard filed a lawsuit, and eventually BART agreed to move the line underground. In her honor, a subsidized rental complex for seniors was named the Mable Howard Apartments, located on Alcatraz Avenue. Life In 1921, Mable Shrock married Rolly Howard and shortly thereafter moved to Galveston, Texas where he worked as a longshoreman by day, and with her in their antique shop by night, while they raised nine children. Rolly & Mable moved to the Bay Area during World War Two to work for Bethlehem Steel at the Alameda Works Shipyard. Mable worked as a ship painter and Rolly continued his work as a longshoreman. She was the first black woman admitted to the Painter's Union. After gaining admittance, Howard assisted in getting other women into the union. Her union work earned her the respect and friendship of labor leader Harry Bridges. Furthermore, through her union activity, Mable maintained a working relationship with the ILWU for over 30 years. In 1947, Mable and Rolly moved their family, now with ten kids, to South Berkeley, Berkeley, California, a mixed neighborhood. Mable Howard was called Mama Howard in part because she politically nurtured many prominent civic leaders. Her home became an open meeting place for the socially active and politically inclined in the area. She continued with her social and community activities her entire life and believed she could save the world. Mable is quoted as saying: \\"If I could put my arms around the whole world I would!\\" In 1978, at the age of 73, Mable received an honorary degree, a Doctor of Humane Letters, from the Center for Urban Black Studies. In 2018, Mable and her daughter Mildred Howard were the focus of a 26-minute documentary titled: Welcome to the Neighborhood, that examined the conditions surrounding an African-American family facing gentrification and a housing crisis that threatens South Berkeley's diversity. There are currently multiple civic efforts working towards honoring Mable's contributions to the community. A petition on Change.org aims to rename the Ashby BART Station to the Mable Howard Station. Additionally, the Lorin Business Association aims to \\"establish a public plaza to honor Mable Howard which will create a center of community connection.\\" Furthermore, the Berkeley Historical Plaque Project is currently fundraising for a plaque honoring Mama Howard.

History Advertisement card for Blankensteiners efterf√∏lgers s√∏kort og navigationshandel The property was built in 1788 by Andreas Hallander. The writer and stage director H. P. Holst (1811-1893) lived in an apartment facing Esplanaden from 1838 to 1841. Blankensteiners efterf√∏lgers s√∏kort og navigationshandel, a store that specialized in nautical charts, books and equipment, was for many years based in the ground floor. It was founded by 1Johan Georg Blankensteiner (f. 1753, in 1797 and later taken over by C. A. Blankensteiner in 1844. He sold it to August Busck (born 1836) in 1858. Buck sold it tocaptain J. W. A. Jensen in 1903. It was acquired by Christian B√∏nnelycke (born 1891) in 1937 and existed at least until the 1950s. The shipping company D/S Norden was from 1782 headquartered in the building. The company expanded its premises several times over the years before relocating to TuborgHavn in Hellerup in 2006. Architecture Churchill Park The building seen from the corner The building consists of three floors over a high cellar. The main facade on Amaliegade is seven bays long. It has rustication on the ground floor and Ionic order pilasters between the windows on the two upper floors. The three central bays are tipped by a triangular pediment with a relief of a seated woman holding a Monocular. The putto by her side was supposedly moulded by Bertel Thorvaldsen according to a drawing by Nicolaus Wolff (1762-1813). A gatein the left hand side of the building opens to a central courtyard. The facade on Esplanaden is also seven bays long but without decorative elements. The two facades are joined by a canted corner bay. Today Axcel-founder Christian Frigast, Danske Bank-chairman Ole Andersen, former Nordea-CEO Christian Clausen and M√¶rsk-chairman Jim Hagemann Snabe created an office community in the building in 2006. =Restaurant= Restaurant Gr√∏nbech og Churchill opened in the basement of the building with Rasmus Gr√∏nbech as head chef in March 2011 and received a star in the Michelin Guide in 2012. It kept its star until its closure in October 2016. Restaurant Esplanaden 48, a lunch restaurant, is now based in the basement.

A career officer of the People's Liberation Army with the rank of colonel, he was sent to the Ministry of Foreign Trade to restore order after the chaos of the early Cultural Revolution, and served as Minister of Foreign Trade from July 1970 to October 1973. He visited dozens of countries in that capacity, and led the first official Chinese delegation to France in 1971 after the two countries established diplomatic relations, which was also the PRC's first minister-level delegation to visit Western Europe. He was dismissed in 1973 and returned to the military to serve as Deputy Director of the PLA General Logistics Department.  Wartime career  Bai was born in June 1918 into a poor peasant family in Penglai, Shandong. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, he enlisted in the Eighth Route Army in 1937 and joined the Communist Party of China in February 1938. He soon transferred to the New Fourth Army and followed commander Li Xiannian to the Henan-Hubei border region to establish a Communist base area. From December 1942 he served in the tenth branch school of Counter-Japanese Military and Political University. In October 1944 he became deputy political commissar of a regiment. He fought in many battles in the Henan-Hubei region including Yujiadian, Zhutangdian, Xinjie, Dawushan, Pingba, and Lidian. During the Chinese Civil War, Bai served in the Zhongyuan Military Region and fought in the famous Zhongyuan Breakout campaign in June 1946. In August 1947, his unit was reorganized into the 12th Column of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Field Army and fought its way back to the Dabie Mountains region. After February 1948, he became a regimental political commissar and then director of the political department of the First Division of Hubei Military District. He participated in many battles during the People's Liberation Army's takeover of Hubei and Southwest China.  People's Republic of China  After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Bai served in a series of military positions including Director of Organization of the Political Department of the Hubei Military District, Political Commissar of the 123rd Division of the 41st Army, and Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Guangzhou Military Region. He was awarded the rank of colonel in 1955. When the Cultural Revolution began in 1966, China descended into chaos. In July 1970, Bai, until then a career military officer, was appointed as Minister of Foreign Trade to restore order to the ministry, which had been attacked by the Red Guards. During his three- year tenure, he visited dozens of countries including France, Romania, Peru, and Burma, and signed trade agreements with them. In October 1971, he led China's first official government delegation to France after the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two nations, It was also the PRC's first minister-level delegation to visit Western Europe. He was instrumental in building the new Canton Fair exhibition hall to host the enlarged trade fair in autumn 1972. In October 1973, Bai was replaced by Li Qiang as Minister of Foreign Trade. In a meeting with an American delegation led by Henry Kissinger, Jiang Qing revealed that the reason for his dismissal was because the \\"handsome\\" Bai \\"failed to withstand the poisonous snake that took the form of a beautiful woman\\". He returned to the military and served as Deputy Director of the PLA General Logistics Department and Director of its Political Department. Bai retired in November 1987. He died on 7 August 1991 in Beijing, at the age of 73.

F. Klaveness & Co of Kristiania. She was primarily employed as a collier doing tramp trade during her career. The freighter was sunk by a German submarine in April 1917 on one of her regular journeys. Design and Construction Solstad was laid down at Sunderland Ship Building Company's South Dock shipyard in Sunderland, launched on 18 April 1916 (yard number 289), and after successful completion of sea trials was delivered to her owner in June 1916. On May 13, 1916 a new company (Aktieselskapet Dampskibet \\"Solstad\\"), a subsidiary of A. F. Klaveness & Co, with NOK 87,000 starting capital was registered to operate the new vessel. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a mean draft of . Solstad was assessed at , and had deadweight of approximately 7,000. The vessel had a steel hull, and a single 336 nhp triple-expansion steam engine, with cylinders of , , and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller, and moved the ship at up to . Operational history After delivery Solstad was immediately chartered to transport coal to Egypt and left Sunderland for her maiden voyage on June 15, 1916 for Alexandria. After discharging her load, the ship left for Baltimore on July 24 and reached it on August 19. The vessel then loaded 5,693 tons of coal and left for Alexandria at the end of August. The vessel conducted one more trip from Baltimore carrying 5,689 tons of coal at the end of October arriving at Alexandria on November 27. After unloading the vessel continued on to Australia arriving there in January 1917. Solstad finished loading 78,685 sacks (approximately 6,497 tons) of wheat in Melbourne on February 2 and left the next day for Europe. The ship coaled at Fremantle on February 14, Colombo on March 6, touched off at Aden on March 21, 1917 before arriving at Port Said on April 1 around 09:10. After taking on 500 tons of coal the ship departed Port Said at approximately 17:30 and was directed by the British authorities to proceed to Livorno to discharge her cargo. =Sinking= On April 5 1917, at around 12:00 noon, Solstad was in an approximate position and under command of Captain August Larsen. The weather was clear with a gentle breeze from the southeast. At 15:25 a white stripe was noticed in the water close to the vessel, and shortly after a torpedo hit the No. 2 hold on the port side. The ship immediately began to list to port, and an order was given to stop the engines. As the captain ordered the crew to abandon ship and lower the lifeboats, a submarine flying a German navy ensign but no identification, approached. The captain was interrogated, and was told his vessel was within the blockade zone. A boarding crew went aboard to retrieve food supplies, tools, maps and navigational instruments, etc. As the time passed by, the ship steadied herself and was still floating. With the exception of No. 2 hold, no other hold or room seemed to have any water present. At about 18:00 the submarine commander ordered Solstad's crew to abandon ship. Since the ship was not sinking, scuttling charges were placed on board and fired. As the charges exploded, the vessel began listing and slowly sunk bow first around 18:25. At the Captain Larsen's request the submarine took the lifeboats in tow at around 18:50 and pulled them towards Greece until 19:55. The crew then continued rowing towards Greece, and on April 6 at about 15:15 they managed to reach land near a small town of Marathos (Marathopoli) on the west coast of Greece. It was later discovered that the German submarine was responsible for the ship's sinking.

It has a rosette of dull green leaves on side growth at its base and up to fifteen pale green, insect-like flowers with dark red to brownish glands on its labellum. Description Arthrochilus stenophyllus is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herb with an underground tuber that produces daughter tubers on the end of root-like stolons. It has a rosette of between two and five linear to narrow lance- shaped leaves on side growth at the base of the flowering stem, each leaf long, wide and lying flat on the ground. Between three and fifteen pale green, insect-like flowers long are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is linear to spatula-shaped, long, about wide and partly wrapped around the base of the column. The lateral sepals are lance-shaped but curved, long and about wide. The petals are also linear and curved, long and about wide. The lateral sepals and petals are turned back against the ovary. The labellum is green with a dark red blotch at its base, about long and wide on a stalk or \\"claw\\" about long. There is an insect-like callus about long with a few reddish to reddish brown, hair-like glands in a central band. The column is about , curved, light green with a few purplish spots and has two pairs of curved wings. Flowering occurs from December to February. Taxonomy and naming Arthrochilus stenophyllus was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen collected south of Cardwell. The description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (stenophyllus) is derived from the Ancient Greek words stenos meaning \\"narrow\\" and phyllon meaning \\"leaf\\", referring to the narrow rosette leaves. Distribution and habitat The narrow-leaved elbow orchid grows with sedges and shrubs in sparse Melaleuca viridiflora woodland near Cardwell. Ecology As with other Arthrochilus orchids, A. stenophyllus is pollinated by male thynnid wasps of the genus Arthrothynnus although the species involved is not known. It also reproduces asexually by producing new tubers.

Norton (born 1953) is a distinguished professor of the history and philosophy of science at the University of Pittsburgh. He had originally studied chemical engineering at the University of New South Wales (1971‚Äì1974). After working at the Shell Oil Refinery at Clyde, Sydney for two years, he decided to switch fields, beginning doctoral studies in the School of History and Philosophy of Science at the University of New South Wales (1978‚Äì1981). His dissertation was titled, \\"The Historical Foundation of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.\\" After finishing his dissertation, he worked at the Princeton University Press on the Einstein Papers Project (1982‚Äì1983) under the direction of John Stachel. From 1983 until the present, he has been in the Department of History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Pittsburgh, first as a visiting faculty member, then (from 1997) as a full professor, serving as Chair of the department from 2000‚Äì2005. He is currently Director of the Center for Philosophy of Science. Norton is considered an authority on the science of Albert Einstein and the philosophy of science. He has published on general relativity, special relativity, the relationship between thermodynamics and information processing, quantum physics, and the genesis of scientific theories. He is well known for his analysis of Einstein's \\"Zurich Notebook,\\" a small, brown notebook which contains Einstein's private day-to-day calculations during a critical period (1912‚Äì1913) in his development of general relativity. The trio of Einstein scholars, John Norton, John Stachel, and John Earman, have sometimes been jokingly referred to as A central theme of his work on Einstein, is that Einstein's fundamental contributions to the \\"old\\" quantum theory have been largely forgotten because of his well-known criticism of the \\"new\\" quantum mechanics and its statistical interpretation. In the field of information science, Norton has criticized the claim by Rolf Landauer and others that schemes exist whereby digital computers can store data in a logically and physically reversible manner that, until the data are erased, represent an apparent violation of the second law of thermodynamics. In the philosophical debate about thought experiments, Norton has taken the position that all thought experiments (without exception) can be reconstructed as straightforward arguments.

They were large and shallow with the epicentres close together east of Masterton in the Wairarapa region. The June earthquake was sometimes referred to as the Masterton earthquake but both caused damage over a wide area, from Dannevirke and Eketahuna over to Whanganui and down to Otaki and Wellington. There was one death in Wellington, on 24 June. The August earthquake can be regarded as an aftershock of the June earthquake. Both earthquakes were preceded by smaller foreshocks. As the second quake was slightly less in magnitude than the first, they were not an earthquake doublet where the second shake is slightly larger. The August earthquake was considerably deeper (40 km, not 12 km), though another source gives the depths as 43 km and 15 km. There was a further large aftershock on 2 December and another in February 1943.  The Wairarapa Region  The region had already experienced several large earthquakes, the very large 1855 Wairarapa Earthquake, and the 1934 Pahiatua earthquake in the Northern Wairarapa. The 1855 earthquake occurred on the Wairarapa Fault which is part of the North Island Fault System.  24 June 1942  At 11.16 pm a small and sharp but brief earthquake of magnitude 7.2 Ms (Mw 6.9-7.2) shook a wide area in the lower North Island from Eketahuna to Masterton, Featherston and Wellington; and was noticed from Auckland to near Dunedin. The main earthquake was of 7.2 Ms and the epicentre was near Masterton and 12 km deep. The quake lasted for over a minute and had been preceded by a foreshock three hours earlier at 8.15 pm. Many buildings were damaged in Masterton. The mayor Thomas Jordan declared a state of emergency and got troops to patrol the town. There was considerable damage in Palmerston North. Twenty thousand chimneys fell in Wellington and there was one death in Kelburn when a 70-year old retired chemist Hedley Victor Evens was killed by coal gas from a fractured pipe. Some downtown pediments were damaged, but some had already been removed after the 1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake. The city engineer K. E. Luke held that damage was less severe as the quake ended swiftly.  2 August 1942  Another shock in the area struck on 2 August at 12.34 am, preceded by a foreshock on the late afternoon of the 1st. This was of magnitude 7.0 Ms (Mw 6.8) or slightly less than the earlier quake. The epicentre was 40 km deep and at location 41.01¬∞S and 175.52¬∞E. Wairarapa except for Eketahuna did not suffer as badly, though in Masterton the June damage was exacerbated. The 2 August aftershock was followed by a third severe aftershock on 2 December, with about 600 aftershocks recorded to the end of the year.  Damage  Repairs from the first quake were not completed, and the mortar for some repairs had not properly set. Some buildings weakened in June suffered further damage, though it was sometimes hard to tell if further damage had occurred. In Masterton many buildings were badly damaged by the first quake; the fire station, the Bank of New Zealand, several shops and St Matthews Church (which was later blown up by the Army). The Waiohine River's road-bridge on State Highway 2 was badly sunken and was closed. After the second quake Masterton's WFCA building partly collapsed. In Wellington the first quake toppled some twenty thousand chimneys. In August there was serious damage near the Willis Street ‚Äì Manners Street junction to three buildings: Charles Begg's music shop, the Duke of Edinburgh Hotel, and the Regent Hotel. Manners Street between Willis and Cuba Streets was closed for several months. A Wellington Hospital nurse was lucky to be on night duty as a chimney crashed onto her bed. At Porirua Lunatic Asylum (mental hospital) 800 patients had to be transferred to other hospitals.  Overall cost and effect  The cost of the damage from these two quakes was more than ¬£2 million (pounds), a considerable amount for a war- straitened economy. In Masterton damage from the two quakes was still apparent some 12 years later. Another result was the establishment by the government of the Earthquake Commission in 1945.

The Inter-Korean House of Freedom was rebuilt on 9 July 1998 after demolition of the old house of freedom. The building hosted the 2019 North Korea‚ÄìUnited States DMZ Summit. It was also one of many venues considered for the 2018 North Korea‚ÄìUnited States summit, which would be eventually organized in Singapore.  Meetings  The Inter-Korean House of Freedom is one of the main inter-Korean meeting places along with the Inter-Korean Peace House. On 27 April, the April 2018 inter-Korean summit between Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in took place in the Inter-Korean House of Freedom. Panmunjom and the Inter- Korean Peace House had been troubled by a negative public image, but after the successful summit, international press now viewed these locations more positively. Very soon after the inter-Korean summit, On 30 April, US president Donald Trump suggested that the House of Freedom would be a favorable place to discuss denuclearization and a peace treaty on the Korean Peninsula during the 2018 Trump‚ÄìKim Jong-un summit. The summit was the first to be held after more than 65 years since the Korean War, and former US presidents had already paid an occasional visit to the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The House of Freedom, along with the Inter-Korean Peace House, were the first publicly announced options for possible venues of the summit, when Trump Tweeted, \\"Numerous countries are being considered for the MEETING, but would Peace House/Freedom House, on the Border of North & South Korea, be a more Representative, Important and Lasting site than a third party country? Just asking!\\" According to diplomatic information obtained by CNN, North Korea's supreme leader Kim Jong-un had agreed to meeting Trump at the DMZ. The 2018 North Korea‚ÄìUnited States summit would be organized eventually, but in Singapore instead of the originally planned location of the inter-Korean border. A meeting between Trump, Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in took place on June 30, 2019. On June 30, 2019, Donald Trump and Moon Jae-in met with Kim Jong-un at the DMZ and Trump and Kim had one hour summit at Freedom House.
