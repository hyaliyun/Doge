This enzyme catalyzes the following chemical reaction: 440x440px : fumarate + quinol \\\\longrightarrow succinate + quinone Fumarate reductase (QFR) is a key enzyme induced by anaerobic growth of bacteria. By partaking in fumarate respiration, fumarate reductase performs the last step in the microbial anaerobic respiration. It is a membrane bound protein capable of oxidizing a quinone and passing the released electrons to an awaiting fumarate to be reduced. It is activated and synthesized under low oxygen conditions, when aerobic respiration cannot be performed and the cell must perform anaerobic respiration to grow. This reaction is opposite to the reaction that is catalyzed by the related complex II of the respiratory chain (succinate dehydrogenase (SQR)).  Enzyme Structure  To date, a number of QFR enzymes have been crystalized and the specifics of enzyme structure varies between organisms; however, the overall structure remains similar across different species. Fumarate reductase complexes include four subunits. Subunit A contains the site of fumarate reduction and a covalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) prosthetic group. It is closely bound to subunit B, which contains three iron-sulfur centers, all placed near to each other and the nearby substrates. Subunit C consists of hydrophobic membrane-spanning, primarily helical segments and is the site of quinol oxidization. In some fumarate reductase structures, one or more heme groups are additionally bound to the C subunit and participate in the electron transfer. The D subunit contains hydrophobic alpha helices that span the membrane, but does not participate in the catalytic action of the enzyme. It may be required to anchor the catalytic components of the fumarate reductase complex to the cytoplasmic membrane. 3D cartoon depiction of the QFR subunit B with a menaquinone, three iron sulfur clusters, and an FAD molecule (top to bottom).  Enzyme Mechanism  The reduction of fumarate in fumarate reductase is achieved via the oxidation of a quinol bound to subunit C and the resulting transfer of electrons down a chain of iron-sulfur clusters onto a waiting FAD molecule. The edge-to-edge distances between the quinol, the iron sulfur clusters, and the FAD in this enzyme do not exceed 12.5 Angstroms and can be seen on the image below. These short distances between electron receptors allow electrons to travel down the chain at a physiologically reasonable timescale. Once electrons have travelled down the iron-sulfur clusters, they pass onto the FAD molecule bound to the catalytic site of the enzyme. The final reduction of the fumarate is achieved in the active site where the asymmetrical charges from the nearby amino acids polarize the fumarate and distort its shape. Once the fumarate is no longer planar, a hydride from the bound FAD molecule in the active site attacks the double bond to reduce the fumarate. Thus, in this reaction, the fumarate serves as the terminal electron acceptor. Pathway for electron tunneling across the fumarate reductase with distances labeled in Angstroms.  Relation to Succinate Dehydrogenase  Succinate dehydrogenase (SQR) is a key enzyme in both the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain in the mitochondria of eukaryotes and single celled organisms. It is a key enzyme in aerobic respiration and it performs the opposite reaction of QFR, by coupling the reduction of a quinone to the formation of succinate for use in the citric acid cycle. Both SQR and QFR are highly related and have been shown to have some functional overlap and redundancy in various organisms. QFR and SQR are both members of the conserved protein domain family SQR_QFR_TM and have highly similar structures. It has been shown that the A and B subunits of both proteins likely evolved from a common ancestral gene. Both enzymes have a common subunit arrangement containing a catalytic site, an iron-sulfur cluster containing subunit and one or two transmembrane subunits with quinone binding sites and heme binding sites if applicable. Additionally, Based on a study performed in E. coli, researchers have concluded that under some circumstances fumarate reductase is capable of replacing succinate dehydrogenase by oxidizing succinate to produce fumarate. And it has been shown that in Bacillus subtilis, SQR is able to successfully perform the function of fumarate reductase.  Biological Function  Fumarate reductase is involved in anaerobic respiration of multiple different organisms. Most of the information gathered about fumarate reductase is from the Escherichia coli fumarate reductase; however, fumarate reductase has also been studied in other organisms including Wolinella succinogenes, Helicobacter pylori, and Bacteroides fragilis. Each of these organisms has slightly different gene regulation and function in addition to different enzyme structures. In E. coli, fumarate is the terminal electron acceptor of the energy producing electron transport chain and fumarate reductase performs the crucial last step in this energy producing process that allows E. coli to grow when aerobic respiration and/or fermentation is not feasible. Because of its role in cellular energy production, its function is closely regulated by multiple conditions to ensure optimal production of energy based on current cellular needs. In addition to low oxygen conditions, fumarate reductase genes are also activated by high concentrations of fumarate and repressed in the presence of other terminal electron acceptors including nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nitrate. Nitrate suppression of fumarate reductase is common in E.coli and is carried out by two genes, narL a gene that encodes for nitrate reductase regulator proteins and narX that encodes for a nitrate sensor protein. Other man-made antibiotics, including Chalcones have also been proven to successfully inhibit fumarate reductase in addition to other cellular enzymes in order to cripple bacterial growth. Fumarate reductase also has a notably high production of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide in E. coli. The single electron reactivity of FAD, iron- sulfur clusters, and quinones in the fumarate reductase could all contribute to electron transfer to oxygen. However, FAD has been shown to be the most significant cause of superoxide and peroxide formation in fumarate reductase, due to higher solvent accessibility in the active site than in the locations of the quinone and iron-sulfur clusters.

Phytoene desaturases are membrane- bound enzymes localized in plastids and introduce two double bonds into their colorless substrate phytoene by dehydrogenation and isomerize two additional double bonds. This reaction starts a biochemical pathway involving three further enzymes (zeta-carotene isomerase, zeta-carotene desaturase and carotene cis-trans isomerase) called the poly-cis pathway and leads to the red colored lycopene. The homologous phytoene desaturase found in bacteria and fungi (CrtI) converts phytoene directly to lycopene by an all-trans pathway.  Biochemistry  The conversion of phytoene to lycopene in plants and cyanobacteria (left) compared to bacteria and fungi(right). PDS converts 15-cis-phytoene into 9,15,9'-tri-cis-ζ-carotene through reduction of the enzymes non-covalently bound FAD cofactor. This conversion introduces two additional double bonds at positions 11 and 11' of the carbon chain and isomerizes two adjacent already existing double bonds at positions 9 and 9' from trans to cis. The electrons involved in the reaction are subsequently transferred onto plastoquinone and to plastid terminal oxidase PTOX ultimately coupling the desaturation to oxygen reduction. Disruption of this biosynthesis step results in albinism and stunted plant growth.  Applications  Disruption of PDS function can be achieved by bleaching herbicides such as norflurazon and fluridone. These inhibitors occupy the binding pocket of plastoquinone within the enzyme thus blocking it from its function. Due to the clear effect of PDS disruption in plants, the corresponding gene was targeted to showcase successful genome editing in fruit such as apples, grapes or bananas using CRISPR/Cas9 systems. In rice, the natural PDS was supplemented by its bacterial homolog to create Golden Rice and thus increase the β-carotene content of the rice endosperm.

He is a partner at the American law firm Arnold & Porter, where he works in antitrust law and white collar defense. Since January 2020 he has been a visiting fellow in Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution.Bill Baer Joins Brookings  Early life and education  Born in Baraboo, Wisconsin, Baer earned a bachelor's degree in 1972 from Lawrence University and a J.D. degree from Stanford Law School in 1975.  Professional career  Upon graduating law school in 1975, Baer took a job with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) where he held positions as Assistant General Counsel and Director of Congressional Relations; Attorney Advisor to the Chairman; Assistant to the Director, Bureau of Consumer Protection; and Trial Attorney, Bureau of Consumer Protection. Baer left the FTC in 1980 to join the law firm Arnold & Porter. He was an associate at the firm from 1980 until 1984, when he became a partner. He remained a partner at Arnold & Porter until 1995, and among his higher-profile cases was successfully defending General Electric against price-fixing accusations in the 1990s. In 1995, Baer left Arnold & Porter to rejoin the FTC as the director of its Bureau of Competition. Baer left the FTC in October 1999. In January 2000, Baer returned to Arnold & Porter as a partner. In his practice, he represented a broad range of firms in U.S. and cartel investigations, mergers and acquisitions reviews, and antitrust litigation. Baer held that role until his retirement in 2012. Per his disclosure when joining the U.S. Department of Justice in 2012 Baer continues to receive payments from Arnold & Porter until 2025 as part of his retirement package. In 2012 Baer became assistant attorney general for the antitrust division in the Justice Department.  Assistant Attorney General  On February 6, 2012, President Obama nominated Baer to serve as Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division, filling the slot vacated by Christine A. Varney. During his hearings before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary in July 2012, Baer told senators that he felt that the Antitrust Division had been \\"well run in recent years.\\" However, his nomination stalled in the second half of 2012 after some Republican senators said they did not like something discovered in Baer's background check. On September 20, 2012, Baer's nomination was voted out of committee to the full U.S. Senate in a 12–5 vote. On December 30, 2012, the full U.S. Senate confirmed Baer in a 64–26 vote, with all votes against him coming from Republicans. The first case for Baer to oversee in June 2013 was a trial that the Division filed accusing book publishers of conspiring with Apple to fix the prices of e-books. The Justice Department contends that since the trial, the average price of best-selling e-books has dropped to about $6 from $12.99 before. On March 1, 2016 Baer filed an Antitrust Division indictment against oilman Aubrey McClendon alleging conspiracy to fix bidding on freehold oil and natural gas leases. The following day McClendon drove his vehicle at high speed into a bridge embankment in Oklahoma City and died instantly in what the police ruled an accidental death. On March 3, 2016 the Justice Department withdrew the charges.  Associate Attorney General  On April 17, 2016, Baer became acting Associate Attorney General, a position he held until January 20, 2017.  Personal life  After leaving government, Baer returned to Arnold & Porter. Baer is a resident of Bethesda, Maryland.

Summary=Quantifying the locality= While all page replacement algorithms rely on existence of reference locality to function, a major difference among different replacement algorithms is on how this locality is qualified. LIRS uses reuse distance of a page, or the number of distinct pages accessed between two consecutive references of the page, to quantify locality. Specifically, LIRS uses last and second-to-last references (if any) for this purpose. If a page is accessed for the first time, its reuse distance is infinite. In contrast, LRU uses recency of a page, which is the number of distinctive pages accessed after the reference of the page, to quantify locality. To take into account of up-to-date access history, the implementation of LIRS actually uses the larger of reuse distance and recency of a page as the metric to quantify its locality, denoted as RD-R. Assuming the cache has a capacity of C pages, the LIRS algorithm is to rank recently accessed pages according to their RD-R values and retain the C most highly ranked pages in the cache. The concepts of reuse distance and recency can be visualized as below, in which T1 and T2 are page B’s second-to-last and last reference times, respectively, and T3 is the current time. . . . B . . . B . . . . . . . . . . B . . . . . ^Reuse Distance-^Recency^ T1 T2 T3 =Selecting the replacement victim= LIRS organizes metadata of cached pages and some uncached pages and conducts its replacement operations described as below, which are also illustrated with an example Song Jiang, and Xiaodong Zhang, \\"Making LRU Friendly to Weak Locality Workloads: A Novel Replacement Algorithm to Improve File Buffer Cache Performance\\", in IEEE Transactions on Computers, 54 (8): 939-952, August 2005. in the graph. Replacement operations of LIRS # The cache is divided into a Low Inter-reference Recency (LIR) and a High Inter-reference Recency (HIR) partition. The LIR partition is to store the most highly ranked pages (LIR pages) and the HIR partition is to store some of the other pages (HIR pages). # The LIR partition holds the majority of the cache, and all LIR pages are resident in the cache. # All recently accessed pages are placed in a FIFO queue called the LIRS stack (stack S in the graph), and all resident HIR pages are also placed in another FIFO queue (stack Q in the graph). # An accessed page is moved to the top of Stack S and any HIR pages at the stack’s bottom are removed. For example, Graph (b) is produced after page B is accessed on Graph (a). # When a HIR page in Stack S is accessed, it turns into a LIR page and accordingly the LIR page currently at Stack S’s bottom turns into a HIR page and moves to the top of Stack Q. For example, Graph (c) is produced after page E is accessed on Graph (a). # When there is a miss and a resident page has to be replaced, the resident HIR page at the bottom of Stack Q is selected as the victim for replacement. For example, Graphs (d) and (e) are produced after pages D and C are accessed on Graph (a), respectively.

It aired on Fox in the United States on January 13, 2013, and is written by Gary Janetti and directed by Joseph Lee. In the episode, Brian writes a play that becomes a hit in Quahog, but loses his confidence when he finds that the play Stewie wrote is better than his. But when Stewie sees how upset Brian is, he decides to make things right. Plot Brian writes a play, entitled A Passing Fancy, which is a hit in Quahog. Just as he lets his success go to his head, Stewie asks him to read a play he has written. Brian humors him and reads the play after a night of drinking and philosophical discussion with aspiring writers, but he realizes Stewie's play, entitled An American Marriage, is much better than his. His confidence shaken, Brian tells Stewie the play is bad and attempts to destroy the script, but Stewie finds it buried in the yard. Angered, he reveals that he knew Brian's work was inferior because it was easy for even Chris and Peter to follow the plot of A Passing Fancy. Stewie claims that he has \\"a voice\\" when it comes to writing, while Brian uses clichés and plagiarism. This makes Brian emotionally fall apart and chase and kill a squirrel. As Brian sinks into depression, Stewie says that his play is Broadway-bound and demands Brian escort him around New York. At a party for playwrights, Brian tries to ingratiate himself with big-name writers, but they mention that they have seen his play and pronounce it the worst piece of writing they have ever seen. Outside, Stewie finds Brian even further depressed, and Brian admits he knew Stewie's writing was better but had hoped that he could have at least had a chance to be the good writer in the family before he dies far sooner than the rest of them. Stewie says that Brian is speaking with his own voice and he should write from his heart and mind. At the opening of Stewie's play, the crowd leaves unhappy, and Brian is confused as to why Stewie changed it. Stewie claims that he just wanted to \\"tweak\\" it a bit, though he really wanted to make Brian happy again by sabotaging his own play. As they leave the theater, Stewie admires New York and professes a desire to live there one day until they are snatched by a pterodactyl. Reception The episode received a 3.2 rating and was watched by a total of 6.01 million people, this made it the most watched show on Animation Domination that night beating The Cleveland Show, Bob's Burgers, American Dad! and The Simpsons. The episode was met with generally positive reviews from critics. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club gave the episode a A–, saying \\"This is Family Guy at its most self-aware—and more importantly, self aware in the right way, taking stock of its place in the world and remaining honest, something it hasn’t done in years. Business-as-usual cutaways add a little bit here and there, but for the most part the standard building blocks of Family Guy humor gets in the way of the introspective main plot.\\" Carter Dotson of TV Fanatic gave the episode four out of five stars, saying \\"Yet I think because of the fact that the emotions were so complicated, that’s why it was hard to swallow. I certainly had trouble forming coherent thoughts on how to describe my thoughts on this episode, and still am not quite sure how I feel. Still, the fact that this series can pull off this trick of being more than just manatee jokes, I suppose I like being reminded of that fact more than perhaps what I actually watched, which I’m still not completely sure about my feelings on it, to be honest.\\" References External links   Category:2013 American television episodes Category:Family Guy (season 11) episodes ","title":"Brian's Play"},{"id":"38211693","text":"The is the national deposit insurance authority of Japan.

It sponsors the Jardine Scholarship. Jardines was one of the original Hong Kong trading houses or Hongs that date back to Imperial China and, as of December 2010, 41 per cent of the company's profits were still earned in China. The company is controlled by the Keswick family, who are descendants of co-founder William Jardine's older sister, Jean Johnstone. In 2013, both Jardine Matheson and Jardine Strategic were among the top 200 publicly traded companies in the world, as valued by market capitalisation. History=19th century to WWII: The early days= William Jardine and James Matheson, the firm's founders 1846 view of Jardine's original building from Causeway Bay, Hong Kong. The firm of Jardine, Matheson & Company emerged in 1832 from an evolving process of partnership changes in the trading business Cox & Reid, a partnership established in 1782 between John Cox and John Reid, the latter having been agent of the Austrian trading company, Trieste Company.. University of Edinburgh Medical School graduate William Jardine (1784-1843) joined the firm, by then having morphed through Cox & Beale, Beale & Company and Beale & Magniac into Magniac & Company, and the original partners long gone, in 1825 at the invitation of principal Hollingworth Magniac. University of Edinburgh graduate James Matheson joined three years later as Magniac prepared to retire. With the cession of Hong Kong under the 1842 Treaty of Nanking, the firm, by then named Jardine, Matheson & Company, set up its headquarters on the island and grew rapidly. Continuing its longstanding trade in smuggled opium, tea, and cotton, the firm diversified into other areas including insurance, shipping, and railways. By the mid-19th century, the company had become the largest of the hongs or foreign trading conglomerates with offices in all the important Chinese cities as well as Yokohama, Japan. One of its branch agencies, Glover and Co., established in Nagasaki, was known in Japan as an arms dealer who contracted with then-rebel forces from Chōshū Domain who led the Meiji Restoration in 1868. In the early decades of the 20th century, Jardines built cotton mills, a press packing plant, and a brewery in Shanghai while expanding into Africa, America, and Australia. When war came to China in 1937, the firm suffered heavily both in Hong Kong and in mainland China. After the 1949 foundation of the People's Republic of China, trading conditions for foreign companies under the new Communist regime became increasingly difficult.CHINA: Road to Disillusion , Time, 8 February 1954 =Post-WWII restructuring and expansion= In 1961, after the firm's flotation, the landmark Mandarin Hotel opened in Hong Kong in 1963 as the city's first five star hotel. In 1970, Jardine Fleming, the first merchant bank in Asia, opened for business while a real estate company and sugar plantations in Hawaii and the Philippines were acquired. A Hong Kong building boom in the mid 1970s saw Jardine's buy Gammon Construction, the largest construction and civil engineering group on the island. A presence was re-established on the mainland in 1979 following China's reform and opening up and a year later the firm established the Beijing Air Catering Company Ltd., the first foreign joint venture in the country. During the 1970s Jardines also expanded their insurance interests with acquisitions in the United Kingdom and the United States laying the groundwork for the foundation of Jardine Insurance Brokers. By 1980, the firm had operations in southern Africa, Australia, China, Great Britain, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, as well as the United States, and employed 37,000 people. After redomiciling to Bermuda in 1984 ahead of the 1997 handover of Hong Kong, in 1990 Jardine Matheson Holdings and four other listed group companies arranged primary share listings on the London Stock Exchange in addition to their Hong Kong listings. Other significant developments during this decade included the merging of Jardine Insurance Brokers with Lloyd Thompson to form Jardine Lloyd Thompson, the acquisition of a 16% interest in Singapore blue- chip Cycle & Carriage and Dairy Farm’s purchase of a significant stake in Indonesia's leading supermarket group Hero. Hotel brand Mandarin Oriental also embarked on a strategy to double its available rooms and improve returns. The first decade of the new millennium saw Jardine Cycle & Carriage acquire an initial 31% stake in Astra International, which has since been increased to just over 50%. Hongkong Land became a Group subsidiary for the first time following a multi-year programme of steady open market purchases while Jardine Pacific raised its interest in Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited from 25% to 42%. 21st-century operations Jardine's headquarters (Jardine House) Jardines today comprises a group of companies with extensive operations across Asia and, through some of its businesses, the world.

Corporate structure  The present Chairman of Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd. is Sir Henry Keswick, the company's Tai-pan from 1970 (aged 31) to 1975 and the 6th Keswick to be Tai-pan of the company. His brother, Simon, was the company's Tai-pan from 1983 to 1988 and is the 7th Keswick to be Tai-pan. Both brothers are the 4th generation of Keswicks in the company. The 5th generation of Keswicks are also active within the organisation, Ben Keswick, son of Simon, is managing director of Jardine Matheson Group and Adam Keswick, son of Sir Chips Keswick is Deputy managing director. The organizational structure of Jardines has changed almost totally, but the members of the family of Dr William Jardine still have significant influence in the firm. =Directors (as of 2016)= In July 2016, the directors of Jardine Matheson Holdings were: *Henry Keswick, chairman * Ben Keswick, managing director * Adam Keswick, deputy managing director * Mark Greenberg * David Hsu * Simon Keswick * Dr. Richard Lee * Jeremy Parr * Anthony Nightingale * Y.K. Pang * John Witt * Lord Sassoon, Kt * Percy Weatherall * Michael Wei Kuo Wu Company secretary: Neil McNamara Lord Sassoon, a former UBS Warburg banker who had been a junior minister in the British Treasury since May 2010, joined Jardine Matheson as an executive board member in January 2013. This appointment brought together members of two great Asian trading dynasties, since Jardine Matheson and the Sassoon family were rivals in the 19th century when they competed to open up and grow trade in Hong Kong and China. =Scottish leadership= Until 1936, principles of staff recruitment, told by Keswick, remained Scottish first, Oxbridge second. \\"With all due deference to the 'east coast of England' [a reference to Cambridge] I do feel that men from north of the border are the most suitable for our routine business... I am very keen on keeping the Scottish entity of the Firm. But I hope I have not conveyed that I have swung against the University man... I merely consider that he must be aided and abettered by the solid, plodding type from Scotland.\\" Jardines is controlled by the Keswick family, who are direct descendants of William Jardine's sister Jean through the marriage of her daughter to Thomas Keswick, father of William Keswick, an early Tai-pan of the firm. While the leadership of Jardines is Scottish, the firm is international in its dealings. The staff of Jardines (390,000 employees as of March 2014) is predominantly Asian, with senior management levels composed of a mixture of British, Chinese, Indonesians, Europeans, Australians and Americans. The Keswicks have maintained a relationship with another prominent Scottish family, the Flemings, of which the author Ian Fleming was also a member. From 1970 until 1998, Jardine Matheson operated a pan-Asian investment banking joint venture, Jardine Fleming, with Robert Fleming & Co., a London merchant bank controlled by the Fleming family. In 2000, Jardine Fleming and Robert Fleming & Co. were sold to JP Morgan Chase. Influence * Jardines' history was the inspiration for a series of novels written by James Clavell, including Tai-Pan, Gai-Jin, and Noble House. The Noble House TV miniseries actually used Jardine as the headquarters of Struan's & Co., the fictional company depicted in Clavell's novels. In Taipan, Dirk Struan is loosely based on William Jardine while Robb Struan is loosely based on James Matheson.\\"Book (1966): Tai-Pan, James Clavell\\", South China Morning Post (29 March 2009), p. 7.Robyn Meredith, \\"Sailing From Old to New Asia; Jardine Matheson is ever more a play on its traditional region\\", Forbes Asia, Volume 4, Issue 15 (15 September 2008), p. 88. * Jardines installed the first elevator in China in the northern city of Tianjin. * Many streets in present-day Hong Kong are named after the firm, its founders and past Tai-pans, mostly concentrated in Hong Kong's East Point and Causeway Bay Districts, where Jardines' offices were located in the early days. The name of Yee Wo Street in comes from Jardine's Chinese name \\"Ewo\\" whilst other streets associated with the company include Jardine's Bazaar, Jardine's Crescent, Jardine's Bridge, Jardine's Lookout, Matheson Street, Leighton Road, Percival Street and Paterson Street. * Jardines is responsible for maintaining the tradition of firing the noonday gun, a duty said to have been imposed on them by a new Senior Naval Officer on hearing them fire a salute for the Taipan when his schooner arrived in Hong Kong as they had no official authority to fire salutes. The practice was immortalised in Noël Coward's song \\"Mad Dogs and Englishmen\\".

The book was published on October 18, 2010, through Little, Brown & Company. Origen and Golan stated that they came up with the idea of using the comic book as a medium as a \\"dose of emergency comic relief\\" and because they saw the idea of \\"ordinary people\\" dealing with large issues such as unemployment as \\"not that far\\" from the idea of superheroes battling large villains. Synopsis The book follows Unemployed Man, an out of work superhero and his sidekick Plan B. Unemployed Man first began as The Ultimatum, a rich superhero that looked down upon the poor and unemployed as lazy or otherwise unmotivated. He later loses his job and is defeated by the Invisible Hand, eventually ending up homeless. Unemployed Man must then seek a new job and team up with other superheroes in the same situation he is currently in. Reception The book was reviewed in Wired and Time. The Guardian called it \\"a furious, fearless, Swiftian kind of a book\\". Publishers Weekly stated that the \\"entire message comes off as preaching to the choir\\".

(1994). Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). pp. 387 - 388. However, as the clan does not currently have a chief that is recognized by the Lord Lyon King of Arms it is therefore considered an armigerous clan. History=Origins of the clan= The surname Fleming is derived from the French, le Fleming, which indicates that the family originated in Flanders. The once powerful medieval principality of Flanders is now split between Belgium, the Netherlands and France. During the latter part of the twelfth century the Flemish were enterprising merchants who traded with England, Scotland and Wales. A distinguished Flemish leader named Baldwin settled with his followers in Biggar, South Lanarkshire under a grant of David I of Scotland. Baldwin became Sheriff of Lanark under Malcolm IV of Scotland and William the Lion and this office appears to have been hereditary for some time. =Wars of Scottish Independence= In 1296 nine Flemings signed the Ragman Rolls swearing fealty to Edward I of England. However, one of the signatories was Sir Robert Fleming who was one of the first people to join Robert the Bruce after the death of the Comyn in 1306. In 1342 Sir Malcolm Fleming of Cumbernauld was created Earl of Wigtown by David II of Scotland for helping to keep him safe from Edward Balliol and the English. In 1371 Sir Malcolm's grandson, Thomas Fleming, sold the earldom to Archibald Douglas, Lord of Galloway and this was confirmed by Robert II of Scotland. =15th century= Sir Malcolm Fleming of Biggar and Cumbernauld was knighted by Robert III of Scotland. In 1423 he was one of the hostages used for the release of James I of Scotland from the captivity of the English. This Sir Malcolm Fleming was a counsellor and friend of William Douglas, 6th Earl of Douglas and was a member of the party that went to Edinburgh Castle with Douglas, on the invitation Governor Livingstone and Chancellor Crichton in November 1440, where Douglas, his brother David and Fleming were arrested, briefly tried and then beheaded. As a result, his younger son, Sir Robert Fleming, forfeited the lands that had been returned to him by James II of Scotland because his father had died at the faith and peace of His Majesty. Sir Robert Fleming was created a Lord of Parliament before 1460. =16th century= Sir Robert's grandson, John Fleming, 2nd Lord Fleming, was appointed as a guardian to James V of Scotland during the king's infancy in July 1515. In 1517 John became Chancellor of Scotland. However while he was out hawking on 1 November 1524, he was assassinated by John Tweedie of Drummelzier (chief of Clan Tweedie) and others. Malcolm Fleming, 3rd Lord Fleming was Great Chamberlain of Scotland and married Lady Janet Stewart, daughter of James IV of Scotland. This Malcolm Fleming was killed at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547. In 1548 James Fleming, 4th Lord Fleming accompanied the young Mary, Queen of Scots to France where she married the heir to the throne. He was Great Chamberlain of Scotland for life and was one of eight commissioners to the royal wedding in 1558. However he died of suspected poisoning two weeks later in Paris. =17th century= In 1606 John the sixth Lord Fleming was created Earl of Wigtown. =18th century and Jacobite risings= The Clan Fleming were Jacobites and the 6th earl attended James II of England and VII of Scotland after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Fleming opposed the Treaty of Union and voted against every article in the Parliament of 1706. During the Jacobite rising of 1715 he was arrested by the governor of Edinburgh Castle. Charles Fleming had succeeded his brother as the earl but when he died in 1747 the title became dormant. =Modern history= According to the Collins Scottish Clan and Family Encyclopedia, Alexander Fleming who discovered Penicillin is the most distinguished bearer of the name in recent times. Clan castles The ruins of Boghall Castle Castles that have been owned by the Clan Fleming include amongst many others: *Biggar Castle, which was on the High Street of Biggar, South Lanarkshire was once a strong castle that dates from the thirteenth century.Coventry, Martin. (2008). Castles of the Clans: The Strongholds and Seats of 750 Scottish Families and Clans. pp. 198 - 199. . Nothing now survives of the castle which was long held by the Flemings who were descended from Baldwin of Biggar. They moved to Boghall Castle in the fourteenth century. *Boghall Castle, on the south side of Biggar, Lanarkshire, mostly dates from the sixteenth century although there was an older stronghold on the site. Two D shaped towers survive but the rest is ruinous. Edward II of England stayed at Boghall in 1310. *Cumbernauld Castle in Cumbernauld, central Scotland, was a strong castle, most of which is now gone apart from the vaulted chambers and some other fragments that are built into Cumbernauld House. The castle was originally held by the Clan Comyn but passed to the Flemings in 1306. Mary, Queen of Scots visited the castle and the National Covenant was signed there in 1646. The castle was burned in 1746 by government dragoons during the Jacobite rising of 1745.

Four chips hold Cassette BASIC, and one holds the BIOS. The IBM Personal Computer Basic, commonly shortened to IBM BASIC, is a programming language first released by IBM with the IBM Personal Computer, Model 5150 (IBM PC) in 1981. IBM released four different versions of the Microsoft BASIC interpreter, licensed from Microsoft for the PC and PCjr. They are known as Cassette BASIC, Disk BASIC, Advanced BASIC (BASICA), and Cartridge BASIC. Versions of Disk BASIC and Advanced BASIC were included with IBM PC DOS up to PC DOS 4. In addition to the features of an ANSI standard BASIC, the IBM versions offered support for the graphics and sound hardware of the IBM PC line. Source code could be typed in with a full-screen editor, and very limited facilities were provided for rudimentary program debugging. IBM also released a version of the Microsoft BASIC compiler for the PC, concurrently with the release of PC DOS 1.10 in 1982. Background IBM licensed Microsoft BASIC for the IBM Personal Computer, despite already having its own version of BASIC for the company's mainframes. Don Estridge said, \\"Microsoft BASIC had hundreds of thousands of users around the world. How are you going to argue with that?\\"  IBM Cassette BASIC  IBM Cassette BASIC came in 32 kilobytes (KB) of read-only memory (ROM), separate from the 8 KB BIOS ROM of the original IBM PC, and did not require an operating system to run. Cassette BASIC provided the default user interface invoked by the BIOS through INT 18h if there was no floppy disk drive installed, or if the boot code did not find a bootable floppy disk at power up. The name Cassette BASIC came from its use of cassette tapes rather than floppy disks to store programs and data. Cassette BASIC was built into the ROMs of the original PC and XT, and early models in the PS/2 line. It only supports loading and saving programs to the IBM cassette tape interface, which is unavailable on models after the original Model 5150. The entry-level version of the 5150 came with just 16 KB of random-access memory (RAM), which was sufficient to run Cassette BASIC. However, Cassette BASIC was rarely used because few PCs were sold without a disk drive, and most were sold with PC DOS and sufficient RAM to at least run Disk BASIC—many could run Advanced BASIC as well. There are three versions of Cassette BASIC: C1.00 (found on the early IBM PCs with 16k-64k motherboards), C1.10 (found on all later IBM PCs, XTs, ATs, and PS/2s), and C1.20 (found on the PCjr).  IBM Disk BASIC  IBM Disk BASIC (BASIC.COM) was included in the original IBM PC DOS. Because it uses the 32 KB Cassette BASIC ROM, BASIC.COM did not run on even highly compatible PC clones, such as the Compaq Portable. The name Disk BASIC came from its use of floppy disks as well as cassette tapes to store programs and data. Disk-based code corrected errata in the ROM- resident code and added floppy disk and serial port support. Disk BASIC can be identified by its use of the letter D preceding the version number. It adds disk support and some features lacking in Cassette BASIC, but does not include the extended sound/graphics functions of BASICA. The primary purpose of Disk BASIC was as a \\"light\\" version for IBM PCs with only 48 KB of memory: BASIC.COM would then have about 23 KB free for user code, whereas BASICA would only have about 17 KB. By 1986, all new PCs shipped with at least 256k and DOS versions after 3.00 reduced Disk BASIC to only a small stub that called BASICA.COM for compatibility with batch files. Even with all this excess RAM, BASIC would still only allocate and manage just under 61 KB for user programs, whether it was Cassette BASIC, BASIC.COM or BASICA.  IBM Advanced BASIC  IBM Advanced BASIC (BASICA.COM) was also included in the original IBM PC DOS, and required the ROM-resident code of Cassette BASIC. It adds functions such as diskette file access, storing programs on disk, monophonic sound using the PC's built-in speaker, graphics functions to set and clear pixels, draw lines and circles, and set colors, and event handling for communications and joystick presses. BASICA will not run on non-IBM computers (even so-called \\"100% compatible\\" machines) or later IBM models, since those lack the needed ROM BASIC. BASICA versions are the same as their respective DOS, beginning with v1.00 and ending with v3.30. The early versions of BASICA do not support subdirectories and some graphics commands functioned slightly differently. As an example, if the LINE statement was used to draw lines that trailed off- screen, BASIC merely intersects them with the nearest adjacent line while in BASIC 2.x and up, they go off the screen and do not intersect. The PAINT command in BASIC 1.x begins filling at the coordinate specified and expands outward in alternating up and down directions while in BASIC 2.x it fills everything below the starting coordinate and then after finishing, everything above it. BASIC 1.x's PAINT command also makes use of the system stack for storage and when filling in complex areas, it is possible to produce an OVERFLOW error. To remedy this, the CLEAR statement can be used to expand BASIC's stack (128 bytes is the default size). BASIC 2.x does not use the stack when PAINTing and thus is free of this problem. Compaq BASIC 1.13 was the first standalone BASIC for the PC (that did not require Cassette BASIC to run) as well as the only version of BASIC besides IBM BASICA 1.00 and 1.10 to use FCBs and include the original LINE statement with intersecting lines (the PAINT statement in Compaq BASIC 1.13 worked like in all later versions of BASICA/GW-BASIC, using the new fill algorithm and no stack). Early versions of PC DOS include several sample BASIC programs demonstrating the capabilities of the PC, including the BASICA game DONKEY.BAS. GW-BASIC is identical to BASICA, with the exception of including the Cassette BASIC code in the program, thus allowing it to run on non-IBM computers and later IBM models that lack Cassette BASIC in ROM.  IBM PCjr Cartridge BASIC  A ROM cartridge version of BASIC was only available on the IBM PCjr, shipped in 1984, and supports the additional graphics modes and sound capabilities possible on that machine.Readers' Feedback: IBM BASIC Versions, Compute! Magazine, No. 78, November 1986, p. 8, retrieved December 23, 2011 It is a superset of advanced BASIC.IBM. PCjr Cartridges Announcement Letter. 1983-11-01 (). Cartridge BASIC can only operate within the first 128 KB of memory on the PCjr and will not work with expansion RAM, i.e., the DEF SEG function cannot be used to point to memory segments above &H1FF0.; Cartridge BASIC is activated by typing BASICA at the DOS prompt. Conversely, IBM BASICA versions 2.1 and up will refuse to run if it detects a PCjr, but can be patched to work around this.  Operation  Cassette BASIC loads when a PC or PCjr is booted without a bootable disk or cartridge. Disk BASIC and Advanced BASIC load when their command name (BASIC and BASICA respectively) is typed at a DOS command prompt (except PCjr, which activates Cartridge BASIC instead), with some optional parameters to control allocation of memory. When loaded, a sign-on identification message displays the program version number, and a full-screen text editor starts (see images, right). The function keys are assigned common commands, which display at the bottom of the screen. Commands may be typed in to load or save programs, and expressions can be typed in and executed in direct (immediate) mode. If a line of input starts with a number, the language system stores the following line of text as part of program source, allowing a programmer to enter in an entire program line by line, entering line numbers before each statement. When listed on screen, lines are displayed in order of increasing line number. Changes can be made to a displayed line of program source code by moving the cursor to the line with the cursor keys, and typing over the on-screen text. Program source is stored internally in a tokenized form, where reserved words are replaced with a single byte token, to save space and execution time. Programs may be saved in compact tokenized form, or optionally saved as DOS ASCII text filesDOS text files terminate each line with a CR (carriage return, ASCII 13) and LF (linefeed, ASCII 10) character pair, in that order. that can be viewed and edited with other programs. Like most other DOS applications, IBM BASIC is a text-mode program and has no features for windows, icons, mouse support, or cut-and-paste editing.  Legacy  GW-BASIC, launched in 1983, is a disk- based Microsoft product that was distributed with non-IBM MS-DOS computers, and supports all the graphics modes and features of BASICA on computers that do not have IBM Cassette BASIC. The successor to BASICA for MS-DOS and PC DOS versions, now discontinued, is QBasic, launched in 1991. It is a stripped-down version of the Microsoft QuickBASIC compiler: QBasic is an interpreter and cannot compile source files, while QuickBASIC can compile and save the programs in the .EXE executable file format.

Founded in 1992, in Lakeland, Florida, the CSA was formed when one-thousand and ninety-two Canadians staged a rally opposing the reduction of payments, by several Canadian provinces, for out-of-country emergency medical care, a right enshrined in the portability section of the Canada Health Act ( Sec. 11(1)(b)(ii)). Since its founding, the CSA has actively engaged with all levels of government in both Canada and the United States, on behalf of its membership, on an array of health-related and other issues. Today, the Canadian Snowbird Association has approximately 110,000 members across Canada. Advocacy The advocacy efforts of the Canadian Snowbird Association are informed by the following principles: * To act upon and create a beneficial environment for members by promoting and protecting their interests and rights; * To act in anticipation of possible changes in existing programs and services that may have adverse effects; * To act in response to needs for new and appropriate services and programs. The lobbying initiatives of the CSA are financed by the generous donations made by the membership. =Canada= Since its inception, the Canadian Snowbird Association has been involved in working with governments across Canada on issues of importance to travelling Canadians. In 1993, the government of New Brunswick proposed reducing the amount of time that residents could spend outside of the province, while maintaining their provincial health coverage from six months to 90 days. As a result of the advocacy work of the CSA, the New Brunswick government eventually shelved the proposal and maintained the existing six-month residency requirement. Two years later, in 1995, the CSA worked with the Ontario government in order to restore the out-of-country emergency care in-patient rate of $400 per day. Under Premier Bob Rae, the Ontario government had reduced the reimbursement rate for emergency in-patient care from $400 per day to $100 per day. Similarly, in 1999, the CSA again worked with the Ontario government to increase the length of time that residents could be outside of the province, from six to seven months, and still retain health coverage under the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP). This increase was made in conjunction with another policy change which allowed beneficiaries of the Ontario Drug Benefit Program (ODB) to receive up to a 200-day supply of prescription medication for travel purposes. In 2007, in an attempt to put pressure on the provincial and territorial governments to begin complying with the portability section of the Canada Health Act, then federal Minister of Health Tony Clement wrote a letter to every Minister of Health, reminding them of their obligations under the Canada Health Act. The Canadian Snowbird Association also worked to introduce mail-in ballots, in Ontario, for eligible electors who are outside of the province during a provincial election. Since 2002, the CSA had recommended to the Ontario government that the Election Act be amended to include an absentee ballot option for temporarily absent residents. In 2010, An Act to Amend the Election Act and the Election Finances Act was passed in the Ontario legislature, which made the necessary changes to allow Ontario residents to vote by mail-in ballot during a general election. The CSA has also worked with governments in Western Canada in order to secure more travel-friendly policies for long-term vacationing residents. In 2012, the CSA was instrumental in urging the Saskatchewan government to allow residents to get up to six months of prescription drugs processed at one time through the Saskatchewan Drug Plan. Prior to this change, drug plan beneficiaries had to submit two separate receipts for two three-month supplies. This reduction in red tape has resulted in less upfront costs and hassle for travelling residents of Saskatchewan. At the federal level, the CSA recommended that the Canadian government introduce a Canadian passport with a 10-year validity period. In 2013, Ottawa implemented this recommendation. Also in 2013, the Canadian Snowbird Association worked in partnership with the government of British Columbia to increase the amount of time that permanent residents can be out-of-country from six to seven months, while still maintaining their provincial health coverage. Later in the same year, the CSA effectively petitioned both the Manitoba and Alberta governments to extend the length of time that residents could temporarily reside outside of Canada to a maximum of 7 months in a 12-month period. During the following year (2014), both the province of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia made similar changes to their travel-health policies. In May 2014, due to the efforts of the CSA, the New Brunswick government increased the amount of time that Medicare beneficiaries could temporarily remain outside of the province, from six to seven months, while retaining their eligibility for continued health coverage. Months later, the government of Nova Scotia announced a similar change which was made effective on August 1, 2014. In conjunction with the increase in out-of-province health coverage, the Nova Scotia Family and Seniors' Pharmacare Programs was also amended to allow for a 270-day prescription medication supply maximum for vacation purposes. Under previous policy, beneficiaries could obtain up to a 180-day supply of medication at the discretion of their physician and pharmacist. This amendment to policy was also implemented on August 1, 2014. =United States= The government relations work of the Canadian Snowbird Association also extends to all levels of government in the United States. In 2003, a proposed rule which sought to reduce the amount of time that Canadian tourists could spend physically present in the United States, from six months to 30 days, was rescinded after the CSA appeared before the U.S. House Small Business Committee on Capitol Hill. Florida Governor Jeb Bush mentioned the CSA in his press release, recognizing the efforts of the association in the successful withdrawal of the planned legislative changes. At the state level, the CSA has engaged with the Florida government on the issue of property tax. The state of Florida employs a two-tier tax system which treats residents and non-residents differently. In 2006, the Canadian Snowbird Association appeared before the Florida Property Tax Reform Committee to present the association's position on proposed property tax reform. In 2013, the state of Florida passed legislation which required foreign drivers to obtain an International Driving Permit in order to operate a motor vehicle. The CSA worked with government representatives at the state level, and the Florida Legislature soon repealed the requirement when it reconvened. In response to member feedback, in 2012 and 2013, the CSA lobbied the U.S. Congress to increase the amount of time that Canadian retirees could spend in the United States from six to eight months. As a result of CSA lobbying efforts, the \\"Canadian Retiree Visa\\" or \\"Snowbird Visa\\" was included in multiple bills in both the Senate and House of Representatives. One of the bills, the JOLT Act, was attached to the comprehensive immigration reform bill which was approved by the Senate on June 27, 2013 with a final vote of 68 to 32. The JOLT Act has been referred to the Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security in the U.S. House of Representatives. Programs and Services In addition to the advocacy work of the association, the CSA also provides a number of value-added programs and services which cater to the snowbird lifestyle. =CSANews= CSANews is the official news magazine of the Canadian Snowbird Association.

The film features a pansori master (Song Kang-ho) and his student (Jeon Hyo-jung). The 18-minute short was released online on December 28, 2012 on the website of outdoor clothing brand Kolon Sport, and was funded by the company to mark its 40th anniversary. This is the second project by the duo dubbed collectively as \\"PARKing CHANce,\\" composed of film director Park Chan-wook and his brother Park Chan-kyong, who is known for his installation art, photography and experimental films. Their previous collaboration Night Fishing, shot entirely with an iPhone 4, won Best Short Film at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2011. Plot A master (Song Kang-ho) and his student (Jeon Hyo-jung) visit a mountain to practice pansori following a music competition that left the trainee disappointed. Production The film was shot in four days, and most of the scenes took place at Mount Namsan in Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province. The scenery served as the backdrop for the central pansori performances. Pansori is a genre of Korean folk music that harbors a range of emotions, including han, repressed bitterness and powerlessness that many say lingers in the Korean people. Day Trip highlights the traditional music's harmonious nature with the surrounding scenery by featuring a version of Sae Taryeong (\\"Song of Birds\\"). Outdoor clothing brand Kolon Sport had commissioned and funded the short for its 40th anniversary \\"Way to Nature Film Project.\\" But the short has almost no promotional elements because the company gave the Parks directorial autonomy. Rather than rendering typical outdoor images, they focused on presenting pansori in harmony with the surrounding nature and civilization. The characters' trip to the mountain appears to be part of a 100-day practice session required for pansori singers in which they train their voices in the unique acoustic setting of the waterfalls, cliffs and caves. They sing so loudly their voices usually go hoarse and their bodies swell until they feel blood in their throats. In recent years, this kind of training may be seen as a way to permanently injure vocal cords, but they pushed themselves in isolation for 100 days believing that the efforts would ultimately makes one's voice suitable for pansori. The short was the debut film for 15-year-old Jeon Hyo-jung. The actress, a pansori major at the National Middle School of Traditional Arts, was selected for the role through a competitive audition. In order to play a man much older than himself, prior to each shoot actor Song Kang-ho had to undergo intense make-up sessions under make-up artist Song Jong-hee, who was previously recognized for her work on the film Eungyo.

The highway starts from State Highway 99 (SH 99) in Sugar Land and goes north to FM 1093 at Clodine. The four-lane divided highway passes through both rural and suburban areas. Route description FM 1464 begins at a traffic signal on SH 99 about north of the intersection of SH 99 and U.S. Route 90A (US 90A). The location is also a short distance to the north of a railroad underpass. FM 1464 initially starts east but then veers to the north and continues in a northerly direction as a four-lane divided highway for virtually its entire course. From the starting point for about , the highway passes through a rural area, except for the Chelsea Harbor subdivision, which is on the east side. Entering an area flanked on both sides by the Stratford Park Village and Orchard Lake Estates subdivisions, FM 1464 comes to a traffic signal at Old Richmond Road and the Macario Garcia Middle School, which is on the east side. Like all the other public schools along the highway's route, Garcia belongs to the Fort Bend Independent School District. The highway turns more to the northeast before passing Stephen F. Austin High School on the east side, then turns north again before coming to a traffic light at West Airport Road. At this point, FM 1464 enters its 2010-designated right-of-way (see History). The pre-2010 right-of- way is known as Clodine Road which is accessible from Denver Miller Road and continues directly north. From West Airport to West Bellfort Road, FM 1464 curves to the north-northwest through an open area. Between West Bellfort and Madden Road, the highway passes through the Aliana subdivision and bends back to the north. From Madden Road to the traffic signal at Beechnut Street the aspect is rural. The drainage ditch south of the traffic signal at Beechnut Street was the place where a long east-west segment of the former FM 1464 right-of-way connected with Clodine Road. The next north-bound signal after Beechnut is at Clodine Road/Orchard Ridge Lane. Mission West Elementary School is on the east side. Going north, there are traffic lights at Highland Oak Lane/Watering Oaks Lane and Bellaire Boulevard. The traffic signal at West Oaks Village Drive provides access to George H. W. Bush High School on the east side and West Oaks Village subdivision on the west side. After a short distance, FM 1464 crosses under the Westpark Tollway. There are entrance and exit ramps between the tollway and FM 1464\\\\. North of the underpass, the highway widens into an eight-lane road for about before ending at a traffic signal at FM 1093\\\\. There is a Kroger store on the east side. This location is a few hundred feet west of the Harris County boundary. The road north of FM 1093, which is not part of FM 1464, is called South Barker Cypress Road. History FM 1464 was originally designated on July 22, 1949, to go from U.S. Route 59 (US 59) north to FM 1093 at Clodine. A 1955 map shows that US 59 shared the same route that is used by US 90A in 2012, which is about north of the path of US 59 in 2012. On December 12, 1994 FM 1464 was realigned to connect with SH 99 at distance north of US 90A. This was done by a spur connection of length .

Jimeno, 500 U.S. 248 (1991), was a U.S. Supreme Court case involving the exclusionary rule of evidence under the Fourth Amendment.. Background A police officer pulled over Enio Jimeno for a traffic violation after following him due to information that he may have been involved in a drug deal. Jimeno consented to a search of his car, but nothing more. The officer had informed Jimeno that he suspected him of having drugs in the car. The officer opened up a package and found cocaine inside. At trial, Jimeno argued that his consent to search his car did not extend to his permission to search within containers and packages. The lower court and the Florida Supreme Court upheld that Jimeno's consent did not cover the officer's efforts and thus ruled in Jimeno's favor. The State of Florida appealed to the United States Supreme Court. Opinion of the Court In a 7-2 vote, the Court overturned the lower courts' decision and ruled that the officer's search of containers within the car were not considered unreasonable. Since a reasonable person would expect narcotics to be carried in a container, and because the officer told Jimeno of his suspicions, the Court ruled that the officer acted within reason. Jimeno was thus found guilty and the officer was not in violation of the 4th amendment. Significance This case grants law enforcement greater ability to conduct searches. It also narrows the definition of unreasonable searches and thus limits the protection citizens can seek against such searches. Evidence cannot be excluded from a case if it is deemed to have been discovered through reasonable means.

Only the United States, Israel, China, Iran, Italy, India, Pakistan, Russia, Turkey, and Poland are known to have manufactured operational UCAV as of 2019. Drone attacks can be conducted by commercial UCAVs dropping bombs, firing a missile, or crashing into a target. Since the turn of the century, most drone strikes have been carried out by the US military in such countries as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria, Iraq, Somalia, and Yemen using air-to-surface missiles, but drone warfare has increasingly been deployed by Turkey and Azerbaijan. Drones strikes are used for targeted killings by several countries.  Drone warfare  Commercial UCAVs may be equipped with such weapons as guided bombs, cluster bombs, incendiary devices, air-to-surface missiles, air-to-air missiles, anti- tank guided missiles or other types of precision-guided munitions, autocannons and machine guns. Drone attacks can be conducted by commercial UCAVs dropping bombs, firing a missile, or crashing into a target. Commercial unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be weaponized by being loaded with dangerous payloads and then crashed into vulnerable targets or detonated above them. They can also drop hand grenades or other munitions. Payloads could include explosives, shrapnel, chemical, radiological or biological hazards. Multiple drones may attack simultaneously in a so-called \\"drone swarm attack\\". Anti-UAV systems are being developed by states to counter the threat of drone strikes. This is, however, proving difficult. According to James Rogers, an academic who studies drone warfare, \\"There is a big debate out there at the moment about what the best way is to counter these small UAVs, whether they are used by hobbyists causing a bit of a nuisance or in a more sinister manner by a terrorist actor.\\" The Economist has cited Azerbaijan's highly effective use of drones in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and Turkey's use of drones in the Syrian civil war as indicating the future of warfare. Noting that it had previously been assumed that drones would not play a major role in conflicts between nations due to their vulnerability to anti-aircraft fire, it suggested that while this might be true for major powers with air defences, it was less true for minor powers. It noted Azerbaijani tactics and Turkey's use of drones as indicating a \\"new, more affordable type of air power\\". It also noted that the ability of drones to record their kills enabled a highly effective Azerbaijani propaganda campaign. United States drone strikes In 1991, both AAI RQ-2 Pioneer and AeroVironment FQM-151 Pointer drones were used for surveillance during the Gulf War. In 1993, General Atomics GNAT UAVs were tested for surveillance in the Yugoslav Wars. In 2001–2002, General Atomics MQ-1 Predator drones were equipped with missiles to strike enemy targets. However, Ben Emmerson, special investigator for the United Nations Human Rights Council, said that U.S. drone strikes may have violated international humanitarian law.Drone strikes by US may violate international law, says UN . The Guardian. 18 October 2013.UN report calls for independent investigations of drone attacks . The Guardian. 18 October 2013. The Intercept reported, \\"Between January 2012 and February 2013, U.S. special operations airstrikes [in northeastern Afghanistan] killed more than 200 people. Of those, only 35 were the intended targets. During one five-month period of the operation, according to the documents, nearly 90 percent of the people killed in airstrikes were not the intended targets.\\"\\"The Obama Administration's Drone-Strike Dissembling \\". The Atlantic. 14 March 2016.\\"The Assassination Complex \\". The Intercept. 15 October 2015. In the United States drone strikes are used to lessen the number of casualties since there is no one that has to physically fight in combat. Being able to send drones to fight reduces the number of American lives lost substantially. The U.S had increased the use of drone strikes significantly during Obama's presidency compared to Bush's.With the help from joint defense facility at Pine Gap, which locates targets by intercepting radio signals, the U.S. is double-tap drone striking. In August 2018, Al Jazeera reported that a Saudi Arabian-led coalition \\"battling Houthi rebels [in Yemen] secured secret deals with al-Qaeda in Yemen and recruited hundreds of the group's fighters.... Key figures in the deal-making said the United States was aware of the arrangements and held off on drone attacks against the armed group, which was created by Osama bin Laden in 1988.\\" =Effects= Scholarly opinions are mixed regarding the efficacy of drone strikes. Some studies support that decapitation strikes to kill a terrorist or insurgent group's leadership limit the capabilities of these groups in the future, while other studies refute this. Drone strikes are successful at suppressing militant behavior, though this response is in anticipation of a drone strike rather than as a result of one. Data from the US and Pakistan's joint counterterrorism efforts show that militants cease communication and attack planning to avoid detection and targeting. Islamic State drone strikes Small drones and quadcopters have been used for strikes by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. A group of twelve or more have been piloted by specially trained pilots to drop munitions onto enemy forces. They have been able to evade ground defense forces. During the battle for Mosul, the Islamic State was able to kill or wound dozens of Iraqi soldiers by dropping light explosives or 40-millimeter grenades from numerous drones attacking at the same time. FBI Director Christopher Wray stated at a Senate hearing that \\"We do know that terrorist organizations have an interest in using drones... We have seen that overseas already with some frequency. I think that the expectation is that it is coming here, imminently.\\" Azerbaijan drone strikes During the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, UCAVs have been used extensively by Azerbaijan against the de facto Republic of Artsakhhttps://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-10-15/drones- complicates-war-armenia-azerbaijan-nagorno-karabakh.

As the Bayraktar TB2 uses Canadian optics and laser targeting systems, in October 2020 Canada suspended export of its military drone technology to Turkey after allegations that the technology had been used to collect intelligence and direct artillery and missile fire at military positions.

She is one of the most prolific writers currently working in the anime industry. She won the 16th Animation Kobe Award. Retrieved 13 January 2013 Personal life Okada was born in Chichibu. She was often bullied at school and skipped days to deal with social anxiety. After leaving middle school, she would spend most of her time confined at home. In spite of this, her proficiency at writing helped to get her into high school, although her social anxiety remained a problem. Nobody had high hopes for her, and as she was graduating, she was constantly told that she “wouldn't survive in the real world.” Okada enrolled at the Tokyo Amusement Media School to study about games. Career Through her studies, Okada developed a passion for screenwriting, but found it difficult due to anxieties. Her earliest jobs included creating scenarios for direct-to- video pornography and transcribing interviews for a magazine. It was through this latter job that she met Tetsurō Amino, who asked her to contribute some of her ideas for the plot of DT Eightron. She went on to write the script for five episodes, and the connection with Amino helped in kickstarting her career. Okada pitched an idea for her first original anime, based on her experience. The screenplay was never published, but several elements of it would be used in some of her works. After several years, her reputation within the industry had grown considerably, with the screenplay for numerous successful series. Okada wrote the script for her directorial debut anime film Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms. It was well received by critics and was awarded the prize for best animated film at the 21st Shanghai International Film Festival.

Ferrari circa 1927, is the main building of the conservatory The Istanbul University State Conservatory (Turkish: İstanbul Üniversitesi Devlet Konservatuarı) is a music, theatre, dance university in Istanbul. It is the oldest conservatory and the oldest continually operating music school in Turkey. It offers music training from secondary school to doctorate. Its main building in Kadıköy is a historical market hall, and its ground floor houses an active theatre venue. History The State Conservatory has its beginnings in its later sister institution, Darülbedayi (House of Beauty). In 1914, Cemil Topuzlu embarked on an enterprise to establish the imperial school of drama and music, and French actor André Antoine was invited to Istanbul for this purpose. In its initial structure, Darülbedayi would teach performing arts and stage music, as well as European and Turkish music in their respective departments. The institution thus founded, its premises was initially going to be the famous Letafet Apartmanı, a now demolished fin de siècle housing structure. However, with World War I breaking out before its inauguration ceremony, the institution would go on an indefinite hiatus and was shut down entirely by 1916. Plans were made to revitalise the institution and establish a new and independent music school. They would materialise in New Years' Day 1917 as the Darülelhan (House of Melodies), a four-year academy that focused mainly on Turkish music. Following the foundation of the Turkish Republic, Darülelhan would go on a period of restructuring, and would be renamed the Istanbul Conservatory, after the addition of a European-style music department. By the late 1920s, the school was teaching solfège, music theory, harmony, composition, instrumentation and orchestration, music history and instrumental training, among other skills. In these early years, lectures were given in the wooden townhouse that served as the schoolhouse. Performances by the three-piece chamber orchestra started by Cemal Reşit Rey, a member of the later 'Turkish Five', would go on to be quite popular. By the early 1950s, a performing arts department was established, and director Muhsin Ertuğrul began his career at the conservatory as a teacher. In 1986, the conservatory became a school within Istanbul University.  Notable alumni  Ulvi Cemal Erkin, a member of the 'Turkish Five', became a teacher at the conservatory in 1923, at age 17. Since its inception during the late 19th century, the conservatory has had a number of distinguished list of graduates and teachers, including all of the members of the 'Turkish Five': Ahmed Adnan Saygun, Cemal Reşit Rey, Ulvi Cemal Erkin, Hasan Ferit Alnar and Necil Kazım Akses.

The film is about the hard-partying Omega fraternity and their struggles to raise a baby that they find on their doorstep. The film was released in North America by Lionsgate. Plot The morning after a night of binge drinking and patriotic partying, the Omega fraternity awaken to find a baby on their doorstep. After little deliberation, the fraternity members, led by their president Hodges, decide to raise the baby and name him Kegston. In a short period of time raising a baby runs the fraternities finances dry, leading Hodges to seek advice from former Omega president, and current professor at the university Professor Street (played by Jason Mewes). On the verge of losing their baby due to bankruptcy, Pledge, a freshman fraternity member, suggests that the Omega's throw a party to raise funds. Despite Phi Tau Tau, the rival fraternities best attempt to ruin the party, the Omega's raise the funds necessary to keep Kegston only to be hit with the news that no non-students can live in Greek housing. This leads Hodges, along with his fraternity brothers Night Train, 39, and Renato to visit President Dumervile (played by Mindy Sterling). Despite schmoozing the President to the best of their abilities, President Dumervile informs the Omega's that it is too late in the year for her to make any changes, and that \\"rules are rules\\". Days later, with hope dwindling, Night Train, the schools championship running back gets drafted into the NFL and decides to use his money to start a scholarship for babies. The school and President Dumervile then allow Kegston to be a student at the university, foiling Phi Tau Tau's second attempt to rid the Omega's of their newest member. Later in the semester, at the Omega's Spring Formal, Hodges declares Pledge the candidate to succeed him as President of the Omegas. The Omega's hadn't lost a Greek Board election in almost a century, but Rico (played by Joseph Booton), the leader of the Phi Tau Tau's, creates a campaign slandering the Omega's, stating that they kidnapped the baby. Rico and Pledge's presidential contest culminates at the Greek Board debate where Pledge presents a paternity test to President Dumervile stating who the real father of the baby is. Release The Newest Pledge premiered on October 30, 2010 at the New Beverly Cinema in Los Angeles, California. Before its wide release on August 28, 2012, the film screened at the Houston Comedy Film Festival, the Wet Your Pants Comedy Film Festival in Indianapolis, and Indie Fest United States in Garden Grove, California. The film had several private or limited engagement theatrical screenings including a New York City premiere at Cinema Village, a screening at the Dodge College of Film and Media Arts where several key crew members graduated, and a screening at the art house theater in Jason Michael Brescia's home town of Malverne, New York.

While the former are largely viewed as being more or less loyal to the government and Putin,Ben Noble, Putin just won a supermajority in the Duma. That matters., Washington Post (October 1, 2016): \\"During the 2011-2016 parliamentary session, the Kremlin often engineered supermajorities with votes from loyal opposition Duma deputies.\\"Thomas F Remington, Presidential Decrees in Russia: A Comparative Perspective (Cambridge University Press, 2014), p. 44: \\"The 'within-system' opposition parties, such as the communists and A Just Russia, must be willing to play their prescribed role as tame, domesticated versions of a real opposition.\\" the latter oppose the government and are mostly unrepresented in government bodies. Major political parties considered to be part of the non-systemic opposition include Yabloko and the People's Freedom Party (also referred to as PARNAS), along with the unregistered Progress Party. Other notable opposition groups included the Russian Opposition Coordination Council (2012–13) and The Other Russia (2006–11), as well as various non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Their supporters vary in political ideology, ranging from liberals and socialists to nationalists and monarchists as well as apolitical individuals. They are mainly unified by their opposition to President Putin and corruption in the government. However, a lack of unity within the opposition has also hindered its standing.Peter Finn, Infighting Fractures Russian Opposition: Kremlin's Democratic Foes Help Marginalize Themselves With Suspicions, Old Feuds, Washington Post (March 28, 2007).A fourth term for Russia's perpetual president, The Economist (March 19, 2018): \\"a fractured opposition.\\" Furthermore, leading members of the opposition have become targets of violence, including assassinations and harassment, which they allege can be attributed to the government of Vladimir Putin. Opposition figures also claim that a number of laws have been passed and other measures taken by President Putin's government to prevent them from having any electoral success. Background and white-ribbon opposition The White Ribbon \\"For Russia Without Putin\\" Most opposition organizations independent from the Kremlin encounter a restrictive law on political parties, refusals of registration by the Justice Ministry, censorship in major mass media, primarily federal TV channels. According to Vladimir Ryzhkov, \\"over the last 4 years (i.e. from 2007 - Ed.) for identical \\"formal reason\\" nine political parties were denied registration - from left to right. And not any new party was registered. In modern Russia, this is not possible\\".Citation needed. The Guardian reporter Luke Harding noted that during the 2000s Russian nationalists and ultranationalist groups may have been the most significant right-wing opposition to Putin's government. Since 2012 for the protesters for fair elections the term white ribbon opposition has been applied, as they wore white ribbons as their symbol. Actions and campaigns of the opposition Current campaigns of the opposition: *Dissemination of anti-Putin reports: Putin. Results. 10 years (2010), Putin. Corruption (2011), Life of a Slave on Galleys (2012). Video versions of these reports, entitled Lies of Putin’s regime, have been viewed by about 10 million times on the Internet. In addition, smaller-scale series of actions are conducted. For example, in Moscow in the spring of 2012 saw a series of flash mobs \\"White Square\\", when protesters walked through the Red Square with white ribbons, in the late spring and summer, they organized the protest camp \\"Occupy Abay\\" and autumn they held weekly \\"Liberty walks\\" with the chains symbolizing solidarity with political prisoners. A Monstration is a parody demonstration where participants gently poke fun at Kremlin policies. Participation in elections Some opposition figures, for example, chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov, said there are no elections in Putin's Russia, and that participation in a procedure called elections only legitimizes the regime. On the other hand, a small part of liberals (the party of \\"Democratic Choice\\") consider elections as the main tool to achieve their political goals. The system opposition also supports participation in elections. 2009-2011 Strategy-31 Strategy-31 was a series of civic protests in support of the right to peaceful assembly in Russia guaranteed by Article 31 of the Russian Constitution. Since July 31, 2009, the protests were held in Moscow on Triumfalnaya Square on the 31st of every month with 31 days.

The current surge of mass opposition rallies has been called in some publications \\"a snow revolution\\".Андерс Аслунд. Урок для России. Снежная революция не должна повторить ошибки Оранжевой. — KievPost, 22.02.2012 These rallies continued during the campaign for the election of the President of Russia and after March 4, 2012 presidential election, in which Putin officially won the first round. The protesters claimed that the elections were accompanied by violations of the election legislation and widespread fraud. One of the main slogans of the majority of actions was \\"For Fair Elections!\\" and a white ribbon has been chosen as symbol of protests. Beginning from spring 2012 the actions were called marches of millions and took the form of a march followed by a rally. The speeches of participants were anti-Putin and anti-government. The \\"March of Millions\\" on 6 May 2012 at the approach to Bolotnaya Square was dispersed by the police. In the Bolotnaya Square case 17 people are accused of committing violence against police (12 of them are in jail). A large number of human rights defenders and community leaders have declared the detainees innocent and the police responsible for the clashes. For the rally on December 15, 2012, the anniversary of the mass protests against rigged elections, the organizers failed to agree with the authorities, and participation was low. Several thousand people gathered without placards on Lubyanka Square and laid flowers at the Solovetsky Stone. 2014 anti-war protests March for Peace, Moscow, 21 September 2014 In 2014, members of the Russian opposition have held anti-war protests in opposition to Russian military intervention in Ukraine in the aftermath of the 2014 Ukrainian revolution and Crimean crisis. The March of Peace protests took place in Moscow on March 15, a day before the Crimean referendum. The protests have been the largest in Russia since the 2011 protests. Reuters reported that 30,000 people participated in the 15 March anti-war rally. 2017–2018 Russian protests Protest in Nizhny Novgorod, 26 March 2017 On 26 March 2017, protests against alleged corruption in the Russian government took place simultaneously in many cities across the country. The protests began after the release of the film He Is Not Dimon to You by Alexey Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation. An April 2017 Levada poll found that 45% of surveyed Russians supported the resignation of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev,\\"Russian Polls Do Mean Something After All\\". Bloomberg. April 26, 2017. against it 33% of respondents. Newsweek reported that \\"An opinion poll by the Moscow-based Levada Center indicated that 38 percent of Russians supported the rallies and that 67 percent held Putin personally responsible for high-level corruption.\\"\\"Alexei Navalny: Is Russia's Anti-Corruption Crusader Vladimir Putin's Kryptonite?\\". Newsweek. April 17, 2017. A May 2017 Levada poll found that 58% of surveyed Russians supported the protests, while 23% said they disapprove.\\"Акции протеста 12 июня\\". Levada Centre. 13 June 2017 2018 Russian pension protests From July 2018, almost every weekend, protest rallies and demonstrations were organized against the planned retirement age hike. Such events occurred in nearly all major cities countrywide including Novosibirsk, St.-Petersburg and Moscow. These events were coordinated by all opposition parties with the leading role of the communists. Also trade unions and some individual politicians (among whom Navalny) functioned as organizers of the public actions. An intention to hike the retirement age has drastically downed the rating of the President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in Russia. So in July 2018, just 49% would vote for Putin if the presidential elections were held in that moment (while during the elections in March 2018, he got 76,7%).  2019 Russian protests  Moscow rally in support of opposition candidates for the Moscow City Duma. August 10, 2019. In the first half of 2019 there were approximately 863 protests across the country. From July 2019, protest rallies for an access to 2019 Moscow City Duma election of independent candidates started in Moscow. The July 20 rally was the largest since 2012. The July 27 rally set a record in number of detainees and police violence. The August 10 rally outnumbered the July 27 rally, oppositional sources report 50-60 thousand participants.  2020 Khabarovsk Krai protests  On 9 July 2020, the popular governor of the Khabarovsk Krai, Sergei Furgal, who defeated the candidate of Putin's United Russia party in elections two years ago, was arrested and flown to Moscow. Furgal was arrested 15 years after the alleged crimes he is accused of. Every day since June 11, mass protests have been held in the Khabarovsk Krai in support of Furgal. On 25 July, tens of thousands of people were estimated to have taken part in the third major rally in Khabarovsk. The protests included chants of \\"Away with Putin!\\", \\"This is our region\\", \\"Furgal was our choice\\" or \\"shame on LDPR\\" and \\"Shame on the Kremlin!\\" In a Levada Center poll carried out from 24 to 25 July 2020, 45% of surveyed Russians viewed the protests positively, 26% neutrally and 17% negatively.

Stylistic evidence indicates that he was contemporaneous with and a \\"dominant influence\\" among the Sub-krokotos group, and was perhaps a student of Pamphaios. He established his own workshop in Attica with the Athena Painter, and together they specialized in the production of skyphoi, lekythoi, and oinochoai in the black-figure style. Although the more fashionable red-figure style had largely displaced the black-figure style at the turn of the sixth century, his work nonetheless enjoyed a certain measure of popularity, being found as far afield as Thasos to the north, Cyrene to the south, Rhodes to the east, and the far coast of Italy and Sicily to the west.

The bridge crosses on the river just before it enters Lake Burrinjuck, which has been created by the Burrinjuck Dam. The bridge is a key part of the road between Yass and Wee Jasper, and from there, to Tumut. The bridge is located approximately from Yass and from Wee Jasper. The property is owned by Roads and Maritime Services, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. Under the , the bridge was added to the New South Wales State agency heritage register on 18 August 2005.  History  A metal MacDonald truss bridge, also known as the Taemas Bridge, was built , located downriver from the existing Taemas Bridge. In this bridge was raised and extended to with the addition of numerous timber approach spans by the Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission in association with the construction of Burrinjuck Dam. This bridge was destroyed by a flood in May 1925. The local member of the NSW Parliament, Jack Tully, promised to have the destroyed Taemas Bridge replaced as soon as possible. In the interim, the NSW Public Works Department (PWD) established a punt service adjacent to the destroyed bridge until such time as a new bridge could be constructed. The punt remained in operation for almost four years later, until it was swept away in April 1929. A low-level bridge was constructed in 1929, but the water rose and destroyed it that same year. In July 1929, another punt was then established to provide alternative access, and was worked hard carrying wool and other produce.  Description  The site of the current Taemas Bridge was selected by the Public Works Department and is located approximately upriver from the former bridge site. This led to a longer road route, yet enabled a shorter bridge to be constructed in a location were flood levels were expected to be lower. The current bridge was completed in 1931 and is over long. After several years of inaction, the Goodradigbee and Yass councils organised a protest meeting, and the NSW Government asked Tulloch's Phoenix Ironworks in Sydney to order steel for the bridge. Steel members show rolling marks of Dorman Long & Co, so were presumably imported from Middlesbrough, England. Monier Pipe and Reinforced Concrete Works constructed piers and installed the bridge. Once constructed, Gilroy and Robson Ltd gravelled the bridge approaches ready for opening. This two-lane steel through truss bridge spans the Murrumbidgee River in the upper reaches of the Burrinjuck Dam storage. Its height has been set to clear the large floods to which the valley is subjected (and which destroyed its predecessor). The bridge has four main spans and two approach spans. Approach spans are supported by six longitudinal steel beams (or stringers) which in turn support a reinforced concrete deck. There are cross girders at midspan to stabilise the beams. The main spans are , having eight bays in a Pratt truss configuration. Connections are by riveting, and the trusses make extensive use of lattice bracing to produce compound members. Tension members are stabilised by riveted Vierendeel plates. The comparatively narrow deck of the bridge is unsurfaced concrete, edged by kerbs with pipe handrails with infill wire netting. The substantial piers have two cylindrical legs founded on rock with up to three lateral tie beams. The lower sections bell out to larger diameter below the bottom cross beam. Above the upper cross beam the columns are capped with octagonal capitals which support the bridge bearings which are of rocker type. Monumental style is used in the abutments which are of U shape, but with bold corners capped with imposing endposts. The side faces of the abutment and endposts are inclined. The bridge was opened in 1931 and cost A₤60,895. Even after the new bridge was opened some locals still forded the river near the former bridge if they could, to save petrol from the extra distance required by road to reach the new bridge. There is a carpark at the southern end of the bridge, from which the Murrumbidgee River can be accessed.  Heritage listing  The Taemas Bridge has historical, social, technical, aesthetic and representative significance within the Yass-Tumut-Yarrowlumla-Gundagai area. It has provided a crossing of a major waterway, the Murrumbidgee River, for over seventy years and its long term reliability has facilitated the agricultural activities and economies of the surrounding areas. The history of transport in the region has been shaped by the Murrumbidgee and the difficulty of providing crossings of this large and flood prone waterway. The bridge represents a significant technical achievement, its robust design and its positioning, with the site of the former crossing downstream and documentary sources, demonstrate the intelligence, effort and investment required to construct a lasting and reliable crossing of this major and dynamic waterway. The bridge is of aesthetic significance, being an impressive structure of considerable length crossing a major waterway and having landmark qualities on the Yass-Tumut road. The monumental style of the abutments reflects the importance ascribed to the crossing by the Public Works Department and the community. The bridge has local social significance. The loss of the previous bridge in record flood was a major blow to the local community using this important transport and communication route. The community was involved in the debate surrounding the siting of the existing bridge, and continued to express dismay at the lengthy delay in its construction. The bridge is a landmark to which local travellers are likely to attach a sense of place and self. The bridge is a good, intact example of large scale truss design in the early to mid twentieth century. Taemas Bridge over Murrumbidgee River was listed on the New South Wales State agency heritage register on 18 August 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Taemas Bridge is historically significant as an important transport link in the State's south west. It has provided a reliable crossing of a major waterway, the Murrumbidgee River, between the districts of Yass and Tumut for over seventy years. The history of transport in the region has been shaped by the Murrumbidgee and the difficulty of providing crossings of this large and flood prone waterway. The story of the Taemas Bridge, a long-awaited replacement of an equally ambitious bridge washed away in flood, is articulate about the interaction between the communities of the Yass-Tumut area and their environment and also about the efforts and strategies of the government in providing reliable access on important rural transport routes in NSW. The long term reliability of the Taemas bridge has facilitated the agricultural activities and economies of the surrounding areas. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Taemas Bridge represents a significant technical achievement. The design of this robust metal bridge and its positioning, with the site of the former crossing downstream and documentary sources, demonstrate the intelligence, effort and investment required to construct a lasting and reliable crossing of this major and dynamic waterway. The bridge is of aesthetic significance, being an impressive structure of considerable length crossing a major waterway and having landmark qualities on the Yass-Tumut road. The monumental style of the abutments reflects the importance ascribed to the crossing by the Public Works Department and the community. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The bridge has local social significance. The loss of the previous bridge in record flood was a major blow to the local community using this important transport and communication route. The community was involved in the debate surrounding the siting of the existing bridge, and continued to express dismay at the lengthy delay in its construction. The monumental style of the abutments would seem to reflect the importance ascribed to the crossing by the Public Works Department and the community. The bridge is a landmark to which local travellers are likely to attach a sense of place and self. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The bridge is a good, intact example of large scale truss design in the heyday of the rivet.

Prior to the famine in the 1990s, the telegram service usually took less than a week and the government provided bicycles to the offices to ensure delivery. However, during the famine (also called the \\"Arduous March\\"), postal delivery became more and more sporadic due to food, electricity and fuel shortages.

In 1992, the Minister all higher-level officials were fired, with the minister and vice-minister and their families being arrested and sent to prison camps for embezzlement, and wasting funds buying broken fibre optic producing equipment from the UK.

The Gerstlauer dark ride opened in June 2011 as a replacement for the defunct Gremlin Invasion ride. History On 30 June 1996, Warner Bros. Movie World Germany opened with a dark ride named Gremlin Invasion, modelled after the Australian Warner Bros. Movie World's Warner Bros. Classics & Great Gremlins Adventure. On 3 April 2004, Warner Bros. Movie World Germany was acquired by StarParks. This acquisition resulted in various Warner Bros.-licensed properties being removed from the park including DC Comics, Gremlins and Looney Tunes. The following year, Movie Park Germany opened with Gremlin Invasion remaining closed. Wouter Dekkers (2014) On 17 May 2010, the park was acquired by Parques Reunidos. The former Gremlins show building and surrounding area was recognised by the park and its new owners as a negative part of Movie Park Germany. Due to the popularity of the park's Halloween events, Wouter Dekkers, Movie Park Germany's general manager, pitched the idea of a roller coaster with a horror theme to the new owners just one month after the acquisition. Parques Reunidos ultimately approved the ride, investing €5 million to design and build the ride. Within the month, a contract with German-based roller coaster firm Gerstlauer was signed. Movie Park Germany also worked with P&P; Projects, Threshold Animation Studios and TAA Industries to develop the ride's storyline and theming. After just under a year construction Van Helsing's Factory officially opened to the public on 18 June 2011. Characteristics Van Helsing's Factory is a Gerstlauer Bobsled Coaster, characterised by single cars and sharp turns similar to that of a Wild Mouse. Each of the ride's nine cars seats four people in two rows. The ride has a total length of . Riders reach heights of up to and speeds of up to . The roller coaster is enclosed in a building. The track itself is situated on a base frame with two anchor points as opposed to a conventional roller coaster with foundations. This frame measures . The track is filled with sand, allowing for a comparatively quiet ride. Van Helsing's Factory is themed after the fictional Abraham Van Helsing, originally from Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula. Movie Park Germany chose this theme due to the lack of intellectual property restrictions on the work. The outside of the building is themed to a 1950s American garage. The inside of the show building is themed to the factory where Van Helsing prepares his cars for vampire hunting. Ride experience One of the highly themed cars used on Van Helsing's Factory at the station Riders enter Van Helsing's Factory from the Streets of New York section of Movie Park Germany. The outside of the building is themed to a 1950s American garage with the storyline taking place in the 1960s. The queue line and pre-shows inform guests that they are touring Van Helsing's Factory. Once riders reach the station they are recruited on a vampire hunt and must board one of Van Helsing's cars. After being dispatched the ride slowly moves around a series of turns before ascending the chain lift hill. The ride drops down a spiraling turn to the right before crossing under the first lift hill. It then goes through a banked turnaround before navigating through several Wild Mouse-style unbanked turns. A second lift hill follows, however, this hill is propelled by drive tires allowing for the cars to accelerate whilst climbing the hill. A number of left hand turns follow this lift hill before the cars enter the final brake run. The cars then return to the station where riders are informed that their mission is complete.

The company was founded as Majesco Sales in Edison, New Jersey in 1986, and was a privately held company until acquiring operation-less company ConnectivCorp in a reverse merger takeover, becoming its subsidiary and thus a public company on December 5, 2003. ConnectivCorp later changed its name to Majesco Holdings Inc. on April 13, 2004. On December 1, 2016, Majesco Entertainment was acquired by PolarityTE, Inc., a biotech company, in another reverse merger takeover, because of which it formally ceased all video game operations on December 8, 2016. In mid-2017, chief executive officer Jesse Sutton re- acquired the company through a management buyout and continued operating it privately held. In January 2018, Liquid Media Group announced the acquisition of Majesco. History Majesco was first known as a reissuer of old titles that had been abandoned by their original publisher. By cutting the prices and eventually arranging the rights to self-manufacture games for both Nintendo and Sega systems, the company found a sustainable market niche. Later, Majesco arranged with Sega to manufacture a version of its Genesis (known as Mega Drive outside North America) 16-bit console, which had been superseded by the 32-bit Saturn. It released this in 1998 as the Genesis 3 and followed up with a version of the handheld Game Gear called the Game Gear Core System. The company's focus shifted to in-house game development, initially under the brand Pipe-Dream Interactive since few believed they could make the transition successfully. Majesco focused on developing for console systems, such as Nintendo's GameCube and Game Boy Advance, Microsoft's Xbox, and Sony's PlayStation 2. A few of the titles it released, involving popular characters, included a few Bomberman titles for the Gamecube and Game Boy Advance. Majesco also published PC games with Terminal Reality as the developer, such as BloodRayne and BloodRayne 2. In 2003, Majesco was slated to publish Black9, but producers forced the developers, Taldren, Inc., to shut down when the game was about 85% complete. The publisher had reached financial trouble with its larger-budget games, such as Psychonauts, which sold poorly although receiving several awards and critical acclaim, and Advent Rising, which generated intense hype but was ultimately panned by critics for being released prematurely and without adequate bug testing. Its best-selling titles in the last few years have been the series of GBA Videos for the Game Boy Advance. It also published the game Jaws Unleashed. On January 19, 2006, the company's financial situation worsened to the degree that it had to cancel two games it was going to publish: Demonik, developed by Terminal Reality, and Taxi Driver, a sequel to the movie. Majesco's president, Jesse Sutton, said that in the future the company would \\"focus primarily on publishing value and handheld video games.\\" Since that announcement, the company has followed through with publishing successful budget titles in North America like Cooking Mama for the DS. On September 14, 2006, Majesco released Advent Rising and re-released BloodRayne and BloodRayne 2 on Steam. On November 6, 2007, Majesco announced the opening of a new development facility in the Los Angeles area dedicated to the development of casual game products and properties. On December 10, 2007, Majesco announced that they would be publishing a rhythm-based game, Major Minor's Majestic March, exclusively for the Wii developed by NanaOn-Sha. Majesco has announced that it will be launching an internet version of Bananagrams on August 18, 2008 that will be available on Facebook, a social networking website. On November 4, 2009, Majesco released BloodRayne and BloodRayne 2 on GOG.com. On June 6, 2011, Majesco announced that it was acquiring the assets of social game developer Quick Hit and Quick Hit Football to build out its social gaming strategy. In August 2013, Majesco announced the creation of an indie publishing label, Midnight City, in order to bring various indie games to consoles. After a disastrous fiscal year of 2013, the company was expected to enjoy a recovering growth in 2014. However, this proved incorrect, as they continued to lose large amounts of money in 2014, resulting in the closure of Midnight City and the cancellation of the console port of Gone Home. In August 2015, Majesco announced that they had appointed a new CEO, and that only five employees would remain in the company. The company's focus also shifted to develop mobile and downloadable titles. Two new titles, Glue and a new installment in the A Boy and His Blob franchise, were announced after the reconstruction. In December 2016, Majesco announced it was ceasing operations in the entertainment industry, and merged with biotech firm PolarityTE. Polarity will obtain Majesco's NASDAQ symbol name, COOL. In June 2017, PolarityTE divested itself entirely of and subsequently sold, Majesco Entertainment's assets, which were subsequently taken private, leading to the rebirth of the company as an independent corporation. In November 2017, Majesco announced that it had re-entered the video game business after having previously been brought back to a privately held company, release their Romans from Mars onto Steam. On January 15, 2018, 51 percent of Majesco was bought by Liquid Media Group, and Jesse Sutton became LMG's Gaming Advisor. In June 2020, Ziggurat Interactive purchased a number of IP formerly owned by Majesco Entertainment, including the rights to BloodRayne, Advent Rising, and Raze's Hell. On the same day, Ziggurat announced that the PC release of BloodRayne would receive updates to improve compatibility with current-day systems, with updates done by original developer Terminal Reality. They also announced plans to continue the franchise.

He was awarded the 1967 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing. Early life Patterson was born in Valdosta, Georgia, the son of Annabel Corbett, a schoolteacher, and William C. Patterson, a bank cashier.https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/us/eugene-c-patterson-editor-and- civil-rights-crusader-dies-at-89.html After the bank at which his father worked was closed in the course of the Great Depression, the family moved to a small farm near Adel, Georgia. The house had no running water or electricity, and was heated only by the fireplace. With his father able to get only occasional employment at local banks, the family was primarily supported by his mother's work as a teacher and her running the farm. As a teenager, Patterson began to work on weekends at the local journal, the Adel News. He edited a campus newspaper at North Georgia College at Dahlonega, Georgia where he studied for his freshman year. He graduated with a journalism degree from the University of Georgia in 1943. After graduation, he served as a tank commander in the United States Army General George Patton's, 10th Armored Division, 90th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron, First Platoon, C Troop during World War II and won a Silver Star for gallantry in action at the Battle of the Bulge and a Bronze Star with oak leaf cluster for heroic achievement. The 10th Armored, CCB at Bastogne, held off the German Army onslaught for eight hours awaiting the arrival of the 101st Airborne Division to fully stop the offensive. He served as an Army pilot after the war until he left the military to pursue journalism in 1947. Journalism career Patterson's first jobs were with the Temple Daily Telegram and the Macon Telegraph. After working for United Press from 1948 to 1956, he was appointed vice president and executive editor of the joint journals, the Atlanta Journal and the Constitution, both now merged into the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Patterson wrote a signed newspaper editorial every day for eight years. An editorial he wrote in 1963, A Flower for the Graves, was considered so moving that he was asked to read it on live television by Walter Cronkite, the leading news anchorman of the era. The editorial was in response to the notorious church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama which killed four black girls, all under the age of 15. He was once approached by the FBI, who wanted him to write an article about Martin Luther King Jr.'s alleged infidelities which they had uncovered through wiretaps. Patterson told them \\"We're not a peephole journal. We don't print that kind of stuff.\\" Patterson was appointed managing editor of The Washington Post in 1968. After the Nixon administration had blocked the New York Times from the continued publication of the Pentagon Papers, which revealed how President Lyndon Johnson had withheld information about the progress of the nation's waging of the Vietnam War from the United States Congress, he was responsible for the Post's publication of the documents. After teaching at Duke University in the 1971 school semester, he was president of the Times Publishing Company and appointed editor of the St. Petersburg Times, now the Tampa Bay Times, which reached the top ten of major American newspapers during his tenure, the former St. Petersburg Evening Independent, and the Congressional Quarterly. Patterson later become president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. He was also known for his strong stand on ethics, even where it concerned himself. After being charged with driving while intoxicated, he told his staff to cover the story on the first page. That way he could tell anyone \\"I put myself on Page 1, so you can't ask me not to put you there\\". He took a strong stand opposing the execution of John Spenkelink in 1979. He even called the Governor of Florida, Bob Graham, at 2 A.M., with a personal appeal to commute the sentence. To his disappointment, despite this, it was carried out, the first in Florida in 15 years. In 2002, historian Raymond Arsenault published a biography and analysis of Patterson's impact.Arsenault, Raymond and Roy Peter Clark, Eds. (2002).

Description It consists of four buildings and a cemetery, located on just south of Zell in Hand County. All four buildings (a church, convent, and two rectory houses) are wood frame structures built between 1883 and 1910. The oldest building, the three-story convent school, was built in 1883, and is the mother site of the Benedictine Sisters in the state. It has a fire shoot attached to one of the upper floors to allowed escape in case of a fire. Most of the children spoke German and were taught English. The convent school served the community until 1963, when upgrades to comply with the fire code became cost prohibitive. The church was designed by Joseph Schwartz, one of the first architects to live and work in the state, and was built in Victorian Gothic Revival style in 1905. The site is privately owned. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. History In 1874, five sisters from the monastery of Maria-Rickenbach in Switzerland, led by Mother Gertrude Leupi, came to Maryville, Missouri where Father Adelhelm Odermatt O.S.B. was engaged in parish work. Mother Gertrude established Sacred Heart Convent there. In 1883, Bishop Martin Marty, apostolic vicar of the Dakota Territory, asked the sisters for assistance in ministering to the people.

It was built around 1900 in a Rural Gothic style and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. History During the late 1800s and the early 1900s the large Indian Reservation given to the Lakota was reduced in size and opened for settlement by white homesteaders. The Milwaukee Road railroad was being built and many \\"homesteaders\\" traveled on it to the northwest South Dakota area.Lance Christiansen, DO., grandson of Knut K. Johnson one of the founders of the Golden Valley Lutheran Church Harding/Perkins Counties, South Dakota, USA. Numerous Norwegian people homesteaded in the area around the years of 1902 through 1910 and there were many ethnic enclaves adjacent to each other, including a Ukrainian settlement and German settlement. Eventually, the Norwegians built a sod church building, and its remains can still be noted along the highway from Reeder, North Dakota (about 12 miles to the south near a prominent curve of the road south of Grassy Buttte). The local Norwegian community decided to build another church building after the first one became \\"weathered,\\" and it was built by volunteer labor and funds by the men of the local Norwegian community. The church was the social center of the community as well as the religious center with ice cream socials, performances with local people, and musical events with instruments and singing.Lance Christiansen, DO., grandson of Knut K. Johnson one of the founders of the Golden Valley Lutheran Church Harding/Perkins Counties, South Dakota, USA. As the economy improved and farms became larger and more efficient, fewer people resided in the area surrounding the Golden Valley Church. Eventually, not enough attendees remained to support the church, and so it closed around the late 1960s. The property on which the church stands remained titled in the name of the family who donated its use for the church before 1921. Eventually, the land was purchased by Kit and Barbara Johnson, and after Kit's death it passed in whole to Barbara. She and her son now independently operate the farm surrounding the church and the church building is largely controlled by the family. An organization has been established to help preserve the church building with support from the Christiansen, Johnson, and Howe families.Lance Christiansen, DO., grandson of Knut K. Johnson one of the founders of the Golden Valley Lutheran Church Harding/Perkins Counties, South Dakota, USA. The church now stands alone on the gently sloping side of Grassy Butte with a beautiful view of the surrounding area.

Taxi! () is a 2013 Singaporean comedy film based on the 2010 work Diary Of A Taxi Driver by Cai Mingjie, said to be \\"Singapore's most well-educated taxi-driver\\". Directed by Kelvin Sng and produced by Chan Pui Yin and Chan Yan Yan for SIMF Management, the film stars Mark Lee, Gurmit Singh and YouTube personality Chua Jin Sen, better known by his online handle \\"Dr. Jia Jia\\". It is Chua's professional film debut. The film follows two fellow taxi-drivers' (Lee and Singh) quest for self-discovery. Distributed by Golden Village Pictures, the film was commercially released in Singapore on January 3, 2013 and slated for a January 24, 2013 release in Malaysia. Plot In the film's prelude, PhD microbiologist Professor Chua See Kiat (Gurmit Singh) is hanging out on a rooftop when a cab-driver named Ah Tau (Mark Lee) mistook him for attempting suicide. This leads to Ah Tau receiving a fine for illegal parking. After several attempts to find a new job, Professor Chua See Kiat had no choice but to resort to cab driving. Ah Tau volunteers to help him and became his first passenger. Soon, Ah Tau was then fined again for another illegal parking incident. When Professor Chua was picking his mother-in-law from the airport, he happened to get into a taxi that was driven by Ah Tau, whose son was also in the taxi. Ah Tau then started talking about Professor Chua's new career as a taxi driver, almost revealing it to his wife and mother-in-law who were not aware of this beforehand. This caused a strain on Ah Tau and Professor Chua's friendship. The movie shows the difficulties encountered by Professor Chua as he faces difficult customers including one that refused to pay their taxi fare. Ah Tau helps him by recording the scene and gets himself punched by the gangsters. The gangsters are then caught and Professor Chua gives Ah Tau a mobile phone to thank him. However he is yet to face his wife who is crying. He then explains the situation to her as she promises not to tell anyone about his new job. When Chua's son found out about his taxi driving when he inadvertently picked his girlfriend and him up as passengers, his son decides not to talk to him. Ah Tau also got into a family scuffle for showing Jiajia edited pictures of his long lost mother. Jiajia realizes that Ah Tau and Regina had both edited it, causing Jiajia to stop talking to his father. The two share their grievances and decide to help each other in the future. The next day, Chua found his mum missing from the house and decides to mobilise all the taxi drivers to find her successfully, giving him a better understanding of the 'taxi culture . Chua also helps Ah Tau by improving his son's English and tries to find a suitable school for him. While Ah Tau sets a date with Regina, he is caught by a policeman (Chua En Lai) who gives a longwinded 'speech' about the perils of an illegal U-turn. His taxi runs out of fuel and he is forced to take another taxi before being caught by the same policeman as he repeats the same 'speech'. Regina feels that Ah Tau isn't worth the wait and stomps off into the streets, leading into a car accident. While she is in hospital, she finds out that her vision was impaired and she is unable to fulfill her dream to be a fashion designer. This leads to her attempting suicide on the hospital's roof. Chua explains the situation Regina is in to Ah Tau, who is in the middle of his son's performance. While he is on his way, Chua tells Regina his story of being a cab driver, which then calms her down and changed her mind about the suicide. It is recorded as his son watches it live. A few years later, Chua's son begins idolizing his father again. While Chua regains his job as a professor, he still wants to continue his taxi driving. Regina became a DJ as she falls in love with Ah Tau. The film ends with Chua and Ah Tau driving off into the distance. Cast * Mark Lee as Lee Ah Tau, a veteran \\"Ah Beng\\" taxi driver * Gurmit Singh as Professor Chua See Kiat, a retrenched microbiologist * Royston Ong as Jonah Chua, Chua See Kiat's son * Jazreel Low as Chua See Kiat's wife. Director Kelvin Sng stated that he chose her for the role as: * Lai Meng as Chua See Kiat's mother-in-law * Chua Jin Sen as Lee Jia Jia, Lee Ah Tau's son. It is his film debut. Sng said of him: * Chua En Lai as a policeman * Gan Mei Yan as Lee Ah Tau's tenant, Regina. Production=Development= Inspiration was largely drawn from real life blogger Cai Mingjie's personal recounts in his 2010 best selling work, Diary of a Taxi Driver: True Stories From Singapore's Most Educated Cabdriver. Boris Boo, Lee Chee Tian and Violet Lai served as screenwriters. Boo, Rebecca Leow, Chan and Sng were credited with writing the story. Chua Jin Sen (better known as Dr Jia Jia)'s involvement in the project kindled public interest. His participation in the film was first mentioned by his mother in June 2012, who told Yahoo! Singapore: She also gave some details about his role, but a confidentiality agreement prevented her from stating more at that time. Greater details about the film were disclosed at a July 2012 press conference, where director Kelvin Sng said [relating to Chua's role]: Taxi! Taxi! is the first on-screen pairing of Gurmit Singh and Mark Lee since their 2001 collaboration, One Leg Kicking. Singh attributed this to the \\"lack of suitable scripts\\". It is Singh's first feature-length film since Phua Chu Kang The Movie (2010). Taxi! Taxi! also marks the comeback of former actress Jazreel Low. =Financing and filming= Financers for Taxi! Taxi! included SIMF Management, Galaxy Entertainment, sglanded.net, Widescreen Media, RAM Entertainment and PMP Entertainment. With a budget of S$1 million, production commenced on July 12, 2012. Actual filming begun on July 16, 2012. A particular scene required Chua to be shot from various angles, resulting in many takes. This reportedly made Chua feel frustrated. His mother said of the scenario: Reception=Box office= Commercially released in Singaporean cinemas on January 3, 2013, Taxi! Taxi! grossed S$592,000 in its opening weekend. In total it took in $1.45 million, making it the second-highest grossing Singaporean film of 2013, after Ah Boys to Men 2. =Critical response= Film magazine F* Raphael Lim dubbed the film as \\"run of the mill\\", giving it only 2 out of 5 stars. Writing for my paper was Boon Chan, who gave the film a rating of 2.5. He wrote that \\"their [Lee and Singh's] much-vaunted chemistry has been overhyped.\\" Awards and nominations Taxi! Taxi! was chosen as Singapore's first official entry for the 1st Asean International Film Festival and Awards (Abbreviation: AIFFA) 2013, to be held in Kuching, Sarawak, Malaysia, from March 28–30, 2013.

Sports Direct started trading in 1982 with a single brick-and-mortar store but has recently grown rapidly aided by a bricks and clicks business model. Bricks and clicks (aka clicks and bricks; click and mortar; bricks, clicks and flips; ''chinchs and funchs'' or WAMBAM ('Web Application Meets Bricks and Mortar') is a jargon term for a business model by which a company integrates both offline (bricks) and online (clicks) presences, sometimes with the third extra flips (physical catalogs). Additionally, many will also offer telephone ordering and mobile phone apps, or at least provide telephone sales support. The advent of mobile web has made businesses operating bricks and clicks businesses especially popular, because it means customers can do tasks like shopping when they have spare time and do not have to be at a computer. Many of these users prefer to use mobile shopping sites. A popular example of the bricks and clicks model is when a chain of stores allows the customer to order products either online or physically in one of their stores, also allowing them to either pick-up their order directly at a local branch of the store or get it delivered to their home. There are many alternative combinations of this model. The success of the model in many sectors has lessened the credibility of some analysts who argued that the Internet would render traditional retailers obsolete through disintermediation. History A Tesco delivery van in Poland advertising online ordering and delivery from a brick- and-mortar store. Tesco started their online presence in 1996. One of the first known purchases from a company arguably operating a bricks and clicks business model was a Pizza Hut pizza ordered over the internet in 1994. The great surge in adoption of the bricks and clicks model came around 2000, with large retailers such as Wal-Mart starting websites that allow users to browse the same goods they would find in store from the comfort of their homes. Advantages=For companies= Safeway delivery truck illustrates how some traditional supermarkets are now pursuing a bricks and clicks strategy. The bricks and clicks model has typically been used by traditional retailers who have extensive logistics and supply chains, but are well known and often respected for their traditional physical presence. Part of the reason for its success is that it is far easier for a traditional retailer to establish an online presence than it is for a start-up company to employ a successful purely online one, or for an online only retailer to establish a traditional presence, including a strong and well recognised brand, without having a large marketing budget. It can also be said that adoption of a bricks and clicks model where a customer can return items to a brick and mortar store can reduce wasted costs to a business such as shipping for undelivered and returned items that would traditionally be incurred. =For consumers= A bricks and clicks business model can benefit various members of a customer base. For example, supermarkets often have different customer types requiring alternative shopping options; one group may wish to see the goods directly before purchase and like the convenience of quickly shopping on-the-fly, while another group may require a different convenience of shopping online and getting the order delivered when it suits them, having a bricks and clicks model means both customer groups are satisfied. Other previously online-only retailers have stated that they have found benefit in adding a brick-and-mortar presence to their online-only business, as customers can physically see and test products before purchase as well as get advice and support on any purchases they have made. Additionally, consumers are likely to feel safer and have more confidence using a bricks-and-clicks business if they already know the brand from a brick-and-mortar store. Disadvantages=For firms= A major factor in the success or failure of this business model is in the control of costs, as usually maintaining a physical presence —paying for many physical store premises and their staffing— requires larger capital expenditure which online only businesses do not usually have. Conversely, a business selling more luxurious, often expensive, or only occasionally purchased products —like cars— may find sales are more common with a physical presence, due to the more considered nature of the purchasing decision, though they may still offer online product information. However, some car manufacturers such as Dacia have introduced online configurators that allow a customer to configure and order complete cars online, only going to a dealership to collect the completed car, which has proven popular with customers. \\"On the other hand, an online-only service can remain a best-in-class operation because its executives focus on just the online business.\\" It has been argued that a bricks and clicks business model is more difficult to implement than an online only model. In the future, the bricks and clicks model may be more successful, but in 2010 some online only businesses grew at a staggering 30%, while some bricks and clicks businesses grew at a paltry 3%. The key factor for a bricks and clicks business model to be successful \\"will, to a large extent, be determined by a company’s ability to manage the trade-offs between separation and integration\\" of their retail and online businesses. =For consumers= *Some argue that online shopping, which makes price comparison easier for customers, encourages a 'race-to-the-bottom', where retailers only compete on price, with quality and service deteriorating as a result. This is especially prevalent when comparison shopping websites such as mySupermarket allow prices to be compared without even visiting a retailer's website. *The prices listed online may not match the prices listed offline. The reasons for this include mis-management, and economics (overhead cost of an online purchase and an offline purchase is different). This may result in confusion and deviations of expectations for the buyers. *Buyers may end up buying more items than they need, because online businesses are able to show them more items, more promotions, and more advertisements. Legislation An advantage to the consumer and a potential disadvantage to businesses is that by adopting a bricks and clicks business model and allowing customers to purchase goods or services remotely, it is legislated in many jurisdictions that consumers are granted more rights to protect them. In the UK, for example, any goods purchased from a bricks and clicks business over a 'click and collect' service would allow the buyer protection under the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000, namely the right to return a product or cancel a service within 14 days of purchase for a full refund. Similar rights are afforded to EU Residents, who gain protection under European Directive 97/7/EC. In the USA, the Federal Trade Commission legislate specifically over how a distance sale should be conducted and the rights that a consumer has, namely a '3 day' rule allowing items ordered over the web to be returned within three days. An example of a retailer falling foul of this legislation is British clothing retailer Next, who were found to be breaking the laws by only allowing a customer to return goods that they had ordered if they paid return postage costs. Notable examples In the UK, the method is known as \\"Click and Collect\\". This term was invented by British retailer Argos who already offered \\"Ring and Reserve\\" and \\"Text and Take Home\\" offerings for telephone and SMS ordering respectively, where goods would be held so the customer would pay in store. As these existing services used alliterations for their name, they needed a name for their online ordering proposition and came up with Click and Collect. British retailer John Lewis has found success in adopting a bricks and clicks business model, with the online ordering service outperforming brick and mortar sales for several years running. Online auction website eBay have also launched a scheme in cooperation with catalogue shop Argos that allows goods sold by third parties to be collected in a brick-and-mortar location, which allows the customer to collect goods at their convenience rather than wait at home for a delivery company. In 2013, music retailer HMV went into administration despite having operated both brick-and-mortar stores and an online presence. This was put down by many to the high overheads of operating the brick-and-mortar side of the business making HMV unable to compete with pure-clicks retailers such as Amazon.com.

Daggett, 462 U.S. 725 (1983), was a United States Supreme Court case involving the legality of redistricting, and possibly gerrymandering, in the state of New Jersey..  Background  The New Jersey Legislature adopted a redistricting plan which resulted in a one percent population difference between the largest and smallest districts. Several citizens came forward and challenged the legislation, claiming it violated Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution. The district court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and determined the law to be unconstitutional. The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court. The \\"equal representation\\" standard of Article I, Section 2 requires districts to be apportioned to population equality to the closest possible degree. The population differences here could have been avoided with a good faith effort to achieve population equality. The Court found that the defendants did not meet their burden of proving that the deviations in their plan were necessary to achieve a consistent, nondiscriminatory redistricting. The State had to prove specifically how and why the specific deviations of its plan were for an objective to benefit the system. The defendant tried to prove that the justification for the high deviations was to preserve voting strength of minority groups. However, the court believed that the state could not prove that the population disparities preserved the voting strength of these minority groups.  Opinion of the Court  The Supreme Court upheld the district courts decision based on the plaintiffs' evidence of districts not drawn in \\"good faith,\\" and the state's failure to offer a legitimate reason for the population deviations exceeding minimum possible as required by Article I, section 2 of the Constitution. The dissenters thought that the population deviations—which were less than the margin of error for the census itself—was not the appropriate grounds for the holding and asserted that the districts should be ruled unconstitutional as a blatant political gerrymander. Justice Stevens's concurring 5th vote held both grounds were valid. The State was compelled to enact a new redistricting plan that followed smaller population deviations of district size. Of note, precisely the same Court ruled political gerrymanders were justiciable three years later in Davis v. Bandemer.  Analysis  The case is usually cited for its holding that there is no de minimis deviation for population inequality between districts, and that all deviations must be justified by a legitimate governmental interest (such as geographic features or preserving communities-of-interest). However, the case is the earliest Court rejection of a political gerrymander—though Justice Brennan's approach does not require holding on those grounds. In addition, the case is a prime example of the tie between the McDonnell-Douglas burden-shifting framework and redistricting law.

The building was designed by Godfrey E. Larson, a Chicago architect who later worked as a field representative for the Public Works Administration. The apartment was built in the Spanish Baroque Revival style, which can be seen in the pilasters and swan's-neck pediment in its entryway and the two windows designed to resemble balconies. While many six-flat apartments were constructed in West Ridge and neighboring Rogers Park in the 1920s, the Anderson–Carlson Building is the only one designed in the Spanish Baroque Revival style and one of the few with a highly detailed design.

It was directed by Jeff Richmond and written by Lang Fisher and Nina Pedrad. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on January 24, 2013. The episode received a positive critical response and was watched by 3.81 million viewers. Plot Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) and Criss receive a message from Bev at the adoption agency, informing them that their children will arrive at the airport in a few days. Liz has other things on her mind however, as she prepares for a meeting with the Kabletown board to try and convince them to save TGS. In desperation, she orders her writing team to roll out their best work, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) and Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) to conduct publicity and Pete to slash the budget. Ultimately, they decide that they need a sponsor who is willing to be associated with the show, despite the controversy from Hazel's lawsuit. With no takers, Liz resorts to visiting an organisation called Bro Body Douche who agree to sponsor the show, but only if it is retitled Man Cave and Liz adopts the nom de plume Todd Debeikis to hide the fact that she is a woman. Liz accepts and returns to work, receiving a phone call from Criss, who is annoyed that she is neglecting to join him to buy toys for their children. However, she is distracted once again when she discovers that the writers have done nothing, and that Tracy and Jenna have used their press time to instead promote Heads of State, a movie they are going to make together about interracial conjoined twins of different genders serving as United States co-Presidents. Meanwhile, new Kabletown CEO Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) prepares to pick his replacement as president of NBC. He devises an unconventional plan, adapted from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, promoting Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) back into his old page role with orders to give a tour of the building to the final five candidates for the job. He reveals to Kenneth that the candidates think the tour is just a formality before the final interview, but that it is in fact the final interview, since the best time to judge a person is when they don't know they're being judged. Fittingly, the candidates themselves are all references to characters in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory too (e.g. Mike Webb, who is looking at his smartphone in reference to Mike Teavee, a boy who does nothing but watch television; Veruca Saline; a morbidly obese Augustus [Gloop], and a gum- chewing woman dressed like Violet Beauregarde). Kenneth immediately bonds with one candidate, Charlie MacGuffin, after the pair simultaneously refer to a joke that had appeared on the Today Show earlier that day. As the tour progresses, MacGuffin's passion for and knowledge about the history of the network convinces Kenneth that he is the man for the job. Jack, however, becomes annoyed with Kenneth for interfering and dismisses him from the tour. Finally, as the board meeting approaches, Liz receives another phone call from Criss, who tells her that Bev made a mistake, and that the children are arriving at the airport later that afternoon. Liz once again prioritizes TGS, but is overheard by Tracy, Jenna and the crew. Finally, after seven years, everybody decides to step up and help Liz in the only way they have left—by informing the board that they are all quitting, and telling Liz to go and meet her children. As a final test for MacGuffin, Kenneth masquerades as a CBS executive, C.B. Essington, and (in reference to Arthur Slugworth) attempts to bribe him with money if he will go to Jack's office and steal an in- development script. MacGuffin refuses, convincing Kenneth once and for all that he is the right man to take over NBC. However, it transpires that MacGuffin's true reason for being so knowledgeable about NBC is that he is going to strip it for parts and turn the building into a Forever 21, since both he and Jack believe broadcast television has had its day. Kenneth argues that a network president needs to care about television, and not just the bottom line, and that MacGuffin is not right for the role, and neither was Jack. Later, Kenneth comes to Jack's office to resign from his role as page, but Jack surprises him by admitting that he was right: television is an unconventional medium, nearly every program he developed himself has failed, and the best skill for leading the network is, seemingly, loving television. For this reason, he has decided that the best candidate to be the new president is, in fact, Kenneth. At the airport, Liz and Criss meet their adopted children, Terry and Janet—a pair of interracial twins whose personalities and physical appearances closely resemble those of Tracy and Jenna. Liz muses happily that this \\"seems about right\\" and she embraces the pair. Reception \\"A Goon's Deed in a Weary World\\" was watched by 3.81 million viewers and earned a 1.4 rating/4 share in the 18–49 demographic. This means that it was seen by 1.4 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds and 4 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This was an increase from the previous episode \\"Florida\\" (3.44 million), and a season high in total viewers. Critical response for \\"A Goon's Deed in a Weary World\\" has been positive. Pilot Viruet of The A.V. Club gave the episode an \\"A\\" and described it as “... an absolutely fantastic episode of television. It was an episode that was full of nonstop jokes, one that featured some genuinely emotional moments that caught me off guard, and one that was so much fun to watch that I immediately watched it a second time as soon as it was over.\\" IGN's Roth Cornet also gave the episode a positive review, saying \\"There are likely things that I could nitpick about the episode here and there. I’d rather not, though. Overall, this would have made for a fine conclusion to the 30 Rock journey, and at the end of the day, I am simply savoring the last moments of a series that has proved to be unfailingly smart, uniquely funny and deservedly [...] sweet.\\" Alan Sepinwall, writing for HitFix, wrote the episode a glowing review, noting that the episode \\"... would have functioned quite well as a series finale\\" and that \\"it's not that it was the funniest episode of this victory lap season [...], but that it brought very satisfying closure to the stories of Liz Lemon and Jack Donaghy. As great as the 30 Rock supporting cast and recurring players have been, this has always been a show about the two of them, and here they got what amounted to the perfect happy endings for their characters.\\" However, Amy Amatangelo of Paste magazine described the episode as \\"just OK\\" and gave it a moderately positive rank of 7.9 out of 10, noting her high expectations for the final season and describing the series quality as still \\"on top of its game.\\" Alec Baldwin submitted this episode for consideration due to his nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards.

Founding members Dave W. (guitar & vocals) and Ego Sensation (bass & vocals) have been the only constant members. They are known for being one of the most prolific bands of their generation, recording over 40 separate releases including 7 full-length studio albums. Their music strikes “a riveting balance between heaviness and ethereality” combining elements of krautrock, post-punk, art rock, goth, psychedelic rock, metal, stoner rock, ambient and experimental music. They are often compared to Iggy Pop and the Stooges, Pink Floyd, Hawkwind, MC5 and Spiritualized. Biography The band is currently signed to Thrill Jockey Records whose artist roster also includes Future Islands, Wooden Shjips, Tortoise, The Sea and Cake, Matmos, Liturgy and Trans Am. The band's first album, No Game To Play, was a solo recording project by Dave W released in 2005. Julian Cope issued a limited remix of the album as They’ve Got Blood Like We’ve Got Blood on his Fuck Off and Di label. The band's next album Glitter Glamour Atrocity (self-released) garnered the attention of Stewart Lee from the Sunday London Times creating sudden visibility for the group. Shortly after, UK label Rocket Recordings (Goat, Teeth of the Sea, GNOD) asked the band to record a third album. The band recorded Heads on Fire, the title track of which did not make it onto the album but appears on the tour-only CD-r Oddity II- Night Scene On Mill Mountain. Rocket went on to release a split 12” with WHITE HILLS and The Heads and a collaboration between WHITE HILLS and GNOD before the band signed with Thrill Jockey in 2009. Upon signing to Thrill Jockey in 2009, the label released the 12” EP Dead followed a few months later by the band's self-titled album. Recorded at the Ocropolis in Brooklyn, Oneida’s now extinct recording studio, the album features Kid Millions on drums and was reportedly recorded over three days. The band went on to record their career-defining H-p1 at the Ocropolis. Hailed as “quite possibly the finest album of space rock”, H-p1 has been described as a “work of science fiction”, the band citing Abstract Expressionist art as muse and a concern for “societal ills like consumerism and corporate control of government” as motivation. The title's meaning, according to Dave W, “is the name I have given to this disease of greed…that plagues our time…in the same way that scientists name viruses.” The band's next two full-length albums Frying On This Rock (2012) and So You Are…So You’ll Be (2013) were recorded with Nick Ferrante on drums by Martin Bisi at BC Studios in Brooklyn. Bisi, well known for his work with Sonic Youth, Swans, The Dresden Dolls, Herbie Hancock and John Zorn among others, helped the band achieve crisper tones than on their previous releases. Their discography covers a wide expanse of sonic ground. Dave W, the principle lyricist for the band, has cited Jim Carroll and Buckminster Fuller as inspirations and has been quoted as saying, “I’m very conscious about making the records sound very different from each other.” The band has several live releases in their discography including the full-length album Live At Roadburn from their performance in 2011 and a Scion released 10” split with Earthless from their 2012 performance at the Roxy in Los Angeles. In Fall of 2014, the band convened in Bethesda, Wales at Bryn Derwyn studio to record an album with producer David Wrench, best known for his work with Caribou and FKA twigs. The album Walks For Motorists was released in April 2015. In May 2017, their album Stop Mute Defeat was released. White Hills' live shows feature dramatic lighting and the usage of a fog machine. Previous auxiliary (recording / touring) members include: Antronhy (drums, various instruments), Nick Name (drums), Bob Bellomo (drums), Daved Pankenier, Kid Millions, Shazzula, and Pierre Auntour. They have shared stages with bands such as MONO, The Flaming Lips, Sleepy Sun, Cloudland Canyon, Mudhoney, Akron/Family, Monster Magnet, Oneida, Pontiak, and The Cult. Movie Credits Legendary independent filmmaker Jim Jarmusch became a fan of WHITE HILLS after inviting the band to perform at the All Tomorrow's Parties New York 2010 weekend he curated along with Iggy Pop and The Stooges, Sleep, Sonic Youth, Sunn O))) and Boris. Jarmusch contacted the band in March 2012 asking them to play themselves performing their 2007 song \\"Under Skin Or By Name\\" in his new film, Only Lovers Left Alive. The script denotes a “visually striking band” playing wild music in a Detroit club. Jarmusch said he felt the part was made for WHITE HILLS. The band shares the screen with Tilda Swinton, Tom Hiddleston, Mia Wasikowska and Anton Yelchin. When the film was released in December 2013 in Germany, the band joined with other artists from the soundtrack including Jarmusch's band SQÜRL, Jozef van Wissem, Zola Jesus and Yasmine Hamdan to do a series of traveling live performances following the screenings of the film in Cologne, Berlin, London, Paris and New York. The events were orchestrated by ATP. In 2014, the band also appeared in Sound and Chaos: The Story of BC Studios directed by Sara Leavitt and Ryan C. Douglass. This documentary chronicles the birth and life of Martin Bisi’s legendary recording and production studio co-founded by multi-instrumentalist and collaborator- extraordinaire Bill Laswell. Initially funded by Brian Eno (much of his album On Land was recorded there), the studio went on to host a who's-who of NYC musicians: White Zombie, J.G. Thirlwell, Afrika Bambaataa, Cop Shoot Cop, and many more. The film includes footage of WHITE HILLS in BC Studios during their Frying On This Rock sessions. The film made its New York premiere at Anthology Film Archives on July 17, 2014.

Elliott in 1976. The players each start with two horsemen and five footmen on a 5×5 board. The two sides make their moves simultaneously. The game was featured in Issue 53 of Games & Puzzles magazine. Game rules The starting setup is as shown. Horsemen and footmen move and capture the same as knights and pawns in chess, except footmen do not have a double-step option on their first move. For each turn, each player secretly writes down their move, then the players simultaneously declare them. The following rules apply: * If they moved to the same square, a horseman captures a footman. Same-type pieces are both removed from the board. * If a capture was declared using a footman, but the piece to be captured moved from its square, the footman move still stands. (The move converts to a diagonal step instead of a capture.) * If a declared move is illegal, the player incurs a penalty point. A footman promotes to horseman when reaching the last , but only when the player has fewer than two horsemen. Otherwise the player must redeploy the footman to any vacant square. =End of game= A player wins by being first to eliminate all of the opponent's footmen. Accumulating two penalty points forfeits the game. A stalemate is a draw.

It was directed by Bidyut Kotoky and produced by National Film Development Corporation of India. The film was simultaneously made in Hindi as As the river flows. The story was inspired by the kidnapping of activist Sanjoy Ghosh, who was first abducted in 1997 from the island Majuli in Assam supposed to be by the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) and subsequently killed. A controversy developed when it got rejected by the jury of the 59th National Film Awards in the category of best Assamese film for being \\"not Assamese\\". Plot Sridhar Ranjan, a social activist, has gone missing from Majuli, Assam. After almost seven years, when as per law he is about to be officially declared dead, his old journalist friend Abhijit Shandilya (Sanjay Suri) goes in search of Sridhar from Mumbai to Majuli. In Majuli, Abhijit finds himself to be a stranger of sorts in a place that’s infested with terrorists and where both the police and the terrorists seem to be suspicious of him. He befriends with his local guide Sudakshina (Bidita Bag). Sudakshina apparently was the guide for Sridhar when he came to Majuli initially. She, however, seems to be living with her own fears and stops short of getting close to Abhijit whenever an occasion comes up. The rest of the story revoles around Abhijit trying solve the mystery behind the disappearance of Sridhar. Cast * Sanjay Suri as Abhijit Shandilya, an old friend of Sridhar Ranjan * Bidita Bag as Sudakshina, a local guide in Majuli * Victor Banerjee as grandfather of Sudakshina * Nakul Vaid as Jyotiraj, brother of Sudakshina * Raj Zutshi as Jayanta Doley, an ex-militant * Naved Aslam as Sub- Divisional police officer Sameer Agarwal * Preeti Jhangiani Production Bidyut Kotoky, the director of Ekhon Nedekha Nodir Xhipare, said that the story has nothing to do with the disappearance of Sanjay Ghose and it is not based on his life. According to him, \\"if a person like Sanjay Ghose existed, then somebody like Sridhar Ranjan – the protagonist of my film – could also have existed in Majuli. True, the film is inspired by the unfortunate disappearance of Sanjay Ghose – but inspiration ends there. The entire story is totally fictitious...\\" The film was shot in Assam's Majuli river island, Jorhat and Mumbai. The film features a poem recitation by Dr. Bhupen Hazarika. It was recorded on 10 February 2010 and featured on the opening. In Bidyut Kotoky's words, \\"The poem represents the voice of the river Brahmaputra through the voice of the music maestro. Late Hazarika is known for his passion for the mighty river and is called the 'Bard of Brahmaputra'. So, when I needed someone to represent the voice of the river in my film, I immediately decided to approach Dr. Hazarika. ... He was ailing and not well when I approached him for recording the recitation for the film. However, he agreed to lend his voice and we finally recorded the recitation in February 2010.\\" The music was composed by Zubeen Garg and cinematography was done by veteran cinematographer Madhu Ambat. Release The film was released on 14 September 2012 in 9 theatres across Assam. Its first public screening of was held on 29 July 2012 at 12th Osian’s Cinefan Film Festival held in New Delhi. It was screened by the cultural affairs department of the Maharashtra government on 8 September 2012 in Mumbai to mark Bhupen Hazarika’s birth anniversary. Reception=Critical reception= The film received generally positive reviews. Utpal Borpujari said that Bidyut Kotoky made a \\"promising debut.\\" Film writer Arunlochan Das rated Ekhon Nedekha Nodir Xhipare to be a \\"good film based on reality.\\" Seven Sisters Post praised the acting of Raj Zutshi and said that the film is \\"an honest attempt to tell the truth.\\" Awards and accolades Bidyut Kotoky won Best Screenplay award for Ekhon Nedekha Nodir Xhipare in the Assam State Film Awards for 2010-2012, which was presented on 10 March 2013 at Machkhowa, Guwahati. Jeevan Initiative, a voluntary trust from Assam, included the film in its list of 'Special 10 of the year 2012 for Assam' and cited, \\"this cinema aesthetically unveils an almost forgotten story of our recent political history.\\" Ekhon Nedekha Nodir Xhipare was selected for screening in the second edition of the Washington DC South Asian Film Festival held from 10 May 2013. The film was awarded for the Best Script and Best Actor at the same festival. The film won the Audience Choice Award at the North Carolina International South Asian Film Festival (NCISAFF) for 2014. Controversy Ekhon Nedekha Nodir Xhipare was sent to compete in the category of best Assamese film in 59th National Film Awards. But the 11-member jury, led by Rohini Hattangadi, rejected the film for \\"lack of cultural purity\\". Assamese filmmaker Hiren Bora, one of the jury members, said that, \\"The jury was of the view that a major chunk of the film was shot in Mumbai and most of the dialogues were in Hindi.\\" This led to a controversy since the official censorship authority in India had already certified the film as Assamese. A public-interest litigation was filed by enajori.com, a socio- cultural organisation that promotes cultural heritage of Assam, against the jury's decision. In response to the plea the Delhi High Court issued a notice to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, the Directorate of Film Festivals, the Central Board of Film Certification, Rohini Hattangadi (chairperson of Feature Film section), and Hiren Bora. After examining the documents submitted for the selection of regional films, the High Court dismissed the plea. The proceedings revealed that Ekhon Nedekha Nodir Xhipare, and other films from the eastern region, were previewed and rejected by the jury. The court imposed costs of on the petitioner for moving to the court without ascertaining the facts of the case. An online campaign was created to support the film. Many film personalities, such as Nandita Das, Amol Gupte, Rajesh Parmar, Adil Hussain etc. have pledged support to the campaign.

The designated survivor for the 2013 State of the Union Address was United States Secretary of Energy Steven Chu. Topics Obama's 2013 State of the Union Address was, in the words of CNN's Rebecca Sinderbrand, \\"a companion to the ideological offensive in his inauguration speech.\\" The New York Times added: \\"Obama did not match the lofty tone of his inauguration speech, but the address was clearly intended to be its workmanlike companion. In place of his ringing call for a more equitable society was a package of proposals that constitute a blueprint for the remainder of his presidency. Some would require legislation; others merely an executive order.\\" The speech was dominated by domestic issues such as debt & deficit reduction, infrastructure measures, the economy and need to reinvigorate the middle class, gun control, minimum wage, early education and immigration. Obama declared \\"Together, we have cleared away the rubble of crisis, and we can say with renewed confidence that the state of our union is stronger.\\" But despite this Obama noted that it is now his generation's task to \\"reignite the true engine of America’s economic growth — a rising, thriving middle class.\\" “Every day,” he said, “we should ask ourselves three questions as a nation: How do we attract more jobs to our shores? How do we equip our people with the skills to get those jobs? And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living?”“We gather here knowing that there are millions of Americans whose hard work and dedication have not yet been rewarded,” Obama said early in his remarks explaining the rationale behind his middle class agenda. “Our economy is adding jobs, but too many people still can’t find full-time employment. Corporate profits have rocketed to all-time highs, but for more than a decade, wages and incomes have barely budged.\\" During his speech Obama called on Congress to hike the minimum wage to $9 an hour, proposed the addition of three more urban manufacturing hubs and asked Congress \\"to help create a network of 15 of these hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is made right here in America.\\" He also called on Congress to invest $50 billion on rebuilding roads and bridges and announced a bipartisan commission to improve the voting system. The bipartisan commission has the task to investigate voting irregularities that led to long lines at polling sites in the November 2012 election. Studies indicate that these lines cost Democrats hundreds of thousands of votes. The commission will be led by the chief counsel of the Obama presidential campaign, Robert Bauer, and a legal adviser to Mitt Romney’s campaign, Ben Ginsberg. Obama proposed universal preschool for 4-year-olds and linking some federal grant decisions to research schools on their ability to keep tuition costs in check. And he urged Congress to put his full gun control agenda (i.e. background checks in all gun sales, the prevention of anyone buying guns for resale to criminals, a ban on semi-automatic weapons that mimic military weapons, and limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds) up for a vote. \\"Senators of both parties are working together on tough new laws to prevent anyone from buying guns for resale to criminals. Police chiefs are asking our help to get weapons of war and massive ammunition magazines off our streets, because these police chiefs, they're tired of seeing their guys and gals being outgunned. Each of these proposals deserves a vote in Congress. They deserve  they deserve a simple vote.\\" Obama used the line \\"They deserve a vote\\" four more times than in the prepared remarks in effort to create empathy. The U.S. president proposed to Congress to make high-quality preschool available to every child, provide tax credits for businesses to hire and invest, promote more scientific research and development, further shift cars and trucks away from gasoline, and invest in infrastructure. Obama called for \\"modest\\" reforms to Medicare in his speech, continued his push for Congress to act on immigration reform and proposed a paycheck fairness act intended to make it easier for women to fight salary discrimination without losing their jobs, the development of new alternative energy hubs in the country, and to help people refinance their mortgages at today's lower interest rates. With respect to Medicare he argued that the United States can't just cut its way to prosperity. On climate change, Obama promised executive action if Congress failed to address what he called a litany of evidence that the nation and the world face such as more frequent and powerful storms, wildfires and drought: \\"If Congress won't act soon to protect future generations, I will,\\" he said. \\"I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy.\\" Obama thus advocated a transition to more sustainable and environment-friendly sources of energy, such as wind and solar, in order to reduce America's dependence on oil. Obama also proposed the creation of an Energy Security Trust dedicated to shifting the country's cars and trucks off oil. \\"We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy, and the most severe drought in decades, and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence. Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science and act before it's too late.\\" \\"It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country  the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead,\\" the president said. \\"It is our unfinished task to make sure that this government works on behalf of the many, and not just the few.\\" Obama said that deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan. \\"A growing economy that creates good, middle-class jobs  that must be the North Star that guides our efforts.\\" Obama's State of the Union address included a call to \\"set party interests aside, and work to pass a budget that replaces reckless cuts with smart savings and wise investments in our future.\\" \\"And let's do it without the brinksmanship that stresses consumers and scares off investors,\\" he continued to applause, mainly from Democrats. \\"The greatest nation on Earth cannot keep conducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next. We can't do it. Let's agree, right here, right now, to keep the people's government open, and pay our bills on time, and always uphold the full faith and credit of the United States of America.\\" \\"Nothing I'm proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime.\\" Obama said. \\"It's not a bigger government we need, but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth.\\" On foreign policy Obama announced in the context of the Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan that he would bring home half of all U.S. troops by February 2013 and end the war there the following year. Barack Obama called for a free trade agreement between the United States and the European Union and announced his intent to complete negotiations on a \\"Trans-Pacific partnership\\". He also addressed drone oversight, the 2013 North Korean nuclear test, Iran's nuclear program and the Middle East in the context of the Syrian Civil War. Obama warned the North Korea’s reclusive government that it faced further isolation, swift retaliation and a United States bent on improving its own missile defense systems. He spoke about the reduction of nuclear stockpiles in cooperation with Russia: \\"We'll engage Russia to seek further reductions in our nuclear arsenals and continue leading the global effort to secure nuclear materials that could fall into the wrong hands.\\" \\"In defense of freedom, we'll remain the anchor of strong alliances, from the Americas to Africa, from Europe to Asia. In the Middle East, we will stand with citizens as they demand their universal rights, and support stable transitions to democracy.\\" Obama called for lawmakers to work together to be more effective by successfully solving problems regardless of party divisions: \\"The American people don't expect government to solve every problem. They don't expect those of us in this chamber to agree on every issue. But they do expect us to put the nation's interests before party.\\" Obama closed his speech with a reference to his second inaugural address ending by saying that all Americans share the same title: \\"We are citizens. It's a word that doesn't just describe our nationality or legal status. It describes the way we're made. It describes what we believe. It captures the enduring idea that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations; that our rights are wrapped up in the rights of others; and that well into our third century as a nation, it remains the task of us all, as citizens of these United States, to be the authors of the next great chapter in our American story.\\"  Responses  Senator Marco Rubio a Republican of Florida, delivered the official Republican response to the 2013 State of the Union Address.http://www.wtnh.com/dpps/onpolitix/state_of_the_union/full-text- of-2013-gop-response-to-sotu- nd13-jos_5541850#.URv4lB3ZagYhttp://www.politico.com/story/2013/02/gop- rebuttal-marco-rubio-response-english-spanish-full-text-87554.html Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul delivered the Tea Party's rebuttal to Obama's 2013 State of the Union Address.

Her work has been performed at the Royal Opera House, Zurich Opera, Carnegie Hall, Richard B. Fisher Center for the Performing Arts and Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko Moscow Academic Music Theatre. She studied piano and composition at the Gnessin School in Moscow and composition at the Moscow Conservatoire; in 1999 she moved to London and studied composition at the Royal College of Music (1999–2000) with Julian Anderson and the Royal Academy of Music (2001–03) with Simon Bainbridge. Career In 2002 Langer became the first Jerwood Composer in Association at the Almeida Theatre in London, writing the short operas Ariadne (premiered at the Almeida Opera Festival in 2002) and The Girl of Sand (2003), both settings of librettos by poet Glyn Maxwell. Ariadne was further performed at the Tanglewood Festival and the Britten and Strauss Festival in Aldeburgh in 2009, as well as at the Moscow Conservatoire. In 2009 her song cycle Songs at the Well, based on Russian folk texts, was performed at the Carnegie Hall, New York. Her next collaboration with Maxwell, a short dramatic piece called The Present, won the Audience Prize at the Zurich Opera House's New Opera Festival in January 2009. The work concerned the case of a patient suffering from Alzheimer's Disease. Langer and Maxwell went on to develop this into the opera The Lion's Face, which enjoyed a successful tour around England and Wales (including 4 performances at the Linbury Studio, Royal Opera House, Covent Garden) in a production by John Fulljames for The Opera Group. This work also initiated an ongoing collaboration between The Opera Group and the Institute of Psychiatry, and involved Professor Simon Lovestone, director of the Institute's Biomedical Research Centre, in a consultant role. Langer was subsequently commissioned by Dawn Upshaw to compose a one-act comic opera for performance at Bard College in upstate New York. The resulting work, Four Sisters, to a libretto by John Lloyd-Davies, was performed in March 2012 at the Richard B. Fisher Center for the Performing Arts at Bard College. In December 2012 Songs at the Well, with additional newly composed music, was dramatised by Dmitri Belyanushkin and staged at the Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko Moscow Academic Music Theatre, in a double-bill with Lera Auerbach's The Blind. In 2012/2013, using the surviving vocal score, Langer re-orchestrated César Cui's 1913 opera Puss in Boots (Кот в сапогах) for the Grand Théâtre de Genève, for performance in May 2013. Current work in progress includes a song cycle for Concerts at Cratfield (to be performed in August 2013) based on the poems of Lee Harwood. Langer is also working on a piece for string quartet and Russian \\"kolesnaya lira\\" (hurdy-gurdy) for the Kronos Quartet, to be premiered at the Théâtre de la Ville in May 2014. Her opera Figaro Gets a Divorce is to be premiered at the Welsh National Opera in February 2016.\\"Figaro Gets a Divorce\\", Welsh National Opera website, accessed 19 March 2015.

The CES was established through federal funding as a direct response to the devastating 2005 Kashmir earthquake in order to understand earthquakes and provide scientific prediction of quakes to improve earthquake preparedness. The CES is the only national site in Pakistan working on earthquake precursors. The national laboratory is headquartered in the campus area of the National Centre for Physics (NCP) and conducts mathematical research in earth sciences, in close coordination with the NCP. History The national site was founded by the Government of Pakistan on the advice of the science adviser Dr. Ishfaq Ahmad. The establishment of the national site came in response to Pakistans' deadliest earthquake, the 2005 Kashmir earthquake on 8 October 2005. Initially created as the Earthquake Studies Department at the National Center for Physics, it gained independence shortly after its establishment. The CES undertakes research studies in the development of expertise in anomalous geophysical phenomenon prior to seismic activity. The CES primarily produces its research outcomes by using computer simulation and mathematical modelling to interpret seismic activity and give earthquake predictions. The CES's campus also includes the various ATROPATENA stations network, and supports its research and development with close collaboration with the Global Network for the Forecasting of Earthquakes. Its first and founding director was Dr. Ahsan Mubarak who is still designated as the CES's senior scientist. Currently, Dr. Muhammad Qaisar is the CES's current administrator.

It is located about south of Elliott and east of Kalkaringi in the Northern Territory. The property shares a boundary with Banka Banka to the south, Eva Downs to the east, Ucharonidge and Tandyidgee to the north and Muckaty and Powell Creek Station to the west. The station was founded prior to 1885 with Messrs Douglas and Hemphill's stock are running near Helen's Springs near Tompkinson Creek on the telegraph line. Composed primarily of open grazing land the property occupies an area of . Following a dry season in 1928, heavy rains came at the start of the wet season in 1929 causing the creeks to flood and waters to wash away several fences and large river gums. Edith Bohning and her daughters, Esther and Elsie, became known as the petticoat drovers when the two girls took a mob of cattle from Alice Springs to Adelaide by train in 1929. Mr. Bohning was asked by a railway inspector how the two women would cope to which he replied if those two ladies can’t handle the situation then it will be no use getting your men to try. Helen Springs was acquired by the Vestey Group in 1944 as well as some other smaller holdings in the area as part of extending their operations in the Northern Territory. The Vestey Group had become interested in using road trains to move stock instead of overlanding using drovers in the 1950s. They hired Stan Mason who arrived at the station in 1951 then worked with Kurt Johannsen in Alice Springs in 1954 to ultimately develop the Rotinoff Viscount, the first of which arrived in Australia in 1957. Peter Sherwin was the head stockman at Helen Springs in 1953, when it was still owned by Vesteys. Sherwin would later on purchase a string of properties including Victoria River Downs Station in 1986. The Barkly Tableland area was struck by drought in 1958 from Helen Springs through Brunette Downs and onto Eva Downs being the worst affected areas. The property was one of fifteen owned by the Vestey Group in Northern Australia during the 1970s. Tim Doran was the station manager from 1972 to 1981 and had about 20 employees at this time. Vesteys sold a large number of cattle stations in 1992 including Helen Springs which was acquired by Stanbroke Pastoral Company. Stanbroke then sold Helen Springs to S. Kidman & Co. in 2004 following a buyout in the parent company by Peter Menegazzo. Stanbroke was also selling several other properties in the central Queensland region. In 2008 a nine-year-old boy was bitten by a King Brown Snake, one of the most venomous snakes in the world. The boy had picked up the snake and swung it around his head before it bit him on the arm. The Royal Flying Doctor Service medivacced the boy to Alice Springs Hospital. He received anti-venine and survived the bite. A 23-year-old mechanic was killed at the property in February 2012 in a workplace accident when moving steel with a bobcat. In October 2012 Chris Townes, the manager of Helen Springs, paid 28,000 at auction for a Charbray bull. This amount is a record for a Charbray in Australia, the bull will join 14 others bought at the same auction to join the Brahman - Charbray breeding operation at the station. The Barkly Tableland and other areas of northern Australia are prone to infestations of Calotropis procera which is slowly becoming more widespread. Research is being conducted at Helen Springs to study how the species invades grazing lands.

McAuley. It was initially published by Gollancz on November 19, 2009 as a sequel to the 2008 novel The Quiet War. Summary Although The Quiet War and Gardens of the Sun can be read as standalone novels, taken together they form the two halves of the story of the \\"Quiet War\\" of the title. The primary conflict is between the radical environmentalism of the inner system, led by the new superpower governments (such as Greater Brazil) and the posthumanism of the Outers. Having narrowly avoided the destruction of Earth's ecosystems, the feudal Greater Brazil attempted to return most of the planet to a \\"natural\\" state, to the extent that most of Earth's population inhabits a few megacities. The Outers, by contrast, survive by terraforming the moons of Jupiter and the other outer planets and practicing genetic engineering, which caused ideological tension with Greater Brazil, ultimately flaring into a full-scale conflict called the \\"Quiet War\\". By the time of Gardens of the Sun, the war is over. The surviving Outers have been forced to Uranus, Neptune and Pluto as the superpowers of Earth raid the moons of Jupiter and Saturn for Outer knowledge. However, Greater Brazil's policies are starting to come apart under the strain of their inflexible opposition to change and democracy. The novel follows the major characters from The Quiet War in the aftermath, including the clone assassin Dave #8, ecologist Macy Minnot, Greater Brazilian diplomat Loc Ifrahim, and genetic engineer Sri Hong-Owen as they adjust to the new order of the solar system. Parts of the novel are modified versions of elements from the earlier short stories \\"The Gardens of Saturn\\", \\"The Assassination of Faustino Malarte\\", \\"The Passenger\\" and \\"Dead Man Walking\\". Reception In his review for the SF Site, Rich Horton recommended The Quiet War and Gardens of the Sun as \\"among the best hard SF novels of recent years,\\" giving particular praise to McAuley's construction of the setting and politics. Adam Roberts found the ending of the novel to be its weakest aspect and excessively \\"neat\\" as well as noting that the books should be combined as an omnibus but concluded that the diptych \\"is a very major work of contemporary science fiction, amongst the great genre achievements of the noughties, a long novel that will still be being read and remembered fifty years from now.\\" References External links  * Category:Dystopian novels Category:2009 British novels Category:2009 science fiction novels Category:British science fiction novels Category:Space opera novels Category:Works by Paul J.

Biography The grave of James Campbell Noble, Rosebank Cemetery James Campbell Noble was born in Edinburgh on 22 July 1845, the son of James Noble and Rachel Campbell. Three of his cousins were also artists: Robert Noble (1857-1917), James Inglis Noble (1853-1912), and David Noble (1865-1890). J.C. Noble apprenticed Robert in 1871http://www.johngraycentre.org/people/artists/robert-noble-ra- rsa-1857-1917/ and possibly taught the other two cousins as well. He traveled throughout Europe to paint, where the Netherlands and Italy were particularly favorites. He had a studio on Picardy Place and was a teacher at the Royal Scottish Academy art class on The Moundhttp://www.johngraycentre.org/people/artists/robert-noble-ra- rsa-1857-1917/ and at the Trustees Academy on Picardy Place. His pupils included Robert Gemmell Hutchison.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: Robert Gemmell Hutchison Initially he began with rustic genre like dark cottages and outside life. Then when he became a member of ARSA in 1879 and the Royal Scottish Academy in 1892, he abandoned the previous subject for land- and seascape scenery and marine paintings of rivers and ports. He painted the scenery on the Clyde, Seine, Tyne, Merwede, Maas (Meus) and Rhine. For a long part of his live he lived in the Netherlands where his favorite port for painting seemed to have been Dordrecht, Dort for short. There are quite a number of his oil paintings painted in this harbour facility, which also seem to have attracted other painters. However he also painted in places like 's-Gravendeel, Volendam and Zaandam. In the early 1880s he painted the rocky coastal scenes of Berwickshire whilst he was living in Coldingham. He returned however to the Netherlands in 1900 painting the Dutch waterways again. Towards the end of his life he lived again in Scotland, where he lived in Dumfries and Galloway and where he is also mentioned in Corstorphine in 1896. His Sunset near Glencaple exhibited at Royal Scottish Academy in 1913. His portrait was painted by the well known portrait painter John Pettie and is exhibited in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh. In later life he lived at 12 Queen Street in Edinburgh's First New Town.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1911-12 He died on 25 September 1913 whilst in Ledaig, Argyll.

It is believed to be the largest species of deer that ever existed, larger than its North American relative Cervalces scotti, Megaloceros, and the modern moose. Description Fossils in Bergamo Cervalces latifrons was first described by Mr Randall Johnson in 1874.Annals and Magazine of Natural History: Zoology, Botany, and Geology Series 4, vol. 13 (1874). A frontal bone attached to part of an antler of a previously unknown species of deer was found at low tide on the beachfront at Happisburgh, Norfolk, in the \\"Forest Bed\\". Johnson, who retained the specimen in his collection, named it Cervus latifrons,\\"Forest bed ungulata\\", Memoirs of the Geological Survey of Great Britain, Museum of Economic Geology in London, 1882:58. Cervus being the only genus of deer known at that time. The specific name \\"latifrons\\" refers to the wide frontal bone of this large species. The morphology of the animal as deduced from this fossil and from others later found in this formation and in continental Europe differs little from modern moose. It was later placed in the genus Cervalces which it shares with the also extinct Cervalces scotti from North America. The antlers of the males had short beams and large palmate lobes with up to ten large points. They were probably for display purposes to impress the female rather than for fighting because these moose are believed to have roamed as solitary individuals. The average sized Cervalces latifrons was quite a bit more massive than other large moose-like deer, such Cervalces scotti, the largest races of the extant moose and the Irish elk (Megaloceros giganteus), despite some overlap in shoulder height, and is the largest deer ever known to exist. C. latifrons is estimated to have averaged high at the shoulder. Body mass of C. latifrons was around , putting it around 30% heavier than C. scotti. In some cases, this species could have weighed perhaps up to with the largest specimens perhaps reaching at the shoulder.Boeskorov, G. G. (2005). A review of the systematics of Pliocene and Pleistocene moose, part 1. Cranium, 22(2), 26-55.Vangengeim, E.A. & Flerov, C.C. (1965). Bullheaded moose (Alces latifrons) in Siberia. Bull. Commission to the Study the Quaternary Period, 30: 166-171. It was about the same mass and far taller than a modern bull American bison (Bison bison) and could have weighed about twice as much as the Irish elk (Megaloceros giganteus) but is much less well known to the general public, probably because the span of its antlers at was smaller than that of the Irish elk. Distribution and habitat Antlers in Tübingen Fossil remains of this deer are known from northern Europe and Asia but have not been found in the Iberian Peninsula, Italy south of the Apennines, Croatia or Greece. In the United Kingdom, it is known only from the Cromer Forest Bed Formation. This is exposed at intervals along the coast of Norfolk and Suffolk and forms low cliffs between Cromer and Great Yarmouth. The holotype came from here. It is believed that Cervalces latifrons resembled its modern moose relations and lived in tundra, steppes, coniferous forests and swamps. It probably avoided deciduous forests because of the inconvenience that would be caused by its wide antlers when moving among bushes and saplings. Like its living relatives, it is likely to have lived a solitary life. It is believed to have fed on rough herbage and plants growing around lakes and swamps. Further remains of Cervalces latifrons have been recovered from Sénèze (Haute- Loire, France), Mauer (Baden-Württemberg, Germany), Bilshausen (Niedersachsen, Germany), Mosbach (Hessen, Germany), Süßenborn (Thüringen, Germany), Ranica (Lombardy, Italy), Leffe (Lombardy, Italy) and Crostolo Creek (Emilia-Romagna, Italy) and extensively from Siberia. Evolutionary history Fossils of large moose-like deer found in Siberia dating from the most recent glaciation are fragmentary and lack intact skulls and complete antlers but they have tentatively been identified as Cervalces latifrons. They had less advanced teeth, a more specialist muzzle and larger antlers that were bi-lobed and four pronged. They seem to have played a bridging role, crossing the land bridge to Alaska and eventually evolving into Cervalces scotti in North America. They were faced with predators well capable of tackling a moose, the steppe brown bear in Eurasia and the short-faced bear in North America. In Europe, three paleospecies of moose seem to have followed each other chronologically. It is not clear whether Cervalces latifrons evolved into modern moose or whether it died out in the last glacial period. Ecology A palaeobotanical study was made of clay found inside the skull of a specimen of Cervalces latifrons found at Fornaci di Ranica in northern Italy dating back to the early Pleistocene. The site was fluvial deposits in the basin of the Serio River. The infrared spectrum of the clay and the pollen grains found in it were compared with a previously available chronological sequence of pollens from sediments in the area. The results suggest that the vegetation in the region at the time in which the moose lived consisted of sparse coniferous forests with Pinus sylvestris and Pinus mugo, steppes and grassland. In the immediate vicinity, it correlated with a retreat of forest cover and an increase in herbaceous ground cover. The valley bottoms probably had standing water, marsh vegetation, moist meadows, bushes and flowering plants. A morpho-functional analysis of Cervalces latifrons comparing it with its modern deer relatives, Cervus spp., suggests similarities in diet and in adaptations for living in a marshy environment with scattered scrub and debris. Biology Partial horn Cervalces latifrons shares many anatomical features with its living relative, the moose (British English \\"elk\\", Alces alces) with similarities in its grinding molars, narrow jaw, large mouth cavity, elongated muzzle and premaxillary bones. It is likely to have had a similar diet of bark, leaves and shoots of trees such as willow, aspen, rowan, birch, oak, larch and pine. It would also have grazed herbaceous vegetation in the boggy areas on the floors of valleys. Its limbs were long and show adaptations allowing for locomotion at a fast trot known as \\"stilt-locomotion\\". This involves a long stride with a high elevation of the feet at each step. This gait is helpful for moving through bogs or deep snow. The toes could be spread widely which would have aided swimming and prevented the foot sinking deeply when walking in marshy conditions.

Chandiwala, Instalment II-III Subject Files, F no. 6 The Chandiwalas were a family of silver traders of Chandni Chowk in Delhi. He was educated at St Stephen's College, Delhi where he met Gandhi, who had gone there as a guest of the college principal, S. K. Rudra, in 1918.  Gandhi's associate  His meeting with Gandhi deeply influenced Chandiwala and he became an ardent follower and close associate of Gandhi. Chandiwala took to spartan meals and to wearing khadi under Gandhi's influence. Also, he took to himself the task of supplying Gandhiji his goat's milk whenever he stayed in Delhi and his earnestness in this matter earned him the nickname gwalin (milkmaid) from Dr. M A Ansari. During the 1930s, Chandiwala helped organise the stone breakers of Delhi into a union and took up cases of violation of their rights with the Delhi administrators and in courts of law to ensure better compliance to government regulations regarding their work and to get compensation for them. While in Delhi, Gandhi used to stay at Chandiwala's house and Gandhi's 21-day fast for communal harmony in 1924 was undertaken there. Chandiwala was with Gandhi on the day of his assassination and it was he who prepared Gandhi's body for cremation.  Social work  After Independence, Chandiwala took to social work and became a founding member and president of the Bharat Sewak Samaj and Sadachar Samiti. In 1952 he founded the Shri Banarsidas Chandiwala Sewa Smarak Trust Society which was initially headed by Gandhi's son Devdas. The trust runs several hospital and educational institutes in Delhi including the Janki Devi College for Women which has been named in honour of his mother. For his contributions to the field of social work Chandiwala was awarded the Padma Shri in 1963.  Books  Chandiwala authored a three volume book in Hindi titled Bapu Ke Charanon Mein which was later translated into English as At the Feet of Bapu. His other notable work is the Gandhiji ki Delhi Diary which chronicles Gandhi's days in Delhi.

A game with the same name was released in 1995 for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, but it differs slightly in gameplay and was developed by Williams Entertainment Inc. The North American Super NES version of the game is considered to be one of the more rare games released for the console. Gameplay Fun 'n Games is a compilation of puzzles, arcade games, a music composer and a paint program in one video game. The game is arranged into four different types of activities, or categories: Paint, Games, Music and Style. There is virtually no difference in gameplay between the Super NES and Mega Drive/Genesis versions. However, the North American Genesis version has an extra game in the Games section that's not in the European Mega Drive version. Parts of the game is controlled in a computer mouse-like fashion. The Super NES version is compatible with the Super NES Mouse in addition to the standard controller. Similarly, the Mega Drive/Genesis version is compatible with the Mega Mouse. =Paint= In the Paint activity the player can draw on a canvas, but also in a coloring book if desired. Different artistic tools, for example a pencil, pre-made backgrounds, paint bucket, patterns, stamps and different colors are supported. Previously created figures from the activities Stylin' Stuff and Mix and Match can be imported to the drawing. =Games= The Games activity consists of three different minigames: Mouse Maze, Spaze Lazer and Whack a Clown. Mouse Maze is a Pac-Man style game where the player takes control of a mouse in a maze. The mouse must collect all the cheese in the maze to be able to advance to the next level, which is another maze. Mouse traps that appear randomly in the maze makes the mouse freeze for a couple of seconds if the mouse collides with any of them. In the meantime, cats wander in the maze and try to eat the mouse. The player loses a life if the mouse is eaten by a cat, and if all three lives are lost, the game is over. To protect itself, the mouse can collect bones scattered in the maze to transform into a dog for a period of time, and the dog is able to eat the cats. In Spaze Lazer, a spaceship is controlled by the player in first-person view and needs to defend itself by aiming and firing the spaceship guns at enemy spaceships. A radar on the screen helps the player locate the enemy spaceships. When all of the enemy spaceships are destroyed, the player faces a boss monster. When the boss is defeated, the player advances to the next level where the spaceship must be defended against even tougher enemies. The player's spaceship starts with 99 in energy, and the energy decreases when the spaceship is hit by enemy fire. If the energy reaches 0, the game is over. The Whack a Clown game is a variant of Whac-A-Mole, and is exclusive to the Sega Genesis version of the game. There are nine holes from which both clowns and seals pop up randomly, only to disappear later. A hammer is controlled by the player which is used to hit the clowns in the head. Every time a clown is hit by the hammer, the player is awarded with one point. If a seal is hit with the hammer, the player loses a life. When the game timer runs out or all lives are lost, the game ends. Originally, a fourth minigame was planned for at least the Sega Genesis version of the game. It was called Basketball Jones, and the goal was to practice free-throws in Basketball. Nevertheless, it was removed from the game during development. =Music= The Music activity allows the player to compose music by placing notes on an on-screen stave. By pressing the play button, the tune composed by the player can be listened to. An in-game piano can as well be used to place notes on the stave. 15 different types of instruments and 15 different types of sound effects are supported in addition to different paces and half-notes. Moreover, pre-made songs can be opened, listened to and modified. =Style= The Style activity consists itself of two different activities: Stylin' Stuff and Mix and Match. In Stylin' Stuff the player selects the looks of a woman paperdoll. Hair, hat, shirt, pants, shoes and purse are all selectable by clicking on buttons. The objective of the Mix and Match activity is similar to Stylin' Stuff, but now the player instead selects the top, middle and bottom thirds of a creature. Reception The Super NES version of Fun 'n Games was reviewed in 1994 in both Nintendo Power and GamePro. It was praised for its variety, creativity, music and graphics, but the activities were considered simple and too restricting for more advanced and/or older players. Regarding the arcade-style games the reviewers found them too shallow and not challenging enough to entertain players for any longer amount of time. Also, the Nintendo Power reviewer argued that the SNES Mouse was a better alternative for playing the game than the Super NES controller. Both reviewers argued that the player would have more fun playing Mario Paint. Reviewing the Genesis version, Mike Weigand of Electronic Gaming Monthly called it \\"a good non-action game almost anyone can enjoy\\".

He played college football at the University of Mississippi.  High school career  A native of Lake City, Florida, Tunsil attended Columbia High School, where he played football and competed in track and field as a shot putter. He was a two-time All-State offensive lineman for the Tigers football team. Tunsil credits his development as an offensive tackle to going up against defensive lineman Timmy Jernigan, his Columbia teammate, in practice. \\"He's always trying to get better every day. He's strong and he's fundamentally sound. He's got all the tools you need to be one of the best,\\" said his high school coach Brian Allen. In his senior year, Tunsil helped Columbia High School rush for 275 yards per game en route to the FHSAA Class 6A state quarterfinals, where they lost 28–21 to Navarre High School. After the season, Tunsil played in the 2013 U.S. Army All-American Bowl. Regarded as a five-star recruit by Rivals.com, Tunsil was listed as the highest ranked offensive tackle prospect of his class. Tunsil had offers from every major BCS program, including every SEC school. From early on, he made depth chart, i.e. the possibility of starting as a true freshman, one of his priorities. He eliminated his home-state Florida Gators early in the process, because the Gators had signed five-star offensive tackle D. J. Humphries from the previous class. For a long period of time, Tunsil was believed to be leaning towards Georgia, since the Bulldogs started true freshman John Theus at right tackle in every game of the 2012 season, and Tunsil hoped to do so at left tackle in 2013 as incumbent starter Kenarious Gates was graduating. But after a visit to Ole Miss in late January, Tunsil reportedly changed his mind and was considered a \\"done deal\\" for the Rebels. Tunsil made his announcement on National Signing Day on ESPNU, where he indeed committed to Ole Miss.Laremy Tunsil, nation's top offensive tackle, inks with Ole Miss  College career  At Ole Miss in 2013, Tunsil played every game, starting all but four games—Vanderbilt, Southeast Missouri State, Alabama, and Auburn. He was one of only two true freshmen serving as his team's full-time starting left tackle, the other being Virginia Tech's Jonathan McLaughlin. Tunsil had his first start against Texas, competing against Longhorns defensive end Jackson Jeffcoat, who finished the game with only three tackles and no sacks. Following the Rebels' 34–24 victory over SEC West rival Arkansas, Tunsil was named SEC Offensive Lineman of the Week, after helping the offense piling up 531 total yards and a near-school record 428 passing yards. Tunsil earned SEC All-Freshman honors by the league's coaches, and first team Freshman All- American honors by The Sporting News, after allowing only one sack throughout his freshman season. As a sophomore, started at the left tackle position in all 11 games that he played in, only missing the Auburn and Presbyterian games due to a partially torn bicep. Tunsil was back in the starting line-up for the Peach Bowl, but fractured his fibula in the first half when quarterback Bo Wallace fell on the back of his right leg. After the season, Tunsil was named All-SEC by the Associated Press. In June 2015, before his junior season, Tunsil was accused by his stepfather, Lindsey Miller, of having accepted improper benefits from sports agents. Coach Hugh Freeze decided to bench Tunsil for the season-opener against Tennessee–Martin on September 5, as a “precautionary measure.” Tunsil was suspended by the NCAA and missed the first seven games of the season. He was reinstated before the #15 Texas A&M; game on October 24. His matchup with defensive end Myles Garrett, who entered the game with quarterback sacks, was highly anticipated. According to analysts Tunsil emerged as “the big winner,” not giving up a sack and helping the Rebels to a 23–3 upset win over the Aggies. Having missed the first half of the season, Tunsil was not selected to any All-American team despite solid performance. During the Sugar Bowl game against Oklahoma State, Tunsil had a two-yard rushing touchdown as time expired in the first half. Ole Miss won the Sugar Bowl, 48–20.  Professional career  Shortly after Ole Miss's bowl game, Tunsil announced his decision to forgo his final college year and enter the 2016 NFL Draft. In February, a number of mock drafts projected him to be the No. 1 overall selection by the Tennessee Titans. NFL Media analyst Lance Zierlein compared Tunsil to All-Pro offensive tackle Tyron Smith. After an outstanding performance in offensive line drills at the NFL Combine, Tunsil further established himself as the No. 1 draft prospect. On April 14, the Titans announced a trade of their first overall draft pick to the Los Angeles Rams, who were widely believed to be looking for a quarterback rather than an offensive lineman, and eventually selected quarterback Jared Goff out of California. Ten minutes before the draft was set to begin, Tunsil's Twitter account showed a video of him wearing a gas mask and smoking a substance from a bong. Although Tunsil's agent Jimmy Sexton immediately explained that the account was hacked, it resulted in some teams taking Tunsil off their draft boards entirely. The Baltimore Ravens (at No. 6) and Tennessee Titans (at No. 8), both in need of an offensive tackle, passed over Tunsil and chose Ronnie Stanley and Jack Conklin, respectively. The Miami Dolphins eventually selected him with the 13th overall pick. In a parallel incident, Tunsil's Instagram account published a screenshot of a text requesting money from Ole Miss assistant athletic director John Miller for rent and so Tunsil's mother could pay her electric bill. During a post-draft press conference, Tunsil admitted that he took money from an Ole Miss coach while a member of the school, but explained his Instagram account had also been hacked. =Miami Dolphins= On April 28, 2016, the Miami Dolphins selected Tunsil with the 13th overall selection in the 2016 NFL draft. He was the highest selected offensive lineman for the Dolphins since Jake Long went first overall in 2008, and the highest drafted Ole Miss player since linebacker Patrick Willis went 11th overall to the San Francisco 49ers in 2007. On May 6, 2016, it was announced that Tunsil had signed a $12.45 million, four-year contract with the Dolphins. As a rookie in the 2016 season, Tunsil played in 14 games, 13 of those at the left guard position. He helped the Dolphins to finish with the ninth best rushing offense in the league. After the 2016 season, veteran left tackle Branden Albert was traded to the Jacksonville Jaguars, making room for Tunsil to move to the left tackle position for the 2017 season. On April 18, 2019, the Dolphins picked up the fifth-year option on Tunsil's contract. =Houston Texans= On August 31, 2019, Tunsil, Kenny Stills, and a fourth-round pick were traded to the Houston Texans in exchange for two first-round picks, a second-round pick, Johnson Bademosi, and Julien Davenport. He started 14 games at left tackle in 2019, earning his first trip to the Pro Bowl. On April 24, 2020, Tunsil signed a three-year, $66 million contract extension with $57.85 million guaranteed with the Texans, making him the highest-paid offensive lineman in terms of annual value.  Personal life  Tunsil was arrested on domestic violence charges in Oxford, Mississippi, after an altercation with his step-father Lindsey Miller on June 25, 2015. Miller claimed the incident stemmed from an argument about Tunsil \\"riding around with agents,\\" while others claimed Tunsil acted in defense of his mother. Later, Miller met with Chris Howard, the NCAA's director of enforcement, accusing Tunsil of NCAA rules violations, which triggered an NCAA investigation that resulted in Tunsil's suspension for the first seven games of his junior season at Ole Miss (see above).

Jerseys The winner of each national championship wears the national jersey in all their races for the next year in the respective discipline, apart from the World Championships and the Olympics, or unless they are wearing a category leader's jersey in a stage race. Most national champion jerseys tend to represent a country's flag or use the colours from it. Jerseys may also feature traditional sporting colours of a country that are not derived from a national flag, such as the green and gold on the jerseys of Australian national champions. 2013 champions=Men's Elite= { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"background:#f7f8ff;

The album was the last Mentors release in El Duce's lifetime, and was sold at Mentors concerts and via mailorder. It was only available on cassette. The title parodies the Led Zeppelin album Houses of the Holy. In 1997, when German record label Maximum Metal reissued You Axed for It! and Up the Dose, tracks from this album were added as bonuses.

Early life and early career Pettersson was one of the six children of Carl Wilhelm and Johanna Pettersson. His father left the family, and Carl went to sea around 1892, at about the age of 17. Later, around 1898, he ended up in the Bismarck Archipelago of German New Guinea, where he worked for the German trading house, Neuguinea-Compagnie, headquartered in Kokopo. Shipwreck On a recruiting trip in the Pacific, Pettersson's vessel, the Herzog Johan Albrecht (Duke Johan Albrecht) sank on Christmas Day 1904, off Tabar Island in New Ireland Province. He was washed ashore near a village and landed in a hibiscus hedge, where he was immediately surrounded by islanders. Cannibalism was not uncommon in those times and although Pettersson was uncommonly strong, he would not have been a match for them. The islanders carried him to their king, and the king's daughter fell in love with him. In 1907 he married Princess Singdo, the daughter of the local king, Lamy. He got a start in the copra trade and managed to create his own coconut plantation that he called Teripax. He became king after the death of his father in law. His nickname among the locals was \\"Strong Charley\\", and he was indeed famed for his physical strength. Swedish newspapers printed a series of stories about Pettersson and his adventures.  Later life  Pettersson with his family c. 1918 Business went well and he increased his estate with two plantations, first Maragon on Simberi Island and later Londolovit on Lihir Group islands. Pettersson was respectful of local customs and showed concern for his employees, which was unusual at the time. He was therefore very popular with the locals. His marriage with Singdo produced a family of nine children, one of whom died in infancy. His wife died in 1921 of puerperal fever. In 1922, Pettersson travelled to Sweden, partly to look for a new wife who could look after his children. There, he also visited his old friend Birger Mörner whom he had met in the South Pacific. He then met Anglo- Swedish Jessie Louisa Simpson; together they returned to Tabar Island, where they married in 1923. In Pettersson's absence the plantation had declined, and he was now close to bankruptcy. Additionally, he and his wife both suffered from malaria. He painstakingly rebuilt his plantation, but bad investments and the failing market conditions made it difficult to recover. Pettersson did however find a gold deposit on Simberi Island which he kept secret for years. Today, the Tabar Group of islands has one of the world's largest gold deposits. His fortunes having changed, he decided to leave the island. His wife Jessie traveled ahead to Australia for medical treatment and then returned to Sweden. She died in Stockholm from malaria and cancer on 19 May 1935. Pettersson's health also deteriorated. Pettersson left Tabar in 1935 but never returned to Sweden. He died of a heart attack in Sydney on 12 May 1937. In popular culture Carl Pettersson is regarded as the inspiration for Ephraim Longstocking, Pippi's father in Astrid Lindgren's children's series, Pippi Longstocking. In 2012, film writer Jorn Rossing Jensen reported that Swedish producer Mirijam Johansson, of Sweden's Wanted Pictures, announced at Cannes that she had acquired the rights to Efraim Longstocking and the Cannibal Princess, a film based on a screenplay by Daniel Fridell and Ulf Stark and approved by Saltkråkan, the latter of which holds Lindgren's rights.

The city of Mecca served as a sanctuary for Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, who was among the most prominent challengers to the dynastic succession to the Caliphate by the Umayyad Yazid I. After nearby Medina, the other holy city of Islam, also rebelled against Yazid, the Umayyad ruler sent an army to subdue Arabia. The Umayyad army defeated the Medinans and took the city, but Mecca held out in a month-long siege, during which the Kaaba was damaged by fire. The siege ended when news came of Yazid's sudden death. The Umayyad commander, Husayn ibn Numayr, after vainly trying to induce Ibn al- Zubayr to return with him to Syria and be recognized as Caliph, departed with his forces. Ibn al-Zubayr remained in Mecca throughout the civil war, but he was nevertheless soon acknowledged as Caliph across most of the Muslim world. It was not until 692, that the Umayyads were able to send another army which again besieged and captured Mecca, ending the civil war.  Background  At the death of the founder of the Umayyad Caliphate, Mu'awiya I (), in 680, the Muslim world was thrown into turmoil. Although Mu'awiya had named his son, Yazid I, as his heir, this choice was not universally recognized, especially by the old Medinan elites, who challenged the Umayyads' claim to the succession. Among them, the two chief candidates for the caliphate were the Alid Husayn ibn Ali (the grandson of Prophet Muhammad), and Abd Allah ibn al- Zubayr (a grandson of the first caliph, Abu Bakr, and nephew of Muhammad's wife A'isha). To avoid being forced to acknowledge Yazid, on the latter's accession the two men fled from Medina to Mecca. Husayn made for Kufa, where his supporters awaited him to rise in revolt against the Umayyads, but his convoy was intercepted and he was killed at the Battle of Karbala in October 680, leaving Ibn al-Zubayr as the leading contender and rival for the Umayyads. As long as Yazid lived, Ibn al-Zubayr denounced his rule from the sanctuary of Mecca but did not openly claim the caliphate, instead calling himself \\"the fugitive at the sanctuary\\" (al-ʿaʾidh biʾl-bayt) and insisting that the caliph should be chosen in the traditional manner, by a tribal assembly (shūrā) from among all the Quraysh, not just the Umayyads. At first Yazid and his governors in Medina tried to negotiate with Ibn al-Zubayr, as well as the dissatisfied Ansar families. The Medinan aristocracy, however, who felt their position threatened by Mu'awiya's large-scale agricultural projects around their city, and regarded Yazid as unfit for the office of caliph due to his reputed dissolute lifestyle, led a public denunciation of their allegiance to Yazid, and expelled the Umayyad family members, some 1,000 in number (including the future caliph Marwan ibn al-Hakam and his sons), from their city. As a result, Yazid sent an army to subdue the province, and chose Muslim ibn Uqba al-Murri to lead it. Muslim's army of 12,000 Syrians indeed overcame the Medinans' resistance at the Battle of al-Harrah on 26 August 683 and proceeded to sack Medina—one of the impious acts for which the Umayyads are denounced in later Muslim tradition.. For his sack of Medina, subsequent tradition remembers Muslim ibn Uqba as, in the words of Julius Wellhausen, the \\"heathen incarnate\\", although in the earlier sources he is represented as devout and reluctant to undertake the task assigned to him by the Caliph.  Siege  After taking Medina, Muslim set out for Mecca, but on the way he fell ill and died at Mushallal, and command passed to his lieutenant Husayn ibn Numayr al-Sakuni. According to the account reported by al-Tabari, this was much against Uqba's will, but in accordance with the wishes of Yazid. Many of the Medinans had fled to Mecca, including the commander of the Qurayshites at the battle of al-Harra, Abd Allah ibn Muti, who played a leading role in Mecca's defense along with al-Mukhtar al-Thaqafi. Ibn al-Zubayr was also joined by Kharijites from Yamama (central Arabia), under the leadership of Najda ibn Amir al-Hanafi. Husayn's army arrived before Mecca in September. In a first battle, Ibn al-Zubayr proved victorious, but the Umayyads persisted, and on 24 September placed the city under siege, employing catapults to bombard it with stones. Ibn al-Zubayr established his command post on the grounds of the Grand Mosque. On Sunday, 31 October, the Kaaba, over which a wooden structure covered with mattresses had been erected to protect it, caught fire and burned down, while the sacred Black Stone burst asunder. Many later sources ascribe the fault to the besiegers, with the result that \\"this siege and bombardment too figure prominently in the lists of Umayyad crimes\\" (G.R. Hawting), but more reliable accounts attribute the event to a torch borne by one of Ibn al-Zubayr's followers, which the wind wafted onto the building. The siege continued for 64 days until 26 November, when news of Yazid's death (11 November) reached the besiegers. Husayn now entered into negotiations with Ibn al-Zubayr. Although the Umayyad court at Damascus promptly declared Yazid's sickly young son, Mu'awiya II, as caliph, Umayyad authority practically collapsed in the provinces and proved shaky even in the Umayyads' home province of Syria. Husayn was therefore willing to acknowledge Ibn al-Zubayr as caliph, provided that he would issue a pardon and follow him to Syria. Ibn al-Zubayr refused the last demand, since this would place him under the control of the Syrian elites, and Husayn with his army departed for Syria.  Aftermath  The retreat of the Umayyad army left Ibn al-Zubayr in undisputed control of Mecca. With the collapse of Umayyad authority, he was soon acknowledged as the rightful caliph across most of the Muslim world, including northern Syria. His authority, however, remained mostly nominal. The Umayyads, under the leadership of Marwan ibn al-Hakam, managed to consolidate their position in Syria in the Battle of Marj Rahit, and even reclaimed Egypt, but an Umayyad attempt to recover control of Iraq was defeated by pro-Alid forces under Mukhtar al-Thaqafi near Mosul in August 686. Abd al-Malik, who had succeeded his father Marwan after the latter's death in April 685, thereafter restricted himself to securing his own position, while Ibn al- Zubayr's brother Mus'ab defeated Mukhtar at the Battle of Harura and gained control of all of Iraq in 687. In 691, Abd al-Malik managed to bring Zufar al- Kilabi's Qays back into the Umayyad fold, and advanced into the Iraq. Mus'ab was defeated and killed, and Umayyad authority re-established across the East. After another siege of Mecca which lasted from March–October 692, Ibn al- Zubayr was killed, and the civil war ended.  Rebuilding of the Kaaba  After the Umayyads' departure, Ibn al-Zubayr initiated the rebuilding of the Kaaba, but most of the people, led by Ibn Abbas, had abandoned the city fearing divine retribution; it was only when Ibn al-Zubayr himself began to demolish the remains of the old building, that they were encouraged to return and aid him. Ibn al-Zubayr's reconstruction changed the original plan, incorporating modifications that Muhammad himself is reported to have intended, but which had not been carried out during Muhammad's lifetime for fear of alienating the recently converted Meccans. The new Kaaba was built entirely of stone—the old one was of alternating layers of stone and wood—and had two doors, an entrance in the east and an exit in the west. In addition, he included the semi-circular hatīm wall into the building proper. The three fragments of the Black Stone were bound in a silver frame, and placed by Ibn al-Zubayr inside the new Kaaba. After the Umayyad reconquest of the city, the hatīm was separated again from the main building, and the western gate was walled up, reverting to the general outlines of the pre-Islamic plan. This is the form in which the Kaaba has survived to this day.

He later worked for the Spanish government as a peacemaker, guide, and interpreter. He blazed trails across the Great Plains to connect the Spanish and French settlements in Texas, New Mexico, Missouri, and Louisiana. He led three Spanish expeditions that attempted unsuccessfully to intercept and halt the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Blacksmith with the Indians The Wichita, including the Taovaya, lived in grass-thatched beehive shaped houses. They were excellent farmers. Vial comes to the notice of history in 1779 when he visited Natchitoches and New Orleans, Louisiana. He was described by Spanish authorities as a \\"gunsmith...who usually lives among the savage nations.\\"Loomis, Noel M. and Nasatir, Abraham P. Pedro Vial and the Roads to Santa Fe Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1967, p. 264 At that time, he had already lived for several years with the Taovaya, a Wichita tribe in their twin villages on the Red River at Spanish Fort, Texas and in Jefferson County, Oklahoma. Vial spoke French, Wichita and halting Spanish. He communicated with the Comanche in Wichita which many of them spokeChipman, Donald E. and Joseph, Harriet Denise, Notable Men and Women of Spanish Texas Austin: University of Texas Press, 1999, p. 213-215 The Spanish were suspicious about the activities of Vial, a Frenchman, and tried unsuccessfully to prevent him from living among the Indians.John, Elizabeth A.

In Autumn 1784, Vial came to San Antonio, the capital of Spanish Texas, with a delegation of two Frenchmen and four Wichita leaders to improve the strained relations between the Wichita and the Spanish. That being accomplished, the Spanish governor persuaded Vial to undertake a peace mission to the Comanche, who often raided Spanish settlements in Texas. Vial selected a 22-year-old Spaniard, Francisco Xavier Cháves (b. 1762—d. 1832) to accompany him. Cháves, born in New Mexico, had been captured by Comanche when he was eight years old and grew up among the Wichita and Comanche, speaking both languages. In 1784, Cháves had escaped from the Wichita and presented himself to Spanish authorities.John, \\"Inside the Comancheria\\", pp. 27-28 Vial and Cháves and two servants left Natchitoches on July 23, 1785 and journeyed to the twin villages of the Taovaya in company with two Taovaya leaders. The party arrived at the Taovaya villages on August 6. Vial's expedition to make peace with the Comanches found favor with the Taovaya and the Wichita and they journeyed to meet the various bands of the Eastern Comanche (Cuchanees or Kotsoteka), recently ravaged by smallpox, on the Little Wichita River near present-day Wichita Falls, Texas. Vial persuaded several of the Comanche chiefs to accompany him to San Antonio for peace talks with the Governor. They arrived there on September 19 and concluded a peace agreement which lasted, with occasional lapses, for about 35 years.John, Elizabeth A. H., Storms Brewed in Other Men's Worlds, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1975, pp. 662-668 Blazing trails Building on the peace agreement with the Comanche, Vial volunteered to find a route from San Antonio to the Spanish settlements in New Mexico, there being no direct contact between the Spanish in Texas and New Mexico at this time. The governor ordered him also to castigate the Taovaya for a raid on the Spanish horse herd at San Antonio. Vial and a companion, Cristóbal de los Santos. set out from San Antonio on October 4, 1786 reached the twin villages of the Taovaya on December 28. After warning the Taovaya that their friendship with the Spanish was in danger, he continued on westward, following the Red River upstream, wintering among the Comanche near Wichita Falls, Texas and continuing on in the Spring through the panhandle of Texas, reaching Santa Fe, New Mexico on May 26, 1787, thus becoming the first European to cross the Great Plains from San Antonio to Santa Fe.Loomis and Nasatir, pp. 268-286 The Spanish in Santa Fe immediately sent a return expedition to San Antonio, but Vial remained in Santa Fe until June 24, 1788 when he undertook with several companions another crossing of the Great Plains, this time to Natchitoches, arriving on August 20. Once again, Vial benefited from Comanche guides. From Natchitoches, he traveled to San Antonio again, and then returned to Santa Fe, arriving on August 20, 1789 after a journey of more than 2,400 miles (4,000 km).Loomis and Nasatir, pp. 316-368 In 1792, Vial was ordered to cross the Great Plains again, this time to open communications between New Mexico and St. Louis, Missouri. He left Santa Fe, May 21, 1792, accompanied by two young men. East of the Pecos River, Vial encountered his former colleague, Francisco Xavier Chavés, who was en route to Santa Fe to visit his parents whom he had not seen since being kidnapped by Comanche 22 years earlier. Bygones being bygones, Chavés was now traveling with a group of Comanche.Loomis and Nastir, pp. 372-373 Vial roughly followed the route of the later Santa Fe Trail in crossing the plains. Near the Arkansas River in Kansas, Vial encountered a party of Kaw Indians who took him and his companions captive, threatened to kill them, and took them to their village on the Kansas River. There, Vial was rescued by a French trader and continued his journey by boat down the Missouri River to St. Louis, arriving there on October 3, 1792. He remained in St. Louis until June 14, 1793 because of Osage raids which interrupted communications on the Missouri River. Vial returned to Santa Fe by roughly the same route, visiting the Pawnee en route and arriving in Santa Fe on November 15, 1793.Loomis and Nasatir, pp. 372-404 Chasing Lewis and Clark In 1795, Vial, suspected of being disloyal to Spain, was arrested in Santa Fe, but was soon freed and dispatched again to the Pawnee to make peace between them and the Comanche. He did so but on his return to Santa Fe he was re-arrested. He escaped and with Comanche help made his way across the Great Plains and took up residence for the next few years in the St. Louis area. He returned to Santa Fe again in 1803 and was pardoned and given back pay for his services.Loomis and Nasatir, pp. 408-418 When the Spanish heard that the Lewis and Clark Expedition was traversing territory claimed by Spain, they attempted to halt the expedition. Vial and another French frontiersman, Jose Jarvet (Chalvert) led a force of 52 soldiers, Spanish settlers, and Pueblo Indians to find and arrest the Americans. Leaving Santa Fe on August 1, 1804, Vial reached a Pawnee village in central Nebraska where they heard that Lewis and Clark had already passed that way, and were about 100 miles (160 km) distant and proceeding up the Missouri River. Vial made no effort to catch the Americans, but returned to Santa Fe on November 5.Buescher, John. \\"Trailing Lewis and Clark\\" http://www.teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24290, accessed 12 January 2013 The next year, departing Santa Fe on October 5, 1805, Vial and Jarvet with 100 men were sent out again to seek an alliance with the Plains Indians tribes to prevent the return of Lewis and Clark, who were by this time on the Columbia River, far to the northwest. Near present-day Las Animas, Colorado, Vial was attacked by about 100 well-armed and mounted Indians whose persistence caused him to return to New Mexico. He was unable to identify the tribe or language of the Indians attacking him which, given his expertise and experience, is odd.Buescher, Loomis and Nasatir, p. 436 On April 19, 1806, Vial and Jarvet departed Santa Fe northward with yet another force, this time with 300 men, to secure treaties with the plains tribes and thwart the efforts of the Americans. The expedition was soon abandoned due to desertions and Vial was back in Santa Fe by May 30.Buescher; Loomis and Nasatir, pp 446-447 The Spanish made one last effort to intercept Lewis and Clark. In June 1806, Lt. Facundo Melgares departed New Mexico with 600 men—105 soldiers, 400 militia, and 100 allied Indians—with the objective of making a peace treaty with the Pawnee and halting American incursions into what the Spanish considered their territory. Melgares left one-half his men on the Arkansas River and proceeded with the other 300 to the Pawnee villages in Nebraska. Although his talks with the Pawnee appeared successful, they also raided his horse herd. If Melgares had continued his journey another 100 miles (160 km) east to the Missouri River he might have intercepted Lewis and Clark on their return journey. The Melgares expedition was the largest military force ever dispatched by the Spanish to the Great Plains. Melgares returned to New Mexico in November 1806.Buescher; Loomis and Nasatir, p. 445 Later life Vial, now being called \\"Old Vial,\\" apparently accepted the U.S. rule of the Louisiana Purchase. On September 14, 1808, he was given a license by Meriwether Lewis to trap on the Missouri River. He also continued to serve the Spanish in New Mexico as an interpreter and guide. On October 2, 1814, Vial signed his will in Santa Fe, stating that he had neither wife nor children, and leaving his meager belongings to Maria Manuela Martin. He presumably died shortly thereafter.Loomis and Nasatir, pp 535-540 Pedro Vial was the first European to make \\"the first overland trip from San Antonio to Santa Fe; the man who made the first overland trip from Santa Fe to Natchitoches, the man who made the first transit of the Santa Fe Trail between Santa Fe and St. Louis.\\" It was, however, the United States rather than the Spanish who benefited most from his explorations. The historian, Abraham P. Nasatir called him the \\"greatest frontiersman of them all.\\"Loomis and Nasatir, pp. x, 540 It is possible that Vial's travels were even more extensive than those recorded. In 1787, he gave a map of \\"territories transited by Pedro Vial\\" to Spanish authorities.

The drama serial ended on 4 March 2013.  Plot  Na kaho tum mere nahin is a tale of a married couple Meerab (Ahsan Khan) and Mehreen (Saba Qamar). It shows how their life suffers due to Meerab's elder sister Bano apa. She always asks for money from her brother for running her family. In this way, she annoys Mehreen because Mehreen wants to give a better education and facilities to her children Meeran and Humaima. But, Meerab also spends money on his sister Bano apa. Bano apa's husband never worries about his children and never tries to earn money for his family. Later, Meerab and Mehreen's university friend Maya (Rubab Hashim) enters their life and the situation becomes more complicated. She proposed to Meerab during university days but he rejected her proposal as he liked Mehreen. After many years, Maya comes back in their life. Maya is married to Arsalan (Javed Sheikh) ,whom she only married for his reputation and money. Their marriage is an agreement. She becomes friends with Mehreen to enter her life and also gives a high profile job to Meerab in her company. She ,then, asks Arsalan to give divorce to her. Since, he does not believe in forcing a woman, so he agrees to give her a divorce. Maya tries to take sympathies of Meerab and says him that Arslan was the one who wanted their separation. Mehreen starts becoming aware of Maya's intentions and stops working for her and starts working for Arslan. Mehreen knows that it was Maya who asked Arsalan to give divorce to her. Mehreen tries to make Meerab understand that Maya's intentions are not right but Meerab thinks that Maya is innocent. As Meerab works for Maya, she gives him house and company car and becomes friend with him. Meerab does not want Mehreen to work in Arslan's company and asks her to work for Maya again, but she denies. Maya , then proposes Meerab but he says that he cannot marry her. Mehreen is shocked when she heard about Maya's proposal. Mehreen plans to stop working at Arsalan's office but has to work for her children's needs. Fights and misunderstandings in the couple due to Maya reached to an extent that Mehreen leaves home with children and starts living in their old house. Meerab takes his children along with him and says Mehreen to come with him but she says that she will only come back if he leaves the job at Maya's company. But he does not agree . Few days later, when Meerab believes untrue statements by Maya, he plans to marry her. In the meantime, Mehreen plans to take custody of her children. She also has to help Arslan in court so that he can take his property back from Maya. He says Mehreen to give a false statement in court that Meerab and Maya had a pre-planning of grasping his property before Arslan and Maya's marriage. Mehreen could not give this false statement in the court against Meerab as she could not lie after holding the Qur'an and also she cares for her husband's respect. Maya and Meerab win the case. Arslan asks Mehreen to marry him. She agrees as she sees Meerab on the spot. Later, when Mehreen gets Maya and Meerab's marriage card, she asks Meerab for divorce. Meerab is shocked to hear about the card because he wanted his second marriage to be simple. On the other hand, Bano apa's son kills a person by mistake and kidnaps Meerab's son for ransom so that he can give that money to the victim's relatives. Mehreen and Meerab are tensed and Maya helps to find the kidnapper. Bano apa's son is jailed. Meerab comes to know that Maya forced his previous company's boss to expel Meerab from job and then herself makes him the managing director of her company. On the day of Meerab and Maya's marriage, Bano apa's husband is killed by the relatives of the person who was killed by Bano apa's son. Listening the news of his death, Meerab goes to Bano apa and did not marry Maya. Bano apa apologizes from Mehreen as she does not like Mehreen and used to take rights of Mehreen and her children. She forgives her. Bano apa also asks for forgiveness form Meerab and makes him understand that Mehreen is a nice woman and he should not leave her. Mehreen denies Arsalan's offer also because she does not want to bring a step-father for her children. Meerab feels that Maya made a conspiracy and goes to Arsalan to know about the background. He then goes to Maya and comes to know about her intentions as she wanted to marry him from a long time and made a conspiracy against Mehreen and him. He does not marry her and leaves her job, he goes back to Mehreen and asks for her apology. Maya goes to her office in tension of her defeat and dies due to nervous breakdown. Later, Meerab and Mehreen are shown living their old happy life with their children.

The team is not a member of the International Cricket Council, but is a member of the Leeward Islands Cricket Association, which itself is a member association of the West Indies Cricket Board, and players from the British Virgin Islands generally represent the Leeward Islands cricket team at domestic level and the West Indies at international level. The British Virgin Islands have however played as a separate entity in matches which held Twenty20 status, but has not appeared in first-class or List A cricket. History A British Virgin Islands cricket team first appeared in West Indian cricket in the 1991 Leeward Islands Tournament against the United States Virgin Islands at the Lionel Roberts Stadium, Charlotte Amalie. Prior to that a Combined Virgin Islands team had taken part in the 1988 Leeward Islands Tournament. The following season the team played against a touring Marylebone Cricket Club side and throughout the 1990s it participated in the Leeward Islands One-Day tournament. Its participation in that tournament continued until 1998 after which its place was taken by a reconstituted Combined Virgin Islands team before the BVI again started participating separately for the one-day tournaments in 2003 and 2004 while a Combined Virgin Islands team participated in the Leeward Islands 3-day tournament. In February 2002 the islands hosted their only first-class cricket match, when the Leeward Islands played the Windward Islands at the A.O. Shirley Recreation Ground, Roadtown. In 2005 the BVI and USVI again ceased to participate separately in all Leeward Islands tournaments (one day and three- day tournaments) and their places were taken by the Combined Virgin Islands until 2008 after which they participated separately again in all Leeward Islands tournaments. As part of Allen Stanford's vision for cricket in the West Indies, the United States Virgin Islands were invited to take part in the 2006 Stanford 20/20, whose matches held official Twenty20 status. Stanford gave US$100,000 for their participation. They played a single match in the tournament, losing to Saint Lucia by 7 wickets in their preliminary round match. Two years later, they were invited to take part in the 2008 Stanford 20/20, playing a single preliminary round match against Dominica, which they lost by 66 runs. Following the reorganisation of domestic Twenty20 cricket in the West Indies in the aftermath of the fraud convictions against Allen Stanford, the United States Virgin Islands were excluded from the revamped regional tournament. The team's last recorded appearance in the Leeward Islands One-Day Tournament came against Nevis in 2011.

He was born in Manhattan in 1923 to an Italian father and an Irish mother. Sombrotto became an official member of the National Association of Letter Carriers in 1947 and played a huge part in the U.S. postal strike of 1970. Sombrotto helped to expand the union into more than 100 cities and involved more than 200,000 new members. He retired in 2002 and finished with over 300,000 members and died in 2013 aged 89 at Port Washington, New York. Early life Vincent Raymond Sombrotto was born on June 15, 1923 in Manhattan, New York to Raymond and Agnes Sombrotto. His mother supported the family by working as a seamstress. He served in the US Navy during World War II. After his service, he worked as a truck driver before taking a part-time job sorting mail at the Grand Central Station post office. The job led him to delivering mail for the next twenty years. The Postal Strike of 1970 Nixon's Proclamation 3972 declared a national state of emergency, and authorized military control over the post office On March 1970, members of NALC Branch 36 met in Manhattan and voted to call a wildcat strike, as postal employees were by law not permitted to collectively bargain. The strike was called in response to low wages, poor working conditions, and an act of Congress to increase the salaries of postal workers by 4% and their own pay by 41%. Sombrotto and the members of the union began picketing the next day. The strike quickly spread throughout the country, growing to more than 210,000 workers. President Richard Nixon appeared on national television to order the employees back to work, but this only stiffened the will of the workers and lead others to join the strike. As the strike grew, Nixon used the military and the as strike breakers. Instead of backing down, workers became more vocal and the strike gained support. Workers from other government agencies announced they would strike if Nixon pursued legal action against postal employees. Nixon spoke to the nation again on March 23, asking workers to return to their jobs and announcing he would deploy the National Guard to deliver mail in New York. This announcement was accompanied by Proclamation 3972, which declared a national emergency. The national emergency proclamation was never revoked. Nixon then ordered 24,000 military personnel to begin distribution of mail. Operation Graphic Hand was, at its peak, more than 18,500 military personnel from the Army, National Guard, Army Reserve, Air National Guard, Navy, Air Force, and Navy Marine Reserve assigned to seventeen post offices in New York. The resulting expansion of presidential power was investigated in 1973 by an agency of Congress called the Special Committee on the Termination of the National Emergency, which warned the national state of emergency gave the president the right to seize property, organize the means of production, and to institute martial law. After the soldiers were briefly called, a compromise was reached with the postal unions and the wildcat strike ended quickly. The strike resulted in the passage of the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 by the US Congress. The law established the United States Postal Service, a corporation- like independent agency with an official monopoly on the delivery of mail in the United States. It also gave the National Association of Letter Carriers and other postal unions the right to collectively negotiate a national agreement with the newly formed United States Postal Service. President of the NALC On December 2, 1971, Sombrotto was elected President of New York Local 36. He and six other members of Branch 36 were known as \\"The Magnificent Seven\\". This group of union organizers worked to reform and democratize the union. In 1978, Sombrotto was elected as President of the National Association of Letter Carriers, a position he held for the next 24 years. As president, Sombrotto led seven contract negotiations that provided basic wage increases in every contract. In 1993, he played a key role in helping to reform the Hatch Act, which forbade the partisan political activities of federal employees. The union also increased its philanthropic activity under Sombrotto's leadership. In particular, the NALC raised millions of dollars for the Muscular Dystrophy Association, and their annual food drive has become one of the world's largest one-day food collection drives. Legacy The Walter P. Reuther Library in Detroit, Michigan houses the NALC Office of the President: Vincent Sombrotto Records. This collection illustrates his time in office such as administrative functions, political involvement, organizational affiliations, and relationships with union members. In 2014, New York Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney introduced a bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives and was signed into law by President Barack Obama which renamed the Grand Central Station Post Office in New York City to the \\"Vincent R. Sombrotto Post Office.\\" The Vincent R. Sombrotto Memorial Park in Washington, D.C. is also named in his honor.

The government decided not to deport his wife and daughter until Weldon was located, so Mrs. Chan began working at a cafeteria at the University of British Columbia and Alice enrolled in a private Roman Catholic elementary school. In 1963, Immigration Minister Guy Favreau granted Chan a one-year residency permit and suggested that he be granted landed immigrant status. This was later cited as evidence of Favreau's promise to \\"eliminate any prejudice in immigration matters\\". Arthur W. Hughes wrote a folk song, \\"The Ballad of Weldon Chan,\\" satirizing the efforts by the Canadian government to find and deport Chan. The song was intended to object to \\"unjust treatment of an allegedly illegal Chinese immigrant\\" and bring \\"attention to the long history of racist, anti-Chinese immigration policies in Canada\\". \\"The Story of Weldon Chan\\" was recorded by folk singer Karen James on her self-titled album in 1961. It was released as part of the Smithsonian Folkways collection Classic Canadian Songs; one reviewer called it \\"the one you won't be able to get out of your head\\".

Plot summary Kamaal Nizami (Usman Peerzada) is a haughty and arrogant wealthy businessman who believes that relations are to be made in equal class only. His wife, Saira (Isra Ghazal) has an equally opposite opinion from him, as she thinks that all humans are equal and hence everyone should be treated equally. Their elder son Ansar is much like his father in beliefs and mannerisms, but his young brother and Kamaal & Saira's younger son, Sherry is too close to his mother and often indulges in playing with the kids of household servants, thinking that all kids are like him. He befriends Zoya, who happens to be the only daughter of his driver Bashir Ahmed (Rashid Mehmood) and affectionately refers to her as ‘Zoyi’. This fact is not looked upon favorably by Kamaal, as he wants Sherry to make friends among rich & renowned families. Zoya, though comes from a poor background, is a hard-working & friendly-natured girl who wins Saira's heart by her dedication towards academics, and as a result, the lady gets her admission done in Sherry's school, where mostly children from rich families come. No matter how much Kamaal feels furious, this doesn’t stops Sherry from playing with Zoya and even exchanging lunchbox with her. Parvez (Khalid Anam) and his wife Nyla (Seemi Pasha), family friends of Kamaal, offend Saira's decision of getting Zoya admitted to a high-class school. Anam, their daughter, develops envy towards Zoya as she scores higher than her in academics and wins Student of the Year trophy every year. Things take a turn during Sherry's birthday party, where Zoya is humiliated by Anam and Zeeshan, her brother, as both call her a ‘servant’s kid’ and comment that she is not worthy of attending such parties of wealthy families. Parvez and Nyla support their children saying that Kamaal & Saira should not have invited Zoya to the party, no matter if Sherry likes spending time with her. This incident takes a toll on Kamaal's mind, and as a result, he decides to send Sherry abroad for further studies so that he can be away from Zoya and develop some upper-class mannerisms. Few years later, a grown up Sherry (Sheheryar Munawar Siddiqui) returns for his brother's wedding functions and there is a fun time in the household. Kamaal informs Bashir about Sherry's return, saying that he should refrain from sending Zoya (Ayeza Khan) to their house till Ansar (Hasan Ahmed) is married. Unknown to the family, Zoya is bothered by Ansar's behavior, as he often holds her hand in alone, or stops her way, which makes her dislike him and his habits. During night time, Sherry happens to meet Zoya when they’re in the lawn area and collide with each other, as he stops her from falling, and seeing this, Kamaal gets agitated, confronting Sherry about the incident. Though Sherry assures him that he has nothing to do with Zoya and that they accidentally came across each other, he can’t stop from thinking about her again and again. On the other hand, a grown up Anam (Urwa Hocane) is same as before, being arrogant & a spoilt-brat and also Kamaal's favorite. She instantly develops a liking for Sherry when she sees his photo and quickly befriends him when he comes at Kamaal's office. Sherry has almost forgotten all the moments that he used to spend at servant's quarter or playing with Zoya, but he feels himself being drawn towards her. Zoya's college friend Aiman's (Iman Ali) brother, Shahzeb (Imran Aslam) shows interest in marrying Zoya due to her kind nature, and he even invites her through Aiman at their place for dinner. Anam too is invited there, and is shocked to realize that Zoya is the same girl for whom Shahzeb rejected to marry her. She then indirectly insults Zoya by asking her about her family background in front of everyone, and on knowing about her father being a driver, Shahzeb's mother straightly announces that she cannot allow a servant's daughter to become Shahzeb's wife, despite of the fact that he still has interest in Zoya. During wedding functions, Anam leaves no chance of humiliating or insulting Zoya, seeing which Sherry feels sorry for her. Ansar marries Mariam (Zhalay Sarhadi), following which Anam persuades Sherry to believe that he is in love with her and thus, being confused about his own feelings, he proposes to her. Anam declares about this proposal to her parents, compelling them to go to Kamaal's place and talk about their wedding. However, seeing Anam in such a hurry and her behavior towards poor helpless and needy people, Sherry is forced to think about his relationship with her again. He rather begins developing a soft-corner for Zoya on learning about her friendly and helping nature, and invites her to his birthday party which is actually organized by Anam. Seeing Zoya with him in the party, Anam blasts out at her angrily, which makes Sherry defend her, admitting that Zoya is a good friend to him and since the birthday party is for him, it is his right to invite all his close friends. Zeeshan (Tipu Sharif) misbehaves with Zoya at the party, when Sherry comes to her rescue and there's a fight between both guys, seeing which Zoya gets tensed and this makes Anam sadistically happy. On the other hand, Saira and Mariam are taken aback by Sherry's proposal to Anam, as they assume that he never showed any interest in her and Mariam even senses that he loves Zoya, but remains silent. She rather discusses this matter with Ansar, who warns her not to speak anything in front of Kamaal. Saira, though dislikes Anam because of her arrogance and attitudes, doesn’t dares to speak anything in front of her husband. Kamaal is too elated with the fact that Sherry has proposed to Anam, and gets started with the preparations of their engagement. But during the engagement evening, Sherry denies to get engaged with Anam, saying that he was too confused while making a decision, which shocks everyone. He wastes no time in proposing to Zoya, who says that she would need some time to think about it. A disheartened Anam & Kamaal decide to create differences between Sherry and Zoya knowing about his proposal. Anam calls Zoya at Shahzeb's place through Ayeza (Farhat Rizvi), her best friend and Shahzeb's younger sister, saying that he is not feeling well and no one is at home to look after him. The next moment, she calls Sherry, saying that Zoya is having an affair with Shahzeb without anyone's knowledge. This evil plan works and Sherry is heartbroken to see Zoya with Shahzeb alone at his home. After seeing his daughter being humiliated by Kamaal in front of everyone, Bashir decides to leave for his village with her so that they can spend their life with respect at least. Assuming it the right time to gain Sherry's love again, Anam tries to talk to him, to spend time with him, but he is too hurt by Zoya's betrayal to talk to anyone, and rather remains alone all the time. Her anger deepens to such an extent that she faces an accident by rash-driving. Shahzeb gets to know about Anam's plan through Ayeza and even scolds her for being a part of this disgusting plan. He calls Sherry to tell him everything but his all efforts go in vain as Sherry doesn't believe him. There, Ansar declares to Mariam that he has been having an affair with his secretary Seema (Nida Khan), sensing that she would disclose about their affair to his wife if he doesn’t marry her. He assumes that Mariam would be mad at him and speak out everything to Saira and Kamaal, but to his surprise, she visits at Seema's place and talks to her peacefully, apologizing for whatever Ansar did with her. This incident brings a change in Ansar, and he says to Mariam that there's a feeling of guilt & anxiousness in his heart, to which she replies that he might have knowingly or unknowingly hurt someone innocent because of which he has such feelings. Realizing his wrongdoings towards Sherry and Zoya, he decides to tell the truth to Sherry, who has finally declared his decision of not marrying Anam and rather decides to leave Pakistan forever to settle in London against his parents’ wish. On reaching at the airport, Ansar discloses the truth to his brother, which extremely disappoints Sherry. He returns to confront his father at his office and then at Parvez's home to talk to Anam about her disgusting plan, which heightens her anger and she goes in a state of depression. Kamaal is astonished to learn that Sherry is heading off to Zoya's village to get her apology and marry her. After an argument with his father, he leaves the home, much to Saira's sadness. Zeeshan is raged to see his sister in depression, and sets out to find Sherry. There Mariam is delighted to learn about her pregnancy, and waits for Ansar to come home so that she could give this news to him face-to-face. Zeeshan comes at Kamaal's home, and finding Ansar step out of his car, he threatens him to send Sherry to apologize to Anam, but Ansar suggests him to solve the matter peacefully rather than by arguing unnecessarily. Out of extreme rage, Zeeshan brings out a gun from his pocket and frantically shoots Ansar to death, later on being flabbergasted at his own act. Kamaal and his family is deeply moved after Ansar's death, and Sherry, being not in contact with his family in any way, remains unknown of his brother's death and reaches at Zoya's place to apologize to Bashir and her. He is shocked to learn that Bashir has fixed Zoya's marriage with her paternal cousin Liyaqat, who is a typical chauvinist. There Zeeshan is arrested by the police, after which Parvez suffers a heart- attack and is admitted to hospital. Kamaal and Saira miss Sherry even more after Ansar's death. On the other hand, Liyaqat learns about Sherry's feelings for Zoya and Bashir comes to know about his daughter's feelings for Sherry. Liyaqat confronts Sherry angrily, after which the entire matter comes in front of the villagers and hence the final decision is left to be taken by the Panchayat. After listening to Sherry's innocent wish of marrying Zoya, the Panchayat asks him to bring his parents to the village within seven days for asking her hand in marriage or else she would be married off to Liyaqat. With the hope to take help from Ansar and Mariam, Sherry reaches back at his home, only to find his deeply broken parents who inform him about Ansar's death, hearing which he is too shocked to speak anything. He talks to Mariam, giving condolence to her and telling her about whatever happened at Zoya's village. Seeing his son and daughter-in-law being helpful towards each other, Kamaal decides to get Mariam married to Sherry so that Ansar's child could remain in their family. Anam is distressed to see her father being in a critical condition and brother being behind bars. Nyla blames her for all this mess, in reply of which Anam confesses that her arrogance and attitude is a result of her bringing up. Nyla realizes her mistake in the teachings which she gave to her children. Anam goes to meet Zeeshan in jail where he asks her to talk to Kamaal for his bail as he will agree to her plea since he likes her. Anam argues with him on this matter when he says that she has become too selfish to even help her own brother. He confesses that he didn’t mean to shoot Ansar but whatever happened was an accident. When Sherry comes to his father to talk about Zoya, Kamaal, before listening to him, pleads him to marry Mariam for the sake of Ansar's child. Seeing him in a helpless state and asking his son for something with much pleading, Sherry unwillingly agrees to his wish. Upon knowing this, Mariam is astonished, since she knew about Sherry being in love with Zoya and asks Kamaal to get them married instead of forcing Sherry into such a relationship where neither he nor Mariam would remain happy. She further says that she has always looked upon Sherry as a little brother and also that she would be like a daughter to Kamaal and Saira, thus living with them forever with Ansar's child. On the other hand, a dejected Anam sadly pleads to a road-beggar to pray for all her problems being solved soon, since she has heard that God listens to the prayers of needy & helpless very soon. The beggar replies to her that the Almighty listens to everyone's prayers only if we pray with a pure heart. This reply brings a change in Anam and she begins realizing her impolite behavior all this while towards such helpless and needy people. Saira senses that Sherry is not happy with the idea of marrying Mariam and she tries to talk to him, when Kamaal comes to them and surprises them by agreeing to get Sherry and Zoya married. A delighted Sherry then heads off to Zoya's village along with his family, and receiving this news, both Bashir and Zoya are elated. A week later, Zoya is shown serving tea to everyone as Kamaal praises her hand-made tea and all are happy, just when Nyla and Anam reach there, pleading Kamaal to release Zeeshan from being punished. Kamaal gives to Mariam, the right of taking decision in this regard since she is Ansar's wife. She is about to leave from there when Zoya stops her and says that one can never bring back the dead and forgiving someone is the greatest gift anyone can give. Mariam agrees to get Zeeshan out of jail upon hearing this, after which Anam apologizes to Zoya and Sherry for her rude and ill-mannered behavior towards both, especially Zoya. Sherry feels happy to have a life-partner like her, while Kamaal is proud on Zoya as he hugs her lovingly and the show ends on a happy note.

The term \\"Neo-Vedanta\\" was coined by German Indologist Paul Hacker, in a pejorative way, to distinguish modern developments from \\"traditional\\" Advaita Vedanta. Scholars have repeatedly argued that these modern interpretations incorporate western ideas into traditional Indian religions, especially Advaita Vedanta, which is asserted as central or fundamental to Hindu culture. Other scholars have described a Greater Advaita Vedānta, which developed since the medieval period. Drawing on this broad pool of sources, after Muslim rule in India was replaced by British rule, Hindu religious and political leaders and thinkers responded to western colonialism and orientalism, contributing to the Indian freedom struggle and the modern national and religious identity of Hindus in the Republic of India. This societal aspect is covered under the term of Hindu reform movements. Among the main proponents of such modern interpretations of Hinduism were Vivekananda, Aurobindo and Radhakrishnan, who to some extent also contributed to the emergence of Neo-Hindu movements in the West. Neo-Vedanta has been influential in the perception of Hinduism, both in the west and in the higher educated classes in India. It has received appraisal for its \\"solution of synthesis\\", but has also been criticised for its Universalism. The terms \\"Neo- Hindu\\" or \\"Neo-Vedanta\\" themselves have also been criticised for its polemical usage, the prefix \\"Neo-\\" then intended to imply that these modern interpretations of Hinduism are \\"inauthentic\\" or in other ways problematic. Definition and etymology According to Halbfass, the terms \\"Neo-Vedanta\\" and \\"Neo-Hinduism\\" refer to \\"the adoption of Western concepts and standards and the readiness to reinterpret traditional ideas in light of these new, imported and imposed modes of thought\\". Prominent in Neo-Vedanta is Vivekananda, who's theology, according to Madaio, is often characterised in earlier scholarship as \\"a rupture from 'traditional' or 'classical' Hindusim, particularly the 'orthodox' Advaita Vedanta of the eight century Shankara.\\" The term \\"Neo-Vedanta\\" appears to have arisen in Bengal in the 19th century, where it was used by both Indians and Europeans. Brian Hatcher wrote that \\"the term neo-Vedanta was first coined by Christian commentators, some of whom were firsthand observers of developments in Brahmo theology... engaged in open, sometimes acrimonious debates with the Brahmos, whom they partly admired for their courage in abandoning traditions of polytheism and image worship but whom they also scorned for having proffered to other Hindus a viable alternative to conversion\\". Halbfass wrote that \\"it seems likely\\" that the term \\"Neo-Hinduism\\" was invented by a Bengali, Brajendra Nath Seal (1864–1938), who used the term to characterise the literary work of Bankim Chandra Chatterjee (1838–1894). The term \\"neo-Vedanta\\" was used by Christian missionaries as well as Hindu traditionalists to criticize the emerging ideas of the Brahmo Samaj, a critical usage whose \\"polemical undertone [...] is obvious\\". Ayon Maharaj regards the continued scholarly use of the term \\"Neo- Vedanta\\" as only a \\"seemingly benign practice\\". Maharaj asserts that the term Neo-Vedanta \\"is misleading and unhelpful for three main reasons\\": The term \\"neo-Hinduism\\" was used by a Jesuit scholar resident in India, Robert Antoine (1914–1981), from whom it was borrowed by Paul Hacker, who used it to demarcate these modernist ideas from \\"surviving traditional Hinduism,\\" and treating the Neo-Advaitins as \\"dialogue partners with a broken identity who cannot truly and authentically speak for themselves and for the Indian tradition\\". Hacker made a distinction between \\"Neo-Vedanta\\" and \\"neo- Hinduism\\", seeing nationalism as a prime concern of \\"neo-Hinduism\\". History Although neo-Vedanta proper developed in the 19th century in response to western colonialism, it has got deeper origins in the Muslim period of India. Michael s. Allen and Anand Venkatkrishnan note that Shankara is very well-studies, but \\"scholars have yet to provide even a rudimentary, let alone comprehensive account of the history of Advaita Vedanta in the centuries leading up to the colonial period.\\" =\\"Greater Advaita Vedanta\\"=Unification of Hinduism Well before the advent of British influence, with beginnings that some scholars have argued significantly predate Islamic influence, hierarchical classifications of the various orthodox schools were developed. According to Nicholson, already between the twelfth and the sixteenth century, The tendency of \\"a blurring of philosophical distinctions\\" has also been noted by Burley. Lorenzen locates the origins of a distinct Hindu identity in the interaction between Muslims and Hindus, and a process of \\"mutual self-definition with a contrasting Muslim other\\", which started well before 1800. Both the Indian and the European thinkers who developed the term \\"Hinduism\\" in the 19th century were influenced by these philosophers. Within these so-called doxologies Advaita Vedanta was given the highest position, since it was regarded to be most inclusive system. Vijnanabhiksu, a 16th- century philosopher and writer, is still an influential proponent of these doxologies. He's been a prime influence on 19th century Hindu modernists like Vivekananda, who also tried to integrate various strands of Hindu thought, taking Advaita Vedanta as its most representative specimen. Influence of yogic tradition While Indologists like Paul Hacker and Wilhelm Halbfass took Shankara's system as the measure for an \\"orthodox\\" Advaita Vedanta, the living Advaita Vedanta tradition in medieval times was influenced by, and incorporated elements from, the yogic tradition and texts like the Yoga Vasistha and the Bhagavata Purana. The Yoga Vasistha became an authoritative source text in the Advaita vedanta tradition in the 14th century, while Vidyāraņya's Jivanmuktiviveka (14th century) was influenced by the (Laghu-)Yoga-Vasistha, which in turn was influenced by Kashmir Shaivism. Vivekananda's 19th century emphasis on nirvikalpa samadhi was preceded by medieval yogic influences on Advaita Vedanta. In the 16th and 17th centuries, some Nath and hatha yoga texts also came within the scope of the developing Advaita Vedanta tradition. =Western colonialism and Hindu reform movements=Western colonialism With the colonisation of India by the British, a darker era in the history of India began. Prior to this, Muslim rule over North India had had a drastic effect on Hinduism (and Buddhism) through systematic persecution. While the Indian society was greatly impacted, its economy however continued to remain one of the largest in the World. Muslim rule over Southern India was also relatively short-lived before the 17th century. In contrast to the Muslim rulers, the British actively engaged in destroying the Indian economy as well. The economic destruction wrought by restrictive British policies and Industrial revolution in Europe, led to the dismantling of the prevailing decentralized education systems in India in the 18th century. The British state-supported education system, after the English Education Act of 1835, emphasized western religions and thoughts at the cost of indigenous ones. The British also nurtured and were involved, post 1813, in the aggressive propagation of Protestant Christianity. This was concomitant with the British propaganda machine's involvement in the spreading anti-Hindu sentiments. Hindu reform movements In response to the British rule and cultural dominance, Hindu reform movements developed, propagating societal and religious reforms, exemplifying what Percival Spear has called Neo-Vedanta, also called \\"neo-Hinduism\\" is a central theme in these reform-movements. The earliest of these reform-movements was Ram Mohan Roy's Brahmo Samaj, who strived toward a purified and monotheistic Hinduism. Major proponents Neo- vedanta's main proponents are the leaders of the Brahmo Samaj, especially Ram Mohan Roy, while Vivekananda, Gandhi, Aurobindo and Radhakrishnan are the main proponents of neo-Hinduism. =Ram Mohan Roy and the Brahmo Samaj= The Brahmo Samaj was the first of the 19th century reform movements. Its founder, Ram Mohan Roy (1772–1833), strived toward a universalistic interpretation of Hinduism. He rejected Hindu mythology, but also the Christian trinity. He found that Unitarianism came closest to true Christianity, and had a strong sympathy for the Unitarians. He founded a missionary committee in Calcutta, and in 1828 asked for support for missionary activities from the American Unitarians. By 1829, Roy had abandoned the Unitarian Committee, but after Roy's death, the Brahmo Samaj kept close ties to the Unitarian Church, who strived towards a rational faith, social reform, and the joining of these two in a renewed religion. The Unitarians were closely connected to the Transcendentalists, who were interested in and influenced by Indian religions early on. Rammohan Roy's ideas were \\"altered ... considerably\\" by Debendranath Tagore, who had a Romantic approach to the development of these new doctrines, and questioned central Hindu beliefs like reincarnation and karma, and rejected the authority of the Vedas. Tagore also brought this \\"neo-Hinduism\\" closer in line with western esotericism, a development which was furthered by Keshubchandra Sen. Sen was influenced by Transcendentalism, an American philosophical-religious movement strongly connected with Unitarianism, which emphasized personal religious experience over mere reasoning and theology. Sen strived to \\"an accessible, non-renunciatory, everyman type of spirituality\\", introducing \\"lay systems of spiritual practice\\" which can be regarded as prototypes of the kind of Yoga-exercises which Vivekananda populurized in the west. The theology of the Brahmo Samaj was called \\"neo-Vedanta\\" by Christian commentators, who \\"partly admired [the Brahmos] for their courage in abandoning traditions of polytheism and image worship, but whom they also scorned for having proffered to other Hindus a viable alternative to conversion\\". Critics accused classical Vedanta of being \\"cosmic self- infatuation\\" and \\"ethical nihilism\\". Brahmo Samaj leaders responded to such attacks by redefining the Hindu path to liberation, making the Hindu path available to both genders and all castes, incorporating \\"notions of democracy and worldly improvement\\". =Vivekananda (1863–1902)= According to Gavin Flood, Vivekananda (1863–1902) (Narendranath Dutta) \\"is a figure of great importance in the development of a modern Hindu self-understanding and in formulating the West's view of Hinduism\\". He played a major role in the revival of Hinduism, and the spread of Advaita Vedanta to the west via the Ramakrishna Mission. In 1880 Vivekananda joined Keshub Chandra Sen's Nava Vidhan, which was established by Sen after meeting Ramakrishna and reconverting from Christianity to Hinduism. Narendranath (a.k.a. Narendra) became a member of a Freemasonry lodge \\"at some point before 1884\\" and of the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj in his twenties, a breakaway faction of the Brahmo Samaj led by Keshub Chandra Sen and Debendranath Tagore. From 1881 to 1884 he was also active in Sen's Band of Hope, which tried to discourage the youth from smoking and drinking. It was in this cultic milieu that Narendra became acquainted with western esotericism. His initial beliefs were shaped by Brahmo concepts, which included belief in a formless God and the deprecation of idolatry, and a \\"streamlined, rationalized, monotheistic theology strongly coloured by a selective and modernistic reading of the Upanisads and of the Vedanta\\". He propagated the idea that \\"the divine, the absolute, exists within all human beings regardless of social status\\", and that \\"seeing the divine as the essence of others will promote love and social harmony\\". During this period, he came in contact with Ramakrishna, who eventually became his guru. Maharaj has argued that Ramakrishna gradually brought Narendra to a Vedanta- based worldview that \\"provides the ontological basis for 'śivajñāne jīver sevā', the spiritual practice of serving human beings as actual manifestations of God.\\" Maharaj describes how, \\"on one occasion in 1884, Sri Ramakrishna was explaining... that one of the main religious practices of Vaiṣṇavas is 'showing compassion to all beings' (sarva jīve dayā)\\", and that Ramakrishna then asserted \\"It must not be compassion, but service to all. Serve them, knowing that they are all manifestations of God [śivajñāne jīver sevā]\\". According to Maharaj, Ramakrishna teachings that day \\"affected the young Naren so deeply that he took his friends aside afterward and explained its profound ethical significance to them\\", stating Vivekananda's acquaintance with western esotericism made him very successful in western esoteric circles, beginning with his speech in 1893 at the Parliament of Religions. Vivekananda adapted traditional Hindu ideas and religiosity to suit the needs and understandings of his western audiences, who were especially attracted by and familiar with western esoteric traditions and movements like Transcendentalism and New thought. An important element in his adaptation of Hindu religiosity was the introduction of his four yoga's model, which includes Raja yoga, his interpretation of Patanjali's Yoga sutras, which offered a practical means to realize the divine force within which is central to modern western esotericism. In 1896 his book Raja Yoga was published, which became an instant success and was highly influential in the western understanding of Yoga. In line with Advaita vedanta texts like Dŗg-Dŗśya-Viveka (14th century) and Vedantasara (of Sadananda) (15th century), Vivekananda saw samadhi as a means to attain liberation. =Gandhi= Gandhi (1869–1948) has become a worldwide hero of tolerance and striving toward freedom. In his own time, he objected to the growing forces of Indian nationalism, communalism and the subaltern response. Gandhi saw religion as a uniting force, confessing the equality of all religions. He synthesized the Astika, Nastika and Semitic religions, promoting an inclusive culture for peaceful living. Gandhi pled for a new hermeneutics of Indian scriptures and philosophy, observing that \\"there are ample religious literature both in Astika and Nastika religions supporting for a pluralistic approach to religious and cultural diversity\\". The orthodox Advaita Vedanta, and the heterodox Jain concept Anekantavada provided him concepts for an \\"integral approach to religious pluralism\\". He regarded Advaita as a universal religion (\\"dharma\\") which could unite both the orthodox and nationalistic religious interpretations, as the subaltern alternatives. Hereby Gandhi offers an interpretation of Hindutva which is basically different from the Sangh Parivar-interpretation. The concept of anekantavada offered Gandhi an axiom that \\"truth is many-sided and relative\\". It is \\"a methodology to counter exclusivism or absolutism propounded by many religious interpretations\\". It has the capability of synthesizing different percpetions of reality. In Gandhi's view, Anekantavada also gives room to an organic understanding of \\"spatio-temporal process\\", that is, the daily world and its continued change. The doctrine of anekantavada is a plea for samvada, \\"dialogue\\", and an objection against proselytizing activities. =Sarvepalli Radhakrisnan= Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was a major force in the further popularization of Neo-Vedanta. As a schoolboy, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was inspired by Vivekananda's lectures, in which he found \\"an ennobling vision of truth and harmony as well as a message of Indian pride\\". He was educated by Christian missionaries, and wrote a master thesis on Vedanta and ethics. In later life, he became vice-president and president of India. According to Rinehart, he presented his view of Hinduism as the view of Hinduism. Central in his presentation was the claim that religion is fundamentally a kind of experience, anubhava,Michael Hawley, Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan reducing religion \\"to the core experience of reality in its fundamental unity\\". For Radhakrishnan, Vedanta was the essence and bedrock of religion. Philosophy=Politics=Nationalism Vivekananda \\"occupies a very important place\\" in the development of Indian nationalismThe theory of nationalism by Swami Vivekananda, The New Indian Express, 16 November 2013 (first published in Vedanta Kesari, Ramakrishna Math, Chennai). as well as Hindu nationalism, and has been called \\"the prophet of nationalism\\", pleading for a \\"Hindu regeneration\\". According to S.N. Sen, his motto \\"Arise, Awake and do not stop until the goal is reached\\" had a strong appeal for millions of Indians. According to Bijoy Misra, a private blogger, Social activism According to Bijoy Misra, a private blogger, =Religion=Unity of Hinduism Neo-Vedanta aims to present Hinduism as a \\"homogenized ideal of Hinduism\\" with Advaita Vedanta as its central doctrine. It presents Neo-Vedanta was influenced by Oriental scholarship, which portrayed Hinduism as a \\"single world religion\\", and denigrated the heterogeneity of Hindu beliefs and practices as 'distortions' of the basic teachings of Vedanta. Universalism Following Ramakrishna, neo-Vedanta regards all religions to be equal paths to liberation, but also gives a special place to Hinduism, as the ultimate universal religion. The various religious faiths of the world are regarded to help people to attain God- realization, the experience of God or the Ultimate. According to some authors, this is expressed in the Rig Veda,Rig Veda Samhita 1.164.46, Wiki Source \\"Truth is one; only It is called by different names,\\"Gospel of Ramakrishna, page 423 The Ramakrishna/Vivekananda movement has these concepts to popular awareness in India and the West. An example is Aldous Huxley's book, The Perennial Philosophy, in which are gathered quotes from the religions of the world that express, for him, the universality of religion by showing the same fundamental Truths are found in each of the world's religions. Vedanta and nondualism According to Benavides, neo-Vedanta is closer to Ramanuja's qualified non-dualism than it is to Shankara Advaita Vedanta. Nicholas F. Gier notes that neo-Vedanta does not regard the world to be illusionary, in contrast to Shankara's Advaita. According to Michael Taft, Ramakrishna reconciled the dualism of formless and form. Ramakrishna regarded the Supreme Being to be both Personal and Impersonal, active and inactive. According to Anil Sooklal, Vivekananda's neo-Advaita \\"reconciles Dvaita or dualism and Advaita or non-dualism\\". Radhakrishnan acknowledged the reality and diversity of the world of experience, which he saw as grounded in and supported by the absolute or Brahman. Radhakrishnan also reinterpreted Shankara's notion of maya. According to Radhakrishnan, maya is not a strict absolute idealism, but \\"a subjective misperception of the world as ultimately real\\".Michael Hawley, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1888—1975), Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy Gandhi endorsed the Jain concept of Anekantavada, the notion that truth and reality are perceived differently from diverse points of view, and that no single point of view is the complete truth. This concept embraces the perspectives of both Vedānta which, according to Jainism, \\"recognizes substances but not process\\", and Buddhism, which \\"recognizes process but not substance\\". Jainism, on the other hand, pays equal attention to both substance (dravya) and process (paryaya). According to Sarma, who stands in the tradition of Nisargadatta Maharaj, Advaitavāda means \\"spiritual non-dualism or absolutism\\", in which opposites are manifestations of the Absolute, which itself is immanent and transcendent. Sruti versus \\"experience\\" A central concern in Neo-Vedanta is the role of sruti, sacred texts, versus (personal) experience. Classical Advaita Vedanta is centered on the correct understanding of sruti, the sacred texts. Correct understanding of the sruti is a pramana, a means of knowledge to attain liberation. It takes years of preparation and study to accomplish this task, and includes the mastery of Sanskrit, the memorisation of texts, and the meditation over the interpretation of those texts. Understanding is called anubhava, knowledge or understanding derived from (personal) experience.V.S.Apte, The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary Anubhava removes Avidya, ignorance, regarding Brahman and Atman, and leads to moksha, liberation. In neo-Vedanta, the status of sruti becomes secondary, and \\"personal experience\\" itself becomes the primary means to liberation. Smarta Tradition According to Ninian Smart, Neo-Vedanta is \\"largely a smarta account.\\" In modern times Smarta-views have been highly influential in both the Indianiskcon.org, Heart of Hinduism: The Smarta Tradition and western understanding of Hinduism. According to iskcon.org, Vaitheespara notes adherence of Smartha Brahmans to \\"the pan- Indian Sanskrit-Brahmanical tradition\\": The majority of members of Smarta community follow the Advaita Vedanta philosophy of Shankara. Smarta and Advaita have become almost synonymous, though not all Advaitins are Smartas. Shankara was a Smarta, just like Radhakrishnan. Smartas believe in the essential oneness of five (panchadeva) or six (Shanmata) deities as personifications of the Supreme. According to Smartism, supreme reality, Brahman, transcends all of the various forms of personal deity. God is both Saguna and Nirguna: Lola Williamson further notes that \\"what is called Vedic in the smarta tradition, and in much of Hinduism, is essentially Tantric in its range of deities and liturgical forms.\\" Influence Neo-Vedanta was popularised in the 20th century in both India and the west by Vivekananda, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, and western orientalists who regarded Vedanta to be the \\"central theology of Hinduism\\". =Vedanticization= Neo-Vedanta has become a broad current in Indian culture, extending far beyond the Dashanami Sampradaya, the Advaita Vedanta Sampradaya founded by Adi Shankara. The influence of Neo-Vedanta on Indian culture has been called \\"Vedanticization\\" by Richard King. An example of this \\"Vedanticization\\" is Ramana Maharshi, who is regarded as one of the greatest Hindu-saints of modern times,, of whom Sharma notes that \\"among all the major figures of modern Hinduism [he] is the one person who is widely regarded as a jivanmukti\\". Although Sharma admits that Ramana was not acquainted with Advaita Vedanta before his personal experience of liberation, and Ramana never received initiation into the Dashanami Sampradaya or any other sampradaya,John David, An Introduction to Sri Ramana's Life and Teachings. David Godman talks to John David. Page 6 Sharma nevertheless sees Ramana's answers to questions by devotees as being within an Advaita Vedanta framework. =Diversity and pluralism= In response to the British dominance and the British critique of Hinduism, various visions on Indian diversity and unity have been developed within the nationalistic and reform movements. The Brahmo Samaj strived towards monotheism, while no longer regarding the Vedas as sole religious authority. The Brahmo Samaj had a strong influence on the Neo-Vedanta of Vivekananda, Aurobindo, Radhakrishnan and Gandhi, who strived toward a modernized, humanistic Hinduism with an open eye for societal problems and needs. Other groups, like the Arya Samaj, strived toward a revival of Vedic authority. In this context, various responses toward India's diversity developed. Hindu inclusivism – Hindutva and Dharmic religions In modern times, the orthodox measure of the primacy of the Vedas has been joined with the 'grand narrative' of the Vedic origins of Hinduism. The exclusion of Jainism and Buddhism excludes a substantial part of India's cultural and religious history from the assertion of a strong and positive Hindu identity. Hindutva-ideology solves this problem by taking recourse to the notion of Hindutva, \\"Hinduness\\", which includes Jainism and Buddhism. A recent strategy, exemplified by Rajiv Malhotra, is the use of the term dharma as a common denominator, which also includes Jainism and Buddhism. According to Larson, Malhotra's notion of \\"the so-called \\"Dharma” traditions\\" and their \\"integral unity\\" is another example of \\"neo-Hindu discourse\\". Malhotra, in his Being Different, uses the term \\"Dharmic tradition\\" or \\"dharmic systems\\", \\"referring to all the Hindu, Buddhist, Jaina and Sikh traditions\\". He proposes that those traditions, despite their differences, share common features, the most important being \\"Dharma\\". They are also characterised by the notion of \\"Integral Unity\\", which means that \\"ultimately only the whole exists; the parts that make up the whole have but a relative existence. The whole is independent and indivisible\\",Hitchhiker's Guide to Rajiv Malhotra's Discussion Forum as opposed to \\"Synthetic Unity\\", which \\"starts with parts that exist separately from one another\\". Malhotra has received strong criticism of his ideas, for 'glossing over' the differences between and even within the various traditions of India. In response, Malhotra explains that some of his critics confused \\"integral unity\\" with \\"homogeneity\\", thinking that Malhotra said all those traditions are essentially the same, when he actually wrote that Dharmic traditions share a sense of an \\"integral unity\\" despite differences. Inclusivism and communalism According to Rinehart, neo-Vedanta is \\"a theological scheme for subsuming religious difference under the aegis of Vedantic truth\\". According to Rinehart, the consequence of this line of reasoning is Communalism, the idea that \\"all people belonging to one religion have common economic, social and political interests and these interests are contrary to the interests of those belonging to another religion.\\"Ram Puniyani, COMMUNALISM : Illustrated Primer, Chapter 5 Communalism has become a growing force in Indian politics, presenting several threats to India, hindring its nation-building and threatening \\"the secular, democratic character of the Indian state\\". Rinehart notes that Hindu religiosity plays an important role in the nationalist movement, and that \\"the neo-Hindu discource is the unintended consequence of the initial moves made by thinkers like Rammohan Roy and Vivekananda.\\" But Rinehart also points out that it is =Influence on western spirituality= Neo-Vedanta has been influenced by western ideas, but has also had a reverse influence on western spirituality. Due to the colonisation of Asia by the western world, since the late 18th century an exchange of ideas has been taking place between the western world and Asia, which also influenced western religiosity. In 1785 appeared the first western translation of a Sanskrit-text. It marked the growing interest in the Indian culture and languages. The first translation of Upanishads appeared in two parts in 1801 and 1802, which influenced Arthur Schopenhauer, who called them \\"the consolation of my life\\". Early translations also appeared in other European languages. A major force in the mutual influence of eastern and western ideas and religiosity was the Theosophical Society. It searched for ancient wisdom in the east, spreading eastern religious ideas in the west. One of its salient features was the belief in \\"Masters of Wisdom\\", \\"beings, human or once human, who have transcended the normal frontiers of knowledge, and who make their wisdom available to others\\". The Theosophical Society also spread western ideas in the east, aiding a modernisation of eastern traditions, and contributing to a growing nationalism in the Asian colonies. Another major influence was Vivekananda, who popularised his modernised interpretation of Advaita Vedanta in the 19th and early 20th century in both India and the west, emphasising anubhava (\\"personal experience\\") over scriptural authority. Appraisal and criticism=Appraisal= According to Larson, the \\"solution of synthesis\\" prevailed in the work of Rammohun Roy, Sayyid Ahmed Khan, Rabindranath Tagore, Swami Vivekananda, M.K. Gandhi, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Muhammad Iqbal, V.D. Savarkar, Jawaharlal Nehru, \\"and many others\\". Spear voices appraisal of this \\"solution of synthesis\\", while G.R. Sharma emphasises the humanism of neo-Vedanta. =Criticism= Vivekenanda's presentation of Advaita Vedanta has been criticised for its misinterpretation of this tradition: According to Anantanand Rambachan, Vivekananda emphasised anubhava (\\"personal experience\\") over scriptural authority, but in his interpretation of Shankara, deviated from Shankara, who saw knowledge and understanding of the scriptures as the primary means to moksha. According to Comans, the emphasis on samadhi also is not to be found in the Upanishads nor with Shankara. For Shankara, meditation and Nirvikalpa Samadhi are means to gain knowledge of the already existing unity of Brahman and Atman. In the 21st century, Neo-Vedanta has been criticized by Hindu traditionalists for the influence of \\"Radical Universalism\\", arguing that it leads to a \\"self- defeating philosophical relativism,\\" and has weakened the status and strength of Hinduism.Frank Morales (February 15, 2013). \\"Neo-Vedanta: The Problem with Hindu Universalism\\" (original link) at website \\"Bharata Bharati\\" (http://bharatabharati.wordpress.com/) (accessed 8 February 2014). Criticism of neo-Hinduism label=Criticism of Paul Hacker= In the 20th century the German Indologist Paul Hacker used the terms \\"Neo-Vedanta\\" and \\"Neo-Hinduism\\" polemically, to criticize modern Hindu thinkers. Halbfass regards the terms \\"Neo-Vedanta\\" and \\"Neo-Hinduism\\" as \\"useful and legitimate as convenient labels\\", but has criticized Hacker for use that was \\"simplistic\\". Furthermore, he asks, Halbfass wrote that the adoption of the terms Bagchee and Adluri argue that German Indology, including Hacker, was merely \\"a barely disguised form of religious evangelism\\". According to Malhotra, an Indian-American Hindu writer, it was Paul Hacker who popularized the term 'neo-Hinduism' in the 1950s, \\"to refer to the modernization of Hinduism brought about by many Indian thinkers, the most prominent being Swami Vivekananda.\\" In Malhotra's view, \\"Hacker charged that 'neo-Hindus', most notably Vivekananda, have disingenuously adopted Western ideas and expressed them using Sanskrit.\\" Malhotra also notes that Hacker was a biased Christian apologist: According to David Smith, Hacker's belief was that the ethical values of 'neo-Hinduism\\" came from Western philosophy and Christianity, just in Hindu terms. Hacker also believed that Hinduism began in the 1870s. He saw Bankin Chattopadhyaya, Aurobindo, Gandhi, and Radhakishnan as its most famous proponents. =Neglect of inherent development of religions= Brian K. Smith notes that \\"The Neo- Hindu indigenous authorities are often dismissed as 'inauthentic,' their claims to legitimacy compromised by their encounters with modernity\\", which influenced their worldview and religious positions, but points out that According to Madaio, the notion that Vivekananda and other Hindu modernists deviate from orthodox, classical Advaita Vedanta, neglects the fact that considerable developments took place in Indian religious thinking, including Advaita Vedanta. =The \\"myth of Neo-Hinduism\\"= Rajiv Malhotra, in his book Indra's Net, has stated that there is a \\"myth of Neo-Hinduism\\". According to him, there are \\"eight myths\\" of Neo-Hinduism such as \\"colonial Indology's biases were turned into Hinduism\\" (Myth 2) and \\"Hinduism was manufactured and did not grow organically\\" (Myth 3). Malhotra denies that \\"Vivekananda manufactured Hinduism\\", or that \`neo-Vedanta' suppressed \\"the traditions of the Indian masses.\\" According to Malhotra, there is \\"an integrated, unified spiritual substratum in ancient India,\\" and argues that According to Malhotra, the 'myth of neo-Hinduism' \\"is used to fragment Hindu society by pitting its spiritual giants against one another and distorting their subtle and deeply intricate viewpoints.\\" Also according to him, \\"the definition of neo-Hinduism has been contrived and [...] gained authenticity, in part because it suits certain academic and political agendas, and in part because it has been reiterated extensively without adequate critical response.\\" See also * Vijnanabhiksu * Bengali Renaissance * Hindu reform movements * Hindu politics * Hindu nationalism * Indigenous Aryans (Out of India theory) * Sanskritization * Indo-Aryanization * Hinduism in the West * Buddhist modernism * Zen Narratives NotesReferencesSources=Printed sources=                                         =Web-sources=Further reading  , (266 pages), paperback   ;Scholarly  ;Apologetic * External links * International Forum for NeoVedantins History * Bithika Mukerji , Neo-Vedanta and Modernity * Kelamuni, The Neo-Vedanta of Swami Vivekananda: Part One * Kelamuni, The Neo-Vedanta of Swami Vivekananda: Part Two * Swami Bhajanananda (2010), Four Basic Principles of Advaita Vedanta Criticism * Frank Morales, Neo-Vedanta: The problem with Hindu Universalism * DharmaCentral.com, A Devastating Critique of Neo-Hinduism Category:Hindu philosophical concepts Category:History of Hinduism Category:Advaita Category:Nondualism ","title":"Neo-Vedanta"},{"id":"38214884","text":"Réka Pecz (born June 21, 1992) is a Hungarian swimmer, who specialized in breaststroke events.

Military positions  Sibai graduated at the Egyptian Military Academy in 1937. Since then, he assumed many positions, including teaching at the Egyptian Military Academy. In 1940, he taught at the Cavalry Corps in the Academy, and later became a professor of military history in 1943, then he was elected manager of the Military Museum in 1949. He finally reached the rank of brigadier general.  Literary and journalistic positions  Sibai was an Egyptian writer. He became the Minister of Culture in 1973, and the chairman of the Al-Ahram Establishment and the head of Egyptian Journalists Syndicate. He wrote 22 short stories and dozens of novels, the latest being Life Is A Moment in 1973. He was awarded the State Award in the Arts in 1973 and a large number of medals. Sibai was regarded as a unique writer and a sophisticated and intelligent politician. Sibai was the chief editor of some Egyptian magazines, including Al-Resala Al-Gadida, Akher Sa'a and Al-Musawar in addition to Al-Ahram newspaper. He was appointed a minister of culture by Anwar Sadat, the Egyptian president back then, and remained in that position till he was assassinated in Cyprus on February 18, 1978 because of his support for President Sadat's initiative to make peace with Israel after the president historical visit to Jerusalem in 1977.  Literary and monetary value of his work  Sibai's works were best-sellers. His novels were adapted in many films, which were described by critics as more important than the novels themselves. However, the importance of his work began to decline especially when Naguib Mahfouz's work started to draw most of the critics attention. Although many critics avoid referring to his work as the end of the Romantic Era in Egyptian literature, as it touches upon the needs of a specific age group of young readers, an Egyptian writer described Sibai's work as realistic and symbolic. In the introduction to his book \\"Yusuf Sibai: The Knight of Romanticism», Mursi Saad Eddin mentions that Sibai was not just a romantic writer but one who expresses a political and social vision in his depiction of the events in Egypt. In addition, Lotus Abdel Karim says that his role in the Egyptian culture is of no less importance than his role as a writer, and refers to the description of the late Egyptian critic Dr. Mohamed Mandour that Sibai \\"is not a writer who isolates himself in an ivory tower, but a man who goes to markets and walks through alleys and streets\\". Yusuf Sibai is held as a phenomenon in the Egyptian cultural life. However, critics avoid dealing with his work save literature historians. Nowadays, the mention of his name is only limited to the film adaptations of his work, including \\"I'm going away\\", \\"Give Back My Heart\\", \\"In the ruins\\", \\"We Do Not Sow Thorns\\", \\"The Land of Hypocrisy\\" and \\"Al Saghamat\\". The Egyptian Television also produced a TV series about his life entitled Fares Ar-Romancia \\"The Romantic Knight\\".  Assassination  Sibai was assassinated in Cyprus on February 18, 1978 while he was attending an Asian-African conference there. This murderous event had a negative effect on the Egyptian – Cypriot relations, and forced Egypt to cut ties with Cyprus, particularly after an Egyptian special military unit landed at Larnaca International Airport to arrest the assassins without informing the Cypriot authorities. After the assassination, the two murderers took about thirty hostages of the members of the delegations participating in the Solidarity Conference and imprisoned them in the hotel cafeteria. They threatened that they would kill the hostages by grenades unless the Cypriot authorities promised to fly them out of the country. The Cypriot authorities finally yielded to their request and it was resolved to take them on board of a DC8 Cypriot plane to escape outside Cyprus. The plane took off from Larnaca International Airport. The battle between the special Egyptian force and the Cypriot army had led to the deaths of several members of the Egyptian force while many were injured on both sides. The crime was later blamed on Abu Nidal Organization (ANO), a militant Palestinian splinter group.يوسف السباعي.. رحلة إبداع بدأت من « شبرا ».. وانتهت في « قبرص » \\" المصري اليوم \\"  Aftermath  His works  * The Deputy of Azrael – a novel (1947). * O Ye Nation Who Laughed – A book consisting of symbolic short stories (1948). * The Land of Hypocrisy – a novel (1949). * I'm going away – a novel (1950). * Umm Ratiba – a play (1951). * Al Saghamat – a novel (1952). * Between Abu El-Rish And Namish Park – stories (1950). * Sheikh Zo'rob And Others – stories (1952). * Dying For You, Night! – a novel (1953). * Searching for a Body – (1953). * In The Ruins – a novel. * Give Back My Heart – a novel (1954). * The Way Back – a novel (1956). * Nadia – a novel (1960). * Dried Tears – a novel (1962). * A Night with an End – a novel (1963). * Stronger Than Time – a play (1965). * We Do Not Sow Thrones – a novel (1969). * You're Not Alone – a novel (1970). * Smile on His Lips – a novel (1971). * Life Is A Moment – a novel (1973). * Spectra (1947). * Twelve Women (1948). * Deep Hidden Secrets (1948). * Twelve Men (1949). * In The Parade of Passion (1949). * From The Unknown World (1949). * These Souls (1950). * Lovers' Weeping Place – 1950  See also  * List of Arabic- language writers  References  External links  * Translations of the members of Arab Writers' Union in Syria and the Arab world Category:1917 births Category:1978 deaths Category:Egyptian journalists Category:People from Cairo Category:Egyptian novelists Category:Egyptian screenwriters Category:Egyptian terrorism victims Category:20th-century screenwriters Category:20th-century journalists ","title":"Yusuf Sibai"},{"id":"38214945","text":"Piter () is a novel written by Russian author Shimun Vrochek.http://metro2033.pl/piter/autor/ Piter is part of Universe of Metro 2033, a long-running series of post-apocalyptic short stories, novellas, and novels, spanning a variety of genres.Вселенная Метро 2033 - Книги The works are written by several different authors.Питер Piter was originally published in February 2010.\\"Питер\\" — Метропедия Although there is currently no English version of the book, Piter has been translated into a number of other European languages, such as German,Piter: METRO 2033-Universum-Roman PolishUniwersum Metro 2033.

It is one of the longer novels in the Universe series. Piter is featured as an Easter egg in the video game adaptation of Metro 2033, where a 3D model of the book can be found laying on the rail cart near the end of the level Armory, during chapter 3 of the game's story. Synopsis Just like the people of Moscow in the fictional world of Metro 2033, a fraction of St. Petersburg's citizens fled to the tunnels of their hometown's metro moments before the nuclear bombs were dropped on the city. Piter (Russian slang for St. Petersburg) tells the story of Ivan Merkulov, a twenty-six-year-old fighter and stalker who experiences many trials and adventures as he travels through places both within the subway system of Saint Petersburg, as well as those above on the surface of post- apocalyptic Earth. The novel begins with the protagonist about to get married. The ceremony is interrupted when the engine-generator that powers the necessities of life on Vasileostrovskaya (Ivan's home station) is stolen. Sozonov - friend and member of Merkulov's team of stalkers - believes that the residents of several nearby stations, who originate from Moscow, are responsible for the crime. A war begins between those stations and an alliance that Vasileostrovskaya is part of.http://metro2033.pl/piter/ksiazka/ As is revealed later on in the story, things are much more complex than Ivan thought. He is dragged into something much larger than the local conflict between the two factions, and the lines between friend and foe become very blurry as he continues his task. Merkulov's mission takes him to various locations, through numerous dangers and oddities, as he travels through the metro and beyond.  Reception  In Russia, Piter was received with mostly positive feedback from critics and fans of the book series alike.Вселенная Метро 2033 - Ревью на \\"Питер\\" Шимуна Врочека Although some believed that it was written in a very similar style to that of the original author of Metro 2033,Питер (Вселенная Метро-2033), Шимун Врочек - «Достойное продолжение культовой книги »  Отзывы покупателей others thought the exact opposite and claimed that the novel was \\"teenage drivel\\" (even though Shimun Vrochek is older than Dmitry Glukhovsky).

Unlike ordinary playground swings, a Russian swing has steel bars instead of ropes, and its swinging platform is able to rotate 360 degrees around the horizontal bar from which it is suspended. Two or more acrobats stand on the swing platform, pumping it back and forth until it is swinging in high arcs. This motion increases the centrifugal force of the flyer (the acrobat who is going to jump). The flyer then lets go of the swing at the peak of its arc, gaining enough altitude to execute one of various aerial flips before landing at a distance from the swing. The flyer may land on a crash mat, in a vertically slanted net, in the arms of other acrobats (referred to as catchers), in a pool of water, or even on the platform of another Russian swing.

Plot summary Ack-Ack Macaque is based on Powell's earlier short story of the same name, which won the Interzone reader's poll in 2007. The original short story is included as an appendix to the novel. The novel has aspects of alternate history as in this version of reality the United Kingdom and France merged in the 1950s to form the nation of Brittany. The macaque of the title is the star of a highly regarded, exclusive massively multiplayer online role- playing game (with the roguelike feature of character death being final) which is itself set in an alternate reality World War II. The main character in the novel is former journalist Victoria Valois, who attempts to track down the man who murdered her husband and stole her neural implant while the heir to the throne of Brittany becomes a fugitive after breaking into a Parisian research laboratory. As the novel progresses, these strands are drawn together and the true purpose of the macaque is revealed. A sequel, Hive Monkey, was released in 2014. Critical reception The novel gained Powell a third review from Eric Brown in The Guardian. Brown described the novel as \\"inventive\\" with \\"brilliant cliffhangers\\" and a \\"satisfying conclusion\\". Philip Reeve said that the novel \\"could all be quite exhausting, but it's done with such obvious enthusiasm that it's impossible not to be carried along by it.\\" The novel was a joint winner of the 2013 BSFA Award for Best Novel with Ann Leckie's Ancillary Justice.

Ganda Koy fighters were recruited among Songhai, Bambara, Fulani, Bozo and Tuareg- Bella tribesmen. Ganda Koy immediately rejected the “National Pact” for peace signed in April 1992.The movement then embraced a racist anti-Tuareg ideology, in response to what it perceived as Tuareg oppression. Ganda Koy later transformed into Ganda Iso, which is seen as its direct successor.  Touareg Conflict  In 1994, Ganda Koy actions amounted to 60-300 deaths. In 2008, a Ganda Iso military leader, Sergeant Amadou Diallo, conducted a \\"broad daylight massacre\\" where four Tuareg civilians were killed. This resulted in a split between Diallo and the civilian leadership of the movement. Amadou Diallo was reportedly killed in Ansongo, in a battle against MNLA rebels on 25 March 2012.

He is also known as Pieter Cornelis Dommershuijzen and signed his work as P.C. Dommersen, or P.C.Dommershuisen and also P.C. Dommershuizen. Family Dommerson was born 6 December 1833 in the city of Utrecht, Netherlands as Pieter Cornelis Dommershuisen, illegitimate son of Cornelia Dommershuisen. Pre 1700 the family came from Dahlheim, near Koblenz, in Germany, so their family name was originally 'Dommershausen'. He was the elder brother of the painter Cornelis Christiaan Dommersen. Pieter Cornelis moved from the Netherlands to England in around 1855. He married Trinity Church, Marylebone, Middlesex on 29 January 1859 Anna Petronella Synja (Sijnja), born Amsterdam c. 1838, da. of Dr. (Medicine) Louis Synja and N.N. They had at least two sons and one daughter. His son William Raymond Dommersen (Dommerson) (1859-1927) also became a fine art artist in England, all three Dommersens painting the same genre of paintings.

He travelled and painted in America, Belgium, The Netherlands, Britain and France just like his countryman Abraham Hulk Senior did and also settled in the end in the United Kingdom. He often travelled together with his brother Cornelis Christiaan Dommersen and his son William Raymond Dommersen. His art was loved because in his paintings the people, the sky, the buildings, the clouds and the backgrounds joined harmoniously together in which the seagulls floated through. He died in Hexham in the last quarter of 1918 as Peter C. Dommershuizen and was buried as Peter Cornelius Dommerverschingen on 18 November 1918 in Haydon Bridge which is recorded by Tim Williams on the Hexham Local History Society forum.

Biography He was born to Lisabetta Genga and Lattanzio Oddi. His initial training was in eloquence and philosophy, but he later trained under the painter Federico Barocci. he moved to Pesaro to work under Guidobaldo del Monte, one of the main disciples of Federico Commandino. He was hired to work in Spain and France as a military engineer, which required him also to help train in the use of artillery. He returned to the Duchy of Urbino to work as an engineer under the Duke Francesco Maria II della Rovere. In 1601, he was accused, perhaps unfairly, of being involved in a plot that also involved the Marchese Ippolito della Rovere; the plot aimed to depose the Duke Francesco Maria. In 1609, Muzio Oddi was released from prison, and exiled to Milan. In Milan, he won a competition to become professor of Mathematics. He published his works, prepared in prison, including (1614, dedicated to Count and Cardinal Teodoro Trivulzio, probably one of his patrons), and a treatise entitled Dello squadro (1625) regarding surveyor's quadrants. In 1625, Oddi replaced his brother, Matteo, as chief fortifications engineer to the Republic of Lucca. In 1626, he helped design new city walls and was rewarded with a commemorative medal. In 1631, he became architect for the Sanctuary of the Holy House of Loreto, and in 1633 publishes his book on the proportional or military compass, In 1636, he moves to Lucca to work as a military engineer. Late in life, he returned to Urbino as a professor of mathematics. In 1638, he publishes a second book on sundials, , also composed while in prison. He was reappointed Gonfaloniere in Urbino.

In a racing career which lasted from spring 1972 until July 1973 he ran nine times and won seven races. As a two-year-old he won three of his four races and was rated one of the best Irish juveniles of the season. In the following year he finished fourth on soft ground in the 2000 Guineas but in the summer he showed the form which led to him being rated the best European horse of his generation, winning the St. James's Palace Stakes, the July Cup and the Sussex Stakes. He was then retired to stud where he had some success as a sire of winners. Background Thatch was a strongly-built bay horse, standing 16 hands high, with a white star and one white foot, bred by Claiborne Farm in Kentucky. His sire Forli was a champion in his native Argentina before becoming a successful breeding stallion in the United States. His best-known offspring was Thatch's contemporary Forego, the three-time American Horse of the Year. Thatch's dam Thong was a full sister to the 1965 American Horse of the Year Moccasin. After winning five races she was retired to stud where she became a highly influential broodmare. Her descendants included Fairy King, Nureyev and most importantly Sadler's Wells. Thatch was bought privately by Jack Mulcahy and was sent to race in Europe. He proved to be the first top-class horse owned by the County Waterford born Mulcahy, whose racing colours of green, white and orange were derived from the Irish tricolour. Thatch was trained by Vincent O'Brien at his Ballydoyle stable in County Tipperary, Ireland. Racing career=1972: two-year-old season= Thatch began his career with three easy wins at the Curragh, starting with the Corrib Maiden Stakes over six furlongs in June. In the following month he was moved up in class and won the Group Three Tyros Stakes over the same course and distance followed by a success over seven furlongs in the Probationers Stakes. In August he was sent to France to contest the Group One Prix Morny but finished fourth behind Filiberto. He reportedly did not cope well with the journey from Ireland and was not suited by the soft ground. Although he did not race again in 1972 he was officially rated the best horse in Ireland by a margin of six pounds. =1973: three-year-old season= On his three-year-old debut Thatch won the Group Three Vauxhall Trial Stakes over seven furlongs at Phoenix Park Racecourse. On 5 May the colt was sent to England for the first to contest the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket Racecourse. Ridden by Lester Piggott, he was strongly fancied for the classic, with his main opposition expected to come from the French-trained colt Targowice. Racing on soft ground, he finished fourth of the eighteen runners behind the 50/1 outsider Mon Fils, with O'Brien blaming his colt's defeat on the rain-softened ground. By the summer, the dry weather led to firm, fast ground in England and Thatch returned in June for the St James's Palace Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot. He won by fifteen lengths from his only opponent, Owen Dudley, a colt who had previously won the Dante Stakes at York and the Diomed Stakes at Epsom. In the following month he was moved down in distance to contest the July Cup against specialist sprinters over six furlongs at Newmarket's July course. Ridden as usual by Piggott he started 4/5 favourite and won by three lengths from the Royal Ascot winners Pitskelly (Jersey Stakes) and Balliol (Cork and Orrery Stakes). At the end of the month Thatch returned to the mile for the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse, which at that time was restricted to three and four-year-olds. He won by three lengths from Jacinth, a filly who had been rated the best British two-year-old of either sex in 1972. Later in the season, Thatch was withdrawn from engagements in both the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes and the Prix du Moulin, as his connections did not wish to run the colt on soft ground. At the end of the season he was syndicated at a valuation of £1m and retired to stud. Assessment As noted above, Thatch was the highest rated two-year-old of 1972 in Ireland. At the end of the following season the independent Timeform organisation awarded the colt a rating of 136 making him the highest rated three-year-old in Europe. By comparison, that year's Epsom Derby winner Morston was given a rating of 125. The only horse to surpass Thatch's rating for 1973 were his two-year-old stable companion Apalachee (also owned by Mulcahy) and the four-year-old Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Rheingold, both of whom were assessed at 137. In their book A Century of Champions, based on a modified version of the Timeform system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Thatch the best British or Irish-trained horse of his generation and the twelfth-best Irish racehorse of the 20th century. He was also placed twentieth in their list of the century's best sprinters. Stud career Thatch had some success as a breeding stallion, siring good winners over a variety of distances including Thatching, Achieved, Final Straw (four Group race wins including the Champagne Stakes), Tommy Way (Derby Italiano, Gran Premio di Milano) and Shulich (Gran Premio di Milano). He was also the damsire of the 1986 Epsom Derby winner Shahrastani.

Founded in 1879, the club held minor status until it was classified as an unofficial first-class team by substantial sources in 1894, before joining the County Championship in 1895 and being granted official first-class status. Leicestershire has been classified as a List A team since the beginning of limited overs cricket in 1963; and as a first-class Twenty20 team since the inauguration of the Twenty20 Cup in 2003. The details are the player's usual name followed by the years in which he was active as a Leicestershire player and then his name is given as it usually appears on match scorecards. Note that many players represented other top-class teams besides Leicestershire and that some played for the club in minor counties cricket before 1894. Current players are shown as active to the latest season in which they played for the club. The list excludes Second XI and other players who did not play for the club's first team; and players whose first team appearances were in minor matches only. A * Varun Aaron (2018) : V. R.

Played by Laura Robinson, the eponymous Clare is a private investigator and part-owner of a Chinatown jazz club, who uses intelligence rather than physical strength to solve cases. The supporting cast includes Robert Beltran, Tony Plana, Christina Pickles, Robert Ruth, Robert Sutton, and Wayne Chou. Gil Mellé composed the show's soundtrack. The show was developed as one of three television programs ordered by Lifetime in 1991. It was one of the network's first scripted programs following its successful acquisition of The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd from NBC. After nine episodes had aired, the network placed the show on hiatus before it was eventually canceled. It has never been released on DVD or Blu-ray, or made available on online-streaming services. The episodes were rebroadcast as four television movies in 1991 and 1992. Critical response to Veronica Clare was mixed, with commentators divided over its style. The series attracted feminist analysis, with a focus on Clare's identity as a female private investigator. Critics have compared Robinson to other actresses including Kathleen Turner and Lauren Bacall, and Clare to other fictional female detectives like V.I. Warshawski. Premise and characters Described as a \\"moody noir detective drama\\" by the Sun-Sentinel, Veronica Clare revolves around the titular character (Laura Robinson) and her work as a private investigator and a partial owner of a Chinatown jazz club. Mass communication professor Eileen R. Meehan and media studies professor Jackie Byars identified the show as an example of a soft-boiled detective series.Meehan & Byars (2004): p. 95 Told from Clare's perspective,Green (1998): pp. 164-165Green (1998): p. 164 the mysteries showcase how she uses her intelligence to solve cases. Characterized as \\"not physically tough, but merely determined\\",Green (1998): p. 240 Clare avoids using guns, and engaging in hand-to-hand combat, instead relying on her intellect to solve cases. She has no interest in being paid for her investigations, and instead only takes on cases that interest her.Brooks & Marsh (2009): p. 794 Clare serves as the narrator for each episode. Her business partner Duke Rado (Robert Beltran), and Los Angeles Police Department officer Nikki Swarcek (Tony Plana) assist Clare. Rado, the show's male lead, is not presented as Clare's love interest or as a \\"source of wisdom and authorization for her\\". Swarcek, an expatriate from Poland, carries an unrequited love for Clare. In several episodes, Clare is shown writing letters to an unidentified lover whose gender is never revealed. Had the show had continued, the audience would have learned more about Clare's past. While absent from the pilot episode, Clare's friend Kelsey Horne (Christina Pickles) features in its later storylines. She works for a rare bookstore. Other cast members include Sergeant Swede (Robert Ruth), Rocko the bartender (Robert Sutton), and Jimmy (Wayne Chou).Terrace (2008): pp. 1139-1140  Production  Following the successful acquisition of The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd from NBC, Lifetime went through an \\"emergent period\\" in which it began to develop original television dramas. Veronica Clare was created by Jeffrey Bloom, and produced by Hearst Entertainment, Inc. It was one of three scripted programs ordered by Lifetime in 1991; the other two were The Hidden Room and Confessions of Crime. Each of the shows feature elements of mystery or suspense.Newman & Witsell (2016): p. 10 Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Howard Rosenberg described the programs' development as Lifetime's \\"most ambitious effort to date\\". After picking up Veronica Clare for 13 episodes, Lifetime marketed the show toward women. This followed the network's tradition of acquiring shows depicting female characters in traditionally male occupations; other examples include a female police officer in Lady Blue, a female physician in Kay O'Brien, and a female private detective in Partners in Crime.Dines & Humez (2003): p. 620 Even though the series is set in a contemporary period in Los Angeles, a writer for The Item felt that it had a \\"period feel\\" reminiscent of the 1940s and the 1980s. Shay Austin contributed to the series as its production designer. Each episode features camera techniques similar to those used in film noir, and has a score composed by American jazz musician Gil Mellé.

Reruns aired on Saturdays at 11:00 pm EST. Despite delivering \\"pretty respectable\\" ratings, the show was placed on hiatus on September 24, 1991, after nine episodes had aired.Mizejewski (2004): p. 208 Veronica Clare, along with The Hidden Room and Confessions of a Crime, had lower ratings than original films produced by the network.Lotz (2010): p. 188 Network spokesperson Alex Wagner attributed the decision to pull the series from air to issues with its production; he explained: \\"We\`re shutting down to address creative concerns, with the idea of rewriting.\\" A writer from the Sun- Sentinel found this surprising given that television shows aimed at a niche market were often not required to deliver immediate high ratings in comparison to network television. Lifetime canceled the series during its hiatus. Media studies scholar Eithne Johnson claimed that the network reached this decision due to its \\"ambivalence about its 'feminine identity' during prime time\\". The series has never been made available on DVD or Blu-ray, nor released on an online-streaming service. In 1991 and 1992, the nine episodes were converted into four television movies and aired on television. The titles of the films were Affairs with Death, Deadly Minds, Naked Hearts, and Slow Violence; they can be requested through the Library of Congress as video reels. Reception=Critical reception= Veronica Clare has received mixed critical feedback. David Zurawik of The Baltimore Sun praised it as the network's only successful scripted program. Reviewing the first episode, he described the series as having a \\"contemporary sensibility with plenty of retro-classic-P.I. atmosphere\\". The Washington Post's Patricia Brennan called the show a stylish one-hour mystery series. Ginny Holbert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised the show's style and its actors' performances. Other critics were more negative. Giving the series a C-, David Hiltbrand of People was critical of the storylines' believability, describing the show's style as \\"murky and contrived\\". He also criticized Robinson's performance for its \\"vacuity\\". Howard Rosenberg initially praised the pilot as an indication of a \\"stylishly mounted, Chandleresque-style series\\", but panned subsequent episodes. He felt that the storylines bordered on a parody in the style of the 1991 film The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear, and did not match the \\"subtlety and a charming playfulness\\" of the series' premiere. The Orlando Sentinel's Nancy Pete criticized Veronica Clare as \\"well-intentioned but ludicrous\\", and a reviewer from Variety responded negatively to the pilot's script, writing that \\"atmosphere goes only so far\\". =Critical analysis= alt=A black-and-white image of a woman with long hair staring towards the camera. Following its premiere, Veronica Clare was described as an example of the rise of lead female characters in mysteries and crime dramas in film and television. Zurawik felt the show's success and impact \\"could be a culturally important one\\", identifying its focus on a female private investigator as fitting with the \\"boom of women writing and starring in mystery fiction\\". Expressing a similar sentiment, Hiltbrand found the series to be a continuation of \\"the season for female private eyes\\". Rosenberg felt that \\"beyond male biases among network programmers\\", there was no reason for female detectives to be treated as a \\"TV curiosity\\". Clare has been compared to other fictional female detectives, and Robinson to noted actresses. Hiltbrand likened Clare to Kathleen Turner's leading role in the 1991 film V.I. Warshawski, and felt that Robinson was attempting a \\"mysterious Samantha Spade style\\". A writer for The Item called the character a \\"cross between the Lauren Bacall of the '40s and the Kathleen Turner of the '80's\\", noting intelligence and sexuality as her primary characteristics. Television historians Tim Brooks and Earle F. Marsh pointed to Clare's \\"long flowing hair and reserved demeanor\\" as her notable character traits, which recalled Bacall and the Andrews Sisters. In a negative review of the character, Rosenberg wrote that Clare was \\"a poached egg compared to the hard-boiled gumshoe of Sara Paretsky's detective stories\\" featuring V. I. Warshawski. Critics have analyzed Clare's identity as a female detective. Political theorist Philip Green argued the show portrayed Clare as beautiful to accentuate her \\"masculine toughness\\" and avoid presenting her as a \\"fetishized male in disguise\\".Green (1998): p. 241 Green wrote that Clare's appearance was kept separate from \\"pure feminized sexuality\\" and her skills differed from \\"hypermasculine aggression\\". He interpreted Clare's role as the narrator as allowing her to never become the object of voyeurism or the male gaze. Gender and women's studies scholar Susan White noted that Veronica Clare's fashion and scenic design played a major role in its identity as a female-driven detective show. White argued that the \\"postmodern surplus of feminine details works in tension with the codes of the hardboiled narrative and style\\".Mizejewski (2004): p. 199  References =CitationsBook sources=     External links  Category:1991 American television series debuts Category:1991 American television series endings Category:1990s American crime drama television series Category:English- language television shows Category:Lifetime (TV network) original programming Category:Television shows set in Los Angeles ","title":"Veronica Clare"},{"id":"38215894","text":"Robinson is a census-designated placehttps://www.census.gov/2010census/ located in West Wheatfield Township, Indiana County in the state of Pennsylvania.

Brill.During his term, he reopened the house of knowledge, made efforts to restore shi'ite orthodoxy, and tried to reconcile the differences between the Fatimids and the Nizaris. His term ended with his execution, which was ordered by the caliph. Biography al-Aqmar mosque His name was Qaʾid Abū Muḥammad ʿAlī bin Fatik but is better known by the name 'al-Ma'mun'. Little is known of his life before he succeeded al-Afdal Shahanshan, murdered by Assassins, as the Fatimid vizier in 1121 ACE. On coming to power, he reopened the Dar al-Hikmah (House of Wisdom) in Cairo, closed in 1119 by his predecessor. He also raised the salaries of state officials. It was during his term that the Al-Aqmar mosque was built. Construction was completed by 1125 ACE. He also built three pavilions(المناظر) in the eastern Grand Palace in Cairo. He made a proclamation that every inhabitant of Cairo or Fustat who owned a house in ruins should repair it to live in, sell or rent. In case of non-compliance with the order, the house would be confiscated. =Restoration of Shi'ite orthodoxy= He restored the celebrations of Mawlid of Prophet Muhammad, Ali, Fatima and of the current Imam, al-Amir. He ordered the financing of mawlids and wuqūdāt(four nights of lights and celebrations) as customary, consisting of money and a gift of sweets such as honey or nuts, and fragrances such as rose water, musk or camphor. This recovery marked a return to the Shi'ite orthodoxy, weakened during the previous reigns. =Measures against the Nizari= Acting against the possible influence of the Nizari Isma'ilis in Egypt, in 1122 he organised a large public meeting to establish the legitimacy of the descendants of al-Musta'li and reject the successors of Nizar ibn al-Mustansir. Many senior Fatimid officials attended, including Abu Muhammad bin Adam, the head of the Dar al-Hikmah. On this occasion, the sister of Nizar, hidden behind a curtain, swore that when al-Mustansir was on his deathbed, he designated al-Mustaʿli as his successor. At the end of the meeting, al-Ma'mun ordered Ibn al-Sayrafi (Abu-l-Qasim Ali Ibn al-Sayrafi, d. 1147), the secretary of the Fatimid Chancery, to write a letter (sijill), known under the title of 'al-Hidayat al-Amiriyya li-Mawlana al-Amir fi ithbat Imamat Mawlana al-Mustaʿli waʿr-radd alaʿn Nizariyya' or 'ar Risalatuʿl- Amiriyya' in favor of al-Mustaʿli, which was to be read from the minbar of all the mosques in Egypt. He also circulated copies of this letter in Syria, causing an outcry among the Nizaris of Damascus. =Death= The uncertain financial situation of the empire and its reflections on the complex political and religious context of the country and, most of all, the provoked hostility of the Imam finally led to his arrest and execution in 1125.

He joined the Birmingham City Police in 1890. He achieved very rapid promotion within this force and in 1901 became Chief Constable of Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire. In 1903 he successfully applied for the Chief Constable's office at Halifax, West Riding of Yorkshire, where he remained until his retirement in 1944. During his time there he achieved many early improvements in policing at Halifax, some of which were later used nationwide. The most notable were the installing of coloured lights as traffic signals at road junctions, the formalisation of procedures for police identity parades, making 'keep left' mandatory for traffic and the installation of police telephones in the town, among others. In later years he was recognized as being a policeman who was ahead of his time. He came from a police family: his father, Frank Richardson (1851–1938), was the Chief Constable of Hereford from 1882 until 1920, and his elder brother, Ernest Frank Richardson (1871–1952), served as Chief Constable of Salisbury between 1903 and 1929.1) Police Gazette November 1903. 2) Police Gazette September 1929. 3) Cheltenham Chronicle 17 October 1903. Thus three members of the Richardson family served as chief constables between 1902 and 1920. He also had three other brothers who served in other police forces.  Early life  Alfred Herbert Richardson was the second son of Frank and Mary Richardson. He was born in a police house in Digbeth, Birmingham, where his father was serving in the City Police Force. He, along with his elder brother Ernest Frank, remained there until 1882. His father was then appointed Chief Constable of Hereford. This was a post he retained for 38 years until his retirement.

Constables would work twelve hours a day, seven days a week. There would be two shifts, one day and one night.\\" There were no meal breaks. A beat system was such that a Constable was taken to the start of his beat on foot by a superior. Constables worked on 'shifts', which meant they spent about six or seven hours during the day or night at their work. Some weeks they did 'nights', others they did 'evenings', others did 'days'. At this period they worked seven days a week with no rest days, which was to become a factor in Richardson's next appointment. As he had in Birmingham previously, the new Chief Constable now appeared by name regularly in the local newspaper in court cases.1) Newspaper Sentinel and Newcastle Borough News, 2) Staffordshire Police, by Sergeant Bennett, published 7 January 1993.

There was a Fire Brigade Captain and Lieutenant, 12 men and two runners in Richardson's time. In 1901 it had a first class steam engine, one manual engine and a new fire escape. It was separated from the police force in the early 1880s.Fire Brigade. Before this time a Police Superintendent ran the Brigade. Book, A History of the County of Stafford.

There was a surge of threats to officials at this time, including the British Royal Family, and he had to move in closer to the town centre and live nearer the Police station at Harrison Road. The Halifax Borough Council had several houses available and he moved to Balmoral Place, Halifax. Balmoral Place was about two hundred metres from the Police Station in Harrison Road. The police office was quite large. At ground floor level there was the main reception behind double entrance doors. Further in were various rooms used for storage. At this level were the cells for the prisoners just arrested and for those prisoners attending the magistrates' court in the building. There was no basement in the building and this was why the court was on the first floor. Access from the cells to the court was up a short flight of stairs which had a double doored cage around them and a door at the stairs' base. This was for security and allowed the magistrates or judge to 'send the prisoner down'. There were twelve cells in total and these were for short duration use only. The prisoners travelled to and from Leeds prison. There was a large courtyard between the court building and the police station which was used for police parades. The parade ground was also used for exercising the horses and housed four stables. From reception, going up the steps to the first floor the first item encountered was the police enquiry desk. Behind the desk were three corridors. One corridor to the left housed the typists' room, a small room for the senior typist and a store room. There was also a sergeants anteroom and the sergeants main room. There was another corridor to the right which housed the chief typist, an inspector, a chief inspector and a superintendent. At the far end was the chief constable's office which had a constable seated at its entrance day and night. The Criminal Investigation Department was in another corridor. There was one more set of stairs at the rear of the police station.Office layout details from Mr DJ Wild, an ex-policeman at Harrison Road Station, given to author, June 2012. This seat was a 'beat post' and was the most unpopular beat in the station because of its boredom. Letters from local residents in the Press i.e. \\"The Halifax Courier\\", wrote that a measure of much needed discipline continue in the Halifax Force. Richardson was considered to be the man to bring this about and he had acquired the reputation of being a strict disciplinarian which continued throughout his career. He presented his first financial accounts to the Halifax Watch Committee on 28 September 1903Halifax Public Library, Local Studies Dept. Halifax Watch Committee report, 3rd Qtr.1903. where the cost of the Constabulary per week averaged £164.1s.7d. The Police were paid weekly at this time. Within weeks Richardson persuaded the Watch Committee to purchase a Black Maria, a horse and a secure trailer fitted with lockable cubicles for transporting prisoners to and from the court in Halifax to Leeds prison. He insisted the design was adjusted so that it could rapidly become an ambulance should the need arise. In 1905 he attended a meeting in Bradford of the Chief Constables Association. An official photograph by the CCA shows him, his father and his brother among 40 attendees.Only known surviving copy in Private Family Archives. A similar meeting of Chief Constables in the Association took place in Brighton, Sussex, in 1906, which he attended. In August 1905 after a recommendation from the Chief Constables report of the time, the Halifax force was increased by six additional constables.Halifax Public Library, Local Studies Dept.

On 3 December 1906 Alfred Richardson, was given permission to join the General and Finance Committee of the Northern Police Orphanage and Convalescent Home in Halifax.Newspaper Halifax Guardian news item. December 1906 Chief Constables were encouraged to add their patronage. He wrote a booklet for his men which was an extract from a Council meeting held on 7 May 1906.

Signed on behalf of the Watch Committee L. Calvert, Chairman, and A. H. Richardson Chief Constable. West Yorkshire Record Office, Wakefield. Yorks. In 1907 there were several disturbances in Commercial Road, Halifax, during the tram drivers strike, causing much extra work for the police. The local press praised the constabulary for their restraints in handling this situation. By this time Richardson had increased further the reputation of the force as one with a strict sense of discipline and generally having a smart turn out, a sentiment reflected in the local newspapers. Richardson was known to have a love of horses, even to wearing spurs in his office at Harrison Road. Halifax was soon to have its own horses and stables, rather than hire them. Horses were increasingly seen as effective in crowd control.His brother Frank Richardson had used them to great effect in Salisbury when the King and Queen passed through the city a few years earlier. In the annual inspection by His Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary Sir Llewelyn Atcherley in 1930, the Borough Mounted Police in full dress uniform were presented by Richardson to the Inspector.Police Review and Parade Ground Gossip 17 April 1930. In 1907 Alfred Richardson received an open testimonial from the Mayor of Halifax. It was: \\"Testimony of His Worship, the Mayor of Halifax, Alderman R. D. Ward.

Daughter of Mary and John Saltonstall. Born 3 September 1881 near Hebden Bridge, Yorkshire. Joined Suffragette Movement circa 1902. Left Hebden Bridge to live in Halifax March 1906. An Electrical Engineer's clerk and married George Baker, a Private in the Duke of Wellingtons Regiment, at the Unitarian Chapel, Halifax, in June 1917. There were no children and she died a Widow in St. Lukes Hospital, Bradford in September 1957. Saltonstall was born near Hebden Bridge, Yorkshire, and moved to live permanently in Haugh Road Halifax in 1906. Saltonstall met the suffragette Christabel Pankhurst who had toured the area, especially around 1905/6. She made speeches in Halifax during the tram strike and agitating for reform for women by writing letters. This then evolved into a local suffragette movement in Halifax, which Alfred Richardson had to monitor with care and tact. In 1908 Saltonstall wrote an article in the local newspaper, The Halifax Guardian, entitled \\"Our Police System\\" a by-product of which was to give an insight into the Halifax Police and Chief Constable Richardson. Part of the article stated: \\"In order to gather a little information, concerning the work of the Police Force, the other day I paid a visit to the Halifax Borough court. First of all I will mention the fact that a friend of mine had business with the Chief Constable, which fact gave us the chance of getting to his office. Presently we came to an inquiry office where we had to await the Chief's pleasure. Photographs of police groups adorned. Presently we received the intimation that the Chief was disengaged, and we walked into another room sumptuously furnished. The Chief himself had taken refuge behind a table on which were books and pens and inks and flowers. Several movable objects in the form of chairs and rulers and books, and also a fire-screen, were placed near him. An ecclesiastical looking individual in belt and buttons, and with a signet ring and a scholarly stoop, he mounted guard over the door by which we had entered. As in the outer office, photographs etc. and the Chief's overcoat, tall hat, and walking-stick adorned the walls.\\" Comments were made in the local press1) Principally the Halifax Guardian, in 1908 and 1909 after the article appeared. 2) West Riding Archives, Newstead Rd.

It seems that the Chief Constable met with a certain amount of approval by Saltonstall. The Halifax Borough Committee and Watch Committee had complete control over the Force at this time. There was a great deal of discontent in the Halifax Force and Richardson thought his men were getting a raw deal from the Borough Watch Committee but got short shrift from them when he tried to improve their working life. Apparently he got very tenacious about their working hours and would not back down after repeated attempts to get them a better deal got dragged out over a period of time.Newspaper Halifax Guardian 1909. Article: The Policeman's Sunday, by Standfast. In the end, however, he won the day. His men were very grateful for his efforts and a brass plaque was cast in 1910 and erected in the entrance hall of Harrison Road Police Station from 1910 until 1985. When the Station moved to a new location it was re-erected at the new station at Richmond Close, Halifax.West Yorkshire Police Magazine The Beat July 2011. Article, Plaque erected in Alfred's memory. Both Alfred Richardson and his brother Ernest Frank Richardson were involved in improving the indexing of police procedures on identifying past law-breakers by fingerprints and body measurements.

On 18 May 1912 there was a special meeting of the Watch Committee and it was resolved 'That the Police Standing Orders be reprinted as amended and re-published to the Force.'

Coloured lights at busy road junctions were introduced into Halifax, being one of the first Boroughs to do so. There were two lights for each road, one red for Danger (red as it was considered to be the best colour to penetrate fog and haze) and green for Go. These two colours were used by the railways and instantly recognizable by the population. They were attached to tram poles and hand operated by a Constable. This is thought to be possibly one of the first uses of traffic lights in the country. London had used semaphore signals, the first sited at Charing Cross, but they were never considered to be effective. Richardson introduced the Police Telephone System throughout the Borough during the First World War.Newspaper, Halifax Courier and Guardian.

When will these who follow the doings of Halifax, as we have wondered before, give Halifax and its Chief Constable the credit that is due in them, and acknowledge Halifax as the very first town to adopt these street signals for the purpose of communicating from headquarters with men on the various beats. There are 24 such lights in operation in Halifax now and the system has been in use for over 20 years. It has been a great boon. For instance, before it was introduced, if headquarters wished to pass any kind of information on to the man on duty in the streets it could only be done by messenger, a waste of time and a very cumbrous method compared with that in existence today.\\" However, it was not until 1937 that London saw telephones that were erected in Pillars in quantity.Article, Police boxes for London will be installed, but because of pedestrian congestion they will be Pillars.

These had been held for many years by police forces, but there was no standard procedure or rules (such as a minimum number in a line up) that was followed. Halifax was the first Police Force whereby all those taking part had to be of similar likeness and build as the person arrested. The number of individuals in any Parade had to be the same wherever the Parade took place. This was adopted throughout the country and is still used today. At this time Richardson became the secretary of the Chief Constables Association of England and Wales and in 1917 he became Vice President and 1918, President.Newspaper, Halifax Courier.

A range of other trophies had been won by individuals. Later, in the yard of the Police Station at Harrison Road, policemen from the newly increased Mounted Section posed for a photograph. There were seven Constables wearing a white sash and gaiters, two Sergeants, two Inspectors and the Chief Constable. (Wearing gaiters and spurs.) Before the War there were only three or four mounted men. All the horses were stabled in the yard which was big enough for them and motor cars as well as Police parades. The mounted section lasted until 1944, when the number were reduced to four again, the last horses were named Pilot, Portia, Peter and Paul. In 1918 it was officially announced that \\"Major A. H.

However, the Halifax Borough Council Watch Committee asked him to stay on in office, and he did so, until 1944. Around this time Richardson instigated the installation of a Police Out-Station at Kings Cross, Halifax, which was a mini replica of Harrison Road. This, he said, would benefit the police and, just as important, the local population, and set the scene for what was to become Neighbourhood Policing in the UK many years later. The first Police van for the Halifax Borough Police was purchased in 1920.Police Gazette.1920. Richardson supervised the purchase and modifications were made so that it could be used for various other purposes, not least of which was for use by The Coroner's court in Halifax. By 1922 Halifax had many theatres and cinemas. Richardson made and published a booklet regarding the safety of people in 'Queues at Licensed Places of Entertainment' involving their health, weather protection and creating crush room amongst other headings.Booklet, Queues. Author A.H. Richardson Chief Constable dated 22 May 1922. This followed a tragedy in London when some people died in a cinema fire because the emergency doors opened inwards. Richardson ensured all such doors opened outwards from now on. From 16 January 1924 the Borough was granted the status of a 'Quarter Session town'. This affected procedure and routines for Richardson and his police/court work. From this time he was very active in a Prosecutors role in Court cases. In 1925 he wrote a book called 'The Evolution of the Police Force.' and also wrote a booklet 'Superannuation in the Police Force'.Newspaper. Halifax Courier and Guardian.

Richardson on the cover to prove it was genuine and all copies had to be returned immediately the visit was over. Copies were later sent to other Chief Constables as a template for any Royal Visit they might get. In 1930 the government introduced the Road Traffic Act. In 1931 Richardson started the Borough Motor Traffic Police unit, specially concentrating on motor vehicles. A document from the Metropolitan Police Force, London, was sent to Halifax which the Force implemented and was distributed to the Policemen. The Chief Constable wrote in a memorandum dated 1 January 1931: \\"The Road Traffic Act of 1930 places a responsibility on the Police in the Borough which can only be discharged by the organisation of efficient motor patrols throughout the County.\\"Possibly copy in the West Yorkshire Archive Service, Registry of Deeds, Newstead Rd, Wakefield,WF1. 2DE. Richardson purchased two vans which, from 3 August 1931, were used to enforce the new regulations that had just been brought in. Their use was mainly connected with speed limits in built-up areas in the Borough. Richardson continued his involvement with the local population by encouraging swimming and life-saving lessons and giving awards at the Woodside Baths, Halifax.Newspaper, Halifax Courier.

Each book had a unique number which the involved policeman signed for, and at the back is a message to say each copy MUST be returned to the Chief Constable of Halifax at the end of the day. Reading the booklet headings it appears the Royals safety was being taken more seriously perhaps than before. A photograph was taken and published in the Halifax Guardian showing the King and Queen with Chief Constable Richardson, the Mayor and other local Dignitaries. Around this time two more small police stations were opened in the Halifax suburbs. This extended his ideas on bringing the Police to the community and to make the Force more efficient.

Richardson, in a written statement to the press on 3 December 1938 headed, \\"Halifax Slashing Attacks\\" answered a number of questions that had been asked by the press and public, and then called in Scotland Yard, London. Eventually Scotland Yard concluded there were no \\"Slasher\\" attacks after several locals came forward and admitted they had inflicted the wounds upon themselves.Newspaper, The Times.

Born in Ireland, Hogan migrated to North Carolina – then a British colony – in 1751. Settling in Halifax County, he raised a family and established himself as a prominent local figure. A member of the county's Committee of Safety, he represented it at the North Carolina Provincial Congress and helped to draft the first Constitution of North Carolina. Initially a major in the 7th North Carolina Regiment, Hogun advanced quickly in rank during 1776 to become the unit's commanding officer. He participated in the battles of Brandywine and Germantown in 1777. The Continental Congress promoted Hogun to brigadier general in 1779, although several congressmen and the North Carolina General Assembly wished to see Thomas Clark of North Carolina promoted instead. Hogun was in command of North Carolina's line brigade during the Siege of Charleston in the spring of 1780, which ended in the surrender of all but one of North Carolina's regiments of regular infantry as well as more than 5,000 Patriot soldiers under Major General Benjamin Lincoln. Hogun was the highest-ranking officer from North Carolina to be captured and imprisoned after the surrender of Charleston, and despite being offered the opportunity to leave internment under a parole that was generally extended to other captured Continental officers, he remained in a British prisoner-of-war camp near Charleston. Hogun likely chose imprisonment in order to prevent the British Army from recruiting Continental soldiers for its campaign in the West Indies. He became ill and died in the prison on Haddrel's Point, a peninsula in Charleston's harbor. Early life Much of Hogun's early life remains unknown, due to his relative obscurity until the American Revolutionary War. He immigrated to North Carolina from Ireland, his place of birth, in 1751, and on October 3 that year he married Ruth Norfleet. The couple had a son, Lemuel. Hogun made his home near the modern-day community of Hobgood in Halifax County. In 1774, Hogun became a member of the Halifax County Committee of Safety, which indicated his rise to prominence since arriving in the colony 23 years prior. Between August, 1775, and November, 1776, Hogun represented Halifax County in the Third, Fourth, and Fifth North Carolina Provincial Congresses, and demonstrated an interest in military matters. As a delegate, Hogun assisted in drafting the first Constitution of North Carolina. American Revolutionary War=Initial command= Hogun was named a major in the 7th North Carolina Regiment in April 1776, and was given command of the unit on November 26, 1776. Initially, the regiment had some difficulty organizing after several of the officers delayed their military work in order to take care of their personal affairs. Hogun was forced to reprimand his officers sharply, threatening them with the loss of their commissions. At the same time, currents of doubt ran through North Carolina, as Loyalists attempted to hinder enlistment of Patriots by spreading rumors about the imminent demise of the Patriot army in the north, and disease that was allegedly ravaging that force. While commanding his regiment, Hogun fought against the British Army in the battles of Brandywine and Germantown, and was present at Valley Forge in the winter of 1777–78. In 1778, Hogun was given orders to assist in recruiting the so-called \\"additional regiments\\" requested by the Continental Congress from North Carolina, and afterwards was ordered to West Point with the first regiment so recruited. After his arrival, and throughout the late autumn and winter of 1778–79, Hogun's regiment served on a work detail tasked with building up the fortifications at West Point. Hogun was not satisfied with this task, but his men lacked sufficient weapons to allow them to serve as a combat unit at that time. Approximately 400 muskets had to be requisitioned for the regiment to be fully armed. =Promotion and Philadelphia= In early 1779, Major General Benedict Arnold, then Commandant of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, requested that General George Washington send him an additional regiment of Continental soldiers to guard the Patriot stores in Philadelphia. Hogun was sent to Arnold with his newly recruited regiment, arriving on or before January 19, 1779. On January 9, 1779, while en route to Philadelphia, Hogun was promoted to brigadier general by the Continental Congress. His promotion came about in part as a result of what Thomas Burke, a delegate to the Continental Congress from North Carolina, and a fellow Irishman, termed the \\"distinguished intrepidity\\" Hogun had exhibited at Germantown. This caused some controversy, as the North Carolina General Assembly, which was customarily consulted for the promotion of generals from that state, had already nominated Thomas Clark and Jethro Sumner for promotion to the rank of brigadier general. Sumner was promoted, but Clark was passed over in favor of Hogun, who received the support of nine of the thirteen states. Hogun's surprising victory was due in large part to Burke's lobbying efforts among his colleagues in the Continental Congress. By political conventions governing such matters, Burke was bound by the vote of the North Carolina General Assembly to support the state legislature's recommendations of Clark and Sumner, but he worked to convince other Congressmen to vote for Hogun over Clark. Hogun was appointed to succeed Arnold as Commandant of Philadelphia on March 19, 1779, serving until November 22 that year. =Charleston campaign= A black and white print of Alonzo Chappel's Siege of Charleston, depicting the engagement from the British perspective. Hogun's position would have been on the left of the Patriot lines from this vantage point. A copy of General Henry Clinton's 1780 map of the Siege of Charleston, showing the location of Haddrel's Point, where Hogun died, at far right. In November 1779, Hogun took command of the North Carolina Brigade of the North Carolina Line, composed of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th North Carolina Regiments. Through the winter of 1779–80, Hogun led the brigade of about 700 men from Philadelphia to Charleston, South Carolina, where he was placed under the command of Major General Benjamin Lincoln. The march was arduous, and Hogun's brigade endured one of the coldest, harshest winters in years. Hogun's command arrived at Charleston on March 13, 1780, which according to Lincoln gave \\"great spirit to the Town, and confidence to the Army.\\" The North Carolinians were immediately put to the task of defending the city, which was threatened with a siege by British General Henry Clinton in early March. Shortly after Hogun's arrival, many of North Carolina's militia present in the city began to return home because their enlistment terms ended on or about March 24. The militiamen had only agreed to serve limited terms, and as they were not under Hogun's direct command he was powerless to stop them leaving. Charleston was principally located on a peninsula, and so Lincoln aligned his Continental units in defensive works that barricaded the \\"neck\\" of the peninsula, using a line of redoubts, redans, and batteries. These defensive works were connected by a parapet, and commanded from a concrete hornwork jutting out from the defensive line. In front of the fortifications, the Patriot forces dug an 18-foot-wide moat, and between the moat and parapet they constructed a line of abatis to stall any British assault. When the siege by the British Army began in earnest on April 1, Hogun and his men were positioned on the right of the Continental Army's lines, near the Cooper River. Hogun participated in a council of war on April 20, 1780. Several members of the South Carolina Privy Council, a part of the civilian government, threatened to block the Continental Army's attempts to withdraw from Charleston, if the council of war voted to do so. Although the defending army had only eight to ten days worth of provisions, Lincoln bowed to pressure from civil authorities and delayed evacuation. On April 26, another council of war at which Hogun was present determined that the British presence on all sides of the city prevented the army's escape. For the next two weeks, the British and Patriot forces exchanged artillery and rifle fire at all times of day, and the British bombardment whittled down the American breastworks. On May 8, Lincoln called another council of war with all his army's general and field officers and ships' captains to discuss terms of surrender that had been proposed by Clinton. Of the 61 officers in attendance at that council, 49, including Hogun, voted to offer terms of capitulation with the British commander. When these were rejected, hostilities continued, and Lincoln called another council of war on May 11 to further discuss terms of capitulation. The council voted to present further terms to Clinton, which he accepted. On May 12, 1780, Hogun was among the officers under Lincoln who formally surrendered to the British Army, along with approximately 5,000 Continental and militia soldiers. The surrender led to the loss of all but one of the regiments of the North Carolina Line then in existence, depriving the state of all regular, non-militia soldiers. As a brigadier general, Hogun held the highest rank of the approximately 814 Continental soldiers from North Carolina who capitulated at Charleston. =Imprisonment and death= Rather than allowing himself to be paroled, Hogun requested he be taken prisoner, and was interned at the British prison camp at Haddrel's Point on Point Pleasant, located in what is now Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, across from Sullivan's Island. Hogun's decision was based, in part, on his desire to stifle the recruiting efforts of the British, who sought to enlist captured Continental soldiers to serve in the British West Indies. The British, however, held only the officers at Haddrel's Point, deciding to house the enlisted men in barracks in Charleston. Officers at Haddrel's Point were subjected to harsh treatment, barred from fishing to catch much-needed food, and threatened with deportation from South Carolina. Approximately 3,300 Patriot soldiers were confined in prison camps around Charleston that were similar to the one at Haddrel's Point, and many were destined for cramped, unsanitary prison ships. Because of the conditions, many Continental soldiers agreed to join Loyalist regiments, but Hogun and other officers set up courts martial in the camps and attempted to maintain a dignified military structure. Hogun's health soon declined, and he died in the prison camp on January 4, 1781. He was buried in an unmarked grave. Legacy On March 14, 1786, the North Carolina legislature granted Hogun's son, Lemuel, a tract near modern-day Nashville, Tennessee, in recognition of his father's service. The elder Hogun was one of twenty-two Patriot generals who perished during the American Revolutionary War, and one of twelve who died from disease or other non-combat causes. In the early 20th century, North Carolina jurist and historian Walter Clark noted that while the careers of three of North Carolina's other generals – Brigadier Generals Francis Nash and James Moore, and Major General Robert Howe – were well known to contemporary historians, the story of Hogun's career as well as that of Jethro Sumner had been neglected. Hogun's personal papers appear to have been destroyed while in the possession of his descendants in Alabama during the American Civil War, leaving virtually no surviving correspondence that would shed further light on his life. In 1954, the North Carolina Highway Historical Marker Program, a division of the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources, erected a historical marker in Hogun's honor near his former home in Halifax County.

Journal of Renmin University of China, 1998,V(1): 7-13,126. introduced into official discourse by Mao Zedong as the initial stage of socialism, is a sub-theory of Chinese Marxist thought which explains why capitalist techniques are used in the Chinese economy. Origins The theory was introduced into official discourse by Mao Zedong The concept of a primary stage of socialism was conceived before China introduced economic reforms. When discussing the necessity of commodity relations at the 1st Zhengzhou Conference held between 2 and 10 November 1958, Mao Zedongthe Chairman of the Communist Party of China's Central Committeesaid that China was in the \\"initial stage of socialism\\". Mao did not elaborate on the idea; his successors did. =Xue Muqiao's theory of the \\"immature socialist system\\"= Xue Muqiao introduced the term \\"underdeveloped socialism\\" in his book China's Socialist Economy. The book was written in the orthodox Marxist–Leninist framework enunciated by Joseph Stalin in Economic Problems of Socialism in the U.S.S.R. (1952). Xue wrote that within the socialist mode of production there were several phases and for China to reach an advanced form of socialism it had to focus on developing the productive forces. He proposed a theory in which the basic laws of economic growth were those in which \\"the relations of production must conform to the level of the productive forces\\". Similarly to Stalin, Xue considered the productive forces to be primary and that this was a fundamental universal law of economics. Unlike Stalin, Xue believed there were principles that guided the socialist transition, the key one being the principle of \\"from each according to his ability, to each according to his work\\"; this principle would guide socialist development, even when China had reached advanced socialism, and would be replaced with \\"from each according to his ability, to each according to his need\\" only when there existed general abundance. Xue based his arguments upon the economic policies pursued during the Cultural Revolution, which he believed had led to \\"the most severe setbacks and heaviest losses suffered by the Party, the state and the people since the founding of the People's Republic\\". Xue believed the relations of production were determined by ownership in the economy. He said that since the productive forces in China were \\"backward\\", the relations of production were at a comparable level. While believing industry in China had become the \\"ownership of the whole people\\", Xue said agriculture was lagging far behind, which required ending the practice of paying wages based on collective efforts, supporting the re-introduction of individual incentives and increasing state investments in agriculture. Xue's suggestions were abandoned at the 6th Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee held in June 1981 because they failed to solve the problems facing agriculture. From the 6th Plenary Session onwards, the CPC led by Wan Li began supporting the de-collectivization of agriculture. At the beginning, Wan chose a conservative reformist approach, stating that: > Prudence is necessary when approaching the reform of the commune > institutions. We should not require each level to reform from top to bottom > by prescribing a time limit for fulfilment. Until suitable new > organizational forms can replace production brigades and teams, we should > not recklessly change existing forms and bring about a disorderly situation. Wan called for the dismantlement of the People's Commune system and its replacement with a household-responsibility system. He referred to the changes underway in the agricultural system as the creation of a new mode of production and called it the socialist commodity economy. Party theorist Du Runsheng supported Wan's position, saying, \\"a principle of Marxism is that every change in the relations of ownership is an inevitable outcome of the development of new productive forces which can no longer fit in with the old relations of ownership\\". He also said: > Today's household undertakings are very different in nature. Since land is > owned by the public, they are restricted by the collective economy in many > ways. They represent a level of management in the co-operative economy, and > constitute an organic component part of the entire socialist economy... It > is feared that the household contracting system will promote the > conservative idea of private possession among the peasants. This fear is not > without grounds. However, we must be able to see the other side of the > matter, which also happens to be the prevailing aspect. Today's peasants are > different from those of the past. They are now new-type labourers under the > socialist co-operative system. =Su Shaozhi's theory of \\"undeveloped socialism\\"= CPC theoretician Su Shaozhi, an official from the People's Daily, began a debate in 1979 at a CPC theory conference to re-examine Mao Zedong's assertion of \\"class struggle as the key link\\" when he introduced the term \\"undeveloped socialism\\" to refer to China. Su, co-writing with Feng Langrui, published an article in Economic Research () in 1979 which called into question the Chinese socialist project by using Marxist methodology. The article analyzed the basis of Chinese socialism by looking at the writings of Karl Marx. Marx drew a distinction between lower-stage communismcommonly referred to as the socialist mode of production and higher-phase communismoften referred to as communism. Su's and Feng's article created three subdivisions within the socialist mode of production; the first phase was the transition from the capitalist mode of production to the socialist mode of productionthe phase in which the proletariat seized power and set-up the dictatorship of the proletariat and in which undeveloped socialism was created. The second phase was advanced socialism; the socialism that Marx wrote about. They said China was an undeveloped socialist nation because: > The characteristics of undeveloped socialism are the two forms of public > ownership, commodity production and commodity exchange. Capitalists have > been basically eliminated as a class but there are still capitalist and > bourgeois remnants, even feudal remnants. There also exist quite a few small > producers, class differences among workers and peasants … and the force of > habit of small-scale producers. The production forces are still not highly > developed. And there is not an abundance of products … Therefore, the > transition toward socialism has not yet been completed. Sun and Feng opposed the party line that the main contradiction in Chinese society was between the \\"advanced social system\\" and the \\"backward production forces\\". This line, originally conceived of at the 8th National Congress held in 1956 but removed by Mao and re-introduced after Mao's death, was intended to emphasize the importance of improving the economy. Su found it problematic because it meant that the superstructure could be more advanced than the level of the productive forcesa statement that was not in line with classical Marxism. Su countered, saying that China did not have a material base for a full transition to socialism. He said: > The socialist system consists mainly of production relations. Whether a > production relation is advanced or not is determined by just one criterion, > namely, whether or not it can meet the demands of production forces and > facilitate their development. Although some production relations, such as > commune ownership, may be superior to ownership by the production team in > terms of the stage of development, in rural China today, where manual labor > remains predominant, only ownership by the production team, rather than by > the commune, would be the type of production relations capable of measuring > up to the level of production forces and facilitating their development. If > ... commune ownership is adopted, it would damage the development of > production forces. The response to Su and Feng's article was mixed. Some responded positively and called for a retreat from socialist practices and a return to the policies of New Democracya period that lasted until 1956 when China had a mixed economy. More conservative elements tried to suppress it. Deng Liqun, the Deputy President of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), used his powers to organize a meeting which criticized Su, who had become a member of the CASS Institute of Marxism–Leninism after writing the article. While Su garnered some support from high-standing officials, such as General Ye Jianying, the concept was the target of several crackdowns; the first occurred in 1981 during a crackdown on socialists supporting liberal democracy. A later crackdown was orchestrated by longstanding party theoretician Hu Qiamou and thirdly during the Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign in 1983. The reasoning was that the idea lent weight for forces opposed to socialism in China and was therefore dangerous. Despite this, the 6th Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee sanctioned the idea that China was in the \\"primary stage of socialism\\", even if key theoreticians such as Wang Xiaoqiang dismissed Chinese socialism as \\"agrarian socialism\\", believing that socialism had been constructed on a feudal base. Formulating the theory of a primary stage of socialism Su's theory of undeveloped socialism led to the formulation of the primary stage of socialism theory under CPC General Secretary Zhao Ziyang's stewardship. The term had been used by the CPC during the Anti- Spiritual Pollution Campaign of 1983 but had never been explained. After consulting with Deng Xiaoping, the theory of a primary stage of socialism was used as the theoretical basis of the Political Report to the 13th National Congress held in 1987. The theory focused mainly on developing the productive forces and took a highly economic deterministic view on developing socialism. Despite certain pitfalls, the theory is still used to explain the use of capitalist techniques in China. The main aim of the theory was to reconceptualize socialism to make Marxism fit for contemporary use. Su and Zhang Xiangyang said the primary stage of socialism in China began in the 1950s when the CPC put an end to the policies of New Democracy and would last an estimated 100 years. The previous emphasis on economic equality in favour of economic growth was abandoned. Deng stated: > Of the many lessons we have to sum up, a very important one is this: we > should make clear what is socialism and how to build socialism ... The > primary task of socialism is to develop production forces and to elevate the > standard of the material and cultural life of the people. Our twenty years > of experience from 1958 to 1976 have told us: poverty is not socialism, > socialism is to eliminate poverty. It is not socialism to not develop > production forces and raise the people's living standards. By this point, Deng had equated upholding socialism with developing the level of the productive forces; The ideal of common equality was postponed until an unspecified time. Su and Zhang reached similar conclusions, saying that Marx had two goals when he wrote about the socialist future: A social system in which the productive forces developed and the individual would be granted a great chance of self-development. However, developing the productive forces became the precondition for the greater self-learning of the individual through common equality; Su and Zhang said that the former would lead to the latter. The left were generally pleased with the theory, which was based upon orthodox Marxist premises. However, some people on the right considered the theory was proof that China needed to reintroduce capitalism to build socialism. Marx had written that socialism developed from capitalism, but China had skipped the capitalist mode of production and went from feudalism to socialism. Zhao's adviser Bao Tong's article \\"The Young Horse of Socialism, the Old Horse of Capitalism, and Other Related Matters published in the People's Daily, became the first theoretical work which tried to explain the concept. Bao said because the economic foundation of socialism in China was weak and contained elements of feudalism, and that acknowledging China's position as being in the primary stage of socialism would answer \\"many ideological questions can be readily solved\\". Chen Junsheng, the Secretary General of the State Council, wrote a similar article that stressed the need to uphold the Four Cardinal Principles and reform during the primary stage of socialism. Effect on party ideology=Changing views on capitalism= The reconception of socialism led directly to the reconception of capitalism because of their diametric opposition to each other. Previously, the CPC had said supporting capitalism meant supporting a historical retreat and capitalism was considered the diametric opposite of socialism and their relations were considered hostile and incompatible. The official reconception of the two terms was sanctioned in the Political Report to the 13th National Congress. Before the reform efforts, capitalism and socialism were believed to be part of a sequential relationship, the latter developing from the former. A less traditional view was that capitalism had proven it had a \\"greater capacity for creating human civilization\\" than Marx expected, which indirectly meant that socialism could learn from capitalism. Another mark of continuity was that the two systems existed alongside each other. The first change in official discourse was to rebuke Vladimir Lenin's theory of imperialism. Lenin had reached the conclusion that capitalism had reached the stage of imperialism, a stage in which capitalism would undergo a protracted crisis that would lead to war, the inevitable socialist revolutions and the end of war by the newly established socialist states. This theory had formed the basis of Chinese foreign policy well into the 1970s, but was not officially rebuked until Zhao's report to the 13th National Congress. At the congress, Zhao re-used a 1985 statement by Deng Xiaoping, in which he said, \\"[t]he major themes of the contemporary world are peace and development\\". By saying that the task of socialist countries was maintaining \\"peace and development\\" rather than \\"war and revolution\\", Deng was upbraiding Lenin's theory. According to Su and Zhang, the rationale for the change was that: * the decline in ideological conflict in tandem with the creation of nuclear weapons had radically changed East–West relations and the end of colonialism had altered the basis of North–South relations; * technical and scientific progress haddespite Marx' forecaststrengthened capitalism and changed the international arena since Lenin's death; * the increased economic interdependence brought by economic globalization had reduced the risks of war; * the reforms within socialist states had brought socialist economies closer to the world market and the capitalist economies. Xu Jiatun, a Party theoretician, said capitalism had changed from the days of Marx; proof of this was \\"the emergence of macroeconomic regulation, the welfare state, and the middle class that had ameliorated socioeconomic structures and class relations under capitalism. Xu concluded that capitalism had proved a more successful system than Chinese socialism, which was based on feudal ideology and institutions. Yu Guangyuan said Marx was wrong and that the changes within capitalism had allowed for a much greater development of the productive forces then Marx could ever think possible. However, the most common view was the convergence theory, whose adherents' views were published in leading media outlets throughout the country. The convergence theory said socialism and capitalism were becoming increasingly similar, since capitalist and socialist countries were becoming increasingly similar in economic terms; planning was taking place in capitalism, market economics was occurring in socialism, ownership and management were separated under both systems, and both had undergone similar patterns of modernization. On this basis, the proponents of convergence theory called on people to stop asking whether a certain technique was capitalist or socialist because it did not matter anymore. The end result of the convergence theory was to de-ideologize the meaning of the two terms. =Historical materialism: universal law or methodology= At the 13th National Congress, Zhao concluded that the common rightist error when analyzing Chinese development was to question the legitimacy of the revolution and socialist superstructural elements established in its aftermath and that the common leftist error was to believe that you could skip over the primary stage of socialism directly to advanced socialism, a view that Zhao designated as utopian. However, there was a problem; according to official statements, China had an advanced superstructure and a backward productive forces; this went against classical Marxism, which said the superstructure was \\"solely determined by economic factors\\"in China the mode of production was determined by the superstructure. All this went against the general notion of Marx' theory of historical materialism, which states that a mode of production is solely grounded on the material base. However, Su and Zhang did not believe these discrepancies had proven the theory wrong; they concluded that historical materialism should be considered \\"a scientific methodology for the analysis of the general trend\\", not a universal law that explained former and future historical processes. According to Su and Zhang, instead of viewing one factor—economy—as dominant, as was previously done, one should analyze how all factors interact with each other, especially the effects of the superstructure on the rest of society. In their view, superstructural elements \\"played an obvious role in China's 'leap' from semifeudalism to socialism\\". Socialism in China was safeguarded by the CPC and its commitment to Marxist ideology. The problem with historical materialism as law-binding was, according to the rightists, what role humans played in historical development and the possibility of the existence of modes of production other than those outlined by Marx. According to Hong Yingsan, the notion of a primary stage of socialism was difficult because it entailed that China was simultaneously pre-capitalist and post-capitalist. This went against the basic notion in historical materialism that history was unilinear rather than multilinear, and proved that other factors than the productive forces in society \\"could determine the mode of production in a given society\\". The problem facing the CPC was that unilinear view of history meant that China could not adopt socialism because it had skipped the capitalist mode of production, but a multilinear view meant that China did not need to adopt socialism because it was not a specific \\"stage in human evolution\\". Su and Zhang said the most pressing problem for CPC theorists to answer was, \\"do people have freedom to choose a particular set of production relations?\\". They pointed to Marx's theory of an Asiatic mode of production. Some rightists argued against the mode of productions envisioned by Marx, stating that all changes in human history were subjective and were not guided by universal laws. =The role of Marxism= While the CPC pursued non-orthodox economic policies, it believed the party would be able to safeguard China's goal of socialist development by transforming Marxism into a dominant value system. This was reflected by the introduction of the term \\"socialist spiritual civilization\\", a concept introduced in 1981 and mentioned in the Political Report to the 13th National Congress. The main function of socialist spiritual civilization was to check against the dangers of ideological retreat in the party's effort to progress toward socialism. A CPC resolution in 1986 said, \\"we will be not able to guarantee the socialist direction of our modernization course, and our socialist society will lose its goals and ideals\\" if the party stopped upholding Marxist doctrine. However, because the material base, officially referred to as material civilization, created by the economic reforms did not conform with Marxist analysis of socialism, the CPC concluded that in the new era Marxism would be given the role as the dominant value system, which entailed that other value systems could be accepted but these systems could not negate Marxism.

However, the design was removed after the AIADMK party returned to power in May 2001. The renovation resulted in the original tusk-shaped entrance arch giving way to a highly polished marble tiled structure, widened pathways, and building of ornamental octagonal mantapams. After the Indian Ocean tsunami struck the coastal parts of the state in December 2004, the memorial, along with other structures on the seashore, was affected.

He received his PhD with thesis Over de absorptie van stralende warmte door waterdamp (On the absorption of radiant heat by water vapor) under the direction of Pieter L. Rijke. From 1886 to 1921 Haga was professor of physics at the University of Groningen, where he designed and oversaw the building of a new physics laboratory, opened in 1892. From 1900 Haga was also the rector of the University of Gronigen. He performed experiments on the voltage of the Weston cell; these experiments lead to the modern definition of the volt. With Cornelis Wind, Haga passed X-rays through a 15-micrometer slit as a source with a V-shaped narrowing slit as a target. The target slit was 27 micrometers at the opening and nearly 0 micrometers at the output. Haga and Wind interpreted a diffuse broadening of the X-rays emitted at the narrower end of the slit as a diffraction pattern. (Haga and Wind's German version of De buiging der Röntgenstralen) Haga was one of the founders of the Nederlandse Natuurkundige Vereniging (Dutch Physics Association). In addition to Cornelis Harm Wind (1867–1911),Cornelis Wind held the chair of theoretical physics at the University of Utrecht, and, when he died at the age of 43, he was succeeded by Peter Debye.

The pharmacological properties of halostachine have some similarity to those of these structurally-related compounds, and Halostachys caspica extracts have been included as a constituent of certain OTC dietary supplements, but halostachine has never been developed as a prescription drug. Although it is found in nature as a single stereoisomer, halostachine is more commonly available as a synthetic product in the form of its racemate (see below). In appearance it is a colorless solid. Occurrence Naturally- occurring halostachine was first discovered by Syrneva in the halophytic plant Halostachys caspica (now classed as Halostachys belangerianahttp://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-2838829) (family Amaranthaceae).Y. I. Syrneva (1941). \\"The pharmacology of the new alkaloid halostachine.\\" Farmakologiya i Toksikologiya 4 45-51.

Halostachine has also been isolated from perennial ryegrass, Lolium perenne and from tall fescue, Festuca arundinacea.A. J. Aasen, C. C. J. Culvenor, E. P. Finnie, A. W. Kellock, and L. W.

The presence of N-methylphenylethanolamine in rat brain was implied by the experiments described by Saavedra and Axelrod.J. M. Saavedra and J. Axelrod (1973). \\"Demonstration and distribution of phenylethanolamine in brain and other tissues.\\" Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 70 769-772. Chemistry=Synthesis= Several syntheses of racemic N-methylphenylethanolamine have been published over the years. A synthesis using \\"classical\\" methodology was reported by Durden and co-workers, starting from acetophenone. The methyl group of acetophenone was brominated with bromine to give α-bromoacetophenone, which was then reacted with N-methylbenzylamine to give an amino-ketone. The amino-ketone was reduced with lithium aluminum hydride to the corresponding amino-alcohol, and the N-benzyl group finally removed by catalytic hydrogenation using a palladium on charcoal catalyst.D. A. Durden, A. V. Juorio and B. A. Davis (1980). \\"Thin-layer chromatographic and high resolution mass spectrometric determination of β-hydroxyphenylethylamines in tissues as dansyl-acetyl derivatives.\\" Anal. Chem. 52 1815-1820. Another synthesis, due to Nordlander and co-workers, began with the Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene by N-(trifluoroacetyl)glycyl chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride. The resulting N-(trifluoroacetyl)-α-aminoacetophenone was then N-methylated with methyl iodide and potassium carbonate, and the product finally converted to racemic N-methylphenylethanolamine by means of sodium borohydride in ethanol.J. E. Nordlander, M. J. Payne, F. G. Njoroge, M. A. Balk, G. D. Laikos, and V. M. Vishwanath (1984). \\"Friedel-Crafts acylation with N-(trifluoroacetyl)-α-amino acid chlorides. Application to the preparation of β-arylalkylamines and 3-substituted 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines.\\" J. Org. Chem. 49 4107–4111. An efficient, stereospecific synthesis of halostachine was reported by Zandbergen and co- workers: (R)-(+)-α-hydroxybenzeneacetonitrile was first O-protected using 2-methoxypropene. The product was then treated with DIBAL, and the unisolated imine then treated sequentially with ammonium bromide and methylamine to effect \\"transimination\\". The resulting N-methylimine was converted to (R)-(−)-α-[(methylamino)methyl]benzenemethanol (i.e. (R)-(−)-halostachine) with sodium borohydride.P. Zandbergen, A. M.C.H. van den Niewendijk, J. Brussee, A. van der Gen, and C. G. Kruse (1992). \\"A one-pot reduction- transimination-reduction synthesis of N-substituted β-ethanolamines from cyanohydrins.\\" Tetrahedron 48 3977-3982. =Properties= Chemically, N-methylphenyethanolamine is an aromatic compound, an amine, and an alcohol. The amino-group makes this compound a weak base, capable of reacting with acids to form salts. One common salt of N-methylphenylethanolamine is the (racemic) hydrochloride, C9H13NO.HCl, m.p. 103-104 °C. The pKa of N-methylphenylethanolamine hydrochloride, at 25 °C and at a concentration of 10 mM, is 9.29.J. Armstrong and R. B. Barlow (1976). \\"The ionization of phenolic amines, including apomorphine, dopamine and catecholamines and an assessment of zwitterion constants.\\" Br. J. Pharmacol. 57 501–516. The presence of the hydroxy-group on the benzylic C of the N-methylphenylethanolamine molecule creates a chiral center, so the compound exists in the form of two enantiomers, d- and l-N-methylphenylethanolamine, or as the racemic mixture, d,l- N-methylphenylethanolamine. The dextrorotatory isomer corresponds to the S-configuration, and the levorotatory isomer to the R-configuration.G. G. Lyle (1960). \\"Rotatory Dispersion Studies. I. Aralkylamines and Alcohols.\\" J. Org. Chem. 25 1779–1784.R. Lukes, V. Dienstbierova, J. Kovar and K. Blaha (1961). \\"Uber die Konfiguration Stickstoffhaltiger Verbindungen. XII.

The N-methylphenylethanolamine isolated from Halostachys caspica, and given the alkaloid name \\"halostachine\\", was found to be the levorotatory enantiomer: 80 px Halostachine has a melting point of 43-45 °C and [α]D = - 47.03°; the hydrochloride salt of this enantiomer has m.p. 113-114 °C, and [α]D = - 52.21°. The resolution of racemic N-methylphenylethanolamine, by means of its tartrate salts, yielded enantiomers with specific rotations of [α]D = - 52.46° and + 52.78°.G. P. Menshikov and G. M. Borodina (1947). J. Gen. Chem. (USSR) 17 1569. Pharmacology The first pharmacological investigation of synthetic, racemic N-methylphenylethanolamine (referred to as \\"methylphenylethanolamine\\" by these authors) was carried out by Barger and Dale, who found it to be a pressor, with a potency similar to that of phenylethanolamine and β-phenylethylamine in a cat preparation.G. Barger and H. H. Dale (1910).\\"Chemical structure and sympathomimetic action of amines.\\" J. Physiol. 41 19-59. Subsequently, this compound (still in the form of its racemate) was studied more thoroughly by Chen and co-workers, who confirmed its pressor activity, but observed that it was about one-half as potent as phenylethanolamine after i.v. administration in a cat preparation: a total dose of 5 x 10−6 M (or ~ 1 mg of the HCl salt) caused a maximum rise in blood pressure of 26 mm Hg. Additional experiments by these investigators showed that racemic N-methylphenylethanolamine also caused mydriasis in the rabbit eye (instillation of a drop of 0.05 M/L solution producing about 5 x as much dilation as the same dose of phenylethanolamine), inhibition of isolated rabbit intestine strips, and contraction of isolated guinea pig uterus. The drug was also astringent on nasal mucosa.K. K. Chen, C.-K. Wu and E. Henriksen (1929). \\"Relationship between the pharmacological action and the chemical constitution and configuration of the optical isomers of ephedrine and related compounds.\\" J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 36 363-400. In man, an oral dose of 50 mg produced no effects on blood pressure. Later studies by Lands and Grant on the effects of racemic N-methylphenylethanolamine (identified by the Sterling-Winthrop company codes \\"WIN 5529\\" or \\"WIN 5529-2\\") on blood pressure in intact dogs showed similar results to those obtained by Chen et al.: 0.41 mg/kg of the drug, given i.v., caused a rise in blood pressure of 38 mm Hg lasting 3–10 minutes. This effect was described as being ~ 1/200 x that produced by the same dose of epinephrine (or ~ 1/250 x when compared on a molar basis).A. M. Lands (1952). \\"The cardiovascular actions of 1-(3-aminophenyl)-2-aminoethanol and related compounds.\\" J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 104 474-477.A. M. Lands and J. I. Grant (1952). \\"The vasopressor action and toxicity of cyclohexylethylamine derivatives.\\" J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 106 341-345. In sheep, halostachine produced only a slight mydriasis at a dose of 30 mg/kg, i.v., and \\"excitation\\" at 100 mg/kg; in guinea pigs, doses of 30 mg/kg, i.p., produced restlessness lasting about 1/2 hour, but 100 mg/kg, i.p., caused excitement, mydriasis, salivation, piloerection, muscular tremors, and increased heart and respiratory rates, with a return to normal after 1/2–2 hours. More recent studies of N-methylphenylethanolamine (presumably as the racemate) by Shannon and co-workers confirmed and extended the earlier research. Intravenous administration of the drug to dogs, in doses of ~ 6 – 18 mg/kg, was found to produce significant mydriasis (a 100% increase in pupil diameter resulting from a dose of 17.5 mg/kg), the effect being somewhat greater (~ 1.3 x) than that produced by the same doses of phenylethanolamine. N-Methylphenylethanolamine also caused a decrease in heart rate which was inversely related to the dose (i.e. progressively larger doses caused less bradycardia), and which was quantitatively less than that produced by the same doses of phenylethanolamine. The drug produced a fall in body temperature which was also inversely correlated with the dose, and which was smaller than that produced by the same doses of phenylethanolamine. Additional symptoms that were observed included profuse salivation and piloerection, although, in contrast to phenylethanolamine, N-methylphenylethanolamine did not produce any stereotyped or rapid eye movements. These results led the authors to suggest that N-methylphenylethanolamine was acting on both α and β adrenergic receptors.H. E. Shannon, E. J. Cone and D. Yousefnejad (1981). \\"Physiologic effects and plasma kinetics of phenylethanolamine and its N-methyl homolog in the dog.\\" J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 217 379-385. Using a β2 adrenergic receptor preparation derived from transfected HEK 293 cells, Liappakis and co-workersG. Liapakis, W. C. Chan, M. Papadokostaki and J. A. Javitch (2004). \\"Synergistic contributions of the functional groups of epinephrine to its affinity and efficacy at the β2 adrenergic receptor.\\" Mol. Pharmacol. 65 1181-1190. found that in wild-type receptors, racemic N-methylphenylethanolamine (referred to by these authors as \\"halostachine\\") had ~ 1/120 x the affinity of epinephrine in competition experiments with 3[H]-CGP-12177, and was therefore about 3 x more potent than phenylethanolamine itself.Considered to be an antagonist of β1 and β2 receptors, and an agonist of β3 receptors. Measurements of cAMP accumulation in intact transfected HEK 293 cells, after treatment with EEDQ to inactivate 98-99% of the receptors, indicated that \\"halostachine\\" was ~ 19% as effective as epinephrine in maximally-stimulating the cAMP accumulation in the wild-type receptors. \\"Halostachine\\" was thus interpreted as having partial agonist properties at β2 receptors. Pharmacodynamics The pharmacokinetics of N-methylphenylethanolamine, after i.v. administration to dogs, were studied by Shannon and co-workers, who found that the drug followed the \\"two- compartment model\\", with T1/2(α) ≃ 9.7 minutes and T1/2(β) ≃ 56.4 minutes; the \\"plasma half-life\\" of N-methylphenylethanolamine was therefore about 1 hour. Biochemistry In animal tissue, N-methylphenylethanolamine is formed by the action of the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyl transferase (PNMT), first isolated from monkey adrenal glands by Julius Axelrod, on phenylethanolamine.J.Axelrod (1962). \\"Purification and properties of phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase.\\" J. Biol. Chem. 237 1657-1660. The actions of monoamine oxidases MAO-A and MAO-B from rat brain mitochondria on N-methylphenylethanolamine were characterized by Osamu and co-workers, who found that at a concentration of 10 μM, this compound (stereochemical identity unspecified) was a specific substrate for MAO-B, but at 100 μM and 1000 μM it became a substrate for both MAO-A and MAO-B. The kinetic constants reported by these researchers were: Km = 27.7 μM; Vmax = 3.67 nM/mg protein/30 mins (high affinity), and Km = 143 μM; Vmax = 7.87 nM/mg protein/30 mins (low affinity).S. Osamu, O. Masakazu, and K. Yoshinao (1980). \\"Characterization of N-methylphenylethylamine and N-methylphenylethanolamine as substrates for type A and type B monoamine oxidase\\". Biochem. Pharmacol. 29 2663-2667.  Toxicity  The LD50 of N-methylphenylethanolamine in mouse is reported as 44 mg/kg, i.v., and ~ 140 mg/kg, i.p. (racemic; HCl salt).; in an earlier paper from the same year, Lands notes an approximate LD50 of 490 mg/kg (mouse, i.p.) for what is ostensibly the same drug, but coded as \\"WIN 5529\\", rather than \\"WIN 5529-2\\". The minimum lethal dose of the racemate in rabbits, i.v., is given as 100 mg/kg. Studies carried out to determine whether halostachine might be responsible for causing \\"ryegrass staggers\\" in Australia involved the administration of doses up to 100 mg/kg, i.v., in sheep, and 100 mg/kg, i.p., in guinea pigs, without any indication of lethality. Although apparently adrenergic effects were evident in the guinea pigs (see \\"Pharmacology\\", above), the investigators concluded that halostachine was unlikely to be the cause of the \\"staggers\\" syndrome.

Finally, on 23 June 1861, Dom Pedro II and representatives of the company travelled the full from Petrópolis to Juiz de Fora in a stagecoach. The opening of the road was significant for Juiz de Fora, turning it into an important trading centre. It also gave rise to the first travel guide to Brazil \\"Doze Horas em Diligência - Guia do Viajante de Petrópolis a Juiz de Fora\\" (Twelve Hours in a Stagecoach – A Traveler's Guide to Petrópolis to Juiz de Fora) by Revert Henrique Klumb, published in 1872. Over time the original road was modified in various stretches. Between Petropolis and Itaipava, and between Areal and Alberto Torres new roads were opened in the mid-twentieth century, and in 1980 the entire road was replaced by the BR-040 dual carriageway trunk from Rio de Janeiro to Brasilia leaving the former União e Indústria with only local traffic. The Road Today Today the road forms part of the road systems of the states of Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais. It is designated RJ-134 between Petrópolis and Areal, BR-393 in Três Rios, RJ-151 from Comendador Levy Gasparian to Mont Serrat, MG-874 between Simão Pereira and Matias Barbosa and finally BR-267 from Matias Barbosa to Juiz de Fora Several buildings and bridges remain from the old União e Indústria, among them the Santana bridge in Alberto Torres, restored by the government. There are also the Domingos Soares da Veiga viaduct in Areal, the Bridge of Herons in Três Rios and the former Paraibuna station in Mont'Serrat, municipality of Comendador Levy Gasparian, which was built in 1856 for the change of mules. Located in a French-style cottage, since June 23, 1972, the station has housed the road museum, dedicated to the history of the União e Indústria and Brazil's trunk road network. A major exhibit is the stagecoach \\"Mazeppa\\" in which Pedro II made the first voyage on the road between Petrópolis and Juiz de Fora. \\"Mazeppa\\" is the only remaining coach of the União e Indústria.

The NZAVS was started in 2009 by Chris Sibley, a professor in psychology at the University of Auckland. The NZAVS was inspired by major social surveys conducted internationally, such as the National Election Studies, the World Values Survey and the General Social Survey, and aims to provide a similar resource for New Zealand. As of November 8, 2016, the NZAVS research team had published 100 peer reviewed publications using data from the study. Sample details=Questionnaires= The NZAVS uses a self-report inventory to collect information. The questionnaire is administered via both postal mail and an online survey. The NZAVS includes a large range of scales including those measuring self-esteem, national and personal wellbeing, satisfaction with life, religious beliefs, personality, psychological distress, ideologies, political and environmental attitudes. =Data structure= The NZAVS has a nested data structure. Participants are modeled as the Level 1 or lower-level unit. The NZAVS contains geographic information from mesh blocks for each participant. Mesh blocks contain information about each participants local neighborhood based on census data from each meshblock. This information is modeled as the Level 2, or higher- level unit in many of the NZAVS research papers. Mesh blocks are small geographic area units, each containing roughly 100 people, with defined boundaries. Each mesh block is in turn nested within larger census area units (CAU; roughly 1000 people in size). Statistics New Zealand provide detailed demographic information about the population of each mesh block based on census data, such as median income, ethnic proportions and size, religious affiliation, etc. This information is integrated into the NZAVS datasets. Of particular note are the New Zealand Deprivation Index (an index of poverty or socio-economic status based on a principal components analysis of indicators of deprivation for each area unit); and a CAU-based Gini coefficient derived by Chris Sibley for use in the NZAVS, which provides an indicator of the income disparity within each region of New Zealand. =Data analysis= The NZAVS is a quantitative study, and data analysis for the NZAVS is conducted primarily in Mplus. Scripts outlining the statistical models developed using data from the NZAVS are provided online at the official NZAVS website. These scripts are provided to help promote research collaboration and transparency in data analysis. The study employs many different types of statistical analyses, including Latent Growth Modeling, Bayesian Linear Regression, Structural Equation Modeling, and analyses employing Mixture model and Multilevel model designs. Key findings The NZAVS has been central in answering a variety of important research questions. This section lists research findings from the NZAVS that have received academic and media attention. =Religion and the Christchurch earthquakes= NZAVS researchers Joseph Bulbulia and Chris Sibley published a study in PLoS ONE looking at how the Christchurch earthquakes may be linked to change in religious affiliation.Sibley, C. G., & Bulbulia, J. (2012). Faith after an earthquake: a longitudinal study of religion and perceived health before and after the 2011 Christchurch New Zealand earthquake. PLoS ONE, 7, e49648. =Personality in New Zealand= Data from the NZAVS has also been used to help validate and extend a public domain personality test assessing the Big-Six dimensions of personality in New Zealand. This personality scale is known as the Mini-IPIP6, and is based on the International Personality Item Pool. The Mini-IPIP6 is a 24-item self-report personality measure, which extends the original Big-Five Mini-IPIP scaleDonnellan, M.B., Frederick, L., Oswald, B.M.B, & Lucas, R.E. (2006).

The Mini-IPIP provides marker items for the following six dimensions of personality: Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, Openness to Experience, and Honesty-humility. The Mini-IPIP6 has been validated for use in New Zealand in a series of peer-reviewed publications,Sibley, C. G. (2012).

They studied Māori identity and the factors that make Māori feel positive about themselves and Māori culture. This identity scale is known as the Multi-dimensional Model of Maori Identity and Cultural Engagement (MMM-ICE) and consists of six dimensions;(1) Group Membership Evaluation, (2) Socio- Political Consciousness, (3) Cultural Efficacy and Active Identity Engagement, (4) Spirituality, (5) Interdependent Self-Concept, and (6) Authenticity Beliefs.Houkamau, C.

Latitude: 41.15056 : Longitude: -92.14111 : Elevation: 810 ft The following information comes from the book \\"Glimpses of Yesterday\\" by Dixie Richardson, published in 1999 and copied here with her permission. The book contains histories and personal memories of Richland, Iowa, and the surrounding area. Linby is located a short distance south east of Pekin in Polk Township. Linby came into existence in 1902 when surveyors who were surveying for the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad founded it. The railroad was having the area surveyed for a line they planned to run from Chicago to Kansas City. The new line ran through the farms of William Brown, Thomas Linder, and Basil Mowrey and was completed in 1903. The Burlington and Western Railway came through the area in 1882. The Burlington and Western was sold to the C. B. & Q. railroad in 1903. The Milwaukee line crossed the C. B. & Q. line on the northeast corner of William Brown's farm. Because the two railroads crossed it was necessary to build a depot. An interlocking system was installed and had to be guarded 24 hours a day. The depot was built in 1902 on ground purchased from William Brown. It was big enough to serve a town of 2500 people. It contained a waiting room and a freight room and a main office for the depot agent and operators. Frank Hoover was the first depot agent. Besides Mr. Hoover there were 3 operators each working 8 hour shifts. As many as twenty to thirty trains per day ran on the new track. A small train with an engine called the \\"Fox\\" started running on the Burlington Western track about 1892. The Fox earned its name because of its speed and, it was said by residents, that it would just slip up on you at a crossing. The Fox ran from Oskaloosa to Burlington and back each day. The little narrow gauge train consisted of an engine and tender and mail and baggage car and a smoker and day car. The little train was a familiar site on the track for 10 years. After the C. B. & Q. purchased the Burlington Northern line it wanted to run wider trains and the track was widened in 1902. The Fox could not run on the wide track so it sat on a siding for a short time and then was later taken to Colorado where it ran on a narrow gauge railroad in the Rocky Mountains near Denver. The depot was closed in 1956 because of declining business on the railroads and automatic signals had been installed. The depot was removed in 1958. The C. B. & Q. was later sold to the M. & St. L. Railroad. The M. & St. L. discontinued operation in 1971. The I. & M. Rail Link operates on the former Milwaukee line. Sometime after the depot was built a stockyard and elevator were established by A. J. Roland. Harry Mitchell of Packwood and John Smith of Linby were the stock buyers. Lafe Dudgeon and F. R. Campbell opened a general store. Other businesses were S. F. Steigleder and son. Another lumberyard operated by Harry and Kenneth Mower. This business was later destroyed by fire in 1930. Walker Rockwell was a brick mason. Rockwell and his wife also operated a boarding house. B. E. Dark operated a general store in a building, which had been moved to Linby. A millinery shop was on the top floor of the store building. Mr. and Mrs. David Smith operated a restaurant in the hotel building. Guy Black ran a hardware store above the Odd fellows Hall and a livery stable. Orb Reighard operated a blacksmith shop. The Linby post office was established in 1904. It was discontinued April 30, 1944. Dr. James Stepp came to Linby in 1915 and built a building next to the hotel and opened his medical practice there. The Linby Bank was established in 1908. It closed in 1933. Charles Linder was the first Cashier at the bank. There was also a tile factory in Linby established in 1909. The Odd Fellows Lodge The odd fellows lodge members in the area attended meetings at Linby. It was voted to move the building to Linby. The building was destroyed while being moved. A new building was built in Linby in 1917. Murder in Linby Linby was the scene of a murder in its early days. One of the storekeepers at Linby accused the barber of stealing kerosene from his store. The barber became angry at this accusation. He armed himself with a gun and went to the store to confront the storekeeper. The storekeeper was cutting a cheese with a knife and the storekeeper and the barber approached each other. The barber fired his gun injuring the storekeeper. The storekeeper stabbed the barber with the knife he had been using to cut the cheese. The barber died almost immediately. The storekeeper recovered from his wounds and was acquitted on the grounds of self-defense. Linby Baptist Church Mr. and Mrs. Theodore Kenyon felt that a church was needed at Linby as the population had grown enough to support a church. The superintendent of the railroad gave permission to have services in the depot until a church building was erected. A meeting was held in 1905 to discuss forming the Competine Mission Chapel. A committee composed of A. H. Eller, 0. 0. Phelps, and E. D. Davis was appointed to look into erecting a building. William Brown had left 2 lots in his will for a church and Mrs. Kenyon donated a lot for a church. Construction began on the church in 1905. It was dedicated on June 3, 1906. Reverend M. C. Alexander officiated at the dedication. The name of the church was officially changed to Linby First Baptist Church in 1909. It was under the leadership of the Farson church until 1910 when it requested a release from Farson. The church building was destroyed by fire on February 2, 1958. Rev Daniel P. Hill was minister at that time. A new church building was erected and church was held for the first time in the new building on March 1, 1959. Linby Baptist entered a yoke agreement with Ollie Baptist church. Rev. William Clarkson is pastor at Linby Baptist church. Education in Linby Children in the Linby area attended school at Pleasant View or Belleville schools. Dr. Stepp felt a school was needed in Linby and convinced the residents of this. A school building was erected in 1917. Students attended school at Linby until districts were reorganized. They then attended school at Packwood. All students today attend school at Pekin Community School. The size has dwindled, but the town lives on... The town of Linby was a rapidly growing little community around the turn of the century, not only because one railroad had arrived, but also the arrival of another railroad which crossed the original right-of-way. Linby has dwindled in size, but it is still a little community located in the northwest corner of Polk Township in northwest Jefferson County. The arrival of the two railroads brought a number of employees to the community and provided excellent passenger and freight service for the area. It was anticipated Linby would some day be a major town of 2,500 population or more. The first railroad to reach the community was the Burlington Western which arrived in 1882. It was a narrow gauge railroad, later sold to the Chicago, Burlington Quincy Railroad. Soon after the sale of the right-of-way it was changed to standard gauge in 1890. Land for the railroad was purchased from William Brown. Forty acres of land was laid out for the town of Linby. In 1902 the Milwaukee Railroad built a rail line from Davenport southwest to Kansas City, crossing the CB&Q; tracks at Linby. The Milwaukee built a depot at the crossing. Frank Hoover was the first agent. Because of the crossing an interlocking signal system was necessary to protect the trains, and it was necessary to have an operator on duty 24 hours a day. Three operators were hired, each working an eight-hour shift, in addition to the agent. Section crews were located at Linby by both railroads and the town began to grow rapidly, creating need for goods and living quarters. The depot was quite large, built to accommodate a number of passengers. The main office surrounded by windows commanded a view down the right-of-way of both railroads. The remainder of the building included a waiting room, baggage and freight room. Up to 20 or more trains passed through Linby including passenger trains day and night. Years later as rail business diminished the station at Linby was closed April 25, 1956, after automatic signals had been installed. The building was removed in June, 1958, and the CB&Q; Railroad ceased operations and the rails were removed in 1971. The Milwaukee line is still operating with a number of freight trains passing through each day. Only a small tool shed marks the spot where the depot once stood at the crossing. The abandoned right-of-way can still be traced by a line of trees at the location. Stories concerning Linby's past history includes a murder which took place in the early days. A storekeeper accused a barber of stealing kerosene. The barber, enraged by the accusation, went to the store armed with a gun. He found the grocer cutting cheese with a big knife. As they approached each other the barber fired, wounding the grocer twice. But the grocer kept approaching and stabbed the barber with the knife. The barber died almost instantly. The grocer was exonerated on a claim of self-defense. A leisurely stroll on the sidewalks that still line the center north-south street in Linby provided an opportunity to see where many former business establishments and homes were once located. Eunice White, a longtime resident of Linby was the guide. She and her husband both remember when Linby was a busy and growing community. Two buildings linked with the past are still standing. They are the old restaurant and hotel, and a doctor's office and home. The restaurant was operated by Mr. and Mrs. Dave Smith on the first floor, with the hotel rooms located on the second floor. Dr. James Stepp arrived in Linby and erected an office building south of the restaurant. Later he was married and living quarters were added. An early history of Linby prepared some years ago by Mrs. Ire Clingman, now deceased, said the first house was moved to Linby from the John Clingman farm which later became a boarding house. In 1902 a store building which housed the post office was erected. The Linby post office was established in 1904. The town began to grow. A. J. Roland built an elevator and stockyards. Orb Reighard operated a blacksmith shop in 1914. Harry and Kenneth Mowrey built a lumber yard which was destroyed by fire in 1930. A tile factory was constructed in 1909 from which many cement blocks and tile were shipped via the railroads. The Linby Bank was established in 1908 with Charles Linder as cashier. It closed in 1933 and the building was razed in February, 1977. A grocery store was located across the street from the hotel and restaurant. The Odd Fellows Hall was built in 1914. Guy Black operated a hardware store on the first floor with the lodge hall above. Linby had its own telephone switchboard. Other businesses established in the town during its years of growth include a pool hall, barber shop, livery stable and millinery shop. Foundations are still visible where some of the early buildings were located. New homes were built as the population increased. This brought about the need for a church. The railroad superintendent gave permission to hold services in the depot. William Brown later donated two lots on which to erect a building to house the Competine Mission Chapel. It was dedicated in June, 1906. In October, 1909, the name was changed to the First Baptist Church of Linby. It was destroyed by fire February 2, 1958. On August 6, 1958, the erection of a new building was started, with Ira Clingman as carpenter. He was assisted by men of the community who donated their labor. The first service in the new building was held March 1, 1959. The church still holds regular services each Sunday with the Rev. Larry Boatman as pastor. Mrs. White attended Sunday School in the former building and attends services in the present church. As the town grew it became evident a school was needed. Children were attending school at Belleville and Pleasant View schools. Through the efforts of Dr. Stepp, a school was erected in 1915. It served the community until the reorganization of schools in Polk Township at which time students began attending schools at Packwood. Still later the Packwood School became a part of the Pekin Community School District with elementary and high school buildings at Pekin. Roy Lewis purchased the old Linby school building and it is now an addition to his garage and filling station. While the town of Linby has dwindled in size and population, it is still home for approximately 40 persons. Barbara Hall operates a beauty parlor; and the Zepher Club organized in 1920, is still active with 17 members.

Karan Kumar, submitted an interim report on the quality and functioning of seven M.Ed. colleges during August 2012, which was unanimously accepted by the Academic Council in its meeting held on 29 August 2012. The Task Force recommended that the admission of students to all the seven M.Ed. colleges be suspended for the academic year 2012 - 2013. Also, a 205-page interim report on the quality & functioning of ninety-nine Bachelor in Education (B.Ed) colleges was submitted by the Task Force during November 2012, which was unanimously approved by both the Academic Council and the Syndicate during their meetings held on 30 November 2012, and 12 & 17 December 2012 respectively. The report recommended disaffiliation of fifty-five B.Ed colleges for gross irregularities in academic, administrative functioning and non-compliance with National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) norms. The Task Force was functional till 30 June 2013. Status of Teacher Education that led to the Constitution of Task Force  Prior to the formation of Task Force, Mr. Karan Kumar H., the Academic Council Member of Bangalore University, submitted a report on the status of teacher education under Bangalore University to the Vice Chancellor during February 2012, based on a survey conducted between December 2011 and February 2012. Apart from infrastructure flaws, the survey recorded gross non-adherence to rules concerning the way academic programmes and admissions were conducted. Also, 80 per cent of the colleges were not conducting academic programs according to procedures. After interactions with Local Inquiry Committees (LICs), it was found that neither the students nor the staff were present during the LIC's visit. In the survey period, Karan collated information from seven experts, including Dr Sameer K Simha (retired lecturer), Dr R Nagarajaiah and Dr Gururaj Karajagi (Chairperson of Academy of Creative Teaching). Constitution Former Vice-Chancellor Dr N Prabhu Dev ordered the constitution of the task force in May, following pressure from various academic quarters to fix the allegations of gross irregularities, malpractices and falling educational standards in teacher education colleges under the University. \\"The Task Force is authorised to undertake surprise inspection of the colleges to obtain first-hand information regarding the conduct of BEd and MEd courses. It may inspect admissions, attendance, appointments of teachers, internal assessment marks and other aspects,\\" the Vice-Chancellor's order stated. The academic council that met thrice in July 2012 deliberated, in detail, on LIC (Local Inquiry Committee) Reports of Academic Year 2012–13, including reports of B.Ed. Colleges. With due consent of each and every Chairperson of the LICs, the Academic Council unanimously resolved to set aside all LIC Reports of B.Ed. Colleges for deficiencies and lack of information to grant affiliation for the academic year 2012–13 (the LIC is an internal university committee that is constituted to inspect the academic viability of colleges before granting fresh/renewal of affiliations). The Academic Council also resolved unanimously to additionally request the BU Task Force to take up the responsibility of submitting its recommendations on grant of affiliation or disaffiliation to the university. For the same, it gave the Task Force 3 months time with a direction to submit its interim report on renewal of affiliation / disaffiliation of B.Ed. Colleges for the academic year 2012–13. This was followed by Karan Kumar and his team paying surprise visits to various B.Ed. and Master of Education (M.Ed.) colleges. During the course of its surprise visits, the Task Force interacted with Principals, Faculty and students of most of the colleges and video recorded the proceedings to show the abject lack of standards in the colleges that were inspected. Several instances of colleges indulging in malpractices were also exposed before the media. Interim Reports The Task Force has submitted two reports so far. In August 2012, the first report was based on seven M.Ed colleges under Bangalore University. The report was upheld in the academic council meeting, where it was decided to cancel management quota admissions in these colleges. NCTE issued show-cause notices to the colleges in September 2012. The second report is the interim report on 99 B.Ed colleges. The report, which has categorised colleges based on the level of compliance with National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) norms, has listed 23 colleges under the category of ‘colleges with gross irregularities’. Only 12 colleges are found to have satisfactory level of compliance with NCTE rules. Another 20 colleges have been recommended disaffiliation for not having NCTE recognition. The Task Force has also recommended the NCTE that it may initiate the process of withdrawal of recognition of these 55 colleges. As many as 18 colleges, on the peril in terms of compliance, have been given six months time to improve. Admissions for the year 2012-13 have been suspended in these 18 colleges. M.Ed. Interim Report=Pramble= The Academic Council unanimously resolved to accept and approve this report and it was decided to cancel the admission of students under management quota in these colleges. Six months was also given to these colleges to comply with the shortcomings as stated in the report. The High Court asked the Academic Council to take a call on the resolution passed in the council in the absence of a quorum. The order was made concerning the Academic Council meeting on 11 July where it was resolved to place all the local inquiry committee (LIC) reports dealing with BEd colleges under the purview of the task force. This meeting was attended by 32 members, short of three members for the quorum. In his defense, Task Force Chairman H Karan Kumar said that both Academic Council and Syndicate, in their meetings in March 2006, had resolved to set the quorum for Academic Council meetings as 21 members instead of 35 members according to the existing statutes. \\"The meeting in question was attended by 32 of the 42 total number members. All 32 have unanimously passed a resolution,\\" he said adding that the High Court has to be apprised of these facts. Report on Practical Examination of AY 2011-12 held from 3 September to 5 October 2012 To verify the work related to practice teaching and the conduct of practical examination, three (3) B.Ed. special squads were constituted by the Registrar (Evaluation) on 28 August 2012. As per the guidance of the Task Force, these special squads visited various B.Ed. colleges & schools attached to them for conducting practical examination between 3 September & 22 September 2012. The Task Force had two meetings with all the three squads on 15-09-2012 & 22-09-2012 and in those meetings, the squad members reported to the Task Force, several irregularities, which they found during the inspection of colleges/schools of practical examination. As a result, the Task Force decided to video record the ongoing B.Ed. practical examination & asked all three squads to have the video recording of irregularities. All three squads have video recorded many of the irregularities found in conducting practical examination (the video clippings are available with the Task Force). The squads also submitted an interim report/s to the Chairman of the Task Force. The Task Force also video recorded the opinion of the squad members. During the practical examination, on its own, the Task Force also visited a few B.Ed. colleges and recorded irregularities of B.Ed. practical examination. Based on the video evidence of the irregularities found by three special squads, the Task Force has listed 53 colleges with ‘gross irregularities’. Below are the irregularities that were reported by the squads of Bangalore University: * 1. By and large, students from outside Karnataka State have not attended the required academic program to be eligible for B.Ed. practical examination. In fact, none of them were aware of the academic program/requirements of B.Ed. education. * 2. Practical examinations were conducted without collecting examination fees from students. Even, the examination/hall tickets were not issued to the students. * 3. A lot of irregularities were found in the submission of a lesson plan by students, as nearly 75% of the students have not followed the norms of practical examination. * 4. Practical Examinations, involving students from the States like Orissa, Jharkhand, West Bengal & Bihar, have gross irregularities. * 5. Students from outside Karnataka State are attending only the practical examinations (without undergoing practice teaching & criticism lesson planning of nearly 2 months) and are heading back to their respective states, immediately after the practical examinations. Earlier, they were in Bengaluru to just attend their first semester exams during May 2012 and are coming again only to attend the second-semester theory exams during November 2012. * 6. The majority of outside Karnataka students had no communication skills to explain their lessons & none of them could speak English (although the medium of instruction is English in all B.Ed. colleges). * 7. There were cases of some B.Ed. Colleges engaging teachers, that too from other irregular colleges, as internal examiners to conduct practical examinations. * 8. Without having external examiners, practical examinations were conducted at various schools (identified for practical examinations by B.Ed. colleges & approved by BU) * 9. Very shockingly, many repeaters (of the previous years) have attended the practical examination without even paying their fee to the University and/or having the approval of the University. * 10. In all, academic records like ‘Lessons Observation Record’ of students, Teacher's Observation Diary, Lesson Plans written by the students for Methods of Teaching, Copy of the Rough Lesson Plans written by the students, Practice Teaching Time-table maintained by the College, List of Practice Teaching Schools & their address, Student Seminar Files, Criticism Lesson Plan Records, Unit Test Records, etc. were neither found nor maintained by most of the B.Ed. colleges and their students. * 11. Ultimately, outstation students are asked to come, time & again, only for theory or practical examination for a week or so every semester, and thereby, the so-called off- campus program is continued without any hesitation from many of the management of B.Ed. colleges. Now, keeping all the above observations, the BU Task Force recommends the following “Further Needful Action (FNA): * 1. Those who were absent for practical examination (as per the reports of the special squads) shall be given a chance to take-up their practical examination only during the coming academic year (AY 2012-13). Their results may be declared as ‘Failed’ for the AY 2011-12. * 2. Wherever gross irregularities are noted (in all the above listed 53 B.Ed. colleges), practical examinations shall be re-conducted, in such colleges, by appointing a panel of examiners drawn from other colleges. If needed, the authorities shall consult the Task Force in appointing a “Panel of Examiners”. * 3. The Chairperson, BOE (B.Ed.) has approved the time-table of practical examination & panel of examiners on the day of the examination itself, which is a major irregularity & the Chairperson of BOE shall be asked to explain on such approvals. * 4. As the time given by Bangalore University for getting approval of the Chairperson, BOE was 8 September 2012, all approvals of practical examinations beyond this date shall stand canceled & re-conduct of the practical examination shall be ordered. BU would wait till the task force submitted its final report in October before taking a final call A day after the B.Ed Task Force exposed how nine blacklisted colleges were allowed to conduct practical examinations, from September 3 to 22, despite not receiving clearance on the status of affiliations, Bangalore University (BU) officials said they are not ruling out disaffiliation as a disciplinary measure. To a question on what action the varsity would take, Vice-Chancellor N. Prabhu Deva said: “The only thing we can do is recommend disaffiliation. They were permitted only to hold theory exams. They were asked not to announce the results even for those.” However, he added that BU would wait until the task force submitted its final report in October before taking a final call. Meanwhile, Registrar (Evaluation) R.K. Somashekhar said these colleges would not be allowed to hold any further examinations, at least not before the task force report was placed before the Syndicate. “Until that happens, there is no question of allowing these colleges to conduct any exams,” he said. He also denied having permitted the colleges to conduct practical exams and said: “On September 10, when permission was given, I was in the U.S. It was the in-charge Registrar who signed the order. My name has been dragged in unnecessarily.” The Deccan Herald on September 26 had reported that the University officials had allowed the correction and announcement of the results of one of the blacklisted colleges. \\"Exams were held, but by mistake\\", says B’lore varsity. \\"Answer scripts of a blacklisted BEd college were evaluated and results were declared, by ‘mistake’.\\" said the Registrar (Evaluation), who has held the Chairperson of Board of Examination (BoE) responsible. However, the marks cards have not been issued, he added. With regard to the other reports that appeared in the newspaper on permitting holding practical examinations in the barred colleges, the Registrar (Evaluation) said it was allowed \\"in the light of an interim order of the High Court of Karnataka,\\" pending the Court's decisions. The Registrar, however, failed to elaborate on the interim order. The University lawyer told Deccan Herald that she is unaware of it. Reacting to the news report that the Registrar (Evaluation) had allowed nine of the 11 barred colleges to conduct practical exams in September, Somashekar denied it stating that he was in the US during the period. \\"My signatures stated to be on the documents may have been forged,\\" he said. He had also said that the Officer on Special Duty was obligated to sign on the permission letters, in his absence, as the Registrar (Administration) had initiated the permission letters. He added that he was not aware of the exams until the media reported about it. Ego clashes, corruption, and lack of stringent affiliation norms have taken the sheen off BU. Allowing barred colleges to hold exams is the latest in the saga. Controversy Representatives of BEd colleges threatening BU Task Force chairman Karan Kumar after the Academic Council meeting in Bangalore on 18 July. The B.Ed colleges under the Task Force scanner staged protests against Karan Kumar and the Task Force. The colleges alleged that the Task Force functioned in a manner that was not prescribed in its terms and conditions. General Secretary, Karnataka State Private B.Ed. College Principals and Lecturers Association, said: \\"The association rejects the report of the Task Force as it is unscientific and undemocratic. Recommending disaffiliation is one thing, but the manner in which the Task Force has carried out its study is not right. How can they trespass colleges, seize documents and approach outside regulatory bodies against the colleges?\\" After the 18 July academic council meeting, representatives of various B.Ed colleges stormed into the meeting hall and publicly threatened Karan Kumar with dire consequences. The agitating B.Ed colleges even boycotted valuation of B.Ed answer scripts, a stir that was eventually withdrawn after acting Vice- Chancellor N Rangaswamy managed to convince them to resume valuation work. Based on complaints received by students and teachers about malpractices in the second semester BEd examinations that started on 6 November 2012, the Task Force on Teacher Education did visit few theory examination centers for inspection. It identified eight examination centres for malpractices. During its visit to examination centers for inspection, Bangalore University's examination squad for the ongoing BEd theory exams has reportedly refused to cooperate with the Task Force members. Also, the squad members allegedly threatened the Task Force members of dire consequences and warned them against continuing the inspection. The Task Force has been regularly reporting to the university about the \\"fraudulent\\" BEd colleges. Karan Kumar told Deccan Herald that many of the exam squad members were from the blacklisted BEd colleges. He said he suspected foul play from the University's end in selection of members for the squad. The university has allegedly been conducting exams for students of colleges that have been derecognised by the National Council for Teachers’ Education. Students appearing for the examinations in several centres have reportedly alerted the Task Force about the rampant malpractice, including mass copying, he said. A BJP MLC and senior ABVP leader asked the government to scrap the Bangalore University B.Ed Task Force, alleging that it has been targeting and harassing a few colleges. The MLC, Prof. P.V. Krishna Bhat, wrote a letter to Legislative Council chairman D.H. Shankaramurthy, stating that he wanted to raise the issue during the monsoon session. \\"Principals of many B.Ed. colleges have told me that this task force, headed by Mr. Karan Kumar, is conducting surprise raids on private B.Ed. colleges in the city and is harassing college managements in the name of inspection. The government should interfere immediately and must put an end to this task force,\\" he states in the letter. Prof. Bhat said it is the responsibility of the Local Inquiry Committee to report any loopholes in colleges, and it is the prerogative of the BU Syndicate to act against such colleges, based on the LIC report. Mr. Bhat has alleged that the task force has no legal sanctity and is harassing the B.Ed colleges. Prof. Bhat's letter comes as a surprise to many academics, who were pressuring BU to implement the B.Ed task force report which has shed light on the corrupt practices of these colleges. \\"There may be some technical issues with the B.Ed Task Force, but it is doing a wonderful job. It has done what the Syndicate and LIC could not do for years. It is the ABVP which is in the forefront of all agitations aimed at bringing qualitative changes in the higher education sector. But no one knows why a senior ABVP leader like Prof. Bhat is opposing it,\\" said a senior faculty member of the university. Events that followed the submission of Interim Reports During its meeting on 30 November 2012, the Academic Council unanimously accepted the Interim Report of the Task Force on B.Ed. Colleges in total and resolved that the University should disaffiliate all erring colleges as per University guidelines and initiate necessary action as per recommendations of the Task Force. When the interim report was placed before the Syndicate for its ratification on 12 December 2012, it was unanimously resolved to accept the Task Force report. However, in spite of unanimously accepting the Interim Report of the Task Force on affiliation / disaffiliation of B.Ed. Colleges, the Syndicate also resolved to grant affiliation to B.Ed. colleges (irrespective of their status as per Interim Report of the Task Force), by referring to the LIC Reports that were set-aside earlier. Further, the Syndicate also granted three months' time to the erring colleges to be compliant as per the Interim Report of the Task Force. When asked by press reporters on what the fate of students will be if the colleges failed to comply within three months, acting Vice-Chancellor N Rangaswamy said, \\"Students will have to risk joining these colleges.\\" On 10 January, the Karnataka Higher Education Department intervened by issuing a show-cause notice to the University, seeking on explanation on the Syndicate resolution. Left-wing student organizations, including Student Federation of India, Vidyarthi Janata Dal, Dalit Students’ Federation, National Students’ Union of India and Democratic Youth Federation of India, have welcomed the State Government's move to question the Bangalore University (BU) Syndicate resolution on the report of the Task Force on B.Ed. colleges. BU Registrar (Administration) T D Kemparaju on 16 January submitted a four-page reply to the government's show-cause notice. \\"The Task Force report has been accepted along with the Academic Council resolutions as per Section 59(9) and (17) of the Karnataka State Universities Act, 2000. Further, as per Section 63(2), only the Syndicate has the authority to decide matters pertaining to affiliation or disaffiliation by giving an opportunity for the concerned colleges to explain. Moreover, reports or recommendations by committees constituted by lawful authorities will become the basis for such decisions. If any decision is taken based on reports submitted by committees with no legality (reference to Task Force), it can be questioned in court,\\" the reply stated. Task Force Chairman Karan Kumar termed the reply as ‘confusing, evasive and irrelevant’. Later, Bangalore University officials apologised to the Higher Education Department for providing erroneous information in response to the show-cause notice the Department had issued in regard to non- implementation of the B.Ed. Report of Task Force. Prof. Rangaswamy, acting Vice-Chancellor, claimed innocence and said whatever had happened was not his fault. He also claimed that he did not understand the High Court order and had merely acted on the advice of the University's legal advisor. \\"The order is highly confusing. We could not understand it. Even the university legal advisors did not understand it,\\" he said. However, Prof. Rangaswamy chairs both the Academic Council and Syndicate meetings, and is thus in a position to be completely aware of the proceedings in these two bodies. When asked about this, Rangaswamy said he was \\"very confused\\" and needed to go through all the documents again. Left-wing student organisations have come together to form a Progressive Student-Youth Forum to protest against the university's lack of will to implement the Task Force report. The Forum has demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the B.Ed Mafia, which is believed to have stretched across many states outside Karnataka. Notwithstanding, the Karnataka government has ordered a Criminal Investigation Department (CID) probe into B.Ed colleges affiliated to the university, which have been accused of issuing fake degree certificates to students from both within and outside the state. Government of Karnataka passed an Order [ED 300 UBV 2012], dated 12/02/2013, directing the Bangalore University to implement the Task Force Report and annulling the contrary decision of the Syndicate of granting affiliation to B.Ed & M.Ed colleges based on ‘set-aside’ reports of LICs. Further, the Principal Secretary, Higher Education, GoK wrote a letter, dated 14/03/2013, addressed to the Registrar, BU, on the progress made in implementing the Government Order [ED 300 UBV 2012] dated 12/02/2013. In the meanwhile, the National Council for Teachers’ Education (NCTE) has withdrawn the recognition to flawed M.Ed. colleges affiliated to the Bangalore University. The decision to withdraw the recognition was taken during a meeting of the Southern Regional Committee (SRC) of NCTE held between 29 March – 1 April 2013, and was based on the report of the BU Task Force.http://epapervijayavani.in/Details.aspx?id=4946&boxid;=42457296 Nearly four months after it was announced, the State Government has officially ordered a Criminal Investigation Department (CID) probe into the alleged malpractices in teacher education colleges affiliated to Bangalore University (BU). Status of Seat Matrix for B.Ed. Education There are 21,400 Government quota seats available in the State of Karnataka against the total applicants of 17,005. Again, 18,900 more seats are available in private colleges through management quota. Thereby, 40,300 B.Ed. seats are available statewide every year. Similarly, in Bangalore University, there are 5,300 Government quota seats available other than 4,600 seats under management quota. In all, 9900 seats are available under Bangalore University. But of late, only 40-50% Government seats are filled in time, leaving the rest in the hands of private managements. Thus, by obtaining permission from the Govt., these private managements bring in non-Karnataka students (mainly coming from Orissa, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Kerala and West Bengal) in a big way and offer off-campus programme. Some of these students are not able to communicate even in simple English. Since English is the official language of medium of instruction, it is astonishing how such students are admitted to the programme and eventually get their degree also. It speaks of gaping loopholes and compromises in the admission, instruction, examination and evaluation processes. Appropriate punitive and curative policy and administrative measures have to be put in place urgently. B.Ed. Final Report The Task Force submitted its Final Report, on B.Ed. Colleges, to the Vice Chancellor, Bangalore University on 27 May 2013.

He is also mentioned as the leader of summer raids into Byzantine Asia Minor in 678 and 681/682. Under Yazid I (r. 680–683) he became governor of the Jund Hims (military district of Homs), and in this capacity served in the expedition sent against the rebellion in Medina and Mecca in 683, under the command of Muslim ibn Uqba. After Muslim's death, he succeeded him in command of the campaign and laid siege to Ibn al-Zubayr in Mecca for two months. It was during this siege that the Kaaba burned down. Husayn maintained the siege for two months, until news reached him of Yazid's death. He then offered to recognize Ibn al-Zubayr as Caliph, provided that he would come to Syria, but when the latter refused, Husayn turned his army back. Back in Syria, he played an important role in securing the Umayyad family's nomination of the experienced, though elderly, Marwan ibn al-Hakam as Caliph, instead of Yazid's young son Khalid. The leading Umayyad commander, Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, then sent him to the Jazira, where, on 6 January 685, he defeated the Shi'a sect of the Penitents at the Battle of 'Ayn al-Warda. Husayn also participated in the attempted reconquest of Iraq under Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, and like him, fell at the Battle of Khazir on 5 or 6 August 686. His son, Yazid ibn Husayn, also fought for the Umayyads in the Second Civil War and served as governor of Hims for Umar II (r. 717–720), while his grandson Mu'awiya also served as governor of Hims for Yazid III (r. 743–744), but went over to Marwan II (r. 744–750) during the Third Civil War.

It was formed in 2009. As of January 2013, it owned six hotels along the East Coast and in the Deep South. The company has two subsidiaries. Capstone Management Services provides hotel management services, and Capstone Procurement provides food service and janitorial supplies for hotels. Corporate history Capstone Development was founded by Norman Jenkins in February 2009. Jenkins, a highly regarded senior vice president at Marriott International and African American, helped Marriott launch a Diversity Ownership Initiative in 2005 which worked to improve hotel franchise ownership among minorities. A year later, Jenkins oversaw a cooperative venture between Marriott and RLJ Hotels (the hotel investment operation of cable TV magnate Robert L. Johnson). The joint venture purchased 90 hotels, and left RLJ Hotels as one of Marriott's largest co-investors. Jenkins also convinced Marriott to build a Residence Inn in downtown Silver Spring, Maryland. The hotel helped revitalize Silver Spring's downtown business district.\\"Marriott Sr. VP Jenkins Forms Company.\\" Washington Business Journal. December 1, 2008. Accessed 2013-01-13.

The company said in February 2009 that it already had good relationships with banks willing to give it development loans. Capstone's strategy is to acquire or build hotels in the mid-Atlantic region in the United States. Company executives say their strategy is to focus on specialty hotels, hotels in markets that have high barriers to entry, and hotels that are market leaders. The company also said it would engage in public-private finance and development partnerships, as Jenkins had extensive experience in that area. At the time it formed, Capstone Development executives said they already had five projects in development and another four in the development planning stage. Some of these were public- private developments. Projects Capstone Development has several projects which are already finished or under construction.

Plot  Mason Crane, a one- handed man who went on a murderous rampage after committing familicide, is set to be moved from one section of a Woodland Heights psychiatric hospital to another. As soon as Mason's cell is opened, the deranged man crushes an orderly with the door, cuts another's skullcap off with a clipboard, and escapes. Mason makes his way to a wilderness-adjacent home, where he kills a dog, and replaces his missing hand with a bent two-pronged grilling fork. With his new weapon, Mason attacks a group of children playing in a cemetery, stabbing one to death, and scattering the rest. Mason returns to the woods, where a young couple (Tommy and Katie) have set up at a cottage for some alone time. Nervous due to all the news reports about Mason's escape, Katie convinces Tommy to take her back into town, but the car fails to start. Tommy goes off alone to seek help from a friend named Jimmy who lives nearby, and encounters Mason, who has disemboweled Jimmy. Tommy and Mason fight, with Mason coming out victorious when he stabs Tommy in the crotch. Next, Mason goes after Katie, chasing her through the forest, and into town. Just as Mason is about to kill Katie, he is shot in the head by a bystander. The film is then revealed to just be a story being told to a group of Cub Scouts. When the storyteller asks the boys if they believe the ghost of Mason Crane still haunts the town, they answer with \\"No!\\" The man laughs, turns to the camera (revealing himself to be Mason) and screams, \\"I do!\\"  Cast  * Robert W.

The parish of Glamoč is restored as an independent chaplaincy in 1864, and in 1872 it became a parish again. The first parish church of Saint Elias in Glamoč was built in 1903. The church was looted and burned down during World War II and rebuilt in 1969. As part of the inter-ethnic Bosnian war, Serb soldiers mined and destroyed the church and rectory in 1992. The new rectory was built in 1997 and until 2009 it served as a place for the celebration of the liturgy. The building of the present church started in 2001 near the ruins of the old church. Three church bells, cast in the Grassmayr foundry in Innsbruck, were blessed and placed on the bell tower on 21 December 2005. The biggest bell weighs 542 kg and is dedicated to the Queen of Croats. The bell dedicated to saint John the Baptist weighs 348 kg and one dedicated to saint Elias weighs 260 kg. The church was consecrated by bishop Franjo Komarica on 15 November 2014.

Originally build as a cargo/passenger liner for the Grace Line, it was later converted to a training vessel for the Massachusetts Maritime Academy. Early years Santa Mercedes was built by Bethlehem Steel at its Sparrows Point Shipyard and delivered to the Grace Lines as the last of four cargo/passenger vessels intended to modernize its fleet. These \\"M\\" ships also included Santa Magdalena, Santa Mariana, and Santa Maria, and carried up to 125 passengers as well as various break-bulk and container cargo. Santa Mercedes traveled between New York City and the west coast of South America. Due to political instability in South America and depreciating currencies in the region, the shipping service was sold to Prudential Lines in 1969, which operated until 1977 when it sold its assets to Delta Line. Shortly afterwards, all four ships in the class were sold to the Maritime Administration, and in 1984 the Santa Mercedes was laid up James River, Virginia as part of the Maritime Administration's National Defense Reserve Fleet. Government service The Massachusetts Maritime Academy acquired the vessel in 1984 and renamed it Patriot State. It was converted to a training vessel in two stages by the Triple A Shipyard in San Francisco, California and Bender Shipyard in Mobile, Alabama. The cargo handling gear was removed, except for the forward yard and stay rig, and teaching facilities installed. Patriot State entered service as a training ship in the Spring of 1986. Fourteen training cruises from 1986–98, typically lasting around sixty days during the winter, were used to provide cadets with practical experience. Over the ship's service, various improvements were made to the berthing spaces, and controlled superheaters were installed on the boilers to increase the top safe speed of the ship. In 1998, ultrasonic surveys determined that extensive corrosion in the hull and bulkheads had compromised the seaworthiness of the ship. Extensive repairs would have been necessary, so large portions of its propulsion system were removed by MMA cadets for use as static training aids. The Patriot State was laid up in the James River, Virginia as part of the Maritime Administrations National Defense Reserve Fleet. In 2001, the Cape Bon was moved to Buzzards Bay, MA for preparation to replace TS Patriot State as the Training Ship for the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, and is now in service as TS Kennedy. Patriot State continued to be used by various law enforcement and military services for close-quarter counter-terrorist training exercises while berthed in the James River Reserve Fleet. In 2011 the vessel was formally withdrawn from service and was towed to a scrapyard in Brownsville, Texas. ReferencesExternal links *MARAD Status page * T.S.

The name Jungle is derived from the vast plantation of Salt cedar (Tamarix ramosissima) shrub or small tree typically growing 6-15’ tall that were planted there post independence by the British Forces at that time to camouflage the military airstrip that was built near to, what is now Khamat Killi (remnants of which can still be seen adjacent to this village). This habitation of Salt cedar trees were uprooted and totally destroyed by the Afghan refugees (that camped on the outskirts of these villages during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan) in need of wood for fire to protect themselves from the harsh winter nights, whereas the bricks and stones used in the construction of the airstrip and its buildings were removed over the years and used by the villagers and the refugees in their homes. A portion of these Salt cedar trees has survived near to Khamat Killi and is pruned every year to make wood for fire during winter. Jungle Piralizai is composed of four villages Qutub Killi, Khojdad Killi, Majeryaan/Momin Killi and Khamat Killi including Shamir Killi (nickname Nika Killi). Jungle Piralizai is a part of other Piralizai villages located to the North 15 km away and comprises three villages: Arambi, Shah Killi, Killi Usman Achakzai (called \\"Shom\\"). Piralizai villages are headed by Malik Fareed Ahmad Khan Achakzai who was elected Malik (meaning elder of the tribe) after the demise of Malik Mohammad Yousuf. The Piralizai's are an ethnic group belonging to the Pashtun sub-tribe Achakzai. Members of this group usually use Piralizai or Achakzai as their title or last name. Piralizai's are the descendants of the Durrani, Zirak and Achakzai tribes. The inhabitants of Jungle Piralizai are mostly farmers and shop keepers, whereas some travel to large cities in search of employment. The people lead a simple and hard life. A bit of development work has been done due to which there is a middle school plus one Madrassah located in Qutub Killi. In addition a government hospital, a veterinary hospital and a girls school is under construction. Jungle Piralizai was home to more than a 100,000 Afghan refugees during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, that had camped on the outskirts of the village close to the main Quetta Chaman Highway. Presently the refugee camp is still existent but the number of refugees has by far dwindled to a minimal size, as most of them either migrated back to Afghanistan or to other cities in Pakistan in search of better living standards. In the past, Jungle piralizai comprised a small number of houses with no proper roads, water or electricity, hospital except one primary school built during the times of President Ayub Khan. Wheat was grown annually and people lived a life of hardships. Drinking water was salty and scarce. There were no health facilities and people travelled on donkey to the main Quetta Chaman highway, to wait for hours to take a bus to travel to Quetta to address their medical needs. The only road available was built by the British that linked Quetta to Chaman bordering Afghanistan. People never ventured after dark and lit fires to keep themselves warm. Many attended to their herds of Camels, Goats and Sheep and cared less about the outside world. Their staple diet included hand made bread (Dodi) boiled Meat (Shorwa) and butter milk (Sholumbay). Landi, dried meat, is commonly used during winter. It is generally made of mutton or goat meat. Sheep are specially fattened and slaughtered. The animal is thoroughly cleaned and then it is salted and some special ingredients are rubbed in it. The animal is hanged and exposed to the air and is ready for use after one month. When required for eating, it is boiled for 5 hours in an earthen pot over a slow fire. It is normally eaten when it is extremely cold. Tea especially Green (Shnay chai) was and is still taken during winter and black tea (slaymani chai) during the summer. The majority of the male population wear turban, shalwar and kameez, both in winter and summer. A Patu (piece of cloth) is always lying on their shoulders in both seasons. Women wore a long dress with beautiful embroidery on the bosom, sleeves and edges of the dress usually hand made. They also wore a shawl over their heads as they observed purdah. The women in particular used to knit their hair in thin plaits and added a gum base to stick them together. This basic style of the dress is however changing, with the spread of development and growing prosperity, dresses have become somewhat modernised. Women usually weave caps with beautiful embroidery on them for their male folk and also plait beautiful naras or nadas (string used for tying the shalwar)woven with wool and colorful threads which are given at times of EID. Eggs are also collected by the women folk which are boiled and colored and given to children and youngsters for Eid festivities. People were happy with their simple way of life. With the passage of time these small villages grew into larger ones, bringing changes in the lives and improved the way of living of the people.

Historically in Worcestershire, it is the next suburb south from Moseley on the A435, Alcester road. History Kings Heath came into being as a village in the 18th century when improvements to the Alcester to Birmingham road acted as a catalyst for the development of new houses and farms. Prior to this, the area was largely uninhabited wasteland run by the Royal Borough of Kings Norton. The streets running off High Street are dominated by pre-1919 terraced, owner- occupied housing. A number of independent shops have taken advantage of comparatively cheap rents in the side roads off High Street, leading to an influx of boutiques and the start of an (organic) café culture. In 2008, the businesses agreed to establish a Business Improvement District, which top- slices a proportion of their local business taxes to go directly into improvements and promotion of the area. The local community still refers to Kings Heath as a \\"village\\" even though it has been part of Birmingham for over a century. Its centre at the High Street / Vicarage Road junction has been developed to form an attractive public square which is used as a venue for a monthly farmers' market and other events. On 28 July 2005, Kings Heath was hit by a major (by European standards) tornado which damaged several shops on High Street and All Saints' Church. The tornado then moved on to damage many houses in Balsall Heath. There were no fatalities. Education Kings Heath Police Station Kings Heath has several schools including Colmore Infant, Nursery and Primary School, St. Dunstan's Catholic Primary School, Kings Heath Primary School, Kings Heath Boys, Wheelers Lane Technology College, King Edward VI Camp Hill School for Boys, King Edward VI Camp Hill School for Girls and Bishop Challoner Catholic College. Public transport Kings Heath is serviced by National Express West Midlands' bus routes 11 (Birmingham Outer Circle), 35 (central Birmingham – Hawkesley), 50 (central Birmingham – Druids Heath) and 76 (Solihull - Northfield). Features The central shopping area runs along High Street and Alcester Road, and the shops include branches of national chain stores, charity shops, supermarkets, electrical retailers and opticians. There are also a number of pubs, churches and schools on and around High Street. Plaque marking UB40's first gig. Kings Heath has two parks: Kings Heath Park, which is famous as the setting for the popular ATV series Gardening Today, and Highbury Park, which is adjacent to Highbury Hall, a former residence of Joseph Chamberlain. Kings Heath Park has \\"Green Flag\\" status. It features a Victorian-styled tea room and is the venue for the annual Gardener's Weekend Show, which comes under the Royal Horticultural Society and is one of the top regional events for gardening enthusiasts to show off their vegetables, floral displays, etc. The Hare and Hounds public house, in Kings Heath High Street, was the location of the first concert by UB40 on 9 February 1979, which is commemorated by a PRS for Music plaque. The pub was rebuilt in 1907, but is Grade II listed, as it has retained many original Art Nouveau internal fixtures. The pub is still an important local music venue. Sport and leisure Kings Heath Stadium was a greyhound track that existed from the 1920s until its closure in 1971. The site was first developed in 1923 at Alcester Lane's End on the southern outskirts of Kings Heath as the venue for the annual Kings Heath Horse Show. The ground was converted to include a greyhound track and the first dog race took place in May 1927. After the Horse Show moved elsewhere in the 1960s, the ground was exclusively used for greyhound racing until being permanently closed in 1971. The land was eventually sold for housing development. An 18-hole golf course opened in 1926 just to the south of the race track along the Alcester Road. This is also the site of the modern Cocks Moors Woods sports and leisure centre, the largest of its kind in south Birmingham. Kings Heath Baths was an indoor facility on Institute Road that first opened on 15 August 1923. For many years, the swimming pool was drained and floored over during the winter so it could be used as a dance hall, with additional badminton courts also provided. The baths closed in 1987 and the building was subsequently demolished. The Kingsway Cinema opened on High Street in March 1925 and remained open for more than fifty years until its closure in May 1980. The cinema was later converted into a bingo hall, first run by Essoldo Bingo, then Gala Bingo, but eventually closed in 2007. The building was largely destroyed by a fire on 17 September 2011. It was auctioned off in 2016 to a local building development company and demolition work was carried out at the rear of the building in early 2018. The Grade A locally listed facade at the front was largely unaffected by the 2011 fire and the redevelopment plans include restoring this to its former glory.

For example, Diana Rowden, a war hero, was described at the time as \\"very good in field craft and excellent with guns”.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/29/awful-fate-betrayed- volunteer-operated-behind-enemy-lines-france/ Field skills include camouflage, land and water navigation, understanding the difference between concealment from view and cover from small arms' fire, using the terrain and its features to mask ground movement, obstacle crossing, selecting good firing positions, lying-up positions, camping positions, effective observation, camouflage penetration, countersurveillance, detecting enemy-fire directionality and range, survival, evasion, and escape techniques. Good fieldcraft is especially important for the effectiveness and survival of infantry soldiers, snipers, special forces, reconnaissance and sabotage teams. Efficient fieldcraft is only possible by spending time, effort, and attention to memorizing battlefield details, infiltration and escape routes, construction and employment of hiding positions, enemy force doctrines and equipment.

The main library is on the Oxford Road campus of the university, with its entrance on Burlington Street. There are also ten other library sites, eight spread out across the University's campus, plus The John Rylands Library on Deansgate and the Ahmed Iqbal Ullah Race Relations Resource Centre situated inside Manchester Central Library. In 1851 the library of Owens College was established at Cobden House on Quay Street, Manchester. This later became the Manchester University Library (of the Victoria University of Manchester) in 1904. In July 1972 this library merged with the John Rylands Library to become the John Rylands University Library of Manchester (JRULM).Guardian, The (London); 20 July 1972Manchester Evening News; 19 July 1972 On 1 October 2004 the library of the Victoria University of Manchester merged with the Joule Library of UMIST forming the John Rylands University Library (JRUL). The Joule Library was the successor of the library of the Manchester Mechanics' Institute (established in 1824) which later became the library of the University of Manchester Institute of Science & Technology (UMIST). One of the Institute's first actions was to establish a library, with a full-time librarian, at premises in King St., Manchester. The library changed its name in the summer of 2012 to become The University of Manchester Library. The library is one of only five National Research Libraries – an award of the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), and the only one in the north of England. It is a member of the North West Academic Libraries consortium (NoWAL) and of Research Libraries UK consortium (RLUK). RLUK was formerly the Consortium of University Research Libraries (CURL) of which the library was a founder member in the 1980s. The present University Librarian and Director, Christopher Pressler, is assisted by an executive team of one archivist and three librarians.Executive team; accessed 2020-08-21 Contents The library has the largest non-legal deposit academic collection in the United Kingdom,SCONUL Annual Library Statistics 2005–2006 the largest collection of electronic resources of any library in the UK and supports all subject areas taught by the University. The library provides its members with a range of services and materials, including an extensive collection of electronic resources. A range of services is provided for members of the public and schools. Library buildings The main building is on Burlington Street, west of Oxford Road: (building no. 55 on the University's Campus Guide): its oldest part is the east wing built in 1936: it was extended by south and west wings in 1953–56 and by the Muriel Stott Hall in 1978. Until 1965 it was known as the Arts Library. The Christie Building contained the library's scientific section and the medical library was in a separate building until 1981. An extension to the north designed by architects Dane, Scherrer & Hicks opened in 1981. (It had been designed in 1972 as the first instalment of a larger building.) The University of Manchester Library has a number of site libraries in other university buildings, including the Eddie Davies Library in the Manchester Business School, the Joule Library in the Sackville Street Building, the Stopford Library in the Stopford Building and the Lenagan Library in the School of Music and Drama. Notable collections housed in the main library are the Guardian Archives, the Manchester Collection of local medical history, maps and plans, and the Christian Brethren Archive. For many years the main library housed the offices of the Manchester Medical Society which had accommodation in the University since 1874. Between summer 2009 and January 2010 part of the ground floor of the main library was refurbished. History=1824 – 1851= The library is made up of collections brought together on various occasions: These are the library of the Manchester Mechanics' Institute, established in 1824; the library of the Manchester Medical Society, established in 1834; the library of the Manchester Royal Infirmary from the 1750s to the late 19th century; and the Radford Library from Saint Mary's Hospital, Manchester (early obstetrical and gynaecological literature collected by surgeon Thomas Radford).The Book of Manchester and Salford; for the British Medical Association. Manchester: George Falkner & Sons, 1929; pp. 229–232 (The two latter collections were donated to the Medical Library in 1917 and 1927 respectively.) The library of the Manchester Mechanics' Institute was the original library which eventually became the UMIST Library (Joule Library) which was merged with the John Rylands University Library in October 2004. = 1851–1936 = The first home of the Medical School in Coupland Street, Chorlton on Medlock (as seen in 1908 looking west)The part in the foreground is the extension of 1894, to the left is the part added in 1883, further left the original building of 1874 (mostly out of view) The medical library was accommodated here, 1874–1981 Owens College was founded in 1851 and the college library began with donations from James Heywood (1,200 volumes) and Dr William Charles Henry in the first year. The first large addition to stock was the library of James Prince Lee, bishop of Manchester, 7,000 volumes in 1869 and then a further instalment. The collection contained theology, church history and fine art. Over the following 30 years, many additions were made such as the personal libraries of E. A. Freeman (6,000 volumes) and Robert Angus Smith (4,000 volumes).The Book of Manchester and Salford; for the British Medical Association. Manchester: George Falkner & Sons, 1929; pp. 73-75 In 1904 the Owens College Library became the Manchester University Library when the college merged with the Victoria University of Manchester which had been so named in 1903. The library had three locations in its early years, Cobden's House on Quay Street, the John Owens Building between 1873 and 1898 and the Christie Building from autumn 1898. From 1903 the librarian (Charles Leigh) improved the administration of the library by introducing the Dewey Decimal Classification and higher cataloguing standards. On the death of Richard Copley Christie the library received his personal library of over 8,000 volumes including many rare books from the Renaissance period. By 1933 the Christie Library's stock amounted to 256,000 volumes.Victoria University of Manchester; Calendar 1933-34; Internet Archive In 1936 the library was divided into two when the Arts Library opened on Lime Grove. Thereafter the Christie Building contained only scientific and technical literature. The medical school had its own library founded in 1834 as the library of the Manchester Medical Society accommodated in Owens College once the Medical School was established there in 1874 and on its centenary in 1934 was enriched by the Manchester Collection of Dr E. Bosdin Leech relating to the medical history of the Manchester district. From 1919 the Deaf Education collection was established and was significantly enlarged by Abraham Farrar's bequest.Tyson, Moses (1937)Leigh, Charles W. E. (ed.)

Manchester: University Press = 1936– =Moses Tyson For the first thirty years of this period the librarian was Dr Moses Tyson (1897–1969) who had previously been keeper of western manuscripts at the John Rylands Library in Manchester. He was a historian and the first Librarian to be a member of the University Senate. The building of a new Arts Library meant that the stock had to be divided into two groups of subjects: arts and social sciences, and science and technology. The latter subjects remained in the original Christie Library though in areas of overlap there was some duplicating of entries in the library catalogues to assist the readers. By the early 1950s the stock had grown to such a size that the arts library building needed to be extended. This had been foreseen by the architects and once funds were available the building of two new wings in a similar style was undertaken between 1953 and 1957 (however the pattern of reading and stack rooms in the three wings is not the same). Features such as an exhibition hall and a department of special collections were included in the design together with improvements in the administrative accommodation. New departments had been established in the university by this time and these meant that the library extended its coverage in areas such as American studies, history of art, music and Near Eastern studies. Frederick Ratcliffe to Christopher Pressler  After Dr Tyson's retirement in 1965 Dr F. W. Ratcliffe was appointed librarian and a period of further expansion followed which included an ambitious acquisitions policy, the beginnings of library computerisation and better liaison with the academic departments. He had a major role, with Sir William Mansfield Cooper, the vice-chancellor until 1970, in the successful merger of the John Rylands Library with the Manchester University Library on 19 July 1972. An additional extension was planned about this time though it was not built until eight years later as funding was not then available. The extension was planned as a rectangular block, in two unequal parts (the second part was never built). Before the extension could be built congestion in the library building had to be alleviated by moving some stock to other locations on the campus. The benefaction of Miss Muriel Stott, an honorary governor of the John Rylands Library, enabled the building of a tent-like octagonal hall next to the library, the Muriel Stott Conference Centre (on the building of the extension this was enclosed by the rest of the library). The design of the extension was modified when actually implemented in 1979 so that a link section united it with the three-wing existing library building. This new extension opened in the autumn term of 1981 and at the same time the medical and science (Christie) libraries were vacated so that a more coherent organisation of stock became possible.The official opening was performed by HM Queen Elizabeth II in June 1982 (recorded on a plaque by the Main Library entrance). By the time this building opened Dr Ratcliffe had left to be the University Librarian at Cambridge. Ratcliffe was succeeded in 1981 by Dr Michael Pegg, formerly Librarian of the University of Birmingham, who remained until he resigned on grounds of ill health in 1991. He was followed by Christopher J. Hunt (formerly Social Sciences sub-librarian at Manchester) who later became university librarian of James Cook University, Townsville, Queensland, and of La Trobe University, both in Australia, and, after returning to the UK, librarian of the British Library of Political and Economic Science, London.Who's Who; \\"Hunt, Christopher John\\" On Mr Hunt's retirement, William G. Simpson, librarian of Trinity College, Dublin, was appointed. Mr Simpson had previously been Acting Deputy Librarian of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester until 1985 and subsequently university librarian of the Universities of London and Surrey. Mr. Simpson remained until his retirement in December 2007. During the period 2004–07 a major refurbishment of the historic John Rylands Library in the centre of Manchester, together with the construction of new visitor centre, was completed, whilst the Library as a whole merged with the libraries of UMIST and the Manchester Business School to create The John Rylands University Library, University of Manchester.

An ethnic Pashtun, he was the second child and eldest son of Ahmad Shah Durrani. Early life Timur Shah was born in 1748, in Mashhad, and had a quick rise to power by marrying the daughter of the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II. =Victory of Punjab= Coin of Timur Shah Durrani as Nizam of the Punjab, minted in Lahore, dated 1757/8 He received the city of Sirhind as a wedding gift and was later made the Governor of Punjab, Kashmir and the Sirhind district in 1757 (when he was only 9 years old), by his father Ahmad Shah Durrani for one year, from May 1757 until April 1758. Ahmad Shah Durrani had immediately appointed Toryal Khan Afridi, the eldest son of his army's commander and his most trustworty soldier Awalmir Khan Afridi to teach horseback riding and swordsmanship to Timur Shah Durrani. Toryal Khan Afridi also had the responsibility for safety & protection of Timur Shah Durrani so he used to stay with Timur Shah Durrani round the clock in the royal palace. Timur Shah Durrani was later defeated by the Baba Deep Singh in the Battle of Gohalwar (Amritsar,1757). The Sikhs, also assisted by Adina Beg Khan, Governor of the Julundur Doab, along with Raghunath Rao who was leading the Maratha Empire, forced Timur Shah and Jahan from Punjab and put in place their own government under Adina. =Heir of the Abdali Durrani dynasty= When Timur Shah Abdali succeeded his father in 1772, Like his father he secured Afghanistan. He was noted for his use of the Bala Hisar Fort in Peshawar, as the winter capital of the Durrani EmpireCaroe, Olaf (1957) The Pathans. Reforms During his reign, he shifted the capital from Kandahar to Kabul and chose Peshawar as the winter capital in 1776. His court remained influenced by Persian culture and he became reliant on the Qizilbash bodyguard for his personal protection. Expulsion of Abdul Qadir Khan Durrani In 1776, Timur Shah compelled his uncle Abdul Qadir Khan Durrani to leave Afghanistan. Abdul left Afghanistan and sent his family including his: wife Zarnaab Bibi, sisters Azer Khela and Unaar Khela, brother Saifullah Khan Durrani, nephews Mohammad Umer Durrani, Basheer Ahmad Khan Durrani and Shams ur Rehman Durrani and two sons, Faizullah Khan Durrani and Abdullah Khan Durrani to Akora Khattak, in present-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He himself went to Damascus (Syria), where he (Abdul Qadir Khan Durrani) died in 1781. Permanent Loss of Territories He secured Multan from the Sikhs in 1780, his forces then defeated the Sikhs at Rohtas, he then secured Bhawalpur and Kashmir. Attempts to rescue Shah Alam II By 1788 he even attempted unsuccessfully to ford the plains of Punjab to rescue his brother-in-law the emperor Shah Alam II who was blinded by a eunuch Ghulam Qadir, unable to succeed he wrote a letter to Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis, requesting that the British protect the Mughal dynasty. Personal life Timur Shah himself left twenty-four sons,William Dalrymple Return of a King: The Battle for Afghanistan pp 9 Bloomsbury Publishing, 4 Feb. 2013 and the succession struggle that followed his death began the process of undermining the authority of the Durrani authority. Under Timur Shah's eventual successor, Zaman Shah Durrani, the empire disintegrated. In 1797 Shah Zaman, like his father and grandfather before him, decided to revive his fortunes and fill his treasuries by ordering a full-scale invasion of Hindustan, the time-honoured Afghan solution to cash crises. Timur Shah prided himself on being a man of taste. He revived the formal gardens of the Bala Hisar Fort in Kabul, first constructed by Shah Jahan's Governor of Kabul. In this endeavour, he was inspired by his senior wife, Gauhar-un-Nissa Begum, a Mughal princess, the daughter of Emperor Alamgir II, who had grown up in the Delhi Red Fort with its remarkable courtyard. Furthermore, like his Mughal in-laws, he had a talent for dazzling display, such as in the way he dressed and groomed himself. The conflict between his sons Mahmud Shah Durrani, Zaman Shah Durrani, and Shah Shujah Durrani continued after his death. Death and Legacy Timur Shah died in 1793 and was succeeded by his fifth son, Zaman Shah Durrani. His tomb is located in Kabul.

The station was opened on 1 October 1973, on the \\"ligne de St-Germain\\" connecting Auber and Saint-Germain. Currently, it is the westernmost station of the central section of RER A line. Line A splits here further to the west, into A1 (to Saint- Germain-en-Laye) and A3+A5 (to Cergy-le-Haut and Poissy). Station Nanterre-Préfecture is an underground station located close to the prefecture of the department of Hauts-de-Seine, hence the name. The central part of RER A, as well as A1 to Germaine-en-Laye, are operated by RATP. The branches A3 to Cergy and A5 to Poissy are operated by SNCF. The station has the central platform, where trains depart to the center of Paris, and two side platforms, one for A1 and one for A3/A5. History In 1965, following the extension of the agglomeration far beyond the city limits of Paris, RATP and SNCF came out with the plan of the transport network development, which, in particular, included the development of RER. In 1969, RATP bought from SNCF the railway connecting Boisy-Saint-Léger and Bastille and built a stretch between Bastille and Nation. On 14 December the new line (RER) started operation. On 21 January 1970, RATP bought a railway line between Gare Saint-Lazare and Saint-Germain- en-Laye (\\"ligne de St-Germain\\"). On 1 October 1972, the service started between Auber and Saint-Germain-en-Laye. This stretch was not yet connected to the eastern part of RER A. In October 1973 the station of Nanterre-Préfecture was open in the existing tunnel and started operation. On 9 December 1977, the western and the eastern stretches were connected, and thus Nanterre-Préfecture was placed on RER A line. On 29 May 1988, service in the direction of Cergy started.  Service  The trains depart with the following frequency: * towards Saint-Germain-en-Laye: 1 train every 10 minutes in off-peak times, 12 trains/hour during peak hours and 1 train every 15 minutes in the evening; * towards Poissy: 1 train every 20 minutes in off-peak times, 6 trains/hour during peak hours and a train every 30 minutes in the evening; * towards Cergy-le-Haut: 1 train every 10 minutes in off-peak times and in the peak hours (except in the evening), 1 train every 20 minutes on Saturdays and Sundays (except in the evening) and 1 train every 30 minutes every day in the evening; * towards Paris, Boissy-Saint-Léger, and Marne-la-Vallée – Chessy: 15 trains per hour in off-peak times and 18 trains/hour during peak hours (except in the evening), 12 trains/hour on Saturdays and Sundays (except in the evening), 8 trains/hour every day in the evening. Passenger traffic More than 21,000 passengers daily used the station as of 2011. The number of passengers was predicted to increase to 25,000 by 2012, because of the construction around the station with the goal of improving its accessibility.

Red Swoosh software took advantage of increased bandwidth efficiency on the Internet to allow users to transfer and trade large media files, including music files and videos. The company also received help from former Scour employees.

Camp, co-founder of StumbleUpon, spent $800 hiring a private driver with friends and had been mulling over ways to decrease the cost of black car services (meaning, taxis that are dispatched by a central service rather than hailed directly on the street) ever since. He realized that sharing the cost with people could make it affordable, and his idea morphed into Uber. \\"Garrett is the guy who invented that\\", Kalanick said at an early Uber event in San Francisco. The first prototype was built by Camp, and his friends, Oscar Salazar and Conrad Whelan, with Kalanick being brought on as a \\"mega advisor\\" to the company. In October 2010, Kalanick succeeded Ryan Graves as CEO, who had held the position for ten months. On June 13, 2017, it was announced that Kalanick would take an indefinite leave of absence from Uber. His responsibilities would be assumed by his direct reports in the organization. On June 20, 2017, Kalanick resigned as CEO after 5 major investors, including Benchmark Capital, reportedly demanded his resignation. Despite his resignation, Kalanick was to retain his seat on Uber's board of directors. Dara Khosrowshahi took his position of CEO in August 2017. On December 24, 2019 Kalanick announced his resignation from the Board effective December 31, 2019. In the weeks leading up to this announcement Kalanick sold off more than $2.5 billion of Uber stock holding which was about 90% of his shares.  Economic advisor to President Trump  Despite CTO Thuan Pham's 2016 internal email to employees commenting, \\"I will not even utter the name of this deplorable person because I do not accept him as my leader\\" on the election of U.S. President Donald Trump, which was widely circulated and published by the media, in December 2016, it was announced that Kalanick joined other CEOs, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, General Motors CEO Mary Barra, Disney CEO Bob Iger, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, and former General Electric CEO Jack Welch, as an economic advisor on Trump's Strategy and Policy Forum, organized by Blackstone's Stephen Schwarzman. Kalanick vocally opposed President Trump's executive order banning travel from select countries and believed that remaining on Trump's advisory council would provide him with the opportunity to directly address his concerns with the President and advocate for immigrants. In an Uber blog post, Kalanick stated that he wanted to use his position on the council to \\"give citizens a voice, a seat at the table.\\" However, after continued pressure, Kalanick announced in an email to Uber employees that he would step down from the council.  Sexual harassment allegations  In 2017, it was reported that Kalanick had knowledge of sexual harassment allegations at Uber and did nothing. In the same week, he asked his direct report, Uber's SVP of Engineering Amit Singhal, to resign after a month for failing to disclose a sexual harassment claim during Singhal's 15 years as VP of Google Search, after Recode reported about it in media. According to Reuters, Kalanick has \\"a reputation as an abrasive leader\\". In February 2017, a video was released where Kalanick was shimmying between two women in an UberBLACK, before arguing with an Uber driver during a heated debate in which he berated the driver. In March 2017, Uber VP of Business, Emil Michael contacted Kalanick's ex-girlfriend in an attempt to silence her into hiding an HR complaint. This backfired, with her speaking to The Information as a source present during an executive team outing with Kalanick, where Michael and four more Uber managers selected numbered women at a Korean escort bar, prompting a complaint one year later, by the female manager who attended. She also has since spoken to Businessweek about Uber's India rape case. On June 21, 2017, he stepped down as the CEO of Uber. = Benchmark controversy = On August 10, 2017, Axios reported that Benchmark was suing Kalanick for \\"fraud, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty.\\" The suit is based on Uber's decision to expand the number of board seats, with Benchmark arguing the decision is invalid due to withholding of material information prior to the vote. The lawsuit was very controversial in Silicon Valley because of the relationship between the founder and the investor. The court ruled in the favor of Kalanick to move the case to arbitration on August 30. In response to the court ruling Kalanick released a public statement: > Pleased that the court has ruled in his favor today and remains confident > that he will prevail in the arbitration process. Benchmark's false > allegations are wholly without merit and have unnecessarily harmed Uber and > its shareholders. In January 2018, Benchmark dropped the lawsuit against Kalanick. The investment firm agreed to drop the lawsuit if Uber completed its transaction with Softbank, a prior condition Benchmark had agreed to. Completed in early January, Uber agreed to sell a sizable stake to SoftBank. The share purchase valued Uber at $48 billion. = Venture fund 10100 (2018–present) = On March 7, 2018, Kalanick announced via his Twitter account that he would start a venture fund, 10100 (pronounced 'ten-one-hundred'), focused on job growth.https://twitter.com/travisk/status/971523241633370112 The fund is likely named after the address of his childhood home. The fund is going to tackle large scale employment opportunities by investing in e-commerce, innovation and real estate in emerging markets like China and India. = City Storage Systems = Shortly after the announcement of his venture fund, Kalanick announced that he had invested $150 million in City Storage Systems (CSS), a company focussed on the redevelopment of distressed real estate assets particularly, parking, retail and industrial lots. Kalanick announced that he would serve as its CEO. CSS, previously called Delta Gamma Bravo Holdings, was a business vehicle of Kalanick's friend Diego Berdakin and has previously raised capital from Social Capital. CSS is an LLC based in Los Angeles. To capitalize on the rapid growth of prepared-food delivery sector, in June 2018, City Storage Systems, took controlling interest in U.K.-based FoodStars, a \\"dark kitchens\\" start-up with over 100 locations throughout the London metropolitan area. Dark kitchens, also known as ghost kitchens, are purpose built facilities that are leased to restaurants to prepare food for delivery, off-site from their full-service/walk-in location. Ghost kitchens also allow \\"virtual restaurants\\" (those with no full-service location) to launch brands and offer delivery-only service. City Storage Systems ghost kitchen business operates under the name CloudKitchens. In November 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported that Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund completed an agreement with CloudKitchens in January 2019 to invest $400 million in the company. Kalanick himself has invested $300 million in the startup. On July 13, 2020, Northwest Industrial Logistics Pte Limited, a Singapore-based holding company associated with Kalanick's City Storage Systems set up a new company headquartered in New Delhi, India. As of October 2020, CSS's portfolio of U.S. properties included locations in nearly two dozen cities, including Portland OR, Las Vegas, Miami, Queens NY, Memphis, and Seattle. = Corporate Advisor = Kalanick serves on an advisory board for Neom, Saudi Arabia’s plan to build a futuristic \\"mega city\\" in the desert.  Personal life  Kalanick owns a townhouse in the upper hills of San Francisco's Castro neighborhood, which was nicknamed \\"the Jam Pad\\" and had its own Twitter account. In 2019 Kalanick purchased a penthouse in New York City for $36.4 million. In April 2020, he bought a home in Los Angeles for $43.3 million. Kalanick has been described as being a passionate libertarian, and a fan of author Ayn Rand. However, even with his libertarian beliefs Kalanick stated that he supports Obamacare because his independent contractor drivers maintain health insurance as they transition between jobs.

He taught extensively in universities in the United Kingdom, nations of Africa, Australia and, finally, the United States. In 1961 King moved to exile in the United Kingdom after having done graduate work there. He was resisting racism by the local draft board in his hometown of Albany, Georgia, during the Jim Crow years. He did not return to the United States until receiving a presidential pardon from Bill Clinton in 2000.

Preston's elder brothers included Chevene Bowers King, Clennon Washington King Jr., and Slater King. After attending local schools, King studied at the London School of Economics in the late 1950s, and at the University of Maryland in 1961. After his draft board learned that he was African American, it addressed him as \\"Preston\\" rather than using \\"Mr.\\" He refused to respond. Accused of draft evasion, King went into exile in the United Kingdom to avoid imprisonment and because he thought the charges unjust. He taught alternately in England and Africa, at Keele University, the University of Ghana, the University of Sheffield, the University of East Africa, and the University of Nairobi (where he was department chair). In 1976 King moved to the University of New South Wales in Australia, becoming head of his school. In 1986 he returned to the UK, to Lancaster University, where he again chaired his department. After much resistance in Georgia, he was pardoned by President Bill Clinton in 2000. He had been unable to return to the US for the funeral of his father or of two brothers.. Following his return to the United States from exile after his presidential pardon in 2000, King taught at Emory University and Morehouse College in Atlanta.

He signed his work as W or WR Dommersen. Biography Dommersen was born at the end of 1859 in Stratford, West Ham, London as the son of the Anglo / Dutch fine art painter Pieter Cornelis Dommersen and Anna Petronella Synja. His parents had moved from the Netherlands in 1855 to London, England. Pre 1700 the family came from Dahlheim, near Koblenz, in Germany, so their family name was originally 'Dommershausen'. He married c. 1887 Annie Louisa Gormer and had at least four sons and two daughters of whom there are descendants living in England and Scotland. His uncle, Cornelis Christiaan Dommersen, was also a painter in the Netherlands. It is possible that when his father received British nationality that they changed their family name – Dommershuizen – into the more English sounding surname Dommersen / Dommerson. Dommersen's grandmother, Cornelia Dommershuizen and his Uncle, Thomas Hendrik Dommershuizen (Dommersen) were both portrayed by the famous Anglo/ Dutch painter Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema in 1862. Dommersen painted between 1875 and 1927 genre pieces, landscapes, marine scenes, village- and town-scenes of quality. His best known works are the European villages and towns along rivers and canals. He painted mostly in the Netherlands and England but visited also, often with his father and uncle, Belgium, France and Italy. His work such as view on the Canal Grande in Venice, river views in the Thames and Windsor Castle are well known. At some stage he lived in Royal Tunbridge Wells Kent, which was strategically placed for his travels to Europe. Whilst living in Royal Tunbridge Wells he painted The Pantiles there. He had an only brother, William Daniel Dommerson, who was born Stratford, London, c. 1860, but died before 1871. William Raymond Dommersen died in 1927 in London.

Several were built, as intended, by amateurs from plans in addition to some constructed by the four man design consortium. Design and development John W. Dooley, Donald D. Miller, Cyril B. Smith and Roy E. Wheeler founded Flight Level Six_Zero (F L S Z) to design, construct and sell plans of a simple biplane. Work on the Der Kricket DK-1 began in 1971; though the first flight was not made until 19 September 1978, a second aircraft flew just five days later. The principal aim of the design was simplicity, making it easy to build and fly, straightforward to maintain and bringing good economy. The Kricket is a clean, equal span biplane with a single I-form streamlined interplane strut on each side and N-form cabane struts bracing the upper wing over the fuselage but with no flying wires. The lower wing is mounted at the fuselage bottom. Both wings have the same span and chord and they have significant stagger but neither dihedral nor sweep. The wings have two spars and are light alloy throughout including a pop-riveted skin, though the wing tips are glass fibre covered foam. Plain ailerons are fitted only on the lower wings; there are no trim tabs on them nor inboard flaps. The rear surfaces are both single piece, all-moving alloy cantilever structures with glass-fibre tips like the wings. The tailplane is mounted on the bottom of the fuselage and the fin is tall and upright. Both have anti-servo tabs. The fuselage is built from alloy angle, bolted and riveted together and skinned with light alloy. The plans allow for either flat or rounded sides, the latter requiring just one extra angle piece per side. The Kricket is powered by a 50-65 hp (37-48 kW) flat-four Volkswagen air-cooled engine, installed with its cylinder heads and exhausts exposed outside the engine cowling, which drives a two blade propeller. The single seat places the pilot behind the trailing edge of the upper wing, giving him reasonable upward vision. Behind him the ventral decking slopes down to the tail. There is a fixed, conventional undercarriage with main wheels fitted with mechanical brakes, enclosed in speed fairings and mounted on wire braced, faired, light-alloy legs. The tail wheel is mounted on a long, shallowly inclined leg which reaches back to the elevator trailing edge. Operational history Three Krickets were completed by F L S Z and registered in a consecutive block in the names of Dooley, Miller and Smith. The FAA register records four other examples, some at least of which were home-built by individuals from plans.

The society both protects collected materials through book releases, does guidance for collectors and own research in the field of folklore. From 1922 to 2012, the company has published 166 book titles, as well as a reprint of Magnus Brostrup Landstads Norske Folkeviser (= Norwegian Folk Songs) from 1852, besides cassettes and CDs with original recorded Folk Songs. Main activities are the publication of the book series Norsk Folkeminnelags skrifter [= writings]. In addition, the Norwegian Folklore Society publishes a journal called FOLKEMINNER.

The journal also contains communication from board meetings, seminars, etc. The newspaper Tidens Tegn's presentation of the newly established Folk Society in, 1920, with a drawing of its founder, professor Knut Liestøl. Decentralization of oral sources From the beginning, the Folklore Society has committed itself to publish to a wide audience. Since the 1830s oral stories have been collected among Norwegian peasants, sailors and students. The most important of these sources (collected by Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe, Sophus Bugge, Moltke Moe, etc.), led to the creation of Norsk Folkeminnesamling (NFS). By 1914, these materials had become entered the public domain. Nevertheless, archives were essentially inaccessible to ordinary people. The same applied to other collections (i.e. Johan Theodor Storaker etc.), which were taken care of at the Manuscript Collection in the University Library of Oslo (now the National Library of Norway, Oslo). NFL in particular emphasized folklore genres, beliefs and customs that were linearly passed on from one generation to the next. While the early editions were systematically parent material collections the books in recent years have been more focused on historical context and commentary, with book decor, illustrations, hard back and bindings. Earlier the Norwegian Folklore Society was most focused on making available the already collected material at NFS. This was done to refute allegations that the reconstruction of such a central archive would only cause the material exclusively reserved for a small circle of scholars. It was an explicit national program to make sure the oral sources in published form should be returned to the areas where they were originally collected. At the same time the releases were meant to be a tribute to the collectors, and a way to encourage them to continue their efforts to save important oral culture that surrounded them in everyday life. The purpose of the Folklore Society's business However, NFL highlights not only what stands in danger of being buried and forgotten, but is also involved in ongoing collection and mapping of contemporary folk culture. Through folkloristic releases from virtually every corner of Norway the Folklore Society has succeeded in preserving and visualizing a great part of the country's intangible cultural heritage, which could otherwise be lost to time. Perspectives have also shifted towards identifying new cultural elements, cultural encounters (acculturation), and different forms of expression. As the oral tales are being transferred to other media, some may argue that the material is not being done justice until the material once again comes to be used in its traditional environment. However, the releases are not primarily intended to revitalize, but rather to document different traditions. Furthermore, in some cases, tapes and CD-releases are attached to books with musical content. Through releases the Folklore Society conducts an active cultural policy by making the readers aware of aspects of the intangible material culture that most people might not otherwise have gained awareness of. There are also many examples of local communities, professional musicians and storytellers that have been able to acquire and revitalize parts of their historical local culture after the documented sources from the Folklore Society. The Folklore Society's current and future work NFL volatile workspaces - the intangible immaterial culture - has put its main focus on book publications. This has been and is still the backbone of the activities, but NFL also operates other types of cultural dissemination. The Society is actively participating in projects through the guidance of those who are willing to collect folk tradition, and also consultation authors with scripts. NFL has on several occasions been involved in exhibitions and cultural arrangements, and cooperate extensively with other cultural organizations, and do lectures, seminars on their own. NFL is also a member of the Norwegian Cultural Heritage Association.

His wife Anna Morandi Manzolini also became a well-known maker of wax anatomical models. Early years Giovanni Manzolini was born in 1700 in Bologna, the son of a shoemaker. As a young man he helped his father in his trade. In 1736 he married Anna Morandi (1716-1774), whom he had known since childhood. His wife had been trained as an artist. They were to have six children before 1755, although four died before reaching adulthood. Was modeler and anatomist Deciding to become a figure painter, Manzolini joined Ercole Lelli's studio at the age of 40 to learn the art of anatomical sculpture. He was made Lelli's assistant in 1743. Under Lelli, Manzolini was made chief assistant on the papal commission to make wax models for the Anatomy Museum of the Academy of Sciences of Bologna Institute, holding this position for three years. He resigned in late 1746. He felt bitterly that Lelli had deprived him of recognition for his greater knowledge of anatomy and anatomical sculpture. After leaving Lelli, Manzolini opened his own studio for wax modelling and launched a school of anatomy. His wife also learned how to dissect cadavers, and learned anatomy and the art of wax modeling so she could help her husband. The husband and wife team became recognized by artists and anatomists throughout Europe. Anna Moranda was the one who gave the lectures and demonstrations at the school. Manzolini was appointed Professor of Anatomy at the University of Bologna. Giovanni Manzolini died in Bologna in 1755. Anna Morandi Manzolini had been helping her husband with lectures, and after his death was appointed Lecturer in Anatomy at the university, and in 1756 was appointed Professor of Anatomy. Work Manzolini produced many models. These included models of the sensory and vocal organs that he prepared for the Royal Society in London, nine anatomical models for the King of Sardinia, and an anatomical compendium of 46 wax parts and 125 colored clay parts. Many of the models made by the Manzolinis were purchased by Giovanni Antonio Galli (1708-1782) for use in his school for midwives, then bought by Pope Benedict XIV and assigned to the Bologna Istituto delle Scienze and housed in the Palazzo Poggi, where they can be seen today.

Richard Dummer, who had previously emigrated in 1632 as an organizer of and investor in the failed Plough Company (Lygonia Providence).Charles E.

(Privately printed; Collections Maine Historical Society) James Phinney Baxter, George Cleeve of Casco Bay 1630-1667 (The Gorges Society, 1885) Dummer had returned to Hampshire, England, about 1637 and, as a Bevis passenger, was bringing relatives back to New England with him. The following excerpt is from Eugene Cole Zubrinsky's online sketch of \\"William2 Carpenter of Rehoboth\\" which indicates an indirect connection between Dummer and the Carpenters: \\"The Bevis passenger list describes William2 and his father as “of Horwell,” that is, Whorwell (now Wherwell), in Horwell Hundred, Hampshire, about 15 miles south-south-east of Shalbourne. Wherwell, which had a tradition of religious dissent—at least two of its vicars, Stephen Bachiler (1587–1605)The son of Stephen Bachiler (23 June 1561 - 28 October 1656) and his probable brother-in-law John Bate (1605–1633), were nonconformists—lies on a straight line from Shalbourne to the Bevis’s port of departure, at Southampton. (Another Bevis passenger in 1638 was Richard Dummer, who, with kinsman Bachiler, had been a partner in the Plough Company, which had recruited dissenters for migration to New England in 1631 and 1632.) It is clear from the chronology of Carpenter records at Shalbourne that the family was at Wherwell for a few months at most. It is indeed possible that they paused there only long enough to obtain from sympathetic authorities the certificates of conformity (one for each man) that customs officials would require for the Carpenters to leave England and from which the residence recorded for them on the passenger list was probably copied (TAG 70:193–94, 195n14; NEHGR 14:336; Old Hampshire Maps; see also “Focus on the Planter,” GMN 15, no. 4).\\"Zubrinsky, Eugene Cole, FASG. \\"Carpenter Sketches\\" specifically Sketch 2 of 12 located at: https://carpentercousins.com/Wm2_Rehoboth.pdf - reference date October 22, 2018, citation codes within the quote are fully explained at the end of the sketch given.

The ICTY indicted Croatian Army (HV) generals Ante Gotovina, Ivan Čermak and Mladen Markač for war crimes, specifically for their roles in Operation Storm, citing their participation in a joint criminal enterprise (JCE) aimed at the permanent removal of Serbs from the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) held part of Croatia. The ICTY charges specified that other participants in the JCE were President of Croatia Franjo Tuđman, defence minister Gojko Šušak, and generals Janko Bobetko and Zvonimir Červenko, however all except Bobetko were dead before the first relevant ICTY indictment was issued in 2001. General Bobetko was indicted by the ICTY, but died a year later, before he could be transferred to the ICTY. The trial brought convictions of Gotovina and Markač and acquittal of Čermak in April 2011. Gotovina and Markač were acquitted on appeal in November 2012. The case raised significant issues for law of war and it has been described as a precedent. Background As the breakup of Yugoslavia progressed, the 1990 Log Revolution of the Croatian Serbs occurred, in parts of Lika, Kordun, Banovina and in eastern Croatian settlements with significant Serb population. The areas were later named the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK), which declared intention of political integration with Serbia and was viewed by the Government of Croatia as a rebellion. By March 1991, the conflict escalated to warthe Croatian War of Independence. The final months of 1991 saw the fiercest fighting of the war, culminating in the Battle of the barracks, Siege of Dubrovnik, and the Battle of Vukovar. In January 1992, the Sarajevo Agreement was signed by representatives of Croatia, the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) and the United Nations (UN) to suspend fighting between the two sides. Ending the series of unsuccessful ceasefires, United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was deployed to Croatia—to supervise and maintain the agreement. The conflict largely passed on to entrenched positions, and the JNA soon retreated from Croatia into Bosnia and Herzegovina, where a new conflict was anticipated, but Serbia continued to support the RSK. Croatian Army (HV) advances restored small areas to Croatian controlas the siege of Dubrovnik was lifted, and in Operation Maslenica. Croatian towns and villages were intermittently attacked by artillery, or missiles. =Operation Storm= On 4 August 1995, Croatia launched the Operation Storm, recapturing bulk of the RSK-held territory within days in the largest European land battle since the World War II, encompassing a frontline. It restored , representing 18.4% of the Croatia's territory, to Croatian control. Defeat of the RSK reversed the tide of Yugoslav Wars against the Serbs, giving the US diplomacy a strong boost. The success of the Operation Storm allowed Croatian and Bosnian leadership to plan a full-scale military intervention in Bosnian-Serb-held Banja Luka area of Bosnia and Herzegovina, aimed at creating a new balance of power there, a buffer zone along Croatian border, and contributing to resolution of the Bosnian War. The intervention would materialize as the Operation Mistral 2 of September 1995, albeit combined with a NATO air campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina, contributing to start of peace talks that would result with the Dayton Agreement a few months later, as well as restoration to the remaining Serb-held areas in eastern Slavonia and Baranya to Croatia through the Erdut Agreement. HV forces set to attack the RSK were organized in five army corpsSplit, Gospić, Karlovac, Zagreb and Bjelovar Corps with a zone assigned to the Croatian special police in between the Split and Gospić Corps zones. The special police zone was subordinated to the Split Corps. The HV Split Corps, located in the far south of the theatre of operations was commanded by Lieutenant General Ante Gotovina. The 3,100-strong special police, deployed to the Velebit Mountain on the left flank of the Split Corps, were commanded by the Colonel General Mladen Markač. On 5 August, General Ivan Čermak was appointed commander of the newly established HV Knin Corps after the town was captured by the HV. During the Operation Storm, RSK authorities ordered evacuation of Knin, Glina and Vrginmost areas, and bulk of the Serb population left the area. A UN report indicated that more than 150,000 had fled to Yugoslavia, while 10-15 thousand arrived Banja Luka area. The number of Serb refugees is reported to be up to 200,000 by international media, and organizations. The retreating RSK military, transporting large quantities of weaponry and ammunition, artillery and tanks, and evacuating or fleeing civilians often intermingled, having few roads to use. The escaping columns were reportedly intermittently attacked by Croatian Air Force jets, HV artillery, and Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina troops, as well as by Bosnian Serb jets and run down by retreating RSK tanks. Indictments The ICTY issued indictments against three senior Croatian commanders, Colonel General Ivan Čermak, Colonel General Mladen Markač and Brigadier (later General) Ante Gotovina. In the original indictment, the three were charged under individual, joint criminal enterprise and command responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity carried out against rebel Serb forces and civilians. The indictment alleged creation of a joint criminal enterprise whose purpose was to permanently remove the Serbian population through commission of crimes (plunder, inhumane treatment, murder, wanton destruction, looting and others) and prevention of their return. It was speculated that President Tuđman and his closest associates would have been indicted by the ICTY had they not died before the case was taken over by the court. Čermak and Markač were handed over to the ICTY, but Gotovina fled. He was widely believed to be at liberty in Croatia or the Croat-inhabited parts of Bosnia, where many view him as a hero, and his continued freedom was attributed to covert help from — or at least a \\"blind eye\\" turned by — the Croatian authorities. The US Government offered a $5 million reward for the capture of Ante Gotovina and he became one of the ICTY's most wanted men. The issue was a major stumbling block for Croatia's international relations. Its application to join the European Union was rebuffed in March 2005 due to the Croatian government's perceived complicity in Gotovina's continued evasion of the ICTY. On 8 December 2005, Gotovina was captured by Spanish police in a hotel on Tenerife in the Canary Islands. He was transferred to Madrid for court proceedings before extradition to the ICTY at The Hague. The ICTY later joined the proceedings against the three generals into a single case. Trial The trial started in March 2008, and concluded in September 2010. In April 2011 the court found Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markač guilty, sentencing them to 24 and 18 years respectively while Ivan Čermak was acquitted of all charges.  Following a successful appeal, Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markač were acquitted of all charges by the Appeals Chamber in November 2012.  The transcript of the 31 July 1995 meeting, whose authenticity was verified by the Croatian Chief State Prosecutor's Office,Government Decides To Lift Classification Seal from Transcripts HRTProgram with the surfaced recordings – Croatian Radiotelevision formed the basis of the Prosecutor's allegation of a joint criminal enterprise found in the indictment against generals Ante Gotovina, Ivan Cermak and Mladen Markac. The prosecution of the ICTY alleged that the content of the meeting was evidence of existence of a joint criminal enterprise to forcibly remove the Serb population from Croatia, among other means by indiscriminately shelling civilian areas, and prevent their return. The Trial Chamber dismissed those allegations in part, arguing some of Tuđman's statements referred to the Serb military forces rather than civilians. More generally, the prosecution asserted that the transcripts demonstrated a shared intent to forcibly remove Serbs from the area and the Trial Chamber largely concurred, saying the intent of the meeting's participants was \\"to show Serbs out but at the same time give them the impression that they could stay\\". The Appeals Chamber focused on the lack of evidence in the transcript for the allegation of unlawful artillery attacks on four towns in the RSK which were meant to drive the population out. In June 2008, during the trial, Canadian general Andrew Leslie claimed between 10,000 and 25,000 civilians were victims of the shelling of Knin on 4 and 5 August 1995. Mladen Markac's defense counsel cited this as an example of gross exaggerations of Serb casualties by the UN personnel in the field. Canadian general Alain Forand didn't want to comment on Leslie's claim, saying only that something like that was never registered in the situation reports drafted by the Sector South command. The Trial Chamber's judgement had directly identified President Franjo Tuđman as part of a joint criminal enterprise dedicated to expelling Serb residents of the country's Krajina region. In it, however, the ICTY did not rule that Operation Storm as a whole was a \\"joint criminal enterprises\\" or that Croatia was established on an illegitimate basis. Rather the judges ruled that some aspects of the military offensive violated international law. According to the Trial Chamber's findings, the population was already on the move due to the shelling of the towns before the Krajina authorities ordered evacuations. Later in August at least a further 20,000 people were the subject of deportation by way of forcible displacement due to crimes and inhumane acts. The Trial Chamber stated that \\"members of the Croatian military forces and the Special Police committed deportation as a crime against humanity of more than 20,000 Krajina Serbs\\" (par. 1710). However, the Appeals Chamber decided that civilian departures related to artillery attacks \\"only constituted deportation where these artillery attacks were found to have been unlawful\\" (par. 87), and in turn \\"reversed the Trial Chamber's findings related to unlawful artillery attacks\\" (par. 91) thus defeating charges of deportation entirely. The Appeals Chamber decision was a 3-2 majority decision that found that the prosecution had failed to prove the existence of a joint criminal enterprise and the Trial Chamber failed to identify and discuss other modes of responsibility thus not allowing the Appeals Chamber to enter convictions under command responsibility or aiding and abbetting. Aftermath The first instance judgement was a shock to Croatia, and both Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor and President Ivo Josipović expressed their shock and rejection of the ruling, promising to help overturn the judgement on appeal. Serbian officials expressed their satisfaction with the judgement, some of them requesting that the Victory Day celebrations commemorating the Operation Storm in Croatia no longer be held. The judgement was seen by the public as helpful to further the Serbian case against Croatia regarding the Operation Storm. Response to the ruling, beyond Croatia and Serbia, was also divided. While some saw the decision as justice done for the victims, others saw the verdict as a politically inspired act meant to equalize blame between all sides in the war, representing a major coup for Serbia. Subsequent acquittals of Gotovina and Markač led to jubilation in Croatia, and over a hundred thousand people gathered at the Zagreb's central square for a heroes' welcome after the Government of Croatia sent a plane to transfer the two back to the country, the same day the Appeals Chamber's judgement was rendered. They were welcomed by Prime Minister Zoran Milanović and other country's officials. President of Serbia Tomislav Nikolić called the judgement scandalous, political and illegal and predicted that it will not contribute to stability of the region and reopen \\"old wounds\\". In the aftermath of the judgement, Serbian officials declared that the ICTY had lost all its credibility, and decided to limit cooperation with the ICTY to formal correspondence only. Protests against the ruling drew several hundred in Belgrade. The case raised significant issues for law of war, and became one of landmark cases tried by the ICTY shaping modern international law. The ruling is seen as a vindication of legality of the Operation Storm and of the 1990s Croatian leadershipas the Gotovina et al. case became a proxy trial of Tuđman, Šušak and Bobetko, and as a closure for the Croatian War of Independence, and a triumph of Croatia.

It first appeared in Sandburg's first mainstream collection of poems, Chicago Poems, published in 1916. Sandburg has described the genesis of the poem. At a time when he was carrying a book of Japanese Haiku, he went to interview a juvenile court judge, and he had cut through Grant Park and saw the fog over Chicago harbor. He had certainly seen many fogs before, but this time he had to wait forty minutes for the judge, and he only had a piece of newsprint handy, so he decided to create an \\"American Haiku\\".

Bandaranayake was accused of a number of charges including financial impropriety and interfering in legal cases, all of which she has denied. The impeachment followed a series of rulings against the government by the Supreme Court, including one against a bill proposed by Minister Basil Rajapaksa, President Rajapaksa's brother. Bandaranayake was replaced as chief justice by former Attorney General Mohan Peiris. Peiris is considered to be an ally of President Rajapaksa and his appointment is seen by critics as further consolidation of power by the president and his family. Bandaranayake refused to recognise the impeachment and lawyers groups refused to work with the new chief justice. Bandaranayake's controversial impeachment drew much criticism and concern from within and outside of Sri Lanka. On 28 January 2015 she was reinstated and retired on 29 January, the next day. Background Bandaranayake was appointed to the Supreme Court on 30 October 1996 by President Chandrika Kumaratunga. In 2011 President Mahinda Rajapaksa appointed Bandaranayake as Chief Justice, succeeding Asoka de Silva who retired on 17 May 2011. She took her oaths before President Rajapaksa on 18 May 2011. =Town and Country Planning (Amendment) Bill= The Town and Country Planning (Amendment) Bill was published in The Sri Lanka Gazette on 17 October 2011. The bill allowed the government to declare any land in a municipal, urban development or road development area as a \\"protected\\", \\"conservation\\", \\"architectural\\", \\"historical\\" or \\"sacred\\" area and to acquire that land. According to the Constitution of Sri Lanka most land issues are devolved to the provincial councils. The Sri Lankan government introduced the bill in parliament on 8 November 2011. The bill's constitutionality was challenged by the Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA) and Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu in the Supreme Court. The court (Bandaranayake, Chandra Ekanayake and K. Sripavan) met on 21 November 2011 to hear the petition. The court's determination (S.C. Special Determination No. 03/2011) was conveyed to Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa, another brother of President Rajapaksa, on 2 December 2011 and on 3 December 2011 the Speaker announced the determination to Parliament: the bill was in respect of matters set out in the provincial council list and therefore cannot become law unless it has been referred to every provincial council. The government withdrew the bill from parliament and referred it to the nine provincial councils. The provincial councils expressed concern about the bill and suggested amendments. The bill was opposed by the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress and Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal, both members of the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA), President Rajapaksa's party, as well as the opposition United National Party. Faced with opposition, the government abandoned the bill in April 2012. =Divi Neguma Bill= The Divi Neguma Bill was published in The Sri Lanka Gazette on 27 July 2012. The bill established the Department of Divi Neguma Development by amalgamating the Samurdhi Authority of Sri Lanka, Southern Development Authority of Sri Lanka and the Udarata Development Authority, and created numerous community organisations, banks and banking societies. The Department of Divi Neguma Development would be controlled by the Ministry of Economic Development headed by President Rajapaksa's brother Basil Rajapaksa and would carry out development activities. According to the Constitution of Sri Lanka most development activities are devolved to the provincial councils. The Sri Lankan government introduced the bill in parliament on 10 August 2012. The bill's constitutionality was consequently challenged by four petitioners on three petitions in the Supreme Court. The court (Bandaranayake, Priyasath Dep and Eva Wanasundera) met on 27 and 28 August 2012 to hear the petitions. Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa announced the Supreme Court's determinations (S.C. Special Determination No. 01/2012, 02/2012 and 03/2012) to Parliament on 18 September 2012: the bill was in respect of matters set out in the provincial council list and therefore cannot become law unless it has been referred to every provincial council. The UPFA controlled eight of the nine provincial councils and between 25 September 2012 and 3 October 2012 all eight approved the Divi Neguma Bill. The ninth provincial council, Northern, had not been functioning as an elected body since it was established in 2007. The bill was approved by the Northern Province's Governor G. A. Chandrasiri who had been appointed by President Rajapaksa. The bill then returned to Parliament and a further eleven petitions were placed before the Supreme Court challenging the bill's constitutionality. Amongst these petitions was one filed on 4 October 2012 by opposition MP Mavai Senathirajah challenging the legality of Chandrasiri's approving the bill. The court (Bandaranayake, N. G. Amaratunga and K. Sripavan) met on 18, 22, and 23 October 2012 to hear the petitions. The Supreme Court's determinations were passed to the president on 31 October 2012. Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa announced the Supreme Court's determinations to Parliament on 6 November 2012: clause 8(2) was unconstitutional and needed to be approved by a referendum; twelve other clauses were inconsistent with the constitution and needed to be passed by special majority (two-thirds) of Parliament; the governor of the Northern Province does not have the power to endorse the bill and therefore Parliament needed to pass the bill by special majority. The government amended the bill to avoid holding a referendum. The amended Divi Neguma Bill was passed by Parliament on 8 January 2013 with the required two-thirds majority. Impeachment An impeachment motion against Chief Justice Bandaranayake signed by 117 UPFA MPs was handed to Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa on 1 November 2012, the day after the Supreme Court's determinations on the Divi Neguma Bill were passed to the president. Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa revealed the 14 charges against Bandaranayake on 6 November 2012 which included failing to disclose financial interests, abuse of power and disregarding the constitution. Bandaranayake denied the charges. =Parliamentary Select Committee= An eleven-member parliamentary select committee (PSC) consisting of seven government MPs and four opposition MPs was appointed to hear the impeachment charges. Impeachment hearings were held on 23 November 2012, 4 December 2012 and 6 December 2012 when Bandaranayake walked out of the hearing. The opposition MPs withdrew from the PSC on 7 December 2012. The PSC's report was presented to Parliament on 8 December 2012. The PSC found that three of five charges against Bandaranayake had been proven and this was enough to remove her from office. She was found guilty of impropriety in a property transaction (1st charge), having undeclared bank accounts (4th charge) and conflict of interest in a legal case involving her husband (5th charge). She was found not guilty on the 2nd and 3rd charges and the remaining nine charges were disregarded by the PSC. Opposition MPs have rejected the PSC report, saying \\"This was not an inquiry it was an inquisition\\". The PSC's report was them sent to President Rajapaksa. The Supreme Court (N. G. Amaratunga, Priyasath Dep and K. Sripavan) ruled on 1 January 2013 that the PSC had no power to investigate allegations against the chief justice and the impeachment was therefore unconstitutional. Bandaranayake appealed against the PSC and on 7 January 2013 the Court of Appeal quashed the PSC's findings. Two Court of Appeal judges, S. Sriskandarajah and Anil Goonarathne, subsequently received death threats. =Impeachment motion and removal from office= The government ignored the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal rulings and went ahead with the impeachment. The impeachment motion against Bandaranayake was debated by Parliament on 10 and 11 January 2013. The motion was passed by Parliament with 155 MPs voting for and 49 MPs voting against it. Opposition MPs described the impeachment motion as flawed and therefore invalid. Bandaranayake was removed from office on 13 January 2013 after President Mahinda Rajapaksa ratified the impeachment motion passed by Parliament. According to some reports Rajapaksa had offered to allow Bandaranayake to retire but she had refused. Aftermath After the impeachment motion passed Parliament, Bandaranayake indicated that she would not leave office, citing the Supreme Court ruling declaring the PSC unconstitutional. Lawyers groups urged the Supreme Court judges not to sit with any new Chief Justice. President Rajapaksa nominated former Attorney General Mohan Peiris to succeed Bandaranayake. According to the constitution of Sri Lanka, the president must refer his nomination to the Parliamentary Council for \\"observations\\" but it is the president who makes the appointment. The five member Parliamentary Council consists of the Speaker, Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition, a nominee of the Prime Minister and a nominee of the Leader of the Opposition. The Parliamentary Council met on 15 January 2013 to discuss the appointment but Leader of the Opposition Ranil Wickremasinghe and his nominee D. M. Swaminathan did not attend as they were opposed to the Council. The Parliamentary Council gave its approval for Peiris's appointment on 15 January 2013. Peiris was sworn in as chief justice at 12.30pm on 15 January 2013. Peiris was a legal adviser to President Rajapaksa and his government and was prominent in defending Rajapaksa's government from allegations of human rights violations and enforced disappearances. He had never served as a judge and is seen as an ally of the president. Bandaranayake vacated her official residence at 5.30pm on 15 January 2013 and issued a statement in which she insisted she was still the legitimate chief justice and that the charges against her were all \\"blatant lies\\". As she left Bandaranayake told reporters she feared for her family's safety. After the impeachment three senior lawyers who had supported Bandaranayake received threatening letters. Peiris was officially inaugurated as chief justice at a ceremony in the Supreme Court on 23 January 2013. The media, other than the state-owned media, were banned from the ceremony which was boycotted by the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL), the largest lawyers association in the country. The ceremony was however attended by other judges including the associate judges of the Supreme Court. A fundamental rights petition was filled by the CPA challenging the new appointment of the Chief Justice, as the CPA contends the appointment as illegal and in violation of their rights and the rights of the people. They sought two interim reliefs that would have prevented the approval of the new Chief Justice and the prevention of his accepting the post and the functioning of his office. Three other fundamental rights petitions against the impeachment have also been referred to the Supreme Court. These petitions will be heard by a panel of at least five Supreme Court judges. It is reported that the government is hoping that a fuller bench of the Supreme Court will reverse the 1 January 2013 ruling that the PSC was unconstitutional. The International Bar Association's Human Rights Institute (IBAHRI) had established a four-member delegation headed by former Chief Justice of India J. S. Verma to visit Sri Lanka on a fact-finding mission about the impeachment. The other members of the delegation were Baroness Prashar, Shane Keenan and Sadakat Kadri. The mission had to be cancelled after the Sri Lankan government withdrew the delegates visas on 29/30 January 2013. The Sri Lankan government defended the visa withdrawal, stating that the delegation was intent on interfering in the country's sovereignty. Reaction Bandaranayake's controversial impeachment drew much criticism and concern from within and outside of Sri Lanka. =Sri Lanka= Opposition politicians, lawyers, judges and other civil society groups criticised the impeachment as an attempt to curb the independence of the judiciary and concentrate powers with President Rajapaksa. They also claim the impeachment is in retaliation for the Supreme Court blocking the Divi Neguma Bill. After the impeachment motion had been passed opposition MP Mangala Samaraweera claimed that Sri Lanka had become a dictatorship: \\"Up to yesterday at least we kept up appearances of being at least a nominal democracy.

History Hallaig was launched in December 2012 at Ferguson Shipbuilders in Port Glasgow by Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. The name comes from a poem, written by Sorley MacLean, itself named after an abandoned township on Raasay. Hallaig was the first commercial ship to be fully built and delivered on the Clyde in over five years. The Scottish Government invested more than £20 million in the project. Layout Hallaig is the first of three roll-on roll-off hybrid- powered ferries. She has a low-carbon system of diesel electric and lithium ion battery power. The 135-ton vessel is long and accommodates 150 passengers and 23 cars or two HGVs. Service Hallaig was built for the service between Sconser on Skye and Raasay and commenced service on 17 October 2013. The Clydebuilt Hallaig began her first sea trials on 5 August 2013, eight months after her launch, although she had moved in and out of dry dock in Greenock under her own power in July 2013. The delay in her entry to service was caused by a last minute change in fire safety regulations which required her and her sister Lochinvar to have insulation fitted extensively to exposed steel and aluminium on board. In April 2014, Hallaig temporarily relieved on the Mallaig-Armadale service after was involved in an incident at Dunoon and had to have her bow extensively rebuilt. In March 2018, she relieved on the Lochaline-Fishnish route so that her sister could go for her overhaul.

Wilson High School Yearbook, pg. 103.  Training  Benedict received his B.A. from Cornell University in 1970, where he studied early modern European history with H.G. Koenigsberger.Benedict, Philip (1981). Rouen During the Wars of Religion. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pg. xvi. He completed his M.A. in 1972 and his Ph.D. in 1975 at Princeton University, under the direction of Theodore K. Rabb and Lawrence Stone. While conducting his dissertation research in France, Benedict also followed the seminar of Denis Richet at what was then the VIe Section of the École Pratique des Hautes Études.  Research  Benedict’s publications have ranged from economic history to the history of printmaking and information, but have chiefly focused on the social and political history of the Reformation, with primary reference to the French Wars of Religion and the Protestant minority in sixteenth and seventeenth- century France. Benedict's first book, Rouen during the Wars of Religion, has been described as a \\"model study of the interaction of social, religious, and political factors in French religious wars\\" by the American Historical Association Guide to Historical Literature. His Christ's Churches Purely Reformed: A Social History of Calvinism was awarded the 2003 Philip Schaff Prize from the American Society of Church History, and the 2004 Phyllis Goodhart Gordan Prize from The Renaissance Society of America. In contrast to Denis Crouzet and Natalie Davis, who have explored the motivations and psychology behind Roman Catholic religious violence in early modern France, Benedict has asserted various motivations and reasons that Huguenots engaged in religious violence against Catholics. Benedict has stated that three important factors inspired French Protestants to wage war against their Catholic adversaries: (1) John Calvin’s condemnation of “Nicodemism,” (2) Reformed polemical treatises and sermons against Catholic images, and (3) the Huguenot belief that the 1562 Edict of January was under direct assault by overzealous Catholics, and thus needed to be defended by force of arms.Duker, Adam Asher (2014). \\"The Protestant Israelites of Sancerre: Jean de Léry and the Confessional Demarcation of Cannibalism\\".

He should not be confused with his great-nephew Thomas Dongan, 2nd Earl of Limerick. His career was dogged by accusations of recusancy and of disloyalty to the English Crown. He is best remembered as the father of Margaret Dongan, wife of the Dutch scholar Arnold Boate, who commemorated her lovingly in his book The Character of a Truly Virtuous and Pious Woman, and also wrote with affection and respect about her father.Gilbert, John Thomas \\"Arnold Boate\\" Dictionary of National Biography 1885-1900 Vol.5 p.283 Background He was the fourth and youngest son of John Dongan of Castletown, County Kildare (died 1592), and his wife Margaret Forster, daughter of Walter Forster.Ball , F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol.1 p.340 His father died when Thomas was still an infant. His eldest brother Sir Walter Dongan (1579-1626) was created the first of the Dongan Baronets, and was the ancestor of the Earls of Limerick. Early career Thomas entered Lincoln's Inn in 1615 but was expelled for recusancy.Ball p.340 It is likely that he remained a convinced Roman Catholic all his life (although his son-in-law records that he raised his children as Protestants, and his first wife Grace was a Protestant), but by 1627 he had at least outwardly conformed to the Church of England, and was readmitted to Lincoln's Inn and called to the English Bar. He married an English wife, Grace Palmer of Nottinghamshire, and remained in England until 1640 when he returned to Ireland, where he was admitted to the King's Inn and called to the Irish Bar.Ball p.340 Civil War and Interregnum He acquired considerable wealth, although he was to lose much of it during the Irish Rebellion of 1641.Ball p.340 He acquired as his patron James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde. Ormonde sent him to the English Court with a recommendation as to his loyalty, and he was appointed a justice of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland).Ball p.340 By 1648, when the Royalist cause had been utterly defeated in Ireland, he was said to be the only High Court judge still sitting in Dublin.Kenny, Colum The King's Inns and the Kingdom of Ireland Irish Academic Press Dublin 1992 p.120 He was also in financial distress, which may explain his decision, which greatly harmed his reputation, to accept office under the new government of Oliver Cromwell. He acted as a High Court judge in Leinster and Ulster and sat on the High Court of Justice which tried and condemned Sir Felim O'Neill and other rebels in 1652-3. He gained no permanent benefit from his support for the Cromwelllian regime, and by 1659 he was reduced to such a state of poverty that the King's Inn excused him payment of his fees and let him live free of rent in his chamber there.Ball p.340 His family life was marked by tragedy: his eldest son William was killed at the storming of Leicester on the eve of the Battle of Naseby, and his first wife Grace died soon afterwards. His daughter Margaret died in 1651 and her husband Arnold Boate in 1653.Gilbert p.283 He was a man with a strong sense of family loyalty, and during his brief period of influence during Oliver Cromwell's regime he is said to have used his position to assist his Royalist relatives, who were threatened with forfeiture of their estates. In particular he protected Mary, Lady Dongan, the widow of his nephew Sir John Dongan, 2nd Baronet (who had died in 1650), and her numerous children, two of whom later held the title Earl of Limerick. Probably as a result of Dongan's help, this branch of the family were able to retain much of their property.Cunningham, John Conquest and Land in Ireland- the Transplantation to Connacht 1649-1680 Boydell and Brewer 2011 p.112 Restoration After the Restoration of Charles II, Dongan, who was living in a state of considerable poverty, begged to be reappointed to the Bench, despite his age, ill-health, and dubious political loyalties. Probably Ormonde, who was soon to become Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and who never forgot a friend, recommended him for preferment, and he was appointed a Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland). Ball notes that his appointment came at the last possible moment, on the assumption that he was unfit for office and would be unlikely to serve for long. This assumption was justified:Ball p.271 by 1663 he was pleading to be allowed to retire on health grounds, and he died soon afterwards.Ball p.340 He was survived by his second wife, his son John and his granddaughter Mariana Boate. Character Elrington Ball's unflattering portrait of Dongan in The Judges in Ireland Ball p.271 should be balanced against the kindly and respectful portrayal of the judge by his son- in-law Arnold Boate, which emphasizes his family virtues. While his service under Cromwell led to accusations of treachery to the Stuart dynasty, or at least time-serving, it should also be remembered that he used his position to assist relatives in distress.Cunningham p.112 References Category:Members of Lincoln's Inn Category:1663 deaths Category:People from County Kildare Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:Justices of the Irish King's Bench Category:Barons of the Irish Exchequer Category:Alumni of King's Inns ","title":"Thomas Dongan (judge)"},{"id":"38217904","text":"Thomas Trevarthan (birth unknown – death unknown) was a New Zealand rugby union and professional rugby league footballer who played representative rugby league (RL) for New Zealand.

It dates to between 650 and 600 BC, probably 640s BC. It was built by a wealthy family and stocked with bronze cauldrons and gold jewellery of Etruscan origin in Oriental style. The tomb was discovered in 1836 in modern- day Cerveteri in an undisturbed condition and named after the excavators, general Vincenzo Galassi and the archpriest of Cerveteri, Alessandro Regolini. Description The tomb contains two burial chambers, located either side of a corridor long and wide. The lower portion of the tomb is cut into the tufa rock while the upper portion is built with square stone blocks, which has created an overhang resulting from the stone blocks extending one above the other. It is covered with a tumulus. The tumulus covers the entire structure giving it a facade of a monument. After the archaeological excavations of the tomb, the antiquities it contained were initially securely kept in a room in the residence of General Galassi, a key official of the papal army. They were then sold to the Vatican. Excavations at the site unearthed a royal woman buried in the end cell and a cremated man in the right-hand cell, and a wealth of items, including gold jewels, silverware, gilded and bronze ware, and a chariot. Also found on the bronze bed in an annex chamber was the body of one more person, whose identity has remained an unexplained mystery. Several of the items display seventh century BC Villanovan decorative motifs, including a great fibula, adorned with five tiny lions depicted striding across its surface, and a large 25 cm long plaque, decorated with depictions of animals of Eastern origin. The fibula has been acclaimed as masterful in technique. Orientalizing influences are prominent in the tomb, fusing Etruscan customs with those of Greece and the Eastern Mediterranean. The use of many materials in the items including iron, tin, copper, silver and gold illustrates the importance of mineral wealth in the area which saw Villanovan settlements develop from poor agricultural villages into thriving cities.

It uses relevant existing knowledge to speed up model generation and design optimization of a system. The knowledge is updated with new validation information from the system when available. Concept The space mapping methodology employs a \\"quasi-global\\" formulation that intelligently links companion \\"coarse\\" (ideal or low-fidelity) and \\"fine\\" (practical or high- fidelity) models of different complexities. In engineering design, space mapping aligns a very fast coarse model with the expensive-to-compute fine model so as to avoid direct expensive optimization of the fine model. The alignment can be done either off-line (model enhancement) or on-the-fly with surrogate updates (e.g., aggressive space mapping). Methodology At the core of the process is a pair of models: one very accurate but too expensive to use directly with a conventional optimization routine, and one significantly less expensive and, accordingly, less accurate. The latter (fast model) is usually referred to as the \\"coarse\\" model (coarse space). The former (slow model) is usually referred to as the \\"fine\\" model. A validation space (\\"reality\\") represents the fine model, for example, a high-fidelity physics model. The optimization space, where conventional optimization is carried out, incorporates the coarse model (or surrogate model), for example, the low- fidelity physics or \\"knowledge\\" model. In a space-mapping design optimization phase, there is a prediction or \\"execution\\" step, where the results of an optimized \\"mapped coarse model\\" (updated surrogate) are assigned to the fine model for validation. After the validation process, if the design specifications are not satisfied, relevant data is transferred to the optimization space (\\"feedback\\"), where the mapping-augmented coarse model or surrogate is updated (enhanced, realigned with the fine model) through an iterative optimization process termed \\"parameter extraction\\". The mapping formulation itself incorporates \\"intuition\\", part of the engineer's so-called \\"feel\\" for a problem. In particular, the Aggressive Space Mapping (ASM) process displays key characteristics of cognition (an expert's approach to a problem), and is often illustrated in simple cognitive terms.

Built as a parish church, it became the cathedral of the Diocese of Rapid City when the seat of the diocese was moved to Rapid City. It is now known as the Chapel of the Immaculate Conception. History St. Mary's Church was established in 1881. The cornerstone for its sandstone church building, designed in the Romanesque Revival style, was laid in 1909. It was dedicated in 1911. The Catholic Diocese of Lead was relocated and became the Diocese of Rapid City in 1930. St. Mary's Church was renamed the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception at that time.\\"Remember when the new cathedral was built?\\" West River Catholic (April 2013) Cardinal Francis Spellman came to the cathedral in 1948 to install William McCarty, C.Ss.R as the new bishop of the diocese. with The parish soon outgrew the church and it was replaced by the Cathedral of Our Lady of Perpetual Help in 1962. The church was added to the National Register in 1975. In time Immaculate Conception became a chapel and has housed a community where Mass is celebrated in Latin since 1992. Architecture The church building follows basically a rectangular plan with a cross-gabled section in the center of the structure. Both side gables are flanked by chimneys and are capped with a cross. The stone cladding was quarried locally. A square central tower capped with a pyramid-shaped spire covered with terneplate is located on the main facade. It includes the main entrance with a round-arch stained glass window above the three-panel doors. The round-arch openings in the bell chamber feature a balustrade. Round-arch windows filled with stained glass line the side elevations. The three windows in the cross-gabled section are taller than the four windows that flank it. Most of the windows are composed of geometric designs. The two largest windows depict Biblical scenes. All the window openings are capped by radiating voussoirs. The apse, constructed of vertical board on the rear elevation, is a later addition. Immaculate Conception is considered significant as the best example of the Romanesque Revival style in Rapid City, and one of only a few of this style that still exists here. It is the last known cut stone building constructed in the city, and one of two buildings with rock-faced facades that remain.
