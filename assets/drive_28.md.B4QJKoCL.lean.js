It has around 1,300 members around the world, although the vast majority are British, and is the only official association of St James in the United Kingdom. As such, it is the only accredited UK-based distributor of the Pilgrim Passport (credencial), the official pilgrim document recognised by Santiago Cathedral that proves ones bona fide pilgrim status. By collecting pilgrim stamps on this document, the traveller can access pilgrim accommodation along the Way, as well as qualify for the ancient certificate of completion, the Compostela, provided they have travelled a minimum of the final 100km - or 200km if cycling. The charity is based in London, England and publishes books in English for many of the routes on the Way of St. James. It also carries books on the history, spirituality, culture, architecture and musical associations with the Camino in its extensive pilgrim library. The CSJ hold events throughout the year. These include practical seminars to help pilgrims know how to prepare, coffee mornings and wine bar evenings get togethers for pilgrims to compare experiences and join the Camino community in the UK, occasional guided walks around the UK, as well as annual lectures on Camino-related topics. These are often given by qualified academics, owed to the CSJ's relationships with various centres of pilgrim study around the world.

Area code 937 was established in September 1996, after a split of area code 513. Area code 326 was added to area code 937 in an overlay plan in March 2020. History Area code 937 was created in a split of Ohio's original NPA for the southwestern part of the state (area code 513) on September 28, 1996. At the time, literature promoting the new area code took advantage of the fact that the digits of 937 spell out \\"YES\\" on a standard telephone keypad. As of April 2018, projections by the North American Numbering Plan Administrator expected that telephone exchanges (\\"central office codes\\") would be exhausted for area code 937 by the third quarter of 2020, so on July 3, 2018, area code 326 (which spells out \\"DAO\\" as in \\"DAyton, Ohio\\") was planned to overlay the 937 area. Beginning August 10, 2019, subscribers were encouraged to dial ten digits for local calls within the area code. On February 8, 2020, traditional seven-digit dialing ended. Customers attempting such calls receive an intercept message. On March 8, 2020, area code 326 was activated. Communities Area codes 937 and 326 serve Dayton, its metropolitan area, Springfield, public (non-Defense Switched Network) communications at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and most of southwest Ohio north and east of the Cincinnati metropolitan area.

Biography Willis began by designing science fiction wargames for Metagaming Concepts, starting with Godsfire in 1976. He designed the MicroGames Olympica (1978) and Holy War (1979). Chaosium published Lords of the Middle Sea (1978), and Willis joined Chaosium in 1978. GDW published Bloodtree Rebellion (1979). Willis's relationship with Chaosium proved the most enduring; he would turn to role-playing games. He helped founder Greg Stafford trim and refine the RuneQuest rules into Basic Role- Playing, the rules that would serve as the base for many of Chaosium's RPG lines. He wrote the Call of Cthulhu campaign The Masks of Nyarlathotep (1984) with Larry DiTillio. He was included in the design credits for Worlds of Wonder (1982) and the Ringworld RPG (1984). With other members of Chaosium, he co-wrote the Ghostbusters RPG for West End Games, which won the H.G. Wells Award for Best Role-playing Rules of 1986. Willis co-designed the fifth edition of Call of Cthulhu with Sandy Petersen, and replaced Keith Herber as line editor of Cthulhu when Herber left Chaosium in 1994. He worked with Petersen again for the sixth edition of Call of Cthulhu. Willis created the game Elric! with Richard Watts as a new Basic Role-Playing version of Stormbringer. After Greg Stafford left Chaosium in 1998, Willis stayed on as editor-in-chief.

It follows the Brisbane River from the Riverside Expressway, through the suburbs of Milton and Auchenflower, until it terminates in Toowong at Benson Road and High Street. Coronation Drive is six lanes wide for the majority of its length, with the Bicentennial Bike Path also for pedestrian and bicycle traffic. The road is one of the busiest in Brisbane, carrying an average of 75,560 vehicles per day between July and December 2014. History Coronation Drive started out as a rough track that developed along the river during the 1840s. It was initially called Moggill Road (because it was the road to Moggill), then later (1870s) it became known as the River Road.History of a street name - West Toowong , accessed 8 March 2011. In 1937 the River Road was renamed Coronation Drive in honour of the coronation of King George VI, a suggestion made by Archbishop James Duhig. On 13 May 1937, the Governor of Queensland Sir Leslie Wilson planted a small bunya tree on North Quay, Brisbane to mark the name change. Brisbane Lord Mayor John Beals Chandler undertook the improvement and beautification of the road in order to fulfill his vision of a gracious city. Coronation Drive developed as the major transport route for the western suburbs along with Milton Road. A landslide caused by flood waters in 1974 closed Coronation Drive due to cracking and subsidance. The flood caused the redirection of Coronation Drive so that traffic inbound to Brisbane City turned left at the Sylvan Road intersection, and then right down Land Street. Heritage listed terraced house on Coronation Drive at Milton. In 2004 Coronation Drive was completely redeveloped into its current day form, with the redirection removed and widening to allow 6 lanes of traffic. Former Lord Mayor Jim Soorley inaugurated a series of \\"tidal flow\\" traffic lights in both directions, as well as a dedicated bus lane, in order to ease congestion along the road. Upon the election of Campbell Newman, the bus lanes were changed to T3 Transit Lanes with three occupants required. In March 2007 the T3 transit lane restrictions were removed after Campbell Newman requested the change based on analysis showing that only 5% of vehicles actually use the T3 lane. The Labor opposition did not block the change.Courier Mail Article on Removing T3 lanes The Regatta Hotel In September 2008, the Council announced a decision to scrap the Tidal Flow System after conceding it as a failure. This decision was influenced by the construction of the Hale Street Bridge and also the maintenance cost of the system, amounting to $600,000 each year, with a further $7 million in repairs.(1 September 2008). Coronation Drive's tidal flow system scrapped . ABC News. Australia Broadcasting Corporation. Instead, 3 permanent lanes will be inbound to the city and 2 lanes outbound. Statistics show that more traffic travels inbound than outbound at both morning and afternoon peak hours.Tony Moore (27 August 2008). Coro Drive lane system 'a failure' . Brisbane Times. One of the inbound lanes will be made into a T2 lane once the Hale Street Bridge project is well developed.Tony Moore (2 September 2008). Months to ditch Coro Drive 'expensive flop' . Brisbane Times.  Tidal Flow System  The Coronation Drive Tidal Flow System was implemented to improve traffic flow along the routinely congested road. It consists of overhead gantries displaying white arrows or red crosses to indicate which lanes can be driven in, LED signs on approach that indicate current lanes open, LED catseye markers embedded in the road that are turned on and off to move the median line and boom gates that swing into the lanes when closed to stop use of the closed lane. The Tidal Flow System was heavily criticised by the public for a number of reasons. These included the perception that the lane system was confusing and caused road accidents, especially when drivers were required to make turns on or off the tidal flow system. Lights in the road meant to guide drivers were often broken and during daylight hours were hard to discern. In particular, the right hand turn from Coronation Drive onto Lang Street (outbound) has two lanes and drivers were routinely confused as to which lane on Lang street they should turn into. The Tidal Flow System was well over budget, with the cost of the system far higher than originally planned. The system was prone to vandalism, in particular the boom gates used to block off lanes were routinely hit by vehicles. Critics claim that the tidal flow system has not been effective in improving traffic flow. The primary reason given is due to traffic in both directions being high at peak hour due to the University of Queensland bound traffic balancing the city bound traffic. The tidal flow system did not close lanes due to traffic accidents or roadworks, instead, traditional vehicles and signage were used, leaving a much touted feature of the system unutilised. Out of state or overseas drivers tended to not understand the system and its dynamic lanes, thus were likely to end up driving in T3/Bus lanes or not merging when they should. The Tidal Flow System was dismantled and removed at the end of 2008 after a decision by the Brisbane City Council. A similar system is operated on the Houghton Highway across Bramble Bay at Redcliffe until the opening of the Ted Smout Memorial Bridge in 2011.

Wilkins graduated from Cass High School. His youngest son Evan Wilkins, better known by his stage name Ev Young is a singer-songwriter. In his NBA career, Wilkins played in 322 games and scored a total of 1,534 points. On November 15, 1990, he had one of his best games as a pro when he scored 20 points in 20 minutes against the Portland Trail Blazers as a member of the New York Knicks. Often backing up Patrick Ewing (who joined the team in 1985-86), Wilkins would only start in 29 of the 296 contests he played for the Knickerbockers. When Pat Riley came to New York, Wilkins was released. He went to Italy for one season (1991‚Äì92, joining Ranger Varese), before returning to the NBA the next season, signing a 2-year deal with the Philadelphia 76ers. Towards the end of the 1992-93 season, on April 15, 1993, the Sixers were playing the Orlando Magic, who were led by rookie Shaquille O'Neal. On a rebound attempt, Wilkins and O'Neal collided and became entangled. Wilkins tore his achilles tendon, missing the remainder of the season. His career was effectively ended. In 1989, he established the Eddie Lee Wilkins Foundation, which later became the Eddie Lee Wilkins Youth Association. With the help of program director David Archer, Jr., Wilkins and the association began providing athletic and social intervention activities for youth in the Cartersville and North Georgia area.

The power station was used to supply electricity for the retail market, as well as the production of briquettes in the adjacent Energy Brix briquette works. It was shut down in August 2014 and is currently the earliest surviving large-scale power station designed to provide electricity to the state electricity network. History A map of the major towns and coal-fired power stations in the Latrobe Valley. Work on the power station and briquette works commenced in 1949 by the State Electricity Commission of Victoria (SECV), when field works on the Morwell open cut mine commenced, and briquette production equipment was ordered from Germany. The SECV expected the first briquette factory to start operating in 1953. But by 1952, the whole project had come to a halt. The recession of 1951 with its credit restrictions had resulted in dismissal of half of the workforce, while equipment for the first two factories lay in limbo at the site. Delivery of the further two factories had been deferred. In 1955 the project was recommenced. Although the SECV decided to persevere with the first two briquette factories, it cancelled the orders for the planned third and fourth, halving the capacity of briquette production before it had even bugun. The Morwell project's priorities were now changed from briquetting to electrical power generation. Originally known as the Morwell Power Station, production at the plant started in 1956, with the briquettes produced used for domestic and industrial use, as well as town gas production for Melbourne at an adjacent gasworks by the Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria. Morwell Station consisted of one Low Pressure 20MW Metropolitan Vickers axial turbine, three High Pressure 30MW Metropolitan Vickers axial turbo generators and one 60MW (Total) Stal Laval cotra-rotating radial turbine. Steam was supplied by pulverized brown coal-fired boilers made by Mitchell. Eight Boilers supplied 8.7MPa 490Celsious Super Heated High Pressure Steam into a Range that supplied the Three 30MW Metropolitan Vickers Turbines which exhaust of those turbines went into a process main (300Kpa 175Celsious). The Process Main supplied steam to the LP 20MW Metropolitan Vickers Turbine (Which had a condenser and was attached to Marley Forced Draft American Redwood Cooling Towers North of the Power Station and Briquette Factory) and up to 24 Briquette Factory Driers. 8.7MPa 490Celsious Super Heated High Pressure Steam out of the range from the Eight Boilers also supplied steam to the Stal Laval cotra-rotating radial turbine which had a condenser and Marley Forced Draft American Redwood Cooling Towers south of the Power Station. It was unexpectedly discovered that coal from the Morwell open cut mine, with its high alkali and sulphur content, was not suitable for briquetting. The briquettes deteriorated quickly and fouled the boilers. In order to produce usable briquettes, Yallourn coal had to be transported to supply the Morwell briquette factories on the interconnecting railway, which was an additional cost. At this time, a decline in demand for briquettes was becoming evident, due to competition from oil, electricity for domestic heating, and several years later, the discovery of natural gas in Bass Strait. The same year the station and briquette factory came into production (1956), the SEC announced a new, much larger power station - Hazelwood Power Station, was to be built to the south of the Morwell Open Cut. On Boxing Day 2003 a fire destroyed the coal cross-over conveyor that fed B, C & D briquette plants. Following the fire, only A plant continued in operation, effectively operating at 1/8th of intended capacity until closure. The Briquette Factory was taken off for the last time in August 2014. The last boiler and turbine in the power station was taken off on 8 September 2014. Around 75 people lost their jobs not including many more employees that were not directly employed by the Briquette Factory and Power Station. In its heyday the \\"Morwell Briquette and Power\\" as it was then known employed around 1000 people and the power station was designed to be what's known as an \\"Island Station\\", which meant it could be used to supply power needed to run start up plant at other power stations in the area if for some reason they all were temporarily shut down. Privatisation The power station and briquette works were split from the SECV in November 1993, when former Morwell Briquette and Power division was established as a government business enterprise named Energy Brix Australia. At the time of the split, the plant employed 370 people, and exported of briquettes to Germany, Slovenia, Korea, Japan, New Zealand and Cyprus. Energy Brix Australia was sold on 4 August 1996. In February 2006 a licence was granted to the company for the retail sale of electricity from its plant. Process Heat was reclaimed from the turbine bled steam produced by electricity generation, and used to dry brown coal from up to 65% moisture down to 10% for use in coal briquettes manufactured on the site for both domestic consumption and export. The Energy Brix power station has five steam turbines with a combined generation capacity of . The power station sourced raw brown coal for briquette production via train from the Yallourn and Loy Yang open cut mines, and it's steaming coal for power generation from the Morwell open cut mine. Carbon Monitoring for Action estimates this power station emits of greenhouse gases each year as a result of burning coal. The Australian Government has announced the introduction of a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme commencing in 2010 to help combat climate change. It is expected to impact on emissions from power stations. The National Pollutant Inventory provides details of other pollutant emissions, but, as at 23 November 2008, not CO2.

The first Meneely bell foundry was established in 1826 in West Troy (now Watervliet), New York, by Andrew Meneely, a former apprentice in the foundry of Benjamin Hanks. Two of Andrew's sons continued to operate the foundry after his death, and it remained a family operation until its closure. The second Meneely bell foundry was established in 1870 by a third son, Clinton H. Meneely, across the river in Troy, New York. Initially he was in partnership with George H. Kimberly, under the name Meneely & Kimberly; this second foundry was reorganized in 1879 as the Clinton H. Meneely Bell Company, then later as the Meneely Bell Company. Like its related competitor, it remained a family operation until its closure. Business cards for both of the competing Meneely bell foundries appearing in the Troy Daily Times May 20, 1891 The two foundries competed vigorously (and sometimes bitterly) with each other.

During World War II the old station was torn down. Because of the shortage of metal, the old bronze bell was sold to an office of the Anniston Scrap Materials Company, located in Rome, Georgia. Eventually, the Rome office was closed and all the inventory from the scrap metal company was moved to Anniston, Alabama. There, a supervisor noticed the bell with its inscription and date of 1870, and sent a message back to the Rome fire department by the driver of a bread truck, stating that the old bell from the fire department had not been destroyed as yet. Back at the fire station in Rome, Raymond Bennett, veteran firefighter, showed interest and drove all the way to Anniston, Alabama to find out about the bell. The supervisor at the Anniston Scrap Metal Materials Company said that if anybody was interested to make the drive all the way from Rome, Georgia to Anniston, Alabama, then he could have the bell free of charge. Raymond Bennett paid only the shipping charges of $4.89 to have the 750 pound bell shipped to Rome a week later. The bell hung in Bennett's yard for approximately 10 years in Rome, Georgia. That was in the mid-1940s, during World War II. In 1956, Raymond Bennett moved to New Smyrna Beach, Florida and took the bell with him, where it sat mounted in his front yard for another 30 years. Upon his death, the bell was then moved to Sanford, Florida for approximately 20 years in the backyard of his son's home, that of William (Bill) Bennett. In 2006, William's son, William David Bennett moved from Brazil, South America where he was a missionary with his family, to Trenton, Georgia.

It was released on August 22, 2006 through Immortal Records. The album debuted at #176 on the Billboard 200 chart.

Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court, unanimously ruling that the First Amendment right to free speech did not forbid states from banning the sale of material depicting children engaged in sexual activity, even if the material was not obscene. Procedural background New York had an obscenity law that made it illegal for an individual to \\"promote any performance which includes sexual conduct by a child less than sixteen years of age.\\" Paul Ferber, an owner of an adult bookstore in Manhattan, was charged under the law after he sold an undercover police officer two films depicting young boys masturbating. He was charged with promoting both obscene sexual performances and indecent sexual performances. At trial, he was acquitted of the obscene sexual performance count but he was convicted of the indecent sexual performance count, and the conviction was affirmed by the intermediate appellate court. The New York Court of Appeals overturned the conviction, finding the obscenity law unconstitutional under the First Amendment because the law was both underinclusive as to other films of dangerous activity, and overbroad as to its application to materials produced out-of-state and non-obscene materials. The Court's decision The Court upheld the constitutionality of New York's obscenity law, ruling that it did not violate the First Amendment, and reversed and remanded the case. For a long time before the decision, the Court had ruled that the First Amendment allowed the regulation of obscenity. Under the Court's previous decision in Miller v. California, , material is \\"obscene\\" if, taken as a whole and applying contemporary community standards, it lacks serious scientific, literary, artistic, or political value, is \\"patently offensive\\" and aimed at \\"prurient interests\\". The court in Ferber found that child pornography, however, may be banned without first being deemed obscene under Miller for five reasons: # The government has a very compelling interest in preventing the sexual exploitation of children. # Distribution of visual depictions of children engaged in sexual activity is intrinsically related to the sexual abuse of children. The images serve as a permanent reminder of the abuse, and it is necessary for government to regulate the channels of distributing such images if it is to be able to eliminate the production of child pornography. # Advertising and selling child pornography provides an economic motive for producing child pornography. # Visual depictions of children engaged in sexual activity have negligible artistic value. # Thus, holding that child pornography is outside the protection of the First Amendment is consistent with the Court's prior decisions limiting the banning of materials deemed \\"obscene\\" as the Court had previously defined it. For this reason, child pornography need not be legally obscene before being outlawed.

Although COA programs vary by congregation, they typically mark the individual's transition from younger religious education programs into a youth group, District- level/Regional Young Religious Unitarian Universalists (YRUU), as well as National and Continental-level YRUU. Not all youth will enter into all of the levels of programming above, though entering into at least congregational- level YRUU (Youth group) is very common. At least one of the UUA districts holds a series of COA retreats to supplement congregational COA programs. In most programs, a congregation's youth (usually aged 12 and above) are paired with adult mentors who are members of the congregation. Many programs ask youth to investigate their personal spirituality with the support of their mentors. Youth participants in the program are encouraged to develop a greater sense of what they believe. They do this through discussion, listening to guest speakers, and participating in retreats and workshops. Workshops may be designed to prompt the youth, challenge their modes of thinking, or aid them in furthering their ideas. Some congregations have also encouraged or required each child and mentor to do a social action or social service project together, or organized a service project which all participating youth and mentors do together, such as cooking and serving food at a soup kitchen. At the end of many COA programs, youth and their mentors prepare a service in which they present \\"faith statements\\" or \\"credo statements\\"  written statements of belief and perspectives developed over the course of program. These statements vary in many ways, because there are few \\"guidelines\\" as to what youth may say. Typically, participants who do not wish to present a credo statement may communicate their findings in other ways; for example a choreographed dance or a musical piece they have written. Services vary from church to church and can involve almost anything that the participants want it to. Favorite hymns, dances, songs, and readings may be included. For the most part, children identify with the faith beliefs of their parents and family.

Overview Late night anime is targeted towards Otaku from teens to adult audiences. One of the purposes of the late night broadcast is to promote DVDs or associated merchandise that are planned for release in the future. Other than original stories, many anime are based on manga, novels, or video games. The genres that tend to be preferred by anime fans include romantic comedy, slice of life story, action, or sci-fi, but there are exceptions. Most series are broadcast for 3 months or 6 months with 12 to 13 episodes for each block of 3 months. With the exception of NTV programs, few titles have longer than these broadcast times. In most cases, a production committee (a group of several related companies) buys a time slot from a TV station. This process is known as brokered programming, and is similar to how infomercials are broadcast. Therefore, unlike ordinary programs, production companies are sponsoring companies as well. This way, TV stations can fill the time slots with low viewership, while production companies can advertise their products (anime DVDs) at a lower cost. Since a production‚Äôs purpose is to promote the title to fans, low ratings or a lack of sponsors is of little concern. Consequently, the number of late night anime is increasing. The fact that they rely on the sales of DVDs means that these anime are virtually the same as OVAs, except that they get a chance to be promoted. This is why \\"pure\\" OVA series have decreased rapidly. Differences between TV and DVD versions When a late night anime is released on video or DVD, it tends to have the contents altered or expanded, such as: *Improved animation quality *Scenes uncensored *Completely new videos added, such as side stories or epilogues Extras, like commentaries by the cast or production staff may also be added. Such alteration often happens for television series, but this tendency is especially prominent for late night anime, because: *Production companies may not have enough time, or a large enough budget, to make a higher quality series in time for television transmission, *They often may want to include sexual or violent content that are restricted for broadcast on television. *They have to add value for the DVD release, since they mainly rely on DVD sales. Broadcast area As of July 2006, there are 67 late night titles being broadcast, out of 95 total anime titles. This number includes those broadcast by satellite and UHF stations as well. However, not all are broadcast nationwide. Tokyo, for instance, has 49 late night anime series being broadcast. In Okinawa, only 3 of them are on the air. In many cases, the title is broadcast only in the area of the station producing the anime (which, in most cases, is Tokyo). In other cases, they are only broadcast in Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya. UHF anime tends to be broadcast in Osaka, Nagoya, and Kant≈ç region, but not in Tokyo. There are some titles that are broadcast nationwide, but such cases are the exception, not the rule. In other areas, variety shows with local tarento are often popular, making anime's entry difficult. This is especially the case in Hokkaid≈ç, where Yo Oizumi and his program are extremely popular. If a household has access to CS satellite or cable television, the situation becomes a little better, because anime oriented pay CS satellite stations such as Kids Station, Animax, or AT-X broadcast many of those titles. However, their broadcastings are often weeks or months behind the first run. Moreover, satellite and cable television are not as common in Japan when compared to the United States. However, this situation is changing thanks to the increase of households which can watch BS satellite broadcasting. In November 2011, about 72 percent of Japanese can watch principal BS satellite broadcasting without charge such as BS11, BS-TBS, BS Fuji and BS TV Tokyo.BS„Éá„Ç∏„Çø„É´ÊîæÈÄÅË¶ñËÅ¥ÂèØËÉΩ‰∏ñÂ∏Ø„ÅÆÂâ≤Âêà„ÅØ72„Éª3%ÔºùBS„Éá„Ç∏„Çø„É´Ê∞ëÊîæ6Á§æ„Åå„ÄåBS‰∏ñÂ∏ØÊôÆÂèäÁéáË™øÊüª ÈÄ£ÂêàÈÄö‰ø°.com As a result, the number of UHF anime broadcast by BS11 is increasing, and in 2012, BS11 broadcasts most of them. Moreover, BS11 broadcasts late night anime less than 8 days behind the first run. As to major network stations, since 2001, BS-TBS (previously called BS-i) has broadcast most TBS's anime though it didn't broadcast K-On!! which was broadcast by all JNN terrestrial broadcasting stations, and from 2006 to 2012, BS Fuji had broadcast most Fuji TV's late night anime. However, in 2013, BS Fuji stopped broadcasting Fuji TV's late night anime, and BS Japan (now known as BS TV Tokyo) which is a subsidiary of TV Tokyo seldom broadcasts TV Tokyo's anime. History The earliest late night anime titles include Sennin Buraku (1963‚Äì1964), ' (1987), and ' (1992). All of them were transmitted on Fuji TV. Sennin Buraku was from the longest running manga ever, still published in an adult magazine called Weekly Asahi Gein≈ç. Lemon Angel was an adult anime that is a spin-off of the adult OVA Cream Lemon. Super Zugan was from a manga about mahjong. Those titles received some attention, but remained single experimental programs. The title considered to be the true pioneer of late night anime is Those Who Hunt Elves (1996) on TV Tokyo. At the time, several late night radio talk shows hosted by various voice actors were popular. As a genre, those programs were called \\"aniraji\\", the abbreviation of anime and rajio (radio). TV producers thought that if anime-related radio programs on late night can be popular, then anime television programs on late night should work too. The result turned out as they wished. Because of this, TV Tokyo continued their late night time slots. In 1997, the time slots were expanded, and they became the basis of the \\"late night anime\\" that we now know. At the time, following the immense success of Neon Genesis Evangelion, the number of produced anime rapidly increased. Many of those titles came to late night slots. Nippon TV also started their late night anime with Berserk. In 1998, Fuji TV restarted their late night anime. Also, BS satellite station WOWOW started their block with the complete version of Cowboy Bebop which had been incompletely broadcast in TV Tokyo's evening time slot. The first UHF late night anime, Legend of Basara, started that year as well. However, the true rise of UHF anime came with Comic Party (2001). In 2001, BS digital station BS-i began their time slot with Mahoromatic, making the cute title one of its killer contents. In 2002, Fuji TV increased the number of programs that they broadcast. However, they did not value the otherwise filler programs with nearly zero ratings. Schedules of their late night anime became extremely unstable. For instance, when a program was on air at 2:25 A.M., the next week it was on air at 1:55 A.M. The week after, it was not broadcast, and the next week, 2 episodes were shown at 3:05 A.M. An extreme case was the last week of Kanon, for which they broadcast the last 3 episodes in a marathon. Anime fans heavily criticized this attitude, and production companies began to avoid broadcasting on Fuji TV. The number of late night anime on Fuji TV has decreased, and in October 2004, it completely disappeared. However, from April 2005, they started the time block called Noitamina, the block aimed for a young adult female audience, who otherwise would not watch anime. However, non-Noitamina anime, such as Mushishi, still do not get a proper screening. Late night anime with adults as the target demographic has caused a rise in sales of anime shows to television stations in Japan in recent years. This type of anime is less popular outside Japan, being considered \\"more of a niche product\\". Current tendencies of the major nationwide networks ;NHK General, NHK Educational :NHK is the only public broadcasting station in Japan. They don't usually broadcast late night anime on Weekdays, except for reruns. However, they broadcast late night anime on Sunday nights. ;NTV :They mainly show anime designed for non-otaku audiences, but the titles still appeal to anime fans as well. Also, they aired titles with many episodes, such as Monster or later episodes of Hunter √ó Hunter. Their anime programs nowadays air on Tuesday nights under the AnichU block. Until recently, they aired late night anime on Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday nights. ;TV Asahi :They used to rarely air late-night anime, most recent of which are From the New World and Yuri on Ice. However from April 2020 onwards, they are airing late-night anime again every Saturday night under the NUMAnimation block, starting with Sing \\"Yesterday\\" for Me. ;TBS :It is notable that some of the titles they produce are not broadcast on TBS, but on BS-TBS (a satellite channel affiliated to TBS) or on UHF stations. Their late night anime block (called since April 2018 as Animerico) airs on Thursday nights. ;TV Tokyo :TV Tokyo always had to explore programs for niche audiences. Such genres include financial news, travel, jidaigeki (samurai fiction), outdoors, pets, and anime. Among major network stations, more than half of the anime titles are broadcast on this channel. As such, their late night anime, nowadays usually aired on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Friday and sometimes Thursday nights, are abundant with wide varieties. ;Fuji TV :Other than the Thursday late night Noitamina block, they used to broadcast anime on Friday nights, an example of this would be Assassination Classroom. They also broadcast another anime block called +Ultra that airs every Wednesday nights. ;Tokyo MX :Among Japanese TV networks, they tend to broadcast the most late- night anime. :Three anime titles that are produced by Aniplex air on Saturdays and sometimes will air a show on Wednesday (starting from October 2019) or Friday nights. :There is usually an anime title produced by Toho that airs on Sundays. :There is usually an anime title produced by Bandai that airs on Sundays. :Anime titles that are produced by Warner Bros. typically air on Fridays. :Anime titles that are produced by Kadokawa typically air on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and sometimes, on Sunday nights. :Anime titles that are produced by King Records air on Saturday nights. :Anime titles that are produced by Avex Pictures air on Thursday nights. :Their Anime no Me block used to air on Monday nights, alongside Yomiuri TV, but since the Spring 2018 anime season, it is no longer active. ;MBS :A Kansai-affiliated station of TBS that besides Friday late night block Animeism, also broadcast anime on Saturday nights, such as the first two seasons of Attack on Titan or Blood Blockade Battlefront. Censorship Japanese TV stations do not have a clear detailed system of parental guidelines. The only clear rule is that they cannot show sexual organs. However, they do have many tacit understandings of self-restriction. Bare breasts, for example, are difficult to broadcast on prime time. TV Tokyo once broadcast radical programs such as Evangelion during the evening. However, in 1997, they had \\"Pok√©mon-shock\\", the incident that caused many children to feel ill by watching the Pok√©mon episode that contained many flashing lights. After the incident, TV Tokyo's self- restriction codes became much more strict. Now, TV Tokyo and Fuji TV are said to be extremely strict on sexual descriptions. Naked bodies are censored, and female underwear is censored as well. Even when a female character with a mini-skirt jumps, her skirt does not whip, which is often ridiculed by fans. These censorships on VHFs have become one of the primary reasons of the rise of UHF anime. Outside Japan Late night anime are also distributed worldwide, but a lot of titles do not make it into the airwaves and are only available in DVD, Blu-ray or legal Internet streaming releases. Anime series which have been aired at late night in Japan may be aired at more convenient times in other countries, be it on free-to-air or paid channels such as Anime Network or Animax. In the United States, Cartoon Network relaunched their then-defunct Toonami block as a part of its nighttime programming block Adult Swim on May 26, 2012‚Äîwhich continues as a late night Saturday anime action block from its forerunner, Midnight Run. The Toonami relaunch on Adult Swim was itself a rebranding of Adult Swim Action, which was also a late night Saturday block that primarily ran action anime, although with a much shorter block schedule that would typically be around three hours long on average. Some mainstream titles which are aired either at daytime or prime-time in Japan may end up in late-night slots overseas due to stricter local television regulation. Examples include popular titles such as Bleach and Fullmetal Alchemist which were aired in the evenings in Japan, but at late night in the United States. In Hong Kong, Dragon Ball Z was deemed as \\"mature\\" and aired in the weekend midnight slot, although it was considered appropriate for young viewers elsewhere in the world including Japan, the Philippines, and the US. Due to the controversial nature of Death Note, Philippine anime channel Hero aired it near midnight, and only on weekends, with no rerun schedules. They use the same scheme when they started airing censored versions of titles with ecchi, like Date A Live and The Fruit of Grisaia. Rise of UHF anime In Kant≈ç region including Tokyo, the major nationwide network stations broadcast on analog on the VHF channels . The \\"independent\\" stations established to provide prefecture-specific programming broadcast on the UHF channels. They are members of the Japanese Association of Independent Television Stations. In Osaka the situation is similar with exception of TV Osaka. (Note that all the Japanese terrestrial television have switched to UHF digital.) However, because these UHF stations are obscure, they do not have strong restrictions. Also, their time slots were much cheaper than those of VHF stations. Avoiding strict restrictions by a nationwide television network, and avoiding random scheduling by Fuji TV, many anime, especially those with a lot of fan service, began to be broadcast on UHF stations. This even more obscure method still proved to be fairly effective, and UHF anime time slots continued to expand, especially from 2001. In 2006, if UHF stations are to be treated as one network (which they are not), it now broadcasts the largest number of late night anime (16), even more than TV Tokyo (8). However, many shows suffer from lower budgets compared with VHF shows. Because of loose self-restriction codes, many of the titles contain sexual or violent expression that is impossible to broadcast on VHF stations. Examples include Rizelmine and . (The latter title, however, was still heavily edited.) Nevertheless, as UHF anime continue to expand, they recently have more varieties. Sh≈çjo titles such as are now also broadcast. , a show which can be watched by young children, is a UHF late night anime, too. As became a huge hit, UHF late night anime has lost the \\"cheapest, but the most obscure option\\" description. Similar tendencies can be seen in other channels as well, such as WOWOW, BS-TBS, and CS channels on SkyPerfecTV!. It is notable that AT-X, a pay-channel on SkyPerfecTV!, broadcast Elfen Lied unedited. It is on WOWOW and BS-i, as well as other CS channels that the rest of Asia who can receive their signal gets a view of these UHF anime.

It was opened on 3 September 1883 by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) closed eighty years later and is currently used as an aggregates depot. The Bluebell Railway owns the trackbed from just east of the station to Horsted Keynes and has long-term plans to rebuild the line. History = Opening and route = The LBSCR opened a 4¬Ω-mile link line between Horsted Keynes on its Lewes to East Grinstead Line and Haywards Heath on the Brighton Main Line. Doubled throughout, the line curved away from Horsted Keynes over Sheriff Mill Viaduct (117 yards and named after the nearby Lower Sheriff Farm), climbing on a gradient to reach Lywood Tunnel (218 yards) before continuing on the level for nearly 2 miles to reach the line's only intermediate station at Ardingly. From Ardingly, the line continued for a further mile to reach Copyhold Junction on the Brighton Line, just south of the Ouse Valley Viaduct. At first there was no signal box at the junction, with services running on an independent line parallel to the Brighton Main Line as far as the north-facing bay platform at Haywards Heath. A box was installed in 1912 which remained in use until 1932 when Haywards Heath was rebuilt with up and down loop platforms, and a new box brought into service there.Marx, K., p. 209. The line opened without ceremony, with the first service, a goods train, leaving Haywards Heath at 8.34am to collect freight at Ardingly and continue to Horsted Keynes.Marx, K., p. 68. It was later to prove its worth as a useful alternative to the Brighton Main Line in both wars and for specials to Lingfield Racecourse.Marx, K., p. 212. = Station building and facilities = Designed by Thomas Harrison Myres, the main station building was sited at road level away from the platforms. In common with other Lewes and East Grinstead line stations, it was constructed in a neo-Queen Anne style and presented as a two-storey Victorian country cottage. The upper storey is decoratively timbered with plaster patterning (flower patterns in black on a white background) and projecting slightly;Marx, K., p. 57-58. unlike the other stations on the line, Ardingly was never tile-hung. The station's two platforms had fairly basic facilities with platform awnings and an alcove-like waiting room on the down platform; a platform signal cabin was to be found at the western end of the station, overseeing a small goods yard. The yard saw considerable inward traffic in the form of timber for a local sawmill which was subsequently dispatched back out in consignments of prepared boards. The station was run by a staff of four: the stationmaster, signal porter, porter and assistant clerk; the last stationmaster left in 1926, at which point Ardingly came under the control of Horsted Keynes.Marx, K., p. 209-211. = Operations = The Ardingly branch had a very infrequent service under the LBSCR and following the grouping when the Southern Railway took over the line when it was mainly serviced by push-pull trains, with some through services to and from Brighton.Marx, K., p. 123. Following electrification in 1935, the new electric service comprised some 18 trains on an hourly service to and from Horsted Keynes daily, around half of which terminated at Haywards Heath whilst the rest ran as far as Seaford.Marx, K., p. 213. The Ardingly branch was closed on Sundays until 1945, and the connection from the up Ardingly line to the up Horsted Keynes main platform was severed.Marx, K., p. 185. Camping coaches were stationed at Ardingly from Summer 1930 until the end of the war, an acknowledgment of Ardingly's popularity amongst ramblers who were ferried to and from the station in special trains.Marx, K., pp. 161 and 212. The station was also busy at the beginning and end of term at Ardingly College when up to 450 packages of luggage were sent and received for around 250 pupils. = Closure = After the closure of the Lewes to East Grinstead line in 1958 by British Railways (BR), the down line between Horsted Keynes and Ardingly was used as a siding for condemned Kent Coast steam stock and new electric stock, whilst single line working with electric train staff was introduced on the up line.Marx, K., p. 189. The branch was itself closed on 28 October 1963. The section was however still used occasionally to transport rolling stock to the newly established Bluebell Railway, and the last movement along the line was recorded on 13 May 1964 when Terrier No 32636 passed through prior to lifting of the track. The lifting, which had commenced on 15 July, had reached Horsted Keynes by 21 September. During the summer of 1968, Sheriff Mill Viaduct was demolished as the Mid Sussex District Council wished to straighten the bend on New Lane as it curved under the viaduct; BR was only too happy to relieve itself of the maintenance costs of the structure.Marx, K., p. 215-216. The Bluebell Railway had been invited to purchase the line in 1962, but could not afford BR's asking price of between ¬£25,000-¬£30,000 together with the ¬£10,000 needed to maintain the viaduct.Marx, K., p. 249.  Present day  An Amey Roadstone plant (now Hanson AggregatesBusiness Directory.) was established in the Ardingly goods yard shortly after closure of the line, and was served by a daily freight working from Haywards Heath using the former down local line. Access to the up main and up local lines at Copyhold Junction has been severed. The new occupant demolished the station platforms (except for a short length near the road bridge). The track in the station was removed and a loop installed at the southern end of the former goods yard area. The station buildings remain, used as offices by Hanson Aggregates. A pair of ornamental cast iron station canopy brackets and the ticket office window were sold as lots 302 and 303 by auctioneers T. Bannister & co. at their July 1983 auction at the Ardingly historic vehicle spectacular show at the South of England Showground. = Preservation future = In 1997 the Heritage Bluebell Railway acquired the trackbed, only as far as the Aggregate Depot boundary at Ardingly, and holds long-term aspirations to painstakingly restore and reopen the branch. To help bridge the gap created by the missing (Sheriff Mill) viaduct, spoil from the excavation of Imberhorne cutting (part of the works necessary for the Bluebell's extension to East Grinstead) was used to extend existing embankments, towards Ardingly.Bluebell Railway, \\"Horsted Keynes Re-Signalling Archive of Progress 3 (2004/5)\\". Re- signalling work had also taken place at Horsted Keynes, with signals being installed in preparation for the eventual re-laying of the track.Bluebell Railway, \\"Extending the Bluebell Railway\\", 12 July 2008. Mid Sussex District Council has accordingly safeguarded the route of the line from re-development that would be prejudicial to its reinstatement.Mid Sussex District Council, Local Plan, para. 17.18.

In comparison with the B and A soprano clarinets, the clarinet d'amore had a similar shape and construction, but was larger, usually pitched in G. (Examples in A and F are also known.) However, it had proportionally smaller tone holes and bore, and a pear-shaped or sometimes globular bell (called 'Liebesfu√ü') similar to that of the cor anglais; these features gave the instrument its distinctive timbre. It first appeared around the middle of the 18th century and was popular in central Europe, but was regarded as obsolete by the mid 19th century.

She was given the title \\"Asia's Sweetest Voice\\" because of her sweet voice. She was dubbed \\"the Karen Carpenter of the Philippines\\" as her voice has a striking resemblance to that of the late singer. Her first album in 1977 was then the Philippines' biggest ever seller. She went on to record seven more albums. Besides \\"Sayang\\", she is also known for hits like \\"Minsan-Minsan\\" and \\"Nakaw Na Pag- ibig\\". She was given the title \\"Queen of Tagalog Songs\\" alongside Rico J. Puno as her counterpart. She was also named \\"Jukebox Queen\\" together with her contemporaries Imelda Papin, Eva Eugenio and the late Didith Reyes, and was also dubbed as \\"Asia's Sweetest Voice\\". She is also a successful businesswoman. She is the president of the Integrated Metropolitan Bus Operators Association (IMBOA), though her bus franchise was cancelled in 2011 for joining a nationwide transport strike. Biography De la Fuente was 15 when she won the grand prize in the first singing contest she joined, singing The Carpenters' \\"Love Me for What I Am\\". By that time, the Accounting freshman at the University of the East knew she loved singing and was aware that she sounded like Karen Carpenter after a high school classmate had pointed it out. Composer George Canseco, a fellow UE Alumni, and the head judge in the contest, gave the singer her first break by having her sing the jingle in a Hope cigarette commercial that became popular for its \\"imported\\" sound. De la Fuente left show business in her mid-20s after reaping its financial rewards. She was married by that time, having tied the knot at 19 to a man 10 years her senior. In 1993, she set up the King of Kings Transport, which had to fold up a few years later. It wasn't the lucrative business she had hoped it would be. Six years later, de la Fuente was elected president of the Integrated Metro Bus Operators Association (IMBOA), whose members make up 70 percent of all bus operators in Metro Manila. In 2003, de la Fuente made headlines when she spearheaded a boycott of the color-coding scheme that the MMDA had imposed for a week on all public utility vehicles as part of a traffic experiment. The move put her at odds with the equally headstrong MMDA Chairman Bayani Fernando.From songbird to transport leader In 2003, de la Fuente went back to school to study transportation management at PUP then went ahead and finished a Masters in Business Administration at the University of Western Australia in 2005. Besides being the spokesperson of the entire Public Transportation industry, she has become a very successful businesswoman. She dabbled into the cosmetics industry, opening up The Skin Shop. Alongside this, she showcased her flair for culinary arts and opened Gracielo's and Claire de la Fuente Seafood and Grill. In December 2006, her husband and best friend for more than 28 years, Moises (Boy) de Guzman, died after a five-month struggle with cancer. He left behind de la Fuente together with their two sons, Gregorio (Gigo) and Gracielo (Mickey). In 2008, she teamed up with Richard Carpenter for her international album Something In Your Eyes. In 2010, she recorded a duet with Michael Bolton, \\"The Christmas Song\\". The duet was included on her The Christmas Album under Viva Records.

The AOU for example advocates this separation.SACC (2007) Description The adult cinnamon becard is 5.5 in (14 cm) long and weighs 0.6‚Äì0.8 oz (17‚Äì22 g). It is rufous above and paler cinnamon below, with a grey bill and legs. Unlike other becards, the sexes are similar, but the young are brighter above and paler overall. Northern birds have a pale supercilium and dusky line from the bill to the eye, but the subspecies Pachyramphus cinnamomeus magdalenae west of the Andes shows more contrast, with a stronger supercilium and blackish loral line. The calls include high thin whistles. The males' song is a plaintive ascending dee dee dee dee dee dee de while the females' is a weaker deeeu dew dew, dew dew. Distribution and habitat The cinnamon becard is a resident breeding species from south-eastern Mexico south to north-western Ecuador and north-western Venezuela. It was recently found to be far more common on the Amazonian slope of the Colombian Cordillera Oriental than previously believed.Salaman et al. (2002) It occurs over a wide range of altitudes, from almost sea level to (albeit rarely) more than 5,000 ft (1,700 m) ASL; they prefer disturbed habitat like open woodland including forest edges and clearings, mangroves, and secondary forest e.g. dominated by Naked Albizia (Albizia carbonaria, Fabaceae). Behaviour =Breeding= The nest, built by the female at the tip of a high tree branch 8‚Äì50 ft (2.5‚Äì15 m) up, is a spherical structure of plant material with a low entrance, which for protection is often built near a wasp nest. The typical clutch is 3‚Äì4 olive brown-blotched brownish white eggs, laid between March and July and incubated by the female alone for 18‚Äì20 days to hatching. The male helps to feed the young. =Feeding= Cinnamon becards pick large insects and spiders off the foliage in flight. They also regularly hover to take small berries.

He was the father of American artist Philip Evergood.  Biography  Evergood was born Myer Blashki in Melbourne, eleventh child of Phillip Blashki, manufacturer of masonic regalia and jeweller, and his wife Hannah, n√©e Immergut. Evergood was educated at the Melbourne Hebrew Day School and Angel College, later crediting his ability to write and to argue to influential teachers there, especially Rev. Jacob Goldstein. Goldstein in 1908 wrote a front-page article about Evergood in the New York Hebrew Standard. He studied at the National Gallery School of Art under Frederick McCubbin and Bernard Hall between 1893 and 1895. His friends and colleagues were the group who exhibited the first recognisable style of Australian painting. They included Max Meldrum, George Coates, and James Quinn, who formed themselves into bohemian clubs to discuss contemporary concerns like socialism and the rights of the individual. Evergood exhibited at the Victorian Artists Society, and the Royal Art Society of New South Wales, Sydney, before leaving for the United States in 1898 together with fellow-artist Frank (Francis) McComas. He worked for the Hearst newspapers in San Francisco before moving on to New York City, where he exhibited and was subsequently invited to be a member of both the Salamgundi and Lotos Clubs. He went to London, where he married Flora Jane Perry, whom he had probably met in Sydney. The family moved to New York, where art critics Henri Pene du Bois and James Huneker wrote glowingly of his works. as did Hanna Astrup Larsen in the glossy journal International Studio. Miles and Flora had one child, named Philip Howard Francis Dixon Blashki (1901-1973). In 1910 Miles exhibited five paintings in the first exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists held in New York. For about twenty years he regularly visited Europe, establishing a good reputation as a painter. After returning with the family to live in England in 1910. in 1914 he his landscape was hung the Paris Salon. For eight years he exhibited with the International Society, at Burlington House, with the Society of Painters and 'Gravers and the New English Arts Club. He changed his name to Miles Evergood about 1914 in London, to enable his son Philip to get a commission in the British Navy. Then-Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill wrote a handwritten reply to his query, suggesting that \\"Blashki\\" was not a suitable name for an officer in an Anglo Saxon navy. Evergood returned to Australia in July 1931 and worked for eighteen months in Queensland and became a member of the Royal Queensland Art Society. He then went to Sydney and then Melbourne holding exhibitions of his work, and died of cancer in Melbourne on 3 January 1939. Evergood was a capable artist, who mostly painted landscapes in oil with affinities to the post impressionists. He left a de facto partner, Pauline Konitzer Romero, and his son, Philip Evergood, who became an artist living in America, substantially eclipsing the career of his father Miles.

However, Randwick City Council and the then Minister for Planning intervened and a Permanent Conservation Order was imposed on The Ritz building in March, 1993. The current owners refurbished the building in the late 1990s, adding additional cinemas to the original single principal cinema theatre in order to allow The Ritz to survive in the era of competition with larger multiplex cinema chains. In 1997, The Ritz Cinema was placed on the Register of the National Estate by the Australian Heritage Council.Cinema Treasures entry for The Ritz, accessed on 8 May 2009.

Early life and education  Ewart was born in Toxteth Park, Liverpool, England, second son of Edmund Brown Ewart, B.A. and his wife, Martha n√©e Williams. He was educated at the Liverpool Institute and University College, Liverpool, then graduated with a Ph.D. from Leipzig University and D.Sc. from Oxford.  Career  Ewart was a demonstrator of botany at Liverpool, and subsequently Science Master at King Edward's School, Birmingham, and lecturer on botany at Birmingham University, where he was for a time deputy professor. In 1905 Ewart was appointed Professor of Botany at the University of Melbourne. He had already completed a laborious and useful piece of work, his translation of Wilhelm Pfeffer's treatise on The Physiology of Plants, the first volume of which was published in 1900, the second in 1903, and the third in 1906. He had also published First Stage Botany (1900), New Matriculation Botany (1902), of which many impressions were subsequently published under the title Ewart's Elementary Botany; On the Physics and Physiology of Protoplasmic Streaming in Plants (1903), and Rural Calendar (1905). In 1906, Ewart became the foundation chair of botany and plant physiology at the University of Melbourne. For the next 15 years Ewart was also the government botanist. In 1909, in collaboration with James Richard Tovey, who conducted the field research, he published a useful work on The Weeds, Poison Plants and Naturalized Aliens of Victoria, and in 1917, in collaboration with Miss Olive B. Davies. The Flora of the Northern Territory. At the university Ewart had no separate building and for many years shared the biology school building with Sir Baldwin Spencer. After World War I a separate department for botany was built. In 1927 Ewart was asked by the government to prepare a new Flora of Victoria which, with some assistance from other scientists, was completed and published in 1930. Other works not already mentioned include a Handbook of Forest Trees for Victorian Foresters (1925), and many papers in scientific journals, some of which were reprinted as pamphlets. Ewart was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1922. Ewart was president of Section D (Biology) of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Melbourne in 1921, and of Section M (Botany) at Perth in 1926.

Early life and family  Carlebach was the eighth child of Esther Adler (1853‚Äì1920), the daughter of the former rabbi of L√ºbeck, Rabbi Alexander Sussmann Adler (1816‚Äì1869), and L√ºbeck's then Rabbi Salomon Carlebach (1845‚Äì1919). In 1919 Joseph Carlebach and his former pupil Charlotte Preuss (1900‚Äì1942) married. They had nine children.  Education and early career  Joseph Carlebach became rabbi, like many of his brothers, to wit David Carlebach, Emanuel Carlebach (rabbi in Memel and Cologne), Hartwig Naftali Carlebach (rabbi in Berlin, Baden near Vienna and New York), and Ephraim Carlebach (rabbi in Leipzig). Joseph Carlebach completed extensive studies in natural sciences. From 1901 on he studied at Friedrich-Wilhelms- Universit√§t in Berlin natural sciences, mathematics, astronomy, philosophy and history of art. The quantum physicist Max Planck and the philosopher Wilhelm Dilthey (hermeneutics) were among his teachers. In 1908 he graduated as high- school teacher (Oberlehrer-Examen) of natural sciences (at summa cum laude). In the same time Carlebach attended the orthodox Rabbinical Seminary in Berlin. In 1905 to 1907 Carlebach interrupted his studies in Germany and taught at the L√§mel-School in Jerusalem. There Carlebach learned to know a number of excellent rabbis. In 1909 Carlebach passed degrees in mathematics, physics and Hebrew at Ruprecht-Karls-Universit√§t in Heidelberg. There he also did his doctorate on the mathematician Levi ben Gershon (Lewi ben Gerson als Mathematiker). Carlebach gained academic reputation by books on Levi ben Gershon as well as on Albert Einstein's relativity theory in 1912. From 1910 to 1914 Carlebach finished his studies at the rabbinical seminary under rabbi David Hoffmann. In 1914 Carlebach was ordained rabbi.  World War I service  During World War I Carlebach served in the imperial German Army, at the beginning as telegraphist. In 1915 he was assigned as educator - after recommendation by his brother-in-law Leopold Rosenak, a German Army Field Rabbi active in promoting German culture among the Jews in Lithuania and Poland during the German occupation (1915‚Äì1918). Erich Ludendorff's intention was to evoke pro-German attitudes among Jews and other Poles and Lithuanians, in order to prepare the installation of a Polish and a Lithuanian state dependent on Germany. Part of the effort was the establishment of Jewish newspapers (e.g. the folkist Warszawer Togblat, ◊ï◊ï◊ê÷∑◊®◊©◊¢◊ï◊ï◊¢◊® ◊ò◊ê÷∏◊í◊ë◊ú◊ê÷∑◊ò), of Jewish organisations (e.g. Joseph's brother German Army Field Rabbi Emanuel Carlebach (*1874-1927*) initiated in ≈Åom≈ºa the foundation of the hassidic umbrella organisation Agudas Yisroel of Poland, part of a non-Zionist movement founded in Germany in 1912) and of modern educational institutions of Jewish alignment. Joseph Carlebach founded the partly German-language J√ºdisches Realgymnasium ◊í◊ô◊û◊†◊ñ◊ô◊ï◊ù ◊¢◊ë◊®◊ô (academic high school) in Kaunas (Kovno; the interwar capital of Lithuania) and directed it until 1919. The school was based on the German Torah im Derech Eretz model. The school provided both Jewish and secular studies both for men and women (separately) and was the model for the Yavneh network that Carlebach later founded in collaboration with Leo Deutschlander. In 1925 Yavneh was taken over by Joseph Leib Bloch (*1860-1930*), who relocated it to Tel≈°iai (Russ.: Telshe, Yidd.: Telz ◊ò◊¢◊ú◊ñ) and incorporated it into the Rabbinical College of Telshe, which managed to re-establish in 1942 in the USA. In 1921 Carlebach became headmaster of the Talmud Torah high school in Hamburg. He served the Jewish communities of L√ºbeck (1919‚Äì22), Altona (1927‚Äì36) and Hamburg (1936‚Äì1941), as chief rabbi. The renowned Israeli jurist Haim Cohn described the effect Carlebach had on his students (as well as illustrating Carlebach's fairly unusual position that Orthodox Jews may visit churches): > He spent a full day with the boys in the Cathedral Cologne, expertly > explaining every detail of the statues, the glass windows, the ornaments, > and the intricacies of the Catholic faith and ritual; but I was not allowed > to participate, being a Cohen who may not be under the same roof with a > corpse or with tombs, lest he become impure; and although, according to the > letter of the Law, it is only the Jewish dead the contact with whom renders > impure, and not the non-Jewish dead, still Carlebach held that the least > possibility that among the dead buried in the cathedral may have been a > person of Jewish origin (even though ultimately converted to Christianity), > sufficed to make the place taboo to me.Haim H. Cohn, \\"Joseph Carlebach,\\" Leo > Baeck Institute Year Book 5 (1960), 66.  Persecution and Murder under Nazi regime  After Nazi Germany banned Jewish students from attending German schools together with \\"Aryan\\" German children, Rabbi Carlebach set up a number of schools throughout Germany to educate Jewish children. His schools bore his name and were known as Carlebach-Schulen. He was deported to the Nazi concentration camp Jungfernhof by the Nazis, where he was murdered on March 26, 1942 during the mass shooting of approximately 1600 Jews, mostly older people and children, that became known as the D√ºnam√ºnde Action. Sabine Niemann (Redaktion): Die Carlebachs, eine Rabbinerfamilie aus Deutschland, Ephraim-Carlebach-Stiftung (Hrsg). D√∂lling und Galitz. Hamburg 1995, S. 83. This occurred in the Biƒ∑erniecki forest, near Riga, Latvia, which was the site of numerous other shootings perpetrated by the Nazis and their Latvian collaborators, in particular, the Arajs Kommando. His wife and younger children were also killed during the Holocaust. Of his surviving children, one son Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach became the mashgiach ruchani (\\"spiritual supervisor\\" [of students]) at the Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin in Brooklyn, New York City after the war, and his third daughter Professor Miriam Gillis-Carlebach emigrated to Israel in October 1938. She taught Education and Hebrew reading at Bar-Ilan University, in Ramat Gan. In 1992 she became the head of the Joseph Carlebach Institute at Bar-Ilan University and has dedicated herself to researching her father's writings as well as the writing of other Jewish leaders of the same time period. Sabine Niemann (Redaktion): Die Carlebachs, eine Rabbinerfamilie aus Deutschland, Ephraim-Carlebach-Stiftung (Hrsg). D√∂lling und Galitz. Hamburg 1995, S. 92-3 Rabbi Joseph Carlebach's wife managed to send her elder children to England, and they survived the war. 150px  Commemoration and legacy  Commemorative tablet in Hamburg-Altona with a portrait of Carlebach On 18 August 1954 Jerusalem honoured Carlebach's work, among others at the local L√§mel-School, by naming a street, Rekhov Carlebach/Karlibakh ◊®◊ó◊ï◊ë ◊ß◊®◊ú◊ô◊ë◊ö, after him in the neighbourhood of Talpiot. The memory of Joseph Carlebach is held in great honor by the City of Hamburg and its Jewish community. In 1990, part of the University Campus, the Bornplatz, the former location of the Main Synagogue of Hamburg and Carlebach's last pulpit, was named as the \\"Joseph-Carlebach- Platz\\". In honor of his 120th Birthday in 2003, the \\"Joseph-Carlebach-Preis\\" (Joseph Carlebach prize) for Jewish studies was established, awarded every two years, by the State University of Hamburg.

He was born and died in Frankfurt am Main. Life Emil Carlebach was descended from a family of rabbis who had practiced in Germany for generations. However, at the time he was born, his father was the only non-religious member of the Carlebach family in Frankfurt. While still young, Emil turned away from the conservative secular attitude of his parents and in 1932 he joined the Young Communist League of Germany (Kommunistischer Jugendverband Deutschlands) KJVD.Biographical timeline of Emil Carlebach Website about Hameln by historian Bernhard Gelderblom. Retrieved March 31, 2010 Registration card of Emil Carlebach as a prisoner at Buchenwald Nazi Concentration Camp In early 1934, he was sentenced to three years in prison for spreading anti-fascist union publications. When the sentence was completed in 1937, he was sent to Dachau concentration camp and then imprisoned at Buchenwald in 1938. At Buchenwald, he was active in the illegal resistance organization. Following plans he designed, he launched \\"with the call to mutiny on 4 April 1945.\\" He was to have been shot by the SS on 6 April 1945, for his efforts in the camp revolt, but was hidden by other prisoners and survived till liberation. After the liberation of the concentration camp, the prisoners from Buchenwald chose him as their spokesman; later he became the vice-president of the International Buchenwald Committee. After 1954, he became first a Frankfurt city council member, then a member of the Hessian parliament, where he worked on the Hesse constitution. Carlebach was one of seven original licensees of the Frankfurter Rundschau, a licensed daily newspaper based in Frankfurt and the first licensed newspaper in the American Zone of Occupation in Germany. In 1947, without explanation, the U.S. Military Government in Germany revoked Carlebach's publisher's license. He was also a co-founder of the Union of Persecutees of the Nazi Regime (Vereinigung der Verfolgten des Naziregimes) or VVN. In the early 1950s a fierce dispute began between Carlebach and Margarete Buber-Neumann over the torture of German communists by Joseph Stalin in the Soviet Union. Carlebach contested Stalin‚Äôs responsibility; he maintained this position his entire life. In connection with this dispute and later publications, Carlebach‚Äôs conduct towards those Buchenwald prisoners who he did not consider loyal communists was also criticized. Because of this, his former fellow prisoner, Benedikt Kautsky, accused him of being partially responsible for the death of least two Polish prisoners. After the West German Communist Party of Germany (KPD) was banned in 1956, he fled to the Deutsche Demokratische Republik (DDR, East Germany). There he was a staff member for the Deutscher Freiheitssender 904 (German Freedom Radio 904). After his return to the Bundesrepublik Deutschland (BRD, West Germany) he was active in the VVN, the German Communist Party (DKP) and the Deutsche Journalistinnen- und Journalisten-Union (dju, Union of German Journalists) until his death.

Peak's first recording was Time Slipping By from Mark Williamson in 1994, and Sahara by Russ Freeman and the Rippingtons. During the late 1990s, Peak became a fully self-sufficient independent label under Windham Hill/RCA, and the Rippingtons' released Black Diamond to commemorate the then 10-year anniversary of the group. When the label became part of Concord Records, Peak signed saxophonists Paul Taylor and Eric Marienthal, and Regina Belle to the label as well as vocalist Phil Perry. In 2001, Belle released This Is Regina!, which went gold and earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Traditional Soul/R & B Vocal category. Early on, the label put out the Rippingtons' second live recording called Live Across America in 2002, and an album from Gato Barbieri, called The Shadow Of The Cat. LaToya London released an album on Peak Records in September 2005 called Love & Life Others who have released material on the label include former Ambrosia vocalist David Pack and Denver-based contemporary jazz act Dotsero. In 2004, Lazy Afternoon from Regina Belle made No. 9 on the Billboard Smooth Jazz Chart.

Family Lees was born in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, England, the eldest son of William Lees, a cotton farmer and Justice of the Peace, and his wife, Emma (daughter of William Clare). Lees married twice, firstly to Winifred May, daughter of the Revd J. M. Cranswick, and secondly to Joanna Mary, daughter of Herbert Linnell. He had no children. Education Lees was educated at The Leys School (a Methodist school) and St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA with a second class in the theological tripos in 1892, and MA in 1896. Career Lees was ordained deacon in 1893 and priest in 1894. He was a curate at Reading, Berkshire, chaplain at Turin and curate at Childwall, until in 1900 he became vicar of St John's Kenilworth. In 1907 Lees became vicar of Christ Church, Beckenham, and in 1919 vicar of Swansea. In this year he was offered the bishopric of Bendigo, Victoria, Australia, but refused it. In August 1921 he was appointed Archbishop of Melbourne and was consecrated at St Paul's Cathedral, London, on 14 August 1921, and enthroned at St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne, on 15 February 1922. Lees soon showed himself to be a vigorous worker and a good preacher. He was at Melbourne for less than seven years before he died, but his episcopate was marked by the undertaking of the completion of St Paul's Cathedral and by a great increase in the social work of the church; more especially in connexion with the various homes conducted by the mission of St James and St John and the Church of England free kindergartens. He visited England in 1928 and died suddenly at Bishopscourt, East Melbourne, on 10 January 1929. Lees' portrait by John Longstaff is in the chapter house at Melbourne. Lees never spared himself and overwork was a contributing cause of his comparatively early death from coronary vascular disease. He had bright personality and was much like by everyone, whether in an industrial parish like Swansea or as archbishop of Melbourne. At synod he was an excellent chairman, speaking little himself, but giving his rulings with decision. In the evangelistic tradition of the diocese, he belonged to no party and his ability, humanity and broad outlook, made him an excellent leader of his church. Publications Lees' published works include: *St Paul's Epistles to Thessalonica (1905) *The Work of Witness and the Promise of Power (1908) *The Joy of Bible Study (1909) *The King's Highway (1910) *St Paul and his Converts (1910), third impression (1916) *Christ and his Slaves (1911) *The Sunshine of the Good News (1912) *The Divine Master in Home Life (1915) *The Practice of the Love of Christ (1915) *The Eyes of his Glory (1916) *St Paul's Friends (1917) *The Love that Ceases to Calculate (1918) *God's Garden and Ours (1918) *Failure and Recovery (1919) *The Starting Place of Victory (1919) *The Promise of Life The Life that is in Christ Jesus (1919) * The Divine Master in Home Life Lees was also a contributor to Hastings' A Dictionary of Christ and the Gospels.

This society was part of the movement started by the Rochdale Pioneers in 1844, and followed the Rochdale Principles with the aim of providing decent food at affordable prices in a shop controlled by its customers as a co- operative. It took its name from St Cuthbert's Church, Edinburgh. As early as 1913, St. Cuthbert's had bought the Cliftonhall Estate which was almost 970 acres in area. In 1918, four more farms were bought on the Newtonhall Estate and in 1919, 780 acres were purchased at Bonnington, all near Ratho at that time in Midlothian. By 1949 the Association owned over three thousand acres of land. St Cuthbert's expanded to become one of the largest societies in the British co-operative movement, employing some 3,000 at its peak. It had a bakery and a dairy in Fountainbridge. The dairy used horse-drawn delivery floats until 1985, and between 1944 and 1950 employed the future actor Sean Connery as a milkman. The former department store in Bread Street St Cuthbert's had many shops throughout Edinburgh, including a department store in Bread Street which was built in three stages to designs by three architects: John McLachlan in 1892; Thomas P. Marwick in 1898 and 1914 and Thomas Waller Marwick in 1936. The 1930s section features a glass 'curtain wall', the first of its kind in Scotland, in contrast to the stone facades of its late 19th-/early 20th-century neighbours. The store closed in the early 1990s and buildings were converted for use as the Point Hotel and Conference Centre in 1999. In 1981 St Cuthbert's amalgamated with the Dalziel Society of Motherwell being renamed the Scottish Midland Co-op, for short Scotmid.

The ship was delivered to the United States Navy at Charleston, South Carolina, on 30 August 1971. Design Flint is capable of underway replenishment at a sustained speed of 20 knots, which enables her to keep pace with fast-moving naval task forces. Her modern transfer-at-sea facilities included the capability of utilizing two CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters for vertical replenishment (VERTREP). Normal alongside methods were improved by the installation of a ram tension wire system called STREAM - Standard Tensioned Replenishment Alongside Method. Flint's holds were specifically configured for ease of handling, loading and stowing of missiles, rocket boosters, and all types of munitions required by the Fleet. Flint is capable of providing living accommodations for more than 400 men and women. Several new design innovations were incorporated in Flint, including a bulbous bow for better streamlined hull. Another innovation was the APS (Automated Propulsion System) essentially a central console in an air conditioned space in the engine room which gives automatic readings of the performance of the engineering plant and allowed the bridge to directly control the engines. Service history USS Flint was commissioned under the command of Captain Philip R. Bush following extensive sea trials. The ship then made a transit through the Panama Canal to its home port of Naval Weapons Station, Concord, California. Flint made its first Western Pacific (WestPac) deployment in fall of 1972. It participated in numerous underway replenishment activities with ships of the US 7th Fleet in support of military operations off the coast of Vietnam including resupply of gunline destroyers and aircraft carriers participating in Operation Linebacker and Operation Linebacker II. Its helicopter detachment flew hundreds of sorties ferrying munitions to US naval ships in the operational theatre. Captain Bush was relieved as commanding officer by Captain Thomas Rogers in December, 1972. In subsequent deployments in 1973-1974 and 1974‚Äì1975, Flint was assigned to naval forces in the Gulf of Aden in support of operations monitoring the Yom Kippur War, the Vietnam evacuation task force (Operation Frequent Wind) and rescue forces involved in the Mayag√ºez incident. Captain Rogers was relieved as commanding officer by Commander John K. Ferguson in December, 1973. Flint served as ammunition supply ship during operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, 1990 to 1992, under Cmdr. Skirm and Capt. Thompson. A 22-year-old machinist mate lost his life tragically while on board in October 1993. It is the only known death occurring while doing weapons elevator maintenance. Cmdr. John M. MacIntyre of Coronado, California, was the final commanding officer of the ship. The ship was under the operational command of Commander, Logistics Group 1. Flint completed 15 deployments to the western Pacific and received recognition for the dramatic 1978 rescue of 86 fishermen shipwrecked near Palawan Island, Philippines, during a typhoon. Decommissioning and transfer USNS Flint (T-AE-32) in 2007, while deployed as part of the USS Ronald Reagan Carrier Group. Flint was decommissioned at Naval Air Station Alameda, California, on 4 August 1995 after more than 23 years of service. The ship was transferred to the Military Sealift Command, at which time it became known as the USNS Flint (T-AE-32). Under the Military Sealift Command, Flint operated with a smaller civilian crew operating the ship's major systems and a smaller Navy detachment responsible for communications and operational coordination. As an MSC asset, Flint participated in additional deployments to the Western Pacific and Persian Gulf.

Broadcasting career After graduating from the Western Academy Broadcasting College, Dreger was immediately offered a job from a radio station in Winkler, Manitoba. However, in the same day, he was offered another job closer to home, which he accepted. Beginning in 1992, Dreger lent his voice as a play-by-play announcer for the Brandon Wheat Kings. This lasted until 1993 when he was hired to replace Daren Millard at CTV Winnipeg. While there, he also conducted play-by-play for the Manitoba Moose of the American Hockey League. From Winnipeg, Dreger moved to Edmonton in 1997 to report on Edmonton Oilers games and was subsequently hired by Sportsnet as a national host for their NHL package in 1998. Dreger was the former host of Hockey Central on Rogers Sportsnet between 1998 and 2006. On July 14, 2006, it was announced that Dreger would leave Sportsnet and join TSN on July 31, 2006, hence 'crossing the parking lot'. Dreger won a Gemini Award in 2010 in the Best Sports Reporting category for his coverage of the firing of NHLPA Executive Director Paul Kelly. He was the only reporter in Chicago when the news broke and therefore had sole coverage. In October 2014, Bob McKenzie and Dreger began appearing as a full-time contributors on NBCSN.

Alexander Leeper, the son of the Rev. Alexander Leeper, canon of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, was born on 3 June 1848. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated B.A. in 1871 and M.A. in 1875, and St John's College, Oxford where he took a first-class BA in Literae Humaniores in 1874. Leeper came to Victoria in 1875 as classical master for the Melbourne Church of England Grammar School but in the following year was made principal of Trinity College (University of Melbourne). The title of his office was afterwards changed to warden. He was not completely successful from the beginning, at one stage there was a revolt which ended in the expulsion of several students, but it became recognized that Leeper was devoted to the college, which he controlled with success for the remainder of his 42 years of office. Leeper also took an important share in the management of the university as a member of the council from 1880 to 1887 and 1900 to 1923. He resigned his position as warden of Trinity in 1918, but continued to be a prominent figure in Melbourne for many years longer as a member of the council of education, as a lay canon of St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne, and as a trustee of the public library, museums and National Gallery of Victoria of which he was president from 1920 to 1928. He was also a leading spirit in the Melbourne Shakespeare Society and the Classical Association. He was a great fighter on the North of Ireland side in all controversies relating to Irish questions. He died at Melbourne on 6 August 1934. An excellent portrait by John Longstaff is in the National Gallery of Victoria at Melbourne. Beyond some lectures and pamphlets, his only publication was his translation of Thirteen Satires of Juvenal, originally prepared in conjunction with Herbert Augustus Strong in 1882, but afterwards revised and issued under his own name. Trinity College, Dublin, gave him the degree of LL.D. The first Latin play and the first Greek tragedy to be performed in Australia were produced under his direction at Trinity College, Melbourne. Five of his students became bishops in the Anglican Church: J. Stretch and George Merrick Long (Newcastle, Australia), R. Stephen (Hobart), T. H. Armstrong (Wangaratta) and W. C. Sadlier (Nelson, New Zealand). Personal life He was married twice, first to Adeline Marian, daughter of Sir George Wigram Allen and later to Mary Elizabeth, daughter of F. G.

Two of the sons had distinguished careers: the elder, Alexander Wigram Allen Leeper (1887-1935), born at Melbourne and educated at Melbourne Grammar School, the University of Melbourne and at Oxford, eventually entered the British Foreign Office and rose to be first secretary at H.M. legation at Vienna 1924-8, and counsellor 1933. He broke down under the strain of his work in 1934 and died in January 1935. He had nearly completed A History of Medieval Austria, which was published by the Oxford University Press in 1941. His brother, Reginald Wildig Allen Leeper, born at Sydney in 1888 and educated at Melbourne Grammar School and the universities of Melbourne and Oxford, also entered the foreign office and diplomatic service.

It is based on the 1962-1966 television series of the same name. Ernest Borgnine was the only member of the original television show's cast to appear in the film. The film was a critical and commercial failure. Plot On Caribbean, on the Island of San Moreno, a trio of important looking men (a Chinese militant, a Russian General, and a European businessman) are meeting with the island's governor. After paying him a suitcase full of money for a special operation, the three men are joined, via helicopter, by Major Vladakov (Tim Curry), the second best terrorist in the world, who will be in charge of the operation. This entire event is witnessed by a young boy named Roberto who takes pictures of the governor, the Major, and his men. The next morning finds retired Lt. Commander Quinton McHale (Tom Arnold) making his way to the Naval base of San Ysidro, where he does some trading with the officers. Such goods and services include selling home-brewed beer, ice cream, and swimsuit calendars to the men of the San Ysidro Naval Base in exchange for things like medicine and satellite photos to help out the people of San Moreno. The satellite photos are actually his way of spying on the opposing children's baseball team. Stationed at the base are his old crew: Virgil (Bruce Campbell), a cigar-chomping ladies man and gunner; Happy (French Stewart), the team lookout who lives in a treehouse; Willie (Henry Cho), the team techie and moonshine maker; Gruber (Danton Stone), a slightly portly card-player and cigar horder; and Christy (Brian Haley), the group's musclehead who can unscrew a bottle cap with his eye. However, the base is now commanded by newly arrived Captain Wallace B. Binghamton (Dean Stockwell) and Lieutenant Penelope Carpenter (Debra Messing). Capt. Binghamton believes his men have gone native and confiscates all of the products McHale has sold them. He wants to resurrect his career after having mistakenly sunk a luxury cruise liner, for which he is famously known. Vladakov takes control of the baseball field and beach on San Moreno to set up his base of operations. After Roberto inadvertently alerts Vladakov to McHale's presence, (mostly thanks to the jersey that McHale gave him and the team), Vladakov uses his new stealth boat to blow up McHale's home and nearly destroys his PT-73, a decommissioned PT Boat, which reveals that they have a rather bad history with each other. When the governor tells Vladakov that his operations are disrupting the lives of the villagers, Vladakov and his men invade the village during their fiesta, blowing it up, and displacing everyone that lived there. At the Pentagon, Cobra (Ernest Borgnine), who is a Naval Admiral, finds out about Vladakov's presence on San Moreno and instructs Binghamton to stand down in favor of McHale, revealing that he was once a highly decorated, top covert-operative. This shocks Binghamton, but he relays the message to McHale. McHale rejects the mission, saying he wants nothing to do with it, or with Binghamton. Upon learning that the village was destroyed, McHale accepts the assignment with the stipulations that he be given his old crew, men stationed at San Ysidro, and complete autonomy from Binghamton. Binghamton appears to agree but enlists Ensign Charles Parker (David Alan Grier) to spy on McHale. Slowly both Parker and Carpenter realize that Binghamton is an incompetent officer. McHale sets up a camp site for the villagers and, after invading Vladakov's base to find out what's going on, heads to Cuba for supplies to fix the re-commissioned PT-73 and to combat Vladakov. McHale and his crew use a pirated variety show broadcast to prevent Vladakov from stealing missile launch codes and entertain the villagers. Binghamton, tired of sitting on the side lines, attempts an attack on Vladakov's base but upon arrival, it is vacated and shown to be a front. Vladakov has killed the men that hired him to blow up The Pentagon as his motives are finally revealed. He was monitoring communications between McHale and Cobra and is aware that Cobra is en route to San Moreno to help take out Vladakov. Vladakov attempts to kill Cobra using his stealth boat. Roberto is aboard and he tries to short out the boat to no avail. He is captured by Vladakov, but manages to jump ship. After Ensign Parker saves Roberto, McHale successfully kills Vladakov using a torpedo he bought in Cuba, as revenge for Vladakov killing Roberto's father in Panama. Cobra lands safely and reveals that he is McHale's father, none other than now Admiral Quinton McHale, Sr. and former WWII era commander of the PT-73. Finally, the film ends with the commendations of McHale's crew, and the promotions of Lt. Carpenter and Ensign Parker, the US Navy rebuilding the baseball field, McHale re- retiring so that he may pursue a relationship with Carpenter, and Binghamton's apparent demotion to umpire for a kids' baseball game. Cast Reception =Box office= In its opening weekend the film earned $2.2 million and came in 7th place at the box office. It grossed a total of $4.5 million in ticket sales, against a production budget of $42 million. Sidney Sheinberg, whose production company Bubble Factory produced the film for Universal, said: \\"McHale‚Äôs Navy was a disaster. I'm not pretending it wasn‚Äôt a disaster\\". =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 3% based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 2.01/10 and the consensus: \\"About as funny as a keelhauling, McHale's Navy will leave most viewers feeling they've been the victim of a particularly dishonorable discharge.\\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 18 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating \\"overwhelming dislike\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C+\\" on scale of A to F. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote in a very negative review: \\"By the end, this soporific comedy makes 105 minutes feel more like a two-year hitch.\\" Leonard Klady of Variety wrote: \\"Time and adapters have not been kind to the fun-loving series.\\" =Awards= McHale's Navy was nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Remake or Sequel, losing to Speed 2: Cruise Control. It won the awards for Worst Actor (Arnold) and Worst Resurrection of a TV Show at the 1997 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards.

Hawes was known for designing and constructing church buildings in England, Western Australia and The Bahamas. He served as a priest in the Church of England before converting to Roman Catholicism and received ordination as a Catholic priest. He was later named a Domestic Prelate by Pope Pius XI and given the title \\"monsignor\\". After retiring he lived as a hermit in The Bahamas, becoming known more commonly as Father Jerome. Early life Hawes was born in Richmond, Surrey to Edward, a solicitor, and Amelia Hawes. He attended school in Brighton and Canterbury. After leaving school he began training as an architect in London in 1893 with architects Edmeston and Gabriel. He also received formal architectural education at the Architectural Association School as well as the Central School of Arts and Craft. In 1897 he began practising as an architect, designing houses at Bognor. After winning a design competition, Hawes was commissioned to build his first church in Gunnerton in 1899. After studying at Lincoln Theological College he was ordained as a Church of England priest in 1903. After stints at Clerkenwell and Caldy Island he was posted to a mission in The Bahamas. In 1910 he designed St Paul's Church in Clarence Town on Long Island. In 1911 he left The Bahamas for the United States where he converted to Roman Catholicism. After leading a nomadic existence in Canada and the United States for several years, including working as a labourer and as a railway teamster, he began studying for the priesthood in Rome. He was ordained a Catholic priest in Rome on 27 February 1915, after which he was sent to Geraldton, Western Australia where he worked as a priest, architect and builder. In May 1939, Monsignor Hawes sailed from Fremantle, returning to The Bahamas, officially on a pilgrimage. He designed and built the Mount Alvernia Hermitage on Como Hill at Cat Island, which became his home. Along with this hermitage, he also designed five churches in the Bahamas as well as a second church at Clarence Town, St Peter's. He died on 26 June 1956 in Miami, Florida, aged 79 and at his own request was buried in a cave located beneath the hermitage at Cat Island. Architecture Work The Hermitage on the top of Mt.

He fought alongside Andrew Jackson, and saved his life, at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, though later in life he regretted having done so.  Name and noms de guerre  Junaluska was born around 1775,Junaluska; Thomaslegion.net; retrieved on July 2008 approximately south of Franklin, North Carolina near present day Dillard, Georgia. A few days after his birth, he was given his original name when the cradle-board holding him fell over. He was called Gu-Ka-Las-Ki or Gulkalaski in the Cherokee language,NC.us, retrieved July 2008 (\\"one who falls from a leaning position\\"). Later, after an unsuccessful military venture, he was named Tsu-Na-La-Hun-Ski or Tsunulahunski (\\"one who tries but fails\\").Note: Other spellings of his name included Chunaluska (in the diaries of Col. Thomas); Ja-ne-lus-kee (in the Siler Rolls); and Junoluskee (by the North Carolina General Assembly). Junaluska's own description of the event that gave him the name was \\"Detsinulahungu\\" (meaning \\"I tried, but could not\\").  Allies and enemies  Oral tradition has it that Junaluska met with Tecumseh in Soco Gap in 1811 although this is not verified. Junaluska however sent word at least to Tecumseh that the Cherokee would not join an Indian confederacy against the whites. In 1813 when the Cherokee raised up 636 men against the Red Stick faction of the Creek Indians in Alabama, Junaluska personally recruited over a hundred men to fight at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. The Cherokee unit was incorporated into the combined Creek-Cherokee-Yuchi-Choctaw army under the command of Brig. General William McIntosh, a \\"friendly\\" Creek from Georgia. Junaluska's actions turned the tide when he swam the Tallapoosa River retrieving Redstick canoes and ferrying the Cherokee to the rear of the Creeks. He is also credited with saving Andrew Jackson's life during this battle. According to the provisions of an 1819 treaty with the United States, Junaluska applied for of land at Sugar Creek near Franklin, North Carolina. When his land was usurped by white settlers, he moved to the remaining portion of the Cherokee Nation.  Contention with Jackson  It was reported that Jackson met with Junaluska regarding the Indian Removal Act, but the president said, \\"Sir, your audience is ended. There is nothing I can do for you,\\" and when Junaluska saw his people being removed, he cried and looked toward the sky saying, \\"Oh my God, if I had known at the battle of the Horse Shoe what I know now, American history would have been differently written\\". During the infamous Trail of Tears in 1838, Junaluska and many other Cherokee people were incarcerated and held in nearby stockades. One, Fort Montgomery, was located near present day Robbinsville, North Carolina. From this stockade, Junaluska was forced to march to the Indian Territory in present day eastern OklahomaJunaluska.com, retrieved on July 2, 2008 Junaluska was assigned to Jesse Bushyhead's detachment. About seven weeks into the journey, Junaluska deserted with approximately 50 other Cherokee. He and his band were soon captured and returned to Oklahoma. After several years Junaluska made the trip back to North Carolina on foot. In 1847, after a plea by Col. William Holland Thomas, the state legislature rewarded him for his service by making him a citizen and giving him land near present-day Robbinsville, North Carolina.  Personal life  Junaluska married Ni-suh and had three children, boys Jim-my and Sic-que-yuh, and daughter Na-lih. Junaluska died October 20, 1868, and was buried in Robbinsville. His grave was originally marked, in traditional Cherokee style, with a pile of stones, but in 1910 the General Joseph Winston Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution (Winston-Salem) erected a monument at his grave site. A museum and memorial stands in his honor at this location.  Legacy  Junaluska has been memorialized by Lake Junaluska, Junaluska Creek, Junaluska Gap, Junaluska Ridge, the Junaluska Salamander, Mount Junaluska (now known as North Eaglenest Mountain), and by a giant sculpture featured along the Trail of the Whispering Giants in Metro-Kiwanis Park in Johnson City, Tennessee. During the American Civil War, CSS Junaluska of the Confederate States Navy was named for him.CSS Junaluska at Naval History & Heritage Command Gallery File:Junaluska.jpgThe Grave of Junaluska and second wife, Nicie, in Robbinsville, North Carolina's Junaluska Memorial and Museum.

An NWS assessment of its Hurricane Katrina activity found that because of \\"the unprecedented detail and foreboding nature of the language used, the statement helped reinforce the actions of emergency management officials as they coordinated one of the largest evacuations in U.S. history.\\"Service Assessment: Hurricane Katrina, August 23-31, 2005. The bulletin \\"helped reinforce the message from emergency management officials for residents in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi to heed evacuation orders from local officials.\\" Background On the evening of August 25, 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane near the Miami-Dade‚ÄìBroward county line in southern Florida and weakened into a tropical storm as a result. The next morning, after passing over the state, Tropical Storm Katrina moved into the Gulf of Mexico, and reintensified back to hurricane strength. As the hurricane passed over the warm waters of the Loop Current, the hurricane began to undergo rapid deepening.Knabb, Richard D.; Rhome, Jamie R. \\".\\" National Hurricane Center. December 20, 2005. At 11:00 p.m. EDT August 26, approximately 56 hours before Katrina's landfall near Buras, Louisiana, the National Hurricane Center had predicted that the Greater New Orleans area could face a direct hit by the storm. As New Orleans is located on the Mississippi River Delta and parts of the city are below sea level, a strong hurricane could have a devastating effect on the city. Previous warnings, such as the one made by the Houston Chronicle in 2001, told of a disaster that \\"would strand 250,000 people or more, and probably kill one of 10 left behind as the city drowned under 20 feet of water\\" following a severe hurricane making landfall on the city.Berger, Eric. \\"Keeping its head above water: New Orleans faces doomsday scenario .\\" Houston Chronicle. December 1, 2001. Max Mayfield, who was the director of the National Hurricane Center at the time, indicated that the Mississippi/Louisiana area has \\"the greatest potential for nightmare scenarios,\\" and that this has been known for at least the three decades he has worked at the NHC. Other publications, such as Popular Mechanics, Scientific American, and The Times-Picayune had given doomsday scenarios in which a sinking city would drown and its residents would be left homeless.Wilson, Jim. \\"New Orleans is Sinking .\\" Popular Mechanics. September 11, 2001.Fischetti, Mark. \\"Drowning New Orleans.\\" Scientific American. October, 2001.McQuaid, John; Schleifstein, Mark. \\"Washing Away.\\" The Times-Picayune. June 23-June 27, 2002. In 1965, Hurricane Betsy made landfall just south of New Orleans, causing widespread flooding in the city. As a result, a system of levees was authorized by Congress to handle future storm events. However, the protection given by this system was limited to hurricanes up to Category 3 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.Westerink, J.J.; Luettich, R.A. \\"The Creeping Storm .\\" Civil Engineering Magazine. June, 2003. Three days before Katrina's second and third landfalls, the National Hurricane Center began predicting that the storm would make landfall as a major hurricane. By the next morning, on August 27, the NHC issued a hurricane watch that included the New Orleans metro area, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning by 10:00 p.m. CDT that same evening. At this point, Katrina was a Category 3 hurricane with 115 mph (185 km/h) winds and about 335 miles (540 km) to the south-southeast of the Mississippi River's mouth. Bulletin text Over the course of the overnight hours of August 27, 2005, Hurricane Katrina rapidly strengthened, reaching Category 5 status by morning, with maximum sustained winds of 175 mph (280 km/h) by 10:00 am CDT on August 28. A few minutes later, at 10:11 a.m. CDT (1511 UTC), Robert Ricks, a meteorologist with the New Orleans/Baton Rouge NWS office, issued the following statement as part of the event synopsis text of an inland hurricane wind warning being issued: A warning just as dire was issued at 4:13 p.m. CDT. Impact In the months following the storm, Congress appointed a bipartisan committee to investigate the response to Hurricane Katrina and the preparations prior to its landfall. The committee concluded that the forecasts given by the National Weather Service were timely, were not responsible for failures in other agencies, and were likely responsible for saving thousands of lives that would have otherwise been lost in the raging hurricane. During an internal assessment by the National Weather Service, the 10:11 bulletin and its impact were analyzed. The report called the bulletin \\"a significant moment for the NWS during Katrina,\\" as its detailed and explicit language did not have any precedent, though the message was based on a template designed by the Tampa Weather Office in the 1990s. The strongly worded statement urged residents to evacuate, and was highlighted by national news media. As a result, the level of detail was highlighted as an \\"innovative best practice\\" in the NWS assessment, which recommended issuing warnings with similar levels of detail in the future. The bulletin was described as \\"perhaps the most chilling ever issued\\" by the NWS. Ricks, a native of the Ninth Ward, later told NBC Nightly News that he wrote the bulletin based on his previous experiences with Betsy and Camille. He also said that he was looking for statements to take out, but decided to leave the bulletin more or less intact because it seemed valid for a storm that he was convinced would be \\"the big one\\" longtime New Orleans residents had been predicting for some time. He admitted that he and his colleagues hoped to have been wrong about just how powerful Katrina would become, \\"but our local expertise said otherwise.\\" He added, \\"We always prepare for the big one, we just didn't think it was going to come this soon.\\" The bulletin, and the rosary that Ricks clutched as he and his fellow forecasters weathered the storm in their office, are both now in the National Museum of American History.

Appearance T. paniculatum bears tuberous roots and panicles of flowers and produces tiny, jewel-like fruits that resemble precious stones. Its peculiarity is its very long root, of orange colour , that reaches about 80 centimeters. It is a very bad herb in crops, and it proliferates very easily, since it roots very easily, even after it has been plucked and if it has any part of the root in contact with the soil. The plant as a whole can reach almost 2 meters high measured from the soil surface, where after maturity, its brown seeds (in abundance), spread easily through the surrounding area.Gaertn., 1791 In: Fruct. Sem. Pl. 2: 219, t. 128, f. 13 Native range Talinum paniculatum is native to the southern United States, much of Latin America (such as Paraguay and Uruguay) and the Caribbean. It has been introduced notably in Africa and Asia. Uses Talinum paniculatum is often grown as an ornamental plant. Cultivars include 'Kingwood Gold', 'Lim√≥n', and 'Variegatum'. The leaves are edible and have been used in traditional medicine in Asia. Used in home medicine as a diuretic, healing, emollient, vulval and anti-infective, it is also consumed in salads.

It opened in 1864, and closed in 1965. Formation and construction By 1861 railways were at last being constructed in the thinly populated districts of South West Scotland. The Castle Douglas and Dumfries Railway (CD&DR;) had opened in 1859, connecting with the much larger Glasgow and South Western Railway (G&SWR;) at Dumfries, and the Portpatrick Railway, later to be the core of the Portpatrick and Wigtownshire Joint Railway, was being constructed with the intention of linking Portpatrick with the British main line network and encouraging a ferry service to the north of Ireland. Desiring the advantages of connection to the railway network, and fearing the loss of County Town status to Castle Douglas, local interests in Kirkcudbright promoted the Kirkcudbright Railway to connect the town with Castle Douglas. The cost of construction was estimated at ¬£40,000; the G&SWR; was content to offer support for the scheme, and agreed to subscribe ¬£15,000 if the CD&DR; would subscribe ¬£5,000. The Kirkcudbright Railway (KR) obtained its authorising Act of Parliament on 1 August 1861.Date according to Smith and Carter; Ross says 2 August.David L Smith, The Little Railways of South West Scotland, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1969, E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959David Ross, The Glasgow & South Western Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing, Catrine, 2014, The first general meeting of the new Company did not take place until 25 October 1861. While construction was proceeding under Wylie & Peddie, the KR concluded an agreement with the G&SWR; for the latter to work the line for 42¬Ω% of gross receipts after deduction of cartage costs. The construction was ready for a demonstration trip on 30 January 1864. The line opened to goods traffic on 17 February 1864 but the Board of Trade (BoT) Inspecting Officer declined to authorise passenger operation until the junction with the Portpatrick Railway was improved. The BoT had introduced a rule that junctions of single line railways must be made double-line at the point of connection, and the Castle Douglas junction did not comply. The line opened to passengers on 2 March 1864 between Kirkcudbright and a quickly-constructed station at St Andrew Street, Castle Douglas, short of the junction. The planned entry to the junction at Castle Douglas was extremely sharp; and Kirkcudbright trains entering the station had to use a short length of Portpatrick Railway track; it appears that permission for this had not been properly obtained. Signalling alterations were made at the Castle Douglas junction and a low speed restriction imposed, and through passenger running commenced on 15 August 1864.Detail from Smith, and Ross. Other references give different dates but Smith's account is backed up by a detailed logical explanation. Butt agrees the date of St Andrew Street but illogically gives a later date (7 March 1864) for Tarff and Kirkcudbright. Awdry simply gives 15 August and refers to the junction difficulty but not the temporary arrangement; Bradshaw's Directory and also Carter say the following day (16 August); Paterson refers only to the opening to goods traffic. However Ross gives 1 March as the start of the St Andrew Street passenger service.Christopher Awdry, Encyclopaedia of British Railway Companies, Patrick Stephens Limited, Wellingborough, 1990, Capital was ¬£60,000 in shares with borrowing powers up to ¬£20,000.Bradshaw's Railway Manual, Shareholders' Guide, and Official Directory, 1865John Thomas, revised Alan S Paterson, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 6: Scotland, The Lowlands and the Borders, David & Charles (Holdings) Limited, Newton Abbot, 1984, Timetable The 1895 public timetable shows seven trains each way except Sundays; one each way ran Mondays and Fridays only; the journey time was 25 minutes. The entire line between Dumfries and Kirkcudbright is shown as the \\"Kirkcudbright Branch\\". A mid morning train from London St Pancras to Glasgow gave a connection at Dumfries for Castle Douglas. A note against Bridge of Dee, Tarff and Kirkcudbright stations states, \\"Passengers from South of Carlisle for these Stations will be conveyed by Special Train from Castle Douglas.\\"Bradshaw's General Steam Navigation and Railway Guide, 12th mo, (December) 1895, reprinted by Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2011, Absorption and closure The G&SWR; absorbed a number of small companies that it had earlier sponsored, and this included the Kirkcudbright Railway; the change was ratified by an Amalgamation Act of 5 July 1865. The absorption became effective on 1 August 1865. The shareholders received a cash settlement of face value plus 5% for their shares. Passenger traffic ceased on 3 May 1965.According to Holland, and Butt; Awdry gives 3 June 1965.Julian Holland, Dr Beeching's Axe 50 Years On: Memories of Britain's Lost Railways, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 2013, Topography System map of the Kirkcudbright RailwayThe line was a little over 10 miles (16 km) long. The station at Kirkcudbright was on the east side of the River Dee; it had an all-over roof. The line ran north from Kirkcudbright, crossing the river at Tongueland Bridge (later spelt Tongland) and keeping to the west of the ridge that forms Bar Hill. After the station at Tarff, the line turns north-easterly crossing the Dee once again at Bridge of Dee. (In both cases the \\"bridge\\" in the name refers to an earlier road bridge.) It joined the Portpatrick Railway a little to the west of Castle Douglas station. The junction connection there originally joined the Portpatrick Railway line a short distance west of the station, by a very sharp curve. Improvements to the layout at the station took place some time before 1894, and the Kirkcudbright line then entered independently by a more gentle alignment, passing under a separate span of Dumfries Road bridge, which was widened for the purpose. The stations were: * Kirkcudbright; opened 2 March 1864; closed 3 May 1965; * Tarff for Gatehouse; opened 2 March 1864; renamed Gatehouse 1 September 1865; renamed Tarff 1 August 1871; closed 3 May 1965; * ; opened 18 April 1864; closed 26 September 1949; * Castle Douglas St Andrew Street; opened 2 March 1864; closed 1 December 1867; * - CD&DR; station.R V J Butt, The Directory of Railway Stations, Patrick Stephens Limited, Sparkford, 1995, See also List of closed railway stations in Britain  References  Disused stations Notes Category:Closed railway lines in Scotland Category:Railway lines opened in 1864 Category:Railway lines closed in 1965 ","title":"Kirkcudbright Railway"},{"id":"5973578","text":"\\"Lapponia\\" was the Finnish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1977, performed in Finnish by Monica Aspelund.  Description  The song was performed sixteenth on the night, following Italy's Mia Martini with \\"Libera\\" and preceding Belgium's Dream Express with \\"A Million in One, Two, Three\\". At the close of voting, it had received 50 points, placing 10th in a field of 18. It became the first Finnish entry to be awarded with a maximum score (given by Ireland) since the start of the 12 point tradition in 1975. It would remain Finland's sole maximum score until 2006, when Denmark was first of eight to award 12 points to Finland's winning entry \\"Hard Rock Hallelujah\\". Despite its moderate placing at the Eurovision final, \\"Lapponia\\" was given release in twenty European countries and also in Australia, Brazil, Israel and Turkey. Aspelund recorded \\"Lapponia\\" in six languages; Finnish, her mother tongue Swedish, English, German, French and Dutch. \\"Lapponia\\" afforded Aspelund a #5 hit in Finland and also reached #5 in Sweden. The successive Finnish representative at the 1978 Contest by Seija Simola was \\"Anna rakkaudelle tilaisuus\\". In 1983 Monica Aspelund's sister Ami entered the contest with the song \\"Fantasiaa\\". \\"Lapponia\\" was included on the double-disc sets of \\"Winners and Classics\\" produced to commemorate the Congratulations special of late 2005. This is in spite of the song placing substantially lower than Marion Rung's \\"Tom Tom Tom\\" of 1973 - at the time the CDs were made, Finland's highest Contest finish. As the liner notes indicate that it is a \\"distinctly Finnish\\" song, the argument can be made that Rung's Anglophone song was not quite as Finnish. The band Northern Kings covered this song.

As of 2016, five companies operate franchised public bus services. There is also a variety of non- franchised public buses services, including feeder bus services to railway stations operated by MTR, and residents' services for residential estates (particularly those in the New Territories). History Current situation The bus service of Hong Kong can be roughly divided into 3 types: Franchised bus, Non-franchised bus and Public light bus. =Franchised bus= As of 2014, there are 5 privately owned bus companies that provide franchised bus service across Hong Kong, operating more than 700 routes with some 5,800 buses. Hong Kong is one of the few cities in the world that bus services are not operated or owned by the Government. These are the five franchised bus companies in Hong Kong: * Kowloon Motor Bus Company (1933) Limited Kowloon Motor Bus Mainly provides service in Kowloon and New Territories, operating about 400 routes with about 3,850 buses. Some of them are cross-harbour routes, either solely operated or jointly operated with Citybus or New World First Bus. * Citybus Limited Citybus Mainly provides service on Hong Kong Island, operates 108 bus routes, including 59 Hong Kong Island routes, 29 cross-harbour routes, 1 New Territories route and 19 routes to Tung Chung/Airport. It operates 957 buses. * Long Win Bus Company Limited Long Win Bus Mainly services Tung Chung, Disneyland Resort and routes shuttling between the Airport and New Territories, operating 19 routes with 165 buses. * New World First Bus Services Limited New World First Bus Mainly provides service on Hong Kong Island, and provides routes in Kowloon and Tseung Kwan O. It operates 47 Hong Kong Island routes, 8 Kowloon and Tseung Kwan O routes and 34 cross-harbour routes. It operates with 711 buses. * New Lantao Bus Company (1973) Limited New Lantao Bus Mainly provides service on Lantau Island, operating 22 Lantau routes and 1 New Territories route with 108 buses. The Kowloon Motor Bus Company (1933) Limited (KMB) is one of the largest privately owned public bus operators in the world. KMB's fleet consists of about 3,800 buses on 400 routes and a staff of over 12,000. In 1979, Citybus began its operation in Hong Kong with one double-decker, providing shuttle service for the Hong Kong dockyard. It later expanded into operating a residential bus route between City One, Shatin and Kowloon Tong MTR station. New World First Bus Services Limited (NWFB) was established in 1998, taking over China Motor Bus's franchise to provide bus services on Hong Kong Island together with Citybus. NWFB's parent company later bought Citybus, but the two companies have basically been operating independently. Hong Kong franchised bus routes have a fixed path, fare, service hours and schedule. Urban routes mostly operate with double-decker buses, which have become a distinguishing feature of Hong Kong. Passengers are required to pay their bus fare when they board the bus, and all buses accept payment by either Octopus card or cash; however no change is given for paying by the latter. Some routes such as cross-harbour routes and Disneyland Resort routes are operated jointly by two companies. Fares are distanced-based although longer distances are comparatively cheaper than shorter distance fares on a per km basis. Hong Kong's bus fare system is based on where a passenger boards, e.g., \\"tap on\\" but not where a passenger alights, e.g., \\"tap off\\". As such, a passenger pays the entire fare upon boarding regardless of point of alighting. Many routes provide \\"step down fare\\" after a certain journey distance has been completed. =Non-franchised buses= The non-franchised bus services of Hong Kong are provided by different private bus companies as a means to relieve the demand on franchised buses and green public minibuses in rush hour. They also serve some remote places which are deemed non-profitable for franchised bus and green public minibus operators to serve. According to the Transport Department, there were 8111 registered non-franchised buses in Hong Kong as of 13 March 2014. Generally speaking, the services are divided into the following categories: *Tourist services (A01): Known as \\"Travel bus\\" () in daily usage, providing transport services for tourists between tourist attractions. *Hotel services (A02): operated by hotels or by bus companies, providing transport services for hotel customers. *School services (A03): operated by schools or by bus companies, providing transport services for students. *Employee services (A04): operated by different institutes or by bus companies, providing transport services for employees. *Residential services (A06): Known as \\"Estate bus\\" () in daily usage, they providing feeder services between new towns and urban areas; they are often applied jointly by management company of private housing estates and bus companies as a mean to carry residents from where they live to major transport interchanges. *Contract hire services (A08): Hired by a person or groups for transport services. On the other hand, MTR Corporation also operates some feeder bus routes in Tuen Mun, Tin Shui Wai and Yuen Long to complement its West Rail Line and Light Rail services. The old A20 bus service at the old airport =Public light buses= Public light bus The public light buses in Hong Kong are passenger transport vehicles (minibuses) with a capacity of 16 or 19 passengers (the 19 seat minibuses started in 2017). The capacity was 14 before the 1980s. They provide feeder services to buses and the railway. There are 4,350 minibuses in Hong Kong and this figure has been capped by the Transport Department as available licences. They can be divided into two types: red public minibuses and green public minibuses. The red public minibuses, which number around 1,200 of the 4,350 do not need to operate on fixed routes or fixed schedules and may charge any fare desired, although special prohibitions apply. Green public minibuses operate on fixed routes in set frequencies stipulated by the Transport Department of Hong Kong. Other kinds of light bus services, for example, the Nanny van transports provided by such van owners during the 1980s are considered illegal beyond their operation routes.

It is located in Encanto Village, on Central Avenue and Osborn Road. Today it exists as a mixed-use, business park primarily occupied by regional administrative offices for non-profit hospital operator Dignity Health (formerly known as Catholic Healthcare West), and regional offices for UnitedHealth Group. The property currently is known simply as Park Central. History Park Central Shopping City, as it originally was known, was first envisioned by Ralph Burgbacher and his older brother, A.J. Burgbacher. The two men purchased the Central Avenue Dairy in the 1950s. At the time Phoenix was a much smaller city, and the mall's location, north of the state capitol was an early edge city, which in time came to be known as \\"Uptown\\" Phoenix. Other developers criticized the brothers, believing a development out in the \\"dairy farm\\" area was futile, but development proceeded and the open-air mall was completed in 1957. The mall was designed by a collaboration of architects in the Mid- Century Modern style. Welton Becket designed the Goldwater's building and Ralph Haver and John Schotanus Jr. designing other parts of the mall. When the mall opened, the primary anchors were a twin-level Goldwater's witch predated the initial opening of the mall. It opened November 8, 1956. There were also a twin-level Diamond's, and a J.J. Newberry five and dime store. Ribbon-cutting ceremonies for the mall and its first 31 stores were held on April 1, 1957.Goldwater's and Diamond's soon closed their older, downtown stores favoring their new midtown location in the mall. When JCPenney closed its downtown location in the mid-1960s, the downtown area never would regain its status as the retail draw it once was. The original Phoenix-based Playboy club was across Central Ave. to the East; it closed in the mid-1980s. As Phoenix quickly grew, the area around Park Central Mall saw an increasing number of mid-rise and high-rise office buildings built along Central Avenue, and eventually became known as the central business district. Part of this mid-1960s transition included the new addition of a twin level JCPenney store at the mall, and a covered parking deck on the northeast end of the property built in 1967, to help combat the hot summertime temperatures. The new structures were designed by Al Beadle. Unable to compete with newer enclosed and air-conditioned shopping malls, Park Central, still an open-air facility, had lost most of its major retailers by the very late 1980s. The first major anchor to leave was Robinson's, which had purchased and converted the Goldwater's store years earlier, closing the location down just before the end of the decade. The second major anchor to leave was JCPenney, closing just at the start of the 1990s. Finally the last anchor, Dillard's, which had purchased and converted Diamond's a few years prior, became a discount Dillard's Clearance Center and remained open in that format until the mid-1990s. Current Conversion of the property began shortly after the last anchor closed and most vacant retail space was converted to lease-able office space. Much of the original architectural design was covered up or removed and the exterior of the mall was given a Postmodern appearance. The Diamond's space at the west / back end of the old mall became the Arizona regional offices for Catholic Healthcare West (later known as Dignity Health after it became independent of the Catholic Church), parent company of St. Joseph's Hospital located on an adjacent property. Banner Health Systems soon moved some administrative functions into what was Goldwater's, and finally the old JCPenney space became offices for UnitedHealth Group. The remaining smaller retail spaces began to fill with nearly a dozen small restaurants mostly located at the east/front end of the old mall (including Starbucks Coffee, Jamba Juice and Qdoba Mexican Grill). Other smaller businesses, such as a flower shop, a shoe repair shop, a vitamin/health supplements store, computer training company Training a la Carte, the primary customer care call center for cable service provider Cable One and a branch location of Wells Fargo Financial, occupy the remaining storefronts. A Hampton Inn hotel location sits on the southwest corner of the property adjacent to the Dignity Health offices. Nearly all the mall's original buildings still stand, and most have only cosmetic changes. In October 2017, the city of Phoenix proposed that Amazon.com locate its \\"second headquarters\\", expected to employ 50,000 people, at the Park Central location.

However, some of this time can be reclaimed, as there is no editing, cutting out or reordering scenes later on.

When the cost of film was a significant fraction of the budget, filmmakers used this technique to optimize film usage. Because of its apparent simplicity, in-camera editing is also popular with new students who may lack experience with editing, or who want to skip the editing step.

The technique may also be used to limit directing and editing interference in a production (often on the part of producers or financiers) because the film exists only as shot, with no options for editing. Any subsequent editing would require costly reshoots and pick- ups. Finally, if the filmmaker does not have access to film editing equipment (notably, a non-linear editing system), then in-camera editing may be the only available option.

It was released in 1986 for the North American theatrical version of the film Legend. It was released in the USA and Canada only. The film was written by William Hjortsberg, starred Tom Cruise, Mia Sara and Tim Curry, was produced by Arnon Milchan, directed by Ridley Scott and released domestically by Universal Studios. The album was released on compact disc on 15 August 1995 through Varese Sarabande. Background After a disappointing test screening with Jerry Goldsmith's original orchestral score, Scott decided to make changes to the film. Sidney Sheinberg, president of MCA (the parent company of Universal at the time), felt that the Goldsmith score would not appeal to the youth and pressed Scott for a new score. Tangerine Dream was contracted to complete a new, more contemporary score‚Äî-a job they completed in three weeks. Until 2002, only European audiences could see Legend with Goldsmith's score. Versions Several bootleg versions of the album exist, and vary in cover artwork to track listing as well as song length and titles. Many of the bootleg editions feature around twice as many songs as the original soundtrack, including those that were omitted from the original, such as the opening \\"Prologue\\". Tangerine Dream score \\"Loved by the Sun\\" is a vocal version of \\"Unicorn Theme\\" with lyrics written and sung by Jon Anderson of Yes. The vocals were added after Tangerine Dream had composed the instrumental music. It was originally recorded with vocals by Susanne Pawlitzki based on William Blake's poem \\"The Angel,\\" but was rejected in favor of the Jon Anderson version. \\"Unicorn Theme\\" has been played live at several concerts in various versions. \\"Is Your Love Strong Enough?\\"‚Äîthe song played over the end credits‚Äîhas lyrics written and sung by Bryan Ferry with guitar by David Gilmour (of Pink Floyd fame), bass by Guy Pratt, and sax by Iain Ballamy. It is a former outtake of the recording sessions for Avalon, the eighth and last Roxy Music album. All of the other tracks are Tangerine Dream instrumentals. \\"Is Your Love Strong Enough?\\" was also released as a 12\\" single which included an extended version of the same song as well as an instrumental; neither of these last two versions were included on the Avalon album. Prologue Tangerine Dream had recorded another piece that did not appear on the official soundtrack, but did appear in the film. It has only been found in bootlegs, in MP3 form at some P2P sites, and also on some streaming services, particularly Rdio. Within both mediums, the song was given either the title \\"Prologue\\" or \\"Once Long Ago\\". This music can be heard in the intro to the American film release and is also heard in one of the early scenes between Jack and Lilly. It is recognized for its distinct and memorable flute melody. Additionally, some of this melody can be heard at the end of the song, \\"Loved by the Sun,\\" as it fades out. It can be theorized that the band originally intended that outro to be the \\"epilogue,\\" reprising the opening melody as a means of continuity - to end the story in the place where it began. The reason for its exclusion from the official soundtrack album is unknown. DVD isolated score Legend: Ultimate Edition was released on DVD in May 2002. One of the DVD options is to play the U.S. version with an isolated Tangerine Dream score. There is no music other than what had already been released on LP and CD, nor is there any dialogue or sound effects. Thus, the DVD plays with long silences in between the music. Reception Daevid Jehnzen of AllMusic gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars, praising the \\"atmospheric, electronic soundscapes\\" of the album. However, Jehnzen thought that the soundtrack \\"doesn't quite match the splendor of their earlier work\\" and criticized the pop songs by Bryan Ferry and Jon Anderson. Keyboard praised the album for its use of darker tracks, opining that they \\"have more balls than just about anything T. Dream has ever done before\\", but criticized the album for its overuse of the Shakuhachi sample from the Emulator II keyboard. In another review of the soundtrack on Keyboard, Freff called it the \\"audio equivalent of computer clip-art\\" due to the overuse of the samples, especially the \\"Shepard tone preset\\" and the Shakuhachi sample. Track listing The track order, for the most part, follows the order of appearance in the film, with the exception of two of the songs: \\"Loved by the Sun,\\" is heard during the film's final scene, and \\"Is Your Love Strong Enough?\\" is heard during the film's ending credits.

Early career He was formerly of the bands Seether, doubleDrive and Still Rain. After the demise of his first band, Still Rain, McLawhorn helped form doubleDrive in 1996 and landed a recording contract with MCA records in 1998. After scoring a top 20 hit at active rock radio with the song \\"Tattooed Bruise\\" with the help of program director Dick Shuetz at WJRR in Orlando, Fla. The band left MCA and signed a new deal with Roadrunner Records in 2001 and released their second album Blue In The Face with the song \\"Imprint\\" reaching into the top 20 also. McLawhorn was an active member until December 2003, when the band broke up. Upon the breakup of that band he along with Corey Lowery and Will Hunt began working on material together which would later become Dark New Day and would include good friends Clint Lowery and Brett Hestla. The lineup was one that had been hinted at years earlier. Dark New Day signed a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records in late 2004 and released the album 12 year silence which had the song \\"Brother\\" in 2005 which was a top 10 hit at active rock radio. Evanescence In May 2007, McLawhorn was announced as the replacement for Evanescence's former guitarist John LeCompt, and played with the band through its The Open Door album tour, which ended in December 2007. He remained active with Dark New Day while playing with Evanescence. However, McLawhorn eventually left Dark New Day in mid-2008 after joining Seether as a touring guitarist. After the success of the subsequent tour, McLawhorn became the official lead guitarist of Seether. From then until early March 2011, McLawhorn did various tours with Seether. He took part in recording with the band on projects such as \\"Seether iTunes Originals,\\" \\"Rhapsody Originals,\\" and on covers of Wham!'s \\"Careless Whisper\\" and Frank Sinatra's \\"I've Got You Under my Skin\\" as well. McLawhorn finished writing and recording with Seether on the album \\"Holding On To Strings Better Left To Fray.\\" The first single \\"Country Song\\" which was co- written by McLawhorn was released in the United States on March 8, 2011 exclusively on iTunes. On March 8, 2011 it was announced that Troy had left Seether to pursue other interests. Later that day McLawhorn responded on the official \\"The Troy McLawhorn Fan Site\\" on Facebook with the following statement: \\"Thanks for all of the support. You guys are great! I really enjoyed playing and creating music with the guys and I wish that I didn't have to leave especially now that the album that we worked so hard on is finally coming out. It was a hard decision and I wish them the best. I hope that I will see all of you when I find my next project.\\" On April 8, 2011, Seether frontman Shaun Morgan took to his Twitter account to vent his frustrations regarding Troy's still unconfirmed new gig. The next day Troy took to his official Facebook page to release the following statement to explain his departure: :\\"You know...I have been laying low because I didn't want my departure from Seether to be any more dramatic than it has to be but I can't sit by while people come to my site and trash me. There are a lot of people who have been very supportive and I appreciate that so much. As for the haters...I can understand that people are passionate about their bands and the music. I am, too. That's why even when I was barely able to survive financially in this business I never quit because I genuinely love to play music with my friends. My leaving Seether was not about money at all. Ask yourselves this, why would I leave the band after we had just finished making an awesome record? Why? I was as excited as anyone to get out there and support it. I am losing money by leaving the band. You have to know that it was a very personal invasion of trust that led me to make my decision to leave. Anyone who knows me knows that I am not a vindictive person and I am just trying to find a place that I can be long term and play music with people that I can trust.\\" On June 12, 2011, Amy Lee of Evanescence announced on her Twitter account that Troy had officially rejoined the band for their upcoming tour and new album due out October 11, 2011. McLawhorn will fill in for Sevendust guitarist Clint Lowery on their upcoming tour with Coal Chamber. McLawhorn will join the band on March 27 though April. Producer Evanescence finished their most recent world tour in November 2012. Upon completion of that tour it was clear that it might be quite some time before the band would be active again. Knowing this McLawhorn decided to start building a parallel career in the music business as a record producer, songwriter and session player. His first project is currently underway with a Christian artist named Skyler Truth who is from North Carolina also. Personal life He is married to Amy McLawhorn, and has a son named Michael.

The POWER2 was the successor of the POWER1, debuting in September 1993 within IBM's RS/6000 systems. When introduced, the POWER2 was the fastest microprocessor, surpassing the Alpha 21064. When the Alpha 21064A was introduced in 1993, the POWER2 lost the lead and became second. IBM claimed that the performance for a 62.5 MHz POWER2 was 73.3 SPECint92 and 134.6 SPECfp92. The open source GCC compiler removed support for POWER1 (RIOS) and POWER2 (RIOS2) in the 4.5 release. Description The MCM of a POWER2 processor Improvements over the POWER1 included enhancements to the POWER instruction set architecture (consisting of new user and system instructions and other system-related features), higher clock rates (55 to 71.5 MHz), an extra fixed point unit and floating point unit, a larger 32 KB instruction cache, and a larger 128 or 256 KB data cache. The POWER2 was a multi-chip design consisting of six or eight semi-custom integrated circuits, depending on the amount of data cache (the 256 KB configuration required eight chips). The partitioning of the design was identical to that of the POWER1: an instruction cache unit chip, a fixed-point unit chip, a floating-point unit chip, a storage control unit chip, and two or four data cache unit chips. The eight-chip configuration contains a total of 23 million transistors and a total die area of 1,215 mm2. The chips are manufactured by IBM in its 0.72 Œºm CMOS process,Gwennap 1996 which features a 0.45 Œºm effective channel length; and one layer of polysilicon and four layers of metal interconnect.White 1994 The chips are packaged in a ceramic multi- chip module (MCM) that measures 64 mm by 64 mm. POWER2+ An improved version of the POWER2 optimized for transaction processing was introduced in May 1994 as the POWER2+. Transaction processing workloads benefited from the addition of a L2 cache with capacities of 512 KB, 1 MB and 2 MB. This cache was implemented off-package with industry-standard burst SRAMs. The cache was connected to the POWER2+ via a 64- (for low-end systems) or 128-bit bus (for high-end systems). The cache was direct-mapped, had a 128-byte line size, and was write-through. The cache tags were contained on the storage control unit chip. The POWER2+ has a narrower 64- or 128-bit memory bus and a smaller 64 or 128 KB data cache. As there is less cache, the data cache unit chips are smaller as a result, and the revised storage control unit chip is also smaller. A goal for the six-chip configuration was to reduce cost, and therefore the chips are packaged in a solder ball connect (SBC) package instead of a MCM. P2SC The P2SC, for POWER2 Super Chip, was released in October 1996 as the successor of the POWER2. It was a single-chip implementation of the eight-chip POWER2, integrating 15 million transistors on a 335 mm2 die manufactured in IBM's 0.29 Œºm five-layer metal CMOS-6S process. The first version ran at 120 or 135 MHz, nearly twice as fast as the POWER2 at 71.5 MHz, with the memory and I/O buses running at half speed to support the higher clock frequency. IBM claimed that the performance of this version was 5.5 SPECint95_base and 14.5 SPECfp95_base. A faster 160 MHz part fabricated in the 0.25 Œºm CMOS-6S2 process was announced at the Microprocessor Forum in October 1997. The P2SC was not a complete copy of the POWER2, the L1 data cache and data translation lookaside buffer (TLB) capacities were halved to 128 KB and 256 entries, respectively, and a rarely used feature that locked entries in the TLB was not implemented in order to fit the original design onto a single die. The P2SC was succeeded by the POWER3 as IBM's flagship microprocessor on the RS/6000 line in 1998. A notable use of the P2SC was the 30-node IBM Deep Blue supercomputer that beat world champion Garry Kasparov at chess in 1997. However, the computer's chess-playing capabilities were due to its custom integrated circuits, rather than the P2SCs.

He served as the last Master of the Buckhounds under Lord Salisbury from 1900 to 1901. Early life A member of the Cavendish family headed by the Duke of Devonshire, Chesham was the eldest son of William Cavendish, 2nd Baron Chesham and his wife Henrietta Frances Lascelles, daughter of William Lascelles. He was educated at Eton College. Political career Lord Chesham took his seat in the House of Lords on his father's death in 1882. In November 1900, he was appointed Master of the Buckhounds under Lord Salisbury. However, as Chesham was serving in South Africa, Lord Churchill was appointed to act as Master of the Buckhounds in his absence. Chesham remained Master until the office was abolished the following year. He was admitted to the Privy Council in July 1901, and also served as a Lord of the Bedchamber to the Prince of Wales (later King George V) from 1901 to 1907. Military career He entered the Coldstream Guards in 1870. Three years later, he joined the 10th Royal Hussars as a captain, and 1878 joined the 16th Lancers. Chesham held an appointment as lieutenant colonel of the Royal Buckinghamshire Hussars Yeomanry from 1889. In January 1900 he was appointed in command of the 10th battalion of the Imperial Yeomanry (which included companies from Buckinghamshire, Berkshire and Oxfordshire), serving in the Second Boer War, and received the temporary rank of colonel in the army. He left Southampton on board the SS Norman in early February 1900, and arrived in South Africa the following month. Later that year, he was promoted to brigadier general and in November 1900 appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) for his services (he was invested by King Edward VII at Marlborough House on 25 July 1901 during a brief visit to London). From 1901 he was inspector general of Imperial Yeomanry in South Africa, with the local rank of major-general. He relinquished his commission and was granted the honorary rank of major-general in the Army on 22 January 1902, leaving South Africa the following month by the steamer . After his return to the United Kingdom, he was in late April 1902 appointed Inspector General of Imperial Yeomanry (at Army Headquarters) with the temporary rank of major-general whilst so employed.

Rambow came into the possession of the Grumbkows in 1724.

At the end of World War II, the Russians occupied this area and drove out the residents. The inhabitants of nearby Ramnitz could not escape the Russian advance. They hid in the Rambower forest and returned on the following day to the village. The East Prussia refugees had fled the Russians, but more people came after that. The Russians occupied Ramnitz in the evening hours of 8 March 1945. Poland could, because of the Russian crew, only 1950 into the possession of the village set itself.

It is also called a swatter or a beater. It is designed for extinguishing minor fires in rural areas such as heaths. A flapper is built with a long handle and a series of lamellae which allows firefighters to stand well back from the fire. The lamellae are constructed in either rubber or steel, though practically any other fire-resistant material could be used. The fire is attacked from the upwind side by lightly swatting out the flames or glows with the thick flap. When the flapper hits the ground, the oxygen supply to the fire is stopped and the fire will be extinguished. Where ground cover is short, the flapper can be dragged along the fire edge to smother the fire. If used too hard it can add more oxygen to the fire. It is often recommended to either hose water on the area or keep it under observation, as there will always be a risk of it flaring up later. Due to a flapper's small size it is unfit for use against a blazing forest fire or large burning fields. The tool's design makes it only suitable for minor flames or glows within a limited area. For fire fighting in larger areas it is much more convenient to take out hoses from a fire engine and spray selected areas. Alternatively a water cannon from a water tender can be used. A flapper is often part of the standard equipment on a fire engine and may also be set up inside and around forests and at heaths in order to take immediate action if a fire is seen. The flapper's technique has been developed from using a wet green pine bough, and wet burlap sacks in the rural south US, to swat the fire known as \\"wet sacking\\" a fire.

It was founded to promote and finance the completion of Cologne Cathedral, one of the most important Gothic buildings and churches globally and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and continues to ensure the never-ending restoration and maintenance of the Cathedral. History right =Heine and the Winter's Tale= The most famous reference to the ZDV is in Heinrich Heine's satirical poem, Germany. A Winter's Tale (Deutschland. Ein Winterm√§rchen, 1844) chapter IV. Heine sees the Cologne Cathedral as a monument to Catholicism and un-Germanness, Christian intolerance, and Cologne as a truly bad city, and calls the promoters, including the Prussians and their King, confused and counter-productive. Since he does so in superb and witty poetry - the Winter's Tale is generally acknowledged to be the high- point of lyrical satire in German -, the criticism has endured and is very striking. For Heine, the non-completion of the cathedral is the \\"monument to Germany's power and Protestant mission\\". :::::You poor fools from the Domverein, :::::You want, with weak hands, :::::Complete the interrupted work :::::And to complete the old fortress! Organization The ZDV is one of the very few associations that does not have to conform to the German Vereinsrecht (laws concerning NGO's), because it predates these laws. In fact, the ZDV is still governed according to the cabinet order of 8 December 1841 by the King of Prussia, Frederick William IV, who also was its first patron. Today, the ZDV has over 10,000 members and a board of 40, of which 10 are replaced every 4 years. Membership is completely open, but it is still considered prestigious, especially in the Rhineland. Membership in the board is a good indicator that one belongs to the most wealthy and most respected insiders of Cologne, which is well known for its governance by a closed elite (K√∂lscher Kl√ºngel). It is denoted by a small golden lapel pin showing the cathedral's facade and the letters ZDV. Members with a Wikipedia entry are listed at :Category:Members of the Zentrale Dombauverein zu K√∂ln von 1842. Finances rightThe cost to complete the cathedral, between 1842 and 1880, which was not an effort by the Catholic Church but by Protestant Prussia and the Cologne, Rhineland, and German citizens, amounted to US$1 billion (always in today's currency). Of this, one-third was paid by the State of Prussia, and two-thirds by the ZDV. Another US$1 billion was paid to \\"unveil\\" the cathedral, i.e. to purchase the houses around it and make it possible to view it from all sides; of this amount, half was financed by the ZDV. Much of the Verein's income derived from a special lottery, the Dombaulotterie. Today, the annual budget of the cathedral, which amounts to appr. US$3,5 million, is financed by half by the ZDV. The income comes from membership fees, donations, bequests, fines (German judges can order that fines in civil cases are paid to the ZDV), and especially a Federal lottery. Legally, the Cathedral belongs to itself, not to the Catholic Church or the Archbishop; not even to the Metropolitan Chapter, which administers it based on the legal fiction that it has been charged with this by the cathedral.

The white grouper is found in the subtropical eastern Atlantic Ocean and the southern Mediterranean Sea. Description The white grouper has a head which is longer than its body is deep, the standard length being 3 to 3.6 times the depth of the body. The dorsal profile is convex between the eyes. The preopercle is angular and has with 3 to 6 large spines at its angle, the lowest being directed downwards. The dorsal fin contains 10-11 spines and 14-16 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 7-9 soft rays. The caudal fin is rounded and the body is covered in small scales which are set within thick skin. There are over 90 scales in the lateral line. The overall colour is greenish bronze with darker fins which are brownish purple and have white or pale margins. There are 3 or 4 pale blue or white lines across the gill cover, these can be quite faint in larger adults. The juveniles have faint dark spots on their body which create 5 indistinct dark vertical bars. The juveniles also have indistinct dark spots on the fins. The maximum total length this species has been recorded at is , although they are more common at around , and the maximum published weight is > Distribution The white grouper is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean from southern Portugal and southern Spain south along the western coast of Africa as far south as Angola, including the islands in the Gulf of Guinea. Its occurrence in the Canary Islands and Madeira needs to be verified. It is found in the southern and eastern Mediterranean but appears to be expanding its range northwards being formerly absent north of 44¬∞N in the Adriatic Sea and to be absent from the central Mediterranean but there have been records from Corsica and Monaco, among other recent northerly Mediterraean Sea records. There is a history of vagrancy in this species and the synonym Perca robusta was based on a specimen taken in Cornwall in southwestern England. Habitat and biology The white grouper occurs on substrates of rock or mud and sand while the juveniles are found in coastal lagoons and estuaries, and adults are found at depths between {[convert20and200mft}}. This is a carnivorous species and off West Africa it was found that 58% of their diet is made up of fishes, 21% of stomatopods, 10% of crabs and 10% of cephalopods. There is a seasonal migration of this species off the coats of Senegal and Mauritania which is linked to an upwelling off the coasts of those nations. They are protogynous hermaphrodites with the females reaching sexual maturity on attainment of a total length of and at an age of 5-7 years and the sex change to males occurs when they are 10 to 13 years old.. Off Tunisia this species spawns during June and July while in Iskenderun Bay in Turkey, spawning starts in early June and continues up to late August. Taxonomy The white grouper was first formally described in 1817 as Serranus aeneus by the French naturalist √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1772-1844) with the type locality given as Egypt. Utilisation The white grouper is a very important quarry species for fisheries throughout its range, fishermen use hook-and-line and trawls to catch it. In Senegalese waters, artisanal fishers are the main landers of this species, however, there is a local commercial fishery which is set up for the export market, mainly to Europe. Overfishing is the major threat to the white grouper. Even where protected it has been targeted by poachers using spear guns and lights at night. It has been bred in aquaculture at the Israeli National Center for Mariculture. It is marketed fresh or preserved by smoking.

He graduated from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp) in 1979, a year before the Avant-garde fashion collective the Antwerp Six.  Life and work  After graduation, Margiela based himself in Paris and worked as a freelance designer for five years. Between 1985 and 1987 he worked for Jean Paul Gaultier, before showing his first collection under his own label Maison Margiela, which he started with his business partner Jenny Meirens in 1989. Between 1997 and 2003 he was the creative director of the Herm√®s women's line. Martin Margiela was appointed as a Guest member of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture in 2010. Margiela redesigns by hand objects such as old wigs, canvases and silk scarves into couture garments. During the 1980s, the Japanese avantgardists, with Rei Kawakubo, influenced the global fashion scene with their eccentric and ground-breaking designs. Margiela and the Antwerp Six would carry on the work, revolting against the luxurious fashion world with garments of oversized proportions such as long arms, and with linings, seams and hems on the outside. The concept of deconstruction embraced by Kawakubo matters also for Margiela's fashion statement. Throughout his career, Margiela has maintained a low personal profile. He has never given an interview and remains backstage after his shows. His face is not publicly known; throughout his career, only one known photo exists, taken in 1997 by Marcio Madeira (Zepplin photos) but never officially verified. All media contact is dealt with via fax. Maison Martin Margiela's ultra-discreet trademark consists of a piece of cloth with the numbers 0-23. The badge is attached to the inside with four small, white pick-stitches, exposed to the outside on unlined garments. For the 20th anniversary the anonymous tag was replaced by a classic logotype. Margiela's brand was acquired by the OTB Group in 2002 and industry insiders were quoted as suggesting that Margiela may desire to leave due to creative differences, or simply, \\"A desire to enjoy his life outside the insistent glare of the fashion world.\\" A 2008 article from the New York Times gave many in the fashion world their first glimpse of Margiela's face, as well as breaking the news that he allegedly offered to hand the reins of his company over to Raf Simons, who appears to have declined the offer. Haider Ackermann was later offered the position as creative director, but similarly turned it down. In October 2009, Margiela majority stakeholder Renzo Rosso, President of OTB Group, the holding group of Marni, Viktor & Rolf, and Diesel, publicly stated that, \\"Martin has not been there for a long time. He is here but not here. We have a new fresh design team on board. We are focusing on young, realistic energy for the future; this is really Margiela for the year 2015.\\" A press release announced in December 2009 that Margiela \\"has left the business.

Rossi finally left Dunfermline in December 2003 to re-sign for his first club Raja Casablanca. He stayed in Morocco for one year before moving to Al Khor in Qatar. International career He played for the Morocco national football team and was a participant at the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Managerial career Rossi was the Technical Director of Raja from 2009 to 2012 and 2014 to 2016. In November 2015, he claimed he had not been paid by Raja's President, Mohamed Boudrika, for nine months.

Drinkell was a centre forward, noted for his aerial ability and the number of headed goals he scored as a result. Career Drinkell began his career with hometown club Grimsby Town where he scored 89 goals in 272 games. His goals got him noticed by other clubs and in 1985 Norwich City manager Ken Brown signed him for a fee of ¬£90,000. Norwich were rebuilding their squad after relegation from the first division and had looked set to sign striker Trevor Senior from Reading, however when he opted to stay with the Royals they turned their attention to Drinkell. The fee was set by a Football League tribunal and the figure angered Grimsby, who considered his value to be much higher. Drinkell quickly proved that Norwich had indeed got a bargain. In his first season at Carrow Road he scored 22 league goals as Norwich won the Second Division championship. With the Canaries being Football League Cup holders, Drinkell would also have experienced UEFA Cup action that season had it not been for the ban on English clubs in European competitions arising from the Heysel disaster in May 1985. It won him the Golden Boot for being the division's top scorer as well as the first of two consecutive Norwich City player of the year awards. His goalscoring form continued in the First Division. His most memorable goal for Norwich ‚Äì by popular consensus among supporters ‚Äì came in a match against Liverpool on 11 April 1987 at Carrow Road. Liverpool were reigning league champions and were looking to regain the title. The score was 1‚Äì1 late in the game, when Drinkell picked up the ball at the edge of the area and hit a fierce shot from a difficult angle past Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar. It ended one of the most famous statistics in football, as it was the first time that Liverpool had lost a league match in which Ian Rush had scored. Norwich finished fifth that season, but Drinkell and his colleagues were once again denied the chance of UEFA Cup action, as UEFA voted for the ban on English clubs in European competitions to continue for at least another season. Drinkell added a further 12 league goals in 1987‚Äì88, though the Canaries finished in the bottom half of the table this time ‚Äì a decline in form which had seen Brown dismissed as manager in favour of coach Dave Stringer in December 1987. In total, Drinkell scored 57 goals in 150 games for the Canaries. In 1987, Drinkell rejected the chance of a move to Manchester United, just after the appointment of Alex Ferguson as their manager. Drinkell's exploits earned him a ¬£600,000 move to Rangers, who signed him ahead of Tottenham Hotspur in the 1988 close season. He won Scottish League Championship and Scottish League Cup medals at Ibrox, but lost his place to new signing Mo Johnston for the 1989‚Äì90 season and played just four more games for Rangers before his return to England in October 1989 when he signed for Coventry City. Despite scoring on his debut against his hometown team, Grimsby, in the Football League Cup, his goalscoring form deserted him at Highfield Road (he failed to score in any of his 15 league appearances in the 1990‚Äì91 season, and after a short loan spell with Birmingham City in the autumn of 1991 he began his coaching career in Scotland with Falkirk. He coached and managed Stirling Albion before becoming Montrose manager in 1998. In 2002, Norwich City fans voted Drinkell an inaugural member of the Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame. As of 2012, Drinkell was working as a football player agent. He had a brief spell as assistant manager of Second Division club East Fife in 2013.

Among its alumni are Sierra Leone's first Prime Minister, Sir Milton Margai and Sierra Leone's first president, Siaka Stevens and Chernor Bah. The school is sometimes referred to as Mende Man College reflecting the fact that over the years students from the Mende tribe in Sierra Leone were overrepresented. AA students have also been referred to as Okamory Boys due to the area in which the school is located in Freetown. However, the school has students from everywhere in Sierra Leone and it is not restricted to any tribe. Although the school has a Christian tradition, the United Methodist Church, students from all religious background can attend. It has alumni associations in the UK, USA and Freetown. The alumni associations make contributions to the school including, for example, giving scholarships and grants to students.  History  A girls' school had been established in the British colony of Sierra Leone in Moyamba in 1900, and it was decided to establish a similar boys' school. The UBC mission was responsible for finding land for the school, and originally proposed locating it in Shenge, the home of missionary Ira Albert. Eventually, however, the board decided that Shenge was too small, so they established the school in the colony's capital at Freetown. The Albert Academy was founded on 4 October 1904, and was named after Ira Albert, who had recently been killed in a boating accident. When the academy was founded, it had just one teacher, a Mr L Turner, and four pupils. The first principal was Reverend Raymond P. Dougherty, with Edwin Hursh as vice principal. The original location was in Freetown's East Street. In 1907, the academy relocated to its present location on Berry Street.

Lifton (born September 20, 1939) is an American author who wrote the 1981 bestseller Best Evidence: Disguise and Deception in the Assassination of John F. Kennedy, a work that puts forth evidence that there was a conspiracy to assassinate John F. Kennedy. Biography Lifton grew up in Rockaway Beach, New York. He graduated from Cornell University's School of Engineering Physics in 1962 and thereupon enrolled in the University of California, Los Angeles to work on an advance degree in engineering. While there Lifton worked nights as a computer engineer for North American Aviation, a contractor for the Apollo program. In autumn 1964, around the time the Warren Report was published, Lifton became interested in the JFK case after attending a lecture on the topic of the conspiracy to cover up the Kennedy assassination by Mark Lane. Lifton purchased a set of the 26 volumes of the Warren Commission's investigation and started his own research on the Kennedy case. In 1966, Lifton was dismissed from UCLA for neglecting his studies. He quit his aerospace job, devoting all his time to the Kennedy assassination. The January 1967 issue of Ramparts magazine presented a \\"special report\\" by Lifton, with David Welsh, entitled \\"The Case for Three Assassins\\" that laid out the scenario that more than one assassin was firing at Kennedy based on anomalies in the medical evidence. In 1993, Lifton was played by Robert Picardo in the television movie Fatal Deception: Mrs. Lee Harvey Oswald. He testified before the Assassination Records Review Board in September 1996, and provided the Board with various materials including 35mm interpositives of the Zapruder film, as well as copies of audiotapes, videotapes, and transcripts of witness interviews he conducted. As of 2010, Lifton lived in West Los Angeles where he was working full-time on a major written work about Oswald entitled Final Charade.Lifton, David April 15, 2010, retrieved May 20, 2012 Best Evidence After Lifton's book Best Evidence: Disguise and Deception in the Assassination of John F. Kennedy was rejected by 21 or 23 other publishers, Macmillan gave Lifton a $10,000 advance and published his book in 1981. Due to the controversial nature of the book, Macmillan went to unusual lengths to fact- check the book; it was \\"examined for potential factual errors by in-house counsel, an outside law firm, a forensic pathologist, and a neurosurgeon.\\" The book eventually reached #4 on The New York Times Best Seller list and was a Book of the Month Club selection. In 1990, Edwin McDowell of The New York Times described Best Evidence as \\"one of the most durable\\" of the dozens of books about the Kennedy assassination. According to Kent Carroll of Carroll & Graf Publishers, who reprinted a soft-cover version in 1988, the book sold 60,000 copies in 1990 alone. In the updated 1988 edition of Best Evidence, Lifton was responsible for the first publication of a series of autopsy photographs taken of President Kennedy at Bethesda Naval Medical Center. Lifton had acquired these photos after the initial publication of Best Evidence, from a former Secret Service employee who had made private copies with the permission of Agent Roy Kellerman. Lifton also used the photos during his appearance on the October 1988 PBS Nova episode Who Shot President Kennedy?, which marked the first time they were shown on television. Lifton claims that the actual photographs are consistent with his thesis of body alteration. =Summary= Best Evidence is written in the first-person as a chronological narrative of his 15-year search for the truth about the Kennedy assassination. It is not written just as a theory of what took place on November 22, 1963, but also to highlight his personal quest to solve the puzzle through a meticulous and time-consuming search for new evidence that could finally resolve the many factual conflicts in the record. The central thesis of the book is that President Kennedy‚Äôs body had been altered between the Dallas hospital and the autopsy site at Bethesda for the purpose of creating erroneous conclusions about the number and direction of the shots. He details evidence‚Äîusing both the Warren Commission documents and original research and interviews with those involved at both Dallas and Bethesda‚Äîof a stark and radical change between the descriptions of the wounds by the medical staff at Dallas and those at Bethesda. For instance, nearly all the Dallas medical staff thought the head wound entered from the front and exited through a 2-in. by 2.-in. hole in the exterior. The autopsy, on the contrary, reported a massive exit wound in the front (about 4x the size of the reports of the Dallas staff), which would indicate a shot from the rear. It was these sort of conflicts that drove his quest. The Warren Commission had ultimately resolved them through relying on what was considered the ‚Äúbest evidence‚Äù, the autopsy report and photos; but that didn‚Äôt satisfy Lifton. As Lifton was methodically working through the 26-volume Warren Commission report and exhibits, he stumbled upon what would become the fulcrum of his narrative, the answer he was looking for. He read, according to a report by FBI agents Siebert and O'Neill who attended the autopsy and took notes on everything they observed, that it was \\"apparent that a tracheotomy had been performed...as well as surgery of the head area, namely, in the top of the skull.\\" Since Lifton knew that there was no surgery to the head in Dallas, this was the fact that intensified and focused his research, leading ultimately to the synthesis of the contradictory Dallas/Bethesda evidence to his conclusion that there was intentional fraud, that is, as Lifton puts it, a ‚Äúmedical forgery‚Äù to the body of the President. In connection with his body alteration theory, Lifton hypothesized about when and where the alteration took place. He posits that after John F. Kennedy's assassination, unnamed conspirators on Air Force One removed Kennedy's body from its original bronze casket and placed it in a shipping casket, while en route from Dallas to Washington. Once the presidential plane arrived at Andrews Air Force Base, the shipping casket with the President's body in it was surreptitiously taken by helicopter from the side of the plane that was out of the television camera's view. Kennedy's body was then taken to an unknown location ‚Äî most likely Walter Reed Army Medical Center ‚Äî where the body was surgically altered to make it appear that he was shot only from the rear.Best Evidence: Disguise and Deception in the Assassination of John F.

Among the explicitly stated clear implications of the book are the following: The assassination was an ‚Äúinside‚Äù job with, at minimum, a number of secret service men involved‚Äîthe ones who controlled the scene and the evidence and Oswald was, as he stated after his arrest, ‚Äúa patsy.\\" (film). =Reception= Ed Magnuson of Time described the theory as \\"bizarre\\", but wrote that Lifton's work was \\"meticulously researched\\". According to Magnuson: \\"Preposterous? Absolutely. Yet there is virtually no factual claim in Lifton's book that is not supported by the public record or his own interviews, many of them with the lowly hospital and military bystanders whom official probes had overlooked.\\" Thomas Powers gave a critical review of the book in New York magazine stating: \\"There are a lot of curious theories about what happened to John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, but none quite so bizarre as David Lifton's, a theory that makes all previous speculation about the president's murder... look like the work of dull and sober men.\\" Powers' review was particularly harsh on Lifton's publisher, adding \\"Lifton is not to blame for this travesty\\" and asserting that Macmillan owed an apology to everyone involved in the transport of Kennedy's body from Dallas to Washington. Reviewing the book for The New York Times, Harrison Salisbury wrote: \\"...no one before Mr. Lifton has constructed a theory so complicated, so quirky, in such violation of every law of common sense and reason.\\" Discussing some of the books espousing a conspiracy in the assassination of Kennedy, Stephen E. Ambrose wrote in 1992: \\"Mr. Lifton argues that the conspirators who killed Kennedy got possession of Kennedy's body somewhere between Dallas and Washington, then removed his brain and otherwise altered his body and wounds to support a single-gunman theory. Mr. Lifton's account of how this was done is almost impossible to follow, almost impossible to believe and almost impossible to refute.\\" Author and lawyer Gerald Posner has described Lifton's book as \\"one of the most unusual conspiracy theories\\" that \\"relies on an elaborate shell game involving rapid exchanges of coffins, a decoy ambulance, and a switched body shroud. He contends that once the body (of President Kennedy) was stolen from Air Force One, a covert team of surgeons surgically altered the corpse before the autopsy later that day...purportedly...so the autopsy physicians would determine the bullets that hit the President were fired from the rear...thereby sealing the case against Oswald.\\"Case Closed: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination of JFK , pp.296-297 Vincent Bugliosi devoted twelve pages to Lifton's theory in his 2007 book, Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Bugliosi prefaced his comments stating that the \\"theory is so unhinged that it really doesn't deserve one word in any serious treatment of the assassination\\", but that he was \\"forced to devote some time to talking about nonsense of a most exquisite nature\\" due to the number of people who treated it seriously. There were many negative reviews from the major-media outlets, noting poor documentation and spurious claims. According to a Los Angeles Times article about Mr. Lifton: \\"The Orlando Sentinel Star went so far as to compare the book in stature and import to William L. Shirer's 'The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.' Other reviewers characterized Lifton's work as 'meticulously detailed,' 'methodical and well-documented' and 'a challenge to the Warren Commission.'\\"  References  Category:1939 births Category:Cornell University alumni Category:Researchers of the assassination of John F.

It was originally shown in theaters alongside The Amazing Panda Adventure (in North America) and The Pebble and the Penguin (internationally). It was subsequently released on video packaged with older Looney Tunes cartoons and was included in the special edition DVD, and later HD DVD and Blu-ray, releases of Casablanca, the film to which it is both a parody and an homage. At the time of release, WB did not own the rights to Casablanca (such rights were with Turner Entertainment ‚Äì they still technically hold the film today, but WB became responsible for distribution a year after the short's release as a result of their parent company's purchase of Turner in 1996). Unlike the previous modern Looney Tunes shorts, this short was not made by the Greg Ford/Terry Lennon team nor Chuck Jones Film Productions. It was produced by the Animaniacs writing team at Warner Bros. Feature Animation. Carrotblanca was the only Looney Tunes short produced by that group of writers and the Feature Animation division. The short involves nearly all the major Looney Tunes characters in roles from the film, including Bugs Bunny as Rick, Daffy Duck as Sam and Pep√© Le Pew as Captain Renault. Some characters use their real names, others the names of the characters in the original film, or parodic versions. Several minor Looney Tunes characters can be seen in the background (such as Pete Puma as a waiter wearing a kaftan and fez, and Giovanni Jones and The Crusher as the maitre d' and doorman). Plot General Pandemonium (Yosemite Sam as Major Strasser) gets a frantic call from Foghorn Leghorn saying that a secret German document has been stolen, and immediately heads for the Carrotblanca nightclub‚Äïthe Cafe Au Lait Americain. At the nightclub, Usmarte (Tweety Bird as Ugarte, depicted like Peter Lorre), the actual thief, convinces Bugs Bunny (as Rick Blaine) to take the document. Meanwhile, Sylvester Slazlo (as Victor Lazlo) and his wife Kitty Ketty (Penelope Pussycat as Ilsa) arrive at the club. Ketty attracts the unwanted attention of Captain Louis (Pep√© Le Pew) but she scratches him and throws him into the wall. Ketty, who is the ex- girlfriend of Bugs, asks Daffy Duck (as Sam) to play her favorite song. General Pandemonium suspects Sylvester may know about the document and binds him in his office. Ketty pleads with Bugs to help Sylvester out of this. Though Bugs is initially reluctant due to the fact that Ketty broke his heart, he goes to the General's office nevertheless and confuses the General himself into jail. The story climaxes with Sylvester and Ketty escaping on the plane for Toronto, New York City and Cucamonga, as Bugs watches them go... except that they find Louis on the plane working as a steward. Louis asks Ketty, \\"Coffee, tea, or moi?\\", causing her to jump out of the plane in fright, seemingly without a parachute, landing right in front of Bugs. They kiss, then the parachute opens, covering them. The Warner Bros. Family Entertainment logo appears with \\"That's All Folks!\\" written on top of it. Tweety pops up and says (in Peter Lorre's voice) \\"That's All Folks!\\" and the cartoon ends off. This cartoon contains the Looney Tunes-logo, but the Merrie Melodies-leader can be heard.

Kuhn Library & Gallery, University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Accessed February 28, 2011. Its mission statement says:  History  On 6 April 1959 the United States National Academy of Sciences passed a resolution for the establishment of a \\"national society of cell biology to act as a national representative to the International Federation for Cell Biology\\". The ASCB was first organized at an ad hoc meeting in the office of Keith R. Porter at Rockefeller University on May 28, 1960. In the 1940s, Porter was one of the first scientists in the world to use the then- revolutionary technique of electron microscopy (EM) to reveal the internal structure of cells. Other early ASCB leaders‚ÄîGeorge Palade, Don Fawcett, Hewson Swift, Arthur Solomon, and Hans Ris‚Äîalso were EM pioneers. All early ASCB leaders were concerned that existing scientific societies and existing biology journals were not receptive to this emerging field that studied the cell as the fundamental unit of all life. The ASCB was legally incorporated in New York State on July 31, 1961. A call for membership went out, enlisting ASCB's first 480 members. The first ASCB Annual Meeting was held November 2‚Äì4, 1961, in Chicago, where 844 attendees gathered for three days of lectures, slides, and movies showing cellular structure. The results of a mail ballot were read out and Fawcett was declared ASCB's first president. The ASCB did not remain an EM society. New technologies and new discoveries in molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry, and light microscopy quickly widened the field. Cell biology has continued to expand ever since, extending its impact on clinical medicine and pharmacology while drawing on new technologies in bioengineering, high-resolution imaging, massive data handling, and genomic sequencing. By 1963, the membership consisted of 9,000 scientists. In 2008 it was reported that ASCB had 11,000 members worldwide. Today, 25% of ASCB members work outside the United States). Annual meetings now draw upwards of 5,000 people. Since 1960, 32 past or current ASCB members have won Nobel Prizes in medicine or in chemistry.  Publications  Print publications: *Molecular Biology of the Cell: An online journal of scholarly research reports and essays published 24 times a year. *CBE- Life Sciences Education: An online peer-reviewed journal of life science education research and evidence-based practice. *ASCB Newsletter: The ASCB's monthly newsletter updating members and policymakers on issues, public policy, society programs and events, grants, career advice, and more. Online publication: *The ASCB Post: The latest in science news, insights, and blogs.  Annual meeting  Typically held within the first two weeks of December, the ASCB's annual meeting brings together scientists in the field of cell biology to highlight the latest research, techniques, products, and services, providing a venue for networking and career advice, offering research-tested educational approaches for high school teachers and professors who teach undergraduates, and to spur future discovery and collaboration. The ASCB also presents awards, poster sessions (where students, postdoctoral fellows, and independent scientists present their research and receive feedback), scientific sessions (symposia, minisymposia, working groups, workshops, translational sessions, special interest subgroups, award lectures, and exhibits). Science discussion tables offer opportunities to discuss scientific topics with expert scientists, and the career discussion roundtables offer a variety of career topic-themed tables addressed with expert facilitators. In addition, special sessions focus on advocacy, media and public outreach, and special issues of interest to women, minorities, gay, lesbian, and transgender students/scientists, the media, etc. The 2012 meeting resulted in the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment.

The database will advance research on cellular activity with the ultimate goal of improving human health.  San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment  At the American Society for Cell Biology meeting in San Francisco in 2012, scientists developed the Declaration on Research Assessment, which calls for scientific output to be measured accurately and evaluated wisely. It also calls for scientists and institutions to reevaluate the use of impact factor to assess individual scientific efforts.

He captains the West Indies cricket team in limited overs cricket. An aggressive all-rounder, Pollard is a medium-pace bowler and big-hitting batsman in the middle-order. After shining during the 2009 Champions League, he was signed by both the Southern Redbacks and Somerset for their domestic Twenty20 campaigns. He was the joint highest paid player in the 2010 Indian Premier League, playing for Mumbai Indians. In September 2019, Kieron Pollard was named as the captain of the West Indies' One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) teams. In March 2020, Pollard became the first cricketer to play in 500 Twenty20 matches. Career =Early life= Pollard was born in Tacarigua, Trinidad and Tobago, where he was raised, along with two younger sisters, in a poor home by his single mother. Speaking about it, Pollard reflects \\"It was pretty tough, it wasn't ideal getting up and your mum say 'We only have X of money'.\\" After representing Trinidad and Tobago in the 2005 TCL Group West Indies Under-19 Challenge, he was selected as part of the West Indies Under-19 cricket team to tour Pakistan. Pollard top-scored for the West Indies in the first youth One Day International (ODI), scoring 53 runs off 49 balls. Pollard made another half-century in the second match, but didn't manage to make double figures in either of last two games. He was named in the West Indies squad for the 2006 U/19 Cricket World Cup, held in Sri Lanka, where he only managed to make 19‚Äìruns in his four innings, though he did manage to take two wickets in a defeat to Australia. Kieron Pollard bowling for Somerset during the 2010 FPt20. During the 2006 English season he came to England to play for Haxey CC in Lincolnshire; he played five games for the club before he was recalled by Trinidad and Tobago to play in the Stanford Twenty20. Pollard made his senior debut for Trinidad and Tobago in the twenty20 competition against the Cayman Islands in July 2006. He finished the tournament with a respectable return of six wickets, and starred in the semi- final against Nevis, scoring 83 runs off just 38 balls, an innings which included 7 sixes to book Trinidad and Tobago's place in the final. He made his first-class debut six months later against Barbados, and marked the occasion with a century. As in the Twenty20, his innings contained a large number of boundaries, with 86 of his 126 runs coming from either fours or sixes. A score of 46 not out on his List A debut ensured that Pollard was in the selector's minds for the upcoming World Cup, and he described it as \\"a dream come true\\" when he was selected in the provisional 30-man squad for the tournament. Pollard's \\"dream run\\" continued with half-centuries in both four-day and 50-over matches against Guyana, followed by his second first-class century, coming against the Leeward Islands. Against Jamaica, Pollard showed his bowling ability, claiming four wickets in his seven overs to claim his fifth man of the match award in his 15th senior match. Trinidad and Tobago remained unbeaten in the 2006‚Äì07 KFC Cup, beating Windward Islands in the final to claim the trophy. Pollard finished as the competition's leading run-scorer, making 261 runs from his seven innings at an average of over 40. =Later career= The 2008‚Äì09 West Indies Cricket Board Cup saw an improvement in Pollard's bowling, as he claimed nine wickets in the competition with a bowling average of 14.22. An all-round performance against Jamaica in the semi-finals, in which he took three wickets and made 76, earnt Trinidad and Tobago a place in the final, and Pollard the man of the match award. In the 2009 Champions league T-20 for Trinidad & Tobago, Pollard hit 54 runs in just 18 balls in the 15th match against New South Wales in Hyderabad. This earned the man of the match award and his side a crucial win. His display of hitting was so impressive that NSW approached Pollard after the game and attempted to sign him for themselves. Pollard has also represented the South Australian Redbacks in the KFC Twenty20 Big Bash and Somerset County Cricket Club for the 2010 Friends Provident t20. Although named in the provisional 30-man squad for the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, Pollard failed to make the cut for the tournament. The absence of Pollard and Lendl Simmons from the West Indies performance squad in 2007‚Äì08 was described as \\"baffling\\" by Tony Cozier, describing how the pair \\"had been seemingly identified as among those for the future but have quickly been shunted aside.\\" Pollard was disappointing as Trinidad and Tobago won the 2007‚Äì08 Stanford Twenty20, averaging nine from his three innings. Kieron Pollard batting for Somerset during the 2010 FPt20.Pollard was recalled to the West Indies ODI squad for the series against Sri Lanka. The match was rained off after 18.2 overs of the West Indian run- chase with Pollard not required to bat. He retained his place in the squad for the home series against Australia, but after scores of 11 and 0 in the first two matches, he was dropped for the final three. Despite his poor form in the previous season's Stanford Twenty20, Pollard was named as part of the initial 32-member Stanford Superstars Twenty20 squad. The squad would provide the starters for the US$20 million winner-takes-all match against England later in the year. After a series of practice matches, Pollard was included in the team for the warm-up match against his Trinidad and Tobago side, where he made 24 runs off 14 balls and claimed the wicket of captain Daren Ganga. He followed this up with a nine-ball 27 against Middlesex, including three consecutive sixes in the last over. In the final, Pollard claimed the wickets of Andrew Flintoff and Luke Wright to help limit England to a total of 99, which Super Stars openers Chris Gayle and Andre Fletcher chased down in 12.4 overs. In May 2019, Cricket West Indies (CWI) named him as one of ten reserve players in the West Indies' squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. In December 2019, during the series against India, Pollard became the fourth batsman for the West Indies to score 1,000 runs in T20I cricket. On March 4 2020, in the first T20I match against Sri Lanka, Pollard became the first cricketer to play in 500 Twenty20 matches. In the same match, Pollard also scored his 10,000th run in the format. =Indian Premier League= Pollard's impressive performance in the 2009 Champions League Twenty20 and the Big Bash led to him being one of the most sought after players at the 2010 IPL auction. After some aggressive bidding, the Chennai Super Kings, Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers Bangalore all bid the maximum allowed; $750,000. A 'silent- tiebreaker' was won by the Mumbai Indians. 2010 Kieron Pollard made his debut for Mumbai Indians on 17 March 2010 against the Delhi Daredevils at Feroz Shah Kotla in Delhi. It took a while for him to get off the blocks in his first season. He however proved his money's worth in the latter stages of the tournament with a blistering 13 ball 45 laced with 5 sixes and accounted for 2 run outs earning him his first MOTM performance. This was followed by a stellar performance against the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the semi final. Pollard smashed a quick fire 33* off 13 balls with 3 sixes and followed it up with 3 wickets and 1 run out. He was adjudged man of the match and his efforts propelled Mumbai Indians into the final for the first time where they eventually lost to the Chennai Super Kings. 2011 and 2012 2010 season was followed by 2 mediocre seasons for Pollard. In 2011 the only highlight was his brilliance in the field. In 2012 a sole Man of the match performance against Rajasthan Royals where he smashed a 33 ball 64 with 6 4s and 4 6s and followed it up with a career best 4-44in the 2nd innings. 2013 Pollard started the season strongly with a stellar knock of 57*off 38 balls with 5 sixes when Mumbai had lost early wickets and in the 2nd innings he picked up 1 wicket and a superb catch of MS Dhoni ensured Mumbai Indians victory. He was adjudged MOTM for his all round performance. Against the Royal Challengers Bangalore he propelled Mumbai to a competitive score with a 16 ball-34. Arguably one of Pollards best performances came against the Sunsrisers Hyderabad. With over 60 odd runs to chase in 4 overs pollard joined skipper Rohit Sharma and lit the Wankhede up with a splendid 66* off 27 balls. He hit 6 sixes in a span of 7 balls and led Mumbai to an emphatic victory. Pollard saved his best performance for the Final against Chennai. With Mumbai reeling at 52‚Äì4 Pollard fought back with a 60* off 32 balls to lead Mumbai to a competitive score of 148. In the 2nd innings he picked 1 wicket and Mumbai won their 1st IPL Title. 2014 Mumbai Indians got of to a disastrous start losing their first five games in UAE. Pollard smashed 78 off 48 balls whilst chasing against SRH but he was dismissed by Irfan Pathan in the last over and Mumbai eventually lost the match. In the first game at Wankhede against Punjab Pollard chipped in with a crucial 28 off just 12 balls and helped Mumbai register their first win of the season. 2015 This can be rightly called as Pollard's best season till date.Similar to 2014 Mumbai had a forgettable start to the season managing only 1 win out of the first 6 matches. Pollard struck 70 runs off 48 balls with 7 boundaries and 5 sixes against Rajasthan but Mumbai lost the match. He followed it up with another 64 runs off just 34 balls smashing 5 sixes against Chennai but again Mumbai were unable to defend their total. Chasing against the Delhi Daredevils Pollard joined Rayudu and smashed a quck-fire 26* off just 14 balls and ensured victory. In the same week he smashed 49 off just 24 balls with 6 sixes but Mumbai were unable to chase RCB's mammoth total. In a must win game against Kolkata Pollard played a patient knock with Hardik Pandya and helped Mumbai reach 171. Yususf Pathan led the KKR chase with a brilliant half century and the equation was 12 runs required off the final over. Pollard with ball in his hand dismissed Pathan on the very first ball, conceded 6 runs in the next 2 balls but followed it up with 3 dot balls to help Mumbai to a crucial victory. In the first qualifier at Wankhede against the Super Kings Pollard helped Mumbai post a massive total of 187 with 17 ball 41 with 5 sixes and helped Mumbai reach the final. In the final against the same opposition at Eden Gardens, Pollard added 36 off just 18 balls and helped MI reach a massive total of 202. Mumbai Indians defeated Chennai to win their 2nd IPL title. Pollard ended the tournament with 419 runs at SR of 163 and 28 sixes. 2019 Pollard did not have the best of IPL in this one. However he played a couple of crucial innings for his team, once again Mumbai Indians. In a low-scoring match against the Sunrisers Hyderabad, Mumbai were asked to bat first and had lost their top 3 inside the first 10 overs. From the 17th over onwards, Pollard started his massacre when he hit 4 sixes and 2 fours in that span to make a 46* off 26 balls, and get Mumbai a defendable total of 136, given their bowling. Mumbai bundled out Hyderabad for 96 runs where West Indian bowler Alzarri Joseph took 6 wickets for 12 runs in debut. Then, in a match against Kings XI Punjab, wherein Punjab gave them a target of 198 in 20 overs. Mumbai did not have the best of starts with not even 70 runs on the board after 11 overs, at the loss of 4 wickets. Pollard then took it upon himself wherein he made 83 runs off just 31 balls, which included 10 sixes and 2 fours, and ensured Mumbai did not fall short of the target even after his dismissal. In the final against CSK, he smashed a 41* of 25 deliveries, to ensure that Mumbai reached a somewhat respectable total of 149 in their allotted 20 overs. They ultimately won the tournament after a sensational final over spell by teammate Lasith Malinga, where he defended 9 runs of the final over, producing a wicket of the final delivery where 2 runs were required. He was named the ‚ÄòSuper Striker of the match‚Äô.  2020  In his 11th consecutive year playing for the Mumbai Indians, Pollard became the first player to represent the franchise in 150 matches. =ICC Twenty20 World Cup 2010= After his impressive performance at Indian Premier League for the Mumbai Indians, the West Indian all-rounder was picked in the West Indian squad for 2010 ICC World Twenty20. =Domestic 2010 season= Pollard had a successful 2010 Friends Provident t20 for Somerset, helping them to the final of the competition on 14 August 2010. He scored 354 runs during the competition at 32.18 ‚Äì the second highest Somerset batting average ‚Äì including two half centuries at a strike rate of 175.24 runs per 100 balls. He also took 29 wickets at 15.10, second among all Somerset's bowlers. He took an impressive catch on the boundary in the semi final against Nottinghamshire, and then scored 22 from seven balls in the final match against Hampshire, including two sixes and a four, before Dominic Cork injured him with a bouncer that required hospital treatment. On the back of Pollard's domestic performance he was offered a central contract which he turned down because that would force him to be available for West Indies selection all the time and Pollard wanted to play Twenty20 cricket as well. Despite this his good performances meant that he was selected for the West Indies in the ODI and Twenty20 series against Sri Lanka as several high-profile names such as Denesh Ramdin and Ramnaresh Sarwan had been dropped. =Pakistan Super League= Pollard was bought by Karachi Kings for US$140,000 in 2017 Pakistan Super League players draft. In a do or die match against Lahore Qalandars he scored 45 runs off 20 balls to help his team to stay in the tournament, later he was judged man of the match. He played for Multan Sultans in PSL 3. He was picked by Peshawar Zalmi in 2019 Pakistan Super League players draft. =Other T20 franchise leagues= On 3 June 2018, he was selected to play for the Toronto Nationals in the players' draft for the inaugural edition of the Global T20 Canada tournament.

As a result of a vision, in 1819 he banished liquor from his people's territory. During the Indian Removal of the late 1830s, he was the only chief who remained in the hills to rebuild the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, joined by others who had escaped or eluded the United States soldiers. Before that time, he had adopted William Holland Thomas as his son; the fatherless European-American youth was working at the trading post and had learned Cherokee. Yonaguska taught him Cherokee ways and, after Thomas became an attorney, he represented the tribe in negotiations with the federal government. Thomas was never a Chief of any Cherokee band but played important roles. Thomas bought land and established a Cherokee reserve for the tribe's use at what is now the Qualla Boundary, the territory of the federally recognized tribe in North Carolina. During his life, Yonaguska was a reformer and a prophet; he was a leader who recognized the destructive power of the white man's liquor and the settlers' insatiable greed for Cherokee lands. Early life Yonaguska was born about 1759 in the Cherokee Lower Towns of present-day North Carolina and Georgia. According to the Cherokee matrilineal system of inheritance and descent, he was considered born into his Cherokee mother's clan, where he gained his status. As a boy of 12, Yonaguska had a vision that the European Americans threatened the Cherokee way of life, but people did not pay attention when he spoke of it. At age 17, he witnessed widespread destruction by Gen. Griffith Rutherford and his North Carolina militia, who in 1776 burned 36 Cherokee towns during the military action. The Cherokee had been allied with the British, and the colonials were trying to discourage them from acting in the coming revolution. Yonaguska was described as a strikingly handsome man, strongly built, and standing . He suffered from becoming addicted to alcohol as a young man. He and his wife adopted as their son William Holland Thomas, a fatherless European-American youth who worked at the trading post at Qualla Town and learned the Cherokee language. Thomas learned many Cherokee ways. Awakening In 1819 when he was 60 years old, Yonaguska became critically ill. He had a vision, which he told his people after recovering. His message from the spirit world was that, \\"The Cherokee must never again drink whiskey. Whiskey must be banished.\\" He had Will Thomas write out a pledge: \\"The undersigned Cherokees, belonging to the town of Qualla agree to abandon the use of spirituous liquors.\\" Yonaguska signed it, followed by the council (chiefs of the clans) and town residents. From the signing of the pledge until Yonaguska's death in 1839 at the age of 80, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians refrained from using liquor. On the few occasions when he learned of someone breaking the pledge, Yonaguska had the culprit whipped. Throughout the early 19th century, federal agents tried to persuade Yonaguska to remove his people to lands west of the Mississippi River. He firmly resisted their efforts, declaring that the Cherokee were safer among their rocks and mountains, and belonged in their ancestral homeland. Other chiefs made the Treaty of 1819, by which they sold Cherokee lands along the Tuckasegee River. At the time, Yonaguska was given set aside in a bend of the river between Ela and Bryson City, including the ancient Mississippian culture site of Kituwa, which the Cherokee held sacred. As pressure increased by the federal government for removal of Indians from the Southeast, Yonaguska rejected every offer for land exchange and subsidies. Having seen European-American settlers push westward through North Carolina, he did not believe they would ever be satisfied. He did not want to leave his homeland and face more removal pressure later. He thought the United States government promises of protection were \\"too often broken; they are like the reeds in yonder river‚Äîthey are all lies.\\" The missionary Samuel Goodenough worked with Elias Boudinot to translate and print the Gospel of St Matthew in Cherokee. Yonaguska insisted on hearing it read to him before allowing its circulation. He reportedly said about the gospel: > Well, it seems a good book - strange that the white people are no better, > after having had it so long. p31 Yonaguska approved the distribution of the scriptures to his people. Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians The treaties of 1817 and 1819 with the federal government reduced the territory of the Cherokee Nation in North Carolina, as they gave up land to European-American settlers. In 1824 Yonaguska gathered the remaining Cherokee outside the new boundaries. They settled together at Soco Creek on lands purchased for them by his adopted son, Will Thomas, as the Cherokee were not allowed to buy land outside their nation. Although adopted as Yonaguska's son, Thomas was still considered \\"white\\" under the law and could legally buy land; he could also allow the Cherokee to live on \\"his\\" property. Purchased for the use of the Cherokee, his land was the basis of Qualla Boundary. It is now the territory of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, a federally recognized tribe. Death Shortly before his death in April 1839, Yonaguska was carried into the town house at Soco, where he gave a last talk to his people. The old man commended Thomas to them as their chief and warned them against ever leaving their own country. Wrapping his blanket around him, he quietly lay back and died. Yonaguska was buried beside Soco Creek, about a mile below the old Macedonia mission, with a mound of stones to mark the spot. References SourcesBlankenship, Bob.

On 1 February 1974, the Indian Railways announced the first railway service between Visakhapatnam and Hyderabad, with the Waltair-Hyderabad Express. The train was run on a daily basis and would depart Visakhapatnam at 5:20 pm and arrive in Hyderabad at 6:45 am, the next morning. On the return journey, it would depart Hyderabad at 5:15 pm and arrive in Visakhapatnam at 5:50 am the next morning. As the train provides rail connectivity to at nine stations in the deserted cities of East and West Godavari districts, it was officially named Godavari Express. It was regularly hauled by a steam locomotive and had 17 coaches. It reached its highest speed of 50 km/h between Samalkot and Rajahmundry. A slip service was introduced in the train during 1975, and the train was run up to Kakinada. Five more coaches were added, as a result. The train also entered a Rake Sharing Agreement or RSA with the Simhadri Express which ran between Visakhapatnam and Rajahmundry. However, in 1980, both the slip service and the RSA were cancelled as the Simhadri Express was extended up to Bhimavaram and the Kakinada-Secunderabad Goutami Express was introduced. Background The train retained its 5 new coaches and ran with a diesel locomotive end to end. By 1990, the train had become very popular and two more coaches were introduced, taking the total to 24. It then became one of the longest trains in India. As the Visakhapatnam-Vijayawada line and the Vijayawada-Kazipet- Hyderabad lines were electrified, the train started running with the WAP 4 electric locomotive. Soon, the Godavari Express became the first train belonging to the South Central Railway to run with 5 air-conditioned coaches. In June 1999, the train met with its first incident, as it derailed at Ghanpur near Warangal. In the year 2000, the Godavari Express became the first train in the South Central railway to run with its own air conditioned first class coach and was also the first train in the Zone to have 6 air-conditioned coaches. In the year 2011, the train was re-numbered to 12727 on becoming a Superfast train and was hauled by a WAP 7 between Vijayawada and Hyderabad. The train timings were modified again and the journey time was further reduced by 15 minutes. In July and August 2011, the passengers of the air-conditioned coaches of the Godavari Express were robbed twice and a hoax call was made regarding a bomb in the sixth coach of the train. As a result, safety was enhanced and the train started running with a WAP 7 from end to end. This train then became the first to run with a WAP 7 between Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada. Hundreds of people from Viziangaram and Srikakulam districts are travelling to Secunderabad daily through Godavari Express.  LHB Coaches  The train was upgraded with modern LHB coaches on 1 June 2020 which was run from both Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam by South Central Railway. Previously It was Upgraded as an Utkrist CBC rake train in 2018 which was running till 22 March 2020 after which lock down started.

He played in the 2006 U-19 Cricket World Cup in Sri Lanka and has represented the West Indies in Test and One Day International cricket. Roach made his Test debut in 2009 against Bangladesh when the West Indies team was weakened due to a player strike, and impressed with his bowling so that he was given an opportunity to play when the team returned to its full strength. A fast bowler, Roach is capable of express speeds and has reached on a number of occasions, and was the 7th fastest active bowler as of 3 January 2015.T OP 10 Fastest Bowlers in Current Cricket In 2012 he became the first West Indies bowler to take 10 wickets in a Test since 2005. International career =Early representation= On 7 June 2008, Roach was selected in the West Indies Test squad to face Australia in the third Test. At the time he had played in only four first-class matches. He was not picked for the final team and said \\"I know that when a Test match comes around, they sometimes draft in players in the island where the match is, but I wasn't expecting to be in the squad. I'm quite happy to be there. If selected, I want to put in a good performance\\". Roach made his international debut on 20 June 2008 in a Twenty20 international against Australia; it was also the first senior Twenty20 match he had played in. He finished with the best bowling figures in the match of 2/29 from three overs, claiming the scalps of Shaun Marsh and Luke Ronchi as the West Indies won by seven wickets. Roach was drafted into the squad for the last two ODIs against Australia in July 2008 after Australia won the first three games and sealed a series victory. Roach did not play in the last two matches of the series against Australia and had to wait until the triangular series with Bermuda and Canada to make his debut. On 20 August 2008 Roach ‚Äì along with fellow debutants Leon Johnson and Brendan Nash ‚Äì made his first appearance for the West Indies in a One Day International. He finished with figures of 10‚Äì1‚Äì29‚Äì2 as the West Indies beat Bermuda by six wickets. His first wicket was that of Steven Outerbridge and his second was the Bermuda captain, Irving Romaine. He played in the second match of the series, taking 1/49 from eight overs against Canada as the West Indies won by 49 runs but did not play in the final against Canada which the West Indies won. On 1 November 2008, the ODI squad to tour Pakistan was announced, with Roach as one of the members. John Dyson, the West Indies coach, said that Roach was expected to put the more experienced and established bowlers such as Fidel Edwards and Jerome Taylor under pressure for a place in the team. On the same day, it was announced that Roach was one of four players ‚Äì along with Lionel Baker, Leon Johnson, and Brendan Nash ‚Äì without a Test cap to be named in the 15-man squad selected to tour New Zealand for a Test series. =Breakthrough= Roach made his Test debut on 9 July 2009. He was part of an understrength team fielded by the West Indies against Bangladesh; in the 15-man squad, there were nine uncapped players and in the Test seven West Indies players made their debut. The side was captained by Floyd Reifer who had played the last of his four Tests ten years earlier. The first XI had made themselves unavailable due to a pay dispute with the West Indies Cricket Board. His first Test wicket was that of all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan. Although Bangladesh won by 95 runs, Roach helped put pressure on the Bangladesh batsmen through a combination of yorkers and swinging deliveries, although he bowled slightly wide to the left-handers. Reifer praised Roach's efforts, saying \\"The first time I saw him as an under-19 bowler, I always thought he was going to play for West Indies. He does a lot, especially with the old ball, getting it to move in and out and he performed very well this morning, bowling decent lengths and lines\\". Although Bangladesh won the second Test to take the series 2‚Äì0, Roach again bowled with pace and aggression, unsettling the Bangladesh batsmen. Varying his length and exploiting the Bangladesh batsmen's weakness against short bowling ‚Äì even hitting Raqibul Hasan on the elbow with one delivery ‚Äì Roach proceeded to take career-best figures of 6/48 in the first innings. With 13 wickets to his name, Roach finished as West Indies' leading wicket-taker from the series. Although Bangladesh won the three-match ODI series that followed 3‚Äì0, Roach was leading wicket-taker for the series, with 10 wickets at an average of 16.20; in the first of the ODIs he took his maiden five-wicket haul in one day matches (5/44), beating his previous best figures of 2/29. In the second ODI, Roach was fined 10% of his match fee for bowling two beamers. The core of the same squad was retained for September's 2009 ICC Champions Trophy. Roach played in two of West Indies' three matches, as they exited the tournament in the first round, and took three wickets at 33.33. Roach during West Indies tour of Australia in February 2010 Shortly before West Indies embarked on a tour of Australia in November to December 2009; senior players such as Chris Gayle and Shivnarine Chanderpaul returned to the squad, but Roach had sufficiently impressed selectors during the dispute that he retained his place. The West Indies lost the first Test in three days; Adrian Barath's century on debut and Roach's bowling performance were the main positives for the West Indies; in the opinion of former Australia captain Ian Chappell, Roach's bowling was \\"exceptionally good\\" but he lacked support from more senior bowlers. Although the West Indies drew the second Test, Roach (who was regularly bowling over ) and Dwayne Bravo took the West Indies close to levelling the series on the final day of the match. Australia's captain, Ricky Ponting, commended Roach for his control and accuracy and said \\"Someone who is pretty short at that pace can get the ball to skid onto you pretty quickly off the wicket with not much bounce. We've played him pretty well here [in Adelaide]. The ball reverse-swung for them in both innings. He's a handful, there's no doubt about that. He's someone who could play a fair bit of Test cricket for them in the future.\\" It was the opinion of Tony Cozier that in the absence of experienced fast bowlers Jerome Taylor and Fidel Edwards, Roach was the leader of the bowling attack in Australia. Roach, who was fastest of the West Indies' bowling line-up, troubled the Australian batsmen with his pace through the series, and a rivalry emerged between Roach and Ponting. In the first innings of the third and final Test, Roach struck Ponting on the elbow, who was forced to retire hurt. However, he was forced to bowl into the wind, which surprised Australian batsmen Shane Watson as it reduced Roach's pace. Roach was one of the most sought-after players at the 2010 IPL auctions along with Kieron Pollard and Shane Bond. He was involved in a tug-of-war as both Chennai Super Kings and Deccan Chargers were fiercely bidding on him. Finally the latter managed to get him for a fee of US$720,000 as the Super Kings had another slot to fill and could not go beyond US$700,000. He played just two matches for the Chargers in the 2010 season, against Mumbai Indians and Kolkata Knight Riders The West Indies hosted the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 in April and May. West Indies exited the competition in the first round; Roach played in three of the team's matches, and was West Indies' second highest wicket-taker (5 wickets at an average of 15.40) behind Darren Sammy. After the tournament South Africa remained in the West Indies for their tour of the region in June 2010. South Africa won the three-match Test series 2‚Äì0; Roach played in two matches, taking 6 wickets at an average of 31. In the third Test, Roach was involved in an incident with Jacques Kallis; he \\"repeatedly walked up to and exchanged words with the batsman after testing him with a series of bouncers\\". As a result, Roach was fined 50% of his match fee. Roach was part of the West Indies squad which toured Sri Lanka in November and December 2010. Senior bowlers Jerome Taylor and Fidel Edwards were absent, leaving Roach as the head of the attack. In the lead up, he attempted to develop his use of swing to cope with Sri Lankan pitches traditionally unhelpful to fast bowlers. Roach remarked \\"I still have a little bit of work to do on my lengths, but I'm satisfied with what I got out of the camp\\". Roach's performance in the Tests, finishing as the West Indies lead wicket-taker with 10 wickets at an average of 24.50 for which he was named Man of the Series, was highlighted by Sammy, the team's captain, as one of the best performances of the drawn series. In February 2011 Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka hosted the 50-over World Cup. In the West Indies' second game of the tournament, Roach became the sixth bowler to have claimed a hat-trick in a World Cup. He dismissed Pieter Seelaar, Bernard Loots, and Berend Westdijk for his hat-trick and went on to claim 6/27, the fourth-best bowling figures by a West Indies player in ODIs. He was the West Indies' leading wicket-taker in the tournament with 13 wickets from 6 matches. Roach played just four Tests in 2011, and took seven wickets at a cost of over 50 runs each. Five players bowled more overs in Tests for the West Indies, and each took more wickets and had a better bowling average; four of them took more than 30 wickets. Despite not regularly featuring in the Test side, Roach finished the year as the team's leading wicket-taker in ODIs with 30 dismissals from 23 matches at an average of 31.16. Roach signed a contract in August 2011 to represent Worcestershire in English domestic cricket. At the time the club was struggling to avoid relegation from the first division of the County Championship, the first-class competition, and in the final game of the season managed to ensure they stayed up. According to Roach Worcestershire's seam bowler Alan Richardson helped him learn how to bowl in English conditions, and took 14 first-class wickets at an average of 39.28. Australia embarked on a tour of the West Indies in March 2012. In the second match of the three-Test series Roach completed his first ten-wicket haul, thereby becoming the first bowler to take ten wickets in a match for the West Indies since Corey Collymore in 2005; the last West Indian player to achieve the feat against Australia was Curtly Ambrose in 1993. Though the West Indies lost 2‚Äì0, Roach's 19 wickets for the series was the most for either side. When the West Indies toured England in May and June 2012, Roach struggled with bowling no balls. In the first Test at Lord's he bowled 18 of them, and in the next match he twice had Alastair Cook caught off a no ball. However, Jonny Bairstow struggled against Roach's bowling, in particular short-pitched bowling, and sustained several blows on the body before falling to Roach. =Later career= In October 2018, Cricket West Indies (CWI) awarded him a contract across all formats of cricket for the 2018‚Äì19 season. The following month, in the second Test against Bangladesh, Roach played in his 50th Test match. In April 2019, he was named in the West Indies' squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. In June 2020, Roach was named in the West Indies' Test squad, for their series against England. The Test series was originally scheduled to start in May 2020, but was moved back to July 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the third Test, Roach took his 200th wicket in Test cricket.

Early life The son of Mahatma Gandhi's personal secretary and biographer Mahadev Desai, he was born in Bulsar (now Valsad), Gujarat on 24 December 1924. Brought up in Gandhi's Ashram in Sabarmati, Ahmedabad and Sevagram near Wardha, Narayan stopped attending school to be educated and trained by his father and other residents of the Ashram. He specialized in basic education, spinning and weaving khadi. Initial years After his marriage to Uttara Chaudhury, daughter of freedom fighter parents, Nabakrushna Chaudhury and Malatidevi Chaudhury, the young couple moved to Vedchhi, a tribal village 60 km from Surat in Gujarat, to work as teachers in a Nai Taleem school. Following the Bhoodan movement launched by Vinoba Bhave, Narayan traversed through the length and breadth of Gujarat, by foot, collecting land from the rich and distributing the same among the poor landless villagers. He started the mouthpiece of Bhoodan movement, titled Bhoomiputra (Son of the Soil) and remained its editor till 1959. Practising Gandhian philosophy Narayan joined the Akhil Bharatiya Shanti Sena Mandal (Indian Peace Brigade), founded by Vinoba and headed by veteran socialist leader Jayaprakash Narayan (widely known as \\"JP\\"). As the general secretary of the Shanti Sena, Narayan recruited and trained peace volunteers throughout the country who intervened during ethnic conflicts and helped establish harmony among conflicting communities. Narayan was involved in the setting up of Peace Brigades International and was elected as the chairman of the War Resisters' International. He along with a Pakistani peace group were awarded the UNESCO prize for International Peace. Narayan was active in the campaign against the imposition of emergency in India and brought out a magazine defying the censorship laws. As a close associate of JP, Narayan played an important role in helping the newly formed Janata Party, a conglomeration of major non- Congress political parties in India, arrive at a consensus on the name of Morarji Desai as the Prime Minister. Following JP's death, Narayan moved to Vedchhi and set up the Sampoorna Kranti Vidyalaya (Institute for Total Revolution). The Institute imparts training in non-violence and Gandhian way of life. Narayan, as a way of paying tribute to his father, Mahadev Desai, wrote a four-volume biography of Gandhi in Gujarati, a dream his father could not fulfil in his lifetime because of his sudden death in prison on 15 August 1942. He recited 'Gandhi-Katha'(narratives on the life of Mahatma Gandhi) across the world starting 2004. The biography was written in four volumes containing 2000 pages. After completing Gandhi's biography he thought that very few people would buy this book due to its volume and high price. He thought of a novel idea for spreading Gandhi's message. He started Gandhi Katha. Like Ramayan and Bhagwat katha he started Gandhi Katha. For seven days X 3 hours he narrated the life and thought of Gandhi. He also sang songs written and composed by him during katha. His katha depended on audience. To some he would tell about Gandhi's political activities and to the executives he would tell about the leadership and management skill of Gandhi. This katha telling disperse many wrong perception about Mahatma prevailing in the minds of public. He also narrated many unpublished and unknown incidents of the life of Gandhi. This katha was very popular in India and overseas. He took this venture of Katha telling at the age of 81. He served as Chancellor of Gujarat Vidyapith since 23 July 2007, but resigned from the post in November 2014. Death He slipped into coma on 10 December 2014 but later recovered and spun charkha. He had difficulties in daily activities and was on liquid diet. He died on 15 March 2015 at Mahavir Trauma Centre, Surat. He was cremated at Sampoorna Kranti Vidyalaya (Institute for Total Revolution) at Vedchhi on the same day. Awards Narayan was accorded the Sahitya Akademi Award for Gujarati in 1993 for the biography of his father Mahadev Desai he wrote as part of the centenary celebrations of Gandhi's close aide.

The AEC was founded at St. George's Anglican Church in Ventura, California. The church described its faith as being based on the 1928 Book of Common Prayer, the King James Version of the Bible,Churches not ‚Äòin the Communion‚Äô, at anglicansonline.org, retrieved on September 14, 2006 and the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion. Now the AEC functions as a non-geographical Diocese of the United Episcopal Church of North America. History The Anglican Episcopal Church's first bishop was Reginald Hammond (1918 to 2004). Hammond was consecrated for the Anglican Episcopal Church on 20 April 2000 by Robert J. Godfrey, a former presiding bishop of the Anglican Orthodox Church. The co-consecrators were: Richard Boyce of the Anglican Province of America and Scott McLaughlin, Hesbon Njera, and Thomas Shank, all of the Orthodox Anglican Church. Following Hammond's death on 5 May 2004, the church was reduced from three parishes to the one parish in Ventura which then voted to ask for the episcopal oversight of two bishops of the Anglican Diocese of the Good Shepherd: Melvin Pickering and George Connor. In 2006, St. George's withdrew from its association with the Diocese of the Good Shepherd along with several other parishes. Delegates to an October 2006 General Convention which had been called for the purpose of re-establishing the Anglican Episcopal Church elected Conner to be its presiding bishop. David Pressey of St. George's parish was elected by the AEC Convention of 2008 to be a suffragan bishop. He was consecrated on 22 November 2008. In September 2014, St. George's withdrew from membership in the AEC and is currently an independent parish. In 2008, the Anglican Episcopal Church entered into a close working association with the Diocese of the Great Lakes. Both of these churches have since joined the United Episcopal Church of North America as dioceses of the UECNA. This Anglican Episcopal Church is not to be confused with the Anglican Episcopal Church of North America founded in 1972 by Bishop Walter Hollis Adams (1907 to 1991), with the Anglican Episcopal Church, Celtic Rite which was founded in 1993 by Bishop Robert Harold Hawn (1928 to 1999),History of St. George's Anglican Church , retrieved on September 14, 2006 with the Anglican Episcopal Church International which was founded by Bishop Norman S.

The seven member commission has been unable to meet for want of a quorum since 30 July 2019, when two commissioners resigned, stating that they could \\"no longer perform their duties independently and effectively due to restrictive regulations and a hostile and toxic environment.\\"  Inception  The commission came into being after a clash, known as \\"Black May\\", between pro- democracy demonstrators and the military in May 1992 which resulted in numerous casualties. The cabinet (42: Prem Tinsulanonda 3 March 1980 - 30 April 1983) passed a resolution in September 1992, to establish a national organization to protect human rights. The national human rights commission was eventually mandated in Article 199 and 200 of the constitution adopted in October 1997, and formally constituted in July 2001. From its inception to 31 May 2005, it received 2,148 complaints of which 1,309 had already been investigated, 559 were still in the process of investigation, and 209 were in the process of evidence gathering. The complaints covered not only civil and political rights, but also other rights including economic, social, and cultural. As for the \\"clash\\" that inspired the NHRCT, on 16 May 2002, Amnesty International issued a press release noting that ten years later, justice had still not been served. The NHRCT has been receiving an decreasing number of complaints from the public from FY2003 to FY2015, the last year reported. Organization and budget The NHRCT is composed of the commission, headed by a chairman, and six commissioners. the commission chairman is What Tingsamitr. The commission is supported by the Office of the National Human Rights Commission. Its secretary-general as of 2018 is Pirom Sriprasert. The FY2019 budget of the NHRCT is 211.3 million baht. Governmental interference The NHRCT, according to human rights watchdogs, has faced governmental interference since its inception. Commissioners Angkhana Neelaphaijit and Tuenjai Deetes announced their resignations in July 2019, stating they could no longer perform their duties independently and effectively due to restrictive regulations and a hostile and unsupportive office environment. Two other commissioners had resigned earlier. = 2006 coup = The NHRCT began to experience difficulties after the Thai military seized power in the 2006 Thailand coup. The commission remained in existence but members have not been appointed to replace those whose terms have come to an end. Saneh Chamarik, chairman of the Commission, defending the coup, stated in an interview, \\"I do not think [the coup] is about progression or regression [of democracy], but about problem solving.\\" His remark was criticized by Suwit Lertkraimethi, an organizer of the 19 September Network against Coup d'Etat, who noted, \\"His role is to protect human rights, but his statement showed his approval of human-rights violations.\\" Suwit demanded Saneh's resignation from the NHRCT. =Under the NCPO= Human Rights Watch have charged that, following the 2014 Thai coup d'√©tat, the National Council for Peace and Order, the junta's ruling body, has taken steps to weaken the NHRCT. A 2017 NHRCT Act stripped away its independence and transformed it into a de facto governmental mouthpiece. In early-2019, a sitting NHRCT commissioner who documented rights violations against opposition politicians and critics of the NCPO is under investigation and faces possible impeachment.  Accreditation  The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI), formerly the International Co- ordinating Committee of National Human Rights Institutions (ICC), and the United Nations Human Rights Council downgraded the NHRCT's global ranking from \\"A\\" to \\"B\\" in 2015. The action revoked Thailand's privilege to speak from the council floor and present its views during council sessions. The downgrade stemmed from the Thai government's manipulation of the selection process for commissioners and questions about the commission's pro-government political bias. It was determined that the composition of the NHRCT was not diverse, it lacked public input, and it failed to address human rights issues in a timely manner (the NHRCT took three years to complete and publish a report into alleged human rights violations in 2010, and in 2014 had failed to produce a report on incidents in 2013.) B status means that the NHRCT is not permitted to express its opinions or present written documents to the UN Human Rights Council, it is reduced to observer status at regional and international human rights conferences, and it is stripped of its vote at meetings of the GANHRI.  Notable decisions On 16 June 2011, the Office of the President of Khon Kaen University (KKU) accused Faculty of Law acting dean Kittibodi Yaipool and his staff of destroying official documents, and barred them from entering the grounds of the faculty. Kittibodi appealed to the NHRCT, which met in July to consider the case. On 28 February 2012, the NHRCT issued a report condemning KKU for arbitrarily and unjustly dismissing Kittibodi, urged the university to exonerate Kittibodi and his personnel, and consider reinstating them to their former positions.

The town, dock and station at Silloth were built on a greenfield site after the Carlisle & Silloth Bay Railway & Dock Act (1855) was passed. The railway provision grew with the dock and its later additions. The station was opened in 1856 and closed by the Beeching axe on 7 September 1964, when it had been estimated in 1962 that the line was losing ¬£23,500 a year and rising, staff costs had been pared to the bone and an imminent track bill of ¬£32,500 was to be faced.

A 1903 Railway Clearing House Junction Diagram showing (right) railways in the vicinity of Silloth The line was one of the first in the country to be dieselised, with one train a day remaining steam-hauled. The branch was atypical in that from the 1880s successive owners had fostered a vigorous trade in \\"Specials\\", the cornerstone of which was Carlisle to Silloth and back for a shilling. This was backed by encouraging outings to Silloth by a wide range of customers such as Sunday schools, Temperance clubs and racegoers. Many specials were both long and well-filled; the longest ever was not a trippers' train, but a celebration train for the reopening of Carr's flour mill in 1905. Freight traffic, which had done well in wartime,Silloth coal hoists, via YouTube notably because it was on the north west coast, was following the pattern of the rest of the country - in decline. Four camping coaches were positioned here by the London Midland Region from 1956 to 1964. There was insufficient shunting to justify keeping the small locoshed open after 6 July 1953 and erstwhile staple business such as flour traffic from Carr's Mill fell from ¬£7000 to ¬£100 per month, the business being lost to road competition. All tracks to and in Silloth had been removed by 1968. Redevelopment The Allerdale council in northern England passed its final approval on a plan to demolish the remaining structure of the station on 8 December 2006. The development firm James Morgan Ltd. was awarded a contract to build new single-family housing on the property. Stuart Hinchliffe, director of the development firm also stated \\"We will be reinstating as much of the old railway platform as we can, to maintain Silloth‚Äôs Victorian history.\\" See also List of closed railway stations in Britain References =Sources=          * =Further material=     * External links The station on a navigable Edwardian OS map National Library of Scotland * The station on the branch, with mileages Railway Codes * The line with period photographs Holme St Cuthbert History Group * The line and station Cumbrian Railways Association * Images of the battery and railways in Silloth BBC and others * 1929 aerial view of the station Britain from above (sign-in needed to zoom) * The station and line Rail Map Online * DMU at the station pinimg * The station in its last days Deborah Irwin * The line in early BR days Deborah Irwin * The station's and line's history Solway Past and Present * The line's opening John Ostle * Early diesels on the line David Heys Category:Disused railway stations in Cumbria Category:Former North British Railway stations Category:Beeching closures in England Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1856 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1964 Category:Silloth ","title":"Silloth railway station"},{"id":"5974059","text":"Associazione Sportiva Dilettantistica Calcio Borgomanero is an Italian association football club located in Borgomanero, Piedmont.

Club career Born in Marrakech, El Khalej started at Kawkab Marrakech in 1990, spending four seasons there, helping them win one league title and two national cups. In 1994, he moved to Portugal to sign with UD Leiria, at the time, recently promoted to the first tier. Making his debut on 22 October 1994, against Vit√≥ria de Guimar√£es, he was frequently used as midfielder alongside M√°rio Artur and Abel. After two seasons in Leiria, El Khalej joined Benfica in 1997. He made his debut on 9 September 1997 and went on to amass nearly 100 appearances, 72 in the league, without winning any silverware. With the arrival of Jupp Heynckes, El Khalej lost influence and made only 4 league appearances, two as substitute in the 1999‚Äì2000 season, so he moved to Southampton in March 2000 for ¬£350,000, as Glenn Hoddle's first signing for his new club, although the deal had already been arranged by Dave Jones. He scored on his debut in a 7‚Äì2 defeat against Tottenham Hotspur on 11 March 2000. Faced with stiff competition as a central defender from Claus Lundekvam and Dean Richards, he was later employed in a midfield role. One of his more notable moments was during a match against Newcastle on 12 May 2002, where he made a reckless lunge on Kieron Dyer , which earned him a straight red card.

The first series began in 1993 and was named in its indicia as Volume 1. It was set in the main Marvel Universe. The second series was based on the animated TV series Spider-Man Unlimited, and was not set in the Marvel Universe. It is called Volume 2. The third series, which began in 2004, did not have a volume number listed and was also set in the main Marvel Universe. 1993 series (vol. 1) Originally announced under the title Spider-Man Giant Size, the 1993 series was a quarterly series with double-length stories, which at the time was notable for being printed on glossy stock paper (a practice discontinued in later issues before being adopted by the entire Marvel line in the 2000s). Earlier issues played a part in Spider-Man crossovers; the first issue was the first part of \\"Maximum Carnage\\" and the second issue was the last part of \\"Maximum Carnage\\". Issues #7-14 formed part of the Clone Saga. Later in the series, the focus shifted to stand-alone stories. Ron Lim penciled the lead story in the first eight issues of the book. Most of the later issues were written by Christopher Golden and drawn by Joe Bennett. =Issue #1= Spider-Man Unlimited #1 was published in May 1993. The issue credits are: *Title: \\"Maximum Carnage Part 1\\" *Editor: Danny Fingeroth *Writers: Tom DeFalco, Mike W. Barr, Terry Kavanagh *Pencils: Ron Lim, Jerry Bingham, Mark Bagley *Inkers: Jim Sanders, III, Jerry Bingham, Tom Palmer =Plot= Cletus Kasady has been transferred from the Vault to Ravencroft Institute for some tests. He there reveals that the alien symbiote which made him the supervillain Carnage infected his bloodstream before it died, allowing Kasady's metabolism to produce an imitation of the symbiote. Using this faux symbiote, he slaughters the guards and doctors. Carnage comes across a fellow Ravencroft inmate, Shriek. She persuades him to free her so she can join his killing spree. Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson are at the wake after Harry Osborn's funeral. J. Jonah Jameson thinks Spider-Man was responsible for Harry's downfall (as the Green Goblin). Peter is incredibly mixed up as he comforts Harry's wife Liz Allan. Mary Jane is upset from the whole Harry fallout and asks Peter to give up being Spider-Man, for a couple of weeks at least, so things can settle down. He agrees. Out on the streets, Carnage is attacked by Spider-Man's doppelganger. Carnage ensnares and attempts to kill it, but Shriek stops him with a sonic blast and says she is adopting the doppelganger. Peter goes for a takeout and hears on the radio about Carnage's escape. He changes to Spider-Man and goes swinging off to find Carnage. He is attacked by Shriek and the doppelganger instead, who quickly defeat him. Spider-Man topples off a building into a back alley as the doppelganger and Shriek swing off. Because Carnage used him as a hostage before, Jonah is immediately informed by the authorities of his escape. Jonah enters his Bugle office with plans to flee New York, only to find himself in a meeting with Carnage, who neglected to make an appointment. 1999 series (vol. 2) =Spider-Man Unlimited Wizard Edition= Spider-Man Unlimited Wizard Edition is a Marvel comic book series that was printed in 1999, and told the story of Spider-Man's new adventures in the Spider-Man Unlimited television series. In this storyline, Spider-Man sports a new costume - one similar to that worn by Ben Reilly and May \\"Mayday\\" Parker - made using Nanotechnology \\"discretely borrowed\\" from Reed Richards. In this series, Spider-Man also confronts a species known as the Bestials: monsters created by the High Evolutionary which rule a planet called Counter-Earth and outnumber the planet's human population. =Issues 1/2, 1 and 2= Peter Parker meets with J. Jonah Jameson to take picture of his son, astronaut John Jameson, before a space mission to a hidden planet on the other side of our sun called Counter-Earth, but it is quickly revealed that Venom and Carnage have joined forces in a plot against the space mission. Following the two to the launch site, Spider-Man attempts to thwart their plot, but fails. Blamed for Jameson losing contact with our Earth after the battle with the two Symbiotes, Spider-Man becomes a target of persecution by the media and the public. This causes Peter to temporarily retire from his life as Spider-Man. After a brief hiatus, Peter Parker decides to board a new spaceship on a flight to Counter-Earth to save John Jameson. The first three issues, the first of which is a half-issue, are based on the first three episodes of the television series. =Issue 3= In issue #3, Peter is assigned by the Daily Byte to follow the Counter-Earth version of Reed Richards. It is suspected that Reed has knowledge of a mysterious creature called the Brute. The only thing Peter finds out is that Richards is a really uptight individual. Together, they go to a party which requires everyone to have ID chips. Before Peter is discovered not to have one, the Brute shows up to crash the party. After a fight between Spider-Man and the Brute, it is revealed to him that the creature is none other than Reed Richards. The Brute is helping the rebels against the Beastials; as Reed, he is a spy. He is also aided in his mission by his friend Ben Grimm. Reed reveals that, after a tested flight similar to the one which created the Fantastic Four, the Counter-Earth Reed was transformed by cosmic rays into the Brute, while Ben Grimm was unaffected, Johnny Storm was killed and Susan Richards was left in a coma. =Issue 4= Peter decides to take a look at life outside the city after Naoko is hesitant to tell him what lies beyond Manhattan; as Spider-Man, he asks the Green Goblin for help in leaving the island, which the Goblin only grants after Spider-Man tells him that he does not have the sub-dermal ID chip with which the High Evolutionary tracks human residents. As soon as he reaches the other side of an exit tunnel, he is dragged into the water by a tentacled creature; when he reawakens, he finds himself in a tree house in a hidden forest refuge known as \\"Harmony\\", where humans and Beastials live together. However, his stay is short-lived when he raises the ire of one of the human leaders of the area, a man named Brixton, and he barely escapes from what suddenly turns out to be a police state when he stumbles on a human Gwen Stacy double; she assists him by secretly housing him and then guiding him to the tunnel back to Manhattan.Review of Spider-Man Unlimited (Vol. 2) #4 =Issue 5= Peter Parker and his house rental Dr. Naoko Jones finally succeed in putting her son Shayne to sleep after he was hiding from the mysterious serial killer that was lurking on the streets. This mysterious serial killer was attacking people and viciously removing their sub-dermal ID chips. Later in the comics, we see Peter writing in his journal back in his room, until he noticed a picture of Naoko, Shayne and Naoko's husband, who is a decorated soldier. Suddenly, Peter's spider sense alerts him to danger outside the house, where he encounters another of the killer's victims, who looks like a Wolverine Beastial. After an enormous fight, the Wolverine Beastial and Spider-Man stopped fighting, after which they started to talk things out, until they noticed a robber kidnapping Dr. Naoko Jones. They followed the quick-moving robber with the Wolverine Beastial's sense of smell and easily found him. They teamed up and started to fight the robber, who then transforms into a lizard-like Beastial and calls himself \\"the Chameleon from Counter-Earth\\". After beating the Chameleon, the Wolverine Beastial said that this neighborhood is not his home any more and gave Spider- Man a medal that looks just like the one that Naoko's husband wore in the picture, which confirmed that the Wolverine Beastial is Shayne's father and Naoko's missing husband. 2004 Series (vol. 3) The third series, launched concurrently with X-Men Unlimited (vol. 2), was a bimonthly anthology featuring two stories per issue, usually by writers without a significant body of previously-published comics work.

Structure and organisation According to Poland's Central Statistical Office, the Polish Reformed Church has 3,461 members (2015). The majority of church members live in central Poland; in 2014 out of a total number of 3464 adherents, 1800 lived in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Voivodeship and 1000 in the city of Warsaw. There are eight congregations in Poland: * Warsaw * ≈Å√≥d≈∫ * Zel√≥w * Be≈Çchat√≥w * Kleszcz√≥w * ≈ªychlin * Strzelin * PstrƒÖ≈ºna (part of the town of Kudowa Zdr√≥j) Furthermore, emerging congregations exist in some other cities, including Pozna≈Ñ, Wroc≈Çaw, and Gda≈Ñsk. In 2003 the Church ordained its first woman minister and two more female students are in training. The Polish Reformed Church is a minority church in Poland, where roughly 90% of the people are Roman Catholics. History =16th-18th centuries= The Polish Reformed movement goes back to the half of the 16th century when the teachings of Swiss Reformers like Zwingli and Calvin began to make their way to Poland. Earlier, Lutheranism had made way to Poland, especially in the cities. A great boost to the Reformation movement happened when in 1525 the devotedly Roman Catholic king Sigismund I the Old (1506‚Äì48) accepted as his vassal in Prussia, the Lutheran prince Albert I, Duke of Prussia, thus creating the first Protestant country in the World. Though the king opposed \\"new thought\\", humanists all across Poland and Lithuania began studying Reformed theology. The most celebrated and influential group was found in the country's capital Krak√≥w, where they flocked around the book printer and vendor Jan Trzecielski grouping nobles, burghers, professors, priests. The first Reformed church service was held in 1550 in Pi≈Ñcz√≥w, a little town nearby Krak√≥w, where the local noble owner converted to the Reformed Faith, expelled the monks, ‚Äôpurging‚Äô the city church. Other nobles soon followed suit and the first Reformed synod in Lesser Poland was held in 1564 in S≈Çomniki, close to Krak√≥w. Thus the Lesser Poland Brethren (Jednota Ma≈Çopolska) was formed. In the meantime in the North of Poland another Reformed church was formed. The Czech Brethren, persecuted by the Czech king Ferdinand I Habsburg fled to Greater Poland (1548), where they settled in the estates of the local aristocrats whom they very quickly converted to their faith. The number of their congregations quickly swelled from 20 in 1555 to 64 in 1570. Their main centre was the city of Leszno, where they were settled under the patronage of the devotedly Reformed Leszczy≈Ñski family. Thus the Greater Poland Brethren (Jednota Wielkopolska) also called the Czech Brethren, was formed. The Greater Poland and the Lesser Poland Brethren did try to cooperate more closely and even signed in 1555 a Union agreement but the Lesser Poland's Reformed nobles who formed the bulwark of the church members found the Czechs to be too hierarchical and undemocratic, and in the end the Lesser Poland Brethren became a strongly synodal structure, while the Greater Poland church became more Presbyterian. Mikolaj \\"the Black\\" Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç The Reformation in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (today's Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine) date to 1552 when the local aristocrat Miko≈Çaj \\"the Black\\" Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç received a Reformed preacher, although some of Reformation ideas were known in Sigismund II Augustus palace because of returned educated Lithuanian Abraomas Kulvietis, who had founded school and taught children in Lutheran manner. He was generally unpopular among the Catholic hierarchy because of his Lutheran beliefs, and when the queen was away in 1542 Abraomas was forced to leave the country. Soon he (Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç \\"The Black\\") was followed by his cousin Miko≈Çaj \\"the Red\\" Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç and other aristocrats. The first synod was held in 1557, and two years later the Lithuanians signed a Union agreement with the Lesser Poland Brethren. A huge number of converts were attracted from Orthodox nobility. While the nobles used Polish in church services, an effort was made to convert the Lithuanian-speaking peasants and serfs, but since Lithuanian did not have a written form till the second half of the 19th century, Polish stayed as the official church language. Thus the Lithuanian Brethren (Jednota Litewska) came into being. In 1556 John a Lasco (Jan ≈Åaski) returned from Western Europe to help with the organisation of the Polish Reformed church. Seeing that the new king Sigismund II Augustus was sympathetic to the Reformed cause, he tried to write a Confession that would be agreeable not only to all the three Reformed churches but to the Lutherans as well. Unfortunately, exhausted from overwork, he died in 1560, having achieved only the consolidation of the Lesser Reformed Brethren, which shortly afterwards was weakened by the split of the Unitarians (1563). In the same year, the Second Helvetic Confession was translated to Polish and was adopted by the Lithuanian and Lesser Poland Brethren. In a posthumous tribute to John a Lasco, the Czech Brethren, the two Reformed and the Lutheran churches in Poland agreed in 1570 to the Confession of Sandomir (Konfesja Sandomierska), which was an irenic translation of the Second Helvetic Confession and in theory formed one, united, Protestant church. The strength of the Polish Protestants was shown when in 1573 a law was passed foreboding any persecution based on religion, an act unprecedented in Europe of that time. The Protestants formed also over 65% members of the Lower and just about a half of the Upper Houses of Parliament. The Reformed opened excellent schools in Pi≈Ñcz√≥w, Leszno, Krak√≥w, Vilnius, Kƒódainiai and S≈Çuck, printed the first complete Bible in Polish, commissioned by Miko≈Çaj \\"the Black\\" Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç in 1563 in Brest-Litovsk. Though grouping mainly nobles and aristocrats, it managed to have some following among the peasantry as well. In some regions the number of Reformed parishes completely outnumbered the Roman Catholic ones, though in proportion the movement probably never exceeded 20% of the total population and 45% of nobility. At the same time the movement was rising in strength, there were signs of Catholic revival. Jesuits were invited to Poland by the clergy in 1565, and these friars soon advocated more stringent methods of combating ‚Äòheresy‚Äô. Religious riots followed, which managed to expel Protestants from the main cities of Poland (Krak√≥w, Pozna≈Ñ, Lublin) with the important exception of Wilno. The Unitarian split seriously weakened the church, and in 1595 the Reformed‚ÄìLutheran Union fell apart. The new staunchly Catholic king, Sigismund III Vasa, refused to promote any Protestants and from the beginning of the 17th century the church found itself in a serious defensive, with all three Brethren losing churches and followers. The brief respite they got during the reign of king Wladyslaw IV Vasa (1632‚Äì48) was followed by civil wars, wars with Sweden, Russia and Turkey which ravaged the country for latter half of the century. By then, only a handful of faithful remained in all three Brethren, with the Lithuanian one now leading the other three. Nearly all the aristocrats converted to Catholicism, and the last Protestant in the Senate (a Lutheran) died in 1668. The rise of intolerance began in 1658, when Unitarians were expelled from the country, and 1668 conversion from Catholicism was punishable by death. Finally, in 1717 the Protestant nobility were stripped of all their political rights, which were only reinstated to them in 1768. Though a small number of Huguenots settled in Poland at the end of the 17th century (Gda≈Ñsk, Warsaw), the numbers dwindled. By 1768, the number of Reformed churches has dwindled to 40 from 500 by 1591. In 1768 under pressure from Orthodox Russia and Protestant Prussia the Polish Diet reluctantly reinstated political rights to the Polish nobility, as well as granting nearly full freedom of worship and religion ‚Äî only the prohibition of abjuring from Catholicism was maintained. Under the enlightened king Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski (1764‚Äì95), the Reformed quickly began to rebuild themselves from ruins. New churches in Pozna≈Ñ, Piaski etc. were constructed. In the capital Warsaw, a new congregation organised itself and erected a new church (1776). This congregation had a multicultural outlook, as apart from Polish nobles it consisted of merchants of Scottish, English, Swiss, Huguenot, Dutch and German origin. Services were held in Polish, German and French. Church organisation also consolidated and in 1777, in the Lesser Poland's congregation of Sielec, a union was signed between the Polish Reformed and Lutherans, and the Union of Sandomir was once again reaffirmed. A common consistory was established with six members, in equal number from the Reformed and Lutherans, two being clergy, two being burghers and two being nobles. Though this union was short-lived (dissolved in 1782), the Protestants in Poland continued to grow and expand, especially in Warsaw, whose congregation soon overshadowed any other church centre. This optimistic period was cut short by the Three Partitions of Poland by Prussia, Russia and Austria (1772, 1793, 1795) which led to the disappearance of Poland for over a century from the map of Europe. =The Polish Reformed without Poland (1795‚Äì1918)= The beginnings were not easy. The Greater Poland Brethren was incorporated in 1817 to the Prussian Evangelical Union Church as a separate district (Kirchenprovinz Posen, i.e. ecclesiastical province of Posen) but without any autonomy. Between 1829 and 1853 Bishop Carl Andreas Wilhelm Freymark (1785‚Äì1855) led the Posen ecclesiastical province as general superintendent.\\"Freymark, Karl\\", on: Baza os√≥b polskich - polnische Personendatenbank, retrieved on 6 May 2012. Under constant pressure from the Prussian government by the mid 19th century the United Church abandoned Polish in its liturgy and most of old Reformed nobles chose to convert to Roman Catholicism rather than to become Germans. In Austria too, the parishes were incorporated to the Evangelical Church of Augsburg and Helvetian Confession in Austria, but forming a seniorate of its own separate from those for the Lutherans. During the 19th century the number of Polish Reformed parishes shrank from 4 to just one in Krak√≥w. There the Reformed shared the parish with Lutherans, and these became so dominant that from 1828 only Lutheran pastors were called to the pulpit, though a handful of Reformed survived. Polish Reformed Christianity was maintained in land taken by Russia. The Warsaw congregation led by outstanding members dominated the rump Lesser Poland Brethren and became a leader of the denomination. The Lithuanian Brethren maintained its synodal structure and Polish outlook, and in the beginning of the 19th century erected a monumental church in Vilnius. The number of Reformed were growing too: in 1803 a colony of Czech settlers founded a town and congregation of Zel√≥w. Under the energetic Superintendent Karol Diehl (who died in 1831) in 1829 another administrative union was signed with Lutherans. The predominance of the more numerous Lutherans in the new Consistory of the Reformed, as well as the unsuccessful November Uprising in 1830 led the Tsar Nicolas I of Russia to dissolve the Union in 1849. Under the new decree separate Lutheran and Reformed churches were formed. The Lesser Poland Brethren was dissolved its six parishes merged into one (in Sielec) and now put under the charge of the Consistory in Warsaw. This new church was called (unofficially) the Warsaw Brethren. The Lithuanian Brethren was spared dissolution, though its schools were taken away by the Russian state. The rest of the 19th century saw a slow growth of the Reformed movement in Poland, though proportionally to the rest of the Polish population their percentage declined. New congregations were established in Lublin (1852), Seirijai (1852), Suwa≈Çki (1852). The Czechs from Zel√≥w migrated to other parts of Poland and there they formed new congregations: in Kuc√≥w (1852), ≈ªyrard√≥w (1852) and ≈Å√≥d≈∫ (1904). Despite severe Russian repression after the January Uprising (1863) in which many Reformed nobles were implicated and active, the church remained Polish and slowly absorbed and Polonised new immigrant groups that settled in the country. The growth of the church would have been more impressive, had it not suffered from an acute shortage of ministers: for example in the 1880 there were just 5 pastors serving 10 congregations. Things were not going so well for the Lithuanian Brethren. Its estates were confiscated in 1841 and after 1866 the church was forced to conduct its administrative business and synods in Russian. The number of congregations went down to 12, though 2 new were founded in the course of the 19th century by Czech settlers from Zel√≥w. The church managed to avoid any nationalistic conflict between its Lithuanian peasant members and the still predominant Polish nobles. At the beginning of the 20th century a number of Polish Reformed from ≈ªyrard√≥w, Kuc√≥w, and Zel√≥w emigrated to the United States, where in 1915 a Polish Presbyterian parish was formed in Baltimore, Maryland; this parish existed until 1941. =Independent Poland (1918‚Äì39)= Immediately after Poland regained its independence both the Warsaw and Lithuanian Brethren expressed joy at the occasion and a desire to unite in once church. In 1918, the Warsaw Brethren allowed women full voting rights in church assemblies, congregations and synods. Until the 1930s both churches grew rapidly. The Warsaw Brethren organised new congregations in Toru≈Ñ, Pozna≈Ñ, Lw√≥w (today Lviv in Ukraine) and Krak√≥w. Due to missionary activity a few thousands of Ukrainians were converted to Reformed Christianity from Eastern Orthodoxy and organised into a semi-independent synod within the Warsaw Brethren. In 1926 the church started to publish a two-weekly church newspaper \\"Jednota\\" (Brethren) which still exists today. The Lithuanian Brethren suffered huge loses, when the Lithuanian parishes formed themselves into a separate church in independent Lithuania, as well as they lost to Soviet Russia the old church centres such as S≈Çuck, Kojdan√≥w, Mi≈Ñsk etc. The Brethren, now left with only 4 congregations (Wilno, Izabellin, Niepokojczyce, Michaj≈Ç√≥wka) rebuilt itself by incorporating Polish Anglicans (mainly converts from Judaism) into a separate synod, as well as by mission to Ukrainians and Belarusians. Despite repeated attempt to unite themselves, the two churches remained separate, and in the 1930s even hostile, after the Wilno Consistory engaged itself into a lucrative yet dubious business of granting easy divorces. Union talks were resumed in 1939 but were interrupted by the outbreak of World War II. By 1939 the Warsaw Brethren had over 20,000 members, and the Lithuanian Brethren ca. 5,000 members. Apart from these two churches, the United Evangelical Church in Poland (Ko≈õci√≥≈Ç Ewangelicko-Unijny w Polsce), which had assumed independence from the Church of the old-Prussian Union, had ca. 3,000 Reformed, and the Evangelical Church of Augsburg and Helvetian Confession in Lesser Poland (Ko≈õcio≈Ç Ewangelicki Augsburskiego i Helweckiego Wyznania w Ma≈Çopolsce), having emerged from the Polish part of the old united Austrian Church, had ca. 2,000,The Lesser Polish Reformed Protestants were organised in four congregations. Cf. Ma≈Çgorzata Ko≈õka: \\"Akta Gmin Ko≈õcio≈Ça Ewangelickiego Augsburskiego i Helweckiego Wyznania 1786 ‚Äî 1939\\" , Archiwum G≈Ç√≥wne Akt Dawnych w Warszawie (AGAD; Central Archives of Historical Records in Warsaw) ; retrieved on 6 May 2012. thus bringing the total number of Reformed in Poland to ca. 30,000 members. These included Poles of Polish, Czech, Lithuanian, German, Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Jewish backgrounds. =World War II persecution (1939‚Äì45)= On September 1, 1939 Nazi Germany invaded Poland and on September 17 so did the Soviet Union. After a desperate fight, Poland was annexed by Russia and Germany and the Government went into exile by the end of the month. Both the Nazis and Soviets instigated a true reign of terror in the conquered territory. These measures affected also the Reformed. In the Nazi sector the entire Anglican Synod of the Wilno Brethren (ca. 1000 members) was wiped out. In ≈Å√≥d≈∫, the pastor was first forbidden to preach in Polish. When he started to do so in Czech, was arrested by the Gestapo after the Christmas Eve service in 1940, deported to Dachau where he was murdered. The congregation was suppressed and services ceased. The same happened to congregations in Toru≈Ñ, Pozna≈Ñ and Lublin. The Warsaw parish survived under the courageous leadership of the General Superintendent Stefan Skierski (died 1948), but, following the Warsaw Rising (1944), it was dispersed. Deportations, executions and forced labour decimated the church. Under the \\"progressive\\" Soviets things were not better: the Ukrainian Protestants were deported and nearly completely wiped out. The Wilno congregation was first subjected to the Lithuanian synod, and then Polish services were ordered to cease. The nobility and intelligentsia were hunted down and either executed or deported to Siberia. By 1945 the Wilno Brethren ceased to exist. =Under Communism (1945‚Äì89)= It took the Polish Reformed two years before they met in a Synod (1947). The old Rev. Skierski was chosen again as superintendent but he died exhausted and broken by the atrocities of the war. The situation of the church was dramatic: only three ministers were in Poland; the churches in Lithuania and Belarus were lost to Soviets; the church in Sielec, and Tabor were seized as \\"German\\" by the Catholic population; Warsaw was completely destroyed by the Germans, although the church managed to survive. The number of members was estimated to be at 5000, or nearly 1/6 the 1939 number. Still, it was dropping even more, as the German and Czech Reformed were emigrating from Poland. Old Reformed churches in West Poland were taken over by the Catholics who refused to give them back; the lack of pastors was acute till the end of the 1950s. Some Polish Reformed stayed in the West rather than come back to a Communist regime and formed the London Reformed Polish Church, that existed till 1991.

The 2011 census recorded a population of 3,876 in the village. River is 1 mile south west of the A2 and 2 miles north of the A20, and a railway station at Kearsney provides direct access to London. History There are two churches in the village, the 11th-century Anglican parish church of St Peter & St Paul, and a Methodist church with a history dating back to 1834. The oldest residential sections of River date from the 1800s or earlier. Later development possibly dates to the 1930s, as well as recent developments from the 1960s and 1970s. Geography River is situated in a steep wooded valley formed by the River Dour. At its north-west end the valley splits into the Dour Valley, in which Temple Ewell lies, and the Alkham Valley, which for much of the time is dry but which contains the Drellingore, a highly seasonal stream characteristic of chalk downland (another example being the nearby Nailbourne). The confluence of the Dour and Drellingore rivers is situated in Kearsney Abbey. At the valley floor, River is on average about above sea level. Along the axis of the Dour, the land slopes gradually down towards the sea about distant. The common land areas above Kearsney Abbey provide a view of Dover and its castle, and much of the area consists of delicate chalk grassland. Governance River comes under the jurisdiction of Dover District Council and is in the Dover and Deal parliamentary constituency. River has had its own Parish Council since 1987. An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward includes Hougham Without and has a total population at the 2011 census of 4,564. Economy River once had a number of shops, but most have gradually closed; a small Co- op supermarket, as well as two other grocery stores exist in the town today. River retains its post office. The village has a park, Kearsney Abbey, and two other parks nearby. Recreation and culture Crabble Corn Mill There are two significant green areas, the River Recreation Ground and Kearsney Abbey. Despite its name, Kearsney Abbey was never a monastic estate but was the name given to a manor house, built by the Fector family in the early 19th century. The house fell into disrepair after World War II and was demolished around 1960. All that remains of the building today is the billiard room. The nearby stadium of Crabble Athletic Ground is home to Dover Athletic F.C., and is situated at the Dover end of Lewisham Road. The park of Russell Gardens is situated on the Alkham Valley Road beyond Kearsney Abbey. The village has a primary school of about 400 pupils. Mills River owes its early existence to milling. The River Dour, which runs through the village and along which Lower Road is built, once supported several water-powered flour and paper mills. One of them, formerly known as Mannering's Mill but now known as Crabble Corn Mill (built in 1812), survives in working form. It now promotes itself as a visitor attraction and restaurant. The site of the other major mill in River is disused, situated at the downstream end of Kearsney Abbey. It forms a habitat for water birds such as grey wagtails and kingfishers. Other mills existed further downstream, but all have been either demolished or converted for other industry or housing.

Giaveno spent a long time in the regional Piedmont leagues, and wouldn't gain promotion from the Terza Categoria until the 1980s. When the team finally promoted, they succeeded in a double promotion, gaining promotion to the Prima Categoria. In 1986 the football club merged with U.S. Coazze, giving the club a new name; A.C. Giaveno Coazze. The small club succeeded to conquer the championship of Prima Categoria at the first attempt, they went on to win the Promozione in order to pass into the hunt for the Eccellenza championship. Giaveno achieved Eccellenza victory the following season. Giaveno first competed in Serie D during the 1989‚Äì90 season, and the successive season finished at sixth place in the championship. The following season the club were not as fortunate and were relegated; they only gained promotion back to Serie D during the 2002‚Äì03 season when they also changed denomination to F.C. Giaveno. In 2007, after a sponsorship deal with Lotto Sport Italia, the club changed denomination to F.C.D. Lottogiaveno.

Formed in 1865 and based at Top Field, Hitchin took part in the inaugural FA Cup competition in 1871‚Äì72. Turning professional early in the twentieth century, financial worries were compounded by a fire at Top Field in 1911. The club folded soon after. History Hitchin Football Club was formed in 1865, and arrived at Top Field soon after ‚Äî the exact date of the move is not certain, but it is known that in \\"torrential rain\\", Hitchin held Crystal Palace to a 0‚Äì0 draw on the first day of the inaugural FA Cup competition on 11 November 1871. Both clubs were allowed through, and Hitchin lost 5‚Äì0 to the Royal Engineers in the next round. Hitchin's ground at Top Field acquired a proud grandstand during the late 19th century, although the players were still obliged to change at The Cricketers public house across the street. The side turned professional around the turn of the century, but this was an economic folly. To make matters worse, the great grandstand burnt down in 1911. Debt-ridden, with no grandstand and little success, the club limped along until finally folding during the First World War. This Club is not to be confused with Hitchin Blue Cross who also played in the Town at this time (frequently against Hitchin). They were founded as Hitchin Blue Cross Brigade in the late 1890s and were founder members of the Herts County League in 1898‚Äì99. They changed their name to Hitchin Blue Cross in 1902 and played in the Herts County League until 1924. They were twice runners-up in the Herts Senior Cup in 1906‚Äì07 and 1920‚Äì21 and won it in 1922‚Äì23.

He played for the Moroccan national team and was a squad member at the 1994 FIFA World Cup. Career Although born in Morocco, Kachloul was raised in Belleville in France and spent his early career in French football, with N√Æmes Olympique, before signing for FC Metz, who loaned him to USL Dunkerque and AS Saint-√âtienne respectively. After being released by his parent club FC Metz at his own request, he spent a spell searching for a new club before moving to England, joining top flight Southampton in October 1998. He remained at The Dell until June 2001 when he joined Aston Villa after his contract expired. He had originally made a verbal agreement to join Ipswich Town,Kachloul opts for Ipswich and was celebrated as a crucial signing, but changed his mind at the last minute to head to Villa Park. Kachloul was signed by John Gregory and played almost all his games for the club under him. After Gregory resigned in January 2002, he was frozen out by, firstly, Graham Taylor, and later David O'Leary. The midfielder left Aston Villa in July 2004, after failing to appear for the club in the 2003‚Äì04 season. He had spent five months on loan at fellow Premier League side Wolves during the campaign, but had only managed four games, after suffering injury and illness. After a spell as a free agent, he joined Livingston, where he helped the club avoid relegation. His time at Livingston was somewhat overshadowed due to the suspicious circumstances of his transfer. As he had joined as a free agent, and was signed outside the transfer window, he played under 'amateur' status. However, this was found to be unsound as he was discovered to be receiving an income from Livingston. The SPL ruled that as the player could have been signed as a professional and there had been no need to sign him as an amateur on 31 March 2005. Livingston argued that they had gained no competitive advantage from this situation, and therefore a points deduction was not imposed. The club was fined ¬£15,000. After leaving Livingston, he had a trial at Derby County in late 2005, but was not signed and has since retired. He currently works as a property developer.

The Third Symphony is considered a transitional work in Rachmaninoff's output. In melodic outline and rhythm it is his most expressively Russian symphony, particularly in the dance rhythms of the finale.Norris, Rachmaninoff, 102. What was groundbreaking in this symphony was its greater economy of utterance compared to its two predecessors. This sparer style, first apparent in the Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, enhances the emotional power of the work.Matthew-Walker, 119. The symphony was premiered on November 6, 1936, with Leopold Stokowski conducting the Philadelphia Orchestra. Critical opinion was divided and public opinion negative toward the work. Rachmaninoff remained convinced of the piece's worth, however, and conducted the Philadelphia Orchestra in the first recording of the work in 1939. Following the reevaluation of Rachmaninoff's work in the 1970s, the symphony has been viewed in a more favorable light and has been frequently played and recorded. Form The symphony contains only three movements but its central one fulfills the dual role of slow movement and scherzo ‚Äî a structural innovation with marked similarities to the third symphony of Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k. The work employs cyclic form, with the subtle use of a motto theme combined, as usual with Rachmaninoff's works, with references to the plain-chant Dies irae.Matthew Walker, 118. Also like Rachmaninoff's motto themes ‚Äî and thus differing from Tchaikovsky's ‚Äî it is short and, by tending to assume various shapes, is easily workable for further symphonic development.Harrison, 309. The piece is approximately 40 minutes long. Composition Rachmaninoff composed his Third Symphony after writing his Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini and Variations on a Theme of Corelli. He arrived at his newly built Villa Senar on Lake Lucerne in Switzerland in late April 1935 with the prospect of writing a symphony in mind. Satisfied with his new home and in good spirits, Rachmaninoff seemed definitely up to the task. On May 15 he informed his cousin Sofiya Satina that he had done \\"some work,\\" and during the following weeks was seriously at work with the composition. However, a three-week cure at Baden-Baden in July, along with a two-week hiatus in August, put Rachmaninoff behind. Five days before leaving Senar at the end of his summer holiday, Rachmaninov wrote to Satina with some dissatisfaction, \\"I have finished two-thirds in clean form but the last third of the work in rough. If you take into account that the first two-thirds took seventy days of intense work, for the last third ‚Äì thirty-five days ‚Äì there is not enough time. Travels begin and I must get down to playing the piano. So it looks as though my work will be put aside until next year.\\"Bertensson and Leyda, 313‚Äì14. Near the end of the 1935‚Äì36 concert season, recitals in Switzerland enabled Rachmaninoff to pay a brief visit to Senar. He evidently took the score of the symphony with him when he left, since he had it with him in Paris in February 1936 for Julius Conus to mark bowings in the string parts. Work on the last movement had to wait until the composer arrived at Senar on April 16 for the summer holiday. On June 30, the composer reported to Satina, \\"Yesterday morning I finished my work, of which you are the first to be informed. It is a symphony. Its first performance is promised to Stokowski‚Äîprobably in November. With all my thoughts I thank God that I was able to do it!\\"Bertensson and Leyda, 320. Rachmaninoff arrived in America just in time for final rehearsals of the work's premiere. Instrumentation The symphony is scored for full orchestra with 3 flutes (the 3rd doubling on piccolo), 3 oboes (the 3rd doubling on cor anglais), 2 clarinets in A and B, bass clarinet in A and B, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns, 2 trumpets in A and B, 1 contralto trumpet in F, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, cymbals, bass drum, snare drum, triangle, tambourine, tam-tam, xylophone, 2 harps, celesta, and strings. Reactions =Critical= The day after the Third Symphony premiered, Edwin Schloss wrote for The Philadelphia Record that he found the work \\"a disappointment,\\" with \\"echoes ... of the composer's lyric spaciousness of style\\" but largely sterile.Bertensson and Leyda, 323. Even Olin Downes, normally a champion of the composer's works, was not so sure about this piece: > The outward characteristics of Rachmaninoff's style are evident in the work > heard on this occasion. It cannot be said, however, that in these pages Mr. > Rachmaninoff says things which are new, even though his idiom is more his > own than ever before, and free of the indebtedness it once had to > Tchaikovsky. Nor is it easy to avoid the impression, at a first hearing of > the work, of a certain diffuseness. There is a tendency to over-elaboration > of detail, and to unnecessary extensions, so that the last movement, in > particular, appears too long. Would not a pair of shears benefit the > proportions of this work?Bertensson and Leyda, 324‚Äì5. Samuel L. Laciar, reviewing the work for the Public Ledger, gave a more positive assessment. He called the symphony \\"a most excellent work in musical conception, composition and orchestration,\\" adding that Rachmaninoff \\"has given us another example in this work that it is not necessary to write dissonant music in order to get the originality which is the greatest‚Äîand usually the single‚Äîdemand of the ultra-moderns.\\"Bertensson and Leyda, 324. W. J. Henderson of the Sun was perhaps most accurate in summing up both the work and the situation the critics faced in assessing it: > It is the creation of a genial mind laboring in a field well known and loved > by it, but not seeking now to raise the fruit of heroic proportions.... The > first movement is orthodox in its initial statement of two contrasting chief > subjects. They are contrasted in the customary way, in temper and tonality. > But the working out section pays only polite respect to tradition. The > development of themes immediately follows their statement and this is > Rachmaninoff's method. The cantabile theme of the first movement is > especially attractive in its lyric and plaintive character and the leading > subject has virility and possibilities which are not neglected later. In > fact, we suspect, after this insufficient first hearing, that there is more > organic unity in this symphony through consanguinity of themes than is > instantly discernable. =Public= The public was as confused as the critics. Listeners who enjoyed the Second and Third Concertos, the Second Symphony, Isle of the Dead and, more recently, the Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, came expecting a quite different work than the one they heard. As Barrie Martyn phrases it, \\"The public had doubtless been misled by the old-style romanticism of the eighteenth Paganini variation and were perplexed to find that Rachmaninoff had after all advanced beyond the 1900s; the critics, on the other hand, condemned him just because they felt that he had not.\\"Martyn, 343 =Composer= Rachmaninoff believed the Third Symphony was one of his best works, and its lukewarm reception disappointed and puzzled him. He summed up the situation in a 1937 letter to Vladimir Wilshaw: \\"It was played in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, etc. At the first two performances I was present. It was played wonderfully. Its reception by both the public and critics was sour. One review sticks painfully in my mind: that I didn't have a Third Symphony in me any more. Personally, I am firmly convinced that this is a good work. But‚Äî‚Äîsometimes composers are mistaken too! Be that as it may, I am holding to my opinion so far.\\" Notable recordings # Sergei Rachmaninoff conducting the Philadelphia Orchestra, recorded in 1939. # Eugene Ormandy conducting the Philadelphia Orchestra, recorded in 1967. # Leopold Stokowski conducting the National Philharmonic Orchestra, recorded in 1975. # Andr√© Previn conducting the London Symphony Orchestra, recorded in 1976. # Vladimir Ashkenazy conducting the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, recorded November 1980. # Mariss Jansons conducting the St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra, recorded 1992. # David Zinman conducting the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, recorded May 1994. # Mikhail Pletnev conducting the Russian National Orchestra, recorded June 1997. # Vasily Petrenko conducting the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, recorded July 2010.

It is about northwest of Catanzaro, the provincial capital. It is surrounded by the villages of Decollatura, Gimigliano, Miglierina, Serrastretta and Tiriolo. The largest nearby town is Nicastro, which has since become part of the larger comune of Lamezia Terme. History The town was founded by peasants who fled from Motta Santa LuciaMotta Santa Lucia - The town of Motta Santa Lucia - Calabria in details after the earthquake of 1638. Moving to the interior, they asked asylum from Prince Cigala of Tiriolo, who allowed them to settle in the area which is today known as \\"Colla Pagliara\\", in exchange for the payment of a modest head tax. They subsequently moved to a lower area which was more sheltered from the wind. The village took name from a small statue of the apostle St. Peter erected in the area. San Pietro Apostolo was administered by its neighbor Tiriolo until the end of the 18th century when it obtained its autonomy under law No. 14 of 19 January 1807. It was elevated to the status of a comune with the name of 'San Pietro a Tiriolo' and placed under the jurisdiction of what was then called Calabria Ulteriore, which consisted of the current provinces of Catanzaro, Crotone, Reggio Calabria and Vibo Valentia. On 4 May 1811 the comune was given the name of San Pietro Apostolo, attesting its separation from Tiriolo which remained, however, the administrative seat. Law No. 360 of 1 May 1816 transferred the village of San Pietro Apostolo with its 1992 inhabitants from the administration of Tiriolo to that of Gimigliano, and from the province of Calabria Ultra to the new province of Calabria Ultra Seconda (Catanzaro). Revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi stopped here on the night of 28 August 1860. The leader of the Expedition of the Thousand, coming from Maida, was a most welcome guest of the Garibaldi supporter Anselmo Tomaini (already condemned to death by the Bourbons for having been one of the supporters of the movements of Maida and Filadelfia) where, with his closest collaborators, he took note of the situation and planned the forthcoming operations that would have opened the roads to Naples; on the same night Francisco Stocco, with only a few men, induced the surrender of 10,000 men commanded by General Ghio and encamped at Soveria Mannelli, by cleverly having ignited numerous fires placed very visibly on the surrounding heights. Garibaldi's visit is commemorated by two tablets placed on walls of the Tomaini Palace in 1887 and 1961. San Pietro Apostolo under a blanket of snow In the course of the 17th century, an important role was played in the economy of San Pietro by the harvesting and processing of gorse (it. 'ginestra'), a fibrous plant that was softened in the Amato river below the village. This provided a fiber which was used by local spinners for the production of cloth. Silkworm breeding was also very common - the worms were fed on white mulberry leaves which were present in the area. The silk thus produced was almost all locally processed and for the most part marketed in Catanzaro, Nicastro and also in the neighboring town of Serrastretta.

The pufflegs are hummingbirds from the genera Eriocnemis and Haplophaedia. They occur in humid forest, woodland and shrub at altitudes of 1000 to 4800 m. asl in the Andes of Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela. The males have a colorful green, coppery or blue plumage, and the females are generally somewhat duller. The most striking feature of both sexes is their dense snow- white leg puffs which consist of feather tufts that resemble woolly panties. One species - the black-thighed puffleg - is characterized by black coloured leg puffs, and another - the buff-thighed puffleg - has lightly buff-tinged leg puffs. Further common features of all species are the straight black bill and the slightly to deeply forked tail. The members of the genus Haplophaedia are generally duller than the members of Eriocnemis. While most pufflegs remain fairly common, three species (colorful puffleg, black-breasted puffleg and gorgeted puffleg) are critically endangered and one (the turquoise- throated puffleg) is possibly extinct.

Geography The village is bordered by Badolato and Guardavalle. Santa Caterina dello Ionio is divided into two locations; the Marina, and the upper mountain village, located about 9 km from the coast. The village of about 2,100 inhabitants in 2013 is along the highway SS 106 Ionica and is located about 50 km from Catanzaro (Roccelletta), 150 km from Reggio Calabria, only 15 km from Riace (where the ‚ÄúRiace Bronzes‚Äù were discovered), 8 km from Monasterace (Caulonia) and about 60 km from Locri. Consider visiting the Cliffs of Caminia (along the SS 106); you can enjoy wonderful sights at heights with exceptional views of the breathtaking sea. Holidays are exceptional, far from crowded beaches. You will be surrounded by white sandy beaches and a beautiful blue sea. It is the site of large marine areas, between coastal towns of the Ionian Sea. There are 3 to 15 km of completely deserted beach with widths from 50 to 150 metres from the shore. The coastline, full of coves, ranges from beaches of white granite sand to rocky coastal cliffs, which are accessible to everyone. History Santa Caterina under the colonization of Magna Grecia, the Romans, and finally by the Greek-Byzantine. The Greeks founded along the coast from the 8th Century. Colonies flourished, but near the sea there was little suitable defense. The Greeks felt the need to unite in a safer and more suitable place for defense of all villages, abandoning the coast because of malaria and Saracen pirate invasions. It is believed that Santa Caterina dello Ionio arose following the Saracen invasions (650-1086 AD), by the union of the colonies in the territory. Originally, it was a small village surrounded by defensive walls, which opened four doors. Only one door \\"Porta dell'acqua\\", which translates to \\"Gateway of the water\\", remains. Around 1060, Santa Caterina dello Ionio became part of the county of Badolato. In 1272, the first lord of the village was Rinaldo Conclubet. In 1487, the noble family of Arena of Conclubet was involved with the conspiracy of the Barons. They were overthrown and the town was handed over to Conte Alberico from Barbiano. In the following years, various noble families ruled from Cordova to Galeotta, Gallelli of Badolato, from Gioieni to Colonna. In the seventeenth century, the noble family of Marzano endowed the village with a castle. In 1799, the possession of the territory passed to Di Francia, who held it until the abolition of feudalism. How to reach the town Once you arrive at the Lamezia Terme International Airport or train station, decide whether to rent a car or use the various private transfer services., by travelling along the highway A3 Salerno - Reggio Calabria, exit Lamezia Terme - Catanzaro. Continue along the S.S. 280 (E848) towards Catanzaro.

They occur in humid forest, woodland and shrub at altitudes of 1000 to 4800 m. asl in the Andes of Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela. The males have a colourful green, coppery or blue plumage, and the females are generally somewhat duller. The most striking feature of both sexes in the genus Eriocnemis are their dense snow-white leg-puffs which consist of feather tufts that resemble woolly panties. One species, the black-thighed puffleg - is characterized by black coloured leg-puffs. Most have a contrasting blue, purple or coppery-red vent, but this is green in the black-thighed and emerald-bellied puffleg. Further common features of all species are the straight black bill and the slightly to deeply forked tail. The genus name was coined by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach who called them Snowy panties. While most members of this genus remain fairly common, three species (colorful puffleg, black-breasted puffleg and gorgeted puffleg) are critically endangered and one (the turquoise-throated puffleg) is possibly extinct.

After a dozen championships between second and first division, in 1930 Vogherese lost the playoff for promotion to Serie B in Piacenza for three goals to two.

Among his best-known works are Behind the Footlights (Pennsylvania Academy, Philadelphia) and The Pink Sash (Metropolitan Museum, New York).  Biography  Kronberg was born in Boston, and studied at the Boston Museum School, under Edmund C. Tarbell and Frank Weston Benson, where he earned a Longfellow Traveling Scholarship. Kronberg also studied at the Art Students' League, New York, and at the Acad√©mie Julian (1894‚Äì1896) under Jean- Paul Laurens and Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant, and privately with Rapha√´l Collin. In Paris, Kronberg became enamored with the works of Edgar Degas and proficiently painted ballet and Spanish dancers within theatre settings. Establishing himself in Boston, Kronberg was appointed instructor in the portrait class of Boston's Copley Society of Art. Kronberg was vastly supported by Boston's great art matron Isabella Stewart Gardner, and hence his work is represented in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, as well as in the museums of Boston and Indianapolis. After Bernard Berenson, Kronberg frequently went to Paris to buy art for the Gardner Museum. He lived in Boston until 1919, when he moved to New York City. From 1921‚Äì1922 he painted in Algiers and Spain. Later, he lived in Palm Beach, and throughout his career he traveled back and forth to Paris. Kronberg was an Associate of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1935). He was known for his philanthropic efforts and financed painter Arthur Clifton Goodwin's career for over fifteen years.  Art style  Although Kronberg is considered a \\"Tarbellite\\" because he trained with Tarbell and Benson, he was highly influenced by the French Impressionists and especially the pastels and oils of ballerinas painted by Degas. His work shows the influence of his French training ‚Äî his compositions are good and his colors soft and harmonious, yet with decided contrasts. His best work was executed prior to 1915 before he became nearsighted.

She was born on- screen during the episode broadcast on 2 February 1987. She was played by Leah King in 1987 and by Lynsay King from 1987 until 8 October 1999 when King opted to leave to focus on her education. Tina O'Brien took over the role on 31 October 1999; she opted to leave in 2007 and made her final on-screen appearance on 30 December 2007. A number of false rumours about O'Brien returning to the role surfaced during her absence from the serial. In October 2014, it was announced that O'Brien would reprise the role, she returned on screen on 30 March 2015. Sarah is the daughter of Gail (Helen Worth) and Brian Tilsley (Christopher Quinten), sister to Nick Tilsley (Warren Jackson, Adam Rickitt, Ben Price), half-sister to David Platt (Thomas Ormson, Jack P. Shepherd), granddaughter to Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls), Ted Page (Michael Byrne) and Bert (Peter Dudley) and Ivy Tilsley (Lynne Perrie) and mother to Bethany (Mia Cookson, Amy & Emily Walton, Lucy Fallon), Billy and Harry. Storylines =1987‚Äì2007= Sarah is born prematurely in February 1987 and questions are raised about her paternity, due to Gail's affair with Brian's cousin, Ian Latimer (Michael Loney) and Brian rejects Sarah, believing she was not his daughter; until a blood test reveals otherwise. Her birth reunited Gail and Brian after their divorce, however, Brian dies in February 1989 after being stabbed by a group of thugs. Gail then starts a relationship with Martin Platt (Sean Wilson), they had David together on Christmas Day 1990 and later married. Brian's mother, Ivy Tilsley (Lynne Perrie), tried to fight against Martin adopting Nick and Sarah as their names would change from Tilsley to Platt. Despite trying to fight the adoption, Nick and Sarah were allowed to be adopted. Gail and Martin's marriage eventually broke up a decade later. Sarah befriends Candice Stowe (Nikki Sanderson). After her 13th birthday in February 2000, Sarah discovers that she is five months pregnant. Her daughter Bethany Platt is born in June 2000. Bethany's father, Neil Fearns (Paul Holowaty), has no interest in Bethany, but when Neil dies in a car crash in September 2003, Sarah takes Bethany to his funeral and makes friends with Neil's mother, Brenda Fearns (Julia Deakin). This nearly leads to Bethany's death, when Brenda tries to commit suicide with Bethany, fearing that Bethany is being raised in a house of sin. Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire), however, finds them and stops Brenda before harm is done. Sarah becomes rebellious at the age of 15, splitting from her boyfriend Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley) in 2002 and moving on to Aiden Critchley (Dean Ashton), who takes her joyriding and crashes the car, leaving Sarah with severe head injuries. She survives and dumps Aiden, disgusted that he had left her for dead in the wreckage. Sarah reconciles with Todd and they move into the flat over the bookies, causing problems between Gail and Sarah, particularly when Sarah tells her that she is pregnant, in late 2003. She is unsure about having the baby but Todd convinces her to go ahead and they get engaged, despite their families' disapproval. However, Sarah is unaware that Todd is struggling with his emerging homosexual feelings and begins an affair with Karl Foster (Chris Finch). When Sarah finds out in May 2004, she dumps him and suffers a placental abruption shortly afterwards. She has to have an emergency caesarean and her baby son, Billy, dies soon after he is born in June 2004. Sarah blames Todd and refuses to allow him to attend their son's funeral but Todd ignores her and goes regardless. Sarah dates Scooter Makuna (Sushil Chudasama) before embarking on a more serious relationship with Todd's brother, Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas), destroying his relationship with Violet Wilson (Jenny Platt). Sarah and Jason get engaged, but once again, their families oppose the marriage. Jason gets cold feet on their wedding day and jilts her at the altar. It takes Sarah time to forgive him, but they eventually reconcile and the wedding is re-organized. Sarah's relationship with David is strained when Bethany takes an ecstasy pill that David had hidden in one of her dolls, and nearly dies and Sarah forbids David from attending her wedding while Gail kicks him out. The pair continue to bicker continuously at each other up until Sarah's wedding day in October 2007, when he attempts to kill himself. The police interrupt the ceremony to inform the Platt family of the attempted suicide; Sarah marries Jason regardless knowing it's just a sick stunt to ruin her wedding. Shortly after, Gail's brother Stephen Reid (Todd Boyce) visits and offers David a job in Milan. Jealous, Sarah sabotages this by planting drugs on him, so Stephen withdraws the offer and offers it to Sarah instead. She accepts and she, Jason and Bethany leave for the airport to fly to Milan. However, at Manchester Piccadilly, Sarah tells Jason that she planted the drugs on David. Disgusted, he walks away, leaving Sarah to fly to Milan alone with Bethany in December 2007.CORONATION STREET (EPISODE 6719) =2015‚Äì= Bethany (now played by Lucy Fallon) returns to Weatherfield in March 2015, without Sarah's permission. A furious Sarah soon follows to take her back to Milan but Bethany refuses to leave and eventually, after losing her job, Sarah announces that they are moving back to Weatherfield. Sarah begins a relationship with Callum Logan (Sean Ward), a drug dealer who is in the middle of a custody battle with David over his son and David's stepson Max Turner (Harry McDermott). Sarah later breaks up with Callum when she learns of his true colours following a gun being found in Max's bedroom. She tells the police about the gun but he isn't charged; Callum swears revenge on the Platt family. Callum later tells David and his wife and Max's mother Kylie Platt (Paula Lane) that in exchange for ¬£20,000, he will be out of their lives forever. Callum turns up at the Platt house where he takes Sarah hostage and when she tries to escape, he attacks and attempts to rape her but is stopped when Kylie arrives and hits him over the head, killing him. Sarah is left in shock and is forced to help cover up his murder. Callum's murder leaves Sarah traumatised. Sarah drunkenly stumbles into the street and is hit by a van. She is taken to hospital, where she discovers she is four months pregnant with Callum's baby. She decides to have an abortion but Kylie later talks her out of it. Sarah later goes into labour five weeks early and gives birth to a son who she names Harry Platt. Sarah becomes paranoid, thinking Harry can sense Callum's presence. Following the discovery of Callum's body under the floor in the Platt household, Sarah confesses to Todd that she knows how Callum died. Todd then comes up with a plan to blame Callum's murder on Jason's deceased father Tony Stewart (Terrance Maynard). Sarah later becomes increasingly disturbed, thinking Callum is still alive and planning to kill her. She is taken to a psychiatric unit and diagnosed with postpartum psychosis. Sarah starts a relationship with Gary Windass (Mikey North) after he helps Bethany who is experiencing school bullying. Sarah ends it when she discovers Bethany has a crush on him. Bethany later overdoses on exercise pills but recovers and encourages Sarah to get back together with Gary. Sarah discovers that Bethany is in a relationship with Nathan Curtis (Christopher Harper) who is much older than her. Sarah does not approve of the relationship and takes a strong disliking to Nathan but accepts that it is Bethany's decision, taking her to the doctors for contraception. She later finds out Bethany is being groomed and Nathan is subsequently arrested with Bethany moving back in with Sarah. Sarah throws out Gary having been told he had a one-night stand with Nicola Rubinstein (Nicola Thorp) and got her pregnant. Sarah decides to get back with Gary after forgiving him for getting Nicola pregnant. Creation and casting Tina O'Brien (pictured) has portrayed Sarah since she was age sixteen. The character of Sarah was created as the daughter of Brian and Gail Tilsley. The character was born on screen. Sarah was played by Lynsay King from 1987 to 1999. Lynsay's twin sister Leah, who died of cot death in 1987, alternated in the role of Sarah with Lynsay for a brief period until her death. Tina O'Brien was recast in the role in 1999. O'Brien was given the part when she was 16, playing the character who was still only 12 at the time. She left the role in 2007, but has said that she would consider returning to the role in the future. O'Brien confirmed her return to the serial in October 2014, with her returning to filming in February 2015, and appearing on-screen from March 2015 onwards. Speaking about her character Sarah's future on the show with The Sun TV Magazine in October 2015, O'Brien said: \\"I think there is so much more room for Sarah to develop, so I'm here for the foreseeable, as long as they want me.\\" Development =Teenage pregnancy= The character's teenage pregnancy storyline was created to highlight the risks of teenage pregnancy. However, the storyline has been a highly controversial and discussed storyline because of the possibility that it glamorised the idea. Despite this, it has been praised for its message. Actress Tina O'Brien has revealed that she was \\"naive\\" over the plot at the time of filming, oblivious that it would create much controversy. The storyline has been discussed in Television and criticism published by Intellect Books, which talked about the character and the storyline's impact. =Internet grooming= In May 2001, it was revealed that Coronation Street would feature a storyline in which the issue of paedophiles \\"grooming\\" kids over the internet will be played out by Sarah. In the storyline, Sarah turns to the internet in her bedroom as a way of meeting people. While visiting chatrooms, she is befriended by a 16-year-old boy who shares her interests and sends her a photo of himself. It turns out however that it is a man posing as a 16-year-old, and when he persuades Sarah to meet him face-to-face, she finds herself in a very dangerous situation. A spokeswoman for Granada confirmed the writers would be talking to the Home Office regarding the story. \\"We have been in touch with the Home Office,\\" But it is very difficult at the moment with the election on and the government in purdah. We hope to work with it afterwards though.\\" As for the reason behind the plot, the spokeswoman said they hoped to highlight the issue of internet crime, given recent publicity by the Tonight with Trevor MacDonald show and TV presenter Carol Vorderman. The show should also prove a far more effective measure in tackling concern over internet chatrooms than either the melodramatic outpourings of celebrities or the authoritarian and legislative approach of the government. \\"Sarah is hugely popular and a great role model for teenagers,\\" the spokeswoman said. \\"No matter how many politicians talk about the problem, they will never beat a peer in getting the message across. Plus, we know that many parents and kids watch the show side by side. Hopefully, we will spark some debate and then we would have done a good public service.\\" It's hard to argue with that logic. However, while the show should do more to make kids aware of the potential dangers of chatrooms, we remain concerned that it could also be used to kick up a storm that will see unnecessary and draconian legislation pushed through on a wave of public worry. =Relationship with Todd Grimshaw= Sarah begins a relationship with Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley) after he ends his relationship with Sarah's best friend Candice Stowe, portrayed by Nikki Sanderson. Sarah later ends their relationship because she wants to date Ade Critchley (Dean Ashton). O'Brien and Langley were in a relationship and she told Frances Traynor from the Daily Record that acting out their break-up was not strange. Sarah had a relationship with Todd Grimshaw, portrayed by Bruno Langley (pictured). Todd then resumes his previous relationship with Candice. But Sarah soon returns to Todd. She decides to sleep with him on her sixteenth birthday. The storyline was controversial and nine viewers contacted the Independent Television Commission. The organisation investigated the scenes and cleared Coronation Street of breaching guidelines. They praised them for building a relationship between the two characters and viewed it as a mature decision. O'Brien told Steve Hendry from the Sunday Mail that Sarah is \\"a bit dependent on Todd\\". In June 2003, Alex Tate from The People reported that Sarah-Louise would dump Todd. Sarah fears that she and Bethany are preventing Todd from succeeding at Oxford University. But Sarah and Todd move into a flat together. Sarah's daughter Bethany Platt (Amy and Emily Walton) electrocutes herself and Todd finds her unconscious. The accident prompts Gail Platt (Helen Worth) to involve the social services. In March 2003, Polly Graham from the Sunday Mirror reported that executive producer Kieran Roberts wanted Todd to become the show's first gay character. The show confirmed that they had discussed the possibility but nothing had been decided upon. On 22 August 2003, it was reported that Todd would befriend Sarah's brother, Nick Tilsley (Adam Rickett) and kiss him. But he does not reciprocate. A show spokesperson said that the storyline was a \\"groundbreaking move\\" and predicted a varied and \\"huge reaction\\" from viewers. Emily Smith from The Sun reported that Todd would kiss Karl Foster (Chris Finch) and begin an affair. A spokesperson added that it was the beginning of Todd's realisation about his sexuality. While kissing Karl, Todd sees Sarah approaching and is \\"mortified\\", but she fails to notice Todd and Karl's kiss. The storyline sparks a fight between Sarah's mum Gail and Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver) Eileen and Gail. Gail brands Todd a \\"two- timing, twisted, lying pervert\\" and the two proceed to pull each other's hair out in the street. =Relationship with Jason Grimshaw= Sarah began a relationship and later went on to marry Jason Grimshaw, portrayed by Ryan Thomas (pictured). In late 2005, Sarah began dating Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas). They had an on off relationship and were due to marry in 2006. Speaking of the storyline Ryan Thomas said: \\"Jason was thinking about getting married in four years rather than four months. It was just a gesture, and that‚Äôs all he wanted it to be. He thought they would just get engaged and they didn‚Äôt have to get married for ages yet. It was more of a stepping stone for him. It has come round quickly for Jason, and he is sort of being pushed into it. He doesn‚Äôt want to lose Sarah so he is going along with it because he does actually love her.\\" Asked if Jason would settle down Thomas also said: \\"He's had a bit of a past and he's a bit of a Jack The Lad around Charlie but on this occasion, for once, he's actually showing some grown-up qualities and, when faced with the prospect of losing Sarah, he chose to bite the bullet. There's no grey area with Jason because there's not that much grey matter! Everything's in black and white. It's either marry Sarah and keep her or don't marry Sarah and lose her forever.\\" Speaking about if Jason will also be able to handle Bethany, Thomas said: \\"He certainly will ‚Äì he pulls her to one side during the ceremony and makes her a pledge. He realises he can't have Sarah without Beth ‚Äì they come as a package.\\" The storyline resulted in Jason leaving Sarah and also resulted in Sarah leaving the street for a new life abroad with Beth. =Departure= In April 2007, it was announced that Tina O'Brien had quit her role as Sarah. Speaking of her reason for her quitting, O'Brien said: \\"This has been an extremely difficult decision to make. I love playing Sarah and have had an amazing seven-and-a-half years in Coronation Street. But I feel that the time has come to see what else is out there for me as an actress\\". She also thanked the producers and the writers for giving her fantastic storylines during her stint on the show. She also revealed that she will miss everyone. Producer Steve Frost commented on her departure: \\"Tina is a fabulous actress and we will be sorry to see her go. However, we fully understand her ambition and desire to play other roles\\". O'Brien's final scenes aired on 30 December 2007. Sarah's voice was heard on Jason's phone on episodes broadcast on 4 and 6 January 2008. In February 2011, O'Brien revealed that leaving Coronation Street was the right decision, she went on to say: \\"Leaving Corrie was the hardest decision I ever made, but it was the right one,\\" she said. \\"I'm really glad I've had the opportunity to do different things. I still watch the show occasionally and get sucked in instantly\\". O'Brien later reflected on her decision to leave, saying: \\"I was very young when I started. If I‚Äôd have stayed much longer I wouldn‚Äôt have had the confidence to ever go,\\" she explained. \\"At Coronation Street, you are protected ‚Äì it‚Äôs very much a bubble. That‚Äôs lovely, but I‚Äôd never been a jobbing actress and I really needed that.\\"Sarah Platt's pregnancy bombshell: We spoke to Coronation Street's Tina O'Brien  Life  Life & Style  Daily Express In March 2008, it was reported that O'Brien was \\"seriously\\" considering a return to the soap just three months after leaving as she \\"struggled\\" to find acting work since an appearance in a Christmas pantomime.Jump up ^ O'Brien to make 'gradual return' to Corrie? at Digital Spy Ryan Thomas, who was O'Brien's boyfriend at the time, stated that he would \\"love\\" her to make a return to the soap so that they could work together again. It was reported again in July 2009 that she was to return to the role of Sarah for an \\"explosive\\" Christmas storyline in December 2009, but O'Brien denied these rumors saying that she wasn't going to make a comeback \\"anytime soon\\". In November 2011, the Daily Star revealed that Coronation Street producer Phil Collinson was planning on bringing back O'Brien and Nikki Sanderson who played Candice Stowe between 1999 and 2005 in a bid to fill the gap left by the departures of Helen Flanagan who played Rosie Webster and Katherine Kelly who played Becky McDonald. A source told the paper: \\"He's aware that Sarah-Lou and Candice were hugely popular characters. He thinks it would be a ratings winner to bring them back. Losing Katherine and Helen is a big blow to the show so Phil wants to beef things up a bit with the return of a couple of big names.\\" O'Brien revealed in January 2012 that bosses had not approached her about a return to the soap. O'Brien has since revealed that she is worried that another actress might take over the role of Sarah. In December 2012, a reporter from The Sunday Mirror reported that O'Brien would reprise her role in 2013, but the actress later denied the report. =Reintroduction= On 23 October 2014, it was announced that O'Brien had reprised her role and that Sarah would be returning to the show in Spring 2015. Speaking about her return, O'Brien said \\"I am delighted to be returning. Sarah has a lot of history and unfinished business on the street and I'm looking forward to finding out what she's been up to and why she's returned home.\\" O'Brien returned to filming on 2 February 2015. Helen Worth who plays Sarah's mum Gail Platt spoke of O'Brien's return on ITV breakfast show Good Morning Britain saying: \\"I am absolutely delighted. I found out yesterday for sure and I can't wait to welcome her back.\\" Discussing in an interview with Digital Spy about how she felt about being back on the show, O'Brien said: \\"It's lovely. I thought I was going to walk in and feel very much like the new girl, but actually I did a scene in the Platts' the other day and it was strangely normal, almost like someone was going to pinch me and say, 'You've been in a coma for seven years!' It was really odd, but nice.\\" Asked how the return came about, she replied: \\"Well, I had been to see [Coronation Street producer] Stuart [Blackburn] and we had some chats, but then I was in the process of having a baby so it was slightly put on hold. After I had Beau, it was then brought up again and I said, 'Oh yes, I'd love to'. It was nice actually, as it meant that I could have this really precious time with my little boy but I also knew that I was going back to something as well. There are things Sarah hasn't finished with David, Jason, her mum - and obviously now this whole new dynamic of Bethany. It's so exciting to be part of the Platts, so I jumped at the chance.\\" O'Brien revealed that she was nervous about returning after being away from the serial for several years: \\"I was really nervous as it has been so long, but the second the scripts came through, it was really quick. When I did the scenes with Jack [P Shepherd, who plays David] and Helen [Worth, who plays Gail] and everyone, it was really nice. Sarah has got a little bit older and wiser during her time away. She has mellowed, but she's still very outspoken. I think she thinks Weatherfield is a little bit beneath her. She struts back in, she's been working in fashion, she sees David and she is like, 'Oh my gosh, you are still living with your mum'. There is still a soft side of her and you see some really nice scenes with her daughter.\\" With the announcement of Sarah's return soon came the announcement of her daughter Bethany's return with Katie Redford being cast in the role. Speaking of the announcement, Redford said: \\"Until I'm actually on set, I genuinely don't think it will sink in that I'm joining the cast of Coronation Street. I know it sounds clich√©d but it really feels like a dream come true. Bethany Platt is going to be such a fun and witty character to play and I hope everyone enjoys her return as much as I'm going to!\\" It was later revealed that Redford would be replaced in the role of Bethany with Lucy Fallon taking over the role. Speaking of her casting, Fallon commented: \\"Walking onto the set was surreal and nerve wracking, but everyone has been really welcoming and I am thrilled to have been given this great opportunity.\\" Bethany made her return on screen on 20 March 2015, while Sarah made her return on 30 March 2015. =The Platts vs Callum Logan= In February 2015, producer Stuart Blackburn revealed that Sarah would embark on a relationship with Callum Logan, portrayed by Sean Ward, who is the ex-boyfriend of David's wife, Kylie Platt, portrayed by Paula Lane, and an enemy of David's. \\"David's got massive problems, because over the weeks Callum's taken a real liking to Max and Max is actually his biological son,\\" Blackburn told ITV. \\"And he's got almost as many rights to Max as David does. On the seemingly good news front is the return of Bethany and Sarah, but very quickly Callum takes a real liking to Sarah. It's a liking that is returned, so huge problems for David!\\" Speaking to Digital Spy at the TRIC Awards, Ward said of the storyline: \\"It's quite exciting. That's the Coronation Street I remember with Sarah-Lou in it. For her to be back in it now and me to be dating her is a bit crazy for me, but very enjoyable. Tina is so professional. She said she was nervous for the first scene, and then it's like she's never been away. And I think that's because of the family that we are on Coronation Street, that I've been accepted into. It is just so easy to slip back into it.\\" Asked whether Callum's interest in Sarah-Lou is really genuine, he replied: \\"Half and half. I mean there's the element that it's David's sister and that's going to help Callum's way on the street, but she's very feisty and he needs someone to match him, and I think Sarah-Lou is the girl to do that.\\" Speaking of the storyline in an interview O'Brien said: \\"I think it will be interesting to see a more daring side to Sarah. Because she had a baby quite young, she had to be more responsible back then. It's really nice to be working with Sean Ward. I'm sure people think it's funny that the second she walks in, she hooks up with the guy who will cause most problems with the family. \\"To begin with she isn't interested in Callum at all. It's only because David really gives her a hard time that it almost pushes her towards Callum. She even says, 'Don't tell me what to do or else I will do the opposite' because David is like 'You stay away'. She was going to stay away but David's attitude changes her mind!\\" Speaking of what Kylie's reaction to the Sarah and Callum relationship O'Brien said: \\"I don't know how Kylie is going to feel about the whole Callum situation. I think Sarah might be burning her bridges there. When Kylie comes back, they are an item. Can you imagine? 'Hi, happy maternity, I am with your ex!'\\" O'Brien revealed that Sarah would continue to see Callum following their relationship being exposed, She said: \\"I think that's what she is hoping for! In her head she thinks they could play happy families - she's ten steps ahead! She's really torn. I don't think Sarah actually harbours bad feelings towards her brother anymore so it's difficult. She does say to Callum at one point that he's won and her brother has lost, so she does show Callum support. But I think she's trying to be neutral for David too.\\" Sarah and Callum later break up and Sarah is furious to discover that Bethany has been delivering drugs on Callum's behalf. Sarah also later joins sides with David and Kylie following Callum threatening her and beating up her ex-boyfriend Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas). =Callum's murder and cover-up= Coronation Street aired a special live episode to celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of ITV. In the episode Callum and Sarah argue inside the Platt's home. Callum attacks Sarah, overpowers her and threatens her life. Kylie Platt (Paula Lane) walks in on the struggle and hits Callum over the head with a wrench. Her actions left Callum bloody and dead on her kitchen floor. The live episode concluded with David returning home to the fatal scene. He decides to help Kylie and Sarah to conceal Callum's murder. He wraps the body up and puts him down a manhole in their garage. The following episode features the trio plotting to dispose of Callum's body in a public space. An ongoing conversion of the garage in a bedroom extension poses a problem and they need to move quickly. But a series of events ruin their plans. Kylie and David are physically sick when they first try to remove the body from the man hole. They are later interrupted by a visit from the police who investigate Callum's abandoned car. Gail then hires Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) to cover the manhole up with concrete, unaware Callum is concealed inside. The show planned a dramatic stunt which would lead to the discovery of Callum's corpse. The scene featured Carla Connor (Alison King) causing a car accident, colliding with Tyrone Dobbs' (Alan Halsall) truck which crashes into the Platts' home. This causes the floor to give way and a recovery team unearthing Callum's body. Producers decided to conclude the story without Kylie being held accountable for the murder. Instead they used a character that had been recently killed off, Tony Stewart (Terence Maynard), who had publicly feuded with Callum. When Sarah confesses the truth to Todd, he decides to frame Tony for the crime - a scheme which proved successful. =Pregnancy and postpartum psychosis= On 15 October 2015, it was reported that there would be a shock twist in the recent Callum murder storyline with Sarah finding out she is pregnant with his baby. An ITV insider reportedly said: \\"It is a great twist by Corrie bosses. Sarah will be left with a heartbreaking dilemma about whether or not to keep evil Callum's baby. The decision threatens to tear the Platt family apart as they are already struggling to cope with keeping Callum's death a secret and now have this bombshell.\\"Coronation Street: Is there a shock pregnancy twist ahead for Sarah? Speaking about discovering her character was pregnant with Callum's baby, O'Brien said: \\"I literally gasped. Then I shuddered at the thought of being 'pregnant' again, and when I was expecting my second child Beau, I was just massive and uncomfortable towards the end.\\"Coronation Street's Tina O'Brien on new boss Kate Oates: 'I think everyone gets a bit nervous' Speaking of Sarah's reaction to the pregnancy O'Brien said: \\"She's absolutely stunned, \\"One she's been checked after being run over, the doctor tells her she‚Äôs absolutely fine ‚Äì and so is her baby! She obviously knows that the baby is Callum's. Sarah's devastated and she feels so shocked and foolish. It's horrendous for her.\\" O'Brien went on to say: \\"She's completely torn. Keeping the baby will mean having a reminder of Callum with her every day and having to live with what's happened even more than she already has to. Sarah would have to lie to her child for its entire life and she wonders whether she would be able to do that.\\" David's wife, Kylie, later finds out about the pregnancy, and O'Brien said \\"Kylie finds out because Sarah is acting really shifty. She's making secret phone calls to the clinic because she's unsure about what to do. And that‚Äôs how Kylie finds out. Weirdly, it's Kylie who's been on Sarah's side more than David. So I think Kylie will prove to be a support network for Sarah.\\"Coronation Street spoilers: will pregnant Sarah keep Callum‚Äôs baby? Tina O‚ÄôBrien interview Following Sarah giving birth to a baby boy named Harry, it was revealed that Sarah would talk to Callum's dead body as her anxiety increases. Sarah attempts to seek help by confiding in Kylie that she can't bear to be in the same house as Callum's corpse and can't stop thinking about him. Sarah later carries Harry into the annexe where she talks to Callum's corpse. O'Brien responded to the criticisms that Coronation Street has been copying EastEnders with soap fans noting the similarities to Stacey Branning's (Lacey Turner) postpartum psychosis storyline. On the comparisons, she told the Daily Star Sunday: \\"It's a shame. I'd be lying if I said it wasn't. Lacey Turner is a fantastic actress. But this is very different. Stacey's got bipolar, whereas Sarah's psychosis is centred around Callum. There were thoughts about her having post-traumatic stress disorder. But because she's had a baby and because she's got the trauma of what's gone on with Callum, it will be classed as post-natal psychosis.\\" O'Brien also noted that the storyline has been \\"the hardest thing I've ever done\\" and she's felt a huge responsibility to get it right. Reception Sarah's underage pregnancy storyline was praised by the UK government, public health minister Yvette Cooper said the show should be applauded for raising the issue in front of a mass audience. For her portrayal of Sarah, O'Brien was nominated in the category of \\"Most Popular Newcomer\\" at the National Television Awards in 2000. She was nominated for \\"Best Actress\\" at the 2005 British Soap Awards. O'Brien was also nominated for \\"Best Actress\\" at the 2016 Inside Soap Awards. Her portrayal of Sarah in her psychosis storyline earned her the award for \\"Best Performance in a Continuing Drama\\" at the RTS North West Awards 2016. O'Brien stated that she was \\"proud\\" to win the award, with her colleague Jane Danson, who was also nominated for the award, congratulating her on the win.

Falk has written psychoanalytic studies of Jewish and Israeli leaders, Jewish history, the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict, antisemitism and Islamic terrorism. Biography Avner Falk grew up in Tel Aviv and studied psychology and clinical psychology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (1960‚Äì1966) and at Washington University in St. Louis (1966‚Äì1970) where he received his Ph.D. in 1970. He returned to Israel in 1971 and worked as a clinical psychologist and psychotherapist in Jerusalem until 1995. He has published psychoanalytic biographies of Moshe Dayan, David Ben-Gurion, Theodor Herzl, Napoleon and Barack Obama. In 2005, his book Fratricide in the Holy Land: A Psychoanalytic View of the Arab-Israeli Conflict (2004) won the Outstanding Academic Title award from the American Library Association's Choice magazine. In July 2010 Dr. Falk was contacted by Dr. Hans-Joachim Lang, a Holocaust historian and journalist in the German university town of T√ºbingen, whose city government had just published the existence in its museum of a wooden Torah disc from Zgierz, the hometown of Falk's maternal family, which had been in its possession since 1994. It turned out that the disc was a relic from a Torah scroll that Falk's Polish-Jewish maternal grandfather, Jozef Cwi Szpiro (1880‚Äì1941), had donated to his Zgierz synagogue in 1927 in memory of his deceased parents, and that some time after 1939 came into the possession of Otto Michel (1903‚Äì1993), a well-known T√ºbingen university theologian, a former Nazi and SA member, who after the Second World War and the Holocaust became a Jewish Studies pioneer in T√ºbingen, and whose widow had given it to the city museum. Since then, Dr. Falk has been writing a psychohistorical book, which has also become a detective story, about when and how this relic of his grandfather's Torah scroll came into Michel's possession. Michel himself had said nothing about his Nazi past in his autobiography of 1989 and had apparently told no one about how he had come by the wooden Torah disc. In November 2011 Dr. Falk received this relic of his grandfather's Torah scroll from the mayor of T√ºbingen, Boris Palmer (born 1971), in a public ceremony in T√ºbingen's city hall, at which Falk delivered a German-language lecture on his findings entitled \\"Die Verneinung der Vergangenheit: Die Geschichte einer Thorarolle\\" (\\"The Denial of the Past: The Story of a Torah Scroll\\"). He continues his research for this book in the face of considerable resistance from some German archives.

Eisenhower School for National Security and Resource Strategy (Eisenhower School), formerly known as the Industrial College of the Armed Forces (ICAF), is a part of the National Defense University. It was renamed on September 6, 2012 in honor of Dwight D. Eisenhower who graduated from this school when it was previously known as the Army Industrial College. The Eisenhower School is a United States military educational institution tasked with preparing selected military officers and civilians for senior national security leadership positions dealing with the resource component of national power. The college conducts postgraduate, executive-level courses of study and associated research, awarding a Master of Science degree in national resource strategy to its graduates. Special emphasis is placed on materiel acquisition, joint logistics, and their integration into national security strategy. History Bernard Baruch's quote in the auditorium of the school The United States suffered severe mobilization difficulties during World War I. To minimize a recurrence, the Army Industrial College was established in 1924 to focus on wartime procurement and mobilization procedures.Gropman, Alan L., \\"Army Industrial College,\\" Professional Military Education in the United States edited by William E. Simons, Greenwood Press, Westport Connecticut, 2000, pp. 55-57.\\"The History of NDU\\", National Defense University, United States Department of Defense, Fort McNair, Washington, District of Columbia, accessed February 6, 2015.Mission, The Eisenhower School, National Defense University, United States Department of Defense, Fort McNair, Washington, District of Columbia, accessed February 6, 2015. Bernard M. Baruch, a prominent Wall Street speculator and Chairman of the War Industries Board, is regarded as one of the founding fathers. The first class at the Army Industrial College had only nine students, but by the early 1930s the college was graduating 40 to 50 students in each class. During the first three years, the college provided a five-month course of study. In 1927, the program was expanded to ten-months with one graduating class each year. Major Dwight D. Eisenhower graduated from the college in 1933 and later served on the faculty. In 1940, the colleges expanded to two classes and then graduated four classes in 1941. The college was closed in December 1941 after Japan‚Äôs attack on Pearl Harbor to make officers available to support the World War II. By that time approximately 1,000 officers had been trained at the college. The college re- opened in December 1943. Before war's end senior Army officers, including General Eisenhower (who was then the Allied Supreme Commander of the European Theatre), supported the concept of a joint war college to study mobilization planning and military logistics. From 1944 to 1946, Donald Armstrong was commandant of the Army Industrial college.Ancell, R. Manning; Miller, Christine M. (1996). The Biographical Dictionary of World War II Generals and Flag Officers. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press. p. 8. . In 1946, the school's name was changed to the Industrial College of the Armed Forces. ICAF moved to Fort McNair, near the newly founded National War College. The Industrial College offered a ten-month academic program for selected high potential officers.Gropman, Alan L., \\"Industrial College of the Armed Forces,\\" Professional Military Education in the United States edited by William E. Simons, Greenwood Press, Westport Connecticut, 2000, pp. 159‚Äì162. In 1948, Secretary of Defense James V. Forrestal, removed the college from the Army's jurisdiction and reconstituted it \\"as a joint educational institution under the direction of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\\" Display dedicated to alumnus Dwight D. Eisenhower ICAF moved into a newly constructed facility, Eisenhower Hall in 1960. During the next several years the character of ICAF changed dramatically. As the United States found itself increasingly involved in the Vietnam War, ICAF shifted from focusing on national industrial mobilization to educating leaders to manage logistical resources in such conflicts. Student demographics changed, with the first woman and African American students graduated in 1973. In 1976, ICAF became part of the newly established National Defense University. The Goldwater-Nichols Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 called for substantially increased attention to joint military education. In response the college expanded its curriculum, adding a joint operations module and a mandatory acquisition course. In 1991, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff gave ICAF responsibility for conducting a senior acquisition program military and civilian personnel from all the Services and Department of Defense agencies. The new senior acquisition program was offered in conjunction with the Defense Acquisition University.Price, David E., \\"Defense Acquisition University\\", Professional Military Education in the United States edited by William E. Simons, Greenwood Press, Westport Connecticut, 2000, pp. 118‚Äì120. In 1993, Congress passed legislation authorizing the Industrial College to award master's degree in national resource strategy. The graduating of the class of 1994 was the first to be awarded a master's degree. Unfurling of the new Eisenhower School flag in September 2012 In 2012, the college was renamed The Dwight D. Eisenhower School for National Security and Resource Strategy. It is now commonly known as The Eisenhower School. Today, the official mission of the college is to: \\"Prepare selected military officers and civilians for strategic leadership and success in developing our national security strategy and in evaluating, marshalling, and managing resources in the execution of that strategy.\\"  Faculty  The faculty is composed of civilian academics and highly qualified military officers from all the military Services. The military faculty members are normally Army and Air Force colonels along with Navy captains. Both the civilian and military faculty members are experts in the specific fields they teach. Civilian faculty members normally hold doctorate degrees (or the equivalent professional degrees). The faculty includes representatives from the United States Department of State and other federal agencies.\\"Eisenhower Faculty\\", The Eisenhower School, National Defense University, United States Department of Defense, Fort McNair, Washington, District of Columbia, accessed February 6, 2015.

Completed in 1940, it is Sergei Rachmaninoff's last major composition. The Symphonic Dances allowed him to indulge in a nostalgia for the Russia he had known, much as he had done in the Third Symphony,Maes, 272. as well as to effectively sum up his lifelong fascination with ecclesiastical chants. In the first dance, he quotes the opening theme of his First Symphony, itself derived from motifs characteristic of Russian church music. In the finale he quotes both the Dies Irae and the chant \\"Blessed art thou, Lord\\" (Blagosloven yesi, Gospodi) from his All-Night Vigil. Background Rachmaninoff composed the Symphonic Dances four years after his Third Symphony, mostly at the Honeyman estate, \\"Orchard Point\\", in Centerport, New York, overlooking Long Island Sound. Its original name was Fantastic Dances, with movement titles of \\"Noon\\", \\"Twilight\\", and \\"Midnight\\". While the composer had written to conductor Eugene Ormandy in late August 1940 that the piece was finished and needed only to be orchestrated, the manuscript for the full score bears completion dates of September and October 1940. It was premiered by Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra, to whom it is dedicated, on January 3, 1941.Sullivan, Jack. Copyright 2014 The Carnegie Hall Corporation. The work is fully representative of the composer's later style with its curious, shifting harmonies, the almost Prokofiev-like grotesquerie of the outer movements and the focus on individual instrumental tone colors throughout (highlighted by his use of an alto saxophone in the opening dance).Norris, New Grove, 2nd ed., 716. The opening three-note motif, introduced quietly but soon reinforced by heavily staccato chords and responsible for much of the movement's rhythmic vitality, is reminiscent of the Queen of Shemakha's theme in Rimsky-Korsakov's opera The Golden Cockerel, the only music by another composer that he had taken out of Russia with him in 1917. The Symphonic Dances combine energetic rhythmic sections, reminiscent of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, with some of the composer's lushest harmonies. The rhythmic vivacity, a characteristic of Rachmaninoff's late style, may have been further heightened here for two reasons. First, he had been encouraged by the success of his Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini as a ballet in 1939 and wanted to write something with which to follow it up. Second, he may have included material intended for a ballet titled The Scythians, begun in 1914‚Äì15 but abandoned before he left Russia. While no manuscript for the ballet is known to have survived, this does not make his quoting the work inconceivable, given Rachmaninoff's remarkable memory. He could remember and play back accurately pieces he had heard years earlier, even those he had heard only once. The work is remarkable for its use of the alto saxophone as a solo instrument. He was apparently advised as to its use by the American orchestrator and composer Robert Russell Bennett. The composition includes several quotations from Rachmaninoff's other works, and can be regarded as a summing-up of his entire career as a composer. The first dance ends with a modified quotation from his unfortunate First Symphony (1897), here nostalgically rendered in a major key. The ghostly second dance was called \\"dusk\\" in some sketches. The final dance is a kind of struggle between the Dies Irae theme, representing Death, and a quotation from the ninth movement of his All-night Vigil (1915), representing Resurrection (the lyrics of the All-night Vigil's ninth movement in fact narrate mourners' discovery of Christ's empty grave and the Risen Lord). The Resurrection theme proves victorious in the end (he wrote the word \\"Hallelujah\\" at this place in the score). Instrumentation The work is scored for an orchestra of piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, alto saxophone, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, triangle, tambourine, side drum, cymbals, bass drum, tamtam, xylophone, glockenspiel, tubular bells, harp, piano, and strings.

Come prima ‚Äì Allegro vivace (D minor ‚Äì D major) Arrangements =Concert= Rachmaninoff wrote an arrangement for two pianos concurrently with the orchestral version. This arrangement was first performed by the composer with Vladimir Horowitz at a private party in Beverly Hills, California in August 1942.Plaskin, Glenn. Horowitz. William Morrow and Company. NY. 1983. page 223. =Ballet= The name Symphonic Dances suggests that the composition can be danced to. Rachmaninoff corresponded with choreographer Michel Fokine about possibly creating a ballet from the Dances. He played the composition for Fokine on the piano; the choreographer responded enthusiastically.Fokine's letter to Rachmaninoff, dated 23 September 1940. Fokine's death in August 1942 put an end to any possible collaboration in this direction. In the 1980s, Joseph Albano choreographed the dances for the Albano Ballet in Hartford, Connecticut. In 1991, Salvatore Aiello choreographed the Symphonic Dances for the North Carolina Dance Theater. Peter Martins did so in 1994 for the New York City Ballet.

There also exists a recording of Rachmaninoff playing through the piano reduction for Eugene Ormandy, during which he sings, whistles and talks about how he thinks the Dances should be performed. Rachmaninoff played the first movement coda differently to the score; these minor changes were reproduced by the pianist Stephen Kovacevich when he performed the work with Martha Argerich at his 75th birthday concert at Wigmore Hall. https://theartsdesk.com/node/76275/view Recordings # Eugene Ormandy, conducting the Philadelphia Orchestra # Dimitri Mitropoulos, conducting the New York Philharmonic Orchestra (1942) # Nikolai Golovanov, conducting the USSR State Radio Symphony Orchestra, (1944 ‚Äì 1st and 3rd mts, 1949 ‚Äì 2nd mt) # Yevgeny Svetlanov, conducting the State Academic Symphony Orchestra of the Russian Federation # Kirill Kondrashin, conducting the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra # Kirill Kondrashin, conducting the Concertgebouworkest (Concertgebouw, 1976)https://www.discogs.com/Pyotr-Ilyich-Tchaikovsky-Sergei- Vasilyevich-Rachmaninoff-Kirill-Kondrashin-Royal-Concertgebouw- Orche/release/15231742 # Mariss Jansons, conducting the St Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra # Yuri Temirkanov, conducting the St Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra # Andr√© Previn, conducting the London Symphony Orchestra # Vladimir Ashkenazy, conducting the Concertgebouw Orchestra # Lorin Maazel, conducting the Berliner Philharmoniker # Sergiu Comissiona, conducting the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra # Eiji Oue, conducting the Minnesota Orchestra # Predrag Gosta, conducting the London Symphony Orchestra # Enrique B√°tiz, conducting the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra # Robert Spano, conducting the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra # Donald Johanos, conducting the Dallas Symphony Orchestra # Eugene Goossens, conducting the London Symphony Orchestra # Sir Simon Rattle, conducting the Berliner Philharmoniker # Martha Argerich & Nelson Goerner, at Edinburgh International Festival 2011 (version for two pianos) # Nina Schumann & Luis Magalh√£es, TwoPianists Records (Version for two pianos) # Valery Gergiev, conducting the London Symphony Orchestra # Semyon Bychkov, conducting the WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne # Valery Polyansky, conducting the State Symphony Capella of Russia # Sir Charles Mackerras, conducting the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra # Erich Leinsdorf, conducting the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra # Leonard Slatkin, conducting the Detroit Symphony Orchestra # Vladimir Ashkenazy & Andre Previn, Decca Records (version for two pianos) # Martha Argerich & Nelson Freire, at Salzburg Festival 2009 (version for two pianos) Notes ReferencesNorris, Gregory, ed.

An arms embargo may serve one or more purposes: * to signal disapproval of behavior by a certain actor, * to maintain neutrality in an ongoing conflict, * as a peace mechanism that is part of a peace process to resolve an armed conflict, * to limit the ability of an actor to inflict violence on others, or * to weaken country's military capabilities before foreign intervention. Historical examples =Argentina= United States President Jimmy Carter imposed an arms embargo on the military government of Argentina in 1977 in response to human rights abuses. An arms embargo was put in place with other economic sanctions by the European Economic Community within a week of the 1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands by Argentina, two British dependent territories in the South Atlantic, an EEC member. The European nations ended the embargo after the end of the ensuing Falklands War; Argentina looked to Western European countries and Israel for arms supplies during the US embargo until it was lifted in 1989. =Indonesia= The United States government imposed an arms embargo against Indonesia in 1999 due to human rights violations in East Timor. The embargo was lifted in 2005. =Iran= The United States imposed economic sanctions against Iran following the Iranian Revolution in 1979. However, to secure the release of American hostages, several senior Reagan Administration officials secretly facilitated the sale of arms to Iran in the 1980s, in a scandal called the Iran‚ÄìContra affair.The Iran-Contra Affair 20 Years On . The National Security Archive (George Washington University), 2006-11-24 In 1995 the US expanded sanctions to include firms dealing with the Iranian government. In March 2007, UN Security Council Resolution 1747 tightened the sanctions imposed on Iran in connection with the Iranian nuclear program. The UN sanctions were lifted on 16 January 2016. In September 2020, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the imposition of an arms embargo on the Iranian Ministry of Defence and Armed Forces Logistics and other entities involved in Iran's nuclear program, including the government of disputed Venezuelan President Nicol√°s Maduro for providing weapons to Iran. On 18 October 2020, Iran announced that the United Nations conventional arms embargo imposed on the country in 2007 got expired. The embargo barred Iran from purchasing arms, including tanks and fighter jets, from foreign nations. The embargo was lifted as per the conditions under Iran‚Äôs 2015 nuclear deal with world leaders, despite the objections from the United States. =People's Republic of China= The United States and the European Union stopped exporting arms to China after 1989, due to the Chinese government's violent suppression of protests in Tiananmen Square. In 2004-05, there was some debate in the EU over whether to lift the embargo.http://www.sldinfo.com/the-eu-arms- embargo-repeal-debate/ The EU Arms Embargo Repeal Debate https://www.academia.edu/5475879/The_EU_Arms_Embargo_on_China_a_Swedish_Perspective_2010_/ Hellstr√∂m, Jerker (2010) \\"The EU Arms Embargo on China: a Swedish Perspective\\", Swedish Defence Research Agency =South Africa= The arms embargo of South Africa from 1977 extended to dual-use items. The embargo was lifted by Resolution 919 in 1994. =United States of America= To protest the Vietnam War, Sweden imposed an arms embargo on the United States in 1966. This notably deprived Navy SEALs of the Carl Gustav m/45 submachine gun, resulting in the creation of the Smith & Wesson M76. List of current arms embargoes The countries included in the list are under arms embargo of the United Nations or another international organization (EU, OSCE and others) or country.

L'avenir de la Tradition entre r√©volution et occidentalisation (Paris, ed. Le Rocher), Islam.The Future of Tradition between Revolution and Westernization ( Le Rocher publisher, Paris) in 2008. The main subject of this book is Islam and the challenge of the future between revolutionary sectarianism and westernization. Nowadays Islam has become a main concern to the world. Words as \\"Islamism\\", \\"radical Islam\\", \\"salafism\\", \\"wahhabism\\", are often used without a clear meaning and content. Saint-Prot explains how orthodox Sunni Islam succeeds in bringing together the largest number of the Muslims with a creed, legal principles and rules which were defined by the traditionalist current. Tradition never rejected reformism and cannot be compared with rigid conservatism or with minority, but active, trends defined by their radical revolutionary sectarianism. Far from encouraging the radicalism whose most spectacular consequence is terrorism, the Tradition is the voice of Islam which tries to reconcile faith and respect of the immutable dogma and nowadays evolutions by the way of ijtihad (effort at reasoning to find a solution to a legal question) Saint-Prot develops a new analysis of great traditionalists as Ahmed Ibn Hanbal or Ibn Taymiyyah, and having as a main reference the works of the pre-reformist Mohammed Abdul Wahhab. The thesis studies the developments and evolution of the traditionist doctrines, especially from a socio-political and legal point of view, since the first centuries of Islam up to now, taking into account the important reformist trend with thinkers as Al Afghani, Mohammed Abdu, Rashid Rida or Abdul Rahman Al Kawakibi. This book demonstrates that the Islamic Tradition is a better answer to the sectarian extremists drifts than a westernization which would lead to the denial and loss of the Muslim identity, which is distinguished by a symbiosis between the temporal and the spiritual.

He specializes in iconography, themes and user interface design. Everaldo's works include general illustrations, comics, children's books, corporate design and many other areas. He is known in Linux circles for his \\"Crystal\\" icon theme. Career Everaldo worked for Conectiva and LindowsOS, and later as a freelance artist for SUSE, KDE, Mozilla and many other Linux-related projects. He has also worked on various projects for Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows XP platforms. In 2004, he joined Lindows.com as a full-time Lindows.com employee. Currently, he is the head of UX at Movile and consultant at Yellowicon Studio.Yellowicon.com Everaldo started out as an illustrator. He has illustrated many children's books, school books, and magazines (including one specialized in Linux). In 1998, when Everaldo purchased his first PC, he saw a Mac in the computers store. Not understanding much about operating systems at the time, he searched the Internet for an OS to install on his new machine, coming across Linux. He installed Linux and WindowMaker, and began making themes. In 2000 he made a few icons for Conectiva as a freelancer. Later, he was hired to work at their creation department. He designed Conectiva Linux's interface. His first KDE job was a splash screen, done in free time. Helio Castro sent it to KDE-Look, introducing Everaldo and KDE community to each other. In the beginning he used CorelDRAW 9, running in Linux and GIMP. Later, he moved to Adobe Illustrator. Crystal Everaldo's signature style is the distinctive \\"crystal\\" look, mainly consisting in icons that appear to be made of highly reflective surfaces. The Crystal Icons theme that he created for KDE has been used in many different applications and websites. Crystal made a large impact on KDE and also boosted the mindshare of SVG icons on the desktop. Coelho would later create the Crystal Clear icon set, where the icons also appear to have a certain transparent quality. When Everaldo started to work on Conectiva Linux 8, his intention was to create customized icons. Conectiva wanted to attract both Windows XP and Mac OS X users. This inspired him to focus on an intermediate concept of icons, \\"between realism of Mac OS X and cartoon colored style of XP\\". The result was the Crystal Icon set. Before 2001, the default icon theme for KDE was Torsten Rahn's HiColor. In 2001, Frank Karlitschek came up with the website \\"KDE-Look\\", which introduced Rahn to Everaldo's Crystal. He discontinued the work on HiColor and joined Everaldo's work on Crystal. Crystal SVG became the default icon theme in KDE 3.1. =Crystal Icon examples= {style=\\"margin:0 auto\\"  Image:Crystal Clear app amor.png Image:Crystal Clear app gimp.png Image:Crystal Clear app browser.png Image:Crystal128-background.svg Image:Crystal128-penguin.svg Image:Crystal128-blockdevice.svg Image:Crystal_Clear_app_wp.png Image:Crystal Clear action view multicolumn.png} References External linksOfficial website *Yellowicon Studios *Crystal icons Category:Brazilian graphic designers Category:Brazilian artists Category:Living people Category:KDE Category:1978 births Category:People from Curitiba ","title":"Everaldo Coelho"},{"id":"5974495","text":"www.isabelsoveral.eu Isabel Soveral (born 1961 in Oporto) is a Portuguese composer of contemporary music.

The ministry operates as A Girl Called Hope in New Zealand. Mercy Multiplied has a pro-life (anti-abortion) stance in its faith-based approach, and as such, extends its program to offer women with unplanned pregnancies with alternatives to abortion.Mercy Ministries website In 2010, Mercy extended their program to work with victims of sex trafficking. History A Girl Called Hope, Mercy Ministries New Zealand's new name. Mercy Multiplied was founded in 1983 by Nancy Alcorn. Nancy Alcorn had previously worked for eight years as an athletic director at the Tennessee Department of Corrections, a correctional facility for juvenile delinquent girls, then moved on to supervise foster-care placements, working with the Emergency Child Protective Services unit investigating cases of abuse and neglect. She then moved on to a Director of Women role at the Nashville Teen Challenge program for two years. Alcorn opened the first Mercy Ministries home in West Monroe In 1983 (which until 1987 was better-known as \\"Covenant Ministries\\"). A second home was opened in Nashville in 1996 followed by new corporate headquarters in 2001. Mercy Multiplied went international in 2001, opening two facilities Australia followed by further homes in the United Kingdom in 2006, New Zealand in 2007 and Canada in 2010. Following controversy and widely publicized abuse scandals, they announced the closure of the Australian homes. The Sunshine Coast facility closed in June 2008 followed by the Sydney (Baulkham Hills) home in October 2009. Mercy Ministries New Zealand registered the domain name for A Girl Called Hope on September 21, 2010, completing the transition to this new name on January 28, 2011. Mercy Multiplied also opened homes in St. Louis, Missouri and Sacramento, California in 2005 and 2009 respectively. To date, Mercy Multiplied has disclosed an anticipated home to be opened in Florida Ethos While the Mercy Multiplied website states they are a non- denominational Christian organization, Mercy Multiplied are also considered to be evangelical, charismatic and fundamentalist, both as an organization and in their approach to treatment. The Mercy Multiplied website states that the founder, Nancy Alcorn, established the following three financial principles for the program: # Accept girls free of charge; # Give at least ten percent of all donations to other organizations and ministries; and # To not accept any state or federal funding as it interferes with the freedom to share Christ. Funding According to the three guiding principles that founder Nancy Alcorn established, the Mercy Multiplied website states that they do not accept government funding, and as such, are supported solely by donations from individuals, organizations and other ministries. With regard to fund raising events, Mercy Multiplied host gala dinners, Christmas donation drives and running marathons throughout the year, and invite visitors to their website to donate by becoming a financial partner or \\"sponsoring\\" a girl. In spite of Mercy Multiplied principles of not accepting government funding and providing their program free of charge to their clients, Mercy Ministries Australia was investigated by the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) and found to be in breach of the Trade Practices Act 1997 and guilty of \\"false and misleading advertising\\" of their services, including advertising that their program was free of charge when their clients were in fact required to sign over their government welfare benefits. The former directors were required to issue a written apology as well as undertake to partially compensate the former residents from whom they took monies. Program structure and content =Individual counseling curriculum= Mercy Multiplied state that their counseling curriculum \\"combines biblical principles of healing and unconditional love with best-practice clinical interventions\\". This curriculum was said to have \\"replaced\\" \\"Restoring the Foundations\\" in 2009 by one media source, and in another, was said to have been \\"renamed\\" Choices That Bring Change. This change occurred in June 2008, following revelations that \\"Restoring the Foundations\\" involved the practice of exorcism/demonic deliverance. However, as of October 27, 2012, the Mercy Ministries of America website states that \\"Mercy Ministries does not perform or endorse exorcisms as part of its treatment curriculum\\". Modules of Restoring the Foundations, used by Mercy Multiplied until June 2008, included \\"salvation\\", \\"forgiveness\\", \\"godly/ungodly beliefs\\", \\"generational curses\\", \\"soul/spirit hurts\\" and \\"demonic oppression\\". Controversy Since early 2008, Mercy Multiplied have attracted considerable media attention in Australia, followed by the United States and the United Kingdom, drawing criticism of their employment of unqualified staff, overall medical negligence, and the use of demonic deliverance in their approach to treatment. The company's rebranding efforts from Mercy Ministries to Mercy Multiplied, but also including the new brand A Girl Called Hope in New Zealand, were criticized as attempts to silence critics. Endorsements Artists who have endorsed Mercy include BarlowGirl, Francesca Battistelli, CeCe Winans, COLMANblue (Kelli Trontel and two of ZOEgirl's three members) and Kari Jobe. Rebecca Barlow, guitarist and backing vocalist for BarlowGirl, used Meyer's curriculum to recover from an eating disorder and depression.

He played 79 tests for the All Blacks. He is the 2nd-most capped lock, and formed one of the most famous lock pairings in international rugby, often partnered with Robin Brooke in the All Blacks from 1992 to 1998. What Jones lacked in size he more than made up for in skill, Jones was picked over physically intimidating locks such as Mark Cooksley who was the tallest All Black ever. Jones made his All Black debut Saturday, 16 June 1990 v Scotland at Dunedin. At the time he was 23 years, 60 days old. Jones had an impressive start with a try on debut. Coincidentally six years later Jones played his 50th test, again at Carisbrook and again with Scotland the opponent. He scored at virtually the same exact spot in the stadium as he did six years before. Throughout his impressive career Jones was renowned for his ability in line- outs. In the Super 12 Jones made 38 appearances, often as captain, for the Chiefs between 1996 and 1999. He once scored three tries in a match, against the Waratahs in 1996. In 1998 he was handed a lengthy suspension after a stomping incident involving the Hurricanes' Jason O'Halloran. Jones started his career with Northland in 1988 as a string bean 20-year-old lock who was tipped for big things back then. He picked up the nickname \\"Kamo\\" after his home town just north of Whangarei in New Zealand's Northland region. In total Jones played 105 matches for the All Blacks including 79 tests. Jones was named captain for one match. Jones scored a total of 14 tries in All Blacks matches with nine of those in test matches. Retirement Jones now works as a television rugby commentator for Sky Sports and presented their now defunct programme 'RugbyCentre'.

Biography Rebecca Alban Hoffberger was born in a ‚Äúleafy middle-class suburb‚Äù of Baltimore, Maryland to Allen, a mechanical engineer, and Peggy Alban, a homemaker.Huggins Amy (2006), ‚ÄúRebecca Alban Hoffberger‚Äù, Maryland State Archives (Biographical Series # MSA SC 3520-14534). As a child, she suffered a bout with rheumatic fever which left her with painful episodes in her legs and periodic paralysis. \\"During these periods of illness, Hoffberger found Robert Louis Stevenson‚Äôs A Child‚Äôs Garden of Verses particularly comforting and therapeutic. She also enjoyed more macabre literature, however, and was drawn to fellow-Baltimorean Edgar Allan Poe at an early age.\\" At age 16, she was accepted to college but turned down the offer to study with the celebrated French mime Marcel Marceau in Paris, becoming the first American ever to do so. In a 2013 Baltimore Magazine article, Hoffberger said, ‚ÄúMy parents wanted me to stay in Baltimore and learn to be a secretary or have a practical fallback, but they were very accepting.‚ÄùMarion, Jane (2013), ‚ÄúForaging in the Fridge,‚Äù Baltimore Magazine, June 2013 issue. While living in Paris, she met and married a ballet dancer who would become her first husband, and after moving back to the United States, gave birth to a daughter, Belina. Hoffberger worked as a development consultant to both a literary society and a ballet company, as well as holding a position at the Boulder Free School in Colorado before eventually moving to Mexico with her daughter. While in Mexico, she met and married her second husband, Andrija Puharich, a notable physician and parapsychologist who was studying traditional healing practices. (Puharich is perhaps best known for bringing Israeli psychic Uri Geller to the United States.) Hoffberger spent three years with Puharich helping to deliver babies in remote mountain areas in the state of Morelos, and although this marriage also ended, it produced Hoffberger‚Äôs second daughter, Athena. After making her way back to Baltimore, Hoffberger began work as the Development Director for Sinai Hospital‚Äôs \\"People Encouraging People,\\" a program which provided support to institutionalized psychiatric patients in facilitating their return to the community. She then married her third husband, LeRoy E. Hoffberger ‚Äî a wealthy attorney and heir of a philanthropic Baltimore family that formerly owned a brewery and a stake in the Baltimore Orioles ‚Äî who was 27 years her senior. Hoffberger spoke fondly of the psychiatric patients in a 1995 interview with American Style, \\"I was so impressed with their imagination. I looked at their strengths, not their illness.\\"Bio: Rebecca Alban Hoffberger, Maryland Women's Hall of Fame. Maryland State Archives Website. Biography courtesy of the Maryland Commission for Women, 2006. ¬© Copyright Maryland State Archives, 2006. Accessed July 2013. It was while working with this program that Hoffberger began to develop the idea for a ‚Äúvisionary‚Äù museum, the idea which eventually blossomed into the American Visionary Art Museum, or ‚ÄúAVAM.‚Äù Development of the museum After working with patients at Sinai Hospital‚Äôs ‚ÄúPeople Encouraging People‚Äù program, Hoffberger became focused on developing her idea of a \\"visionary museum‚Äù‚Äîa facility that would specialize in showcasing the work of self-taught, \\"visionary\\" artists, and serve as an education center that emphasized intuitive, creative invention. While developing the idea for the museum, Hoffberger visited Jean Dubuffet‚Äôs Collection de l‚ÄôArt Brut in Lausanne, Switzerland, accompanied by her husband, who eventually became the museum co- founder. During this visit, Rebecca was greatly impressed by Dubuffet‚Äôs use of \\"non art-speak,\\" along with personal artist bios that emphasized the simple facts of the artists' lives, their creative visions, and the use of the artist‚Äôs own words. Upon returning to Baltimore, Hoffberger collaborated with the George Ciscle Gallery in Baltimore to mount two successful shows, the first of which featured matchstick artist Gerald Hawkes.Museum History: The AVAM Story, American Visionary Art Museum website, accessed July 2013. In February 1989, the American Visionary Art Museum (AVAM) was incorporated as a 501(c)3 non-profit organization. The City of Baltimore offered the organization exclusive development rights on the property located at 800 Key Highway‚Äîformerly the 1913 offices to the Baltimore Copper Paint Company and an adjacent historic whiskey warehouse‚Äîcontingent on design, neighborhood approval and obtaining full project funding. Hoffberger began fundraising efforts and received an initial $250,000 planning grant from USF&G;, soon followed by a cumulative $2.4 million challenge grant from the Zanvyl & Isabelle Krieger Foundation, matched by many generous private and public grants, along with $1.3 million in bonds issued by The State of Maryland to finance the construction. Otto Billig, M.D. and Edward Adamson (the first proponent of art therapy in Britain) each gifted their important research archives and library collections to AVAM (Billig gifted the museum 400 pieces of art created by mental patients). This same year, Rebecca and LeRoy Hoffberger were married. In 1992, additional contributions for the museum came from The Body Shop founder Anita Roddick and Gordon Roddick. In 1995, LeRoy sold his collection of German Expressionist art via Christie‚Äôs to top off final monies needed for the museum, a gift that would ensure that the museum could open debt-free. On November 24, 1995, the American Visionary Art Museum opened to the public. In her inaugural address, Hoffberger stated that ‚Äú...the American Visionary Art Museum opens its doors of perception not in an effort to make war on academic or institutionalized learning, but to create a place where the best of self-taught, intuitive contributions of all kinds will be duly recognized, explored, and then championed in a clear strong voice.\\"Museum History: Inaugural Address, November 24, 1995, American Visionary Art Museum website, accessed July 2013. This statement is echoed in the museum‚Äôs Seven Education Goals, penned by Hoffberger, which serve as part of the museum‚Äôs mission to function as an education center for ‚Äúvisionary art.‚Äù These goals were also adopted by The Lower East Side Girls Club when it was founded in 1996. =AVAM‚Äôs Seven Educational Goals:AVAM's Seven Educational Goals, American Visionary Art Museum website, accessed July 2013.= # Expand the definition of a worthwhile life. # Engender respect for and delight in the gift of others. # Increases awareness of the wide variety of choices available in life for all, particularly students. # Encourage each individual to build upon his or her own special knowledge and inner strengths. # Promote the use of innate intelligence, intuition, self-exploration and creative self- reliance. # Confirm the great hunger for finding out just what each of us can do best, in our voice, at any age. # Empower the individual to choose to do that something really, really well Today, the museum is known internationally and welcomes over 100,000 visitors annually. In a 2012 article for Maryland Life Magazine, Donya Curie wrote ‚Äú...in a world where the average earned income‚Äîmoney taken in directly through admission prices and rental fees for weddings, etc.‚Äîfor an art museum is 29 percent, AVAM reached an all-time record of 72 percent in 2011. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just about unheard of,‚Äù Hoffberger says proudly.\\" In the same article, Hoffberger also said, ‚ÄúI think a good museum does more than just have objects that stand there on pedestals. The great ones are all muse-based, connecting viewers to the heart of inspiration.\\"Currie, Donya (2012), ‚ÄúVision Quest,‚Äù Maryland Life Magazine, June 4 issue. In a 2013 NEA Arts Magazine interview, she remarked, \\"Visionaries perceive potential and creative relationships where most of us don't. Without visionaries' willingness to be called fools, to make mistakes, to be wrong, few new 'right' things would ever be birthed.‚ÄùGustafson, J. Rachel (2013), ‚ÄúBreaking with Tradition: The American Visionary Art Museum,‚Äù NEA Arts Magazine, Number 2 Awards and accolades In 1998, Hoffberger was elected and served as a member of the Baltimore City Chamber of Commerce. The previous year, she won The Urban Land Institute‚Äôs coveted National Award for Excellence, and in 1996, she received the prestigious Gold Meir Award from Israel Bonds. In addition to Honorary Doctorates from McDaniel College, Pennsylvania College of Art and Design, Stevenson University, and Maryland Institute College of Art, Hoffberger was awarded the title of ‚ÄúDame‚Äù for her work on behalf of establishing medical field hospitals in Nigeria. She has been the recipient of numerous mental health advocacy and equal opportunity awards and has served as a Director of Jewish Education and on the Board of The Elisabeth Kubler-Ross Center, and has also been a featured speaker at many events, including 2009‚Äòs TEDxMidAtlantic.The Power of Stories, TEDxMidAtlantic 2009 Website, accessed July 2013. =Awards= Honorary Doctorate, McDaniel College, 2011 * Katherine Coffey Award, Mid-Atlantic Association of Museums, 2011 * Honorary Doctorate, Pennsylvania College of Art and Design, 2007 * President‚Äôs Award of the Maryland YWCA, 2006 * Inducted into the Maryland Women‚Äôs Hall of Fame, 2006 * Commencement Speaker and Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters, Stevenson University, 2004 * Visionary Award, On Our Own of Maryland, Inc., 2002 * Conrad Nelson Lecturer, Franklin & Marshall College, 2001 * Elected to Baltimore City Chamber of Commerce, 1998-2002 * Named one of Maryland‚Äôs ‚ÄúTop 100 Women‚Äù by The Daily Record, 1998 * Maryland State Women in the Arts Award, 1998 * National Award for Excellence, Urban Land Institute, 1998 * Open Your Mind Humanitarian Award, Alliance for the Mentally Ill, 1997 * Honorary Doctorate, Maryland Institute College of Art, 1996 * Distinguished Volunteer, Maryland Association of Psychosocial Programs, 1996 * Israel Bonds Golda Meir Award Honoree, 1996 * Sarah‚Äôs Circle Award, College of Notre Dame of Maryland, 1996 * Baltimore Urban League‚Äôs Award for Outstanding Community Involvement and Support for Equal Opportunity, 1995 Criticism At the time of the museum‚Äôs 1995 opening, it was reported that Hoffberger‚Äôs rejection of academic scholarship and her refusal to follow tradition had upset prominent members of the art world. Hoffberger is known as a renegade in the art world, assuming a posture of self-conscious eccentricity. But she has been criticized for her lack of interest in conventional art history and conventional museum practices. (For example, she refuses to hire a professional art curator.) A 2000 article in The New York Times quoted an art authority who referred to her as ‚Äúa self-aggrandizing dilettante rather than a serious champion of the works her museum exhibits‚Äù.Mansfield, Op. cit. Despite all this, the museum has won the support of collectors, critics, and the public through its exhibitions that examine the relationship of art to the human condition rather than to the canon of art history. Since its inception, Hoffberger has shied away from certain conventional museum practices, something which is a point of pride for the museum. Instead of hiring a professional art curator, she prefers to use guest curators for each of the museum‚Äôs exhibitions, which instead of focusing on the work of just one artist, are thematic in nature.

He was one of the leading figures in the development of community psychology. Career Albee was born in St. Marys, Pennsylvania. He attended Bethany College and graduated in 1943. He was drafted into the Army Air Forces and served until the end of World War II. After leaving the forces he attended the University of Pittsburgh where he attained his masters and doctoral degrees. Having received his doctorate in 1949 he spent the next two years in a research appointment at Western Psychiatric Institute. From 1951 to 1953 Albee worked for the central office of the American Psychological Association. In 1953 Albee went to Finland for a year as a Fulbright scholar, before returning to the US to become a professor at Case Western Reserve University, a post he held for 16 years.https://www.rhodeslab.org/files/mentorgeorgeAlbee.pdf In 1971 Albee left Case Western for a position at the University of Vermont. He remained here until his retirement in 1991. During that time, he married Constance Impallaria, They had four children: Alec, Luke, Maud and Sarah. During his career Albee was the author of groundbreaking studies in the 1950s and 1960s, that showed societal factors such as poverty, racism, sexism and child abuse, were to a large degree responsible for mental illness. He believed the psychological profession needed to focus more on prevention, rather than one to one treatment. After his retirement Albee spent time travelling around the world giving lectures on psychology as well as writing a humor column for his local newspaper the Longboat Observer. From 1969-70 Albee was the president of the American Psychological Association. During his tenure he negotiated conflicts between the mainstream of psychology and the demands of Black and female psychologists. He was the author of more than 200 articles and book chapters on community approaches to mental illness, as well as writing more than a dozen books. Albee died in Longboat Key, Florida.

She was the author of 8 books on art therapy and over 70 articles in professional journals. She was an international guest lecturer, and educator who has presented papers, led professional delegations, and conducted workshops in 14 countries throughout Europe and Asia. Wadeson was an Honorary Life Member (HLM) of the American Art Therapy Association, the profession's highest honor, and won numerous awards, including a first prize for art from the Smithsonian Institution, a Distinguished Faculty award from Northwestern University, a first prize for research from the American Art Therapy Association, the Benjamin Rush Bronze Medal Award from the American Psychiatric Association, and a Resolution of Commendation from the Illinois State Legislature. In addition to holding many offices on the American Art Therapy Association Executive Board, she has been Associate Editor of Art Therapy, Journal of the American Art Therapy Association. Education, Training, and Career Wadeson graduated from Cornell University where she studied psychology. She began taking courses at the Washington School of Psychiatry, American University and Catholic University when she met Hanna Kwiatkowska who opened her eyes to a world of art therapy.Junge, M., & Wadeson, H. (2006). Architects of art therapy: Memoirs and life stories. Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas. Kwiatkowska originated family art therapy and offered to train Wadeson at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). At this time, there were no master's degree programs in art therapy. Wadeson began working at NIMH in 1961 by conducting art therapy with adolescent groups. Her first publication was about this experience. For eight years, Wadeson worked with patients with affective disorders, including mania, psychotic depression, and suicide risk. During this time, Wadeson was the only female and non-MD on the project's research team. She won the Benjamin Rush Award for Scientific Exhibits from the American Psychiatric Association for her exhibit, ‚ÄúPortraits of Suicide.‚Äù Subsequently, she worked with people who suffered from schizophrenia and received no medication. After spending thirteen years at NIMH, Wadeson had published twenty-nine articles, primarily in psychiatric journals. Wadeson began working on her master's degree in psychology and art therapy from Goddard College. She then pursued her Masters of Social Work (MSW) at Catholic University. She was able to graduate in one year from Catholic University due to her vast amount of publications. While at NIMH, she taught art therapy at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Foundation for Advanced Education in the Sciences and at Montgomery Community College. Wadeson left NIMH, expanded her private practice, and began work on her Ph.D. at Union Institute. Her dissertation, \\"Art Psychotherapy,\\" was one of the first books in the field, and has currently sold 24,000 copies. In 1978, Wadeson began teaching at the University of Houston, where she became director of its Art Therapy Graduate Program. In 1980, she was recruited by the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). where she directed the Art Therapy Graduate Program for 23 years. One of Wadeson‚Äôs biggest contributions at the University of Illinois at Chicago was the ‚ÄúAnnual Summer Institute‚Äù, which was held at Lake Geneva, WI. This program continued for 20 years. Wadeson developed and currently directs the art therapy program at Northwestern University. American Art Therapy Association Wadeson held various positions in the American Art Therapy Association (AATA), including Publications Chair, Newsletter Editor, Research Chair, Honors Chair, Ethics Chair, and Status of Women Chair, among others, and has been the Associate Editor of the Art Therapy Journal of the American Art Therapy Association. Wadeson was awarded the art therapy profession's highest honor in 1992, Honorary Life Membership (HLM) from the American Art Therapy Association. Approach Wadeson was known for her eclectic approach to art therapy.Wadeson, H. (2001). An eclectic approach to art therapy. In J. Rubin (2nd ed.), Approaches to art therapy: Theory and technique (306-317). New York, NY: Routledge. She believed it is important for art therapists to have a comprehensive knowledge of various human development and sociological theories to be most effective in working in diverse settings. She stated that an eclectic approach allows the therapist to be open to possibilities and to use methods that best suit individual clients, groups, and communities. Although, she was eclectic she also described herself as humanistic, existential, and phenomenological.Wadeson, H. (2010). Art psychotherapy (2nd ed.). Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons. Nevertheless, she believed it is important for art therapists to develop their own approach based on their life experience.  Presentations  In 2012 Wadeson presented on her book \\"Journaling Cancer in Words and images\\" at Emporia State University's Art Therapy Discovery Day.http://esubulletin.com/10684/news/discovery-day- showcases-creative-remedies/ Publications Wadeson was giving presentations, workshops, and book signings throughout the US and in Europe, up to her recent passing, in connection with her most recent book, \\"Journaling Cancer in Words and Images, Caught in the Clutch of the Crab,\\" and its emphasis on the use of creative self-expression in facing the challenge of living with cancer In addition to 8 books, she has published 70 papers in refereed journals and numerous chapters in psychology and art therapy texts.

Current members are Ruben and Peg Bean, Sheryl Farris, Connie Fortner, Roger Fortner, and Eli Fortner. On November 23, 2019 the McKameys played their last concert in Knoxville, Tennessee. On average, the McKameys play approximately 150 bookings annually throughout the United States and Canada. With 16 No. 1 singles, the group was honored by Horizon Records in 1999 for having the most No. 1 hits in the history of Southern Gospel music. The McKameys also hold the record for having the most No. 1 songs on Singing News magazine's charts. Group history The group first organized in 1954 as a trio of sisters: Dora, Peg, and Carol McKamey. As their father was a Christian minister, the girls grew up singing in church. One day Dora announced to her astonished sisters that they were going to sing with her in church the next Sunday as a trio. \\"She gathered us up in her kitchen, started singing and we each found our parts,\\" Peg explained. \\"We just thought we were gonna sing that one time, in her home church, but different people heard us and invited us to sing at their church or at revivals. Then out of town evangelists heard us at the revivals and invited us to come to their church and we started traveling to Florida and Indiana and Ohio, and that's how it all started.\\" In 1957, Ruben Bean started playing guitar for the trio, and he and Peg married two years later. While their daughters, Connie and Sheryl, were growing up they traveled with their mom, dad and aunts when the group was on the road. After Dora and Carol retired from the trio in 1972, Connie and Sheryl stepped in to take over their parts. In the mid 1980s, Sheryl left the group to join her husband as a pastor's wife. At that time, Carol returned to the group, now made up of Peg, Connie, Ruben and Carol with Roger Fortner playing guitar. From late 1988 until mid-1989, Bonnie White replaced Carol until she ultimately returned to the group. The vocal lineup of Connie, Peg, Carol, and Ruben would perform together until April 2009 when Carol Woodard officially retired from full-time travel. Sheryl Farris returned to replace Carol. Since returning, Sheryl & Connie have traded the lead vocal for a change in the vocal lineup for standards like \\"The Shepherd's Point of View\\" and \\"When He Speaks\\" and \\"A Hill Worth Dying On\\". In 2007, Eli Fortner joined his parents, Roger and Connie, on stage full-time as a guitarist and featured vocalist. Eli's solos appear on every project since their 2005 release, The Old Path. In 2012, Roger Fortner stepped up to sing a solo, \\"Unspoken Request\\". Much to the delight of fans, Roger's first solo captured the No. 1 spot on the January 2013 Singing News Top 80 Charts and received nominations for Song of the Year in the 2013 Singing News Fan Awards and 2013 NQC Music Awards. Currently, all members of the McKameys perform at least one song during each program. Whether it is a mixed trio, mixed quartet, or male trio, the McKameys perform a variety of their classics combined with fresh favorites. In September 2018, The McKameys announced on singingnews.com in an open letter that November of 2019 would be the end of their full-time touring.

Readers who are new to the subject may first want to read the introduction to quantum mechanics. Relational quantum mechanics (RQM) is an interpretation of quantum mechanics which treats the state of a quantum system as being observer-dependent, that is, the state is the relation between the observer and the system. This interpretation was first delineated by Carlo Rovelli in a 1994 preprint, and has since been expanded upon by a number of theorists. It is inspired by the key idea behind special relativity, that the details of an observation depend on the reference frame of the observer, and uses some ideas from Wheeler on quantum information.Wheeler (1990): pg. 3 The physical content of the theory has not to do with objects themselves, but the relations between them. As Rovelli puts it: > \\"Quantum mechanics is a theory about the physical description of physical > systems relative to other systems, and this is a complete description of the > world\\".Rovelli, C. (1996), \\"Relational quantum mechanics\\", International > Journal of Theoretical Physics, 35: 1637‚Äì1678. The essential idea behind RQM is that different observers may give different accurate accounts of the same system. For example, to one observer, a system is in a single, \\"collapsed\\" eigenstate. To a second observer, the same system is in a superposition of two or more states and the first observer is in a correlated superposition of two or more states. RQM argues that this is a complete picture of the world because the notion of \\"state\\" is always relative to some observer. There is no privileged, \\"real\\" account. The state vector of conventional quantum mechanics becomes a description of the correlation of some degrees of freedom in the observer, with respect to the observed system. The terms \\"observer\\" and \\"observed\\" apply to any arbitrary system, microscopic or macroscopic. The classical limit is a consequence of aggregate systems of very highly correlated subsystems. A \\"measurement event\\" is thus described as an ordinary physical interaction where two systems become correlated to some degree with respect to each other. The proponents of the relational interpretation argue that this approach resolves some of the traditional interpretational difficulties with quantum mechanics. By giving up our preconception of a global privileged state, issues around the measurement problem and local realism are resolved. In 2020 Rovelli has published an account of the main ideas of the relational interpretation in his popular book Helgoland. History and development Relational quantum mechanics arose from a comparison of the quandaries posed by the interpretations of quantum mechanics with those resulting from Lorentz transformations prior to the development of special relativity. Rovelli suggested that just as pre- relativistic interpretations of Lorentz's equations were complicated by incorrectly assuming an observer-independent time exists, a similarly incorrect assumption frustrates attempts to make sense of the quantum formalism. The assumption rejected by relational quantum mechanics is the existence of an observer-independent state of a system.Rovelli (1996): pg. 2 The idea has been expanded upon by Lee SmolinSmolin (1995) and Louis Crane,Crane (1993) who have both applied the concept to quantum cosmology, and the interpretation has been applied to the EPR paradox, revealing not only a peaceful co-existence between quantum mechanics and special relativity, but a formal indication of a completely local character to reality.Laudisa (2001)Rovelli & Smerlak (2006) The problem of the observer and the observed This problem was initially discussed in detail in Everett's thesis, The Theory of the Universal Wavefunction. Consider observer O, measuring the state of the quantum system S. We assume that O has complete information on the system, and that O can write down the wavefunction \\\\psi\\\\rangle describing it. At the same time, there is another observer O', who is interested in the state of the entire O-S system, and O' likewise has complete information. To analyse this system formally, we consider a system S which may take one of two states, which we shall designate {\\\\uparrow}\\\\rangle and \\\\downarrow \\\\rangle , ket vectors in the Hilbert space H_S. Now, the observer O wishes to make a measurement on the system. At time t_1, this observer may characterize the system as follows: : \\\\psi \\\\rangle = \\\\alpha{\\\\uparrow}\\\\rangle + \\\\beta{\\\\downarrow}\\\\rangle , where \\\\alpha^2 and \\\\beta^2 are probabilities of finding the system in the respective states, and obviously add up to 1. For our purposes here, we can assume that in a single experiment, the outcome is the eigenstate {\\\\uparrow}\\\\rangle (but this can be substituted throughout, mutatis mutandis, by {\\\\downarrow}\\\\rangle). So, we may represent the sequence of events in this experiment, with observer O doing the observing, as follows: :\\\\begin{matrix} t_1 & \\\\rightarrow & t_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\alpha {\\\\uparrow}\\\\rangle + \\\\beta {\\\\downarrow}\\\\rangle & \\\\rightarrow & {\\\\uparrow}\\\\rangle. \\\\end{matrix} This is observer O's description of the measurement event. Now, any measurement is also a physical interaction between two or more systems. Accordingly, we can consider the tensor product Hilbert space H_S \\\\otimes H_{O}, where H_{O} is the Hilbert space inhabited by state vectors describing O. If the initial state of O is \\\\text{init}\\\\rangle, some degrees of freedom in O become correlated with the state of S after the measurement, and this correlation can take one of two values: O_{\\\\uparrow}\\\\rangle or O_{\\\\downarrow}\\\\rangle where the direction of the arrows in the subscripts corresponds to the outcome of the measurement that O has made on S. If we now consider the description of the measurement event by the other observer, O', who describes the combined S+O system, but does not interact with it, the following gives the description of the measurement event according to O', from the linearity inherent in the quantum formalism: :\\\\begin{matrix} t_1 & \\\\rightarrow & t_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left( \\\\alpha {\\\\uparrow}\\\\rangle + \\\\beta {\\\\downarrow}\\\\rangle \\\\right) \\\\otimes \\\\text{init}\\\\rangle & \\\\rightarrow & \\\\alpha {\\\\uparrow}\\\\rangle \\\\otimes O_{\\\\uparrow}\\\\rangle \\\\+ \\\\beta {\\\\downarrow}\\\\rangle \\\\otimes O_{\\\\downarrow}\\\\rangle. \\\\end{matrix} Thus, on the assumption (see hypothesis 2 below) that quantum mechanics is complete, the two observers O and O' give different but equally correct accounts of the events t_1 \\\\rightarrow t_2. Central principles = Observer-dependence of state = According to O, at t_2, the system S is in a determinate state, namely spin up. And, if quantum mechanics is complete, then so is this description. But, for O', S is not uniquely determinate, but is rather entangled with the state of O ‚Äî note that his description of the situation at t_2 is not factorisable no matter what basis chosen. But, if quantum mechanics is complete, then the description that O' gives is also complete. Thus the standard mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics allows different observers to give different accounts of the same sequence of events. There are many ways to overcome this perceived difficulty. It could be described as an epistemic limitation ‚Äì observers with a full knowledge of the system, we might say, could give a complete and equivalent description of the state of affairs, but that obtaining this knowledge is impossible in practice. But whom? What makes O's description better than that of O', or vice versa? Alternatively, we could claim that quantum mechanics is not a complete theory, and that by adding more structure we could arrive at a universal description (the troubled hidden variables approach). Yet another option is to give a preferred status to a particular observer or type of observer, and assign the epithet of correctness to their description alone. This has the disadvantage of being ad hoc, since there are no clearly defined or physically intuitive criteria by which this super- observer (\\"who can observe all possible sets of observations by all observers over the entire universe\\"Page, Don N., \\"Insufficiency of the quantum state for deducing observational probabilities\\", Physics Letters B, Volume 678, Issue 1, 6 July 2009, 41-44.) ought to be chosen. RQM, however, takes the point illustrated by this problem at face value. Instead of trying to modify quantum mechanics to make it fit with prior assumptions that we might have about the world, Rovelli says that we should modify our view of the world to conform to what amounts to our best physical theory of motion.Rovelli (1996): pg. 16 Just as forsaking the notion of absolute simultaneity helped clear up the problems associated with the interpretation of the Lorentz transformations, so many of the conundra associated with quantum mechanics dissolve, provided that the state of a system is assumed to be observer-dependent ‚Äì like simultaneity in Special Relativity. This insight follows logically from the two main hypotheses which inform this interpretation: * Hypothesis 1: the equivalence of systems. There is no a priori distinction that should be drawn between quantum and macroscopic systems. All systems are, fundamentally, quantum systems. * Hypothesis 2: the completeness of quantum mechanics. There are no hidden variables or other factors which may be appropriately added to quantum mechanics, in light of current experimental evidence. Thus, if a state is to be observer-dependent, then a description of a system would follow the form \\"system S is in state x with reference to observer O\\" or similar constructions, much like in relativity theory. In RQM it is meaningless to refer to the absolute, observer-independent state of any system. =Information and correlation= It is generally well established that any quantum mechanical measurement can be reduced to a set of yes/no questions or bits that are either 1 or 0. RQM makes use of this fact to formulate the state of a quantum system (relative to a given observer!) in terms of the physical notion of information developed by Claude Shannon. Any yes/no question can be described as a single bit of information. This should not be confused with the idea of a qubit from quantum information theory, because a qubit can be in a superposition of values, whilst the \\"questions\\" of RQM are ordinary binary variables. Any quantum measurement is fundamentally a physical interaction between the system being measured and some form of measuring apparatus. By extension, any physical interaction may be seen to be a form of quantum measurement, as all systems are seen as quantum systems in RQM. A physical interaction is seen as establishing a correlation between the system and the observer, and this correlation is what is described and predicted by the quantum formalism. But, Rovelli points out, this form of correlation is precisely the same as the definition of information in Shannon's theory. Specifically, an observer O observing a system S will, after measurement, have some degrees of freedom correlated with those of S. The amount of this correlation is given by log2k bits, where k is the number of possible values which this correlation may take ‚Äì the number of \\"options\\" there are. =All systems are quantum systems= All physical interactions are, at bottom, quantum interactions, and must ultimately be governed by the same rules. Thus, an interaction between two particles does not, in RQM, differ fundamentally from an interaction between a particle and some \\"apparatus\\". There is no true wave collapse, in the sense in which it occurs in the Copenhagen interpretation. Because \\"state\\" is expressed in RQM as the correlation between two systems, there can be no meaning to \\"self-measurement\\". If observer O measures system S, S's \\"state\\" is represented as a correlation between O and S. O itself cannot say anything with respect to its own \\"state\\", because its own \\"state\\" is defined only relative to another observer, O'. If the S+O compound system does not interact with any other systems, then it will possess a clearly defined state relative to O'. However, because O's measurement of S breaks its unitary evolution with respect to O, O will not be able to give a full description of the S+O system (since it can only speak of the correlation between S and itself, not its own behaviour). A complete description of the (S+O)+O' system can only be given by a further, external observer, and so forth. Taking the model system discussed above, if O' has full information on the S+O system, it will know the Hamiltonians of both S and O, including the interaction Hamiltonian. Thus, the system will evolve entirely unitarily (without any form of collapse) relative to O', if O measures S. The only reason that O will perceive a \\"collapse\\" is because O has incomplete information on the system (specifically, O does not know its own Hamiltonian, and the interaction Hamiltonian for the measurement). Consequences and implications = Coherence = In our system above, O' may be interested in ascertaining whether or not the state of O accurately reflects the state of S. We can draw up for O' an operator, M, which is specified as: :M\\\\left({\\\\uparrow}\\\\rangle \\\\otimes O_{\\\\uparrow}\\\\rangle \\\\right) = {\\\\uparrow}\\\\rangle \\\\otimes O_{\\\\uparrow}\\\\rangle :M\\\\left({\\\\uparrow}\\\\rangle \\\\otimes O_{\\\\downarrow}\\\\rangle \\\\right) = 0 :M\\\\left({\\\\downarrow}\\\\rangle \\\\otimes O_{\\\\uparrow}\\\\rangle \\\\right) = 0 :M\\\\left({\\\\downarrow}\\\\rangle \\\\otimes O_{\\\\downarrow}\\\\rangle \\\\right) = {\\\\downarrow}\\\\rangle \\\\otimes O_{\\\\downarrow}\\\\rangle with an eigenvalue of 1 meaning that O indeed accurately reflects the state of S. So there is a 0 probability of O reflecting the state of S as being {\\\\uparrow}\\\\rangle if it is in fact {\\\\downarrow}\\\\rangle, and so forth. The implication of this is that at time t_2, O' can predict with certainty that the S+O system is in some eigenstate of M, but cannot say which eigenstate it is in, unless O' itself interacts with the S+O system. An apparent paradox arises when one considers the comparison, between two observers, of the specific outcome of a measurement. In the problem of the observer observed section above, let us imagine that the two experiments want to compare results. It is obvious that if the observer O' has the full Hamiltonians of both S and O, he will be able to say with certainty that at time t_2, O has a determinate result for S's spin, but he will not be able to say what O's result is without interaction, and hence breaking the unitary evolution of the compound system (because he doesn't know his own Hamiltonian). The distinction between knowing \\"that\\" and knowing \\"what\\" is a common one in everyday life: everyone knows that the weather will be like something tomorrow, but no-one knows exactly what the weather will be like. But, let us imagine that O' measures the spin of S, and finds it to have spin down (and note that nothing in the analysis above precludes this from happening). What happens if he talks to O, and they compare the results of their experiments? O, it will be remembered, measured a spin up on the particle. This would appear to be paradoxical: the two observers, surely, will realise that they have disparate results. However, this apparent paradox only arises as a result of the question being framed incorrectly: as long as we presuppose an \\"absolute\\" or \\"true\\" state of the world, this would, indeed, present an insurmountable obstacle for the relational interpretation. However, in a fully relational context, there is no way in which the problem can even be coherently expressed. The consistency inherent in the quantum formalism, exemplified by the \\"M-operator\\" defined above, guarantees that there will be no contradictions between records. The interaction between O' and whatever he chooses to measure, be it the S+O compound system or O and S individually, will be a physical interaction, a quantum interaction, and so a complete description of it can only be given by a further observer O, who will have a similar \\"M-operator\\" guaranteeing coherency, and so on out. In other words, a situation such as that described above cannot violate any physical observation, as long as the physical content of quantum mechanics is taken to refer only to relations. =Relational networks= An interesting implication of RQM arises when we consider that interactions between material systems can only occur within the constraints prescribed by Special Relativity, namely within the intersections of the light cones of the systems: when they are spatiotemporally contiguous, in other words. Relativity tells us that objects have location only relative to other objects. By extension, a network of relations could be built up based on the properties of a set of systems, which determines which systems have properties relative to which others, and when (since properties are no longer well defined relative to a specific observer after unitary evolution breaks down for that observer). On the assumption that all interactions are local (which is backed up by the analysis of the EPR paradox presented below), one could say that the ideas of \\"state\\" and spatiotemporal contiguity are two sides of the same coin: spacetime location determines the possibility of interaction, but interactions determine spatiotemporal structure. The full extent of this relationship, however, has not yet fully been explored. =RQM and quantum cosmology= The universe is the sum total of everything in existence with any possibility of direct or indirect interaction with a local observer. A (physical) observer outside of the universe would require physically breaking of gauge invariance,Smolin (1995), pg. 13 and a concomitant alteration in the mathematical structure of gauge-invariance theory. Similarly, RQM conceptually forbids the possibility of an external observer. Since the assignment of a quantum state requires at least two \\"objects\\" (system and observer), which must both be physical systems, there is no meaning in speaking of the \\"state\\" of the entire universe. This is because this state would have to be ascribed to a correlation between the universe and some other physical observer, but this observer in turn would have to form part of the universe. As was discussed above, it is not possible for an object to contain a complete specification of itself. Following the idea of relational networks above, an RQM-oriented cosmology would have to account for the universe as a set of partial systems providing descriptions of one another. The exact nature of such a construction remains an open question. Relationship with other interpretations The only group of interpretations of quantum mechanics with which RQM is almost completely incompatible is that of hidden variables theories. RQM shares some deep similarities with other views, but differs from them all to the extent to which the other interpretations do not accord with the \\"relational world\\" put forward by RQM. =Copenhagen interpretation= RQM is, in essence, quite similar to the Copenhagen interpretation, but with an important difference. In the Copenhagen interpretation, the macroscopic world is assumed to be intrinsically classical in nature, and wave function collapse occurs when a quantum system interacts with macroscopic apparatus. In RQM, any interaction, be it micro or macroscopic, causes the linearity of Schr√∂dinger evolution to break down. RQM could recover a Copenhagen-like view of the world by assigning a privileged status (not dissimilar to a preferred frame in relativity) to the classical world. However, by doing this one would lose sight of the key features that RQM brings to our view of the quantum world. =Hidden variables theories= Bohm's interpretation of QM does not sit well with RQM. One of the explicit hypotheses in the construction of RQM is that quantum mechanics is a complete theory, that is it provides a full account of the world. Moreover, the Bohmian view seems to imply an underlying, \\"absolute\\" set of states of all systems, which is also ruled out as a consequence of RQM. We find a similar incompatibility between RQM and suggestions such as that of Penrose, which postulate that some process (in Penrose's case, gravitational effects) violate the linear evolution of the Schr√∂dinger equation for the system. =Relative- state formulation= The many-worlds family of interpretations (MWI) shares an important feature with RQM, that is, the relational nature of all value assignments (that is, properties). Everett, however, maintains that the universal wavefunction gives a complete description of the entire universe, while Rovelli argues that this is problematic, both because this description is not tied to a specific observer (and hence is \\"meaningless\\" in RQM), and because RQM maintains that there is no single, absolute description of the universe as a whole, but rather a net of inter-related partial descriptions. =Consistent histories approach= In the consistent histories approach to QM, instead of assigning probabilities to single values for a given system, the emphasis is given to sequences of values, in such a way as to exclude (as physically impossible) all value assignments which result in inconsistent probabilities being attributed to observed states of the system. This is done by means of ascribing values to \\"frameworks\\", and all values are hence framework-dependent. RQM accords perfectly well with this view. However, the consistent histories approach does not give a full description of the physical meaning of framework-dependent value (that is it does not account for how there can be \\"facts\\" if the value of any property depends on the framework chosen). By incorporating the relational view into this approach, the problem is solved: RQM provides the means by which the observer-independent, framework-dependent probabilities of various histories are reconciled with observer-dependent descriptions of the world. EPR and quantum non-locality singlet state toward two spacelike separated observers, Alice (left) and Bob (right), who can perform spin measurements. If Alice measures spin up on her electron, Bob will measure spin down on his, and vice versa. RQM provides an unusual solution to the EPR paradox. Indeed, it manages to dissolve the problem altogether, inasmuch as there is no superluminal transportation of information involved in a Bell test experiment: the principle of locality is preserved inviolate for all observers. =The problem= In the EPR thought experiment, a radioactive source produces two electrons in a singlet state, meaning that the sum of the spin on the two electrons is zero. These electrons are fired off at time t_1 towards two spacelike separated observers, Alice and Bob, who can perform spin measurements, which they do at time t_2. The fact that the two electrons are a singlet means that if Alice measures z-spin up on her electron, Bob will measure z-spin down on his, and vice versa: the correlation is perfect. If Alice measures z-axis spin, and Bob measures the orthogonal y-axis spin, however, the correlation will be zero. Intermediate angles give intermediate correlations in a way that, on careful analysis, proves inconsistent with the idea that each particle has a definite, independent probability of producing the observed measurements (the correlations violate Bell's inequality). This subtle dependence of one measurement on the other holds even when measurements are made simultaneously and a great distance apart, which gives the appearance of a superluminal communication taking place between the two electrons. Put simply, how can Bob's electron \\"know\\" what Alice measured on hers, so that it can adjust its own behavior accordingly? =Relational solution= In RQM, an interaction between a system and an observer is necessary for the system to have clearly defined properties relative to that observer. Since the two measurement events take place at spacelike separation, they do not lie in the intersection of Alice's and Bob's light cones. Indeed, there is no observer who can instantaneously measure both electrons' spin. The key to the RQM analysis is to remember that the results obtained on each \\"wing\\" of the experiment only become determinate for a given observer once that observer has interacted with the other observer involved. As far as Alice is concerned, the specific results obtained on Bob's wing of the experiment are indeterminate for her, although she will know that Bob has a definite result. In order to find out what result Bob has, she has to interact with him at some time t_3 in their future light cones, through ordinary classical information channels.Bitbol (1983) The question then becomes one of whether the expected correlations in results will appear: will the two particles behave in accordance with the laws of quantum mechanics? Let us denote by M_A(\\\\alpha) the idea that the observer A (Alice) measures the state of the system \\\\alpha (Alice's particle). So, at time t_2, Alice knows the value of M_A(\\\\alpha): the spin of her particle, relative to herself. But, since the particles are in a singlet state, she knows that :M_A(\\\\alpha)+M_A(\\\\beta)=0 , and so if she measures her particle's spin to be \\\\sigma, she can predict that Bob's particle (\\\\beta) will have spin -\\\\sigma. All this follows from standard quantum mechanics, and there is no \\"spooky action at a distance\\" yet. From the \\"coherence-operator\\" discussed above, Alice also knows that if at t_3 she measures Bob's particle and then measures Bob (that is asks him what result he got) ‚Äî or vice versa ‚Äî the results will be consistent: :M_A(B)=M_A(\\\\beta) Finally, if a third observer (Charles, say) comes along and measures Alice, Bob, and their respective particles, he will find that everyone still agrees, because his own \\"coherence-operator\\" demands that :M_C(A)=M_C(\\\\alpha) and M_C(B)=M_C(\\\\beta) while knowledge that the particles were in a singlet state tells him that :M_C(\\\\alpha)+M_C(\\\\beta) = 0. Thus the relational interpretation, by shedding the notion of an \\"absolute state\\" of the system, allows for an analysis of the EPR paradox which neither violates traditional locality constraints, nor implies superluminal information transfer, since we can assume that all observers are moving at comfortable sub-light velocities. And, most importantly, the results of every observer are in full accordance with those expected by conventional quantum mechanics. Derivation A promising feature of this interpretation is that RQM offers the possibility of being derived from a small number of axioms, or postulates based on experimental observations. Rovelli's derivation of RQM uses three fundamental postulates. However, it has been suggested that it may be possible to reformulate the third postulate into a weaker statement, or possibly even do away with it altogether.Rovelli (1996): pg. 14 The derivation of RQM parallels, to a large extent, quantum logic. The first two postulates are motivated entirely by experimental results, while the third postulate, although it accords perfectly with what we have discovered experimentally, is introduced as a means of recovering the full Hilbert space formalism of quantum mechanics from the other two postulates. The two empirical postulates are: *Postulate 1: there is a maximum amount of relevant information that may be obtained from a quantum system. *Postulate 2: it is always possible to obtain new information from a system. We let W\\\\left(S\\\\right) denote the set of all possible questions that may be \\"asked\\" of a quantum system, which we shall denote by Q_i, i \\\\in W. We may experimentally find certain relations between these questions: \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\land, \\\\lor, eg, \\\\supset, \\\\bot \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, corresponding to {intersection, orthogonal sum, orthogonal complement, inclusion, and orthogonality} respectively, where Q_1 \\\\bot Q_2 \\\\equiv Q_1 \\\\supset eg Q_2 . =Structure= From the first postulate, it follows that we may choose a subset Q_c^{(i)} of N mutually independent questions, where N is the number of bits contained in the maximum amount of information. We call such a question Q_c^{(i)} a complete question. The value of Q_c^{(i)} can be expressed as an N-tuple sequence of binary valued numerals, which has 2^N = k possible permutations of \\"0\\" and \\"1\\" values. There will also be more than one possible complete question. If we further assume that the relations \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\land, \\\\lor\\\\right\\\\\\\\} are defined for all Q_i, then W\\\\left(S\\\\right) is an orthomodular lattice, while all the possible unions of sets of complete questions form a Boolean algebra with the Q_c^{(i)} as atoms.Rovelli (1996): pg. 13 The second postulate governs the event of further questions being asked by an observer O_1 of a system S, when O_1 already has a full complement of information on the system (an answer to a complete question). We denote by p\\\\left(QQ_c^{(j)}\\\\right) the probability that a \\"yes\\" answer to a question Q will follow the complete question Q_c^{(j)}. If Q is independent of Q_c^{(j)}, then p=0.5, or it might be fully determined by Q_c^{(j)}, in which case p=1. There is also a range of intermediate possibilities, and this case is examined below. If the question that O_1 wants to ask the system is another complete question, Q_b^{(i)}, the probability p^{ij}=p\\\\left(Q_b^{(i)}Q_c^{(j)}\\\\right) of a \\"yes\\" answer has certain constraints upon it: :1. 0 \\\\leq p^{ij} \\\\leq 1, \\\\ :2. \\\\sum_{i} p^{ij} = 1, \\\\ :3. \\\\sum_{j} p^{ij} = 1. \\\\ The three constraints above are inspired by the most basic of properties of probabilities, and are satisfied if :p^{ij} = \\\\leftU^{ij}\\\\right^2, where U^{ij} is a unitary matrix. *Postulate 3 If b and c are two complete questions, then the unitary matrix U_{bc} associated with their probability described above satisfies the equality U_{cd} = U_{cb}U_{bd}, for all b, c and d. This third postulate implies that if we set a complete question Q^{(i)}_c \\\\rangle as a basis vector in a complex Hilbert space, we may then represent any other question Q^{(j)}_b \\\\rangle as a linear combination: :Q^{(j)}_b \\\\rangle = \\\\sum_i U^{ij}_{bc} Q^{(i)}_c \\\\rangle. And the conventional probability rule of quantum mechanics states that if two sets of basis vectors are in the relation above, then the probability p^{ij} is :p^{ij} = \\\\langle Q^{(i)}_c  Q^{(j)}_b \\\\rangle^2 = U_{bc}^{ij}^2. =Dynamics= The Heisenberg picture of time evolution accords most easily with RQM. Questions may be labelled by a time parameter t \\\\rightarrow Q(t), and are regarded as distinct if they are specified by the same operator but are performed at different times. Because time evolution is a symmetry in the theory (it forms a necessary part of the full formal derivation of the theory from the postulates), the set of all possible questions at time t_2 is isomorphic to the set of all possible questions at time t_1. It follows, by standard arguments in quantum logic, from the derivation above that the orthomodular lattice W(S) has the structure of the set of linear subspaces of a Hilbert space, with the relations between the questions corresponding to the relations between linear subspaces. It follows that there must be a unitary transformation U \\\\left( t_2 - t_1 \\\\right) that satisfies: :Q(t_2) = U \\\\left( t_2 - t_1 \\\\right) Q(t_1) U^{-1} \\\\left( t_2 - t_1 \\\\right) and :U \\\\left( t_2 - t_1 \\\\right) = \\\\exp({-i \\\\left(t_2 - t_1 \\\\right)H}) where H is the Hamiltonian, a self-adjoint operator on the Hilbert space and the unitary matrices are an abelian group.

Etchecolatz was deeply involved in the \\"anti-subversion operation\\" known as the National Reorganization Process (El proceso). He was first convicted in 1986 of crimes committed during this period, but passage that year of the Ley de Punto Final, which created amnesty for security officers, meant that he was released without a sentence. In 2003 Congress repealed the law, and the government re- opened prosecution of crimes during the Dirty War. In 2004, Etchecolatz was one of the first two officials convicted and sentenced for baby snatching: taking a child from \\"disappeared\\" parents, passing it on for adoption by officials of the regime, and hiding the child's true identity. He and Jorge Berges were each sentenced to seven years. He was also deemed responsible of the \\"Night of the Pencils\\", when 10 high-school students were abducted by security forces in the city of La Plata near Buenos Aires in September 1976. Six of the 10 were forcibly disappeared, with their fate remaining unknown. The four survivors said they were tortured. For his actions in the Provincial Police during El proceso, in 2006 he was tried, convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment, on numerous charges of homicide, illegal deprivation of freedom (kidnapping), and torture. The tribunal in passing the sentence said that Etchecolatz's crimes were \\"crimes against humanity in the context of the genocide that took place in Argentina\\".Klein, Naomi. The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism. Macmillan, 2007; , , pp. 100-102: \\"The presiding member of the court, Carlos Rozanski, described the offences as part of a systematic attack intended to destroy parts of society that the victims represented and as such they constituted genocide. Rozanski noted that the International Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (CPPCG) does not include in its list of offences the elimination of political groups (that category was removed at the behest of Stalin), but the court based its decision on the 11 December 1946 United Nations General Assembly Resolution, unanimously adopted by member-nations, barring acts of genocide 'when racial, religious, political and other groups have been destroyed, entirely or in part', adding that the court considered the original UN definition to be more legitimate than the politically compromised CPPCG definition.\\" This was the first time that the term \\"genocide\\" had been used to characterize the crimes committed against political prisoners during the \\"Dirty War. The term \\"Dirty War\\" refers to the widespread state terrorism and atrocities committed under the military dictatorship of Argentina during 1976 to 1983. A military junta was established, led by General Jorge Rafael Videla, after a coup d'√©tat against President Isabel Per√≥n. During the military rule, tens of thousands of political dissidents were killed or \\"forcibly disappeared\\". During the dictatorship Etchecolatz served as Commissioner General of Police, directly reporting to Police Chief Ram√≥n Camps. He served as Director of Investigations of the Buenos Aires provincial police from March 1976 until late 1977. During his period in office, Buenos Aires Province had the highest number of illegal detentions in the country. Etchecolatz was second in command during the Night of the Pencils, when several high school students were detained and tortured, and some murdered.Etchecolatz profile, Desaparecidos website (in Spanish) Return to democracy In 1983, democratic rule was restored in Argentina. The Trial of Juntas began in 1985, and numerous top figures were prosecuted, including General Ram√≥n Camps, who was convicted and sentenced to life. In a 1986 trial, Etchecolatz was convicted and sentenced to 23 years for several counts of illegal detention and forced disappearances. He was spared a prison sentence because that year Congress passed the \\"Full Stop Law\\" (Ley de Punto Final) and the \\"Law of Due Obedience\\", which halted prosecution of officers for crimes committed during the Dirty War. After his release, Etchecolatz wrote a book defending his actions, called La otra campa√±a del Nunca M√°s (The Other Never Again Campaign). The title referred to Nunca M√°s (Never Again), the report produced by the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons, which had heard testimony about the disappeared and survivors of state terror. Jorge and Marcelo Gristelli, owners of a Catholic publishing house, released the book in 1998 at the Buenos Aires International Book Fair.Their publishing house titles include Conversations with Mussolini and The dirty history of B'nai B'rith Anti-Defamation League In his book, Etchecolatz stated: \\"I never had, or thought to have, or was haunted by, any sense of blame. For having killed? I was the executor of a law made by man. I was the keeper of divine precepts. And I would do it again.\\" In 2001, the Gristellis were seen shielding Etchecolatz as he left court in Buenos Aires; they reportedly used violence against left-wing demonstrators who allegedly confronted and insulted the former police officer.\\"Hermanos de palos y libros\\" (\\"Brothers of sticks and books\\"), Clar√≠n, 10 April 2001 Etchecolatz also faced civil trials, which were outside the purview of the Pardon Laws (these had covered acts that were committed in the context of military or police procedure). In 2004, both he and Jorge Berges were convicted and sentenced to seven years in prison for the abduction of a \\"disappeared\\" couple's child, handing it on for illegal adoption, and the suppression of the child's true identity.\\"Argentines jailed for baby theft\\", BBC News, 30 March 2004 They were the first officials convicted for \\"baby snatching\\", but estimates are that 400 children were taken from political prisoners. Seventy-seven have had their identities restored to them. He was imprisoned in Villa Devoto in 2004 and 2005. He was later allowed to continue the sentence under house arrest due to his advanced age (over 70 years old at the time). Although Etchecolatz's lawyers claimed he had a terminal illness, after police found a firearm in his home in 2006 in violation of the terms of house arrest, he was transferred to the Marcos Paz prison. \\"El represor argentino Miguel Etchecolatz deber√° purgar una condena anterior en una c√°rcel com√∫n\\" (\\"Argentine repressor Miguel Etchecolatz must complete a previous conviction in ordinary prison\\"), El Pa√≠s, 24 June 2006 \\"Revocaron la prisi√≥n domiciliaria de Etchecolatz\\" (Revocation of house arrest for Etchecolatz), Terra The 2006 trial In 2003 Congress repealed the 1986 \\"Pardon Laws\\" (Ley de Punto Final), and re-opened investigation and prosecution of crimes committed during the Dirty War. Human rights activists said that potentially hundreds of people could be brought to trial. Etchecolatz was the first official of that era to be prosecuted. Beginning in June 2006, he was tried for human rights abuses, in a case that drew international attention. On 19 September 2006, he was found guilty of the detention and torture of Jorge L√≥pez and Nilda Eloy, and the homicides of Ambrosio Francisco De Marco, Patricia Graciela Dell'Orto, Diana Teruggi de Mariani, Elena Arce Sahores, Nora Livia Formiga and Margarita Delgado. In passing sentence, the tribunal said that Etchecolatz's crimes were \\"crimes against humanity in the context of the genocide that took place in Argentina\\". It was the first time that the term genocide was used in Argentine trials to characterize the crimes committed against political prisoners, and the court explained its reasoning.(See footnote quote in Lead) Together with Police Chief Ram√≥n Camps, Etchecolatz is believed to have operated at least eight clandestine detention centres in La Plata, Quilmes, Banfield, and Mart√≠nez. More than 100 witnesses were called, including former president Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n (1983‚Äì1989), under whose administration the Pardon Laws were passed in 1986.\\"Argentina holds 'Dirty War' Trial\\" BBC News, 21 June 2006\\"D√≠a de testimonios en los juicios contra Etchecolatz y 'El Turco' Juli√°n\\" (\\"Day of testimonies in the trials of Etchecolatz and 'The Turk' Julien\\") La Naci√≥n, 30 June 2006 (in Spanish) \\"Juicio a Etchecolatz: un camillero dijo que traslad√≥ cuerpos sin identificar al cementerio de La Plata\\" (\\"Etchecolatz trial: an orderly says unidentified bodies moved to the cemetery of La Plata\\") Clar√≠n, 15 July 2006 (in Spanish)\\"Condenaron a Etchecolatz a reclusi√≥n perpetua\\" (\\"Etchecolatz sentenced to life imprisonment\\"), La Naci√≥n, 19 September 2006 Etchecolatz criticized the procedures of the trial as biased and the judges as obedient to other powers. He said he was \\"an old man who is ill, with no money and no power\\", and \\"a part of a war that we [won] with the arms and that we're losing politically.\\" He refused to acknowledge the authority of the judges, telling them \\"You are not the judge. The supreme judge awaits us after death. [...] It's not this tribunal that sentences me, it's you.\\" The last thing he said before hearing the sentence was to claim he was \\"a prisoner of war\\" and \\"a political prisoner\\". =Political intimidation= Disappearance of Jorge Julio L√≥pez A graffito, addressed to Argentinian president N√©stor Kirchner, demanding that the national government find Jorge Julio L√≥pez alive. The letter K refers to Kirchner. Before Etchecolatz was sentenced, Jorge Julio L√≥pez, who was among those illegally detained and who testified in the trial, was reported as missing and feared \\"disappeared.\\" He was seen for the last time on 17 September 2006. The provincial government offered a 200,000 peso (US$ 64,000) reward for information on his whereabouts. L√≥pez, a 77-year-old retired mason with Parkinson's disease, was initially thought to have suffered post-traumatic stress disorder after re-living his ordeal during the trial, or chosen to hide after being threatened. But, after a few days, the theory that he had been kidnapped gained weight among the authorities. Buenos Aires Governor Felipe Sol√° stated that L√≥pez \\"could be the first desaparecido since the years of state terrorism\\", and that this could be intended \\"to intimidate future witnesses or block their participation in other trials\\". President N√©stor Kirchner warned \\"The past is not defeated... [But] we cannot go back to that past\\". Human and civil rights organizations allege that active and retired provincial police personnel took part in the kidnapping of L√≥pez, to intimidate other witnesses and impede future trials.\\"Esto no es una desaparici√≥n cualquiera\\" (\\"This is not just another disappearance\\") P√°gina/12, 26 September 2006 (in Spanish)Clar√≠n, 27 September 2006. Kirchner, sobre la desaparici√≥n de Jorge Julio L√≥pez: \\"El pasado no est√° ni derrotado ni vencido\\". On 6 October 2006, a demonstration of tens of thousands at the Plaza de Mayo, demanded L√≥pez be found.\\"Argentine missing-witness rally\\", BBC News, 7 October 2006\\"No tenemos miedo, queremos justicia\\" (\\"We are not afraid, we want justice\\"), P√°gina/12, 7 October 2006 (in Spanish)\\"Masivo reclamo por el testigo L√≥pez\\" (\\"Massive statement by witness L√≥pez\\"), La Naci√≥n, 7 October 2006 Suspicions about the cause of L√≥pez's disappearance were strengthened in 2014, when Etchecolatz and 14 others were convicted in a trial addressing crimes committed at the 'La Cacha' clandestine detention centre, the place where, among others, Laura Carlotto, the daughter of the head of the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, Estela de Carlotto, was held. As the judge handed down sentences, Etchecolatz took a piece of paper and wrote on it: \\"Jorge Julio L√≥pez.\\" The moment was captured by photographers and when the images were inspected, the other side of the piece of paper could also be read. It said the missing person's name, again, along with the addition of one other word: \\"Kidnap.\\" As of this day, Jorge Julio L√≥pez remains missing. Threats to judges On 27 September 2006, judge Carlos Rozanski, president of the court that sentenced Etchecolatz, confirmed he received a long letter that claimed the judges were being pressured by the national government and denounced those who \\"from the offices of power do not look for justice but for revenge against those who defended the Nation.\\" The letter was signed by the self-styled Third International Congress of Victims of Terrorism - Barcelona - Spain. The official Third International Congress of Terror Victims, held in Valencia, Spain, denied any involvement. The three trial judges also received threatening telephone calls. The same letter was received by Santa Fe federal judge Reinaldo Rodr√≠guez and by several federal prosecutors. The text was \\"well-written\\" and correctly addressed, and contained covert threats, pointing out that the senders \\"are bound, as citizens, to monitor that [judicial officials] fulfill their functions\\", and that \\"this farce will end soon, and those who have not honored their posts will be accountable to a particularly impartial court\\".\\"Amenazaron al presidente del tribunal que conden√≥ al represor Etchecolatz\\" (\\"They threatened the presiding judge who sentenced repressor Etchecolatz\\") Clar√≠n, 27 September 2006 (in Spanish)\\"Las amenazas llegaron a la Justicia\\" (\\"Threats come to Justice\\"), P√°gina/12, 28 September 2006 See alsoHistory of Argentina *Operation Condor *Night of the Pencils *Leopoldo Galtieri *Ram√≥n Camps *Jos√© L√≥pez Rega *Rodolfo Almir√≥n *State terrorism *National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons *Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo References and notes External linksTrial Watch profile *Coverage of the Etchecolatz trial, Human Rights Watch website Category:1929 births Category:Living people Category:Argentine police officers convicted of murder Category:Operatives of the Dirty War Category:Police officers convicted of crimes against humanity Category:Argentine people convicted of crimes against humanity Category:Argentine prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by Argentina Category:People convicted of murder by Argentina Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:People convicted of kidnapping ","title":"Miguel Etchecolatz"},{"id":"5974702","text":"Ariana is a feminine Persian name, popular in many languages. Arianna and Ariane are the two most common variations. Etymology The name Ariana has the several possible following origins. Ariana Ariana (Aryana), a term in classical history, from Latin Arianus, Ariana, from Greek Aria, Areia, names applied in classical times to the eastern part of ancient Persia and to its inhabitants. Ancient Persians used the name in reference to themselves (Old Persian ariya-), hence Iran. Ultimately from Sanskrit arya- \\"compatriot;\\" in later language \\"noble, of good family.\\", was a general geographical term used by some Greek and Roman authors of antiquity for an extensive territory in Central Asia, comprising the eastern part of the Persian empire, now all of Afghanistan and a part of Iran and southeast of Tajikistan.The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, 2008 The name of Iran (Persia) originates from the Old Persian word ariyanem (Ariana) meaning \\"[The Land of] the Aryans\\". The name Arianna is also the Latinized form of the name Ariadne (; ; \\"most holy\\", Cretan Greek Œ±œÅŒπ [ari] \\"most\\" and Œ±Œ¥ŒΩŒøœÇ [adnos] \\"holy\\"), the daughter of Minos, King of Crete,Homer, Odyssey 11.320, Hesiod, Theogony 947, and later authors. and his queen Pasipha√´, daughter of Helios, the Sun-titan,Pasipha√´ is mentioned as Ariadne's mother in Bibliotheke 3.1.2 (Pasipha√´, daughter of the Sun), in Apollonius' Argonautica iii.997, and in Hyginus Fabulae, 224. from Greek mythology.

Known for his eccentric training methods, he commanded the 2nd Battalion of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, which participated in the Malayan Campaign and the Battle of Singapore during the Second World War. Early life Stewart was born in 1895, part of the Stewart family of Appin in Argyllshire. His place of birth, in Surore, Poona, India, was where his father, Lt. Col Alexander Kenneth Stewart, 12th of Achnacone, was a medical officer in the Poona Horse before his parents returned to Scotland. Stewart attended Cheltenham College before going to Sandhurst on a prize cadetship. He passed through Sandhurst in 1913 as the top student of his year, and the youngest. First World War Stewart was commissioned into the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in February 1914 and on 11 August of that year became the first British soldier to land on French soil and the first to be mentioned in a dispatch. He served throughout the First World War and was highly decorated, earning the Military Cross and Bar, and was created an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. At the end of the war, Stewart was a temporary captain. He became heir to Achnacone after his older brother, Captain Alexander D.L. Stewart MC, died in a motorcycle accident in Dublin in 1919. As with many Army officers between the wars, Stewart was placed on half pay, but was restored to full pay as a captain on 3 June 1925Source London Gazette On 8 September 1931, Stewart was promoted to major. Stewart's military career was dominated by his service with the Argylls, a regiment to which he was so wedded that when he was given command of the 2nd Battalion in the 1930s some of his brother officers did not even realise that he was married with a daughter. Stewart had married Ursula Morely-Fletcher in 1937 when he was 42 years old. He even refused a position at the staff college at Camberley to remain with his battalion thereby losing the only way to senior command. Second World War At the outbreak of the Second World War Stewart was very happily still in command of the 2nd Battalion of the Argylls. Stewart was one of the few British officers to realise the need for training in jungle warfare that would be necessary in order to defeat the Japanese in a war in Malaya. Due to this obsession with jungle training Stewart earned himself a reputation as a crank amongst the more traditional minded officers of Malaya Command. In early 1941 after his battalion had been transferred from India to Malaya, Stewart began rigorously training his men and developing new tactics to fight in all of the extreme and hostile natural terrain of Malaya.Jeffreys and Anderson p.38 When the 2nd Argylls were thrown into the battle in early December 1941 they were to prove one of the few effective units the Japanese would face in their rapid advance down the peninsula, inflicting heavy casualties in every engagement. Sadly their effectiveness meant that they were continuously used as the buffer and suffered massive casualties as a result. Stewart was temporarily given command of the 12th Indian Infantry Brigade after Brigadier Paris took over the 11th Indian Infantry Division in late December 1941. He was in command of this brigade during the disastrous Battle of Slim River which was where the Argylls suffered their worst casualties. When the Battle of Malaya finally ended and the surviving Allied soldiers retreated across the causeway onto Singapore Island, Stewart and his batman, Drummer Hardy, were the last to cross. =Plymouth Argylls= Stewart was soon returned to his beloved Argylls in Singapore after they had been decimated in the fighting on the mainland. The 250 surviving Argylls were reformed with 210 Royal Marines, survivors from the sinking of and , becoming known as the Plymouth Argylls. Stewart had six days to train the new composite battalion before it was put into action on Singapore Island itself. The Plymouth Argylls suffered heavy casualties during the brief Battle of Singapore. Stewart was evacuated unwillingly from Singapore before its surrender due to the need for experienced officers and men who had proven ability to fight the Japanese Army successfully, an ability rare in the British Army at this time. By the time of the surrender on 15 February the Plymouth Argylls were reduced to 40 officers and men. What was left of the Plymouth Argyll Battalion, under the command of three captains, were marched into captivity behind their piper. According to some witnesses hundreds of other British Empire soldiers stood to attention as they marched past. Only 52 Argylls managed to escape before Singapore surrendered and make it to Ceylon. Many others were killed or captured when the ships they were escaping on were sunk by Japanese surface and air attack, like Major Angus MacDonald who died on the SS Rooseboom. =Later commands= On 23 January 1942, Stewart was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his services in the South West Pacific area source London Gazette He was initially employed as a General Staff Officer Grade 1 in India, lecturing on his experiences in Malaya. Officers with jungle warfare experience who had actually fought the Japanese and seen their tactics in action were in high demand by the army command in India. Of all the officers to have escaped from Singapore, Stewart was probably the most experienced. He became the Chief Instructor at the School of Infantry as a colonel, and later Brigadier General Staff (Training) with 11th Army Group in India. Of Stewart, Field Marshal Wavell wrote: Stewart's report, written after his arrival in India, and his knowledge along with that of the other officers and men who escaped from Singapore, had a direct effect on the training and tactics that would be used by the British and Commonwealth Armies in fighting the Japanese throughout the rest of the war. Stewart returned to the United Kingdom in early 1945, being given command of the 144th Infantry Brigade on 19 March 1945.Joslen Order of Battle He spent a period of time as the District Commander for Stirling, the home of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. Retirement Stewart retired from the army on 13 April 1947 at the age of 52, a short time after the death of his father. Stewart was a substantive colonel on retirement but was awarded the honorary rank of Brigadier. Stewart wrote the book 'The Thin Red Line, 2nd Argylls in Malaya' (Thomas Nelson, 1947) which was reprinted by the Argyll and Sutherland Regimental Museum. He became well known in the Scottish farming community, and even became President of the National Farmers Union of Scotland. Stewart died on 14 March 1987 at the age of 91. His funeral was well attended, with Major Eric Moss as the piper (Moss was Pipe Major of Stewart's 2nd Argylls in Malaya). The address was given by Lord Maclean of Duart.Daily Telegraph Magazine, 2 August 2014, 60.

Known in early life as Edward James Te Aika Tregerthen, he was the first Ratana Member of Parliament and was elected in a by-election for Southern Maori in June 1932 after the death of Tuiti Makitanara. He remained the MP until his death in 1967, when his daughter Whetu Tirikatene-Sullivan succeeded to the seat, also in a by- election. Early life Sir Eruera, Minister of Forests, with Lady Tirikatene, in October 1960, shortly after he was knighted. He is wearing the insignia of the Knight Commander of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George. After education at St Stephen's Anglican Church, Tirikatene worked on farms before enlisting in 1914 for the First World War. He served three years with the New Zealand MƒÅori (Pioneer) Battalion, reaching the rank of sergeant and commended for carrying a wounded soldier while under fire. In 1919, he was married to Ruti Matekino Solomon and the couple went on to have twelve children. In the same year, he settled on a small farm near Kaiapoi, where he also set up a dairy farm, a saw mill, a fishing fleet and a ferry service. By 1921 he visited Ratana pƒÅ, and T. W. Ratana, the spiritual leader or Te Mangai of Ratana predicted an important role for him. Te Mangai persuaded him to stay, and with his practical skills, served the movement by taking charge of harvesting of the Ratana lands. Election to Parliament As the Ratana movement developed into a political movement, Eruera Tirikatene became a leader in the internal political council and stood for parliament in the 1928 and 1931 elections, being defeated narrowly in both. In 1928 he and most of his extended family spent the election at Ratana Pa helping with the wheat harvest. At the time there were few provisions for absentee voting, and unable to even vote for himself, Tirikatene lost the election by one vote.Atkinson, Neill (2003), Adventures in Democracy: A History of the Vote in New Zealand, University of Otago Press, pp. 135‚Äì6. In June 1932, the sitting MP for Southern Maori, Tuiti Makitanara died suddenly and Eruera won the by-election to become the first Ratana MP. Tirikatene contained to represent his electorate until his death in January 1967. His initial majorities were small, only 43 in 1935. Member of Parliament From his maiden speech, Tirikatene made recognition of the Treaty of Waitangi one of his major aims, presenting a petition with over 30,000 signatures. The petition from the Ratana morehu was held over for thirteen years before being virtually ignored, but Tirikatane continued to raise the Treaty issue in debates. During the depression of that time, MƒÅori were expected to subsist from their land, and were not given equal access to unemployment payments and relief work. Proving entitlement to the old age pension was also more difficult for MƒÅori, as MƒÅori did not have to register births until 1919. Tirikatene spoke out against this discrimination in social welfare which caused poverty to MƒÅori and the removal of this inequality by the Labour Government strengthened the Labour and Ratana bond. Following the Ratana-Labour alliance, Tirikatene became the First President of the Labour Party MƒÅori Advisory Council, a committee to set MƒÅori policy for the party. During the Second World War, Tirikatene set up and led the MƒÅori War Effort Organisation. The experience of MƒÅori running their own affairs led him to introduce the MƒÅori Social and Economic Advancement Act of 1945, but it did not give the independence for iwi he had hoped for. Between 1946 and 1949, Tirikatene was involved in land claim settlements for Waikato‚ÄîManiapoto and Taranaki. He persuaded the NgƒÅi Tahu to accept the Ngaitahu Claim Settlement Act of 1944 and became president of the Ngaitahu Trust Board. After a period in opposition, he was appointed Minister of Forests, and Minister in charge of Printing and Stationery. Tirikatene was expecting MƒÅori Affairs, which was taken by Prime Minister Walter Nash. The two often clashed, with Tirikatene wanting greater autonomy for MƒÅori. One achievement of this period was the official recognition of Waitangi Day through the Waitangi Day Act 1960, commemorating the signing of Te Tiriti o Waitangi. Tirikatene continued committee work while in opposition after 1960, and remained an MP until his death. He was succeeded in the seat by his daughter, Whetu Tirikatene- Sullivan.  Recognition  In 1935, Tirikatene was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in the 1960 Queen's Birthday Honours. Within the Ratana movement, he was known as Te Omeka.

In the last years he worked behind the scenes of the music industry, where he realised numerous major projects like Andr√© Heller's 3 CD compendium \\"Ruf und Echo\\", the two triple platinum CDs of Christina St√ºrmer, the major label debut of Hans Platzgumer; he worked with Brian Eno, Stefan Sagmeister, Xavier Naidoo and many more. ‚ÄûThe Pink Beast Of Love‚Äú is his debut album, which has been released on 7 October 2005 on Buntspecht/Hoanzl in Austria and which was internationally especially well acclaimed. It took its name from a statement by American cult and bestseller author Tom Robbins.

Career =Cheyennene wars= Johnson was originally from Boydton, Virginia. In 1866, he enlisted in the Army at Detroit, Michigan as an original member of F Troop of the 10th Cavalry. He fought with the 10th against the Cheyenne on the Republican River. Johnson joined D Troop of the 9th Cavalry in June 1877, where the troop was stationed at Fort Wallace. The troop was patrolling southern Colorado at the time of the Meeker Massacre. =Meeker Massacre and the Utes= On September 29, 1879, a group of Ute warriors, led by Chief Colorow ambushed a group of around 175 soldiers and militiamen from Fort Steele near Milk Creek. At the same time, the Utes also killed the Indian agent and his white employees at the Ute reservation nearby. The troops near the creek created a perimeter around their wagons with dead animals while their remaining animals were picked off by the Utes. Captain Francis Dodge, Sergeant Johnson, and D Troop arrived on October 2, 1879 and were able to enter the encampment without being shot at. For the next three days, D Troop's animals were picked off, leaving only four wounded horses. Johnson was charged with the responsibility of securing the outposts for the defense for the encampment, and under heavy fire from the Utes, made the rounds to meet with his men. On October 5, five troops from the 5th Cavalry arrived shortly after the Ute attackers dispersed. Johnson was awarded the Medal of Honor at Fort Robinson on September 22, 1890, for his actions during the Battle of Milk Creek against the Ute Indians from October 2‚Äì5, 1879 in Colorado. His Medal of Honor citation reads: At the time of the awarding, he was a private. He had been promoted to sergeant for the third time in 1889, but was demoted after tangling with a bartender at Fort Robinson. Johnson was a sergeant in Company D. He was cited for twice leaving his position under heavy fire, first to check on his men, then, on October 4, going to the nearby Milk River to obtain water for them. However, some have questioned whether he was under fire when he went for water. =Apache wars= Shortly after the 5th Cavalry arrived on October 5, 1879, Johnson and D Troop of the 9th Cavalry headed to New Mexico and spent the next two years fighting the Apaches in Victorio's War. He was discharged in January 1883 at Fort Riley. Johnson reenlisted two months later with the 10th Cavalry and was stationed at Fort Grant to once again fight the Apaches. After this five year enlistment ended in 1888, he rejoined the 9th Cavalry in K Troop. =Later career and death= K Troop patrolled the Pine Ridge Sioux Reservation for four months in the winter of 1890‚Äì1891 before it was moved to Fort Myer in Virginia. K Troop returned to Fort Robinson in 1893. Johnson's final five-year enlistment with K Troop ended in 1898, before the troop was sent to Cuba for the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. He retired that same year to Washington, D.C.. Johnson died on January 31, 1904, and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington, Virginia, in section 23, lot 16547.

Education and early career Wilde attended Wirral Grammar School before going to the University of Westminster in 1973 where he obtained a first degree in Urban Estate Management before going on to do his Masters in Town and Regional Planning at Sheffield University. He later went on to work in estate agency, planning consultancy and in local government with Sheffield City Council, before going to Singapore in 1978. He is a Fellow of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and became a Member of the Royal Town Planning Institute in 1981. He has authored many papers on housing issues and was a Senior Lecturer in Real Estate Economics and Town Planning at the National University of Singapore from 1978 to 1983. During his time in Singapore he also acted as an advisor to the Government's Housing Development Board and Urban Redevelopment Authority becoming a Member of both the Singapore Institute of Planners and the Singapore Institute of Surveyors and Valuers. Southampton F.C. He moved to Hampshire in 1985 upon his return from Singapore and became a major sponsor of a number of Southampton players including Kevin Davies, Dan Petrescu and Graeme Le Saux before acquiring a 10% stake in the club from existing Director Paul Thompson, the former West Bromwich Albion Chairman in February 2006. He went on to purchase further shares over the following months soon becoming the club's largest individual shareholder. His first period as chairman was from 30 June 2006 to February 2007, gaining his position following pressure on Rupert Lowe to resign, the club's previouschairman of ten years. Shortly after his arrival as chairman, the club's Director of Football, Sir Clive Woodward left by mutual agreement as the club went about trying to restructure its finances. A number of new players were brought into a depleted squad including Rudi Skacel, Kelvin Davis, Jermaine Wright, Bradley Wright-Phillips, and I√±igo Idiakez, but despite the Saints being in a play-off position in the Championship under Manager, George Burley, Wilde resigned, reportedly due to a lack of promised investment from outside investors.Southampton chairman Wilde quits post. ESPN Soccernet. 26 February 2007. During his tenure Wilde also signed Academy player Gareth Bale to his first professional contract, who quickly became a first team regular. Bale was eventually sold to Tottenham Hotspur in a package potentially worth ¬£10m to the Club. Bale has since (2013) been transferred to Real Madrid for a world record fee of 100 million EUROS. Following a long period of boardroom upheaval in the Club after Wilde's initial departure, and after narrowly avoiding relegation to League One, Wilde and his earlier rival, Rupert Lowe, finally demanded an EGM to remove chairman Leon Crouch and on 15 May 2008, Crouch and three other directors resigned from the board. Wilde resumed his position as chairman of the football club whilst Lowe became chairman of the holding company, Southampton Leisure Holdings Plc. Upon becoming chairman again, Jan Poortvliet, who represented the Netherlands in the Final of the 1978 FIFA World Cup in Argentina, was appointed Head Coach to work with what was a very young squad for the 2008/9 season. Whilst showing promise the team struggled to remain consistent in the Championship, and when the Club were deducted 10 points as a result of its holding company going into administration, relegation to League One became inevitable. Wilde has been based in Jersey since February 2006 and in March 2007 he became the main sponsor of the Jersey Football Association (JFA) and played a significant part in bringing the Jersey F.A. International Small Nations Tournament to the island in November 2008. Other business career Whilst in Singapore, Wilde founded Contact Communication Services in 1983, a telecommunications company specialising in high-speed data communications and offering low-cost telex relay services throughout South-East Asia. The company quickly expanded through the establishment of operational offices in Hong Kong, East and West Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Australia. Wilde eventually exited the company through a sale to European Telecommunication giants, the Great Northern Telegraph Company of Copenhagen in 1988. Upon returning to the UK, Wilde founded Merlion Housing Association in 1990, a specialist provider of privately funded affordable housing. He created and developed a shared equity model for the provision of Housing Association Grant free affordable housing and has been instrumental in this form of tenure becoming a key tool of affordable housing policy in the United Kingdom. The Association has provided homes to nearly 2,000 individuals and families in housing need since its incorporation and was the only privately funded Housing Association to receive funds under the Government's ¬£200 million Starter Homes Initiative in 2001 aimed at providing key worker homes for, amongst others, teachers, nurses and the police. Following the success of Merlion, Wilde went on to form a house building company, Infinity Homes Ltd, in partnership with its Chief Executive, Alistair Baker and in 2006 the company won the prestigious \\"Best Small Housebuilder\\" Gold Award in the Daily Telegraph sponsored What House? Awards, often referred to as the Oscars of the house building industry. Wilde acted as Non-Executive Chairman of the company until it ceased trading in 2008 due to the economic downturn. The holding company of Infinity Homes Ltd was, as a result, wound up in June 2011. Merlion Housing Association, however, continues to provide affordable housing to low income families, working closely with many Local Authorities throughout the United Kingdom Wilde also co-founded Wildcard Films Ltd in April 2009 and was its chairman until February 2011. He was executive producer of the company's critically acclaimed short film \\"Roar\\", starring Russell Tovey and Jodie Whittaker, which has won awards at several major international festivals, including the Grand Jury Prize for Best Screenplay at the Rhode Island International Film Festival, and Winner for Best Cinematography at the Aspen Shortsfest. Although retaining strong links to the North-West, Wilde acquired Cardington House, a landmark property in Saint Aubin, Jersey in 2006 and after an extensive refurbishment programme opened it as a luxury boutique hotel. In early 2014, Wilde was linked to a possible takeover of Tranmere Rovers Football Club but later withdrew following a period of due diligence.

A cultural icon is an artifact that is identified by members of a culture as representative of that culture. The process of identification is subjective, and \\"icons\\" are judged by the extent to which they can be seen as an authentic proxy of that culture. When individuals perceive a cultural icon, they relate it to their general perceptions of the cultural identity represented. Cultural icons can also be identified as an authentic representation of the practices of one culture by another. In the media, many items and persons of popular culture have been called \\"iconic\\" despite their lack of durability, and the term \\"pop icon\\" is often now used synonymously. Some commentators believe that the word is overused or misused. The values, norms and ideals represented by a cultural icon vary both among people who subscribe to it, and more widely among other people who may interpret cultural icons as symbolising quite different values. Thus an apple pie is a cultural icon of the United States', but its significance varies among Americans. National icons can become targets for those opposing or criticising a regime, for example, crowds destroying statues of Vladimir Lenin in Eastern Europe after the Revolutions of 1989 or burning the American flag to protest American actions abroad. Religious icons can also become cultural icons in societies where religion and culture are deeply entwined, such as representations of the Madonna in societies with a strong Catholic tradition. Examples A red telephone box is a British cultural icon A web-based survey was set up in 2006 allowing the public to nominate their ideas for national icons of England, and the results reflect the range of different types of icons associated with an English view of English culture. One example is the red AEC Routemaster London double decker bus;British Postal Museum & Archive: Icons of England . Retrieved 15 December 2012.Culture24: Icons of England. Retrieved 15 December 2012. Matryoshka dolls are seen internationally as cultural icons of Russia. In the former Soviet Union, the hammer and sickle symbol and statues of Vladimir Lenin instead represented the country's most prominent cultural icons. The values, norms and ideals represented by a cultural icon vary both among people who subscribe to it, and more widely among other people who may interpret cultural icons as symbolising quite different values. Thus an apple pie is a cultural icon of the United States, but its significance varies among Americans. National icons can become targets for those opposing or criticising a regime, for example, crowds destroying statues of Lenin in Eastern Europe after the fall of communism or burning the American flag to protest US actions abroad. Criticism Describing something as iconic or as an icon has become very common in the popular media. This has drawn criticism from some. For example, a writer in Liverpool Daily Post calls \\"iconic\\" \\"a word that makes my flesh creep\\", a word \\"pressed into service to describe almost anything.\\"Let's hear it for the Queen's English, Liverpool Daily Post Mark Larson of the Christian Examiner labeled \\"iconic\\" as an overused word, finding over 18,000 uses of \\"iconic\\" in news stories alone, with another 30,000 for \\"icon\\".Modern word usage amazingly leaves us yearning for gay, old times , Christian Examiner See also:Category:Lists of cultural icons * List of cultural icons of England * List of cultural icons of France * List of cultural icons of Germany * List of cultural icons of Italy * List of cultural icons of the Netherlands * List of cultural icons of Northern Ireland * List of cultural icons of Russia * List of cultural icons of Scotland * List of cultural icons of Spain * List of cultural icons of Wales * Pop icon * Horror icon  References  Bibliography     * External links Our New Icons by The Daily Telegraph * Nothing and no one are Off Limits in an Age of Iconomania by The Age * British Postal Museum & Archive: Icons of England * Culture24: Icons of England Category:Cultural history ","title":"Cultural icon"},{"id":"5974853","text":"Palacio Municipal may refer to:  Places  = City government headquarters = Palacio Municipal de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires in Argentina * Palacio Municipal de Caracas in Venezuela * Palacio Municipal (Castell√≥n) in Spain * Palacio Municipal in Chihuahua Palacio Municipal in San Miguel de Cozumel, Cozumel, Mexico * Palacio Municipal in San Miguel de Cozumel, Cozumel Municipality, Mexico * Palacio Municipal de Guadalajara in Mexico * Palacio Municipal de Guayaquil in Ecuador * Palacio Municipal de Jun√≠n in Argentina * Palacio Municipal de La Plata in Argentina * Palacio Municipal de Lima in Peru * Palacio Municipal (Montevideo) in Uruguay * Palacio Municipal de Naucalpan in Mexico * Palacio Municipal (Plasencia) in Spain * Palacio Municipal de Puebla in Mexico * Palacio Municipal de Tijuana in Mexico * Palacio Municipal de M√©rida in Mexico = Municipal congress centers = Palacio Municipal de Congresos de Madrid in Madrid, Spain = Municipal sport installations = Palacio Municipal de Deportes de Granada in Granada, Spain * Palacio de los Deportes de Le√≥n in Le√≥n, Spain ","title":"Palacio Municipal"},{"id":"5974863","text":"Interior of the arena.

The acquisition of modernist paintings, even Impressionist works, by public galleries was invariably a source of controversy. In Quebec, Paul-√âmile Borduas and Jean-Paul Riopelle spearheaded the modernist collective known as Les Automatistes, which began having exhibitions as early as 1941. However, their artistic influence was not quickly felt in English Canada, or indeed much beyond Montreal.Norwell, Iris. (2011), Painters Eleven:The Wild Ones of Canadian Art, Publishers Group West, Formation In 1953, eleven abstract painters from Ontario  Jack Bush, Oscar Cah√©n, Hortense Gordon, Tom Hodgson, Alexandra Luke, Jock Macdonald, Ray Mead, Kazuo Nakamura, William Ronald, Harold Town and Walter Yarwood  dubbed themselves Painters Eleven and held their first exhibition at Roberts Gallery in Toronto in 1954. The exhibition, arranged by Jack Bush, was the first major commercial exhibition of abstract expressionist art in Toronto. Unlike the Group of Seven whose members' work evolved along parallel lines, Painters Eleven shared no common artistic vision apart from a commitment to abstraction. This was reflected in the diversity of the group's members. Decades separated the youngest from the eldest, and before they sold their paintings they made their living as freelance commercial artists or worked in advertising and as art teachers. Two had studied at summer schools conducted by the American abstract expressionist Hans Hofmann and William Ronald \\"sat in\\" on his classes, while others were graduates of the Ontario College of Art, and still others were self-taught. Within the group itself, the artistic center of gravity seems to have been Oscar Cah√©n, a gifted European √©migr√© who became well known as an illustrator for a number of national magazines. In Canada's conservative art world their first exhibition was met with confusion and disdain, typical of new art movements throughout history. By their third exhibition, in 1957, they had established abstract expressionism in Canada. Painters Eleven attained U.S. exposure with a successful exhibition in 1956 with the American Abstract Artists at the Riverside Museum in New York City, and were praised by the influential critic Clement Greenberg on a visit he paid to the group in Toronto in 1957. In the Canadian press, the group's most ardent supporters were art critic Robert Fulford and [art writer] Pearl McCarthy of the Globe and Mail. Eventually, the group's numbers were reduced by death and defection (Cah√©n was killed in a car accident in 1956, Ronald resigned in 1957) and the group formally disbanded in 1960. Influence Painters Eleven are credited with making English Canada's art-buying public more accustomed to abstract expressionist painting. Their influence on the next generation of Canadian artists was immense, and their art is now a prominent feature in public galleries and corporate and private collections throughout Canada and in many international collections. The largest collection of their works can be found at The Robert McLaughlin Gallery in Oshawa, Ontario.http://www.rmg.on.ca/painters-eleven.php Some of the group's members, notably Jack Bush, William Ronald and Harold Town, went on to greater success in the 1960s and 1970s. Jack Bush was given a major exhibition at the Art Gallery of Ontario in 1976, Harold Town in 1986 and Kazuo Nakamura in 2004. Works by the group's members are now fetching higher prices at Canadian fine art auctions. The last surviving member of the group, Tom Hodgson, a former Olympic canoeist and a dedicated abstract expressionist, died in 2006.

Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant (also known as Benjamin Constant), born Jean-Joseph Constant (10 June 1845 ‚Äì 26 May 1902), was a French painter and etcher best known for his Oriental subjects and portraits. Biography Benjamin-Constant was born in Paris. He studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Toulouse, where he was a pupil of Alexandre Cabanel. A journey to Morocco in 1872 strongly influenced his early artistic development and lead him to produce Romantic scenes under the spell of Orientalism. Among his noted works in this vein are Last Rebels, Justice in the Harem (both in the Luxembourg Gallery), Les Ch√©rifas, and Moroccan Prisoners (Bordeaux). His large canvas, The Entrance of Mahomet II into Constantinople (Mus√©e des Augustins Toulouse), received a medal in 1876. Frances Benjamin Johnston, Benjamin Constant, , Library of Congress After 1880, he changed his manner, devoting himself to mural decorations and to portraits. Prominent examples include the great plafond in the H√¥tel de Ville, Paris, entitled Paris Convening the World; his paintings in the New Sorbonne, representing Literature, The Sciences, and the Academy of Paris; and the plafond of the Op√©ra Comique theatre. He was distinguished as a portrait painter, especially in England, where he was a favorite of the aristocracy. His portrait Mons fils Andr√© (Luxembourg) was awarded a medal of honor at the Salon in 1896. Benjamin-Constant painted Pope Leo XIII, Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom (1901), Lord John Lumley-Savile, and Henri Blowitz (1902). He was made a member of the institute in 1893, and was a commander of the Legion of Honor. He visited the United States several times, and painted a number of portraits. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York exhibited a large painting by Benjamin-Constant entitled Justinian in Council. The painting was returned by the Metropolitan to the owners family in 1928. It was purchased by John Ringling in 1929 and is currently on exhibit in the Ringling Museum in Sarasota Benjamin-Constant also taught; among his pupils was the miniaturist Alice Beckington and the Scottish artist W.

It is under the auspices of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia and spiritual direction of Archbishop Stylianos of Australia and is the largest Greek Orthodox church in Adelaide. This is partly due to the high population of Greek Australians in the area, mostly from Thebarton, Torrensville and Mile End. __TOC__ Greeks of North-East West Torrens The church is located at the centre of the three suburbs, that are densely populated by Greek- Australians Throughout the 1950s the area became home to a large number of Greek migrants, and by 1966 they formed 13.4 per cent of the population in Thebarton. The \\"Greek Orthodox Community and Parish of Saint George Thebarton and Western Suburbs Inc.\\" was formed in 1960 to help the expatriate Greeks, and in 1965 the members of that community built St. George's church. Today, the suburbs of Torrensville and Thebarton have a significant Greek Australian population, with 4,471 Greek Australians living in the area, that is 18.7 per cent of the total population, according to census data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 2001. Church Services Sunday services begin at 8:00 a.m. and end at approximately 11:00 a.m. Weekday services are held on major feast days between 8:00 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. Holy Week Services are especially solemn and are the highlight of the Orthodox Church calendar. The Good Friday evening service, which is officiated by the Assistant Bishop to Archbishop Nikandros of Dorylaeon, includes an anticlockwise procession on the streets with an epitaph being carried from the church at approximately 9:30 p.m. Police accompany the clergy and crowd for the entire procession, and close down the southbound lanes of South Road while the crowds walk behind the clergy and the epitaph. On Holy Saturday evening, the midnight office begins at 11:00 p.m. At midnight the priest lights the trikeri (three candles) and invites the people to \\"Come, receive the Light from the light that is never overtaken by night\\". The people rush to be first to receive the flame in order to pass it on until the entire crowd (inside and outside) have their candles lit from the holy flame. This is followed by the priest going outside on to a temporary stage to read the Paschal gospel and the traditional Paschal hymn \\"ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑœåœÇ ŒëŒΩŒ≠œÉœÑŒ∑\\". The Paschal Sunday service continues until approximately 2:30 a.m. School services are held four times a year, where all students and teachers from St. George College attend a liturgy for communion. As the number of students at the college exceed the seated capacity of the church, the school now holds separate liturgies for the school. One for the primary students and one for the high-school students. Publications The Community and Parish publishes a quarterly magazine, \\"St. George Community News\\". Attendance Sunday morning service attendance is approximately 300 - 500, which is the approximate capacity of the church. Celebrations such as the feast day of St. George usually have over 1000 people attending, and the outdoor sound system is turned on for the benefit of the hundreds outside.

The school was founded in 1846 by the Sisters of Mercy, thus making it the oldest independent Catholic girls' school in Australia, and the oldest existing secondary school in Perth. There are currently 800 students from Year 7 to Year 12. The current principal is Kerrie Fraser. The name Mercedes comes from the Spanish word for mercy.  History  The school has its beginnings in the landing at the Swan River Colony of Irish Sisters of Mercy. Led by Sister Ursula Frayne, they founded the first Catholic school in the colony on 2 February 1846 beginning their teaching with just one pupil. Classes were conducted in a rented St Georges Terrace cottage, near Victoria Avenue. By the end of the first day's teaching, the numbers had swelled to six students. Enrolment grew to 100 by the end of 1846, by which time the school had moved to permanent accommodation at Victoria Square. The first Mercy Convent in Australia was constructed in 1847 on the Victoria Square site, and remains in use today, known as \\"Holy Cross Convent\\". Two separate schools were run from the Victoria Square site. The original was known as St Joseph's School, and was a free, co-educational school. The other school run from the site was Ladies' College, opened in 1896, which did charge for tuition. It was later renamed Our Lady's College. The two schools amalgamated in 1967 to form Mercedes College. The last of the school's boarding students left in 1981. Over the years, the number of Sisters of Mercy at the site has dwindled, with the last Mercy Sister Principal of Mercedes, Sister Assisium Wright, retiring in 1996.

It was notified as an SSSI in 1988. Site description Yanal Bog is a calcicolous lowland mire. Underlying the site are gravels and clay alluvium. Above this sits a layer of peat. This results in a high water table, creating a distinct domed landscape feature. Biological interest The plant communities of the mire are nationally rare in Britain, and support two species, Black Bog-rush (Schoenus nigricans) and Blunt- flowered Rush (Juncus subnodulosus), that have restricted distributions in south-west England, and a number of species that are localised in the Avon area. Surrounding the raised mire is a belt of grassland; although this is included within the SSSI, it is largely made up of common grass and herb species. In the community in the western part of the mire, Blunt-flowered Rush, Purple Moor-grass (Molinia caerulea) and Carnation Sedge (Carex panicea) are abundant species, and this part of the mire is characterised by the presence of a number of species that favour base-rich conditions. Black Bog- rush is locally abundant along a wet drainage ditch in this western part of the site. In the eastern part of the mire Purple Moor-grass and Blunt-flowered Rush are again abundant, but the abundant sedge species are Lesser Pond-sedge (Carex acutiformis) and Greater Pond-sedge (Carex riparia). Common Reed (Phragmites australis) and Marsh Horsetail (Equisetum palustre) are also frequent. This part of the site supports plant species associated with more neutral conditions. The site has a species-rich flora; species that occur here but are localised or confined to specialised habitats in Avon are Flea Sedge (Carex pulicaris), Saw-wort (Serratula tinctoria), Meadow Thistle (Cirsium dissectum), Marsh Valerian (Valeriana dioica), Dyer‚Äôs Greenweed (Genista tinctoria), Marsh Arrowgrass (Triglochin palustris), Southern Marsh-orchid (Dactylorhiza praetermissa), Fen Bedstraw (Galium uliginosum), Devil‚Äôs-bit Scabious (Succisa pratensis) and Tawny Sedge (Carex hostiana) and Tufted-sedge (Carex elata).

In Italian he is called l‚Äôomino con i baffi - \\"the mustachioed little man\\". The mascot is a caricature of Alfonso's son, Renato Bialetti by Illustrator Paolo \\"Paul\\" Campani. Alfonso Bialetti () (17 June 1888‚Äì 4 March 1970) was an Italian engineer who became famous for the invention of the Moka Express coffeemaker. Designed in 1933, the coffee pot has been a style icon since the 1950s. While many variations of the Moka have been developed, including the Bialetti cow-printed Mukka Express (which makes cappuccino), the Moka Express is a time-honoured classic. Bialetti was also the founder of Bialetti Industries, the now giant Italian kitchen-ware company. The Bialetti Company Bialetti first acquired his metal-working skills by working for a decade in the French aluminium industry.Schnapp, Jeffrey T. \\"The Romance of Caffeine and Aluminum\\" Critical Inquiry, Vol. 28, No. 1, 2001. Retrieved on 2005-10-27.

The Moka Express =Design= Components of a Bialetti Moka Express (Made in Italy) pot. Bialetti completed his design for the aluminium Moka Express in 1933. It may also be referred to as a Moka, Moka pot, a Bialetti, a percolator or a stove-top coffeemaker, and in Italian as la Moka, la macchinetta (\\"the little machine\\") or la caffettiera.\\"About Coffee\\" Ara Azzurro, 2007. Retrieved on 2008-08-28 The blueprints for the Moka Express are on display in the London Design Museum . Bialetti was probably heavily influenced by contemporary designers such as Hoffmann, Puiforcat, Genazzi and Henin; to a certain extent he copied and built upon their coffee-pot designs. The coffee pot‚Äôs clean classic design with its symmetrical eight-faceted metallic body is easily recognisable‚Äîit followed the same design for over 70 years (unusual in a world of constantly changing products). Since its creation the Moka has become the world‚Äôs most famous coffee pot and has been cited in the Guinness Book of World Records as well as in various essential design books. The Bialetti design has also provided an inspiration for modern designers; Julian Lwin, a New York designer, paid homage to the Moka Express with his own \\"Dr. Octagon Espresso\\" set of table and chairs. The use of aluminium to construct the body of the coffee pot was also a relatively new industrial concept as aluminium was not a traditional \\"domestic metal\\". Soon the material was to become more common in kitchens and the mid-1930s are considered to be the golden era in the production of aluminium products for the kitchen. The coming together of coffee and aluminum may have been inevitable, however, it was the Bialetti design together with the use of the novel metal which made the coffee-pot something rather special. =Development and marketing= The Moka was eventually to transform the Bialetti company into a leading Italian coffee-machine designer and manufacturer. Between 1934 and 1940 the humble Moka was only marketed locally - sold by Alfonso at the weekly markets in Piedmont. In these six years he only produced 70,000 units. By 2001 a total of 220 million units had been produced and to date the number has reached 330 million. During World War II the rising prices of coffee and aluminium stalled production of the Bialetti products. It was not until Renato, Alfonso‚Äôs son, took over in 1946 that the Bialetti product line was narrowed down to a single product: the Moka Express. A huge multi-faceted marketing campaign was initiated by Renato. It incorporated television, billboards which saturated the streets of Milan and even the creation of a giant statue of the Moka Express coffee pot. Copy-cat designs were infiltrating the market by now and advertising turned out to be a key strategy in defining the success of the Moka and ensuring the popularity of the Bialetti brand. L'omino con i baffi ‚Äì the Moka mascot ‚Äì was based on a humorous cartoon doodle of Alfonso Bialetti's son Renato. The initial sketches and logo were created in 1953 by Paul Campani. By 1956 the Bialetti company had managed to construct a state-of-the-art factory in Omegna. =Social impact= Espresso machines prior to the Moka Express were large, expensive, and technically complicated. Few people kept them at home, so coffee-drinking was largely a public affair. The Moka Express, which was comparatively small, cheap, and easy to use, made it feasible for many more people to brew espresso at home. Over the rest of the 20th century, it gradually displaced other home coffee makers invented in the late 19th century, such as the Napoletana and the Milanese. =Mechanics of coffee percolation= Aromatic compounds and other flavour compounds are extracted from coffee grains by the Moka using a process known as percolation. In order to percolate or brew the coffee the percolator is placed on a stove element and heated until pressure in the water compartment increases causing the water to rise through a funnel, through the coffee grains, through a filter and, finally, into the top compartment. According to the Bialetti corporate lore the mechanical design for the Moka was inspired by the primitive washing-machines used by housewives: linens were boiled in tubes built around a central conduit that drew the boiling soapy water up through it and redistributed it across the linen through a radial opening.

(Accessed April 1, 2007) History Bukit Jelutong is located on a former oil palm plantation, the Bukit Jelutong Estate, which was owned by Kumpulan Guthrie Berhad. The development of Bukit Jelutong began in 1996, with the construction of the Guthrie Pavilion building, the present headquarters of GPHB.Kumpulan Guthrie Berhad Corporate History webpage . (Accessed April 1, 2007) Since then, Bukit Jelutong has emerged as a much sought-after address in Shah Alam, with consistently well-received sales launches and price levels of real estate approaching those in more established areas in the Klang Valley, e.g. Petaling Jaya and Subang Jaya. In July 2005, the Guthrie Corridor Expressway connecting Bukit Jelutong to Rawang opened. Infrastructure and amenities = Transportation= Bukit Jelutong is well-served by an excellent road network. The suburb is linked to Kuala Lumpur, Petaling Jaya, Shah Alam, Klang and other population centers in the Klang Valley by the North Klang Valley Expressway (NKVE), the Guthrie Corridor Expressway (GCE), the Federal Highway and the North‚ÄìSouth Expressway Central Link (ELITE). The expressways also link Bukit Jelutong to the Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport, Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) and Port Klang. Closest railway stations are KTM Shah Alam and KTM Batu Tiga. =Commercial= Bukit Jelutong has a small commercial center where sundry businesses are located. GPHB had intentionally avoided developing large-scale commercial areas to avoid traffic congestion and noise to maintain the suburb's atmosphere of serenity and exclusivity.

These include the Kelab Golf Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah, the Glenmarie Golf & Country Club, the Monterez Golf & Country Club, and the Saujana Golf & Country Club. The Shah Alam Stadium is also only a 5-minute drive away from Bukit Jelutong. Community = Community Participation= The Bukit Jelutong community has proven to be a close community judging from its regular events. The main yearly event is the Bukit Jelutong Carnival held annually. The Carnival is organised by the Bukit Jelutong Residents Association. Currently, most of the areas in Bukit Jelutong are gated and guarded through supports from the community itself. =Bukit Jelutong Residents Association= Registered in 2002, Bukit Jelutong Residents Association is very active. Regular events benefiting the residents are held regularly. Driven entirely by volunteers who are residents of Bukit Jelutong, the association is known for its close rapport with the local authorities.

Steffen started out as an amateur with Cantonal Neuch√¢tel and later became the first Swiss footballer to play in England when he signed for Chelsea. He had only journeyed to England to learn the language, having been sent by his parents in preparation for him joining the family's fruit and vegetable business, but his teacher turned out to be the wife of then-Chelsea manager, Billy Birrell. He was given a trial and signed for the club in July 1946. Steffen was a cultured and dedicated full back, tall and pacy, who quickly became a crowd favourite at Chelsea, while his blonde hair and good looks also won him admirers. He made his debut in a 3‚Äì1 loss against Derby County and played 20 league and cup games for Chelsea during the 1946-47 season, including a memorable FA Cup win over Arsenal at Highbury, during which he expertly marked winger Ian McPherson. Steffen returned to Switzerland at the end of the season to finish his national service and was made club captain in his final game for Chelsea, also against Derby. Upon his return to Switzerland he re-joined Cantonal before moving to Young Boys Bern in 1950. With them, he won the Swiss Super League four years in succession from 1957-60 as well as the Schweizer Cup in 1953 and 1958. A former fighter pilot, Steffen played for Switzerland at the 1950 FIFA World Cup, though they went out in the group stages. He also played in a 1‚Äì0 win over an England side containing Stanley Matthews, Tommy Lawton and Billy Wright in Zurich in 1947. He won 28 international caps for his country.

He was born in Shoreham, Sussex, and was the son of bank clerk Frederick Arthur Faulkner and his wife Matilda Elizabeth Faulkner (n√©e Wheeler). In 1912 he took up a position in the British Civil Service, but his employment was interrupted by World War I, when he entered the armed forces. After a brief period of service, he was invalided out and rejoined the Civil Service in 1916. Faulkner developed an interest in Egyptology, and in 1918 he took to studying Egyptian hieroglyphs in his spare time at University College London under the tutelage of Margaret Murray. In 1926 he became the full-time assistant to Dr Alan Gardiner, from whom he received philological training and encouragement to publish his works on hieroglyphic texts. He was the editor of the Journal of Egyptian Archaeology from 1946‚Äì59, and wrote many books, articles, and reviews. In 1950 he was admitted as a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. In 1951 Faulkner became an assistant in language teaching at University College London, progressing to become a lecturer in Egyptian language ‚Äì a post he held from 1954 to 1967. He received his Doctor of Letters degree from the University of London in 1960. Faulkner's main area of interest was Egyptian philology, and he made major contributions to Egyptology with his translations and indexes of many important ancient Egyptian texts, as well as his autographic dictionary of Middle Egyptian (which remains an important and standard reference for modern Egyptologists and students of the ancient Egyptian language).

The diocesan territory covers a land area of 61,266 square kilometers. Philip Lasap Za Hawng (1945- ) is the current Bishop of Lashio (from 1998). History The mission territory of the Northern Shan State was first evangelized around 1869 by MEP Fathers, then directing the Apostolic vicariate of Northern Burma. At a later phase in 1930, the PIME Italian Fathers took over and much expansion was made both east and west of the Salween River. A two-pronged mission drive was made at that early stage from the two Prefectures of Lashio and Kengtong. Under the aegis of the Italian Missionaries, who were joined by a group of zealous diocesan priests, much headway was made. From the very start, a tough little group of Italian Reparation sisters worked alongside the priests. They helped open schools, boarding houses, nurseries and clinics. Nationalization The nationalization of all mission and also private schools was a terrible blow. The Church lost all of her schools overnight. However, it was also a blessing in disguise. The Religious now turned to direct mission apostolate. The Holy See entrusted Lashio to the Salesians in 1975, making it a Prefecture. Monsignor Jocelyn Madden, the Salesian Delegate, was the first Apostolic Prefect. On his early retirement, another Salesian, Monsignor Charles Bo, succeeded him. More development end further expansion took place. In 1989, twin celebrations were held: the golden jubilee of the start of the mission and the reopening of the Wa State Mission (the extensive area east of the Salween River). Creation of bishopric In recognition of the work of the Salesians, the Vatican moved fast. On Dec. 16, 1990, Monsignor Charles Bo was appointed the first bishop of the newly created Diocese of Lashio. A further landmark was made in 1991, when the new Catechist Training Center was inaugurated in Lashiogyi. Under the able guidance of the De La Salle Brothers, a two-year special course is given to catechists from all dioceses. In the span of some 20 years, the diocese has ordained new diocesan priests. Bishop Bo also founded a Missionary Congregation of Brothers and Sisters of St. Paul. Its special charism is direct evangelization ad gentes. It started with a few teenage boys and girls in 1990 and is now a flourishing congregation of 49 professed Religious. It is spread out in 13 houses, 10 in Lashio, 2 in Pathein diocese, and 1 in Pyay diocese. Then, Bishop Bo was appointed Bishop of Pathein on May 24, 1996. Bishop Philip Lasap Za Hawng was installed as the new Bishop of Lashio diocese on Oct. 4, 1998. On the same solemn occasion, two diocesan priests were ordained for Lashio by Bishop Bo, former prelate of Lashio. Bishop Za Hawng continued to promote the newly founded Missionary Congregation of Brothers and Sisters of St. Paul. However, in 2000, the brothers decided to move to Pathein where the founder could give close attention to their formation. The sisters remained in the Diocese of Lashio and continue to grow in numbers. Now, there are 70 professed sisters who are in 16 houses‚Äî11 in the home diocese of Lashio, three in Pathein, one in Pyay, and one in the Diocese of Myitkyina. In June 2005, the Novitiate of St. Paul Sisters from Lashio started their mission in the Archdiocese of Yangon, according to the wish of the Archbishop of Yangon, the founder of the Association of the Missionary Sisters of St. Paul.

The band has had many line-up changes during their history, and almost 20 different musicians play or have played with the band. Y√∂'s first line-up included singer Olli Lindholm and composer, singer and keyboardist Jussi Hakulinen, guitarist Jani Viitanen, bassist Juha Rau√§ng and drummer Harri Varhala. Since the late 1980s band has been more or less based in Tampere. Y√∂'s biggest hits include songs like Joutsenlaulu (Swansong), Likaiset legendat (Dirty Legends), Ihmisen poika (Son of a Human), Rakkaus on lumivalkoinen (Love is Snow-White), S√§rkynyt enkeli (Broken Angel), and Tia-Maria (a Finnish woman's name). The group started with punk rock influenced music but has later moved towards mainstream rock. Y√∂ is Finland's 10th best-selling music artist of all time with two multi-platinum, two double-platinum, six platinum and five gold records. After singer and bands leader Olli Lindholm's sudden death in February 2019 it is very much doubtful whether the band will continue playing.

Gidwitz (July 16, 1906 ‚Äì July 11, 2006) was a co-founder of the cosmetics and salon parlour firm Helene Curtis Industries. Early life Gidwitz was born in Memphis, Tennessee. His father was a cotton farmer and general store owner in Mississippi. When Gidwitz was 12 years old, his family moved to Chicago, Illinois, where his father started a business that made paper boxes. Helene Curtis After graduating from the University of Chicago in 1927, Gidwitz worked at National Minerals Company with his brother, Willard. The Gidwitzes father had acquired the troubled beauty products company in settlement of a debt National Minerals owed the Gidwitz box company. National Minerals' main product was a clay for beauty facials. Gerald and Willard Gidwitz helped refocus the company's product line toward beauty parlor supplies, including permanent wave solutions and hair dryers. In the late 1940s the company began marketing home beauty products, including shampoos and hair sprays. The company's first consumer product was a hair cream marketed under the Suave label. National Minerals was renamed Helene Curtis Industries in 1956, when the company went public. Willard Gidwitz ran day-to-day operations, while Gerald Gidwitz focused on acquisitions and creating other companies. Gerald served as chairman of the company from 1952 to 1996, when it was bought by Unilever. Gidwitz also founded or acquired companies in other economic sectors. In the 1980s he launched a company providing building supplies, Continental Materials Corporation. He also bought two companies that manufactured farm equipment. Political life In the 1950s Gidwitz founded the anti-communist Education for Survival Foundation, which had the aim of making \\"every school district in the nation aware of the grim fact that we are engaged in a battle of the classroom with Russia.\\" During the Cold War, Gidwitz supported groups that assisted defectors from Soviet bloc countries. In 1962, he launched a monthly \\"Cold War digest\\" that provided information on military, political and technological aspects of the Cold War. Gidwitz served on the board of Roosevelt University. Gidwitz funded literacy programs through Roosevelt University and worked with the National Planning Association, which creates programs to improve education and promote literacy. During the 1940s, he set up after-hours classes for workers at Helene Curtis. In 2002, Gidwitz gave a grant to National-Louis University to create the Gidwitz Center for Urban Planning and Community Development. He died on July 11, 2006 of congestive heart failure, five days shy of his 100th birthday. References Fornek, Scott. (2006, July 12). Built Helene Curtis into $1 bil. business.

Prior to 1819, the island was known by several names; an early reference may be in the 2nd century work by Ptolemy which identified a coastal port at the southernmost tip of the Malayan peninsula, called Sabana. However, historians generally attribute a 3rd-century Chinese traveller's record describing an island at the same location called Pu Luo Chung, a transcription of Singapura's early Malay name Pulau Ujong, as the first recording of its existence. Singapore was known in the 13th to 14th century as Temasek, a name also recorded in Chinese sources as Dan Ma Xi, a country recorded as having two distinct settlements ‚Äì Long Ya Men and Ban Zu. It changed its name to Singapura perhaps towards the end of 14th century. The island was alternately claimed by the Siamese and the Javanese in the 14th century. The last ruler of Singapura Parameswara fled to Malacca after an attack by either the Javanese or Siamese, and established the state of Malacca. It was controlled by Sultanate of Malacca in the 15th century and the Sultanate of Johor from the 16th century.  Early period  Golden Khersonese. The first possible mention of early Singapore dates to 2nd century CE cartographic references in the Greco-Roman astronomer Ptolemy's Geographia. A place called Sabana or Sabara was marked on the 11th Map of Asia at the southern tip of the Golden Khersonese (meaning the Malay Peninsula) where Singapore may lie. It was identified as a nominon emporion or designated foreign trading port, as part of a chain of similar trading centres that linked Southeast Asia with India and the Mediterranean. Identification of Sabana or Sabara however varies, with various authors proposing it to be in Selangor or near Klang, or just south of Malacca, or south Johor, as well as Singapore island itself. No archaeological evidence from this period has yet been found in Singapore. A fragment of the Singapore Stone, inscribed with an unknown script, c 10th to 13th century. A 3rd century Chinese written record described the island of Pu Luo Chung (Ëí≤ÁæÖ‰∏≠), probably a transcription of the Malay Pulau Ujong, \\"island at the end\\" (of the Malay peninsula). It mentions briefly a hearsay account of cannibals with 5 or 6 inch tails living there. =Singapore Stone= A large boulder measuring 3 metres in height and width, inscribed with writings, used to exist at the mouth of the Singapore River, but was later blown up when Fort Fullerton was expanded and the river mouth widened. Only a few fragments survive, and it became known as the Singapore Stone. Various dates between 10th to 13th century have been proposed for the inscriptions that is as yet undeciphered, and the script is suggested to be related to that used in Sumatran in that period. Temasek Mao Kun map from Wubei Zhi based on the early 15th century navigation maps of Zheng He, showing Temasek (Ê∑°È¶¨Èå´) at the top left, and Longyamen (ÈæçÁâôÈñÄ) in the right panel. Temasek was described as having two different settlements by Wang Dayuan, Longyamen and Banzu. Early Singapore was called \\"Temasek\\", possibly a word deriving from \\"tasik\\" (Malay for lake or sea) and taken to mean Sea-town in Malay. The Nagarakretagama, a Javanese epic poem written in 1365, listed a settlement on the island called Tumasik as a vassal of the Majapahit. The name is also mentioned in the Malay Annals thought to have been written in 1535. Temasek may have diplomatic relationship with Vietnam, which recorded it as Sach Ma Tich, as early as the 13th century. It is also recorded by the Chinese traveller Wang Dayuan who visited the island around 1330 and described a place called Dan Ma Xi (ÂñÆÈ¶¨Èå´, a transcription of the Malay Temasek). The name Dan Ma Xi or Temasek is written in Chinese as Ê∑°È¶¨Èå´ in the Mao Kun map. = Long Ya Men and Ban Zu = It was recorded in 1320 that the Mongol sent a mission to obtain elephants from Long Ya Men (ÈæçÁâôÈñÄ, Dragon's Teeth Gate). The people of Longyamen then responded in 1325 with a tribute and trade mission to China. Long Ya Men is believed to be the entrance to Keppel Harbour. In his work Daoyi Zhil√ºe, Wang Dayuan described Long Ya Men as the two hills of Temasek that looked like \\"Dragon's teeth\\" between which a strait runs, and wrote about the place: Jewelry found at Fort Canning Hill, which was named Banzu by Wang Dayuan Wang further mentioned that lakawood and tin was produced there and the natives traded with Chinese from Quanzhou, but Chinese junks on their way back from the Western Oceans (Ë•øÊ¥ã) may be met by pirates there who attacked with two to three hundred perahus (boats). Wang described another settlement on a hill behind Long Ya Men called Ban Zu (Áè≠Âçí, a transcription of the Malay name pancur meaning a \\"spring\\"). It is thought to be located on Fort Canning Hill, and a spring used to exist on the west side of the hill. In contrast to those of Long Ya Men who were prone to piracy, the inhabitants of Ban Zu were described as honest, and they wore \\"their hair short, with turban of gold-brocaded satin,\\" and were dressed in red cloth. Wang also reported that the Siamese attacked Temasek a few years before he visited, but the fortified city survived the attack which lasted a month. Ruins of the settlement on the hill were still visible in the early 19th century and were described by the Resident John Crawfurd. In 1928, pieces of gold ornaments dating to the mid-14th century was discovered at Fort Canning Hill. Recent excavations in Fort Canning provide evidence that Singapore was a port of some importance in the 14th century and used for transactions between Malays and Chinese. Various documents suggest that following the decline of Srivijaya power, Temasek was alternately claimed by the Majapahit and the Siamese Ayutthaya Kingdom. Singapura Sometime in its history, the name of Temasek was changed to Singapura. The Sejarah Melayu (Malay Annals) contains a tale of a prince of Srivijaya, Sri Tri Buana (also known as Sang Nila Utama), who landed on Temasek after surviving a storm in the 13th century. According to the tale, the prince saw a strange creature, which he was told was a lion; believing this to be an auspicious sign, he decided to found a settlement called Singapura, which means \\"Lion City\\" in Sanskrit. It is unlikely there ever were lions in Singapore, though tigers continued to roam the island until the early 20th century. However, the lion motif is common in Hindu mythology, which was dominant in the region during that period (one of the words for \\"throne\\" in the Malay language is \\"singgasana\\", meaning \\"lion's seat\\" in Sanskrit), and it has been speculated that the \\"Singapura\\" name, and the tale of the lion, were invented by court historians of the Malacca Sultanate to glorify Sang Nila Utama and his line of descent. Different versions of its history are told in Portuguese sources, suggesting that Temasek was a Siamese vassal whose ruler was killed by Parameswara from Palembang. Historians believe that during the late 14th century, Parameswara, the last Srivijayan prince, fled to Temasek from Palembang after being deposed by the Majapahit Empire. According to Portuguese accounts, Parameswara killed the local chief with the title Sang Aji eight days after being welcomed into Temasek. Map of Singapura by Malay-Portuguese cartographer Manuel Godinho de Er√©dia dated 1604. Not withstanding the Sejarah Melayu legend, the \\"Singapura\\" name possibly dates to this period. Some argued that Singapura was named after the \\"lion throne\\" Parameswara established in Palembang as a challenge to the Majapahit empire, and for which he was expelled from Palembang. Parameswara held the island of Singapore for a number of years, until further attacks from either the Majapahit or the Ayutthaya kingdom in Siam forced him to move on to Melaka where he founded the Sultanate of Malacca. While there are parallels between the mythical Sang Nila Utama and the historical Parameswara, these should be seen as distinct. Singapore as part of sultanate of Malacca Archaeological evidence suggests that the main settlement on Fort Canning was abandoned around this time, although a small trading settlement continued in Singapore for some time afterwards. Singapore became part of the Malacca empire, and it was said to be the fiefdom of the legendary laksamana (or admiral) Hang Tuah. However, by the time the Portuguese arrived in the early 16th century, the Singapura that existed before Malacca was founded had already become \\"great ruins\\" according to the conqueror of Malacca Afonso de Albuquerque. Beginning of colonial rule  During the 16th and early 17th century, it briefly regained some significance as a trading centre of the Sultanate of Johor. In 1613, Portuguese raiders burnt down the settlement at the mouth of the Singapore River and the island sank into obscurity. It was not until 1819, when Englishman Sir Stamford Raffles established a British trading post on the island, that modern Singapore was founded.

Mid-West Regional Authority Regional Authorities in Ireland were established by the Local Government Act 1991 and came into existence in 1994. Under this Act, the Regional Authorities had two main functions: to promote the co-ordination of public service provision and to monitor the delivery of European Union Structural Fund assistance in the regions. The Regional Authorities were dissolved in 2014 and were replaced by Regional Assemblies. Membership The members of the Regional Authorities were not directly elected, but were nominated from among the elected members of the local authorities in the region. Each local authority had a certain number of seats on a Regional Authority, based loosely on the population of the local authority area. The size of the Regional Authorities varied from 21 members in the Mid-East region to 37 members in the Border region. Structures To assist the Regional Authority in undertaking its functions, each has an Operational Committee and an EU Operational Committee. The Operational Committee is chaired by the Cathaoirleach (Chairperson) of the Regional Authority and is composed of senior management from the constituent local authorities and other relevant public sector agencies operating in the region. It helps prepare the work of the Regional Authority and assists and advises it on matters relating to its functions. Also, each Regional Authority has a designated city/county manager (chief executive of a local authority) from one of its local authorities to further enhance the linkages between the local authorities and the Regional Authority. The EU Operational Committee has a similar, but broader, composition and assists the Regional Authority in matters relating to EU assistance and reviewing the implementation of various EU Operational Programmes in a region. Each Regional Authority has a Director, assisted by a number of policy and administrative staff. They are NUTS III level. The Regional Authorities had specific responsibility for: *Reviewing the Development Plans of local authorities in their region and in adjoining regions; *Preparing Regional Planning Guidelines and Regional Economic and Social Strategies; *Promoting cooperation, joint actions, arrangements and consultation among local authorities and other public bodies.

G. Andrews, 'Ledger, Charles (1818 - 1905)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 5, MUP, 1974, pp 73-74. Retrieved 9 Sep 2009 was an alpaca farmer noted for his work in connection with quinine, a treatment for malaria. Background Ledger belonged to a huguenot family that emigrated to England in the 18th century; he was born at 1 Bucklersbury, City of London, the son of George Ledger, a mercantile broker, and his wife Charlotte, n√©e Warren. After leaving school he went to Peru and in 1836 was a clerk in a British merchant's office at Lima. It was at Lima that Charles rescued a drowning native Manuel Incra Manami, who offered to become his servant. Alpaca Career He became an expert in alpaca wool, and in 1842 began business as a dealer in South American products. In 1847 he was grazing sheep and cattle half-way between Tacna and La Paz, and in 1852 went to Sydney to inquire into the possibility of introducing the alpaca into Australia. He returned to South America and by 1859 had brought several hundred alpacas to Sydney. This was a hazardous and difficult business as the export of alpacas was forbidden. Ledger was paid ¬£15,000 for his alpacas and given a position in charge of them. The attempt to acclimatize alpacas in Australia ended in failure, but Ledger was not at fault. Quinine production Ledger returned to South America in 1864 and turned his attention to another problem. The cinchona tree, the bark of which yields quinine, grew in Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia, but the export of either trees or seeds was prohibited. The trees were being wastefully cut down without being replaced, and there was some danger that they might become extinct. Some seeds and plants had been introduced into Europe and Asia by Hugh Algernon Weddell in 1848, and Sir Clements Markham went later to Peru, and Bolivia, and succeeded in acclimatizing trees in Asia and the Dutch East Indies. Ledger, however, found a better variety for producing quinine, now known as Cinchona ledgeriana, and in 1865 under great difficulties collected several pounds of seed and sent them to his brother George Ledger in London. For his share in this work Ledger's servant, Manuel, was arrested in Bolivia and so severely beaten that he died. The seed was sent to London where some of it was purchased by the Dutch government. Seeds were also sent to India and Queensland but the trees do not appear to have been grown in Australia. In 1883 Ledger went to Sydney again and in 1884 took a farm 20 miles (30 km) from Goulburn, New South Wales. Retirement and death Losing his savings in the bank failures of the early 1890s, efforts were made by Sir Clements Markham and others to obtain some provision for Ledger from the Indian and Dutch governments. Initially this was refused, but in 1897 on Ledger's 79th birthday, he received news that the Dutch government had granted him an annuity of ¬£100 a year. He died eight years later in 1905 at 'Mimosa Cottage', Elswick St, Leichhardt, Sydney. He is buried in Rookwood Cemetery, Sydney. Impact Ledger did a great service to the world, as millions of cinchona trees grown in India and Java sprang originally from the seeds he collected. By 1900 two-thirds of the world's supply of quinine came from Java, and over 40 years later the Ledger types of cinchona were still the best quinine yielders.Harper's Magazine, August 1943, p. 278 ReferencesPart of Ledger's own account of his life can be found at p.118, Chemist and Druggist, 27 July 1895, which is available as a searchable archive. *Some of Ledger's papers are available at the State Library of NSW: ML MSS.630 * Further readingR.

A survivor of the Battle of Rabaul, he was killed in action leading the 39th Battalion during the Kokoda Track campaign. Early life Owen was born on 27 May 1905, in Nagambie, Victoria. He worked as a bank officer in civilian life and served as a militia officer in the years prior to the outbreak of the Second World War.Wigmore 1957, p. 401. Military career Owen enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 8 July 1940, with the service number VX45223. He was posted to the 2/22nd Infantry Battalion, with the rank of major, in command of 'A' Company.Downs 1999, p. 58. =Battle of Rabaul= The 2/22nd Infantry Battalion was sent to the town of Rabaul, on the island of New Britain, in early 1941. This was the closest Australian base to the Japanese, and considered unlikely to be successfully defended. In late January 1942, the 1,400-strong Rabaul (Australian) garrison was quickly overwhelmed by the Japanese. Owen's 'A' Company was positioned at Vulcan beach, and bore the brunt of the main Japanese landing. After fighting for several hours, Owen ordered his men to break contact, as they would otherwise have been cut off.Wigmore 1957, pp. 401‚Äì406. With the remainder of the Australian garrison, Owen and his men escaped from Rabaul. They faced a harrowing battle for survival in the mountains and along the southern coast. More than 150 men were massacred after being taken prisoner around Tol and Waitavalo plantations, up to 100 others died of illnesses, and about 800 surrendered and were taken back to Rabaul by the Japanese. Owen was one of only 400 to get off New Britain.Downs 1999, pp. 103‚Äì110Sinclair 1990, p. 123. He arrived in Port Moresby and after a period of recuperation in Australia was promoted to lieutenant colonel and assumed command of the 39th Battalion on 7 July 1942.Brune 1991, p. 19. =Kokoda Track Campaign= The 39th Battalion was preparing for deployment to the mountain village of Kokoda, as the first step in an Allied plan to occupy the north coast of Papua. The first troops departed the day after Owen assumed command. After the Japanese landed on the north coast on 21 July, Owen was flown up to Kokoda, from where 'B' Company was already engaging the enemy.Brune 2004, p. 100. Facing overwhelming odds, the Australians were pushed back. Owen ordered the burning of the supply dump at Kokoda and a retreat to Deniki.Brune 2004, p. 101. After realising the Japanese had not occupied Kokoda, he led his men back into the village in an attempt to reopen its airfield to receive reinforcements and supplies. The aircraft dispatched to Kokoda were not able to land. The Japanese started attacking in force on the evening of 28 July.Brune 2004, pp. 102-103. Owen was mortally wounded at 0300 hrs on the morning of 29 July 1942, as the Japanese stepped up their attacks on the dug-in Australians. He was shot just above the right eye while in his forward weapon pit. Taken back to a hut that was being used as an aid post, he was examined by the medical officer, Captain Geoffrey 'Doc' Vernon. His situation was deemed hopeless and when the Australians were forced to withdraw from their location at 0430 hrs, Owen could not be moved. He was cleaned up and left as comfortable as possible.Austin 1988, pp. 97-98.

History  One of the first modern fictional discussions of ethnic weapons is in Robert A. Heinlein's 1942 novel Sixth Column (republished as The Day After Tomorrow), in which a race-specific radiation weapon is used against a so-called \\"Pan-Asian\\" invader. = Genetic weapons = In 1997, U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen referred to the concept of an ethnic bioweapon as a possible risk. In 1998 some biological weapon experts considered such a \\"genetic weapon\\" plausible, and believed the former Soviet Union had undertaken some research on the influence of various substances on human genes.Interview of Dr Christopher Davis, UK Defence Intelligence Staff, Plague War, Frontline, PBS, October 1998 In its 2000 policy paper Rebuilding America's Defenses, think-tank Project for the New American Century (PNAC) described ethnic bioweapons as a \\"politically useful tool\\" that US adversaries could have incentive to develop and utilize. The possibility of a \\"genetic bomb\\" is presented in Vincent Sarich's and Frank Miele's book, Race: The Reality of Human Differences, published in 2004. These authors view such weapons as technically feasible but not very likely to be used. (page 248 of paperback edition.) In 2004, The Guardian reported that the British Medical Association (BMA) considered bioweapons designed to target certain ethnic groups as a possibility, and highlighted problems that advances in science for such things as \\"treatment to Alzheimer's and other debilitating diseases could also be used for malign purposes\\". In 2005, the official view of the International Committee of the Red Cross was \\"The potential to target a particular ethnic group with a biological agent is probably not far off. These scenarios are not the product of the ICRC's imagination but have either occurred or been identified by countless independent and governmental experts.\\"Preventing the use of biological and chemical weapons: 80 years on, Official Statement by Jacques Forster, vice-president of the ICRC, 10-06-2005 In 2008, the US government held a congressional committee, ‚ÄòGenetics and other human modification technologies: sensible international regulation or a new kind of arms race?‚Äô, during which it was discussed how ‚Äúwe can anticipate a world where rogue (and even not-so-rogue) states and non-state actors attempt to manipulate human genetics in ways that will horrify us‚Äù. In 2012, The Atlantic wrote that a specific virus that targets individuals with a specific DNA sequence is within possibility in the near future. The magazine put forward a hypothetical scenario of a virus which caused mild flu to the general population but deadly symptoms to the President of the United States. They cite advances in personalized gene therapy as evidence. In 2016, Foreign Policy magazine suggested the possibility of a virus used as an ethnic bioweapon that could sterilize a \\"genetically-related ethnic population.\\"  Israeli \\"ethno-bomb\\" controversy  In November 1998, The Sunday Times reported that Israel was attempting to build an \\"ethno-bomb\\" containing a biological agent that could specifically target genetic traits present amongst Arab populations. Wired News also reported the story, as did Foreign Report. Microbiologists and geneticists were skeptical towards the scientific plausibility of such a biological agent. The New York Post, describing the claims as \\"blood libel\\", reported that the likely source for the story was a work of science fiction by Israeli academic Doron Stanitsky. Stanitsky had sent his completely fictional work about such a weapon to Israeli newspapers two years before. The article also noted the views of genetic researchers who claimed the idea as \\"wholly fantastical\\", with others claiming that the weapon was theoretically possible. Russian ban on export of biological samples In May 2007, a Russian newspaper Kommersant reported that the Russian government banned all exports of human biosamples. The report claims that the reason for the ban was a secret FSB report about on-going development of \\"genetic bioweapons\\" targeting Russian population by Western institutions. The report mentions the Harvard School of Public Health, American International Health Alliance, Department of Medical Biotechnology of Jagiellonian University, United States Department of Justice Environment and Natural Resources Division, Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology Warsaw University, and United States Agency for International Development.

In Arma 3, \\"Atrox Strain\\" is an engineered variant of Malaria developed by the Canton Protocol Strategic Alliance Treaty that is used to target specific genotypes for the purposes of expanding soft power into affected countries via medical assistance. In the Joe Ledger Series by Jonathan Maberry, the second novel, The Dragon Factory, deals with ethnic bioweapons. The antagonists in the novel, led by Cyrus Jakoby, use advanced transgenic science to make communicable versions of genetic disorders that predominately affect specific ethnic populations, such as Tay-Sachs disease and Sickle-cell Anemia, with the goal of committing mass genocides, a project they refer to as the \\"Extinction Wave.\\" See also Biological warfare * Genographic Project, genetic anthropology study; intention is to study migration. * International HapMap Project * Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, a video game which features an ethnic bioweapon targeting languages instead of genes. * Pharmacogenomics * Prayer of the Rollerboys * Project Coast * Race in biomedicine * SARS conspiracy theory * Syphon Filter, another video game in which terrorists attempt to release a genetically programmable virus. * Toxicogenomics * Wouter Basson  References  External links * Genetic weapons: a 21st-century nightmare?, Ethirajan Anbarasan, UNESCO Courier, March 1999 * Is all fair in biological warfare?, Journal of Medical Ethics, June 2009. * New biological weapons: Science fiction or moral imperative?, Robin Coupland, Red Cross Red Crescent, July 1999 * US military agency invests $100m in genetic extinction technologies Neslen, Arthur, 2017-12-04, The Guardian, access date 2018-05-01 Category:Biological warfare Category:Bioterrorism Category:Ethnic cleansing Category:Genocide ","title":"Ethnic bioweapon"},{"id":"5975235","text":"Madagascar (1994) is a Cuban film that marked Fernando P√©rez's change of direction into a more lyrical approach to filmmaking, somehow stripped from the realistic documentary feel of his early work. The film chronicles the relationship and lack of communication between a mother and daughter during the Cuban economic crisis known as the Special Period. Background and plot synopsis Madagascar was originally conceived as the first part of a trilogy to be entitled 'Pron√≥stico del tiempo' (\\"Weather Prediction\\"). The production and post-production of director Fernando P√©rez's third fiction film was completed in September 1993 to await the preparation of the work's other two parts: 'Melodrama' (\\"Melodrama,\\" dir. Rolando D√≠az) and 'Qui√©reme y ver√°s' (\\"Love me and you‚Äôll see,\\" dir. Daniel D√≠az Torres). The three directors had worked together to develop their ideas for the creation of the project, but in the end, according to P√©rez, the films wound up lacking the necessary continuity necessary to bind them together. Partly as a result of such concerns over their contents, and partly in response to the delays produced by an ongoing shortage of production funds for D√≠az's and D√≠az Torres' works, each wound up being released independently. During December 1994, over one year after the completion of its post-production, Madagascar first appeared in Cuba's theatres as part of the annual New Latin American Film Festival held in Havana. Madagascar was inspired by the 1984 Mirta Y√°√±ez short story \\"Beatles contra Duran Duran\\" (\\"Beatles Against Duran Duran\\"). The story chronicles the relationship between the narrator, who is a single mother and pragmatic middle-aged professor of physics, and her moody adolescent daughter. The plot of the film draws loosely from the original text, which P√©rez appears to have used as a point of departure and a rough character sketch as he worked closely with cinematographer Ra√∫l P√©rez Ureta and screenwriter Manuel Antonio Rodr√≠guez during the developmental stages of the project. Laura (played by Zaida Castellanos) and Laurita (played by Laura de la Uz) are the central characters of the film and bear an obvious resemblance to the unnamed narrator of the short story and her daughter, Pilar. However, the film's mode of expression as well as its plot both diverge greatly from that of the story. The main characters' opposing personalities form the focal points of the film's narrative, which becomes a sort of psychological travelogue. During the opening sequence, we learn that Laura's life has entered into a mysterious psychological crisis, exacerbated by her daughter's extreme behavior. In an opening monologue, she tells us that she has lost the ability to dream anything different from what she experiences in her daily life. This monologue, and ostensibly the rest of Laura's ongoing voice-over narration, occurs in the context of a consultation with an unseen doctor. From then on, the plot focuses around Laura's internal conflicts and her relationship with her daughter. In an early scene, Laurita informs her mother that she has grown tired of school and will be taking a break from her studies in order to travel to Madagascar. In response, Laura becomes furious and criticizes Laurita for indulging in such frivolous fantasies. Increasingly disaffected, Laurita proceeds to undergo a series of personality transformations. This disturbs Laura, who is frustrated with the stagnant conditions of her own life, but cannot make such sudden changes. Laura and Laurita live together with Laura's elderly mother (Elena Bola√±os), and are accompanied by a reticent young painter known only as Molina (Jorge Molina) who appears to have befriended Laurita. Throughout the film, the family moves often, changing homes four times. The film has the episodic quality of a road movie as much of the exposition thus takes place in the midst of the family's relocations. The climax occurs when, following a particularly difficult argument with her mother, Laurita decides to run away from home. She returns after a few days, but the experience has altered both her and her mother. In the final scene, the two have practically traded personalities, and it is Laura who tells her daughter, \\"nos vamos de viaje para Madagascar\\" (\\"we‚Äôre going to travel to Madagascar\\"). The creators of the film bore the circumstances of its production admirably well. Prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union, ICAIC had imported all of its film and development chemicals from the USSR and its economic allies. The lack of chemicals on the island after 1991 forced Madagascar‚Äôs production unit to mail all of their negatives to a lab in Venezuela, making \\"dailies,\\" or the practice of reviewing each day's shooting and then re-filming whatever did not turn out as planned, impossible. Despite being forced to \\"shoot blind,\\" as it were, P√©rez maintains that he and his crew did not lack any truly fundamental supplies (besides gasoline, which was in scarce supply throughout the island by mid-1993). Nevertheless, the director did believe at the time that it would be his last film and such conditions may have played a significant role in the development of the film's style and plot. To date, Madagascar and the other pieces intended to make up \\"Pron√≥stico del tiempo\\" remain some of the last films to receive all of their production funds exclusively from el Instituto Cubano de Arte e Industria Cinematogr√°ficos (ICAIC, the \\"Cuban Institute for the Film Art and Industry\\"). During the early 1990s, the Cuban economy had fallen on hard times and ICAIC's budget suffered accordingly. By 1995, the small, semi-autonomous, national industry that had been producing independent works since 1959 had to restructure itself to meet the demands of the international market. Co- productions with outside organizations, intended for release in foreign markets became the only available means of survival.

Vocalist Steve Gadd (born Stephen Gadd, 27 April 1952, Shepherd's Bush, West London), guitarist Del Bromham (born Derek Roy Bromham, 25 November 1951, Acton, West London), bass player Gary Giles (born Gary Stephen Giles, 23 February 1952, North Kensington, West London) and drummer Steve Crutchley (born 1952) formed the band whilst all were attending the Christopher Wren School in London. Richard \\"Ritchie\\" Cole (born 10 November 1951, Shepherd's Bush, West London) replaced Crutchley in 1968. They signed to Transatlantic Records in January 1970. The group's brand of melodic, hook-laden hard rock proved to be a popular draw on the local club scene during the early 1970s. However the band did not have commercial success with its record releases. At one stage Charlie Kray (brother of the Kray twins Ronnie and Reggie), was their manager. Gadd left the band in 1975 due to artistic differences and was replaced on vocals by Pete Dyer. The group's early musical style consisted of blues rock, acid rock and psychedelic rock. They then went on to join the hard rock and progressive rock movement. The band served as the rhythm section alongside a string orchestra for the 1975 Jimmy Helms Pye LP, Songs I Sing. The original Stray finally dissolved in 1977, although Bromham later continued to play in various resurrected versions of the project well into the 2000s. By the 2010s the band had a settled lineup again, as well as Del Bromham, Pete Dyer returned and Stuart Uren (bass) and Karl Randall (drums) were regularly gigging as Stray. In November 2016, the band hosted a 50th Anniversary celebration concert (featuring all original members) at a sold-out London Borderline. In 2019 Colin Kempster replaced Stuart Uren as permanent bassist and for live gigs the band was also joined by Simon Rinaldo on keyboards. After successful concerts in the Autumn of 2019 and an acclaimed set at the annual Giants of Rock Festival in Minehead, Stray set out on a full joint headlining tour with Ken Pustelnik‚Äôs Groundhogs in February and March of 2020. In 2003, Stray were the support band to Iron Maiden on several of their European dates on the Dance of Death World Tour 2003-2004. These included dates in Spain, Portugal, Poland and France. There are two other Iron Maiden connections to Stray. \\"All in Your Mind\\" from Stray's 1970 debut album was covered by Iron Maiden and was included on the 1995 reissue of No Prayer for the Dying, and Maiden bassist Steve Harris's daughter Lauren has covered \\"Come On Over\\". From late 2006 until early 2007, the band's back catalogue of eight studio albums issued originally during the 1970s, were re-released by the UK based Sanctuary Records in compact disc format. The new releases were remastered and had bonus tracks culled from single B-sides, studio outtakes and BBC broadcast sessions.

It was discovered in 1996 and scientifically described in 1998. The species epithet commemorates Brazilian zoologist and wildlife filmmaker Werner Bokermann, who died in 1995. Because of its helmet-like crown it has received the Portuguese name soldadinho-do-araripe which means \\"little soldier of Araripe\\". This name also associates it with the related, but more widespread, helmeted manakin (Antilophia galeata), which is known simply as the soldadinho. Description As typical of most manakins, males and females have a strong sexual dimorphism in the colours of the plumage. As in the helmeted manakin, it is a relatively large and long-tailed manakin, with a total length of c. . The strikingly patterned males have predominantly white plumage. With the exception of the white little wings coverts, the wings are black as the tail. From the frontal tuft, over the crown, down to the middle back runs a carmine red patch. The iris is red. The females are mainly olive green and have pale green upperparts. They have a reduced olive green frontal tuft. Diet This species consumes both plant and animal materials as part of their diet. Approximately 80% of their diet comes from the plant Clidemia biserrata. Araripe Manakins consume fruit and arthropods, although fruits are the primary item in their diet. Females have a more diverse diet than males, because the more cryptic olive-green plumage of females provides them with a greater degree of camouflage in forests, allowing them to find food with less predation, meanwhile, males are a very bright white color, which makes them more vulnerable to predation. Females also have a longer bill, which allows them to manipulate more types of fruit than males can able to handle and digest. Distribution This species is endemic to the Chapada do Araripe (Araripe uplands) in the Brazilian state of Cear√° in the north eastern region of the country. It is only fifty kilometres long and one kilometre wide and the typical habitat apparently is a consequence of the soils formed from the Early Cretaceous Santana Formation limestone. The pure breeding range has a size of only 1 km¬≤ and lies in a theme park. It is likely to be more widespread than presently known, although surveys in nearby Balneario das Caldas failed to locate any individuals. Threats Chapada do Araripe is the only known locality In 2000 there was an estimated population of less than 50 individuals and it was considered as one of the rarest birds in Brazil and in the world. Only three males and one female were found until that date. In 2003 the estimations were more optimistic and BirdLife International assumed the population of 49 to 250 individuals. In 2004 it proceeded on the assumption that less than 250 individuals exist in the wild which was based on 43 discovered males. In 2000 a theme park with swimming pools and asphalted roads was built at the type locality Nascente do Farias and the largest part of its original habitat became destroyed. The cleared trees were replaced by banana plantations. The last assessed population was on August 7th, 2018. An estimated 150 - 700 mature individuals are living in Brazil. At the BirdLife International celebrity lecture held in Peterborough on 16 August 2008, it was announced that Sir David Attenborough would be championing the Araripe manakin in an effort to raise funds to help protect this rare bird. There are approximately 500 pairs of the Araripe manakin left. Sir David was presented with a picture of the manakin following his lecture, which was on Alfred Russel Wallace and Birds of Paradise.

The armistice was signed on 3 November 1918 in the Villa Giusti, outside Padua in the Veneto, Northern Italy, and took effect 24 hours later.Armistice Convention with Austria- Hungary Background By the end of October 1918, the Austro-Hungarian Army was so fatigued that its commanders were forced to seek a ceasefire. In the final stage of the Battle of Vittorio Veneto, a stalemate was reached, and the troops of Austria-Hungary started a chaotic withdrawal. On 28 October, Austria-Hungary began to negotiate a truce but hesitated to sign the text of the armistice. In the meantime, the Italians reached Trento and Udine, and landed in Trieste. After a threat to break off negotiations, the Austro- Hungarians, on 3 November, accepted the armistice. Terms The ceasefire would start at 15:00 on 4 November, but a unilateral order of the Austro- Hungarian High Command made its forces stop fighting on 3 November. The armistice required Austria-Hungary's forces to evacuate not only all territory occupied since August 1914 but also South Tirol, Tarvisio, the Isonzo Valley, Gorizia, Trieste, Istria, western Carniola, and Dalmatia. All German forces would be expelled from Austria-Hungary within 15 days or interned, and the Allies were to have the free use of Austria-Hungary's internal communications. Austria-Hungary was also to allow the transit of the Triple Entente armies to reach Germany from the South. In November 1918, the Italian Army, with 20,000 to 22,000 soldiers, began to occupy Innsbruck and all North Tyrol. After the war, Italy annexed Southern Tyrol (now Trentino-Alto Adige/S√ºdtirol), according to the secret Treaty of London, as well as Trieste and the Austrian Littoral.

It was also known as William Ebsworth Hill & Sons or William E. Hill & Sons. Overview Founded by William Ebsworth Hill at Wardour Street in 1880 and moved to 38 New Bond Street in 1887, ten years later relocated to 140 New Bond Street. In 1887 built workshops in Hanwell and extended them in 1904. The name W. E. Hill & Sons is built on a long family history of violin making, going back to William Ebsworth's great-grandfather, Joseph Hill. The firm soon gained a widespread reputation for expertise and dealing in fine instruments. They were also established as makers of instruments, bows, cases and fittings. A Hill's Certificate of Authenticity is considered definitive worldwide throughout the firm's history and their publications on Stradivari and Guarneri are still industry standards. Many fine craftsmen worked for the firm. For much of the 20th century, the Hill workshop employed England‚Äôs best bow makers, who created bows renowned for character and consistency. Hill violins, cellos and cases are also highly regarded. Their other products included varnish cleaner, violin e-strings, rosin, peg paste, music stands, chinrests, and specialist tools. Over the years many of the most celebrated instruments by Stradivari, Amati, and Guarneri passed through Hill & Sons. They built up one of the most notable collections of stringed instruments which can be seen at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, including the \\"Messiah\\" Stradivari from 1716. In the mid-1970s Hills bought 'Havenfields' in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire and moved to the workshop there. W. E. Hill and Sons closed the workshop at Havenfields in 1992. The owners and directors of W. E. Hill & Sons: Stefan-Peter Greiner, renowned violin maker, Simon Morris and Steven Smith, managing directors of J&A; Beare, Derek Wilson, Hill bowmaker, and Robert Brewer Young, distinguished luthier, have broad experience in expertise, appraisal, violin and bow making, restoration, and conservation.

He is best known for his participation in professional wrestling as the longtime magazine columnist for Power Slam and Wrestling World. Career =Music= Self-taught, Manor became competent in songwriting, synthesizer, drum set and related percussion instruments, harmonica, vocals and electric bass. He performed in a public demonstration with synthesizer inventor Dr. Robert Moog. He also wrote three articles for Modern Drummer magazine. Stately is one of the \\"Sigma Kids,\\" a group of eleven (among dozens) of David Bowie devotees who kept a ten-day vigil outside the studio and band's hotel during the recording of Young Americans rewarded afterwards with an exclusive listening party hosted by Bowie, as documented in Rolling Stone magazine. In 2007, a special CD/DVD re- release of the album features Manor visible in four photos in the enclosed booklet. Photos from the event also appear in books about Bowie and the original supermodel, Gia, as well as on the SWM website ‚ÄòPhotos‚Äô archive.http://swmswm.com/sigmakids.htm SWM site Young Americans photo page The May 2014 issue of Britain's Mojo magazine, in an article chronicling the YA sessions, featured two photos from said booklet, including a never-before- released color version of one, capturing Stately in the foreground. The same photo ran in the September 2016 editing of Wax Poetics magazine. Inspired by the Sigma experience, Manor assembled a short-lived band, recruiting bassist Gail Ann Dorsey. In the latter half of the Seventies, Stately became deeply immersed in the emerging punk rock music scene. He was a regular and occasional performer at Philadelphia's Hot Club and frequented NYC venues such as CBGB and Max's Kansas City, regularly sleeping on the couch of future recording-engineer superstar Bob Clearmountain while in New York. Manor was also slated to drum behind former Sex Pistol Sid Vicious on the Philly date of the latter's aborted \\"solo tour.\\" Additionally, he wrote the liner notes for the aborted Cheetah Chrome debut solo album on Polish Records. (Stately did receive a 'Thank You' on that label's release \\"Siren\\" by Ronnie Spector.) =Professional wrestling= Manor later regained interest in a childhood hobby, professional wrestling, and was particularly drawn towards the \\"heel\\" (‚Äòbad guy‚Äô) characters. Manor eventually broke into the sport as a feature writer in 1984 and, in 1986, as a pro-heel columnist for Wrestling World magazine. Manor expanded into color commentating, managing grapplers, performing in-ring skits and ghostwriting wisecracks for the performers. Manor was the very first color commentator for the ECW promotion (in their pre- Extreme days). He is also the first American magazine writer to give international exposure to Sabu, Rey Misterio, Sean Waltman, John Cena, Sandman and Victoria/Tara (Lisa Marie Varon). During 1993, in the midst of his 17-year Wrestling World‚Äô employment, Manor debuted a second villain-praising column in the British Power Slam. The combined consecutive tenures makes Manor the longest-running magazine columnist in pro wrestling history. Other media =Print= Stately takes on the general public via ‚Äò‚ÄôOn Manor's Mind‚Äô‚Äô rants for the alternative set, and rages about inane celebrities in his SNAPS‚ÄîSuckas Needing A Pimp Slap‚ÄîOf The Month column. A lifelong fan of obscure so-bad- they're-good films, Stately also authors ‚Äò‚ÄôManor On Movies‚Äô‚Äô, an affectionate homage to the genre, and one of the earliest columns of its kind still regularly published. It is available in hard copy and on a few websites besides its own, e.g. The Spinning Image.http://www.thespinningimage.co.uk/ The Spinning Image website His long-term side project is a book dedicated to the horror/sci-fi end of what Manor has dubbed \\"junkfilms.\\" Other journals that have carried Stately's work, under the Manor moniker or otherwise, include Inside Karate, Video Review, People (Australia), Filmfax, Tuber‚Äôs Voice (the originators of the term ‚Äòcouch potato‚Äô), Comic Release, Carbon 14, and Brutarian, to name a few. In addition, he has repeatedly scored ‚ÄòDishonorable Mention‚Äô in the annual international Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, where the challenge is to compose the worst possible opening line for a novel. =Radio and television= In character, Manor has guested on radio programs throughout the US and Canada, including morning drive time shows in Philadelphia and New York City. Manor was once booked on Sneak Previews Goes Video‚Äîan Eighties reworking of the popular movie-review program‚Äîto discuss wrestling videos, but the segment was red-lighted by PBS executives who considered the subject matter \\"too lowbrow.\\" =Video= Stately can be heard providing color commentary on two volumes from the Pro Wrestling From Japan series, Bam Bam Bigelow And Friends, and Bruiser Brody Memorial, both featuring the American stars as they toured with the New Japan Pro Wrestling promotion in the late Eighties.

Denis in Histoire naturelle des quinquinas Hugh Algernon Weddell (22 June 1819 - 22 July 1877) was a physician and botanist, specialising in South American flora. Weddell was born at Birches House, Painswick near Gloucester, England but was raised in France and educated at the Lyc√©e Henri IV, where he received a medical degree in 1841. He had also studied botany and became a respected member of the French botanical fraternity. While studying he accompanied Adrien-Henri de Jussieu (1797-1853) on numerous botanizing expeditions and he became a collaborator with Ernest Cosson (1819-1889) and Jacques Germain de Saint-Pierre (1815-1882) in the preparation of Flore des environs de Paris (1845). In 1843, he was invited to join the expedition of Fran√ßois Louis de la Porte, comte de Castelnau to South America, and he explored and collected botanical specimens on that continent for five years. In May 1845, Weddell left the expedition which was then in Paraguay, and proceeded on a solitary journey which would take him into Peru and Bolivia. Before leaving Paris, he had been particularly instructed by the Mus√©um national d'Histoire naturelle to undertake a thorough investigation of the Cinchona plant, or \\"fever bark\\" tree in its native habitat. Cinchona, the source of quinine, was of great commercial importance and Europeans had been investigating it for nearly two hundred years with the goal of cultivating it in regions far removed from the Andes mountains. Weddell explored a number of regions where the trees grew and identified no fewer than fifteen distinct species of the genus Cinchona (Rubiaceae). The seeds which he took back to Paris were germinated in the Jardin des Plantes, and the plants were used to establish Cinchona forests in Java and elsewhere in the East Indies. In 1847 he married Manuela Bolognesi,Letter from Mrs. Weddell to the Society's president, 17 June 1891.

In Paris, Weddell was given the post of assistant naturalist at the museum. He held this office until 1853. Weddell made a second trip to South America in 1851. He returned to France and died on 22 July 1877 in Poitiers, while caring for his father. He is commemorated in the names of a number of plants and animals, including the dusky-headed parakeet, Aratinga weddellii, and the Andean plant Diplostephium weddellii S.F.Blake (Compositae).

According to some theorists, oral epic poetry would be created at the same period, and would be transmitted, by singers who displayed less creativity, through later periods. Scholars who adopted the theory of a heroic age include: * Maurice Bowra * Hector Munro Chadwick and Nora Kershaw Chadwick A widely shared view was that each society would pass through a heroic age only once. This apparently explains why, in the Chadwicks' world survey of oral and traditional poetry, The Growth of Literature, medieval European epics such as the French Chansons de geste and the Spanish Cantar de Mio Cid are omitted: those societies are taken to have passed through a heroic age earlier. Bryan Hainsworth has suggested that in the various so-called Heroic Ages named by modern scholars \\"what is described is a by-product ... of the tendency of heroic poetry to congeal into cycles, often ... around a signal event\\" (1993, p. 40).  Historicity of the Ages  Oral tales have been formed into classic literature centuries later so that the historicity of the events is left to uncertainty. The Greek Heroic Age as described in the Iliad is dated to historic events in 1460 to 1103 BC according to the chronology of Saint Jerome. The Germanic Heroic Age as reflected in the Nibelungen can be dated to the 5th century picking up scenes from the foundation of Germanic kingdoms in Western Europe near the end of the first phase of the V√∂lkerwanderung. The literature characters may refer to the historic Brunhilda (543‚Äì613) and Gundobad (480‚Äì516). The Tamils of South India have an extensive literature describing their Heroic Age (the Sangam period). The Sangam poems share common themes with their Greek and German counterparts, such as glory, victory, fate and honour. The Sangam age is dated to between the 3rd century B.C.E and 2nd century C.E. However, the events described have been transmitted orally from an earlier period. This is evidenced by the oral nature of the poems which (like the Iliad and Odyssey) use epithets and other metrical devices common in oral poetry.  Bibliography C. M. Bowra, Heroic poetry.

Only a few such problems have been solved, such as Merton's portfolio problem in financial economics or trajectory optimization in aeronautics. A more technical explanation follows. The most common difficulty in applying Pontryagin's principle arises when the Hamiltonian depends linearly on the control u, i.e., is of the form: H(u)=\\\\phi(x,\\\\lambda,t)u+\\\\cdots and the control is restricted to being between an upper and a lower bound: a\\\\le u(t)\\\\le b. To minimize H(u), we need to make u as big or as small as possible, depending on the sign of \\\\phi(x,\\\\lambda,t), specifically: : u(t) = \\\\begin{cases} b, & \\\\phi(x,\\\\lambda,t)<0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ ?, & \\\\phi(x,\\\\lambda,t)=0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ a, & \\\\phi(x,\\\\lambda,t)>0.\\\\end{cases} If \\\\phi is positive at some times, negative at others and is only zero instantaneously, then the solution is straightforward and is a bang-bang control that switches from b to a at times when \\\\phi switches from negative to positive. The case when \\\\phi remains at zero for a finite length of time t_1\\\\le t\\\\le t_2 is called the singular control case. Between t_1 and t_2 the maximization of the Hamiltonian with respect to u gives us no useful information and the solution in that time interval is going to have to be found from other considerations. (One approach would be to repeatedly differentiate \\\\partial H/\\\\partial u with respect to time until the control u again explicitly appears, which is guaranteed to happen eventually. One can then set that expression to zero and solve for u. This amounts to saying that between t_1 and t_2 the control u is determined by the requirement that the singularity condition continues to hold. The resulting so-called singular arc will be optimal if it satisfies the Kelley condition: :(-1)^k \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial u} \\\\left[ {\\\\left( \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\right)}^{2k} H_u \\\\right] \\\\ge 0 ,\\\\, k=0,1,\\\\cdots Others refer to this condition as the generalized Legendre‚ÄìClebsch condition.

It primarily promotes and operates helicopter air ambulance services. , they operate seven Eurocopter EC135 and one EC145 helicopters out of seven bases in Norway, based on contracts with the state through the Norwegian Air Ambulance. In Denmark, they operate three EC135 out of three bases. The foundation carries out charitable work, including providing additional funding for all helicopter ambulances in Norway to increase their medical equipment. It also funds research within critical emergency medicine and operates a service to fly its members home in case of illness. With 706,000, it is the organization in Norway with the most members. Operations are carried out through the subsidiary Norsk Luftambulanse AS. Established in 1977 by Jens Moe, operations out of L√∏renskog Heliport, Central Hospital started the following year. The services out of Stavanger commenced in 1981. The state funding started in 1988, after which NLA established the bases at Bergen and Trondheim. NLS later won contracts to operate out of Arendal, √Öl, Domb√•s, and F√∏rde. History =Establishment= A government commission which published its results in 1977 considered the possibility for a helicopter-based air ambulance service.Ministry of Health and Social Affairs: 10 They concluded that although there could be benefits with a service, the cost would have to weighed up with other health activities. The commission also commented on that the helicopters would lay hold on a large number of physicians.Ministry of Health and Social Affairs: 12 Parallel with this work the Dr√∏bak-based Jens Moe started working with plans to establish a helicopter ambulance service. He was inspired by the systems applied in West Germany and Switzerland, run by ADAC and Rega. This model involved manning the helicopter with an anesthesiologist, a rescue swimmer and a pilot. Since the late 1960s he had been working for an improved ambulance service, which he wanted manned with anesthesiologists or anesthesia nurses.Ministry of Health and Social Affairs: 11 Norsk Luftambulanse AS was incorporated on 6 November 1977, originally with Moe, Fred √òistein Andersen and Ingvar Vilfladt as shareholders. However, they were in need of funding and decided to establish a foundation which would own the operating company and fund it through charitable donations. They decided to follow the example of the German Bj√∂rn-Steiger-Stiftung and name the foundation after a patient who probably would have lived with quicker response times. They identified the nine-year-old B√•rd √òstgaard who drowned in Groruddammen in Oslo in August 1975. The parents were sceptical, but hesitantly agreed to the naming scheme.Andersen: 22 Within a few weeks Moe had organized a 700,000 Norwegian krone loan from Storebrand. On 26 November 1977, B√•rd √òstgaards Stiftelse was incorporated.Andersen: 26 Initially the foundation started fund-raising to run a one-year trial with a helicopter based near Oslo. Moe and Andersen held a meeting with Minister of Social Affairs Ruth Ryste. Although she saw the advantages of the case, she could not support it. A major concern was that the service would be provided in Eastern Norway, the most densely populated part of the country. She stated if such a service was adapted, it should be provided equally throughout the country and the Western Norway or Northern Norway would be more natural areas to start, with longer distances and poor infrastructure.Andersen: 30 Instead Moe turned to the Norwegian Automobile Federation (NAF), which in 1975 had attempted to start a similar project in Moss in cooperation with the Norwegian Armed Forces' medical services. They cooperated in 1977 and brought an ADAC helicopter to various sites in Eastern Norway. By indicated that each location was a possible candidate for a base, they were able to garnish support from the various local newspapers. However, NAF did not have funds to follow through on the project and pulled out.Andersen: 34 Instead Moe approached LHL, which supported their plans. They bought shares in the operating company and issued a guarantee, in exchange for a seat on the board.Andersen: 35 The foundation sent out 850,000 brochures to recruit members. Costing half a million krone, it brought in 3000 members.Andersen: 38 They chartered a Rega helicopter which they toured Eastern Norway. On 11 March they were had a demonstration at Holmenkollbakken, when a group of youth were hit by an avalanche at Norefjell. The helicopter was immediately dispatched and participated in the rescue.Andersen: 39 Erik Berge was hired as managing director and his main task was to recruit members. By the end of 1978, the organization had 13,700 members.Andersen: 43 To make membership more attractive, NLA cooperated with Rega to provide free flights home for its members under given conditions, using Rega's aircraft.Andersen: 209 An operations center was established in Dr√∏bak. It gradually developed more as an advisory call center, focusing on giving members advise either before travel or after incidents had occurred. The base was later moved to L√∏renskog and the division was named Global Medical Services (GMS).Andersen: 21 =L√∏renskog and Stavanger= Norsk Luftambulanse started discussions with Akershus County Municipality, who were positive to the service. This resulted in Akershus Central Hospital (SiA, today Ahus) being selected as the initial base.Andersen: 31 NLA's first helicopter was a Messerschmitt-B√∂lkow-Blohm Bo 105 which was leased from the manufacturer and named B√•rd 1.Andersen: 29 To aid funding, it received advertisements. The service was inaugurated on 7 June 1978.Andersen: 14 Although SiA received a heliport, no helipads were built at Rikshospitalet in Oslo. Therefore, NLA often had to land at Bislett Stadion and transfer patients to an ambulance there.Andersen: 17 NLA did not have an air operator's certificate to begin with and subcontracted operations to M√∏refly.Andersen: 16 They received NOK 180,000 per month, In addition came the costs for medical personnel, the base and medical equipment. LHL retracted their support in February 1979, citing poor administration. They subsequently sold their shares in the operating company to the foundation. Also Endre Bols√∏, √òstgaards' stepfather and chairman of the board, criticized the lack of financial control.Andersen: 47 From 1 May 1979 they therefore switched operator to Partnair. They proposed moving the base to Oslo Airport, Fornebu to cut costs, but this was rejected.Andersen: 49 The Ministry of Social Affairs evaluated the helicopter ambulance service after a year. They carried out 216 missions, of which the commission found that five instances where the air ambulance had been decisive to rescue the person's life and avoid permanent injury. They concluded that the helicopter was profitable for society, but did not find it to be optimal use of limited resources in the health sector. It concluded that a service would only be efficient if located on-site at a hospital with quick scrambling of anesthesiologist, where it was well-coordinated with ground ambulance services and emergency communications, and in densely populated areas.Ministry of Health and Social Affairs: 13 By February 1980 Bols√∏ and √òstegaard's mother were sufficiently fed up with the situation that they asked that the foundation remove √òstgaard's name from its name. This was followed up and on 17 June 1980 the foundation took its current name.Andersen: 50 The same year NLA received its own air operator's certificate. The section initiative to build a base took place at Rogaland Central Hospital in Stavanger.Andersen: 131 As in Akershus there were mixed reactions towards the service. Twenty-three municipalities in three counties gave financial support, as did a series of companies. Rogaland County Municipality approved the plans, but did not provide funding. The main area of dispute was whether helicopters were cost-efficient, and whether the money would not instead be better utilized in other pre-hospital tasks.Andersen: 133 The project did not receive the support of the Directorate of Health.Andersen: 134 Stavanger Heliport, Central Hospital opened on 4 June 1981. =State funding= A government commission looked into the air ambulance organization in 1982. It recommended that the county municipalities take responsibility for the services in the same way the funded and operated the conventional ambulance services. However, the counties were not necessarily a natural border, so it would require inter-county cooperation. The Ministry of Social Affairs concluded that the counties were not large enough to support such a service and therefore proposed a national organization, where the counties paid part of the cost. The national coordination was placed with the National Insurance Service.Ministry of Health and Social Affairs: 15 During Easter NLA assigned special preparedness for mountainous areas. This resulted in a series of \\"Easter bases\\" equipped for the week. The first was in Beitost√∏len in 1982. The following years this base was situated at Rjukan; Domb√•s; Fagernes Airport, Leirin; and Geilo Airport, Dagali, respectively.Andersen: 139 A new government commission investigated the issue in 1986. The background was doubling of both costs and use of fixed-wing and rotor-craft air ambulance use between 1982 and 1985. A major contributor was the lack of physicians in Finnmark. The commission recommended that eight bases be established. In addition to L√∏renskog and Stavanger, new bases would be established in Troms√∏, Br√∏nn√∏ysund, Trondheim, √Ölesund, Bergen and Domb√•s.Ministry of Health and Social Affairs: 16 The plan was carried through and the new bases became operative as of 1988. Funding was secured by the state, while the county municipalities were responsible for the respective medical personnel. The aviation operations were subcontracted to commercial airlines. The new system was named the State's Air Ambulance.Ministry of Health and Social Affairs: 17 Fifteen companies bid to operate the various helicopter contracts. In addition to keeping its operations in L√∏renskog and Stavanger, NLA was awarded the contract for Trondheim, Bergen and Domb√•s.Ministry of Health and Social Affairs: 88 Trondheim was well covered by the 330 Squadron from √òrland Main Air Station, and therefore there been a debate if another helicopter would be cost-efficient. Initial plans called for a base at Trondheim Regional Hospital, but instead Trondheim Heliport, Rosten was placed near Tiller.Andersen: 157 The foundation's Cessna Citation II NLA station a helicopter in Lesja for the National Shooting Competition in 1985. The local communities in northern Gudbrandsdalen therefore started working to receive their own base. The quickly opted for Domb√•s, as it was the center of the district.Andersen: 135 With local funding, the state gave permission to open a base from 1 January 1988. A facility was built at the municipal medical center, with Dovre Municipality and Lesja Municipality paying for the construction. However, a more suitable base was needed and a new heliport opened on 8 March 1991.Andersen: 137 In Bergen it was not possible to establish a helipad at the hospital. Instead Bergen Heliport, Nyg√•rdstangen was built, close to the city center. From there patients were transported by ambulance to Haukeland Hospital.Andersen: 143 The helicopters would on occasion land on a lot at the hospital, although the physician had to claim necessity as the site lacked certification. During the summer of 1986 NLA stationed its reserve helicopter in Arendal. This proved popular and they continued to have a temporary base their each summer.Andersen: 151 The commission stated that Agder and Telemark were well within the catchment areas of Stavanger and L√∏renskog. When the national commission decided not to establish a base in Agder, several local agencies started working to establish a permanent base anyway. This also resulted in a local location struggle. Vest-Agder County Municipality argued that the base should be situated at Vest-Agder Central Hospital in Kristiansand, while Aust-Agder County Municipality wanted it at Aust-Agder Central Hospital in Arendal.Andersen: 155 Parliament approved the Arendal Heliport, Hospital, allowing it to start operations in 1991.Andersen: 153 In Northern Norway there had since the 1930s been operated fixed-wing seaplane ambulances. These were often flowing in a combination of ambulance and charter services.Andersen: 169 In the public procurement process, NLA allied themselves with Wider√∏e and Air Express. The latter two would operate the aircraft, while NLA would man them with medical personnel. The consortium won the contracts for Troms√∏ Airport, Alta Airport and Kirkenes Airport, H√∏ybuktmoen. NLA established a Northern Norway operations central at Wider√∏e's offices at Bod√∏ Airport.Andersen: 171 =Acquisitions= Due to a strenuous cooperation with Air Express, NLA decided to establish a fixed-wing division in 1989. This included taking over the two aircraft at Kirkenes and the jet used for international flights at Oslo Airport, Fornebu.Andersen: 172 For this work NLA bought a Cessna Citation II, when they operated between 1989 and 1995.Hagby: 237 Norsk Luftambulanse operates Eurocopter EC 135 helicopters F√∏rde Heliport, Central Hospital was established in 1992 and the contract was issued to Airlift. In 1993 there was a new contract tender, and Airlift won the operations out of F√∏rde, Bergen and Domb√•s. Within NLA there was a debate as to whether to treat Airlift as a competitor or to cooperate with them.Andersen: 178 A deal was struck and NLA bought 34 percent of the company. Later it bought a further 32 percent, but later sold the shares again.Andersen: 179 In 1994 NLA lost the contract to operate fixed-wing aircraft in Kirkenes to M√∏refly. The Easter bases spurred interest amongst locals in the interior valleys of Buskerud, Oppdal and Telemark to receive a permanent helicopter ambulance service. Political work started in 1992, but the Ministry of Social Affairs did not prioritize it in its 1994 budget.Andersen: 166 However, this resulted in a series of political initiatives from the area and when Parliament voted over the budget, grants had been allocated for √Öl Heliport.Andersen: 167 Operations commenced on 1 September 1994.Andersen: 168 The same year NLA stationed a helicopter in Lillehammer for the duration of the 1994 Winter Olympics.Andersen: 174 A Beechcraft Super King Air of Svensk Flygambulans The tender for operations after 2001 resulted in NLA losing the operating rights for Arendal, √Öl and Domb√•s, while it won back the operations in Bergen. With the hospital reform which took effect 1 January 2002, the coordinating responsibility for hospitals was allocated to the five regional health authorities. They created the National Air Ambulance Service in 2004. GMS was moved to Ullev√•l University Hospital in Oslo in 2002.Andersen: 212 In March 2006 NLA the results of a new tender were announced. NLA kept its existing bases and was also awarded the contract for Arendal, √Öl an Domb√•s from 2008 to 2014 or 2018.Andersen: 122 NLA bought the Swedish air ambulance operator SOS Flygambulans from SOS Alarm in May 2004 and renamed it Svensk Flygambulans.Andersen: 219 The subsidiary was based at Gothenburg City Airport and operated three fixed-wing aircraft.Andersen: 220 NLA saw it as a strategic move to expand its operations both geographically, as well as making them able to enter the fixed-wing market.Andersen: 221 NLA sold Svensk Flygambulans to Scandinavian Air Ambulance in August 2008. Central H√•logaland was the most densely populated district of Norway lacking a helicopter ambulance service. The National Air Ambulance Service therefore issued a tender in 2014 to establish a base at Harstad/Narvik Airport, Evenes. The tender was won by NLA, who started operations in May 2015. The base was manned with an EC145. Denmark introduced a trial with helicopter ambulances in 2011. After the trial period, they announced in October 2013 that NLA had won a six-year contract to operate the new national air ambulance service, with an option to expand the contract to nine years. If executed, the contract is worth one billion Danish krone. The contract was made with Regions Denmark, a cooperation between the five regions of Denmark. Operations NLA's Eurocopter EC145 at T√∏nsberg Hospital Stiftelsen Norsk Luftambulanse is a non-profit foundation based in Dr√∏bak. It has 706,000 members, making it the largest organization in Norway by number of members. The foundation provides funding for all heliports, independent of operator, to be equipped with an ambulance emergency response vehicle with similar equipment to that which is installed in the helicopters. The vehicles are used when the anesthesiologists are needed at accidents near the heliport, in which road transport is faster or more convenient than the helicopter.Andersen: 112 Donations are used to support research within emergency medicine. NLA has at any time twenty people working on doctoral dissertations in the field. Members of the foundation are entitled advise from NLA's Global Medical Services, situated at Ullev√•l University Hospital. The center can be used both for advice before travel and after sickness or accidents have occurred. Granted that the member has valid travel insurance, NLA may under given circumstances dispatch a nurse to aid the patient. NLA provides free first-aid courses for its members. The foundation also publishes a quarterly membership magazine, Magasin. Norsk Luftambulanse AS is a limited company wholly owned by the foundation that operate ambulance helicopters for the National Air Ambulance Service. It operates twenty helicopters, consisting of two Eurocopter EC135 P2+, nine Eurocopter EC135 T3 and nine Eurocopter EC145 T2. These operate out of twelve bases in Norway and four in Denmark. The company had a revenue of NOK 216 million in 2009 and had 100 employees. {  + Bases ! scope=col  Heliport ! scope=col  ICAO ! scope=col  Municipality ! scope=col  Country ! scope=col  Owner - ! scope=row  √Öl Heliport, Medical Center  ENAH  √Öl  Norway  Vestre Viken Hospital Trust - ! scope=row  Arendal Heliport, Hospital  ENAR  Arendal  Norway  S√∏rlandet Hospital Trust - ! scope=row  Bergen Heliport, Gr√∏nneviks√∏ren  ENBG  Bergen  Norway  Bergen Hospital Trust - ! scope=row  Billund Airport  EKBI  Billund  Denmark  ‚Äî - ! scope=row  Domb√•s Heliport, Brunshaugen  ENDB  Dovre  Norway  Norsk Luftambulanse - ! scope=row  F√∏rde Heliport, Central Hospital  ENFD  F√∏rde  Norway  F√∏rde Hospital Trust - ! scope=row  Harstad/Narvik Airport, Evenes  ENEV  Evenes  Norway  Avinor - ! scope=row  L√∏renskog Heliport, Ahus  ENLX  L√∏renskog  Norway  Oslo University Hospital - ! scope=row  Ringsted Airport  EKRS  Ringsted  Denmark  ‚Äî - ! scope=row  Skive Airport  EKSV  Skive  Denmark  ‚Äî - ! scope=row  Stavanger Heliport, University Hospital  ENSX  Stavanger  Norway  Norsk Luftambulanse - ! scope=row  Trondheim Heliport, Rosten  ENRT  Trondheim  Norway  Norsk Luftambulanse } References Bibliography  Category:Airlines of Norway Category:Air ambulance services in Norway Category:Airlines established in 1977 Category:1977 establishments in Norway Category:Medical and health organisations based in Norway Category:Organisations based in Akershus Category:Frogn ","title":"Norsk Luftambulanse"},{"id":"5975471","text":"Fantaghir√≤, alternately titled The Cave of the Golden Rose (La Grotta della Rosa d'Oro), is an Italian fantasy series consisting of five television films directed by Lamberto Bava and released between 1991 and 1996. The first film was originally based on Italo Calvino's Fanta-Ghiro the Beautiful, before splitting in its own direction in the sequels, and takes place in a fairy tale setting, featuring princesses, princes, witches, wizards and talking animals. Highly popular in Italy during the 1990s, it was loosely adapted into a cartoon series of the same title and there also have been abortive plans for further film entries. Films =Fantaghir√≤ (1991)= Fantaghir√≤ is the youngest of three princesses born to a warrior King. Although beautiful and intelligent, she causes many problems for her family because she goes against everything expected for a woman in her kingdom, by being literate, adventurous and rebellious, which makes her father furious. One day, the warrior King receives an invitation from the enemy king Romualdo to a duel that can potentially end the centuries-long war that has been going on between the two kingdoms. The warrior king then learns that only one of his three daughters can win the fight. Fantaghir√≤ sees this as a chance for her to prove herself. =Fantaghir√≤ 2 (1992)= Fantaghir√≤ and Romualdo are due to be married, but their wedding is cut short when news arrives that Fantaghir√≤'s father has been kidnapped by the evil Black Witch. The witch demands that Fantaghir√≤ and Romualdo submit to her rule, but they refuse and Romualdo declares war. He sets out with his army, leaving behind Fantaghir√≤, who has sworn not to lift another weapon for the rest of her life. However, Fantaghir√≤ finds that she has to break her promise, and secretly sets out on her own to the Dark Kingdom, where the witch will do everything in her power to separate Fantaghir√≤ from Romualdo forever and make him her lover. =Fantaghir√≤ 3 (1993)= The dark wizard Tarabas learns that his powerful kingdom will be defeated by a royal child of no more than ten years of age. He becomes obsessed with learning how this will happen, so he orders his clay warriors to kidnap all of the world's royal children. When the children of Fantaghir√≤'s sisters become targets, Fantaghir√≤ and Romualdo protect them from the attacking clay soldiers. However, during the fight Romualdo accidentally falls into a cursed river and turns into stone. Fantaghir√≤ then learns that she has to find Tarabas if she wants to save her beloved Romualdo. =Fantaghir√≤ 4 (1994)= A black cloud is travelling throughout the land, destroying everything it touches. When the black cloud consumes Fantaghir√≤'s castle, she allies herself with Prince Parsel to track the black cloud to its origins and stop whoever is casting it. Along the way, Fantaghir√≤ is reunited with the wizard Tarabas, who agrees to help them on their quest, and Princess Anjelica, who is in love with Tarabas. =Fantaghir√≤ 5 (1996)= Fantaghir√≤ is captured by the Black Witch, who has been unable to perform evil magic ever since she helped Fantaghir√≤ in the previous films. The witch is about to decapitate Fantaghir√≤ when she is suddenly sucked into an alternate reality where she has to join forces with a scoundrel named Aries in defeating a villain who eats children. =Cancelled sequels= The producers planned a further continuation of the series, which would have included two more chapters (sixth and seventh). In these, Fantaghir√≤ would have continue to travel to parallel worlds, including ours, before returning home to find it too an alternative reality where she would face an evil version of herself. Another sequel, Il ritorno di Fantaghir√≤ (The Return of Fantaghir√≤), was considered by Lamberto Bava and Gianni Romoli in 2007. Main characters =Fantaghir√≤= \\"Fantaghir√≤'s castle\\" in 2015 Fantaghir√≤, portrayed by Alessandra Martines, is the main character of all five films. The youngest princess of three, she is outspoken, headstrong and never retreats from battle. In the first film, she is an impulsive troublemaker who likes to provoke her father and sisters, but underneath it she has a good heart. By the second film onwards, she is accepted as a fighter who will do whatever it takes to protect her loved ones, even if that means sacrificing her own life. She is deeply in love with Romualdo, who was previously her kingdom's enemy. They are married in the third film and adopt the orphaned Princess Esmeralda as their daughter. The Fantaghir√≤ has long red-brown hair which she cuts into a boy-cut in the first and second film, but in the third film onwards she only has the boy-cut. Fantaghir√≤ tries to befriend all creatures and people she meets, unless they try to harm those she cares about. She is very forgiving and looks past physical appearances. The role launched Martines' career. =Romualdo= \\"Romualdo's castle\\" in 2009 Romualdo, portrayed by Kim Rossi Stuart, is Fantaghir√≤'s beloved and later husband. After the death of his father, Romualdo seeks to end the centuries-long war his ancestors have waged against Fantaghir√≤'s people by challenging Fantaghir√≤'s father to single combat. He falls in love with her in the first film and becomes obsessed with finding her. He is shocked when he meets her properly for the first time, as she has chosen to replace her father as Romualdo's opponent, and is disguised as a man. Eventually he learns that she is a princess and the two are bethrothed. They are due to be married early in the second film, but the ceremony is postponed when the Black Witch kidnaps Fantaghir√≤'s father. Romualdo becomes the Black Witch's target, and she bewitches him to make him her lover. Romualdo eventually regains his memories thanks to Fantaghir√≤ and the White Witch. In the third film, Romualdo turns into a statue whilst fighting Tarabas' men, and is only revived near the end of the movie, when the pair are finally married. In the fourth film, Stuart did not want to return again for the role, so Romualdo was transformed into the hideously ugly Fiodor, portrayed by Riccardo Serventi Longhi. At the end of the film, Fiodor is transformed back to Romualdo. Romualdo does not appear at all in the fifth film, except in flashback. =The Black Witch= \\"The Black Witch's castle\\" in 2012 The Black Witch (Strega Nera), also known as the Black Queen (Regina Nera), portrayed by Brigitte Nielsen (original Italian dubbing by Aurora Cancian), is the evil counterpart of the White Witch, who first appears in the second film and wants to destroy Fantaghir√≤ and Romualdo's romantic relationship as she obsessively hates their pure love and desires the handsome prince for herself. The witch lures them to her kingdom by kidnapping Fantaghir√≤'s father, casts a spell on Romualdo to make him fall in lustful love with her, and plots to kill Fantaghir√≤. Eventually, Fantaghir√≤ manages to defeat her rival, as the Black Witch is turned to stone and smashed, and then her vengeful remnant inside Romualdo's mind is eradicated by the White Witch. However, her beloved character became so popular that the director decided to revive her even in the next three chapters of the saga. In the third film, her former minions, Bolt and Lightning, decide to resurrect her because Fantaghir√≤ needs her help against Tarabas. Because the Black Witch does help Fantaghir√≤, albeit reluctantly, her evil powers are weakened. In the fourth and fifth films she constantly tries to get back at Fantaghir√≤ so she can be powerful again. She has remained a beloved fan-favorite. =Tarabas= Tarabas, portrayed by Nicholas Rogers (original Italian dubbing by Francesco Prando), is a wizard who appears in the third and fourth films. He is initially a very powerful villain who is feared by magicians in every kingdom, but he discovers a prophecy that a royal child no older than ten years will defeat him. Tarabas becomes obsessed with learning how he will be defeated, and sends his men to kidnap all royal children, during which the parents of young Princess Esmeralda are killed. He crosses paths with Fantaghir√≤ and falls in love with her, eventually asking her to marry him in exchange for reviving Romualdo, who has been turned into stone. In the end, Tarabas lets Fantaghir√≤ free from her promise and the two kiss once before Fantaghir√≤ returns to her true love. He redeems himself with Esmeralda by allowing her to see her parents one last time, an act of kindness which fulfills the prophecy of his dark powers' downfall. Tarabas renounces his evil ways and lives in peace until the fourth film, when he is accused of creating a destructive black cloud consuming all in its path. Tarabas reunites with Fantaghir√≤ to track down the source of the black cloud and discovers that it was conjured by his father, Darken. At the end of the fourth film, Tarabas decides to renounce his love for Fantaghir√≤ and stay with Princess Angelica of Tohor. Other characters Angelica, portrayed by Agathe de La Fontaine, is the princess of the oriental kingdom of Tohor. She has listened to stories of Tarabas from when he was a dark wizard, and has adored him. When she learns that Tarabas is in her kingdom, she finds him and declares her love for him. Tarabas rebuffs her affections throughout the entire movie until the very end, when he promises to try to love her. * Bolt (Saetta), portrayed by Lenca Kubalkova, is a magical sprite and sister of Lightning. Introduced in the second film, she is originally a slave cminion of the Black Witch, but Bolt betrays her and joins the side of good with Fantaghir√≤. In the third film, Bolt says that she and her brother are training to be angels. She can transform into a bolt of lightning and fly in the air. She hates water, and cannot fly if she falls in a river. * Caroline (Carolina), portrayed by Kate≈ôina Bro≈æov√°, is one of the Fantaghir√≤'s sisters. She has golden hair, is a hopeless romantic and is well aware of her beauty, traits that usually infuriate Fantaghir√≤. In the first film she marries Ivaldo, she is pregnant in the second film, and by the third film she has a son. She can briefly be seen in the fourth film, but only at distance, and her face cannot be seen clearly. * Catherine (Caterina), portrayed by Ornella Marcucci in the first film and Barbora Kodetov√° in the second and third films, is the eldest sister of Fantaghir√≤. She is level-headed, wise and patient. She marries Cataldo in the first film, is pregnant in the second film, and has a son in the third film. She has a non-speaking role in the fourth film when their castle is shrunk to the size of a toy, but her face cannot be seen clearly. * Darken, portrayed by Horst Buchholz, is a cruel wizard so powerful that it is forbidden to speak his name. Aside from being the source of all evil in Fantaghir√≤'s world, he is the father of Tarabas, and wants his son to be just as evil as he is. He appears in the fourth film as the main villain who creates a black cloud that causes destruction wherever it goes. He is powerful enough to revive the dead with a kiss, and wields a sword forged from the blood of giants. * Esmeralda (Smeralda), portrayed by Elena D'Ippolito, is a young princess seen in the third film. Her parents are killed when Tarabas' clay soldiers attack under his command to kidnap all the royal children of the world. Fantaghir√≤ takes Esmeralda under her care and eventually adopts her. Esmeralda is playful and headstrong, much like Fantaghir√≤ was in her youth. * Goldeye (Occhio d'Oro), portrayed by Karel Roden, is a minor villain in the second film. He is a bandit who robs anyone he comes across. Fantaghir√≤ humiliates him at the beginning of the film by beating him in armed combat. Later their paths cross again and Goldeye tries to get his revenge by making Fantaghir√≤ dress up as a belly dancer. * The King, portrayed by Mario Adorf, is Fantaghir√≤'s father and appears in the first two films. He is initially disappointed by Fantaghir√≤'s birth, as he had been expecting a son, who would become his heir. His disappointment worsens when she grows up refusing to be meek and obedient as all women in his kingdom are expected to be. However, he grows to care for Fantaghir√≤ over the first film and accepts her as she is. In the second film, he is kidnapped by the Black Witch and is magically hypnotised into becoming the Dark King. * Lightning (Fulmine), portrayed by Jakub Zdenƒõk, is a magical sprite and older brother of Bolt. He starts to rebel against his mistress, the Black Witch, early in the second film, and it is he who instigates Bolt to do the same. In the third film, he and Bolt put all the stone pieces of the Black Witch back together to revive her, but Lightning keeps the witch's heart as leverage. *Cataldo, portrayed by Stefano Davanzati, is one of Romualdo's closest friends. He appears in the first and second films as Romualdo's companion. He's the one who comes up with the idea of holding a swimming competition to reveal Fantaghir√≤'s true gender in the first film. He later falls in love with and marries Catherine. *Ivaldo, portrayed by Tom√°≈° Val√≠k, is one of the Romualdo's closest friends and appears in the first and second films. He later falls in love with and marries Caroline. *Nameless (Senza Nome), portrayed by Remo Girone, is the villain of the fifth film. He is an ogre made of enchanted apalicandro wood, which renders him invulnerable to almost all attacks. Animated with the magic of a hundred witches, Nameless was created in order to end a centuries-long war of attrition, only to rebel against his creators. He travels through different worlds on a flying galleon in order to become more human by feeding on children. His presence alone is enough to transform food items into deadly monsters. *The Queen of the Elves (Regina Degli Elfi), portrayed by A≈àa Geislerov√°, is the Queen of the Forest Elves. She is beautiful and wears a gown of red and gold leaves. In the second film she stops Romualdo and his army who are on the way to the Dark Kingdom. She gives Romualdo three tests to prove his worth, which he succeeds. In the third film, she is visited by Fantaghir√≤, who needs help in breaking a curse that has turned Romualdo into the stone. The Queen of the Elves tells Fantaghir√≤ that the wizard she seeks is Tarabas. *The White Witch (Strega Bianca), portrayed by √Ångela Molina in the first film and Katar√≠na Kolajov√° in the second film, is a good witch and friend of Fantaghir√≤. She has been instrumental in protecting and guiding Fantaghir√≤ ever since she was a baby, although the princess is not always aware of the White Witch's involvement. The White Witch can transform into various animals, including a goose, a mouse and a cat. She also transformed into the White Knight in order to train Fantaghir√≤ in the art of swordsmanship. In the second film, the White Witch renounces her powers in order to free Fantaghir√≤ from a magical promise she had made. Although she does not appear in the later films, early in the third film it is mentioned that she has retired to the country. *Xellesia, portrayed by Ursula Andress, is an evil witch and the mother of Tarabas. She is conniving, wicked, and tries her best to keep her son away from all things good and warm. She appears in the third and fourth films. By the end of the third film, the reformed Tarabas tires of his mother's evil ways and robs her of her powers. In the fourth film, she confesses that she has always loved Tarabas but has had to keep her love hidden from him. She proves this by sacrificing herself so that Tarabas can escape to safety. Production and release history Much of the early series was shot in a park in Lednice, Czechia The series' premise is based on Italo Calvino's Fanta-Ghiro the Beautiful. Director Lamberto Bava said the films were influenced by Legend, Ladyhawke and Willow,Louis Paul, Italian Horror Film Directors. as well as by Disney animated movies and the 1950s fantasy cinema. Initially Fantaghir√≤ was to be a single film but the production costs were excessive and so it was decided to make it as a miniseries. Fantaghiro was produced by Rete Italia and filmed mostly in the former Czechoslovakia; the last two films were shot Thailand and Cuba. The musical score, including the theme song \\"Mio nemico\\" (\\"My Enemy\\"), was written by Amedeo Minghi and performed by Rossana Casale. Kim Rossi Stuart, who has auditioned for the part of Romualdo at the age of 22, after only two films in the TV series already decided to not want to play his character anymore (his appearance in the fourth film is just with stock footage from the first film) and for this reason every sequel in the series has been developed based on the choices of the actors to stay or leave the cast. Brigitte Nielsen said she based her deliberately over-the-top role on the character of the Evil Queen in Disney's Snow White; her role as the Black Witch was received so well by the public that Bava decided to revive the character for three successive chapters of the saga. The character Tarabas was born from the writer Gianni Romo's passion for the comic book series Dylan Dog, where a character of this name appears in one story. The series has been shown in more than 50 countries and was dubbed in several languages, Bulgarian, Czech, Slovak, English, French, Polish, German, Spanish, Hungarian, Ukrainian, Russian, Georgian and Sinhala. Martines gained popularity thanks to the success of Fantaghir√≤ and voiced herself in the French version. The first three films were recut (reduced and intersected with each other) into a 200-minute compilation film titled La meravigliosa storia di Fantaghir√≤ (\\"The Wonderful Story of Fantaghir√≤\\") in 1995. Between December 22, 2011 (20 years to the first airing), and January 30, 2012, the saga was aired on Italia 1 as a television series of 40 episodes lasting 20 minutes each. Its new theme song by Amedeo Minghi and Arianna Bergamaschi, Creder√≤ (\\"I Will Believe\\") was included on the 2011 compilation soundtrack CD Il Fantastico Mondo di Fantaghir√≤ (\\"The Fantastic World of Fantaghir√≤\\"). A restored and remastered edition of the series was released on DVD and Blu-ray in 2016 in Italy, Germany, and France. The sixth and seventh films in the series were never realized due to a dramatic decline of audience recorded during the airing of Fantaghir√≤ 5 on Christmas 1996, and so the project was shelved. A proposal for another sequel was again presented to Mediaset by Bava and Romo in 2007, following the continuous pressure of the fans of the series who were disappointed by how the fifth episode ended. Martines, Nielsen and Rogers confirmed their availability, but the project never came to fruition due to difficulties in co-production and the costs being deemed too high for its realization. Legacy The series' high popularity and cult success during the early 1990s led Bava to make a few other television movies in a similar style for Mediaset, including Desideria e l'Anello del Drago (Desideria), La Principessa e il Povero (The Princess and the Pauper) and Sorellina e il Principe del Sogno (Princess Alisea). It also led to the creation of a 1999-2000 Spanish animated television series by BRB Internacional, also titled Fantaghir√≤ and co-written by Bava. A theme restaurant Fantaghiro opened in Rome in 2001.

If a borrower defaulted on repaying a debt, their creditor would lay a complaint with the sheriff. The sheriff sent his bailiffs, or tipstaffs to arrest the debtor and take him to the local sponging-house. This was not a debtors' prison, as such, but a private house, often the bailiff's own home. The debtor would be held there temporarily in the hope that they could make some arrangement with the creditors. Anthony Trollope set out the system in his novel The Three Clerks of 1857: If debtors could not sort matters out quickly, they were then taken before a court and transferred to a debtor's prison. Sponging-houses had a terrible reputation, which was made clear in a description by Montagu Williams, a London lawyer who knew them well, in his Down East and Up West of 1892: The idea of the sponging-house was based on that of the sponge that gave it its name, which readily gives up its contents on being squeezed. The sponging-house was the place where debtors had any available cash squeezed out of them, partly to the creditor's benefit, but also to that of the bailiff who ran it. In French, ‚Äú√©ponger une dette‚Äù (sponge-up a debt) means to repay one's debt.

Originally formed in 1809, during the Peninsular War, the brigade had a long history, seeing action in the Second Anglo-Afghan War, and during both the First and the Second World Wars. Formation The 1st Division was formed during the Peninsular War in Spain and Portugal, part of the army commanded by General Arthur Wellesley, later 1st Duke of Wellington. In 1814, the 3rd brigade took part in the Battle of New Orleans, commanded by Lt. Gen. John Keane. It also took part in the Battle of Ali Masjid in November 1878 during the Second Anglo-Afghan War. As the Second Boer War ended in 1902 the army was restructured, and a 2nd Infantry division was established permanently as part of the 1st Army Corps, comprising the 3rd and 4th Infantry Brigades. First World War The brigade saw service during the First World War as part of the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front. =Order of battle= The 3rd Brigade was constituted as follows during the war: * 1st Battalion, Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey) (left November 1914) * 1st Battalion, South Wales Borderers * 1st Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment * 2nd Battalion, Welch Regiment * 2nd Battalion, Royal Munster Fusiliers (from November 1914 until February 1918) * 1/4th (Denbighshire) Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers (from November 1914 until September 1915) * 1/6th (Glamorgan) Battalion, Welsh Regiment (from October 1915 until it became the divisional pioneer battalion in May 1916) * 1/9th Battalion, King's Regiment (Liverpool) (November 1915 to January 1916) * 3rd Trench Mortar Battery (formed 27 November 1915) * 3rd Machine Gun Company, Machine Gun Corps (formed 26 January 1916, moved to 1st Battalion, Machine Gun Corps 28 February 1918) Between the wars Between the wars the brigade, now redesignated 3rd Infantry Brigade, saw numerous changes in its battalions, including 2nd Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment, 1st Royal Scots Fusiliers, 1st King's Own Scottish Borderers and 1st Border Regiment. However, these were all posted away by 1937, either to other divisions stationed in the United Kingdom or to different parts of the British Empire. From 1936‚Äì1938 the brigade was commanded by Arthur Floyer-Acland In 1938 they were replaced by 2nd Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment), 2nd Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) and 1st Royal Irish Fusiliers. There was no fourth battalion as it was in this year that British infantry divisions were reduced from twelve to nine battalions, infantry brigades reducing from four to three. These battalions, too, were replaced in early 1939, by 2nd Sherwood Foresters, recently returned from many years spent in British India and Guernsey, 1st Duke of Wellington's Regiment, returned to England from three years spent Malta, and 1st King's Shropshire Light Infantry, which had returned to England in 1938 for the first time after having served in British India in 16 years. Second World War During the Second World War the brigade continued to be part of the 1st Infantry Division, and would remain with it throughout the war, and was sent to France on 25 September 1939, shortly after the outbreak of the war, and served as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France. The brigade was to remain in France, serving alongside the French Army on the Maginot Line on the Franco-Belgian border until May 1940 when the German Army invaded Holland, Belgium and France and, during the fighting, forced the BEF to retreat to Dunkirk where the 3rd Brigade was evacuated to England, arriving on 1 June 1940.Joslen, p. 232. After the retreat from Dunkirk it remained in the United Kingdom on home defence against a German invasion until early 1943 when it was sent to North Africa to take part in the Campaign in Tunisia. On 11 June 1943 the 1st Infantry Division was sent to the Italian island of Pantelleria (Operation Corkscrew) which they captured and occupied without casualties. Men of the 1st Battalion, King's Shropshire Light Infantry eat a meal before going into action at Anzio, Italy, 31 January 1944. In late 1943 the brigade, with the rest of the division, was sent to Italy to join the British Eighth Army fighting in Italy. However, they were soon transferred to command of the U.S. Fifth Army for the Anzio landings (Operation Shingle), where they landed at Anzio on 22 January 1944 and were destined to fight in some of the worst and most violent battles of the Italian campaign where, during a German counterattack on 3 February, the brigade was almost completely surrounded and was only saved from annihilation by a counterattack from the 1st Battalion, London Scottish of 168th (London) Brigade (temporarily detached from its parent unit, the 56th (London) Infantry Division, to come under 1st Division command).Joslen, p. 230. The brigade continued to fight in numerous battles around Anzio and even when not, were still subjected to almost constant artillery, mortar or small arms fire. The brigade fought in the breakout from the Anzio beachhead and Operation Diadem. In October 1944, while the 3rd Brigade was fighting on the Gothic Line with the Eighth Army, Private Richard Henry Burton of the 1st Battalion, Duke of Wellington's Regiment was awarded the Victoria Cross. In the same battle, Captain Arthur Burns was awarded the Distinguished Service Order.Blaxland, p. 216. The brigade fought in Italy until 28 January 1945 when they were sent to Palestine as a garrison where they remained to the end of the war. =Order of battle= The 3rd Infantry Brigade was constituted as follows during the war: * 1st Battalion, Duke of Wellington's Regiment * 1st Battalion, King's Shropshire Light Infantry * 2nd Battalion, Sherwood Foresters * 3rd Infantry Brigade Anti-Tank Company (formed 3 September 1939, disbanded 31 December 1940) =Commanders= The following officers commanded 3rd Infantry Brigade during the war: * Brigadier H.O. Curtis (until 18 December 1939) * Lieutenant Colonel J.M.L. Grover (Acting, from 18 to 28 December 1939) * Brigadier T.N.F. Wilson (from 28 December 1939 until 19 December 1940) * Brigadier W.R.C. Penney (from 19 December 1940 until 26 September 1941) * Lieutenant Colonel R. Bryans (Acting, from 26 September until 20 October 1941) * Brigadier H.A.E. Matthews (from 20 October 1941 until 24 April 1943) * Brigadier R.H. Maxwell (temporary, from 24 to 30 April 1943) * Brigadier J.G. James (from 30 April 1943 until 27 April 1944) * Brigadier E.E. Dorman-Smith (from 27 April until 14 August 1944) * Lieutenant Colonel B.W. Webb-Carter (Acting, from 14 to 26 August 1944) * Brigadier P. St Clair-Ford (from 26 August 1944 until 26 April 1945, again from 16 May 1945) * Lieutenant Colonel W.H. Hulton-Harrop (Acting, from 26 April to 16 May 1945) Post-war As part of 1st Division, the 3rd Brigade was in Egypt after the war until returning to Chiseldon, Wiltshire. During the Suez Crisis the brigade was moved to Malta, in August 1956, from where they went to Egypt on the aircraft carrier HMS Theseus, reaching Port Said just as the ceasefire was declared. It then went on to Cyprus in 1956. Following operations against EOKA, the brigade was disbanded there in 1963. From 1972, the 3rd Infantry Brigade was headquartered in the Kitchen Hill Factory in Lurgan until moving to the Mahon Road Barracks in Portadown in late 1976, under HQ Northern Ireland and was the HQ element for the security forces which controlled the South Armagh region of Ulster, including several battalions of the Ulster Defence Regiment. In September 1981 the brigade was disbanded and its units divided between 8 Brigade and 39 Brigade. The brigade reformed on 1 July 1988 in the Drumadd Barracks in Armagh. The brigade was disbanded once more on 1 September 2004 and its former units again divided between 8 Brigade and 39 Brigade.Tanner, p. 14 In 1989, the 3rd Infantry Brigade had the following structure: *HQ 3rd Infantry Brigade & 203rd Signal Squadron, Royal Signals, Armagh *1st Bn, Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment, Omagh *2nd Bn, Ulster Defence Regiment (V) *11th Bn, Ulster Defence Regiment (V) References Sources * Joslen, Lt-Col H.F.

Early life and education Nora Kershaw was born in Lancashire in 1891, the first daughter of James Kershaw and Emma Clara Booth, married in 1888. Her sister Mabel was born in 1895. She received her undergraduate degree from Newnham College at the University of Cambridge (where she was later an Honorary Life Fellow) and lectured at St Andrews during World War I. She returned to Cambridge in 1919 to study Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse under Professor Hector Munro Chadwick. They were married in 1922. The Chadwicks turned their home into a literary salon, a tradition which Mrs. Chadwick maintained after the death of her husband in 1947. Career Most of her life was spent on research, in her later years primarily on the Celts. She was University Lecturer in the Early History and Culture of the British Isles at the University of Cambridge from 1950 to 1958. She received honorary degrees from the University of Wales, the National University of Ireland and the University of St Andrews, and was made Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1961. The Chadwicks took an interdisciplinary approach and wrote on many topics; they demonstrated influentially the study of multiple \\"early cultures of north-west Europe\\" and brought comparative evidence to bear on heroic literature. Nora Chadwick is best known for her work on the Celts, particularly on the earliest period. Bequest Nora Chadwick died in Cambridge; she left a sum to the University of Cambridge to endow a readership in Celtic Studies. Publications She published the first full English translation of Hervarar saga ok Hei√∞reks together with other sagas and ballads in Stories and Ballads of the Far Past (1921), as well as a translation of the poem Hl√∂√∞skvi√∞a found within Heidrik's saga. * , e-text * With her husband, she published three volume work The Growth of Literature between 1932‚Äì40.  * She also wrote The Beginnings of Russian History, an enquiry into sources (1946).

The municipality existed from 1923 until 1964 when it joined Flora Municipality (now part of Kinn Municipality in Vestland county). The administrative center of the former municipality was the village of Eikefjord, where Eikefjord Church is located. The municipality of Eikefjord was located at the end of the Eikefjorden, about east of the town of Flor√∏. The lake Endestadvatnet was part of the municipality. The municipality encompassed the immediate area around the village of Eikefjord and to the east and south of the village. Name The municipality was named after the old Eikefjord farm () since the Eikefjord Church was located there. The farm is named after the nearby fjord which is located nearby. The fjord name comes from the Old Norse word eiki which means oak wood. History The parish of Eikefjord was established as a municipality on 1 January 1923 when the large municipality of Kinn was divided into three: Kinn (population: 2,508) in the west, Bru (population: 1,560) in the centre, and Eikefjord (population: 929) in the east. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, Eikefjord Municipality (population: 919) was merged with the town of Flor√∏ (population: 2,040), Kinn Municipality (population: 3,567), the parts of Bru Municipality located north of the F√∏rdefjorden (population: 1,155), the Husefest and Breivik areas of Bremanger Municipality (population: 9), and the Steindal area of Vevring Municipality (population: 25) were combined to form the newly created Flora Municipality.

The algorithm is also known as the Von Mises iteration.Richard von Mises and H. Pollaczek-Geiringer, Praktische Verfahren der Gleichungsaufl√∂sung, ZAMM - Zeitschrift f√ºr Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik 9, 152-164 (1929). Power iteration is a very simple algorithm, but it may converge slowly. The most time-consuming operation of the algorithm is the multiplication of matrix A by a vector, so it is effective for a very large sparse matrix with appropriate implementation. The method The power iteration algorithm starts with a vector b_0, which may be an approximation to the dominant eigenvector or a random vector. The method is described by the recurrence relation : b_{k+1} = \\\\frac{Ab_k}{\\\\Ab_k\\\\} So, at every iteration, the vector b_k is multiplied by the matrix A and normalized. If we assume A has an eigenvalue that is strictly greater in magnitude than its other eigenvalues and the starting vector b_0 has a nonzero component in the direction of an eigenvector associated with the dominant eigenvalue, then a subsequence \\\\left( b_{k} \\\\right) converges to an eigenvector associated with the dominant eigenvalue. Without the two assumptions above, the sequence \\\\left( b_{k} \\\\right) does not necessarily converge. In this sequence, : b_k = e^{i \\\\phi_k} v_1 + r_k, where v_1 is an eigenvector associated with the dominant eigenvalue, and \\\\ r_{k} \\\\ \\\\rightarrow 0. The presence of the term e^{i \\\\phi_{k}} implies that \\\\left( b_{k} \\\\right) does not converge unless e^{i \\\\phi_{k}} = 1. Under the two assumptions listed above, the sequence \\\\left( \\\\mu_{k} \\\\right) defined by : \\\\mu_{k} = \\\\frac{b_{k}^{*}Ab_{k}}{b_{k}^{*}b_{k}} converges to the dominant eigenvalue. One may compute this with the following algorithm (shown in Python with NumPy): #!/usr/bin/env python3 import numpy as np def power_iteration(A, num_simulations: int): # Ideally choose a random vector # To decrease the chance that our vector # Is orthogonal to the eigenvector b_k = np.random.rand(A.shape[1]) for _ in range(num_simulations): # calculate the matrix-by-vector product Ab b_k1 = np.dot(A, b_k) # calculate the norm b_k1_norm = np.linalg.norm(b_k1) # re normalize the vector b_k = b_k1 / b_k1_norm return b_k power_iteration(np.array(0.5, 0.5], [0.2, 0.8), 10) The vector b_k to an associated eigenvector. Ideally, one should use the Rayleigh quotient in order to get the associated eigenvalue. This algorithm is used to calculate the Google PageRank. The method can also be used to calculate the spectral radius (the eigenvalue with the largest magnitude, for a square matrix) by computing the Rayleigh quotient :\\\\rho(A) = \\\\max \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\lambda_1, \\\\dotsc, \\\\lambda_n \\\\right \\\\\\\\} = \\\\frac{b_k^\\\\top A b_k}{b_k^\\\\top b_k} = \\\\frac{b_{k+1}^\\\\top b_k}{b_k^\\\\top b_k}. Analysis Let A be decomposed into its Jordan canonical form: A=VJV^{-1}, where the first column of V is an eigenvector of A corresponding to the dominant eigenvalue \\\\lambda_{1}. Since the dominant eigenvalue of A is unique, the first Jordan block of J is the 1 \\\\times 1 matrix [\\\\lambda_1], where \\\\lambda_{1} is the largest eigenvalue of A in magnitude. The starting vector b_0 can be written as a linear combination of the columns of V: :b_{0} = c_{1}v_{1} + c_{2}v_{2} + \\\\cdots + c_{n}v_{n}. By assumption, b_{0} has a nonzero component in the direction of the dominant eigenvalue, so c_{1} e 0. The computationally useful recurrence relation for b_{k+1} can be rewritten as: :b_{k+1}=\\\\frac{Ab_{k}}{\\\\Ab_{k}\\\\}=\\\\frac{A^{k+1}b_{0}}{\\\\A^{k+1}b_{0}\\\\}, where the expression: \\\\frac{A^{k+1}b_{0}}{\\\\A^{k+1}b_{0}\\\\} is more amenable to the following analysis. :\\\\begin{align} b_k &= \\\\frac{A^{k}b_{0}}{\\\\ A^{k} b_{0} \\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{\\\\left( VJV^{-1} \\\\right)^{k} b_{0}}{\\\\\\\\left( VJV^{-1} \\\\right)^{k}b_{0}\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{ VJ^{k}V^{-1} b_{0}}{\\\\ V J^{k} V^{-1} b_{0}\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{ VJ^{k}V^{-1} \\\\left( c_{1}v_{1} + c_{2}v_{2} + \\\\cdots + c_{n}v_{n} \\\\right)}{\\\\ V J^{k} V^{-1} \\\\left( c_{1}v_{1} + c_{2}v_{2} + \\\\cdots + c_{n}v_{n} \\\\right)\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{ VJ^{k}\\\\left( c_{1}e_{1} + c_{2}e_{2} + \\\\cdots + c_{n}e_{n} \\\\right)}{\\\\ V J^{k} \\\\left( c_{1}e_{1} + c_{2}e_{2} + \\\\cdots + c_{n}e_{n} \\\\right) \\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_{1}}{\\\\lambda_{1}} \\\\right)^{k} \\\\frac{c_{1}}{c_{1}} \\\\frac{ v_{1} + \\\\frac{1}{c_{1}} V \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda_1} J \\\\right)^{k} \\\\left( c_{2}e_{2} + \\\\cdots + c_{n}e_{n} \\\\right)}{ \\\\left \\\\ v_{1} + \\\\frac{1}{c_{1}} V \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda_1} J \\\\right)^{k} \\\\left( c_{2}e_{2} + \\\\cdots + c_{n}e_{n} \\\\right) \\\\right \\\\ } \\\\end{align} The expression above simplifies as k \\\\to \\\\infty :\\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda_{1}} J \\\\right)^{k} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} [1] & & & & \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda_{1}} J_{2} \\\\right)^{k}& & & \\\\\\\\\\\\ & & \\\\ddots & \\\\\\\\\\\\ & & & \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda_{1}} J_{m} \\\\right)^{k} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\rightarrow \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & & & & \\\\\\\\\\\\ & 0 & & & \\\\\\\\\\\\ & & \\\\ddots & \\\\\\\\\\\\ & & & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\quad \\\\text{as} \\\\quad k \\\\to \\\\infty. The limit follows from the fact that the eigenvalue of \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda_{1}} J_{i} is less than 1 in magnitude, so :\\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda_{1}} J_{i} \\\\right)^{k} \\\\to 0 \\\\quad \\\\text{as} \\\\quad k \\\\to \\\\infty.

Note that the eigenvector corresponding to the dominant eigenvalue is only unique up to a scalar, so although the sequence \\\\left(b_{k}\\\\right) may not converge, b_{k} is nearly an eigenvector of A for large k. Alternatively, if A is diagonalizable, then the following proof yields the same result Let Œª1, Œª2, ..., Œªm be the m eigenvalues (counted with multiplicity) of A and let v1, v2, ..., vm be the corresponding eigenvectors. Suppose that \\\\lambda_1 is the dominant eigenvalue, so that \\\\lambda_1 > \\\\lambda_j for j>1. The initial vector b_0 can be written: :b_0 = c_{1}v_{1} + c_{2}v_{2} + \\\\cdots + c_{m}v_{m}. If b_0 is chosen randomly (with uniform probability), then c1 ‚â† 0 with probability 1. Now, :\\\\begin{align} A^{k}b_0 &= c_{1}A^{k}v_{1} + c_{2}A^{k}v_{2} + \\\\cdots + c_{m}A^{k}v_{m} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= c_{1}\\\\lambda_{1}^{k}v_{1} + c_{2}\\\\lambda_{2}^{k}v_{2} + \\\\cdots + c_{m}\\\\lambda_{m}^{k}v_{m} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= c_{1}\\\\lambda_{1}^{k} \\\\left( v_{1} + \\\\frac{c_{2}}{c_{1}}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\lambda_{2}}{\\\\lambda_{1}}\\\\right)^{k}v_{2} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{c_{m}}{c_{1}}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\lambda_{m}}{\\\\lambda_{1}}\\\\right)^{k}v_{m}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\to c_{1}\\\\lambda_{1}^{k} v_1 && \\\\left \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_j}{\\\\lambda_1} \\\\right  < 1 \\\\text{ for } j>1 \\\\end{align} On the other hand: : b_k = \\\\frac{A^k b_0}{\\\\A^kb_0\\\\}. Therefore, b_k converges to (a multiple of) the eigenvector v_1. The convergence is geometric, with ratio : \\\\left \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_2}{\\\\lambda_1} \\\\right, where \\\\lambda_2 denotes the second dominant eigenvalue. Thus, the method converges slowly if there is an eigenvalue close in magnitude to the dominant eigenvalue. Applications Although the power iteration method approximates only one eigenvalue of a matrix, it remains useful for certain computational problems. For instance, Google uses it to calculate the PageRank of documents in their search engine, and Twitter uses it to show users recommendations of whom to follow.Pankaj Gupta, Ashish Goel, Jimmy Lin, Aneesh Sharma, Dong Wang, and Reza Bosagh Zadeh WTF: The who-to-follow system at Twitter, Proceedings of the 22nd international conference on World Wide Web The power iteration method is especially suitable for sparse matrices, such as the web matrix, or as the matrix-free method that does not require storing the coefficient matrix A explicitly, but can instead access a function evaluating matrix-vector products Ax. For non-symmetric matrices that are well-conditioned the power iteration method can outperform more complex Arnoldi iteration. For symmetric matrices, the power iteration method is rarely used, since its convergence speed can be easily increased without sacrificing the small cost per iteration; see, e.g., Lanczos iteration and LOBPCG. Some of the more advanced eigenvalue algorithms can be understood as variations of the power iteration. For instance, the inverse iteration method applies power iteration to the matrix A^{-1}. Other algorithms look at the whole subspace generated by the vectors b_k. This subspace is known as the Krylov subspace. It can be computed by Arnoldi iteration or Lanczos iteration.

The episode returns to the scenario of the earlier \\"Far Beyond the Stars\\", in which Benjamin Sisko imagines himself as Benny Russell, a science fiction writer during the mid-twentieth century. The episode's premiere received Nielsen ratings of 4.2 points corresponding to over 4.1 million viewers. Plot Sisko meets Ezri, the new host of the Dax symbiont, before departing Earth for the planet Tyree with his father, Joseph, and son Jake. Ezri wishes to accompany them on their search for Bajor's mythical Orb of the Emissary, which Sisko has been led to believe exists. Back at the station, Kira prepares a blockade to stop the Romulans from arming the weapons they have placed on the Bajoran moon of Derna. On General Martok's Klingon ship, Worf, O'Brien, Bashir, and Quark embark on a mission of their own: to destroy a Dominion shipyard, thus securing a place for the spirit of Worf's dead wife Jadzia in the sacred Klingon afterlife of Sto-Vo-Kor. Sisko and his crew arrive on Tyree. Guided by his visions, they begin a long trek across the vast desert terrain. Eventually, Sisko stops and digs on a seeming whim, while his father, son, and Ezri can only watch. Kira sets her blockade with old Bajoran ships, and fourteen Romulan warbirds arrive early. Neither Kira nor the Romulans appear willing to back down. Back on the Klingon ship, Worf, having reached the star system where the shipyard is located, masterminds a plan in which his vessel will fly dangerously close to the sun and trigger a plasma ejection that will destroy the Dominion facility and illuminate the gates of Sto-vo-kor for Jadzia. The plan seems to fail when they are unable to trigger the plasma ejection. On Tyree, Sisko's digging uncovers an Orb ark, but dangerous visions of Benny Russell cause him to hesitate from exposing the Orb within. Sisko's visions cause him to question his faith, and hastily bury the ark containing the Orb without opening it. Sisko defeats his doubts in his vision, and Ezri forces Sisko to open the ark. But when he does, an energy vortex is unleashed which opens the wormhole and expels from it the Pah-wraiths ‚Äî the enemies of the Prophets ‚Äî who sealed the anomaly. His mission successful, Sisko encounters what appears to be his dead mother Sarah. After commending him, she reveals that she is one of the wormhole aliens (the Bajoran Prophets), who merged with the woman's body years ago to ensure Sisko's birth and the fulfillment of his destiny. With the Prophets freed and the wormhole open, the course of the war shifts. Worf and his comrades manage to execute their plan and demolish the shipyard ‚Äî a victory that finally allows for Jadzia's entrance into Sto-vo-kor. At the same time, Kira successfully causes the Romulans to back down. When the Tyree team return to Deep Space Nine, the Bajoran people praise Sisko for his reopening the wormhole - their Temple of the Prophets. His crew welcome him back, and are perplexed at the arrival of Ezri Dax. Production Outdoor scenes in the desert landscape were filmed at sand dunes in Palmdale, California in the United States.

It was fought between Protestant forces loyal to King James VI of Scotland who were commanded by Archibald Campbell, 7th Earl of Argyll against Catholic forces who were commanded by George Gordon, 6th Earl of Huntly and Francis Hay, 9th Earl of Erroll. The Catholics won a decisive victory in the battle, but in the aftermath were subdued by King James. Background For two centuries from the mid-15th century the Clan Gordon and Clan Campbell controlled the north-east and west of Scotland respectively, as the magnates who straddled the divide between the Scottish Highlands and Scottish Lowlands. James VI of Scotland had been unsure whether to support Catholics or Protestants. This was because the Catholics were still numerous and in particular among the nobility of the north. In 1593 he had sent a secret mission to the Pope with the idea of returning Scotland to the allegiance of Rome. However, in 1594 he once again changed his mind and decided that laws against Catholics would be enforced. Between 1588 and 1595, the northern earls of Huntly, Errol and Angus, who were all Catholics, made overtures to Phillip II of Spain, in revolt against James VI of Scotland. When James discovered this potentially treasonable correspondence with Spain he marched north and sent an advance force under Archibald Campbell, 7th Earl of Argyll, who was still a teenager, to oppose the rebel army under George Gordon, then the 6th Earl of Huntly and Francis Hay, 9th Earl of Errol. The King's army was sent to Gordon country which was the stronghold of the Catholic side. The Earl of Argyll, aged just 19 years, had with him a force of about 12,000 men. He entered into Badenoch and laid siege to Ruthven Castle on 27 September, 1594. In Argyll's army was the Earl of Atholl, Lachlan Mor Maclean, chief of Clan Maclean, the Chief of Clan Mackintosh, the Laird of Grant, the Clan Gregor, MacNeil of Barra, together with the whole of Clan Campbell. Ruthven Castle was well defended by the Clan Macpherson who were vassals of the Earl of Huntly and so the Earl of Argyll had to give up the siege. Following this Argyll marched through Strathspey and on 2 October encamped at Druminnor Castle. From there Argyll sent orders for Lord Forbes, Clan Fraser of Lovat, Clan Dunbar, Clan Mackenzie, Clan Irvine, Clan Ogilvy and the Clan Leslie to join him. The Earls on the opposing side knew that Argyll was a youth with no military experience, whose army was made up of raw and undisciplined militia and which also included a great number of Catholics. As Argyll approached, the Earl of Errol with 100 selected horsemen joined the Earl of Huntly at Strathbogie. Huntly's force now amounted to nearly 1,500 men, mostly horsemen, and from there they advanced to Carnborrow where the two Earls and their followers made the vow to conquer or die. They then marched to Auchindoun arriving the same day. Huntly received intelligence that Argyll was about to descend from the mountains to the lowlands and sent Captain Thomas Carr and a party of horsemen to carry out reconnaissance. They accidentally met Argyll's scouts who they chased and some of whom they killed. Huntly then resolved to attack Argyll before he was joined by the Lord Forbes and the forces which were waiting for his appearance in the lowlands. Argyll passed Glenlivet and reached the banks of a small stream named Alltacoileachan, but he had no idea that Huntly and Errol would attack him with such an inferior force and was therefore astonished to see them approach him. He was apprehensive that Huntly's cavalry would counterbalance his numerical superiority of foot soldiers and so held a council of war to decide if they should attack or retreat to the mountains which were inaccessible to Huntly's horse, and where he could wait until the lowland forces, which were mainly cavalry, would arrive to support him. The council advised Argyll to wait for the King to arrive with his forces to support him, or at least until the Frasers and Mackenizes had arrived from the north, or the Irvines, Forbeses and Leslies from the south. However, Argyll disregarded this decision and was determined to wait for the attack from the enemy and encouraged his men by pointing out how small their enemy was. The battle Argyll positioned his army in two divisions on a hill between Glenlivet and Glenrinnes. On the right wing were the Macleans and Mackintoshes, commanded by Lachlan Maclean and Mackintosh of Mackintosh. On the left wing were the Grants, MacNeils and MacGregors who were commanded by Grant of Gartinbeg. In the centre were the Campbells who were commanded by Campbell of Auchinbreck. This vanguard consisted of 4,000 men, half of whom carried muskets. The rear of the army was commanded by Argyll himself and consisted of about 6,000 men. Huntly's vanguard consisted of 300 men who were led by Errol, Sir Patrick Gordon of Auchindoun, the Gordon Laird of Gight, the Laird of Bonnitoun and Captain Thomas Carr. Huntly followed with the remainder with the Macpherson Laird of Cluny on his right and the Gordon Laird of Abergeldy on his left. Huntly also had three pieces of field artillery under the command of Captain Andrew Gray. Argyll had the advantage of being on a hill and Huntly's forces were further hampered by the moss on the ground and the turf pits that had been dug. However, Huntly still advanced up the hill. He had made arrangements with Campbell of Lochnell who had agreed to join Huntly's side as soon as the battle commenced, before the charge of Huntly's cavalry. Campbell of Lochnell was at enmity with Argyll who had murdered his brother in 1592 and he was also Argyll's nearest heir. However, Campbell of Lochnell was shot dead by the first cannon fire and his men then fled from the field. Argyll's Highlanders had never seen field pieces before and were thrown into disorder and Huntly followed this up by charging at them with his cavalry. Errol was directed to attack the right wing of Argyll's army that was commanded by Maclean. However, this wing was at the top of a steep hill and Errol was annoyed by the thick vollies of shot from above, and so had to make a detour leaving the enemy on his left. Gordon of Auchindoun charged up this steep hill with a small party to attack Maclean, but he was killed doing so. Maclean received repeated assaults but maneuvered his men so well that he succeeded in cutting off Errol from Huntly. However, Huntly came to Errol's assistance and relieved him. The battle continued for two hours. Huntly's horse was shot from underneath him but he was immediately provided with another one. The main body of Argyll's army began to give way and retreat. However, Maclean continued in the field until finding the contest hopeless and also made his retreat. The success of Huntly was mainly due to Campbell of Lochnell's treachery of Argyll and also that of Grant of Gartinbeg who retreated as soon as the action began and was in fact one of Huntly's vassals. This had left the centre and left wing of Argyll's army completely broken. Cairn marking the spot where Patrick Gordon of Auchindoun was killed Argyll's army suffered 500 men killed, including MacNeil of Barra, Campbell of Lochnell and Campbell of Auchinbreck. Huntly's losses were relatively small: fourteen gentlemen were slain including Patrick Gordon of Auchindoun and the Gordon Laird of Gight. The Earl of Errol and a number of others were wounded. Although a battle fought at national level, Glenlivet also incorporated the feud between the Clan Cameron and Clan Mackintosh. Alexander Mackenzie states that Allan Cameron of Lochiel \\"at the head of a few of his clan, he performed signal service against his old enemies, the Mackintoshes, whom he defeated, and pursued with great eagerness, and did Huntly such services as merited a different reward from that which he afterwards received\\". The location of the battlefield is approximately east of Glenlivet. The site of the battle is currently under research, to be inventoried and protected by Historic Scotland under the Scottish Historical Environment Policy of 2009. Aftermath The day following the battle, 4 October, 1594, Huntly and Errol realised that they had no outside support. They assembled with their adherents in Elgin Cathedral where they held the last public celebration of Mass to be held in the Cathedral. There they discussed the situation and Huntly's uncle, who was a Jesuit priest implored his friends and kinsman to remain in their own land. However, King James gathered a considerable force and marched into the disturbed districts with non of the rebel nobles offering resistance to the royal army. A general amnesty followed the leaders' submission, who deserted their men and fled abroad. In early 1595, Errol embarked at Peterhead and Huntly at Aberdeen, for the Continent. As the king headed north he arranged for the houses of Sir John Ogilvie, son of Lord Ogilvie, Sir Walter Lindsay, Old Slains Castle that belonged to Errol and Strathbogie Castle that belonged to Huntly to be razed to the ground, on the pretext that jesuits and priests had been haboured in them. Huntly spent sixteen months travelling through Germany and Flanders after which he was recalled to Scotland where along with Errol and Angus were restored to their former honours by the Parliament held at Edinburgh in November, 1597. Two years later the king elevated the Earl of Huntly to be Marquess of Huntly. John Maclean, a chieftain of the Macleans was mortally wounded but requested to be buried at the nearby Chapel of Downan, which had apparently been destroyed by Argyll's troops before the battle and then later rebuilt. Between 1591 and 1594 the peace in Scotland had been disturbed on several occasions caused by the activities of Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell who was a nephew of the third husband of Mary, Queen of Scots, James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell. This had resulted in the serious revolt of the Catholic dissidents in the north-east. However, with the death of John Maxwell, 8th Lord Maxwell, who was a staunch Catholic, at the Battle of Dryfe Sands in 1593 and the fall of the northern Earls after the Battle of Glenlivet in 1594, the Catholic cause was destroyed. Music connected with the battle The Battle of Glenlivet in 1594 was the last time that the Highland harp was used on the battlefield, finally being discontinued in the Scottish Highlands in about 1734, leaving the Great Highland bagpipe as the instrument of Scottish martial music. A ballad called \\"The Battell of Balrinnes\\" which was written by Patrick Hannay (died c. 1630) was based on the Battle of Glenlivet and in particular Andrew Gray who commanded Huntly's artillery. Another ballad, called \\"Bonnie James Campbell\\" may have been a lament for a man killed in the battle. The oldest known copy of the ballad is in a manuscript held in the Advocates Library in Edinburgh, but its precise age is not known. Several different versions and interpretations of the ballad have since been published. The original manuscript version is as follows: Archaeology A group of standing stones near to the site of the battle are said to have an association with the Battle of Glenlivet, although it is not known when the stones were set.

Buvik existed from 1855 until 1965. The municipality encompassed the extreme northeastern part of what is now the municipality of Skaun in Tr√∏ndelag county. It encompassed the roughly area surrounding the Vigda river south of the Gaulosen fjord. The administrative centre was located in the village of Buvika. History The municipality was established in 1855 when it split off from the larger municipality of Byneset. Initially, Buvik had a population of 841. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the Lang√∏rgen farm area (population: 11) was merged into the neighboring municipality of Melhus. Then, on 1 January 1965, the rest of Buvik (population: 1,267) was merged with the neighboring municipalities of B√∏rsa and Skaun to form a new, larger municipality of Skaun.

She is most famous for creating Blinky Bill, an anthropomorphic koala who was the central character in her books Blinky Bill: the Quaint Little Australian (1933), Blinky Bill Grows Up (1934) and Blinky Bill and Nutsy (1937). Most of her books were first published by Angus & Robertson. Biography Wall was born in Kilbirnie, New Zealand on 12 January 1894 of English parents, Charles James William Wall and Lillian n√©e Palethorpe.Australian Dictionary of Biography, Online Edition In 1904, at the age of ten, she won scholarships for her art . She migrated to Australia in 1914 and worked for The Sun newspaper in Sydney. In 1920 her first children's story \\"Tommy Bear and the Zookies\\" was published and the following year she married Andrew Delfosse Badgery.Sydney Morning Herald 30 December 2009.

Born onscreen in 1989, the character was played by several child actors, most notably by Justin Cooper from 1996 to 1998 and Logan O'Brien from 1998 to 2002. The character was rapidly aged in 2002 and Evan Bonifant took over the role briefly before he was replaced by C.J. Thomason who last appeared in 2003. The role was recast with Ryan Carnes in 2004. Carnes left the role in 2005, and was replaced by Ben Hogestyn. Hogestyn left the series in 2006. In late 2013, it was announced that Carnes would reprise the role in the new year. Lucas is the adopted son of Dr. Tony Jones and his ex-wife, Bobbie Spencer, the biological son of crime lord Julian Jerome, and Cheryl Stansbury. As an infant, Lucas is at the center of a bitter custody battle between former friends, Bobbie and Tiffany Hill, Cheryl's sister. Under head writer, Robert Guza, Lucas is very close with his adoptive cousins, Maxie and Georgie Jones. In 2005, Lucas became the first character in General Hospital history to earn his Ph.D. After Tony's death in early 2006, the character was written out of the series. In 2013, Lucas became a subject of conversation again when it was revealed that Julian was actually alive, and Lucas is contacted by his new-found sister Sam for a DNA test. Casting The role was briefly played by Nicholas Moody in 1989 upon the character's onscreen birth. The role was portrayed by siblings, Kenny and Chuckie Gravino from 1992 to 1994. The Gravino siblings had previously appeared on The Young and the Restless as Phillip Chancellor IV. Jay Sacane appeared in the role from 1994 to 1996. Justin Cooper took over the role from 1996 to 1998. Logan O'Brien stepped into the role in August 1998. O'Brien left the series in 2002. Evan Bonifant stepped into the role on September 6, 2002, when the character was rapidly aged. Bonifant made his final appearance on December 18, and was quickly replaced by C.J. Thomason. Thomason made his debut on December 24, 2002. Thomason made his final appearance on June 11, 2003. In 2004, the role was recast and Ryan Carnes stepped into the role. Ryan Carnes first auditioned for the role in May 2004. Carnes auditioned for a third time on June 2, 2004 and filmed his first scenes on June 16. At the time, Carnes was on vacation in Hawaii when he was called back to California for his final audition. However, his car broke down on the way to his audition. Fortunately, he was able to get a ride with his acting coach. After the audition, Carnes returned to his car and was forced wait another three hours to have his car towed. During his wait, Carnes learned he had booked the recurring role of Lucas with his first air date slated for July 8, 2004. In 2005, it was announced Carnes would depart the series and would be replaced by Ben Hogestyn, just before Lucas revealed his sexuality. According to TV Guide, Carnes was allegedly fearful of being typecast in gay roles, due to his previous work on television series, Desperate Housewives and the film Eating Out. A representative for the actor claimed Carnes had already planned to leave the series due several upcoming gigs, but chose to vacate the role earlier before the series delved into Lucas's storyline instead of having the role recast in the middle of the story. Carnes last appeared on September 21, and Hogestyn stepped into the role on September 22. Hogestyn, who was only with the show on a recurring status, left in 2006 to pursue a full-time role on The Bold and the Beautiful. According to then writer Dave Goldschmid, the role was supposed to be recast at some point, but the recast never happened. In May 2013, General Hospital Happenings reported the producers had put out several casting calls, one of which was for the role of Lucas. In October 2013, SoapZone.com reported the role had been cast and the new hire was a \\"hot commodity.\\" The casting call, which lasted for several months was reportedly cancelled in mid November 2013. Starting on December 4, 2013, through Twitter, Ryan Carnes began referencing various locations with the word \\"Port\\" in the names. In December 2013, executive producer, Frank Valentini confirmed to Soaps In Depth that Ryan Carnes would reprise the role of Lucas. Following the announcement, Carnes updated his Twitter with the simple message: \\"Ah, Port Charles, it is!\\" Carnes filmed his first return scenes on December 11, 2013. Carnes first episode was slated for January 16, 2014, but was pushed back to January 17 due to news coverage. In response to bringing Carnes back to the role, Valentini said it was important to maintain continuity of who had previously played Lucas. Valentini contacted Carnes after casting director Mark Teschner sent him Carnes's audition reel. Head writer, Ron Carlivati said he was the most familiar face, and he also shared a resemblance to William DeVry, who played Julian, \\"and it just made sense.\\" Carnes said he was quite shocked by the offer to reprise the role. A friend of Ryan Carnes', who was also a fan of the show saw the onscreen events on unfolding and told Carnes that he expected Lucas coming back to the canvas. The casting department contacted Carnes's agent by email and asked if he was interested. Development =Teen years (2002‚Äì2006)= From 2002 to 2006, Lucas is integrated into a group of younger characters which consist of his adoptive cousins, Maxie (Robyn Richards) and Georgie (Lindze Letherman). Lucas (Thomason) and Georgie even dated briefly in high school, and he took her to prom only for Maxie to ruin their date. Though they were not biologically related, neither pairing caught on with fans. Lucas (Carnes) later dated Brook Lynn Ashton (Adrianne Le√≥n) while he supported Georgie during her troubled romance with Dillon Quartermaine (Scott Clifton). In late August 2005, TV Guide revealed the series had planned a Coming out story for the character of Lucas. With the announcement of Carnes's departure shortly after, a rep said the storyline would be a main focus that would affect the entire canvas. On October 11, 2005 (National Coming Out Day), Lucas announces to Georgie he is gay. The storyline is dropped due to Hogestyn's departure and Lucas is written off canvas in early 2006. =Return (2014)= In July 2013, General Hospital Happenings reported that Zeman's next visit as Bobbie would bring Lucas home. Though it had yet to be mentioned onscreen, the website said Lucas was now a doctor, and with a recommendation from Dr. Kevin Collins (Jon Lindstrom), he transfers to General Hospital. He was also rumored to share a past with Dr. Silas Clay (Michael Easton). Despite no confirmation from the series, Instinct published a report which stated Lucas had attended medical school in Seattle. The character's return also brings attention to the ongoing mob storyline which features Lucas's former brother-in-law Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) and his biological family the Jeromes. In the fall of 2013, Lucas agrees to a DNA test which proves he and Sam Morgan (Kelly Monaco) are paternal half-siblings. Later, an angry Sam accidentally mentions Lucas to Julian (William DeVry), prompting Julian to look into their connection. Ron Carlivati said bringing back the character of Lucas became necessary when William deVry took over the role of Julian. They stuck with the original onscreen events, in which Julian never learns of Lucas's existence. Carlivati said Lucas is a very \\"central character\\" because he is related to majority of the canvas. In an interview with Michael Fairman of On-Air On- Soaps, Carnes said that Lucas feels a bit out of place and knowing Tony always accepted him, Lucas goes to the cemetery to \\"commune with his spirit.\\" However, according to Carnes, finding Julian, his biological father, in the place where he visits the only father he's ever know, sets up an \\"instant conclift.\\" So the confrontation is already happening occurring on \\"shaky ground.\\" In an interview with Soap Opera Digest, Carnes said that Lucas is \\"quite comfortable with who he is and with his sexuality.\\" However, discovering that Julian is alive is an \\"emotional upheaval,\\" Carnes said. Telling Julian that he is gay is Lucas's way of testing Julian, \\"to see what he's made of.\\" Despite Lucas being very sure of himself, Lucas views Julian's \\"lack of support,\\" as \\"rejection.\\" Lucas struggles with Julian's reaction and \\"spirals a bit,\\" Carnes said. The actor looked forward to seeing how the \\"human situation\\" between Julian and Lucas would develop, it would help those who could identify with the situation. =Romances (2014‚Äìpresent)= According to Bobbie (Jacklyn Zeman), as of 2013, Lucas resides in Seattle, Washington and had still not found the right guy. The character's return sets up a romantic triangle between Lucas, Felix DuBois (Marc Anthony Samuel) and Brad Cooper (Parry Shen). In an interview with On-Air On-Soaps published on December 26, 2013, Carlivati confirmed that Lucas would definitely become a factor in the budding relationship between Brad and Felix. When it comes to Lucas and Brad, Carnes said, \\"how many times do we meet people who really and truly can understand our unique life experience, and get us on so many levels, and particularly, with these guys whose biological fathers are gangsters, and they're gay, they have to deal with acceptance and non-acceptance of their sexuality with their families.\\" The \\"extremely unique\\" set of circumstances makes Lucas and Brad, \\"kindred spirits.\\" On January 28, 2014, ABC Daytime sent a press release which revealed that Lucas accepts Felix's invite to go out on Valentine's Day. Carnes remained tight lipped on how Lucas ends up going on a date with Felix, but maintained that Lucas and Brad have a real connection. Storylines =1989‚Äì2001= Upon his birth in 1989, Victor Jerome (Jack Axelrod) arranges for the baby to be sold on the black market, leading Cheryl (Jennifer Anglin) to believe her son died at birth.

At the time, Lucas is believed to be Cheryl's son with Robert Scorpio (Tristan Rogers), who becomes Lucas's godfather when the boy is christened in 1989. Bobbie and Tony marry shortly after. Meanwhile, the Jerome family lawyer, Mark Broxton, hides Lucas's identity in a secret file called the \\"Billion Dollar Baby.\\" Cheryl admits Julian is Lucas's father.

Lucas tricks Kyle into believing Maxie is pregnant to force him into telling the truth. Lucas is worried when Georgie falls for Dillon Quartermaine, thinking he will hurt her. Meanwhile, Lucas disapproves when Maxie forgives Kyle after he humiliates her even further. Georgie and Lucas plan to spend prom night together, but Maxie schemes to get Georgie to see them making out. Georgie is devastated and cuts both Lucas and Maxie out of her life. Lucas is later sent off to boarding. Upon his return, Lucas begins dating Brook Lynn Ashton. Meanwhile, Georgie recruits Lucas to help teach Dillon about treating women as sexual objects. Lucas hits on Dillon, who is dressing in drag for an all- female band. However, Brook Lynn comes to Dillon's rescue. Lucas defends himself saying he'd do anything for Georgie. Georgie kisses Lucas to make Dillon jealous, destroying their relationships with both Dillon and Brook Lynn. However, Lucas and Brook Lynn rekindle their romance when they trapped at the Quartermaine mansion due to a serial killer going on the loose. Lucas helps Brook Lynn accept her new makeover for her singing career, He accompanies her to a school dance where they share their first kiss. Lucas and Brook Lynn eventually break up.

Lucas later moves to Seattle, Washington. =2014‚Äìpresent= Lucas returns to Port Charles when Bobbie informs him Carly (Laura Wright) is missing. Lucas sees Sam for the first time since the revelation about their connection, and is shocked to find Julian alive and well. Lucas rejects Julian and finds comfort in the arms of Brad Cooper (Parry Shen). That relationship comes to a screeching halt, however, when Brad blurts out the truth about Britt's \\"baby\\" - it's actually Dante and Lulu's. After Julian's initial lack of support, he eventually accepts Lucas and tries to form a relationship. Julian invites Lucas, Sam, Silas, and Alexis to a dinner at the art gallery to announce his leaving the crime business. Lucas brings Felix along as a date. During the dinner a gunman hired by Julian's boss, the imposter Luke Spencer, is able to disguise himself as a waiter and shoots Lucas. His injuries are critical and he is rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery. After the surgery, the imposter Luke Spencer attempts to kill Lucas but Julian arrives in time to stop him. While in the hospital recovering, Felix and Brad fight over who will take care of him. Bobbie comes in and throws them both out. Lucas, while still recovering, consoles Felix who is distraught after the death of Sabrina Santiago and Patrick Drake's premature child. A jealous Brad sees this and overreacts, but Lucas tells him to back off. In May 2015, Brad asks Lucas to marry him. In September 2015, it is revealed that Brad is married to Rosalie Martinez and were forced to marry each other so that neither would go to jail.

Brad frantically takes the baby to the hospital but runs into his friend, Nelle Benson, on the side of the road. She is on the run from the police and has just given birth to her son, whose father is Lucas's nephew, Michael Corinthos. They agree to switch babies as Nelle convinces Brad that he and Lucas would be better parents than she would since she is likely to go to jail. Brad brings Nelle and Michael's baby home to take the place of the dead adopted baby and Lucas meets his son which they name Wiley Cooper-Jones. After a family gathering, Lucas and Brad find out that the birth mother wants to cancel the adoption. Brad tells Julian about the baby switch and that the adoption has to go through by any means. Julian agrees to help and convinces the birth mother to let the adoption stand. The mother agrees and the adoption is finalized. Reception Following Hogestyn's sudden departure, many fans were left wondering what happened to the character. Former GH writer, Dave Goldschmid described the fan response to Lucas \\"coming out\\" as \\"heartwarmingly positive.\\" In April 2013,Soaps In Depth described Hogestyn's portrayal of Lucas as \\"sensitive,\\" and suggested Hogestyn along with Zack Conroy, Van Hansis and Shawn Pyfrom would all be a good fit for the role of Lucas. In November 2010, Jamey Giddens also pushed for the character's return with Hansis in the role, thinking the soap could capitalize on the actor's huge fan base from As the World Turns. Fan were thrilled by the announced of Carnes's return. Jillian Bowe said \\"Who Will Ryan Carnes Be Eating Out as General Hospital's Lucas?\\" referencing Carnes's role in the gay romantic comedy. Many expected the announcement due to heavy references of the character onscreen. With the announcement of Carnes's return, TheBacklot.com said the character's return couldn't come soon enough. Errol Lewis of Soap Opera Network commented the character's return would allow for the existing gay characters to step out of their supporting roles, and would also bring a lot of media attention to the series like the pairing of Will and Sonny did for NBC's Days of Our Lives. Instinct magazine said \\"Lucas's return to the hospital-based soap is just what the doctor ordered!\\" Greg Hernandez said Carnes's return was enough to make him watch General Hospital on the daily basis. Soaps In Depth pushed for Lucas to be paired with Felix in April 2013 and even gave the potential pairing the nickname, \\"Lulix.\\" References External linksLucas Jones profile Soapcentral.com Category:General Hospital characters Category:Fictional adoptees Category:Fictional gay males Category:Television characters introduced in 1989 Category:Fictional surgeons Category:Fictional LGBT characters in television Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Lucas Jones"},{"id":"5975622","text":"Jennings Carmichael (24 February 1867 ‚Äì 9 February 1904) was an Australian poet and nurse. Life Grace Elizabeth Jennings Carmichael was born on 24 February 1867 at Ballarat, Victoria. The daughter of Archibald Carmichael, a miner from Perthshire, Scotland and Margaret Jennings, n√©e Clark, from Cornwall. She was educated at Melbourne, while still a child went to live on a station at Orbost, and grew up close to the bush she came to love so much. In 1888 she went to Melbourne to be trained as a nurse at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne. In 1891, Carmichael published a small volume of prose sketches, Hospital Children. Having qualified as a nurse she obtained a position on a station near Geelong, and subsequently married Francis Mullis. She contributed verse to the Australasian, and in 1895 Poems by Jennings Carmichael was published. Carmichael was a member of the Austral Salon in the 1890s giving a public lecture on \\"The Spirit of the Bush\\" in September 1895 at the Masonic Hall in Melbourne with Alfred Deakin as chairman. Carmichael lived for a time in South Australia and then went to London, where she died of pneumonia in poor circumstances in 1904. In 1910 a small selection of her poems was published, in 1937 a plaque to her memory was unveiled at Orbost, and a year later a replica was placed in the public library at Ballarat. Two of Jennings Carmichael's sons were present at the ceremony. Jennings Carmichael wrote much good and pleasant verse with occasional touches of poetry. Brunton Stephens called Miss Carmichael the Jean Ingelow of Australia. Comparisons of this kind have little value, but it may be said that Miss Carmichael's position in relation to the leading Australian poets, is not dissimilar to that of Miss Ingelow in comparison with Robert Browning and Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson.

He works in a bowling alley to save up enough money to buy it. Rick grows up to be an outstanding musician (adult Rick played by Kirk Douglas), tutored by jazzman Art Hazzard (Juano Hernandez). He lands a job playing for the big band of Jack Chandler, getting to know the piano player Smoke Willoughby (Hoagy Carmichael) and the beautiful singer Jo Jordan (Doris Day). Chandler orders him to always play the music exactly as written. Rick prefers to improvise, and one night, during a break with Chandler's band, he leads an impromptu jam session, which gets him fired. Jo has fallen for Rick and finds him a job in New York with a dance orchestra. One night, her friend Amy North (Lauren Bacall) accompanies her to hear Rick play. Amy, studying to be a psychiatrist, is a complicated young woman still disturbed by her own mother's suicide. She claims to be incapable of feeling love, but Rick and she begin an affair, which consumes him so completely, he begins to slip away from his old friends. Jo eventually tries to warn him against getting too involved with Amy, suggesting that she will hurt him because \\"way inside she's all mixed up\\", but Amy arrives while Jo is talking to Rick, and the two are revealed to be already married. Jo hopes he will forgive her words. Amy does not enjoy Rick's music and is not particularly interested in his career. She decides to return to her studies to become a doctor. Rarely together at the same time because of their demanding schedules, they begin to quarrel; it soon becomes evident to Rick that Amy sometimes does not even come home at night. All this affects Rick profoundly; his mood deteriorates and he begins drinking. Art Hazzard finds him in a bar and tries gently to offer advice and help. Rick feels guilty that he has let their friendship slide, but he takes his frustrations out on Art, this man who has done so much for him. Rick does not know that when Art leaves the bar, he is struck by a car and severely injured. Later, arriving late for his job at the club, Rick hears about Art and rushes to the hospital. Before he can see him, however, he is told that Art has died. At home, Rick finds Amy restlessly playing piano. She tells him she failed her finals and that now she is considering perhaps trying again or maybe going to Paris, with a young woman artist she has met, and becoming a painter. She fairly admits marrying him was in her mind simply something to try, and that she is jealous of the security Rick has in knowing what he is good at and being able to do it. She slaps him when he softens toward her and offers comfort. The next night, after Art's funeral, Rick returns home at the end of a cocktail party Amy has thrown. She is drunk and supposedly angry at him for not showing up to meet her friends. They argue viciously and he tells her she is sick and should see a doctor. He says he has a new experience to offer her, that of him leaving her. Rick becomes an alcoholic who gets fired from the orchestra and neglects his music. At a recording session with Smoke and Jo, he plays erratically and loses control of his instrument, trying to reach a magic note he has dreamed of. He destroys his horn and drops out of sight, wandering aimlessly, getting thrown out of bars. One night, he collapses in the street and a cab driver takes him to an alcoholic sanitarium. He has pneumonia, however, and the officials there call Smoke, who arranges for Rick to be moved to a hospital. Jo hurries to his side and helps him recover his health, and both his love of music and of her‚Äîa happy ending found neither in the novel nor in the life of Bix Beiderbecke. Cast Third Avenue El in background. * Kirk Douglas as Rick Martin * Lauren Bacall as Amy North * Doris Day as Jo Jordan * Hoagy Carmichael as Willie 'Smoke' Willoughby * Juano Hern√°ndez as Art Hazzard * Jerome Cowan as Phil Morrison * Mary Beth Hughes as Marge Martin * Nestor Paiva as Louis Galba * Walter Reed as Jack Chandler * Jean Spangler as an uncredited extra Subtext The film is notable as being an example of 1940s film noir with a central character who is bisexual. In the Baker novel, Amy is described as having lesbian tendencies, and using the usual Hollywood connotative methods and hints to circumvent the Motion Picture Production Code, this is also implied in the film. Regarding Jo, Amy says: \\"It must be wonderful to wake up in the morning and know just which door you‚Äôre going to walk through. She‚Äôs so terribly normal.\\" Production notes Composer-pianist Hoagy Carmichael, playing the sidekick role, added realism to the film and gave Douglas an insight into the role, being a friend of the real Beiderbecke. Famed trumpeter Harry James performed the music Kirk Douglas is shown playing on screen. In her authorized biography, Doris Day described her experience making the film as \\"utterly joyless\\", as she had not found working with Douglas to be pleasant. In the book, Douglas said that he felt her ever-cheerful persona was only a \\"mask\\" and he had never been able to get to know the real person underneath. Day countered that while Douglas had been \\"civil\\", he was too self-centered to make any real attempt to get to know either her or anyone else. Reception According to The New York Times, \\"banalities of the script are quite effectively glossed over in the slick pictorial smoothness of Michael Curtiz's direction and the exciting quality of the score. The result is that there is considerable good entertainment in Young Man With a Horn despite the production's lack of balance.\\" In spite of the screenplay, the Times praised the performances of Douglas, Day, and Carmichael, but noted \\"the unseen star of the picture is Harry James, the old maestro himself, who supplies the tingling music, which flows wildly, searchingly, and forlornly from Rick Martin's beloved horn. This is an instance where the soundtrack is more than a complementary force. It is the very soul of the picture because if it were less provocative and compelling, the staleness of the drama could be stultifying.\\" Radio adaptation Young Man with a Horn was presented on Lux Radio Theatre March 3, 1952. Kirk Douglas recreated his role from the film. The one-hour adaptation also starred Jo Stafford and Patrice Wymore.

It was first broadcast on June 10, 1998. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures on Deep Space Nine, a space station located near a stable wormhole between the Alpha and Gamma quadrants of the Milky Way Galaxy. In this episode, the Defiant answers a call for help from a stranded Starfleet officer, while back at the station, Quark attempts to distract Odo so that he can conduct a smuggling operation. Debra Wilson guest stars. A new Defiant hosted shuttlecraft design, the Chaffee is featured in CGI. The episode's premiere received Nielsen ratings of 4.1 points corresponding to about 4.05 million viewers. Plot While traveling home from an escort mission, the crew of the USS Defiant receive a distress call from Captain Lisa Cusak (voiced by Debra Wilson), a Starfleet officer stranded on an alien world by herself, after her ship has been destroyed by actively scanning a strange planet. After working a means to communicate with her, they discover that she is stranded on a Class L world with a high concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that will eventually kill her without regular doses of \\"triox\\" medication, and her supplies of it are running low. Dr. Bashir (Alexander Siddig) tells her to cut her dose such that she will survive the six days that it will take the Defiant to reach the planet. In turn, Captain Cusak asks that they keep a constant conversation going with her to keep her alert and to make her feel less isolated. As they travel, each of the crew becomes closer to Captain Cusak as they discuss their own personal problems with her. When Dr. Bashir discovers that Cusak's supply of triox is more critical than they thought, Captain Sisko (Avery Brooks) orders the phaser bank power to be routed to structural stability controls to increase the Defiant's speed. They arrive at the planet shortly after Cusak has fallen unconscious, giving them a limited amount of time to find her. After figuring out how to get their shuttlecraft past a strange energy field that surrounds the planet, the crew finds Cusak dead, deep in a cave, and that Cusak has been dead for roughly three years. O'Brien (Colm Meaney) theorizes that the energy field caused their communications to travel through time. Sisko orders them to collect Cusak's body and gives her a proper burial back on Deep Space Nine as a Starfleet officer and trusted friend. Meanwhile, Quark (Armin Shimerman) talks Odo (Ren√© Auberjonois) into preparing an extravagant celebration to end his first month with Major Kira (Nana Visitor). He tells Jake Sisko (Cirroc Lofton), who is writing a story about criminals, that while Odo is occupied he will sell rare crystals for profit. However, Odo decides to change his romantic evening for the following night, ruining Quark's plan. Taking pity on him, Odo decides to let him off this one time and has his evening with Kira when he originally planned.

History During the Boer War, the 5th Infantry Brigade, known as the Irish Brigade, fought in the Battle of Colenso under Major General Arthur Fitzroy Hart. It consisted of the 1st Royal Dublin Fusiliers, 1st Inniskilling Fusiliers, 1st Connaught Rangers, and the 1st Border Regiment. Following the end of the Boer war in 1902 the army was restructured, and a 3rd Infantry division was established permanently at Bordon as part of the 1st Army Corps, comprising the 5th and 6th Infantry Brigades.Rinaldi, p. 31 The brigade was part of the 2nd Division during the First World War and was one of the first British units to be sent overseas on the outbreak of war. The brigade became part of the British Expeditionary Force and saw action on the Western Front in the Battle of Mons and the subsequent Great Retreat and at the First Battle of Ypres, which saw the old Regular Army virtually destroyed. During the Second World War, the 5th Brigade was again part of the 2nd Infantry Division and was sent to France in 1939 shortly after the outbreak of war, where it joined the British Expeditionary Force. It served on the Franco-Belgian border until May 1940, when it was evacuated at Dunkirk after fighting in the short but fierce battles of France and Belgium in which the German Army nearly cut off the entire BEF from the French Army.Delaforce, p. 127 With the division, the brigade remained in Britain on home defence until 10 April 1942, when it was shipped out to India to fight the Imperial Japanese Army after a series of disasters suffered by the British and Indian troops stationed there. The 5th Brigade served with the 2nd Infantry Division in the Burma Campaign under General Slim's British Fourteenth Army and fought in the Battle of Kohima, which managed to help turn the tide of the campaign in the Far East. =First World War Order of Battle= The brigade was part of 2nd Division. The brigade commanded the following units in the First World War: * 2nd Battalion, Worcestershire Regiment (transferred to 33rd Division on 15 December 1915) * 2nd Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry * 2nd Battalion, Highland Light Infantry * 2nd Battalion, Connaught Rangers (transferred to 3rd (Lahore) Division on 26 November 1914) * 1/9th Battalion, (Glasgow Highlanders), Highland Light Infantry (November 1914 to January 1916) * 2nd Battalion, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers (January to July 1915) * 1st Battalion, Queen's (Royal West Surrey Regiment) (July to December 1915)* 1/7th Battalion, King's (Liverpool Regiment) (September to November 1915)* 17th (Service) Battalion (Empire), Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment) (December 1915 to February 1918) * 24th (Service) Battalion (2nd Sportsman's), Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment) (from December 1915) * 5th Machine Gun Company (from 1 January 1916 to 4 March 1918\\") * 5th Trench Mortar Battery (from March 1916\\") =Second World War Order of Battle= The brigade commanded the following units in the Second World War: * 2nd Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment (until 5 February 1940) * 2nd Battalion, Dorsetshire Regiment * 1st Battalion, Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders * 7th Battalion, Worcestershire Regiment (from 5 February 1940) =Commanders= Notable commanders included: * 1938-1941 Brigadier G.I.

In the early 1980s, the Field Force concept was dropped in favour of traditional Brigades; 5th Infantry Brigade was reformed at Aldershot in January 1982 by the redesignation of 8th Field Force. The Brigade consisted of the former elements of the Parachute Contingency Force (PCF) from 6 Field Force (which became the 1st Infantry Brigade), at the time 2 PARA, together with a second Parachute Battalion from 8 Field Force (3 PARA).  Falklands War  The Brigade was sent to the Falklands in 1982 as the follow-on force to 3rd Commando Brigade. Having had its two Parachute Regiment battalions withdrawn to reinforce 3 Commando Brigade, it was hurriedly reconstituted with two Guards battalions pulled from Public duties in London and 63 Sqn RAF Regiment (based at Gutersloh, Germany) to initially provide additional Short Range Air Defence (SHORAD) of land forces landing at San Carlos.

The novel was adapted for the movie Young Man With a Horn (1950) with Kirk Douglas, Doris Day, Lauren Bacall, Juano Hern√°ndez, and real-life Bix Beiderbecke friend and collaborator Hoagy Carmichael Plot introduction It is a fictionalized novel on jazz set in a world of speakeasies and big bands during The Jazz Age of the 1920s. It is loosely based on the life of the great cornet player Bix Beiderbecke who died of alcoholism in 1931 at the age of 28. It tells the story of Rick Martin, a tormented genius from childhood until his death at age 30. The racial component of jazz is addressed. Ever since the first jazz record was released in 1917 by the white band The Original Dixieland Jazz Band, race has been an inherent issue in the new musical genre of jazz. In the wake of the success of the ODJB, both white and black musicians and bands emerged. The story also dwells on the white/black abilities to play jazz. Rick, however, establishes a strong relationship with white and black musicians. The book details both the widely accepted public view of the jazz musician of the time as well as a musician's own struggle for perfection. This drive finally destroys Rick!

Professional career  Suppelsa's first job out of college was at WFRV-TV in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where he became an anchor after six months on the job. In 1987, Suppelsa took a job at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis-Saint Paul, where he worked as an anchor and a reporter. In July 1993, Suppelsa joined WMAQ-TV in Chicago as a weekend anchor and reporter. He later became a late afternoon and early evening news anchor. In May 1997, Suppelsa memorably sparred with talk-show host Jerry Springer during WMAQ's 10 p.m. newscast, shortly after Springer resigned after a brief, controversial run as a commentator. In March 2003, Suppelsa quit WMAQ-TV to join WFLD-TV in Chicago as a reporter, fill-in anchor and investigative reporter. In September 2004, WFLD promoted Suppelsa to be the co-anchor of WFLD's Fox News Chicago at Nine in Chicago, at the same time demoting Walter Jacobson from the co-anchor position. On March 10, 2008, Suppelsa chose not to renew his contract with WFLD-TV.Rosenthal, P. \\"Ch. 32's Suppelsa leaves station\\", Chicago Tribune, March 11, 2008. Suppelsa reportedly turned down a contract offer from Channel 32 that would have cut his salary by about 15 percent.Channel 2 cuts top anchors - Newspaper and Magazine, Chicago Sun-Times, American Idol - chicagotribune.com Once the 90-day \\"right to match\\" clause in Suppelsa's old contract expired, he became free to announce a new job in TV. He signed a contract deal with WGN-TV to anchor the 9 pm news replacing Steve Sanders (who now anchors the midday newscast from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.) Sanders replaced Tom Negovan, who became a full-time general assignment reporter and back-up anchor for all WGN newscasts. Suppelsa also formerly worked as a morning news anchor on the Eric and Kathy Show on WTMX-FM radio in Chicago. He says it was truly one of the most enjoyable highlights of his working time in Chicago...except for the 4:25am alarm clock each morning. He says, he quit the radio show in October 2010 because it was simply too many duties to handle in a day after he convinced WGN-TV to hire away his prized investigative producer to work on stories for television. On December 8, 2017, Suppelsa retired from WGN ending his 39-year career in the news business. He stated his reason for retiring was that he wanted to spend more time with his family. On February 13, 2018, it was announced that Joe Donlon of NBC-affiliate KGW would succeed Suppelsa on the WGN evening news.  Personal  Suppelsa met his wife, Candus, while working in Minneapolis in 1988, according to a Chicago Tribune article that appeared on June 29, 1997. Today, Mark and Candus live in Evanston, Illinois with their two children. Suppelsa also is a vegetarian, according to an article in the Chicago Sun-Times on September 7, 2004. Suppelsa is a Facebook and Twitter user and is usually logged on during broadcasts. He frequently updates his status and chat with fans and friends while on the air. On May 4, 2012, Suppelsa announced that he would be taking a break from his job at WGN to enter a monthlong alcohol rehabilitation program.https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-wgntv-news- anchor-mark-suppelsa-takes-break-for-rehab-20120504,0,457618.story  References   External links  Mark Suppelsa's bio on WGN-TV.com Category:Television anchors from Chicago Category:Living people Category:1962 births Category:American television reporters and correspondents Category:People from Milwaukee Category:Marquette University alumni Category:People from Libertyville, Illinois Category:People from Frankfort, Illinois ","title":"Mark Suppelsa"},{"id":"5975673","text":"Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park is a national park in Sumatra, Indonesia. The park located along the Bukit Barisan mountain range, has a total area of 3,568 km2, and spans three provinces: Lampung, Bengkulu, and South Sumatra. Together with Gunung Leuser and Kerinci Seblat national parks it forms a World Heritage Site, Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra. Flora and fauna The national park stretching along the Bukit Barisan mountain range is in average only 45 km wide but 350 km long. The northern part is mountainous with its highest point at Gunung Pulung (1,964 m), while its southern section is a peninsula. It is covered by montane forest, lowland tropical forest, coastal forest and mangrove forest. Plants in the park include Nipa palm, Casuarina equisetifolia, Anisoptera curtisii and Gonystylus bancanus, as well as Sonneratia, Pandanus, Shorea and Dipterocarpus species. Large flowers in the park include the Rafflesia arnoldii, Amorphophallus decus-silvae, Amorphophallus titanum and the world's largest orchid the Grammatophyllum speciosum. The park is home to many endangered and threatened species, including: * Sumatran elephant (about 500 animals, or 25% of the total remaining population of this subspecies live in the park) * Sumatran striped rabbit (most recent records of this poorly known species have been from the park) * Sumatran rhinoceros (an estimated 17-24 Sumatran rhinos live in the park; approximately the same number live in Gunung Leuser National Park, along with approximately 30-35 in Way Kambas National Park, comprising a total population of fewer than 100 animals * Sumatran tiger (approximately 40 adult tigers or 10% of the remaining Sumatran tigers live in the park). Other animals in the park are the Malayan tapir, siamang, Sumatran surili, sun bear and lesser mouse-deer.

Since the 1970s there have been numerous squatters established within the park, and despite forced evictions in the early 1980s, their numbers increased since 1998. In 2006 it was estimated that the squatter encroachment by about 127,000 people covered an area of 55,000 ha. For the period between 1972 and 2006, it is estimated that 63,000 ha of primary forest cover has been lost. This represents 20% of the forests lost to illegal agriculture. The World Wide Fund for Nature found that more than 450 km2 of park land is being used for growing coffee, and the organisation is now working with multinational coffee companies to help them avoid buying illegally grown coffee.

History The municipality of Nes was established on 8 October 1893 when the old municipality of Nes og Hitter√∏ was split into two: Nes and Hitter√∏. At the time of the split, Nes had a population of 1,704. In 1942, a part of Nes with 377 inhabitants was moved to the neighboring town of Flekkefjord.

He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Don Valley from 1959 to 1979.  Career  Kelley was a miners' union secretary in Doncaster for 10 years, where he joined with National Coal Board managers in opposition to miners who wanted to leave work early when their work was complete, fearing that it could lead to miners hurrying their work and ignoring safety precautions. He also served as a councillor on the West Riding of Yorkshire County Council from 1949 to 1959. At the time of his candidacy for Parliament, the NUM's leadership in Yorkshire tried to prevent left-wingers from becoming sponsored miners' MPs and most MPs in NUM-dominated seats were on the right of the Labour Party. Richard Kelley was able to secure election because the collieries in the Don Valley were considerably more militant than in the rest of Yorkshire and built an independent power base around his candidacy. He was elected at the 1959 general election as the MP for Don Valley, and held the seat at five further general elections until he retired from the House of Commons at the 1979 general election. Kelley was sponsored by the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), and was one of the MPs affected by a decision in 1977 of the Yorkshire area of the NUM to seek the retirement at age 65 of all MPs sponsored by mining unions. = In Parliament = In February 1961, the German Democratic Republic's news agency ADN reported that Kelley had been \\"harassed\\", \\"threatened\\" and then arrested by police in West Berlin whilst visiting the city in connection with his attendance at a conference for coexistence and disarmament in Warsaw. The West Berlin authorities dismissed the claims, describing the incident as \\"trivial\\". In June of that year, Kelley's son Jack, then aged 23, was fined ¬£1 for painting the slogan \\"ban the bomb\\" on a bus shelter near Doncaster, but said \\"it has nothing to do with my father\\". Kelley opposed the Vietnam War. In March 1967 he signed an advertisement in The Times calling on the government of the United Kingdom to \\"dissociate itself explicitly from the bombing of North Vietnam\\", and in April that year he was one of 59 Labour MPs to vote against the Labour government in a Commons motion on the war. He rebelled against the incomes policy of Harold Wilson's government, voting against the government in a division on the report stage of the Prices and Incomes Bill in June 1968, and voted against the government again in a further motion on Vietnam in December 1969. In November 1976, Kelley was one of 33 Labour MPs denounced by the Social Democratic Alliance (a pressure group on the right of the Labour Party) for their alleged associations with Communist and Trotskyite organisations. The MPs, who included Tony Benn and future leader Michael Foot, were accused by the SDA of being part of a shift in the party \\"in favour of intolerant Marxist totalitarianism\\".

Prior to the outbreak of World War I he taught at the Stern Conservatory in Berlin, but in 1914 he settled in New York City, where he made his US debut. He is believed to have been the first pianist to play three concertos of Ludwig van Beethoven in a single concert: his performances of Beethoven's third, fourth and fifth with the New York Symphony Orchestra in the Aeolian Hall in 1919.Richard Aldrich. Music: Hutcheson Plays Three Concertos, The New York Times, 12 November 1919. He became a member of the faculty at the Juilliard School, and successively Dean (1926‚Äì1937) and President (1937‚Äì1945) of the school. At Juilliard, he championed the use of radio musical broadcasts in education.The Place of Radio in Musical Education He taught many first-rate students. One of these many students was Mary Ann Craft, who later taught the prodigy Edgar Coleman during his formative years. Two other students who went on to important pianistic careers were the American Abram Chasins, and the Australian Bruce Hungerford. He also taught Muriel Kerr, a winner of the Naumberg Competition who made her Carnegie Hall debut 5 December 1928 in Rachmaninoff's Concerto No. 2 with the Philharmonic SO of New York conducted by Mengelberg. She became Hutcheson's assistant at Juilliard and later toured under Columbia Artists Management, settling finally in Los Angeles where she taught at the University of Southern California. Hutcheson was a member of the Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity.  At Chautauqua  Hutcheson was also associated with the Chautauqua School of Music at the Chautauqua Institution in Western New York State. Hutcheson provided a much needed refuge for George Gershwin at Chautauqua during the stressful period of composing and refining the Piano Concerto in F. Since Gershwin was already very famous as a successful writer of popular works and musical shows, he was constantly besieged by admirers. Further, he had never scored a large symphonic work (the earlier Rhapsody in Blue had been scored for jazz band by Gershwin, but was orchestrated by Ferde Grof√©) and was under great stress from the pressing deadline expectations from Walter Damrosch, conductor of the New York Symphony, who had commissioned the Concerto in F. Thanks to Ernest Hutcheson's kind offer of seclusion for Gershwin at Chautauqua where his quarters were declared off limits to everyone until 4 p.m. daily, Gershwin was able to successfully complete his piano concerto on time.  Works  Ernest Hutcheson wrote concertos for piano; 2 pianos; and violin, and many solo piano works, such as a transcription of Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries. His music has been little heard in concert or on recordings, but his Australian compatriot Ian Munro has recorded some of his piano pieces.

It was located in the present-day Vads√∏ Municipality on the southern half of the Varanger Peninsula, east of the Jakobselva river, along the Varangerfjorden. The administrative centre of the municipality was in the town of Vads√∏. Name The name Nord-Varanger refers to the northern coast of the Varangerfjorden, (Old Norse: Ver(j)angr). The first part is ver meaning \\"fishing village\\" and the last part is angr which means \\"fjord\\". It was first probably used for the narrow fjord on the inside of Angsnes which now is called \\"Meskfjorden\\" and leads into Varangerbotn. History The kj√∏pstad (market town) of Vads√∏ was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). Because of the low population in the rural area around the town, the municipality originally included the rural area around it. That rural area was known as the Vads√∏ landsogn. On 1 January 1894, Vads√∏ landsogn was separated from the town of Vads√∏ and became the new municipality called Nord-Varanger. Nord-Varanger had an initial population of 1,296. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee.

He came to power around the year 245 BC, but after ten years he decided to step down, leading his city to join the Achaean League. As a reward the Achaeans elected him to the post of strategos, that is (commanding general) of the League, for three terms in 234/33, 232/31 and 230/29 BC. In 227 BC he lost the elections against Aratus of Sicyon, but was chosen as hipparch, in this position he fell at the gates of his city during a cavalry charge against the Spartan king Cleomenes III. Probably a son of Eudamus from Caphyae,cf. Syll.3 504 Lydiadas was raised as a citizen of Megalopolis. Almost nothing is known of the steps by which he rose to power, but the sources represent him as a man of an ambitious yet generous character, who was misled by false rhetorical arguments to believe that a monarchical government was the best for his fellow-citizens.Plutarch Aratus 30 ; Pausanias VIII 27,12. His elevation appeared to have taken place about the time that Antigonus Gonatas made himself master of Corinth (244 BC) Droysen, Hellenism, vol. II p. 372. Pausanias mentions him as one of the commanders of the forces of Megalopolis at the battle of Mantineia (c. 249 BC) against the Spartans under Agis Pausanias VIII 10,6 and 10,10. As he was associated on that occasion with another general, Leocydes, it may be inferred that he had not then established himself in absolute power. If he came to power around 245 BC, he had held the position for power about ten years, when the progress of the Achaean League and the fame of its leader Aratus of Sicyon led him to form projects more worthy of his ambition. After the fall of the tyrant Aristippus of Argos, instead of waiting until he was attacked in his turn, Lydiadas determined voluntarily to abdicate as tyrant and permit Megalopolis to join the Achaean League as a free state. This generous resolution was rewarded by the Achaeans by the election of Lydiadas to the prestigious post of strategos or commander- in-chief of the confederacy the following year 233 BC. His desire for fame, and his wish to distinguish the year of his command through some brilliant exploit, led him to plan an expedition against Sparta, which was, however, opposed by Aratus, who is said to have already begun to be jealous of Lydiadas' favour and reputation. Lydiadas, indeed, proved to be a formidable rival; he quickly rose to such esteem in the league as to be deemed second only to Aratus, and notwithstanding the opposition of the latter, was elected strategos a second and third time, holding that important office alternately with Aratus. The most bitter enmity had by this time arisen between the two men. Each strove to undermine the other in the popular estimation. But though Lydiadas was unable to shake Aratus' long-established standing, he maintained his ground, not withstanding the insidious attacks of his rival, and the suspicion that naturally attached to one who had formerly borne the name of tyrant. In 227 BC the conduct of Aratus, in avoiding a battle with Cleomenes III of Sparta at Pallantium, gave Lydiadas fresh cause to renew his attacks, but they were again unsuccessful, and he was unable to prevent the appointment of Aratus for the twelfth time to the office of strategos, in 226 BC. Instead, Lydiadas was elected hipparch and had to serve under the command of his rival. The two armies under Aratus and Cleomenes met a short distance from Megalopolis, and though Aratus would not consent to bring on a general engagement, Lydiadas, with the cavalry under his command, charged the right wing of the enemy and put them to the rout, but being led by his eagerness to pursue them too far, got entangled in some enclosures, where his troops suffered severely, and he himself fell, after a gallant resistance. His body was left on the field, but Cleomenes had the generosity to honour a fallen foe, and sent it back to Megalopolis, adorned with the insignia of royal dignity.Polybius II 44,51 ; Plutarch Aratus 30, 35, 37, Cleomenes 6 ; Pausanias VIII 27,12-15.

Rusk√Ω panslavismus - realita a fikce. Prague: Historick√Ω √∫stav AV ƒåR, 2002. s. 43. (ƒçe≈°tina)≈Å. Puszkariow, Jurij Kri≈ºanicz, Oczierk ≈ºizni i tworcziestwa, Nauka, 1984. His ideal, often misunderstood - even today - was to bring about a union of the churches, which Rome and Constantinople had tried to do without success for centuries. He believed that this might come about through closer relations between Slav Catholicism and the Russian Orthodox Church, and supported the idea that all Slavs had a common language and ethnic origin. However, he was not a pan-Slav if this meant seeking the political unity of all Slav people under Russian leadership.Goldstein, Ivo, Croatia - A History (2011), Hurst&Company;, London, pp 45. He considered that the only possible role for the Tsar to 'correct' or unify the ortography and script used in Slav-language books and awaken Slav consciousness was through works conducive to education and logic. In extremis the South Slavs might join with the Russian tsar as a sovereign of the same language and people if the Catholic rulers supported his leadership in a war against the Ottomans. After lengthy travels and fifteen years of exile in Siberia, Kri≈æaniƒá died, misunderstood and disappointed, in battle during the Ottoman siege of Vienna in 1683. Although he had no direct followers, Kri≈æaniƒá's work influenced many later South Slav thinkers who championed both reliance on Russia and South Slav cultural and political unification. Biography =Early life, education, and early missionary work= Kri≈æaniƒá was born in Obrh, near Ozalj (in present-day Croatia) in 1618, a period of political turmoil and of Turkish invasions into Croatia. He attended a Jesuit grammar school in Ljubljana and a Jesuit gymnasium in Zagreb from 1629 to 1635. His father died when he was 17 years old, at approximately the same time he graduated from the gymnasium. He began attending the University of Bologna in 1638 to study theology and graduated in 1640. Shortly after graduating Kri≈æaniƒá began attending the Greek College of St. Athanasius, a center in Rome for the training of Catholic missionaries who would work with Orthodox Christians, from which he graduated in 1642. By the end of his life he was proficient in ten languages. While Kri≈æaniƒá had a strong desire to travel to Moscow with the ambitious goal of uniting the Roman Catholic and Russian Orthodox churches, he was assigned missionary duties in Zagreb, where he was a teacher at the Zagreb Theological Seminary as well as a priest in several neighboring towns. =Life in Russia= Kri≈æaniƒá managed to secure permission from the papacy for a brief visit to Moscow from 25 October to 19 December 1647. as part of a Polish embassy. However, he was not able to secure permission for a prolonged stay until 1658 (it was retracted shortly after being issued, a fact that Kri≈æaniƒá simply ignored) and he did not arrive in Moscow until 17 September 1659. Another authorMarshall T. Poe,\\"A People Born to Slavery: Russia in Early Modern European Ethnography, 1476-1748\\", 2000 said that he pretended to be an Orthodox Serb. He was assigned the duty of translating Latin and Greek documents and preparing an improved Slavic grammar. However, he was exiled to Siberia on 20 January 1661. The reason for his exile is still unknown. Possible explanations put forward have included the fact that he was a Roman Catholic priest, his criticism of Russian society and of the Greeks, with whom Patriarch Nikon was attempting reconciliation, and other political and social motives. Kri≈æaniƒá postulated that he was exiled because of \\"some foolish thing\\" he had said to someone, and that whatever he had said had been mentioned to the authorities. After his stay of roughly a year and a half in the Russian capital, Kri≈æaniƒá arrived in Tobolsk in Siberia, on 8 March 1661. He lived there for 15 years, surviving on a state stipend and working on the treatises On Divine Providence, On Politics, and On Interpretation of Historic Prognostications amongst others. In these books, written in his self-devised \\"Common Slavonic language\\" (a Pan-Slavonic grammar named Grammatitchno Iskaziniye that incorporated numerous Slavic languages), he set forth a comprehensive program of reforms required for the Russian state, including reforms to administration, Russian serfdom, economic policy, education, grammar, and Russia's primitive agricultural system. Many of the reforms he recommended were in fact carried out by Peter the Great, although there is no concrete evidence of Kri≈æaniƒá's direct influence in his doing so. His Politika, which he wrote from 1663-1666, was published by Peter Bezsonov (Russia in the Seventeenth Century, 1859‚Äì60) and for the first time in English in 1985 and is his most well known and influential work. His appeal to the Czar to head the Slavs in the fight against the Germans shows a remarkable political foresight. Kri≈æaniƒá was freed from exile on 5 March 1676. After that he remained in Moscow until 1678, when he travelled to Vilnius and later to Warsaw. He accompanied a Polish force on its way to liberate besieged Vienna from the Ottomans during the Battle of Vienna, where he died near Vienna while participating in its defence against the Turks in the Ukrainian troops that adjoined the troops of the Polish king Jan Sobiesky in 1683. Ideas and theories Kri≈æaniƒá was one of the earliest proponents of Pan-Slavism. The language he created and used in his writing was called Ruski jezik (\\"Russian language\\"), but in reality it was a mixture of several Slavic languages and was devised to serve as a symbol of and even to promote Slavic unity. He wanted to unite the Slavic nations under the Russian Tsar and unite Catholic and Orthodox against the German Protestants and Turkish Muslims.Poe, page 181-188 A key component of Kri≈æaniƒá's theories concerning necessary reforms for the Russian state were his \\"Five Principles of Power.\\" His five principles were: Full autocracy (essentially absolute monarchy), closed borders, compulsory labor or a ban on idleness, government monopoly of foreign trade, and ideological conformity. Kri≈æaniƒá argued that Russia would be strengthened if immigration were tightly restricted and if native Russians were prohibited from leaving the country without justification. The autocrat should use his power to eliminate bad customs, modernize the country and give the nobles and clergy privileges on the model to the Western St√§ndestaat. His works, which also include writings on music and economics, were re-discovered and printed in the mid-19th century.

He served as the head football coach at Oklahoma City University in 1933 and at Kansas State University from 1935 to 1939, tallying a career college football coach mark of 26‚Äì22‚Äì6. Fry was also the head baseball coach at Kansas State from 1935 to 1938 and at Northwestern University from 1944 to 1946, compiling a career college baseball record of 53‚Äì53‚Äì2. He later served as director of player personnel and then as general manager with the Oakland Raiders of the American Football League (AFL) from 1960 to 1963. Playing career Fry played college football at the University of Iowa under legendary coach Howard Jones, excelling as a fullback. He was named to play in the first East‚ÄìWest Shrine Game following his senior season in 1925. Fry then spent the 1926 and 1927 seasons playing professional football with Red Grange for the New York Yankees of the National Football League (NFL). At the same time, Fry attended law school. Coaching career After earning his law degree, Fry quit playing professional football and sought to practice law in Oklahoma, but he was quickly diverted onto the path of a football coach. He began his career coaching football at Classen High School in Oklahoma City. In his five seasons at Classen, from 1928 to 1932, his football teams compiled a record of 44‚Äì9‚Äì1. At Classen, Fry also coached the track team. In 1933, Fry served at the head football coach at Oklahoma City University, leading his squad to an 8‚Äì1 record. The following year, when future Hall of Fame coach Pappy Waldorf moved north from Oklahoma A&M; to Kansas State University, he hired Fry to be his lone assistant coach. Waldorf left Kansas State after one season, and Fry was hired as the new head coach in 1935. Fry held the head coaching position at Kansas State for five seasons, posting an 18‚Äì21‚Äì6 record. Fry also coached the baseball team at Kansas State during this time. Fry stepped aside following the 1939 season when his own assistant coach began politicking for the job of head football coach, but not before coaching the second-ever televised college football game. For the 1940 season, Fry rejoined Waldorf as an assistant coach at Northwestern University. In 1947, Fry moved with Waldorf to the University of California. Fry remained Waldorf's assistant coach at Cal through the end of Waldorf's term, in 1956, despite receiving offers of head coaching positions from Oregon State University and Arizona State University. Administrative career and later life In 1960, Fry joined the Oakland Raiders organization, which was commencing operations as a member of the American Football League. He first served as director of player personnel, then as general manager of the franchise until 1963, when Al Davis was hired as general manager and head coach.

Organised in French Algeria by retired French Army generals Maurice Challe (former commander-in-chief in French Algeria), Edmond Jouhaud (former Inspector General of the French Air Force), Andr√© Zeller (former Chief of staff of the French Army) and Raoul Salan (former commander-in-chief in French Algeria), it took place from the afternoon of 21 April to 26 April 1961 in the midst of the Algerian War (1954‚Äì62).French National Audiovisual Institute INA, Les Actualit√©s Fran√ßaises - 03/05/1961 The organisers of the putsch were opposed to the secret negotiations that French Prime Minister Michel Debr√©'s government had started with the anti-colonialist National Liberation Front (FLN). Gen. Raoul Salan stated that he joined the coup without concerning himself with its technical planning; however, it has always been considered a four-man coup d'√©tat, or as de Gaulle famously put it, \\"un quarteron de g√©n√©raux en retraite\\" (\\"a quartet of generals in retirement\\"). The coup was to come in two phases: an assertion of control in French Algeria's major cities Algiers, Oran and Constantine. The metropolitan operation would be led by Col. Antoine Argoud, with French paratroopers descending on strategic airfields. The commanders in Oran and Constantine, however, refused to follow Challe's demand that they join the coup. At the same time information about the metropolitan phase came to Prime Minister Debr√©'s attention through the intelligence service. On 22 April all flights and landings were forbidden in Parisian airfields, and an order was given to the Army to resist the coup \\"by all means\\".Debr√©'s official speech in the 20h news report, ORTF public television channel, 22 April 1961 The following day, President Charles de Gaulle made a famous speech on television, dressed in his World War II uniform (he was seventy years old and long since a civilian head of state) ordering the French people and military to help him.French National Audiovisual Institute INA, JT 20H - 23/04/1961  Context  The majority of the French people had voted in favor of Algerian self- determination during the disputed referendum of 8 January 1961 organised in metropolitan France.Nohlen, D & St√∂ver, P (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p674 The wording of the referendum was \\"Do you approve the Bill submitted to the French people by the President of the Republic concerning the self-determination of the Algerian population and the organisation of the public power in Algeria prior to self-determination\\". French citizens living abroad or serving abroad in the military were allowed to vote, as were all adult Algerians, regardless of ancestry, in a single electoral college. Speaking for the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic (the political arm of the FLN), Ferhat Abbas called for a boycott of the referendum, as did 16 retired French generals and factions among the pied noir (French settler) community opposed to independence. Self-determination was approved by 75% of voters overall and 69.5% in Algeria. The government reported voter turnout of 92.2%.Nohlen & St√∂ver, p685 Other sources claim that four out of ten of the individuals in France and Algeria entitled to vote abstained. Following the outcome of the referendum, Michel Debr√©'s government started secret negotiations with the GPRA. On 25 January 1961 Col. Antoine Argoud visited with Premier Debr√© and threatened him with a coup directed by a \\"colonels' junta\\"; the French Army was in no way disposed to let the French Algerian d√©partements created in 1848 after the 1830 conquest become independent.  Chronology  On 22 April 1961 retired generals Maurice Challe, Andr√© Zeller and Raoul Salan, helped by colonels Antoine Argoud, Jean Gardes and civilians Joseph Ortiz and Jean-Jacques Susini (who would form the OAS terrorist group), took control of Algiers. Gen. Challe criticised what he saw as the government's treason and lies toward French Algerian colonists and loyalist Muslims who trusted it, and stated that During the night the 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment (1e REP), composed of 1,000 men and headed by H√©lie de Saint Marc, took control of all of Algiers' strategic points in three hours. The units directly involved in the putsch were the 1st and 2nd REP, the 1er REC and the 14th and 18th Regiments of Chasseurs Parachutistes. Together they comprised the elite units of the airborne divisions of the French Army. Initially, there were pledges of support from other regiments (the 27th Dragoons, the 94th Infantry, the 7th Algerian Tirailleurs and several Marine infantry units), but these seem to have reflected the views of senior officers only and there was no active participation. The head of the Parisian police, Maurice Papon, and the director of the S√ªret√© nationale, formed a crisis cell in a room of the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise, where Charles de Gaulle was attending a presentation of Racine's Britannicus. The president was informed during the entracte of the coup by Jacques Foccart, his general secretary of African and Malagasy Affairs and closest collaborator, in charge of covert operations. Algiers' population was awakened on 22 April at 7:00 am to a message read on the radio: \\"The army has seized control of Algeria and of the Sahara\\". The three rebel generals‚ÄîChalle, Jouhaud, and Zeller‚Äîhad the government's general delegate, Jean Morin, arrested as well as the National Minister of Public Transport, Robert Buron, who was visiting, and several civil and military authorities. Several regiments put themselves under the command of the insurrectionary generals. Gen. Jacques Faure, six other officers and several civilians were simultaneously arrested in Paris. At 5:00 pm, during the ministers' council, Charles de Gaulle declared: \\"Gentlemen, what is serious about this affair is that it isn't serious\\".De Gaulle: Ce qui est grave dans cette affaire, messieurs, c‚Äôest qu‚Äôelle n‚Äôest pas s√©rieuse. He then proclaimed a state of emergency in Algeria, while left-wing parties, the trade union CGT and the NGO Ligue des droits de l'homme (LDH, Human Rights League) called to demonstrate against the military's coup d'√©tat. The following day, on Sunday 23 April, Gen. Salan arrived in Algeria from Spain and refused to arm civilian activists. At 8:00 pm President de Gaulle appeared in his 1940s vintage military uniform on television, calling on French military personnel and civilians, in metropolitan France or in Algeria, to oppose the putsch: Due to the popularity of a recent invention, transistor radio, de Gaulle's call was heard by the conscript soldiers, who refused en masse to follow the professional soldiers' call for insurgency and in some cases jailed their officers. The putsch met with widespread opposition, largely in the form of civil resistance,Adam Roberts, ‚ÄòCivil Resistance to Military Coups‚Äô, Journal of Peace Research, Oslo, vol. 12, no. 1, 1975, pp. 19-36. including a one-hour general strike called by the trade unions the day after de Gaulle's broadcast. Within the army itself much depended on the position taken by individual senior officers. The 13th Light Division of Infantry, responsible for the strategic Zone Sud Oranais and including Foreign Legion units, followed the lead of its commander, Gen. Philippe Ginestet, in remaining loyal to the government in Paris. Ginestet was subsequently assassinated by the OAS in retaliation.pages 46-47 Militaria Magazine 360 July 2015 On Tuesday 25 April government authorities in Paris ordered the explosion of the atomic bomb Gerboise Verte (lit. \\"green jerboa\\") in the Sahara as part of a scheduled testing program. Gerboise Verte exploded at 6:05 am.Les Premiers Essais Francais au Sahara :1960-1966 While the test and test site were already prepped as part of the French national nuclear program, the test timeline appears to have been accelerated to ensure that the security of the device was not compromised. The few military units which had followed the generals progressively surrendered. Gen. Challe gave himself up to the authorities on 26 April, and was immediately transferred to metropolitan France. The putsch had been successfully quashed, but Article 16 granting full and extraordinary powers to de Gaulle was maintained for five months. \\"The Battle of the Transistors\\"‚Äîas it was called by the press‚Äîwas quickly and definitively won by de Gaulle.Alistair Horne, The French Army and Politics, 1984, p. 82, , . Casualties The only known fatality was French Army Sgt. Pierre Brillant, who was killed by the putschists while defending the radio transmitter at Ouled Fayet, Algiers. Brillant was aiming at 1st REP 3rd Company Capt. Estoup when he was shot by a legionnaire.Dubois, Ghislain (1995). Argoud, de Gaulle: le duel. √âd. Dricot, p.107  Trials and amnesty  A military court condemned Challe and Andr√© Zeller to 15 years in prison. However, they were granted an amnesty and had their military positions restored five years later. Raoul Salan and Jouhaud escaped. Salan was condemned in absentia to death (later commuted to life sentence), as was Jouhaud. Salan and others later founded the OAS, a terrorist paramilitary organization that attempted to stop the ongoing process of the April 1962 Independence Evian Agreements for the Algerian territories of France. A July 1968 act granted amnesty;Loi n¬∞ 68-697 du 31 juillet 1968 the November 24, 1982, law reintegrated the surviving generals into the army. Raoul Salan, Edmond Jouhaud and six other generals benefitted from this law. Theories involving CIA and BND involvement There had been publications in Italy, first in Il Paese and then the next day in Russia by Pravda, in which it said that the mutiny was encouraged by NATO, the Pentagon and the CIA. The rumor allegedly spread by word of mouth by minor officials in the Elys√©e Palace itself. The French officials apparently told reporters of the unfounded rumors that charged, \\"the general's plot was backed by strongly anti-communist elements in the United States Government and military services.\\" Despite no evidence, the French seemed to want to believe the gossip to explain why respected officers like Challe had led the putsch. On behalf of President John F. Kennedy, White House Press Secretary Pierre Salinger met with French Foreign Minister Maurice Couve de Murville to assure him the CIA had no part in the plot. The next day M. de Murville appeared before the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies to testify that there was no evidence of U.S. complicity. Il Paese Sera was financed directly by the Communist Party of Italy who had unofficial editorial control. Its editor, Mario Malloni, was a member of the Soviet-backed World Peace Council. IPS, it has been said, \\"consistently released and reported anti- American and pro-Soviet bloc stories which are either distorted or entirely false.\\" U.S. President John F. Kennedy contacted de Gaulle to pledge his support, including military assistance, if needed.Rendez-vous with X: Algiers Putsch & the CIA, Patrick Pesnot, Radio show, broadcast on French public radio France Inter, April 14, 2001 President de Gaulle declined Kennedy's offer, fearing any controversy if American troops shot any French counterparts. During a June 1961 hearing before a subcommittee of the Committee on the Judiciary in the United States Senate, Richard Helms testified that the article published by il Paese was likely part of a Soviet propaganda campaign designed to divide the U.S. and French governments. There were other claims of foreign support: French journalist Patrick Pesnot contended that the French generals also had the support of the Bundesnachrichtendienst (West German Federal Intelligence Service) leader Reinhard Gehlen. However, Gen. Challe himself always contended that he had never been in contact with any foreign countries in this affair.

The band began with Paul Lagos on drums, Larry Taylor on bass and Randy Resnick on guitar. Resnick was at that time experimenting with a one and two handed tapping technique which later became a standard guitarist's tool. The group played small rooms in the Los Angeles area, such as the Troubadour and the Ash Grove, for several months. While the band was searching for a record deal, Larry Taylor allegedly began to tire of Don's constant lateness and irresponsibility and decided to continue his career with John Mayall. At the same time, Harvey Mandel, a Charlie Musselwhite, Canned Heat and Mayall alumnus, was brought in to beef up the accompaniment and to stimulate record label interest, as he already had a following from his Chicago blues days. To replace Taylor on bass, a relative newcomer, Victor Conte, was recruited from Common Ground, a funk band in Fresno that Resnick had played in. Conte went on to play in Tower of Power and with Herbie Hancock in his Monster Band. Choice Cuts was the band's only album, recorded live in Seattle in 1972, but it was mostly unsuccessful. Allegedly because of Don's unreliable nature, the band rarely rehearsed. Live performances included extended solos and improvised ensemble sections, and one song would often last 20 minutes or more. Various line-up changes took place until the band broke up a few years after releasing its first album.

History Showing influences from Postcard Records bands such as Orange Juice, they came to prominence when featured on the NME's C86 compilation, at around the same time that they released their debut single \\"Everybody Knows the Monkey\\". This was soon followed by a 12\\" single, \\"Is There Anyone Out There?\\", before the band signed to Chapter 22 Records, releasing a string of well-received singles and the album Sharks in 1988. With their brand of indie pop giving way to American influenced rock and shoegazing, they split in 1988. Continuing interest in the band saw the reissue of Sharks in 2000, the release of a compilation album of BBC session tracks in 2001, and two compilations of singles and unreleased tracks in 2000 and 2001. They reformed for the Indietracks music festival in 2009. They played Popfest Berlin in 2010, followed by Firestation Records of Berlin issuing their 'lost second album', The Betamax Tapes, on vinyl and CD, 25 years after it was recorded, in 2012. In 2013, Cherry Red Records released a major double CD compilation entitled Pop Can - the Definitive Collection 1986-88 which collects most of the band's released material, namely all their singles, B-sides and EP tracks, alongside several tracks from their only album released during their career, Sharks, and tracks from The Betamax Tapes. During 1986-87, they recorded three sessions for John Peel and one for Janice Long, all broadcast on BBC Radio One - these are collected on the Vinyl Japan compilation Mighty Mighty... At the BBC and continue to be broadcast by BBC Radio 6 Music. In July 2019, Mighty Mighty released their third album Misheard Love Songs recorded at Muthers in Digbeth, Birmingham.

That same year, he took an extended vacation, continuing to draw his cartoons while driving around Europe. Guindon began his self-titled cartoon series for the Minneapolis Tribune in 1974. At first it appeared three to four times per week, then became a daily in 1978 when it was picked up by the Los Angeles Times Syndicate. In 1981, the syndication was moved to Field Newspaper Syndicate, and then in 1984 to News America Syndicate.

He was one of the first Americans to live in Japan and helped to form the standards by which Japanese art and culture were appreciated in the West. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1911. Early career Bigelow was the son of Henry Jacob Bigelow, a prominent Boston surgeon. Bigelow received his degree in medicine from Harvard University in 1874 and continued his medical studies in Europe for five years under Louis Pasteur. His primary interest was bacteriology, but when his father pressured him to follow him into surgery, Bigelow abandoned a medical career altogether. Travels in Japan (1882‚Äì89) Bigelow began collecting Japanese art as a student in Paris. In 1882, inspired by lectures on Japan delivered by Edward Sylvester Morse, Bigelow traveled to Japan. Once there, he funded Morse's work and that of Ernest Fenollosa, another young Harvard graduate teaching in Boston. Bigelow remained in Japan for seven years. With authorization from the Japanese government, Bigelow, Morse, and Fenollosa, were able to explore parts of Japan closed to outside viewers for centuries. The group visited the Treasure House of T≈çdai-ji, viewing hidden treasures of Emperor Sh≈çmu, and were granted a few shards of pottery, the only items belonging to the Sh≈çs≈ç-in known to currently reside outside of it. Among the many items he obtained during his time in Japan were a set of gilt bronze statues of the historical Buddha from H≈çry≈´-ji, known as the Shaka Trinity statues, and a mandala from the Hokke-do of T≈çdai-ji, one of the oldest Japanese paintings to ever leave Japan. Morse collected ancient ceramics, Bigelow collected armor, and Fenollosa collected paintings.Christopher Reed. (2017). Bachelor Japanists, Japanese Aesthetics and Western Masculinities. New York Columbia University Press pp. 142 Returning to the United States, Bigelow donated approximately 75,000 objects of Japanese art to Boston's Museum of Fine Arts. The donations gave the Museum of Fine Arts the largest collection of Japanese art anywhere outside Japan, a distinction it still holds today. = Okakura Kakuz≈ç = In traveling through Japan and forming their collections, Bigelow and his Boston colleagues were helped by one of Fenollosa's students, Okakura Kakuz≈ç. Inspired by the Westerners' admiration for Japanese aristocratic tradition and with funding from Bigelow, Okakura founded the Nihon Bijutsuin, a fine arts academy, to preserve and promote traditional forms of Japanese art. In 1898, Okakura was ousted by faculty and students at the school who objected to his rigid focus on traditional art. After his dismissal, Bigelow hired Okakura to oversee the Japanese art collections at the Museum of Fine Arts.Christopher Reed. (2017). Bachelor Japanists, Japanese Aesthetics and Western Masculinities. New York Columbia University Press pp. 166 Okakura emphasized transforming the Western image of a tea house filled with women and domestic utensils to that of a temple filled with religious scroll paintings and sculptures. When the museum moved to a new building in 1909, a gallery and courtyard garden designed to mimic a temple and its forecourt was built to display Japanese sculpture. This popular space became a model for other American museums displaying East Asian art.Christopher Reed. (2017). Bachelor Japanists, Japanese Aesthetics and Western Masculinities. New York Columbia University Press pp. 171-178  Buddhism  With Fenollosa, Bigelow converted to Tendai Buddhism and taught and lectured on the subject back in Boston. He framed Buddhism in Episcopalian terms (such as \\"bishop\\" to describe senior monksChristopher Reed. (2017). Bachelor Japanists, Japanese Aesthetics and Western Masculinities. New York Columbia University Press pp. 152) and dismissed Zen and Shin Buddhism, referring to the latter as a \\"very big and popular and easy-going sect... the Salvation Army of Buddhism.\\"Christopher Reed. (2017). Bachelor Japanists, Japanese Aesthetics and Western Masculinities. New York Columbia University Press pp. 151 Bigelow's publicity for his vision of Japan extended to his teachings on Buddhism. He delivered the annual Ingersoll Lecture on the Immortality of Man at Harvard in 1908, which was published as a book in Buddhism and Immortality. Bigelow used the scientific language of natural selection to explain spiritual evolution, as when an individual emerges from \\"unconditioned consciousness\\" and \\"moves up the scale of evolution guided by natural selection.\\" Next, the individual moves to a level of celestial experience and finally is able to \\"return to the unconditioned consciousness from which all things emerge. In his view, familial ties were created by reincarnaton and what he called \\"thought transference.\\"Brooks, Van Wyck (1962), Fenollosa and His Circle, with Other Essays in Biography. New York: Dutton Bigelow's contemporaries compared his relationship to the Japanese monk who instructed him in Buddhism as that of \\"a filial child\\" to a \\"benevolent father.\\" Murakata, Akiko (1971). Selected Letters of Dr. William Sturgis Bigelow, Ph.D. Dissertation, George Washington University Historian T.J.

No Place of Grace: Antimodernism and the Transformation of American Culture, 1880-1920, p. 229 Bigelow accepted both material and spiritual evolution and believed Buddhism and science were compatible.American encounter with Buddhism, 1844‚Äì1912: Victorian culture & the limits of dissent, Thomas A. Tweed, 2000, pp. 107‚Äì108  Personal life  Bigelow has been described as \\"at once an epicure and a mystic, who professed an ascetic religion and wore beautiful Charvet haberdashery.\\" Bigelow's enthusiasm for the elite male camaraderie he enjoyed in Japan is reflected in the nature of his collections. Whereas Parisian collections emphasized Japanese domestic objects or dress more associated with femininity, the Boston collectors focused on the elite all- male aspects of Japanese society: the tea ceremony, the samurai, and elite communities of Buddhist monks. Bigelow's preference for the company of men was manifest nowhere more clearly than on his island retreat of Tuckernuck, off Nantucket. He invited other men there to enjoy the pleasures of dining and swimming in a world without women. = George Cabot Lodge = Bigelow was heartbroken when George Cabot Lodge, the young poet he had chosen as his spiritual son to inherit his island estate, died there at the age of thirty- five.

He gave her a 38-carat diamond named ‚ÄúCleveland‚Äù and presented her a letter with his marriage proposal. She rejected the proposal, but from then on their relationship became more intimate. During their relationship, he gifted her a number of Japanese objects, which she donated in 1930 to the Etnografski Muzej in Zagreb.Renata Santo, \\"Legacy of Milka Trnina in the Collection of Non-European Cultures of the Ethnographic Museum\\", Etnolo≈°ka istra≈æivanja 17-18 (2014), 245-262. http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/197070  Death  Bigelow's grave at HomyoinBigelow died in 1926.

The performing arts, which include, but are not limited to dance, music and theatre, are key elements of culture and engage participants at a number of levels. The end point for performing arts education varies: some educators integrate arts into school classrooms to support other curricula while simultaneously building students' art skills, and some focus on performing arts as an academic discipline in itself. Performing arts integration Performing arts integration in schools Integrating performing arts into educational experiences can help students learn other subjects, such as science, as well as help them develop various non-arts-based skills. As children grow, engaging them in performance arts can help them meet developmental milestones, including those for motor skills and psychosocial skills. For example, teachers can integrate performing arts and the discussion thereof into their classrooms to honor student self-expression. Bilingual youth can benefit from this type of arts integration because it offers them modes of communication that can respond more easily to their culture and language than text-based or test-based learning. Regardless of the language used, teachers have found that using performing arts in the classroom, such as improvisational drama, can help students process and prepare for non-arts- based life situations, including bullying. Performing arts integration out of schools Performing arts integration that empowers students in these ways doesn't only happen in schools; community organizations, such as the Beat Nation Collective in Canada, use hip hop performance to help students deepen their understanding of and broaden their experience with indigenous identity and language. Issues of access and equity Despite the benefits of engaging students in performing arts, many students, particularly minority students such as African American and Latino students, do not have equitable access to performing arts in their school classrooms. Discipline-based performing arts The performing arts differ from the plastic arts insofar as the former uses the artist's own body, face and/or presence as a medium Performers often adapt their appearance by special clothing, stage makeup, etc. For students pursuing elite professional careers in performing arts like classical ballet and circus arts, the physical demands are such that early entry into training can be essential.

Biography Born in Chiyoda, Tokyo into a kuge family of court nobility related to the Fujiwara aristocracy, Daigo was a graduate of the Gakushuin Peers' school. He went on to graduate from the 40th class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in 1912. His rank on entering was only 126th out of 150 cadets, but he improved his scores, so that he graduated at 17th out of 144.Nishida, Imperial Japanese Navy. Daigo served as a midshipman on the cruiser and battleship . As an ensign, he was assigned to the cruiser . After his promotion to sub-lieutenant in 1913, he took time out to attend a session of the House of Peers as was obligatory for members of his social class. He then returned to active service on the battleship and destroyer . Daigo was promoted to lieutenant in 1918, and after taking courses in torpedo warfare, was assigned to submarines, serving on , and then becoming captain of , followed by . He also served on the cruiser in 1924. After promotion to lieutenant commander in 1924, he was captain of in 1926, and chief torpedo officer on the battleship later the same year. In the 1930s, Daigo was captain of a large number of cruisers in rapid succession: , , , , , and . He was promoted to rear admiral on 15 November 1940. Daigo commanded Submarine Squadron 5 (Subron 5), with his flag on the light cruiser at the start of the Pacific War. At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Subron 5 was covering the first wave of the Malaya Invasion Force south of the Cape of Camau, French Indochina. On 9 December 1941, Subron 5 was ordered to pursue and sink the Royal Navy Force Z (battleship , battlecruiser and supporting destroyers). Although Yura received word from that the British ships were spotted, due to poor wireless reception, the signal was unclear and the British vessels were overwhelmed by torpedo bombers of the 22nd Air Flotilla from bases in Indochina before Yura and her submarines could take action. Subron 5 was then assigned to the invasion of Sarawak from 13‚Äì26 December, covering landings in Brunei, Miri, Seria, and Kuching. The 2,500 men of the \\"Kawaguchi Detachment\\" and the No. 2 Yokosuka Special Naval Landing Force (SNLF) quickly captured Miri's airfield and oil fields. The operation was completed, and Yura returned to its base at Camranh Bay, Indochina by the end of the year. Subron 5 was also part of the advance screening force for the Battle of Midway. Daigo became vice admiral on 1 November 1943. He was assigned command of the Eastern Attack Group which carried out midget submarine and merchant shipping attacks on the east coast of Australia.Padfield, War Beneath the Sea: Submarine Conflict During World War II Vice Admiral Tadashige Daigo, seated in uniform, with members of his staff and kaiten pilots (with hachimakis of I-36 Daigo was Commandant of the Naval Submarine School from 23 August 1944 and final Commander in Chief of the IJN 6th Fleet from 1 May 1945. During these assignments, he was involved in the kaiten human-torpedo program. After the end of the war, Daigo was arrested by SCAP authorities at the request of the Netherlands government, and was extradited to Batavia in the Dutch East Indies, where he was charged with war crimes in connection with the kidnapping, torture and massacre of 21,000 people (including women and children) by Japanese troops in Pontianak during the Pontianak incidents. After being held for several months under severe conditions, he was found guilty in a closed military tribunal at Pontianak after only three hours of testimony, during which time he was not allowed to speak in his own defense, and was executed with a rifle shot to the stomach on 6 December 1947. As Daigo was commander of submarine forces, (although from 8 November 1943 the 22nd Special Guard Division based at Balikpapan, Borneo fell nominally under his command), his connection (if any) with the events in Pontianak from 23 April 1943 ‚Äì 28 June 1944 remain very unclear. Whereas other \\"Class B\\" war criminals found guilty of professional negligence for atrocities committed by junior staff under their nominal command were sentenced to several years in prison,Minear, Victor's Justice the speed and secrecy surrounding his trial, and the severity and brutality of his punishment, have created questions which remain unanswered.

The natural alternate splicing of four fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) genes results in the production of over 48 different isoforms of FGFR. These isoforms vary in their ligand-binding properties and kinase domains, however all share the common extracellular region composed of three immunoglobulin(Ig)-like domains (D1-D3), and thus belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily. The three immunoglobin(Ig)-like domains‚ÄîD1, D2, and D3‚Äîpresent a stretch of acidic amino acids (\\"the acid box\\") between D1 and D2. This \\"acid box\\" can participate in the regulation of FGF binding to the FGFR. Immunoglobulin-like domains D2 and D3 are sufficient for FGF binding. Each receptor can be activated by several FGFs. In many cases, the FGFs themselves can also activate more than one receptor (i.e., FGF1, which binds all seven principal FGFRs). FGF7, however, can only activate FGFR2b, and FGF18 was recently shown to activate FGFR3. A gene for a fifth FGFR protein, FGFR5, has also been identified. In contrast to FGFRs 1-4, it lacks a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain and one isoform, FGFR5Œ≥, and only contains the extracellular domains D1 and D2. The FGFRs are known to dimerize as heterodimers and homodimers. Genes So far, five distinct membrane FGFR have been identified in vertebrates and all of them belong to the tyrosine kinase superfamily (FGFR1 to FGFR4). * (see also Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1) (= CD331) * (see also Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2) (= CD332) * (see also Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3) (= CD333) * (see also Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4) (= CD334) * (see also Fibroblast growth factor receptor-like 1) * As a drug target The FGF/FGFR signalling pathway is involved in a variety of cancers. There are non-selective FGFR inhibitors that act on all of FGFR1-4 and other proteins, and some selective FGFR inhibitors for some/all of FGFR1-4. Selective FGFR inhibitors include AZD4547, BGJ398, JNJ42756493, and PD173074. Many FGFR inhibitors are in early clinical trials as a cancer treatment.

He has devoted his life to removing landmines in Cambodia and to caring for young landmine victims. Aki Ra states that since 1992 he has personally removed and destroyed as many as 50,000 landmines, and is the founder of the Cambodian Landmine Museum.Life of the Land, Time Magazine, 31.

His parents were killed by the Khmer Rouge. Orphaned in a Khmer Rouge camp, he was taken in by a woman named Yourn who raised him and several other orphaned children. Like many others, he soon became a child soldier once his strength became sufficient to make him useful to local Khmer Rouge military commanders.Ebonne Ruffins, \\"Cambodian man clears land mines he set decades ago,\\" CNN July 30, 2010.

Later he enlisted with the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Armed Forces formed by the new government, the People's Republic of Kampuchea. His duties included placing landmines along the mined area on Cambodia's border with Thailand. The name \\"Aki Ra\\" was given to him by a Japanese acquaintance and is not his birth name. He was born Eoun Yeak, but one of his supervisors once compared his efficiency to AKIRA, a heavy-duty appliance company in Japan.Kyle Ellison, \\"A step inside the Cambodian Landmine Museum,\\" Dec 23rd 2011. Landmine clearing Having laid thousands of landmines as a soldier, Aki Ra found employment as a deminer with the UN in 1991.

He conducted informal mine risk education groups to teach people about the dangers of unexploded ordnance and landmines. Adopted children While working in these villages he found many injured and abandoned children. He brought them home to live with him and his wife Hourt. Some of the children who moved to their home were also street kids from Siem Reap and Phnom Penh. Eventually he brought home over two dozen boys and girls.Antonio Graceffo, \\"Aki Ra and Landmine Museum,\\" Mekong.net, 22 May 2008. In early 2009, a boy came to live with Aki Ra and Hourt who had lost an arm and most of a hand to a cluster munition. He was working with his uncle in a field near Battambang, west of Siem Reap when he found an explosive probably left over from the Cambodian Civil War. Aki Ra found him in the hospital and told his family about the Museum. He now lives there and attends school. Today, 29 children live at the Cambodia Landmine Museum Relief Center. In the past they were mainly landmine victims, but now they also include children born without limbs, polio victims, and some with HIV; some are orphans and some have parents who cannot afford to raise them.William Morse, \\"Cambodia Landmine Museum.\\" Funds from the museum are entirely dedicated to the support of these children to feed them, clothe them, and send them to school.

CSHD‚Äôs charter is to clear small villages, areas considered \\"low priority\\" for other international demining organizations, who are busy in \\"high priority\\" areas. In its first year of activity CSHD cleared 163,000 square meters of land and put over 2,400 people back on land that had been too dangerous to farm or live on. CSHD did this for an average cost of USD$4,314 per month.CSHD Facebook Page CSHD is funded primarily by its American and Australian partners, the Landmine Relief Fund and the Vietnam Veterans Mine Clearing Team ‚Äì Cambodia. In 2009 the United States Department of State, Office of Weapons Removal and Abatement granted the Landmine Relief Fund US$100,000 to help CSHD in their work to clear ERW (Explosive remnants of war) in \\"low priority villages\\" in Cambodia. Ongoing funding is uncertain as CSHD must compete with larger demining NGOs such as Mines Advisory Group and Halo Trust.

Personal life The documentary film A Perfect Soldier implies that Aki Ra has suffered psychological problems, including depression, mood swings, nightmares and anxiety, as a result of his traumatic experiences as a soldier. Several sources state that Aki Ra has had health problems due to his chronic, repeated exposure to explosive chemicals such as TNT and RDX. In 2018 Aki Ra was arrested for keeping defused, inert munitions on display at the Cambodian Landmine Museum. He was accused of lacking permits to display the munitions. The orphanage run by the museum was closed and the children taken into custody of the state. In September 2018 he was granted bail and is disputing the charges.

G. Wells about an August 1895 cycling holiday, somewhat in the style of Three Men in a Boat. In 1922 it was adapted into a silent film The Wheels of Chance directed by Harold M. Shaw. Plot introduction The Wheels of Chance was written at the height of the cycling craze (1890‚Äì1905), when practical, comfortable bicycles first became widely and cheaply available and before the rise of the automobile (see History of the bicycle). The advent of the bicycle stirred sudden and profound changes in the social life of England. Even the working class could travel substantial distances, quickly and cheaply, and the very idea of travelling for pleasure became a possibility for thousands of people for the first time. This new freedom affected many. It began to weaken the rigid English class structure and it gave an especially powerful boost to the existing movement toward female emancipation. Wells explored these social changes in his story. Plot The hero of The Wheels of Chance, Mr. Hoopdriver, is a frustrated \\"draper's assistant\\"H. G. Wells, The Wheels of Chance, Ch. i‚Äìiii & xxxv. in Putney, a badly paid, grinding position (and one which Wells briefly held); and yet he owns a bicycle and is setting out on a bicycling tour of \\"the Southern Coast\\" on his annual ten days' holiday. Hoopdriver survives his frustration by escaping in his imagination into a world of fantasy. He is not a skilled rider of his forty-three-pound bicycle, and his awkwardness reflects both Wells's own uncertainties in negotiating the English class system and his critical view of that society. Nonetheless, Hoopdriver is treated sympathetically: \\"But if you see how a mere counter-jumper, a cad on castors, and a fool to boot, may come to feel the little insufficiencies of life, and if he has to any extent won your sympathies, my end is attained.\\"H. G. Wells, The Wheels of Chance, Ch. xli. Hoopdriver's summer adventure begins lyrically: > Only those who toil six long days out of the seven, and all the year round, > save for one brief glorious fortnight or ten days in the summer time, know > the exquisite sensations of the First Holiday Morning. All the dreary, > uninteresting routine drops from you suddenly, your chains fall about your > feet. . . . There were thrushes in the Richmond Road, and a lark on Putney > Heath. The freshness of dew was in the air; dew or the relics of an > overnight shower glittered on the leaves and grass. . . . He wheeled his > machine up Putney Hill, and his heart sang within him.H. G. Wells, The > Wheels of Chance, Ch. iv. Hoopdriver encounters a pretty young woman cycling alone and wearing rationals (bloomers). He dares not speak to the Young Lady in Grey, as he calls her, but their paths keep crossing. She is ultimately revealed to be Jessie Milton, a girl of seventeen who has run away from her stepmother in Surbiton, risking \\"ruin\\" at the hands of the bounder Bechamel, an unscrupulous older man who has promised to help the naive Jessie to establish herself an independent life but who is really intent on seducing her. Ironically, her flight has in part been inspired by liberal ideals of unconventionality that have been hypocritically promoted by her stepmother's popular novels. Hoopdriver half-inadvertently rescues her from Bechamel's clutches, and the two proceed to cycle across the south of England. Ashamed of his true circumstances, Hoopdriver spins droll tales of South African origins and the comforts of wealth until shame induces him to confess his true circumstances. But he also displays genuine courage, rebuking insolent travellers who insult Jessie's honour. Hoopdriver's encounter inspires in him a desire to better himself, as well as impossibly romantic feelings toward Jessie. At last a party consisting of her stepmother, some of her stepmother's admirers, and her former schoolteacher catches up with them. Jessie returns home and Hoopdriver returns to the Drapery Emporium of Messrs. Antrobus & Co., but Jessie has promised to \\"send him some books\\" and has held out the vague prospect that \\"in six years' time\\" things may be different.H. G. Wells, The Wheels of Chance, Ch. xl. Jessie's bookish and romantic education has kept her ignorant of the realities of life, and her ignorance contributes to the comedy of Hoopdriver's half-clever, half- ridiculous improvised stories of life in Africa. Jessie has her own aspirations: \\"She was going to Live her Own Life, with emphasis.\\"H. G. Wells, The Wheels of Chance, Ch. xxxiii. Wells's intention in The Wheels of Chance might be taken to be satirical, were his protagonists' circumstances not so closely related to his own history and that of his second wife, Catherine Robbins. Setting Wells used real places in plotting the novel, and the entire route can be followed on a map. Among the sites described in the novel are Ripley, Cobham, Guildford, Haslemere, Godalming, Milford, Midhurst, Chichester, Bognor (where, at the Vicuna Hotel, Hoopdriver comes to Jessie's rescue), Chichester Harbour, Havant, Botley, the hamlet of Wallenstock (where Hoopdriver defends Jessie's honour), Blandford (where Hoopdriver confesses his true identity to Jessie), Ringwood, Stoney Cross, and the Rufus Stone (where Hoopdriver says good-bye to Jessie). Publication The novel was paired with The Time Machine and included in the Everyman's Library (no. 915) in 1935. The text of Wheels of Chance is available at several sites on the internet.

It is also introduced in China and Nepal. It grows at moderately high altitudes of .Cupressus cashmeriana. The Gymnosperm Database. Description Cupressus cashmeriana is a medium-sized to large tree growing tall, rarely much more, with a trunk up to diameter. The foliage grows in strongly pendulous sprays of blue-green, very slender, flattened shoots. The leaves are scale-like, 1‚Äì2 mm long, up to 5 mm long on strong lead shoots; young trees up to about 5 years old have juvenile foliage with soft needle-like leaves 3‚Äì8 mm long. The seed cones are ovoid, 10‚Äì21 mm long and 10‚Äì19 mm broad, with 8‚Äì12 scales, dark green, maturing dark brown about 24 months after pollination. The cones open at maturity to shed the seed. The pollen cones are 3‚Äì5 mm long, and release pollen in early spring. A tree of tall has recently been reported,Farjon, A. (2005). Monograph of Cupressaceae and Sciadopitys. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. but the measurements await verification. Conservation The natural populations of this species are fragmented. There are few occurrences and they contain few large individuals. Cypress wood is in demand locally. Cultivation Cupressus cashmeriana is widely grown horticulturally as an ornamental tree, both within its native region and internationally in temperate climates. It is planted in private gardens and public parks, although generally regarded as sensitive to drought and wind. Many of the plants available outside of its native range are named cultivars, selected for particular forms, textures, or foliage colours, such as very pendulous branching or shoots, a fastigiate or columnar shape, or a particularly bright blue or silvery glaucous foliage. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017). It is fully hardy only in relatively mild or coastal areas of the UK. Some healthy specimens have been reported in Canberra, Australia. Symbolism The Bhutan cypress is the official national tree of Bhutan, where it is often associated with Buddhist religious places. It has been widely planted around Vihara monasteries and Buddhist temples there for centuries.  Notable specimen  A notable specimen of Cupressus cashmeriana is situated in front of the palace on Isola Madre, the largest of the Borromean Islands in Lake Maggiore. The seeds for the tree were sent back from the Himalayan region by a correspondent of the Borromeo family, William B. Pentland, in June 1862. By 1915, the Isola Madre specimen was noted as the best in Northern Italy and measured 60ft. high, 6ft. in girth, its branches covering an area of over 35 paces in circumference. In 2006, a fierce storm on the night of 28 June knocked the tree down, necessitating a multi-disciplinary effort to save it. A team of gardeners, engineers, and cable workers worked to stabilise the tree, which is the largest specimen in Europe and then weighed 70 tons with a trunk 8 metres in diameter.

Its first recorded use as a regimental motto was by the 87th (Prince of Wales's Irish) Regiment of Foot (who later became the Royal Irish Fusiliers) in 1798. It remains the motto of the Royal Irish Regiment today.Ministry of Defence: Royal Irish RegimentMinistry of Defence (updated website)>> Royal Irish Regiment: Napoleonic Wars It was adopted due to the blood curdling battle-cry of Sergeant Patrick Masterson as he tore into the French ranks, with Ensign Keogh, to capture the first French Imperial Eagle to be taken in battle ‚Äì during the Battle of Barossa. He was then heard to cry 'Be Jabers Boys! I have the Cuckoo!' as he held it triumphantly aloft to rouse the spirits of his men. Ensign Keogh did not survive the daring dash into the French ranks. It was popularized outside Ireland during the American Civil War by the Army of the Potomac's Irish Brigade ‚Äì composed of the 69th New York Volunteer Infantry (NYVI) or \\"Fighting 69th\\", the 63rd & 88th NYVI, and later the 116th Pennsylvania and 28th Massachusetts Infantry regiments.

The motto was also adopted by the 55th Battalion of the Australian 5th Division during the First World War.

Jeddore served as chief from July 26, 1919 until he was forced into exile to Eskasoni, Nova Scotia, in 1924. He was born at Indian Point, Bay d'Espoir and he died at Eskasoni, Cape Breton. Saqamaw The name \\"Jeddore\\" can be traced back to We‚Äôjitu Isidore, (ca. 1656 ‚Äì ca. 1769) who \\"was a Kji-Saqamaw or grand chief of the Mi‚Äôkmaq of the provinces of New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and Quebec.\\" Prior to the passage of the 1876 Indian Act, the Mi'kmaq were governed by the Grand Council - Sant√© Mawi√≥mi - made up of representatives from the seven district councils in Mi'kma'ki. The chief of the Newfoundland Mi'kmak was Reuben Lewis, who was elected as probationary chief in 1900 following the death of Joe Bernard. In June 1907 Reuben Lewis was to \\"go in state with the principal men of Conn River to Sydney to be invested with the full right of chieftainship and the possession of the gold medal which is the badge of office.\\" As chief, Noel Jeddore was given guardianship of the gold medal first given to the previous district Chief Maurice Lewis by the Grand Council. Maurice Lewis came to Miawipukek originally from Cape Breton in 1815. When he left Miawpukek Jerrold hung the medal on the statue of St. Anne near the Catholic Church. The priest, St. Croix, who deposed Chief Noel Jeddore in 1924 \\"was also responsible for dismantling traditional governing structures in the community.\\" Lewis as chief made settled disputes about territorial trapping areas and his decisions were final. Noel Jeddore was known as Saqamaw Jeddore or Geodol to the Mi'kmaq of Miawpukek/Conne River. In a 1907 publication Newfoundland and It's Untrodden Ways by Millais (1865 ‚Äì 1931) the author included his favourable observations of the Jeddore family and other Conne River Mi'kmaq during his visits to Newfoundland in \\"two short hunting seasons in 1905-1906.\\" Millais observed that in the absence of a Catholic priest Conne River at Christmas time, Joe Jeddore was \\"high priest.\\" Miawpukek Miawpukek was a summer camp until Jeannot Pequidalouet - the eastern Mi'kmaq chief of Cape Breton, who had previously overwintered in Newfoundland - began to create a permanent settlement in Miawpukek from in the 1760s. In his MA thesis Butler citing Jackson described how under the leadership of Jeddore, the Mi‚Äôkmaq in the Bay D‚ÄôEspoir \\"lived in greater isolation and so were able both to retain their language well into the twentieth century and to continue their traditional practices of living as hunter-gatherers and commercial trappers.\\" Jackson described how, the \\"uninhabited wilderness of the southern interior offered an abundant variety of small game: fox, muskrat and beaver. Thousands of woodland caribou roamed the bush and barrens.\\" Prior to the early nineteenth century Mi'kmaq lived a nomadic life moving in cycles and seasons between Newfoundland and Cape Breton. In the late eighteenth or early nineteenth century they made a transition to semi-sedentary life as hunter-gatherers living \\"on the country\\" on Newfoundland itself in permanent communities lime St. George's Bay and Miawpukek in Bay d'Espoir.Anger, Dorothy. 1988. Noywa'mkisk (Where the Sand Blows ...). Vignettes of Bay St. George Micmacs. Bay St. George Regional Band Council, Port au Port East, Newfoundland. issn 0316-5981 In a 1907 publication Newfoundland and It's Untrodden Ways by John Guille Millais' (1865 ‚Äì 1931) the author included his favourable observations of the Jeddore family and other Conne River Mi'kmaq during his visits to Newfoundland in \\"two short hunting seasons in 1905-1906.\\" Like William Cormack who had undertaken an expedition in 1822 to the interior of Newfoundland with his Mi'kmaq guide Joseph Sylvester, a young Mi'kmaq hunter from Miawpukek, Bay d'Espoir, he provided details on the lives of the Newfoundland Mi'kmaq. Newfoundland Governor William MacGregor visited Bay d'Espoir in September 1908. In his report he described how the lives of Mi'kmaq on the reserve were becoming more difficult with the encroachment of the railway, a mill and settlers which contributed to the depletion of natural resources on their traditional hunting lands. MacGregor described how the Mi'kmaq there were \\"hunters and trappers, and are ignorant alike of agriculture, of seamanship, and of fishing... They pay 60 to 70 cents a pound for their tobacco, 20 to 30 cents for gunpowder, and 10 cents for shot. They sell their fur locally where they make their small family purchases.\\" Although he acknowledged that they were healthy and free of tuberculosis, resourceful, self-sufficient, \\"easy to govern\\", \\"seldom quarrel\\", with \\"no intoxicating liquor and seldom obtain any\\", he predicted that their future on the reserve was bleak. The only two cows on the reserve were owned by the Jeddore brothers. MacGregor explained that the Chieftainship was \\"not hereditary, but is conferred, when a vacancy occurs, on the man the people prefer.\\" Controversy The Mi'kmaq at Bay d'Espoir had converted to Catholicism when an early French missionary came to the area and continued to be devout Catholics. They built the first chapel in Bay d‚ÄôEspoir, Conne River in the 1870s even though there was never a regular parish priest. As chief of the Mi'kmaq, Noel Jeddore was the guardian of a prayer book watermarked in 1807 that he used for Sunday mass and other religious services - deciphering the Komqwej wi‚Äôkasikl - Mi'kmaq hieroglyphics. The prayer book which was \\"originally given by the missionaries and was in Mi‚Äôkmaq\\" \\\\- was used \\"firstly within the wigwam, then the village chapel and later at [St. Anne's Roman Catholic Church].\\" According to Noel Jeddore's son, Peter Jeddore (May 9, 1892 ‚Äì May 18, 1970), his father was exiled because of a misunderstanding with the Catholic priest, Father Stanislaus (Stanley) St. Croix, who arrived in 1916 and was based in St. Alban's as parish priest and school administrator and priest. Ethnographer Doug Jackson - who \\"began research in [Miaswpukek] in 1976 and lived there until 1981\\" - observed that St. Croix - who forbid the use of traditional language in the church and in the school, was the primary force behind the acceleration of the loss of the Mi'kmaw language in the early twentieth century. St. Croix \\"told teachers to strictly enforce the use of English in the classroom. Children were to be strapped if they reverted to Micmac, and he banned the use of Micmac in church.\\". Jackson wrote that Mi'kmaw Rod Jeddore indicated that, \\"the impact of intermarriage, economic climate, and Fr. St. Croix's ban on language\\" were \\"the primary reasons for the decline of Mi'kmaw language in the area and by the 1980s the language had largely disappeared.\\" \\"These acts together with other forces of change (including the opening of the interior of the island and increased intermarriage with Europeans) left only three fluent speakers of Mi‚Äôkmaq in the community by the mid-1980s.\\" When the first regular priest Father Stanislaus St. Croix arrived in 1916 he wanted the Mi'kmaq to join his parish in St. Albans instead of holding services in their own church. St. Croix wanted the Mi'kmaq to stop saying their prayers - particularly in the church - in Mi'kmaq as he thought it \\"mocked God.\\" During an impassioned community meeting in 1923 Noel Jeddore said that \\"if we stopped speaking Mi‚Äôkmaq in the church, there would be murder in our hearts.\\" When community members reported this to St. Croix he interpreted it to mean that Jeddore was threatening murder. He called the RCMP and Jeddore was given the choice of going to jail or exile. He along with some community members chose to go to a Mi‚Äôkmaq reserve in Eskasoni, Cape Breton with very close ties to the Conne River community. Noel Jeddore appointed his son as Chief in the 1920s but his son refused. March 10, 1996 to April 2001 According to American anthropologist and University of Pennsylvania professor Frank Speck, one of his older Mi'kmaq informants described in detail how the Mi'kmaq made the sixty mile voyage across the Cabot Strait between Cape Ray on the south-western coast of Newfoundland and Cape North, Cape Breton in two days by birch bark canoes. March 10, 1996 to April 2001 According to the Miawpukek First Nation, Jeddore said: \\"One time before they became Christians, Mi‚Äôkmaw were very strong, not even bullets could hurt them. But when they became Christian, they turned into a very weak people\\".

Career The son of a notary born in Ch√¢teauroux, Indre, Aurier went to Paris in 1883 to study law, but his attention was soon drawn to art and literature; he then began to contribute to Symbolist periodicals. He reviewed the annual Salon in Le D√©cadent, later contributed to La Plume and, in 1889, was the managing editor of Le Moderniste Illustr√©. From its foundation in 1890, he contributed to the Mercure de France, which published the essays on which Aurier's fame was founded: \\"\\" and \\"\\". After a trip to Marseille, Aurier died at the age of twenty-seven in Paris, on 5 October 1892, from a typhus infection. The next day, friends, writers and artists accompanied his coffin on the funeral train departing from the Gare d'Orsay for Ch√¢teauroux, where his remains were entombed in the family grave.On the funeral, see: G.-Albert Aurier.

Early life Elizabeth Sarah Lavinia Spencer was born with the honorific \\"The Honourable\\"'; she acquired the courtesy title \\"Lady\\" in 1975, when her grandfather died and her father became the 8th Earl Spencer. She suffered from the eating disorder anorexia nervosa in her early twenties. She was educated firstly at Riddlesworth Hall School in Norfolk and secondly at West Heath boarding school near Sevenoaks in Kent. After passing O Level exams she left West Heath to work in London. Family Sarah married Neil Edmund McCorquodale (born 4 October 1951), son of Alastair McCorquodale and Rosemary Sybil Turnor, on 17 May 1980 in Northamptonshire, England. Neil is a 2nd cousin once removed of Lady Sarah's stepmother, Raine Spencer. Neil and Lady Sarah McCorquodale have three children: *Emily Jane McCorquodale (2 July 1983); she married James T. R.

They have two children: Isabella Rosemary Hutt (18 June 2014) Henry George Thomas Hutt (25 March 2016) *George Edmund McCorquodale (17 November 1984); he married Bianca Moore, daughter of Gavin Moore, on 6 August 2016. *Celia Rose McCorquodale (1989); she married George Woodhouse on 16 June 2018 at St Andrew and St Mary's Church, Stoke Rochford, Lincolnshire, England. For her wedding, Celia wore the Spencer Tiara, which her mother and aunts Jane and Diana wore on their wedding days. Emily received radiation treatment for plasmacytoma in 2003. Career She and her family reside near Grantham, Lincolnshire where she served a one-year term as High Sheriff of Lincolnshire in 2009. She became a master of the Belvoir Hunt in May 2010. Lady Sarah was also president of the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund, which raised ¬£100 million for various charities. The Fund unsuccessfully took legal action in 1998 against the Franklin Mint over the unlicensed use of Diana's image. The Fund closed at the end of 2012. Relationships =Diana, Princess of Wales= In 1977, Sarah's relationship with Prince Charles led to the first meeting between Diana and her future husband. She later commented on her sister's marriage saying: \\"I introduced them. I'm Cupid.\\" During the period in which she dated the prince, she allegedly met two reporters, James Whittaker and Nigel Nelson, at a restaurant and gave them an exclusive report on her royal connection. She is said to have admitted to having been diagnosed with anorexia, having \\"thousands of boyfriends\\", a past problem involving alcohol, and that she had started keeping a scrapbook of all the press clippings about her royal romance that she intended to \\"show\\" future grandchildren. \\"Her head seemed to be turned by the publicity\\", the two reporters later said. She also declared that she would not marry Charles \\"if he were the dustman or the King of England\\". When the article was released, she showed it to the prince, which made him furious and he replied, \\"You've just done something incredibly stupid.\\" The relationship dissolved soon after that. Some have stated the relationship between she and Diana was strained, because of her long resentment of the Prince marrying Diana and not her, though others (including Diana's biographer Andrew Morton) have said she was one of the few people Diana trusted. Later in their lives, she often accompanied Diana on official visits as one of her ladies-in-waiting. Upon the death of Diana on 31 August 1997, Sarah flew to Paris with her younger sister, Jane, and Prince Charles to accompany Diana's body back to England. She contributed to the readings at Diana's funeral. She was co-executor of Diana's will and was president of the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund. Sarah attended the wedding of her nephew Prince William to Catherine Middleton on 29 April 2011. It is said that William and Catherine are close to Lady Sarah, with whom they spent a weekend on the 16th anniversary of Diana's death. Sarah also attended the wedding of her other nephew Prince Harry to Meghan Markle on 19 May 2018. =Friends= In 2018, Sarah spoke publicly in support of George Grant, an employee of Belvoir Hunt whom she had known for 27 years, after he assaulted foxhunt monitors. Grant along with his son and other men, assaulted the hunt monitors who were affiliated with the League Against Cruel Sports. Sarah, who served as joint master of the Belvoir Hunt, claimed that Grant's actions were out of character.

Background Clement Clerke was the third son of George Clerke of Willoughby, Warwickshire,J. Nichols, History and Antiquities of Leicestershire III(1) (1800), 326. and was created a baronet shortly after the Restoration. He was married to Sarah, daughter and heiress of George Talbot of Rudge, Shropshire. In 1657, he bought the Launde Abbey estate in Leicestershire in 1658 and this was settled on him and his wife. They had another estate at Notgrove in Gloucestershire. Iron smelting In the early 1670s, Sir Clement joined various other people in sponsoring Dud Dudley to build a furnace at Dudley to smelt iron using a mixed fuel made from wood and coal. This (uniquely) was to be powered by the strength of men and of horses. By 1674 Sir Clement and John Finch of Dudley were the only partners. Finch had other ironworks, but competition between him and Philip Foley was damaging to them both; this led them to enter into a restrictive agreement as to where they would respectively buy wood and generally limiting their activities. A few months later, John Finch sold all his works to Alderman John Foorth (of London) and Sir Clement Clerke. They also bought wood in the Forest of Dean, but found that the King's Ironworks there had been sold to Paul Foley for demolition and had to build their own furnace at Linton, Herefordshire. They then brought in further partners including John's brother Dannett Foorth and George Skippe of Ledbury. They also bought further ironworks from Philip Foley. This proved to be a troubled business because Sir Clement borrowed money from moneylenders on the security of his share (in breach of the terms of the partnership agreement). This led Dannett Foorth having him Sir Clement arrested for debt, and George Skippe bailing him out. These difficulties were resolved by the sale of the ironworks in 1676, and the dissolution of the partnership. The River Stour During their partnership, Andrew Yarranton persuaded John Foorth and Sir Clement Clerke to finance the completion of the navigation of the Worcestershire Stour. This would have been a convenience for them, as it ran near some of their works, but nothing was done except pay off some debts, due to the problems with the ironworks business. On its dissolution, George Skippe took over Foorth‚Äôs share in the navigation; new contractors (including Andrew Yarranton‚Äôs son Robert, and they were to be paid by instalments as the works progressed, but the money ran out when the river was only completed from Stourbridge to Kidderminster.A. W. Skempton et al., Biographical Dictionary of Civil Engineers I (2002), 808-13. Lead smelting By this stage, Sir Clement had exhausted his resources; the manor of Rudge was ultimately foreclosed by the mortgagee. Lord Grandison had financed a certain Samuel Hutchinson, who had a patent for smelting lead with pitcoal, but failed. Grandison then approached Sir Clement. Grandison and Robert Thorowgood (a King's Lynn merchant) provided the capital in 1678 for Sir Clement and Francis Nicholson (Grandison's dependent) to set up lead works. Sir Clement went to Bristol and built cupolas - reverberatory furnaces, but when Sir Clement went back for the rest of the capital, he found that Nicholson had taken it to Derbyshire and lost it. In 1683, there was a complicated agreement to the effect that business should be carried on by Sir Clement's son Talbot, but he was not quite 21 years old so that the business had to be in the name of a trustee. The business was in fact profitable. Talbot sought to declare a dividend, but Lord Grandison and his fellow financier, Hon. Henry Howard demanded that they be repaid money that they said Sir Clement owed them. This led to litigation, during the course of which one Gravely Claypoole was appointed by the court to run the works for Grandison. The litigation was ultimately resolved in Talbot's favour.P. W. King, 'The cupola at Bristol' Somerset Archaeol. & Nat. Hist. 140 (1997), 37-51. Another venture related to the production of white lead. This was in the names of Talbot's trustee an Grandison's son Edward Fitzgerald Villiers, but was evidently not successful, with the result that money had to be obtained by mortgaging Launde Abbey to repay Villiers. Copper and company flotations In 1687, while the lead cupola was out of their possession, Sir Clement and Talbot built a reverberatory furnace at Putney and smelted copper there. A patent was obtained for this in 1688. This led to the establishment of a copper smelting works close to the banks of the River Wye at Redbrook and the chartering of the English Copper Company. With the conclusion of the litigation, the cupola near Bristol reverted to Talbot Clerke. The Company for Smelting down Lead with Pitcoal (later in different ownership known as the London Lead Company) was chartered to run this, but this was evidently not successful and returned to Talbot (by then Sir Talbot) in 1695. 'A work for remelting and casting old iron with sea coal' was built at 'Fox Hall' (probably Vauxhall under the direction of Sir Clement. This was the first reverberatory furnace (in this case known as an 'air furnace') to be built for iron foundry purposes. This seems to have formed the basis for the Company for Making Iron with Pitcoal, though it may also have been intended to exploit a patent granted to Thomas Addison in 1692. The company ran its foundry for a few years, with Thomas Fox (the brother of Shadrach Fox of Coalbrookdale) as founder.P. W. King, 'Sir Clement Clerke and the Adoption of Coal in metallurgy' Trans. Newcomen Soc. 73(1) (2001-2), 33-52. Impact Sir Clement apparently guided many of these developments; though he probably did not personally benefit from them financially, his sons probably did. Sir Clement is certainly to be credited with the practical application of the reverberatory furnace (or cupola) to several metallurgical processes. Until the introduction in the late 18th century of the foundry cupola (which is a sort of small blast furnace), his air furnace was the normal way of remelting pig for foundry purposes. The cupola (reverberatory furnace) long remained in use for smelted copper and lead, and was applied by Robert Lyddall to tin. It is not clear where he obtained his knowledge of metallurgy, but it is possible that Dud Dudley was his teacher; certainly, his lead smelting efforts seem to be foreshadowed by an enterprise involving Dud Dudley at Okham Slade (location unknown) in Clifton, Bristol. Sir Clement died in debt in 1693. His baronetcy passed to Talbot, as did Launde Abbey, which was not swallowed by his debts because of his marriage settlement.

The park is on the site of the outer court of Reading Abbey, which was in front of the Abbey Church. The site was formerly known as the Forbury, and one of the roads flanking the current gardens is still known as The Forbury. Fairs were held on the site three times a year until the 19th century. The gardens are listed as Grade II in the English Heritage Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. Forbury, a suburb of the New Zealand city of Dunedin, was named after the gardens by early resident William Henry Valpy, who was born in Reading. History St Laurence's Church, c. 1875 by Henry Taunt =Early years= Reading Abbey was founded in 1121, by Henry I, and for the next four centuries it dominated the town, becoming one of the most influential establishments in England. Like other such monasteries, Reading had a forbury, or 'borough in front', an area of open land which provided a meeting place between the Abbey and the town. The Forbury in Reading was part of the outer court of the Abbey, and provided a market place as well as a meeting place. In 1150, what is now Forbury Hill was constructed to help fortify the Abbey during the civil war between King Henry I's daughter Matilda and his nephew Stephen. The abbey was largely destroyed in 1538 during Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries. The last abbot, Hugh Cook Faringdon, was tried and convicted of high treason, and hanged, drawn and quartered in front of the Abbey Church. After this, the buildings of the abbey were extensively looted, with lead, glass and facing stones removed for reuse elsewhere, and the focus of the town moved away from the Forbury. Forbury Hill, used as a gun emplacement in the civil war Reading suffered badly during the English Civil War, being occupied at different times by both sides. During the Siege of Reading (1642‚Äì43), the Royalist garrison built defences that further damaged the remains of the Abbey, and Forbury Hill was used as a gun emplacement. As a result of the concerns sparked in England by the French Revolution, and throughout the ensuing Napoleonic Wars, the Forbury was used for military drills and parades, in addition to its well-established use for fairs and circuses. Three annual fairs were generally held on the Forbury, but the most significant was the Michaelmas Fair, held in September. This fair became known as the Reading Cheese Fair, although cattle, horses and hops were also sold, and it served as the principal local hiring fair. =19th century= By the first years of the 19th century, the western part of the Forbury was in use as a playground or sports ground for Reading School, which at this time was housed in the former Hospitium of St John. However the whole of the Forbury was in private ownership, and disputes were common as to the common rights of the town and the rights of the school. In 1854, Forbury Hill and the eastern section of the present gardens were sold to Reading Corporation at the cost of ¬£1200, of which ¬£400 was donated by the previous owner, a Mr Wheble. The resulting gardens were planned with a 'botanical character', a fountain and a summer house, and became known as the Pleasure Gardens. Work started in 1855 and the Pleasure Gardens opened on Easter Sunday 1856. A tunnel was built on the eastern side in 1859 to link the gardens and the Abbey ruins. The success of the Pleasure Gardens contrasted with the situation in the western part of the Forbury, which was still used for fairs. After one fair, the area was described as being covered 'with heaps of oyster shells, manure and other refuse'. In 1860, this section of the Forbury was purchased by the town for ¬£6010 from Colonel Blagrave. It was decided that fairs should no longer be held there, but the emphasis remained on recreational use rather than botanical display, with the area grassed except for the outside walks and a gravelled parade ground. The common ownership notwithstanding, the two halves of the Forbury remained very different in character, and separated by a wall. However in 1869 the town purchased of King's Meadow, the abbey's former water meadow by the River Thames, as a recreation ground. This paved the way for the incorporation, in 1873, of the western part of the Forbury into the gardens, which then became known as Forbury Gardens. The Maiwand Lion statue was erected in 1886 to commemorate the loss of 286 soldiers (though the exact number varies by account) from the 66th Royal Berkshire Regiment at the Battle of Maiwand in Afghanistan on 27 July 1880. The sculptor of this 31-foot statue was George Blackall Simonds and it was unveiled in December 1886. It is sometimes known locally as the Forbury Lion. A cross memorializing Henry I was put up, at about the same time as the Maiwand Lion, on the north-west corner of the footings of the Abbey Church. The Victoria Gates on the southern side of the gardens commemorate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897. =21st century= In 2015, a statue was unveiled to the memory of Trooper Fred Potts VC, who was awarded the Victoria Cross in October 1915 after endangering his own life to drag a wounded comrade from the battlefield at the Battle of Scimitar Hill. The statue is just outside the garden wall, facing the Crown Court building. In the same year, the Reading International Brigade Memorial was relocated from the Civic Centre to the east side of the gardens, and rededicated. On 20 June 2020, three people were killed and three others seriously injured in a mass stabbing at the Forbury Gardens. The incident is being treated as a terrorist incident. The gardens today Map of Forbury Gardens today A grand re-opening event took place on 14 May 2005 to mark the completion of a one-year restoration project. The Heritage Lottery Fund awarded Reading Borough Council ¬£2.13 million to restore the historic features of the Forbury Gardens and improve safety and access for visitors. The scheme was developed in consultation with residents and interested local groups. Work in the gardens themselves has included the restoration of the Maiwand Lion, the bandstand, water feature and the garden's walls, fencing and gateways. A new Keeper's Lodge also includes a refreshment kiosk, public toilets and facilities for a resident gardener. Reading Borough Council organises summer concerts in the bandstand on Sunday afternoons during July and August. After the restoration, closed-circuit cameras monitor the whole Gardens area, in a bid to deter drug use and anti- social behaviour. The garden has received a Green Flag Award for being welcoming, safe, well maintained and involving the community. The Forbury Hill is now accessible by two winding footpaths (wheelchair-accessible) that lead to an area that is elevated about 3 metres above the surrounding gardens. A single plane tree stands in the middle, and around the outer edge of the top of the hill are wooden seats. See also2020 Reading stabbings The stabbings happened in these gardens.

Calmness is the mental state of peace of mind being free from agitation, excitement, or disturbance. It also refers being in a state of serenity, tranquillity, or peace. Calmness can most easily occur for the average person during a state of relaxation, but it can also be found during much more alert and aware states.A Ben-Ze‚Äôer, The Subtlety of Emotions (2001) p. 57 Some people find that focusing the mind on something external, such as studying, or even internal, such as the breathing, can itself be very calming. Calm can also mean numerous words such as ‚Äúyes‚Äù, ‚Äúno‚Äù, ‚Äúrelax‚Äù, ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù and many other words. According to Asiphe Hlelo Gwala (2020) states that if someone is to ask a question or make a statement the response ‚Äúcalm‚Äù can provide a well known understanding based on the circumstances. E.g. ‚ÄúHey would you like to come to the party?‚Äù ‚ÄúCalm, I'll see you there‚Äù or ‚Äúcalm, I'll have to check‚Äù or ‚ÄúCalm‚Äù Childhood origins Parental soothing (by rocking, holding etc.) in infancy lays the foundations of the capacity to self-calm.A Schore, Affect Regulation and the Origin of Self (Hillsdale 1994) p. 226 Thereafter transitional objects can help maintain calmness,D W Winnicott, The Child, the Family and the Outside World (Penguin 1973) p. 168-9 while pets as self-objects also promote soothing and calm.C Blazina ed., The Psychology of the Human-Animal Bond (2011) p. 154 Cultivating calmness Calmness is a quality that can be cultivated and increased with practice, or developed through psychotherapy.D Goleman, Emotional Intelligence (London 1996) p. 214 It usually takes a trained mind to stay calm in the face of a great deal of different stimulation, and possible distractions, especially emotional ones. The negative emotions are the greatest challenge to someone who is attempting to cultivate a calm mind. Some disciplines that promote and develop calmness are prayer, yoga, relaxation training, breath training, and meditation. Jon Kabat-Zinn states that ‚ÄúConcentration is a cornerstone of mindfulness practice. Your mindfulness will only be as robust as the capacity of your mind to be calm and stable. Without calmness, the mirror of mindfulness will have an agitated and choppy surface and will not be able to reflect things with any accuracy.‚Äù Sarah Wilson recommends reducing one's exposure to choices/decisions as a route to calm.S Wilson, First, We Make the Beast Beautiful (London 2018) p. 210-11 Peace of mind Another term usually associated with calmness is \\"peace\\". A mind that is at peace or calm will cause the brain to produce \\"good\\" hormones, which in turn give the person a stable emotional state and promote good health in every area of life, including marriage. Seeing the rise in crime and diseases around the world which are more often than not the consequences of the emotions going 'out-of- control', it is therefore considered beneficial for many to stay calm and cultivate it in every possible situation, especially during stressful events such as demise of a family member or failure in business. Etymology The term comes from Middle English calme, from Old French, from Old Italian calmo, from Late Latin cauma, \\"heat of the day\\", the \\"resting place in the heat of the day\\", from Greek kauma, burning heat, from kaiein, to burn. Cultural examplesGibbon praised Boethius: ‚Äúthe sage who could artfully combine in the same work, the various riches of philosophy, poetry, and eloquence, must already have possessed the intrepid calmness, which he affected to seek‚Äù.E Gibbon, Abridged Decline and Fall (Penguin 2005) p. 444 *Rear Admiral Spruance, carrier commander at the Battle of Midway, was nicknamed Electric Brain because of his calmness in the hottest action.R Overy, Why the Allies Won (London 2006) p. 46 *Lord David Cecil saw Wuthering Heights as dominated by the contrast between what he called on the one hand ‚Äúthe principle of storm...and on the other, the principle of calm ‚Äì of the gentle, the merciful, the passive, and the tame‚Äù.Quoted in R Wallace, Emily Bronte and Beethoven (2008) p. 49 See also References Category:Positive mental attitude Category:Happiness Category:Emotions ","title":"Calmness"},{"id":"5976313","text":"Crops are harvested in fields at the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas, or ICARDA, site in Terbol, Bekaa Valley. The International Center for Agriculture Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA), a member of the CGIAR, supported by the CGIAR Fund, is a non-profit agricultural research institute that aims to improve the livelihoods of the resource-poor across the world's dry areas. History ICARDA has been temporarily headquartered in Beirut, Lebanon, since leaving Aleppo, Syria in 2012. Support is provided by research centers and offices in Jordan, Morocco, Ethiopia, Egypt, Tunisia, Turkey, Afghanistan, India, Iran, Oman, Pakistan, Sudan, Uzbekistan, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Established in 1977, ICARDA's origins lie in a 1973 study that highlighted the food security challenges faced by countries across the dry regions of the Near East and North Africa. ICARDA research activities include the development of new crop varieties, water harvesting, conservation agriculture, the diversification of production systems, integrated crop/rangeland/livestock production systems, and the empowerment of rural women. A seed bank in the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas, or ICARDA, site in Bekaa Valley holds around 40,000 seed samples ‚Äî compared to 150,000 in Syria Decentralization ICARDA's decentralization builds on the Center's existing organization. Staff have been relocated to Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Ethiopia, Egypt, Tunisia, and Turkey, and the Center has established temporary headquarters in Beirut, Lebanon. =Integrated Research Platforms= As part of its decentralization, ICARDA has established integrated research platforms that address research priorities in each region, but serve dry areas globally through collaboration and partnerships with national programs, advanced research institutions, and other partners in the development and dissemination of international public goods. The Center has developed four major Platforms, including the headquarters: Headquarters (West Asia): ICARDA has established temporary headquarters in Beirut, Lebanon, and expanded facilities and activities in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan. Syria and Jordan also host a CRP Dryland Systems Action Site. North Africa, with a Platform in Morocco: Building on the existing partnership with INRA (Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique), and focused on the intensification and diversification of rainfed cereal-based production systems.

The ride was developed by Reverchon Industries. The ride is heavily themed around the concept of the rider as a rat attempting to escape from Kennywood exterminators. The concept is a pun of the phrase \\"Wild Mouse roller coaster\\", which describes this type of coaster, characterized by small cars (4 people/car for Exterminator) and sharp turns. Much of the theming takes place in the line for the ride, which includes such elaborate media as fake news broadcasts, and is usually the park's longest, being usually or beyond a 2 hour wait. The ride is very dark and unique, as the introduction says \\"unlike any ride you've rode before\\". The tracks are fast, rough, include a few sudden falls, and end with a fast finale that includes flashing lights, and the car seemingly spinning out of control. Like other spinning wild mouse coasters, the cars face forwards for the first half of the ride, but are free to spin during the second half.

An adder stone is a type of stone, usually glassy, with a naturally occurring hole through it. Such stones have been discovered by archaeologists in both Britain and Egypt. Commonly, they are found in Northern Germany at the coasts of the North and Baltic Seas. In Britain they are also called hag stones, witch stones, serpent's eggs, snake's eggs, or Glain Neidr in Wales, milpreve in Cornwall, adderstanes in the south of Scotland and Gloine nan Druidh (\\"Druids' glass\\" in Scottish Gaelic) in the north. In Germany they are called H√ºhnerg√∂tter (\\"chicken gods\\"). In Egypt they are called aggry or aggri. Three traditions exist as to the origins of adder stones. One holds that the stones are the hardened saliva of large numbers of serpents massing together, the perforations being caused by their tongues. The second claims that an adder stone comes from the head of a serpent or is made by the sting of an adder. The third is more modern (and much easier to attain). It details that the stone can be any rock with a hole bored through the middle by water. Human intervention (i.e., direction of water or placement of the stone) is not allowed.Roud, Steve (2003). The Penguin Guide to the Superstitions of Britain and Ireland. Pub. Penguin : London. P. 420. The Druids Adder stone was held in high esteem amongst the Druids. It was one of their distinguishing badges, and was accounted to possess the most extraordinary virtues. There is a passage in Pliny‚Äôs Natural History, book XXII, describing the nature and the properties of this amulet. The following is a translation of it: : There is a sort of egg in great repute among the Gauls, of which the Greek writers have made no mention. A vast number of serpents are twisted together in summer, and coiled up in an artificial knot by their saliva and slime; and this is called \\"the serpent's egg\\". The druids say that it is tossed in the air with hissings and must be caught in a cloak before it touches the earth. The person who thus intercepts it, flies on horseback; for the serpents will pursue him until prevented by intervening water. This egg, though bound in gold will swim against the stream. And the magi are cunning to conceal their frauds, they give out that this egg must be obtained at a certain age of the moon. I have seen that egg as large and as round as a common sized apple, in a chequered cartilaginous cover, and worn by the Druids. It is wonderfully extolled for gaining lawsuits, and access to kings. It is a badge which is worn with such ostentation, that I knew a Roman knight, a Vocontian, who was slain by the stupid emperor Claudius, merely because he wore it in his breast when a lawsuit was pending.\\"Pliny, Naturalis Historia Book XXII\\" , para XII, http://www.history-archive.org/ Huddleston's edition of John Toland's \\"History of the Druids\\" gives some very ingenious conjectures on the subject of this very enigmatical Druids' egg. The amulets of glass and stone, which are still preserved and used with implicit faith in many parts of Scottish Gaeldom, and are conveyed, for the cure of diseases to a great distance, seem to have their origin in this bauble of ancient priestcraft.The Esoteric Codex: Magic Objects I, April 18, 2014 by Mark Rogers In Welsh mythology The Glain Neidr or Maen Magi of Welsh folklore is also closely connected to Druidism. The Glain Neidr of Wales are believed to be created by a congress of snakes, normally occurring in spring, but most auspicious on May Eve. Although not named as Glain Neidr, magic stones with the properties of adder stones appear frequently in Welsh mythology and folklore. The Mabinogion, translated into English in the mid-nineteenth century by Lady Charlotte Guest, mentions such stones on two occasions. In the story of Peredur son of Efrawg (Percival of the Arthurian cycle), in a departure from Chr√©tien de Troyes' Perceval, the Story of the Grail, Peredur is given a magical stone that allows him to see and kill an invisible creature called the Addanc. In another tale, Owain, or the Lady of the Fountain (Ywain of Arthurian legend), the hero Owain mab Urien is trapped in the gatehouse of a castle. He is given a stone by a maiden, which turns Owain invisible, allowing him to escape capture.  In Irish mythology  Serpents, not being present in Ireland, don't often feature in Irish mythology, yet other creatures can form parallels. The legendary druid Mug Ruith was said to have a stone which could turn into a poisonous eel when thrown in water, this may be a reference to an Adder Stone.  In Russian mythology  In Russian folklore, adder stones were believed to be the abodes of spirits called Kurinyi Bog (\\"The Chicken God\\"). Kurinyi Bog were the guardians of chickens, and their stones were placed into farmyards to counteract the possible evil effects of the Kikimora (The wives of the Domovoi, the house spirits.) Kikimora, who also guarded and took care of chickens, could often unleash misery upon hens they did not like by plucking out their feathers.

Early life and education Lady Fellowes is the second daughter of Edward John Spencer, 8th Earl Spencer (1924‚Äì1992) and the Hon. Frances Ruth Burke Roche (1936‚Äì2004). Her parents married in 1954 but divorced in 1969. She has always used her middle name of Jane (just as her elder sister also uses one of her middle names). One of Jane's godparents is Prince Edward, Duke of Kent. She was a bridesmaid at his 1961 wedding to Katharine Worsley. Like her sisters, Lady Fellowes was educated at West Heath boarding school near Sevenoaks in Kent. Sources say she was an excellent student, achieving the status of school Prefect and passing a good number of A-level exams. To paraphrase Andrew Morton, Lady Fellowes acquired a \\"hatful\\" of O-level and A-level exams.Andrew Morton, Diana: Her True Story. Marriage and children On 20 April 1978, Jane married her distant relation Robert Fellowes (b. 1941), then assistant private secretary to the Queen. During the ceremony at Westminster Abbey, Jane's sister Diana was a bridesmaid. On 12 July 1999, Robert Fellowes was granted a life peerage as Baron Fellowes, of Shotesham in the County of Norfolk, after first being knighted as Sir Robert Fellowes.House of Lords, Minutes and Order Paper ‚Äì Minutes of Proceedings, 26 October 1999. Lord and Lady Fellowes have three children and four grandchildren: *The Honourable Laura Jane Fellowes (19 July 1980); married Nicholas Peter Pettman on 30 May 2009. The couple have two sons. *The Honourable Alexander Robert Fellowes (23 March 1983); married Alexandra Finlay on 20 September 2013. They have two children: Robert George Fellowes (10 April 2015) Rose Jane Fellowes (10 August 2016) *The Honourable Eleanor Ruth Fellowes (20 August 1985) These children are maternal first cousins of Prince William and Prince Harry and also paternal second cousins of Sarah, Duchess of York. Laura is godmother to Prince William's daughter, Princess Charlotte. Lady Diana Spencer came up to Scotland in the summer of 1980 to help with her sister's newborn daughter, Laura Jane and, during that time, was allegedly courted by the Prince of Wales. Relationship with Diana, Princess of Wales After Diana's death, conflicting views about the two sisters' relationship were voiced. Diana's butler Paul Burrell stated that the relationship was strained because of Lord Fellowes's position as secretary to the Queen, and that by the time of Diana's death they had not spoken in a number of years.Paul Burrell, A Royal Duty, 2003. On the other hand, Diana's childhood nanny, Mary Clarke, author of memoirs about the nanny's experience raising Diana, stated that the relations between the Baroness and Diana were not as bitter as Burrell and others have said or assumed.Mary Clarke, Little Girl Lost: The Troubled Childhood of Princess Diana by the Woman who Raised Her. It is not clear when their relationship deteriorated (if it did), but the sisters were neighbours on the Kensington Palace estate, with Diana living at Numbers 8 and 9, and Lady Fellowes living at a house called the Old Barracks.Lady Colin Campbell, Diana in Private... Sarah and Lady Fellowes flew to Paris with their former brother-in-law Prince Charles to escort the Princess's body back for the public funeral. Witnesses reported that Lady Fellowes was very upset and needed to be assisted into a chair after seeing Diana's body at the hospital in Paris. Sarah and Lady Fellowes played a part in the public funeral ceremony. Since Diana's death, Lord and Lady Fellowes have led a largely private life along with their three children. Lady Fellowes attended the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton on 29 April 2011. She also attended the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle on 19 May 2018, at which she delivered a reading.

Career =Club= D√∏ssing was born in Viborg, Jutland and started his career with his hometown club Viborg FF in 1958, aged 17. With the help of Jack Johnson, a former manager of B 1913, D√∏ssing got in contact with Dundee United. He played a trial match for the club, scoring all four goals in a 4‚Äì0 win. In December 1964, he signed his first professional contract, and moved to Dundee United under manager Jerry Kerr. United had made a poor start to the 1964‚Äì65 First Division season and appeared to be heading towards relegation until Kerr took a gamble in bringing some of the first foreigners to play in Scotland. D√∏ssing scoring 21 goals in only 19 matches during his first season, helping the club move into mid-table security that year. From December 1964 to March 1965, he scored in 13 consecutive league games. The following season, D√∏ssing scored 25 goals, helping United to finished in fifth place in the league and qualify for European competition for the first time. Injury would limit D√∏ssing's involvement in United's 1966-67 Fairs Cup campaign, keeping him out of both victories against FC Barcelona and the first game against Juventus. In the home leg against the Italian club, he returned to score the game‚Äôs only goal. D√∏ssing left Dundee United after three years, having scored 76 goals in 115 appearances, returning to Denmark to play for Aalborg BK (AaB). According to the Danish rules of amateurism, D√∏ssing was dictated a half year quarantine before he was eligible to play in the Danish championship. He entered an AaB team which had not won in their first eight matches, and helped the club finish in mid-table. Days before the opening of the 1969 season, D√∏ssing decided to leave AaB, moving back to Viborg to run his own gents‚Äô outfitters business. D√∏ssing retains his association with Dundee United by his membership of the ArabTRUST (the club's supporters trust) and with one of the Federation of Dundee United Supporters' Clubs, in Argyll, being named after him. When Dundee United launched a club Hall of Fame in 2008, he was one of the first players to be inducted. =International= D√∏ssing played a number of Danish national youth team matches, and made his debut for the Denmark under-21 team in September 1963.

Biography =Early life and education= James was born in 1919, he was the oldest son of Sir Archibald James and Bridget James Miller (n√©e Guthrie). He went first to Summer Fields School in Oxford and then Eton. He left Eton at the age of 17, sailing round the world \\"before the mast\\" in the 4-masted barque Viking as a trainee officer. He then joined his father on a trip to Spain where he observed the ongoing Spanish Civil War. In 1938 he went up to Balliol College, Oxford, to read Geography, but left after four terms to join the RNVR. =Wartime service= In June 1940, he became a midshipman on HMS Drake. Later on he served on an armed merchant cruiser patrolling the Denmark Strait. In December 1941, he became the second in command of Motor Gun Boat No.63 operating out of Felixstowe. In the early hours of Sunday 28 February 1943, his then vessel MGB 79, was sunk in action off the Hook of Holland. James and three of his crew were rescued from the water by a German trawler and were taken prisoner, later earned the DSC for this action. He was sent to Marlag O, the naval prisoner-of-war camp near Westertimke. He attempted to escape in December 1943, slipping out of the shower block on a foggy morning, then crossed Germany wearing his full British naval uniform, but with forged papers identifying him as \\"I. Bagerov\\" of the Bulgarian Navy. James made it as far as the port of L√ºbeck and had made contact with the crew of a Swedish ship willing to smuggle him out of the country before he was arrested, and returned to the camp. His second escape in late 1944 used the same method, relying on the corrupt shower-block guards not to report their own short head-count. James again headed for the Baltic coast, posing as a merchant seaman, and this time made it to Sweden.Escaper's Progress: The Remarkable POW Experiences of a Royal Naval Officer. His successful escape earned him an Order of the British Empire and a spot at the Naval Intelligence Division where he lectured his colleagues on escape methods. Believing that his experience would be of no use in the Middle East where he was to be transferred he joined Operation Tabarin in 1944, wintering in Graham Land until January 1946. In consequence, the James Nunatak was named after him by the British Antarctic Survey. A self- penned account of his 11 months in (and out of) the camp was published in the UK as A Prisoner's Progress in Blackwood's Magazine (1946‚Äì7), then in book form by Blackwoods in 1947, with a second edition in 1954A Prisoner's Progress. London: Hollis & Carter, 1954 and in the U..S under the title Escaper's Progress.W. W. Norton 1955 A review at the time described the work as \\"one of the better escape books\\". In 1978, when the book was re-published in the UK in paperback as Escaper's Progress (Corgi), his original account of the escape, as prepared for Naval Intelligence Division was included as an appendix, having become de-classified. This has again been republished by Pen & Sword Ltd. =Post-war career= James was then chosen to act as Polar Advisor to director Charles Frend for the 1948 film production of Scott of the Antarctic, during which he appeared as John Mills' \\"body double\\" in a number of long shots in the snow. Never one to miss a book opportunity, James wrote Scott of the Antarctic: The Film and Its Production which was published by Lon Convoy, followed a year later, in 1949, by That Frozen Land: The Story of a Year in the Antarctic. Being the only near contemporary account of Operation Tabarin That Frozen Land avoided referring to its geopolitical objectives. James was asked by George G. Harrap and Co. to co-edit, with James Lennox Kerr, a book of wartime stories and experiences of RNVR members entitled Wavy Navy - By Some Who Served. (1950), and was then chosen by the daughter of Lord Roberts of Kandahar to write her father's biography, published by Hollis & Carter under the title Lord Roberts (1954). In 1957 James wrote a book entitled Outward Bound, with a foreword by the Duke of Edinburgh, about the organisation of the same name and in 1960 co-edited, with The Field editor Wilson Stephens, In Praise of Fox Hunting, a series of essays by contributors such as Dick Francis, Jimmy Edwards and BBC show jumping commentator Dorian Williams. In 1962, weeks before the birth of his youngest son, he featured on This Is Your Life, having been ambushed at Victoria Station by Eamonn Andrews and his red book, getting off the train from his home town of Haywards Heath. Although born into a Church of England family, he was a director of Catholic publishing house Burns & Oates, having been received into the church whilst a POW. =Member of parliament= He was Member of Parliament for Brighton Kemptown from 1959 to 1964, when he lost, after a record seven recounts, by just 7 votes to Labour's Dennis Hobden (the first Labour MP for a Sussex constituency). James was subsequently elected as MP for North Dorset in 1970 and he served as member for that seat until his retirement in 1979, when he was succeeded by Sir Nicholas Baker. In the 1964 election when he lost his Brighton seat, the narrowness of the result led to speculation that his stance on this 'issue' had been used against him by his political opponents, and may have proved decisive. His own view was that his campaign was sabotaged by extreme left wing infiltrators, in revenge for the assistance he had given to the exposure of ballot rigging in the Electrical Trades Union. Personal life On 20 May 1950, he married Jaquetta Mary Theresa (n√©e Digby) (28 October 1928 ‚Äì 22 February 2019), youngest daughter of Edward Kenelm Digby, 11th Baron Digby and sister of Pamela Churchill Harriman and Edward Digby, 12th Baron Digby. They had six children, four sons and two daughters, born between 1951 and 1962. In 1979 he changed his name to David Guthrie-James to mark the connection between Clan Guthrie and his family home Torosay Castle on the Isle of Mull. Interested in the existence of the Loch Ness Monster, he co- founded the Loch Ness Phenomena Investigation Bureau with naturalist Sir Peter Scott in 1962. His friend John Robson wrote his biography which was published under the title One Man in His Time (Spellmount Ltd. 1998).

The rockets nozzle assembly had 10 jet nozzles ordered evenly in a circle with an electrical contact plate in the middle. The bottom ring of the rocket engine had the lot number \\"–ì –ò–® 4 25 - 6 7 - 179 –ö\\" engraved, which means it was produced in 1967 by factory 179 (Sibselmash plant in Novosibirsk). However, no warhead was observed at the impact site and none of the 13 environmental samples taken in the Western Ghouta area tested positive for sarin, although three had \\"degradation and/or by-products\\" possibly originating from sarin. On 18 September, the Russian Presidential Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov commented on the U.N. missions findings. He said \\"these rockets were supplied to dozens of countries\\", but that \\"the Soviet Union never supplied warheads with sarin to anyone\\".

It forms gradually from realgar under exposure to light. Its name derives from the fact that its elemental composition is identical to realgar, As4S4. It is soft with a Mohs hardness of 1 - 1.5, is yellow orange in colour, and its monoclinic prismatic crystals are very brittle, easily crumbling to powder. It is one of the sulfides of arsenic and is one of two isomers of As4S4. It forms upon exposure of the symmetrical isomer to light. Its name derives from the fact that its elemental composition is identical to realgar, As4S4. Structure The two isomers of As4S4: realgar (left) and pararealgar. Both isomers of As4S4 are molecular, in contrast to the other main sulfide of arsenic, orpiment (As2S3), which is polymeric. In pararealgar, there are three kinds of As centres (and three kinds of S centres). The molecule has Cs symmetry. In realgar, the four As (and four S) centres are equivalent and the molecule has D2d symmetry.Paola Bonazzi, Silvio Menchetti, Giovanni Pratesi \\"The crystal structure of pararealgar, As4S4\\" American Mineralogist, 1995, vol.80 400. An analogous pair of isomers is also recognized for the corresponding phosphorus sulfides P4S4. Occurrence Pararealgar occurs as an alteration product of realgar in stibnite-bearing quartz veins typically as a result of exposure to light. It occurs associated with realgar, stibnite, tetrahedrite, arsenopyrite, duranusite, native arsenic, arsenolite, native sulfur, lepidocrocite and pyrite. It was first described in 1980 for an occurrence in the Grey Rock Mine, Truax Creek, Bridge River area, Lillooet Mining Division, British Columbia, Canada. It has since been reported from a variety of locations worldwide. =Formation= As stated above, pararealgar is an alteration product of realgar resulting from exposure to light. The process of alteration is dependent on the wavelength of light, with alteration only occurring at wavelengths longer than approximately 500 nm, in the visible light spectrum. In realgar's crystal structure, each arsenic atom is bonded to two sulphur atoms and one other arsenic atom. The As-As bonds are 30% weaker than the As-S bonds and certain wavelengths of lights interact with the crystal structure of realgar, breaking the weaker bonds between arsenic atoms. The free As formed as a result of this process destabilises the realgar structure, causing the realgar to become powdery pararealgar without changing overall chemical composition.

The Wisconsin camp was the first of the Ramah camps, established in 1947 by Rabbi Ralph Simon, under the direction of Conservative educator Henry Goldberg, with nearly 100 campers. It was sponsored by the Chicago Council of Conservative Synagogues and the Midwest Branch of the United Synagogue. It draws campers from across the Midwest, primarily Chicago and the Twin Cities. Campers stay at the camp for either four or eight weeks, depending on their age division, or \\"eidah\\". Following Nivonim, the eidah for those entering 11th grade, campers are encouraged to participate in Ramah Israel Seminar. The summer following Seminar, they may apply to join the camp staff. The Camp Ramah Executive Director is Jacob Cytryn. The Director Emeritus of Ramah Wisconsin is Rabbi David Soloff.  History  The first Ramah camp was built on a site purchased by the Jewish Theological Seminary on Larsen's Bay. The property was a fishing village on the shores of Upper Lake Buckatabon owned by the Larsen family, dotted with small cabins and wild flowers. Multi-purpose buildings were quickly erected, and the first campers arrived by train on the Flambau Express line. According to Shom Sefor Klaff's interview for the 50th reunion (Klaff was a camper in 1947), a seaplane brought the weekly movie to the camp. Klaff added that campers had a dress code to follow, especially for shabbat. Irving Robbin, a former prisoner of war of the Nazis, was President of the camp for 19 years. In 1962, 260 boys and girls were campers during the summer. In July 2008, busloads of campers from the camp took part in a rally in support of immigrant workers at the nation's largest kosher meat plant.

The Tikvah program is designed for campers with learning and social difficulties, including Asperger syndrome.Tikvah Program , Ramah Wisconsin The program at Ramah Wisconsin includes a special \\"Mo'adon\\", or lounge building, with a kitchen and dedicated resources for the program. = Atzmayim (Vocational program) = \\"Atzmayim\\", meaning independent ones, is the name for the Tikvah vocational program. This is an eight-week program established shortly after 2002 focused on former Tikvah campers who are post-high school age. Participants work in the nearby town of Eagle River five mornings a week. Job locations include coffee shops, plant and garden supply stores, supermarkets and hotels. Participants return in the afternoon for a Judaica class and activities. Participants have their own lounge and kitchen, and live in dedicated staff housing. Participants have one day off a week, and do not work on Shabbat.  Jewish values  =Tefilot = Campers lead their own services three times a day, with each age division assigned its own Makom Tefilah (place of prayer). Camper responsibility for the services increases as campers age, with the oldest eidot not only leading, but reading torah and haftorah, and even providing divrei Torah. Campers who do not have these liturgical skills sometimes spend their free time at camp learning how to lead services. Friday nights feature an all-camp service on the waterfront. =Shabbat= Ramah in Wisconsin is a Shabbat-observant camp. Many campers and staff members are not Sabbath observant at home, so Ramah in Wisconsin may be their first exposure to being \\"Shomer Shabbat.\\" Campers and staff are not prohibited from using personal electronic devices in the cabin, but all are asked not to use such devices in public during Shabbat. Raw food is not cooked in the kitchen on Shabbat, but pre-cooked food is warmed in a manner that is permitted by Jewish law. Shabbat is brought in all-camp Friday night services, which features campers dressing up for the evening, taking pictures in groups, and having time to sit and talk with friends and siblings. The service often features the melodies of Orthodox Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach. A special Shabbat dinner follows. Campers get to wake up later on Saturday mornings than they do on weekdays. After Shacharit and Musaf services which start the day, they have free time, which is often spent on the sports fields. After lunch, campers participate in Shabbat discussions, which are usually efforts to connect the weekly parsha with modern Jewish life. Shabbat concludes with Seudah Shlishit, evening activities and Havdalah. The kikar, or center of camp, in 2007. The old Chadar Ochel is featured in back before the new one was built in 2009. =Kashrut= Ramah in Wisconsin is a Kashrut-observant camp. Many campers and staff members are not Kashrut observant at home, so Ramah in Wisconsin may be their first exposure to keeping kosher. Camper orientation involves learning about the meat and dairy sides of the kitchen. Meals are served as either dairy or meat meals (even when the meal is parve, and full-time mashgichim (kashrut supervisors) are present in the kitchen throughout the day. Only strictly kosher products are allowed in the camp, so food is not allowed in from outside. Campers are thus able to see that keeping kashrut can be part of a regular life.  Education  The educational goals of the Ramah camps are to make Jewish learning a part of the everyday camp experience, using a combination of formal and informal educational tools. Campers are theoretically required to participate in six hours of Jewish studies a week during the school year. This requirement is often waived, as most Conservative synagogues do not offer the requisite number of hours. While not actually shown in the camp brochure, or talked about by campers in the promotional video, campers have two mandatory classes every day (except Shabbat and Wednesdays), taught by a combination of Israeli and American staff. This formal education takes up two of the seven programming periods of the day. =Hebrew classes= Hebrew classes are mandatory for campers, excluding Machon and Nivonim, who have electives, and for those who participate in the Beit Midrash Program. They are arranged by level within each age division. Campers are tested at the start of the year. Classes are taught exclusively by members of the Mishlachat, Israelis who participate in an emissaries program run by the Jewish Agency. The teachers are usually young women who have recently completed their army/national service. They are not usually members of the Masorti movement, Israel‚Äôs Conservative Jewish community. =Jewish studies classes= Jewish study classes are mandatory for all campers excluding Machon and Nivonim, who have electives, and for those younger campers who do not participate in the Beit Midrash Program. These classes are not arranged by level, and often based on a theme or concept (Shabbat, Tzedakah), rather than a text. They are often taught by rabbinical school students, or occasionally by Jewish day school teachers. =Beit Midrash= The Beit Midrash program offers campers in Bogrim and Machon a double period of study in place of Hebrew and Text, and offers Shoafim campers one period of study instead of their regular Jewish studies class. It is taught by Orthodox and some Conservative educators whose background is in Talmud and other Rabbinic texts. The Beit Midrash also includes a program called \\"the Northwoods Kollel\\", which unlike the traditional Orthodox model, is co- educational, and composed of between four and six college-age students who have usually not participated in the Ramah camping movement. Participants spend the day immersed in Talmud study. Classes focus on skill-building by reading a specific Rabbinic text, usually a perek of the Babylonian Talmud. =Hebrew outside the classroom= Ramah is known as a Hebrew-speaking camp, which it was at its inception. Hebrew exams before camp were once required to gain enrollment. Near total immersion was once one of the effective techniques used by Ramah Wisconsin, with Hebrew being required to get food in the dining room, supplies in art and so on. After the 1970s, serious efforts in using Hebrew outside the classroom became limited. Currently, Hebrew is still publicly used in announcements in the dining room and campwide events, musicals, and the refereeing of softball games. Although it is unclear if campers comprehend the Hebrew used in those contexts, campers rapidly learn the Hebrew needed in order to get snack at the canteen, or \\"chanutiya.\\" Some buildings are referred to by Hebrew names, but most camp activities and locations are referred to in a camp slang that is a mix of Hebrew and English, for example, ‚ÄúMeltzing‚Äù for waiting tables (from the Hebrew ◊û◊ú◊¶◊® for \\"waiter\\"). eidot names are still in Hebrew. =Library= The Blanche Lippitz Library at the camp was established by the Sisterhoods of Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Michigan a tribute to the services rendered by Lippitz.  Activities  =Tarbut (◊™◊®◊ë◊ï◊™)= Camp Ramah In Wisconsin offers a number of activities for the campers. The main \\"Tarbut\\" (Hebrew for \\"culture\\") activities include: *Omanut (◊ê◊ï◊û◊†◊ï◊™) (includes pottery, copper enameling, batik, illustration, painting, and tie-dye) *Nagarut (◊†◊í◊®◊ï◊™) (woodworking) *Radio (◊®◊ì◊ô◊ï) (FM radio) *Music (◊û◊ï◊°◊ô◊ß◊î) *Rikud (◊®◊ô◊ß◊ï◊ì) (dance) *Drama (◊ì◊®◊û◊î) *Cooking (◊û◊ò◊ë◊ó◊ï◊ü) =Sports (◊°◊§◊ï◊®◊ò)= Each day, excluding Wednesdays and Saturdays, has sport periods for campers. They can choose from basketball, volleyball, aerobics, softball, tennis, kayaking, and sailing. In recent years, lacrosse, ultimate frisbee, soccer and field hockey have been offered. Martial arts or self-defense are occasionally offered. In addition, the camp has a beach volleyball area, and while gaga is not offered as an activity choice, it is played regularly. Sports programs are recreational and competitive in nature, and do not focus on kinesthetic skill development. The most popular two sports are basketball and softball, because of the inter- eidah (age division) games in these two sports. The 2002 Nivonim Boys have the most successful record in inter-eidah competitions at 13-3. The Camp Ramah shores of Upper Lake Buckatabon. The waterfront has a sand beach and three docks with a \\"blob,\\" or floating trampoline: and a \\"bloob\\", a water obstacle course. Swimming Every age division has a perek (time period) devoted swim class once a day. At the beginning of the summer, campers are tested and placed into an American Red Cross swimming class based on their skill level. Campers in the Machon age division are offered a chance to enroll in a lifeguarding course that offers American Red Cross certification for those who successfully complete the course. Facilities =Ohel Yitzchak= While all other prayer areas are part of multi-purpose rooms, each eidah spends time praying in Ohel Yitzchak, the only permanent synagogue on the campus. Named in memory of Rabbi Isaac Bonder, the synagogue has large windows that look out into the forest, and tent-like architecture. The parochet, or ark curtain, was created by Annabelle Argand, features a tree that has just begun to bloom, reflecting the life cut short of Rabbi Bonder. The path leading to the synagogue is also incomplete. The ner tamid is a crown that is actually a ring of people holding hands and created by Israeli artist Gedaliah ben Tzvi, and the Sheviti is a paper cut by Roger Coleson, a former camp teacher who also died at an early age. =Chadar Ochel= Ramah Wisconsin‚Äôs three dining rooms serve over 2,100 meals a day when camp is in full swing. The dining rooms are also used for various activities and events. A new facility with a renovated kitchen and three brand-new dining halls opened in June 2009.  Annual events  = Zimriah (Song Festival) = Early in the summer the Zimriah (song festival) takes place. Every eidah learns a song that follows a theme for the summer, with the majority of the songs coming from Israeli songwriters. Every eidah wears a color for that evening, giving the appearance of a color war. Solelim wears purple, Shoafim wears red, Bogrim wears blue, Machon and Tikvah wear red, and the younger eidot wear yellow, green, and orange. (While the oldest age division wears black, pre-2000 Zimriot saw Nivonim wearing tie-dye shirts, plaid, or even white.) After all eidot have sung their songs, each eidah stands up again and sings their own eidah song. Traditionally, the older eidot join in with the songs for the younger eidot. After all songs have been sung, the entire camp stands up and sings the Himnon Ramah, the camp song, which is traditionally sung after all camp-wide gatherings. = Rikudiah (Dance Festival) = Now held near the end of the summer, the Rikudiah was originally held on the tennis courts as a part of the visitors' weekend festivities. While the Rikudiah is open to all campers, only the youngest eidot dance as a whole eidah. Older eidot are usually represented by those who take dance as a tarbut (cultural) activity. In addition, the Mishlachat (Israeli staff), the educational staff, the European staff and the administrative staff each perform a dance. When all the presentations are complete, the whole camp dances together, with each eidah called to bed until only Nivonim and staff remain. The focus of the Rikudiah originally emphasized Israeli folk dance and dances to classic songs from Israel and Jewish traditional life. These aspects are no longer a part of the Wisconsin Rikudiah. The most predominant style of dance seen is a variation on urban/hip-hop dance, with the occasional modern or jazz dance piece. =Tisha B'Av= The fast day of Tisha B'Av is the only Jewish holiday that falls during the summer. Camp begins commemoration of the day with ma‚Äôariv in the dining halls after a seudah mafseket (a meal to prepare for a fast). Nivonimers form paths of paper lanterns from dining hall to bet am, and the entire camp walks through the candle-lit paths to a communal reading of Aicah (the Book of Lamentations). Following the reading, campers fast and participate in discussions, role-playing simulations and other special activities until the breaking of the fast the following night (pre-bnai- mitzvah campers do not normally fast). = Yom Sport = Every year there is a Yom Sport, or \\"Sport Day\\". This day is similar to the traditional \\"color wars\\" found at other summer camps around the world. Campers are divided into four teams, traditionally having Red, Yellow, Blue, and Green. Campers from Nivonim are team captains, four for each team. Other Nivonim campers are part of the black team, or \\"Team Uber,\\" or vice-administrators. Each team within each eidah compete with the other teams in the eidah throughout the event. Throughout the day, campers are required to cheer in Hebrew, and often take up Israeli sports teams (Beitar, Hapoel, etc.) The day currently ends with a giant, camp-wide relay race called \\"The Apache,\\" adaptation of the Jicarilla Apache religious ritual \\"The Jicarilla Apache Ceremonial Relay Race\\", by Morris Edward Opler, American Anthropologist, p. 75 brought to Ramah Wisconsin from \\"Indian\\" camps (ostensibly teaching some form of Native American values). This adaptation of Native American practices, one of the few at Ramah lacking either a Hebrew name or a Jewish cultural reference, replaced the original end of day event, the camp wide tug-of-war. The events that make up the Apache change every year. Elements include both the whimsical, such as of a mummy wrap, tent building, and car washing, as well as physically more demanding events such as long distance swimming and running. The conclusion of the Apache is a fire building contest, where the victors are the first to snap a string suspended above their fire pit. =No smoking= No Smoking is the close-of-summer program that combines award ceremonies, encores of musical numbers from eidah musicals, and a multi-sectioned slide show on the last night of camp. No Smoking was originally a joke-filled roast of camp figures created in the late 1950s. Campers were responsible for their own program, and the musical interlude was a nonsensical jingle based on the doo-wop hit \\"Sha- boom,\\" inspired by the songs in the dining room. As the camp grew and campers became more sensitive, the jokes and roasting elements were banned.Rabbi Gerry Rosenberg, Visitor's Day Interview, 1983. = Musicals = Each eidah from Sollelim through Nivonim puts on a Broadway musical entirely in Hebrew. Certain plays are relegated to different eidot, such as \\"The Little Mermaid\\" and \\"Peter Pan\\" given to younger eidot such as Sollelim and Shoafim, because of their simplicity. More complex plays like \\"Mamma Mia\\", \\"Les Miserables\\" and \\"Hairspray\\" are usually reserved for Bogrim, Machon, and Nivonim because of complex and more mature subject matter. Jonathan Adam Ross, Jewish theatre artist, who has performed his first solo show, ‚ÄúWalking in Memphis: The Life of a Southern Jew,‚Äù Off-Broadway is also a founding company member of the Northwoods Ramah Theatre and Storahtelling, and traces his acting roots to his longtime association with Camp Ramah in Wisconsin, where he serves as long- standing director of the performing arts. Dressed head to toe in bird fabrics and hopping on one leg, Mr. Ross debuted Bernard Melamud's, \\"The JewBird\\" first to audiences in Conover.

He is also the rhythm guitarist in Wolfen Society. His name is derived from Ahriman (), the evil equivalent of the deity Angra Mainyu in Zoroastrianism.  Biography  Originally from Lule√• a small town in the north of Sweden, Ahriman developed an interest in music from a very young age. Hailing from a somewhat musical family, he cited his grandmother, mother and younger sister as influences and he started songwriting himself between 1989 and 1990.Interview with Lord Ahriman Harbouring interests for Satanism (ostensibly that of the LaVeyan variant) and extreme metal as a teenager, he was introverted in his environment. When he was eighteen years old, he left for Stockholm, home to extreme metal acts such as Entombed and Dismember, whom Ahriman already knew personally. He has also been an active participant in death metal. Before he played in Dark Funeral he played in a blackened death metal band called Satan's Disciples, and he has a side-project called Wolfen Society, who released an MCD \\"Conquer Divine\\" in 2001, although difficulties with No Fashion Records hindered its success. Ahriman and other Dark Funeral members were forced to have side-jobs after No Fashion did not grant them royalties for their work on Dark Funeral's backcatalogue. Consequently Dark Funeral filed suit against No Fashion, and have since spearheaded a campaign against \\"corrupt\\" record labels. In October 2008, it was announced that Ahriman and Emperor Magus Caligula succeeded in obtaining the rights to Dark Funeral's entire backcatalogue. In 2013 Lord Ahriman & Dark Funeral signed to Century Media Records for their upcoming new studio album.
