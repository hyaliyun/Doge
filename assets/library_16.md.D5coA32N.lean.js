The club had its roots in the informal Fine Arts Club, a gathering of amateur art enthusiasts, founded by John Charles Robinson, that met in Marlborough House in 1856, moving to South Kensington from 1857. In 1866 they formalised the new club, although informal meetings under the Fine Arts Club banner continued to be held separately until 1874, using the Burlington as its base. The original Burlington clubhouse occupied the upper three floors of 177 Piccadilly from 1866 until 1869, when the club moved to its Savile Row premises, where it remained for the rest of its existence. The club aimed to evoke the atmosphere of a typical gentlemen's club for those interested in art, as well as to provide a showcase for amateur artists. Part of the clubhouse doubled as a regular exhibition venue, the location having been selected for its proximity to Mayfair art dealers. Notable members included James McNeill Whistler, John Ruskin, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Michael Rossetti, and Edwin Lutyens. The Second World War proved a terrible strain on the Burlington, its last exhibition having been held just prior to the outbreak of war in 1939. With dwindling membership numbers after the war, the club's committee realised that it could no longer afford the lease on its clubhouse. An attempt was made to raise the funds to move to 34 Great Cumberland Place, but this failed. In late 1951, the committee voted for the club to go into liquidation, with effect the following year. The club's assets were valued at some ¬£14,500. With most of the members waiving their rights to shares in the club, ¬£13,070, 12s, 5d went to the National Art-Collections Fund (later The Art Fund) in commemoration of the Burlington Fine Arts Club.

India was the first country outside the Eastern Bloc to establish diplomatic relations with Mongolia. Since then, there have been treaties of mutual friendship and cooperation between the two countries in 1973, 1994, 2001 and 2004. Mongolia supports India's candidature as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council while India supported the inclusion of Mongolia as a full member of the Non-Aligned Movement. According to a 2010 Gallup poll, 26% of Mongolians approve of Indian leadership, with 9% disapproving and 66% uncertain.U.S. Leadership More Popular in Asia Than China's, India's Gallup In December 2016, Mongolia asked for financial help from India after the country's border with China was blocked. Following Indian External affairs minister Sushma Swaraj's historic visit to Mongolia in April 2018, India & Mongolia decided to establish an air-corridor to boost bilateral trade. It is also expected that construction of Mongolia's first ever oil refinery will commence in 2018 with technical & financial assistance from India.  Historical relations  There has been historical interaction between India and Mongolia for over 2,700 years.Indo-Mongolian relations, Pg 7 =Delhi Sultanate= During the Delhi Sultanate, the Turco-Mongol conqueror in Central Asia, Timur (Tamerlane), attacked the reigning Sultan Nasir-u Din Mehmud of the Tughlaq Dynasty in the north Indian city of Delhi.Timur - conquest of India The Sultan's army was defeated on 17 December 1398. Timur entered Delhi and the city was sacked, destroyed, and left in ruins, after Timur's army had killed and plundered for three days and nights. He ordered the whole city to be sacked except for the sayyids, scholars, and the other Muslims; 100,000 war prisoners were put to death in one day. =Mughal Empire= In 1526, Babur, a Timurid descendant of Timur and Genghis Khan from Fergana Valley (modern day Uzbekistan), swept across the Khyber Pass and established the Mughal Empire, covering modern day Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh.The Islamic World to 1600: Rise of the Great Islamic Empires (The Mughal Empire) However, his son Humayun was defeated by the Afghan warrior Sher Shah Suri in the year 1540, and Humayun was forced to retreat to Kabul. After Sher Shah's death, his son Islam Shah Suri and the Hindu king Hemu, who had won 22 battles against Afghan rebels and forces of Akbar, from Punjab to Bengal and had established a secular Muslim rule in North India from Delhi till 1556. Akbar's forces defeated and killed Hemu in the Second Battle of Panipat on 6 November 1556. The Mughal dynasty ruled most of the Indian subcontinent by 1600; it went into a slow decline after 1707. The Mughals suffered a severe blow due to invasions from Marathas and Afghans due to which the Mughal dynasty were reduced to puppet rulers by 1757. The remnants of the Mughal dynasty were finally defeated and taken over by the British during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, also called the 1857 War of Independence. As the British took over the remnants of the Mughal Empire, the dynasty was ended. The Mughals were perhaps the richest single dynasty to have ever existed. During the Mughal era, the dominant political forces consisted of the Mughal Empire and its tributaries and, later on, the rising successor states - including the Maratha Empire - which fought an increasingly weak Mughal dynasty. The Mughals, while often employing brutal tactics to subjugate their empire, had a policy of integration with Indian culture, which is what made them successful where the short-lived Sultanates of Delhi had failed. Akbar the Great was particularly famed for this. Akbar declared \\"Amari\\" or non-killing of animals in the holy days of Jainism. He rolled back the jizya tax for non-Muslims. The Mughal emperors married local royalty, allied themselves with local maharajas, and attempted to fuse their Turko-Persian culture with ancient Indian styles, creating a unique Indo-Saracenic architecture. It was the erosion of this tradition coupled with increased brutality and centralization that played a large part in the dynasty's downfall after Aurangzeb, who unlike previous emperors, imposed relatively non-pluralistic policies on the general population, which often inflamed the majority Hindu population. =Cultural exchanges= Buddhism Buddhism was carried to Mongolia by Indian missionaries during the early Christian era. As a result, today, Buddhists form the single largest religious denomination in Mongolia. Buddhists entered the service of Mongol Empire in the early 13th century. Buddhist monasteries established in Karakorum were granted tax exempt status, though the religion was not given official status by the Mongols until later. All variants of Buddhism, such as Chinese, Tibetan and Indian Buddhism flourished, though Tibetan Buddhism was eventually favored at the imperial level under emperor M√∂ngke, who appointed Namo from Kashmir as chief of all Buddhist monks. Ogedei's son and Guyuk's younger brother, Khoten, became the governor of Ningxia and Gansu. He launched a military campaign into Tibet under the command of Generals Lichi and Dhordha, and the marauding Mongols burned down Tibetan monuments such as the Reting monastery and the Gyal temple in 1240. Prince K√∂t√∂n was convinced that no power in the world exceeded the might of the Mongols. However, he also believed that religion was necessary in the interests of the next life. Thus he invited Sakya Pandita to his ordo. Prince K√∂t√∂n was impressed and healed by Sakya Pandita's teachings and knowledge, and later became the first known Buddhist prince of Mongol empire. Kublai Khan, the founder of Yuan Dynasty, also favored Buddhism. As early as the 1240s, he made contacts with a Chan Buddhist monk Haiyun, who became his Buddhist adviser. Kublai's second son, whom he later officially designated as his successor in the Yuan Dynasty, was given a Chinese name \\"Zhenjin\\" (literally, \\"True Gold\\") by Haiyun. Khatun Chabi influenced Kublai to be converted to Buddhism, as she had received the H√©vajra tantra initiations from Phagspa and been impressed. Kublai appointed Phagspa his state preceptor, and later imperial preceptor, giving him power over all the Buddhist monks within the territory of the Yuan Dynasty. For the rest of the Yuan Dynasty in Mongolia and China, until the Mongols were overthrown in 1368, Tibetan lamas were the most influential Buddhist clergy. Via the Tibetan clergy, Indian Buddhist textual tradition strongly influenced the religious life in the Empire. Some of the Ilkhans in Iran held Paghmo gru-pa order as their appanage in Tibet and lavishly patronized a variety of Indian, Tibetan and Chinese Buddhist monks. But in 1295, Ghazan persecuted Buddhists and destroyed their temples. Before his conversion to Islam though, he had built a Buddhist temple in Khorasan. The 14th century Buddhist scriptures found at archaeological sites related to Chagatai Khanate show the popularity of Buddhism among the Mongols and the Uighurs. Tokhta of Golden Horde also encouraged lamas to settle in Russia, but his policy was halted by his Muslim successor Ozbeg Khan.  Modern times  India established formal diplomatic relations with Mongolia on December 24, 1955 thereby becoming the first country outside the Soviet bloc to establish diplomatic relations with the country. Since then, there have been numerous diplomatic visits and interactions between the two countries. India sponsored Mongolia's candidacy for membership of the United Nations in 1961 despite opposition from Taiwan and China and in 1973, Mongolia reciprocated to the Indian gesture by becoming the second country after Bhutan to recognise Bangladesh as an independent country following the liberation of Bangladesh by Indian troops. = Joint Declaration of 1973 = A path-breaking Indo- Mongolian joint declaration was signed in February 1973 during the Indian visit of the Mongolian Prime Minister Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal. = Treaty of Friendly Relations and Cooperation (1994) = A treaty of friendly relations and cooperation was signed in February 1994 during the visit of the then Mongolian president Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat, to India.

They also resolved to work closely to ensure security and curbing international crimes and terrorism. = 2001-present = In January 2001, the Mongolian president Natsagiin Bagabandi visited India.Indo-Mongolian relations, Pg 8 During this visit, a Joint Declaration was issued and a series of six major agreements were signed in order to promote cooperation in the fields of Information Technology, Investment Promotion and Protection and mutual legal assistance in civil, criminal and commercial matters. Mongolia conveyed its support to India's bid to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and also indicated its support for India's peace efforts with Pakistan. The Mongolian prime Minister Nambaryn Enkhbayar visited India in January 2004. During this visit, three agreements were signed in order to promote mutual cooperation in the fields of Animal Health and Dairy, Space Science and biotechnology.

AAOmega radial velocities rule out current membership of the planetary nebula NGC 2438 in the open cluster M46, MNRAS Partly because of their small total mass, open clusters have relatively poor gravitational cohesion. Consequently, open clusters tend to disperse after a relatively short time, typically some 10 million years, because of external gravitational influences amid other factors. Under exceptional conditions, open clusters can remain intact for up to 100 million years. Theoretical models predict that planetary nebulae can form from main- sequence stars of between 8 and 1 solar masses, which puts their age at 40 million years and older. Although there are a few hundred known open clusters within that age range, a variety of reasons limit the chances of finding a member of an open cluster in a planetary nebula phase. One such reason is that the planetary nebula phase for more massive stars belonging to younger clusters is on the order of thousands of years - a blink of the eye in cosmic terms.

Typically, UK funky blends beats, bass loops and synths with African and Latin percussion in the dem bow rhythm and contemporary R&B-style; vocals. Characteristics UK funky uses tempos of around 130bpm. Drum patterns vary between tracks, using either \\"4 to the floor\\" or a syncopated style. The drum patterns commonly also include percussion playing African inspired rhythms. Instrumentation varies widely, but drum machines and synthesizers are common. There are similarities to garage in rhythmic, musical and vocal styles. UK funky is highly influenced by the tribal, soulful and bassline house subgenres. Similar genres include Afrobeats, broken beat, electro and garage. History US house producers such as Masters At Work, Karizma (with \\"Twyst This\\"), Quentin Harris and Dennis Ferrer (with a remix of Fish Go Deep's \\"The Cure and the Cause\\"; and with \\"Hey Hey\\") have had an influence on UK funky. Hits from this genre include the Crazy Cousinz songs \\"Do You Mind?\\", \\"Bongo Jam\\" and \\"The Funky Anthem\\", and Fuzzy Logik featuring Egypt's \\"In The Morning\\". Popular songs have also produced dance crazes, such as \\"Heads Shoulders Knees and Toes\\", \\"The Tribal Man Skank\\" and \\"The Migraine Skank\\". Other notable artists include Apple, Marcus Nasty, Tribal Magz, Donae'o, KIG, Roska, Champion, Ill Blu, Lil' Silva and Funkystepz. DJs and MCs that have played a role in UK funky include DJ Pioneer, Supa D, MA1, Cameo, NG, MC Kaos Spidey G, Coldstepz, and Dogtaniaun & Versatile. Funky Dee's \\"Are You Gonna Bang Doe?\\", recorded in 2009, achieved mainstream success and was signed to Universal Music Group. It was interpolated by Ed Sheeran in his viral 2010 freestyle alongside Example, the \\"Nando's Skank\\", and was later interpolated by Sun Bingo for their 2018 \\"Are You Gonna Bingo?\\" advertising campaign. The track was described by Tim Westwood as \\"the summer soundtrack\\" which \\"replaced [Boy Better Know's] \\"Too Many Man\\" in the clubs\\" and by TRENCH Magazine as an \\"Ayia Napa anthem\\". Critics included Vice's Sam Diss, who considered it to be one of several tracks \\"that practically confirmed [UK funky] would soon become the novelty soundtrack to every bad freshers week in the country, eventually leading to its demise\\", and Marcus Nasty, who claimed it contributed to the genre becoming \\"kiddies' music\\". Popular singer Katy B duetted with Ms. Dynamite on a track called \\"Lights On\\". It reached number four in the UK Singles Chart and was the first UK funky track to chart in the UK.

Ephraimits, inferior in fineness, dominated the economy of Duchy of Saxony and the Kingdom of Prussia from 1756 till 1763 during the Seven Years' War. They were spread by merchants and soldiers in Silesia, Bohemia, Poland and Courland and traded at the value of coins with the pre-war precious metal content. In return they would receive higher value foreign coins, which were used to pay the import of army supply. By the end of 1762 Fredrick the Great left his policy. After the war the Ephraimiten were withdrawn from circulation. Financing the cost of war Frederic the Great used Ephraimites to finance the Seven Years' War. He debased the currency five times. By producing and issuing such coins of low value the royal treasure could make a considerable profit. This was mainly the task of the banker and court Jew Veitel-Heine Ephraim (1703‚Äì1775) who produced these \\"fake coins\\" named after him, \\"Ephraimiten\\". \\"In Leipzig the entrepreneurs Ephraim, Itzig and company produced vast masses of low-valued money, in Tympfs, six-, three- and most often in eight groschen pieces. At first they used Saxon stamps found in 1753 and later on newly produced indentors of the Saxon type.\\"Emil Bahrfeldt: Brandenburgisch-preu√üische M√ºnzstudien\\"; Berlin: Verlag der Berliner M√ºnzbl√§tter, 1913 (Reprint: Transpress 1986). The financial gain was that the content of gold and silver was significantly lower than legally ordered, and large amounts of silver were replaced by inferior copper, for example. However, the coins were initially put into circulation with their full value and accordingly yielded large profits. The older but original coin stamps which were mainly used came from other countries, preferably from Saxony. These Saxon coin stamps mainly dated back before 1756 and could be confiscated in the Duchy of Saxony which was under Prussian occupation at that time. Ordinary citizens could not identify the inferior value of the coin at first sight, as coin stamps were in use that had produced full-value coins before the war. Citizens initially accepted the \\"Ephraimiten\\" still according to the (pre-war) face value just to find out at the next occasion that the better informed merchants and, shortly after that, also the other tradesmen, artisans and innkeepers would not accept this money at its full face value (=old price of goods and services) any more. From 1757, however, even Prussian 1/6 thaler coins were significantly reduced in fineness by Prussia without official announcement. There are Prussian full copper counterfeits of the 1/6 thaler piece from this time which were silver-coated only on the outside. This leads to the possible assumption that in the chaos of war there were also private counterfeiters at work. The Saxon-Polish eight groschen coin, the Polish 18 groschen coin (Tympf) and the golden five thaler piece, also called August d'or, or, in German \\"goldener August\\", were reduced in fineness frequently. See also Friedrich d'or. These coins were copied in Prussia or at the mint in Leipzig, respectively. Afterwards they were reimported to Saxony as \\"trade coins\\" by the military. The coins were still negotiable in Prussia with reduced value until 1820. By law this was published in so called \\"Valvationstabellen\\" (=tables on coin value) and at the same time they were called in for definite change and elimination. Examples for the \\"real value\\" of two pieces of five thaler coins (August d'or) from 1758 and the Tympf according to a Prussian value table from 1820: * Two \\"middle August d'or\\" (nominal 10 talers) = six thalers, 21 groschen, six groschen (Prussian Courant), i.e. there was a difference of at least one and a half thalers to the nominal value per five thaler coin * One eight groschen coin = three groschen (Prussian courant), i.e. a difference of five groschen (however, the Saxonian grosch was slightly higher in value than the Prussian) The fake five thaler coins differed from the real ones in their size and colour: they were thicker and had a reddish colour. As the weight had to be correct in the era of coinbalances and copper has a more than 50% lower specific weight, this led to the unusual thickness of the coins to reach the \\"mandatory\\" weight. The fraud was not as easy to identify by thickness in the case of the silver coins, since the specific weight of copper is only 15% lower than that of silver. The \\"Ephraimiten\\" with fine metal content can be at best called a value-reduced currency coin, because they were not accepted at their full nominal value as were the billion coins (\\"Scheidem√ºnzen\\" - literally: sheath money). Fraud unmasked and resulting devaluation (...) Coins reduced in fineness can easily be tested for their fineness. (...) The real value of the \\"Ephraimiten\\" could be hence be detected by the gross weight. The fraud thus worked for only three years. Through the low number of experts who were qualified enough the fraud could last longer in rural than in urban areas. A contemporary saying about the coins went like this: By 1762 many Ephraimiten were melted around Amsterdam, and Hamburg. The silver or gold was sent back and reused to produce more Ephraimiten, foreign fake coins, later coins at pre-war standard. Imitations After that several smaller treasurers produced their own coins with less value, too. This was very obvious in the case of the Groschen and half-Groschen coins. These often were silvered on the outside only, e.g.- the coins of the Anhaltian principalities.

The technology allows the user to take a tour of a city or pre-defined area, with geo-located, pre-recorded audio travel information triggering automatically as the user approaches them. The Tourism Radio in-car device plugs into a standard vehicle cigarette lighter and broadcasts a selection of local and international music along with location-specific travel information about the area the vehicle is driving through. Currently, there are approximately 3,300 of these devices used in South Africa, Namibia, New Zealand and Angola. Distribution of the devices to tourists is done in partnership with local Destination Marketing Organisations (DMOs) and car/motorhome rental agencies. The iOS and Android applications do not broadcast a selection of music, but use the same geo-location principle to give the user relevant travel information about the area they are in. This includes information about a general area or suburb, as well as information about specific points of interest, such as museums, art galleries, historical attractions, restaurants, nature walks, beaches, etc.  About  Started in Cape Town, South Africa in 2005 by founder and current CEO, Mark Allewell, Tourism Radio was originally created on the concept of touring a city without a tour guide. Allewell used his home town of Cape Town as his starting point, and worked on the development of a GPS device which would play information on points of interest as the user approached them. Months of research and development led to the creation of a bespoke, in-car device. This could play through an ordinary car radio sound system and would play audio information about important sights as they were passed by the vehicle. After a positive local and international response, the company was bought by a German angel investor and expanded operations to Spain and New Zealand. Tourism Radio has since focused on becoming a key player in the digital world by creating mobile apps, with a keen focus on free-to-download audio city guides, for iOS and Android devices. These apps served as a proving ground for Tourism Radio, and led to the development of white label apps for DMOs and corporate entities looking to target the tourism industry. These use Tourism Radio‚Äôs technology and are coupled with client-provided content to create company-specific apps.  Technology  Tourism Radio offers the use of its location-based technology in form of the in-car Tourism Radio devices and its iOS and Android applications. The company has patented its real-world and mobile geo-location technology in New Zealand and Europe, with patents pending in North America and elsewhere. Tourism Radio also features as application software on the Renault R-Link in-car multimedia system. Tourism Radio uses the R-Link's inbuilt GPS system to provide drivers with information about tourist attractions in their vicinity. The Tourism Radio mobile applications for Android and iOS allow the user to download a travel guide and then use it completely offline.

History Beginning in 1704 the Society of Jesus bought a farm and initiated missionary activities on the site, thereby establishing a second mission in Maryland half a century after the foundation of the Newtown Manor mission in St. Mary's County, Maryland. A school here taught many distinguished early American Catholic leaders, including future archbishop John Carroll and his cousin, founding father Charles Carroll. Priests assigned to this mission evangelized in the Delmarva Peninsula, including the modern Archdiocese of Philadelphia and Diocese of Wilmington. Perhaps the most famous grave in the graveyard is of Catherine (\\"Kitty\\") Knight (1775-1855), credited for saving an elderly neighbor, a church and much of Georgetown, Maryland during the War of 1812, although her own house burned to the ground.Maryland Historical Magazine, vol. 3, p. 136, available at https://books.google.com/books?id=mfkMAAAAYAAJ&pg;=PA135&lpg;=PA135&dq;=catherine+knight+georgetown&source;=bl&ots;=AWivifXtD4&sig;=lWaJLiTYld1I0PGwrlTs_kN1FUs&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=lIa_U5_WO4GeyATX_IDwAQ&ved;=0CDsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q;=catherine%20knight%20georgetown&f;=false Structure The most historic properties on the site are a brick church, constructed shortly after the American Revolutionary War and dedicated in 1797, and an early-19th-century brick rectory connected by a one-story hyphen. The church consists of a four-bay-deep by three-bay-wide brick structure, with a 3-story brick tower added on the southwest facade of the church subsequent to its original building in 1792. The rectory is a five-bay-long, -story brick building with a two-bay-long hyphen on one end and a two-bay-long kitchen on the other. Also on the property is a public graveyard, as well as a relatively modern barn and farmhouse. A fire gutted the church's interior in 1912, but the church was rebuilt within the old walls. Regular services discontinued in the 1920s, but resumed in modern times. The Old Bohemia Historical Society, begun by a Catholic, a Quaker and a Methodist in 1954, bought the property's core 120 acres and now maintains the site.Arnett, Earl; Brugger, Robert J.; and Edward C.

He was the publisher of the Nashville Banner. He was opposed to desegregation. Early years James Geddes Stahlman was born on February 28, 1893 in Nashville, Tennessee. His paternal grandfather, Major Edward Bushrod Stahlman, a German-born railroad executive and the owner of the Nashville Banner, whose brother-in-law, Marcus Toney, was a Klansman and Masonic leader. Stahlman earned his bachelor's degree from Vanderbilt University in 1916, and attended graduate school at the University of Chicago for a year. He served as an infantry private in the United States Army during World War I. Career Stahlman began his career in journalism by working as a reporter for the Nashville Banner in 1912. He was the newspaper's co-owner with his uncle Frank Carl Stahlman from 1937 to 1955, when he became the sole owner. Stahlman wrote a column on the front page, From the Shoulder. Stahlman won the Maria Moors Cabot Prize in 1957. Stahlman sold the newspaper to the Gannett Company in 1972, and he donated $5 million to the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in 1972-1973. Desegregation Stahlman served on the Board of Trust of his alma mater, Vanderbilt University, from 1930 to 1976. In 1960, he used the newspaper to publish misleading stories about Civil Rights leader James Lawson, which suggested Lawson had incited others to \\"violate the law\\" and led to his expulsion from the Vanderbilt University Divinity School. The school was placed on probation for a year by the American Association of Theological Schools, and the power of trustees was curtailed. Stahlman was \\"strongly anti-integration\\". However, within a few years, \\"Stahlman was downplaying his racist rhetoric, boasting of hiring of a black reporter, and donating $250 to the families of black girls killed in a church bombing in Birmingham.\\" In 1967, Stahlman tried to keep Stokely Carmichael from speaking on the Vanderbilt campus; after Carmichael's speech on April 8, a racially charged riot broke out in North Nashville. Stahlman blamed Chancellor G. Alexander Heard for letting students invite Carmichael on campus. Personal life, death and legacy Stahlman was married three times. With his first wife, Mildred Porter Thornton, Stahlman had two daughters, Mildred and Ann. Stahlman married his second wife, Effye Chumley, in 1939; she died in 1952, and he married his third wife, Gladys Breckenridge, in 1953. Stahlman died on May 1, 1976 at the Vanderbilt University Hospital, after suffering a stroke at Rand Hall during a Vanderbilt Board of Trust meeting. One of his daughters, Mildred T. Stahlman, is a professor of pediatrics and pathology at Vanderbilt University. He is the namesake of the James G.

On June 22, 1834, this parish hosted the ordination as an Episcopal deacon by bishop William Murray Stone of William Douglass, a Methodist preacher who then became the second rector of the historic African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas in Philadelphia (after Absalom Jones), where the African American abolitionist was ordained as a priest and served until his death in 1862. The current church has a single- story rectangular stuccoed brick main block, three bays by three, resting on a partially excavated fieldstone foundation and covered by a steeply pitched slate roof. It features a 4-story bell tower with broach spire and patterned slate roof.

Jones also played cricket for Stockton Cricket Club and Sheffield United Cricket Club. Born in Rhuddlan, he represented Wales on 21 occasions. Career Jones began his career with Bootle, having grown up in the area. On moving to Stockton in 1890, Jones turned professional and also played cricket for Stockton Cricket Club during the summer months. When Stockton resumed amateur status in 1893, Jones moved to Grimsby Town, for whom he made his Football League debut in September 1893, remaining ever present for the remainder of the season. In May 1894, Jones transferred to Sheffield United, in part to play for the affiliated Sheffield United Cricket Club that summer. When the football season opened in September 1894, Jones made his footballing debut for the club against West Bromwich Albion and scored on each of his first two outings. Despite a promising start Jones was felt not to lack pace and spent much of his time playing in United's reserves, filling in for various positions on the first team when needed. After three seasons, Jones joined Tottenham Hotspur in May 1897, but as Spurs were not members of the Football League they did not have to pay a transfer fee to United, much to the annoyance of their directors. Playing principally in the outside left position for his new club, Jones became a mainstay of the first-team for seven seasons, becoming club captain and skippering the 1901 FA Cup Final winning side, ironically beating his former club, Sheffield United. Later life Club secretary of Sheffield United, Joseph Wostinholm, arranged for Jones to take up a summer coaching position with Rugby School shortly before he left the club, adding to his former employers annoyance at his departure. Jones continued to coach both cricket and football at the school whilst playing for Tottenham Hotspur. Following his retirement from playing football, Jones coached both games in Leinster, Ireland and later in South Africa. In 1923, Jones returned to England and became coach and groundsman at Whitburn Cricket Club in Durham.

These quasi bullion coins (in rarer cases small change) were thus actually export goods - that is, bullion in the form of coins, used to bulk buy important goods from other countries, where they could be bought at a favourable price, compared to the purchasing power of the same amount of bullion within the trade coins' country of origin. A distinction must be drawn between full value bullion trade coins, that were used in ordinary peacetime trade on the one hand, and on the other hand debased coins, that were usually made with the intention to deceive. Such debased \\"trade coins\\" were occasionally minted during times of war, e.g. the Prussian ephraimiten, silver-clad copper coins minted during the Seven Years' War. If these were ever accepted or approved as legal tender, they would be valued far below the regular coins, their value being calculated according to a specified formula. The conversion rates were even then usually significantly below the intrinsic value of the coins, to cover costs of melting and recoinage etc. Since the 1920s there have been hardly any true trade coins, though some are still traded by coin collectors with a premium. Their role has now been taken over by (paper or electronic) United States dollars as a world currency. Examples One of the most famous trade coins of the 18th century is the Austrian Maria Theresa thaler. Although dated 1780, it has been minted continuously in Austria well into the 21st century for sale to collectors. The Maria Theresa thaler was previously exported in large quantities to East Africa and the Middle East. It was so highly regarded in Africa that its purchasing power for goods and raw materials was higher there than in Austria. In preparation for the slow transition to the gold standard in England between 1717 and 1816, in trade with the Prussians England preferred 5 and 10 thaler gold pieces (Friedrich d'or) in exchange for quality goods. The Friedrich d'or thus became a trade coin, while it was also current in Prussia itself (although with a decreasing exchange rate against the silver Reichstaler, see bimetallism). The Hungarian and Dutch gold ducats, minted for centuries with a stable fineness, were esteemed trade coins. Other trade coins were the so- called silver Trade dollars used by Mexico and the USA to buy South American or Chinese goods relatively cheaply. These countries mostly had a currency based on the silver standard or even a paper currency, and domestically set the value of silver too high even though the world market price of silver had long been lower.

History West Wallabi Island was important in the story of the Batavia shipwreck and massacre. Following the shipwreck in 1629, a group of soldiers under the command of Wiebbe Hayes were put ashore there to search for water. A group of mutineers who took control of the other survivors left them there in the hope that they would starve or die of thirst. However the soldiers discovered that they could wade to East Wallabi Island, where there was a fresh water spring. Furthermore, West and East Wallabi Islands are the only islands in the group upon which the tammar wallaby lives. Thus the soldiers had access to sources of both food and water that were unavailable to the mutineers. Later the mutineers mounted a series of attacks, which the soldiers beat off. The Weibbe Hayes Stone Fort, remnants of improvised defensive walls and stone shelters built by Wiebbe Hayes and his men on West Wallabi Island, are Australia's oldest known European structures,Australian Broadcasting Company (2003).

Belconnen, ACT: Australian Surveying and Land Information Group. West Wallabi Island is the largest island in the Houtman Abrolhos, with an area of 6.21 km¬≤ (about 2.5 sq miles) which is more than a third of the total land area of the archipelago. It is located in the north-west of the Wallabi Group, the northernmost of three island groups in the Houtman Abrolhos. The island has three named points: Slaughter Point, Blowfish Point and Pelican Point. Between Blowfish Point and Pelican Point is a bay named Shag Bay, and south of Pelican Point is a bay named Horseyard Bay. The island is surrounded by submerged coral reef. This is narrow at Shag Bay, but fairly extensive along the rest of the coast. To the north-east, the reef is high enough for a person to wade from island to island: islands connected to West Wallabi Island in this way include Barge Rock, Turnstone Island, Seagull Island, Oystercatcher Island and East Wallabi Island. Geology and physiography The base of West Wallabi Island is the Wallabi Limestone, a dense calcretised coral limestone platform that underlies the entire Wallabi Group. This platform, which rises abruptly from a flat shelf, is about thick, and is of Quaternary origin. Reefs that formed during the Eemian interglacial (about 125,000 years ago) when sea levels were higher than at present, are now emergent in places, and constitute the basement of the group's central platform islands, which include West Wallabi Island. The basement is capped in some places by an aeolianite pavement, and this is in turn overlain in places by sand dunes. Flora As one of the few islands in the Houtman Abrolhos large enough to support dune systems, West Wallabi Island supports a relatively high diversity of plant life: according to a survey published in 2001, 97 plant species occur on the island. Both the dunes and the pavement limestone support species-rich vegetation complexes dominated by chenopod shrubs, and these communities have been identified as important for species conservation, because they are diverse, yet easily disturbed and slow to recover. Birds The island is part of the Houtman Abrolhos Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because it supports large numbers of breeding seabirds.

She now producers and performs as Jordana. She became known in the mid-1990s as an American Drum and Bass producer. The Village Voice described her as being \\"widely regarded as the top U.S. drum'n'bass producer.\\" Vibe magazine called her \\"one of the most respected Drum ‚Äòn' Bass producers in the US.\\" In 2015, Jordana was named as one of \\"20 women who shaped the history of dance music\\" by the authoritative dance music magazine Mixmag. In 2014, Harriet Magazine named Jordana as one of \\"12 women in black music history you should know\\". During the same year, Complex Magazine UK named one of her songs to a list of \\"36 great American drum & bass tracks\\". She is transgender and has been out since 1998. She has released of over 50 tracks, including four albums, several EPs, and many remixes under the alias 1.8.7. The album When Worlds Collide, released in 1997, became known for its \\"dark pummeling assaults\\". She has also licensed tracks for numerous compilations as well as the Sci Fi Channel. Three of her albums charted in the Top 25 of both the CMJ (College Music Journal) and Mixmag U.S. (later Mixer Magazine, now defunct) for 1997 as well as 1998 and 1999. Her third album \\"The Cities Collection\\" debuted in the CMJ Top 5 climbed to the #2 position on CMJ Music Monthly's dance chart for June 2000. Her works have been reviewed by the likes of Billboard, Spin, Rolling Stone, Urb, Mixer, Mixmag, Raygun, Vibe, and Trip (Espa√±ol), as well as Knowledge ‚Äì the U.K. Drum and Bass magazine. In 1999, she was listed in Raygun's Who's Who of International DJs. She was one of the headlining DJs on Knowledge Magazine's 28 city Kung Fu Knowledge tour in 1999. She also made Out Magazine's OUT100 list for the year 2000. Impact on music Jordana's work has influenced other artists such as a well-known dubstep producer Bassnectar, who heavily sampled 5 A.M. Rinse (feat. MC Sphinx), the last song on her first album When Worlds Collide for his song Here We Go of his 2010 EP and single Timestretch. Additionally, electronic rock act Celldweller sampled \\"Wake Up\\" off of her first album as well as \\"San Francisco\\" off of her third album \\"The Cities Collection\\" in their 2013 song \\"Uncrowned\\". In 1999, Drum & Bass/Hip Hop producer and label owner Hive approached Jordana to remix her song Defcon-1 also off of When Worlds Collide. Hive's remix appears on his 2001 album The Raw Uncut. Jordana collaborated with Lady Sovereign on a song early in Sov's career after the two met through an internet chat room for StrikeFM.co.uk, an online radio station which Jordana had a show, and the now defunct UKGarageWorldwide.com forums. The two would later team up when Jordana under her Lady J alias, had Lady Sovereign MC for her radio show on Flex FM London. New Zealand based Dubstep and Drum & Bass producer Alexis K/Unsub has also cited Jordana as an influence and the two are collaborating on music and a possible tour. History Jordana first came to the attention of the music industry when she was asked to remix Blondie's \\"Atomic.\\" Her Drum & Bass remix appeared along with Armand Van Helden and Diddy's remixes on the single. A little over a year following that release Mac McFarlane, the promoter of the well established and legendary New York city Drum'n'Bass club night, Konkrete Jungle, contacted Jordana to create a Konkrete Jungle themed song for a CD compilation/mix-CD. Jordana created the song \\"Konkrete Jungle\\" for that purpose. Described by CMJ as containing \\"menacing hardstep attacks\\", it was released on the Ultra Records compilation, Konkrete Jungle - Maximum Drum & Bass, mixed by BBC Radio 1 Drum'n'Bass show regular host Jumping Jack Frost. Following extensive touring throughout North America and abroad as a live Drum & Bass artist, Liquid Sky Music, an indie label distributed by Caroline Distribution signed her to a three-album contract in late 1996. Hate crime in Ohio On the night of February 22, 2000 in Kent, Ohio Jordana was attacked and brutally beaten in a transphobic hate crime by a group of men including Matthew Gostlin of Akron, Ohio. Gostlin and other assailants jumped her in the parking lot outside of the Robin Hood nightclub where she had just performed on the Cities Collection tour. The attack took place while she was escorted from the event with the event promoter to the promoters car. The group of men attacked suddenly and Jordana lost consciousness almost immediately after being struck in the face. She suffered nerve damage to the lower part of her face from her lower lip down as a result. She was quoted as saying in the May issue of CMJ New Music Monthly that in the seconds just prior to the attack: \\"I saw his face. I remember the look on his face. It was this look of utter hate, like 'I'm going to kill you.'\\" In an interview with the Village Voice following the attack, George Meesig, a fan from Cleveland, Ohio who defended Jordana during the attack, stated that Gostlin had misgendered her, saying ‚Äú[t]his is personal‚Äù. Other reports noted by the Village Voice on the message board for Breakbeat Science (a NYC based Drum'n'Bass record store) mentioned transphobic slurs being shouted during the attack. Jordana subsequently cancelled the tour to recover. Gostlin, while charged, was never arrested nor spent any time in court. Jordana's family was told by the Portage County (Ohio) prosecutor's office that attempts had been made to serve the warrant but Gostlin's whereabouts were unknown. As a result of no movement on the case by the authorities, Jordana felt that justice would not be served. She left the U.S. for England because of their concerns about personal safety and well- being. Additional work in music industry In addition to production, Jordana has also been a DJ, musician and singer. From 2001 to 2002, Jordana worked at Flex FM in London, England as Lady J with Lady Sovereign MCing for her during Jordana's radio show. In 2002, she held a club residency spinning UK Garage, 2-Step Garage and House Music at legendary club night Trinity in London's Vauxhall neighborhood. After returning to the US, Jordana has returned to her rock roots and fronts a melodic goth metal band in Seattle. Just prior to that, she was asked to play bass in another band briefly where she met and became close friends with singer/songwriter Shelita Burke. Currently, Jordana is scoring the documentary, Free CeCe, produced and directed by Jacqueline Gares and actress/director Laverne Cox of the series Orange Is The New Black. The documentary details the struggles of CeCe McDonald, an African-American transwoman who was wrongfully incarcerated for murder for defending herself against a hate driven attack on her life outside of a bar in Minneapolis. Jordana is working on a new Drum and Bass EP for Bristol, England-based Complex Records. Her guitar and vocal work have featured on clips of songs off of her new E.P. posted to Soundcloud and on cover songs she has posted on AfroPunk.com. Literary mentions Jordana has been featured in several books. Her success in rising from the depressed 80s economy of a \\"rust belt\\" city to MTV-featured electronica artist garnered a mention in the 2002 The New York Times bestseller \\"The Rise of the Creative Class\\" by economist Richard Florida. She appears in two books examining the history and rise of the American rave/EDM scene: Michaelangelo Matos's The Underground is Massive, which details an early online exchange between her and Moby dealing with the role of live performance in a rave context; and Rave Culture, an Insider's Overview by Jimi Fritz and Virginia Smallfry. Personal life An extensive interview with Jordana was also featured in the \\"New Transsexuals\\", a book published in 2012 by rock journalist and illustrator George Petros (Thrasher, Seconds, Propaganda, EXIT magazines). She currently resides in Seattle, Washington. Discography 1.8.7 has recorded numerous albums and songs, including When Worlds Collide, Konkrete Jungle and Free CeCe. In August 2020, Jordana shared a teaser EP from her new album called Resistencia. It is composed of music she made from 2014 to the present day. The release date has not been announced.

Ron Stone Productions in partnership with Curb Musifilms, produced the feature film \\"The Harvest\\".https://www.imdb.com/find?s=all&q;=The+Harvest&x;=0&y;=0 Stone founded and ran World Domination Records for 10 years in partnership with Dave Allen (Gang of Four and Apple/Beats). He also founded and ran Rock-it-comics for 5 years. Stone‚Äôs knowledge of the Internet and new technology led him to consult on digital and copyright issues to the RIAA. Stone leveraged his stature in the entertainment industry during the Internet boom to be a spokesman for the rights of artists whose intellectual property and content were being distributed freely via peer to peer applications like Napster. When commenting on how file sharing has devalued music, Stone commented: ‚ÄúMusic for a generation has become disposable and it used to be a collectible.‚Äù Not to mince words, Stone targeted Napster when he said ‚ÄúIt is the single most insidious website I‚Äôve ever seen‚Ä¶it‚Äôs like a burglar‚Äôs tool‚Äùhttp://riaa.com/newsitem.php?news_month_filter=&news;_year_filter=1999&resultpage;=&id;=6446F9E7-95A3-F900-5648-43B6CCEFC6EB RIAA News Room: Recording Industry Sues Napster for Copyright Infringement In a Los Angeles Times article on Net Music, Stone was asked to comment on what price consumers would be willing to pay for downloaded music: \\"Forty-nine cents seems like the appropriate amount,\\" said Ron Stone, president of Gold Mountain Entertainment, an artist management firm. \\"if you can get kids to spend 49 cents, consider it a gift. Make it 99 cents, you won't sell any, particularly if the singles market is a kids market.\\"https://articles.latimes.com/2002/jun/12/business/fi-universal12 Los Angeles Times Business Section: Net Music That's a Steal - but Not Stolen Stone continued to criticize his own industry as well as the Internet when he said ‚ÄúWere kind of stuck in this plantation system with the record companies. And they‚Äôre the only games in town. And we looked at the Internet as an opportunity to extricate ourselves from this situation and deal directly with our audience. And now it‚Äôs not an option because the option now is we can have the relatively bad contractual arrangement with one of the majors, or we could have our property taken for free. These are very bad choices.‚Äù With Stone's counsel, Napster was sued by the Recording Industry Association of America on behalf of record labels for enabling piracy on an 'unprecedented scale'. In an article in Forbes: The murky legal issue is whether Napster is materially contributing to infringing the copyrights, even if the company doesn't actually store the offending files. \\"Napster is driving the getaway car,\\" said Ronald Stone, a manager with Gold Mountain Entertainment in Los Angeles. Stone says he has found unauthorized copies of every single one of his artist's songs through Napster. With a group of other artists management and the RIAA, ran a series of television, radio and Web commercials urging the public to stop using the trendy program.https://www.forbes.com/2000/04/14/mu4.html Forbes: Metallica Sues Napster Stone worked as a consultant on digital and copyright issues to the RIAA.

The play was first performed on 8 September 1948 at the Phoenix Theatre, London, along with The Browning Version. Synopsis This is a one act play about a professional theatre company presenting Romeo and Juliet.Kenneth Branagh Theatre Company, London Harlequinade , branaghtheatre.com. Cited: 27 July 2015. The opening night is in the town of Brackley in the English Midlands. The principal characters are Arthur and his wife Edna (who play Romeo and Juliet) and the stage manager Jack. Arthur is horrified to be confronted by his grown up daughter (Muriel) and grandchild, neither of whose existences he had been aware of. To discover that he's a grandfather just before playing Romeo is too much for him. They later learn that he's still married to Muriel's mother (Flossie) and that he is bigamously married to Edna.

Background Water security is achieved when there is enough water for everyone in a region and the water supply is not at risk of disappearing. According to the Pacific Institute \\"While regional impacts will vary, global climate change will potentially alter agricultural productivity, freshwater availability and quality, access to vital minerals, coastal and island flooding, and more. Among the consequences of these impacts will be challenges to political relationships, realignment of energy markets and regional economies, and threats to security\\". It impacts regions, states and countries. Tensions exist between upstream and downstream users of water within individual jurisdictions. During history there has been much conflict over use of water from rivers such as the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers.http://www.stormingmedia.us/75/7593/A759324.html Retrieved 2009-01-19.

Water security is sometimes sought by implementing water desalination, pipelines between sources and users, water licences with different security levels and war. Water allocation between competing users is increasingly determined by application of market-based pricing for either water licenses or actual water.Patrick Webb and Maria Iskandarani, Water Insecurity and the Poor: Issues and Research Needs. http://www.zef.de/fileadmin/webfiles/downloads/zef_dp/zef_dp2-98.pdf, Center for Development Research, Discussion Papers on Development Policy No. 2, Bonn, October 1998. Fresh water Water, in absolute terms, is not in short supply planet-wide. But, according to the United Nations water organization, UN- Water, the total usable freshwater supply for ecosystems and humans is only about 200,000 km3 of water ‚Äì less than one percent (<1%) of all freshwater resources. Usable fresh water includes water not contaminated or degraded by water-altering chemicals, such as sewage or any other harmful chemicals from continuous previous use. In the 20th century, water use has been growing at more than twice the rate of the population increase. Specifically, water withdrawals are predicted to increase by 50 percent by 2025 in developing countries, and 18 per cent in developed countries. One continent, for example, Africa, has been predicted to have 75 to 250 million inhabitants lacking access to fresh water. By 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity, and two-thirds of the world population could be under stress conditions. By 2050, more than half of the world's population will live in water-stressed areas, and another billion may lack sufficient water, MIT researchers find.  Threats  The most common threat to water security is water scarcity. There can be several causes to water scarcity including low rainfall, climate change, high population density, and overallocation of a water source. An example of periodic water scarcity in the United States is droughts in California. Another category of threats to water security is environmental threats. These include contaminates such as biohazards (biological substances that can harm humans), climate change and natural disasters. Contaminants can enter a water source naturally through flooding. Contaminants can also be a problem if a population switches their water supply from surface water to groundwater. Natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and wildfires can damage man-made structures such as dams and fill waterways with debris. Other threats to water security include terrorism and radiation due to a nuclear accident. Research Thailand nan river fishing According to Nature (2010), about 80% of the world's population (5.6 billion in 2011) live in areas with threats to water security. The water security is a shared threat to human and nature and it is pandemic. Human water-management strategies can be detrimental to wildlife, such as migrating fish. Regions with intensive agriculture and dense populations, such as the US and Europe, have a high threat of water security. Water is increasingly being used as a weapon in conflict.Report: Water and Violence Link: http://strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/63948150123-web.pdf Water insecurity is always accompanied by one or more issues such as poverty, war and conflict, low women's development and environmental degradation. Researchers estimate that during 2010‚Äì2015, ca US$800 billion will be required to cover the annual global investment in water infrastructure. Good management of water resources can jointly manage biodiversity protection and human water security. Preserving flood plains rather than constructing flood-control reservoirs would provide a cost-effective way to control floods while protecting the biodiversity of wildlife that occupies such areas.Balancing water supply and wildlife Nature online 29 September 2010. Lawrence Smith, the president of the population institute, asserts that although an overwhelming majority of the planet's surface is composed of water, 97% of this water is constituted of saltwater; the fresh water used to sustain humans is only 3% of the total amount of water on Earth. Therefore, Smith believes that the competition for water in an overpopulated world would pose a major threat to human stability, even going so far as to postulate apocalyptic world wars being fought over the control of thinning ice sheets and nearly desiccated reservoirs. Nevertheless, 2 billion people have supposedly gained access to a safe water source since 1990 who may have earlier lacked it. The proportion of people in developing countries with access to safe water is calculated to have improved from 30 percent in 1970. to 71 percent in 1990, 79 percent in 2000 and 84 percent in 2004, parallel with rising population. This trend is projected to continue. The Earth has a limited though renewable supply of fresh water, stored in aquifers, surface waters and the atmosphere. Oceans are a good source of usable water, but the amount of energy needed to convert saline water to potable water is prohibitive with conventional approaches, explaining why only a very small fraction of the world's water supply is derived from desalination. However, modern technologies, such as the Seawater Greenhouse, use solar energy to desalinate seawater for agriculture and drinking uses in an extremely cost-effective manner. Most affected countries Communal tap (standpost) for drinking water in Soweto, Johannesburg, South Africa Based on the map published by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), the countries and regions suffering most water stress are North Africa, the Middle East,Jameel M.

Water scarcity is also increasing in South Asia.World Bank Climate Change Water: South Asia‚Äôs Lifeline at Risk, World Bank Washington D.C =Israel= The Israeli Holistic Approach to Water Security draws from 70 years of experience in national security and water management. Nations such as the US, UK, Spain, and others are collaborating with Israeli experts in water security standards. International competition dam's reservoir could reduce Nile flows by as much as 25% and devastate Egyptian farmlands. International competition over water can arise when one country starts drawing more water from a shared water source. This is often the most efficient route to getting needed water, but in the long term can cause conflict if water is overdrafted. More than 50 countries on five continents are said to be at risk of conflict over water. Turkey's Southeastern Anatolia Project (Guneydogu Anadolu Projesi, or GAP) on the Euphrates has potentially serious consequences for water supplies in Syria and Iraq. China is constructing dams on the Mekong, leaving Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Thailand without same amount of water as before investment. A huge project of reversing the flow of the Brahmaputra (Chinese: Tsangpo) river, which after leaving Chinese Tibet flows through India and Bangladesh. The struggle for water in some afflicted regions has led inhabitants to hiring guards in order to protect wells. Moreover, Amu Daria River, shared by Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Afghanistan, which has been nearly completely dried out, so much so that it has ceased to reach the Aral Sea/Lake, which is evaporating in an alarming pace. The fact that Turkmenistan retains much of the water before it flows into Uzbekistan. Conflict between Egypt and Ethiopia over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam escalated in 2020. Egypt sees the dam as an existential threat, fearing that the dam will reduce the amount of water it receives from the Nile. Intra- national competition =Australia= In Australia there is competition for the resources of the Darling River system between Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia. In Victoria, Australia a proposed pipeline from the Goulburn Valley to Melbourne has led to protests by farmers. In the Macquarie Marshes of NSW grazing and irrigation interests compete for water flowing to the marshes The Snowy Mountains Scheme diverted water from the Snowy River to the Murray River and the Murrumbidgee River for the benefit of irrigators and electricity generation through hydro-electric power. During recent years government has taken action to increase environmental flows to the Snowy in spite of severe drought in the Murray Darling Basin. The Australian Government has implemented buy-backs of water allocations, or properties with water allocations, to endeavour to increase environmental flows. =India= In India, there is competition for water resources of all inter state rivers except the main Brahmaputra river among the riparian states of India and also with neighbouring countries which are Nepal, China, Pakistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh, etc. Vast area of the Indian subcontinent is under tropical climate which is conducive for agriculture due to favourable warm and sunny conditions provided perennial water supply is available to cater to the high rate of evapotranspiration from the cultivated land. Though the overall water resources are adequate to meet all the requirements of the subcontinent, the water supply gaps due to temporal and spatial distribution of water resources among the states and countries in the subcontinent are to be bridged. There is intense competition for the water available in the inter state rivers such as Kavery, Krishna, Godavari, Vamsadhara, Mandovi, Ravi-Beas-Sutlez, Narmada, Tapti, Mahanadi, etc. among the riparian states of India in the absence of water augmentation from the water surplus rivers such as Brahmaputra, Himalayan tributaries of Ganga and west flowing coastal rivers of western ghats. All river basins face severe water shortage even for drinking needs of people, cattle and wild life during the intense summer season when the rainfall is negligible. Water security can be achieved along with energy security as it is going to consume electricity to link the surplus water areas with the water deficit areas by lift canals, pipe lines, etc. The total water resources going waste to the sea are nearly 1200 billion cubic meters after sparing moderate environmental / salt export water requirements of all rivers. Interlinking rivers of the subcontinent is possible to achieve water security in the Indian subcontinent with the active cooperation of the countries in the region.  United States domestic policy  The United States currently does not have a cohesive domestic water security policy.Tench, Rob. \\"Burch, John R., Jr.: Water Rights and the Environment in the United States: A Documentary and Reference Guide.\\" Library Journal, 15 Mar. 2016, p. 133+. Water security is projected to be a problem in the future since future population growth will most likely occur in areas that are currently water stressed. Ensuring that the United States remains water secure will require policies that will ensure fair distribution of existing water sources, protecting water sources from becoming depleted, maintaining good wastewater disposal, and maintaining existing water infrastructure. Currently there are no national limits for US groundwater or surface water withdrawal. If limits are imposed, the people most impacted will be the largest water withdrawers from a water source. In 2005, 31% of US water use was for irrigation, 49% was thermoelectric power, public supply 11%, public supply, industrial was 4%, aquaculture 2%, domestic 1%, and livestock less than 1%. The lack of current national water policy is effective in regions of the United States where there is a lot of water but not effective in regions of water scarcity. In the future, a national water security policy may have to be implemented to move water from regions that are water rich to regions that are water scarce. If new policies are implemented, the major stakeholders will be individual states (both water rich and water poor states), farmers, power companies, and other industries that use a substantial amount of water (such as mining and oil and gas). = Water utility security = According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), \\"Improving the security of our nation's drinking water and wastewater infrastructures has become a top priority since the events of 9/11. Significant actions are underway to assess and reduce vulnerabilities to potential terrorist attacks; to plan for and practice response to emergencies and incidents; and to develop new security technologies to detect and monitor contaminants and prevent security breaches.\\" One of the most important elements of water security is early and accurate contamination detection. The EPA has issued advisory material and guidelines for contamination warning systems to be implemented in water utilities and supplies. The security challenges that utilities frequently revolve around fast detection, accuracy, and the ability to take fast action when there is a water problem. If contamination is detected early enough, it can be prevented from reaching consumers, and emergency water supplies can be put into effect. In cases where contamination might still reach consumers, fast and efficient communication systems are necessary. All these factors also point to the need for organized and practiced emergency procedures and preparedness. = Regulation = Since 2002, under the Bioterrorism Act, a water utility supplying more than 3,300 people must take at least the following measures to ensure security of the water supply: * Conduct an assessment of the facility's vulnerabilities to vandalism, insider sabotage, or terrorist attack, and submit the report to the EPA. * Show that the facility has an up-to-date emergency response plan, should an incident occur. More recently, under the Drinking Water Security Act of 2009, the EPA is now required to establish risk-based performance standards for community water systems serving more than 3,300 people. Cincinnati Water Works, San Francisco, and New York City are among the major water utilities that have taken water security measures at their facilities, such as planning for contamination warning systems. = Water utility security components = Security of a water supply involves a range of elements. Prevention and detection systems include some or all of the following: access to public health and customer complaint data, water quality monitoring equipment, sampling and analysis, cyber-security which includes situation management and IT systems hardware and software, and physical security. Crisis management and recovery, for when critical water events occur, includes flow control and security valves, rapid and effective communication systems, and emergency water supply equipment. Specific technologies involved in water security are SCADA, GIS (geographic information system), online (real-time) water quality monitoring devices, contamination warning systems, intrusion detection systems (IDS), contamination detection devices, security valves, security cameras and fences, situation management/emergency management software, emergency supply tanks, manned (or human) security personnel, personal purification devices, and counter-terrorism intelligence. Blue Peace US Navy Seabees tapping an artesian well in Helmand Province, Afghanistan Blue Peace is a method which seeks to transforms trans-boundary water issues into instruments for cooperation. This unique approach to turn tensions around water into opportunities for socio-economic development was developed by Strategic Foresight Group in partnership with the Governments of Switzerland and Sweden. Blue Peace is part of a larger trend of viewing water as a human right rather than a market commodity. When water is viewed as a human right, it empowers people in water stressed areas to manage their water sources effectively. Part of having effective management of water is ensuring that all socioeconomic groups of people in a region have adequate access to water, not just certain people. Conventional fossil or nuclear energy based desalination Due to record low rainfall in Summer 2005, the reservoir behind Sameura Dam runs low. The reservoir supplies water to Takamatsu, Shikoku Island, Japan. As new technological innovations continue to reduce the capital cost of desalination, more countries are building desalination plants as a small element in addressing their water crises. * Israel desalinizes water for a cost of 53 cents per cubic meter * Singapore desalinizes water for 49 cents per cubic meter and also treats sewage with reverse osmosis for industrial and potable use (NEWater). * China and India, the world's two most populous countries, are turning to desalination to provide a small part of their water needs * In 2007 Pakistan announced plans to use desalination * All Australian capital cities (except Darwin, Northern Territory and Hobart) are either in the process of building desalination plants, or are already using them. In late 2011, Melbourne will begin using Australia's largest desalination plant, the Wonthaggi desalination plant to raise low reservoir levels. * In 2007 Bermuda signed a contract to purchase a desalination plant * The largest desalination plant in the United States is the one at Tampa Bay, Florida, which began desalinizing 25 million gallons (95000 m¬≥) of water per day in December 2007.Applause, At Last, For Desalination Plant, The Tampa Tribune, December 22, 2007. In the United States, the cost of desalination is $3.06 for 1,000 gallons, or 81 cents per cubic meter.Desalination gets a serious look, Las Vegas Sun, March 21, 2008. In the United States, California, Arizona, Texas, and Florida use desalination for a very small part of their water supply. * After being desalinized at Jubail, Saudi Arabia, water is pumped inland though a pipeline to the capital city of Riyadh.Desalination is the Solution to Water Shortages, redOrbit, May 2, 2008. A January 17, 2008, article in the Wall Street Journal states, \\"World-wide, 13,080 desalination plants produce more than 12 billion gallons of water a day, according to the International Desalination Association.\\" Water, Water, Everywhere..., The Wall. St Journal, January 17, 2008. The world's largest desalination plant is the Jebel Ali Desalination Plant (Phase 2) in the United Arab Emirates. It is a dual-purpose facility that uses multi-stage flash distillation and is capable of producing 300 million cubic meters of water per year. A typical aircraft carrier in the U.S. military uses nuclear power to desalinize of water per day. While desalinizing of water can cost as much as $3, the same amount of bottled water costs $7,945.The Arid West‚ÄîWhere Water Is Scarce - Desalination‚Äîa Growing Watersupply Source, Library Index However, given the energy intensive nature of desalination, with associated economic and environmental costs, desalination is generally considered a last resort after water conservation. But this is changing as prices continue to fall. According to MSNBC, a report by Lux Research estimated that the worldwide desalinated water supply will triple between 2008 and 2020.A Rising Tide for New Desalinated Water Technologies, MSNBC, March. 17, 2009. However, not everyone is convinced that desalination is or will be economically viable or environmentally sustainable for the foreseeable future. Debbie Cook, the former mayor of Huntington Beach, California, has been a frequent critic of desalination proposals ever since she was appointed as a member of the California Desalination Task Force. Cook claims that in addition to being energy intensive, desalination schemes are very costly‚Äîoften much more costly than desalination proponents claim. In her writing on the subject, Cook points to a long list of projects that have stalled or been aborted for financial or other reasons, and suggests that water-stressed regions would do better to focus on conservation or other water supply solutions than to invest in desalination plants.Desalination: Unlocking Lessons from Yesterday‚Äôs Solution (part 1), Water Matters, January 17, 2009. Solar energy based desalination A novel approach to desalination is the seawater greenhouse, which takes seawater and uses solar energy to desalinate it in conjunction with growing food crops in a specially adapted greenhouse. Food security with tiny water foot print It is feasible to divert most of the available fresh water resources for drinking, industrial, hydro power and adequate environmental river flows purposes by reducing water use in agriculture which is consuming more than 80% of the global fresh water use. Without cultivating water intense crops, global food security can be achieved at faster pace by producing protein rich feed for cattle, poultry and fish from the cultivation of Methylococcus capsulatus bacteria culture with tiny land and water foot print using natural gas / biogas.  Water insecurity may lead to conflicts and wars  While the demand for water grows because of the growth of global population, many places around the world are also experiencing droughts and water pollution due to climate change. This could trigger intense competition for water, leading to regional instability and war.

Development The M.19 was developed to compete in the Sachsenflug competition for single-seat lightplanes, to requirements set down by the Deutsche Versuchsanstalt f√ºr Luftfahrt (DVL). It was Messerschmitt's first low-wing cantilever monoplane, though the fuselage and empennage were clearly related to that of the high-wing two-seat M.17 of 1925. This fuselage had five main longitudinal members, four defining the lower rectangular part and a raised, central dorsal member that made the upper cross-section triangular. These members tapered strongly together towards the tail unit, where the fuselage was very slim. The rudder and fin assembly wae noticeable for being extremely rectangular, higher than wide and dominated by the rudder; the fin chord was very narrow and amounted to little more than a streamlined rudder post. It had single-axle tailskid undercarriage. It was powered by an 18 kW (24 hp) ABC Scorpion engine. Operational history The M.19 was entered into the Sachsenflug competition, flown by Theo Cronweiss and won both the technical prize and the overall award, winning Messerschmitt 60,000 RM which he invested in BFW. Only two were built, but the low-wing, aerodynamically clean M.19 lead to a series of two-seat developments: the successful M.23, the M.27, the M.31 and the M.35.

A preliminary ruling is a final determinations of EU law, with no scope for appeal. The ECJ hands down its decision to the referring court, which is then obliged to implement the ruling. If, as in Factortame, the ECJ holds that a Member State's legislation conflicts with EU law, the Member State will be required to \\"disapply\\" such law, but the ECJ may not itself amend the Member State's legislation. Preliminary rulings have traditionally been issued by the ECJ. The Treaty of Lisbon provides that jurisdiction may be delegated to the General Court, but this provision has yet to be put into effect. Preliminary Rulings make up the bulk of CJEU business, as few persons have locus standi to litigate in the Luxembourg court. \\"Privileged parties\\" that do have standing include all Member States and EU Institutions, but normally a private person or \\"undertaking\\"An \\"undertaking\\" is EU-speak for a company, partnership or business firm. See TFEU Arts 101 & 102. will have standing only if they are the addressee of an EU Decision. Procedure If a court or tribunal of a Member State finds a provision of EU law to be ambiguous, equivocal or unclear, it may seek a preliminary ruling; and if that court or tribunal is one from which there is no appeal, the court must make an application. In either case, the domestic court be adjourned until the ECJ ruling is issued. The question to the ECJ must be short and succinct, but may be accompanied by documents explaining the context and circumstances of the issue. The ECJ may decline to give judgement in the absence of a genuine dispute, on the basis that it will not consider \\"moot points\\".Case 244/80, Pasquale Foglia v. Mariella Novello paragraph 18. Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides: Courts that may ask questions What constitutes a \\"court or tribunal\\" is a matter of Union law and it is not to be determined by reference to national law.Case C-24/92, Corbiau v Administration des Contributions at paragraph 15. In determining whether or not a body is a \\"court or tribunal of Member State\\" the European Courts will take a number of issues into account, namely whether‚Äî # it is established by law, # it is permanent, # its jurisdiction is compulsory, # it has an inter partes procedure, # it applies rules of law, and # it is independent.Case C-54/96 Dorsch Consult Ingenieurgesellschaft v Bundesbaugesellschaft Berlin at paragraph 23. However, these criteria are not absolute. In Broekmeulen v Huisarts Registratie CommissieCase 246/80, C. Broekmeulen v Huisarts Registratie Commissie the ECJ ruled that a body established under the auspices of the Royal Medical Society for the Promotion of Medicine was a \\"court or tribunal\\" within the meaning of the treaty, even though that society was a private association. Also the Benelux Court of Justice was considered a court within this context, as a court common to several (Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg) Member States. Also the Unified Patent Court, as a court common to several Member States is expected to be able to ask prejudicial questions. Right and duty to refer for a preliminary ruling Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) establishing the preliminary reference procedure differentiates between the right and the duty of national courts to seek a preliminary ruling. Under the discretionary reference stipulated in Article 267(2) TFEU, a national \\"court or tribunal\\" may ask the CJEU to give a preliminary ruling if it considers that a decision on the question is \\"necessary\\" to enable it to give a judgment in a particular case. The obligatory reference (duty to refer) is established in two cases: with respect to national courts adjudicating at last instance (Article 267(3) TFEU ) and with respect of all courts faced with a question of the validity of EU law. The obligation of national courts of last instance to refer for a preliminary ruling when a question of the interpretation of EU law arises is subject to certain exceptions. In accordance with the jurisprudence of the Court, a national court is relieved from the duty to refer (i) when EU law questions are not relevant to the decision in the main proceedings, (ii) in a situation before a national court is ‚Äúmaterially identical with a question which has already been subject of a preliminary ruling in a similar case‚Äù (‚Äòacte √©clair√©‚Äô), or (iii) when the proper interpretation of EU law is ‚Äúso obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt‚Äù (‚Äòacte clair‚Äô).Limante, Agne. Recent Developments in the Acte Clair Case Law of the EU Court of Justice: Towards a more Flexible Approach. JCMS: Journal of Common Market Studies, 2016, DOI: 10.1111/jcms.12434  General scope of preliminary rulings  The Court of Justice Decision has the force of res judicata. It is binding not only on the national court on whose initiative the reference for a preliminary ruling was made but also on all of the national courts of the Member States. In the context of a reference for a preliminary ruling concerning validity, if the European instrument is declared invalid all of the instruments adopted based on it are also invalid. It then falls to the competent European institutions to adopt a new instrument to rectify the situation. Ruling on non-EU cases The European Court of Justice is competent to give rulings regarding the interpretation of treaties to which the European Union is a party, as those treaties are considered to be part of EU law. ECJ is however also competent regarding the application of certain treaties between EU member states, although the procedure may be subject to different procedures. Two such treaties are the 1968 Brussels Convention on jurisdiction in civil and commercial matters and the 1980 Rome convention on applicable law (now mostly replaced by the Brussels I and Rome I regulations respectively). Similar systems The possibility to ask for a preliminary ruling is also embedded in other legal systems. *The courts of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg may ask \\"questions regarding the interpretation of the law\\" to the Benelux Court of Justice regarding certain Benelux conventions and regulations. *Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway may request the EFTA Court of Justice for an \\"advisory opinion\\" regarding the interpretation of the European Economic Area Agreement, as well as EU regulations that apply to those states.

It is used to treat Anoplocephala perfoliata (tapeworms) in horses and Fasciola hepatica (liver flukes). Mechanism of action Bithionol has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of soluble adenylyl cyclase, an intracellular enzyme important in the catalysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Soluble adenylyl cyclase is uniquely activated by bicarbonate. The cAMP formed by this enzyme is associated with capacitation of sperm, eye pressure regulation, acid-base regulation, and astrocyte/neuron communication. It is related to the organochlorine hexachlorophene, which has been shown to be an isomer-specific inhibitor of soluble adenylyl cyclase. Bithionol has two aromatic rings with a sulfur atom bonded between them and multiple chlorine ions and hydroxyl groups Attached to the phenyl groups. These functional groups are capable of hydrophobic, ionic, and polar interactions. These intermolecular interactions are responsible for the binding of bithionol to the bicarbonate binding site of soluble adenylyl cyclase efficiently enough to cause competitive inhibition with the usual bicarbonate substrate. The side chain of arginine 176 within the bicarbonate binding site interacts significantly with the aromatic ring of the bithionol molecule. This allosteric, conformational change interferes with the ability of the active site of soluble adenylyl cyclase to adequately bind ATP to convert it into cAMP. Arginine 176 usually interacts with the ATP and other catalytic ions at the active site, so when it turns from its normal position to interact with the bithionol inhibitor, it no longer functions in keeping the ATP bound to the active site. In another form of inhibition, bithionol is a much larger molecule than simple sodium bicarbonate, so it is large enough to reach through a small channel in the soluble adenylyl cyclase and interfere with binding of ATP, preventing its conversion to cAMP. This inhibition of the soluble adenylyl cyclase by bithionol at the bicarbonate binding site is demonstrated through a mixed-inhibition graph, where higher concentrations of bithionol have a lower Vmax and a larger Km. This translates to a decreased rate of reaction and a decreased affinity between substrates when bithionol is in higher concentrations. However, concentrations of bithionol that are required inhibit soluble adenylyl cyclase at clinically relevant levels are also cytotoxic in vivo. Thus, it cannot be used as the therapeutic drug needed to inhibit soluble adenylyl cyclase and therefore decrease the accumulation of cAMP within the cell. However, it sheds light on the search for a compound that will eventually be able to target the bicarbonate binding site of soluble adenylyl cyclase. Bithionol is the first known soluble adenylyl cyclase inhibitor to act through the bicarbonate binding site via a mostly allosteric mechanism. Safety and regulation LD50 (oral, mouse) is 2100 mg/kg. Bithionol was formerly used in soaps and cosmetics until the U.S. FDA banned it for its photosensitizing effects. The compound has been known to cause photocontact sensitization.

It was a stub line, about 27.5 kilometres long, from Landshut to Rottenburg an der Laaber, and was known by the locals as the Rottenburger Bockerl (‚ÄòRottenburg Goat‚Äô). Although the line is now closed, there is a plan to establish a museum railway on the remaining section from Landshut to Unterneuhausen. Planning As early as 1867 and 1878, options were explored for linking the towns of Landshut and Ingolstadt with of a railway, not least for military reasons. These investigations showed, however, that there was no widespread desire for through services. So in 1890 the Landshut town council awarded a contract for the assessing the construction of a railway from Landshut to Pfeffenhausen and a second one from Pfeffenhausen to Eggm√ºhl. In September 1891 the Munich-based Lokalbahn AG gave its report. This envisaged a 20.09 kilometre-long route to Pfeffenhausen at a cost of 1,250,000 marks. However it concluded that the construction of a route from Pfeffenhausen to Eggm√ºhl would not have met the transportation interests of the upper Laaber Valley, which was aligned with the county capital of Landshut. So the Royal Bavarian State Government decided, in the supplement to the draft of the Lokalbahn ('local line') law of 12 December 1895, that a Lokalbahn from Landshut to Pfeffenhausen with an extension to Rottenburg would be the most appropriate course. The option of extending it to Ingolstadt was left open. Land required for the construction of the line was transferred to the Bavarian state at no cost. On 17 June 1896 the \\"Landshut‚ÄìRottenburg Localbahn project\\" was approved under a Lokalbahn law. It was promised that this would deliver advantages, especially for local farmers, not just for the growing of cereals and farming of cattle but also for hop cultivation in the Hallertau. Construction At that time it was common for many Italian workers to be employed when a railway was being built. The greatest inclines were the ramp at Arth (20‚Ä∞), the watershed between Pfettrach and Laber (23‚Ä∞) and the high ridge of Pfeffenhausen in the direction of Rottenburg (25‚Ä∞). The terminal station in Rottenburg was 1.1 kilometres from the market, which was 20 metres above the level of the station. The first cost estimate came to 1,444,000 marks. Between Landshut and Pfeffenhausen a route was selected that was about one kilometre shorter than originally planned, which meant that only 170,000 m¬≥ of earth needed to be moved. Thus the final cost amounted to 1,377,763 marks, of which the state contributed 1,210,499 marks. On 29 October 1900 the first trial run took place with a Bavarian D VII steam engine in charge and on 3 November the route was opened in festive style with four special trains being laid on. Operations The Rottenburger Bockerl was a typical Bavarian Lokalbahn, running past large fields of grain and hops as well as farmyards and mills. Its services included many GmP mixed trains, which had long journey times due to the need to shunt wagons at stations en route. Passenger numbers were boosted by visitors to the weekly and annual markets as well as the cattle markets. Pure goods trains were initially quite rare. Until 1930, two Bavarian Class D XI (later DRG Class 98.4-5) steam locomotives handled the work, supplemented occasionally by a D VII (DRG Class 98.76). The nature of the route and the quality of the track only permitted a top speed of 30 km/h. In summer 1921 three trains ran in each direction daily. The evening train needed 99 minutes, which equated to an average speed of just 16.7 km/h. At track crossings the train could only proceed at 15 km/h and, in some cases, just 10 km/h, ringing its bell as a warning. The Zornhof mountain was notorious: leaf fall in the autumn or snow in winter meant that, sometimes, the locomotive in charge of heavily loaded trains would get stuck with its wheels spinning. Then a fresh attempt had to be made with fewer coaches. Around 1930 the two D XI's were reinforced by a BB II (DRG Class 98.7). From 1935 to about 1940 the line was worked by a D XI, a BB II and a Pt 2/3 (DRG Class 70). In 1940 the Pt 2/3 was replaced by a GtL 4/4 (DRG Class 98.8-9). From 1943 onwards only Class Pt 2/3 engines were used. In 1951 the GtL 4/5 (DRG Class 98.10) took their place. After the summer timetable of 1952 the journey still took a good hour. After the timetable change in 1955 the majority of the steam engines disappeared from the line, just one remained for hauling school trains, usually the GtL 4/5, no. 98 1006. Uerdingen railbuses now appeared in service and were used in a VT 98 + VB 98 + VS 98 combination. Sometimes a VB 140 was also used, initially with a goods van for part-load goods. Passenger and goods trains were hauled by Class 64 steam engines and, later, by V 100 diesels. The end In spite of all efforts to the contrary, traffic increasingly transferred from rail to roads. With the timetable change on 25 May 1974 passenger services ceased and were switched to railway-owned buses. Railbus no. 798 669-8 was the last passenger service, running that day from Landshut to Rottenburg with members of the Landshut model railway club The Rottenburg town band played Ich hatt' einen Kameraden (\\"I had a comrade\\") and, at 8.45 pm, the railbus set off on its return journey. Railway facilities no longer needed for goods traffic disappeared. The station building at Weihmichl was demolished in September 1974 and the linesman's hut (Warteh√§uschen) at Arth in February 1975. On 31 January 1982 the ticket and parcels offices at Rottenburg station were closed. The small amount of goods traffic was handled by DB Class V 60 (later renamed Class 260) diesel locos. Occasionally engines of classes 211, 212 and 218 were used. In 1990 the Rottenburg Bockerl Society (Interessengemeinschaft Rottenburger Bockerl) was founded; in 1994 it was renamed to the Landshut-Rottenburg Steam Train Society (Dampfzugfreunde Landshut-Rottenburg). Since the early 1990s locomotives of classes 365 and 335 have run on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays (request only) to Rottenburg for shunting duties. Despite the track being refurbished in the 1980s, the top speed is in most places still only 30 km/h as it was when the line was first opened. The society regularly organises specials. O 12 June 1994 no. V 200 002 hauled a special to Rottenburg. Other specials were hauled by locomotive no. 23 105 on 27 June 1993 and no. 41 1150 on 14 August 1994. On 27 September 1998 the steam locomotive no. 41 1150 made a farewell journey, the last train to run on the entire route. From Unterneuhausen (km 14.2) to Rottenburg the track and sleepers were removed from the ballast bed in 2002/03. Since 15 September 2000 the remaining section of the line has been rented from its owner, DB Netz, to the Landshut-Rottenburg Steam Train Society (infrastructure company: BayernBahn), which hopes to run a museum railway on it. The necessary concession was granted in 2005, however its operation has been repeatedly delayed. In the area of the level crossing over the B 299 at Oberndorf near Weihmichl the track and trackbed had been fully replaced by the end of 2007 over a length of 50 m, after a large quantity of diesel fuel had leaked into the soil following an accident with a lorry tanker on 14 September 2006.Presseerkl√§rung der Dampfzugfreunde Landshut-Rottenburg e.V. zur Meldung ‚ÄûDampfzugfreunde behindern Bahngleis‚Äú by the Landshuter Zeitung dated 10 February 2007‚ÄûThe Museumseisenbahn soll fahren‚Äú: Report in the Landshuter Zeitung dated 7 December 2007 The county of Landshut and the village of Altdorf are sceptical about the museum project: The council and mayor have repeated several times \\"that it is their aim to get rid of the railway and built a footpath and cycle way on the trackbed\\". ‚ÄûNeue Ampel for mehr Schulweg-Sicherheit‚Äú: Report on the Landkreis Landshut web site with a statement about the Landshut‚ÄìUnterneuhausen railway (Arth) See also *Royal Bavarian State Railways *Bavarian branch lines *List of closed railway lines in Bavaria References Sources *Walther Zeitler, Eisenbahnen in Niederbayern and in der Oberpfalz, Buch- and Kunstverlag Oberpfalz, Weiden, 1985, *G√ºnter Begert sen., Heinrich Stangl, Landshut (Bay)‚ÄìRottenburg (Laaber), Neben- and Schmalspurbahnen in Deutschland (Sammelwerk als Loseblattausgabe), Weltbild Verlag, Augsburg, 1994, ISSN 0949-2143 Branch lines in Bavaria ","title":"Landshut‚ÄìRottenburg railway"},{"id":"21161610","text":"Euchaetis rhizobola is a moth of the family Oecophoridae.

Before he joined to Socialist People's Party he was a member of the Communist Party of Denmark from 1953 to 1958. He was a member of parliament for the Socialist People's Party in the period 1966‚Äì1977. He left parliament and the party in 1977. Party chairman Born in Stokkemarke, √òmann became chairman of the Socialist People's Party when Aksel Larsen resigned in 1968. The political climate in his period as chairman was marked by the referendum on Denmark's EC membership in 1972 as well as the Social Democrats being in opposition and the need for the two left-wing parties to position themselves. In 1971 the Left Socialists lost parliamentary representation and the Socialist People's Party became the only party in parliament to the left of the Social Democrats. Although √òmann wanted to cooperate with the Social Democrats, such cooperation did not start until 1973 when a national budget deficit created a wish for a more restrictive financial policy. The parliamentary right wing wanted to cut more costs than the Social Democrats or the Socialist People's Party wanted, so the two parties made an agreement on budget cuts and increases in corporation taxes. In June 1973 a compromise between the two parties on rent regulation forced the Socialist People's Party to accept increases in rents which were contrary to the party's policies. In the campaign leading up to the referendum on Denmark's EC membership in 1972, the Socialist People's Party was the only party in parliament to campaign against EC membership and was a co-founder of the People's Movement against the EC. During √òmann's time as chairman in the 1970s environmental issues began to attract attention when the Left Socialists adopted an environmental policy. At first the Socialist People's Party was skeptical but pressure from party members made the party adopt an environmental policy of its own. √òmann's wish for cooperation with the Social Democrats was not universally supported inside the party where some members wanted a more critical line towards the center-left and more emphasis on appealing to extra-parliamentary organisations. In 1974 Gert Petersen, who was seen as more left-wing than √òmann, took over as chairman.

The Act expands the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) and provides legal assistance to survivors of dating violence. Named after sexual assault survivor Debbie Smith, the Act was passed by the 108th Congress as part of larger legislation, the Justice for All Act of 2004 (), and signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 30, 2004. The Act amended the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 (), the DNA Identification Act of 1994 (), the Violence Against Women Act of 2000, and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The Act was reauthorized in 2008, extending the availability of DNA backlog reduction program grants, DNA evidence training and education program grants, and sexual assault forensic exam program grants through fiscal year 2014. Debbie Smith On March 3, 1989, a man wearing a ski mask entered Debbie Smith's home in Williamsburg, Virginia, threatened her with a gun, dragged her into the woods, blindfolded her, and raped her repeatedly over the next hour. Smith participated in the collection of DNA evidence for a rape kit, but it was neither formally tested nor entered into a national database until 1994. On July 24, 1995, a DNA technician identified Debbie's attacker, Norman Jimmerson, while analyzing various DNA records. Jimmerson, then serving time for abducting and robbing two women in 1989, was sentenced to 161 years in prison under the three strikes law. Provisions of the Act The Act attempts to eliminate backlogs of DNA samples collected from crime victims and criminal offenders, to expand the number and type of samples included in the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), and to provide legal assistance to survivors of dating violence. The Act amends the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 14135) to reauthorize and broaden the number of eligible grantees under the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program. The Act expands eligible grantees to include local units of government and authorizes the appropriation of $151,000,000 each year for fiscal years 2005 through 2009 to states and local units of government to conduct DNA analyses of backlogged DNA samples collected from victims and criminal offenders. Under the Act, the Attorney General may award grants to eligible grantees to alleviate backlogs requiring a forensic science other than DNA analysis pending the state or local unit of government can certify that no significant backlog awaits DNA analysis and that there is no immediate need for laboratory equipment, supplies, or additional personnel to ensure the timely processing of future DNA evidence. The Act also amends the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 14135) to provide for the use of vouchers or contracts for laboratory services to assist in the reduction of backlogged DNA evidence. The Act amends the DNA Identification Act of 1994 to provide for the inclusion of DNA samples collected from individuals charged in an indictment or information with a crime and individuals whose DNA samples are collected by proper legal authorities into the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS). The Act amends the Violence Against Women Act of 2000 to broaden the type of survivors eligible for legal assistance to include survivors of dating violence. 2008 Reauthorization The Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act of 2008 maintains previous appropriation levels for the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program through 2014. The 2008 Reauthorization amends the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 by authorizing the appropriation of $151,000,000 each year for fiscal years 2009 through 2014 for grants to eligible states and local units of government to conduct DNA analyses of backlogged DNA samples collected from victims and criminal offenders. The Reauthorization Act of 2008 amends the DNA Sexual Assault Justice Act of 2004 to extend DNA training and education grant programs for law enforcement, correctional personnel and court officers through 2014. The Act authorizes the appropriation of $12,500,000 each year for fiscal years 2009 through 2014 for training, technical assistance and education for law enforcement, correctional personnel and court officers regarding the identification, collection, preservation and analysis of DNA samples and evidence. The Act also maintains sexual assault forensic exam program grants through 2014, authorizing the appropriation of $30,000,000 each year for fiscal years 2009 through 2014. Eligible states, units of local government and sexual assault examination programs can apply for sexual assault forensic exam program grants for training, technical assistance and education regarding the identification, collection, preservation and analysis of DNA samples and evidence. 2014 Reauthorization On March 27, 2014, Goodlatte introduced the Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act of 2014 (H.R. 4323; 113th Congress) into the House. The bill would amend the Debbie Smith Act of 2004 in order to reauthorize funding through Fiscal Year 2019 for the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program, sexual assault forensic exam program grants, and DNA training and education for law enforcement, correctional personnel, and court officers. The bill would authorize the appropriation of $968 million over the 2015-2019 period. The grant program would go to the states to run programs to analyze DNA samples from crime victims. The House voted on April 7, 2014 to pass the bill in a voice vote. 2019 Reauthorization In 2019, the Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act of 2019 was signed into law by Trump to provide funding to help eliminate backlogs in rape kit testing. More than 100,000 rape kits in the United States remain untested. https://www.wsj.com/articles/your-dna- could-catch-a-criminal-11578863580 Evaluations of Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program Investigations conducted by CBS News and by Human Rights Watch have revealed that despite five years and millions in federal funding, rape kit backlogs persist in the United States and have increased in several grant supported states and counties. According to a 2009 CBS News investigation, at least 20,000 untested rape kits were being held in four major U.S. cities and an additional twelve major cities had no idea how many rape kits remained untested in law enforcement storage facilities. An October 2008 audit of the Los Angeles city crime lab by Human Rights Watch revealed that rape kit backlogs increased between 2004 and 2008, despite nearly $4 million in Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Program grants. In January 2007, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) revealed that approximately 5,000 rape kits resided in LAPD storage facilities. By July 2008 the backlog grew to 7,300, but was later estimated at 5,193 by a February 2009 audit. According to ABC News, since 2004, the Debbie Smith Act has had some success with almost 200,000 sexual offenders identified, and over 40% of all DNA matches since 2005 were because of resources that became available because of grant money.https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-signs-bill-eliminate-backlog-rape-kit- testing/story?id=67997113 The National Institute of Justice (NIJ), the research arm of the U.S. Department of Justice, has also conducted research into the continued development of the DNA forensic evidence backlog. In their research, the NIJ tracked the processing of the two main types of DNA evidence: \\"casework\\" DNA and \\"convicted offender and arrestee\\" DNA. Casework DNA refers to DNA samples collected from crime scenes, victims and suspects in criminal cases, while convicted offender and arrestee DNA refers to samples taken in accordance with state and federal laws for entry into the Federal Bureau of Investigation's CODIS system. In a 2010 survey, the NIJ found that the nationwide casework DNA backlog exceeded 111,500 samples, a substantial increase over the 38,000 cases considered to be backlogged in a 2005 Bureau of Justice Statistics survey. Convicted offender and arrestee DNA samples have experienced even more substantial backlogging according to the NIJ, although there is a larger number of convicted offender and arrestee samples sent for processing. Regardless, a 2009 NIJ study found that the year-end backlog of convicted offender and arrestee samples had reached over 950,000 samples, the equivalent of almost an entire year's capacity for the nation's crime laboratories.

After the Synod of Dort of 1618-19, he worked and wrote against the Remonstrants. Life He was born at Vianen to Roman Catholic parents. Brought up by relatives at Gouda, he was sent, in 1597, to some priests at Amsterdam to study theology. Toward the end of 1598 he went to Leuven where doubts arose in his mind which ultimately led him to break with Catholicism. He was entrusted with a mission to Haarlem by the head of the Collegium Pontificium, and never returned to Leuven. After a few weeks at Gouda, where his foster relations rejected him, he sought refuge in the house of his parents, where he studied Reformed tenets, meanwhile seeking occupation to gain his livelihood.http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/encyc/encyc12/htm/ii.xii.htm In 1602 he was made rector of the school at Vianen, and in the following year entered the Reformed Church. Having prepared privately for the ministry, he was ordained pastor at Stolwijk in 1607; and was pastor at Amsterdam, from 1610. Here, in 1614, he became involved in affairs of Church and state which ended only with his death. In 1617 he received leave of absence to the Reformed church at The Hague, and was a deputy of the provincial synod of North Holland to the Synod of Dort, which appointed him a member of the committee to draw up the Canons of Dort. Trigland was professor of theology at the University of Leiden, succeeding Andr√© Rivet in 1633.Peter T. van Rooden, Theology, Biblical Scholarship, and Rabbinical Studies in the Seventeenth Century: Constantijn L'Empereur (1591-1648), Professor of Hebrew and Theology at Leiden (1989), note pp. 53-4. He lectured on the exegesis of the Old Testament, on the Loci Communes, 1639‚Äì50, and later on cases of conscience. He was also pastor of the Reformed church at Leiden (1637‚Äì45). He died at Leiden. Works His Kerckelycke Geschiedenissen (Leiden 1650) was an important work on Calvinist church histories. In it he commented on the work of Johannes Uytenbogaert, who had published a Remonstrant Church History in 1646.Willem Frijhoff, Marijke Spies, Dutch Culture in a European Perspective: 1650: Hard-won unity (2004), p. 362. His own distinctive view traced the Protestant Reformation back to Wessel Gansfort, and claimed that the doctrine of election in Philipp Melanchthon and Heinrich Bullinger was compatible with the outcome of the Synod of Dort.Alastair Duke, Reformation and Revolt in the Low Countries (2003), note p. 4. Writing against the Remonstrants, his feeling was that their teachings were pernicious and not to be allowed. This is plain in his Den rechtghematichden Christen (Amsterdam, 1615). In his Verdedigingh van de Leere end' Eere der Ghereformeerde Kerken, ende Leeraren (1616) he defends Reformed dogmatics. He opposed civil intervention in ecclesiastical affairs in his Antwoordt op drij vraghen dienende tot advys in de huydendagsche kerklijke swarigheden (1615), and his Christelijcke ende nootwendighe verclaringhe (1615). Family Cornelis Trigland, tutor to the future William III of England, was his son.Wouter Troost, William III the Stadholder-king: A Political Biography (2005 translation), p. 34.

It is the final installment of the Boogeyman film series, following Boogeyman and Boogeyman 2 and centers on a college sophomore, Sarah Morris, who tries to convince her dorm that the Boogeyman is real. Little does she know that the more she tells people of the existence of the Boogeyman, the evil supernatural force becomes stronger. Plot The film begins with Dr. Mitchell Allen's (Tobin Bell) daughter, Audrey (Nikki Sanderson). Audrey proceeds to take a shower and while doing so, sees a hand with a black glove. Scared, Audrey gets out and goes to her room to sleep. Her dog, however, is up and wants to play ball. To get him away she throw the ball in the closet; after a while, she gets worried her dog hasn't come back yet. She walks to the closet and finds blood lining it. She backs away and, with a scream, gets pulled under her bed. Sarah Morris (Erin Cahill) is a student who is doing a radio show for her college radio station where she tries to help people with their problems, such as a guy just breaking up with his girlfriend. Soon after she is introduced, Audrey arrives in Sarah‚Äôs room at night, raving that ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs everywhere‚Äù. Sarah lets her stay the night. During Sarah‚Äôs radio show the next day, Audrey calls to tell Sarah and Dr. Kane about the Boogeyman. They don‚Äôt believe her, but Sarah goes to find her, thinking she is suicidal, while Dr. Kane remains with her on the phone. The Boogeyman then begins to strangle Audrey when Sarah arrives. When others arrive to see it, Audrey appears to have hung herself. Soon after, Sarah discovers a diary amongst Audrey‚Äôs things. Upon reading it, she begins to believe the Boogeyman is real, and tries to warn her friends and boyfriend, David (Chuck Hittinger). They refuse to believe her thinking she is dealing with the trauma of her friend dying soon after her mother‚Äòs death. Her friends in the dorm begin to disappear, as Sarah has visions of their deaths through being pulled into the alternate world of the Boogeyman. People refuse to believe her claims but campus talk of the Boogeyman from hearing her radio show continues to swirl. Sarah begins to believe the Boogeyman gains his power from the legend continuing by people believing he might be real. Dr. Kane begins to worry about her mental stability. Sarah takes over the radio station to warn the students away, prompting her arrest by campus security. While held in custody, Dr. Kane negotiates her release until the body of Sarah‚Äôs friend Lindsey is found in a washer. Sarah realizes Dr. Kane is actually beginning to believe when they both witness a light manifestation of the Boogeyman. Dr. Kane, trying to prove she is wrong, enters the room where the light is, and is subsequently beaten to death by the Boogeyman. Sarah then realizes the Boogeyman has been using her fear to warn everyone in order to get everyone to believe in him. Sarah rushes back to her room to save David, who now believes her story and has been reading the diary. She finds him staring off into a black closet, but is unable to prevent the Boogeyman from pulling him in. David is soon-after flung out into the room, disemboweled, covering her in blood. The police and students arrive to find the scene. To prevent the Boogeyman‚Äôs growth in power, Sarah claims she committed all the murders herself and that the Boogeyman is not real. One of the officers in the elevator reveals he doesn‚Äôt believe she could have done that by herself. She insists that she did, but the elevator stops and she is pulled up into the elevator shaft by the Boogeyman, while the two police officers stare in disbelief as Sarah's cries for help fade away. One year later, Amy (Jayne Wisener) and Jennifer (Kate Maberly) are staying in Sarah‚Äôs room. Amy interrupts Jennifer's studies to tell her the story of the ‚Äúcrazy girl‚Äù (Sarah) who thought the Boogeyman was real that lived in the room a year ago. It is revealed the college changed the dorm name to keep people from being afraid to move in. Jennifer leaves to go to the library for some peace, noticing that Amy actually seems scared to be alone and taunting her as she leaves. Left alone, Amy is soon attacked and dragged by the Boogeyman beneath her bed to an unknown fate.

The term was coined by Emil Kraepelin in his 1906 monograph titled √úber Sprachst√∂rungen im Traume (\\"On Language Disturbances in Dreams\\"). The text discussed various forms of dream speech, outlining 286 examples. Dream speech is not to be confounded with the 'language of dreams', which refers to the visual means of representing thought in dreams. Three types of dream speech were considered by Kraepelin: disorders of word-selection (also called paraphasias), disorders of discourse (e.g. agrammatisms) and thought disorders. The most frequent occurring form of dream speech is a neologism. Kraepelin studied dream speech because it provided him with clues to the analogous language disturbances of patients with schizophrenia. Still in 1920 he stated that \\"dream speech in every detail corresponds to schizophrenic speech disorder.\\" While Kraepelin was interested in the psychiatric as well as the psychological aspects of dream speech, modern researchers have been interested in speech production in dreams as illuminating aspects of cognition in the dreaming mind. They have found that during dream speech, Wernicke's area is functioning well, but Broca's area is not, leading to proper grammar but little meaning. The other Kraepelin Dream speech opens up a new perspective on the psychiatrist Kraepelin, usually seen as the spiritual father of the DSM system of classification of psychiatric diseases, and of biological psychiatry. However Kraepelin, one of the first disciples of Wilhelm Wundt, took a lifelong interest in psychology, and even edited a journal Psychologische Arbeiten. One of the booklets of this journal, a 104-page article on dream speech, appeared early in 1906, before the 105-page monograph was published at the end of 1906. =Dreaming for psychiatry's sake= In his monograph Kraepelin presented 286 examples of dream speech, mainly his own. After 1906 he continued to collect samples of dream speech until his death in 1926. This time the dream speech specimens were almost exclusively his own and the original hand written dream texts are still available today at the Archive of the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry in Munich. These new dream speech specimens have been published in 1993 in Heynick (in part in English translation) and in 2006 in the original German, with numerous valuable notes added. The second dream corpus has not been censored and dates are added to the dreams. As Kraepelin in 1906 had been collecting dream speech for more than 20 years, he jotted down his dream speech specimens for more than 40 years, with a scientific viewpoint in mind. Kraepelin's dream speech started during a period (1882‚Äì1884) of personal crisis and depression. In 1882 Kraepelin was fired after working only a few weeks at the Leipzig psychiatric clinic and two months later his father died. =Schizophrenic speech disorder= Already in the early years of his career Kraepelin had been confronted with schizophrenic speech disorder - called first Sprachverwirrtheit then schizophrene Sprachverwirrtheit and finally Schizophasie - produced by his patients. But ‚Äîas Kraepelin states‚Äî the schizophasia can hardly be studied, because what the patient is trying to express is unknown. However using the classical dream-psychosis analogy, he tried to first study dream speech in the hope that this would lead to insights into schizophrenic speech disorder. And so Kraepelin got used to recording his dreams, not to interpret them for personal use as in psychanalysis, but to use them for a scientific study. Kraepelin was not only able to record the deviant speech in his dreams, but also the intended utterance (which was lacking in the deviant speech of his patients, who clearly cannot cross the boundary from psychosis to reality). For example, most neologisms (the deviant utterance) in Kraepelin's dreams have a meaning (the intended utterance). =Fundamental disturbances= Kraepelin pointed out two fundamental disturbances underlying dream speech: a diminished functioning of the Wernicke area, and a diminished functioning of those frontal areas in which abstract reasoning is localized. Therefore, individual ideas (Individualvorstellungen) get expressed in dreams instead of general ideas. Among these individual ideas he included proper names in their widest sense. =Two examples= Kraepelin's dream speech specimens range from rather simple to extremely intricate. Kraepelin's own analysis is limited in scope. The monograph (available on Google) shows his approach. Several of his dreams can however be analysed in depth. Two examples - one from the second corpus and one from the first and both not analysed by Kraepelin himself - illustrate this.  Vi, tafalk! On August 13, 1923 Kraepelin jotted down the following example of dream speech: This is, as Kraepelin informs us, an order to the grave digger, named Vi, to bring the coffin for the body during a funeral. Kraepelin notes, that the neologism tafalk is a shortcut for German Katafalk (catafalque). Obviously Vi‚Äîin the utterance Vi, tafalk‚Äîreplaces the syllable Ka. nsens While Vi, tafalk! is quite easy to analyze, in the same article (p. 1290) the authors demonstrate how the associative paths leading to the complex neologism nsens (in dream specimen no. 107 of Kraepelin's first corpus) can be reconstructed from its origin Firmenschild (= \\"company sign\\"). Nsens derives from the English word \\"nonsense\\", once the letters of the word \\"one\\" have been deleted. Literally nsens is nonsense - one. This in its turn links to \\"crap a ace\\" (\\"crap\\" meaning \\"nonsense\\", Greek prefix a meaning \\"without\\" and \\"ace\\" meaning \\"one\\" in dice games). \\"Crap a ace\\" is derived from a metathesis of \\"carapace\\", a typical Kraepelin-word for German Schild in Firmenschild. In short four association steps link Schild to nsens: Schild= (1) carapace - (2) crap ace= (3) nonsense without one - (4) nsens. The chain shows an alternation of conceptual associations (e.g. synonyms) and word form associations (character and sound associations). (1) and (3) are conceptual associations, (2) and (4) are word form associations. Kraepelin himself ‚Äî ignorant of the code governing his dream speech ‚Äî termed nsens an example of \\"syllable combinations jumbled in a completely arbitrary way.\\" He thinks nsens is Russian. Kraepelin's false assertion, according to the authors, originates from the associative network in his dreaming brain during the production of nsens. It is Russian krepkea (–∫—Ä–µ–ø–∫–∞—è ['krep.k…ô.j…ô]), meaning \\"firm\\" and so an association to the first part of Firmenschild, that provokes the transformation of \\"carapace\\" to \\"crap a ace\\". Krepkea as well as \\"crap\\" are Kraepelin-words. In terms of cryptography (1) and (3) are code-type associations, emphasizing meaning, whereas (2) and (4) are cipher-type associations, emphasizing characters (cf. Pincock & Fary, 2007, p. 13). =The Kraepelin code= Words like 'carapace', 'krapkea', and 'crap' constitute the 'Kraepelin' code, a set of words that sound like parts of the proper name Kraepelin and influence/direct associational processes. The key role of the proper name can be explained by referring to the so-called cocktail party effect, which states that during a cocktail party we tune in on our discussion partner, neglecting background noise. However, we notice when someone in the background pronounces our name. This cocktail party effect has been replicated in an experimental set up using the dichotic listening technique. It has been shown that only our proper name tends to break through the attentional barrier, i.e. breaks through amidst other, neglected, sounds offered to the unattended ear. Thus it follows that our proper name is detected even under conditions of low attention. What happens within outer speech during a cocktail-party, likewise occurs within inner speech in dreams. Code words - linked in sound to our proper name - will be detected in the set of potential associations during thinking. The ongoing thinking process will then deviate because code words will act as priming- words, influencing the direction in which associations will go (Engels, 2005, p. 187). Chaika vs. Fromkin As Kraepelin likened dream speech to schizophasia, what is the current view on the last disorder? While in the famous debate during the '70s between the linguists Elaine Chaika and Victoria Fromkin on schizophrenic speech, Chaika long held the position that schizophasia was sort of an intermittent aphasia while Fromkin stated that schizophrenic speech errors could also occur in \\"normals,\\" the debate has now been ended because according to Chaika (1995) She also thinks that Chaika compares schizophrenic speech errors with intricate speech errors, difficult to analyze. The current Chaika position comes close to Kraepelin's position (1920), who noted that errors as in schizophasia can also occur in normals in dreams. Cognitive dream speech research At first sight dream speech plays only a marginal role in dream theory. However the important connection of dream and speech is very well illustrated by the following statement of David Foulkes: \\"However visual dreaming may seem, it may be planned and regulated by the human speech production system.\\" (see e.g. Kilroe, 2001). Recent research has confirmed one of Kraepelin's fundamental disturbances. In the book The Committee of Sleep, Harvard psychologist Deirdre Barrett describes examples of dreamed literature‚Äîin which the dreamers heard or read words which they awakened later wrote and published. She observes that almost all the examples are of poetry rather than prose or fiction, the only exceptions being one- or several-word phrases such as the Book title Vanity Fair which came to Thackeray in a dream, or similarly Katherine Mansfield's Sun and Moon. Barrett suggests that the reason poetry fares better in dreams is that grammar seems to be well preserved in dream language while meaning suffers and rhyme and rhythm are more prominent than when awake‚Äîall characteristics which benefit poetry but not other forms. In other work, Barrett has studied verbatim language in college students' dreams and found them similar in these characteristics‚Äîintact grammar, poor meaning, rhythm and rhyme‚Äîto the literary examples. She observes that this is suggestive that of the two language centers in the brain, Wernicke‚Äôs area must not be functioning well, but Broca's area seems to be as this language resembles that of patients with Wernicke's aphasia.

The main protagonist, Hiro, can cast spells, including fireball and lighting attacks, camouflage, and time manipulation. Hiro can also possess spirits, such as animals, for a short period of time. Spells are cast using Ki, which is dropped by enemies and can be replenished with potions. The enemies in Mini Ninjas are animals enchanted by the main antagonist, turning them into samurai warriors. When defeated, the curse is broken and the enemies return to their previous animal form, and can assist the player. For example, brown bears can attack with their claws, warthogs charge at enemies, and panda bears can slam into the ground. All animals have a keen sense of smell for spotting ingredients and collectibles in places that are easily overlooked. Other enemies in the game include ghosts, which approach the player and attempt to drain their life force. Throughout their journey, players can collect coins and ingredients, such as mushrooms, flowers, and ginseng roots. They can exchange these coins for weapons and recipes from the Tengu, crow-like humanoids who also give quests and advice. Fruits found on trees or bushes can be harvested by shaking the bushes or the trunk of trees, which will restore their health. Other foods like sushi do the same thing. Scattered throughout the world are ancient shrines, each containing a scroll that grants Hiro a new spell. There are also 100 Jizo statues hidden throughout the game, which can be collected for special achievements or trophies. Plot In ancient Japan, an era of peace of harmony has existed ever since the evil samurai warlord Ashida was defeated at the hand of a wise ninja master. In the wake of Ashida's defeat, the ninja master hid the secrets of Kuji magic, which grants one power over nature, in various scrolls contained in shrines across the wilderness. Three centuries later, at Ninja Mountain, the ninja master has trained six orphans in the way of the ninja with the aid of the mountain's tengu inhabitants. The youngest of these ninjas, Hiro, possesses the power to control Kuji magic. Hiro lives on the mountain in peace alongside his friends - clumsy but strong Futo, flute-playing Suzume, archer Shun, tiger-like Tora, and spear-wielding Kunoichi. The long-lasting peace begins to slowly erode when mysterious events begin to occur across the countryside, including the disappearance of animals and sightings of armored samurai in the wilderness. The ninja master eventually learns that Ashida has returned, and is using Kuji magic to convert forest animals into deadly samurai warriors. The ninja master sends Kunoichi, Tora, Shun, and Suzume to investigate Ashida's army, but all are captured behind enemy lines. Reluctantly, the ninja master then sends out his last ninjas, Hiro and Futo, after teaching Hiro how to learn Kuji spells from the hidden shrines across the country. Hiro and Futo rescue Suzume from the samurai and infiltrate the Earth Castle, where they defeat an enormous samurai boss; subsequently, the castle explodes, and Ashida becomes aware of the existence of the new ninjas. Hiro and his allies continue to push through the wilderness, encountering many dangers, including new varieties of samurai with unique powers, as well as tortured spirits which try to steal their life force. Along the way, they find and rescue Shun, Tora, and Kunoichi from the clutches of the samurai. The ninjas reach the Night Castle and defeat its boss, subsequently doing the same for the Water Castle and the Snow Castle. An outraged Ashida taunts the ninjas to come face him at his fortress, located atop a volcano. The ninjas reach Ashida's castle, which he animates using Kuji, turning it into an enormous monstrosity. The ninjas are able to infiltrate the castle, where Hiro confronts and defeats Ashida, who falls to his death in the volcano. Peace restored in the land, the ninjas return triumphantly to Ninja Mountain. Development and release Mini Ninjas was announced on January 19, 2009, along with the first official trailer.

The fort was built after more than 40 years of indecision over the defence of South Australia. It was the first colonial fortification in the state and is the best preserved and most functional in Australia. Fort Glanville was designed by Governor Major General Sir William Jervois and Lieutenant Colonel Peter Scratchley, both important figures in early Australian colonial defence. When built it was designed to defend both Semaphore's anchorage and shipping entering the Port River from naval attack. Construction of the fort began in 1878. It was officially opened in October 1880 and completed by 1882. Due to changes in the Port River and shipping movements, Fort Largs surpassed it for strategic importance by 1890. By the close of the 19th century, the fort was largely unused and had no defence significance. It was briefly used for military purposes during World War I and World War II, though not for its original defensive role. For much of the 20th century the area was put to a variety of uses including accommodation, a caravan park and a boy scout campsite. After coming into state government hands in 1951 it was declared as a conservation park and is now managed by the Department for Environment and Water (DEW); preserving and showcasing its historic value. The fort and surrounds occupy the northern half of the conservation park, the southern half is a caravan park. The fort is a lunette shaped defensible battery that was supported by land forces for self-defence. When constructed it was seen as state of the art, incorporating powerful and modern weapons. Its main armament is two rifled muzzle-loading (RML) 10 inch 20 ton guns backed up by two RML 64 pounder 64 cwt guns, both rare in their particular configuration. The fort retains its original 19th century cannons and three have been restored to working condition. Fort Glanville Historical Association operates the park under license and conducts open days in the park, recreating the past operation of the fort including military drill and the firing of period weapons. The Association, park service, other volunteers and various grants have all helped ensure the fort is presented in close to original condition. It is the most complete 19th Century fort in Australia, and one of very few in the world that remains in original condition. Connecting the fort to Semaphore jetty is the Semaphore and Fort Glanville Tourist Railway, a gauge passenger steam train operated by volunteers from the National Railway Museum. Historic background In the early years of colonial South Australia, the colonists saw themselves as part of the British Empire and external defence as an Imperial responsibility. Communication lines were long and the empire's wars remote. Great Britain had undisputed military predominance and she was expected by all to protect her colonies, even one as distant. For local defence, Governor Gawler raised the first military force in 1840, composed solely of volunteers and known as the South Australian Volunteer Militia Brigade.Brook (1986), p.29. It was granted the \\"Royal\\" title in 1841 but the brigade had all but ceased to exist a year later. The colony obtained its first artillery in 1847 with the arrival of six field guns of various types.Brook (1986), p.30. Tensions between Britain and the Russian Empire in the 1850s, as starkly demonstrated by the Crimean War, along with Australia- wide moves towards self-government caused a reassessment of the colony's defence posture. The various colonies regarded themselves as possible targets for the Russian Pacific Fleet, then based in Siberia. In 1854, Governor Henry Young appointed a commission under Boyle Travers Finniss to report on the defence of the colony, in case of war. Boyle's report recommended leaving strategic defence in the hands of the Imperial Navy, though South Australia was to purchase a 400-ton naval vessel. Local defence was to be largely handled by the existing small Imperial garrison and local colonial force, supported by the artillery obtained in 1847.NPWS (1988), p.51. When the Crimean War ended in 1856, the danger passed and the perceived need for expensive defence preparations with it. For many years nothing substantive came about from debate on defence of the colony.FGHA (2000), p.5. Over time there formed a consensus favouring Semaphore for fixed defences or fortification; a strategy also argued by the government established Hart Commission in 1858. Raiders were seen as unlikely to force the shallows of the Port River but instead were expected to stand off Semaphore, shell the port and use their guns to support landings. The Hart Report recommended building of martello towers at Semaphore and Glenelg, the first report to recommend permanent fortification at Semaphore, though none were built mainly due to the cost.NPWS (1988), p.52. The volunteer military force was revived in 1859, with new and modern arms for the infantry, cavalry and artillery. Though there was a few years of enthusiasm and a restructuring in 1866, by 1870 the force was virtually disbanded. In that year also, British troops were withdrawn from the other Australian colonies; none were by then stationed in South Australia.Jobson (1997), p.14. With no definitive defence policy, in 1864 the government had sought advice from Captain Parkin of HMS Falcon and Commodore Sir William Wiseman commander of the Australian station; both visiting British naval officers. They both recommended fixed fortifications for the coast supported by gunboats. Sir Wiseman's report particularly recommended construction of forts at Semaphore, Port Creek's entrance and one midway between. In 1864 a story circulated, supported by press speculation, that there was a danger of the Russian fleet attacking Melbourne should Russia and Britain find themselves at war. The South Australian Register produced an editorial decrying the states lack of defences. Within days ¬£20,000 (A$4.14 million in 2005)Currency converted using relative rate of 85.08989 between January 1864 and 2005 for the Pound Stirling from: Converted to Australian Dollars at $1=¬£0.4112 from Australian Reserve Bank published spot rate for January 2005 was provided by the government for defence, an amount then seen as insufficient for significant preparation. The danger passed without any lasting defence action except the government's in- principle adoption of Sir Wiseman's recommendations. To curtail costs only the Semaphore fort was to be built initially, as it was considered the most critical. Site preparation begun and two guns were purchased, but escalating cost estimates caused the plan to be abandoned by 1868.NPWS (1988), p.53. During the early 1870s South Australia's defence was solely dependent on the volunteer military, and a few artillery pieces purchased during earlier war scares. British troops had been withdrawn from the Australian colonies in 1870, leaving the state dependent on its own military resources.FGHA (2000), p.2. In a report to the government in 1866, Colonel Freeling and Major Peter Scratchley recommended establishment of a permanent military force. In 1876 the South Australian government, along with those from New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland requested from the War Office that Major General Sir William Jervois, a noted coastal fortification expert, be appointed to advise on defence needs. He arrived in Sydney in mid-1877 with then Lieutenant Colonel Scratchley. The 1877 report, delivered after he became South Australian Governor, called for three batteries, at Largs Bay, Semaphore and Glenelg, connected by a military road and supported by field gun emplacements, naval elements and mobile forces. He determined that South Australia's most probable defence risk was an attack by up to two ships rather than a larger force, and this formed the basis of the final fortification design. His report called for Military Road to be extended to Marino, an electro-contact torpedo station be established on Torrens Island and that a gun boat be provided.NPWS (1988), p.55. In November 1878 the government passed the Military Forces Act, which provided for the raising of a permanent military force and reserve. Two volunteer reserve rifle companies were formed in 1878 and a permanent artillery unit in 1882. At this time Semaphore, with its jetty built in 1860, was the state's main entry point for passengers and mail. It had a signal station (built 1872) and a time ball tower (built 1875). Semaphore remained of great maritime significance for the state until the 1880s.NPWS (1988), p.50. When the decision was made to build the fort, in 1878, the state's population had reached approximately 250,000. Settlement extended beyond Port Augusta, though Adelaide remained the dominant feature in the economy partly due to the layout of the rail network. At this point Adelaide had a population of over 30,000. Port Adelaide was the main port for South Australia, with over 1000 ships visiting each year, and a local population of over 2,500.NPWS (1988), p.49. Foundation Scratchley had inspected the proposed South Australian fort sites, and Jervois and Scratchley were both responsible for the final fort design and location.Hastings (1986), p.178. The first fort was erected to guard both the entrance to Port Adelaide and the anchorage at Semaphore.NPWS (1988), p.III. It was built on sandhills near Glanville Hall at Semaphore, on a promontory called \\"Point Malcom\\"‚Äîa name that is now used for an adjacent reserve. The site was chosen so as to best guard shipping sailing to both the Port River and the Outer Harbour; and a second northern fort was to protect the entrance to Port River itself. At the time of its construction it was seen as a defence against foreign threats, mainly Russian. Scratchley had offered to design the battery, the offer accepted by Cabinet in January 1878, and he was primarily responsible for the design of both Fort Glanville and Fort Largs. The plans were drawn by Alexander Bain Moncrieff of the South Australian Engineer-in-Chief's Department, supervised by Scratchley in his Melbourne headquarters. Moncrieff, at Scratchley's suggestion, was later to supervise the fort's construction. Plans for both batteries were completed in June 1878, tenders called for in July and the contract for Fort Glanville awarded in August to John Robb of Kapunda, South Australia for the sum of ¬£15,893 12s 7d. Construction began in 1878 and though completed by 1882 the fort was operational in 1880.NPWS (1988), p.10. Changes were made to the design during construction. Some forced by armament changes and others made to ensure additional security, including a rear-defence wall and connecting road from Military Road.NPWS (1988), p.56. By January 1880 two guns were in place and the fort opened later the same year with an extensive opening ceremony on 2 October. In addition to parades, a small target was moored offshore and fired on by all guns. A total of sixteen shots were fired during which one of the ten inch guns proved faulty. Only one ranging shot was fired and the shots were estimated to land from on-target to 350 yards short. The fort's final cost was approximately ¬£36,000 (A$7.05Currency converted using relative rate of 80.56383 between January 1882 and 2005 for the Pound Stirling from: Converted to Australian Dollars at $1=¬£0.4112 from Australian Reserve Bank published spot rate for January 2005 million in 2005) consisting of ¬£23,600 for physical structures and the remainder for armament and fittings. At the time of its construction it was at the forefront of such fortification design, and was considered state of the art. When first conceived, it was known as the Semaphore Battery, later changed to South Battery and then Fort Glanville by the opening ceremony.Hastings (1986), p.179. The name Glanville came from nearby Glanville Hall, residence of John Hart (1809‚Äì1873) thrice Premier of South Australia.O'Neill (1972), pp.355‚Äì356. Hart had named the house after his mother's maiden name (Mary Glanville). Personnel Joseph Maria Gordon in 1921 For the eighteen months after its opening, the fort was manned by B company of the South Australian Volunteer Artillery but only on weekends. This changed in mid-1882 when South Australia's first permanent military force was formed.FGHA (2000), p.3. The fort became the headquarters for the South Australian Permanent Military Force, then the state's entire standing army of one officer and eighteen other ranks.FGHA (2000), p.6. Some of the unit was stationed at nearby Fort Largs from 1886; and, by 1889 the unit had grown to one officer and 45 other ranks.NPWS (1988), p.54. This force grew to 53 of all ranks by 1892 and was by then known as the Permanent Artillery. The unit trained 27 more non-commissioned officers and men who were sent to man the King George Sound batteries near Albany, Western Australia. Though some of the gunners served in the Second Boer War, the unit itself never saw action. Fort Glanville's section was called out in 1890, marching to assist the police with a waterside worker's strike in Port Adelaide. In this case no shots were fired and the strikers did not confront the police or troops. Additional defence acts were passed in 1886, 1890 and 1895 but, until defence passed into federal hands after 1901, the state's permanent military force was composed solely of artillery. Shortly after the federation of Australia, a regiment of the Royal Australian Artillery (RAA) was formed and what had been the Permanent Artillery became No.10 company RAA. The fort was manned to an extent during World War I, with one non-commissioned officer and 11 gunners stationed as of November 1914. Military reports and orders show the fort manned to at least mid-1918, though at this point it is doubtful if the guns were fit to engage targets. There is little in the way of surviving personnel records from the fort's active time.Hastings (1986), p.180. They may have either been destroyed or transferred to Melbourne after federation. The fort's record book shows it manned by a section of either the Royal Australian Artillery or B Company of the militia garrison artillery. For the time covered by the book, strength varied from 56 to 108 men of all ranks.Hastings (1986), p.182. Two figures who served at the fort are remembered for their impact outside its operation: *Battery Sergeant Major Charles Moritz, who initially joined the volunteer artillery and was the Permanent Artillery's first recruit. * Joseph Maria Gordon (1856‚Äì1929), the fort's first commander and later military commandant for South Australia. Gordon retired in 1914 as Chief of the General Staff, Australian Military Forces. Structure Fort Glanville entrance via Queen Elizabeth II walk The fort is designed as a defensible battery, rather than a defensive strongpoint. The faces of the fort join to form a half-moon shape or lunette. The guns' primary role was to defend Port Adelaide and the Semaphore anchorage rather than the fort itself, and the design reflects this. It was intended to be supported by field artillery, cavalry and infantry for self- defence and to repel landings.FGHA (2000), p.7. While the fort retains its original form, the ditch and glacis (embankment) have been modified and are largely non-existent in some areas. Ground levels have been changed to accommodate paths and a caravan park, and the original western fence no longer exists.NPWS (1988), p.11. The entrance road was constructed from Military Road to the fort's rear gates. Its path is largely followed by the modern Queen Elizabeth II walk, though the former road was slightly to the south. This walk links the conservation park's visitor centre to the fort gates; some of the old road can still be seen close to the gates. What was the muster ground is partly taken up by the caravan and camping park and a car park. It was levelled and filled in the 1950s for this use. What remains of this ground, north of the caravan park, was returned to its 1880s profile in 1993 funded by a Federal Government grant. In the 19th century, the muster ground was used for training of the Volunteer Military Force including artillery, who camped on the site. As designed the fort's rear was protected with a wooden palisade or stockade. In 1881 a masonry wall was added, greatly strengthening defence. Most of the stockade was reconstructed in the 1970s; some of the original wooden structure is visible in the fort's north. =Fortification= Manning Parade, terreplein, gun emplacements and the rear of the rampart The main defensive structure is a revetted lunette shaped earthwork. It has a thick rampart with of concrete and of brick forming a retaining wall for the earth fill.Parsons (1986), p.240. The rampart is covered by natural vegetation and, in both the 19th and 21st century operation, is closed to access to preserve this. The glacis gives extra protection to the fort and was designed to blend the fort into the landscape. It surrounded the fort on the north, south and seaward sides and was made by forming the surrounding sandhills. The side facing the fort‚Äîthe scarp‚Äîis steep and, with the front face of the rampart, forms a wide ditch that can be raked by rifle fire from the caponier or the stockade's sides. The outer face is a gentle slope and is designed to be covered by case shot fired from the fort's 64-pounder guns. The southern glacis section was removed during sand mining and construction of the caravan park, both after World War II. The western glacis is changed, but still visible, and the northern glacis was recreated in 1993‚Äîshowcasing the purpose of the glacis and the function of the caponier. Access to the fort is via double gates at the fort's rear, one each through the stockade and the rear defence wall. Both gates were removed or destroyed over time and the 21st century gates are reconstructions. The formal parade ground or manning parade lies between the rear walls and barracks, and the raised terreplein. It was formerly used for drill training, assembly and formal parades. First gravelled when constructed, it was paved with tar in the 1890s to solve drainage problems. Around the seaward side of the manning parade runs the terreplein. It is a raised crescent shaped level on which the guns platforms sit, and is ascended from the manning parade by ramps and stairs. After numerous proposals the sand hills rear and north of the fort were removed in 1882, improving the fort's land defence and allowing the 64-pounder guns to sweep the Semaphore jetty. This now levelled area was used as a bivouac and exercise area for the colony's volunteer troops. A stable, office, shed and gunner's store were also erected north of the fort. The gunner's shed was damaged by fire in 1895 and replaced further eastward. These buildings did not survive into the 21st century. =Internal rooms= Internal structure of the caponier On either side of the terreplein, wide of the 64-pound guns, are two small rooms known as the expense stores. They were used for ready-to-use ammunition for the adjacent guns, except for armour piercing shells which were stored in the rear-defence wall's archways. Between the 64-pounders and the 10\\" gun positions are two raised observation platforms set into the structure for gun commanders to spot the fall of outgoing shells. Ranging was either performed from here or from a ranging position set in the sand hills to the fort's north. Between the 10\\" guns is a T-shaped loading gallery that draws shells and gunpowder via a hoist system from the magazine below. Either side of the gallery was installed the Armstrong mechanical loading systems for the 10\\" guns. These mechanical systems proved unsuccessful and were removed in the 1890s, though the southern one has been reconstructed. The magazine is accessed from the manning parade and is directly beneath the 10\\" gun loading gallery. Voice pipes and hoists originally installed have been removed but their remains are visible.FGHA (2000), p.8. The caponier (rifle gallery) extends into the ditch between the rampart and glacis from the fort's north west corner. It is connected to the fort via a tunnel, running under the rampart from the manning parade. For blast protection and defensibility the tunnel was built with a dogleg. The caponier has rifle firing ports and was originally protected from direct artillery fire by the glacis. Early plans showed the caponier extending from the fort's south west, and a tunnel linking the magazine and southern guns. =Buildings= 16 pounder being loaded in front of the guardhouse and rear defensive wall. Note the archways formerly used to store 64-pounder ammunition The barracks consists of two levels, with rifle firing holes on all sides. Iron shutters closed on the inside and were locked with wooden beams. In 1885 the verandah facing the manning parade was enclosed with wooden shutters to keep the weather out. These shutters were removed during 20th-century restoration work and the verandah returned to original condition. The roof was at first flat timber overlaid by of lime concrete. This first roof leaked and an iron roof was added in 1885. The first floor of the barracks contains the officer's rooms and troop's barracks room.FGHA (2000), p.9. Its eastern (outer) wall is not flat, incorporating a design feature known as \\"hornwork\\", which opens the field of fire from the rifle holes. Some of the firing holes were bricked in during the 1930s; this has been only partly rectified during restoration. The basement contains the gunner's mess, canteen, No. 1 ancillary store, pantry and officer's kitchen. The canteen sold everyday necessities as well as a few items like biscuits, sweets and tobacco to the stationed troops. Profits from the canteen were used to fund sporting equipment for the garrison. The No.1 ancillary store was used for various pieces of delicate equipment, fuses, friction tubes and rockets. In 1887 an explosion in the room caused a number of injuries, damage to the store and to the above officer's quarters. The barracks room and officer's quarters are connected with a door, probably added in the 1930s as it is not part of the original plans. The barracks room accommodated approximately 20 men. For display purposes it is outfitted as for similar period barracks.FGHA (2000), p.10. A laboratory is built into the rear wall, on the forts southern side. This room is set into the end of the rampart and was used to prepare gunpowder charges. A guardhouse was built at the manning parade's southern end in 1885. It is now used as a duty room for the drill squad during recreation demonstrations but originally was a guard's room and separate cells connected by telephone to Fort Largs. Up to three men appear to have been accommodated in the guard's room. When the fort was converted to use as a caravan park the guard house was converted to an ablution block.FGHA (2000), p.11. A store and ablution block were also built in 1885 between the stockade and rear defence wall. Armament Early plans for the fort's armament were drawn up by Harding Stewart of the British War Office. They called for four rifled muzzle- loading (RML) guns, two mounted in turrets and two behind vertical iron shields. This configuration of siege artillery had not been tried before and the plan was abandoned due to the large expected cost.Hastings (1986), pp.178‚Äì179. Two of the 9 in guns had been in South Australia since c.1868 after a Colonial Government request, but were not used in the eventual fort design. The final Jervois/Scratchley design omitted the turret and iron shields. 64-pounder RML guns were substituted for two of the 9 in guns and 10 in 20 ton RML guns for the remaining two. The 20 ton guns were chosen over the then standard 18 ton gun by Jervois after he saw the plans in England, the decision influenced by the then fully committed nature of the Royal Arsenal. Jervois had originally ordered the 18 ton guns but cancelled the order and changed to the Armstrong 20 ton when the arsenal was unable fulfil the order. He also ordered Armstrong's mechanical loading and protected barbette system for the 20 ton guns. This original battery of four heavy guns remains in place at the fort.FGHA (2000), p.12. =10 inch RML guns= 10 inch 20 ton RML gun on a reconstructed carriage. Barbette protected loading system to the right The fort's main armament were the two RML 10 inch 20 ton guns‚ÄîNumbers 3470 and 3472. They were manufactured in 1879 by WG Armstrong and Company and originally used the Armstrong protected barbette loading system. They were made to the 1878 pattern and supplied on traversing slides. The guns have a calibre, a range of with a muzzle velocity of and are capable of penetrating of iron at . They fire projectiles using a gunpowder cartridge. Though they were insufficient against contemporary battleships, they were seen as adequate for the light cruisers that the fort was expected to face. The carriages weighed and moved on semi-circular traverses. The guns were loaded either manually‚Äîusing the Woolwich (derrick) system‚Äîor via the Armstrong mechanical loader. The Armstrong system enabled loading of the guns from behind the protection of the rampart whereas the manual system required at least two crew to be exposed on the rampart's top. Despite this the guns were manually loaded for most of their operational life as the Armstrong cable drive was faulty and too difficult to maintain. The guns had a 14-man crew and loading took about 2 minutes, a rate of fire that was only slightly faster using the Armstrong equipment. By 1902 the guns had together fired 219 rounds, though not all at full charge with the records showing only 125 effective full charges. The platforms and traverses were scrapped in 1937 but the gun barrels were uneconomic to cut up and were left in place. One gun platform and its equipment was rebuilt in 1997 using money raised by Fort Glanville Historical Association volunteers working at the Australian Grand Prix. =64 pounder RML guns= 64-pounder gun on its firing platform In the flank barbettes are mounted two mark III RML 64 pounder 64 cwt guns, numbers 462 and 463. They are rifled muzzle-loading heavy guns weighing with a calibre steel barrel. They were made to the model's 1867 pattern by the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, England in 1872.NPWS (1988), p.57. Their intended use was to protect the flanks and approaches to the fort. These smaller guns use an charge of gunpowder to send a projectile up to . There are iron rings fixed in the rampart wall that indicate traversing gun carriages were intended to be mounted, though this never eventuated. The guns were supplied with siege over-bank carriages. The lower carriage sections are the type made for the guns when used as field pieces and the upper sections are brackets that raise the guns to the over- bank firing position. In this particular configuration the two guns are thought to be the last in the world.FGHA (2000), p.13. By the end of their active use in 1902 together they had fired 1540 rounds in practice, though not all at full power as they are recorded as firing under 300 effective full charges.NPWS (1988), p.57. By then the wheels were significantly rotted and the ammunition limbers had become unserviceable. Less wheels, the guns were removed from the fort in 1909; Adelaide's city council then set them in Brougham Gardens, North Adelaide.FGHA (2000), p.4.Hastings (1986), p.184. Both were returned to the fort in 1976 and remounted on restored carriages of the original design. They are the only two guns of their type remaining in Australia.NPWS (1988), p.9. The southern gun (Number 463) fired three blank charges in 1980 to mark the centenary of the first firing at the fort. This same gun is fired regularly by the volunteers of the Fort Glanville Historical Association (FGHA). Both types of heavy guns used where the only ones of their specific series and type to come to Australia.NPWS (1988), p.58. Though they were never fired in anger, the battery is only above mean sea level which would have limited the accuracy of the mark III depression rangefinders used. =Other weaponry= Prior to 1895 two breech-loading guns had been imported for use in small boats. This use was rejected by military authorities and the guns sat unused. In 1895 the South Australian Defence Committee proposed that the guns be mounted at Fort Glanville, replacing the 64-pounders whose siege carriages were then unfit for service. This proposal would have greatly extended the useful life of the fort, at little cost. The two military branches, army and navy, could not reach agreement and the proposal was abandoned by 1897. The gun's eventual fate is unknown, though a gun found in the Port River later indicates they may have been dumped. Gun emplacements were made, about a mile apart south of the fort, for six 16-pounder field guns to provide close defence in case of an attempted beach landing. From 1890 the fort was equipped with moveable armament. It received an 1867 Whitworth 12-pounder RML field gun and a 5-barrel 0.45\\" Martini-henry cartridge firing Nordenfelt gun. The 12-pounder had fired 222 effective full charges by 1902; at which time both weapons were obsolete and their eventual fate is unknown. A 32-pounder smoothbore gun on a stepped wooden carriage was purchased in 1878. Manufactured by the Royal Arsenal in 1806, it was the familiar \\"ships cannon\\" and came to South Australia with two other identical guns. By 1902 no ammunition was held for it and it was listed as for instruction only. The gun was probably destroyed in the 1930s‚Äîcertainly by the end of the 1940s‚Äî with pieces of such a gun found on site in 1983. 2-pounder RML Whitworth mountain gun In the late 20th century the fort acquired three 16-pounder RML mark I field guns. They were formerly used by A battery, South Australian Volunteer Artillery from 1880 until 1901. Gun number 288 is complete and used for blank firings by the Historical Association. Also acquired is a 2-pounder RML Whitworth mountain gun made in 1867. It was also used by A Battery, subsequently by Fort Largs as a signal gun. It is one of only two of this type known to exist, the other in the United Kingdom. The visitors centre has two 9-pounder brass smoothbore field guns made by H&C; King in 1819. They arrived in South Australia in 1857 and were used for practice shoots near the fort c.1860; one is known to have been on the manning parade in 1890 though its use is unknown. They later became saluting guns at Fort Largs, moving by 1919 to near the Jervois Wing of the State Library of South Australia. The Art Gallery of South Australia saved them from a 1941 wartime scrap drive and mounted them on reproduction naval carriages in front of Government House in 1962. The gallery took them back in late 1977 and transferred them to the History Trust of South Australia in 1988. The History Trust has loaned them to Fort Glanville for display. Outside the visitor's centre is a breech-loading Armstrong gun (No.4242) that was made in 1884 and used in Victoria. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) brought it to the state in 1966 for research, subsequently moving it to Perry Engineering at Mile End. In 1984 the CSIRO donated the gun to the park. Defence significance Work began in 1882 on Fort Glanville's northern sister Fort Largs‚Äîthen known as the Port Adelaide battery‚Äîto the same specification as Fort Glanville; its barracks and rear defence wall were finished in 1885. Though guns had already been purchased specially, plans for the third fort at Glenelg were not proceeded with. South Australia was experiencing a depression in 1886 and that coupled with a report by General James Bevan Edwards scuttled plans for the third coastal fort. As early as 1888 the emphasis for defence of the Adelaide coast had already shifted to Fort Largs; a fact cited as part of the reason for abandonment of the Glenelg fortifications. From this point Fort Glanville's significance declined rapidly. Fort Largs was equipped in 1889 with two 6 inch breech-loading disappearing guns which outranged Glanville's armament. The decline was also linked to changes in Port Adelaide's maritime facilities and the consequent northward movement of anchored and berthed vessels. During the 1880s the Port River was deepened enabling large ships to sail up and berth, rather than the former practice of anchoring off-shore.NPWS (1988), p.59. The fort remained as headquarters of South Australia's permanent military force until the 1890sNPWS (1988), p.7. and as late as 1895 there were still plans to upgrade the 64-pounder armament, though without result. By 1901 the fort was manned on a caretaker basis only and no permanent forces were stationed. The Federal Government assumed responsibility for South Australian defence in 1903 and took over the fort. Though Glanville by then had no significant defence role, the state received ¬£14,739 in compensation. From that point its significance was not defence related but as the first and best preserved 19th-century fortification in South Australia. 20th century At Federation in 1901 South Australia's defences became a federal responsibility. Though both infantry and artillery units were housed at the site on occasion, by 1903 there was no longer a permanent military presence at the fort. For most of the 20th century the site was neglected and largely vacated. It did attract some usage though not always of a military nature. During World War I it was partly revived for a former use, with ammunition stored on site. During the same period however the military used it as a detention barracks. Some or all of the fort was leased for private accommodation during the great depression. During the 1930s the magazine was again used, this time to store small arms ammunition. From June 1931 until the beginning of World War II the site housed a Sea Scout detachment, and was used as a district camp-site for the Boy Scouts. The Department of Defence decided in 1937 that much of the equipment and fittings at the fort were surplus to requirements. Consequent to this the mountings and carriages for the 10 inch guns were removed and sold as scrap; though effort was made to scrap the barrels it proved uneconomic and they were left in place. In an unusual turn of events, the fort briefly housed refugees. Twenty- nine islanders from the Maldives were rescued from their sinking dhow by a ship bound for Wallaroo. They stayed at the fort for a week in 1938, before repatriation could be arranged. During World War II the fort again attracted military related use. During 1944 the Proof and Experimental Establishment at Port Wakefield made use of the site to proof ordnance QF 6 pounder anti-tank guns manufactured at General Motors Holden in Woodville. The fort was also used as a residence again, with at least two families reported as living in the under-ground sections during the war. After the war, the State Government negotiated with its federal counterpart to gain control of Fort Glanville. This eventuated in the 1951 sale of the site, which was subsequently administered by the State Tourist Department as a caravan and camping park. The park occupied the muster ground outside the fort and the fort's barracks building was used as a manager's residence. The caravan park has had various managers since establishment: Until 1981 it was managed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), by Woodville Council until 1986 and subsequently by a private operator under a long-term lease.NPWS (1988), p.13. A significant change in the fort's conservation and preservation outlook was its declaration as a Historic Relic under the Aboriginal and Historic Relics Preservation Act 1965 on 25 May 1972. Up to then there had been growing awareness of the significance of the site in terms of the state's colonial heritage. Control of the park was moved to the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), and the fort and surrounds became designated as Fort Glanville Conservation Park. The National Estate Grants Program provided funds in 1975 for conservation work; NPWS began this work in the same year and the caravan park boundary was moved southwards. Though the site had long been neglected, there was minimal permanent damage to its structure. During the 1970s reconstruction, much of the stockade was replaced. The replaced timbers are visibly different as they have shrunk significantly with large gaps that are not evident in the original timber.NPWS (1988), p.89. Adelaide City Council agreed to return the 64-pounder guns and new wheels were made; replacing those rotted over half a century before. In a ceremony on 2 October 1980, the 100th anniversary of the guns first firing, one of the 64-pounders was fired again; later a commemoration plaque was added to the fort's flagpole's base. Shortly after this firing the Fort Glanville Historical Association was formed, and was incorporated in 1981. Fort Glanville was opened for public visitation in 1981. As part of South Australia's sesquicentenary, the South Australia Jubilee 150 board granted $250,000 for work on the fort, allowing construction of a visitor centre. Queen Elizabeth II visited and inspected the site, and newly constructed visitor centre, for almost an hour on 13 March 1986. For the visit the historical association demonstrated firing of both the 64 and 2 pounder cannons. The visitor centre was officially opened one month after this visit.NPWS (1988), p.3. Governor Dame Roma Mitchell named the old road \\"Queen Elizabeth II Walk\\" in a March 1991 ceremony, commemorating the 5th anniversary of the queen's visit. Considerable subsequent restoration work has been completed on the fort, including the barrack's interior. The portion of the muster ground that is not within the caravan park was returned to its original level in 1993. Park and fort today Fort Glanville Conservation Park is one of South Australia's most important heritage sites. It is the premier site in the state, and possibly Australia, for showcasing colonial era defences and fortifications. The fort is listed on both the South Australian Heritage Register, the former Register of the National Estate and the National Trust's classified list. It is considered significant, in national historical military terms, for its association with Jervois and Scratchley; both leading British defence experts who influenced Australian defence thinking in the late 19th century. The fort was very well constructed with high quality materials; facts that have been noted as contributing to its preservation.NPWS (1988), p.15. The fort is largely intact and in original condition and is, along with Bluff Battery in Hobart, the best preserved Jervois-Scratchley designed fort in Australia. It is the only Australian colonial fort to still have all of its original armament, and the only to have a regular living history program. Its companion Fort Largs does survive but in greatly modified condition, converted for use as the South Australia Police academy. The fort retains its original armament; armament that is both rare in Australia and worldwide. The conservation park is in the suburb of Semaphore Park at the southern end of the Lefevre Peninsula. It covers approximately and is bounded by Bower and Military roads, the Point Malcolm Reserve and Semaphore beach. The land is entirely crown land and is administered by the DEW. It is divided into roughly two-halves with the northern containing the fort and the southern half containing a caravan park. While it is managed by the DEW, the Fort Glanville Consultative Committee and Fort Glanville Historical Association are heavily involved. The committee is appointed by the Minister for Environment and Planning and acts to advise the Minister and liaise with the community.NPWS (1988), p.1. As of 1988, the fort hosted approximately 7,000 visitors annually,NPWS (1988), p.14 and is used as an event venue including the annual City of Charles Sturt citizenship ceremony. The historical association is an incorporated body of volunteers who use the fort under licence from the Minister. The association operate the fort and visitor centre, holding monthly public open days at which the history of the fort is recreated; this includes drill demonstrations and firing of the fort's weapons. The association maintain static displays of the fort's active period and sell souvenirs. The association's goal is to have the site open as a fully operational fort for interpretation, tourism and education. The volunteers are involved with recreation, living history and ceremonial work outside the fort. They act as guards of honour at some Government House functions and attended the restoration opening of the Albany, Western Australia fort, and the annual re- enactment of the Battle of Waterloo in Keyneton, Victoria. The fort has living history displays, including the barracks laid out and furnished in period detail. The visitor centre has displays showing the development of South Australia's colonial defence from 1836 and artifacts found on site during restorations. Turntable of Semaphore and Fort Glanville Tourist Railway Connecting the fort to Semaphore jetty is the Semaphore and Fort Glanville Tourist Railway, a gauge steam train operated by volunteers from the National Railway Museum. The railway opened in December 1992 and, as of 2002, carried over 16,000 passengers annually.

To reach this goal, the institute publishes studies and discussion papers. It also offers an online handbook on demography and publishes a newsletter. The institute is financed by contributions, project funds, earnings from the foundation's endowment, and contributions to the endowment. The institute is headed by Reiner Klingholz, who studied chemistry, earning a PhD in molecular biology. Earlier in his career, Reiner Klingholz worked as a journalist for the German weekly Die Zeit and the bi-annual magazine Geo Wissen.  History  The Berlin Institute for Population and Development was founded in 2000 by Marlene von Reichenbach and has since been recognised as a foundation (non-profit organisation). The institute has no political or religious affiliations. During the initial years of its existence, the institute received general support from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. Today it has a broad range of sponsors, which are listed on the institute's website. Among the more prominent are the Robert Bosch Foundation, the Erste Foundation, and the Software AG Foundation.  Publications  The Demographic State of the Nation ‚Äì How Sustainable Are Germany‚Äôs Regions? (2006) describes demographic change in Germany and its expected impact on Germany's 439 German regions and municipalities. Based on a set of 22 demographic, economic, social, and educational indicators, the authors of the study come up with an assessment of the sustainability of each of the 439 units covered. Aside from identifying general trends such as an ageing and dwindling population, the study sheds light on some important patterns of internal migration in Germany. The urban regions surrounding big cities like Berlin, Munich and Hamburg, alongside other economically prosperous regions, turn out to be prime destinations for internal migrants. Male Emergency (2007) analyses the causes and consequences of young women leaving the states of eastern Germany: the regions are becoming poorer ‚Äì socially, economically and demographically. A portion of the men who have stayed behind now constitute a new underclass. The authors of the study Male Emergency see educational advancement as the main reason for the disproportionate outward migration of young women. They strongly recommend setting up programmes aimed at boosting the motivation and educational qualifications of young males who have fallen behind. Unintentionally Childless (2007) looks into the question of how reproductive medicine can contribute to mitigating the demographic crisis in Germany. The study concludes that aside from modern family policies and increased efforts to combat the causes of biological-medical infertility, medicine could help couples, whose wish for children has gone unfulfilled, thus contributing, to a certain extent, to raising birth rates. Talents, Technology and Tolerance (2007) examines, on the basis of Richard Florida‚Äôs theory of the creative class, the prospects of Germany's regions in a future knowledge-based society. The theory postulates that a successful economy requires a society in which talent, technology and tolerance can all flourish equally. Measured according to the TTT criteria, Berlin possesses the greatest creative potential among the German states, followed by Hamburg and Baden-W√ºrttemberg. By comparison, the eastern German states of Brandenburg, Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania lag far behind. Emancipation or child benefits? (2008) compares the social conditions for different fertility rates in the nations of western Europe based on an array of socioeconomic indicators. It shows clearly that the traditionally negative correlation between wealth and social development on the one hand and fertility on the other no longer holds once a society has reached a certain level of development. Today more children are born in the countries with the most advanced social systems in regard to gender equality. Based on this result, we propose to discuss the problem of low-fertility countries from a different point of view. Neither child benefits nor other sources of financial aid appear to motivate people in modern industrial societies to have more children. What is far more crucial is equality of men and women in society. Europe‚Äôs Demographic Future (2008) is the institute's first major study that has been translated fully into English. The study compares and assesses the various regions of the EU-27 countries as well as Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, as well as a number of selected eastern European countries on the basis of 24 demographic, economic, social, and environmental indicators. The study shows the very different ways in which individual countries are affected by and deal with demographic challenges. The authors of the study map out the ways in which mutual learning can help European countries in dealing with concrete challenges facing them. Unutilised Potentials ‚Äì On the Current State of Integration in Germany (2009) is dedicated to the 15 million persons in Germany that have a migration background. In order to assess the integration performance of eight different immigrant groups, the institute has developed an Integration Measurement Index (IMI), which is based on 20 indicators for assimilation, education, working life, and social security. The results of the study show that the roughly two million persons stemming from other EU-25 countries (without southern Europe) are best integrated. On the other hand, migrants from Turkey in particular tend to show massive integration deficits. Looked at in regional terms, integration tends generally to work out better in places where there is demand in the labour market for large numbers of highly qualified workers.

He was unanimously elected Mayor of Albany three times and served as the 37th Mayor of the city. Early life and family John Townsend was born at the Sterling Iron Works in Orange County on June 14, 1783 the son of Henry Townsend and Mary (Bennett) Townsend. He was descended from Henry Townsend one of the founders of Oyster Bay, New York in the mid 17th century. Career =Iron Business= Townsend moved to Albany, New York in 1802 to work for his brother Isaiah who ran a successful iron and foundry business in the city called \\"I & J Townsend\\" The firm was involved in the buying and selling of iron and produced in their foundry machine castings and railcar wheels. Townsend took over the business when his brother died in 1838. Townsend's nephew, Franklin Townsend joined the business as a young man in 1849. Upon the John Townsend's death Franklin took over and continued the business. The business, which was eventually known as the \\"Townsend Furnace\\" was located at Broadway, Rensselaer and Mulberry streets fronting upon the Hudson River for 180 feet and the brick building was four stories high. =Political career= Townsend was a member of the Whig Party. Townsend was mayor of the City of Albany in 1829, 1830, and 1832. He was elected to his first term by unanimous vote of the city council on February 9, 1829 upon the resignation of Mayor Charles E. Dudley who took office as US Senator for New York. He was reelected to a second term on December 21, 1829 by unanimous vote of the council and began his term on January 1, 1830. Townsend lost the council election on December 29, 1830, by a vote of 9 to 12 to Francis Bloodgood, who then went on to serve as 38th mayor of the city. He was, however, reelected to the office at the council vote on December 29, 1831, and regained the office on January 1, 1832. In 1832 an outbreak of cholera occurred in Albany and Townsend was praised for his efforts in combating the disease. On November 20, 1833, the council voted to name a park at the intersection of Washington Avenue and the Bowery (Central Ave) \\"Townsend Park\\" in honor of the then former mayor. =Commercial interests= At the time of his death, Townsend was president of the Commercial Bank of Albany and acting president of the Albany Insurance Company. He was on the board of: * Water Commissioners * Albany Exchange Company * Albany Savings Bank * Albany Pier Company * Syracuse Coarse Salt Company * Watervliet Turnpike Company Personal life Townsend married on July 7, 1810 Abby Spencer, daughter of Ambrose Spencer (1765-1848) and Laura (Canfield) Spencer. Ambrose held a number of important government positions in the City of Albany and in New York State, including 35th Mayor of Albany (from 1824‚Äì1826), New York State Attorney General (from 1802‚Äì1804), and Chief Justice of the New York State Supreme Court (from 1819‚Äì1823). Laura Spencer's brother, John Canfield Spencer (1788‚Äì1855) served as Secretary of War under President John Tyler.

Biography Ruud van Empel was born in Breda in 1958. He studied at the Academie voor Beeldende Kunst St. Joost (St Joost Academy of Art) in Breda in the 1970s, and began making independently produced videotapes in the eighties. He moved to Amsterdam in the late eighties to work on his career as a visual artist. His first photographic series were The Office (1995-2001), Study for Women (1999-2002) and Study in Green (2003). The Groninger Museum presented his first solo exhibition in 1999. He made his international breakthrough with his series World-Moon-Venus, which was shown in the George Eastman House in Rochester, New York State. Work Until mid-1995, Van Empel‚Äôs art was primarily generated by a process of assembling analogue photographic images. At that point, he exchanged this traditional collage technique ‚Äì cutting, pasting and retouching in the darkroom ‚Äì for image processing on the computer, working in an idea-driven manner. The first series created with this method was The Office (1995). In a technical sense, The Office displays a handicraft-like quality, missing the perfectionist character of his later work. Nevertheless, Van Empel clearly demonstrated that his approach differed from other disciplines such as staged photography. In certain aspects, The Office offered a somewhat surrealistic character and referred to photomontages from the 1920s in terms of style and design. On the basis of this art-historical reference, Van Empel created a new genre within photography ‚Äì without a ready-to-wear label. The artist himself speaks of the ‚Äòconstruction of a photographic image‚Äô. Although he does make use of pure photomontage ‚Äì he never applies so-called morphing techniques ‚Äì the final result strives for content aligned to natural reality rather than to surrealism. The artificiality is visible but the final image is a convincing, autonomous reality. As a consequence, the work does not seem grotesque or absurd but could theoretically actually appear in reality. In that respect, Van Empel‚Äôs images are independent. They do not manifest themselves as ‚Äòsymbolic‚Äô and have been stripped of all ‚Äòpictorial‚Äô associations. He does not deploy photography as a substitute for painting but rather uses it as an independent form of depiction. Every image consists of photographic sources that are digitally assembled on the computer. The work of Ruud van Empel exists by grace of the camera by means of which he records his building blocks. After The Office, he created the Study for Women series, which comprises a number of female portraits that refer to the magic realism art movement. In this series, produced in the period 2000-2002, he displayed the form language with which he would soon gain worldwide recognition. The Study in Green series from 2003-2004, the Untitled series from 2004, and the three closely related series World, Moon and Venus, which he began in 2005, represented Van Empel‚Äôs true international breakthrough. Curator Deborah Klochko invited him to participate in the exhibition entitled Picturing Eden in the George Eastman House. In the book Ruud van Empel Photoworks 1995-2010, she wrote: ‚ÄòVan Empel‚Äôs virtuosity lies in his capacity to combine in photography the kind of ideas anchored in painting (historical references, the power of a glimpse, use of colour) and cinema (structure with multiple images and the power of a narrative), and to do so on a large scale. To understand his work you must ask yourself: ‚ÄòIs it science or art? Is it real or imaginary? Is innocence or decadence?‚Äô Particularly the World series, which explores the theme of innocence, made a deep impression. These works were inspired by photos taken by his father. Van Empel placed neatly dressed, black boys and girls in paradisical settings of unspoiled, non-existent natural surroundings. Great interest in and appreciation of this series are expressed worldwide to this day. The breakthrough in America also led to renewed attention in Dutch museums. Van Empel has had solo exhibitions in Museum Het Valkhof in Nijmegen, the Groninger Museum and the NoordBrabants Museum in ‚Äôs-Hertogenbosch. Since the international recognition of his work gave Van Empel the status of an artist with an own independent form language, he has progressively extended his oeuvre with the Theatre series from 2010-2013, and Souvenir, which provided a charged picture of his youth in Breda. This series was purchased by the NoordBrabants Museum. A typical feature of the work of Ruud van Empel is the composition of a perfected and idealized representation right down to the finest details. But this always has a darker side, albeit not always evident. Ruud Schenk, curator of the Groninger Museum, wrote about that aspect with reference to the Study for Women series (2000-2002): ‚ÄòAs a spectator you feel that there is something not quite right about the depiction of the women: they are not completely lifelike, but tend to be a mixture of real women and window dummies. This generates a certain discomfort, an uneasiness that touches upon what was described as 'das Unheimliche' (the uncanny) at the beginning of the 20th century.‚Äô Although the photographic images seem to capture an epoch, you can hardly assign a date to any of them. This timeless element of Van Empel‚Äôs work has taken on a different significance in his recent work, as he deals with themes such as transience and Vanity in his Still Life series from 2014, and also portrays older people as in the portrait of an older woman in the Sunday series (2012), or in the Nude series (2014), in which he questions the pose of the model and the aesthetics of nudity. In the Solo Work series, on which Van Empel has been working since 2011, he consistently deals with just one topic in an isolated work. The moral, ethical and aesthetic dilemmas of society and art are presented to us in a photographic form language. The significance of these is shown in the countless publications and international exhibitions of this work, not only in institutions specialized in photography but also in renowned museums for modern visual art.

It is a mid-18th- century, two-story stone structure with a basement. All rooms have corner fireplaces. It was frequently visited by George Washington between the years 1755 and 1798, when it was owned and operated as an inn and tavern by Colonel John Rodgers (1728‚Äì1791). He was the father of John Rodgers (1772‚Äì1838), U.S. naval officer. During the 1880s the house was divided into two halves, east and west. Rodgers Tavern was listed on the National Register of Historic Places during 1972.  Construction  Rodgers Tavern, formerly known as Stevenson's Tavern, is an 18th-century historical tavern in Cecil County.http://www.perryvillemd.org/about-perryville/pages/rodgers-tavern The tavern is located on 259 Broad Street, Perryville MD, 21903 and is originally known as the Ferry House due to the fact that it was built next to a ferry in 1695. The original owner of the tavern was William Stevenson.http://www.hmdb.org/Marker.asp?Marker=69167 There were other tavern keepers in later years until 1886 when the use of bridges and railroads began to replace the use of ferries and carriages, which caused the route that the tavern was on to decrease in popularity and no longer needed.http://www2.hsp.org/collections/manuscripts/r/rodgers1208.htm The Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington Railroad bought the property as the tavern went into a period of neglect and deterioration. In 1956, the Society for the Preservation of Maryland Antiquities bought the tavern and friends of Rodgers Tavern began to rebuild the property to its former state.http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/stagsere/se1/se5/006000/006400/006468/pdf/msa_se5_6468.pdf In 1956, the Society for the Preservation of Maryland Antiquities bought the tavern and friends of Rodgers Tavern began to rebuild the property to its former state. In 1972, the tavern was entered into the National Register of Historic Places.  Architecture  The architecture for Rodgers Tavern is unique to the 18th century. The tavern has two stories. The exterior of the tavern is made out of stone that displays a fine quality of stone masonry, which gave the building a sense of taste and helped meet the needs of the taverns activities. The facade has 5 openings on each story. The center opening is an entrance to the first story and the basement. The main entrance consists of separate doors. The interior of the tavern is very distinctive as well with windows located on the first and second stories with 6 over 6 sash and wide frames. The East and West gables have two windows at each level and the cornice of the low pitched roof continues on all sides, which create pent eaves on the gables. The main floor has two parlors, one for the public and the other was a small office. The front parlor contains original 18th century paneling. The second floor has 5 chambers that were used mainly by its guests. Each room contains a corner fireplace. The southeast parlor is an original room, which contains raised panel chimney breast, bold cornice, 3 piece chair rail and original windows and door trim. This was the most elaborate design for all the rooms and tradition says that George Washington stayed in the northeast bedroom. In the 1880s, the house was divided into an east wing and a west wing with the original staircase being replaced by two steep enclosed stairs. The attic served as quarters for the guests‚Äô servants, but was roughly finished.  Usage (American Revolution - 1972)  The Rodgers family actively supported the American cause during the American Revolution. Due to its location on the main thoroughfare and the owners‚Äô stalwart patriotism, it became a favorite stopping place for such Revolutionary figures as Washington, Lafayette, Rochambeau, Jefferson, and Madison. In 1775, Colonel John Rodger is known for leaving his post operating the ferry and tavern in order to assemble and lead the 5th Company of the Maryland militia, which later became associated with the Flying Corps, an integral part of the early Revolution.http://www.perryvillemd.org/about-perryville/pages/perryville- history John Rodgers Jr. became known as the ‚ÄúFather of the American Navy‚Äù for his service in the war of 1812 as Commodore of the American Navy. In 1781, just after Rodgers bought the tavern, Washington brought troops through Lower Ferry Crossing where he would later win the battle of Yorktown against Cornwallis. He noted in his diary that he often dined there when traveling from Virginia to Philadelphia. Rodgers Tavern was convenient in its direct location across from Havre de Grace.http://www.cecildaily.com/news/local_news/article_9447e6d0-f2da-54ce-a4a5-96872e5a7fd4.html Washington spent the night thirty times between 1775 and 1798 from his days in the pre-Revolutionary military through his presidency. Following the American Revolution, Rodgers Tavern continued as a well-frequented establishment known for excellent food and entertainment. However, the Lower Susquehanna Route, in which Rodgers Tavern is located on, became less popular with the introduction of bridges and railroads over the now antiquated ferries and carriages. The prominence of the tavern diminished and was no longer needed, but it stayed open until around 1886. Because of its minimal use, the tavern largely deteriorated. It wasn‚Äôt until 1956, when the Society for the Preservation of Maryland Antiquities purchased the building, that a preservation and revitalization effort began to save the tavern. 16 years later, the tavern was finally entered in the National Register of Historic Places.  Recent Renovations (1972 - Present)  In the past decade, the tavern served as a small museum and offices to the town chamber of commerce. Located in the Lower Susquehanna Heritage Area, Rodgers Tavern has received tremendous support for rehabilitation. Since its listing in the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, Rodgers Tavern has been a focus for many restoration projects, such as the Rodgers Tavern Readiness Project. The Rodgers Tavern Readiness Project is facilitated by the Lower Susquehanna Heritage Greenway (LSHG). The LSHG is a non-profit organization whose mission is to stimulate local economic activity by developing a linkage between our natural, historic and cultural resources. In 2008, LSHG received $100,000 from state grants towards the Rodgers Tavern Readiness Project. The scope of the project has been to restore this key historic property to its original uses as a tavern and ferry crossing for educational, recreational and economic development purposes. The overall project consists of three phases which include, 1. Facility stabilization and restoration, 2. Pier and trail construction and 3. Facility readiness. In 2010, LSHG requested $150,000 to ultimately complete the third and final phase of the Rodgers Tavern Readiness Project. According to the Baltimore Sun, the state has awarded LSHG $125,000 to complete the renovations. The grant will pay for interior and exterior repairs. The restoration plans include a new roof, gutters, downspout, interior plaster walls, fresh interior paint, electric work, heating, air conditioning, and a sewage connection to the city. During a recent excavation, artifacts have been found on site that are currently in storage until the reopening of the tavern. These artifacts consisted of antique clothing, furniture, and small trinkets. Perryville History The town of Perryville itself has a rich history that surrounds the unassuming tavern. It was founded in 1608 after Captain John Smith visited following his adventure as the first European explorer to navigate the Susquehanna River. ). It was first settled by Edward Palmer after he was granted a patent for what is now Garrett Island. In the 1600s, Lord Baltimore granted Lord Talbot 31,000 acres of land, including Perryville. The town went through many names before its incorporation in 1882, including ‚ÄúLower Ferry‚Äù in 1695 and ‚ÄúSusquehanna‚Äù in the 1700s. It wasn‚Äôt until the later 1700s that it came to be known as ‚ÄúPerryville‚Äù after John Bateman's wife, Mary Perry.

It is being developed as an international standard by scientists and programmers representing major scientific facilities in Europe, Asia, Australia, and North America in order to facilitate greater cooperation in the analysis and visualization of scientific data. Technically, NeXus is a data model rather than a file format, because it describes how data should be organised and structured within a file and has little to say about how that data is encoded for storage. A NeXus file can be mapped into many different container formats, though the preferred and best supported backend is HDF5. XML is used for demonstration purposes mainly.  Early history and motivation  By the early 1990s, several groups of scientists in the fields of neutron and X-ray science were frustrated that each of the instruments they worked with had a locally defined format for recording experimental data. With various formats, much of the scientists' time was being wasted in the task of writing import readers for processing and analysis programs. As is common, the exact information to be documented from each instrument in a data file evolves and makes compromises based on new features and limitations in the evolving hardware. Many of these formats lacked the generality to extend to the new data to be stored, thus another new format was devised. In such environments, the documentation of each generation of data format is often lacking. Three parallel developments led to the creation of NeXus: * June 1994: Mark K√∂nnecke (Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland) made a proposal using netCDF for the European neutron scattering community while working at the ISIS pulsed neutron facility. * August 1994: Jon Tischler and Mitch Nelson (Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA) proposed an HDF-based format as a standard for data storage at the Advanced Photon Source. * October 1996: Przemek Klosowski (National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA) produced a first draft of the NeXus proposal drawing on ideas from both sources. These scientists proposed methods to store data using a self-describing, extensible format that was already in broad use in other scientific disciplines. Their proposals formed the basis for the current design of the NeXus standard which was developed across a series of workshops organized by Ray Osborn (ANL), attended by representatives of a range of neutron and X-ray facilities. The NeXus API was released in late 1997.  Main features  NeXus is primarily concerned with how data is organised within a file. To achieve this, NeXus provides: * A defined dictionary of terms * A set of data storage objects * A set of technique-specific sub-formats * A support community and democratic guiding authority The NeXus format is composed of \\"Base Class\\" objects that represent various types of hardware and other convenient groupings of information, such as a geometry, or the state of a beam at a given position. These Base Classes provide a dictionary of terms that might be used to describe specific properties in an instance of that class and provide clarity on what a terms means and which specific name should be used for something that might have a number of equivalent choices. The way in which Base Classes are combined is then given by an Application Definition, which describes the hierarchical structure, the minimum set of required information and optional additions for a type of experiment. While the documented NeXus philosophy guides Application Definitions towards a shared structure, there is freedom for an Application Definition to diverge from the others in order to suit the needs of the community it intends to serve. NeXus strongly encourages data files to contain a default dataset that can be easily plotted, and contain a full description of the experiment in meaningful physical terms and thus not require extra knowledge to interpret the file contents. Community The NeXus community typically interact through the NeXus mailing lists, monthly teleconferences and an annual meeting.  Governance  The development of NeXus is overseen by the NeXus International Advisory Committee (NIAC). The NIAC seeks a balanced representation of the international community. Most major neutron, X-ray and muon facilities have appointed delegates. Other facilities and interested parties are invited to join. The NIAC reviews any proposed amendments to the NeXus base classes and application deÔ¨Ånitions, and holds votes to ratify changes. Full meetings of the NIAC are held every 2 years, usually in conjunction with the NOBUGS conferences.

Gert Verner Petersen (19 August 1927 - 1 January 2009) was a journalist and politician who helped found and represent the Socialist People's Party in Denmark. He was born in Nyk√∏bing Falster, Denmark, as the son of the factory worker Karen Rolandsen. He got a high school diploma from Nyk√∏bing Katedralskole in 1945 and studied history at the University of Copenhagen. Political development In 1940 at the age of 13, Gert Petersen was a member of the youth movement of the Nazi National Socialist Workers' Party of Denmark for ten months, as he changed his political views. From 1943, he was an active member of the Danish resistance movement but was eventually captured by the Gestapo in 1944 and incarcerated in the Fr√∏slev Camp until the end of the German occupation of Denmark. Communist Party of Denmark He became a member of the Communist Party of Denmark in 1945. He was among those members who wanted to change the party line to a democratic form of socialism. He took part in this debate through the publication \\"Dialog\\". When the party line was not changed he followed Aksel Larsen out of the Communist Party and became a co-founder of the Socialist People's Party on 15 February 1959. Socialist People's Party He was a member of the party leadership of the party since 1961 and in periods the party's executive committee and its secretariat. He was party chairman in the period 1974 to 1991 where he showed great ability to combine a Marxist analysis with day-to-day politics. Thus his influence was not limited to the Socialist People's Party but reached wide parts of the Danish left wing. =Significance for the Socialist People's Party= Petersen has influenced his party in three ways: I. As a person who made a great effort to formulate the political ideology of popular socialism and demarcate the party from the Social Democrats to the right and the Communist Party of Denmark and differing left-wing groups on the left, especially concerning the relationship between socialism and democracy. He took an unconditional stance for a democratic path to socialism. II. As chairman he represented negotiation instead of confrontation when a minority of the parliamentary group wanted to change the political line to conform more with that of the Social Democrats. III. As a long-standing proponent for the \\"worker's majority strategy\\" which was significant for the policy of the party during the 1980s. A worker's majority is to be understood as a cooperation between the Social Democrats, the Socialist People's Party and the rest of the left wing which were meant to bring about reforms in the direction of socialism. Other After Gert Petersen left parliament, he was an active debater on especially foreign policy and frequently occurred in the debate pages of the newspapers. His membership of the youth wing of the National Socialist Workers' Party of Denmark was first publicly known in 1977, where the controversial author Erik Haaest revealed Petersen's Nazi past. At first Petersen denied his membership among other places in the newspaper BT on 26 August 1977 with the words: \\"It is pure nonsense and pure lies. I have never been a member of the Nazi party.\\" Later Petersen had to admit that the allegations were true. For many years until the middle of the 1980s he claimed to have been a member of the Nazi party as a \\"spy\\". At last he had to admit that he as a boy had been attracted by the social views and F√ºhrer principle of the Nazis. Gert Petersen's relaxed stance on fashion and style was the background for the formation of the \\"Association for the beautification of Gert Petersen\\" - an association which rarely achieved its goals. The association, as well as a parody of the Anthem of the Soviet Union called \\"The Anthem to Gert Petersen\\", can be seen as examples of the humorous elements of the environment in and around the party. Codenamed ZEUS by the KGB, Petersen passed on classified information gleaned from the Danish Foreign Policy Committee. Politician Petersen was a member of parliament for the Socialist People's Party in the following electoral districts: *√òstre Storkreds (November 22, 1966 - January 22, 1968) *Odense Amtskreds (January 23, 1968 - September 20, 1971) *Fyns Amtskreds (September 21, 1971 - February 14, 1977) *√òstre Storkreds (February 15, 1977 - March 19, 1998) He was a member of the European Parliament (1977‚Äì1979) and a member of the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe from 1994.

Staffed by local inhabitants from German- occupied Byelorussia, it had similar functions to those of the German Ordnungspolizei in other occupied territories. The activities of the formation were supervised by defense police departments, local commandants' offices, and garrison commandants. The units consisted of one police officer for every 100 rural inhabitants and one police officer for every 300 urban inhabitants. The OD was in charge of guard duty, and included both stationary and mobile posts plus groups of orderlies. It was subordinate to the defense police leadership. Activities Byelorussian Auxiliary Police participated in civilian massacres across villages on the territory of modern-day Belarus; dubbed the anti-partisan actions.The Nazi Occupation in Belarus (empty page, archived by Wayback) The role of the local policemen was crucial in the totality of procedures, as only they ‚Äì wrote Martin Dean ‚Äì knew the identity of the Jews. Byelorussian Auxiliary Police in Mogilev, March 1943. The German Order Police battalions as well as Einsatzgruppen carried out the first wave of killings. The pacification actions were conducted using experienced Byelorussian auxiliary guards in roundups (as in Homel, Mozyrz, Kalinkowicze, Korma). The Byelorussian police took on a secondary role in the first stage of the killings. The ghettoised Jews were controlled and brutalized before mass executions (as in Dobrusz, Czeczersk, ≈ªytkowicze). After a while the auxiliary police, being locals, not only led the Jews out of the ghettos to places of massacres but also took active part in the shooting actions. Such tactic was successful (without much exertion of force) in places where the destruction of the Jews was carried out in early September, and throughout October and November 1941. In winter 1942, a different tactic was used ‚Äì the killing raids in ≈ª≈Çobin, Petryk√≥w, Streszyn, Czeczersk. The role of the Byelorussian police in the killings became particularly noticeable during the second wave of the ghetto liquidation actions, starting in February‚ÄìMarch 1942. During Operation Cottbus which began on 20 May 1943 in the areas of Begoml, Lepel and Ushachy, a number of Belarusian auxiliary police battalions took part in the mass murder of unarmed civilians (predominantly Jews), along with the SS Special Battalion Dirlewanger and other destruction units.

Some serial rapists target children. The terms sexual predator, repeat rape and multiple offending can also be used to describe the activities of those who commit a number of consecutive rapes, but remain unprosecuted when self-reported in research. Others will commit their assaults in prisons. In some instances, a group of serial rapists will work together. These rapists can have a pattern of behavior that is sometimes used to predict their activities and aid in their arrest and conviction. Serial rapists also differ from one time offenders because \\"serial rapists more often involved kidnapping, verbally and physically threatening the victims, and using or threatening the use of weapons.\\"  Law enforcement  Many times, the evidence that is collected from the physical examinations and testimony of those who were raped is in the possession of numerous law enforcement agencies and may impede the recognition that the rapist has committed the crime over a period of time. Conviction of the rapist can be delayed when victims do not cooperate in the investigation. Evidence can consist of DNA, saliva and fingerprints, hair, vaginal swabs, fingernail scrapings, and bed linens. Those investigating serial rapes often identify the rapist with a 'nickname' before an arrest is made by characterizing the tactics or patterns of the rapes. Serial rapists are more likely to be convicted than a rapist who is known by the victim.James L. LeBeau, Patterns of Stranger and Serial Rape Offending: Factors Distinguishing Apprehended and at Large Offenders, Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, Vol. 78, Issue 2 (Summer 1987). Unlike those convicted for a single case of rape, serial rapists often go unrecognized due to the slow process of analyzing the backlog of rape kits. It may take many years for a past rape to be identified as being committed by one person. Case Western Reserve University has identified the tendency of sexual offenders of being previously arrested. 26% percent had previously been arrested for sexual assault. 60% were arrested for at least one other sexual assault unrelated to the first one. In order to curb and catch such offenders, the FBI created its Behavioral Science Unit in 1974. Tactics A serial rapist can use online dating sites to identify potential victims. Threatening harm to the victim and their family is another tactic used. Drugging the victim is sometimes employed. Some serial rapists are specific in identifying their targets and their schedules. A serial rapist may describe their activities on websites, describing the tactics they use to commit the sexual assault. In 2014, an 18-year-old individual accused of serial rapes had used cell phone messaging apps Facebook, Kik, and Snapchat to establish a relationship with girls. Some serial rapists drive victims to remote locations.  Personality traits  Perpetrators can be described as \\"highly manipulative, very charismatic and charming.\\" Serial rapists differ from single-victim rapists. The distance traveled before the rape occurs was found to be further with the single-victim rapists. Single-victim rapists use a 'capture' method, sometimes using the tactic of being a hitch hiker, or a 'con' method by meeting at a bar or party and engaging in social interaction. Conversely, serial rapists have a tendency to ambush or use a 'blitz' approach of a victim. A serial rapist is more likely to target a stranger than a single-victim rapist. \\"The Rape\\" by Degas, Int√©rieur Philadelphia Museum of Art 1986-26-10 A serial rapist is more prone to exhibit \\"criminally sophisticated behaviors\\" such as using a condom and gloves. Serial rapists are more likely to control physical resistance by gagging, binding, blindfolding, and smothering. They are more likely to question the victim. Awareness of investigative, forensic methodology characterizes a serial rapist rather than a single-victim rapist and may be used by law enforcement as an investigative aid. Serial rapists are more likely to target sex workers than are single-victim rapists. Serial rapists have been described as being able to improve their ability and expertise to commit their assault through 'study' of serial rape. This includes rehearsal by viewing films, pornography, and reading relevant literature, using sexual fantasies, growth in knowledge in assault-related skills, learning from the examples of other serial rapists, and their own past experiences of physical or sexual abuse.  Prevention  Investigation of the offender instead of the crime has been proposed to prevent serial rapes. The backlog of analyzing rape kits impedes the identification of serial rapists. Hundreds of thousands of rape kits remain untested across the US. Most law enforcement agencies do not track or count them. The process is complicated, invasive, time-consuming and may re-traumatize victims. The FBI maintains a DNA database and comparisons between cases can be made. Unfortunately, the backlog of analyzing rape kits can allow the perpetrator to continue their crime before being identified with other assaults. Though no victim of a serial rapist can be blamed for the crime, reducing the risk of becoming raped by a serial rapist is possible, according to law enforcement organizations. College officials are developing strategies that target men with education on rape prevention and the responsibility to step in to prevent risky circumstances for their friends who may have impaired judgement after drinking.

About the program Ask A Biologist is a pre-kindergarten through high school program dedicated to answering questions from students, their teachers, and parents. The primary focus of the program is to connect students and teachers with working scientists through a question and answer Web e-mail form. The companion website also includes a large collection of free content and activities that can be used inside, as well as outside, of the classroom. The award-winning program has been continuously running for more than 14 years, with the assistance of more than 150 volunteer scientists, faculty, and graduate students in biology and related fields. In 2010 the program released its new website interface and features that became the subject for articles in the journals Science and PLoS Biology. =Primary audience= Ask A Biologist materials are free and open to anyone with access to the World-Wide-Web. The question portion of the program serves primarily students, grades preK-12, as well as their teachers and parents. In addition, lifelong learners are encouraged to use the website materials. =History= Ask A Biologist was launched late in 1997 in the School of Life Sciences, with an early version viewable on the Internet Archive a.k.a. The WayBackMachine. Initially, the site consisted solely of a question submission form, a feature that remains one of its core activities. By 2001, the site had grown to over 1,000 pages of content, including articles about current research, profiles of scientists, an image gallery, mystery images, puzzles, coloring pages, quizzes, and science activities. In 2003, the website released the Virtual Pocket Seed Experiment, the first of several data sets that could be used in and outside of the classroom. The experiment was based on the classic seed germination experiment, but included the feature of time-lapse animation of various seed experiments. In 2004, a second data set was released, in cooperation with Audubon Arizona. The Virtual Bird Aviary, included the majority of bird species found in the Southwest United States including more than 400 vocal recordings and companion sonograms, bird images, text descriptions, and range maps. In 2005, the website was peer reviewed by the Multimedia Educational Resource for Learning and Online Teaching (MERLOT), earning a \\"five out of five star\\" rating. In 2006, the website introduced the Mysterious World of Dr. Biology a comic book adventure. The activity encouraged students to piece together a mystery. Students reconstructed a chain of events in the Dr. Biology laboratory and field site, writing their own narrative for the story. Early in 2007, Ask A Biologist became one of the early content channels on iTunes U with its audio podcast of the same name. Hosted by Dr. Biology, the program was soon listed as one of five great courses by Macworld. Some of the guest scientists interviewed on the show included biologists and Pulitzer Prize-winning authors Edward O. Wilson and Bert H√∂lldobler, as well as physicist and writer Paul Davies. In 2008, the audio podcast program introduced a co-host contest that offered students in the Phoenix metro area the opportunity to meet and interview working scientists. In 2009, the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded the redesign of the Ask A Biologist website including the addition of Web 2.0 tools as part of the National Science Digital Library (NSDL). In 2010, Ask A Biologist released its new website developed using a Web content management tool Drupal and adding Web 2.0 options. The new content management expanded website features including translations of content into French and Spanish and an improved interface for audio streaming. The website was officially accessioned by the NSDL in September. In 2011 two new sections were added to the website.

It is made up of Erik Schaeffer and Ramtin Asadolahzadeh. Since 2016, they have released EPs and albums in France, Germany, and Japan on Vitalic's record label Citizen Records. In 2010 they started their own record label called \\"MS Records\\" as a plattform for their music and the concept behind their \\"Maximalism\\". History Ramtin Asadolahzadeh and Erik Schaeffer were introduced in Berlin in 1999. They started to work together in the same month. Their first joint project was the composition and co-production of music for the German cinema-releases Ants in the Pants (2000) and Liebesluder (2000). Combining their respective music influences, in the summer of 2001 Monossurround moved towards composing electronic music. Their first release in the same year ‚ÄúI warned you baby‚Äù was an immediate success, becoming the official festival anthem SonneMondSterne Festival 2002 in Saalburg, Thuringia. The track samples the American jazz singer Spanky Wilson. Through the success of ‚ÄúI warned you baby‚Äù connections arose between Monosurround and their peers. They remixed many artists including Sono, Phil Fuldner, Da Hool, TISM Northern Lite and Glamour to Kill. They were simultaneously remixed by artists, including The Gigler, Shir Khan, The Raccoon Brothers, DJ SPUD and Malente. At that time, parallel to regular live performances, Monosurround started working on their first studio album, Hello World. In 2004 the duo stopped performing live in order to concentrate their energies on the development and production of the album. The EP Borschtchick was released in Germany in 2005 through Moonbootique Records owned by Moonbootica. In January 2006 the Cocked, Locked EP was released on techno DJ Vitalic's record label Citizen Records in France. This EP includes the tracks ‚ÄúBorschtchick‚Äù and ‚ÄúCocked, Locked and Ready to Rock‚Äù. Having successfully released these EPs into the French market in 2006 and 2007, Monosurround played live again alongside acts such as Vitalic and The Hacker. The album Hello World was released across different countries at the end of 2008: France in September, Germany in November, and Japan in December. Style The Monosurround sound has changed greatly since its formation in 1999. Azadolahzadeh and Schaeffer come from different musical backgrounds: 1960s and 1970s soul funk, and techno and classical music respectively. Their first two years together saw performances including up to nine instrumentalists on stage playing 1960s crossover big beat. In 2001 a notable change in their sound occurred. Azadolahzadeh and Schaeffer moved towards electronic music in their composition, bringing their sound closer to electronic dance music and techno. The major stylistic turning point came in 2003 with the creation of their track ‚ÄúWe‚Äù. The signature sound from this point onwards combined epic vocal/choral textures with hard industrial noises. These features of the music bear comparison to the Justice (French band) sound which arose at the same time. From this point onwards Azadolahzadeh and Schaeffer worked under the self-imposed description ‚Äúmaximalism‚Äù. This theme motivates their music, artwork, and philosophy behind their work. Festival appearances Through their relationship with Citizen Records, Monosurround have played alongside Vitalic and The Hacker at Les Plagess festival in France, 2006 and 2007. This tour with Vitalic continued on to Barcelona to play the Razzmatazz complex in 2007. Their last big festival appearance was S√≥nar festival 2008, playing alongside The Hacker. Trivia Early in 2008, the bottled mineral water brand Perrier used the track ‚ÄúCocked, Locked, and Ready to Rock‚Äù in a TV advertising campaign in Germany. Since early 2010 Monosurround release their music on their own label MS Records. MS Records dedicated its work to release and spread maximalistic music.

History  Today‚Äôs collection of the museum was started in 1917, when Nikolai Yaroshenko, a painter who belonged to the Association of Itinerants (‚ÄòPeredvizhniki‚Äô), donated his art collection to his native city. As well as 100 paintings and 23 sketchbooks created by Yaroshenko himself, his collection included works by his friends and colleagues who took part in the Itinerant Art Exhibitions: Ivan Shishkin, Vasily Polenov, Vladimir Makovsky, Ilya Repin, Vasily Maksimov and others. The Museum was opened to the public on April 27, 1919. Originally it was officially an art gallery, not a real museum. Its founder Mikhail Rudynsky, who later became a famous Ukrainian archaeologist and museologist, called it ‚ÄúThe Museum of Arts‚Äù. It was decided to establish a city museum after Poltava region‚Äôs Historic and Artistic Monuments Protection Committee was created in the city. The artistic objects from the nationalised estates of the Kochubeys (in Dykanka), the Galagans (in Sokyrnytsi), the Kapnists (in Obukhivka), the Repnins (in Yahotyn) were now in public ownership. The museum was located in the mansion which had belonged to the landowner Bolyubash. It had been built in 1912 (the design was by the famous architect Aleshin) in a quiet corner of Poltava at 11, Spasskaya street. In a year and a half, the museum became an art department of the present Local History Museum. From 1934, after liquidation of the museum had been proposed, it was relocated in the building of the Local History Museum, where it occupied nine rooms on the ground floor. On March 7, 1939, the Ukrainian Council of People‚Äôs Commissars decreed its independent status as a regional art museum. Shortly before the war, the collection numbered about 30,000 museum pieces. During the Nazi occupation, nearly all the objects that had been on display were ruined and lost. Only the evacuated treasures of the museum survived. The museum records were lost too. Nowadays, it is only due to the museum guide by Rudynsky that we can imagine how great the losses were: a rich collection of Western European paintings by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Peter Paul Rubens, Melchior d'Hondecoeter, Adriaen van Ostade, √âlisabeth Louise Vig√©e-Le Brun and others, works by Ukrainian painters of the 17th-18th centuries, the best pieces by Russian artists of the 19th-20th centuries, to name but a few.¬´–ü–æ–ª—Ç–∞–≤—Å–∫–∏–π —Ö—É–¥–æ–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –º—É–∑–µ–π¬ª, –ê–ª—å–±–æ–º, –ö. –ì. –°–∫–∞–ª–∞—Ü–∫–∏–π, –ö., –ú–∏—Å—Ç–µ—Ü—Ç–≤–æ, 1982 In November 1944, when Poltava was still all ruined, the Art Museum resumed its work. In 1951, the museum returned to its original building that had been restored. After the war, the staff of the museum did their best to make up the lost collection. Now, including the 4,187 objects that survived in the war, it numbered over 9,000 museum pieces. However the building, somewhat hastily repaired, was in bad technical condition (as it was stated in 2000). The City Council resolved to move the museum to the building of the Art Gallery in Frunze Street. There, the exhibition takes up two separate suites of rooms on the ground floor.  Modern period  After the relocation, the chronological arrangement of the exhibition remained unchanged. The suite on the left houses Western European art: paintings, sculptures, porcelain. Unique are the works by Lucas Cranach the Younger, Van Ravesteyn, Clara Peeters, Melchior d‚ÄôHondecoeter, Marcello Bacciarelli, Jean-Baptiste Greuze, Francesco Guardi and others. On the right, there are works by Ukrainian and Russian artists, samples of church utensils of the 17th-18th centuries, sculptures, furniture. Two rooms are allocated for Yaroshenko‚Äôs works. Of special interest is his self-portrait twinned with that of his wife. Also of note are his Caucasian landscapes, portraits of his contemporaries, studies for his famous pictures. Nowadays, the museum has taken full advantage of the new location, in particular of the large exhibition room. Large-scale art exhibitions of the works stored in the museum are periodically held, thus making it possible for the citizens to better learn the treasures their museum possesses and for the museum to promote its collection and art in general.

The bridge was constructed by local Cecil County bridgewright Joseph George Johnson in the autumn and winter of 1860-61 across North East Creek. The bridge was erected adjacent to and upstream of Samuel Gilpin's mills and dam and crosses the millpond formed by it. This bridge has a span of and a total length of with its shelter panel overhangs, is wide, and is closed to all vehicular traffic. The structure was restored in 1959 by the State Roads Commission and the Historical Society of Cecil County. In 2010 the bridge was rehabilitated by engineers Wallace, Montgomery & Associates, LLP; contractor Kinsley Construction; and specialist bridgwrighting subcontractors, Barns & Bridges of New England, the Truax Timberwright Woodworks, and New World Restoration. Gilpin's Falls Covered Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. Construction details The bridge's trusses, floor beams, ties, and lateral bracing systems are framed almost entirely of Eastern White Pine (Pinus strobus), a species typically favored for wooden bridge framing in areas of the country where it was found, for its strength- to-weight ratio. So favored for this purpose, it was commonly imported into areas where it was unavailable as an indigenous species (minimizing dead load a strategy for increasing capacity for live load). Original rafters were quite easily identifiable from those replaced after the 1958 roof collapse, and were (as are the newly replicated replacements) framed with tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), also a lightweight species favored by the bridgewrighting community where available. Replicated rafters, like their predecessors, are tapered over their length, one inch wider at their tail than at the ridge. This was likely not an esthetic choice, but done as part of an overall strategy to minimize dead load. The original floor beams were replaced sometime in the 1920s, the bridges final decade of service, with mixed species ash and oak. This was an attempt to increase load capacity. The only original white pine floorbeam to escape replacement was the one found at the centerline of truss, which was tenoned through the king post at midspan. All others were bolted to the sides of their adjacent posts, and were easily replaced. This strategy seems to have failed (the bridge was bypassed in the following decade) and the additional weight was part of the reason why the bridge's framing became severely distorted in the decades of neglect to follow. These hardwood replacements had heavy infestations of deathwatch and powderpost beetles (Bostrichoidea) and were again replaced with timbers of appropriate species in the recently completed restoration.

That school existed prior to 1799, at least 10 years before the construction of this building in 1809. The brick building was constructed for the elementary school run by local Presbyterian pastor, Rev. Robert Finley. This was about halfway through Rev. Finley's time at Basking Ridge. During the time he ran the school, attendance grew from fewer than 12 to an average near 25 students, and sometimes as high as 40 students. Students came from near & far, mostly from prominent families. The school was a high end preparatory school for boys who generally continued on to the College of New Jersey, later (in 1896), known as Princeton University. In 1817, Rev. Finley quit Basking Ridge to briefly become president of the University of Georgia in Athens, GA. By 1828, the \\"Brick Academy\\" corporation was formed and the building continued use as a private, then public school in 1853, before being used for other purposes. The nickname \\"Brick Academy\\" is often misused to include students who actually attended the \\"Basking Ridge Classical School\\" (prior to 1828). It is also used inappropriately to include students at that school prior to the construction of the brick building, later known as \\"the Brick Academy\\". Samuel Southard is frequently cited as having attended the \\"Brick Academy\\" in Basking Ridge, however he graduated Princeton in 1804 - fully 5 years prior to the construction of the brick building later known as the Brick Academy. After many years of service as a private boys' school, the Brick Academy later served as a public school, and then as a meeting hall for several fraternal and benevolent organizations, and the Bernards Township municipal building. (See timeline below.) In 1976 the Township leased the Brick Academy to The Historical Society of the Somerset Hills which uses the historic building for its headquarters and public meetings, and operates a museum, one room schoolhouse for local history, and research room.

His most renowned collection of poems, the Over-ysselsche Sangen en Dichten (1630), forms a high point of Dutch baroque. According to Pieter Geyl, Life Revius was born in Deventer, the son of the town's mayor, Ryck Reefsen, during the Dutch Revolt. Not long after his birth, in 1587, Deventer fell into Spanish hands and his mother fled with him to Amsterdam where he was raised. He was educated at Leiden (1604‚Äì07) and Franeker (1607‚Äì10), and in 1610-1612 visited various foreign universities, particularly the Academy of Saumur, Montauban, and Orl√©ans. Here, he got acquainted with Renaissance poetry which would have a big influence on his own poetry. Returning to the Netherlands, he held brief pastorates at Zeddam, Winterswijk, and Aalten in 1613, and by Oct., 1614, he had become pastor in his native city of Deventer, where he remained twenty- seven years. In 1618 he was appointed librarian of the Fraterhuis, and in the same year the Synod of Dort assigned him a part in the new revision of the Dutch translation of the Old Testament; the Statenvertaling. The committee of translators and revisers, which convened at Leiden in 1633-34, made Revius secretary. He likewise took an active part in the establishment of the Athenaeum at Deventer in 1630, and was influential in calling the first professors. From 1641 he was regent at the State Seminary at the University of Leiden.Pieter Geyl, History of the Dutch-Speaking Peoples 1555-1648 (2001 edition), p. 498. His closing years were embittered by the rise of Cartesianism, to which he was intensely opposed. A rare Hebrew scholar, Revius was also a prolific writer. He showed, however, a domineering disposition and exercised a vehement polemic, as shown in his struggle with Cartesianism and the Remonstrants. While endeavoring to avoid the contemporary controversy whether men might wear long hair, he was obliged to defend his moderate position. He died in Leiden. Thought Revius‚Äô work is sometimes passionately militant, sometimes deeply devout and religious, Calvinistic but also Renaissancistic. His Over-Ysselsche Sangen en Dichten of 1630 contains both a long section of poems on Biblical topics, and mixed secular poems. It was heavily influenced by French Catholic literature.Maria A. Schenkeveld, Dutch Literature in the Age of Rembrandt: Themes and Ideas (1991), p. 47. Against the Remonstrants he wrote Schriftuurlijk tegen Bericht van de Leere der Gereformeerde Kerken aengaende de goddelijke Predestinatie ende andere aen-clevende Poineten (Deventer, 1617); against Anglican and royal absolutist Robert Filmer's Patriarcha, itself a disputation against the political doctrines of Suarez and Bellarmine, Revius wrote his Suarez Repurgatus (Leyden 1648); against the Cartesians he wrote especially his Statera philosophise Cartesiante (Leyden, 1650) and Theke, hoc eat levitas defensionia Cartesian (Letter, 1653). In support of the rights of the Church he wrote his Examen ... seu de potestate magistratuum reformatorum circa res erelesiastieas (Amsterdam, 1642), and his Uittreksels ... over de macht der merheid in het afzetten van predikanten (Leyden, 1650). His most famous poem is Hy droegh onse smerten (He carried our sorrows) with its first line \\"T' en sijn de Joden niet, Heer Jesu, die u cruysten\\" (It's not the Jews, Lord Jesus, who crucified you). Although in this poem Revius seems to stand up for the Jews, he is believed to have been anti-Semitic, as a Christian, and especially a Calvinist, was expected to be in those days. Much of Revius' other work is steeped in anti-Semitism. Legacy In his own time, Revius was not popular and he was mostly known for his controversial writings and his history of Deventer; Daventriae illustratae (1651). Today, he is one of the few 17th century Dutch poets whose work is still being read and sung. Het Liedboek voor de Kerken, the most commonly used hymn book in the Netherlands, features seven of his poems in modernized spelling. In many towns in the Netherlands, streets have been named after him, such as Reviusdreef (Revius avenue) in Leiderdorp, Reviusplein (Revius square) in Maassluis, Reviusstraat (Revius street) in Hazerswoude-Rijndijk and de Jacobs Reviuslaan (the Jacob Revius lane) in Eindhoven.

It aims at providing middleware that serves third-party value-added services and applications at a higher application layer. The service layer provides capability servers owned by a telecommunication network service provider, accessed through open and secure Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) by application layer servers owned by third-party content providers. The service layer also provides an interface to core networks at a lower resource layer.Kristofer Kimbler, Service Interaction in Next Generation Networks: Challenges and Opportunities. Feature Interactions in Telecommunications and Software Systems. Papers from the sixths International Workshop on Feature Interactions in Telecommunications and Software Systems May 2000. Edition: illustrated. Published by: IOS Press, 2000. . The lower layers may also be named control layer and transport layer (the transport layer is also referred to as the access layer in some architectures). The concept of service layer is used in contexts such as Intelligent networks (IN), WAP, 3G and IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS). It is defined in the 3GPP Open Services Architecture (OSA) model, which reused the idea of the Parlay API for third-party servers. In software design, for example Service-oriented architecture, the concept of service layer has a different meaning. Service layer in IMS The service layer of an IMS architecture provides multimedia services to the overall IMS network. This layer contains network elements which connect to the Serving- CSCF (Call Session Control Function) using the IP multimedia Subsystem Service Control Interface (ISC).http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/23228.htm The ISC interface uses the SIP signalling protocol. =Elements of the IMS service layer= The network elements contained within the service layer are generically referred to as 'service platforms' however the 3GPP specification (3GPP TS 23.228 V8.7.0) defines several types of service platforms: * SIP Application Server * OSA Service Capability Server * IM-SSF =SIP Application Server= The SIP Application Server (AS) performs the same function as a Telephony Application Server in a pre-IMS network, however it is specifically tailored to support the SIP signalling protocol for use in an IMS network. =OSA Service Capability Server= An OSA Service Capability Server acts as a secure gateway between the IMS network and an application which runs upon the Open Services Architecture (this is typically a SIP to Parlay gateway) =IM- SSF= The IM-SSF (IP Multimedia Service Switching Function) acts as a gateway between the IMS network and application servers using other telecommunication signalling standards such as INAP and CAMEL. Service layer in SOA In service-oriented architecture (SOA), the service layer is the third layer in a five-abstraction-layer model. The model consists of Object layer, Component layer, Service layer, Process layer and Enterprise layer.Service-oriented Architecture Compass: Business Value, Planning, and Enterprise Roadmap. Author: Norbert Bieberstein, Sanjay Bose, Marc Fiammante, Keith Jones, Rawn Shah. Edition: illustrated. Published by: FT Press, 2005.

The pamphlet claimed that the Bible did not forbid slavery, and although some might find it reprehensible, it cannot be deemed a sin. Hopkins concedes that slavery could be deemed a ‚Äúphysical evil‚Äù but the strongly opposes the idea that it is a ‚Äúmoral evil‚Äù, saying ‚ÄúI condemn the institution of Slavery ‚Ä¶ But as a Christian I am compelled to submit my weak and erring intellect to the almighty‚Äù. Hopkins also uses his claim on a political basis, arguing that the Civil War was started by ‚Äúultra abolitionists‚Äù, who preached against the word of God and turned the Union against the South. Contents of the pamphlet Old Testament In his pamphlet Hopkins explores the Bible and systematically uses different Bible stories from the Old Testaments to prove his claim. He consistently interprets the word servant in the Bible to mean slave and thus cites the numerous instances in which the Bible talks about servants as evidence towards his claim. Some of the Bible stories that he uses are: *The Curse of Canaan, Genesis 9:25 *Abraham and Hagar, Genesis 16:9 *The Ten Commandments *The Jewish Laws of Servitude New Testament He also uses the teachings of Jesus to support his claim. He drops the systematic approach he used for the Old Testament, and begins to jump around between gospels. In this section Hopkins concludes that, since Jesus did not repeal the laws pertaining to slavery, then he did not oppose them. Since slavery was in full effect during Jesus‚Äô life, says Hopkins, his disregard for the subject entirely must signify his approval. Controversy A pamphlet entitled Bishop Hopkins Letter on Slavery Ripped Up and his Misuse of the Sacred Scriptures Exposed was written by an anonymous clergyman in 1863. In this pamphlet the author methodically opposes all of Hopkins‚Äô points and either gives more evidence to show how he was wrong or gives another interpretation of the Hopkins‚Äô evidence to prove the contrary. This opposition to Hopkins' pamphlet shows the intense divide in the Episcopal Church over the issue of slavery. Throughout the Civil War, the Church remained unclear on its official stance on slavery, and these two opposing pamphlets are a prime example of the two duelling factions.

The guns were numbered '1' to '4' from front to rear. The ships carried three above-water twin sets of torpedo tubes; one mount was between the forward superstructure and the forward gun and the other two were between the aft funnel and aft superstructure. Early in the war, the No. 4 gun and the aft torpedo tubes were removed in exchange for four depth charge throwers and 18 depth charges.

Originally commissioned simply Destroyer No. 5, the ship was assigned the name Harukaze on 1 August 1928.Watts & Gordon, p. 264 Pacific War At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, Harukaze was part of Destroyer Division 5 under Destroyer Squadron 5 of the IJN 3rd Fleet, and deployed from Mako Guard District in the Pescadores as part of the Japanese invasion force for the Operation M (the invasion of the Philippines), during which time it helped screen landings of Japanese forces at Aparri and at Lingayen Gulf. In early 1942, Harukaze was assigned to escorting troop convoys to Malaya and French Indochina. Assigned to Operation J (the invasion of Java in the Netherlands East Indies), she participated at the Battle of Sunda Strait on 1 March 1942. During that battle, she launched torpedoes at the cruisers and and took damage to her bridge, engine room and rudder in return, with three crewmen killed and over fifteen injured. From 10 March, Harukaze and Destroyer Division 5 were assigned to the Southwest Area Fleet and escorted troop convoy from Singapore to Penang, Rangoon, French Indochina, Rabaul and New Guinea. On 16 November, Harukaze hit a mine at Surabaya, which completed severed her bow. Repairs at Surabaya took until May 1943, but Harukaze was still deemed not combat-worthy, and returned to Kure Naval Arsenal in Japan on 27 May 1943. After repairs were completed on 25 August, Harukaze departed Kure as escort for a convoy to Palau, and continued to escort shipping around Palau to the end of the year.Nevitt In 1944, Harukaze continued to escort convoys from Palau to the Japanese home islands and Taiwan, the Philippines and Borneo. On 24 October 1944, while escorting a convoy from Manila to Takao, Harukaze made contact with the submarine and dropped depth charges. After losing and regaining the contact, the destroyer dropped another 17 depth charges which resulted in \\"bubbles, heavy oil, clothes and cork\\" coming to the surface, indicating that the submarine had been destroyed.Brown.

His paternal grandfather, Frederick Fisher, had migrated to western North Carolina from Shenandoah County, Virginia, and had served as an officer in the local militia during the American Revolutionary War. His maternal grandparents were Lewis Beard and Susan Dunn, and his maternal great grandfather, lawyer John Dunn, was an ardent Tory during that war. After a local private education, Fisher entered Yale University in 1835, but failed to complete his freshman year.https://www.ncpedia.org/biography/fisher-charles-frederick Fisher married Ruth Caldwell (daughter of businessman and legislator from Greensboro County, North Carolina, David Caldwell), and they would have three children who would be reared by relatives after Fisher's death related below.

His father was a politician for 28 years, much of which time Fisher supported him as copublisher of the Western Carolinian. A Democrat, Fisher won his first political office in 1854, when Rowan County voters elected him as a state senator. The following year, Fisher became president of the North Carolina Railroad, succeeding former governor John Morehead. While still the railroad's president, he was also selected as its principal contractor to build a line to Morganton, North Carolina. Slow construction progress and high costs produced considerable criticism, particularly from Jonathan Worth (businessman, lawyer, Whig legislator and president of the competing Fayetteville and Western Plank Road Company).

His mother brought up and provided for her two sons by working as a dressmaker. Henry was one of Britain's market research pioneers whose contributions to its acceptance and understanding won him an international reputation. He was the last survivor of the 23 founders of the Market Research Society (MRS), which he helped establish in 1947, and which now has 8,000 members in 50 countries. He married Mary Anstey, daughter of Vera Anstey, in 1938. She died in 1989, a year after they had celebrated their golden wedding anniversary. In publishing, he was Marketing Director of the Thomson Organisation for nine years, where he also became a Deputy Managing Director. His influence was significant in pulling an old-fashioned conservative industry towards the appreciation and practice of marketing in newspapers and magazines, a benefit inherited by radio and television. He was the first to use the computer in a market research study. In 1988, he received the Market Research Society's rarely awarded Gold Medal. In 2004, he received the Advertising Association's prestigious Mackintosh Medal, awarded for outstanding personal and public service to the industry (in this case, only the third time in the previous fifteen years, and also in recognition of forty years as chairman of its Advertising Statistics Committee). Education He attended two primary schools, one in Finchley and the other in Hackney and at the age of eleven was transferred to Upton House London County Council Central School, in Homerton. This type of school, an early experiment in state secondary education, had just been created for students up to the age of sixteen, who would otherwise be leaving school at fourteen, to extend their general education with the addition of some commercial subjects. He obtained the London Matriculation with Honours, and was awarded a Wedgewood Scholarship to City of London College in 1932. In 1934, he was awarded a Bursary that enabled him to enter the London School of Economics (LSE), where he read Economics, with Statistics as a subsidiary subject. In those days, the LSE had less than 3,000 students. Henry served as Senior Treasurer of the Students' Union, Editor of the Clare Market Review, the Union's official magazine (after having edited and largely written Felix, an extremely unofficial one), Chairman of the Social Committee, Chairman of the Literary Society, Business Manager of the Review of Economic Studies (an academic journal), and Vice-Chairman of the Labour Society. Towards the end of this, he was involved in a libel action arising from an article he wrote in the University of London Union Magazine, pointing out that the gerrymandering involved in the election of the M.P. for London University gave control to the commercial correspondence colleges, whose interests were commercial rather than academic. Pressure from the judge (in chambers) led to a reluctant withdrawal, but there were no damages and he was convinced that Higher Authority had organised a cover-up. He obtained a B.Sc. (Economics) in 1937, which qualified him for his first job. Colman Prentis & Varley, a relatively new and extremely small advertising agency, having gained two minor advertising accounts from Procter & Gamble (just beginning to make a presence felt in the UK, under the name of Thomas Hedley) learnt that it would need a market research department. They went to LSE to find somebody to fill this role, in the mistaken belief that what was required was a statistician. Henry was appointed to this post in 1938, and began to learn about market research, largely by experiment. He supplemented this as the London correspondent of the Boston Globe, providing a weekly column on the various social and other activities of the family of Joseph Kennedy, the then US ambassador to London. War The outbreak of war terminated these apprenticeships, and he was called up in 1940. After training in the ranks of the Royal Artillery, he was commissioned in 1941, and served as a regimental officer in various anti- aircraft batteries until 1943, when he transferred to the newly formed statistical branch of the Army as a Staff Officer. He was eventually posted to the Headquarters staff of Montgomery's 21st Army Group, where he played a modest part in the preparations for the invasion of Europe and in subsequent operations in France, Belgium and Germany. During the latter part of this period, he found the opportunity to use his market research skills in surveys of radio listening among the troops in that theatre of war, and was also responsible for the introduction of a number of what would later be referred to as Information Systems. One of these involved the production of a weekly abstract of administrative statistics for circulation throughout the theatre, and another, the devising and operating of 'TOCCI' (Theatre Officers Central Card Index), a system making use of Hollerith punched-card equipment to facilitate and speed up the demobilisation of officers. Post war Henry was demobilised with the rank of Major in 1946. He returned to Colman Prentis & Varley, which had begun to move into the big league, first as Market Research Manager and shortly thereafter as Director and General Manager of Market Information Services Ltd, a subsidiary company that he created from scratch. By the time he left Market Information Services in 1954, it had grown into one of the top ten research companies in the country. These years were a period of rapid expansion in the field of market research as a whole, and he took his part in the development of many of the procedures which subsequently came into common use. =Market Research Society= He was one of the 23 people who, in 1946, founded the Market Research Society, and played a major role both in the development of research techniques and in the promotion of market research as a tool of management. His particular interest in the media of communication was stimulated by the fact that he was responsible for the planning, conduct and production from 1947 to 1953 of the Hulton Readership Surveys, which were the predecessors of what became the National Readership Surveys. In this same area, he was responsible for the Hulton Tables of Advertisement Attention Value (1949), the development of the first system for using punched-card equipment to compute net press coverage (1949), and the first national surveys of readership among farmers (1947), among retailers (1948) and among children (1950). He was also Editor and joint author of The Rural Market (1948) and Patterns of British Life (1950). =McCann-Erickson Advertising= In 1954, he joined McCann-Erickson Advertising Ltd. as Director of Research, and there built up a very sizeable research department, more closely integrated with the overall workings of the agency than was usual in those days. In particular, it became agency policy to persuade clients (particularly new clients) that full- scale research into their markets would result in more effective advertising. In 1959, he launched Marplan Ltd., a subsidiary company, which developed along these lines into what was one of the leading market research agencies in Great Britain. He organised the establishment of sister Marplan companies in Belgium, France and Germany, and was Chairman of the McCann-Erickson European Research Committee, while continuing as a senior member of the board of McCann-Erickson Ltd. =Revolution in research= During the mid-1950s, he had come to the conclusion that the existing techniques of market research, though adequate to the measurement of consumer behaviour, could not offer a reliable framework for marketing decisions. This led to the publication of his 1958 book, Motivation Research: Its Practice and Uses, the first on the subject to be published in Europe. In this book, he drew on his experience to produce a practical guide to the rigorous scientific use of indirect techniques to produce insights which, he argued, could not be validly or even reliably derived from direct questioning or discussion. =The Thomson Organisation= In 1961, he was invited to join the Board of The Thomson Organisation Ltd, then principally (apart from its ownership of Scottish Television) the publisher of the Sunday Times and a raft of regional newspapers, as Director of Marketing, bringing marketing into newspaper publishing for the first time. In 1962, he established the annual Thomson Medals and Awards for Advertising Research, which, by stimulating fresh thinking on media research problems, were responsible over the following ten years for the formulation and dissemination of a number of fundamental contributions to the theory and practice of advertising. Also in 1962, he took advantage of the relaxation by Nikita Khrushchev of the rigidity of Soviet rule to mount an unprecedented promotion exercise for the recently launched Sunday Times Colour Magazine, which did not immediately return satisfactory advertising revenue. This involved hiring a Tupolev Tu-114 from Aeroflot in which to fly a plane-load of British business tycoons for the week-end, to meet and talk to their opposite numbers in Moscow. In 1965, after successfully tendering for the contract from Post Office Telecommunications for the introduction into the UK of 'yellow pages' telephone directories, he set up and was the first Chairman of Thomson Yellow Pages Ltd. In 1968, he and Mick Shields (of Associated Newspapers) were asked by Cecil King, then Chairman of the Newspaper Publishers' Association, to examine the practicability of the introduction into the Association of a marketing function as a means of improving the efficiency of the national newspaper industry and of enabling it better to withstand competition. This led to the establishment of a consortium, the 'NPA Marketing Executive' (which he chaired) and the recruitment of some specialist staff, but which petered out because, as he observed then and at intervals over the next thirty years, the national newspaper publishers would always prefer to hang separately than to hang together. But what might be regarded as its successor was launched in 2002 as the Newspaper Marketing Agency. He left the Thomson Organisation in 1970, setting up his own consultancy in 1971. =Admap= As Consultant Editor and subsequently as Editor-in-Chief of Admap, he consolidated that publication's reputation for intellectual stringency and authority, which sets it aside from the generality of newsy, even gossipy, advertising periodicals. In 1983, he joined Mike Waterson in setting up a modest venture to launch the quarterly Food & Drink Forecast. This developed rapidly, and had grown by 1998 into Information Sciences Ltd and become one of the world's largest private sector suppliers of economic information through its operating arm NTC Research Ltd, and one of the world's major publisher of advertising and media knowledge via Admap, many other trade journals and books, and the World Advertising Research Center. Impact on the field of marketing His whole career was marked by innovation. He was the first to use a computer LEO, the first UK computer dedicated to business use) to analyse market research data (1959) and the first to do so in a readership survey (for the Western Mail in 1961). He carried out the first national study of public attitudes towards advertising (1954), the first survey of the poster audience (1948), the first readership survey among retailers (1948), the first national readership survey among children(1950), and the first qualitative study of regional newspaper readership (1963). In 1956, he acted as technical consultant to the first Italian national readership survey. Not surprisingly, he has been much in demand by industry and academic bodies. He was at various times (and sometimes simultaneously) Visiting Professor of Marketing at the University of Bradford and the Cranfield Institute of Technology (now University), and Professor of Marketing and Media Policy at the International Management Centres. He was for twelve years Chairman of the Marketing Communication Research Centre, an ongoing operation funded by a number of major marketing companies which was founded in Bradford in 1972, and subsequently moved to Cranfield when he did. He had chaired the technical sub-committee of the National Readership Survey, and the Research Committees of the Regional Newspaper Advertising Bureau and of British Posters, and was for forty years Chairman of the Research Committee of the Advertising Association. He was a Governor of the History of Advertising Trust, and a member of the editorial boards of the Journal of Advertising History and the International Journal of Advertising. Publications As a by-product of his business and academic activities, and in various managerial capacities, he wrote and lectured extensively, in a number of countries, on management, marketing, research and related topics. Books published in earlier years, include Patterns of British Life (1948) and The Rural Market (1950). His first book, written when he was 21 years old, The Insurance Man and his Trade (1938), in the 'Fact' library published monthly by Raymond Postgate (1/- cloth board, 6d. paper covers), suggested that burial insurance was 'the grossest form of systematic exploitation ever practised in this country' A selection of his papers up to 1971 having been published in that year under the title of Perspectives in Management, Marketing and Research. Later publications included Behind the Headlines: Readings in the Economics of the Press (1978) and The Dynamics of the British Press, 1961 to 1984 (1986) and he edited the massive Proceedings of the four International Readership Research Symposia of 1981, 1983, 1985 and 1988 (published as Readership Research: Theory and Practice).

His Jewish family emigrated to France in 1934 to escape Nazi persecution. In 1996 he was awarded the L√©gion d'honneur. He wrote a memoir in 2007 to publicize the role of the many foreigners, mostly Jewish, in the armed Resistance against the Nazis in France. Early life and education Herbert Herz was born on May 7, 1924 Augsburg in Bavaria to Simon and Meta Eichenbronner Herz; he had an older brother Emmanuel. His family spent much of his childhood there. After his father and uncle were arrested and held for three weeks in 1933 from being denounced, they decided to leave Germany quickly to escape more persecution under the rise of Nazism. They emigrated to Dijon, France in 1934 when Herbert was 10. He quickly learned the new language and studied in French schools.\\"Herbert Herz\\", Anonymes, Justes et pers√©cut√©s durant la p√©riode nazie dans les communes de France (AJPN), accessed 9 Sep 2010 World War II After the Fall of France in 1940, the Herz family evacuated to Bordeaux, where the children continued in school. His father had died in 1939. After its occupation of France, the Nazis continued their actions against the Jews and required French authorities to carry out their orders. In 1942 the Germans ordered French authorities in the Free Zone to round up all foreign Jews for deportation to Nazi concentration camps. Although Herz was captured by the French Gendarmerie, he escaped with the aid of a professor from his school and avoided internment and deportation. Going underground at age 18 for a year, Herz rejoined his brother Emmanuel in the South of France, but they went to Grenoble to escape police interest. That area was occupied by the Italians, who did not bother the Jews. In the summer of 1943, they joined the armed R√©sistance in Grenoble under the aegis of the FTP-MOI (Francs-Tireurs et Partisans ‚Äì Main-d'≈íuvre Immigr√©e). The FTP-MOI was made up mostly of foreigners, many of them Spanish, Jews from Germany and eastern Europe, and Armenians. The FTP-MOI in many cases was trained by older fighters who had fought in Spain during its civil war and Italy. The FTP_MOI was present in all the big cities in France, taking armed actions against the Nazi occupation of France, for example, bombing the factories working for the nazis, derailing trains carrying Wehrmacht and SS troops, bombing the Wehrmacht troops, and killing Nazi officers. The Nazis fought back with investigations, roundups, interrogation under torture of prisoners to try to break down the cells. The Germans tried to classify them as foreigners, criminals, terrorists and outsiders, as with the l'Affiche Rouge in Paris, but many of the population embraced the partisans as freedom fighters. In 1943 Emmanuel Herz tried to make his way into Switzerland, which was neutral. Herz, his mother and sister planned to join him if he was successful. Detained at the border by the Swiss, Emmanuel was turned over to French authorities, who transported him to the intern camp of Drancy. From there he was deported to Auschwitz, where he died. After Grenoble was occupied by the Germans, Herz made his way to Lyon, where he fought more with the Resistance. In 1996 the French government awarded Herbert Herz the decoration of the Legion d'Honneur for his service. Herz died in September 2016. Postwar years =Marriage and family= Herz married and he and his wife had three children together. =Career= After the war, Herz completed his studies in engineering. He went on to work for the Conseil Europ√©en pour la Recherche Nucl√©aire (CERN) (European Council for Nuclear Research) in Geneva, Switzerland. Now called Organisation europ√©enne pour la recherche nucl√©aire, it retains the original acronym. Although he has lived and worked in Switzerland for decades, Herz never became a naturalized Swiss citizen, in memory of the Swiss having turned his brother over to French authorities at the border. Now retired, Herz lives in Ferney-Voltaire. He works as a delegate of the Yad Vashem Institute in Jerusalem to find people who risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust. Such people are candidates for the Institute's award of \\"Righteous among the Nations\\". In 2007, Herz published a memoir, Mon combat dans la R√©sistance FTP-MOI, Souvenirs d'un jeune Juif allemand (My combat in the FTP-MOI resistance, memories of a young German Jew). He wants to publicize the participation of the many foreigners in the French resistance, and highlight the armed fighting of Jews in the struggle against the Nazis and other supporters of Adolf Hitler. He also maintains a blog, where he writes on the Resistance.

The cast includes Freddie Highmore and Ving Rhames. Plot Set in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, during the early apartheid days. The story deals with the coming of age of seventeen-year-old Hally (played by Freddie Highmore). Hally, a white South African, has a bad relationship with his biological father and is torn between his father's expectations and opinions of him and those of his surrogate fathers, black waiters named Sam (played by Ving Rhames) and Willie (played by Patrick Mofokeng). Young Hally is obliged to laugh at his father's racist jokes and perform humiliating tasks like empty chamber pots. By contrast, Sam exposes Hally to many positive experiences. After being humiliated by his father, Sam shows Hally how to be proud of something he's achieved by helping him build and fly his own kite. One day, Hally receives news that his real father, a violent alcoholic, is coming back home from a long stint in a hospital. Hally, distraught with this news, unleashes years of anger and pain on his two black friends. Production Master Harold and the Boys began filming in and around Cape Town, South Africa in mid-January, 2009 over a five-week period. It is one of the first feature films in South Africa to be shot with the red camera format. This film has a budget of just under $3m. Apart from its two international actors (Freddie Highmore & Ving Rhames), Nugent and American director Lonny Price, this film is a fully South African film.

A random vector is a random variable with multiple dimensions. Each element of the vector is a scalar random variable. Each element has either a finite number of observed empirical values or a finite or infinite number of potential values. The potential values are specified by a theoretical joint probability distribution. Intuitively, the cross-covariance matrix generalizes the notion of covariance to multiple dimensions. The cross-covariance matrix of two random vectors \\\\mathbf{X} and \\\\mathbf{Y} is typically denoted by \\\\operatorname{K}_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\mathbf{Y}} or \\\\Sigma_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\mathbf{Y}}. Definition For random vectors \\\\mathbf{X} and \\\\mathbf{Y}, each containing random elements whose expected value and variance exist, the cross-covariance matrix of \\\\mathbf{X} and \\\\mathbf{Y} is defined by {=}\\\\ \\\\operatorname{E}[(\\\\mathbf{X}-\\\\mathbf{\\\\mu_X})(\\\\mathbf{Y}-\\\\mathbf{\\\\mu_Y})^{\\\\rm T}]}} cellpadding= 6 border border colour = #0073CF background colour=#F5FFFA}} where \\\\mathbf{\\\\mu_X} = \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\mathbf{X}] and \\\\mathbf{\\\\mu_Y} = \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\mathbf{Y}] are vectors containing the expected values of \\\\mathbf{X} and \\\\mathbf{Y}. The vectors \\\\mathbf{X} and \\\\mathbf{Y} need not have the same dimension, and either might be a scalar value. The cross-covariance matrix is the matrix whose (i,j) entry is the covariance :\\\\operatorname{K}_{X_i Y_j} = \\\\operatorname{cov}[X_i, Y_j] = \\\\operatorname{E}[(X_i - \\\\operatorname{E}[X_i])(Y_j - \\\\operatorname{E}[Y_j])] between the i-th element of \\\\mathbf{X} and the j-th element of \\\\mathbf{Y}. This gives the following component-wise definition of the cross-covariance matrix. : \\\\operatorname{K}_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\mathbf{Y}}= \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathrm{E}[(X_1 - \\\\operatorname{E}[X_1])(Y_1 - \\\\operatorname{E}[Y_1])] & \\\\mathrm{E}[(X_1 - \\\\operatorname{E}[X_1])(Y_2 - \\\\operatorname{E}[Y_2])] & \\\\cdots & \\\\mathrm{E}[(X_1 - \\\\operatorname{E}[X_1])(Y_n - \\\\operatorname{E}[Y_n])] \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathrm{E}[(X_2 - \\\\operatorname{E}[X_2])(Y_1 - \\\\operatorname{E}[Y_1])] & \\\\mathrm{E}[(X_2 - \\\\operatorname{E}[X_2])(Y_2 - \\\\operatorname{E}[Y_2])] & \\\\cdots & \\\\mathrm{E}[(X_2 - \\\\operatorname{E}[X_2])(Y_n - \\\\operatorname{E}[Y_n])] \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathrm{E}[(X_m - \\\\operatorname{E}[X_m])(Y_1 - \\\\operatorname{E}[Y_1])] & \\\\mathrm{E}[(X_m - \\\\operatorname{E}[X_m])(Y_2 - \\\\operatorname{E}[Y_2])] & \\\\cdots & \\\\mathrm{E}[(X_m - \\\\operatorname{E}[X_m])(Y_n - \\\\operatorname{E}[Y_n])] \\\\end{bmatrix} Example For example, if \\\\mathbf{X} = \\\\left( X_1,X_2,X_3 \\\\right)^{\\\\rm T} and \\\\mathbf{Y} = \\\\left( Y_1,Y_2 \\\\right)^{\\\\rm T} are random vectors, then \\\\operatorname{cov}(\\\\mathbf{X},\\\\mathbf{Y}) is a 3 \\\\times 2 matrix whose (i,j)-th entry is \\\\operatorname{cov}(X_i,Y_j).

His murder triggered an escalation of the Years of Lead. Life Calabresi was born on 14 November 1937 into a middle-class Roman family. His father was a wine and oil merchant. He attended the classical secondary school San Leone Magno and graduated from university with a law degree in 1964 with a thesis on the Sicilian Mafia. He chose to enter the police over a career as an attorney and was sent to Milan, Luigi Calabresi at santiebeati.it where he was assigned to investigate anarchist groups. On 12 December 1969, a bomb exploded in the Milan office of the National Agricultural Bank in Piazza Fontana. 17 people were killed and 88 others wounded. Among those interrogated as suspects was anarchist railway worker Giuseppe Pinelli. On the night of 15 December, Pinelli died from a fall from a fourth floor window of the police headquarters.\\"Luigi Calabresi: 43 years ago the murder of commissioner\\", Polizia di Stato, 17 May 2015 Theories of what caused Pinelli's fall included murder, suicide, and an accident due to loss of consciousness. On 3 July 1970 judicial authorities closed the case as an accidental death. A second inquiry in 1975 confirmed this by ruling Pinelli's death due to an \\"active illness\\". The 1975 tribunal further found that Calabresi was not in the room at the time of Pinelli's death. However, elements of the far left did not accept the determination. Despite being exonerated by the institutions of the Italian state, the far-left Lotta Continua accused Calabresi of being responsible for the death of Pinelli. For two years he was the focus of a media campaign, led in part by the weekly L'Espresso, that held him responsible for Pinelli's death.Brienza, Giuseppe. \\"Luigi Calbresi, Servant of the State\\", Formiche, 14 May 2015 Calabresi was shot in the street and murdered in Milan on 17 May 1972 on his way to work.

Psychological effects  The decision to relinquish birth rights of a child is a heavy burden on the psychological makeup of a birth mother. She may feel a sense of loss for someone who is still alive or mourns the loss of her mothering role and may mourn for who her child may have become as her son or daughter. These feelings may resurface in later years, perhaps on the child‚Äôs birthday or other important milestone in the child‚Äôs life. Smith, Debra. \\"The Impact of Adoption on Birth Parents\\". Adoption.org. 1995. Reports show that a birth mother feels grief when she has more children because this evokes the memory of the child she gave up. If she is faced with future infertility, she may believe it is a form of ‚Äúpunishment‚Äù for relinquishing her parenting rights over a child. Many birth mothers continue to mourn the loss of their child but with varying intensity. Stages of grief It is not until a mother actually places her child for adoption that she experiences what Julie Axelrod believes is similar to the five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Inspired by Elisabeth K√ºbler-Ross‚Äôs On Death and Dying, the author attempts to show how those who have experienced the death of a loved one may be psychologically similar to a birth mother who has placed her child for adoption. The following occurs in each stage: =Denial= The overwhelming emotions that a mother feels making her feel numb to the situation. In this stage, reality has not set in. =Anger= This emotion is a manifestation of reality, the understanding of how devastating an impact the mother's decision has made on her and her understandable vulnerability. This may cause the mother to lash out to those closest to her. =Bargaining= The mother begins to rethink the decision she has made. She feels the need to regain control of her emotional state by attempting to bargain with a religious or psychological figure to get rid of her sense of guilt. =Depression (2 Types)= * =Acceptance= There is no real timetable as to when or if a mother will ever be able to accept her decision, but at this stage, she begins to feel at peace with her decision. She still struggles with the reality of the adoption but understands and truly believes that she was acting for the child's well-being. Identity issues Placing a child for adoption may also prompt identity issues in birth mothers. They may feel a desire to establish who the child will be in their lives and what role they will play in their lives. Birth mothers in open or mediated adoptions may be presented with more identity issues as they interact with the adoptive family. Placing a child for adoption does not mean a birth mother will never be able to contact the child. Adoption can include some communication between the birth mother and adoptive family. Both parties need to decide the level of openness for the adoption. Forming relationships post adoption Some birth mothers may have difficulty forming and maintaining relationships post an adoption. This could be because of persisting feelings of loss and guilt, or due to the fear of becoming pregnant again and repeating the process. Some birth mothers may try to replace the loss quickly by beginning a new relationship, or giving birth again‚Äîwithout dealing with the grief of the adoption. For some birth mothers, the capacity to establish a successful long- term relationship may be conditional on the openness with which they can relate their past experiences of the adoption to their partner. The eventual acceptance of this loss does not mean that a birth mother has forgotten the child, but instead means that she has integrated the loss into her life. Exploitation of birth mothers In underdeveloped nations, international adoption is commonly treated as a business where women and children are a commodity. This violates several standards and guidelines given by the United Nations. In many cases, reports from Argentina, Brazil, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Thailand, and other nations indicate that children have been placed for adoption after being purchased, indentured, or abducted from the birth mother. In one instance in Colombia, children were bought for $600 and sold for $10,000 with the use of illegal and falsified papers. In Honduras, it was found that to remedy inadequate prenatal care, many merchants pay teenage girls to get pregnant and monitor them to make sure they eat well and receive some kind of care. After the baby is born, $50 is paid to the birth mother in exchange for the healthy baby. While foreign adoptions provide several countries with much needed foreign currency, the exploitation of birth mothers raises several ethical and human rights issues. The lack of information on the circumstances involving the conception, birth, and the placement of a child poses a dilemma for women adopting internationally who have pro-choice views and yet quite possibly adopt from women who have little to no choice. Typically these systems involve persons with the language and literacy skills, resources, and social positions to interact with first-world adoption agencies and prospective adoptive parents. These persons send out scouts or recruiters to target and take advantage of poor families and mothers. Birth mothers are often induced with false promises of money, continued contact with their child after adoption, or even immigration to a first-world nation. In instances such as this, many legitimate, licensed agencies in recipient countries such as the United States, Canada, and Europe, adopt through these illegal channels without their knowledge, thus contributing to the flow of funds and the illegal undertakings of child trafficking and the exploitation of birth mothers.

The Blazers then capped off the season with an eight-game winning streak and their second national championship title win against Northwest Missouri State University, 25‚Äì20.http://www.vstateblazers.com/news/2007/12/15/359.aspx?path=football This was the third straight championship appearance by the Bearcats, also the third straight time the Bearcats lost the national championship game. Dean is only the second head coach to lead his team to a national championship in his first season. Earle Solomonson accomplished this at North Dakota State University in 1985. 2008 saw the Blazers make it to the second round of the NCAA Division II playoffs and a 9‚Äì3 season, 6‚Äì2 in the Gulf South Conference. In 2009, after a 6‚Äì4 season in which they finished third in the Gulf South Conference, the Blazers did not make the postseason for the first time under Dean, and for the first time since 2006. Dean led the Blazers to an 8‚Äì3 record and back into the NCAA Division II playoffs in 2010, marking the third time in his four years he has led his squad to postseason play. After beginning the year unranked, the Blazers rose as high as #7 in the AFCA poll, before finishing the regular season ranked #17. In 2011, the Blazers had another 6‚Äì4 season and missed the Division II playoffs. VSU finished 4th in the Gulf South Conference in 2011. Valdosta had been ranked as high as No. 4 in the AFCA poll in the first weeks of the 2011 season. After a 2‚Äì2 start to the 2012 season, the Blazers won their next 10 straight games and defeated Winston-Salem State University 35‚Äì7 in the NCAA Division II Championship game in Florence, Alabama.http://www.gscsports.org/news/2012/12/15/FB_1215123614.aspx VSU finished second in the Gulf South Conference after losing to the University of West Alabama. Valdosta would defeat UWA after playing them again in the second round of the NCAA Playoffs. David Dean is the first football coach in Valdosta State's history to win two national titles. Dean left Valdosta State to coach a single, unsuccessful year as co-offensive coordinator at FBS program Georgia Southern; both co-coordinators were fired after one year.Georgia Southern fires offensive coordinators Dean, Gillespie, Savannah Morning News, December 4, 2016.

The growing population and urbanization in various cities of India were in need of a local governing body that can work for providing necessary community services like health care, educational institution, housing, transport etc. by collecting property tax and fixed grant from the State Government. The 74th amendment act laid down the type of formations of urban local governments and their activities. Other names for municipal corporations Municipal corporations are referred to by different names in different states (due to regional language variations), all of which are translated to \\"municipal corporation\\" in English. These names include Nagar Nigam (in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, and Haryana), Nagara Nigama (in Punjab), Mahanagar Palika (in Goa and Maharashtra), Mahanagara Palike (in Karnataka), Mahanagar Seva Sadan (in Gujarat), Pouro Nigom (in Assam), Pouro Nigam (in West Bengal), Pur Porishod (in Tripura), Nagar Palika Nigam (in Madhya Pradesh), Nagara Palaka Samstha (in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana), Nagara Sabha (in Kerala) and Maanagaraatchi (in Tamil Nadu). The Vadodara Municipal Corporation of the city of Vadodara in Gujarat is typically called by the name \\"Vadodara Mahanagar Seva Sadan\\" and the Greater Bengaluru Municipal Corporation of the city of Bengaluru in Karnataka is typically called \\"Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike\\". The detailed structure of these urban bodies varies from state to state, as per the laws passed by the state legislatures, but the basic structure and function is almost the same. Composition 500px The area administered by a municipal corporation is known as a municipal area. Each municipal area is divided into territorial constituencies known as wards. A municipal corporation is made up of a wards committee. Each ward has one seat in the wards committee. Members are elected to the wards committee on the basis of adult franchise for a term of five years. These members are known as councillors or corporators. The number of wards in a municipal area is determined by the population of the city. Some seats are reserved for scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, backward classes and women. A state can choose to constitute additional committees to carry functions of urban local governance, in addition to the wards committees. In addition to the councillors elected from the wards, the legislature of a state may also choose to make provisions for the representation of persons having special knowledge or experience in municipal administration, the MPs or MLAs representing the constituencies which comprise wholly or partly the municipal area, and/or the commissioners of additional committees that the state may have constituted. If a state legislature appoints a person from the first category to a wards committee, that individual will not have the right to vote in the meetings of the municipal corporation, while MPs, MLAs and commissioners do have the right to vote in meetings. Superlatives The largest corporations are in the fourteen major metropolitan cities of India, viz. Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Pune, Kanpur, Lucknow, Visakhapatnam, Surat, Jaipur and Nagpur. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) of the city of Mumbai in Maharashtra is the richest municipal corporation in India. Greater Chennai Corporation of the city of Chennai in Tamil Nadu is the oldest municipal corporation in India and second oldest municipal corporation in the world only behind City of London Corporation in United Kingdom. Administration The Mayor is the head of the municipal corporation, but in most states and territories of India the role is largely ceremonial as executive powers are vested in the Municipal Commissioner. The office of the Mayor combines a functional role of chairing the Corporation meeting as well as ceremonial role associated with being the First Citizen of the city. As per the amended Municipal Corporation Act of 1888, a Deputy Mayor is appointed by the Mayor. The tenure of the Mayor and Deputy Mayor is five years. However, in seven states; Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand; Mayors are directly elected by the people and thus hold the executive powers of the municipal corporations. Executive officers monitor the implementation of all the programs related to planning and development of the corporation with the coordination of mayor and councilors. Functions The Twelfth Schedule to the Constitution lists the subjects that municipal corporations are responsible for. Corporations may be entrusted to perform functions and implement schemes including those in relation to the matters listed in the Twelfth Schedule. * Urban planning including town planning. * Regulation of land-use and construction of buildings. * Planning for economic and social development * Water supply for domestic, industrial and commercial purposes. * Public health, sanitation conservancy and solid waste management. * Fire services. * Urban forestry, protection of the environment and promotion of ecological aspects. * Safeguarding the interests of weaker sections of society, including the handicapped and mentally retarded. * Slum improvement and upgradation. * Urban poverty alleviation. * Provision of urban amenities and facilities such as parks, gardens, playgrounds. * Promotion of cultural, educational and aesthetic aspects. * Burials and burial grounds; cremations, cremation grounds and electric crematoriums. * Cattle pounds; prevention of cruelty to animals. * Vital statistics including registration of births and deaths. * Public amenities including street lighting, parking lots, bus stops and public conveniences. * Regulation of slaughter houses and tanneries Sources of revenue * Water supply bills * Property taxes * Rents from municipal corporation-owned markets, houses, plazas, etc. * Taxes from commercial vehicles registered in the city * Grants provided by the respective state governments.

Weapon systems maintained by the center included the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile, High-speed anti-radiation missile, HARM Targeting System, Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, Joint Direct Attack Munition, Miniature Air-Launched Decoy, Sensor Fuzed Weapon, and the Small Diameter Bomb.Eglin Air Force Base Air Armament Center Fact Sheet The Air Armament Center was inactivated as an AFMC center on July 18, 2012, and its functions merged into the former 96th Air Base Wing at Eglin AFB. The new organization was renamed as the 96th Test Wing (96 TW) the same day as a subordinate command of the Air Force Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base, California. History On May 15, 1940, the Air Corps Specialized Flying School at Eglin Field was redesignated the Air Corps Proving Ground.\\"The 1944 AAF handbook, p. 357 It was redesignated Proving Ground Command on 1 April 1942. In 1989, Mueller said the AAF Tactical Center was designated earlier on 16 October and that it and the subsequent AAF Center were different commands. For example, he cites AAF School of Applied Tactics, c. Mar 1942 (redesignated AAF Tactical Center, 16 Oct 1942) then AAF Center, 1 June 1945. On 27 October 1942 the United States Army Air Forces established the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics at Orlando Army Air Base, Florida. The next year, it was redesignated as the Army Air Forces Tactical Center, on 16 October 1943. In the last days of the war, it was redesignated the Army Air Forces Center, and documentation of the period appears to indicate that the AAF Proving Ground Command at Eglin Field, Florida and the Army Air Forces Center at Orlando AAB were merged as Army Air Forces Center on 1 June 1945. The Air Force Center was the planned USAF unit for the development of tactical policy and procedures. The Air Force Center was to be the succeeding unit to the USAAF Army Air Forces Tactical Center, established on October 28, 1943, and which had become the Army Air Forces Center on 1 June 1945. Instead, the AAF Center merged into Proving Ground Command (PGC) to form a new Army Air Forces Proving Ground Command on 8 March 1946. The AAF PGC was redesignated the Air Proving Ground Command on 10 July 1946, and raised to major command status. The APGC was moved to the now renamed Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, on 1 July 1948. =Testing of weapons= APGC conducted realistic testing of new weapons as an independent organization, reporting directly to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force and advocating a \\"fly-before-buy\\" approach to acquiring new systems. Such a shift, however, remained a challenge, for the Air Force continued the \\"buy-fly-fix\\" process that had grown from the demands of the Second World War and undervalued the importance of timely independent operational test and evaluation. APGC attempted to simulate combat conditions during its tests. It also grew in size as it acquired the systems it tested. By 1956, Air Force regulations outlined an eight-phase test and evaluation process that did not include the APGC until phase seven. By that point in the acquisition cycle, the Air Force had often already fielded units with new systems that APGC had not yet tested. Not surprisingly, operators often experienced serious problems with these new, untested systems. This led to a misperception about the value of operational test and evaluation (OT&E;) and APGC. Had OT&E; taken place before production decisions and fielding new systems, there likely would not have been any question about the added value of independent OT&E.; As a result of the doubts about the value of APGC and cuts to the defense budget, in 1957 the Air Force stripped APGC of its major command status, reduced its budget and authorized personnel, and redesignated the Command the Air Proving Ground Center, and assigned it to the Air Research and Development Command. This action meant the Air Force no longer had an independent organization that specialized in impartial operational test and evaluation. Decentralized operational testing at the major commands occurred from 1958 to 1973. Major command emphasis was often on quick deployment rather than thorough testing and impartial evaluations. Although the Air Force streamlined OT&E; from eight to three phases during this period, OT&E; still came at the end of the acquisition process. In addition, as systems became more complex, and the Air Force moved to acquire systems quickly, the \\"fly-before-buy\\" approach fell by the wayside. The consequences became clear when a Department of Defense study found that 21 of 22 major weapons systems used in the Vietnam War from 1965-1970 suffered severe operational deficiencies. These results strongly stated the case for independent OT&E; in the Air Force. The AAC was a focal point for the acquisition of advanced weapons systems. The center carried out scientific research, system management, production, operational performance, business management, requirements definition, customer and engineering support, technology planning, materiel identification, and field support activities. While \\"fly-before-buy\\" has repeatedly proven its worth in thorough testing of systems and avoidance of later problems, the Air Force even in the twenty-first century remains severely hampered by a \\"buy-fly-fix\\" approach.

History The Priory of St. Mary at Hurley was founded in 1086 by the Norman magnate Geoffrey de Mandeville I as a cell of Westminster Abbey. The Priory was suppressed by Henry VIII in 1536 and ownership was transferred to Westminster Abbey. In 1540 Westminster Abbey itself was dissolved and the Hurley Priory property passed into lay hands. The main Abbey property became known as Lady Place. It was initially owned by Charles Howard, Esq., for three years, then by Leonard Chamberleyn, Esq., then by John Lovelace, Esq. It became the home of the Barons Lovelace. Lady Place was considered one of the great mansions in town, but it fell into disrepair and was demolished as uninhabitable in 1837. Surviving buildings The long narrow nave of the priory church survives and is used as the Hurley parish church. It has mainly Norman windows and doorways. To the north, the range of buildings containing the frater or monastic dining hall is incorporated into a private house. A probable monastic circular dovecote and a nearby larger barn, both to the west of the church, date from the early fourteenth century. The Abbey's former hostelry or guesthouse is incorporated into the Olde Bell Inn, one of the oldest still-working inns in Britain.

It was active from 1860 to World War II. History Italian irredentists were citizens of Savoy who considered themselves to have ties with the House of Savoy dynasty. Savoy was the original territory of the duke of Savoy that later became King of Italy. Since the Renaissance the area had ruled over Piedmont and had for regional capital the town of Chamb√©ry. The official language of Savoy was French since the 15th century,Honor√© Coquet, Les Alpes, enjeu des puissances europ√©ennes : L'union europ√©enne √† l'√©cole des Alpes ?, L'Harmattan, 2003, 372 p. (), p. 190. and was divided administratively in Savoie Propre (Chamb√©ry), Chablais (Thonon), Faucigny (Bonneville), Genevois (Annecy), Maurienne (Saint Jean de Maurienne) and Tarentaise (Mo√ªtiers). Vaugelas, a native of the duchy became one of the most renowned French linguists. In spring 1860 the area was annexed to France after a referendum and the administrative boundaries changed, but a segment of the Savoyard population demonstrated against the annexation. Indeed, the final vote count on the referendum announced by the Court of Appeals was 130,839 in favour of annexation to France, 235 opposed and 71 void, showing a questionable complete support for French nationalism (that motivated criticisms about rigged results).Wambaugh, Sarah & Scott, James Brown (1920), A Monograph on Plebiscites, with a Collection of Official Documents, New York: Oxford University Press, p. 599 At the beginning of 1860, more than 3000 people demonstrated in Chamb√©ry against the annexation to France rumours. On 16 March 1860, the provinces of Northern Savoy (Chablais, Faucigny and Genevois) sent to Victor Emmanuel II, to Napoleon III, and to the Swiss Federal Council a declaration - sent under the presentation of a manifesto together with petitions - where they were saying that they did not wish to become French and shown their preference to remain united to the Kingdom of Sardinia (or be annexed to Switzerland in the case a separation with Sardinia was unavoidable).Section: our country, Savoy / History The Italian unification process was done even with the loss in 1860 of the Savoy province of the Kingdom of Sardinia. Savoy is located northwest in the map, on the upper left corner Giuseppe Garibaldi complained about the referendum that allowed France to annex Savoy and Nice, and a group of his followers (between the Italian Savoyards) took refuge in Italy in the following years. With a 99.8% vote in favour of joining France, there were allegations of vote-rigging The Times (April 28 1860): Universal suffrage in Savoy Some opposition to French rule was manifest when, in 1919, France officially (but contrary to the annexation treaty) ended the military neutrality of the parts of the country of Savoy that had originally been agreed to at the Congress of Vienna, and also eliminated the free trade zone - both treaty articles having been broken unofficially in World War I. France was condemned in 1932 by the international court for noncompliance with the measures of the treaty of Turin, regarding the countries of Savoy and Nice. Indeed, in 1871 a strong break away movement appeared in north and central Savoy against the annexation. The Republican Committee of the town of Bonneville considered that \\"the 1860 vote, was the result of imperial pressure, and not the free demonstration of the will of our country\\" and called for a new Referendum: France sent 10,000 troops to Savoy to restore order. In 1861, the Associazione Oriundi Savoiardi e Nizzardi Italiani was founded in Italy ,Text (in Italian) of \\"Bollettino\\" from the Savoiardi association an association of the Italian Savoyards that lasted one century until 1966. During the fascist period in the early 1940s, organizations were created that promoted the unification of Savoy to the Kingdom of Italy. The fascist members were nearly one hundred in 1942, concentrated mainly in Grenoble and Chamb√©ry.Fascism's European Empire -By Davide Rodogno When Italy occupied Savoy in November 1942 these fascist groups claimed that nearly 10,000 Savoyards demanded the unification to Italy, but nothing was done mainly because the King of Italy opposed it.Vignoli, Giulio. Gli Italiani Dimenticati p. 130 After World War II all the organizations of the Irredentist Savoyards were outlawed by the French authorities of Charles de Gaulle. Most of the remaining Irredentist Savoyards supported in the 1950s and 1960s the development of autonomistic political organizations of Savoy, like the Mouvement R√©gion Savoie (Savoy Regional Movement). =Italian- occupied Savoy= The parts of Savoy under Italian control are highlighted in greenOnly in 1940 did the Italian Savoyards fulfilled their irredentism, and some small areas bordering the Alps were annexed by Italy. The initial zone was 832 km¬≤ and contained 28,500 inhabitants.Milit√§rgeschichtliches Forschungsamt. Germany and the Second World War - Volume 2: Germany's Initial Conquests in Europe, pg. 311 In November 1942, in conjunction with \\"Case Anton\\", the German occupation of most of Vichy France, the Royal Italian Army (Regio Esercito) expanded its occupation zone. Italian forces took control of Grenoble, Nice, the Rh√¥ne River delta, and nearly all of Savoy. A process of Italianization of the schools in Savoy was started, but was never fully implemented. Only a few Italian Savoyards were voluntarily enrolled in the Italian Army through fascist organizations like the Camicie Nere, most of them rejoined the resistance and fought against the invaders. Most of the Irredentist Savoyards actively helped the Jews in the occupied zone in Savoy, a region that acted as a refugee zone for Jews fleeing persecution in Vichy France during World War II.Robert O. Paxton. Vichy France, Old Guard, New Order. 1972 The projects to incorporate Savoy to the Kingdom of Italy were supported by the fascist Savoyards of Grenoble, but nothing was done even because in September 1943 Nazi Germany substituted Italy in the occupation of Savoy. The Savoyard dialect Savoyards historically have spoken a dialect related to the Arpitan language: the Savoyard dialect. Arpitan is spoken in France, in Switzerland and in Italy. However, French is the predominant language today. During the fascist occupation in 1940-1943, Italian authorities promoted a process of Italianization of all the people of Savoy, mainly related to the use of Italian in substitution of the Savoyard dialect.

Since 1984, the renovated station has housed the collections of the DeWitt Museum, including railway artifacts from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. History Incorporated in 1890, the narrow gauge railway's initial purpose was to haul logs from forests near Baker City in Baker County to a sawmill in South Baker City. By 1891, the line had reached McEwen, to the west, and the railroad began offering passenger and freight service. To reach uncut forests further west, the company extended the line in stages. It reached Sumpter in 1896 and continued southwestward to Whitney, Tipton, Austin and Bates. By 1910, it arrived in Prairie City, a ranching and mining community on the John Day River in Grant County. Ten years later, the railway began losing business to automobiles and trucks, and in 1933 the of track between Prairie City and Bates were abandoned. From then until 1973, the Prairie City Depot was used as a dwelling. Thereafter, the Sumpter Valley Depot Restoration Committee renovated the structure, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1981.

This was a very popular computer show held in The Horticultural Halls, Elverton Street, London, England. The ZX Microfair was a showcase for all manner of software and hardware related to the Sinclair range of computers. The software was also first advertised as a small classified advert in QL World magazine, but soon became a flagship product for the company formed to sell it, Sector Software. Touch Typist soon went on sale in WH Smiths as well as in many smaller computer shops which were supplied by the now defunct company Terry Blood Distribution Ltd. The software was originally written in QL Basic on the Sinclair QL, this was compiled with the Digital Precision Superbasic Compiler and released on Sinclair Microdrive cartridges for the Sinclair QL computer. Microdrive cartridges were small cartridges similar to an 8 track tape, with a continuous loop of tape which could hold 100KB of code. The software was soon converted to run on other computers including the Atari ST, Commodore AmigaAdvertisement:Page 24:Sector Software, Amiga Shopper - Issue 17 (1992-09)(Future Publisher], Acorn Archimedes, Cambridge Computers Z88 Portable computer and Microsoft Windows based computers. Touch Typist has been on continuous sale and been continually developed by the original author David Batty and is still published by the original company, Sector Software of Leyland Lancashire.http://www.typingtutor.co.ukhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/davidbatty The current version of the software is written in Microsoft Visual Basic, versions for other platforms have all been written in other versions of compiled BASIC. The software features very short lessons, each less than 55 characters long. With feedback after every lesson. The very short lessons with plenty of feedback give the software a 'game' feel. The first version of the software had a Space Invaders game built into it that the users were allowed to play once for every 20 lessons they completed. The Sinclair QL had 128KB of memory, but after the operating system had taken its share of it, only 97KB were left for programs to run. Touch Typist was 95K in size so there was only 2KB of memory left in which to add a game. In order to include a game without losing anything from the software, a space invaders game was written in MC68000 machine code, the whole game and graphics took just 2K of memory. The game was removed in second and subsequent versions after requests from various schools who were using the software, for a version without an arcade game in it. The software is currently sold to schools, colleges, businesses and private individuals around the world from its website. The software is distributed either on a CD for Microsoft Windows-based machines, or via a download and on-line unlocking method.

The band's founder Marcelo Barbosa (guitars) is the owner of GTR, a large guitar institute in Bras√≠lia, and currently is a member of Angra and Almah. Biography Khallice started in Bras√≠lia, Distrito Federal in 1994 as a cover band (playing Rush, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple), but very soon the musicians began to create their own music. The band released two demos. The first demo of the band was done in their native Portuguese. Then they recorded the song Madman Lullaby, an English version of Balada do Louco (a hit of the Brazilian band Os Mutantes from the 1970s) for a Tribute CD to former Mutantes member, Arnaldo Baptista. The second demo Prophecy \\"was received very well by the local fans, fanzines and professional magazines from all over Brazil\\" In June 1999 Al√≠rio Netto, who played the part of Jesus in the Brazilian and Mexican casts of Jesus Christ Superstar joined the band as a lead vocalist. He replaced Mario Linhares who had left the band. But due to his occupation in the rock opera he could really start his work with Khallice only at the end of 2001. Finally Khallice established stable line-up and finished writing the stuff for their first album, The Journey. The band's line-up at that time consisted of Marcelo Barbosa (guitars), Al√≠rio Netto (vocals), Michel Marciano (bass), C√©sar Zolhof (drums), Bruno Wambier (keyboards). The Journey was recorded in November 2001 ‚Äì August 2002 in Zen Studio, Bras√≠lia and included new tunes and rebuilt versions of songs written since the beginning of the band. All the songs were created by Marcelo Barbosa and Bruno Wambier. There were some progressive metal songs like Spiritual Jewel with some links and allusions to Dream Theater and classical progressive bands of the 1970s like Yes and metal hit songs like Vampire, Wrong Words, Thunderstorm and the title track The Journey. According to Thiago Sarkis, Whiplash.net observer, \\"The Journey play the same part in Brazil like Images and Words of Dream Theater is for prog metal worldwide\\". According to the review in Poppycorn.com Webzine: \\"The album includes 9 compositions with much virtuosity, a lot of guitar and keyboards solos and everything that the prog metal style offers\\". To the national release of The Journey Khallice played a concert with one of the most important rock bands in Brazil, Dr. Sin. With The Journey set-list Khallice played at big musical festivals like Por√£o do Rock and Bras√≠lia Music Festival (BMF), sharing the stage with artists such as Alanis Morissette and Simply Red. In mid-2005 the band is chosen by public vote to participate in the BMU Festival (Brazil Metal Union) conducted at Directv Music Hall in Sao Paulo. Part of this gig was recording a video, the line up is Al√≠rio Netto (vocals), Marcelo Barbosa (guitar),Michel Marciano (bass), Renato Gomes (keyboards) and Maur√≠cio Barbosa (drums). The first press of The Journey as a self-release was sold out in less than six months. In the beginning of 2003 it was re-released by Hellion Records and in 2007 an important progressive rock label from North America Magna Carta managed a worldwide release of The Journey. Marcelo Barbosa for PerfectProg Webzine (2006): \\"It happened in the beginning of this year. I went to the USA to play at NAMM and I met Greg Howe for the second time in my life. He gave some classes in 2005 and now I would like to take this opportunity again. I really like his playing, he's one of my favorites players in the world. So, I showed to him two songs of our new CD that were done at this time. He really enjoyed it and helped me with some contacts. Magna Carta was our best option\\". After some line-up changes, in the summer 2007 Khallice started recording of the second full-length album with the following line-up: Al√≠rio Netto (vocals), Marcelo Barbosa (guitars), Michel Marciano (bass), Pedro Assump√ß√£o (drums) and Renato Gomes (keyboards). At the end of January 2008 the band became one of the winners (among more than 500 participants) of a contest announced by Dream Theater to support one of their shows during Brazilian part of the tour supporting Systematic Chaos album. On 7 March 2008 Khallice played a gig in Citibank Hall in Rio de Janeiro with Dream Theater. It was another opportunity to gather new experience and to conquer some new audience. Specially for this show Khallice prepared Inside Your Head with 5 new songs from the upcoming second album. The EP included 3 typical prog metal tracks \\"Inside Your Head\\", \\"In The Fire\\" and \\"Share A Little Something\\" (with orchestral arrangements) and two metal ballads \\"Letting Go\\" and \\"Reasons\\". The cover artwork was created by Gustavo Sazes (Abstrata). The first 1.000 fans who assisted the show got copies of the new EP Inside Your Head. From the Metal Madman Webzine review (rating 9/10): \\"The production is now crisp, clear, heavy, and with a solid bottom end to it. Vocals are blended perfectly in the mix, and sound incredible. The harmonies alone make this EP worth checking out! What I like about Khallice is even though they are a progressive metal band its not overly done, and the songs flow very well with great catchy melodies, and rhythms.\\" At this point in the middle of 2007 the activities of Khallice were stopped for a while. The release of the second album was postponed due to Marcelo Barbosa's membership in Almah and the recording Fragile Equality studio album (2008) with the guitarist of Khallice.

This photo was taken in the old mass spec facility in Whitmore Lab of Pennsylvania State University. 235x235px A triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (TQMS), is a tandem mass spectrometer consisting of two quadrupole mass analyzers in series, with a (non-mass-resolving) radio frequency (RF)‚Äìonly quadrupole between them to act as a cell for collision-induced dissociation. This configuration is often abbreviated QqQ, here Q1q2Q3. History The arrangement of three quadrupoles was first developed by J.D. Morrison of LaTrobe University, Australia for the purpose of studying the photodissociation of gas-phase ions. After coming into contact with Prof. Christie G. Enke and his then graduate student Richard Yost, Morrison's linear arrangement of the three quadrupoles probed the construction of the first triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer. In the years following, the first commercial triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer was developed at Michigan State University by Enke and Yost in the late 1970s. It was later found that the triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer could be utilized to study organic ions and molecules, thus expanding its capabilities as a tandem MS/MS technique. Principle of operation Paul Patent 2939952 Fig5 Essentially the triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operates under the same principle as the single quadrupole mass analyzer. Each of the two mass filters (Q1 and Q3) contains four parallel, cylindrical metal rods. Both Q1 and Q3 are controlled by direct current (dc) and radio-frequency (rf) potentials, while the collision cell, q, is only subjected to RF potential. The RF potential associated with the collision cell (q) allows all ions that were selected for to pass through it. In some instruments, the normal quadrupole collision cell has been replaced by hexapole or octopole collision cells which improve efficiency. Unlike traditional MS techniques, MS/MS techniques allow for mass analysis to occur in a sequential manner in different regions of the instruments. The TQMS follows the tandem-in-space arrangement, due to ionization, primary mass selection, collision induced dissociation (CID), mass analysis of fragments produced during CID, and detection occurring in separate segments of the instrument. Sector instruments tend to surpass the TQMS in mass resolution and mass range. However, the triple quadrupole has the advantage of being cheaper, easy to operate and highly efficient. Also, when operated in the selected reaction monitoring mode, the TQMS has superior detection sensitivity as well as quantification. The triple quadrupole allows the study of low-energy low- molecule reactions, which is useful when small molecules are being analyzed. =Scan modes= Settings associated with selecting m/z values in both mass filters of a triple quadrupole mass analyzer The arrangement of the TQMS allows for four different scan types to be performed: a precursor ion scan, neutral loss scan, product ion scan, and selected reaction monitoring. Product scan In the product scan, the first quadrupole Q1 is set to select an ion of a known mass, which is fragmented in q2. The third quadrupole Q3 is then set to scan the entire m/z range, giving information on the sizes of the fragments made. The structure of the original ion can be deduced from the ion fragmentation information. This method is commonly performed to identify transitions used for quantification by tandem MS. Precursor scan When utilizing a precursor scan, a certain product ion is selected in Q3, and the precursor masses are scanned in Q1. This method is selective for ions having a particular functional group (e.g., a phenyl group) released by the fragmentation in q2. Neutral loss scan In the neutral loss scan method both Q1 and Q3 are scanned together, but with a constant mass offset. This allows the selective recognition of all ions which, by fragmentation in q2, lead to the loss of a given neutral fragment (e.g., H2O, NH3). Similar to the precursor ion scan, this method is useful in the selective identification of closely related compounds in a mixture. Selected reaction monitoring When employing selected reaction monitoring (SRM) or multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) modes, both Q1 and Q3 are set at a specific mass, allowing only a distinct fragment ion from a certain precursor ion to be detected. This method results in increased sensitivity. If Q1 and/or Q3 is set to more than a single mass, this configuration is called multiple reaction monitoring. Instrumentation Schematic of a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer In the TQMS, several ionization methods can be employed. Some of these include electrospray ionization, chemical ionization, electron ionization, atmospheric pressure chemical ionization, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization, all of which produce a continuous supply of ions. Both the first mass analyzer and the collision cell are continuously exposed to ions from the source, in a time independent manner. It is once the ions move into the third mass analyzer that time dependence becomes a factor. The first quadrupole mass filter, Q1, is the primary m/z selector after the sample leaves the ionization source. Any ions with mass-to-charge ratios other than the one selected for will not be allowed to infiltrate Q1. The collision cell, denoted as \\"q\\", is located between Q1 and Q3, is where fragmentation of the sample occurs in the presence of an inert gas like Ar, He, or N2. A characteristic daughter ion is produced as a result of the collisions of the inert gas with the analyte. Upon exiting the collision cell, the fragmented ions then travel onto the second quadrupole mass filter, Q3, where m/z selection can occur again. Because the triple quadrupole is a scanning instrument, the type of detection system it employs must be capable of detecting ions one m/z at a time. One of the most common detectors, the electron multiplier, is often paired with the triple quadrupole. The electron multiplier allows for faster response time, increased sensitivity and higher gain. However, they have a limited lifetime due to overloading. Employing the TQMS provides enhanced selectivity, better accuracy, and greater reproducibility; all of which are limited in single quadrupole mass analyzers. Applications The triple quadrupole mass spectrometer allows for increased sensitivity and specificity yielding lower detection and quantitation limits. For these reasons, employment of the TQMS is a vital asset in the fields of drug metabolism, pharmacokinetics, environmental studies, and biological analyses. In most drug and pharmacokinetic studies, animals like rats, are subjected to a new drug in order to probe how the substance metabolizes in the body. By analyzing the rat‚Äôs urine or plasma with a triple quadrupole coupled to liquid chromatography, the concentration and fragmentation pattern of the new drug can be determined. In environmental and biological studies, the triple quadrupole is useful for quantitative studies that involved identifying whether or not specific substances are present in a sample. One of the more common uses of a triple quadrupole mass analyzer is for structural elucidation, which provides information about fragmentation patterns. However, a mass spectrum only provides information about fragmentation, which isn‚Äôt enough information to fully deduce the structure of a molecule or compound. So for the purpose of structural elucidation, it is paired with data obtained from other analytical methods, like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy (IR), for a more accurate analysis.

The house was built as a country retreat by Junius Brutus Booth (1796‚Äì1852) from Plates 44 and 45, Design XVII, of The Architect, by William H. Ranlett, 1847. However, Booth never lived in Tudor Hall, because he died before it was completed. His son Edwin Booth lived there only briefly on his return from California before he moved the family back into Baltimore. But his other son, John Wilkes Booth, lived there with his mother, brother Joseph, and two sisters from December 1852 through most of 1856. After the family moved out, they rented the home to the King family and later sold it to Sam Kyle and Ella Mahoney. She lived in Tudor Hall for 70 years and opened a museum. After her death the house passed through a succession of owners, including the Worthington family, who owned the Aegis newspaper. Finally the house was sold to the Foxes, who reopened Mahoney's museum. Tudor Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. A modification to its listing, to decrease its boundaries, was registered in 1982. After the Preservation Association of Tudor Hall (PATH) collapsed, Tudor Hall was sold to the Bakers and later to Harford County, who are now in possession of the historic home.

In the Devi Mahatmyam The story of Sumbha and Nisumbha begins in the fifth chapter of the Devi Mahatmyam. Parvati relates how two brothers of Asura stock sought to conquer the Three Worlds by subjecting themselves to severe penance and purification rituals so that no man or demon could destroy them. Sumbha and Nisumbha traveled to Pushkara, a sacred place, and remained there in prayer for ten thousand years. God Brahma saw the brothers' penance, and was pleased, granting them the boon they requested. It was at this time that Chanda and Munda, two lesser Asuras in the service of Shumbha, encountered Parvati, and were overwhelmed by her beauty. They carried reports of this goddess to Shumbha, who sought to possess Parvati and her beauty. Shumbha sent the demon Sugriva to court Parvati, but she rejected his advances. It was then decided by the demonic brothers that if Parvati would not come willingly, they would have to abduct her. The demon Dhumralochana and his retinue of sixty-thousand Asuras were sent to abduct Parvati, but she took the form of Mahakali and managed to slay the entire army. Next, Chanda and Munda were deployed, then Parvati destroyed them. Parvati got the epithet Chamunda from destroying Chanda and Munda. Death After these encounters, Sumbha and Nisumbha had no choice but to meet Parvati in direct combat. Although Brahma's boon had granted the brothers protection against men and demons, no such protection existed against goddesses. Nisumbha was the first to fall, after assaulting Parvati's lion. After Nisumbha's death, a powerful demon emerged from his corpse, but Parvati managed to dispatch this monster as well, by decapitating it. Upon seeing the death of his brother, Shumbha went after Parvati in a rage, but was ultimately cleaved in two by the Goddess' trident. With Sumbha and Nisumbha gone, the Three Worlds returned to their ordinary state of being, rid of a great evil. In popular culture Some, such as John Stratton Hawley and Donna Marie Wulff, see Shumbha and Nishumbha as symbols of arrogance and pride which is ultimately overcome by Parvati's humility and wisdom.Hawley, John Stratton; Wulff, Donna Marie; Devƒ´: Goddesses of India. Published by University of California Press, 1996: p. 68 , In Shashi Tharoor's satirical novel The Great Indian Novel, the story of Sumbha and Nisumbha is used both as a warning against the dangers of seduction, and as a metaphor for the collapse of the relationship between the five Pandavas.Tharoor, Shashi.

Cross-reactivity should not occur between medications with an aromatic amine and medications without an aromatic amine (e.g., sulfonylureas, thiazide diuretics, furosemide, and acetazolamide); therefore, these medications can be safely used in the future.ACP Medicine Board Review from Medscape (2005) The hypersensitivity syndrome is characterized by a rash that is initially rash that appears similar to measles (morbilliform).James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.). Saunders. . The rash may also be one of the potentially lethal severe cutaneous adverse reactions, the DRESS syndrome, Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal necrolysis. Systemic manifestations occur at the time of skin manifestations and include a high number of eosinophils in the blood, liver inflammation, and interstitial nephritis. However, a subgroup of patients may become hypothyroid as part of an autoimmune thyroiditis up to 2 months after the initiation of symptoms. This kind of adverse drug reaction is caused by the accumulation of toxic metabolites; it is not the result of an IgE-mediated reaction. The risk of first-degree relatives developing the same hypersensitivity reaction is higher than in the general population. As this syndrome can present secondary to multiple anticonvulsants, the general term \\"anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome\\" (AHS) is favored over the original descriptive term \\"dilantin hypersensitivity syndrome.\\" As of 2015, two cases of AHS have been reported that manifested during long-term treatment with multiple anti-seizure medications. Death due to multiple organ failure can occur; symptoms also mimic lymphoma and AHS has been called \\"pseudolymphoma\\" as a result.

Its southern end is at Trinity Place, of which it is a continuation, and its northern end is at Canal Street. Description Trinity Place branches off Greenwich Street at Morris Street, running uptown to the northeast, passing west of Trinity Church, the Trinity and United States Realty Buildings, and Zuccotti Park. At Liberty Street it becomes Church Street, which forms the eastern boundary of the World Trade Center to Vesey Street. At Franklin Street, a few blocks south of Canal Street, Avenue of the Americas (Sixth Avenue) branches off. Trinity Place, Church Street, and Avenue of the Americas form a continuous northbound through-route from Lower Manhattan to Central Park. Church Street is named after Trinity Church, a historic Gothic-style parish church on Broadway at Wall Street. Extended in 1784, Church Street was in existence as early as 1761. Part of the street was owned by the church, but was given to the city in 1804. Trinity Place is also a namesake of the church, being named so in 1834, prior to which it was known at various times as \\"Lumber Street\\" and \\"Lombard Street\\". Before 1869, the south end of Church Street was at Fulton Street, three blocks north of Trinity Place.Perris, William. Maps of the City of New-York. Third Edition. Volume 1. Title page and volume key (New York: Perris & Browne, 1857) Then, over several years, an 80-foot wide connection was cut through the intervening blocks and Trinity Place was widened to and extended south to Morris Street; Church Street north of Fulton Street was left wide at the time. The work, plagued by delays and allegedly corruption, was completed by the end of 1872.See: *Insurance Maps of the City of New York Surveyed and Published by Sanborn‚ÄìPerris Map Co., Limited. Volume 1. (New York: 1894). Volume key and Plate 7.   In June 1878 an elevated railway line, the IRT Sixth Avenue Line, opened. It ran on Trinity Place and Church Street to Murray Street, where it turned west and then north on West Broadway. It closed in 1938 and was razed the following year.See: *, \\"Elevated railways\\", paragraphs 2 and 7.  As part of the construction of the Eighth Avenue subway line, from 1929 to 1932 Church Street was widened between Fulton Street and Franklin Street from 40 feet including 10-foot sidewalks, to 90 feet including 15-foot sidewalks. Only the west property line was moved; the east side of the street was left intact. Places The Church Street Station post office at 90 Church Street serves the 10048 ZIP code as well as the surrounding area, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), as is the Canal Street Station post office at the north end of Church Street. Just south of the latter is the former Long Distance Building of the American Telephone & Telegraph Company, at 32 Avenue of the Americas, also known as 310‚Äì322 Church Street, a New York City designated landmark (NYCL). The Cary Building and St. Peter's Church are both New York City landmarksSee:  also listed on the NRHP. Church Street borders the rear of the 1765 St. Paul's Chapel, another NYC landmark on the NRHP as well as a U.S. National Historic Landmark (NHL). Also notable are the residential towers at 30 Park Place and 56 Leonard Street, and the former AT&T; Long Lines Building at 33 Thomas Street. Near Rector Street, Trinity Place passes under the Trinity Place bridge. Designed by LHP Architects and completed in 1989, the bridge is a private elevated walkway which formerly connected the rear side of Trinity Church to its offices and preschool in the Trinity Court Building across Trinity Place. That building has been demolished, and its replacement is currently under construction, with the opening expected in 2020. The bridge has been preserved and will return to use at that time.

Among the most notable writers to appear in its pages was Michael Gold, the author of the novel Jews Without Money. The newspaper made significant political contributions related to the formation of the International Fur and Leather Workers Union, as well as many of the needle trades unions in the United States, including the Amalgamated Clothing Workers union, and perhaps the Congress of Industrial Organizations (which later merged with the AFL as the AFL-CIO). Following Moissaye Olgin's sudden death in November 1939, the Freiheit was headed by Paul Novick (1891-1989), a journalist born in Brest- Litovsk who had first come to America in 1913.Srebrnik, Dreams of Nationhood, pg. 16.

The organizing Students of the EBS Symposium engage in different positions such as member, Head, and chair positions, working on a well-organized event during the first year of their studies. They are supported by the ‚ÄúWirtschaftsrat‚Äù, former chairmen, as well as EBS alumni and representatives of renowned companies, to ensure that knowledge based on experience is used and implemented.  History  In 1989, three student initiatives founded the economic symposium under the name of ‚ÄúPro 90‚Äù. The idea and goal behind this event was the convergence and entering into dialog of students of different branches of study and representatives of politics, science and economics. The first EBS Symposium was conducted under the topic of ‚ÄúMade in Germany ‚Äì a term to be redefined‚Äù and received fantastic responses from students and participants alike. From then on, the students' aim was to establish their project as a fixed annual event at the European Business School (EBS) - and they succeeded. For the first time, in 1992, the ‚ÄúBankenforum‚Äù was organized by students. This international event focused its attention on financial issues. With students from the first and second semester organizing the event and bringing in of new ideas and fresh concepts, they are supported by the ‚ÄúWirtschaftsrat‚Äù, former chairmen, as well as EBS alumni and representatives of renowned companies, who ensure that knowledge based on experience is used and implemented In 2008, under the patronage of Thomas Enders, the 19th Symposium took place with about 1,500 participants, including 200 representatives of several companies.

At Montrose Asylum (1834‚Äì1838) in Angus and at the Crichton Royal in Dumfries (1838‚Äì1857), Browne introduced activities for patients including writing, group activity and drama, pioneered early forms of occupational therapy and art therapy, and initiated one of the earliest collections of artistic work by patients in a psychiatric hospital. In an age which rewarded self-control, Browne encouraged self-expression and may thus be counted alongside William Tuke, Vincenzo Chiarugi and John Conolly as one of the pioneers of the moral treatment of mental illness. Sociologist Andrew Scull Scull, Andrew (1991) The Asylum as Utopia: W.A.F. Browne and the Mid-Nineteenth Century Consolidation of Psychiatry London: Tavistock/Routledge has identified Browne's career with the institutional climax of nineteenth century psychiatry. In 1857, Browne was appointed Commissioner in Lunacy for Scotland and, in 1866, he was elected President of the Medico-Psychological Association, now the Royal College of Psychiatrists. He was the father of the eminent psychiatrist James Crichton- Browne. Browne's enthusiasm for phrenology convinced him that mind and consciousness were aspects of brain activity. Early life Browne was the son of an army officer ‚Äì Lieutenant William Browne of the Cameronian Regiment ‚Äì who drowned in a troopship disaster (the Aurora on the Goodwin Sands) in December 1805. After this upheaval, Browne was brought up on his maternal grandparents' farm at Polmaise, near Stirling, attending Stirling High School and Edinburgh University. As a medical student, Browne was fascinated by phrenology and Lamarckian evolution, joining the Edinburgh Phrenological Society on 1 April 1824, and taking an active part in the Plinian Society with Robert Edmond Grant and Charles Darwin in 1826 and the Spring of 1827. Here, Browne presented materialist concepts of the mind as a process of the brain. Browne's amalgamation of phrenology with Lamarckian concepts of evolution anticipated ‚Äì by some years ‚Äì the approach of Robert Chambers in his Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation (1844). The furious arguments which Browne provoked at the Plinian Society in 1826/1827 gave ample warning to Charles Darwin, then aged 17/18, of the growing tensions between science and religious beliefs. Student atheism and radicalism As a medical student, Browne was a Radical and an atheist, welcoming the changes in revolutionary France, and supporting democratic reform to overturn the Church, monarchy, and aristocracy. In addition, Browne was an outspoken advocate of phrenology which George and Andrew Combe had developed into a form of materialism, asserting that the mind was an outcome of material properties of the brain. Through phrenological meetings, Browne became acquainted with a remarkable group of secular and interdisciplinary thinkers, including Hewett Cottrell Watson (an evolutionary thinker and friend of Charles Darwin), William Ballantyne Hodgson and Robert Chambers, author of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation. His interest in natural history led to his membership of the Plinian Society, where he took part in vigorous debates concerning phrenology and early evolutionary theories and became one of the five joint presidents of this student club. The leader of the phrenologists, George Combe, toasted Browne for his success in popularising phrenology with other medical students. Browne presented Plinian papers on various subjects, including plants he had collected, the habits of the cuckoo, the aurora borealis, and ghosts. On 21 November 1826, he proposed Charles Darwin for membership of the Plinian Society. On the same evening, Browne announced a paper which he presented in December 1826, contesting Charles Bell's Anatomy and Philosophy of Expression. Bell, the son of a clergyman and an enormously influential neurologist, claimed, in line with the principles of natural theology, that the Creator had endowed human beings with a unique facial musculature which enabled them to express their higher moral nature in a way which was impossible in animals. Bell's aphorism on the subject was: Browne argued that these anatomical differences were lacking and that such essential differences between human beings and animals did not exist. Forty-five years later, Darwin pursued an identical argument in his The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872), confiding in Alfred Russel Wallace that one of his main purposes was to discredit the slippery rhetoric of Sir Charles Bell. Later, at a Plinian meeting on 27 March 1827, Browne followed Darwin's paper on marine invertebrates and Dr Robert Edmund Grant's exposition on sea-mats with a presentation that mind and consciousness were simply aspects of brain activity. This programme of three papers presented an ascending view of life's complexities from the marine invertebrates beloved of Grant to the ultimate mysteries of human consciousness, all on a scientific platform of evolutionary development. In addition, Browne appeared to present a view of the world which was politically and morally at odds with the opinions of the educational establishment. A furious debate ensued, and subsequently someone (probably the crypto-Lamarckian Robert Jameson, Regius Professor of Natural History) took the extraordinary step of deleting the minutes of this heretical part of the discussion. The deletion, however, was incomplete and has allowed a final restoration of the discussion. The extreme impact of these events is indicated by the fact that a friend of Browne's - John Coldstream - developed an emotional disturbance which his doctor attributed to his being After graduating at Edinburgh, Browne travelled to Paris and studied psychiatry with Jean-√âtienne Dominique Esquirol at the Salp√™tri√®re. Early psychiatric career Browne became a physician at Stirling in 1830, and gave lectures on physiology and zoology at the Edinburgh Association which was formed in 1832 by the town's tradesmen. He also travelled in continental Europe. In 1832‚Äì1834, Browne published a lengthy paper in the Phrenological Journal concerning the relationship of language to mental disorder and in 1834 he was appointed superintendent of Montrose Lunatic Asylum. On 24 June 1834, Browne married Magdalene Balfour, from one of Scotland's foremost scientific families and sister of John Hutton Balfour (1808‚Äì1884), and they were to have eight children, the second of whom was James Crichton-Browne (1840‚Äì1938), an eminent psychiatrist of the later Victorian period. Browne gave frequent lectures on the reform of mental institutions, often expressing himself in surprisingly political/reformist terms ‚Äì like a sociological visionary. In 1837, five lectures he had delivered before the Managers of Montrose Lunatic Asylum were published under the title What Asylums Were, Are, and Ought To Be, setting out his ideas of the ideal asylum of the future and, in many ways, Browne sought to arrest ‚Äì or even to reverse ‚Äì the social consequences of the widespread industrialisation which had disrupted the Scottish culture of his childhood. In this enormously influential book, Browne agreed with the contemporary perception that insanity was associated with the social upheavals consequent upon the industrial revolution ‚Äì and claimed that insanity was increasing because In some ways, Browne anticipated the French psychiatrist B√©n√©dict Morel whose clinical theories of degeneration were published in his 1857 masterpiece Treatise on Degeneration. Browne - rather surprisingly - supported the idea that insanity was most prevalent amongst the highest rank of society and he concluded that \\"the agricultural population..... is to a great degree exempt from insanity\\". He speculated that insanity was common in America because He also suggested that the higher incidence of mental illness amongst women was the result of inequalities and poorer education. On the basis of his studies of inmates of his hospital, he asserted that those canonised in the past as saints for their hyperactive organ of veneration would now be categorised as insane. Crichton Royal: Moral Treatment and Therapeutic Approaches Browne was a passionate advocate of the moral treatment of the insane and he hated any suggestion of prejudice against the mentally ill. In 1838 the wealthy philanthropist Elizabeth Crichton persuaded Browne to accept the position of physician superintendent of her newly constructed Crichton Royal Hospital in Dumfries. Here he encouraged his patients with writing, art and drama and a host of other activities, long anticipating the clinical approaches of occupational therapy and art therapy. He made regular records of his patients' dreams, and of their social activities and groupings. Elizabeth Crichton would have monthly meetings with him. In 1855, the Crichton was visited by the celebrated American reformer Dorothea Dix and she seems to have struck up a positive relationship with Magdalene Browne, taking an interest in her traditional Scottish cuisine, before moving on to her Edinburgh friends, Mr and Mrs Robert Chambers. Browne remained at the Crichton until 1857 when his outstanding reputation resulted in his appointment as the first Medical Commissioner to the Scottish asylums. In 1866, he was elected President of the Medico-Psychological Association, and he used his Presidential Address as an opportunity to spell out (at considerable length) his concepts of medical psychology. In 1870, while visiting asylums in East Lothian, Browne was involved in a road accident which resulted in his resignation as Commissioner in Lunacy, and, later, in increasing problems with his eyesight. He may have been suffering some ophthalmic problems, probably glaucoma, from years earlier. Browne retired to his home in Dumfries and worked on a series of medico-literary projects, including the Religio Psycho-Medici (1877) in which he re-explored the territories of psychopathology and the religious outlook. Towards the end of his career, Browne returned to the relationships of language, psychosis and brain injury in his 1872 paper Impairment of Language, the Result of Cerebral Disease published in the West Riding Lunatic Asylum Medical Reports, edited by his son James Crichton-Browne. At this time, Crichton-Browne was concluding a lengthy correspondence with Charles Darwin during the preparation and publication of The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. In 1839, Browne had initiated one of the first collections of art by mental patients in institutions, gathering a large amount of work which he had bound into three volumes, in many ways a forerunner of Hans Prinzhorn's Artistry of the Mentally Ill and the academic study of outsider art (art brut).Park, Maureen (2010) Art in Madness: Dr W A F Browne's Collection of Patient Art at Crichton Royal Institution, Dumfries Dumfries and Galloway Health Board. A paper by Browne on Mad Artists was published in 1880 in the Journal of Psychological Medicine and Mental Pathology, setting out his views on mental illness and the effect it had on established artists. Browne's last years were clouded by the death of his wife in January 1882 and by his increasing blindness; but he lived to hear of his son's achievements in medical psychology rewarded by his election ‚Äì in 1883 ‚Äì as a Fellow of the Royal Society. W.A.F. Browne's legacy Universally regarded as a superb asylum superintendent and as a distinguished President of the Medico- Psychological Association (1866), Browne's reputation rested substantially on his achievements as an asylum reformer ‚Äì with an acute responsiveness to the psychological lives of his patients. Browne's early writings on asylum management ‚Äì including his celebrated What Asylums Were, Are and Ought To Be ‚Äì brought him international recognition, with honorary doctorates from Heidelberg and Wisconsin. He was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Browne is now considered as an important influence ‚Äì along with Robert Grant ‚Äì on the youthful Charles Darwin as a medical student in Edinburgh in 1826/1827. In December 1826, Browne delivered an inflammatory harangue to the Plinian Society concerning emotional expression ‚Äì contesting the Christian doctrines of Charles Bell. On 27 March 1827, Browne spelt out the full implications of a materialistic theory of the mind at the Plinian Society ‚Äì and the 18-year-old Charles Darwin was there to hear on both occasions. In this way, Browne was a pivotal figure in the mutual engagement of psychiatry and evolutionary theory. Browne's son, James Crichton Browne, greatly extended his work in psychiatry and medical psychology. In his correspondence with Crichton-Browne, Charles Darwin remarked ‚Äì during the preparation of The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872) ‚Äì that it should be regarded as authored \\"by Darwin and Browne\\".

These included but may not have been limited to the southern half of Northumbria. His background is obscure because of poor source documentation. The latter has facilitated disagreement amongst historians regarding his family and ethnicity. It is believed that he took over the position of ealdorman of York in 966, holding the position until his downfall in 975. He may have been the first ealdorman of southern‚Äîas opposed to a united‚ÄîNorthumbria, though an alternative tradition puts the division of Northumbria into two ealdormanries after his death. Little is known of his career as ealdorman, except for a legend that he escorted the Scottish king Kenneth II to the English royal court, and that he was expelled from England in 975. His life is unattested after this. He had one known son, but it is not clear if that son ever succeeded him. Origins Oslac's origins are unclear and no specific relationship with any previous known figure can be established from available sources. Oslac's name suggests to some historians that he was a Norseman. Dorothy Whitelock points out that the name Oslac is often an anglicisation of the Old Scandinavian name √Åsl√°kr,Whitelock, \\"Dealings of the Kings\\", p. 79 while the writers of the Biographical Dictionary of Dark Age Britain entry on Oslac comment that the name suggests an origin in the Danelaw, a suggestion supported by the fact that Thored, Oslac's son, held lands in Cambridgeshire.Whitelock, Dealings of the Kings, pp. 78‚Äî9; Williams, Smyth and Kirby, Biographical Dictionary, s.v. \\"Oslac ealdorman 963‚Äî75\\", p. 194 On the other hand Oslac is also a genuine English name, and the common Os element Oslac's name shared with the name of Osulf of Bamburgh, previous ealdorman of York, points to a connection with the Bamburgh family of the English far north.Fletcher, Bloodfeud, p. 44 Accession The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle recorded for the year 966 that Thored, son of Gunnar, raided Westmorland and that Oslac \\"took the ealdormanship\\".ASC D, etc, s.a. 966 Some historians take this to mean that Oslac became the \\"senior ealdorman of all Northumbria, including the territory of the high- reeves of Bamburgh.\\"William, Smyth & Kirby, Biographical Dictionary, s.v. \\"Oslac, ealdorman 963‚Äî75\\", p. 194 Records exist of Oslac witnessing charters as early as 963; this may mean he was ealdorman by 963, and would imply the death or deposition of his predecessor Osulf.Fletcher, Bloodfeud, p. 44; Rollason, Northumbria, pp. 266‚Äî7 Some of these charters are problematic as source documents, having been recorded only in later cartularlies; there is thus a possibility of interference in their transmission. Moreover, a charter dated 966 of a grant by dux Thored is witnessed by Oslac minister (i.e. \\"thegn\\"), suggesting that Oslac had not acceded to the ealdormanship of York before 966.Whitelock, \\"Dealings of the Kings\\", p. 78 Division of Northumbria De primo Saxonum adventu, an 11th- or 12th-century compilation from earlier sources, claims that after the death of Osulf Northumbria was divided into two parts: Eadulf Evil-child receiving the lands between the Firth of Forth and the River Tees and Oslac receiving the lands between the Humber Estuary and the Tees.Whitelock, \\"Dealings of the Kings\\", p. 77; Woolf, Pictland to Alba, p. 211; Arnold (ed.), Symeonis Monachi Opera Omnia, vol. ii, p. 382; Anderson, Scottish Annals, p. 77 According to John of Wallingford, King Edgar made this division during a council at York, in order to prevent the whole area becoming the inheritance of one man.Whitelock, \\"Dealings of the Kings\\", p. 77 The Historia Regum claims that such a division took place not in Oslac's time but Osulf's, and that the division line was the River Tyne rather than Tees; historian Dorothy Whitelock considered this to be apocryphal.Whitelock, \\"Dealings of the Kings\\", pp. 77‚Äî8 Career King Edgar of England, Oslac's lord and patron Oslac frequently attested charters of King Edgar the Peaceable, indicating that Oslac enjoyed some position of trust at court.Fletcher, Bloodfeud, p. 44; De primo Saxonum adventu claims that Oslac, along with Eadulf of Bamburgh and √Ülfsige Bishop of Chester-le-Street, escorted the Scottish king Kenneth II to the Wessex-based Edgar: > The two earls [Oslac and Eadwulf] along with √Ülfsige, who was bishop of St > Cuthbert [968‚Äî90], conducted Cinaed to king Edgar. And when he had done > homage to him, king Edgar gave him Lothian; and with great honour sent him > back to his own.Trans. Woolf, Pictland to Alba, p. 211; Latin text printed > in Arnold (ed.), Symeonis Monachi Opera Omnia, vol. ii, p. 382 This must have occurred ‚Äî if it happened at all ‚Äî between 968 and 975, i.e. between √Ülfsige becoming bishop and Edgar dying.Woolf, Pictland to Alba, p. 211 Richard Fletcher dated it to 973.Fletcher, Bloodfeud, p. 56 The historian Geoffrey Barrow believed this to mark the beginning of Scottish control over all the lands between the River Tweed and Firth of Forth (defining \\"Lothian\\" in this manner),Barrow, \\"Anglo-Scottish Border\\", pp. 121‚Äî5 though another historian, Alex Woolf, has suggested that the part about Lothian may have been fabricated later to give credence to the claim that the Scottish kings owed homage for lands in Lothian. Downfall and legacy In 975, not long after the death of King Edgar, Oslac was banished from England. No reason is given by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle's report of his expulsion.ASC MS D, E, s.a. 975; Version C of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle describes the events thus: > The valiant Oslac was driven from the country, over the tossing waves, the > gannet's bath, the tumult of the waters, the homeland of the whale; a grey- > haired man, wise and skilled in speech, he was bereft of his landsASC MS C, > s.a. 975 (c/f ASC MS B s.a. 975), translated Fletcher, Bloodfeud, p. 44; see > also William, Smyth & Kirby, Biographical Dictionary, s.v. \\"Oslac, ealdorman > 963‚Äî75\\", p. 194 The historian Richard Fletcher guesses that Oslac's downfall may have been the result of opposing the succession of Edward the Martyr.Fletcher, Bloodfeud, p. 45 Oslac is said by the Historia Eliensis to have had a son named Thorth, that is, Thored.Fletcher, Bloodfeud, pp. 70‚Äî1; Whitelock, \\"Dealings of the Kings\\", pp. 77‚Äî8 His successor was indeed a man named Thored, but it is not clear whether this was Thored Oslac's son or Thored son of Gunner; historians tend to favour the idea that Thored the successor was son of Gunner.Fletcher, Bloodfeud, p. 71; Whitelock, \\"Dealings of the Kings\\", pp. 77‚Äî8; Woolf, Pictland to Alba, p. 211; but compare Williams, Smyth and Kirby, Biographical Dictionary, s.v. \\"Oslac ealdorman 963‚Äî75\\", p. 194 The Gesta Herwardi tells us that his great-great granddaughter, Aedeva (Edith), was Hereward's mother.Gesta Herwardi Chapter 2 \\"... et mater Aediva trinepta Oslaci ducis ...\\" Notes References     * External links * Earls and ealdormen of York 10th-century rulers in Europe Year of birth unknown 10th-century births Year of death missing ","title":"Oslac of York"},{"id":"21165909","title":"The Dirty Tricks"},{"id":"21165914","text":"Russian vending kiosk in Waltrop Russian food at a supermarket in Herford Relative frequency of Russian citizenship at the district level in 2014 in relation to other foreign populations Relative frequency of Ukrainian citizenship at the district level in 2014 in relation to other foreign populations There is a significant Russian population in Germany (German: Deutsch-Russen or Russischsprachige in Deutschland).

According to the Global Commission on International Migration research, \\"In the 1990s ethnic Germans and Jews comprised the largest components of emigration, and the most attractive destinations were Germany, Israel and the United States.\\"Valery Tishkov, Zhanna Zayinchkovskaya, and Galina Vitkovskaya, \\"Migration in the countries of the former Soviet Union\\", Global Commission on International Migration, September 2005, 15. http://www.iom.int/jahia/webdav/site/myjahiasite/shared/shared/mainsite/policy_and_research/gcim/rs/RS3.pdf Between 1992 and 2000 Germany purportedly received 550,000 emigrants from Russia, 60% of the total amount emigrating to the three main destinations.

Article 116 of Germany's Basic Law, approved in 1949, provides individuals of German heritage with the right of return to Germany and the means to acquire German citizenship if they suffered persecution after the Second World War as a result of their German heritage. As a result, roughly 3.6 million ethnic Germans moved to West Germany between 1950 and 1996. These German descendants increasingly petitioned to return to Germany under the First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Nikita Khrushchev. According to historian John Glad, by 1957 the petitioners, commonly known as \\"Aussiedler\\" (singular and plural) or transferred settlers, filed over 100,000 applications a year to migrate to West Germany; several thousand returned in the 1970s.John Glad, Russia Abroad: Writers, History, Politics (Tenafly, NJ: Hermitage Publishers, 1999), 415-416. The flow of Aussiedler increased with the breakup of the Soviet Union. For instance, between 1992 and 2007, a total of 1,797,084 ethnic Germans from the former USSR emigrated to Germany. Of this total number 923,902 were from Kazakhstan, 693,348 were from Russia, 73,460 were from Kyrgyzstan, 40,560 from Ukraine, 27,035 from Uzbekistan, and 14,578 from Tajikistan.Stefan Wolff, \\"German and German minorities in Europe,\\" in Divided Nations and European Integration, edited by Tristan James Mabry (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2013). Also available at http://www.stefanwolff.com/research/germany-and-german-minorities-in-europe Numbers peaked in 1994‚Äì213,214 Aussiedler‚Äîand then gradually began to decline.Anlage 4 zum Integrationsbericht LK-GF 2008-06-09 Aussiedlerstatistik seit 1950 - Bundesverwaltungsamt [German], accessed 25 June 2014, http://www.gifhorn.de/pics/medien/1_1222325613/Anlage_4_Aussiedlerstatistik_seit_1950.pdf The number of non-German relatives who emigrated along with them is not known, but many if not most are presumably members of Germany's ethnic Russian community (see below). The number of emigrated Aussiedler fluctuates as many retained housing in the Former Soviet Union‚Äîsome are presumed to have returned to their residences in Former Soviet Republics. =Soviet Jews= After the Second World War Germany's Jewish population was 15,000, a small percentage of the country's pre-war Jewish population of 500,000.Ludmila Isurin, Russian Diaspora: Culture, Identity, and Language Change (Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton, 2011), 17. https://books.google.com/books?id=gcl9Zv- SuwYC&lpg;=PA6&dq;=third%20wave%20russian%20emigration&pg;=PA17#v=snippet&q;=Germany&f;=false That number grew to 30,000 by the late 1980s. Then between 1991 and 2005, more than 200,000 Jews from the former Soviet Union moved to Germany. In total, the Berman Jewish DataBank estimates that over 225,000 Jews from the Former Soviet Union (Russia and various republics) immigrated to Germany between 1989 and 2012.Sergio DellaPergola. ‚ÄúWorld Jewish Population, 2013,‚Äù in Arnold Dashefsky and Ira M. Sheskin. (Editors) The American Jewish Year Book, 2013, Volume 113(2013) (Dordrecht: Springer) pp. 279-358. Available at http://jewishdatabank.org/Studies/downloadFile.cfm?FileID=3113 Many, speaking Yiddish as well as Russian, picked up the German language easily. The Berman Jewish DataBank estimates \\"Germany's core Jewish population at 118,000 in 2013,\\" of which all but about 5,000-6,000 are post-Soviet immigrants; the community numbers about 250,000 if non-Halachic-Jewish relatives are included.\\" Growth began to diminish in 2005 when the German government replaced the special quota immigration law (Kontingentsfl√ºchtlingsgesetz) with more restrictive rules (Zuwanderungsgesetz) =Other Russian speakers= Other Russian speakers in Germany fall into a few different categories. The German Statistisches Bundesamt (Federal Statistical Office) reported the following figures for Russian speakers from the year 2000: legal aliens (365,415), political asylees (20,000), students (7,431), family members of German citizens (10,000-15,000), special workers in fields of science and culture (5,000-10,000), and diplomatic corps (5,000). The largest percentage comes from the \\"legal alien\\" category. The vast majority of the legal aliens, who are mainly ethnic Russians (with smaller numbers of Belarusians, Ukrainians, and other groups) are family members of returnees (Aussiedler and Soviet Jews), but who have yet to receive German citizenship. Integration into German society Most Russian-Germans have assimilated and integrated well into German society. As with most other immigrant groups, there remain some contemporary issues. German authorities have been concerned that the high number of Russian immigrants self-segregating in certain neighborhoods hinders social integration. This has led to restrictions on immigration from Russia and the former Soviet Union. Other issues have included crime, drugs, poverty and unemployment. The Aussiedler have raised many issues. Although they were expected to assimilate rapidly into German society, Aussiedler and their descendants are struggling with their identity, and most consider themselves Russian.Sch√§fer. \\"During the last 15 years far more than half a million children and youth have come from the countries of former Soviet Union to Germany. Lots of them got immediately German passports by descent but still feel as Russians.\\" In Russia, due to outside pressure, they had become assimilated into Russian society, in most cases speaking Russian as their first or only language, and this has made their return difficult.Furlong. Native Germans typically consider them Russian, just as they consider German- Americans visiting Germany to be American, despite their German roots. A 2006 study by the German Youth Institute revealed that Russian-Germans face high levels of prejudice and intolerance in Germany, ranging from low job opportunities, to problems in the real estate market.Sch√§fer. \\"Although Germany has become an immigration country educational or pedagogical support for young migrants is not very developed. They have low knowledge and information about the background and the needs of young migrants. They are expected to assimilate with the German society and to feel and behave like Germans do.\\" The same report also found out that most Russian-Germans still identify as Russian, rather than German.

Requirements  In racing series that are \\"production-based\\", meaning that the vehicles entered in the series are based on production vehicles for sale to the public, homologation requires not only compliance with a racing series' technical guidelines (for example, engine displacement, chassis construction, suspension design and such), but it often includes minimum levels of sales to ensure that vehicles are not designed and produced solely for racing in that series. Since such vehicles are primarily intended for the race track, practical use on public roads is generally a secondary design consideration, so long as government regulations are met. Sales aids (for example, the inclusion of luxury trim features, such as leather surfaces, audio systems, anti-theft systems), even where such accommodations are made, are generally barely within the limits of government requirements for sale to consumers, to minimize reduction in performance. Such accommodations are often reversible, so that production vehicles can be modified to racing trim. A common example of this process is the exhaust system, often modified in the production vehicle to meet legal requirements in the jurisdictions where the vehicle is sold. Since most production-based racing series allow some level of modification, including the removal of exhaust systems that reduce emissions at the cost of engine performance, vehicles that were produced and sold primarily to meet the homologation guidelines of a particular series are often designed for easy modification of such components. = Automobiles = Porsche GT3 RS. Many manufacturers of vehicles used in production-based racing (whether the vehicles were produced solely to meet homologation guidelines or as a genuine for-profit line) offer a line of high-performance parts not intended for use on public roads. Such components could include exhaust systems and engine internals, and are generally within the homologation guidelines of the racing series in which the vehicles are to be used. There is also a brisk after- market supplying components for converting production vehicles to race trim for production-based racing series. One example is lightweight, quickly removable bodywork, to replace stock bodywork that is often heavier and has features required on public roads, such as lighting systems. Some sports cars are released to the public for the express purpose of meeting the homologation guidelines of a particular series or several series. In such cases, numbers manufactured are often just enough to meet the minimum requirement for homologation by the racing series for which the vehicle was designed. And, the manufacturer often designates the car's status in the name, for instance the 1962-1964 Ferrari 250 GTO, \\"GTO\\" being the acronym for (in Italian) Gran Turismo Omologata, that is, a homologated grand touring sports car. This term is also used to describe various auto racing sanctioning bodies using the same set of rules for a certain class of cars. Homologation is most popular with the production based F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) Group GT3 class, where no fewer than 20 different race sanctioning bodies around the world use the same set of rules for this class. This allows the same car to be raced in different sanctioning bodies with no modification. = Motorcycles = Ducati 1098 S The same is true of most motorcycle racing series that can be considered production-based and include the various classes of such premier series as the AMA Superbike Championship or the FIM's Superbike World Championship. As with automobiles, motorcycle manufacturers manufacture certain models for the consumer market to enable the model to qualify for entry in a particular production-based racing series. One example of a production motorcycle that was designed and built primarily to meet the homologation requirements is the 2008 Ducati 1098R a limited edition version of Ducati's 1098 S sportbike. Ducati even refers to the 1098R, in the press, as the Homologation Special. Wherever any compromise was made on the 1098S for the purpose of making it a more street-friendly and consumer-ready vehicle (for example, reliability, rideability, economy), the 1098R's design makes a far more limited compromise or no compromise at all. An example is the displacementunlike the engine of the 1098S that has 1098 cc displacement, the 1098R's engine has a displacement of 1198 cc, allowing it to take advantage of the WSBK rulebook that allows up to 1200 cc for engines of the type found in the 1098 series.

It shows that the sheaf of relative differentials is stably isomorphic to an (n + 1)-fold sum of the dual of the Serre twisting sheaf. The Euler sequence generalizes to that of a projective bundle as well as a Grassmann bundle (see the latter article for this generalization.)  Statement  For A a ring, there is an exact sequence of sheaves :: 0 \\\\to \\\\Omega^1_{\\\\mathbb P^n_A/A} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\mathbb{P}^n_A}(-1)^{\\\\oplus n+1} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\mathbb{P}^n_A} \\\\to 0. It can be proved by defining a homomorphism S(-1)^{\\\\oplus n+1} \\\\to S, e_i \\\\mapsto x_i with S = A[x_0,\\\\ldots,x_n] and e_i = 1 in degree 1, surjective in degrees \\\\geq 1 and checking that locally on the n + 1 standard charts the kernel is isomorphic to the relative differential module.Theorem II.8.13 in Geometric interpretation We assume that A is a field k. The exact sequence above is equivalent to the sequence : 0 \\\\to \\\\mathcal O_{\\\\mathbb P^{n}} \\\\to \\\\mathcal O (1)^{\\\\oplus (n+1)} \\\\to \\\\mathcal T_{\\\\mathbb P^n} \\\\to 0 , where the last nonzero term is the tangent sheaf. We consider V a n+1 dimensional vector space over k , and explain the exact sequence :0\\\\to \\\\mathcal O_{\\\\mathbb P(V)} \\\\to \\\\mathcal O_{\\\\mathbb P (V)}(1)\\\\otimes V \\\\to \\\\mathcal T_{\\\\mathbb P (V)} \\\\to 0 This sequence is most easily understood by interpreting the central term as the sheaf of 1-homogeneous vector fields on the vector space V. There exists a remarkable section of this sheaf, the Euler vector field, tautologically defined by associating to a point of the vector space the identically associated tangent vector (ie. itself : it is the identity map seen as a vector field). This vector field is radial in the sense that it vanishes uniformly on 0-homogeneous functions, that is, the functions that are invariant by homothetic rescaling, or \\"independent of the radial coordinate\\". A function (defined on some open set) on \\\\mathbb P (V) gives rise by pull-back to a 0-homogeneous function on V (again partially defined). We obtain 1-homogeneous vector fields by multiplying the Euler vector field by such functions. This is the definition of the first map, and its injectivity is immediate. The second map is related to the notion of derivation, equivalent to that of vector field. Recall that a vector field on an open set U of the projective space \\\\mathbb P(V) can be defined as a derivation of the functions defined on this open set. Pulled-back in V, this is equivalent to a derivation on the preimage of U that preserves 0-homogeneous functions. Any vector field on \\\\mathbb P(V) can be thus obtained, and the defect of injectivity of this mapping consists precisely of the radial vector fields. We see therefore that the kernel of the second morphism identifies with the range of the first one.  The canonical line bundle of projective spaces By taking the highest exterior power, one sees that the canonical sheaf of a projective space is given by > \\\\omega_{\\\\mathbb{P}^n_A/A} = \\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\mathbb{P}^n_A}(-(n+1)). In particular, projective spaces are Fano varieties, because the canonical bundle is anti-ample and this line bundle has no non-zero global sections, so the geometric genus is 0. This can be found by looking at the Euler sequence and plugging it into the determinant formula > \\\\text{det}(\\\\mathcal{E}) = > \\\\text{det}(\\\\mathcal{E}')\\\\otimes\\\\text{det}(\\\\mathcal{E}) for any short exact sequence of the form 0 \\\\to \\\\mathcal{E}' \\\\to \\\\mathcal{E} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{E}\\\\to 0.  Chern Classes  The euler sequence can be used to compute the Chern classes of projective space. Recall that given a short exact sequence of coherent sheaves > 0 \\\\to \\\\mathcal{E}' \\\\to \\\\mathcal{E} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{E}\\\\to 0 we can compute the total chern class of \\\\mathcal{E} with the formulac(\\\\mathcal{E}) = c(\\\\mathcal{E}')\\\\cdot c(\\\\mathcal{E}). For example, on \\\\mathbb{P}^2 we find > \\\\begin{align} c(\\\\Omega^1_{\\\\mathbb{P}^2}) &= \\\\frac{c(\\\\mathcal{O}(-1)^{\\\\oplus > (2+1)})}{c(\\\\mathcal{O})} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= (1 - [H])^3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= 1 - 3[H] + 3[H]^2 - [H]^3 > \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= 1 - 3[H] + 3[H]^2 \\\\end{align}Note that [H]^3 = 0 in the chow ring for > dimension reasons. where [H] represents the hyperplane class in the chow ring A^\\\\bullet(\\\\mathbb{P}^2). Using the exact sequence > 0 \\\\to \\\\Omega^2 \\\\to \\\\mathcal{O}(-2)^{\\\\oplus 3} \\\\to \\\\Omega^1 \\\\to 0 we can again use the total chern class formula to find > \\\\begin{align} c(\\\\Omega^2) &= \\\\frac{c(\\\\mathcal{O}(-2)^{\\\\oplus > 3})}{c(\\\\Omega^1)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{(1 - 2[H])^3}{1 - 3[H] + 3[H]^2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ > \\\\end{align} since we need to invert the polynomial in the denominator, this is equivalent to finding a power series a([H]) = a_0 + a_1[H] + a_2[H]^2 +a_3[H]^3 + \\\\cdots such that a([H])c(\\\\Omega^1) = 1.

The company was founded in 2004 and is based in Roseville, California. ioSafe's storage systems are optimized for heat from fire and complete submersion in fresh or saltwater with the ability to recover data located on the disk drive inside. History ioSafe, Inc. was incorporated in 2005 by the primary inventor and CEO, Robb Moore. In response to independent research regarding data loss and catastrophic business loss from fire, flood and other natural disasters their first product (released in 2005) was the ioSafe S1, the first external hard drive to have both fire and flood protection. The ioSafe S1 hard drive was later redesigned and re- released in a dual drive RAID configuration called the S2. In 2006, in response to enterprise business demand for a fire and flood resistant network storage, the ioSafe R4 was introduced. Shortly after this NAS appliance entered production, ioSafe was granted and published patents in May 2007 for their FloSafe (fireproof) and HydroSafe (waterproof) technology. The company was purchased by Vancouver, Washington-based CRU in July 2018. This acquisition was a strategic combination of the hardware safeguards provided by ioSafe and CRU which could subsequently address the combined and non- overlapping customer bases of the two companies.

The rangers were present at the Battle of Tippecanoe, and served as auxiliaries to the army during the War of 1812. At the peak of their activities they numbered over 400 men. History In 1807, the Larkins family was travelling along the Buffalo Trace when they were attacked by a band of Native Americans. The father was killed, and Mrs. Larkins and her five children were taken into captivity.Wilson, p. 235. The incident sparked outcries for better protection along the route, and Territorial Governor William Henry Harrison organized the Rangers to provide a fast response to attacks, primarily as a deterrent to random American Indian raids.Allison, p. 241. The Rangers were modeled on the mounted troops used by General Anthony Wayne at the Battle of Fallen Timbers. The primary objective of the Rangers was to safeguard the Buffalo Trace, the main transportation route between Louisville, Kentucky and the Indiana Territory's capital of Vincennes, Indiana (and Illinois Territory), starting on April 20, 1807.Robinson p. 375. The first Indiana Rangers who patrolled the road in 1807 did so on foot. The Rangers had three divisions: Captain William Hargrove's 1st Division patrolled from the Wabash River to French Lick. The 2nd Division patrolled from French Lick to the Falls of the Ohio. One of their bases was at Cuzco, Indiana.Dean, p. 375. The 3rd Division secured an area East along the Ohio River to Lawrenceburg, Indiana, on the Ohio border. All Rangers were paid $1 per day, and were required to supply their own horse, ammunition, tomahawk, a large and small knife, and a leather belt. Although the mounted militia units lacked uniformity, the men-and sometimes women-were well trained. In keeping with their mission, the Indiana Rangers were involved in numerous incidents involving Native Americans. Native Americans and white settlers were considered to be at peace during this time, and the early Rangers were so effective that clashes between Native Americans and white settlers effectively ended. Harrison disbanded the Indiana Rangers in 1809.Allison, p. 242. As tensions between settlers and Native Americans increased, the Indiana Rangers were reactivated. Two Rangers companies were based out of Vincennes, Indiana. Prior to the War of 1812, Rangers under Captain William Hargrove found a British spy believed to be instigating Indian attacks upon Indiana settlers.Dean, p. 377. Attacks by American Indians became frequent in Indiana Territory. Some, such as the Pigeon Roost Massacre, are still remembered. During the war, the Rangers were used to augment larger armies. Colonel William Russell used the Rangers to supplement his infantry in the 1812 Peoria War, and General Samuel Hopkins utilized the Rangers in his Second Tippecanoe Campaign (1812), where several were killed at the Battle of Wild Cat Creek. In 1813, the federal government authorized an additional four Ranger companies to secure Indiana Territory. The new companies consisted of 100 men each, and as before, they armed and equipped themselves. The officers of the rangers were paid the same as those regular army officers of the same rank. Those with horses were paid a dollar a day, and those without horses were paid 75 cents a day.Barr, p. 316. Following the end of the War of 1812, the Indiana Rangers were discharged from military service in June, 1815.  Legacy  =People= John Tipton was a Major with the Indiana Rangers. One of the new ranger companies authorized in 1813 was commanded by Captain James Bigger, a veteran of the 1811 Battle of Tippecanoe, although he later had to go to court for recognition of his services with the Rangers. Another of the new rangers was John Ketcham, who built Ketcham's Fort and would later become a judge. John Tipton served as a major in command of two companies of rangers at Fort Vallonia during the War of 1812. He would later become a United States senator, and is the namesake of Tipton and Tipton County, Indiana. =Organizations= The Indiana Rangers inspired the creation of the more famous Texas Rangers.

Œ≤-Santalol comprises 20-25%.Sandalwood Essential Oil, http://scienceofacne.com/sandalwood-essential-oil/ Has references. The composition of the oil will depend on the species, region grown, age of tree, and possibly the season of harvest and details of the extraction process used.

It is also used in Ayurvedic medicine for the treatment of both somatic and mental disorders, including common colds, bronchitis, fever, urinary tract infections, and inflammation. In some cases, positive effects combatting ferret anxiety with sandalwood have been observed. A study investigating the effects of inhalation of East Indian sandalwood oil and its main compound, Œ±-santalol, on human physiological parameters found that the compounds elevated pulse rate, skin conductance, and systolic blood pressure. There is also religious significance associated with sandalwood oil and it is used in many different religions around the world, including Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Zoroastrianism. Production The oil is distilled from the wood of the entire tree including stump and roots. Australian sandalwood (S. spicatum) is unique in that the white sapwood does not require removal before distilling the oil, while Indian Sandalwood (S. album) does require removal of the sapwood prior to distillation.  Fragrance  Sandalwood oil is used extensively for its woody-floral scent. It pairs well with other wood or floral scents such as violet, rose, tuberose, clove, and oakmoss. But since the wood is so rare and expensive, cosmetic companies are now trying to find synthetic substitutes to try to imitate the structure and scent of sandalwood. There are several synthetic odorants with odor similar to sandalwood oil, used as lower-cost alternatives for perfumes, emollients, and skin cleaning agents. Two of these, Sandalore and Brahmanol, have been found to be agonists of the cutaneous olfactory receptor OR2AT4, with potential therapeutic benefits for wound healing.

The film, with a screenplay by Arthur Sheekman, starred Ethel Merman, Donald O'Connor, Vera-Ellen, Billy DeWolfe, George Sanders, and Walter Slezak. The film replaced \\"Washington Square Dance\\" with the older \\"International Rag\\", and interpolated \\"What Chance Have I With Love?\\" from Berlin's Louisiana Purchase (sung and danced by Donald O'Connor). A soundtrack album was released by Decca both as a 10-inch LP and as a set of three 7-inch EPs, and was released on CD in 2004 by Hallmark. The numbers \\"The Hostess with the Mostest'\\" and \\"You're Just in Love\\" are included on the Rhino Records CD set Irving Berlin in Hollywood. The film was out of circulation for many years but was issued on DVD in 2004. Merman won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy. Alfred Newman won the Oscar for Best Scoring of a Musical Picture, and Irene Sharaff was nominated for her costume design. Lang was nominated for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures by the Directors Guild of America and the Grand Prize at the 1953 Cannes Film Festival, and Sheekman's screenplay was nominated Best Written American Musical by the Writers Guild of America. Plot A wealthy Washington, D.C., socialite, Sally Adams (Ethel Merman), has political connections and is appointed U.S. ambassador to the tiny country of Lichtenburg, even though nothing in her background qualifies her for the job. A young journalist, Kenneth Gibson (Donald O'Connor), persuades her to let him tag along as her press attach√©. In the duchy of Lichtenburg, the arrival of Ambassador Adams does not sit well with some, particularly charg√© d'affaires Pemberton Maxwell (Billy De Wolfe), who is annoyed by many things, including her insistence on being addressed by him as \\"Madam.\\" A pressing issue in Lichtenburg is that Princess Maria (Vera-Ellen), niece of Grand Duke Otto (Ludwig St√∂ssel) and Grand Duchess Sophie (Lilia Skala), is about to have an arranged marriage to a neighboring land's Prince Hugo (Helmut Dantine), but lacks a sufficient dowry to make their union a fair bargain for both parties. Knowing her republic's penchant for foreign aid, Sally is approached by Prime Minister Sebastian (Steven Geray) about asking her friend President Truman for a loan of $100 million, to the consternation of Lichtenburg's foreign minister, General Constantine (George Sanders), who wants his country to be independent and self-reliant. Sally finds herself attracted to Constantine, while after a chance meeting in a department store, Kenneth has developed a very impractical romantic interest in Princess Maria, who finds him charming as well. In time, Sally returns home to Washington, where she belongs. At one of her social events, she is pleased to hear Constantine is among the guests, then disheartened at learning he has brought along a female companion. A happy ending for all ensues, however, when his date turns out to be Maria, who is willing to marry Kenneth and abdicate her royal title. Sally's future with Constantine seems assured, too. Cast Production O'Connor later said the film contained his best dancing. > We did some beautiful numbers.

That > was, for me, my best dancing. Reception Contemporary reviews were mostly positive. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times called the film \\"an admirable duplication of the show as presented on the stage. And in it, the wonderful Miss Merman is better than ever‚Äîin spades!\\" Variety praised the film as a \\"literate musical\\" with Merman \\"at her robust best with a tune,\\" though \\"in a few spots the editing could have been tighter.\\" Harrison's Reports called it \\"as entertaining a musical comedy as has been seen on the screen in many seasons.\\" John McCarten of The New Yorker was mostly favorable, writing: \\"There is no point at this late date in commenting on any performance of Miss Merman's. On this occasion, as usual, her voice is as big as all outdoors, her manner confidently low-down, and her sense of comedy remarkable. I'm not so sure, though, that the book of 'Call Me Madam' is varied enough to harness all her energy.\\" Orval Hopkins of The Washington Post wrote: \\"This is one you ought to see. There may have been better musicals, with better dancing, better books and better songs (there are a couple of Irving Berlin scores that beat this one, in my opinion). But they didn't have Ethel Merman.\\" The Monthly Film Bulletin called the film \\"a disappointment,\\" writing that Berlin's tunes were \\"not among his best\\" and that Merman \\"lacks variety.

Following damage sustained in an air attack in 1940, she was rebuilt as a cargo ship and renamed Empire Attendant. In 1942 she was torpedoed and sunk with the loss of all crew. History =Domala= Domala was the first ship in the British India Steam Navigation Company's fleet powered by diesel engines. She was built by Barclay, Curle and Company, Whiteinch, Glasgow and launched on 23 December 1920 as Magnava and completed as Domala on 14 December 1921. Her engines were built by the North British Diesel Engine Works, Whiteinch. Domala made her maiden voyage on 30 December 1921, arriving at Bombay, India on 27 January. A speed of was reported, consuming 17 tons of fuel oil per day. From Bombay, Domala sailed to Karachi, India before returning to London. Domala had accommodation for 158 saloon- class passengers and 11,000 tons of cargo. She was used on the service to and from Calcutta. On 6 October 1927, she collided with the British cargo ship in the River Humber, severely damaging her. On 12 August 1934, Domala ran into the stern of Thames Barge Shannon at Erith, Kent. In 1940, Domala was sent to Antwerp to collect a number of Indian seamen who had been repatriated by Germany. On 2 March 1940, off St Catherine's Point on the Isle of Wight, she was attacked by a Heinkel He 111H flown by Martin Harlinghausen. The bomber of Kampfgeschwader 26 dropped two sticks of bombs, setting Domala on fire. The order to abandon ship was given but the bomber machine-gunned the ship. A total of 108 of the 291 people on board the ship were killed. The Dutch ship Jong Willem rescued 48 survivors, despite being attacked herself. The destroyer and Avro Anson aircraft of 48 Squadron assisted in the rescue. On fire, Domala was towed to the Solent where she was beached between Hurst Castle and The Needles on 6 March. She was refloated on 15 March and on 19 March, she was towed to Southampton where the decision was made to convert her to a cargo ship. Surgeon Lieutenant MacDonald was Mentioned in Despatches for his zeal and devotion to duty, and skill in attending to the wounded survivors. For their actions Chief Officer William Brawn and Cadet Bernard John Duval, both crew on Domala, were awarded the King's Commendation for Brave Conduct. Cadet Duval, Merchant Navy was awarded the Lloyd's War Medal for Bravery at Sea;Lloyd‚Äôs List and Shipping Gazette, 18 March 1941. the citation reads: \\"The ship was attacked during darkness by an enemy aircraft, which dropped a bomb, putting the main engines out of action and setting her on fire. She also carried a number of lascars captured from various vessels by an enemy raider, who were being taken home. Many were hurt and some killed. At great risk to himself, Cadet Duval, a lad of seventeen, gave a fine example of bravery, doing all he could to save his second officer's life\\". As a result of the attack, questions were asked in Parliament by Manny Shinwell about the lack of use of the guns carried on Domala in her defence. Winston Churchill replied that the aircraft that attacked Domala had been initially misidentified as a friendly one, which was why the guns were not manned. A British destroyer also misidentified the aircraft. It was also asked why the gunners were not always manning the guns. In India, there was public anger towards Germany as a result of the attack. Eighty-one of those killed were Indian citizens. Domala was requisitioned by the Ministry of War Transport and renamed Empire Attendant. =Empire Attendant= Empire Attendant was entirely reconstructed. She was placed under the management of Andrew Weir & Co (Bank Line). Empire Attendant took part in a number of convoys during the war. ;HX 97 Empire Attendant was due to have been a member of Convoy HX 97, but did not sail with the convoy. ;HX 120 Convoy HX 120 sailed from Halifax, Nova Scotia on 10 April 1941 and arrived at Liverpool on 29 April. Empire Attendant was carrying a cargo of 350 tons of steel and also explosives. ;OS 33 Convoy OS 33 sailed from Liverpool on 1 July 1942. On 10 July 1942 reported that Empire Attendant had broken down for the seventh time and was straggling, being at least behind the convoy. At 03:30 hrs CET on 15 July, she was torpedoed and sunk by U-582 off the west coast of Africa at with the loss of all 59 crew. The crew are commemorated on panel 38 of the Tower Hill Memorial.

Members take part in a wide range of activities from hillwalking and sport climbing right through to winter climbing, Ski touring and alpinism. Due to the university calendar and its close proximity to reliable venues winter mountaineering is the main focus of the club along with hillwalking. Over the winter season the club prides itself as being one of the most active university mountaineering clubs in the UK and works with the mission statement: \\"To give the opportunity to participate in, and develop the skills for, safe mountaineering in all conditions.\\" The club has a long and distinguished history painted by famous names such as Tom Patey and Andy Nisbet, two of Scotland's most prolific new routers, who learnt their trade in the Lairig.  The \\"Golden Age\\" of the Lairig Club  For a period of time during the 1950s the Lairig Club was at the forefront of Scottish winter climbing with members setting new standards and developing new techniques in the sport. The Lairig along with other Aberdeen-based clubs; The Cairngorm Club and the Etchachan Club were responsible for the development and first ascents of most major venues and routes in the Eastern Cairngorms. The most active club members of this time were local Aberdonians Bill Brooker, Tom Patey, James Mike Taylor, Ken Grassick and Graeme Nicol. Notable achievements by the Lairig Club during this era include: Patey and Gordon Leslie's ascent of Douglas-Gibson Gully on Lochnagar in 1950, the first winter grade V climb in Scotland. In June 1952 eight club members made an en masse first summer ascent of Parallel Gully B, the last of the major gullies to be climbed on Lochnagar. Another Lairig meet in the December of that year saw the first ascent of The Scorpion another early grade V on Carn Etchachan by Patey, Taylor, Grassick and Nicol. First winter ascents of Mitre Ridge on Beinn a‚Äô Bhuird (V,6) by Brooker and Patey and Eagle Ridge (VI,6) on Lochnagar in four and a half hours by Brooker, Patey and Taylor proved that the Lairig really were at the head of their game. Even today with modern equipment and techniques these routes are still well respected and serious lines. Other than the first ascent of Raven's Gully in Glencoe by Hamish MacInnes and Chris Bonington in 1953 all the grade V routes in Scotland were confined to the Lairig's stomping ground of the Eastern Cairngorms in the early 1950s. Lairig members Patey and Nicol teamed up with Hamish MacInnes to climb the first grade V on Ben Nevis, in the form of the much prized first ascent of Zero Gully. Activity was not just limited to the high mountain cliffs and the club were also responsible for the early development of the North East sea cliffs. Several routes put up by Lairig members are now graded VS and above. The Sickle HVS 5b was climbed in 1944 by founding member W. T. Hendry and marked a huge advance in rock climbing standards. Routes such as Brooker's Arete and Nicol's Eliminate give clues as to who was behind most of the new routing in the 1950s. In 1966, the Lairig club built a Bothy refuge in the Garbh Choire complex to help facilitate the access to nearby ice climbing routes that were being developed. Throughout the period the club flourished, attracting students from the University who all shared a common love of the hills. Trips were organised every weekend to bothies in the North East such as Bob Scott's, Corrour and the Glas alt Sheil and occasionally a bit further afield. \\"A good day in the hills was just as important as a good evening back at the bothy with good friends\\" and this is still very much the ethos of the Lairig Club to this day.One Man's Mountains, Tom PateyCairngorms, SMCNorth East Outcrops, SMC  Death of Graeme Cooper and Richard Hardy  On 19 November 2006, Richard Hardy, 18, and Graeme Cooper, 23, tragically lost their lives whilst they were returning from a climb in the Coire an t-Sneachda area. They were part of a group of 10 other mountaineers from the Lairig who went away that weekend on a trip to the Cairngorms. Hardy and Cooper, left their group to climb a winter route by themselves, but the weather quickly deteriorated with winds of up to 120 mph and temperatures of -20C. The other group returned to the carpark at 8.30pm and went back to their accommodation, but the pair had not returned or responded to their mobile phones so the action was taken to call the emergency services at 10.30pm. The pair were found buried in snow the following day, approximately 10 minutes walk from the Cairngorm Ski Area car park and airlifted to the nearby Raigmore Hospital in Inverness. Neither could be saved, Hardy was found \\"frozen, unresponsive and unrousable\\". Their death was put down to lack of experience and preparedness. A 1-minute silence was held throughout the University of Aberdeen in their honour. An annual running race around Loch Muick is organised by the club to honour their memory and to help raise money for local mountain rescue trusts.  Committee Structure  Membership of the club is open to all students who are members of the University of Aberdeen Sports Council. The club is run by a committee of senior members who are elected at the annual general meeting and serve for one academic year. Positions on the committee are as follows: * Captain * Secretary * Treasurer * Safety Officer * Training Officer * Equipment Officer * Social Secretary The minimum number of members allowed in the club is seven.

The primary concern of the strategy was remaining neutral in any conflict between the two countries. Origins Plans for the scheme began immediately after the First World War. However, it was not greatly developed until the early 1930s,David J. Bercuson and J.L. Granatstein, \\"Defence Scheme No. 2\\" in Dictionary of Canadian Military History (Canada: Oxford University Press, 1992), 61 when James Sutherland Brown constructed a rough model of the strategy. The major tenet of Brown's model was the defence of the Pacific coast in the event of a war between the United States and Japan. General Andrew McNaughton would later transform the model into a commitment towards protecting Canadian neutrality. In 1933, the strategy was finalized, but it was not approved by the government until 1936.J. L. Granatstein, Canada's Army: Waging War and Keeping the Peace (University of Toronto Press, 2004), 171. https://books.google.com/books?id=jqxyhNcha3sC&printsec;=frontcover&dq;=Canada%27s+Army#PPA171,M1 (accessed January 19, 2009) Issues There were several issues that made the strategy of Canadian neutrality unlikely: =Attitudes= In Canada, there was an anti-Japanese and pro-American sentiment to contend with. It would have been difficult for the government to maintain neutrality and retain the support of citizens if it did not at least attempt to align with the United States. =Imperial ties= Because of Canada's imperial ties, if Britain decided to join the Americans in a war against the Japanese, it would be difficult for Canada to remain neutral. If Britain went to war, it would not include Canada by default since the Statute of Westminster in 1931 had transferred war-making powers to the Canadian Parliament, but existing ties would have made it likely for Canada to have been drawn in. (However, the Irish Free State, then a dominion within the British Empire, remained neutral throughout the Second World War. South Africa, also a dominion, also had internal challenges to a war with Germany. Dominion status was not, therefore, a guarantee in itself of military alliance with Britain.) That relationship had been untested since World War I and was intact until Canada declared war on Germany in 1939. If Britain joined in such a war, it would effectively destroy Canada‚Äôs policy of neutrality. =Proximity to the United States= The proximity between Canada and the United States made it only natural that there would be some overlap in the defence of territory. The United States was testing aircraft and flying through Canadian airspace to Alaska. If Canada allowed the United States to continue that practice, it was feared that it would lead to an unwanted situation. Effectively, Canada would be thus trying to avoid dangerous engagements between Japan or the United States.Galen Roger Perras and Katrina E. Kellner, \\"‚ÄôA perfectly logical and sensible thing‚Äô: Billy Mitchell Advocates a Canadian-American Aerial Alliance against Japan\\" The Journal of Military History, Volume 72, Number 3, July 2008. 816-817 Even though the American planes overhead were creating tension and a threat to neutrality, Canada was not willing to risk neutrality in a time of peace.

Five novels were written, all involving the trials and tribulations of a set of children attending primary school, and ending in high school in the fourth novel. The first novel begins in 4th grade and progresses by a grade each book until the 9th grade in the final book. These novels are unique because they are structured as if written by the actual children in the story themselves. The story is split into different sub-stories, all of which are written in first-person narrative from the particular character's viewpoint. In the beginning, the sub-stories were merely one or two pages long and included large black-and-white illustrations, but as time progressed, the stories became more complex in the way they were written. For the last two books, which were set in high school, the stories were around three to five pages long and contained far more text than the first three. This is used to signify the maturity of the characters after time.  Novels  = Primary school = *I Hate Fridays *It's Not Fair *I Can't Wait = High school = *Worried Sick *Messin' Around (novel)  Characters  The main characters, the ones who write the stories, are listed first. All other characters are listed by their first appearance in the books. = Main characters that write stories =  Peter Karlos  The first character introduced in the book. He is shown to be completely arrogant and holds a very high opinion of himself, believing himself to be more intelligent than all of his peers in the 4th grade. As the story progresses, it is shown Peter does not have any friends because of how much better he thought he was than everyone else. This then causes Peter to feel very worried or scared of going to school, out of fear of the way everyone will treat him. This worry stage is especially prominent in the book Worried Sick, hence the title. In keep with the essence of being better than everyone, a story written by Thadeus shows that Peter is a compulsive liar and an exaggerated one at that, after everyone in the class compares their houses, fathers, cars, etc. Peter has a younger sister, Sylvia, whom he finds extremely irritating and who constantly calls him Petsie. Peter gains the nickname Petsie for a short time after Sylvia walks into Peter's class with the wrong lunch. Most likely as retribution for how arrogant he was, a number of embarrassing or unfortunate things happened to Peter in the novels. This includes falling over during a race leading to his pants coming off, exposing his underwear which is believed to be Sylvia's panties due to their pink color, his mother coming along with him to the school camp, her being the only parent there, and a horrible vacation to Disneyland in which everything that could go wrong did, such as Sylvia throwing up on the plane ride there or getting to the actual Disneyland park half an hour before it closes thanks to ill-conceived advice from a stewardess on the plane. Peter submits a creative writing essay about his trip to Disneyland to Mrs Smith in It's Not Fair and it is chosen as the best for that term; however, nobody believes he even went to Disneyland despite bringing back photos and gifts as evidence, due to his compulsive lying. It is revealed at the end of the book that Peter eventually became a social outcast and disappeared, living a life of solitude deep in the jungle. He became infamous around town, being known as The Enigma. When Peter's father was interviewed on the whereabouts of his son, he blatantly states \\"I have no son!\\".  Kathryn Chambers  Kathryn is the second character introduced in the book. She is a smart girl but also holds an extraordinarily high opinion of herself (much like Peter) and is incredibly pretentious. She is best friends with Joan although as the novels progress, Joan begins to tire of Kathryn's manipulation of her, as do most of the other characters in the book. She is actively shown to loathe most of the boys in the story and does not wish to be in any type of relationship with males, beginning to hate them even more once everyone enters high school. She is perceived as being a real teacher's pet in I Hate Fridays and acts bossy and uptight towards almost everybody, leading to her friends gradually avoiding her completely as years go by. However, unlike Peter, Kathryn doesn't seem fazed by this at all. It is revealed at the end of the book that Kathryn entered politics after graduating from university and is the local Member of Parliament. It was rumoured that she might be expanding her politics to Canberra in hopes of becoming Prime Minister. She also still maintains contact with Joan, who works in the parliamentary library.  Joan Smith  Joan Smith is Kathryn's best friend at the beginning of the series, although as the series progresses she becomes more of an independent character in her own right. She is shown to agree with many of Kathryn's beliefs and hatred about and against boys but begins to get sick of Kathryn manipulating her and stops being friends with her after time. Joan still has genuine contempt towards many of the boys, especially Mario. Joan surprised everyone's expectations when she was announced as the top student in the entire 7th grade class at the end of Worried Sick, even beating Thadeus. Thadeus becomes very interested in her after this and they begin a relationship together after Thadeus talks to Joan about her achievements. Thadeus is away on extended vacation in America in Messin' Around so he keeps in contact with Joan through letters, all of which she seems very happy to read. It is revealed at the end of the series Joan spent as much time as possible at school trying to achieve as much as she could and ended up with a giant folder full of medals and certificates. She then became a librarian, working at various libraries around the state before eventually becoming Chief Librarian at the Parliamentary library in Melbourne. She occasionally talks with Kathryn whenever Kathryn is there to take a break from politics.  Sam Lancer  Sam Lancer is portrayed as a typical immature grade school boy who revels in many gross and puerile things and loves being able to constantly humiliate and tease the girls. He is awful at all his schoolwork due to the simple fact he does not care. Sam's character does not evolve very much through the series as he is shown to still be as immature and disrespectful towards everyone in high school as he was in the 4th grade. In fact, if anything, he becomes worse and worse with his schoolwork every grade. His best friends are Mario and Johnno, and later Henry, as they share a similar disdain towards school and girls. It is revealed at end of the book that Sam dropped out of high school when he was 15 and worked a never-ending series of dead-end jobs, none of which he could ever hold down. Realising he needed to get his act together, he went back to university to study as an adult and ended up becoming Professor of Philosophy at Thorndike University, the local university. He is now addressed as Professor Lancer and is quoted as saying in his interview, \\"Life is merely a string of disorderly circumstances\\".  David Pierce  David Pierce is a relatively normal boy and best friends with Thadeus after having to sit next to him in 4th grade. He is also the object of many different girls' affections, in particular Kirsty who has a very open crush on him and ends up kissing him in the pantry at her house. David, however, clearly does not feel the same way. He has had a secret crush on Kerrie since the 4th grade and kept it to himself for a long time to the point where it was made certain he did not really like her anymore. He gets a girlfriend called Mary in It's Not Fair. Mary goes to another school and has three younger sisters. A number of other girls also have secret crushes on him but these girls are never revealed. David has an obsession with soccer, aspiring to be a soccer player one day, but was not good enough to turn professional.

Band members went on to join Glassjaw and In This Moment.  History  In 1992, Jeff Fabb (Drums), Brian Langan (Guitar), and Brian Green (Bass) started a nameless punk/metal band on the rural eastern end of Long Island. They enlisted friend Scott Jarzombek, to sing. The band‚Äôs remote geographic location automatically made them outsiders to the Long Island and NYC scene. The band began to organize and play shows with their friends within their small town, in basements, recreation halls, and garages. For the most part, they were parties, gatherings of a handful of skaters, metalheads, and geeks from the local area high schools. The bills were always shared with their friends Grid and a mix of side projects. Within the first year, the band went through numerous members, styles, and names. For a short time, it morphed into a side project, Offsides, with Scott moving to bass and his best friend, Ross Milligan, taking over vocals. Sometimes the band would play under the name Offsides and other times as Tripface. Sometimes they would play together, sharing a set. It was Ross who would later solidify the band as Tripface. The first lineup to record was a version of Offsides, in which guitarist Austin Macdonald moved to bass, Scott was back on vocals, and a school friend, Rory, played guitar. This lineup also played live on WUSB‚Äôs Riptide. The set was recorded and released as a split cassette with Grid. After a kind review in Artie Philly‚Äôs ‚ÄúParanoid Zine‚Äù section of Under the Volcano, Long Island began to take notice of the small East End hardcore scene. After a handful of shows and several failed attempts to record a demo, this lineup ceased to function. The band‚Äôs popularity, however, continued to grow with the circulation of the split cassette. Jay May, a fellow East End resident who had been doing sound at local Long Island shows and had recorded an unreleased Offsides demo, approached Scott and Austin about reforming the band with himself on guitar.  Some Part Sorrow line up  The band was reborn, recruiting Dave Allen to play bass and Pete Ruland on drums. This would be its final and most productive lineup. Playing a cross of 1990s metalcore and NYHC, the band grew in popularity on Long Island and began to make a dent on the East Coast. After a few months, the band recorded the Closed In demo. It included the title track, ‚ÄúBrotherhood,‚Äù which had been written not long before by the first Godhead lineup, and an Offsides original, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve Lost.‚Äù The band played on WUSB again and another split cassette with Grid was released. Austin left the band soon after, over musical and ideological differences. This final lineup was the most productive and well- known incarnation of Tripface. Tripface would go on to play many shows, including CBGBs, the QE2, Right Track Inn, the PWAC, and the Wetlands, sharing stages with bands like Warzone, Sheer Terror, Agnostic Front, Hatebreed, and Outburst. They did only one East Coast tour, with NYHC legends Indecision, but did numerous long weekends with bands like Marauder, Blood for Blood, and Earth Crisis. In 1994 Artie Philly‚Äôs new subsidiary of Wreckage Records, Exit, agreed to release the This Foundation EP. Not long after, they were taken under the wing of Tyler King at King-sized booking, who can be credited with much of the band‚Äôs later success. Exit would release their CD, Some Part Sorrow, in 1996. Tracks were also featured on the From the Ground Up compilation (Eyeball Records), the Mindset Overhaul compilation (Wreakage Records), and the Release DVD (Victory Records). In 1997, Scott Jarzombek was kicked out due to internal differences. The band recruited Tommy Corrigan from Silent Majority to form the short-lived Advent. Even after their break-up, the band continued to get critical acclaim for their recordings. Some Part Sorrow was voted NYHC Album of the Year by In Effect Fanzine and was featured on a list of Alternative Press' ‚ÄúEssential but Obscure Long Island Records.‚Äù Motherbox Records has recently released the band's discography titled, Some Part Hope.

It is a two-story, octagonal house of stacked plank construction, featuring an 8-sided roof topped by an octagonal \\"captains walk,\\" flanked by two brick chimneys. The house has a simplified Federal style. It was built about 1854, and served as summer home for the Jewett family until 1874. Wildfell Wildfell beam joist and stacked plank wall construction Wildfell stacked plank wall construction Wildfell is one of the rare octagonal houses built in Maryland at the height of the \\"Octagon Fad\\". Located in Darlington, Maryland just off US 1, the house is a prominent feature of Harford County. Construction is believed to have begun in 1847 with completion prior to 1854. Commissioned by the Joseph Jewett family of Baltimore, Maryland and built by William Hensel. The Jewett family learned of an abandoned Baltimore clipper ship which had served in the War of 1812. The Jewett family purchased the derelict and contracted Hensel (a former naval carpenter) to salvage wood from the vessel and transport materials to the building site in Darlington, MD. The short oak timbers and naval treated planks were well suited to the short walls required by the octagonal design. The interior layout resembles an octagon divided into quadrants. Thus, most rooms have 5 walls. Two stories high, the octagonal house has an 8-sided roof topped by an octagonal \\"widows walk\\" flanked by two brick chimneys which serviced 4 fireplaces in the primary living areas and a hearth in the basement. The house faces southeast, with one or two openings in each wall. A modern one-story wing (constructed 2011, replaced ca.1900 structure) runs northwest. There is a three-sided porch facing east, southeast, and south. Wildfell is a simplified Federal style, with a molding over the boxed eaves, which is repeated on the porch above its octagonal pillars. The six-paneled front door in a plain frame is topped by a four-light transom. Windows have 6/6 lights behind louvered shutters. The stairway has two turned balusters on each step under a walnut handrail. Double parlors are separated by pocket doors. Original kitchen and dining room spaces are to the rear. Perhaps unique to this house are the exterior and interior load bearing walls whose construction is of narrow (1‚Äùx7‚Äù) oak planks laid horizontally, nailed from above as the work proceeded, forming a virtually solid 7‚Äù wall thickness. The construction method is visible beneath the shutters of the false windows to the left of the front door. The window placement would have opened out from the side of the staircase, but is placed to complete the symmetrical appearance of the house. Floor joists are hand hued timber beams set in a cross pattern and cross joined by lesser beams. The Jewetts used Wildfell as a summer home from March 1854 until June 1874. The property was sold in 1874 and it came into ownership by the prominent Scott family where it remained for several generations. Wildfell is listed on the National Register of Historic Places September 20, 1973. The property is currently owned by Matthew and Bonnie Payne.

Nothing remains of its few buildings. Barbersville was probably preceded by the town of Edinburgh, which was platted on November 3, 1815, and recorded in the Jefferson County deed records. No legal land definitions were included, but a rough map showed the land of the proprietors, Wilson Buchanan, George Benefiel, and James Whitton, who were neighboring landowners, all of whom had land in the Barbersville area. They laid out 64 lots around a public square, which was filed in Jefferson County Deed Book A page 174. The Barbersville Post Office operated from December 7, 1826, to November 19, 1838, and then was transferred to nearby Buchanan's Station in Ripley County. Mail service was then provided by the Canaan Post Office in Shelby Township. The government re-established the Barberville office on June 27, 1848, and it operated until May 31, 1906, when service was transferred to Canaan. The first postmaster, Timothy Barber, was licensed by the Jefferson County Commissioners to sell foreign merchandise (such as sugar and coffee) in May 1829 and again in May 1832. Enoch and Thomas Bray platted the town on December 18, 1848, with fifteen lots and three named streets including Main Street (60 feet wide), Broadway (50 feet wide), and Main Cross. During the 1870s, most of the lots came into the possession of area resident William Buchanan. The Historical Atlas of Indiana, published in 1876, lists Barbersville's population as 100 in 1870. But it was never separately enumerated in the censuses, so this may reflect the number of people with Barbersville addresses. William H. operated the store with the longest history, opening in 1857 and closing with his death in 1911. His goods were auctioned on August 8, 1911, according to William Kramer's Shelby Township history. The 1890 Indiana Business Directory and Gazetteer described the town as follows: \\"A village of 50 population located Shelby township, Jefferson county, 15 miles northeast of Madison, the county seat, shipping point, and banking town. Grain, livestock, hay and fruit are the shipments. Mail, tri-weekly. W.H.H. Benefiel.\\" A one-room school was operating in Barbersville by December 24, 1890, when the school year ended, according to the January 6, 1891, issue of the Daily Democrat. It apparently closed by the 1915/16 school year, as a county school list for that year did not include it. The town had a corn mill, according to a Madison Courier article dated January 31, 1895, which said the mill \\"grinds every Friday and Saturday when not too bad\\" and was under the operation of Milford Smock. The town also had a justice of the peace court, which lasted at least into the latter part of the nineteenth century. The Madison Courier reported in 1895 that \\"Squire Van Antwerp's Court will convene September 24.\\" William Benefiel was listed as involved in a \\"General Store, Implements, Fertilizers and Live Stock.\\" In the twentieth century, the area was severely depopulated, and according to aerial photographs there are only three residences or other buildings along the Barbersville Road for a mile in either direction, including the area in which the town was once located. Geography Barbersville was located at latitude 38.90583 and longitude: -85.28083. The elevation is above sea level. References *Baker, J.

They succeeded the Rasulid Dynasty and were themselves replaced by the Mamluks of Egypt after only 63 years in power. Founding of dynasty The Tahir were Yemeni magnates who originated from the area of Juban and al- Miqranah, about 80 km south of Rada'a. They were trustees of the sultans of the Rasulid Dynasty (1229‚Äì1454) and were frequently called in to quell rebellions towards the close of the dynasty. A daughter of the clan was married to a son of the sultan an-Nasir Ahmad. After the death of the latter in 1424 a period of upheavals and dynastic instability plagued Yemen. The Rasulid dynastic collapse gave the Tahir clan a chance to gain power. Lahij, north of Aden, was taken over by them in 1443, and in 1454, the important port of Aden was swiftly taken by the brothers Amir and Ali bin Tahir and thereby detached from the Rasulids.Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. X, Leiden 2000, p. 106. The last sultan, al-Mas'ud Abu al-Qasim, gave up any hope of maintaining his throne and withdrew to Mecca in the same year. The eldest of the brothers, Amir bin Tahir, took the titles sultan and king (malik) with the regnal name Salah ad-Din al-Malik az-Zafir Amir (r. 1454‚Äì1460). The sultans used to spend the summers in Juban and al-Miqranah, with good access to the southern highlands, using Zabid in the lowland as their winter capital. In that way, Zabid regained the position as one of the centres of learning and culture in the Arab world. Economically, the city nevertheless seems to have declined by the late 15th century.Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. X, Leiden 2000, p. 106. Tahirid rule The Tahirids tried to imitate the former line, the Banu Rasul. While they were not as impressive builders as these, they were still prominent. Thus they built schools, mosques and irrigation channels as well as water cisterns and bridges in Zabid and Aden, Yafrus, Rada'a, Juban, etc. Some of these are still in use. Arguably their best known monument is the Amiriyya madrasa in Juban and Amiriyya madrasa in Rada'a from 1504. Like their predecessors they ruled in the first place in the Tihama lowland and the southern highlands. The sultans were less active in expanding their territorial base than the Rasulid rulers. Much of the energy of the sultans was spent on quelling uprisings by Tihama tribes. Shihr in Hadramawt was taken in 1457; however, it was lost at the end of the fifteenth century to the Kathiri princedom that controlled much of the interior of Hadramawt. The Zaidi Shia imams, although split between various claimants in the northern highlands, were mostly able to resist Tahirid rule.Encyklop√§die des Islam, III, Leiden 1936, p. 1217 The first sultan az-Zafir Amir sent an army against the imam al-Mutawakkil al-Mutahhar in 1458, but it was defeated and the sultan's brother Muhammad bin Tahir was killed. The debacle probably inspired az-Zafir Amir to abdicate his royal prerogatives to another brother, al- Mujahid Ali. The latter was able to enter San'a temporarily in 1461. However, the city was soon taken back by the Zaydiyya. Subsequent expeditions to San'a were unsuccessful, and the old sultan Amir was killed with many followers when fighting the Zaydis in 1466.R.B. Serjeant & R. Lewcock, San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City, London 1983, p. 67; Lein O. Schuman, Political History of the Yemen at the Beginning of the 16th Century. Groningen 1960, p. 52‚Äì3. In the early sixteenth century sultan az-Zafir Amir II (1489‚Äì1517) resumed expansion to the north into Zaydiyya territory and managed to take San'a again in 1504. However, he was soon distracted by enemies on other fronts. Invasion and defeat The Tahirids had to contend with a number of acute external threats. The Portuguese expanded in the Indian Ocean area after 1498 and soon realized that Aden was the key to access to the Red Sea. Occupying the island Socotra in 1507, the Portuguese activities had negative repercussions for Muslim trade in the region. The Mamluk regime in Egypt, realizing the danger, sent a fleet under Husain al-Kurdi to the south in 1505 with the intention to fight the Christian intruders in the Indian Ocean. When it arrived to Yemen, Az-Zafir Amir II contributed with significant provisions. However, Husain al-Kurdi's ships were decisively beaten by the Portuguese off Diu, India in 1509. A second fleet was equipped in 1515, again under Husain al-Kurdi. This time, az- Zafir Amir II, who had recently beaten off a Portuguese attack on Aden, refused to provide resources to the Mamluks. The infuriated Husain al-Kurdi sought and found willing allies in Yemen itself, including the Zaydiyya imam al-Mutawakkil Yahya Sharaf ad-Din, the Sulaimani sharif Izz ad-Din bin Ahmad, and the warlord Abu Bakr bin Maqbul of Luhayyah. After having laid at anchor at Zaila on the African coast, he attacked the Tahirid sultan with muskets and artillery, hitherto not used in warfare in Yemen. After winning a number of battles, the Mamluks appropriated the Tahirid treasure house in al-Miqranah. Az-Zafir Amir II fled to the central highlands where he was again defeated. The sultan tried to flee to the strong fortress Dhu Marmar but was captured and beheaded near San'a on 15 May.R.B. Serjeant & R. Lewcock, San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City, London 1983, pp. 68‚Äì9. The entire Tahirid realm fell under the Mamluks with the exception of Aden which held out under the Tahirid governor Amir Murjan.Robert W. Stookey, Yemen: The politics of the Yemen Arab Republic, Boulder 1978, pp. 129‚Äì31. Aftermath The Mamluk fleet withdrew after setting up a tributary regime in Zabid. The Mamluk regime in Egypt was overrun by the Ottomans in the same year. The Zabid Mamluks then offered prayers in the name of the Ottoman sultan while defending themselves as well as they could against Zaydiyya and remaining Tahirid forces as well as Arab tribesmen. It was only in 1538 that an Ottoman fleet was dispatched for the Indian Ocean. In Yemen, Prince Amir bin Da'ud sent calls for help from the commander of the fleet, Sulaiman Pasha al-Khadim, since he was cornered at Aden by the Zaydiyya imam al-Mutawakkil Yahya Sharaf ad-Din. Sulaiman Pasha pretended to agree to assist and sailed to Aden. However, he sent his men ashore, arrested Amir bin Da'ud and his principal grandees, and hanged them from the yardarms of the ships on 3 August 1538. Shortly afterward, Mamluk governance in Yemen was eliminated and Turkish rule commenced.Robert W. Stookey, ibid, pp, 132‚Äì3.

In the year 1630 AD, Shivaji's Father Shahaji Raje Bhosale, established the Lal Mahal for his wife Jijabai and son. Shivaji stayed here for several years until he captured his first fort. The current Lal Mahal is a reconstruction of the original and located in the center of the Pune city. Shivaji's marriage with his first wife, Saibai took place in Lal Mahal. The original Lal Mahal was built with the idea of rejuvenating the recently razed city of Pune when entered the city along with Shivaji and his mother, Jijabai. Shivaji grew up here, and stayed in the Lal Mahal till he captured the Torna fort in 1645. Towards the end of the 17th Century, the Lal Mahal was ruined by some peoples and was eventually razed to the ground as a result of various attacks on the city.http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-11-05/delhi/27918940_1_lal- mahal-central-protection-ghiyasuddin-balban It is said that during the construction of the Shaniwarwada, some soil and stones of the Lal Mahal were used for luck. In 1734-35, a few houses were constructed on the land of the Lal Mahal and given for use to Ranoji Shinde and Ramchandraji. The records in the offices of the Peshwas mention that Lal Mahal was used for arranging feasts for the Brahmins during the thread-ceremony of Sadoba, son of Chimaji Appa. The exact original location of the Lal Mahal is unknown, however it was known to be very close to the location of Shaniwarwada, which is roughly where the current reconstruction stands. The current Lal Mahal was built only on a part of the land of the original Lal Mahal. The new Lal Mahal was not rebuilt in the same fashion as the original one and there is not much information found about the area and structure of the original Lal Mahal. The current Lal Mahal was rebuilt by the PMC. Construction started in 1984 and was completed in 1988. Historically, the Lal Mahal is famous for an encounter between Shivaji and Shaista Khan where Shivaji cut off the latter's fingers when he was trying to escape from the window of the Lal Mahal. This was part of a surreptitious guerrilla attack on the massive and entrenched Mughal Army that had camped in Pune, with Shaiste occupying (possibly symbolically) Shivaji Maharaj's childhood home. As a punishment for the ignominy of the defeat despite superior numbers and better armed and fed soldiers, Shaista was transferred by the Mughal Emperor to Bengal. Even today, Shaista Khan is regarded as a national hero in Bangladesh- the Muslim homeland of Bengalis. Monuments to him stand testimony to it in Dhaka, capital of modern Bangladesh. The current Lal Mahal is a memorial holding a collection of large-size oil paintings based on the significant events in the life of Shivaji, a statue of Jijabai, a carving depicting Shivaji using a gold plow along with Jijabai, a fiber model of Raigad with horsemen and a huge map of Maharashtra indicating the forts of Shivaji.

As a subdiscipline of pedagogy it also addresses the wider impact of computer science in society through its intersection with philosophy, psychology, linguistics, natural sciences, and mathematics. In comparison to science education and mathematics education, computer science education is a much younger field. In the history of computing, digital computers were only built from around the 1940s ‚Äì although computation has been around for centuries since the invention of analog computers. Another differentiator of computer science education is that it has primarily only been taught at university level until recently, with some notable exceptions in Israel, Poland and the United Kingdom with the BBC Micro in the 1980s. Computer science has been a part of the school curricula from age 14 or age 16 in a few countries for a few decades, but has typically as an elective subject. Computing education research Educational research on computing and teaching methods in computer science is usually known as Computing Education Research. The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) runs a Special Interest Group (SIG) on Computer science education known as SIGCSE which celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2018, making it one of the oldest and longest running ACM Special Interest Groups. Women in computer science In many countries, there is a significant gender gap in computer science education. In 2015, 15.3% of computer science students graduating from non- doctoral granting institutions in the US were women while at doctoral granting institutions, the figure was 16.6%. The number of female PhD recipients in the US was 19.3% in 2018.2018 Taulbee Survey, Computing Research Association. https://cra.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2018_Taulbee_Survey.pdf The gender gap also exists in other western countries.
