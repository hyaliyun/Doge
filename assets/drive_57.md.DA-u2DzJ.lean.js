June 20, 1930).Martha Houghton Ingalls Find A Grave IndexMartha Houghton Ingalls, Kingston Daily Freeman (30 June 1930) Martha was the daughter of David Harrison Houghtaling of Kingston, New York, who was a descendant of Jan Willemsen Hoogteling, who arrived in New Amsterdam on May 9, 1661. Laura wrote of her mother: \\"My mother, partly through ill health, was extremely emotional and without adequate self-discipline; spoiled by her parents who thought she was wonderful and could do anything. Brilliant along certain lines, she possessed the trait I find most exciting in the American character, viz. the ability to hurdle difficulties and achieve the reputedly impossible. I grew up under such influence.\\" =Sibling= Her brother was Francis Abbott Ingalls II (1895‚Äì1978) who was also born in Brooklyn. Francis registered for the draft while attending military school in Tuxedo Park, New York as a private in the infantry. He was an officer in both World War I and World War II. Francis married Mabel Morgan Satterlee (1901‚Äì1993) on September 19, 1926. Mabel was the daughter of Herbert Livingston Satterlee and Louisa Pierpont Morgan, the daughter of J. P. Morgan.

She was arrested for violating White House airspace, but was released within hours. Following the defeat of France in 1940, she approached Baron (Freiherr) Ulrich von Gienanth, the head of the Gestapo in the US, and, officially, second secretary of the German Embassy. She suggested that she make a solo flight to Europe, where she would continue her campaign to promote the Nazi cause. Von Gienanth told her to stay in America to work with the America First Committee. Ingalls gave speeches for the Committee in which she derided America's \\"lousy democracy\\" and gave Nazi salutes. Von Gienanth praised her oratorical skills. She had made a careful study of Mein Kampf, on which she based many of her speeches, as well as pamphlets by Hitler such as My New Order and Germany and the Jewish Question, and Elizabeth Dilling's books The Roosevelt Red Record and The Octopus. She expected Hitler to win the war; in April 1941, she wrote to a German official, \\"Some day I will shout my triumph to a great leader and a great people... Heil Hitler!\\" After the German declaration of war on December 11, 1941, she went straight to Washington to receive a list of contacts from von Gienanth, and was arrested a week later. Ingalls was charged with failing to register with the government as a paid Nazi agent, in violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938. She had been receiving approximately $300 a month from von Gienanth. During the trial it came out that von Gienanth had encouraged Ingalls's participation in the America First Committee, a significant embarrassment for that organization. The FBI testified that they had kept her under surveillance for several months. Ingalls was convicted, and sentenced to eight months to two years in prison on February 20, 1942.CONVICTED: Laura Ingalls (NY Times, p. 2E, 15 February 1942) She was transferred from the District of Columbia jail to the U.S. federal women's prison in Alderson, West Virginia, on July 14, 1943, after fighting with another inmate. She was released on October 5, 1943 after serving 20 months. Prison had not altered her views, however. A few months after her release, she stated her opinion of the Normandy landings: After her probation ended, in July 1944 Ingalls was arrested at the Mexican border. Her suitcase contained seditious materials, including notes she had made of Japanese and German short-wave radio broadcasts. She was prevented from entering Mexico, but was not prosecuted. Ingalls applied for a presidential pardon in 1950, but her application for clemency was rejected by two successive Pardon Attorneys. On the latter occasion, the reply stated that Ingalls had been of \\"special value of the Nazi propaganda machine\\". She died on January 10, 1967, in Burbank, California, aged 73.

In 1919, he was on the staff of the German delegation that was to receive the Treaty of Versailles. In 1933, he emigrated and eventually moved to the United States where he became an advocate for the peaceful resolution of conflicts. Life =Early life in the German Empire= Wilhelm Sollmann was born on 2 April 1881 in , Saxe-Meiningen (today a part of Sonneberg, Thuringia). His father was Johan Jakob Sollmann, a brewer and farmer in Oberlind and after 1889 tenant of the Ratskeller at Coburg. His mother was Christiane Sollmann, inn keeper. After the move to Coburg, Wilhelm attended the Casimirianum gymnasium from 1891 to 1897, when he had to leave due to the family's financial difficulties. That year, his family moved to Cologne. There, he began work as an apprentice (kaufm√§nnische Lehre). From 1901-11 he worked as a Handlungsgehilfe whilst attending night school at the Handelshochschule K√∂ln. Originally rooted in Lutheran Christianity, he was a member of the Internationaler Guttempler-Orden and the CVJM. However, in 1902 he joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and in 1907 co-founded the Workers' Youth at Cologne. He was also active in the temperance movement and was chairman of the Arbeiter-Abstinenzbewegung (workers' temperance movement, 1906‚Äì10). He was also a member of the Angestelltengwerkschaft (white-collar workers' union). In 1906, Sollmann married Anna Katharina (K√§the, Kate) n√©e Gr√ºmmer (born 1883, died before 1975). They had one daughter, Elfriede (1912‚Äì97). In 1908, Sollmann became a Freidenker. In 1911, Sollmann became editor of the socialdemocratic newspaper Fr√§nkischer Volksfreund at W√ºrzburg, but soon returned to Cologne where he became editor (1912) and later editor-in-chief (1920‚Äì33) of the Rheinische Zeitung. During World War I, Sollmann was the chairman of the socialdemocratic union (Verein) of Cologne. =German Revolution and Weimar Republic= During the German Revolution of 1918 he played a key role in the formed Workers' and soldiers' council of Cologne. From 1918-24, Sollmann was a member of the Cologne municipal parliament (Stadtverordneter). In 1919, he was elected to the Weimar National Assembly and held his seat until the new elections to the Reichstag in 1920. Working closely with Konrad Adenauer, whom he later described as \\"a personal friend and political enemy\\", Sollmann helped turn the Handelshochschule into the University of Cologne in 1919. He rejected an honorific doctorate in 1919 (and again in 1928) for personal reasons. In 1919, Sollmann also was a staff member of the German delegation to the Paris Peace Conference in Versailles, where he served as an expert on problems of the Rheinland occupation. He was a member of the Reichstag from 1920 until 1933. In 1921, he initiated the establishment of the Sozialdemokratischer Parlamentsdienst (after 1924: Sozialdemokratischer Pressedienst), a political news service. From 13 August 1923 until his resignation on 3 November, he served as Reichsminister des Innern (Reich Minister of the Interior) in the cabinets of Gustav Stresemann. In parliament, he served as a member of the Committee for Foreign Affairs, and as an expert on disarmament and adult education. =Germany 1933 and emigration= In 1933, he was elected to the executive board of the SPD and as such persecuted by the Nazis after the Machtergreifung. On 9 March, he was taken into Schutzhaft (\\"protective custody\\") and tortured. After being released, he fled in May via Luxembourg to the occupied Saar. There he briefly worked as the editor-in-chief of the socialdemocratic Volskstimme. After the referendum he returned to Luxembourg, in 1936 went on to the United Kingdom and in 1937 emigrated to the United States. =In America= In the U.S., Sollmann worked as a writer, speaker, radio announcer and faculty member (1937‚Äì1950) of the Pendle Hill Quaker Center for Study and Contemplation, a Quaker study center located in Wallingford, Pennsylvania. In the next years, Sollmann travelled through most of the United States, giving lectures on world affairs. He became a visiting professor of international affairs at Haverford, Bard, and Reed Colleges. Having lost his German citizenship in 1936, in 1943 he was naturalized and changed his name to William Frederick Sollmann. That year, he also became a Quaker. A member of the SPD's right wing, in exile he was one of the leading proponents of the volkssozialistische Richtung within the party. At the request of the American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker organization, Sollmann briefly visited occupied Germany in 1948, where he held speeches and radio addresses. On another visit the following year he served as visiting professor at the University of Cologne. In 1949/50, the U.S. government consulted him on setting up a new German Civil Liberties Union (Bund f√ºr B√ºrgerrechte) and he worked for the Allied High Commission, but he had to return to the United States due to the onset of illness. During his visits, he met with politicians like Adenauer and Kurt Schumacher and also was Adenauer's guest of honour at the inaugural meeting of the Deutscher Bundestag. Sollmann was co-founder of the Carl Schurz-Gesellschaft, member of the Verbands deutscher Journalisten im Ausland and of the Legion for American Unity. On 6 January 1951, Sollmann died in Mount Carmel, Connecticut. A street in Cologne is named after him.

The film centers on Stanley Jobson, an ex-con and computer hacker who is targeted for recruitment into a bank robbery conspiracy because of his formidable hacking skills.  Plot  Stanley Jobson (Hugh Jackman) is a cyber-hacker who became notorious for infecting the FBI's Carnivore program with a computer virus. Stanley's parole forbids him from accessing the internet and computers while his ex-wife Melissa, an alcoholic and part-time porn star, has issued a restraining order against him. This also prevents him from seeing his only daughter Holly. Ginger Knowles (Halle Berry) persuades him to work for Gabriel Shear (John Travolta), who threatens him into cracking a secure U.S. D.O.D. server. After the hack, Gabriel offers Jobson $10 million to program a multi- headed worm, a \\"hydra\\", to siphon $9.5 billion from government slush funds. Stanley begins work on the worm, learning that Gabriel leads Black Cell, a clandestine organization created by J. Edgar Hoover to launch retaliatory attacks against terrorists that threaten the United States. He also privately discovers Ginger is a DEA agent working undercover and further is surprised to discover a corpse that looks like Gabriel. After he goes to see Holly home from school, Stanley discovers that he is being followed by FBI agent J.T. Roberts (Don Cheadle), who had previously arrested him. Roberts, though monitoring Stanley closely, is more interested in Gabriel as he does not appear on any government database, and after learning that another hacker, Axl Torvalds (Rudolf Martin), had been killed by Gabriel's men, warns Stanley to be cautious. Stanley opts to secretly code a backdoor in his hydra that reverses the money transfer after a short period. Meanwhile, United States Senator Reisman (Sam Shepard), who oversees Black Cell, learns the FBI has started tracking Gabriel and orders him to stand down. Gabriel refuses and narrowly defeats a hit team dispatched against him by Reisman. In retaliation, Gabriel personally kills Reisman in revenge and continues his plan. Stanley delivers the hydra to Gabriel and leaves to see Holly, only to find that Gabriel has killed Melissa, kidnapped Holly and framed him for Melissa's death alongside her husband and porn producer. Stanley has no choice but to participate in a bank heist to get Holly back. At the site of the heist, Gabriel and his men storm a branch and secure its employees and customers as hostages, fitting each of them with ball-bearing-based explosives similar to Claymore mines. When police and FBI surround the branch, Gabriel takes Stanley to a nearby coffee shop across the street to meet with Roberts, but Gabriel spends the time discussing the film Dog Day Afternoon and the nature of misdirection. Once back in the bank, Gabriel has one of his men escort a hostage to demonstrate the situation where a sharpshooter kills the man but as other agents pull the hostage away from the bank, the bomb detonates, ravaging the buildings and vehicles on the street and killing several people, a scene shown in medias res. Gabriel instructs Stanley to launch the hydra and turns Holly over to him once completed. However, the back door triggers before they can leave the bank, leading to Stanley being recaptured while Holly is rescued. Gabriel threatens to kill Ginger, who he knows is a DEA agent, unless Stanley re-siphons the money back to a Monte Carlo bank. Although Stanley complies, Gabriel shoots Ginger. Gabriel and his men load the hostages onto a bus and demand a plane wait for them at the local airport, but while en route, the bus is lifted off by a S-64 Aircrane and deposited on the roof of a local skyscraper. Gabriel deactivates the bombs and departs with his surviving men on a waiting helicopter, which Stanley shoots down using a rocket-propelled grenade from the bus. Roberts takes Stanley to verify a corpse they found, believing Gabriel was a Mossad agent while there is no record of a DEA agent named Ginger Knowles. Stanley recognizes the corpse as the one he discovered earlier and personally realizes that the whole scenario was a deception. The police cannot find Ginger's corpse and it‚Äôs revealed that she was wearing a bulletproof vest and was working with Gabriel all along. Gabriel escaped via a different route. Despite Stanley not telling the police that Gabriel and Ginger are still alive, Roberts arranges for Stanley to have full custody of Holly, where they depart to places elsewhere. In Monte Carlo, Gabriel and Ginger withdraw the stolen money and later watch as a yacht at sea explodes. Over the film's credits, a news report reveals the destruction of the yacht, carrying a known terrorist, as the third such incident in as many weeks.  Cast   Reception  The film received a great deal of press initially because it featured Halle Berry's first topless scene. She was paid an extra $500,000 on top of her $2 million fee to appear topless in this film. Critics said the scene looked forced, thrown into the film just to garner press. Berry said she did the topless scene, knowing it was gratuitous, to overcome the fear of appearing nude onscreen. , 25% of the 138 reviews compiled on Rotten Tomatoes are positive, with an average rating of 4.35/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"Swordfish is big on explosions, but critics dislike how it skimps on plot and logic. Also, the sight of a person typing at a computer just isn't that interesting.\\" In a review for The New York Times, Stephen Holden wrote: According to Box Office Mojo, the film grossed over $147 million in worldwide box office receipts on a production budget of $102 million. John Travolta's performance in the film earned him a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Actor (also for Domestic Disturbance).  DVD alternative ending  The DVD version contains an alternative ending wherein Ginger is told in the bank that the account is already almost empty, alluding to the possibility that Stanley has played one final trick on them and taken the money himself. When Ginger tells Gabriel about this, he takes it in stride and asks her to join him on a trip to Istanbul. In a companion scene to the alternate ending, Stanley is shown on a trip with his daughter in a brand new RV. While eating at a diner, Stanley is shown transferring billions of dollars to various charities before continuing his trip.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack for Swordfish was produced by Paul Oakenfold, under Village Roadshow and Warner Bros. and distributed through London Sire Records, Inc. It contains 15 tracks. The film's orchestral score was written by Christopher Young with several electronic additions by Paul Oakenfold. Fragments from the score were added to the official soundtrack, but were remixed by Oakenfold. A more complete release was issued as an award promo, which is known for its rarity.

Initially denoting a sedan delivery, the Courier nameplate has been used for compact pickup trucks, panel vans, and coupe utility pickups. Since their production, Ford has replaced Courier models with nameplates currently in production. The Courier pickup trucks have been replaced by the Ranger truck line worldwide, while the Courier vans have been replaced by the Transit Connect; within the Ford Transit range, the Transit Courier name denotes the smallest model, a leisure activity vehicle. __TOC__  Sedan delivery (1952‚Äì1960)  1952 Ford Courier 1956 Ford Courier sedan delivery The 1952 to 1960 Ford Couriers were sedan delivery variants of Ford's US mainstream passenger vehicle range of those model years. Its model code was 78A through to 1958. It had a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. Access to the rear storage area was through a unique door hinged on the side. For 1957 and 1958, the rear access door was a combination of the lift gate and tailgate, sometimes called a clamshell tailgate, being connected with two connecting struts. This design meant that the rear-door back glass had to be divided into three sections, two outer curved portions and a center piece. It was identical to the Ford Parklane and later the Ford Del Rio wagons without side glass installed. In 1959, all Couriers took on the windowed body style very similar to the Tudor Ranch Wagons and the model code was redesignated as 59E. The last year for the passenger car-based Courier was 1960, when it would remain a commercial wagon. The Courier was continued into the 1961 model year and is cataloged in the 60/64 FORD MPC. 60/61 2DR Commercial Ranch Wagon (Courier) (Body Type Code 59E) 1960-1964 FORD Master Parts Catalog  Mazda-based models  = First generation (1972‚Äì1976) = 1972 Ford Courier 1975 Ford Courier In the early 1970s, the Ford Courier name was applied to the Mazda B-Series, a compact pickup manufactured by Mazda. It had greater fuel economy than the full-sized pickups of the time. The Courier was manufactured by Toyo Kogyo (Mazda) and imported to North America and sold by Ford Motor Company as a response to the unforeseen popularity of the small Toyota and Nissan/Datsun Pickups. It occupied the market segment previously held by the Ford Falcon- based Ranchero when that platform was upgraded to the larger Ford Fairlane in 1966. Like the other minipickups of the time, it featured a four-cylinder engine, a four-speed manual transmission, rear-wheel drive, an impressive load capability of 1,400 lb (635 kg) considering its size, and a fairly small price tag compared to full-sized pickups of the time. To circumvent the 25% \\"chicken tax\\" on light trucks, Couriers (as with Chevrolet LUVs) were imported in \\"cab chassis\\" configurations, which included the entire light truck - less the cargo box or truck bed - and were only subject to a 4% tariff. Subsequently, a truck bed was attached to the chassis and the vehicle could be sold as a light truck. The body styling was effectively that of the related Mazda B-series; however, its front styling was unique in that the grille was designed to emulate the larger Ford F-series, and large single headlights instead of the B-series' smaller twin units. When the Courier was introduced, it came standard with a 1.8-liter overhead-cam engine, which produced 74 hp (55 kW) at 5,070 rpm, and 92 lb-ft (125 N¬∑m) at 3,500 rpm. A four-speed manual transmission was standard, and a three-speed automatic was optional. A five- speed manual option was introduced for the 1976 model year. The Courier's badging changed a few times in the first generation. In 1972 and 1973, the tailgate read \\"COURIER\\" in large raised letters, with a small \\"FORD\\" badge on the upper left. The '72 model has a small \\"COURIER\\" badge on the front driver's side edge of the hood, and from '73 through '76, the hood badging read \\"FORD\\". From the 1974 model year, the tailgate read \\"FORD\\" in large letters, with a small \\"COURIER\\" badge on the lower right. In 1976, the cab was lengthened by 3 in (76 mm), and the grille received added trim. = Second generation (1977‚Äì1985) = 1979 Ford Courier 1985 Ford Courier Beginning in 1977, Ford gave the Courier a fresh look, moving into the more blocky, angular styling that is distinct of 1980s automotive design. In 1979, the base model engine was increased in size to . The truck was available with front disc brakes, and a Ford-built 2.3-liter engine option (which was the same as that of the Ford Pinto & Mustang II and Mercury Bobcat & Capri). The key identifying feature of the Courier from the Mazda B-Series was still the singular headlights, although with park and indicator lights placed in the grille starting in '78 ('77s still had the turn signal lights in the bumper). In 1979, the base model was increased in size to 2.0 liter (120.1 CID). The optional Ford 2.3-liter (140 cid) engine was produced in Brazil. The Courier was never available with a diesel engine in the US. However, the 1980 Mazda B2200 was available with the S2, a Perkins-built 4.135 (four-cylinder, 135-cid) 2.2-liter diesel engine, producing 66 hp (49 kW) at 2,100 rpm. This same diesel engine was available in the 1983 and 1984 Ford Rangers, but it was replaced by the Mitsubishi 4D55T 2.3-liter turbodiesel (also used in Mitsubishi's own Mighty Max and the Dodge Ram 50) for the 1985 to 1987 Ford Rangers. The Courier continued to be sold in North America until 1982 model year. For 1983, Ford introduced its own Ford Ranger to fill its compact truck segment in the United States and Canada, effectively replacing the Courier. However, in other markets (such as Australia), this generation of Couriers continued on until the 1985 model year, when the next generation was introduced. Australian models received a facelift around 1982/1983. Between 1979 and 1982, a number of electric Ford Couriers were produced ‚Äì Jet Industries purchased \\"vehicle gliders\\" (Ford Courier bodies minus their engines), and put in a series DC motor and lead-acid batteries, to produce the Jet Industries ElectraVan 750. These were sold mainly for use as service trucks, generally to local government departments. They had a top speed of about 70 mph (113 km/h), and would go 50 to 60 miles (97 km) on a full charge. A number of these vehicles still exist, usually with upgraded motor control systems and higher-voltage battery packs. = Third generation (1985‚Äì1998) = 1990 Ford Courier 1995 Ford Courier Coinciding with the 1985 redesign of the Mazda of the Proceed/B-Series, the Courier was given a larger, more modern cab. New options included five-speed manual transmissions, four-wheel drive, and a V6 engine. For the first time, extended and four-door cabs were available. In a similar fashion to the North American Ford Ranger becoming the donor platform for the Ford Explorer SUV, a sport utility would be based upon this version of the Courier. Branded the Ford Raider (and equivalent Mazda Proceed Marvie), it was sold from 1991 to 1997. = Fourth generation (1998‚Äì2007) = 2000 Ford Courier 2000 Ford Courier In 1998, a new generation of the Courier pickups was released following a redesign of the Mazda B-Series. Unlike the previous generation, the Courier nameplate was sold primarily in Australia and New Zealand. In other markets, the Courier nameplate was phased out in favor of Ranger for all compact trucks, both Mazda-produced and Ford-produced.  Fiesta-based models  = Europe (1991‚Äì2002) = A Ford Courier B-segment car-derived van was launched in Europe in June 1991 with a front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout and 1.3-litre OHV petrol or 1.8-litre OHC Diesel power. Based on the Ford BE-2 platform also used by the Mark III and Mark IV Fiesta, Mark I Ka and Puma cars, the Ford Courier van was initially based on the Mark III Fiesta that had been introduced two years earlier in 1989, but with a longer wheelbase and Renault-derived torsion bar rear suspension. From August 1995, the Courier van was instead produced in a Mark IV-based version and did receive that Fiesta's facelift in 1999, meaning that it was produced with three different front ends, all with similar rear ends using the 1986-2000 Transit rear lights. As well as the two-seat cargo version, there was also a glazed version produced with rear seats fitted; this five-seat passenger model was sold as the Courier Combi. The Courier van was built in the Dagenham, England and Cologne, Germany factories and is 4,115 mm long, 1,650 mm wide and 1,835 mm tall, with a curb weight of 1,700 kg. With a capacity of 590 kg, competing products were initially the Fiat Fiorino and the Renault Express, and all units received a five-speed manual gearbox. The 60 PS (44 kW) 1.8-litre naturally aspirated Diesel engine achieves its maximum power at 4,800 rpm, and its maximum torque is 110 Nm at 2,500 rpm. The claimed top speed of the Courier van 1.8D is 84 mph (135 km/h), with acceleration not specified. From 1999 to 2002, a 1.8-litre turbo-diesel engine was available as an option for improved performance. However, the 1.8TD was only offered in 75 PS low-boost guise; the 90 PS intercooled version (as offered on the Mark VI Escort van) was not made available on the Courier van. Production of the Courier van ended in August 2002, and both it and the Escort van were replaced in September 2002 by the Ford Transit Connect, based on the Focus. However, after 11 years of no direct replacement, a van based on the Fiesta bearing the Transit Courier/Tourneo Courier name was revealed in Yenik√∂y, Turkey, in 2013 under Ford Otosan (Koc- Ford Motor Company Joint Venture).

While its front treatment is the same as the South African-built Fiesta-based Ford Bantam \\"bakkie\\" coupe utility, it has a completely different load box. The South African version had the short doors of the five-door hatchback and small quarter lights in the style of larger extended cab pickups, and the Brazilian version had the three-door's longer doors and no quarter windows. Its load capacity is . Until 1999, the Courier used the Endura 1.3-liter engine and the Zetec-SE 1.4-l 16v engine. The Mk IV 1.4 16v Zetec-SE has a top speed of and can accelerate from in 12 seconds. Since 2000, both engines were replaced by the Zetec Rocam 1.6-liter. The Mk V 1.6 model has top speed of and can accelerate from 0‚Äì100 km/h in 10 seconds. Its dimensions are wheelbase, length, width and height. From 2013, the plant in S√£o Bernardo do Campo in Brazil has suspended the manufacturing model for ordinary consumers and business, but Ford has not confirmed that the model was taken from line definitely. Despite Ford not confirming that the Courier was taken from line definitely, the Courier had seemed to end production and was possibly replaced by the Ford Ranger (T6). In Mexico, it stopped being sold after 2010.

It has a traditional village green complete with duck pond and a Norman church, and was once described as \\"one of the loveliest villages in England, with a ravishing variety of ancient cottages\\". The village is now home to Writtle College, one of the UK's oldest and largest land-based colleges and a partner institution of the University of Essex, the grounds of which once housed a Royal hunting lodge, later the possession of the De Brus and De Bohun families. The suggestion that Writtle is the birthplace of Robert the Bruce, as well as his father Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale, is contested, though its possession and use by both is incontrovertible. From 1996 until 2017 Writtle hosted the annual southern V Festival within the grounds of Sir John Comyn's Hylands Park. At the 2001 census, it had a population of 5,632, decreasing to 5,383 at the 2011 Census.

It appears in a charter circa 1136 as Writela. This was originally the name of the River Wid, as attested in an Anglo-Saxon charter of 692 where the river appears as Writolaburna. This name is thought to mean 'babbling burn or brook'.Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, p.539.

National Archives, SC 8/95/4727 National Archives, SC 8/104/5151 It was in Writtle in 1302 that Robert had married his second wife, Elizabeth de Burgh; there is some evidence to suggest he was also born in the village rather than in Turnberry Castle, but the story is possibly conflated with that of his father of the same name. Another well known historic figure who lived in Writtle was Sir John Petre (1549‚Äì1613).https://www.flickr.com/photos/60861613@N00/4094206042/ He sat as a member of parliament for Essex from 1584 to 1587 and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Essex. In 1603 he was raised to the peerage as Baron John Petre, the first baron of Writtle. Baron Petre publicly acknowledged that he was a Roman Catholic and refused to follow the Church of England during the time of Queen Elizabeth I and King James I. He died in October 1613, aged 63, and was succeeded in the barony by his son William, who later married Katherine Somerset. One person from Writtle who did help to bring about the English Reformation was Dr. John Bastwick (1593‚Äì1654), a religious zealot who opposed Roman Catholic ceremonial in the years before the outbreak of the English Civil War.http://www.writtlevillage.co.uk/ In August 1914 the 4th Battalion of the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry Regiment arrived in Writtle. The 4th Ox and Bucks Bn was part of the Territorial Force, or volunteer reserve, of the British Army. While in Writtle the men underwent physical and military training. On 14 October 1914 they paraded in the grounds of Hylands House in the presence of King George V. The Ox and Bucks left Writtle in April 1915.John W. Trusler. 2008.

The V-2 fell about 200 yards south of the River Wid bridge in a field belonging to Skeggs Farm. The impact crater was 30 feet across by 20 feet deep. 19 properties were extensively damaged and a further 218 slightly damaged including All Saints' Church.

In the early 1920s it was the site of the experimental Marconi station 2MT (\\"Two Emma Toc\\"), from where Captain Peter Eckersley made the name of the village famous with his station announcement \\"this is Two Emma Toc, Writtle testing, Writtle testing\\". The prefabricated hut from which the broadcast was made (constructed for use during the First World War, but never shipped to the war zone) was later relocated to King's Road primary school in Chelmsford, and has now been re- erected with replica equipment at the Sandford Mill museum, near Sandon. The Writtle transmission station was also the last independent outside the BBC, suspending transmission in January 1923. Independent radio did not re-emerge in the UK till the 1960s. Writtle Church Writtle green and church, in snow, about 1935 The Domesday Book mentioning a church and priest in Writtle suggests that Christian worship in the village pre-dated the Norman Conquest; the early-13th-century nave and chancel seem to be extensions of an 11th- century construction, which itself replaced a Saxon church. During the mediaeval period, the church \\"changed hands\\" several times, revenues being received by the Prior of Bermondsey in the 12th century, and then by the Hospital of the Holy Ghost in Rome from the early 13th; the turbulent reign of Richard II saw the church being seized by the king, eventually coming under the control of William of Wykeham's New College, Oxford in 1399.All Saints Parish Church Building History The church has twice suffered arson attacks in recent history, the first in 1974, the second in 1991.

It is bounded by Ocean Parkway to the west; Avenue T and Kings Highway to the north; Nostrand Avenue and Gerritsen Avenue to the east; and the Atlantic Ocean to the south. Sheepshead Bay is abutted by the neighborhoods of Brighton Beach and Homecrest to the west; Midwood to the north; and Gerritsen Beach to the east. The neighborhood is named after a bay that separates mainland Brooklyn from the eastern portion of Coney Island, which was originally one of the Outer Barrier islands but is now a peninsula. The mouth of the bay is about southwest of Marine Park. Sheepshead Bay is part of Brooklyn Community District 15, and its primary ZIP Codes are 11229 and 11235. It is patrolled by the 61st Precinct of the New York City Police Department. Politically it is represented by the New York City Council's 46th and 48th Districts. History = Fishing and tourism destination = Races, c. 1872‚Äì1887 The name \\"Sheepshead Bay\\" applies to the neighborhood north of the bay as well as the bay itself. Sheepshead Bay was named for the sheepshead, an edible fish found in the bay's waters. Originally an extension of the town of Gravesend to the west, Sheepshead Bay was a secluded fishing and farming community early in its history. Starting in the 1840s, residents of Brooklyn and Manhattan were drawn to the community as a summer destination. Hunters and fishermen started coming to Sheepshead Bay and various restaurants and hotels were erected. Sheepshead Bay's allure as a fishing destination was further helped by the opening of Ocean Avenue in 1876 and the extension of the Long Island Rail Road's Manhattan Beach Branch in 1877‚Äì1878, which brought visitors both to the community of Sheepshead Bay and to the Manhattan Beach resort across the bay. The first of the community's farms was split up into several lots for residential development in 1877. Three years later the Sheepshead Bay Race Track opened in the neighborhood, bringing even more visitors during the spring and fall. Near the racecourse, racing investor William Collins Whitney constructed a raining track. A \\"Millionaire's Row\\" was built on Emmons Avenue east of East 27th Street, while socialites tended to go to restaurants such as Tappan's. The track would continue to operate as a horse-racing course until 1910 when horse betting was criminalized in New York state. Afterward it operated as an auto racing track from 1915 to 1919. The decline of the Sheepshead Bay Race Track, along with the construction of amusement parks at nearby Coney Island and the proximity of Coney Island's attractions to the newly built subway, led to the decline of Sheepshead Bay as a tourist destination. Passenger rail service on the Manhattan Beach Branch ceased in 1924, and the line was formally abandoned in 1937. The former race track site was subdivided for the construction of housing, and Millionaire's Row was soon lined with bungalows. The closure of the race track resulted in a plethora of newly vacant plots in the community of Sheepshead Bay, and by extension, an influx of residents. = Filling of creek and waterfront development = left The bay itself was originally the easterly entrance to Coney Island Creek, which was long and minimally navigable through the 20th century.Sergey Kadinsky, Hidden Waters blog Companion blog for the book \\"Hidden Waters of NYC\\" Canal Avenue, Brooklyn A map from 1898 shows that numerous inlets protruded from the bay into the community. From the late 19th century through the early 20th century there were plans to turn the creek into the Gravesend Ship Canal.NYC Parks Dept Coney Island Creek Park The plan including re- dredging the creek into a canal running in a straight east-west line and filling all the marsh land either side of the creek to expand the urban grid to the edge of the canal. However, this never happened. Squan Creek, a tributary of the Coney Island Creek, ran through the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood. While Squan Creek was infilled in the 1920s, its route is still evidenced by Sheepshead Bay Road's crooked route through the street grid, as well as the presence of several dead-end streets that used to abut the creek's route. With the development of the Sheepshead Bay community into a residential neighborhood, there were efforts to improve the facilities on the waterfront. The channel of the Sheepshead Bay waterway was dredged by 1916 to allow fishing boats to dock there; previously these craft had to dock at Canarsie. In 1922 the New York City Dock Commission proposed to dredge the bays further, build bulkheads on the shore, and widen Emmons Avenue on the waterfront from . 25 piers would be built on the south side of Emmons Avenue while 26 buildings, including a new Lundy's Restaurant location, would be built on the north side. Residents expressed concerns that the bay might become a commercial shipping port, and local fishermen opposed the city's plan to establish a fish market there. A compromise to use Sheepshead Bay only for private and charter boats was reached in 1929, and the city built several piers at an angle from the bulkhead to prevent trucks from loading onto these piers. In 1931, the city condemned several buildings on the bay shore, including the original Lundy's Restaurant, to widen Emmons Avenue. The Great Depression delayed further progress, as these buildings would not be destroyed until mid-1934, and construction started on new buildings on Emmons Avenue's northern sidewalk. At that point a newspaper article noted that Emmons Avenue had been \\"transformed by attractive looking restaurants and stores.\\" In 1936, the city and the owners of the condemned buildings reached a monetary settlement, and by the following year, the channel had been dredged and ten docks had been constructed. The filling-in of the central part of the Coney Island during the 1930s, in conjunction with construction of the Shore Parkway portion of the Belt Parkway. Shore Parkway opened in 1941, and soon afterward, the last remaining farms in Sheepshead Bay were redeveloped into residential buildings. = Later development = Sheepshead Bay became populated by Jewish and Soviet immigrants during the late 20th century, similar to neighboring Brighton Beach. In 1978, in one of the largest disasters in Sheepshead Bay's modern history, six firefighters were killed while fighting a Waldbaum's supermarket fire. Sheepshead Bay did not undergo the white flight and high crime that afflicted other New York City neighborhoods. Lundy's closed in 1979, resulting in the closure of retail on Emmons Avenue. After the closure of Lundy's, Sheepshead Bay transformed from a predominantly Irish and Italian enclave into a more racially diverse neighborhood, and the population became increasingly elderly. Recreational fishing along the bay also started to decline in the surrounding community. In the 1970s, the city created a maritime zoning district on Emmons Avenue to promote waterfront development. In the last decade of the 20th century, a real estate boom brought the reopening of Lundy's Restaurant, which was made a city landmark in 1992. Furthermore, Loehmann's proposed a store in Sheepshead Bay in 1993, the first major development in the area in several years, though the city rejected initial plans for the development after community opposition. After another proposal for a Loehmann's shopping center was rejected, Mayor Rudy Giuliani's administration approved a smaller version of the shopping center in the late 1990s. Meanwhile, the reopening of Lundy's in 1995 spurred a wave of development on Emmons Avenue. By March 1996, property owners reported that real estate prices had doubled and that vacant apartments were being occupied. With new development, housing prices in the area increased sharply, and there were concerns about a dearth of parking, since the new developments had collectively resulted in the removal of 2,000 parking spots in Sheepshead Bay. Also in the mid-1990s, a small amusement park called Fun Time USA opened on Knapp Street, operating for almost 11 years before closing in 2005. Lundy's closed again in 2007; a shopping center now takes its place. Soviet-style restaurants/nightclubs, such as Paradise and Baku Palace, have opened along the waterfront. Sheepshead Bay has also experienced a growth of condominium developments, and on Emmons Avenue, the northern shoreline street along the bay, are piers boasting an active seafood market and tour boats.  Land use  Sheepshead Bay is mostly residential. Low-density, one-and-two-family attached and semi-attached houses are common near the western and eastern edges of the neighborhood. Higher-density condominiums and co-ops are more common near Ocean Avenue, at the center of the neighborhood. Demographics alt= Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Sheepshead Bay was 64,518, a change of ‚àí78 (‚àí0.1%) from the 64,596 counted in 2000.

It is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the south and east, by Sheepshead Bay on the north, and Brighton Beach to the west. Traditionally known as an Italian and Ashkenazi Jewish neighborhood, it is also home to a sizable community of Sephardi Jews and a large Russian Jewish immigrant presence.

History Manhattan Beach Hotel Manhattan Beach was the most upscale of the three major resort areas that developed at Coney Island shortly after the American Civil War; the other two areas were Brighton Beach and West Brighton. It was developed in the last quarter of the 19th century as a resort by Austin Corbin, later president of the Long Island Rail Road, for whom the street Corbin Place, which marks the boundary between Brighton Beach and Manhattan Beach, was named.The New York and Manhattan Beach Railway, LIRR History. Accessed June 4, 2007. \\"Immediately the whole purpose of the new RR was changed from freight to passenger, in order to service Corbin‚Äôs proposed line to the site of his immense Manhattan Beach Hotel that was being constructed on the east end of Coney Island.\\" In 1877, Corbin built the famous Manhattan Beach Hotel, followed by the even grander Oriental Hotel in 1880. The Coney Island Jockey Club horse racing track opened nearby at the same time as Corbin's Oriental Hotel; together, these three establishments drew thousands of visitors to Manhattan Beach. The hotels held daily concerts led by famous conductors such as Conterno, Gilmore, and John Philip Sousa, and hosted elaborate nightly fireworks displays, drawing tens of thousands of visitors on summer nights and making Manhattan Beach a renowned summer seaside resort. Sousa composed the \\"Manhattan Beach\\" march in 1893 to commemorate the beach resort. Corbin, an anti-Semite who served as the secretary of the American Society for the Suppression of Jews, barred Jews from the resort.Marc R. Matrana, Lost Plantations of the South, Oxford, Mississippi: University Press of Mississippi, 2009, pp. 40‚Äì43Leonard Benardo, Jennifer Weiss, Street Cred, The New York Times, February 25, 2007 In 1895, Corbin built a 12,000 capacity third-mile concrete cycling track behind the hotel at a cost of $30,000. The U.S. Coast Guard operated a training station at Manhattan Beach during World War II. After the deterioration of the hotel industry in the area, the site of the former Manhattan Beach hotel was developed into a residential area and into Manhattan Beach Park by the New York City Parks Department. Manhattan Beach Park opened to the public in 1955, to alleviate crowding at the neighboring beaches of Coney Island and Brighton Beach, and continues to serve the public today. From 1954 to 1959, the neighborhood was home to Manhattan Beach Air Force Station. From the 1980s, Manhattan Beach has become an enclave for higher end middle class Russian Jews.

It lies off the A42, 4.5 miles (7.25 km) south of Ashby de la Zouch, within the National Forest. Historically in Derbyshire, it lay in an enclave absorbed into Leicestershire in 1897. The name is thought to mean \\"homestead on the River Mease\\". History =Early history= The village name Meas-Ham suggests it was founded in the Saxon period between AD 350 and 1000. Just before the Norman Conquest of 1066, the village belonged to \\"Earl Algar\\". The Domesday Book of 1086 has it as belonging directly to the King, as part of a royal estate centred at Repton. Its taxable value as assessed at a mere 2 geld units, containing land for three ploughs, 20 acres (8 ha) of meadow, and a square furlong (10 acres, 4 ha) of woodland. =Middle Ages= The manor passed from the crown to the Earls of Chester. In 1235 it was in the possession of Clementia (Clemence de Foug√®res), widow of Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester. Measham Museum states that the manor belonged to the De Measham family, which held it until 1308. Given the ownership by the crown and then the Earls of Chester, neither actually resident, it appears the De Measham family held the manor as feudal tenants, rather than formal owners, probably in return for military service. By the 13th century, the rights to the church appear to have passed to Repton Priory, as in 1272 King Henry III issued a charter including Measham among several churches and chapelries it possessed. The original chapel of ease dated from 1172, but the present St Laurence's Church was built in 1340, under the auspices of Repton Priory. On 24 March 1311, King Edward II granted charters to William de Bereford, Lord of the Manor of Measham, to hold a market and a fair. The charters allowed for a market on Tuesdays and an annual three-day fair around the festival of the Translation of St Thomas the Martyr (7 July). By 1817 both market and fair had ceased. This medieval settlement is thought to have been mainly agricultural, but coalmining is known to have taken place as early as the 13th century. Indeed William De Bereford died getting coal; records of his death show the village's coal resources to have been worth 13s 4d (¬£0.67) a year. In 1355, Edmund de Bereford, son of William, died leaving the manor of Measham to three heirs: Joan de Ellesfield, John de Maltravers and Margaret de Audley. During the 15th century, the manor came into the hands of Walter Blount, 1st Baron Mountjoy. In 1454, the manor was in the possession of Sir William Babington at the time of his death; and in 1474 it was in the possession of John Babington (presumably his son). =16th‚Äì17th centuries= In 1596 Measham was dismissed by William Wyrley as \\"a village belonging to Lord Shefield, in which are many coal mines, [but] little else worthy of remembrance.\\" It was omitted altogether from Richard Blome's gazetteer of market towns in 1673. In 1563 the manor belonged to Walter Blount, 1st Baron Mountjoy. However, by 1616 it had passed to Sir Francis Anderson, only to return to the Sheffield family, as it was owned by Edmund Sheffield, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Normanby in 1712. =18th‚Äì19th centuries= Measham Hall: Built 1767, demolished 1959 due to mining subsidence The manor passed to William Wollaston. He sold it in 1780 to Joseph Wilkes for ¬£50,000, on whose death it was bought by Rev. Thomas Fisher. In 1767, William Abney built an alternative manor at Measham Field, north-east of the village, which by 1817 had passed to his son Edward. This would become known as Measham Hall, a seven-bay mid-Georgian mansion. However, the advent of coalmining caused the Hall to suffer subsidence. It was demolished by the National Coal Board in 1959. By the early 19th century, Measham church was still associated with Repton parish, as a \\"parochial chapelry\\". Industry Sundial commemorating Joseph Wilkes, by the artist Steve Field, erected in 2009, near the former railway station Around the time of Joseph Wilkes, Measham went through a prosperous period associated with the Industrial Revolution. This lasted into the 20th century. At the beginning of the 19th century, Ashby Canal was built through the village. The Ashby and Nuneaton Joint Railway followed, opening towards the end of the century. The village was also on the main Birmingham‚ÄìNottingham road (later the A453). It became a hub of local industry, famous for its brickworks: Joseph Wilkes's \\"Jumb Bricks\\" were enlarged to reduce payments of brick tax. The village industry included banking, breweries, coal mines and brick-making (with clay from local clay pits), a tramway, and boot, lace, cotton, carding and bleach mills. A market hall was said to have been built by Wilkes about the turn of the 19th century, but by 1817 the market had ceased and the market-house at 58 High Street was being converted into a dwelling. This later became known as Cross House. The original market place was an area to the rear in Queen Street, now a car park. The village Baptist chapel was built in 1811, although Baptist ministers had been active since the 1730s. A Temperance Hall built in 1852 now serves as the Age Concern building. In 1839 the village received an official visit from Queen Adelaide, who in her widowhood frequented the area, staying at nearby Gopsall Park, home of her previous Lord Chamberlain, The Earl of Howe. Queen Street was named in her honour after her visit. Measham High Street By 1848 the population had reached 1,615. A further Methodist chapel and a Catholic church were built. The latter, funded by a local lady aristocrat, has since been demolished for housing. =20th‚Äì21st centuries= Measham Station before renovation Measham continued to grow residentially and industrially in the 20th and 21st centuries. Large council and private housing estates were built and the population reached 4,849 in 2001. Development of a British Car Auctions site in the south-west of the village after the Second World War prompted what has become the Westminster Industrial Estate. The 20th century also brought periods of sharp decline. Passenger services on the Ashby and Nuneaton Joint Railway ceased in 1931. Freight traffic continued until 1971, after which the line was dismantled. Ashby Canal similarly closed in 1957. The traditional industries began to die, with the boot and shoe factory closing in the 1960s and Measham Colliery in 1986. The 1960s saw many of the village's fine buildings demolished, including the Manor House, Measham Hall and the Vicarage. Development has resumed in recent years. Years of neglect and disrepair at Measham's former railway station ended when it was turned into new premises for the Measham Museum. The old engine sheds have become industrial workshops and the engine yards a millennium garden and public green space. A new library and a leisure centre were also built in the last decade, and there are plans to resuscitate the canal. Due to housing being constructed along the original route through Measham, the canal will follow the route of the old railway, with a wharf, adjacent visitors' centre, shops and caf√©s planned for the village centre. Measham teapots Measham has a long pottery history: extraction of clay was recorded in the 13th century. The Measham Ware associated with canals and narrow boats was made from the last quarter of the 19th century until about 1914 (other sources say 1910), not in Measham, but in nearby villages, mainly Church Gresley. It is thought to have gained the name \\"Measham\\" from large sales by Mrs Anne Bonas from a shop in Measham High Street. Measham ware has a dark brown Rockingham glaze with white-clay additions colourfully painted, usually with flowers and often a personal motto. Most commonly seen are teapots, often with a miniature-teapot shape as a finial. Earliest known production was in 1870 by William Mason of Church Gresley (later Mason Cash); this list refers to pieces as Motto Ware, later also Barge Ware due to canal associations. Measham Ware was popular with canal people. On passing through Measham on the Ashby Canal, they would place their order for a personalised teapot as they passed through and collect it on their next visit. Measham Ware was also popular among farm labourers in Norfolk and Suffolk: after harvesting in their own counties, they often travelled to Burton Upon Trent to work in the maltings and other industries associated with brewing. Measham Ware became a popular gift to take home. Locals often bought them as wedding gifts, passing them down the generations at weddings. Production of Measham Ware ended around 1910‚Äì1914, although modern reproductions have been produced more recently. There is a large collection in the Measham Museum. London's Victoria and Albert Museum also has an example on display. Woodville as \\"Wooden Box\\" Rail transport The nearest main line railway station is Atherstone (11 miles, 18 km). Others nearby are Burton-on- Trent, Leicester, Tamworth and Nuneaton. Former Measham station, now a museum A branch of the Ashby and Nuneaton Joint Railway (ANJR) opened to Measham in 1873, with through services to Burton-on Trent, Leicester, Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Moira and Shackerstone, allowing changes for Coalville and Loughborough via Hugglescote. The station closed in 1931, but the line stayed open until 1970, when British Rail closed the Shackerstone‚ÄìMeasham section. The stub to Moira remained for coal traffic from Donisthorpe Colliery until 1981. The Battlefield Line Railway, a surviving section of the ANJR, now runs services to Shenton via Market Bosworth. It had been hoped to extend this to Snarestone, but nothing came of it. Leicestershire County Council recently renovated the station building as part of the Ashby Canal restoration, to serve as premises for the Measham Museum. Minorca opencast In 2011 UK Coal received planning permission to develop an opencast coal mine on the site of the former Minorca colliery on the outskirts of Measham. Measuring by , it will yield of coal over five years, and of clay. The development has been opposed by some local residents worried about environmental effects and vehicle noise. Minorca open cast coal mine entrance in 2013 Sport The local football team is called Measham Imperial, nicknamed \\"The Imps\\". It currently plays in the North Leicestershire Windmills League Division Three. Measham Welfare Football Club also fields various teams and offers football to local children of 6‚Äì18, as well as an adults' first team and reserve team. The club is based at Measham Leisure Centre. Measham hosts the National Forest Taekwondo group, which started in 2013 and trains at the Church Hall. It welcomes all practitioners from the age of eight up, and covers training in all areas of this Olympic sport, from self-defence to the traditional patterns.

Developed in response to a government- sponsored competition in support of the new doctrine of \\"aerial first aid\\", it was employed exclusively in the overseas colonies, specifically Morocco and Syria. Unlike the MB.80 prototype, the MB.81 had a closed cockpit and a somewhat larger cargo space. This was the company's first design to reach production. History The aircraft was designed to be able to seek patients or casualties by scouting, even at high altitudes, during military operations in mountainous countries, like then-French Morocco over the Atlas Mountains. The main design feature made it possible to transport a casualty lying prone, in a compartment placed between the pilot and the engine. The wings could also be adapted to hold casualties, remaining constantly under the sight of the pilot and connected to him by an Aviaphone communication system. The MB.80 made its first flight at the beginning of summer 1932 in Villacoublay, piloted by Zacharie Heu. An all-metal monoplane with low wings, it was equipped with a French Lorraine 5Pc of which allowed it to reach a speed of at an altitude of It was able to take off in and to land in . In a 1932 test, the MB.80 carried out 209 landings in thirty-six hours without any problems. The aircraft was built without any assistance from the government, but an initial order of 20 was placed by the Ground French Forces (the French Arm√©e de l'Air was founded in 1933), and it was one of the aircraft that relaunched Marcel Bloch in the aeronautical construction industry. The production model, called the MB.81, was fitted with a French Salmson 9Nd of 128.68 kW (175 hp). It took part in military operations in Morocco and in Syria at the beginning of the 1930s. The MB.81 entered service in 1935, and was used extensively throughout North Africa and the Middle East. A few were used in 1939-1940, before the French surrender, and in July 1941 in the battle for Syria between the Vichy French and the British/Free French.

Dukakis Transportation Center at South Station‚Äîis the largest railroad station and intercity bus terminal in Greater Boston and New England's second-largest transportation center after Logan International Airport. Located at the intersection of Atlantic Avenue and Summer Street in Dewey Square, Boston, Massachusetts, the historic station building was constructed in 1899 to replace the downtown terminals of several railroads. Today, it serves as a major intermodal domestic transportation hub, with service to the Greater Boston region and the Midwestern and Northeastern United States. It is used by thousands of commuter rail and intercity rail passengers daily. Connections to the rapid transit Red Line and bus rapid transit Silver Line are made through the adjacent subway station. The station was renamed for former Massachusetts governor Michael S. Dukakis in November 2014, though maps and station signs continue to use the shorter \\"South Station\\". History =Need for a combined station= When the railroads serving Boston were first laid out and built, each one stopped at its own terminal. The four terminals serving the south-side railroads were as follows: * The New York and New England Railroad crossed the Fort Point Channel from South Boston, just south of the present Summer Street Bridge, and terminated just east of Dewey Square (right at the north end of today's South Station). * The Old Colony Railroad had a long passenger terminal on the east side of South Street, stretching from Kneeland Street south to Harvard Street. This site is now part of the South Bay Interchange, near the South Station bus terminal. * The Boston and Albany Railroad's passenger terminal was in the block bounded by Kneeland Street, Beach Street, Albany Street (now Surface Artery) and Lincoln Street. This later became a freight house, and is now a block in Chinatown; the passenger terminal was moved to the west side of Utica Street, from Kneeland Street south to a bit past Harvard Street, now part of the South Bay Interchange. * The Boston and Providence Railroad continued straight where it now merges with the Boston and Albany, terminating at Park Square, with the passenger terminal on the south side of Providence Street from Columbus Avenue west about two-thirds of the way to Berkeley Street. By the late 19th century, the New England, Old Colony, and Boston & Providence had been acquired by the New York & New Haven Railroad, while the B&A; was acquired by the New York Central Railroad. However, the four separate terminals remained. The Boston Terminal Company, established in 1897, was charged with the task of consolidating service from the four terminals at a single terminal (a union station). =Early years= South Station opened in 1899 at a cost of $3.6 million (1899 dollars). The architects were Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge of Boston, and the construction was undertaken by the engineering firm of Westinghouse, Church, Kerr & Co. The station opened on January 1 for use by Old Colony Division and Midland Division trains, the latter of which had been using the Old Colony terminal since August 22, 1896 to allow for construction. B&A; trains began using South Station on July 23, followed by Providence Division trains on September 10 (along with the opening of Back Bay station). It became the busiest station in the world by 1913. A stop on the Atlantic Avenue Elevated served South Station from 1901 to 1938; what is now the Red Line subway was extended from Park Street to South Station in 1913. The train shed, originally one of the largest in the world, was eliminated in a 1930 renovation due to corrosion caused by the nearby ocean's salt air. In the original configuration, two tracks came off each approach to join into a four-track line and then run under the main platforms in a two- track loop. These tracks were never put into service, and later became a parking lot and bowling alley for employees. While the station handled 125,000 passengers each day during World War II, post-war passenger rail traffic declined in the US. In 1959, the New Haven's Old Colony Division‚Äìsuccessor of the Old Colony Railroad‚Äìwhich had served the South Shore and Cape Cod, stopped passenger service. The New Haven itself went bankrupt in 1961. South Station was sold to the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) in 1965.Great American Stations: South Station Portions of the station were demolished and the land was used to build the Boston South Postal Annex and the Stone and Webster building. In the early 1970s, the BRA developed plans to demolish the rest of the station and replace it with a multi-use development including a new train station, a bus station, a parking garage, and commercial structures. The plan was never realized, and South Station was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. =Renovation= In 1978, the BRA sold what was left of the station to the MBTA, though the BRA retained air rights over the station. Funding was obtained for a major renovation of the station that was completed in 1989. A total of 13 tracks became available, all with high level platforms and some capable of handling 12-car trains. Piers were installed for the eventual construction of an office building and bus station above the tracks. This renovation also added direct access to the Red Line subway station from inside the surface station lobby; previously, the only access was via street stairwells. (MIT class project) Unused tracks in 1970, prior to the renovation The main passenger concourse in 1970 The renovated terminal interior in 2010, with tracks accessible through the glass doors After some delays, an inter-city bus terminal opened in October 1995, replacing one on top of the I-93 Dewey Square Tunnel diagonally across from the station between Summer Street and Congress Street. The new bus terminal has direct ramp connections to I-93 and the Massachusetts Turnpike. The renovations, including the bus terminal, cost $195 million in 2001 dollars. In September 2017, the Ashkenazy Acquisition Corporation, which also owns the Faneuil Hall Marketplace, purchased the 98-year lease on the office space and concourse areas of the station.http://nerej.com/ashkenazy-acquisition-corp-purchases- boston-s-south-stationfrom the Blackstone Group for $123.2 million.http://www.crenews.com/general_news/general/ashkenazy-pays-$1232mln- for-bostons-south-station-retail-office-component.html In August 2019, the Federal Railroad Administration awarded MassDOT up to $41.2 million to replace much of the Tower 1 interlocking outside South Station. The remaining $41 million of the $82 million project will be funded by Amtrak and the MBTA. =South Station Tower= When the Boston Redevelopment Authority sold South Station to the MBTA in 1977, the BRA retained the air rights over the tracks. The South Station Tower complex, which is being built on the air rights, will include a 51-story, 678-foot skyscraper and an expansion of the bus terminal. Construction began in January 2020 and is expected to take 4 years. The tower is being built on foundations put in place when the station was last renovated. The project will include an expansion of the outdoor waiting area with a new arched roof, a roof covering the entire platform area, a new entrance from Dorchester Avenue, and a more direction connection to the bus terminal. Design and description =Architecture= The never-used lower- level loop platforms thumb220pxrightThe Boston Terminal Company 1897 commemorative plaque in South Station. The names on it are: * Josiah Quincy, Mayor of Boston * The Boston Terminal Company: Samuel Hoar, Royal Chapin Taft, Charles Peter Clark, Charles Loughead Lovering, Francis Lee Higginson; trustees * George B. Francis; resident engineer * Norcross Brothers; builders * Shepley, Rutan & Coolidge; architects * Fayette Samuel Curtis, Walter Shepard, Lawson Bennett Bidwell; consulting engineers The South Station head house and wings incorporate Neoclassical architecture. The building's symmetry and stone fa√ßade are common to the style. The granite came from nearby quarries in New England. The main doorways are located in a section that protrudes from the curving shape of the building. The doors are housed under tall arches that give the impression of grandeur while also making the building appear smaller from far away. This visual trick is common in classical buildings and is further amplified by the oversized windows and large balustrade on the third floor and roof.  * ] Above the doorways are classical Ionic order columns that ostensibly hold up the frieze and pediment. Uncommon for Ionic order columns is the lack of fluting, which is usually used to draw the eye upward, increasing the grandeur of the facade. The numerous projections and recessions on the fa√ßade attribute to the planar quality of the building, while also creating interesting shading and lighting patterns on the stone and within the building. Inside, a coffered ceiling adorns the terminal and protects travelers from the rain and snow. Constructed over 100 years ago, the clock on top of the main head house is the largest operating hand-wound clock mechanism in New England. The clock is styled after London's Big Ben, and has a wide face. The mechanism weighs over . In 2008, the clock underwent a six-week restoration and repair. The clock mechanism was completely disassembled and transported to a nearby workshop, where replacement pieces had to be fabricated by hand. The clock, once one of many in the city, is a hallmark of a bygone era‚Äîsomething that commuters rely on to make their trains, and which visitors admire for its historical presence. The stone eagle that sits atop the clock is wide and weighs over eight tons. The eagle imitates the figurines commonly placed atop classically styled buildings. The curved shape of the building facade pushes its presence into the surrounding area, making it much more prominent. This also gives the building a more distinctive and accessible main entrance from Atlantic Avenue, Summer Street, and Dewey Square. A similar concept is also seen in the Santa Maria della Pace in Rome, Italy. This church didn't directly influence South Station, but the designs clearly share the same effects on the immediate area. In the 1980s, with South Station in disrepair, a great effort began to revitalize the station using Federal funding. The revitalization included addition of two wings that extend from each side of the head house, constructed with granite from the same quarries to provide a consistent appearance. Renovation and expansion was completed in 1989, reinvigorating the area with a vital transportation link and a strong focal point. Office buildings began rising nearby, expanding the downtown area. With the completion of the Big Dig and the Rose Kennedy Greenway, South Station has become an even more important feature in the area. The Greenway provides a pedestrian-friendly connection between South Station and North Station.French & Fowler, The Renovation of Boston‚Äôs South Station, 2003 =Services= * South Station is the northern terminus of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, and is therefore the northernmost stop of its Acela Express and Northeast Regional trains.

Bus terminal Boston's main inter-city bus terminal, the South Station Bus Terminal, is housed in a separate building built over the train platforms along Atlantic Avenue. The bus terminal hosts service by Greyhound, Peter Pan, and other bus companies; to all of New England, New York City, upstate New York, Atlantic City (New Jersey), Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., the mid-Atlantic states, and Montreal, Canada. The bus terminal has its own concession area, and can be entered from the railway platform area or directly from Atlantic Avenue. North Station connections Several MBTA commuter rail lines, plus Amtrak's Downeaster service to Maine, originate from North Station, located about around the Boston peninsula from South Station; there has not been a direct connection between the two since the closure of the Atlantic Avenue Elevated in 1938. Transfers from North Station to all other Amtrak trains and the MBTA Commuter Rail's Providence/Stoughton, Needham, Franklin and Framingham/Worcester lines may be made at Back Bay (via a one-seat ride on the Orange Line), transfers from the Fitchburg Line to South Station lines can be made via Porter on the Red Line (a one-seat ride to South Station), and transfers from the Newburyport/Rockport Line to South Station lines can be made via Bellingham Square station on the Silver Line (also a one-seat ride to South Station). All other transferring passengers have to change subway trains at either Park Street for the Green Line or Downtown Crossing for the Orange Line, both of which stop at North Station, thus requiring two different rapid transit lines for the relatively short traverse between South and North Stations. A North‚ÄìSouth Rail Link has been proposed to unify the two halves of the rail system, to make passenger transfers much easier and faster. However, as of May 2006, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has withdrawn its sponsorship of the proposal due to its high cost. The North‚ÄìSouth Rail Link is not mentioned in the MBTA's FY2010‚ÄìFY2014 Capital Investment Program. Currently, passenger equipment is transferred between the two halves of the system via the Grand Junction Railroad, which is not used in revenue passenger service. Accessibility The commuter rail and Amtrak platforms are fully accessible, with level access from the main station entrance and the waiting area onto the high-level platforms. Most southside commuter rail stations are also handicapped accessible, but some stations (mostly on the Framingham/Worcester Line and Franklin Line) are not. Most Amtrak stations on the Lake Shore Limited and the Northeast Corridor routes are also accessible. Elevators are provided for handicapped access to the subway station. The bus station can be reached via the track 1 platform. See MBTA accessibility. South Station Expansion Project Wide view of the concourse in 2020 South Station at evening rush hour, Monday, February 11, 2013 after the February 2013 nor'easter As a major transfer station offering connections to multiple modes, South Station is expected to see additional passenger throughput as a result of system improvements and a general increase in ridership. The existing underground Red Line and Silver Line stations are adequate for the near future, but the surface-level commuter rail and Amtrak platforms are at capacity. A proposed relocation of the Boston General Mail Facility, which is located on Dorchester Avenue next to the station tracks, would allow for increased capacity at South Station. Seven more tracks are planned to be added to the existing thirteen tracks, allowing increased use by both MBTA Commuter Rail and Amtrak trains. In October 2010, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts was awarded a $32.5 million grant from the federal government to begin planning for this expansion. After deliberations, a $43 million contract (including $10.5 million in state funds) was awarded in August 2012. The planning project will advance the new station area, including a possible passenger mezzanine over the platforms, to the 30% design level. Other elements include a redesign of the South Station interlocking, new commuter rail layover facilities, and the restoration of public access to the adjacent section of Dorchester Avenue and the Fort Point Channel, filling in a missing half-mile segment of the Boston Harborwalk. The station expansion is intended to allow for increases in commuter rail service on the Fairmount Line and Framingham/Worcester Line, addition of South Coast Rail service, and increased Amtrak frequencies. As of October 2014, purchasing of the postal facility is in limbo, as the Postal Service is not willing to accept the amount offered by the state. Part of this deal would include moving the facility to South Boston, with MassPort taking some of the Post Office's parking lot located across Fort Point Channel. The Final Environmental Impact Report for the South Station Expansion Project was released on June 30, 2016. The project would begin with the demolition of the postal facility and take 5 years to complete. The Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs approved the FEIR on August 12, 2016. The South Station Expansion Project has been opposed by a number of transportation advocates, community groups, and environmental groups, many of which instead advocate building a North‚ÄìSouth Rail Link (NSRL) through connection to North Station and points beyond, rather than expanding the dead-end storage capacity for trains at South Station. Prominent NSRL supporters include former Governor Michael S. Dukakis (Democrat) and former Governor William F. Weld (Republican), who have made joint public appearances regarding this issue. Based on their advocacy, MassDOT agreed to fund a $2 million study in February 2016. The NSRL reevaluation report was released in June 2018. Its tunnel options included a four-track maximum-service plan, estimated to cost $21.5 billion and three double-track routes ranging in cost from $12.3 to 14.7 billion. South Station expansion was estimated to cost $4.7 billion. These costs are in 2018 dollars and include purchasing additional rolling stock, other required infrastructure improvements and a 3.5% annual inflation rate.

In 2004, former company president Bruce Conrad sued Cornerstone, alleging that Kanjorski and relatives schemed to take over Conrad's stake in the company. In 2007, Politico revealed that the United States Navy wanted back a high-pressure pump that had been purchased by Cornerstone using taxpayer funds, but Cornerstone could not locate it. Later, the Navy concluded that Cornerstone did not produce anything valuable towards national defense. Political positions Like many Pennsylvania Democrats from outside Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, Kanjorski opposes gun control. He is also moderately conservative on abortion. However, he is strongly pro-labor, and has spoken out against the Iraq War. He has served on the Financial Services Committee since he entered Congress in 1985 and was the second-ranking Democrat on that committee at the time of his departure. He usually played behind-the-scenes roles in the advocacy or defeat of legislation and steers appropriations money toward improving the infrastructure and economic needs of his district. He is popularly known as \\"Kanjo.\\" On May 10, 2007, the usually moderate Kanjorski voted with fellow Democrats to begin the redeployment of all forces from Iraq, however the bill was defeated. As of the sixth anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2001, Kanjorski's position on the war in Iraq appeared to be that he would vote for redeployment, but not as a condition of continued funding for the war until and unless the expected presidential veto of such a bill would be overridden. After the August 1, 2007, collapse of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Kanjorski said he believed the $250,000,000 bill passed by Congress to rebuild the bridge was improper because it exceeded the normal $100,000,000 limit for emergency relief projects. He added in saying that Minnesotans \\"discovered they were going to get all the money from the federal government and they were taking all they could get\\" and that they took the opportunity \\"to screw us.\\" In March 2010, Kanjorski supported and voted for the federal health care reform legislation.Area‚Äôs reps to explain health votes  The Times Leader, Wilkes-Barre, PA . Timesleader.com. Retrieved on 2010-07-12. Later that year, Kanjorski was instrumental in the crafting of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, helping draft a considerable portion of this legislation. When the bill was signed into law by President Barack Obama in July 2010, Kanjorski appeared with fellow legislators by Obama's side as the President signed the legislation. One of Kanjorski's final votes in Congress, merely weeks before his final term ended, was a vote against the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010, legislation signed into law by President Obama in December 2010. Kanjorski's vote in opposition to the bill stemmed from his disenchantment with the fact that the legislation extended President George W. Bush's tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. =2008 financial crisis= In an interview on C-SPAN on January 27, 2009, Kanjorski defended the original emergency actions by the United States government to halt the 2008 financial crisis in September 2008. Kanjorski stated that the move to raise the guarantee money funds up to $250,000 was an emergency measure to stave off a massive money market \\"electronic run\\" on the banks that removed $550 billion from the system in a matter of hours on the morning of September 18. He further asserted that, if not stopped, the run would not only have caused the American economy to crash immediately, within 24 hours it would have brought down the world economy as well..

On February 10, 2009, the financial writer Daniel Gross subsequently confirmed some elements of the story on Countdown with Keith Olbermann, but he prefaced his remarks by saying \\"I don't know if his numbers are 100 percent correct\\". Felix Salmon of Cond√© Nast Portfolio also questioned why Kanjorski's account had not been stated before. Political campaigns In 1980, Dan Flood, who had represented the 11th District for most of the time since 1945, resigned. Kanjorski ran in the crowded special election as an independent, finishing behind State Representative Ray Musto. He ran against Musto in the Democratic primary later that year, but finished third. Musto lost to Republican James L. Nelligan in the general election. In 1984, after sitting out the 1982 campaign, Kanjorski defeated incumbent Frank G. Harrison, who had defeated Nelligan in 1982, in the primary.Defeated hopeful cites the legacy of Dan Flood. Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. April 12, 1984. He won the general election by a solid 17-point margin, even as Ronald Reagan carried the district in his landslide reelection bid. In 1986, Kanjorski faced a younger, well-financed Republican opponent in Marc Holtzman.Edsall, Thomas B. Holtzman maneuvers way from errand boy to candidate. Reading Eagle. December 26, 1985. The race was initially seen as one of the hottest in the country. However, Kanjorski won by 41 points, his largest margin of victory in a contested election. He was unopposed in 1988 and 1990 and did not face another credible opponent until 2002, when he faced Lou Barletta, the mayor of Hazleton. Kanjorski defeated Barletta by 13 points. The margin would have likely been closer had the state legislature not shifted heavily Democratic Scranton and most of surrounding Lackawanna County from the nearby 10th District to the 11th. It appeared that the Republican-controlled legislature wanted to protect the 10th's then-incumbent Republican, Don Sherwood, by packing the already heavily Democratic 11th with as many Democrats as possible. Scranton had anchored the 10th and its predecessors for almost a century‚Äîthough since the turn of the 20th Century the 10th was represented more often by Republican representatives than Democratic representatives. =2008= After facing no major-party opposition in 2004 and a nominal Republican challenger in 2006, Kanjorski faced Lou Barletta again in 2008. Since the 2002 race, Barletta had become well known for his opposition to illegal immigration. In 2008, Fox News broadcast a segment accusing Kanjorski of obtaining $10 million in earmarks for a company run by his family. Multiple polls had shown Kanjorski trailing by as many as five percentage points,Election 2008 - Latest Polls. RealClearPolitics. Retrieved on 2010-07-12. and the race was pegged as one of the nation's most competitive leading into the 2008 elections. Kanjorski was one of the few House Democrats in the Northeast in any danger of being unseated. However, Kanjorski won in a much more competitive race than his first matchup with Barletta, taking 52 percent of the vote to Barletta's 48 percent,Commonwealth of PA - Elections Information .

Kanjorski lost three of the district's five counties, including Luzerne County, where both he and Barletta live. However, as in 2002, Kanjorski swamped Barletta in Lackawanna County, winning by 12,500 votes (20 percent); he lost the area he had represented prior to the 2000 redistricting by almost 4,000 votes. =2010= Kanjorski won against Corey O'Brien and Brian Kelly in the May 2010 Democratic primary with 49.3% of the vote.Kanjorski wins easily; eyes Barletta rematch  The Times Leader, Wilkes-Barre, PA .

This time, Barletta managed to defeat Kanjorski with 55 percent of the vote, largely due to winning Luzerne County by almost 10,000 votes. Kanjorski was dogged by some of the more incendiary comments he made during the campaign, such as his comments about Republican gubernatorial candidate Rick Scott: \\"Instead of running for governor of Florida, they ought to have him and shoot him.

Its principal project is the Internet's largest website devoted to vexillology, containing comprehensive information about all kinds of flags, and an associated mailing list. The mailing list began as a discussion group in about September 1993, while the website was founded by Giuseppe Bottasini in late 1994, and Rob Raeside took over as director in 1998. Flags of the World became the 56th member of the FIAV in 2001. Flags of the World describes itself as \\"...an Internet group, the sole purpose of which is the advancement of the pursuit of vexillology, that is the creation and development of a body of knowledge about flags and flag usage of all types\\".Flags of the World mailing list rules, Part 4, Article 1. Both the website and the mailing list operate in the English language, though there are members from around the world and as such information from many languages is translated and included. The mailing list is monitored by the FOTW Listmaster, while work on the website is coordinated by the FOTW Editorial Director.  Website  An editorial staff of 21 unpaid volunteers manages and edits the FOTW website, which (as of 2013) contains more than 53,000 pages about flags and more than 102,000 images of flags, and also includes an extensive online dictionary of vexillology. The website is updated once a week with fresh material; some mirrors update monthly. Due to the high amount of material there is an editing backlog, causing some areas of FOTW to contain outdated information. There are also some mirrors that have not been updated for varying periods of time and which are therefore considered \\"historical\\". = Mailing list = The source for material on the FOTW website are contributions to the FOTW mailing list, which has over 1,000 members, of which some 100 are active contributors. The mailing list has notable minorities of Portuguese, French, Dutch, and Russian speakers. A staff of three unpaid volunteers manages and moderates the list.  Graphical conventions  FOTW Colour Palette. FOTW displays standardized flag images in GIF format, usually at a height of 216 pixels. While the GIF file format is capable of displaying 256 colours, the site's standard calls for a more restricted \\"FOTW palette\\" of 32 colours.  Flag  The organization's flag is a design by Mark Sensen, which was selected over 10 challengers in a poll of FOTW mailing list members and was adopted 8 March 1996. Since then, March 8 has been regarded as FOTW's Flag Day. Sensen described its symbolism: The flag is thus used as a rare representation of the Internet on a flag.

The party includes much of the leadership of the National Labor Federation (NATLFED), and may have no further substance at all. Outside estimates cap membership at between 100 and 300 core members. Those alleged to be members make no public use of the name, and have virtually no identifiable offices or centers of operations.Smith, Matt. Charitable Front, SF Weekly, Dec. 9, 2009 The party, also referred to as the Formation, is clandestine and its exact origins and extent are obscure. There are no party publications, no conventions or leadership elections. During Perente‚Äôs lifetime he exercised full control over the party, communicating directly with members through long orations held at his Carroll Street office in Brooklyn, New York, through audiotapes of those speeches sent out to members running the various NATLFED entities, or through rare printed manuals, such as Perente's 1973 mimeographed The Essential Organizer. Party members do not openly acknowledge its existence. Members of the party are full-time volunteers in NATLFED entities. Membership and history Membership in the party is by invitation, and invitation comes to volunteers in NATLFED entities as a revelation of the existence of the party, an explanation of the party's goals and strategy, and a brief \\"history\\" of the party, called the \\"genesis.\\" This \\"genesis\\" is reportedly a narrative which includes claims that the party was part of a secret International including the Communist Party of Cuba, the Sandinistas and revolutionaries in Chile and El Salvador, and that members of the Weather Underground were among its founders. In 2006 the CPUSA (PW) attained a small victory versus the state of California in Vega v.

In 2009 the party was reported to have been involved, again through some of its front groups, in a civic struggle around the proposed rebuilding of a hospital in a low-income area of San Francisco, USA. Structure The party's secrecy makes accurate appraisals of its internal structure and functioning difficult to achieve. Testimony from former members and contacts has led various observers to characterize the CPUSA (PW) as a \\"political cult\\". For example, party members are said to live communally and to spend all their time working for NATLFED entities. The leadership reportedly maintains extensive file on members, and these accept limitations on contact with family members, while those who attempt to leave the group are said to be subjected to intense pressure and harassment.Kifner, John. \\"Its leader dead, fringe group lives on for its own sake\\".

According to Sawyer, it is the \\"spiritual successor to Transport Tycoon\\". Gameplay The game allows the player to use railroads, trams, trucking lines, buses, airplanes and ships to earn money in a transport company between the years 1900 to 2100. It contains over 40 pre- designed scenarios and a scenario editor, and can also be played in multiplayer mode with another human-controlled competitor. The game is played in an 2D isometric view like the other games by Chris Sawyer, particularly RollerCoaster Tycoon, which uses the engine that was originally developed for Transport Tycoon. The scenarios have five difficulty levels: Beginner, Easy, Medium, Challenging and Expert. Different objectives are available, some require the player to finish on a certain position in the company ranking list while others require the transportation of a specific amount of cargo. In some cases these objectives have additional limits, such as that the player must finish within a certain time limit. While many of the scenarios are fictional, some are based on real-world countries such as the United States, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. In recent years, several add-ons have been created for the game, including hundreds of trains, trucks, airplanes and other vehicles. Some people have used special programs to convert Microsoft Train Simulator rolling stock for use in Locomotion. Downloadable content Early on in the game's development, some Japanese vehicles and buildings were created, only to be omitted from the published game. One of these vehicles was the Shinkansen 0 Series, which later became downloadable from Chris Sawyer's website. These Japanese assets were likely switched out for the Swiss ones. Development Locomotion was developed by game developer Chris Sawyer as \\"spiritual successor to Transport Tycoon\\". The game was published and released by Atari in the U.S. on September 7, 2004 and a few days later in the rest of the world. In 2013 an Android and iOS version of Transport Tycoon was released that uses the graphics from Locomotion. On March 17, 2015, the game was re- released through digital distribution on Steam and gog.com. In January 2018, the open-source project OpenLoco was launched to enhance the gameplay of Locomotion. This includes fixing bugs, translating the game to more languages, and allowing the game to run natively on macOS and Linux. Furthermore, OpenLoco features reduced limitations compared to the original, e.g. disabling vehicle breakdowns, unlocked building options, and using custom resolutions. Reception Reviews of the game were generally not favorable, with many noting that the game's user interface and AI were both poor in comparison to the original Transport Tycoon. Trivia The Class 656 locomotive in the Swiss game mode is actually not a Swiss loco. It instead originates from Italy.

The highway runs east‚Äìwest for approximately through mostly rural farmland in the central part of the state. On its western end, it is part of the Minnesota River Scenic Byway where it runs northwest‚Äìsoutheast along the Minnesota River and associated lakes near the border with the adjoining state of South Dakota. For roughly of its route, it runs concurrently with U.S. Highway 59 (US 59) between Appleton and Montevideo. In Montevideo, the highway turns to the east cutting across the state. It passes through several small towns before entering the Twin Cities metropolitan area. In the metro area, MN 7 follows an expressway through several suburbs before terminating in St. Louis Park. Two different segments have been listed on the National Highway System, system of roads considered important to the country. The highway was first designated along a series of roads between Appleton and Minneapolis around 1933. At first these roads were a mixture of gravel and bitumen surfaces, the latter a forerunner of today's asphalt. Within the first year or so, the western end was extended to terminate MN 7 in the Ortonville area. In 1958, the highway was extended to its modern western terminus at Beardsley by replacing another trunk highway. The section that is now an expressway in the Twin Cities was expanded by the 1950s, and the whole highway was paved in a hard-surface by the end of that decade. The highway was truncated in the Twin Cities to its current eastern terminus in the 1980s. The scenic byways designations were applied at the state and federal levels in 1995 and 2002, respectively. Route description Legally, MN 7 is defined as several different constitutional and legislative routes in state law. The highway follows roadways defined as parts of constitutional routes 12 and 40 in Minnesota Statutes ¬ß 161.114. The remainder of the highway follows all, or part, of legislative routes 119, 147, 148, 304, and 319 in the Minnesota Statutes ¬ß 161.115. The highway is not marked with these routes number along the actual highway. The route of MN 7 between Ortonville and Montevideo along with the segment between I-494 and MN 100 in the Twin Cities have been listed on the National Highway System, a system of roads important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. Like other trunk highways in the state, MN 7 is maintained by the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT). According to the department, up 12,000 vehicles a day used the highway outside of the Twin Cities, and up to 55,000 vehicles traveled the highway daily in the metro area in 2010. =Beardsley to Montevideo= The highway starts at an intersection with MN 28 on the eastern edge of Beardsley and heads south. From here, MN 7 passes through farm fields before turning southeasterly along the shore of Big Stone Lake. The lake is the source of the Minnesota River and forms the Minnesota‚ÄìSouth Dakota state line in Big Stone County. The highway in this area is also a part of the Minnesota River Valley Scenic Byway, a National Scenic Byway and a Minnesota State Scenic Byway. The road turns eastward along a bend in the lake near the community of Foster before running further inland around Big Stone Lake State Park. Past the park, MN 7 curves to the south along the shore and continues to Ortonville. The highway follows 2nd Street through town along the lake shore and through residential neighborhoods. South of the end of the lake, MN 7 merges with US 12, and the two highways run concurrently for about a couple blocks. South of town, MN 7 merges onto US 75 and the combined highway runs along the Minnesota River. The roadway also runs parallel to a line of the BNSF Railway used by the Twin Cities and Western Railroad in the area. East of the Big Stone National Wildlife Refuge and the town of Odessa, US 75 and the scenic byway turn south to cross the river, separating from MN 7 which continues along the northern banks of the river. Near the town of Correll, MN 7 follows the northern shore of Marsh Lake to Appleton. The highway turns due east along Logan Avenue to enter town. MN 7 follows both US 59 and MN 119 in a triple concurrency on along Munsterman Street through town. At the intersection with Minnesota Street near the Swift County Fairgrounds, US 59/MN 7 turns southeasterly separating from MN 119\\\\. The highway then continues southeasterly running inland from Lac qui Parle through farm country to the town of Milan. There it crosses to the south side of the railroad before intersecting MN 40 and exiting town. In Watson, the scenic byway route rejoins MN 7 and follows it south to Montevideo. On the southern edge of the city, MN 7 turns northward, separating from US 59 and joining MN 29. =Montevideo to Hutchinson= Continuing northward in Montevideo, the highway turns back to the east between J. Harley Smith and Lagoon parks. MN 29 separates at the intersection between Washington Avenue and 8th Street, and MN 7 continues eastward on Washington through residential areas. The avenue passes the hospital before leaving town. The street name attached to the highway in rural Chippewa County is 50th Street as MN 7 runs due east through farm country. The highway crosses another line of the BNSF Railway and MN 23 in Clara City before meandering southwesterly to follow 60th Street near Bunde. East of this unincorporated community, the highway crosses into Kandiyohi County. The highway follows 195th Avenue through the southern part of the county, passing through the communities of Prinsburg and Lake Lillian. In between, it passes south of Blomkest where it intersects US 71. Intersection with MN 15 in Hutchinson The next county along the course of MN 7 is Meeker County. Running due east through farmlands in the southern area of that county, the highway intersects MN 4 in Cosmos and passes through Cedar Mills. Just east of Cedar Mills, MN 7 crosses into McLeod County and merges with MN 22\\\\. The combined highway turns southeasterly toward Hutchinson. On the west side of town, the roadway crosses Campbell Lake and follows an arm of the lake through the downtown area. The highway passes several parks before coming to an intersection with MN 15 and exiting the business district for residential neighborhoods. MN 22 separates from MN 7 east of Hutchinson, and the latter highway continues eastward. =Hutchinson to St. Louis Park= In rural eastern McLeod County, MN 7 jogs to the north around Silver Lake in the city of the same name. Northeast of Lester Prairie, the highway crosses into Carver County. This area is also rural farm country as the roadway bypasses New Germany and Mayer to the north. Near the latter community, MN 7 intersects MN 25 which provides a connection to both Mayer and the city of Watertown. North of Waconia, the roadway begins to meander southeasterly through an area dotted with several lakes and crosses into the western edge of the Twin Cities metropolitan area. Approaching the MN 41 intersection in Shorewood After briefly passing through Hennepin County in the communities of St. Bonifacius and Minnetrista, MN 7 crosses back into Carver County. In the city of Victoria the highway rounds the southern end of Lake Minnetonka. As MN 7 begins to turn back northeasterly, it crosses into western Hennepin County at Shorewood. The highway widens out to a four-lane divided highway near the intersection with MN 41\\\\. This divided highway has a partial interchange with Mill Street in Excelsior near the St. Albans Bay of Lake Minnetonka. This area transitions into a full suburban residential area by the time the highway crosses into Minnetonka. The highway passes north of the campus for Minnetonka High School near the intersection with County Road 101 (CR 101). Access to MN 7 through the area is restricted to major intersections only for the most part, making the highway an expressway rather than a true freeway. While still in Minnetonka, MN 7 passes through a cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 494 (I-494) which is one half of the Twin Cities' beltway. Immediately adjacent to the cloverleaf is another interchange for CR 60 (Baker Road). The expressway continues northeasterly through the suburb of Hopkins before crossing into St. Louis Park. The western edge of St. Louis Park is marked by the interchange with US 169\\\\. The area immediately adjacent to MN 7 in this suburb is filled with commercial properties on either side of access roads. East of Texas Ave S, MN 7 becomes a freeway with three interchanges. The first is a dumbbell interchange with Louisiana Ave. East of Louisiana Avenue, the highway is parallel to a line of the Twin Cities and Western Railroad. There is another interchange for Wooddale Avenue before MN 7 meets, and terminates at, the interchange for MN 100 near the Peavey‚ÄìHaglin Experimental Concrete Grain Elevator, the country's first concrete grain elevator. The expressway continues east for approximately another mile (1.6 km) as CR 25. History First authorized in 1933‚Äì34, MN 7 ran between Appleton and the Twin Cities. At the time, the highway was under construction between Ortonville and Appleton. From its junction with MN 119, MN 7 was a gravel road southeasterly to Montevideo before turn east on a bituminous surface to Clara City. From there east to the Waconia area, the highway was gravel, and the remainder was bituminous. No sections at the time were paved in asphalt. The segment from Appleton northwesterly to Odessa was completed by the early part of 1935 connecting the highway to US 75. By 1952, the highway had been expanded to four lanes between Excelsior and the Twin Cities. In 1958, the highway was extended northwesterly along US 75 from Odessa to Ortonville and continuing on to Beardsley. The highway between Beardsley and Ortonville had been MN 103 since the 1930s. The route was completely paved by 1959, the last section to be paved with at least bitumen was along the former MN 103 northwest of Ortonville. MN 7 used to extend into downtown Minneapolis until 1965, where it terminated at its intersection with Washington Avenue (old US 52). From 1965 to either 1987 or 1988, the eastern terminus was located at the intersection of Lake Street and France Avenue in Minneapolis; the part, about long, between the interchange with MN 100 and the intersection of Lake Street and France Avenue is now called County State-Aid Highway 25. In 1995, the section between MN 28 and the southern US 75 junction was named a Minnesota State Scenic Byway; it was also made a National Scenic Byway on June 13, 2002.

He represented from January 1999 until June 2011, winning seven terms as a Democrat and never receiving less than 60% of the vote. Weiner resigned from Congress in June 2011 after an incident in which a sexually suggestive photo that he sent to a woman via Twitter was captured and publicized. On May 19, 2017, Weiner pleaded guilty to another, unrelated sexting charge of transferring obscene material to a minor, and was sentenced to 21 months in prison, ordered to pay a $10,000 fine, and was required to permanently register as a sex offender. Weiner began serving his federal prison sentence in November 2017. He was released from prison in February 2019, and released from halfway house custody in May 2019. A New York City native, Weiner attended public schools and graduated from SUNY Plattsburgh in 1985 with a B.A. in political science. He was a member of the New York City Council from 1992 to 1998 and a congressional aide to U.S. Representative Chuck Schumer from 1985 to 1991. He was an unsuccessful candidate for Mayor of New York City in the 2005 and 2013 New York City mayoral elections.  Early life  Weiner was born in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, the middle son of Jewish parents, Mort Weiner, a lawyer, and his wife, Frances (n√©e Finkelstein), a public high school math teacher. The family lived for a time in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn. Weiner attended elementary school at P.S. 39 The Henry Bristow School. His older brother Seth was 39 years old when he was killed by a hit-and-run driver in 2000. His younger brother, Jason, is a chef and co-owner of several New York restaurants. Weiner took the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test, an examination used to determine admission to all but one of New York City's specialized high schools, and was admitted to Brooklyn Technical High School, from which he graduated in 1981. He attended the State University of New York at Plattsburgh, and spent his junior year as an exchange student at the College of William & Mary, where he was friends with future comic and political commentator Jon Stewart. Stewart acknowledged the friendship when he poked fun at him during the sexting scandal in 2011. Weiner's interests turned towards politics; he became active in student government and was named most effective student senator. After he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1985, Weiner joined the staff of then‚ÄìUnited States Representative and current Senator Charles Schumer. He worked in Schumer's Washington, D.C. office for three years, then transferred to the district office in Brooklyn in 1988, when Schumer encouraged him to become involved in local politics.  New York City Council  After working for Schumer for six years, Weiner got his first chance at political office in 1991 when the New York City Council was expanded from 35 to 51 seats. Weiner was considered a long-shot because he faced strong competition in the Democratic primary elections from two other candidates who had better local name recognition and funding. Weiner narrowly won the primary, besting Adele Cohen by fewer than 200 votes. Controversy ensued in the last weeks of the campaign after Weiner's campaign anonymously spread leaflets around the district that had alleged ties between Cohen and the so-called \\"Jackson-Dinkins agenda\\"; the leaflets referred to the Crown Heights riots earlier in the year, after which white residents had seen Jesse Jackson, who became notorious for his earlier remarks about New York City as \\"Hymietown\\", and then-mayor David Dinkins as having been beholden to the predominantly African-American rioters and therefore endangering whites.Kornacki, Steve. Sack, Kevin. Weiner's win in the November general election was widely considered a formality because he had no opposition in the heavily Democratic district. He was 27 years old when he became the youngest councilman in the city's history. Over the next seven years on the City Council, Weiner initiated programs to address quality of life concerns. He also started a program to put at-risk and troubled teens to work cleaning up graffiti, and he backed development plans that helped revive the historic Sheepshead Bay area.  U.S. House of Representatives  = Elections = In 1998, Weiner ran for Congress from New York's 9th congressional district, which was the seat held by his mentor, Chuck Schumer, who was running for the U.S. Senate. Weiner won the Democratic primary election, which was tantamount to election in the heavily Democratic district that included parts of southern Brooklyn and south and central Queens. = Domestic issues = Gay Pride Parade, 2009. Weiner received a 100% rating from the NARAL Pro-Choice America in 2003 and a 0% rating from National Right to Life Committee 2006, which indicated a strong pro-choice voting record. He was critical of the 2009 Stupak-Pitts Amendment to the Affordable Care Act, which prohibits the use of taxpayer funds for abortions, calling it \\"unnecessary and divisive\\" and saying it would prevent health insurers from offering abortion coverage regardless of whether an individual uses federal funds to purchase an insurance plan. In April 2008, Weiner created the bi- partisan Congressional Middle Class Caucus. He received an \\"A\\" on the Drum Major Institute's 2005 Congressional Scorecard on middle-class issues. In June 2008, Weiner sponsored a bill to increase the number of O-visas available to foreign fashion models, arguing that it would help boost the fashion industry in New York City. He criticized UN diplomats for failing to pay parking tickets in New York City, claiming foreign nations owed $18,000,000 to the city. During the health care reform debates of 2009, Weiner advocated for a bill called the United States National Health Care Act, which would have expanded Medicare to all Americans, regardless of age. He remarked that while 4% of Medicare funds go to overhead, private insurers put 30% of their customer's money into profits and overhead instead of into health care. In late July 2009, he secured a full House floor vote for single payer health care in exchange for not amending America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 in committee mark-up with a single-payer plan. When a public health insurance option was being considered as part of America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009, Weiner said that it would help reduce costs, and he set up a website to push for the option. He attracted widespread attention when described the Republican Party as \\"a wholly owned subsidiary of the insurance industry, teaming up with a small group of Democrats to try to protect that industry\\". In February 2010, he proclaimed in front of Congress that \\"every single Republican I have ever met in my entire life is a wholly owned subsidiary of the insurance industry.\\" Weiner was the chief sponsor of the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act of 2009, which made the selling of tobacco in violation of any state tax law a federal crime, and effectively ended Internet tobacco smuggling by stopping shipments of cigarettes through the United States Postal Service. He claimed, \\"This new law will give states and localities a major revenue boost by cracking down on the illegal sale of tobacco\\", and added that \\"Every day we delay is another day that New York loses significant amounts of tax revenue and kids have easy access to tobacco products sold over the Internet.\\" On July 29, 2010, Weiner criticized Republicans for opposing the 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, which would provide for funds for sick first responders to the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center. In a speech on the floor of the House, he accused Republicans of hiding behind procedural questions as an excuse to vote against the bill. In response to pressure from Weiner, YouTube removed some of Anwar al-Awlaki's inflammatory videos from its website in November 2010. Weiner voted against the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. As a prominent Democratic opponent of the tax cut package passed by Congress, Weiner said Republicans had gotten the better of President Obama in the negotiations to reach an agreement on the $858 billion deal and said the Republicans turned out to be \\"better poker players\\" than Obama. In 2002 Weiner voiced strong criticism of removing the World Trade Center debris without investigating it for determining the causes of the collapses of Tower 1, 2 and 7. From time 6:36 in https://www.c-span.org/video/?168982-1/world-trade- center-collapse = Foreign policy = In 2002, Weiner voted to give President George W. Bush the authority to use military force against Iraq. In May 2006, Weiner attempted to bar the Palestinian delegation from entering the United Nations. He added that the delegation \\"should start packing their little Palestinian terrorist bags\\", and went on to claim that Human Rights Watch, The New York Times, and Amnesty International are all biased against Israel. On July 29, 2007, Weiner and Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) objected to a $20-billion arms deal that the Bush Administration had negotiated with Saudi Arabia because they didn't want to provide \\"sophisticated weapons to a country that they believe has not done enough to stop terrorism\\", noting that 15 of the 19 hijackers of September 11, 2001, were Saudis. Weiner made the announcement outside of the Saudi Arabian consulate in Washington, stating, \\"We need to send a crystal clear message to the Saudi Arabian government that their tacit approval of terrorism can't go unpunished.\\" The two intended to use a provision of the Arms Export Control Act to review the deal and pass a Joint Resolution of Disapproval. Weiner and several other members of Congress later criticized the Obama administration's proposal to sell over $60 billion in arms to Saudi Arabia. He said: \\"Saudi Arabia is not deserving of our aid, and by arming them with advanced American weaponry we are sending the wrong message\\", and described Saudi Arabia as having a \\"history of financing terrorism\\" and teaching \\"hatred of Christians and Jews\\" to its schoolchildren. = Criticisms and controversies = In July 2008, The New York Times characterized Weiner as one of the most intense and demanding of bosses. The newspaper described him as a person who often worked long hours with his staff and required them to be in constant contact via BlackBerry. He frequently yelled at them and occasionally threw office furniture in anger. As a result of Weiner's actions, the Times reported that he had one of the highest staff turnover rates of any member of Congress; this included the departure of three chiefs of staff within an 18-month period. Weiner admitted he pushed his aides hard but said that his speaking at a high decibel level was part of his background and style, not necessarily shouting. Though some former employees were critical of his supervisory practices, others praised him for his intense involvement in constituent concerns and readiness to fight for New York City. A 2010 license plate check by the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call showed that Weiner's vehicles were among several owned by members of Congress that had unpaid tickets. Weiner's past due fines, which spanned three years and totaled more than $2,000, were among the highest uncovered by Roll Call and were paid in full shortly after publication of the article. On June 13, 2011, the New York Daily News reported that one of Weiner's vehicles, though it had been issued valid plates, was displaying expired plates that had been issued to another one of his vehicles. Weiner had previously criticized UN diplomats for failing to pay parking tickets in New York City, claiming foreign nations owed $18,000,000 to the city.  Sexting scandals, prosecution, and guilty plea  On May 27, 2011, Weiner used his public Twitter account to send a link to a woman who was following him on Twitter. The link contained a sexually explicit photograph of himself. After several days of denying that he had posted the image, Weiner held a press conference at which he admitted he had \\"exchanged messages and photos of an explicit nature with about six women over the last three years\\" and apologized for his earlier denials. After an explicit photo was leaked through the Twitter account of a listener of The Opie & Anthony Show, Weiner announced on June 16, 2011, that he would resign from Congress, and he formally did so on June 21. A special election was held on September 13, 2011 to replace him; Republican businessman Bob Turner defeated Democrat David Weprin to fill Weiner's seat. A second sexting scandal began on July 23, 2013, which was several months after Weiner returned to politics in the New York City mayoral race. Weiner sent explicit photos under the alias \\"Carlos Danger\\" to a 22-year-old woman with whom he had contact as late as April 2013, which was more than a year after he had left Congress. The woman was later identified as Sydney Leathers. She was an Indiana native who first came into contact with him when she expressed her disapproval of his extramarital behaviors. On August 28, 2016, the New York Post reported that Weiner had sexted another woman, including sending a picture while he was lying in bed with his young son. The New York Times reported the next day that Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin intended to separate. Abedin announced her intention by stating, \\"After long and painful consideration and work on my marriage, I have made the decision to separate from my husband. Anthony and I remain devoted to doing what is best for our son, who is the light of our life. During this difficult time, I ask for respect for our privacy.\\" In September 2016, claims were published that Weiner had engaged in sexting with a 15-year-old girl from North Carolina, and devices owned by Weiner were seized as part of an investigation into this incident. The report prompted a criminal investigation and Weiner's laptop was seized. Emails that were pertinent to the Hillary Clinton email controversy were discovered on the laptop; this prompted FBI Director James Comey to reopen that investigation 11 days before the 2016 US presidential election. Hillary Clinton has cited Comey's decision as the reason why she lost the election to Donald Trump. On January 31, 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that federal prosecutors were weighing whether or not to bring child pornography charges against Weiner over the incident. On May 19, 2017, The New York Times reported in its online edition that Weiner had surrendered to the FBI that morning. Under a plea agreement, he intended to plead guilty to a single charge of transferring obscene material to a minor. Under the agreement, Weiner faced a sentence of 21 to 27 months in federal prison and would be required to register as a sex offender. At his sentencing hearing on September 25, 2017, presiding judge Denise Cote sentenced Weiner to 21 months in prison, beginning on November 6, 2017. with an additional three years of supervision following his prison term. On November 6, 2017, Weiner reported to Federal Medical Center, Devens in Ayer, Massachusetts to begin his 21-month sentence. After getting about three months deducted from his sentence for good behavior, Weiner was released from prison on February 17, 2019, and sent to a halfway house in Brooklyn, New York. Weiner was released from a Bronx halfway house on May 14, 2019. Weiner will have to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life.  New York mayoral elections  = 2005 = Weiner sought the Democratic nomination to run for New York City mayor in 2005, vying against three other candidates. He had a three-part pitch to voters that included criticizing sitting Mayor Michael Bloomberg for his top-down style of management and promising a more democratic approach; against \\"passivity in City Hall\\" and for getting more federal money for the city; and a series of ideas on how to get the city to work better. He presented a book of 50 \\"Real Solutions\\" and among his policy proposals were fixes for the health care and educational systems. One idea already in play was a neighborhood scrubbing-up program he dubbed \\"Weiner's Cleaners\\". Weiner started out last in many polls, but gained ground in the final weeks of the campaign, coming in second. Initial election returns had Fernando Ferrer with 39.95% of the vote, just shy of the 40% required to avoid a runoff against Weiner, who had 28.82%, but Weiner conceded, citing the need for party unity and denying rumors that various high-ranking New York Democrats, such as Senator Chuck Schumer and New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, had urged him to concede. Absentee ballots put Ferrer over the 40% mark in the official primary election returns. = 2009 = Weiner appeared to be a candidate for mayor again in 2009. However, in May 2009, after the New York City Council voted to extend term limits for Mayor Bloomberg, Weiner announced his decision not to run against the popular incumbent. By July 2010, Weiner had raised $3.9 million for a potential campaign in the 2013 mayoral election, and was considered a leading contender in early polls. According to the New York City Campaign Finance Board website, as of the March 2013 filing deadline Weiner had raised over $5.1 million, the second most among registered mayoral candidates, behind only Christine Quinn. = 2013 = In an interview with The New York Times Magazine published online on April 10, 2013, Weiner said he would like to \\"ask people to give me a second chance\\" and was considering a run for mayor. He added that, \\"it's now or maybe never for me.\\" In an interview on April 11, Rep. Keith Ellison endorsed Weiner, saying that he would love to see him become mayor of New York. Weiner announced his intent to seek candidacy on a YouTube video on May 21, 2013. Weiner's platform for candidacy was summarized in \\"Keys to the City: 64 Ideas to Keep New York City the Capital of the Middle Class\\". After his resignation from Congress, Weiner used the alias \\"Carlos Danger\\" to continue to send explicit photographs. Following the second set of sexting allegations, he acknowledged on July 23, 2013, that he had sent messages to at least three women in 2012. One recipient stated that Weiner described himself to her as ‚Äúan argumentative, perpetually horny middle-aged man‚Äù. Following this admission, there were calls for Weiner to drop out of the mayoral race; however, Weiner held a press conference with his wife, Huma Abedin, in which he announced that he would continue his campaign. At the press conference, Weiner said, \\"I said that other texts and photos were likely to come out and today they have... I want to again say that I am very sorry to anyone who was on the receiving end of these messages and the disruption this has caused.‚Äù On July 27, 2013, Danny Kedem, Weiner's campaign chief, announced his resignation. On September 10, 2013, Weiner lost the mayoral primary, winning only 4.9% of the vote.  Post-congressional consulting and lobbying work  In July 2011 (which was less than a month after he left Congress), Weiner created the consulting firm Woolf-Weiner Associates. He advised over a dozen companies that included electronic medical records providers and biofuel firms. He worked with Covington & Burling, an international law firm. According to 2012 public disclosures, his work helped increase his combined family income to $496,000. Weiner argued that despite contacting members of Congress on behalf of his clients, his work did not meet the legal definition of lobbying. Barbaro, Michael. This was based on the so- called \\"Daschle Loophole\\" in the Lobbying Disclosure Act, which requires only those who spend more than 20% of their time lobbying to register as lobbyists. Some people in the political left and right criticized Weiner for his consulting work. During an interview on MSNBC, Lawrence O'Donnell criticized Weiner stating, \\"You went out to make money as a lobbyist... you did the classic hack thing and you know it.\\" Weiner stated he was not a lobbyist. The Sunlight Foundation also criticized Weiner for stealth lobbying and falling under the aforementioned \\"Daschle Loophole\\". The public never learned of his lobbying work until two years later, when his nondisclosure agreements expired. In July 2015, Weiner was hired by MWW Group, a PR firm in New York City as a part-time consultant to serve on the company's board of advisors. By September 2015, his employment at MWW had ended, with the firm's head Michael Kempner stating \\"It has become clear that a handful of people and a few media outlets continue to be fixated on Anthony\\". According to Politico New York, Weiner reportedly first learned of Kempner's decision through a mass email. On August 29, 2016, the New York Daily News said it would no longer carry Weiner's columns, which included his writings on New York City politics. On the same day, television channel NY1 said Weiner would not be reprising his contributor role on any of its shows.  Personal life  Huma Abedin, October 2010 Weiner is Jewish. He is a lifelong fan of the New York Mets and New York Islanders. In May 2009, he became engaged to Huma Abedin, a long-time personal aide to Hillary Clinton, and they married in July 2010, with former President Bill Clinton officiating. Abedin is a practicing Muslim of Indian and Pakistani descent. In December 2011, Abedin gave birth to a son, Jordan Zain Weiner. In August 2016, Abedin announced that she was separating from Weiner. In early 2017, Abedin announced her intent to file for divorce with sole physical custody of their son. On May 19, 2017, after he pleaded guilty, she filed for divorce. Abedin and Weiner withdrew their divorce case from court in January 2018, saying they decided to settle the divorce privately in order to spare their six-year-old son further embarrassment. In 2020, Weiner was named the CEO of IceStone, a Brooklyn-based company that makes countertops from recycled glass.  In popular culture  In 2013, Weiner and Abedin allowed filmmakers full access to his mayoral campaign. In 2016, the resulting documentary, Weiner, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. Chozik, Amy & Brooks Barnes. Weiner appeared in the Syfy movie Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No! (2015), portraying the Director of NASA. In 2013, a production called The Weiner Monologues premiered at the Access Theater. Directed by Jonathan Harper Schlieman, the show was based on media coverage of Weiner's sexting scandal. In 2014, he had a cameo appearance in an Alpha House episode.

Although there is no railway service to Cossington, the Ivanhoe Line runs along the Midland Main Line between Leicester and Loughborough, passing close to the village. An hourly service is provided in both directions as part of East Midlands Railway Local service from Lincoln to Leicester via Nottingham. Many years ago there was a 'Cossington Gate railway station' which has long since gone, the only evidence remaining on old maps, The nearest stations now being at Syston and Sileby. Cossington was once home to Lady Isobel Barnett, a radio and television personality from the mid 20th century, where she committed suicide amidst shoplifting charges. A short new road, Barnett Close, has been named in her memory. The village is home to three small businesses; two garden centres (Derry's Nursery and Goscote Nursery) and a pub, The Royal Oak In the early 1990s there were plans to expand the village, which were strongly opposed by the residents at the time, who formed the protest group 'Cossington In Distress'. The residents were successful in bringing about the cessation of the work and the village remains a peaceful community to this day. Every alternate Easter the residents of Cossington open their gardens to the public for two days for the 'Secret Gardens of Cossington' in which the village's willing gardeners show off their talents, with all the proceeds of ticket sales going to charity. The event has been a massive success every time it has run. The church of All Saints dates from the 13th century. A ‚ÄòGrant of Arms‚Äô of the Fisher family displayed on the tower wall above the arch. There are memorial tablets to the Fisher family of which Geoffrey Fisher became Archbishop of Canterbury in the 1950s. To the south of the village lies Platts Lane Recreation Ground (more simply known as just 'Platts Lane') which is owned by the Platts Lane Charitable Trust and run by a volunteer committee made up of mostly village residents. Platts Lane is basically a large playing field area and plays host to soccer, cricket and rugby matches - most notably being the home of Sileby Town Rugby Football Club who are also known as 'The Vikings' and play all their home fixtures at Platts Lane, which many locals enjoy watching. Nearby is Ratcliffe College. A notable native of Cossington was John Webster, governor of Connecticut Colony in 1656. John Webster's Great-great-great-grandson Noah Webster Jr Wrote what became the Merriam- Webster Dictionary around 1875 The Australian artist Grace Cossington Smith's mother (also Grace, n√©e Fisher) was the daughter of a rector of Cossington from the Fisher family (see above). To the east of the village there is a footpath named \\"Polly Peggs Footpath\\". Local village legend says a distressed girl drowned herself after falling pregnant whilst courting. Her lover, father and even the church abandoned her and she committed suicide.https://leicesterchronicle.co.uk/polly-peggs References External links Villages in Leicestershire Civil parishes in Leicestershire Borough of Charnwood ","title":"Cossington, Leicestershire"},{"id":"963609","text":"Kongur Tagh or Kongkoerh (Uyghur: , –ö–æ“£—É—Ä –¢–∞“ì, meaning \\"Brown Mountain\\"; , (–•–æ–Ω–≥–æ—Ä/Kongur/Kongur is Mongolian word for the color Mongolians use for Buckskin colored horse) Hongor Tag; ; also referred to as Kongur), is at 7,649 m the highest mountain wholly within the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China.

Kongur Tagh is located just north of Muztagh Ata and visible from Karakul Lake. Some sources use \\"Kongur Shan\\" mistakenly to refer to the peak itself. The Kongur Shan range, including Muztagh Ata, is separated by the major Yarkand River valley from the Kunlun Mountains and thus is sometimes included in the \\"Eastern Pamirs\\" Kongur Tagh is the highest peak in the Kunlun Range , and is higher than any peak in the Pamirs as well. Due to its remoteness and being hidden by nearby peaks, Kongur was not discovered by Europeans until 1900. However, the building of the Karakoram Highway from Pakistan to China, which runs past nearby Tashkurgan and Karakul Lake, has now made it more accessible. Administratively, the Kongur Range is within Akto County. Climbing history The first attempt to climb Kongur Tagh was made in 1956 but the party aborted the attempt when it realized it was beyond their abilities. The first ascent of Kongur Tagh was completed in 1981 by a British expedition consisting of Chris Bonington, Al Rouse, Peter Boardman and Joe Tasker.Ward (1983), pp. 146-148.

Dawn Geske, International Business Times, 03/06/2019 Jeans maker Diesel USA files for bankruptcy Reuters, Jonathan Stempel and Dan Grebler, 03/06/2019 Its parent company, Diesel SpA, is not part of the bankruptcy filing. History Diesel founder Renzo Rosso began stitching jeans on a sewing machine at the age of fifteen. He used his mother‚Äôs sewing machine to produce low-riding, bell bottomed jeans, which he would wear himself and sell to his friends for 3500 lira a piece. He later attended an industrial textile manufacturing high school in Padua. In 1976 Rosso began working for a clothing manufacturer called Moltex, which was owned by Adriano Goldschmied. After working with the company for two years, he used a loan from his father to buy a 40% holding in the company, which changed its name to Diesel, and marketed jeans under the Diesel brand and many others. Rosso bought out Goldschmied's interest in the Diesel brand name in 1985 for US$500,000, becoming the sole owner of the company. Rosso has said that he learned marketing from the US, creativity from Italy, and systems from Germany.T Surendar, Saumya Roy (June 30, 2010). Diesel Founder Renzo Rosso Knows What Matters In Fashion. Forbes India. Accessed March 2014. In 1990 Russ Togs, Inc. received the license to market and distribute Diesel lines in the United States and Mexico. Mitsubishi Co. received the license to market and distribute in Japan. By 1991, Russ Togs was going out of business, and sold Diesel Sportswear to Rosso upon ending the licensing deal. As a result of Russ Togs collapse, the creation of made in the USA Diesel products never came to fruition, and Diesel instead placed its made-in-Italy jeans and clothing in US stores. In 1992, Diesel became the title sponsor for the World Superbike racing circuit. In 1995, Diesel launched one of the first significant fashion retail websites, which housed images of each of its collections. The first Diesel jeans to be sold online were available in Finland and Sweden starting in 1997. It then opened a virtual store that allowed home delivery for further markets the following year.Franzen and Moriarty, Pg. 5 Diesel store in Krak√≥w, Poland In 1999, Diesel opened large flagship stores in New York City, San Francisco, Rome, and London, and began to open other mono-brand stores for Diesel in order to augment its points of sale in department and other multi- brand retails stores. Further flagship stores (also known as ‚ÄúStyleLabs‚Äù) opened, including stores in Berlin, Barcelona, and Paris. Diesel also produces illustrated catalogs for its retail lines. The company also won the Premio Risultati award for Best Italian Company of the Year from the Bocconi Institute in 1996. In 1998 The Wall Street Journal called Diesel ‚Äúthe label of the moment‚Äù. Diesel founder Rosso began purchasing additional fashion companies in 2002, under the parent company Only The Brave, which Diesel was brought under as well. Companies purchased by Only the Brave included Maison Martin Margiela, Viktor & Rolf, Marni, and licensing company Staff International. In 2005 Diesel released the book ‚ÄúFifty‚Äù upon Rosso‚Äôs fiftieth birthday, an illustrated history of the company, with a print-run of ten thousand. Diesel's denim's products are produced exclusively in Italy, with many of its products produced by out-sourced factories. Its headquarters are in Breganze, on the former Moto Laverda factory area, and had twelve international subsidiaries as of 2005.Franzen and Moriarty, Pg. 4 As of 2008, the company had five thousand points of sale across eighty countries, with 270 mono-brand Diesel stores. Diesel itself owns 170 of those, with the rest owned by franchisees. Turnover was over ‚Ç¨1.3 billion in 2009, and by 2010 the company had over 400 stores. In 2012 Diesel founder Rosso was listed on the Forbes list of billionaires for the first time. In 2015 the company held the exhibition Welcome to Diesel World in Shanghai, which provided an overview of the company‚Äôs history, in conjunction with its collection debut. Another exhibition was held in Tel Aviv to mark the company‚Äôs twentieth year in Israel. Fashion lines Diesel Black Gold store in Vienna, Austria While the most popular Diesel apparel item has been denim wear, the company has expanded to include additional forms of clothing. The company has created leather jackets, women‚Äôs dresses, and other items. In 1998, Diesel founded an offshoot label called Diesel StyleLab, which produced higher end fashion designs beyond more traditional denim jeans. In the 2000s, the company began to license its brand to other retail manufacturers, in order to create new product categories. These lines included the sunglasses line Diesel Eyewear in partnership with Marcolin, the jewels and watches line Diesel Watches in partnership with Fossil, the fragrance line in partnership with L'Or√©al. The production of each line involves supervision from Diesel itself. Diesel has also partnered with Moroso, Seletti, Scavolini, Foscarini, and Berti to create a home furnishings line called Diesel Living, with Bugaboo to create strollers, with AVG to create helmets, with Ducati, and with Fiat to create a limited edition Fiat 500. Diesel also produces limited edition lines of jeans. As of 2003, according to Women‚Äôs Wear Daily, Diesel had three distinct fashion lines, ‚ÄúDiesel Style Lab, the most pricey fashion-forward designer label; Diesel, a fashion brand that still focuses heavily on denim, and 55DSL, the board sport-inspired streetwear line that blends fashion and function.‚Äù Style Lab and 55DSL are now defunct. Currently there are two lines at Diesel: Diesel and Diesel Black Gold. Diesel Black Gold is the luxury ready-to-wear line and was launched in 2008 during the New York Fashion Week. That year the company also partnered with Adidas to co-produce a sport denim line. In 2013 Diesel underwent a re-branding effort, reorganizing both the business structure and marketing methodologies. Advertising \\"Dieselwall\\" in Berlin Starting in 1991, Diesel has been known for producing ads that invoke surreal images in lieu of direct product details, in partnership with Swedish ad agency Paradiset DDB, Stockholm. These included 1997 ads portraying life in Communist North Korea (shot in Hong Kong). Another ad campaign imitated automobile crashes.Bruzzi and Gibson, Pg. 143 Campaigns have also used social consciousness as a theme, ironic plays on global issues (such as their Global Warming Ready campaign featuring post-global warming backdrops in global locations), as well as anti-establishment messages. Michael Chevalier has critiqued the retail stores, stating that he believes that the stores's merchandise is presented in a confusing way in order to get customers to interact with the sales staff. During the late 1990s, Diesel produced CD-ROMs and other computer content, including the computer game ‚ÄúDigital Adrenalin‚Äî55DSL‚Äù. In 2007 Diesel sponsored a music contest, Diesel-U-Music. From January to September 2008, Diesel spent $5.8 million on U.S. advertising, according to TNS Media Intelligence. The Grand Prix award at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival was won by Diesel in 1997, in 2001 for a campaign featuring the fictitious newspaper ‚ÄúThe Daily African‚Äù, and for the ad campaign ‚ÄúBe Stupid‚Äù in 2010.

Quite naturally, whereas ordinary compilers make so called clean build, that is, (re)build all program modules, incremental compiler recompiles only those portions of a program that have been modified. Definition =Imperative programming= In imperative programming and software development, an incremental compiler is one that when invoked, takes only the changes of a known set of source files and updates any corresponding output files (in the compiler's target language, often bytecode) that may already exist from previous compilations. By effectively building upon previously compiled output files, the incremental compiler avoids the wasteful recompiling of entire source files, where most of the code remains unchanged. For most incremental compilers, compiling a program with small changes to its source code is usually near instantaneous. It can be said that an incremental compiler reduces the granularity of a language's traditional compiling units while maintaining the language's semantics, such that the compiler can append and replace smaller parts. Many programming tools take advantage of incremental compilers to provide developers with a much more interactive programming environment. It is not unusual that an incremental compiler is invoked for every change of a source file, such that the developer is almost immediately informed about any compilation errors that would arise as a result of his changes to the code. This scheme, in contrast with traditional compilation, shortens a programmer's development cycle significantly, because they would no longer have to wait for a long compile process before being informed of errors. One downside to this type of incremental compiler is that it cannot easily optimize the code that it compiles, due to locality and the limited scope of what is changed. This is usually not a problem, because for optimization is usually only carried out on release, an incremental compiler would be used throughout development, and a standard batch compiler would be used on release. =Interactive programming= In the interactive programming paradigm, e.g. in Poplog related literature, , teaching primer to Poplog and The Smith, Sloman and Gibson 1992 paper below (now available online) an interactive compiler refers to a compiler that is actually a part of the runtime system of the source language. The compiler can be invoked at runtime on some source code or data structure managed by the program, which then produces a new compiled program fragment containing machine code that is then immediately available for use by the runtime system. If the newly compiled fragment replaces a previous compiled procedure the old one will be garbage collected. This scheme allows for a degree of self-modifying code and requires metaprogramming language features. The ability to add, remove and delete code while running is known as hot swapping. Some interactive programming platforms mix the use of interpreted and compiled code to achieve the illusion that any changes to code are accessible by the program immediately.

He is best known for his \\"guitar orchestra\\" compositions. He has lived in France since 1987.  Early years  Chatham began his musical career as a piano tuner for avant-garde pioneer La Monte Young as well as harpsichord tuner for Gustav Leonhardt, Rosalyn Tureck and Glenn Gould. He studied flute under Sue Ann Kahn, with whom he first encountered contemporary music, and studied soon afterwards under electronic music pioneer Morton Subotnick and minimalist icon La Monte Young and was a member of Young's group, The Theater of Eternal Music, during the early seventies; Chatham also played with Tony Conrad in an early version of Conrad's group, The Dream Syndicate. In 1971, while still in his teens, Chatham became the first music director at the experimental art space The Kitchen in lower Manhattan. His early works, such as Two Gongs (1971) owed a significant debt to Young and other minimalists.Steve Smith, \\"Where Classic Avant-Garde Gets a Hint of Heavy Metal\\", New York Times, September 13, 2006 His concert productions included experimenters Maryanne Amacher, Robert Ashley, Philip Glass, Meredith Monk, Pauline Oliveros, Steve Reich, and early alternative rockers such as Fred Frith, Robert Fripp, Arto Lindsay, and John Lurie. He has worked closely with visual artist/musician Robert Longo, particularly in the 1980s, and on an experimental opera called XS: The Opera Opus (1984-6) with the visual artist Joseph Nechvatal.  Compositions from the late 1970s and early 1980s  By 1977, Chatham's music was heavily influenced by punk rock, having seen an early Ramones concert. He was particularly intrigued and influenced by the group of artists music critics would label No Wave in 1978. That year, he began performing Guitar Trio around downtown Manhattan with an ensemble that included Glenn Branca, as well as Nina Canal of Ut. During this period, he wrote several works for large guitar ensembles, including Drastic Classicism, a collaboration with dancer Karole Armitage. Drastic Classicism was first released in 1982 on the compilation New Music from Antarctica, put together by Kit Fitzgerald, John Sanborn and Peter Laurence Gordon. It was also included on the 1987 album that also included his 1982 composition Die Donnerg√∂tter (German for \\"The Thundergods\\"). Members of the New York City noise rock band Band of Susans began their careers in Chatham's ensembles; they later performed a cover of Chatham's \\"Guitar Trio\\" on their 1991 album, The Word And The Flesh. (This parallels the way that members of fellow NYC noise rockers Sonic Youth began their careers in Branca's ensembles; Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth did play with Chatham as well.)Minimal Music, Maximal Impact by Kyle Gann Chatham began playing trumpet in 1983, studying under Carmine Curuso and Andrew Crocker, and his more recent works explore an early minimalist vocabulary employing loop/delay trumpet techniques; these are performed by Chatham himself. Examples of this work can be heard on the album Outdoor Spell, released by Northern Spy Records (NS 004) in 2011, and a recent duo album with Charlemagne Palestine, entitled Youuu + Mee = Weee, released on the Belgium SubRosa Label (SR637) in 2014.  Recent activity  Rhys Chatham in Aarhus Denmark 2013 In 2002, he enjoyed a resurgence following the release of a limited-edition 3 CD retrospective box set on the record label Table of the Elements, An Angel Moves Too Fast To See: Selected Works 1971-1989, complete with 130-page booklet. The An Angel Moves Too Fast To See part of the title comes from Chatham's 1989 composition for 100 guitars. He has been since touring with his 100-guitar orchestra in Europe. In 2005, he was commissioned by the city of Paris, in his adopted homeland, to write a composition for 400 electric guitars entitled A Crimson Grail, as part of the Nuit Blanche Festival. Approximately 10,000 people were present at the performance, and 100,000 more watched it on live television. A CD of excerpts from this concert was released in January 2007 by Table Of The Elements. Rhys Chatham is currently touring the original 30 minute version of Guitar Trio in the USA and Europe, renamed G3 because the instrumentation has been increased to between six and ten electric guitars, electric bass and drums. In February 2007 he completed a twelve-city tour called the Guitar Trio (G3) Is My Life North America Tour, which was accompanied by the original film by Robert Longo that was projected behind the performance, entitled Pictures for Music (1979). The sets consisted of local musicians from each city of the performances, including members of Sonic Youth, Tortoise, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, H√ºsker D√º, Brokeback, 90 Day Men, Town & Country, Die Kreuzen, Bird Show and others. A three-CD box set of these performances was released by Table of the Elements in March 2008. Chatham has continued to tour the original version of Guitar Trio in Europe throughout 2007 and 2008, including performances at: * Festival Desgressions - 7 March 2007, Barcelona, Spain * L'Ecole R√©gionale de Beaux Arts - 25, 26 April 2007, Valence, France * Kosmische Club - 10 August 2007, Oslo, Norway * ZXZW Independent Culture Festival - 22, 23 September 2007, Tilburg, the Netherlands * Festival Soy - 29 October 2007, Nantes, France * Galleria Toledo - 26 March 2008, Naples, Italy * State-X Festival - 12 December 2008, The Hague, the Netherlands Rhys Chatham made his first American presentation of a composition for a one-hundred guitar orchestra in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, on May 23, 2008, with an orchestra composed of local students and teachers, as well as many professional guitarists. This performance was the premiere of a new composition entitled Les 100 Guitares: G100. The American premiere of A Crimson Grail was on August 8, 2009. Two-hundred electric guitarists performed the piece at the Damrosch Park Bandshell in New York City. The performance was part of a free concert series, Lincoln Center Out of Doors, that was being commissioned by the Lincoln Center. Originally, the piece was supposed to be performed for 2008's Lincoln Center Out of Doors, but rain canceled the concert for safety reasons. For the 2009 premiere, precautions were taken so that the concert could go on even if it rained. Concurrent with his work for guitar orchestras and smaller ensembles, Chatham's trumpet style has evolved from its characteristic distorted sound of the 90s to its present more dreamy and laid back approach to playing the instrument, influenced by players such as Don Cherry and Jon Hassell. Examples of this style can be heard on Chatham's releases, The Bern Project, released by Hinterzimmer Records in January 2010, and Outdoor Spell, released in March 2011 by Northern Spy Records.

He played as a pitcher for eight teams in three major leagues (the American, Federal, and National), most notably as a member of the Philadelphia Athletics dynasty that won three consecutive American League pennants from 1929 to 1931 and, won the World Series in 1929 and 1930. Quinn made his final major league appearance at the age of 50.Kashatus (2002), p. 103. Biography Born in Stefur√≥, Hungary (modern-day ≈†tefurov, Slovakia), Quinn emigrated to America as an infant with his parents Michael Pajkos and Maria Dzjiacsko, arriving in New York on June 18, 1884. His mother died near Hazleton, Pennsylvania, shortly after the family's arrival in the US, and Quinn's father moved the family to Buck Mountain, near Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania. In 1887 Quinn's father remarried, to Anastasia (\\"Noska\\") Tzar. Quinn spent his early years working as a swimmer and blacksmith, while playing recreational ball for mining teams. He got his start as a professional in an unusual way. While watching a semi-pro game in Connellsville, the 14-year-old Quinn threw a foul ball back from the stands to the catcher, hitting his mitt right in the middle. The visiting manager, from the nearby town of Dunbar, was impressed by the throw, and he offered Quinn a contract. Quinn went on to spend 23 seasons in the major leagues with eight different teams. He won 247 games and lost 218 games, also collecting 57 saves. Quinn debuted on April 15, 1909 and he played until he was 50 years old; his final game was on July 7, 1933. Quinn's professional longevity enabled him to achieve several age-related milestones. He was the oldest Major League player to win a game until Jamie Moyer broke the record on April 17, 2012. Quinn is also the oldest to lead his league in a major category (saves, in 1932‚Äîalthough saves were unknown in that era, and were only retroactively awarded in 1969). He is furthermore the oldest pitcher to start games in the World Series (with the Philadelphia Athletics, in 1929) and on Opening Day (with the Brooklyn Dodgers, in 1931).Kashatus (2002), p. 105. He was the oldest to hit a home run in the majors, at age 46, until 47-year-old Julio Franco did so in 2006. He was the oldest person to ever play for the Cincinnati Reds, and at the time of his retirement, the eight teams for which he had played also constituted a record, which has since been broken. He was also the last major leaguer who had played in the 1900s decade to formally retire (not counting Charley O'Leary, who in 1934 made a comeback stint). Quinn is one of only 29 players in baseball history to date who have appeared in a Major League game in four decades. Finally, he remains the oldest player to play regularly, having pitched 87 innings in 1932 at age 48 and 49, and 15 innings in 1933 at age 49 and 50. (Franco and Phil Niekro were also regular players at age 48, but were one and five months younger respectively during their seasons at that age.) During his career, Quinn played alongside 31 different members of the Baseball Hall of Fame and collected two World Series rings in three tries. He was also one of the last pitchers in baseball permitted to throw the spitball, grandfathered in along with sixteen others reliant on the pitch when it was banned in 1920. He frequently used his spitball after he was grandfathered in, in addition to his fastball, curve, and changeup. Quinn was a good hitting pitcher, posting a .184 batting average (248-for-1349) with 90 runs, 38 doubles, 8 home runs, 115 RBI and drawing 89 bases on balls. He recorded a .969 fielding percentage including playing several games in the outfield. In 2006, Jack Quinn was inducted posthumously into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame. Quinn died in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, at the age of 62. References * Kashatus, William C. (2002).

Walsh was further active in the peace process in Northern Ireland, for which the Walsh Visa was created and named in his honor. As co-founder and co-chair of the Congressional Hearing Health Caucus, Walsh secured passage of laws aimed at guaranteeing universal hearing screenings for newborns and infants in the United States. In 2009, an act that he proposed and which was enacted that achieved this effort was renamed for him in his honor, becoming known as the James T. Walsh Universal Newborn Hearing Screening Program. Walsh's change of perspective regarding both of then-President George W. Bush's troop surge of 2007 and ideology regarding the Iraq War, caused Walsh's views to gain headlines in the news media, as well as for additionally desiring a gradual withdrawal of American troops from Iraq. For one decade during the 1970s and 1980s, Walsh was active on the Syracuse City Council, serving as its leader for five years. In 1999, he issued a challenge with several goals that is known as The Syracuse Neighborhood Initiative (SNI) for revitalization of the city.

Pooler. Walsh was re-elected nine times, usually by fairly comfortable margins. The district, which was renumbered as the 25th District after the 1990 census, became increasingly Democratic in the 1990s due to the national Republican Party becoming more conservative. In 1996, he faced a reasonably well-financed challenge from Cortland attorney Marty Mack, and was held to only 53 percent of the vote. He faced his closest-ever race in 2006 against former congressional aide Dan Maffei, winning by only a 51% to 49% margin. He lost in the metropolitan Syracuse area and was carried to victory by a strong showing in the more rural areas of the district.

Maffei won the seat in November. =Political views= Walsh is generally thought of as a conservative Republican in his views and perspectives on political issues.

History Settlements in this area were made about 50 BC by Belgic invaders. They moved up the rivers Thames and Lea from what is now Belgium. Evidence for them was found in Devil's Dyke, at the eastern side of Wheathampstead. The Devil's Dyke earthworks are part of the remains of an ancient settlement of the Catuvellauni and thought to have been the tribe's original capital. The capital was moved to Verlamion (which after the Roman conquest the Romans would rename Verulamium, which in turn would become modern St Albans) in about 20 BC. The Devil's Dyke is reputedly where Julius Caesar defeated Cassivellaunus in 54 BC, although this claim is disputed. Some historians suggest that the dyke was part of the same defensive rampart as nearby Beech Bottom Dyke, which, if correct, would make the area one of the largest and most important British Iron Age settlements. Later, the village is recorded in the Domesday Book under name Watamestede. It appears that a church existed at Wheathampstead before the Norman Conquest, as Wheathampstead was given by Edward the Confessor to Westminster Abbey, but it is very difficult to determine whether any portion of the present St Helen's Church is of Saxon work. The original structure was demolished in the reign of Henry III, the oldest portion of the present church, in the chancel, is assigned to the year 1280. Some historians have claimed (Trokelowe, Annales (Rolls Ser.), 78.) that in 1312 the barons who leagued against Edward II and his favourite Piers Gaveston, gathered their troops at Wheathampstead, and whilst there refused to receive emissaries from the Pope, although there seems to be no other documentary evidence of this. Up until 1859, Wheathampstead and Harpenden were part of a single rectory. Prior to that date, several of the rectors of Wheathampstead-cum-Harpenden after 1238 went on to have unusually successful ecclesiastical careers. Richard Sampson, who held the position in the 16th century, was in 1523 appointed Lord President of Wales, and in 1543 consecrated Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield. Richard Pate, another rector, was in 1554 consecrated Bishop of Worcester. Lambert Osbaldeston was also master of Westminster School, and became more famous later for a controversy with Archbishop Laud; having used libellous language he was, in 1639, deprived of his living and fined ¬£5,000. Henry Killigrew, in 1661, was made Master of the Savoy. John Lambe, whose father mainly devoted his life to the alleviation of the sufferings of prisoners, was also a rector, and was made Chaplain in Ordinary to William III and Mary II. John Wheeldon (1773‚Äì1800) was the author of several works, and Queen Victoria's private tutor was also a former rector.

It has been described as \\"the modern gateway to Cumbria, the North East and Scotland\\", and is a primary destination signed from as far away as the M6 motorway, 50 miles away. The junction's name is derived from the fact that it is the point of divergence for traffic coming from London, the East Midlands and Yorkshire wishing to continue either to Edinburgh and eastern Scotland (along the A1(M)) or to Glasgow and western Scotland (by taking the A66). Geography The A1(M) leads north towards North East England and Scotland, and south towards London. The A66 leads north west towards Penrith and the M6 motorway. There are also three other exits from the junction: the A6055 road north and south, with the southbound side leading to the A6108 towards the Yorkshire Dales and Richmond. The third exit is towards Middleton Tyas and Croft-on-Tees and is a minor road which also provides access to the services. Etymology and history The Scotch Corner Hotel The name originated from being the junction where the north‚Äìsouth Roman road known as \\"Dere Street\\", which crossed the River Tees at Piercebridge, met the Roman road which went west through Bowes and Brough. It is where travellers to eastern Scotland (now via A1(M) and/or A68) are separated from travellers to western Scotland (now via A66 and M6/ A74(M)/M74). The Romans were responsible for building the first roads to meet at this point and the site of the original junction is just a few hundred yards away from the modern day intersection. In AD 71 the Romans took control of the North when they defeated the Brigantes, a Northern Celtic tribe at the Battle of Scotch Corner. There was a major Roman settlement at Scotch Corner, with its own mint. The route now called the A66 was once 'the winter road' from Scotch Corner to Glasgow, by way of Carlisle. 'The summer road' runs from Barnard Castle, along Teesdale to Alston, then through Brampton to Gretna in Scotland. Particularly for cattle droving, the shorter route was advantageous when passable. The Summer Road is one of the most spectacular routes in England. The summer road follows what is now the B6278, B6277, and A689. The location remained significant as a staging post with an inn, The Three Tuns, which subsequently became a roadhouse in the early days of motorised travel. The ¬£8 million Scotch Corner diversion opened in July 1971, which created a grade separated junction on the A1.Corner interchange Commercial Motor 9 July 1971 page 26 A ¬£380 million upgrade of the A1 between Leeming Bar and Barton Interchange meant that the road was upgraded to three-lane motorway standard in March 2018. Facilities The front entrance of Moto Hospitality, Scotch Corner Scotch Corner is the site of the Scotch Corner Hotel established in 1939, built on the site of a mid-16th century inn and now operated by Holiday Inn. Almost as soon as it was opened, part of the hotel was requisitioned by the Royal Air Force for convalescing airmen. In 2011 it underwent a ¬£3 million refurbishment. It is also marked by a Moto Hospitality service station built in 1980 with an attached Travelodge motel. The Moto offers a Costa Coffee, Marks & Spencer, Burger King, WHSmith, KFC, an Esso petrol station, and an electric vehicle charging station.

It is derived from the Latin term campus, meaning \\"a flat expanse of land, plain, field\\".Oxford Latin Dictionary, ed. P. G. W. Glare, Oxford University Press, Oxford (1982), p. 263 The founding of these new institutions initiated a wave of far reaching expansion in higher education within the UK and helped open access to Higher Education to students who found access to the more traditional universities difficult or closed. The traditional universities tended to attract students from the exclusive private education sector in the UK and from privileged backgrounds whereas campus universities attracted students from all classes, backgrounds and schools (especially the state funded grammar and then later comprehensive schools). These institutions also promoted \\"new\\" courses of study and so helped initiate not just a great expansion in numbers of students but also in the range of subjects studied. As such, many students in the campus universities, particularly in the post-war period of 1950 to 1970, were the first member of their family ever to go to university, and were studying new and \\"exciting\\" topics, which lent a radical edge to the experience of higher education. Campus universities are contrasted to collegiate universities, based on a number of colleges (such as the universities of Oxford, Durham, London or Cambridge) or a university consisting of a number of sites, or even individual buildings, spread throughout a town (such as the University of Edinburgh or the University of Sheffield). Confusingly, multi-site universities often call each separate site \\"a campus\\" and many original campus universities now have expanded to more than one site (or campus), for example the University of Nottingham. The classic campus university is often found on the edge of cities, examples include: *Aston University in Birmingham is a classic campus university, but located in the city centre of the city. *University of Bath which is just outside the city of Bath *University of Birmingham which is located in Edgbaston, 3 miles south-west of Birmingham *Brunel University London which is in Uxbridge, on the edge of West London *University of East Anglia which is 3 miles from the city of Norwich *University of Essex near Colchester *University of Exeter which has four campuses located in Devon and Cornwall *Keele University near Newcastle-under-Lyme *University of Kent which is just on the edge of the city of Canterbury *Lancaster University near the city of Lancaster *University of Nottingham which is located on the outer- suburbs of Nottingham *University of Reading which has three campuses around Reading *Robert Gordon University on the outskirts of Aberdeen *University of Roehampton which is located in south-west London *Queen Mary University of London which is located in Mile End, London *Royal Holloway, University of London on the outskirts of London *University of Stirling on the outskirts of Stirling *University of Sussex which is 4 miles from the city of Brighton *Swansea University which has two campuses, both 2 to 3 miles from Swansea *University of Warwick near Coventry *University of York on the outskirts of York See also * Robbins Report * British universities * Post-1992 universities * Russell Group * 1994 Group * Prix Versailles References Higher education in the United Kingdom Types of university or college ","title":"Campus university"},{"id":"963677","text":"The Pillars of Creation is the seventh book in Terry Goodkind's epic fantasy series The Sword of Truth. It is the first book in the series not to feature Richard Rahl as the protagonist, although he does appear.  Plot introduction  This book revolves around several new characters in the Sword of Truth series. Jennsen, for most of her life, has been running from the assassins sent by Lord Rahl to kill her. Any ungifted child of the Lord Rahl must die. A stranger convinces her that running will do her no good for wherever she goes, Lord Rahl's soldiers will find her; it is time for her to stop fleeing and fight back. If she wants to live, she must kill Lord Rahl.  Plot summary  Jennsen Rahl, Richard Rahl's half sister, has spent the first twenty years of her life running from her father, Darken Rahl. Born without any aspect of the gift of magic, Jennsen has been marked for death since birth. When her mother is apparently murdered by D'Haran assassins, she sets out with her new friend, Sebastian, to start her life over. Sebastian eventually reveals that he is a spy for the Imperial Order. He speaks convincingly of the Order's goals concerning the fair treatment of all humanity and the elimination of magic. Above all else, he esteems Emperor Jagang. In equal measure, he despises Richard Rahl, who he claims has brought on war with an invasion of the Old World after bringing down the Barriers separating the sections of the known world. Meanwhile, another sibling of Richard's, Oba Rahl, suffers under an abusive mother on the family farm. Oba imagines himself as energetic and the possessor of a healthy curiosity. His inquisitive nature manifests itself especially through pleasure in watching things die under his hand. Oba does not know that he, along with Jennsen, is pristinely ungifted and immune to magic. His mother sends him to a nearby sorceress to buy medicine, and, during the purchase, he begins to menace the magic user. Her attempts to defend herself with magic fail and Oba kills her brutally. During the fight, Oba surrenders to a voice in his mind that promises invincibility in return for obedience. After returning home, Oba kills his mother and resolves to see the world. He can travel comfortably with the funds he looted from the sorceress. Jennsen wants to find another sorceress, the sister of the one Oba killed, and who had previously helped Jennsen and her mother. Along with Sebastian, she travels to the People's Palace, capital of the D'Haran empire. There she learns that the sorceress she seeks lives in a deadly enchanted swamp. After Sebastian is detained by D'Haran guards, a friendly stranger named Tom helps a desperate Jennsen to the swamp. She safely reaches the sorceress' home, her natural immunity to magic protecting her through the swamp, but only learns that nothing can be done to save her from Lord Rahl. She leaves, disappointed. However, upon returning to the People's Palace, she cleverly rescues Sebastian. He convinces her that she should visit Emperor Jagang, leader of the Imperial Order. Oba is also aware of the second sorceress and the fact that she knows something concerning his fate or nature. He hires a guide to the swamp, which he safely negotiates as well. The sorceress reveals that Oba is now a thrall to the Keeper of the Underworld and kills herself before Oba can do the deed. This, along with the fact that his guide has stolen all his money, enrages Oba. He is mollified somewhat by the treasure he finds in the sorceresses' cottage, but his rage returns when, after returning to the People's Palace, he spots his guide. After killing the guide, he is briefly jailed but escapes, using the voice in his mind to make the D'Haran guards do his bidding, and resolves to locate Richard Rahl. Jennsen and Sebastian reach Emperor Jagang at the van of the army of the Imperial Order. Though initially shocked by the crude Order soldiers, she is advised not to be so picky and that the D'Harans are even worse. The day after her arrival, the Emperor Jagang assaults the Confessor's Palace but is bloodily repulsed. Emperor Jagang is severely injured in the action. Even worse for the Order, their enemy unleashes an ancient magic on the main army, wreaking immense destruction. Jennsen reacts by making a pact with a dark force, the Keeper, to kill Richard in return for her surrender and obedience. Oba captures Kahlan and is ordered by the Keeper to take her, along with the Sword of Truth, to the Pillars of Creation. Using his link to the sword, Richard pursues Oba to the Pillars, where he encounters Jennsen, who has also been drawn to the same spot by the Keeper in order to kill Richard. The Keeper's supreme plan, however, was for Richard to kill Jennsen at the Pillars of Creation and thereby open a gate between the Keeper's realm and the world of the living. Richard discerns the plan and refuses to be goaded into cooperating. Jennsen recognizes his integrity and the Keeper's plan is foiled. She learns that the men who were sent to kill her mother were actually soldiers of the Imperial Order, and after coming to believe that Richard is truly a loving and caring brother, she joins him and Kahlan in their quest against Jagang.  Characters   Wizard's Seventh Rule  The Wizard's Seventh Rule, revealed in The Pillars of Creation, is: It is explained in the novel as follows: \\"The past can teach us, through experience, how to accomplish things in the future, comfort us with cherished memories, and provide the foundation of what has already been accomplished. But only the future holds life. To live in the past is to embrace what is dead. To live life to its fullest, each day must be created anew. As rational, thinking beings we must use our intellect, not a blind devotion to what has come before, to make rational choices.\\"  Literary significance and reception  Publishers Weekly had this to say in their review of The Pillars of Creation: \\"Amid the interminable sword-and-sorcery in the tradition of Robert E. Howard, the author spouts his familiar political pieties. Lip service may be paid to public good, but passion arises only in scenes of violence. For all its clumsy exposition, unlikely coincidences and feeble attempts at humor, this latest installment, with its striking jacket art showing a beautiful desert landscape, is as certain to please Goodkind's legions of fans as previous books in the series.\\"  Notes   External links  * Official Terry Goodkind website * Unofficial Terry Goodkind website (endorsed by Terry Goodkind) 2001 American novels 2001 fantasy novels American fantasy novels The Sword of Truth books Tor Books books ","title":"The Pillars of Creation"},{"id":"963679","text":"Messier 52 or M52, also known as NGC 7654, is an open cluster of stars in the northern constellation of Cassiopeia.

The lake has a surface area of 13,400 acres (54.2 km2) (20.9 mi2) (5420 ha) and features of shore line. History The man- made lake was first formed when the Catawba Power Company built the Catawba Dam and Power Plant near India Hook, South Carolina in 1904. This dam impounded the Catawba River and created Lake Catawba, which was utilized to create hydro-electric power. In 1905 the Catawba Power Company became part of the Southern Power Company. In 1924 the Southern Power Company raised the level of the dam and built the new Catawba Hydroelectric Station to replace the original. This new facility opened in August 1925, increasing the surface area of Lake Catawba from 668 acres (2.70 km2) to 13,400 acres (54.2 km2). The Southern Power Company was merged with Duke Power Company in 1927. In October 1960 the power station was renamed the Wylie Hydroelectric Station and the lake was renamed Lake Wylie, both in honor of W. Gil Wylie, one of the founders of the original Catawba Power Company that had created the lake and become Duke Power. Other information Lake Wylie cove in early DecemberLake Wylie's location on both the South Carolina and North Carolina borders makes it a common recreational destination for residents of nearby cities including Charlotte, Fort Mill, and Rock Hill. Duke Power manages six public boat access areas on the lake. There are also two towns that are located on Lake Wylie, including Tega Cay and Lake Wylie Lake Wylie is one of eleven lakes on the Catawba River and is the oldest lake in the Catawba River basin, with water being moved around each lake on the chain system through Duke Power. The lake has a surface area of approximately 13,443 acres (54.361 km2) with of shoreline, and stretches from the Mountain Island Dam, south of Mountain Island Lake in North Carolina to the Wylie Dam on the south end of the lake. The average depth of the lake is just over 20 feet. The Catawba Nuclear Generating Station is located on the south-western part of the lake, and draws its cooling water from the lake. Allen Steam Station located on the northern part of the lake (west of Charlotte) also draws its cooling water from the lake.

It is situated on a site in a bend of the River Wensum to the north-east of Norwich Cathedral. Bishop Walter de Suffield founded Saint Giles's Hospital, as the hospital was originally known, in 1249. What make the hospital notable today are its history of continuous care, the range of existing medieval buildings on the hospital grounds (most of which are still in use), and the extensive archives that record the hospital's long history. History The original beneficiaries of the new hospital in 1249 were aged priests, poor scholars, and sick and hungry paupers. Clerics remained unmarried in this period, so they had no family to support them in old age. The poor scholars, boys selected on merit from local song schools, were to receive a daily meal during term times. This was to continue until the boy had achieved a good grasp of Latin. With this help, bright but poor boys were given the chance to train as choristers or even to enter the priesthood. Thirty beds were earmarked for the sick poor, and thirteen paupers were to be fed at the hospital gates each day. Four chaplains, a deacon and sub-deacon, as well as a master of St. Giles's, were appointed. The hospital was modelled upon the Augustinian rule under which excessive liturgical ritual was discouraged to permit more time for charitable works. Nevertheless, the master and chaplains were bound to sing three masses a day, including one for Bishop Suffield's soul, as well as a weekly mass in honour of Saint Giles. Modern times Since the mid-19th century, living accommodation has been constantly improved to meet residents' needs. In 1849, five cottages were built; a sick ward followed in 1889, a further 12 cottages in 1906, and another 17 dwellings in 1937. However, it was not only the hospital's rising population that generated the need for new buildings; newcomers had higher expectations of levels of comfort, privacy, and space. As a result, the 17 cottages built in 1937 (now called Suffield Court) were later changed to single-person dwellings. In 1972, the old sick ward was replaced by Elaine Herbert House, where an improved form of nursing care was provided. The lodge was finally demolished in 1975. Prior Court consists of eighteen single and six double flats which are designed to accommodate people who need regular support. It was opened in June 1980. In 1986, St Helen's House was converted into eight residential flats. In 1999 a new group of cottages were built behind Suffield Court. Plans were made to demolish the 12 cottages built in 1906, and replace them with a new two-storey block containing 18 flats.Norwich Evening News report. Retrieved 16 April 2010 The plans were passed and the demolition and new building work commenced during 2011. These plans include six additional flats to be added to Prior Court, the redesign of the main carpark and a new workshop to be built on the site of the current garages. The new two-storey block of 18 flat now called Holme Terrace is almost fully occupied and the refurbished Prior Court should start taking in residents within the next few weeks.

Hamon de Calthorpe was the first Master in 1256, and sixty-four Masters have followed him until the present day. Substantial changes that modernised the Great Hospital and ensured that it was a model community for the elderly going into the twenty- first century were initiated by Jack Davies Shaw, Master from 1965 until 1980. The first female Master was Dorothy North from 2000 until 2007, and the current Master is Mr Andrew Barnes.  References  Sources *.

It was discovered by Johann Elert Bode in 1775. M53 is one of the more outlying globular clusters, being about light-years away from the Galactic Center, and almost the same distance (about ) from the Solar system. The cluster has a core radius (rc) of 2.18 pc, a half-light radius (rh) of 5.84 pc, and a tidal radius (rtr) of 239.9 pc. This is considered a metal-poor cluster and at one time was thought to be the most metal-poor cluster in the Milky Way. Abundance measurements of cluster members on the red giant branch show that most are first-generation stars. That is, they did not form from gas recycled from previous generations of stars. This differs from the majority of globular clusters that are more dominated by second generation stars. The second generation stars in NGC 5024 tend to be more concentrated in the core region. Overall, the stellar composition of cluster members is similar to members of the Milky Way halo. The cluster displays various tidal- like features including clumps and ripples around the cluster, and tails along the cluster's orbit in an east-west direction. A tidal bridge-like structure appears to connect M53 with the close, very diffuse neighbor NGC 5053, as well as an envelope surrounding both clusters. These may indicate a dynamic tidal interaction has occurred between the two clusters; a possibly unique occurrence within the Milky Way since there are no known binary clusters within the galaxy. In addition, M53 is a candidate member of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy tidal stream. Among the variable star population in the cluster, there are 55 known to be RR Lyrae variables. Of these, a majority of 34 display behavior typical of the Blazhko effect, including 23 of type RRc ‚Äì the largest known population of the latter in any globular cluster. There are also at least three variables of type SX Phe and a semi-regular red giant.

In an academic capacity, she taught at the Warburg Institute of the University of London for many years, and also wrote a number of books on the subject of esoteric history. Yates was born to a middle-class family in Portsmouth, and was largely self-educated, before attaining a BA and MA in French at University College London. She began to publish her research in scholarly journals and academic books, focusing on 16th century theatre and the life of John Florio. In 1941, she was employed by the Warburg Institute, and began to work on what she termed \\"Warburgian history\\", emphasising a pan-European and inter- disciplinary approach to historiography. In 1964 she published Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition, an examination of Bruno, which came to be seen as her most significant publication. In this book, she emphasised the role of Hermeticism in Bruno's works, and the role that magic and mysticism played in Renaissance thinking. She wrote extensively on the occult or Neoplatonic philosophies of the Renaissance. Her books Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition (1964), The Art of Memory (1966), and The Rosicrucian Enlightenment (1972) are major works. She \\"dealt with traditions whose remoteness she could not eliminate, even while she made them more understandable.\\"John Michael Krois, Ars Memoriae, Philosophy and Culture: Frances Yates and After, in Glenn Alexander Magee (editor), Philosophy and Culture: Essays in Honor of Donald Phillip Verene (2002); Biography =Youth: 1899-1913= Frances Amelia Yates was born on 28 November 1899 in the southern English coastal town of Portsmouth. She was the fourth child of middle-class parents, James Alfred and Hannah Malpas Yates, and had two sisters, Ruby and Hannah, and a brother, Jimmy. James was the son of a Royal Navy gunner, and had become a naval apprentice in the dockyards during his teenage years, working his way up to a senior position in which he oversaw the construction of dreadnoughts. He had taught himself to read and was a keen reader, ensuring that his children had access to plenty of books. James was a devout Anglican Christian, influenced by the Oxford Movement and sympathetic to the Catholic Church. Frances was christened in February 1900 at St. Anne's Church in the dockyard, although from an early age had doubts about Christianity and the literal accuracy of the Bible. In 1902, James was transferred to Chatham Dockyards, and then in December 1903 he relocated to Glasgow to become superintendent of shipbuilding on the River Clyde. There, the family began attending the Scottish Episcopal Church of St. Mary. James retired in 1911, although continued to offer his advice and expertise to the dockyards. The family moved regularly over the coming years, from a farmhouse in Ingleton, Yorkshire, to Llandrindod Wells, to Ripon, to Harrogate, and then to Oxton in Cheshire. They also took annual holidays to France each summer. Throughout this period, Yates' education was haphazard. In her early years, she was home schooled, being taught to read by her sisters before her mother took over her education as they moved away from home. When in Glasgow she briefly attended the private Laurel Bank School, but wouldn't attend school for two years after leaving the city. Despite a lack of formal education, she read avidly, becoming a fan of the plays of William Shakespeare, and the poetry of the Romantics and Pre-Raphaelites, in particular that of Dante Gabriel Rossetti and John Keats. She also began to write; in March 1913, Yates published a short story in the Glasgow Weekly Herald. Aged 16 she began writing a diary, in which she stated that \\"my brother wrote poems, my sister writes novels, my other sister paints pictures and I, I must & will do something. I am not much good at painting, I am no good at all at music, so there is only writing left. So I will write.\\" =Early career: 1914-38= In 1914, the First World War broke out; her brother joined the British Army, and was killed in battle in 1915. As a result, she asserted that the \\"war broke our family... As a teenager I lived among the ruins.\\" Deciding to pursue a university education, she unsuccessfully sat the University of Oxford entrance exam, hoping to study History. The family subsequently moved to Claygate, Surrey, settling into a newly built house in which Yates would reside until her death. Her sisters had moved away, leaving Frances to care for her ageing parents, although she also regularly took the train to central London, where she spent much time reading and researching in the library of the British Museum. In the early 1920s she began an undergraduate degree in French at the University College, London. Enrolled as an external student, she devoted herself to her studies, and did not socialise with other students. She was awarded her BA with first-class honours in May 1924. She published her first scholarly article in 1925, on \\"English Actors in Paris during the Lifetime of Shakespeare\\", which appeared in the inaugural issue of The Review of English Studies. She then embarked on an MA in French at the University of London, this time as an internal student. Her thesis was titled \\"Contribution to the Study of the French Social Drama in the Sixteenth Century\\", and in it she argued that the plays of this period could be seen as propaganda aimed at the illiterate population. Although authored for a degree in French, it was heavily historical, and showed Yates' interest in challenging prior assumptions and interpretations of the past. Supervised by Louis M. Brandin and F.Y. Eccles, she was awarded her MA on the basis of it in 1926.Yates' profile at arthistorians.info. From 1929 to 1934, Yates taught French at the North London Collegiate School, but disliked it as it left little time for her to devote to her research. While rummaging through the London Public Record Office, she learned of John Florio in a 1585 testimonial. Intrigued by him, she devoted her third scholarly paper to the subject of Florio: \\"John Florio at the French Embassy\\", which appeared in The Modern Language Review in 1929. She proceeded to author a biography of Florio, John Florio: The Life of an Italian in Shakespeare's England, which Cambridge University Press published in 1934; they agreed to the publication on the condition that it be shortened and that Yates contributed ¬£100 to its publication. The book gained positive reviews and earned Yates the British Academy's Mary Crawshaw Prize. Having previously relied on self-taught Italian, in summer 1935 she spent several weeks at a course in the language held for scholars at Girton College, University of Cambridge; here she developed lifelong friendships with Nesca Robb and Linetta di Castelvecchio, both fellow scholars of the Renaissance. Yates' second book was A Study of Love's Labour's Lost, an examination of Love's Labour's Lost. It was published by Cambridge University Press in 1936. Through her research into Florio, Yates had become intrigued by one of his associates, Giordano Bruno. She translated Bruno's La Cena de la ceneri (The Ash Wednesday Supper), and added an introduction in which she argued against the prevailing view that Bruno had simply been a proponent of Copernicus' Heliocentric theories; instead she argued that he was calling for a return to Medieval Catholicism. She offered the book to Cambridge University Press, who declined to publish it, and later commented that it was \\"the worst of my efforts... it was lamentably ignorant of Renaissance thought and Renaissance magic.\\" In reassessing Bruno's thought, Yates had been influenced by a number of other scholars who had begun to recognise the role of magic and mysticism in Renaissance thought: French historian of science Pierre Duhem, American historian Lynn Thorndike, and Renaissance studies scholar Francis Johnson. Yates' biographer Marjorie Jones suggested that this interpretation was partly influenced by her own religious views, which - influenced by the Romanticists and Pre-Raphaelites - adored Catholic ritual and were critical of the Protestant Reformation. =Joining the Warburg Institute: 1939-60= One of Yates' friends, the historian and fellow Bruno scholar Dorothea Singer, introduced her to Edgar Wind, Deputy Directory of the Warburg Institute, at a weekend house party in Par, Cornwall. At Wind's invitation, Yates contributed a paper on \\"Giordano Bruno's Conflict with Oxford\\" for the second issue of the Journal of the Warburg Institute in 1939, which she followed with \\"The Religious Policy of Giordano Bruno\\" in the third issue. In these articles, she did not yet associate Bruno with Hermeticism. In 1941, the Warburg's Director Fritz Saxl offered Yates a job at the Institute, then based in South Kensington; she agreed, taking on the post which revolved largely on editing the Journal but which also gave her much time to continue her independent research. By this time, Britain had entered the Second World War against Nazi Germany, and Yates involved herself in the war effort, being trained in first aid by the Red Cross and volunteered as an ARP ambulance attendant. In 1941, her father died during an air raid, although the cause of death is not known. Yates herself continued to battle with depression, and was deeply unhappy. The Warburg Institute at Woburn Place In 1943, Yates was awarded the British Federation of University Women's Marion Reilly Award. She also gave an address to the Federation's Committee on International Relations on \\"How will History be written if the Germans win this war?\\" At the Warburg, her intellectual circle included Anthony Blunt, Margaret Whinney, Franz Boaz, Ernst Gombrich, Gertrud Bing, Charles and Dorothea Singer, D.P. Walker, Fritz Saxl, Eug√©nie Droz, and Roy Strong. At this time, she also developed lifelong friendships with Jan van Dorsten and Rosemond Tuve, both scholars. Upon Britain's victory in the war, Yates was among a number of Warburg scholars who emphasised the need for pan-European historiography, so as to reject the nationalisms that had led to the World Wars; this approach, she believed, must be both international and interdisciplinary. She described this new approach as \\"Warburgian history\\", defining this as the \\"history of culture as a whole - the history of thought, science, art, including the history of imagery and symbolism.\\" Connected to this, she believed that school education should focus on pan-European, rather than simply British history. The Warburg Institute published Yates' third book in 1947 as The French Academies of the Sixteenth Century. She described this as \\"an ambitious effort to apply the Warburgian modes of work, to use art, music philosophy, religion\\" to elucidate the subject. The following year, she began to contemplate writing a book on Bruno, and spent September 1951 in Italy, visiting places that had been associated with his life. By 1948, both Yates' sisters had moved back to the family home in Claygate, however in March 1951 Hannah died of leukemia, and Yates' mother died in October 1952. Despite the problems in her personal life, she continued her scholarship, typically publishing two or three scholarly papers a year. She also lectured on the subjects of her research at various different universities across Britain; during the 1950s she lectured on the subject of esp√©rance imp√©riale, which would later be collected and published as Astraea: The Imperial Theme in the Sixteenth Century (1975). In 1954, Gertrud Bing became Director of the Warburg, overseeing the move from South Kensington to a specially constructed building in Woburn Square, Bloomsbury. Bing was a close friend of Yates, and they often went on holidays together. Yates' fourth book, published in 1959, was The Valois Tapestries, in which she discussed the eponymous tapestries in the Uffizi in Florence, Italy. She offered a novel interpretation of the tapestries, approaching them as if they were \\"a detective story\\" and arguing that they were meant as portraits of the French royal family. =International acclaim: 1961-81= Yates' scholarly productivity increased in the 1960s and 1970s, when she also became a regular book reviewer for The New York Review of Books. In 1961, Yates authored Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition, which has come to be widely regarded as her masterpiece. In her diary, she wrote that she now \\"saw Hermeticism as the clue to Bruno and the whole view of Renaissance magic in relation to him.\\" She had been encouraged to adopt this view by her friend, D.P. Walker. The book was published in 1964 by Cambridge University Press. The work brought her international scholarly fame, and in 1965 she went on a lecture tour of the United States. Her next publication was a part-sequel to Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition, being published as The Art of Memory in 1966. In 1967, she was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA). In 1969 she published Theatre of the World. Her next book, published by Routledge in 1972, was The Rosicrucian Enlightenment, in which she looked at the influence of the Rosicrucian manifestos in 16th century Europe. In 1971, Yates was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of East Anglia, which was presented to her by Angus Wilson, and in the New Year Honours 1972 Yates was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to Art History. In October 1973, she was awarded a ¬£5000 Wolfson Award for her wider oeuvre, and in January 1974, Yates delivered four Northcliffe lectures at University College London (UCL). They would subsequently be published by Routledge in 1975 as Shakespeare's Last Plays: A New Approach. She was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1975. That same year also saw the publication of Astraea: The Imperial Theme in the Sixteenth Century, which collected together lectures that she had presented in the 1950s. In February 1976, Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts offered Yates the Kennedy Professorship, which she declined. Yates was promoted in the Queen's Birthday Honours 1977 to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) for services to Renaissance studies. In 1978, the University of Pisa awarded her the Premio Galilio Galilie for her contribution to the study of Italian history. In March 1979, the British Academy awarded her a ¬£2000 grant so that she could continue to travel from her home to London in order to conduct research. In 1974, an academic conference was held at UCLA's Clark Library in Los Angeles, California that debated and discussed what was termed the \\"Yates thesis\\". The last decade of her life saw her critics become both more numerous and more outspoken, however she gained a champion in the form of historian Hugh Trevor- Roper, who positively reviewed her works and became a personal friend. In 1979, Yates published The Occult Philosophy in the Elizabethan Age, in which she discussed the place of the Christian Cabala during the Renaissance and its influence on Christian Neoplatonism. It did not prove as successful as her books published in the 1960s. It was during the early 1970s that she began writing an autobiography, inspired by E.M. Forster's biography of Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson; it was left unfinished on her death, although portions were published posthumously. In March 1979, Yates moved her sister Ruby into a nursing home, before embarking on a lecture tour of the U.S. Ruby died in May 1980, leaving Yates as the last surviving member of her immediate family. In 1980 Yates was elected a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. In summer 1981, Yates traveled on a lecture tour of Hungary, coming to believe that Anglophone scholarship had neglected Central Europe. Her final lecture was delivered at Manchester Cathedral, and was on the subject of John Dee, whom Yates was taking an increasing research interest in. Shortly after, she fell over at home, and was hospitalised with a cracked femur. She recovered and returned home, where she died in her sleep. Her body was cremated in an Anglican memorial service. Scholarly writings With the publication of Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition Yates highlighted the hermeticism within Renaissance culture, and spoke of the interest in mysticism, magic and Gnosticism of Late Antiquity that survived the Middle Ages. Yates suggested that the itinerant Catholic priest Giordano Bruno was executed in 1600 for espousing the Hermetic tradition rather than his affirmation of cosmic eccentricity. Her works drew attention to the role played by magic in early modern science and philosophy, before scholars such as Keith Thomas brought this topic into the historiographical mainstream. Thomas references Yates, alongside Piyo M. Rattansi, for the basic point that hermetic thinking fed into the foundations of modern science, before being dispelled later.Keith Thomas, Religion and the Decline of Magic (1971), note p. 268. Yates' biographer Marjorie Jones asserted that Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition \\"galvanized Renaissance historiography\\" by illustrating how mysticism and magic had played a role in Renaissance culture and the scientific revolution. She further asserted that the book \\"brought [Yates] to the forefront of Renaissance studies.\\" Reputation Historian of religion Henrik Bogdan asserted that Yates' work was \\"instrumental in changing the attitude of historians of science and philosophy toward esotericism.\\" Although some of her conclusions would later be challenged by other scholars,For an example, see Lisa Jardine and Jerry Brotton, Global Interests: Renaissance Art Between East And West, Reaktion Books, 2005, , p. 240: \\"Our analysis of the Valois Tapestries leads us to turn Yates's argument on its head: the tapestries actually are deeply antithetical to the Protestant, and specifically Huguenot, cause.\\" Yates remains one of the major scholars of hermeticism in Renaissance Europe;E.g. described as such on http://nccsc.net/2007/2/15/reviving-iconography, http://www.marlowe- society.org/marlowe/life/freethinkers1.html . and her book The Art of Memory (1966) has been named one of the most significant non-fiction books of the 20th century. Paolo Rossi identified two key points in it: the past importance and later loss of mnemnotechnics as a human power, where he argues that she overstated the occult or \\"Jungian\\" aspect; and the subsequent marginalization of the area, which he considers valid and of wider applicability.Paolo Rossi, Logic and the Art of Memory (2000 translation), pp. xxii‚Äìxxiii. Frances Yates and the Hermetic Tradition by Marjorie G. Jones, the first biography of Yates, was published in 2008 by Ibis Press. =Scholarly critiques= It is now said that Yates founded a paradigm, or gave out a grand narrative. In those terms, a so-called Yates paradigm (sometimes Yates Thesis), her work is contested freely. This is a view that Wouter Hanegraaff has put forth, starting with Yates as the scholar first to treat Renaissance hermeticism, integrated with Rosicrucianism, as a coherent aspect of European culture. He has stated it as an attractive paradox, the autonomous esotericism helping give birth to the scientific mentality that will be dismissive of its parent. But, it is now said, there was no unitary esoteric tradition and that view is only tenable on a selective reading of the evidence. The arguments surrounding this questioning of Yates include Lodovico Lazzarelli and the rival views of Antoine Faivre, who has proposed a clearer definition of esotericism.Henrik Bogdan, Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiation (2007), pp. 9‚Äì10. Hanegraaff argued that the reception of Yates' work was coloured by the Zeitgeist. An extra assumption, that the magus had a point of view that could be recovered, was fashionably added. Further he argues that essentialist rather than nominalist use of the very term \\"esotericism\\" has vitiated succeeding work. The \\"Yates paradigm\\", in his view, dominated in the 1970s but fell by the wayside in the 1980s for scholars.Wouter Hanegraaff, The Study of Western Esotericism, pp. 507‚Äì08, in Peter Antes, Armin W. Geertz, Randi Ruth Warne, New Approaches to the Study of Religion: Regional, Critical, and Historical Approaches (2004). Hints on the \\"Yates thesis\\" were left as sketches in works of Yates herself (Francis Bacon in relation to hermeticism, and the Hartlib circle, in particular). These related to paths, and how actual influence on science was effected. Brian Vickers identifies Rattansi, A. G. Debus and Peter J. French as on the side of the Yates thesis, with M. B. Hesse, Edward Rosen, Paolo Rossi, and Charles Trinkaus on the other side. He notes that the debate (up to 1984) was not conducted by close reading of texts and evidence; he himself is entirely unconvinced by the thesis.Brian Vickers, Occult and Scientific Mentalities in the Renaissance (1984), pp. 5‚Äì6. Yates' scholarship was often criticised for using what she termed her \\"powerful historical imagination\\"; she put forward scenarios that could not be proved using documentary evidence, something that many other historians saw as a flaw in her methodology. =Influence on popular culture= John Crowley drew extensively on Yates for the occult motifs in Little, Big (1981) and the √Ügypt Sequence (1987‚Äì2007) in which she briefly appears as a character. Personal life Yates' biographer Marjorie G. Jones described the historian as a \\"deeply emotional, even passionate\\" woman, who was \\"depressive, moody, [and] frequently unhappy\\", as well as being fiercely determined and hard working. Jones noted that Yates, although born in the final years of the Victorian era, remained a product of Victorian thought and value systems throughout her life. She was highly critical of nationalism, seeing it as the cause for the European wars of the early 20th century, and sought to find a solution to Europe's conflicts in history, particularly the 16th century. However, when it came to party politics, she was largely apolitical. In 1942, she commented that \\"I am an Anglican who takes the historical view that the Nazi [i.e. Protestant] revolution of 1559, and all the miserable complications which ensued, deprived me of part of my natural and native inheritance as an English Catholic.\\" Yates' journals only allude to one potential romantic attachment, to a man named Leonard, although there is no evidence that they had a relationship. There is no evidence that she was ever sexually involved with another person, although her journals are filled with references to a personal struggle against temptation, which may refer to sexual thoughts. For years, she was a chain smoker. In 2017, she featured in a conference, London's Women Historians, held at the Institute of Historical Research.London's Women Historians.

It covers an area of and has a maximum depth of . Lake Wissota is surrounded on the south by the town of Lafayette, on the north and east by the town of Anson, and on the west by the town of Eagle Point. The lake is divided into two parts by a peninsula upon which is the center of Lake Wissota Village. The smaller southern portion of the lake, the flooded portion of the valley formed by Paint Creek, is often called \\"Little Lake Wissota\\". The larger portion of the lake, lying to the north of Lake Wissota Village, is usually just called \\"Lake Wissota\\", although it is sometimes also called \\"Big Lake Wissota\\". The lake is fed by several other rivers and streams besides the Chippewa River, which enters the lake from the northwest and exits to the southwest, and Paint Creek which enters Little Lake Wissota from the east, respectively. These include Stillson Creek, which enters Little Lake Wissota from the southwest, the Yellow River which enters from the east at Moon Bay, and O'Neil Creek, which enters in the northwest, near the entrance of the Chippewa River. The lake is a popular recreation destination in northwestern Wisconsin, in the summer for boating, canoeing, fishing, water skiing, and swimming, and in the winter for ice fishing. On the northeastern shore lies Lake Wissota State Park, popular with campers, hikers, swimmers, and anglers. In popular culture, Lake Wissota is mentioned in the film Titanic. One of the film's main protagonists, Jack Dawson (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), states that he and his father would go ice fishing on Lake Wissota. However, Lake Wissota was not created until 5 years after the RMS Titanic sank. Wissota Hydroelectric Dam Wissota Hydroelectric Dam The lake was formed by the construction of the Wissota Hydroelectric Dam on the Chippewa River, completed in 1917. The dam was built by the Wisconsin- Minnesota Light and Power Company. An engineer on the project, Louis G.

The first of an eventual 22 development aircraft flew on 29 November 1940. The Ju 288 was the winner of the Bomber B contest, although the contest was started by the Junkers firm's submission of the EF 074 and their selection was never really in doubt. The Bomber B concept of a Schnellbomber was originally intended to replace the Junkers Ju 88. The Ju 288 offered a design that was larger, offered cabin pressurization for high altitude missions, had longer range, a much greater bomb payload, was even faster, and had improved defensive firepower. The design was intended to replace all the bombers then in Luftwaffe service. Delivering all of these requirements in a single airframe demanded much more powerful engines, and all of the Bomber B concepts, at one time or another, relied on the Junkers Jumo 222 engine to deliver this power. Ultimately, the Jumo 222 was a failure in spite of massive effort and several redesigns over a period of several years, with nearly 300 development prototypes produced. No suitable replacement was ever forthcoming, dooming the Ju 288 program, and leaving the Luftwaffe with older bomber designs during the second half of World War II. Design and development Prior to the opening of World War II, the Luftwaffe bomber force included three major types, the Dornier Do 17 and Ju 88, both classed as schnellbomber, and the slower but somewhat larger Heinkel He 111. Although the Ju 88 outperformed the other designs in service, it however possessed adverse characteristics, including its very small internal bomb bay that forced it to carry some of its load externally, degrading performance. Junkers had been outlining a variety of improved models of the Ju 88 since 1937, powered by the planned Jumo 222 multibank engine, or Jumo 223 inline multibank diesel of greatly increased power meant to achieve a output level, a serious challenge for Germany's aviation engine industry of the time. The EF 074 was essentially a scaled-up Ju 88, sharing its general layout and most of its fuselage and wings with extensions in various places. The nose was redesigned with a more streamlined \\"stepless cockpit\\", having no separate windscreen panels for the pilot and co-pilot. This layout allowed cabin pressurization to be more easily implemented. This design approach had been growing in favour, subsequently appearing in various German types, notably the He 111P and -H's. All of the defensive armament was meant to be remotely controlled ‚Äì in one proposal, comprising a remotely operated rear-facing dorsal turret at the rearmost end of the cockpit glazing, and two remotely operated \\"flank\\" turrets on the rearwards sides of the fuselage just forward of the empennage, otherwise each resembling the FDSL 131 units of the Me 210. The exclusive use of remotely operated turrets for the Ju 288's defensive firepower allowed them to be positioned more efficiently, as well as eliminating \\"breaks\\" in the fuselage pressurization. The fuselage was expanded along its length to allow for a much longer bomb bay ‚Äì somewhat as had been done with the Dornier Do 217 then in development itself ‚Äì that would allow for a 3,630 kg (8,000 lb) payload to be carried internally, eliminating the need to carry ordnance on outside hardpoints. No serious work was undertaken on these versions, but after Heinrich Hertel left Heinkel and joined Junkers in 1939, the EF 074 design was submitted to the RLM in May 1939. Accordingly, the RLM sent out the specifications for the Bomber B design competition in July, the Ju 88 retroactively becoming the second aircraft to be designated Bomber A, as the 3 June 1936 specification for the He 177 also had that name. The Bomber B program aimed at replacing all of the medium bombers in the Luftwaffe inventory with a new design based on the EF.74 or something with equal performance. Bomber B was intended to have even better speed than the Ju 88, high-altitude cruising with a pressurized cockpit, heavier defensive armament, range allowing it to cover any point in the British Isles, and a 4,000 kg (8,820 lb) warload, double that of the earlier generation bombers. A number of companies returned proposals, but these were to some extent a formality, the EF.74 had already been selected as the winner, and of the rest of the designs submitted, only the Focke-Wulf Fw 191 and Dornier Do 317 progressed even as far as prototypes, and the Henschel Hs 130 coming under consideration as a late entrant. Work began on building prototypes soon after, and the first example was completed by mid-1940. Power was supposed to be supplied by two 24-cylinder Jumo 222 six-bank, four cylinders per bank, over-1,500 kW output class powerplants, but problems with the Jumo 222's development ‚Äì as with almost every new concept for over-1,500 kW output, reciprocating aircraft engines then underway in the Third Reich ‚Äì meant the first prototypes flew with BMW 801 radial engines, instead. The first flight-quality 222s did not arrive until October 1941, and even then it was clear they were nowhere near ready for full-scale production. When it became apparent the 222 was not likely to become a viable powerplant, in May 1942, Junkers proposed replacing them, for their projected Ju 288C version, with the much heavier Daimler Benz DB 606s instead; the same 1.5 tonne, twin-crankcase \\"welded-together engines\\" that Reichsmarschall Hermann G√∂ring complained about some three months later, regarding the He 177's own endless powerplant troubles. =Undercarriage difficulties= Ju 288 V1 prototype with twin BMW 801 engines. Is it being held in flying attitude by a support under the tail. The actuator rods for the landing gear's oleo struts are visible behind the main struts. The Ju 288's intricate main landing gear system's design proved to be troublesome, possessing twin vertical members comprising the main \\"Y-shaped\\" retraction strut unit, directly behind a single oleo strut,Archive photo of Ju 288 starboard main landing gear for each pair of twinned wheels mounted through a forward-projecting lever-action arm, to the lower end of the uniquely attached main oleo strut unit. This single-tube oleo strut was pivoted off the lower end of the twin-member, \\"Y-shaped\\" retraction strut unit, and was rotated in the vertical plane about this single attachment in a rearwards direction during retraction of the main-gear unit, separate from the twin-member unit to help \\"shorten\\" its stowed length within the engine nacelle. This distinctive type of design required the oleo strut's freely moving top end to physically rotate downwards and aftwards during the rear-swinging retraction of the main \\"Y-shaped\\" member, operated by a lever and gear-sector system mounted on the portside of each main gear assembly, operated with a long lever that had its upper end pivoted from a fixed bracket, anchored to the firewall's rear surface. The lever/sector gear system swiveled the oleo strut about its attachment point during the retract cycle, through an arc of roughly 180¬∫ from its position when the main gear was fully extended. The stowed position of the oleo strut ended up orienting it aftwards within the rear of the engine nacelle, and placing the wheels' axle location just ahead of and above the oleo strut's pivot point when fully retracted.Animation of Ju 288 maingear retraction cycle Such a complex main gear design, with only the single pivoting retraction point for its oleo struts taking the primary stress of touchdown, was likely only one of the many potential sources of trouble causing the Ju 288's main gear units to repeatedly collapse on touchdown. Operational history  Although the 288 never even reached production status, let alone official operational service, the aircraft did see limited combat duty. In 1944, following the cancellation of the 288 program, the surviving A and C series prototypes were hurriedly fitted with defensive armament and equipment and deployed as reconnaissance bombers on the Western Front. Very few missions were flown, owing to the scarcity of aviation fuel and spare parts, and the unresolved problems with the aircraft's powerplant and undercarriage. It is believed that the 288s were attached to the same unit operating the small number of Ju 388 reconnaissance planes that saw service.

Background Ibsen was born in Christiania (now called Oslo), but grew up mostly in Germany and Italy. Being the only child of playwright Henrik Ibsen and his wife Suzannah Thoresen, he struggled all his life to meet his family's high expectations. Ibsen developed 'remarkably early', being able to read at the age of four and was fluent in Norwegian, German and Italian. Growing up however, Ibsen struggled to find friends who were Norwegian and his age, further complicated by the fact that his family was often deep in penury, and thus he appeared throughout his life to be impersonal to others who did not know him. He excelled in academics however, aiming to please both his parents and himself, and subsequently came top in his class for every subject including mathematics, which appears to have been a weak point of his. After passing his matriculation exams with flying colours, Ibsen received a doctorate in law at the Sapienza University of Rome in 1882. Later, he was appointed to the position of Prime Minister of Stockholm and Norway at his father's behest so that he would remain a Norwegian citizen. Some time in the late 1800s, Ibsen travelled to Aulestad to personally thank his father's old friend: author Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson for his political support, and he thus met Bjornson's family for the first time. Bjornson's daughter Bergliot remarks that she and her siblings were very excited to see Ibsen for he had been 'written and talked about so much'. Though she writes that she personally 'did not altogether like him' at first since he appeared to be 'too serious' and was 'mostly talking to Father', although she reveals that one day she was on the lower veranda of the house when Ibsen on the upper one. Suddenly he looked down and smiled at her with 'his beautiful eyes', and it appears to be this moment at which Bergliot fell in love with him as she describes, though Ibsen himself does not mention the event himself in any surviving letters or works by him. Henrik Ibsen did not initially approve of their engagement as he felt he should have known first (even going so far as to publicly deny his son's engagement and subsequently angering both his son and Bjornson), though he finally accepted it and Sigurd and Bergliot married on 11 October, 1892. The Ibsens had three children. Their son, Tancred Ibsen, became a well-known film director and their daughter, Irene Ibsen Bille, was married to Josias Bille, a member of the Danish ancient noble Bille family. Irene and Josias's sons and Sigurd and Bergliot's grandsons were Danish manager Anders Steensen Bille and Danish actor Joen Bille. Sigurd and Bergliot also had another daughter: Eleonora, who married Danish author Svend Borberg and had three children. Towards the end of his life, Sigurd Ibsen was said to be constantly in a low state of mind (a trait which seems to have been passed on to his daughter Eleonora), and lived 'in his own world', though he was at times lively and even slightly flirtatious as he had always been. None of his family noticed that he was seriously ill from what was actually cancer as he still had very good movement, although his wife mentions that he had to suddenly speak in a hoarse whisper. After a medical operation that was made on his throat, his final days were mostly spent unconscious, and he died on April 14 1930. Sigurd Ibsen is buried in the Cemetery of Our Saviour, in Oslo, Norway. Prime Minister in Stockholm From 1903 to 1905, Sigurd Ibsen served as Prime Minister of Norway in Stockholm (i.e., the leader of the Norwegian delegation to the King of Sweden and Norway and the second highest cabinet position). During his term, George Francis Hagerup was Prime Minister in Christiania. Sigurd Ibsen played a central role in the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905, being credited with having introduced the idea. He is also regarded as important in convincing influential Norwegians supporting a republican government, like Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson, Arne Garborg and Fridtjof Nansen, to turn and instead support a monarchy. To his colleagues, Ibsen was an outspoken Norwegian patriot who was to be avoided, though his ideas succeeded in the end. Ancestry  Literature *Langslet, Lars Roar. S√∏nnen.

It was formed in 1953 when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dammed the Kern River at the junction of its two forks at Whiskey Flat. At , it is one of the larger reservoirs in California. The area is in the southern end of the Sierra Nevada range and the lake itself is located in low mountains at an elevation of approximately where summer temperatures reach over but low enough to avoid winter snows on the surrounding ridges. Lake Isabella is located about northeast of Bakersfield, and is the main water supply for that city. Lake Isabella can be reached by car from Bakersfield via state Highway 178 and from Delano via Highway 155. The former towns of Isabella and Kernville were flooded by the newly created reservoir.  Isabella Dam deficiency  In 2006, Isabella Dam was found to be too unstable to hold a full amount of water and approximately 40% of a full reservoir had to be let out to restabilize the earth works. Presently the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers won't let the water get above 60% of capacity until an estimated 10‚Äì15 years of studies and repairs are made.(completion date needed) To further add to this problem the Isabella Dam bisects an active fault that could lead to a catastrophic failure if an earthquake occurs along it. This fault was considered inactive when the site was studied in the late 1940s.  Recreation  The dam is operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and several recreation areas are located around the lake as a part of the Sequoia National Forest. The lake is a dividing point. Upper Kern River flows into Lake Isabella, Lower Kern River flows out of the dam and toward Bakersfield. The nearby towns of Lake Isabella and Kernville receive economic benefit from tourism created by the Lake Isabella Recreation Area and the whitewater rafting attraction of the Upper and Lower Kern River. Much of the wilderness surrounding the lake is part of the Sequoia National Forest.

Reynolds (born September 3, 1950) is an American politician from the U.S. state of New York, formerly representing the state's 27th and 26th Congressional districts in the United States House of Representatives. Reynolds was chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, the official Republican House campaign organization, for the 2006 election cycle. He retired amid scandal at the end of the 110th Congress. Chris Lee was elected to succeed him. Early life Reynolds was born in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, and graduated from the Springville-Griffith Institute. He served in the New York Air National Guard from 1970-76. He entered politics as a Republican, and was elected to the Concord, New York, town board in 1974, and to the Erie County legislature in 1982. He was a member of the New York State Assembly (147th D.) from 1989 to 1998, sitting in the 188th, 189th, 190th, 191st and 192nd New York State Legislatures. He was Minority Leader from June 1995 to March 1998. U.S. House of Representatives =1998 election= Reynolds ran for the House in 1998 after Bill Paxon was forced out of his leadership role in the House Republican leadership ranks because of his role in a coup attempt against Newt Gingrich. Paxon endorsed Reynolds, who had managed several of his past campaigns, as his successor. There was controversy because Reynolds did not live in Paxon's district; his Springville home was in the neighboring district of fellow Republican Jack Quinn, who was running for his own reelection. Reynolds would not move into the district until eight months after the election when he purchased a home in Clarence, near Amherst, one of the larger towns in the seven-county district. =Committee assignments= * Ways and Means Committee  Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures  Subcommittee on Trade =Political positions= Reynolds had a conservative voting record in Congress. His 83 percent rating from the American Conservative Union tied him with Peter T. King of Long Island as the third-most conservative among the state's 29 Representatives as of the 110th Congress. Only Representatives Randy Kuhl (92%) and Vito Fossella (84%) received higher ratings.American Conservative Union ratings of New York state members of Congress Reynolds is on record as a member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).ALEC 1995 SB =Re-elections= In the 2000 round of redistricting, a special master proposed a plan that would have made his district slightly more Democratic. Although Republicans would have still held a plurality, the plan would have left Reynolds vulnerable to a primary with a moderate Republican. According to one political strategist, Reynolds and his allies in Washington wanted a district that would let him vote \\"like a Southern conservative\\". With the help of Vice President Dick Cheney, Reynolds pressured the state legislature to gerrymander his district so that it closely resembled his former territory. He was handily reelected from this reconfigured district in 2002. In 2004, his opponent was millionaire industrialist Jack Davis. Reynolds won by 12 points, an unusually close margin given that he had won with 72% of the vote two years earlier. In 2006 Reynolds again defeated Davis by 4% of the vote amid the Mark Foley page scandal. Retirement and Lobbying Career On March 20, 2008, Reynolds announced he would not run for a sixth term: \\"it was time to take up new challenges\\". Aside from fallout from the scandal regarding U.S. Representative Mark Foley (R-FL), another factor was thought to be revelations that a former NRCC treasurer had embezzled hundreds of thousands of dollars from the committee treasury while Reynolds chaired it. According to the New York Daily News political reporter Elizabeth Benjamin, the NRCC was never independently audited during Reynolds' three-year tenure as its chairman. Reynolds was the 29th Republican incumbent to announce he would not run again in 2008. Despite the perception that Reynolds had the district redrawn to protect him, it is actually a somewhat marginal district on paper; it has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+3. In 2017, Reynolds joined Washington, D.C. lobbying firm Holland and Knight as a senior policy advisor. National Republican Congressional Committee Reynolds served as chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee from 2003 to 2006. During the 2004 House elections the Republicans gained three seats to increase their majority to 232. The 2006 House election saw a Republican loss of 30 seats, losing the majority to the Democrats. 2006 House page scandal Rodney Alexander (R-Louisiana), the sponsor of a House page (from his district) who received e-mails from Representative Mark Foley, told reporters that he learned of the e-mails from the page's family in November 2005. Alexander said the family did not want the matter pursued. Alexander said he passed information that Foley had appeared overly friendly first to Majority Leader John Boehner, and later to Reynolds, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. Carl Forti, a spokesman for the GOP campaign organization, said Reynolds also was told by Alexander that the parents did not want to pursue the matter and that they did not want a large- scale investigation. Reynolds later issued a statement that he had spoken with House Speaker Dennis Hastert about the matter early in 2006. According to the Washington Post, \\"Republican insiders said Reynolds spoke out because he was angry that Hastert appeared willing to let him take the blame for the party leadership's silence.\\" Hastert did not \\"explicitly recall\\" that conversation but said he did not dispute it. On October 2, Reynolds held a press conference on the matter, from Buffalo at Daemen College while surrounded by numerous children of his adult supporters. He said he took the Foley matter to his \\"supervisor\\" as soon as he found out about it. Reynolds claimed that he had no knowledge of any sexual conversations or e-mails between Foley and the page until after it was disclosed in the media. Soon after, he made a televised campaign advertisement stating that he had had no knowledge of the depth of Foley's transgressions until afterwards. In December 2006, Reynolds was largely exonerated by the Republican-controlled House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, which probed the Foley case. The Rochester Democrat and Chronicle reported in its December 9 edition that \\"Rep. Tom Reynolds told the truth when he said he told House Speaker Dennis Hastert about ex-Rep. Mark Foley's questionable e-mails to congressional pages, the House ethics committee has concluded\\", while the Associated Press reported \\"the House ethics committee on Friday cleared Rep. Thomas Reynolds and his ex-chief of staff Kirk Fordham of wrongdoing in the congressional page scandal.\\" On page 76 of its report, the committee reported they had uncovered that \\"the communications directors for both the House Democratic Caucus and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee also had copies of the e-mails in the fall of 2005\\", months prior to Reynolds' knowledge of the incident. During the 2006 campaign, Republicans charged that Democrats had prior knowledge of Foley's inappropriate e-mails with a House page. Democrats, including DCCC Chairman Rahm Emanuel, denied the accusation.

His books include Lizard Music, The Snarkout Boys and the Avocado of Death, Fat Men from Space, Borgel, and the picture book The Big Orange Splot. He has also written an adult novel, The Afterlife Diet, and essay collections derived from his talks on National Public Radio. Many elements of his fiction are based on real events and people he encountered in his youth. Pinkwater is a trained artist and has illustrated many of his books, but for more recent works, that task has passed to his wife, Jill Pinkwater. His artistic technique varies from work to work, with some books illustrated in computer drawings, others in woodcuts and others in Magic Marker. Pinkwater varies his name slightly between books (for instance, \\"Daniel Pinkwater\\", \\"Daniel M. Pinkwater\\", \\"Daniel Manus Pinkwater\\", \\"D. Manus Pinkwater\\"). He was born in Memphis, Tennessee, to Jewish immigrant parents from Poland. He describes his father as a \\"ham-eating, iconoclastic Jew.\\" His parents moved to Chicago, where he grew up. He attended Bard College. Themes Pinkwater tends to write about social misfits who find themselves in bizarre situations, such as searching for a floating island populated by human-sized intelligent lizards (Lizard Music), exploring other universes with an obscure relative (Borgel), or discovering that their teeth can function as interstellar radio antennae (Fat Men from Space). They are often, though not always, set in thinly‚Äîor not at all‚Äîdisguised versions of Chicago and Hoboken, New Jersey. He often includes Chicago landmarks and folkloric figures from his childhood in 1950s Chicago, regardless of when the book is set. An example of this is the recurring character the Chicken Man, a mysterious but dignified black man who carries a performing chicken on his head. This character is based on a shadowy figure from 1950s Chicago; after Pinkwater made him a lead character in Lizard Music he received letters from Chicago residents who remembered the Chicken Man. Pinkwater also pays tribute to the Clark Theater (a repertory movie theatre on Clark Street in the Chicago Loop that changed features daily and stayed open all night), Bughouse Square, and Ed & Fred's Red Hots. Another common theme is Jewish culture, with characters incongruously speaking in Yiddish-influenced dialogue or participating in Borscht Belt culture. Characters sometimes have surnames that append the \\"-stein\\" element familiar in some Jewish names to names suggesting other ethnicities (e.g., \\"Wentworthstein\\"). In 1995, Pinkwater published his first adult novel, The Afterlife Diet, in which a mediocre editor, upon dying, finds himself in a tacky Catskills resort populated by \\"circumferentially challenged\\" deceased. Comics and radio Pinkwater authored the newspaper comic strip Norb, which was illustrated by Tony Auth. The strip, syndicated by King Features, was cancelled after 52 weeks. Norb Don Markstein's Toonopedia, accessed on May 10, 2007. The daily strips were released in a 78-page collection by MU Press in 1992. Pinkwater is also a longtime commentator on National Public Radio. He regularly reviews children's books on NPR's Weekend Edition Saturday. For several years, he had his own NPR show: Chinwag Theater. Pinkwater is also known to avid fans of the NPR radio show Car Talk, where he has appeared as a (seemingly) random caller, commenting, for example, on the physics of the buttocks (giving rise to the proposed unit of measure of seat size: the Pinkwater), and giving practical advice as to the choice of automobiles. In the early 1990s Pinkwater voiced a series of humorous radio advertisements for the Ford Motor Company. Challenged book Following an appearance by Pinkwater on the Public Radio International program This American Life,This American Life episode #43: Faustian Bargains, broadcast 22 November 1996. (transcript) his book The Devil in the Drain ended up on challenged book lists at numerous children's libraries. The Hare and the Pineapple used on exams In April 2012, a story attributed to Daniel Pinkwater, \\"The Hare and the Pineapple\\", was used on a standardized exam for 8th grade students in New York. The story was based on Pinkwater's short story, \\"The Story of the Rabbit and the Eggplant\\", which he had sold to the testing company. The published version changed the racer from an eggplant to a pineapple, and changed the moral of the story. Students were asked two perplexing questions: \\"Why did the animals eat the pineapple?\\" and \\"Which animal spoke the wisest words?\\" These questions baffled students. City Schools Chancellor Dennis Walcott issued a statement saying improvements on the state exam will be made in the future. The New York Daily News staff sent the question to Jeopardy! champion Ken Jennings, and he was stumped as well.

As she grew older and weaker, one day she prayed to her lord that \\"O lord I have become old and weak, unable to visit Varanasi and have your darshan, what do I do\\". On the night of that day Lord Shiva appeared in her dream and told her that she need not come to Varanasi to see him, he himself will come and reside in Hiriyur. As promised, Lord Shiva was believed to have incarnated in the \\"oraLukallu\\" (a stone of cylindrical shape used in the households of ancient India for grinding purpose).

It was first published in English in 1973; a second edition was published in 1986. Plot summary Memoirs Found in a Bathtub starts with the finding of a diary in the distant future. The introduction dwells on the difficulties of historical research on the fictional 'Neogene Era', \\"the period of the heyday of the pre-Chaotic culture, which preceded the Great Decomposition\\". \\"Great Decomposition\\" refers to the apocalyptic event of \\"papyrolysis\\", decomposition of all paper on the planet in the pre-information-technology era, causing all records and money to turn into dust‚Äì‚Äìthe end of the \\"epoch of papycracy\\". The diary, known as the 'Notes of a Man from the Neogene', was found in the lava-filled ruins of Third Pentagon within the territory of the disappeared state of Ammer-Ka. Previously, little was known about the hypothetical 'Last Pentagon'. One researcher suggested that Pentagon was a kind of military brain, the center in charge of maintaining the faith of Cap-i-Taal, dominant in Ammer-Ka in the period of U-S. This was confirmed by the finding of the diary, supposedly of an agent trapped deep within the subterranean bowels of the vast Third Pentagon, although the authenticity and authorship of the document were questioned by some researchers. The rest of the book is the diary itself. In a Kafkaesque maelstrom of terrifying bureaucratic confusion and utter insanity, the agent attempts to follow his mission directives, conducting on-the-spot investigations: \\"Verify. Search. Destroy. Incite. Inform. Over and out. On the nth day nth hour sector n subsector n rendezvous with N.\\" The narrator inhabits a paranoid dystopia where nothing is as it seems, chaos seems to rule all events, and everyone is deeply suspicious of everyone else. Commentary Theodore Sturgeon described Memoirs Found in a Bathtub as \\"A well-wrought nightmare indeed.\\"\\"Galaxy Bookshelf\\", Galaxy Science Fiction, November 1973, p.84 Lem himself describes the book as a \\"combination of grim weirdness with humor\\". He writes that the novel goes beyond casual political satire: it puts forth the \\"totalization of the notion of intentionality\\". Explaining the concept, he writes that everything which humans perceive may be interpreted by them as a message, and that a number of \\"-isms\\" are based on interpreting the whole Universe as a message to its inhabitants. This interpretation may be exploited for political purposes and then run amok beyond their intentions.Lem's commentary to the novel The title alludes to Jan Potocki's novel The Manuscript Found in Saragossa.Jerzy Jarzƒôbski, Andrzej Sulikowski, \\"Stanis≈Çaw Lem: pisarz, my≈õliciel, cz≈Çowiek\\", 2003, , p. 387 References Further reading *John Rothfork, \\"Memoirs Found in a Bathtub: Stanislaw Lem's Critique of Cybernetics\\" *Hanna Salich, \\"Authorial Neologisms in Translation: Is the Translator a Smuggler?\\", In: Miƒôdzy Orygina≈Çem aPrzek≈Çadem2020, no. 1(47), pp.59-78  on translation of neologisms in Memoirs Found in a Bathtub 1961 science fiction novels Dystopian novels Novels by Stanis≈Çaw Lem ","title":"Memoirs Found in a Bathtub"},{"id":"963844","text":"The Hope Slide The Hope Slide was the second largest recorded landslide in Canada (after the similarly sized 2010 Mount Meager landslide).New estimates of mount meager 2010 slide puts hope slide second to it It occurred in the morning hours of January 9, 1965 in the Nicolum Valley in the Cascade Mountains near Hope, British Columbia, and killed four people.

Changes in groundwater condition, often a trigger for landslides, is not thought to have played a role in the Hope Slide as the slide occurred during a protracted period of sub-zero temperatures in the winter, though some have suggested that freezing of seepage exit points may have caused an increase in water pressure at the toe of the slide.Brideau, M.A. Stead, D, Kinakin, D, and Fecova, K. 2005. Engineering Geology 80, 245-259. Result The highway has since been rerouted around and over the base of the slide's debris field 55 metres above the original ground level on the other side of valley. Most of the massive scar on the mountain face remains bare rock, without significant growth of trees or other large vegetation. It is quite easily visible from aircraft passing overhead. A view point on Highway 3 allows tourists to view the scar. A four kilometre stretch of the prior routing lies disused to the north of the new highway alignment. Aircraft On August 13, 1965, an aircraft piloted by S.W.K. Stevenson crashed, killing him. On April 23, 1966, a Royal Canadian Air Force Grumman CSR-110 Albatross (9302) serving with No. 121 Composite Unit (KU) at RCAF Station Comox, BC crashed on the Hope Slide. It was the only RCAF Albatross loss. Five of the six crew members died (Squadron Leader James L. Braiden (passenger), Flying Officer Christopher J. Cormier (radio operator), Leading Aircraftsman Robert E. MacNaughton (crewman), Flight Lieutenant Phillip L. Montgomery (co-pilot), and Flight Lieutenant Peter Semak (pilot)). Flying Officer Bob Reid (navigator) was the sole survivor. A portion of the wreckage is still visible and can be hiked to.

Typical metal objects include utensils, coffee pots, and similar household items. Wooden objects include tables, chairs, and chests, including hope chests, toyboxes and jewelry boxes. With a longer history in Europe (see toleware), in America the practice began in 18th century New England, and was also extensively carried on among German immigrants in Pennsylvania. A separate, related tradition occurs in the Netherlands and among Scandinavian countries and immigrants, including Norwegians, Danes and Swedes. German tole painting may concentrate more on metal and tin objects, while Scandinavians and Netherlanders may concentrate more on wooden objects and furniture. Patterns in the two traditions vary slightly as well. Modern tole painting typically uses inexpensive, long- lasting and sturdy acrylic paints. Good quality wooden work is sealed, primed and sanded before the decorative paint is applied. The most beloved family objects tend to be high quality utensils or furniture, painted freehand with favorite patterns, colors or flowers, humorous themes, family in-jokes, or illustrations of favorite or family stories. The perceived value of a tolled utensil increases with its quality as a utensil, the quality of the art, and the personalization, the story, of the work. An advantage of tole painting as a craft is that a bad painting can be sanded off and repainted. One of the signs of such repaintings is a black-backgrounded tole-painted object. Very often such objects are repainted, especially if the furniture or utensil is valuable and the painter is inexperienced.  Modern history  Tole painting experienced a resurgence in the 1960s when teachers began opening studios in cities around the United States. One notable teacher is Priscilla Hauser of Tulsa, Oklahoma. After opening Priscilla's Little Red Tole House in 1968, she began to organize teachers and studios around the midwest, trained students to become teachers, and in 1972 began the National Society of Tole and Decorative Painters, which would eventually become the Society of Decorative Painters. Tole painting is now a worldwide phenomenon, largely due to the international expansion of the now 41-year-old Society of Decorative Painters.

The group comprised two members, Moses P. (Moses Pelham) and Thomas H. (Thomas Hofmann). They were among the first groups to garner commercial success by rapping in German, while stylistically leaning more towards American gangsta rap.  Band history  Moses Pelham had already had moderate success as a teenager with his first English language single Twilight Zone in 1989, before hitting a brick wall in his attempts to market his self-produced second album. In 1993 he teamed up with his old friend Thomas Hofmann, whom he had met on a basketball court, to form the R√∂delheim Hartreim Projekt. They recorded their album that year with producers Martin Haas, who had worked on Moses's unreleased second album, and Robert Sattler and supported by future stars Xavier Naidoo and Sabrina Setlur. The album, entitled Direkt aus R√∂delheim (\\"Straight out of R√∂delheim\\", an allusion to N.W.A's Straight Outta Compton), surprisingly sold an impressive 160,000 copies in 1994. In 1995, when Schwester S. (a.k.a. Sabrina Setlur) released her debut album, RHP collaborated with her on the single Ja Klar (\\"Yeah, right\\") which entered the Top 10 of the German Media Control charts. In 1996 the group released their second and last album, Zur√ºck nach R√∂delheim (\\"Back to R√∂delheim\\"), which entered the charts at 3rd position and sold 180,000 copies. The first single extracted from the album, H√∂ha, Schnella, Weita (\\"Higha, Fasta, Furtha\\") received a lot of airplay and was also fairly successful. It was this year that Moses split with the group's former label, Universal Music, for his own new label, Pelham Power Productions (3p). From around then on, RHP factually ceased to exist, while Moses Pelham now concentrated on marketing his label's artists and on his own solo career.

Vani Vilasa Sagara, popularly known as Mari Kanive () is a dam in Hiriyur Taluk, Chitradurga District, in the Indian state of Karnataka. It is located about 20 km south-westerly to Hiriyur, 32 km north- easterly to Hosadurga, 58 km south-easterly to Holalkere, 50 km northerly to Huliyar, 60 km southerly to Chitradurga, and 180 km north-westerly to Bangalore. Vani Vilasa Sagara was built by the Mysore Maharajas pre- independence across the river Vedavathi. Vani Vilasa Sagara is the oldest dam in the state. The dam is an exquisite piece of architecture, an engineering marvel for that time. The dam irrigates a large area of the Deccan region of Central Karnataka, which is otherwise largely a dry land. It irrigates more than 100 km¬≤ of land in Hiriyur and Challakere taluks through right and left bank canals. Vani Vilasa Sagara dam is also the source of domestic water for water capacity is very high due to unusual rain dam become dry Hiriyur and Chitradurga. History Vani Vilasa Sagara across the river Vedavathi was built by the Mysore Maharajas pre-independence. The project was initiated by the regent Queen Maharani Kempa Nanjammani Vani Vilasa Sannidhana who was a widow of Maharaja Chamaraaja Wadiyar. She is known for her exemplary social works. For the construction of this dam royals of Mysore had to pledge royal jewellery due to shortage of money, that is why it was named as \\"Vani Vilasa Sagara\\". The Mari Kanive irrigation project was initiated by Sir. Mark Cubbon, the British Resident of Mysore.Sastri (1932):99 Further improvements to the dam was initiated by Diwan Sheshadri Iyer in 1897 at the order of his Highness the Maharaja of Mysore Sri Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV. Vani Vilasa Sagara is higher than KRS dam of Mysore. Tourism The dam has been a tourist attraction for many years, but has been apparently neglected as a prime tourist destination. Recently, though, the development work undertaken by the forest department to restore the nearby forest cover, and the 'panchavati' gardens - a garden of medicinal plants with the old Indian cultural theme has improved the tourist figures, making it a popular weekend picnic spot. The 'panchavati' garden has medicinal plants lined up representing cultural themes - the 'Rashis', 'Sapta swaras', 'Nava grahas' and many more. The tourists who visit Chitradurga and Hosdurga often visit Mari kanive on the way. The historic maarikaamba temple here also attracts many tourists. The place is around 20 km drive from Hiriyur on a deviation from NH4 (Bangalore - Mumbai National Highway). Vanivilas Dam-Loaps Directions Vanivilas dam is about 160 km from Bangalore. So it is advisable to tag Chitradurga fort with this beautiful place. No clear sign boards are available on the highway (but one landmark is there ofter we reach nd cross hiriyur bypass right side from Bangalore to Puna highway we see one sugar factory opposite side service road we take left nd go straight in 18 km), so once you reach Hiryur, slow down for the next 5 km and ask the locals for the correct deviation. Once the deviation is taken clear sign boards are available and the place is about 20 km from the deviation from the highway.

Most often the major usability problem is that there are too many alarms annunciated in a plant upset, commonly referred to as alarm flood (similar to an interrupt storm), since it is so similar to a flood caused by excessive rainfall input with a basically fixed drainage output capacity. However, there can also be other problems with an alarm system such as poorly designed alarms, improperly set alarm points, ineffective annunciation, unclear alarm messages, etc. Poor alarm management is one of the leading causes of unplanned downtime, contributing to over $20B in lost production every year, and of major industrial incidents such as the one in Texas City. Developing good alarm management practices is not a discrete activity, but more of a continuous process (i.e., it is more of a journey than a destination). Alarm problem history From their conception, large chemical, refining, power generation, and other processing plants required the use of a control system to keep the process operating successfully and producing products. Due to the fragility of the components as compared to the process, these control systems often required a control room to protect them from the elements and process conditions. In the early days of control rooms, they used what were referred to as \\"panel boards\\" which were loaded with control instruments and indicators. These were tied to sensors located in the process streams and on the outside of process equipment. The sensors relayed their information to the control instruments via analogue signals, such as a 4-20 mA current loop in the form of twisted pair wiring. At first these systems merely yielded information, and a well-trained operator was required to make adjustments either by changing flow rates, or altering energy inputs to keep the process within its designed limits. Alarms were added to alert the operator to a condition that was about to exceed a design limit, or had already exceeded a design limit. Additionally, Emergency Shut Down (ESD) systems were employed to halt a process that was in danger of exceeding either safety, environmental or monetarily acceptable process limits. Alarm were indicated to the operator by annunciator horns, and lights of different colours. (For instance, green lights meant OK, Yellow meant not OK, and Red meant BAD.) Panel boards were usually laid out in a manner that replicated the process flow in the plant. So instrumentation indicating operating units with the plant was grouped together for recognition sake and ease of problem solution. It was a simple matter to look at the entire panel board, and discern whether any section of the plant was running poorly. This was due to both the design of the instruments and the implementation of the alarms associated with the instruments. Instrumentation companies put a lot of effort into the design and individual layout of the instruments they manufactured. To do this they employed behavioural psychology practices which revealed how much information a human being could collect in a quick glance. More complex plants had more complex panel boards, and therefore often more human operators or controllers. Thus, in the early days of panel board systems, alarms were regulated by both size and cost. In essence, they were limited by the amount of available board space, and the cost of running wiring, and hooking up an annunciator (horn), indicator (light) and switches to flip to acknowledge, and clear a resolved alarm. It was often the case that if a new alarm was needed, an old one had to be given up. As technology developed, the control system and control methods were tasked to continue to advance a higher degree of plant automation with each passing year. Highly complex material processing called for highly complex control methodologies. Also, global competition pushed manufacturing operations to increase production while using less energy, and producing less waste. In the days of the panel boards, a special kind of engineer was required to understand a combination of the electronic equipment associated with process measurement and control, the control algorithms necessary to control the process (PID basics), and the actual process that was being used to make the products. Around the mid 80's, we entered the digital revolution. Distributed control systems (DCS) were a boon to the industry. The engineer could now control the process without having to understand the equipment necessary to perform the control functions. Panel boards were no longer required, because all of the information that once came across analogue instruments could be digitised, stuffed into a computer and manipulated to achieve the same control actions once performed with amplifiers and potentiometers. As a side effect, that also meant that alarms were easy and cheap to configure and deploy. You simply typed in a location, a value to alarm on and set it to active. The unintended result was that soon people alarmed everything. Initial installers set an alarm at 80% and 20% of the operating range of any variable just as a habit. The integration of programmable logic controllers, safety instrumented systems, and packaged equipment controllers has been accompanied by an overwhelming increase in associated alarms. One other unfortunate part of the digital revolution was that what once covered several square yards of panel space, now had to be fit into a 17-inch computer monitor. Multiple pages of information was thus employed to replicate the information on the replaced panel board. Alarms were used to tell an operator to go look at a page he was not viewing. Alarms were used to tell an operator that a tank was filling. Every mistake made in operations usually resulted in a new alarm. With the implementation of the OSHA 1910 regulations, HAZOPS studies usually requested several new alarms. Alarms were everywhere. Incidents began to accrue as a combination of too much data collided with too little useful information. Alarm management history Recognizing that alarms were becoming a problem, industrial control system users banded together and formed the Alarm Management Task Force, which was a customer advisory board led by Honeywell in 1990. The AMTF included participants from chemical, petrochemical, and refining operations. They gathered and wrote a document on the issues associated with alarm management. This group quickly realised that alarm problems were simply a subset of a larger problem, and formed the Abnormal Situation Management Consortium (ASM is a registered trademark of Honeywell). The ASM Consortium developed a research proposal and was granted funding from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 1994. The focus of this work was addressing the complex human-system interaction and factors that influence successful performance for process operators. Automation solutions have often been developed without consideration of the human that needs to interact with the solution. In particular, alarms are intended to improve situation awareness for the control room operator, but a poorly configured alarm system does not achieve this goal. The ASM Consortium has produced documents on best practices in alarm management, as well as operator situation awareness, operator effectiveness, and other operator-oriented issues. These documents were originally for ASM Consortium members only, but the ASMC has recently offered these documents publicly.ASM Consortium \\"Effective Alarm Management Guidelines\\". The ASM consortium also participated in development of an alarm management guideline published by the Engineering Equipment & Materials Users' Association (EEMUA) in the UK. The ASM Consortium provided data from their member companies, and contributed to the editing of the guideline. The result is EEMUA 191 \\"Alarm Systems- A Guide to Design, Management and Procurement\\". Several institutions and societies are producing standards on alarm management to assist their members in the best practices use of alarms in industrial manufacturing systems. Among them are the ISA (ISA 18.2), API (API 1167) and NAMUR (Namur NA 102). Several companies also offer software packages to assist users in dealing with alarm management issues. Among them are DCS manufacturing companies, and third-party vendors who offer add-on systems. Concepts The fundamental purpose of alarm annunciation is to alert the operator to deviations from normal operating conditions, i.e. abnormal operating situations. The ultimate objective is to prevent, or at least minimise, physical and economic loss through operator intervention in response to the condition that was alarmed. For most digital control system users, losses can result from situations that threaten environmental safety, personnel safety, equipment integrity, economy of operation, and product quality control as well as plant throughput. A key factor in operator response effectiveness is the speed and accuracy with which the operator can identify the alarms that require immediate action. By default, the assignment of alarm trip points and alarm priorities constitute basic alarm management. Each individual alarm is designed to provide an alert when that process indication deviates from normal. The main problem with basic alarm management is that these features are static. The resultant alarm annunciation does not respond to changes in the mode of operation or the operating conditions. When a major piece of process equipment like a charge pump, compressor, or fired heater shuts down, many alarms become unnecessary. These alarms are no longer independent exceptions from normal operation. They indicate, in that situation, secondary, non-critical effects and no longer provide the operator with important information. Similarly, during start-up or shutdown of a process unit, many alarms are not meaningful. This is often the case because the static alarm conditions conflict with the required operating criteria for start-up and shutdown. In all cases of major equipment failure, start-ups, and shutdowns, the operator must search alarm annunciation displays and analyse which alarms are significant. This wastes valuable time when the operator needs to make important operating decisions and take swift action. If the resultant flood of alarms becomes too great for the operator to comprehend, then the basic alarm management system has failed as a system that allows the operator to respond quickly and accurately to the alarms that require immediate action. In such cases, the operator has virtually no chance to minimise, let alone prevent, a significant loss. In short, one needs to extend the objectives of alarm management beyond the basic level. It is not sufficient to utilise multiple priority levels because priority itself is often dynamic. Likewise, alarm disabling based on unit association or suppressing audible annunciation based on priority do not provide dynamic, selective alarm annunciation. The solution must be an alarm management system that can dynamically filter the process alarms based on the current plant operation and conditions so that only the currently significant alarms are annunciated. The fundamental purpose of dynamic alarm annunciation is to alert the operator to relevant abnormal operating situations. They include situations that have a necessary or possible operator response to ensure: *Personnel and Environmental Safety, *Equipment Integrity, *Product Quality Control. The ultimate objectives are no different from the previous basic alarm annunciation management objectives. Dynamic alarm annunciation management focuses the operator's attention by eliminating extraneous alarms, providing better recognition of critical problems, and insuring swifter, more accurate operator response.Jensen, Leslie D. \\"Dynamic Alarm Management on an Ethylene Plant\\" . Retrieved 2008-05-22. The need for alarm management Alarm management is usually necessary in a process manufacturing environment that is controlled by an operator using a supervisory control system, such as a DCS, a SCADA or a programmable logic controller (PLC). Such a system may have hundreds of individual alarms that up until very recently have probably been designed with only limited consideration of other alarms in the system. Since humans can only do one thing at a time and can pay attention to a limited number of things at a time, there needs to be a way to ensure that alarms are presented at a rate that can be assimilated by a human operator, particularly when the plant is upset or in an unusual condition. Alarms also need to be capable of directing the operator's attention to the most important problem that he or she needs to act upon, using a priority to indicate degree of importance or rank, for instance. To ensure a continuous production, a seamless service, a perfect quality at any time of day or night, there must be an organisation which implies several teams of people handling, one after the other, the occurring events. This is more commonly called the on-call management. The on-call management relies on a team of one or more persons (site manager, maintenance staff) or on external organisation (guards, telesurveillance centre). To avoid having a full-time person to monitor a single process or a level, information and / or events transmission is mandatory. This information transmission will enable the on-call staff to be more mobile, more efficient and will allow it to perform other tasks at the same time. Some improvement methods The techniques for achieving rate reduction range from the extremely simple ones of reducing nuisance and low value alarms to redesigning the alarm system in a holistic way that considers the relationships among individual alarms. =Design guide= This step involves documenting the methodology or philosophy of how to design alarms. It can include things such as what to alarm, standards for alarm annunciation and text messages, how the operator will interact with the alarms. =Rationalization and Documentation= This phase is a detailed review of all alarms to document their design purpose, and to ensure that they are selected and set properly and meet the design criteria. Ideally this stage will result in a reduction of alarms, but doesn't always. =Advanced methods= The above steps will often still fail to prevent an alarm flood in an operational upset, so advanced methods such as alarm suppression under certain circumstances are then necessary. As an example, shutting down a pump will always cause a low flow alarm on the pump outlet flow, so the low flow alarm may be suppressed if the pump was shut down since it adds no value for the operator, because he or she already knows it was caused by the pump being shut down. This technique can of course get very complicated and requires considerable care in design. In the above case for instance, it can be argued that the low flow alarm does add value as it confirms to the operator that the pump has indeed stopped. Process boundaries (Boundary Management) must also be taken into account. Alarm management becomes more and more necessary as the complexity and size of manufacturing systems increases. A lot of the need for alarm management also arises because alarms can be configured on a DCS at nearly zero incremental cost, whereas in the past on physical control panel systems that consisted of individual pneumatic or electronic analogue instruments, each alarm required expenditure and control panel area, so more thought usually went into the need for an alarm. Numerous disasters such as Three Mile Island, Chernobyl accident and the Deepwater Horizon have established a clear need for alarm management. The seven steps to alarm management Step 1: Create and adopt an alarm philosophy A comprehensive design and guideline document is produced which defines a plant standard employing a best-practise alarm management methodology. Step 2: Alarm performance benchmarking Analyze the alarm system to determine its strengths and deficiencies, and effectively map out a practical solution to improve it. Step 3: ‚ÄúBad actor‚Äù alarm resolution From experience, it is known that around half of the entire alarm load usually comes from a relatively few alarms. The methods for making them work properly are documented, and can be applied with minimum effort and maximum performance improvement. Step 4: Alarm documentation and rationalisation (D&R;) A full overhaul of the alarm system to ensure that each alarm complies with the alarm philosophy and the principles of good alarm management. Step 5: Alarm system audit and enforcement DCS alarm systems are notoriously easy to change and generally lack proper security. Methods are needed to ensure that the alarm system does not drift from its rationalised state. Step 6: Real-time alarm management More advanced alarm management techniques are often needed to ensure that the alarm system properly supports, rather than hinders, the operator in all operating scenarios. These include Alarm Shelving, State-Based Alarming, and Alarm Flood Suppression technologies. Step 7: Control and maintain alarm system performance Proper management of change and longer term analysis and KPI monitoring are needed, to ensure that the gains that have been achieved from performing the steps above do not dwindle away over time. Otherwise they will; the principle of ‚Äúentropy‚Äù definitely applies to an alarm system.

The wind suddenly picked up, blowing 35 knots, and the Singapore team's dinghy with Joseph Chan and Siew Shaw Her aboard capsized. The men were thrown from the boat as it tipped over and were injured, in need of assistance. At this time, Lemieux was running the fifth of the seven total races to determine the medalists in the Finn class and was in second place in that race. Near the halfway point of his race, Lemieux spotted the Singapore shipwreck and deviated from his course to assist in rescuing Chan and Siew. After pulling them from the water, Lemieux waited for a patrol boat to take the rescued sailors back to shore. Once that happened, he rejoined the Finn heat, coming in twenty-second place. However, due to his actions, the International Yacht Racing Union decided to reinstate Lemieux's position when he went off course, rewarding him with a second-place finish in his race. Despite this, Lemieux went on to place eleventh in the class. At the medal awards ceremony, Juan Antonio Samaranch, President of the International Olympic Committee, awarded Lemieux the Pierre de Coubertin Medal for Sportsmanship. \\"By your sportsmanship, self-sacrifice and courage,\\" said Samaranch, \\"you embody all that is right with the Olympic ideal.\\" Lemieux, at the time, was only the fifth recipient of the de Coubertin Medal, and the second to receive it during a Games in which he was a competitor, following Eugenio Monti. Post-retirement Lemieux has since retired from professional sailing and is now a coach. He is currently living at Seba Beach, Alberta. Asked in a 2012 interview if he would rather be talking about the medal he might have won instead of the rescue, Lemieux referred to sailing's lack of a high media profile: \\"You spend your life working really hard internationally and you get very few accolades. So that‚Äôs the ironic thing; 25 years after this rescue, we‚Äôre still talking about it.\\" References *1988 recap on CBC *Lemieux's sportsmanship still recognized 1955 births Living people Franco-Albertan people Olympic sailors of Canada Canadian male sailors (sport) Recipients of the Pierre de Coubertin medal Sailors at the 1984 Summer Olympics ‚Äì Star Sailors at the 1988 Summer Olympics ‚Äì Finn Sailors at the 1991 Pan American Games Sportspeople from Edmonton Pan American Games medalists in sailing Pan American Games gold medalists for Canada ","title":"Lawrence Lemieux"},{"id":"963898","text":"This is a list of notable people who are from Toronto, Ontario, or have spent a large part or formative part of their career in that city.

Nutting Associates was an arcade game manufacturer based in Mountain View, California, incorporated in February 1967 by William Gilbert Nutting. In 1977 the company was purchased by William \\"Si\\" Redd and eventually absorbed into the company Sircoma.  History  Bill Nutting was working as a buyer at a San Francisco department store when his father-in-law, Revere Ware executive Herbert Ullmann, alerted him to an educational technology company called Edex Teaching Systems looking for investors. Nutting became a partner in the company, which created a coin-operated trivia game called the Knowledge Computer in 1964. Nutting marketed the machine for Edex and bought the rights to it after Edex was purchased by Raytheon in 1965. In January 1966, he founded Nutting Associates to market the Knowledge Computer and a redesigned version of the device called Computer Quiz (1967) created by Richard Ball of Marketing Services. In 1968 the model was redesigned into a solid-state version. In 1971, Nolan Bushnell sold Nutting Associates on manufacturing the game Computer Space (1971). About 1,500 units were manufactured. Afterwards, Bushnell wanted a large ownership stake in the company to continue creating games for Nutting Associates, but left after not being given that opportunity to form Atari Inc. with Ted Dabney. Nutting Associates continued manufacturing video games up until 1977 when the company was sold to \\"Si\\" Redd. A new Nutting Associates company was established in Nevada before being absorbed into the larger company Sircoma, a video poker manufacturer. Nutting's brother, Dave Nutting, also worked in the video game industry. He formed Dave Nutting Associates, a consulting firm that produced many of Midway's games during the 1970s and early 80s.

Early life Wong was born in Hong Kong in 1937. His father, a native Californian of Chinese descent, was stationed there while serving in the US Navy. His family moved back to San Francisco, California in 1953 and a few years later to San Diego. After completing high school and college, Wong served in the US Army as a Lieutenant for 2 years in West Germany. After serving, he returned to San Diego in 1962. Martial arts Wong's first encounter with Bruce Lee was in 1967, in Los Angeles, California, where Lee was giving a Kung Fu seminar. Wong had no martial arts training, and was interested in western boxing and some martial arts. He was so impressed by Lee, however, that he decided to study at Lee's kwoon, the Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute in Los Angeles. Shortly after beginning his studies, Lee accepted Wong as a private student. Wong became Lee's sparring partner and close friend. Wong was present as Lee developed Jun Fan Gung Fu into Jeet Kune Do. He was present to see Lee train other martial artists, including Karate Champion Joe Lewis and basketball star Kareem Abdul- Jabbar. Wong was one of only a few people to receive rank in the art of Jeet Kune Do by Bruce Lee. Wong never learned another martial art besides what Lee had taught him, thus he never taught anything other than what he learned . Wong gave seminars and continued to teach privately until his death. He coauthored several books about Jeet Kune Do. Some of his students included Bruce Lee‚Äôs daughter Shannon Lee. Wong was a lifetime board member of the Bruce Lee Foundation and the Jeet Kune Do Society.Lumsden (2010) p. 141 Ted Wong had a core group of long-time students whom he certified as instructors such as Lewis Luk, Albert Grajales, Bill Mattucci, Richard Torres, Mike Gittleson, and others around the world.

It is bound at its C-terminal end (a lysine) by a covalent bond to the peptidoglycan layer (specifically to diaminopimelic acid molecules) and is embedded in the outer membrane by its hydrophobic head (a cysteine with lipids attached). BLP tightly links the two layers and provides structural integrity to the outer membrane. Characteristics The gene encoding Braun's lipoprotein initially produces a protein composed of 78 amino acids, which includes a 20 amino acid signal peptide at the amino terminus. The mature protein is 6 kDa in size. Three monomers of Lpp assemble into a leucine zipper coiled-coil trimer. Large amounts of Braun's lipoprotein is present, more than any other protein in E. coli. Unlike other lipoproteins, it is linked covalently to the peptidoglycan. Lpp connects the outer membrane to the peptidoglycan. Lpp is anchored to the outer membrane by its amino-terminal lipid group. In E. coli, one third of Lpp proteins form a peptide bond via the side chain of its carboxy-terminal lysine with diaminopimelic acid in the peptidoglycan layer. The rest of the Lpp molecules are present in a \\"free\\" form unlinked to peptidoglycan. The free form is exposed on the surface of E. coli. Functions Lpp, along with another OmpA-like lipoprotein called Pal/OprL (), maintains the stability of the cell envelope by attaching the outer membrane to the cell wall. Lpp has been proposed as a virulence factor of Yersinia pestis, the cause of plague. Y. pestis needs lpp for maximum survival in macrophages and to efficiently kill mouse models of bubonic and pneumonic plague. Immunology Braun's lipoprotein binds to the pattern recognition receptor TLR2. Lpp induces adhesion of neutrophils to human endothelial cells by activating the latter.

Del Taco is led by CEO John D. Cappasola, Jr., and is headquartered in Lake Forest, California. History =1960s= The first Del Taco restaurant was opened by Ed Hackbarth and David Jameson in Yermo, California, on September 16, 1964 under the name \\"Casa Del Taco.\\" On the first day of business, Del Taco made $169. Success of the first restaurant led to two in Barstow, one in Needles, and a fifth restaurant in Corona (the first Del Taco with a drive-through window). Dick Naugle, who installed the kitchen equipment in the Corona store, was impressed by the design and joined Hackbarth and Jameson in the fledgling business. In 1966, the trio founded Red-E-Food Systems, Inc., with the idea of franchising the Del Taco brand. That same year, the original Del Taco sun logo was created. In 1967, Del Taco introduced their bean and cheese burrito with green or red sauce. =1970s= Naugle left the company early in the decade to start Naugles. In 1973, the company dropped \\"Casa\\" from its name and Red-E-Food Systems became Del Taco, Inc. By that time, the company opened a new restaurant every month. In 1976, Hackbarth and Jameson sold Del Taco to a group of investors. The new owners sold the exclusive rights to use and develop the Del Taco name throughout the US (excluding California; Eugene, Oregon; and Yuma, Arizona) to W. R. Grace and Company. Grace, primarily a chemicals company, founded a new company, Del Taco Restaurants Inc. of Dallas, Texas, and a new subsidiary, DTG Inc., to oversee the fast food chains it was acquiring. The franchise continued to expand. In 1977 there were 50 Del Taco restaurants. In 1978 there were 100. =1980s= In 1981, Del Taco had approximately 350 restaurants (located almost exclusively in California). In February 1989, Del Taco merged their restaurants with the 171 Naugles‚Äô Mexican fast food outlets. Anwar Soliman was instrumental in the move. He was the mastermind behind the purchase of the rights to expand Del Taco throughout the US in 1977. With the merger, Del Taco increased in size, and spread as far east as Hickory, North Carolina. In the 1980s Del Taco began to stay open all night. In Lake Forest, California, there are two Del Tacos directly across the street from each other on Trabuco Road. The one with the Trabuco Road address was formerly a Naugles. In Orange, two Del Tacos are across the street from each other on Tustin Avenue. The one with the Lincoln Avenue address was formerly a Naugles. =1990s= In 1990, Kevin K. Moriarty joined Del Taco as CEO, soon becoming the owner of the brand in conjunction with his management team. His team launched efforts to grow the brand's image while improving the total customer experience. In 1992, Del Taco recaptured exclusive rights to its name from W. R. Grace and Company, and was able to expand outside of California. Del Taco launched a $14-million program to redesign its restaurant exteriors, kitchens and corporate logo. The company presented its Concept 2000 restaurant design and in August 1992 introduced its new logo. In place of the orange and blue sunset, there was a yellow sun that rose over green mountains against a red background. These colors represented the primary ingredients of Del Taco food: cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes. Later that year, executives announced plans to expand the chain to 500 stores by 1995, and to add another 225 by 2000. The first new markets it sought were Las Vegas, Nevada; St. Louis, Missouri; and the Northeast Corridor. Del Taco filed for protection in 1993 under Chapter 11 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. Although renovations were made to keep Del Taco profitable, the company continued to pay rent on several unprofitable outlets that had been closed. They also attempted to negotiate lease reductions on other high cost sites. Also, Del Taco had been sued for $3 million by a former supplier. This was settled out of court. From 1994 through 1998, Del Taco shrank and then grew. Though the company signed a deal to open 15 franchise stores in the Northeast with many more in the Southeast, the chain was not near the goals publicized earlier. In 1995, Del Taco had 300 stores, instead of growing to 500 stores. The chain began to prosper in 1997, when total sales reached an estimated $250 million. By December 1998, Del Taco had 325 stores in 12 states. =2000s= By 2000, Del Taco had 372 stores located in ten US states. That year a deal was signed with the Compass Group PLC that enabled Del Taco stores to open on US military bases. The first to do business was at Patuxent River Naval Air Station in St. Mary's County, Maryland, in early 2001. Other Del Tacos were planned for US bases in Puerto Rico and Naples, Italy. In early 2001, a group of former Del Taco employees, all of whom were black, brought a discrimination suit against the chain. The group claimed that while working at Del Taco in the Los Angeles area, they had suffered verbal abuse, had been passed over for promotions in favor of Hispanic workers, and were being fired and replaced by illegal immigrants. The case had not been settled. In an effort to improve its reputation, Del Taco launched a sports-sponsorship program with teams in eight US states, including the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and Arizona Coyotes hockey teams, basketball's Los Angeles Clippers and Utah Jazz, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas‚Äôs football and basketball teams, and several minor league hockey and baseball teams. The deal placed the Del Taco logo on signs, drink cups, and special promotional items at the stadia of partner teams. It paid off as, in 2003, Del Taco announced that their restaurants had topped $1 million per store in average annual sales, which was remarkable considering that other US stores, notably McDonald's and Carl's Jr., featured a decrease in annual sales. In 2004, private Nashville, Tennessee-based Sagittarius Brands, LLC (the parent company of Captain D's Seafood) purchased Del Taco. In January 2008 Del Taco announced the opening of its 500th restaurant in Burbank, California. On April 27, 2009, a new Del Taco opened in Oviedo, Florida, marking the first time since the 1980s that Del Taco was available in the Orlando area. This location has since closed. There are two other Orlando locations still open. =2010s= The Del Taco in Denton, Texas, which opened in 2010 and closed five years later. Del Taco returned to Texas with a new location in Denton, Texas. W. R. Grace and Company had previously owned and operated locations in Texas with a licensing agreement in 1978, but sold the restaurants to Taco Bell in 1992. Guillermo Perales, one of the largest Hispanic restaurateurs in the nation, signed a franchisee agreement in 2011 to open additional locations in the Dallas-Fort Worth area of Texas. In March 2012, a location opened in Houston with plans for further expansion in the Houston area (that location was defunct by May 2015), including both Harris County and Montgomery County. In December 2012, a Del Taco opened in Cedar Park, Texas. In 2013, another opened in Round Rock, Texas. In December 2013, Del Taco entered Oklahoma, opening its first store in Moore. In the summer of 2014 they opened a second store in Edmond. Del Taco was purchased by Levy Acquisition Corporation and became a public company on June 30, 2015. Demographics The chain operates in 15 states, and has 580 locations as of January 1, 2019. The majority of their restaurants are in California, Oregon and Washington. Del Taco also operates in other western states (including Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Michigan, Texas, and Utah), and has locations sprinkled around areas east of the Mississippi. Las Vegas, Nevada has the most Del Tacos of any single city, and California has the most Del Tacos of any state. Products Del Taco's standard menu includes Hard Shell Tacos, Soft Tacos, Burritos, Quesadillas, Nachos, Deluxe Taco Salad, Crinkle Cut French Fries, Chili Cheddar Fries, Double Del Cheeseburger, Bacon Del Cheeseburger, Triple Del Cheeseburger, Fries, Shakes, and at least four types of Dinner Burritos. On April 25, 2019, Del Taco introduced plant-based Beyond Tacos nationwide in partnership with Beyond Meat. Since this introduction, Del Taco has created multiple other vegetarian and vegan menu items using Beyond Meat's plant-based crumbles including the Beyond Avocado Taco, the Epic Beyond Cali Burrito, and the Beyond 8 Layer Burrito. On January 29, 2020, Del Taco launched a new dollar menu, with items costing a dollar or less before tax. Marketing The first mascot of Del Taco was a character of the same name used from 1999 through 2000. Del Taco was sued by Zorro Productions, Inc. and Tristar Pictures, Inc., who claimed that the \\"Del Taco\\" character ‚Äì masked and costumed in black ‚Äì infringed on their rights to the trademark Zorro figure. Del Taco settled the suit in January 2000, agreeing to make changes to the Del Taco character, and soon discontinued the ad campaign. From 2000 through early 2006, Del Taco used Gregg Binkley to play \\"Dan\\" in commercials. A clumsy spokesman, Dan was known for antics during commercials. Dan destroyed cars, broke hockey-rink glass, and held a sales event at a nude beach, while promoting a specific item for Del Taco. From August 2007 through July 2008, Del Taco featured \\"The Beast\\" in their commercials. \\"The Beast\\", a personification of hunger, typically stood next to a customer and persuaded him to order a particular item (or items) so that they could \\"Feed the Beast\\" (Del Taco's slogan). \\"The Beast\\" made his debut in August 2007 promoting Del Taco's improved Chicken Soft Taco. He also endorsed the Crispy Fish Taco in February 2008, the improved Chicken Quesadilla in April 2008, and Del's Deal in June 2008. Del Taco has used a variety of commercials to promote the slogan, \\"Go Bold or Go Home.\\" The first commercial featured a team of miniature \\"Mole Men\\" to promote the Spicy Chicken Mole Soft Taco, which aired in August 2008. Ads included Del Taco's promotion of their improved regular taco in September 2008, the Classic Combo Deal in November 2008, three separate meal deals for under three dollars in January 2009, the crispy shrimp taco in February 2009, the chicken soft taco in April 2009, and the chicken fajita burrito in June 2009. On June 27, 2018, Del Taco launched a campaign celebrating employees' successes while working at their restaurants using the new slogan, \\"Celebrating the hardest working hands in fast food,\\" although the \\"That's unfreshing believable\\" slogan to promote their fresh food is still used.The Hardest Working Hands in Fast Food Get a Break for Del Taco from adweek.com Popular Culture On the Netflix show Grace and Frankie, the Frankie character, played by Lily Tomlin, regularly mentions her love of Del Taco throughout the series.

Construction Hopkins was launched by Harlan & Hollingsworth Company, Wilmington, Delaware, on 24 April 1902, and sponsored by Alice Gould Hawes, a great-great-granddaughter of Esek Hopkins. The ship was commissioned at Philadelphia Navy Yard on 23 September 1903, with Lieutenant Montgomery M. Taylor in command. Pre-World War I Hopkins sailed from Philadelphia on 12 May 1904, and joined the Fleet at Norfolk. That summer the destroyer deployed with the Coast Squadron for the midshipmen at sea training. During the following three years she ranged into the Caribbean Sea, exercising with the Flotilla, engaging in torpedo practice, and Fleet problems. In September 1906, Hopkins was present for the Presidential Review off Oyster Bay. On 29 September, she and escorted the President in to Cape Cod Bay to witness record target practice. In 1907-1908, Hopkins - as part of the Torpedo Flotilla - accompanied the Atlantic Fleet on a practice cruise to the Pacific. They sailed from Hampton Roads on 2 December 1907, exchanging courtesies at various Mexican and South American ports en route. After target practice in Magdelena Bay, the Flotilla arrived at San Francisco on 6 May 1908, in time for the review of the combined Atlantic and Pacific Fleets by the Secretary of the Navy. On 1 June of that year, Hopkins joined the Pacific Torpedo Fleet for tactics along the West Coast, at sea training north to Alaskan waters, and south to the coast of Mexico. On 14 February 1910, Hopkins suffered a boiler accident. Two sailors, Chief Watertender Robert Earl Bonney and Watertender Edward Alvin Clary, were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions during the incident. World War I On 30 April 1917, after the United States entry into World War I, Hopkins departed San Diego for the Panama Canal Zone. She performed patrol duty, convoyed submarines and assisted them in torpedo proving. On 3 August, she arrived at Hampton Roads, for escort and patrol ranging along the coast to Bermuda. Hopkins entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 29 January 1919, and decommissioned there 20 June. She was sold for scrapping on 7 September 1920 to the Denton Shore Lumber Company.

They are known for their heavy, and slow sound, which blends diverse genres including drone, black metal, dark ambient and noise rock, as well as for their loud live performances. The band's core members are Stephen O'Malley (also of Khanate and Burning Witch) and Greg Anderson (of Goatsnake and Engine Kid). History Sunn O))) is named after the Sunn amplifier brand, the logo of which includes a circle next to the \\"SUNN\\" banner with waves heading off to the right. In interviews, Stephen O'Malley stated that the band's moniker was also chosen as a play on the name Earth, a band widely regarded as pioneers of drone metal throughout the 1990s. Before the band members moved to Los Angeles, they briefly used the moniker Mars. The band's style is characterized by slow tempos, distorted guitars, lack of rhythm and melody, and alternative tunings. The guitars are notable for their low register, frequently utilizing tunings as low as dropped A. Additionally, the band is known for using resonant feedback to create monolithic soundscapes and eerie atmospheres. Percussion is rarely incorporated, with a lack of any discernible beat. When performing live, the band wears robes, fills the air with fog, and plays at a high volume. The band releases the majority of its music through the label it founded in 1998, Southern Lord Records. However, the band initially released √ò√ò Void (its second album) on multiple labels, including Rise Above Records, Hydra Head Records, and Dirter Productions (which pressed it as a double album on vinyl). Additionally, the original pressing of The Grimmrobe Demos was released by Hydra Head Records. It was later issued as a double picture record set by Outlaw Recordings and finally reissued by Southern Lord in 2004. The logo the band uses is also that of the Sunn amplifier brand. In 2008, Sunn O))) released a live album titled D√∏mkirke and also announced a mini-tour consisting of four concerts to commemorate the group's 10th anniversary, which coincided with the release of The Grimmrobe Demos. On December 17, 2009, the song \\"Hunting & Gathering (Cydonia)\\" from the CD Monoliths & Dimensions was named the Heaviest Song of All-Time by Jason Ellis on The Jason Ellis Show on Sirius/XM. Greg Anderson then appeared on The Jason Ellis Show on January 12, 2010. Hungarian-born Attila Csihar (Mayhem) has performed live with the band their primary vocalist since 2003. Sunn O))) released a collaboration album with Ulver titled Terrestrials in February 2014: in October 2014, the band released the album Soused, a collaboration with singer-songwriter Scott Walker. In November 2015, Sunn O))) presented a four-day program at Le Guess Who? Festival in Utrecht, the Netherlands, including Annette Peacock, Magma, Julia Holter and The Crazy World of Arthur Brown, and Sunn O))) itself. The band worked with producer Steve Albini on two albums, Life Metal and Pyroclasts. Musical style Sunn O))) experiments with a variety of styles and sounds, progressing beyond the primarily guitar and bass style of The Grimmrobe Demos and √ò√ò Void. On White1 and White2, the band noticeably expanded on conceptualization by inviting several guests, resulting in everything from quiet meditative ambient sounds (\\"A Shaving of the Horn that Speared You\\" from White1) to a bizarre bass experiment track (\\"bassAliens\\" from White2). Black One continued in this direction, utilizing far more electronics, synthesizers, and other instrumentation than earlier Sunn O))) material, yet still marking a significant return to their traditional sound. Sunn O))) on stage at the Ritz in Manchester, June 11, 2012 Sunn O))) are widely regarded as leaders in the genre, including by The New York Times Magazine of May 28, 2006, when the band was written up in an article called \\"Heady Metal\\" by John Wray. The band was praised in an issue of Wonka Vision, an independent music magazine, as one of the greatest modern metal acts. Sunn O))) also appeared in the August 2007 issue of Q magazine (the \\"loud issue\\"), with its album White1 being named the 18th-loudest album of all time, just above AC/DCs Back in Black and below Jimi Hendrix's Are You Experienced?

The Combat Engineering Corps beret's color is silver and its symbol features a sword on a defensive tower with an explosion halo on the background. The Combat Engineering Corps mottos are \\"Always First\\" (◊®◊ê◊©◊ï◊†◊ô◊ù ◊™◊û◊ô◊ì Rishonim Tamid) and the unofficial \\"The hard, we shall do today; the impossible, we shall do tomorrow\\". Its roles include mobility assurance, road breaching, defense and fortifications, counter- mobility of enemy forces, construction and destruction under fire, sabotage, explosives, bomb disposal, counter-weapons of mass destruction (NBC) and special engineering missions. In addition to Combat Engineering Corps sappers, each infantry brigade has an engineering company trained with basic engineering and explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) skills (called ◊§◊ú◊ó\\"◊î◊ü). Combat Engineering Corps sappers and heavy equipment operators are often attached to other units (such as armored or infantry brigades) in order to help them breach through obstacles and handle explosive threats.  Roles  Beside extensive training in basic combat engineering, combat engineers receive specialized training in their respective professions. These are: * Sapper: trained with all the basic engineering skills and also trained at high infantry level (◊®◊ï◊ë◊ê◊ô 07). Their main role is to breach through terrain obstacles (natural and artificial), breach through minefields and enable ground forces to advance in the battlefield. They are trained to supply close combat support for both armored fighting vehicles and infantry. Some of them are trained in driving the Combat Engineering Corps standard CEV: the IDF Puma. They professional ranks after advanced training are Rifleman 07 (◊®◊ï◊ë◊ê◊ô 07) and Sapper 06 (◊§◊ú◊° 06). IDF Caterpillar D9 * Engineering Vehicles Operator (EVO): less combatant but nonetheless important, these soldiers are skilled in the operation of heavy mechanical equipment and engineering vehicles such as heavy bulldozers, excavators, cranes, tractors and mine-breaching devices. EVO units are called ◊¶◊û\\"◊î (Tzama) in Hebrew, acronym of Tziyud Mechani Handasi (Mechanical Engineering Equipment). They professional ranks are Rifleman 05 (◊®◊ï◊ë◊ê◊ô 05) and EVO Operator 07 (◊û◊§◊¢◊ô◊ú ◊¶◊û\\"◊î 07).  Bulldozer Operators: belong to the EVO, these soldiers are operating the IDF Caterpillar D9 armored bulldozers, including under heavy fire. Their roles are versatile and differ according to the units to which they are attached. The D9 operators perform construction, destruction, breaching and EOD missions while assisting tanks, infantry and even special forces during battle. * NBC Disposal: called \\"purifiers\\", they are expert in handling nuclear, biological and chemical threats. * EOD experts: the EOD are experts in nondestructive detonation of explosives and bomb disposal. Among their equipment are the Barrett M82A1 and remote-control EOD robots with shotguns and mechanical arms. The EOD are the military equivalent of the police's bomb squad. In the IDF, they are a part of the elite Engineering unit Yahalom. * Demolition experts: they are specially trained in blowing up targets in the most accurate and effective way. They explode targets ranging from cellular phones and doorlocks up to tanks and large buildings. In the IDF, the demolition experts are united in Sayeret Yael of Yahalom (Sayeret is the Hebrew term for a SF elite unit) and therefore gain high infantry training as well. * Fortification experts: assigned to designing and overseeing the construction of bases, outposts, bridges and fortifications. Construction itself is usually done by the EVOs. * Counter- Tunnels experts: established in 2003 by the late Captain Aviv Hakani, these Combat Engineering Corps soldiers are experts in finding smuggling tunnels and weapon caches, and demolishing them. They operated in Rafah during the al-Aqsa Intifada and received recommendation of honor for their activity. After 2004 APC incident the Rafah tunnel team was united with the Combat Engineering Corps elite unit Yahalom and was renamed Sayeret Samur (\\"Samur\\" means \\"Weasel\\" in Hebrew).

Their issued rifle is the M-16A1 (short 13/14-inch barrel) and M4 Carbine. Other weapons include hand grenades, M203 grenade launcher, IMI Negev, FN MAG and M2 Browning machineguns and M24 SWS and Barret M82A1 sniper rifles. = Vehicles = IDF Puma IDF Nammer CEV The combat engineering soldiers are mobilized by APCs and armored 4√ó4 vehicles. The Armoured personnel carriers include the Centurion tank-based IDF Puma, a heavy combat engineering vehicle equipped with engineering devices such as mine plows. Reserve forces use the old and versatile M113 APC. In 2016 the 603rd Combat Engineering Battalion (\\"Lahav\\") started to receive IDF Namer Combat engineering vehicle based on the Namer APC. Wheeled armored vehicles include the HMMWV (\\"Hummer\\"), Wolf Armoured Vehicle and M240 Sufa. = Heavy equipment = The Combat Engineering Corps operates heavy equipment and engineering vehicles (called TZAMA in Hebrew) such as armored bulldozers, armored excavators, armored wheeled loaders, armored backhoe loaders and more. The best known tool is the heavily armored IDF Caterpillar D9 bulldozer. = Mine breaching devices = The Combat Engineering Corps has different means to breach fast through mine fields. These include personal sapper gear, vehicle- mounted mine plows and mine rollers which can be attached to engineering vehicles and tanks, CARPET air-fuel rockets and the \\"Tzefa Shiryon\\" (Hebrew for \\"Armor's Viper\\") which is extremely powerful and can clear large mine fields. = Explosives = The Combat Engineering Corps has a wide range of explosives, demolition charges and different land mines. = Robots = Yahalom SF Unit operates many types of robots, including bomb disposal robots, reconnaissance robots and remote-controlled heavy equipment (such as \\"Raam HaShachar\\" D9N bulldozer, and the \\"Front-Runner\\" mini-cat loader). = NBC = Counter-NBC soldiers are equipped with protective suits and gas masks, chemical ID systems and purification vehicles. = Gallery = File:IDF-D9-bulldozer-66-IndependenceDay-1.jpgIDF Caterpillar D9.

File:Tagash001.jpgArmoured vehicle-launched bridge.  History  = Founding = The Combat Engineering Corps has a record of professional achievement and decoration. Its best known operation is the bridging of the Suez Canal during the Yom Kippur War. The corps was formed from the sabotage unit of the Palmach and the tractor operators units of the 1947‚Äì1949 Palestine war. In its early years, the Combat Engineering Corps drew its soldiers mainly from Jews who had served in the United Kingdom's Royal Engineers. ICEC chief engineer, Brigadier General David Leskov (not to be confused with Chief Engineering Officer ◊ß◊¶◊ô◊ü ◊î◊†◊ì◊°◊î ◊®◊ê◊©◊ô, the commander of the ICEC), developed many combat engineering systems for the Israel Defense Forces, and won three Israel Security Prizes. He served in the IDF until his death at the age of 86, thus being the oldest soldier in the world. = In Israel's wars = In the 1947‚Äì1949 Palestine war, the Combat Engineering Corps blasted bridges over the Jordan River and the streams of the southern Coastal plain in order to stop the advance of the Arab armored forces into the Israeli civilian rear. The Combat Engineering Corps also helped in breaching the \\"Burma Road\\" into besieged Jerusalem. \\"Road of Heroism\\" memorial for the fallen soldiers of the Israeli Engineering Corps, near Hulda forest, at the Burma Road, Israel In the 1956 Sinai war, the Combat Engineering Corps destroyed Egyptian military infrastructure in the Sinai Peninsula and was awarded with a battalion recommendation of honor. In the 1967 Six-Day War the Combat Engineering Corps stormed Jordanian fortifications along the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem. After Israel annexed the Old City, the Combat Engineering Corps removed landmines planted in the city by the Jordanians. This was the first war in which Caterpillar D9 bulldozers were employed by the corps. After the war, the Combat Engineering Corps helped to build a fortification line of defense along the Suez Canal and were awarded the Israel Security Prize in 1969. The Israeli Engineering Corps were the first corps to win the award. In the 1973 Yom Kippur War the combat engineering battalions attached to Ariel Sharon's armored division bridged the Suez Canal during \\"Operation Knights of Heart\\", while carrying tanks and paratroopers across the canal with Gillois amphibious tank-carriers. This effort enabled Sharon and Avraham \\"Bren\\" Adan's armored divisions to cross the canal and surround the 3rd Egyptian Army, forcing it to surrender. The bridging of the canal is regarded by many as the turning point of the war on the southern front. On the northern front, a Combat Engineering Corps Caterpillar D9 bulldozer was the first ever motorized vehicle to reach the summit of the Hermon. In Operation Peace for Galilee the Combat Engineering Corps worked intensively to open routes for Israeli forces. Their duties also included the disarming landmines and Improvised explosive devices as well as building fortifications and outposts. In the 1991 Gulf War, the NBC purifiers of the Combat Engineering Corps were on a \\"code red\\" alert for disarming Iraqi Scud missiles, armed with non-conventional warheads. = The October 2000 Lebanon abduction = \\"Timsach\\" (crocodile) Gillois amphibious tank-carrier On 7 October 2000 three Israeli combat engineering soldiers were abducted by Hezbollah from the Shebaa Farms, in the Golan Heights. The soldiers, Beni Avraham, Adi Avitan and Omar Sawaed, suffered fatal injuries during their abduction. Their bodies were retrieved in 2004 in a prisoner swap with Hezbollah. A series of accusations were made against the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) by press and partisan web sites for having cooperated with the abduction. Those accusations stem from a video, whose existence was originally denied by UN officials, recorded by Indian peacekeepers one day after the abduction. The video, which the UN agreed to provide to Israeli officials in June 2001 with civilian faces blurred, showed abandoned vehicles with fake UN license plates and uniforms, and Hezbollah supporters intercepting UN efforts to retrieve the vehicles. A UN investigation found no evidence to support accusations of peacekeepers involvement in the abduction. Although the bereaved families met with Kofi Annan, they refused to accept the UN version. On September 2004, the bereaved families announced their intention to sue the UN, Hezbollah, Iran, Syria and Lebanon for their parts in the abduction. = The Second Intifada = For further discussions see: al-Aqsa Intifada, IDF Caterpillar D9, Operation Defensive Shield, Battle of Jenin 2002, Operation Rainbow. IDF D9L, which won the Battle of Jenin 2002 during Operation Defensive Shield. The armored Caterpillar D9 bulldozers were cited by military experts as a key factor in keeping IDF casualties low. During the al-Aqsa Intifada, which erupted in September 2000, the Combat Engineering Corps were employed to disarm many Palestinian IED explosive charges and booby traps. In many cases, the Combat Engineering EOD operators, together with Israeli Police bomb disposal operators, also detonated explosive belts captured on Palestinian suicide bombers. The Combat Engineering Corps also dynamited Palestinian houses, bomb labs and smuggling tunnels. However, the Combat Engineering Corps were most known for operating the armored IDF Caterpillar D9 armored bulldozers, which are cited by many Israelis and military experts as a key factor in keeping IDF casualties low and successfully fighting terrorism. On the other side, for Palestinians, the bulldozers became a nightmare, as they bulldozed many Palestinian buildings and shrubbery, and were almost impervious to Palestinian attacks. The Combat Engineering Corps bulldozers' operators unit received a recommendation of honor for its activity in Jenin during Operation Defensive Shield. Armored bulldozers were also massively employed in Rafah to counter terrorist smuggling tunnels. Human Rights Watch published a reporthttps://www.hrw.org/campaigns/gaza criticizing the extensive destruction of Palestinian houses in the southern Gaza strip, and said it was unlawful, claiming that Israel uses the Palestinian smuggling tunnels as a pretext to create a \\"buffer zone\\" along the Gaza-Egypt border. In Rafah, the Combat Engineering Corps formed a special unit, designated for searching and destroying smuggling tunnels, it is called SAMUR and now belongs to Yaalom. They also received an honor of recommendation, for their conduct. Until the Gaza Disengagement plan, the Combat Engineering 603 battalion's reconnaissance platoon (◊û◊ó◊°\\"◊®) held a record of over 70 terrorists killed in 2004‚Äì2005 on the border between the Gaza Strip and Israel. They received a recommendation of honor for this achievement. = Second Lebanon War = The Combat Engineering Corps took significant part in the Second Lebanon War that erupted in 2006 after Hizbullah attacked IDF patrol, abducted two soldiers and killed another 8 with anti-tank missiles and improvised explosive devices that hit the rescuers. On 16 July combat engineering forces from Asaf battalion were the first to enter Lebanon. Their mission was to clear improvised explosive devices, open safe routes to ground forces and demolish Hizbullah infrastructures. Yahalombomb disposal experts and IDF Caterpillar D9 bulldozers cleared most of Hizbullah's IEDs. During the war, a D9 went over a 500 kg belly charge improvised explosive devices but survived without taking significant damage. During the war, combat engineers used bulldozers and explosives to destroy Hezbollah outposts, bunkers, warehouses and HQs‚Äîmainly along the border. The works intensified as the war reached near end, and indeed the borderline was cleared in time. Combat engineers also rescued damaged tanks, often under fire. Two combat engineers were awarded with Medal of Distinguished Service and other two awarded a recommendation of honor from the General Chief of Staff. Many other awarded with recommendation of honor from less senior commanders. = Operation Cast Lead = Combat Engineer in training During the Gaza War (2008‚Äì2009) codenamed \\"Operation Cast Lead\\" by the IDF, combat engineering forces were the first to enter the Gaza Strip to clear IEDs, booby traps and open safe routes to armor and infantry. Many booby traps, rigged structures and tunnels were present in the Gaza Strip as part of Hamas efforts to prepare to the Gaza War. These were often concealed in civilian structures, and were even found in schools and mosques. However, most of the Palestinian booby traps were successfully countered by the IDF Combat Engineering Corps bomb disposal experts (part of Yahalom Special Engineering Unit) which dismentaled the bombs and armored D9 bulldozers which detonated bombs and booby traps while sustaining no damage from the explosions. IDF Caterpillar D9R and unmanned \\"Raam HaShachar\\" D9N armored bulldozers which opened route in dangerous areas have taken many improvised explosive devices, landmines, explosive charges and RPG hits, but no crewmen were killed. However, a Yahalom bomb disposal expert was killed after entering a house and encountering a suicide bomber. He was the only fatality of the Combat Engineering Corps during the war. Armored IDF Caterpillar D9 bulldozers and armored Bagger E-349 excavator, parked during Operation Protective Edge. Besides neutralizing Hamas IEDs and traps, combat engineering forces demolished Hamas infrastructure and other structures used as outposts, shooting positions, traps, cover for tunnels, HQs and warehouses. The head officer of the Combat Engineering Corps (◊ß◊î◊†\\"◊®) estimated that about 600 buildings were bulldozed or exploded by his troops. The Combat Engineering Corps' success heightened their reputation within the IDF and in the Israeli public. This was manifested in increased number of conscripts who chose the Combat Engineering Corps as their first priority in their draft preferation questionnaire (\\"Manila ◊û◊†◊ô◊ú◊î\\"‚Äîa form in which the conscript chooses in what unit he would like to serve, the IDF tries to fulfill his request as much as possible). = Operation Protective Edge = Combat engineer looking at a Hamas infiltration tunnel exposed by the IDF during Operation Protective Edge. During Operation Protective Edge (July‚ÄìAugust 2014) Combat Engineers played a major role in destroying Hamas' cross-border underground infiltration tunnels. The tunnels were exposed and cleared by armored bulldozers and excavators, and then detonated by Yahalom's Samoor unit. In total, about 32 tunnels were destroyed. In addition, combat engineers participated in the battles, neutralized Hamas-planted improvised explosive devices, cleared booby-traps, opened routes for armor and infantry, and destroyed terrorist infrastructure. Six combat engineers were killed during the battles in the Gaza Strip. = Operation Northern Shield = In late 2018 the IDF commenced Operation Northern Shield to detect, located and destroy Hezbollah tunnels dug into northern Israel from South Lebanon. The combat engineering corps played the major role in the operation, operating on ground and below it, deploying Yahalom tunnel warfare teams and heavy equipment. As for 12 January 2019, the IDF discovered 6 tunnels.

In music, an invention is a short composition (usually for a keyboard instrument) in two-part counterpoint. (Compositions in the same style as an invention but using three-part counterpoint are known as sinfonias. Some modern publishers call them \\"three-part inventions\\" to avoid confusion with symphonies.) Well-known examples are the fifteen inventions that make up the first half of Johann Sebastian Bach's Inventions and Sinfonias. Inventions are usually not performed in public, but serve as exercises for keyboard students, and as pedagogical exercises for composition students. Form Inventions are similar in style to a fugue, though they are much simpler. They consist of a short exposition, a longer development, and, sometimes, a short recapitulation. The key difference is that inventions do not generally contain an answer to the subject in the dominant key, whereas the fugue does. Two-part and three-part inventions are in contrapuntal style. =Exposition= In the exposition, a short motif is introduced by one voice in the tonic key. This is also known as the theme. The subject is then repeated in the second voice in the tonic key while the initial voice either plays a countersubject or plays in free counterpoint. =Development= The development comprises the bulk of the piece. Here the composer develops the subject by writing variations either melodically or harmonically. This usually involves the alternation of episodes with statements of the theme, similar to the development of a fugue. In minor- and major-mode inventions, the theme is typically restated in the relative major and the dominant, respectively. New key areas are reached through episodes, which usually move sequentially through the circle of fifths. The final episode ends on a half cadence in the original key, and is often exaggerated to make the subject sound extra special when it returns. David Fuentes, \\"Figuring out Melody\\" Many of Bach‚Äòs Inventions follow this plan, including BWV 775 and BWV 782. =Recapitulation= If an invention does have any recapitulation at all, it tends to be extremely short‚Äîsometimes only two or four measures. The composer repeats the theme in the upper voice and the piece ends. The repetition of the theme contains very little variation (or no variation at all) on the original theme. The lower line usually plays the countersubject, and if there is no countersubject, plays in free counterpoint. History The invention is primarily a work of Johann Sebastian Bach. Inventions originated from contrapuntal improvisations in Italy, especially from the form of the composer Francesco Antonio Bonporti. Bach adapted and modified the form to what is considered to be a formal invention. Bach wrote 15 inventions (BWV 772‚Äì786) as exercises for his son, Wilhelm Friedemann Bach. Bach later wrote a set of 15 three-part inventions, called sinfonias (BWV 787‚Äì801).

Fireplaces are used for the relaxing ambiance they create and for heating a room. Modern fireplaces vary in heat efficiency, depending on the design. Historically they were used for heating a dwelling, cooking, and heating water for laundry and domestic uses. A fire is contained in a firebox or firepit; a chimney or other flue allows exhaust to escape. A fireplace may have the following: a foundation, a hearth, a firebox, a mantelpiece; a chimney crane (used in kitchen and laundry fireplaces), a grate, a lintel, a lintel bar, home overmantel, a damper, a smoke chamber, a throat, a flue, and a chimney filter or afterburner.Chimney filters can save billions On the exterior there is often a corbelled brick crown, in which the projecting courses of brick act as a drip course to keep rainwater from running down the exterior walls. A cap, hood, or shroud serves to keep rainwater out of the exterior of the chimney; rain in the chimney is a much greater problem in chimneys lined with impervious flue tiles or metal liners than with the traditional masonry chimney, which soaks up all but the most violent rain. Some chimneys have a spark arrestor incorporated into the crown or cap. Organizations like the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the Washington Department of Ecology warn that, according to various studies, fireplaces can pose a significant health risk. The EPA writes \\"Smoke may smell good, but it's not good for you.\\" Types of fireplaces * Manufactured fireplaces are made with sheet metal or glass fire boxes. * Electric fireplaces can be built-in replacements for wood or gas or retrofit with log inserts or electric fireboxes. * A few types are, wall mounted electric fireplaces, electric fireplace stoves, electric mantel fireplaces and fixed or free standing electric fireplaces. Masonry and prefabricated fireplaces can be fueled by: *Wood fuel or firewood and other biomass *Charcoal (carbonized biomass) *Coal of various grades *Coke (carbonized coal) *Smokeless fuel of several types *Flammable gases: propane, butane, and methane (natural gas is mostly methane, liquefied petroleum gas mostly propane) *Ethanol (a liquid alcohol, also sold in gels) File:Traditional Himalayan Tandoor.jpgTraditional Himalayan Tandoor File:Fireplace Burning.jpgWood-burning fireplace with fire dogs File:NT Typical gas log fireplace (5114230942).jpgA gas-powered fireplace File:Electric_Fireplace.jpgElectric fireplace Fireplace (Serbia).jpgTraditional Serbian Ognji≈°te Ventless fireplaces (duct free/room-venting fireplaces) are fueled by either gel, liquid propane, bottled gas or natural gas. In the United States, some states and local counties have laws restricting these types of fireplaces. They must be properly sized to the area to be heated. There are also air quality control issues due to the amount of moisture they release into the room air, and oxygen sensor and carbon monoxide sensors are safety essentials. Direct vent fireplaces are fueled by either liquid propane or natural gas. They are completely sealed from the area that is heated, and vent all exhaust gasses to the exterior of the structure. Chimney and flue types: * Masonry (brick or stone fireplaces and chimneys) with or without tile-lined flue. * Reinforced concrete chimneys. Fundamental design flaws bankrupted the US manufacturers and made the design obsolete. These chimneys often show vertical cracks on the exterior. * Metal-lined flue: Double- or triple-walled metal pipe running up inside a new or existing wood-framed or masonry chase. Newly constructed flues may feature a chase cover, a cap, and a spark arrestor at the top to keep small animals out and to prevent sparks from being broadcast into the atmosphere. All fireplaces require trained gas service members to carry out installations. =Accessories= A wide range of accessories are used with fireplaces, which range between countries, regions, and historical periods. For the interior, common in recent Western cultures include grates, fireguards, log boxes, andirons and pellet baskets, all of which cradle fuel and accelerate burning. A grate (or fire grate) is a frame, usually of iron bars, to retain fuel for a fire. Heavy metal firebacks are sometimes used to capture and re-radiate heat, to protect the back of the fireplace, and as decoration. Fenders are low metal frames set in front of the fireplace to contain embers, soot and ash. For fireplace tending, tools include pokers, bellows, tongs, shovels, brushes and tool stands. Other wider accessories can include log baskets, companion sets, coal buckets, cabinet accessories and more. History Cooking over a fireplace Ancient fire pits were sometimes built in the ground, within caves, or in the center of a hut or dwelling. Evidence of prehistoric, man-made fires exists on all five inhabited continents. The disadvantage of early indoor fire pits was that they produced toxic and/or irritating smoke inside the dwelling. Fire pits developed into raised hearths in buildings, but venting smoke depended on open windows or holes in roofs. The medieval great hall typically had a centrally located hearth, where an open fire burned with the smoke rising to the vent in the roof. Louvers were developed during the Middle Ages to allow the roof vents to be covered so rain and snow would not enter. Also during the Middle Ages, smoke canopies were invented to prevent smoke from spreading through a room and vent it out through a wall or roof. These could be placed against stone walls, instead of taking up the middle of the room, and this allowed smaller rooms to be heated. Chimneys were invented in northern Europe in the 11th or 12th centuries and largely fixed the problem of fumes, more reliably venting smoke outside. They made it possible to give the fireplace a draft, and also made it possible to put fireplaces in multiple rooms in buildings conveniently. They did not come into general use immediately, however, as they were expensive to build and maintain. In 1678, Prince Rupert, nephew of Charles I, raised the grate of the fireplace, improving the airflow and venting system. The 18th century saw two important developments in the history of fireplaces. Benjamin Franklin developed a convection chamber for the fireplace that greatly improved the efficiency of fireplaces and wood stoves. He also improved the airflow by pulling air from a basement and venting out a longer area at the top. In the later 18th century, Count Rumford designed a fireplace with a tall, shallow firebox that was better at drawing the smoke up and out of the building. The shallow design also improved greatly the amount of radiant heat projected into the room. Rumford's design is the foundation for modern fireplaces. The Aesthetic movement of the 1870s and 1880s took on a more traditional spectra based on stone and deflected unnecessary ornamentation. Rather it relied on simple designs with little unnecessary ornamentation. In the 1890s the Aesthetic movement gave way to the Arts and Crafts movement, where the emphasis was still placed on providing quality stone. Stone fireplaces at this time were a symbol of prosperity, which to some degree is still the notion today. =Evolution of fireplace design= Victorian style \\"sitting room\\" with a fireplace in the Sherlock Holmes Museum, London Over time, the purpose of fireplaces has changed from one of necessity to one of visual interest. Early ones were more fire pits than modern fireplaces. They were used for warmth on cold days and nights, as well as for cooking. They also served as a gathering place within the home. These fire pits were usually centered within a room, allowing more people to gather around it. Many flaws were found in early fireplace designs. Along with the Industrial Revolution, came large-scale housing developments, necessitating a standardization of fireplaces. The most renowned fireplace designers of this time were the Adam Brothers. They perfected a style of fireplace design that was used for generations. It was smaller, more brightly lit, with an emphasis on the quality of the materials used in their construction, instead of their size. By the 1800s most new fireplaces were made up of two parts, the surround and the insert. The surround consisted of the mantelpiece and side supports, usually in wood, marble or granite. The insert was where the fire burned, and was constructed of cast iron often backed with decorative tiles. As well as providing heat, the fireplaces of the Victorian era were thought to add a cosy ambiance to homes.

Art Nouveau decor by Mikhail Vrubel, 1899 Heating efficiency Fireplace with tubular grate heater, with a high surface area in its heat exchanger and a lift out ash tray to simplify cleanup Some fireplace units incorporate a blower, which transfers more of the fireplace's heat to the air via convection, resulting in a more evenly heated space and a lower heating load. Fireplace efficiency can also be increased with the use of a Fireplace fireback, a piece of metal that sits behind the fire and reflects heat back into the room. Firebacks are traditionally made from cast iron, but are also made from stainless steel. Efficiency is a complicated concept though with open hearth fireplaces. Most efficiency tests consider just the effect of heating of the air. An open fireplace is not, and never was, intended to heat the air. A fireplace with a fireback is a radiant heater, and has done so since the 15th century. The best way to gauge the output of a fireplace is if you notice you're turning the thermostat up or down. Most older fireplaces have a relatively low efficiency rating. Standard, modern, wood-burning masonry fireplaces though have an efficiency rating of at least 80% (legal minimum requirement for example in Salzburg, Austria). To improve efficiency, fireplaces can also be modified by inserting special heavy fireboxes designed to burn much cleaner and can reach efficiencies as high as 80% in heating the air. These modified fireplaces are often equipped with a large fire window, enabling an efficient heating process in two phases. During the first phase the initial heat is provided through a large glass window while the fire is burning. During this time the structure, built of refractory bricks, absorbs the heat. This heat is then evenly radiated for many hours during the second phase. Masonry fireplaces without a glass fire window only provide heat radiated from its surface. Depending on outside temperatures 1 to 2 daily firings are sufficient to ensure a constant room temperature. Health effects =Wood= A literature review published in the Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health concludes that there are a wide variety of health risks posed by residential wood combustion. It states: The Washington Department of Ecology also published a booklet explaining why wood smoke can be dangerous. It explains that human lung and respiratory systems are unable to filter particles emitted by wood combustion, which penetrate deeply into the lungs. For months, cancer-causing chemicals can continue to cause changes and structural damage within the respiratory system. Young children, seniors, pregnant women, smokers and individuals with respiratory disorders are most vulnerable. Wood smoke can cause disease and even death in children because it is associated with lower respiratory tract infections. Home fireplaces have caused fatal carbon monoxide poisoning. =Gases and ethanol= Propane, butane, and methane are all flammable gases used in fireplaces (natural gas is mostly methane, liquefied petroleum gas mostly propane). If they are allowed to accumulate unburned, gases can cause suffocation by displacing air, and gas explosions. Ethanol (a liquid, also sold in gels) fires can also cause severe burns. Burning hydrocarbons can cause indoor air pollution. Emissions include airborne particulate matter (such as black carbon) and gases like nitrogen oxides. These harm health: they weaken the immune system, and increase infections, blood pressure, cardiovascular deaths, and insulin resistance. Some forms of fuel are more harmful than others. Burning hydrocarbon fuels incompletely can produce carbon monoxide, which is highly poisonous and can cause death and long-term neurological problems.  Environmental effects  Burning any hydrocarbon fuel releases carbon dioxide and water vapour. Other emissions, such as nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides, can be harmful to the environment.

It was discovered by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille on June 16, 1752 while observing from what today is South Africa. Starting in 1754, Charles Messier made several attempts to find this object from Paris, France, but the low declination meant it never rose sufficiently far above the horizon to allow for easy observation. He finally observed and catalogued it in 1778. The cluster can be seen with a pair of 50 mm binoculars, although resolving the individual stars requires a medium-sized telescope. M55 is at a distance of about 17,600 light-years away from Earth. It has a mass of about 269,000 times that of the Sun. As with other Milky Way globular clusters, it has a low abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium compared to the Sun‚Äîwhat astronomers term the metallicity of the cluster. This quantity is normally listed as the base‚Äì10 logarithm of the proportion relative to the Sun; for NGC 6809 the metallicity is given by: [Fe/H] = ‚Äì1.94 dex. Taking this exponent to the powers of 10 yields an abundance equal to 1.1% of the proportion of such elements in the Sun. Only about 55 variable stars have been discovered in the central part of M55.

A Republican, he represented New York's 20th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives from January 1999 to January 2007. He was dubbed \\"Congressman Kick-Ass\\" by President George W. Bush for his take-no-prisoners style. Before being defeated for reelection in November 2006 by Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand, he was considered a strong candidate for statewide office. Early life and education Sweeney was born in Troy, New York and graduated from Lansingburgh High School in 1973. He received an associate degree from Hudson Valley Community College in 1978 and a bachelor's degree in Political Science and Criminal Justice from the Sage College of Albany in 1981. In 1991, he received a J.D. from Western New England College School of Law. After the Bush-Gore 2000 re-count in Florida, in which Sweeney played a legendary role, Toby Eglund wrote: \\"Sweeney ... embodies that embarrassment of the Left: the rightward drift of America's white working class males. The son of a shirt factory worker active in the Amalgamated Shirt Cutters Union, and a sometime resident of a housing project, Sweeney grew up in the old, gritty industrial city of Troy, New York. He put himself through law school, and toiled as a minor county bureaucrat until, one day, he was discovered by Republican State Chairman William Powers who made him executive director of the New York state GOP in 1992.\\" \\"The Guy Who Gored Al: The irresistible ascension of John E. Sweeney,\\" Toby Eglund, theGully.com Political career =Early career and New York Republican Party executive director= Sweeney was \\"Rensselaer County's one-time STOP-DWI coordinator.\\" He was the Executive Director & Chief Counsel of the New York Republican Party from 1992 to 1995, a period of tremendous success for the state GOP. During Sweeney's tenure at state Republican headquarters, Rudy Giuliani was elected mayor of New York City (the first Republican to win the mayor's office in 28 years) and George Pataki was elected governor (the first Republican to win the Governor's Mansion in 20 years) and Republicans made gains in both houses of the state legislature and at the local level. Sweeney was Governor Pataki's first Commissioner of the State Department of Labor, from 1995 to 1997, then he moved to Governor Pataki's inner-circle staff as Deputy Secretary to the Governor, from 1997 until he resigned to run for Congress. =State Secretary of Labor under Pataki administration= As Governor George Pataki's Commissioner of Labor, Sweeney was the point-man on successful efforts to reform the Empire State's Workers' Compensation laws. Before the reforms, enacted in 1996, New York's workers' comp system had long been considered one of the most costly in the nation‚Äî57 percent higher than the national average, 53 percent higher than neighboring Massachusetts, 59 percent than neighboring Connecticut and 85 percent higher than neighboring New Jersey.Dan Lonkevich, \\"N.Y.

H. Solomon who was retiring.Joseph Crowley, \\"New Faces in the Congress\\", New York Times, November 4, 1998 Sweeney was born, raised and lived most of his life in Solomon's Congressional District. Solomon endorsed and campaigned for Sweeney, as did every Republican elected official and organization in the district. Sweeney was elected to the US House in 1998, winning with 55 percent of the vote over Democratic challenger Jean Bordewich,Jonathan P. Hicks, \\"New York's Congressional Freshmen Are New to the House, but Not to Politics\\", New York Times, November 7, 1998 despite the fact that President Bill Clinton carried the district over U.S. Senator Bob Dole in 1996 by a 46 percent to 41 percent margin.\\"The Guy Who Gored Al: The irresistible ascension of John E. Sweeney,\\" Toby Eglund, The Gully Re-elections In 2000, Sweeney defeated Democrat Kenneth McCallion, receiving 68 percent of the vote. In 2002, he defeated Frank Stoppenbach, getting 73 percent of the vote. In 2004, he defeated Doris F. Kelly, receiving 66 percent of the vote. Tenure and political positions Sweeney generally, but not invariably, supported the positions of his fellow Republicans in the House.Greg Giroux, Party Loyalty Often Sacrificed by At-risk House Incumbents, New York Times (September 27, 2006). Sweeney opposed same-sex marriage (asserting that \\"a handful of activist judges have decided to undermine the will of the people\\"), and in 2004 called for a federal constitutional amendment to ban recognition of same- sex marriage.Raymond Hernandez, Call to Ban Gay Marriage Is Dividing Republicans, New York Times (February 28, 2004). Sweeney subsequently voted against such a constitutional amendment. Sweeney enjoyed a measure of support from organized labor. He received the endorsement of the Civil Service Employees Union and enjoyed good relations with the Teamsters. He opposed NAFTA, and in 2006 was one of 28 House Republicans to vote against the Oman‚ÄìUnited States Free Trade Agreement, although he voted for CAFTA. He supported the George W. Bush administration's position on the Iraq War, which was a focus of criticism from his opponent, Kirsten Gillibrand, in the 2006 race.David Staba, Race Profile: The 20th District in New York, New York Times (2006). Sweeney opposed gun control.Diane Cardwell, Mayor Gives Scorn to Guns, and Money to Their Allies, New York Times (May 14, 2006). He voted for prayer in public schools on numerous occasions and the National Education Association gives him an 18% approval rating. After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack, Sweeney and U.S. Representative James T. Walsh were two Republicans who cross party-lines to vote with Democrats on an effort in the House of Representatives to send $20 billion in emergency federal aid to New York City (the measure failed in the Appropriations Committee by a 33-31 vote).NY gets more aid from Congress, United Press International, (November 17, 2001).Edward Wyatt, David W. Chen, Charles Bagli and Raymond Hernandez, After 9/11, Parcels of Money, and Dismay, New York Times (December 30, 2002). Although an ally of President George W. Bush, he called for the resignation of Bush's Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff over proposed cuts in New York's share in homeland security funding. In 1999 and 2001, Sweeney introduced legislation (the \\"Anti-Drug Legalization Act\\") that would ban all federal funding for research pertaining to drug legalization; the legislation did not advance. He voted against the Rohrabacher‚ÄìFarr amendment. Before being elected to Congress, Sweeney was considered a moderate Republican who favored abortion rights;Matthew J. Rosenberg, THE 1998 ELECTIONS: AROUND THE REGION; New Faces In the Congress, New York Times (November 4, 1998). by 2000, he was considered a strong abortion opponent, with a 90% anti-abortion record. He voted in favor of legislation that would make it a federal crime to transport minors across state lines for an abortion and thus circumvent state \\"parental consent\\" laws. =2006 re-election campaign loss= In August 2006, Sweeney's allies filed successfully against signatures on Libertarian opponent Eric Sundwall's ballot petitions, resulting in Sundwall's name being removed from the general election ballot. However, Sweeney still lost the general election on November 7, 2006, to Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand with 47% of the vote. =Political activity after leaving congress= Recently, Sweeney returned to the political process both locally and nationally as an election and compliance lawyer and strategist. In 2012, Sweeney worked during for Newt Gingrich's unsuccessful campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. In 2016, Sweeney was hired in April 2016 by Donald Trump's campaign to help organize New York during the primary and do compliance work. After Trump's election day victory, Sweeney, as the campaign's deputy counsel, led the effort on the ground in Wisconsin and Michigan to protect the campaign's advantage in those two key swing states during the recounts initiated by Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, and supported by Hillary Clinton's campaign. In December 2016, Sweeney joined the executive committee of Trump's transition team. Sweeney was later promoted to a four-member \\"Tiger Team\\" for Trump, tasked with conducting interviews with potential nominees for ambassadorships and other high-level positions in various federal departments and agencies.http://www.timesunion.com/tuplus-local/article/Ex-Congressman- Sweeney-of-Clifton-Park-vets- Trump-10852089.phphttp://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/271566/trump- advisor-sweeney-is-happy-to-be-home/ Controversies =Role in Florida recount in 2000= During the 2000 election, Sweeney allegedly helped earn his nickname from President Bush, \\"Congressman Kick-Ass,\\" by organizing the so- called Brooks Brothers riot that disrupted the Florida elections commissioners.Robert Parry, \\"Bush's Conspiracy to Riot\\", Consortium for Independent Journalism, August 5, 2002 He was said to have led the charge on the third recount in Miami, flying in GOP operatives and instructing them to \\"shut it down!\\" by raising a clamor and pounding on the election commission's doors.Michael Tomasky, \\"Pol Versus Pole\\" , New York Magazine, March 19, 2001 Sweeney used the words \\"thugs\\" to describe the Florida officials involved in the recount. He defended his actions in connection with the incident as \\"completely and absolutely legitimate\\" and declared that his intent was only to stop the canvassing board from withdrawing its activities from public view.Timothy Noah, \\"Sweeney and the Siege of Miami\\", Slate Magazine, November 28, 2000 Former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie, in his book Winning Right, wrote that the night before the recount began in Miami- Dade County, Sweeney was one of about a dozen Bush campaign operatives who gathered at Joe's Stone Crab in South Beach, that set out the campaign's media strategy. Gillespie recalled that Sweeney said, 'I know what I'm going to say tomorrow morning. 'I'm going to say that Joseph Stalin said, 'It doesn't matter who casts the votes, it only matters who counts the votes.' And these people are worse than Stalin.' He ended up holding the Stalin quotation until the 5:30 pm wrap-up.\\"Ed Gillespie, \\"Winning Right,\\" pp. 101-102 =Congressional ethics controversies= In September 2006, the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) included Sweeney on its annual list of \\"The 20 Most Corrupt Members of Congress,\\" citing ethical concerns arising from a \\"ski trip to New York, the exchange of legislative assistance for campaign contributions and the hiring of his wife as a campaign fundraiser.\\"CREW summary of ethics issues of Sweeney , September 2006 Wife as fundraiser On April 11, 2003, Sweeney began paying a company called Creative Consulting for fund-raising. The company had been founded a day earlier by Gaia \\"Gayle\\" Ford. Between April 2003 and December 2003, Sweeney's campaign paid $42,570 to the firm. Sweeney proposed to Ford in September 2003 Newsday, September 18, 2003 and married her in 2004. Sweeney spokeswoman Melissa Carlson said the congressman considers his wife \\"his best representative in the district when he's fund-raising.\\" She said Ford, who had no previous fund-raising experience, receives a 10 percent commission on whatever she raises. Between January 2005 and April 2006, Ford was paid $30,879. Sweeney also has had a fundraising consultant on monthly retainer since June 2004, who is paid $8,583 a month. Ford also works for Powers & Company, the lobbying firm of former state GOP Chairman William Powers, Sweeney's longtime political ally and onetime boss.Elizabeth Benjamin, \\"For politicians, family ties can include payroll: Sweeney's wife is among the ranks of relatives on legislators' staffs\\", Albany Times-Union, May 8, 2005 Publicly funded ski trips The Winter Challenge was started in 1998 by Sweeney's House predecessor, Gerald Solomon, with the declared purpose of showcasing the Olympic facilities at Lake Placid, New York to congressmen and their staffers in hopes of getting federal funds; Sweeney has hosted the annual event since 1999. In January 2006, Sweeney, his wife, and about 60 other people spent a four-day weekend at the facilities, competing against each other in skating, downhill skiing and bobsledding events. The group included Representative Pete Sessions (R-TX), a close friend of Sweeney\\"Judy Holland, On the Hill, the sound of silence: John Sweeney, still reeling from re-election loss to Kirsten Gillibrand, fails to show for votes\\" , Albany Times-Union, December 10, 2006 and his wife; and aides to U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton (D-NY), Senator Harry Reid (D-NV), Representative Randy Kuhl (R-NY), and Representative Bart Stupak (D-MI). The weekend cost the Olympic Regional Development Authority (ORDA) $27,500, plus in-kind services it provided and the costs of operating the Olympic venues for the competition (exact figures for the latter two were unavailable). ORDA is a part of the New York State government. In the fall of 2005, the House ethics panel told Sweeney in a letter that he should be careful to let the Olympics groups invite guests to avoid the appearance of an endorsement by the House. \\"Once the ORDA and the U.S. Olympic Committee ‚Äî without your involvement ‚Äî have issued an initial invitation to House members and staff to take part in the trip, you may send a follow-up to that invitation\\", the ethics panel, known formally as the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, wrote to Sweeney. Invitations to the event officially come from ORDA and the U.S. Olympic Committee, a nonprofit group chartered by Congress. ORDA says the impetus for the event comes from the U.S. Olympic Committee. The U.S. Olympic Committee said it's really Sweeney's event. Three committees of the NY State Assembly have launched investigations of the Challenge, focusing on whether public money was put to good use. ORDA President Ted Blazer, speaking at one such hearing, said Sweeney's office helped assemble lists of possible invitees to the event. Documents show that at least eight members of Congress, all Republicans, were also invited to attend the 2006 event but declined. The official invitation for the event read: \\"While this trip has proven itself to be an enjoyable one for delegation members in the past, it is, nevertheless, an official trip authorized by the House and Senate Ethics Committees . . . intended to provide an opportunity for Members of Congress and Congressional staff to inspect and evaluate the manner in which federal funds have been used to strengthen the area's tourism industry.\\" Despite the House ethics rule requiring all travel paid by others to relate to members' official duties, and the ethics panel's letter that said that recreational activities must be \\"merely incidental to the trip\\", Sweeney has said that the panel said \\"it's perfectly appropriate for me to promote the event.\\" The group attending the event included at least 15 registered lobbyists, including Pete Card, a former staffer of Sweeney's and the brother of former White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card, and Lisi Kaufman, a lobbyist for United Technologies Corporation, the sister of Andrew and Pete. In his request to the House ethics committee, Sweeney did not ask about lobbyists. A spokesman for ORDA said he does not know why the lobbyists were invited. Seven of the lobbyists had contributed a total of $12,400 to Sweeney's campaign in 2005. Ties to Allen Stanford Sweeney was part of a group of lawmakers known as the Caribbean Caucus, sponsored by disgraced financier Allen Stanford. The group, formed to promote relations with Caribbean nations, took 11 trips to places like St. Croix, Montego Bay and Key Biscayne. The meetings, which included receptions with lobster, caviar and wine, cost $311,307 and were paid for by the Inter-American Economic Council, a non-profit funded by Stanford. Other members of the Caucus included convicted influence peddler Rep. Bob Ney and close Sweeney friend Rep. Pete Sessions. In 2004, Stanford hosted a wedding reception for Sweeney and wife at the Pavilion Restaurant, owned by Stanford. At the time, Sweeney told the Antigua Sun \\"If it wasn't for Allen, I certainly would not be here today.\\" =Disputed domestic violence report= On October 31, 2006, the Albany Times Union reported on a 9-1-1 call made by Sweeney's wife in December 2005, in which she complained that her husband had been \\"'knocking her around' during a late-night argument at the couple's home.\\" The responding officers filed a domestic incident report, which states that Sweeney allegedly grabbed his wife \\"by the neck\\" and pushed her around the house. John and Gaia Sweeney subsequently said they would give the New York State Police permission to release a report about the incident. They said that the report was inaccurate but have not disputed its contents. On November 17, 2006, the Times Union reported that there were two versions of the domestic violence report that had been prepared by the State Police, one that was sent to them, doctored and lacking details, and the original report. On July 22, 2007, the Albany Times Union reported that Gaia Sweeney, who was contesting a divorce action by her husband, said that he was often verbally abusive and at times physically abused her during their marriage. She also said that a statement she made on the eve of last fall's election, denying marital abuse, was \\"coerced\\". Sweeney denied that he had been abusive; he had recently obtained a judicial order of protection against his wife. Sweeney's first wife, Betty Sweeney, of Schaghticoke, told the Times-Union that she had \\"never observed any kind of behavior like that towards me or anybody else.\\" The State Police moved to demote a State Police captain weeks after the November 2006 election, alleging that he had leaked the police report on Sweeney.\\"Police Captain Demoted for Leaking Sweeney Report,\\" News Channel 10 ABC, November 16, 2006, http://news10.com/2006/11/16/police-captain-demoted-for-leaking-sweeney- report/ The captain denied leaking the report, saying he was wrongly accused, and the captain was supported by the New York State Police Benevolent Association (PBA),Don Lehman, Union: Captain is the scapegoat in Sweeney probe, Post Star (November 17, 2006). who called the captain a scapegoat. The officer was ultimately not demoted, but was transferred to a different role that resulted in lower pay. =Alcohol issues= Attendance at college fraternity party In April 2006, news outlets reported that Sweeney had attended a party at Union College's Alpha Delta Phi house in Schenectady; photographs surfaced of the congressman at the party, and the student newspaper Concordiensis cited witnesses stating that he was visibly intoxicated. Democrats ridiculed Sweeney over the embarrassing photos; Sweeney said through a spokeswoman that he had briefly spoken to students and posed for photos before departing, and that he was not drinking during the event. DWI convictions in 2007 and 2009 Sweeney was charged with aggravated DWI when he was arrested by New York State Police at 1:19 a.m. on November 11, 2007, on the Adirondack Northway, a stretch of Interstate 87. Sweeney's car had reportedly been swerving and a 24-year-old woman was seated partially on his lap when spotted by a state trooper.Robert Gavin, \\"Source: Sweeney passenger a shock: Arresting State Police officers in DWI case surprised to find a woman on ex-congressman's lap\\", Albany Times Union, November 14, 2007 Sweeney's blood alcohol content registered at .18 percent, more than double the legal limit. Sweeney issued an apology, and on November 14, 2007, Sweeney he guilty to drunk driving after his attorney vocally and publicly denied he had even been drinking that evening. Sweeney paid a US$1,000 fine, but avoided jail time.

Cobb (March 5, 1931 ‚Äì March 18, 2019) was an American aviator. She was also part of the \\"Mercury 13\\", a group of women who underwent physiological screening tests at the same time as the original Mercury Seven astronauts. She was the first to complete each of the tests.  Early life  Born on March 5, 1931, in Norman, Oklahoma,Hargrave, The Pioneers Monash University, Australia Accessed March 12, 2010 Cobb was the daughter of Lt. Col. William H. Cobb and Helena Butler Stone Cobb. From birth, Cobb was on the move as is the case for many children of military families. Weeks after being born Cobb's family moved to Washington, D.C., where her grandfather, Ulysses Stevens Stone, was serving in the United States House of Representatives. After Ulysses Stone lost a reelection bid, the family moved back to Oklahoma where he and Cobb's father worked as automobile salesmen. Once the United States became involved in World War II Cobb's family moved once again, this time to Wichita Falls, Texas where Cobb's father joined his active U.S. National Guard unit. The family would move again to Denver, Colorado before finally returning to Oklahoma after World War II where Cobb spent the majority of her childhood. As a child growing up in Oklahoma, Cobb took to aviation at an early age, with her pilot father's encouragement. Cobb first flew in an aircraft at age twelve, in her father's open cockpit 1936 Waco biplane.Jerrie Cobb \\"Jerrie Cobb, Solo Pilot\\" (Autobiography) jerrie-cobb.org-Solo Pilot, Accessed March 12, 2010 At 16, she was barnstorming around the Great Plains in a Piper J-3 Cub, dropping leaflets over little towns announcing the arrival of circuses. Sleeping under the Cub's wing at night, she helped scrape together money for fuel to practice her flying by giving rides. By the age of 17, while a student at Oklahoma City Classen High School, Cobb had earned her private pilot's license. She received her commercial pilots license a year later. In 1948, Cobb attended Oklahoma College for Women for a year.  Record-setting career  She gained her Private Pilot's license at the age of 17, her Commercial Pilot's license on her 18th birthday. Facing sex discrimination and the return of many qualified male pilots after World War II, she had to take on less sought after jobs, such as patrolling pipelines and crop dusting. She went on to earn her Multi-Engine, Instrument, Flight Instructor, and Ground Instructor ratings as well as her Airline Transport license. At 21, she was delivering military fighters and four-engine bombers to foreign Air Forces worldwide. Cobb went on to set new world records for speed, distance, and absolute altitude while still in her twenties. When she became the first woman to fly in the Paris Air Show, the world's largest air exposition, her fellow airmen named her Pilot of the Year and awarded her the Amelia Earhart Gold Medal of Achievement. Life Magazine named her one of the nine women of the \\"100 most important young people in the United States\\".Internet Encyclopedia of Science, Aviation Pioneers Accessed March 12, 2010John Shepler \\"Astronaut Jerrie Cobb, The Mercury 13 Were NASA's First Women Astronauts\\" johnshepler.com Accessed March 12, 2010 To save the money to buy a surplus World War II Fairchild PT-23, and a chance to be self-employed, Cobb played women's softball on a semi-professional team, the Oklahoma City Queens. By 1959 (age 28), Cobb was a pilot and manager for Aero Design and Engineering Company, which also made the Aero Commander aircraft she used in her record making feats, and was one of the few women executives in aviation. By 1960, she had 7,000 hours of flying time and held 3 world aviation records: the 1959 world record for nonstop long-distance flight, the 1959 world light-plane speed record, and a 1960 world altitude record for lightweight aircraft of . In November 1960, following multiple crashes of the Lockheed L-188 Electra, American Airlines' marketing department identified that the aircraft's reputation was particularly poor among women, significantly impacting passenger bookings. At the time, American Airlines, had no female pilots. In an attempt to win over passengers, they invited Cobb to fly the aircraft on a highly publicized four-hour test. It was her first turboprop flight. In May 1961, NASA Administrator James Webb appointed Cobb as a consultant to the NASA space program. Jerrie Cobb operating the Multi-Axis Space Test Inertia Facility (MASTIF) located at the Lewis Research Center in Ohio. This test simulated bringing a spinning spacecraft under control and was one of many that the women of the Mercury 13 went through in order to qualify for space flight.  Medical testing  Although Cobb successfully completed all three stages of physical and psychological evaluation that were used in choosing the first seven Mercury astronauts, this was not an official NASA program, and she was unable to rally support in Congress for adding women to the astronaut program based solely on their gender. At the time, Cobb had flown 64 types of propeller aircraft, but had made only one flight, in the back seat, of a jet fighter. She had also set world records for speed, distance, and absolute altitude. > \\"Although she never flew in space, Cobb, along with twenty-four other women, > underwent physical tests similar to those taken by the Mercury astronauts > with the belief that she might become an astronaut trainee. All the women > who participated in the program, known as First Lady Astronaut Trainees, > were skilled pilots. Dr. Randy Lovelace, a NASA scientist who had conducted > the official Mercury program physicals, administered the tests at his > private clinic without official NASA sanction. Cobb passed all the training > exercises, ranking in the top 2% of all astronaut candidates of both > genders.\\" In 1962, Cobb was called to testify before a Congressional hearing, the Special Subcommittee on the Selection of Astronauts, about women astronauts.Qualifications for Astronauts: Hearings before the Special Subcommittee on the Selection of Astronauts , U.S. House of Representatives, 87th Cong. (1962) Astronaut John Glenn stated at the hearing \\"men go off and fight the wars and fly the airplanes\\", and \\"the fact that women are not in this field is a fact of our social order\\". Only a few months later, the Soviet Union would send the first woman into space, Valentina Tereshkova. Soon afterward, Tereshkova ridiculed Cobb for her religious beliefs but sympathized with the sexism she encountered: > ‚ÄúThey (American leaders) shout at every turn about their democracy and at > the same time they announce they will not let a woman into space. This is > open inequality.‚Äù Cobb lobbied, along with other Mercury 13 participants, including Jane Briggs Hart, to be allowed to train alongside the men. However, at the time NASA requirements for entry into the astronaut program were that a pilot be a military test pilot, experienced at high speed military test flying, and have an engineering background enabling the pilot to take over controls in the event it became necessary. Since all military test pilots were men at the time, this had the effect of automatically excluding women. An exception was not made for Cobb.Tanya Lee Stone. \\"Almost Astronauts: 13 Women Who Dared to Dream\\". Candlewick Press Somerville, MA, 2009 p. 64. Liz Carpenter, who was the Executive Assistant to Vice President Lyndon Johnson, drafted a letter to NASA administrator James E. Webb questioning these requirements, but Johnson did not send the letter, instead writing across it: \\"Let's stop this now!\\"Stephanie Nolen. \\"Promised the Moon: The untold story of the first women in the space race\\". Penguin Books Canada, Toronto, 2002. p. 300.  Later life and death  Cobb then began over 30 years of missionary work in South America, performing humanitarian flying (e.g., transporting supplies to indigenous tribes), as well as surveying new air routes to remote areas. Cobb \\"pioneered new air routes across the hazardous Andes Mountains and Amazon rain forests, using self-drawn maps that guided her over uncharted territory larger than the United States\\". It was because of Cobb that many once isolated South American inhabitants started receiving much needed supplies and medicines. The new routes she discovered helped better the lives of countless individuals. Cobb has been honored by the Brazilian, Colombian, Ecuadorian, French, and Peruvian governments. In 1981, she was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for her humanitarian work. In 1999, the National Organization for Women conducted an unsuccessful campaign to send Cobb to space to investigate the effects of aging, as John Glenn had been. John Glenn's main purpose on his space flight was to observe the effects of a micro-gravity environment on the body of an aged individual. Specifically, NASA wanted to observe whether the effects of weightlessness had positive consequences on the balance, metabolism, blood flow, and other bodily functions of an elderly person. Cobb believed that it was necessary to also send an aged woman on a space flight in order to determine whether the same effects witnessed on men would be witnessed on women. At 67, Cobb who had been deprived of a space flight years before, and who had passed the same tests as John Glenn, believed herself to be a great candidate for this scientific observation. Cobb petitioned NASA for the chance to participate in a space flight on behalf of research on elderly women but was denied. NASA stated \\"it had no plans to involve additional senior citizens in upcoming launches\\". Many aviators and astronauts of the time believed this was a failed chance for NASA to right a wrong they had made years before. Cobb never reached her ultimate goal of space flight, but paved the way for women after her who did. Cobb received numerous aviation honors, including the Harmon Trophy and the F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale's Gold Wings Award. On March 18, 2019, thirteen days after her 88th birthday, Cobb died at her home in Florida. In popular culture The character of Molly Cobb in the 2019 TV series For All Mankind is based on her, and episode four of the first season, entitled \\"Prime Crew\\", is dedicated to her memory. Laurel Ollstein's play They Promised Her the Moon tells the story of Jerrie Cobb and her struggle to become an astronaut.

It was discovered by Charles Messier on January 19, 1779. The cluster is located almost midway along an imaginary line between Albireo (Œ≤ Cygni) and Sulafat (Œ≥ Lyrae). It is a challenge to find with large (50‚Äì80 mm) binoculars, appearing as a slightly fuzzy star. The cluster can be resolved using a telescope with an aperture of or larger. M56 is at a distance of about 32,900 light-years from Earth and measures roughly 84 light-years across, with a combined mass some 230,000 times that of the Sun. It is about from the Galactic Center and above the galactic plane. This cluster has an estimated age of 13.70 billion years and is following a retrograde orbit through the Milky Way. The properties of this cluster suggest that it may have been acquired during the merger of a dwarf galaxy, of which Omega Centauri forms the surviving nucleus. For Messier 56, the abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium, what astronomers term the metallicity, has a very low value of [Fe/H] = ‚Äì2.00 dex. This is equivalent to 1% of the abundance in the Sun. The brightest stars in M56 are of 13th magnitude, while it contains only about a dozen known variable stars, such as V6 (RV Tauri star; period: 90 days) or V1 (Cepheid: 1.510 days); other variable stars are V2 (irregular) and V3 (semiregular). In 2000, a diffuse X-ray emission was tentatively identified coming from the vicinity of the cluster. This is most likely interstellar medium that has been heated by the passage of the cluster through the galactic halo. The relative velocity of the cluster is about 177 km s‚àí1, which is sufficient to heat the medium in its wake to a temperature of 940,000 K. M56 is part of the Gaia Sausage, the hypothesised remains of a merged dwarf galaxy.

It was discovered by Charles Messier on April 15, 1779 and is one of four barred spiral galaxies that appear in Messier's catalogue.The other barred spiral galaxies in Messier's catalogue are Messier 91, Messier 95 and Messier 109 M58 is one of the brightest galaxies in the Virgo Cluster. From 1779 it was arguably (though unknown at that time) the farthest known astronomical object until the release of the New General Catalogue in the 1880s and even more so the publishing of redshift values in the 1920s. Early observations Charles Messier discovered Messier 58, along with the elliptical galaxies Messier 59 and Messier 60, on April 15, 1779. M58 was reported on the chart of the Comet of 1779 as it was almost on the same parallel as the star Epsilon Virginis. Messier described M58 as a very faint nebula in Virgo which would disappear in the slightest amount of light he used to illuminate the micrometer wires. This description was later contradicted by John Herschel's observations in 1833 where he described it as a very bright galaxy, especially towards the middle. Herschel's observations were also similar to the descriptions of both John Dreyer and William Henry Smyth who said that M58 was a bright galaxy, mottled, irregularly round and very much brighter toward the middle. Characteristics Like many other spiral galaxies of the Virgo Cluster (e.g. Messier 90), Messier 58 is an anemic galaxy with low star formation activity concentrated within the galaxy's optical disk, and relatively little neutral hydrogen, also located inside its disk, concentrated in clumps, compared with other galaxies of similar morphological type. This deficiency of gas is believed to be caused by interactions with Virgo's intracluster medium. Messier 58 has a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus, where a starburst may be present as well as a supermassive black hole with a mass of around 70 million solar masses. It is also one of the very few galaxies known to possess a UCNR (ultra-compact nuclear ring), a series of star-forming regions located in a very small ring around the center of the galaxy. This led to its being dubbed the \\"ring bearer galaxy\\" by the popular astronomy YouTube program \\"Deep Sky videos\\". Supernovae Two supernovae have been studied in the M58 galaxy. A type II supernova dubbed as SN 1988A was discovered by Kaoru Ikeya, Robert Evans, Christian Pollas and Shingo Horiguchi on January 18, 1988. It had an apparent magnitude of 13.5 and was located 40 arcseconds south of its center. A Type I supernova dubbed as SN 1989M was then found on June 28, 1989 by Kimeridze. This one had an apparent magnitude of 12.2 and was located 33 arcseconds north and 44 arcseconds west of its nucleus. Hubble view Messier 58 (aka NGC4579) imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope.

He was a half-brother to Cornplanter, a Seneca war chief. Handsome Lake, a leader and prophet, played a major role in reviving traditional religion among the Haudenosaunee (People of the Longhouse), or Six Nations Iroquois Confederacy. He preached a message that combined traditional Haudenosaunee religious beliefs with a revised code meant to revive traditional consciousness to the Haudenosaunee after a long period of cultural disintegration following colonization. This message was eventually published as the \\"Code of Handsome Lake\\" and is still practiced today.

Very little is known of his parents; his mother, Gahonnoneh, later had an affair with a Dutch fur trader and gunsmith, resulting in the birth of Handsome Lake's half-brother, Cornplanter. Handsome Lake was born into the Turtle clan of his mother, as the Iroquois have a matrilineal kinship system. He was eventually adopted and raised by the Wolf clan people. Born during a time when the Seneca nation was at its peak of prosperity through fur trading, Handsome Lake witnessed the gradual deterioration of his society. Other well- known relatives in Handsome Lake's family included Governor Blacksnake, Red Jacket and Half-Town. Career In 1794 he signed the U.S. treaty with the Six Nations (known as the Pickering Treaty). He visited Washington, D.C., with Cornplanter in 1802. =Tribe= Several factors contributed to the erosion of morale and spiritual welfare of the Iroquois/Haudenosaunee. At its peak in the early 18th century, the Haudenosaunee controlled much of what is now the midwestern United States, which it had conquered through decades of warring against the tribes native to those areas in the Beaver Wars. After the American Revolution, the Haudenosaunee lost most of their land in New York and Pennsylvania and were forced to live on reservations, including in Canada, as punishment for taking the side of the British Crown in the revolution. Although these reservations included much of the prime real estate in Western New York, including several of the prominent creek and river valleys, the small and fragmented native lands were separated by wide swaths of land that was eventually earmarked for American settlement in what would be known as the Holland Purchase. This dislocation followed years of social disruption due to epidemics of infectious disease and major wars. Alcohol was introduced to the tribes in this time frame, a substance to which numerous Haudenosaunee (including Handsome Lake himself) began consuming in excess, exacerbating the erosion of the traditional family unit. This situation was a result of the cultural clash between the fledgling United States and the once equally powerful Six Nations people. The traditional religious rituals were no longer applicable to the environment in which the Haudenosaunee people found themselves. Brings a Message of Gaihwiyo (\\"Good Word\\") In 1799, after a period of illness due to many years of excessive alcoholism, Handsome Lake had the visions that gave him the power to become a prophet. In his vision, he was warned by three spiritual messengers who presented him with ideals that he must enforce among his people. They told him of concerns he must enforce, like learning the English language and preservation of their land. Shortly after Handsome Lake's first vision, he ceased drinking alcohol. When he regained his health, he began bringing a message of Gaiwiio (the \\"Good Word\\") to his people. He preached against drunkenness and other evil practices. His message outlined a moral code that was eventually referred to as the Code of Handsome Lake. Today it is called the Longhouse Religion. Handsome Lake abolished societal sins, attempting to cleanse the tribes of all immoral actions. He threatened his people in order to show them the error of their ways. He insisted that Iroquois people must refrain from drinking, marital abuse, abortion, spouse and child abandonment, selling of land, overconsumption, factory farms, and witchcraft. The rise of Handsome Lake's religion was more successful than most religions during that time because his code combined traditional Iroquois religion with Quaker values. Despite the clear presence of Christian values in his teachings, it is unclear how much contact with Christianity Handsome Lake had previous to his visions. His religion stressed survival without the sacrifice of the Iroquois identity, and recognized the need to make adjustments in order to survive in their changing world. Handsome Lake's ideals were eye opening and majority of people agreed with him. Those who opposed the code had reasons to believe that Handsome Lake was giving up on their old ways by altering the character of their religion. They saw Handsome Lake's new ideals as abandoning their history and forfeiting to Quaker ideals because Handsome Lake did not believe that they could survive with the world evolving around them. The Code of Handsome Lake was one of the most successful uprisings during the time. His Code combined traditional Iroquois religious values with Christian values, and then-President Thomas Jefferson gave his endorsement to Handsome Lake's code in 1803. To Brother Handsome Lake With the help of Handsome Lake‚Äôs relatives, his visions were written down and published in 1850. The Code of Handsome Lake remains practiced among the Seneca and is considered to be a traditional Indian religion. Beginning in the 1820s, it became traditional for the Code to be recited every September at Tonawanda in the Seneca Nation. A Tale Of How America Was Discovered How America Was Discovered is a story told by Handsome Lake, and documented by Arthur C. Parker, about a young minister who meets the one he perceives to be the Lord, who then asks him to go to a new land and bring with him cards, money, a fiddle, whiskey, and blood corruption. In return the young minister will become rich. The young minister sought out Christopher Columbus, and with the help of his crew, traveled to the Americas. They turned back to report what they had seen, which caused an immigration of people from Europe to the Americas. Along with the people came the five things that aided in destroying the natives. The end reveals that the \\"Lord\\" in the gold castle was actually the devil, and that even he knew what he had caused was wrong.

M59 is a member of the Virgo Cluster, with the nearest component being separated from M59 by and around 5 magnitudes fainter. The nearest cluster member of comparable brightness is the lenticular galaxy NGC 4638, which is around away. Messier 59 and the nearby elliptical galaxy Messier 60 were both discovered by Johann Gottfried Koehler in April 1779 during observations of a comet in the same part of the sky. Charles Messier listed both in the Messier Catalogue about three days after Koehler's discovery. This is an elliptical galaxy of type E5 with a position angle of 163.3¬∞, indicating the overall shape shows a flattening of 50%. However, isophotes for this galaxy deviate from a perfect ellipticity, showing pointed shapes instead. These can be decomposed mathematically into a three component model, with each part having a different eccentricity. The main elliptical component appears to be superimposed upon a flatter, disk-like feature, with the entirety embedded within a circular halo. The luminosity contribution of the components is 62% for the pure elliptical part, 22% for the halo, and the remainder coming from the disk. The light ratio of the disk to the main elliptical body is 0.25, whereas it is typically closer to 0.5 in a lenticular galaxy. The core contains a supermassive black hole (SMBH), with a mass that has been estimated to be 270 million times the mass of the Sun, and counter- rotates with respect of the rest of the galaxy, being bluer. The SMBH is quiescent, but is detectable as an X-ray and radio source that indicates an outflow. The nucleus contains an embedded stellar disk that is bluer (younger) than the bulge region, with a blue component stretching along a position angle of around 150¬∞. This extended disk feature may be the result of a galactic merger followed by a starburst event. Messier 59 is very rich in globular clusters, with a population of them that has been estimated to be around 2,200. It has a satellite, the Ultra Compact Dwarf galaxy M59-UCD3. One supernova (1939B) has been recorded in M59; it reached a peak magnitude of 11.9. The region where this supernova occurred shows no trace of star formation, which suggests this was a type Ia supernova.

The argument is structured as a basic modus tollens: if \\"creation\\" contains many defects, then design appears an implausible theory for the origin of earthly existence. Proponents most commonly use the argument in a weaker way, however: not with the aim of disproving the existence of God, but rather as a reductio ad absurdum of the well-known argument from design (which suggests that living things appear too well-designed to have originated by chance, and so an intelligent God or gods must have deliberately created them). Although the phrase \\"argument from poor design\\" has seen little use, this type of argument has been advanced many times using words and phrases such as \\"poor design\\", \\"suboptimal design\\", \\"unintelligent design\\" or \\"dysteleology/dysteleological\\". The nineteenth-century biologist Ernst Haeckel applied the term \\"dysteleology\\" to the implications of organs so rudimentary as to be useless to the life of an organism. In his 1868 book Nat√ºrliche Sch√∂pfungsgeschichte (The History of Creation), Haeckel devoted most of a chapter to the argument, ending with the proposition (perhaps with tongue slightly in cheek) of \\"a theory of the unsuitability of parts in organisms, as a counter-hypothesis to the old popular doctrine of the suitability of parts\\". In 2005 Donald Wise of the University of Massachusetts Amherst popularised the term \\"incompetent design\\" (a play on \\"intelligent design\\"), to describe aspects of nature seen as flawed in design. Traditional Christian theological responses generally posit that God constructed a perfect universe but that humanity's misuse of its free will to rebel against God has resulted in the corruption of divine good design.Harry Hahne, The Corruption and Redemption of Creation: Nature in Romans 8, Volume 34Gregory A. Boyd, God at War: The Bible & Spiritual Conflict ed. Charles Taliaferro, Chad Meister, The Cambridge Companion to Christian Philosophical Theology, pages 160-161 - \\"Fundamental to the position is Augustine's view that the universe God created is good; eveything in the universe is good and has good purpose [...]. [...] How did evil arise? It came about, he maintains, through free will. [...] some of God's free creatures turned their will from God, the supreme Good, to lesser goods. [...] It happened first with the angels and then [...] with humans. This is how moral evil entered the universe and this moral fall, or sin, also brought with it tragic cosmic consequences, for it ushered in natural evil as well.\\"  Overview  Natural selection is expected to push fitness to a peak, but that peak often is not the highest. The argument runs that: # An omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent creator God would create organisms that have optimal design. # Organisms have features that are suboptimal. # Therefore, God either did not create these organisms or is not omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent. It is sometimes used as a reductio ad absurdum of the well-known argument from design, which runs as follows: # Living things are too well-designed to have originated by chance. # Therefore, life must have been created by an intelligent creator. # This creator is God. \\"Poor design\\" is consistent with the predictions of the scientific theory of evolution by means of natural selection. This predicts that features that were evolved for certain uses, are then reused or co-opted for different uses, or abandoned altogether; and that suboptimal state is due to the inability of the hereditary mechanism to eliminate the particular vestiges of the evolutionary process. In fitness landscape terms, natural selection will always push \\"up the hill\\", but a species cannot normally get from a lower peak to a higher peak without first going through a valley. The argument from poor design is one of the arguments that was used by Charles Darwin;Darwin, Charles. The Origin of Species, 6th ed., Ch. 14. modern proponents have included Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Dawkins. They argue that such features can be explained as a consequence of the gradual, cumulative nature of the evolutionary process. Theistic evolutionists generally reject the argument from design, but do still maintain belief in the existence of God.  Examples  =In humans= Fatal flaws Artist's representation of an ectopic pregnancy. Critics cite such common biological occurrences as contradictory to the 'watchmaker analogy'. Several defects in human anatomy can result in death, especially without modern medical care: * In the human female, a fertilized egg can implant into the fallopian tube, cervix or ovary rather than the uterus causing an ectopic pregnancy. The existence of a cavity between the ovary and the fallopian tube could indicate a flawed design in the female reproductive system. Prior to modern surgery, ectopic pregnancy invariably caused the deaths of both mother and baby. Even in modern times, in almost all cases the pregnancy must be aborted to save the life of the mother. * In the human female, the birth canal passes through the pelvis. The prenatal skull will deform to a surprising extent. However, if the baby's head is significantly larger than the pelvic opening, the baby cannot be born naturally. Prior to the development of modern surgery (caesarean section), such a complication would lead to the death of the mother, the baby, or both. Other birthing complications such as breech birth are worsened by this position of the birth canal. * In the human male, testes develop initially within the abdomen. Later during gestation, they migrate through the abdominal wall into the scrotum. This causes two weak points in the abdominal wall where hernias can later form. Prior to modern surgical techniques, complications from hernias, such as intestinal blockage and gangrene, usually resulted in death. * The existence of the pharynx, a passage used for both ingestion and respiration, with the consequent drastic increase in the risk of choking. * The breathing reflex is stimulated not directly by the absence of oxygen but indirectly by the presence of carbon dioxide. A result is that, at high altitudes, oxygen deprivation can occur in unadapted individuals who do not consciously increase their breathing rate. * The human appendix is a vestigial organ thought to serve no purpose. Appendicitis, an infection of this organ, is a certain death without medical intervention. \\"During the past few years, however, several studies have suggested its immunological importance for the development and preservation of the intestinal immune system.\\" Other flaws * Barely used nerves and muscles, such as the plantaris muscle of the foot, that are missing in part of the human population and are routinely harvested as spare parts if needed during operations. Another example is the muscles that move the ears, which some people can learn to control to a degree, but serve no purpose in any case. * The common malformation of the human spinal column, leading to scoliosis, sciatica and congenital misalignment of the vertebrae. The spinal cord cannot ever properly heal if it is damaged, because neurons have become so specialized that they are no longer able to regrow once they reach their mature state. The spinal cord, if broken, will never repair itself and will result in permanent paralysis.\\"Nervous System Guide by the National Science Teachers Association.\\" Nervous System Guide by the National Science Teachers Association. National Science Teachers Association, n.d. Web. 7 Nov. 2013. <> * Almost all animals and plants synthesize their own vitamin C, but humans cannot because the gene for this enzyme is defective (Pseudogene Œ®GULO). Lack of vitamin C results in scurvy and eventually death. The gene is also non-functional in other primates and in guinea pigs, but is functional in most other animals. * The prevalence of congenital diseases and genetic disorders such as Huntington's disease. * Crowded teeth and poor sinus drainage, as human faces are significantly flatter than those of other primates although humans share the same tooth set. This results in a number of problems, most notably with wisdom teeth, which can damage neighboring teeth or cause serious infections of the mouth.\\"Wisdom Teeth.\\" American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS). AAOMS, n.d. Web. 7 Nov. 2013. <>. * The structure of human eyes (as well as those of all vertebrates). The retina is 'inside out'. The nerves and blood vessels lie on the surface of the retina instead of behind it as is the case in many invertebrate species. This arrangement forces a number of complex adaptations and gives mammals a blind spot.Nave, R. \\"The Retina.\\" of the Human Eye. N.p., n.d. Web. 7 Nov. 2013. <>. Having the optic nerve connected to the side of the retina that does not receive the light, as is the case in cephalopods, would avoid these problems.\\"Squid Brains, Eyes, and Color.\\" Squid Brains, Eyes, and Color. N.p., n.d. Web. 7 Nov. 2013. <>. * Humans are attracted to junk food's non-nutritious ingredients, and even wholly non- nutritious psychoactive drugs, and can experience physiological adaptations to prefer them to nutrients. =Other life= * In the African locust, nerve cells start in the abdomen but connect to the wing. This leads to unnecessary use of materials. * Intricate reproductive devices in orchids, apparently constructed from components commonly having different functions in other flowers. * The use by pandas of their enlarged radial sesamoid bones in a manner similar to how other creatures use thumbs. * The existence of unnecessary wings in flightless birds, e.g. ostriches. * The route of the recurrent laryngeal nerve is such that it travels from the brain to the larynx by looping around the aortic arch. This same configuration holds true for many animals; in the case of the giraffe, this results in about twenty feet of extra nerve. * The loss of tetrachromatic vision by mammals as compared to other tetrapods. * The enzyme RuBisCO has been described as a \\"notoriously inefficient\\" enzyme, as it is inhibited by oxygen, has a very slow turnover and is not saturated at current levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The enzyme is inhibited as it is unable to distinguish between carbon dioxide and molecular oxygen, with oxygen acting as a competitive enzyme inhibitor. However, RuBisCO remains the key enzyme in carbon fixation, and plants overcome its poor activity by having massive amounts of it inside their cells, making it the most abundant protein on Earth. * Sturdy but heavy bones, suited for non-flight, occurring in animals like bats. Or, on the converse: unstable, light, hollow bones, suited for flight, occurring in birds like penguins and ostriches, which cannot fly. * Various vestigial body parts, like the femur and pelvis in whales (evolution says the ancestor of whales lived on land). * Turritopsis dohrnii and species of the genus Hydra have biological immortality, but most animals do not. * Many species have strong instincts to behave in response to a certain stimulus. Natural selection can leave animals behaving in detrimental ways when they encounter a supernormal stimulus - like a moth flying into a flame. * Plants are green and not black, as chlorophyll absorbs green light poorly, even though black plants would absorb more light energy. * Whales and dolphins breathe air, but live in the water, meaning they must swim to the surface frequently to breathe. * Albatrosses cannot take off or land properly.  Criticism  =Unproven assumptions= Several generic philosophical criticisms can be directed towards the first premise of the argument ‚Äì that a Creator deity would have designed things 'optimally'. The argument hinges on an assumption that the human concept of 'optimal design' is the same as that of a theistic god. This is, in effect, the argument for the incomprehensibility of the Abrahamic God Yahweh in the Book of Job: > Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, Who is this that > darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? Gird up now thy loins like a > man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me. Where wast thou when I > laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if thou hast understanding. Who > hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? Or who hath stretched the > line upon it? Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? Or who laid > the corner stone thereof, when the morning stars sang together, and all the > sons of God shouted for joy?King James Bible. Job 38:1 The Book of Job goes on to list a number of aspects of the world that seem wonderful or miraculous beyond human understanding. The claim is that, if humans have no understanding of how the wonders of the world were created, they cannot fully understand the things that appear flawed. =Optimal design engineering and trade-offs= Others argue that the observed suboptimality in one system or another is intentional, as a trade-off to improve overall optimal design. =Specific examples= Intelligent design proponent William Dembski questions the first premise of the argument, claiming that \\"intelligent design\\" does not need to be optimal. An article written by John Woodmorappe on the Creation Ministries International website says that the panda's \\"thumb\\" works well for what the panda uses it for ‚Äì to strip leaves. While the appendix has been previously credited with very little function, research has shown that it serves an important role in the fetus and young adults. Endocrine cells appear in the appendix of the human fetus at around the 11th week of development, which produce various biogenic amines and peptide hormones, compounds that assist with various biological control (homeostatic) mechanisms. In young adults, the appendix has some immune functions. Creationist Jonathan Sarfati and ophthalmologist Peter Gurney have both published articles on the Creation Ministries International website which disagree that the human eye is poorly designed, arguing that alternative arrangements would have further complications and that the human eye actually works very well. Responses to criticism In addition, the plantaris muscle does atrophy. Its motor function is so minimal that its long tendon can readily be harvested for reconstruction elsewhere with little functional deficit. \\"Often mistaken for a nerve by freshman medical students, the muscle was useful to other primates for grasping with their feet. It has disappeared altogether in 9 percent of the population.\\" In response to the claim that uses have been found for \\"junk\\" DNA, proponents note that the fact that some non- coding DNA has a purpose does not establish that all non-coding DNA has a purpose, and that the human genome does include pseudogenes that are nonfunctional \\"junk\\", with others noting that some sections of DNA can be randomized, cut, or added to with no apparent effect on the organism in question. The original study that suggested that the Makorin1-p1 served some purpose has been disputed. However, the original study is still frequently cited in newer studies and articles on pseudogenes previously thought to be nonfunctional. As an argument regarding God The argument from poor design is sometimes interpreted, by the argumenter or the listener, as an argument against the existence of God, or against characteristics commonly attributed to a creator deity, such as omnipotence, omniscience, or personality. In a weaker form, it is used as an argument for the incompetence of God. The existence of \\"poor design\\" (as well as the perceived prodigious \\"wastefulness\\" of the evolutionary process) would seem to imply a \\"poor\\" designer, or a \\"blind\\" designer, or no designer at all. In Gould's words, \\"If God had designed a beautiful machine to reflect his wisdom and power, surely he would not have used a collection of parts generally fashioned for other purposes. Orchids are not made by an ideal engineer; they are jury-rigged....\\" The apparently suboptimal design of organisms has also been used by theistic evolutionists to argue in favour of a creator deity who uses natural selection as a mechanism of his creation.Collins, Francis S. The Language of God (New York: Simon & Schuster), 2006. p 191. Arguers from poor design regard counter-arguments as a false dilemma, imposing that either a creator deity designed life on earth well, or flaws in design indicate the life is not designed. This allows proponents of intelligent design to cherry pick which aspects of life constitute design, leading to the unfalsifiability of the theory. Christian proponents of intelligent design as evidence of the existence of the Abrahamic God Yahweh can claim that good design indicates the creative intelligence of their God, while poor design indicates corruption of the world as a result of free will that caused the Fall (Genesis 3:16 has Yahweh saying to Eve \\"I will increase your trouble in pregnancy\\").

It was the second murder in the town's nearly 150-year history; the first murder occurred in 1942. Webb was a fugitive featured on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List until 2007, setting a record on that list in 1999, but he was never apprehended. In 2010, his record on that list was superseded by another criminal. The murder of Police Chief Adams was never solved by prosecution of the criminal; it was the longest- running cold case of a police officer in the country. In July 2017, Webb's remains were discovered in Massachusetts on the property of his wife Lillian Webb. She had hidden him in two of her homes for 17 years, until he died of a stroke in 1999.  Background and family  Donald Eugene Perkins was born in Oklahoma City in 1931. He was raised by his paternal grandfather. Perkins enlisted in the United States Navy, but received a dishonorable discharge. Perkins legally changed his name to Webb in 1956 in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Webb worked as a butcher, salesman, restaurant manager, and vending machine repairman. Before 1979, Webb spent extended periods in the Southwest, New England, and on the West Coast. After Webb's disappearance in 1980, his relatives and criminal associates consistently refused to cooperate with investigators. Webb had married Lillian and they had a son together. In 1981, Webb's wife Lillian lived in South Dartmouth, Massachusetts. She worked as a saleswoman for a now-defunct New Bedford box company. In 1999, it was reported that Lillian, her son, and other relatives of Donald Webb were living in the Boston area.  Criminal career  Webb had convictions for burglary, possession of counterfeit money, possession of a weapon and dangerous instruments, breaking and entering, armed bank robbery, grand larceny and car theft. In the mid-1970s, Webb served a two-year prison term in New York state prison. The FBI has considered Webb \\"a master of assumed identities\\". New York and Pennsylvania police have described Webb as \\"an itinerant burglar well versed in the art of criminal impersonation\\". Webb was identified by the FBI as an associate of the Patriarca crime family, who made a living robbing banks, jewelry stores, and high-end hotels up and down the East Coast. They fenced the goods through \\"the mob\\" in Providence, Rhode Island. He was also involved with an organized crime outfit in the Miami area, where he would also fence the goods. In 1979, Webb and two accomplices allegedly burglarized suburban Albany homes while posing as sewer and water inspectors. Webb and Frank Joseph Lach, one of the accomplices, were arrested in Colonie, New York. They were charged with attempted burglary, but after their bails were posted (bail of Webb was $35,000), they failed to appear at a December 1979 court date. = Frank Lach = Frank Joseph Lach (November 23, 1940 - November 4, 2017), was closely associated with Webb. Lach is from Cranston, Rhode Island and was believed to be involved with a Massachusetts-based gang responsible for a number of jewel thefts from residences and businesses in the 1960s and 1970s, as well as having ties to organized crime in New England and South Florida. Although the last known connection of Webb and Lach was in Allentown, Pennsylvania in July 1980, Lach was believed to be with Webb when he killed Police Chief Gregory Adams in December 1980 in Saxonburg. (See below) Lach was subsequently wanted by the FBI for interstate flight from justice; he was captured in South Miami, Florida in May 1982. He was extradited to New York, where he was convicted of burglary and bail-jumping. He was paroled in November 1985. In February 1986, he was convicted by a federal jury of conspiracy to transport stolen property interstate, and of driving under the influence and parole violation in June 1996. Lach served time in federal prison and was released in October 2000. Lach passed away on November 4, 2017 at his house in Cranston, Rhode Island just 19 days before his 77th birthday.  Murder of Gregory Adams  Gregory Adams On December 4, 1980, Gregory B. Adams, a 31-year-old police chief of Saxonburg, Pennsylvania, and nine-year veteran of law enforcement, made a routine traffic stop in the parking lot of Agway Feed Store on Butler Street. Adams used his patrol car to stop the suspect by blocking the exit of the parking lot. When he asked the suspect for his driver's license, the suspect gave fraudulent identity documents and shot Adams. He returned fire, but the shots were not fatal. The man believed to be Donald Eugene Webb got out of the car and fought with Adams, disarming him and pistol-whipping him with his own revolver. Witnesses heard fired shots; four \\"pop\\" noises, presumably from a semiautomatic .25-caliber Colt pistol, and a \\"boom\\" from Adams' revolver. He was shot once in the arm and once in the chest at close range. By another account, Adams was shot twice in the chest, one bullet collapsing a lung and another tearing through the bottom of his heart. Adams was not wearing his bulletproof vest at the time. The killer took Adams' gun, ran to his patrol car, ripped out its microphone and took the keys before driving away in his own car. A nearby resident found the mortally wounded Adams, who told her that he did not know his attacker and that he thought he was not going to live. Adams was so badly beaten he was almost unrecognizable. Adams lost consciousness on the way to the hospital and died of his injuries. He was survived by his wife Mary Ann Adams and their two sons, Benjamin and Gregory, Jr. Adams is buried in St. Mary's Cemetery in Herman, Pennsylvania.ODMP memorial Gregory Adams  Investigation  A .25-caliber Colt pistol, O-type blood (Webb's blood type), and a New Jersey driver's license bearing the name Stanley John Portas, an alias of Webb and the name of his wife Lillian's late prior husband, were among the evidence found at the murder scene. Portas had died in 1948. Webb is believed to have been in Saxonburg for a planned burglary of a jewelry store. Adams' revolver was later found approximately away along Cornplanter Road in Winfield, Pennsylvania. All six bullets of the weapon had been fired. A white Mercury Cougar, which Webb had rented, was allegedly used as a getaway car. Two weeks later, it was found abandoned at a Howard Johnson's motel in Warwick, Rhode Island. Significant amounts of O-type blood were found under the steering wheel, suggesting that Webb was wounded by gunfire in the struggle with Adams. Webb was named as a main suspect in the killing of Chief Adams, and a nationwide manhunt began. He was charged in absentia with murder, attempted burglary, and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. A federal arrest warrant was issued for him on December 31. On May 4, 1981, Webb was named as the 375th fugitive to be placed on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list. Age-enhanced photograph released by FBI in 1996. Webb had strong ties to Fall River and New Bedford, Massachusetts, where the last confirmed sighting of him was made by an anonymous tipster in July 1981. It was reported to the Boston FBI office, but Webb had fled by the time investigators arrived. There were later unconfirmed sightings of Webb, or men resembling him, in Massachusetts, Washington, Canada and Costa Rica. In January 1990, FBI director William S. Sessions received a letter postmarked January 23 and written by someone claiming to be Webb, asking for forgiveness from Adams' family. The letter suggested he might surrender to authorities, but only if he could talk directly to John Walsh, host of the TV show America's Most Wanted. Walsh said on his show that the FBI's evidence technicians examined the letter and believed it was authentic. Handwriting tests were inconclusive (They have now been discounted as accurate forensic evidence, anyway.) On April 1, 1990, a man claiming to be Webb called John Walsh but when asked questions to confirm his identity, was unable to name two of Webb's closest relatives. The call was dismissed as an April Fools' joke. The murder case was featured in an episode of Unsolved Mysteries. After more than 18 years on the list, on September 14, 1999, Webb was noted as the fugitive with the longest tenure on the FBI Ten Most Wanted list, surpassing the previous record held by Charles Lee Herron. In April 2005, an unidentified man in Detroit was found using Webb's name, age and social security number. Detroit police tracked the address to a burned-out house in a poor section of town. Authorities considered this a case of identity theft, however unusual. The FBI removed Webb from the Ten Most Wanted list on March 31, 2007. He was replaced by Shauntay Henderson. Webb held the record of being on the FBI's wanted list longer than any other fugitive until 2010, when V√≠ctor Manuel Gerena surpassed his record. Although Webb was still a fugitive considered armed and dangerous by the FBI, the significant lack of leads made some investigators believe Webb had died. On December 4, 2015, the FBI increased their reward to $100,000 for information leading to the arrest of Webb, or to the location of his remains. Key investigators, including the FBI special agent assigned to finding Webb, believed he was still alive. On June 1, 2017, Mary Ann Adams Jones, the police chief's widow (who had remarried), filed a lawsuit for civil damages against Donald Eugene Webb, his wife Lillian Webb, and Webb's stepson Stanley Webb. FBI investigators had announced that in 2016 they had discovered a secret room hidden behind a closet in the basement of Lillian Webb's home in North Dartmouth, Massachusetts. The room had not existed when Lillian purchased the home. Agents also discovered a cane inside the room, which they believed may have been used by Webb after being shot in the leg by Adams. On June 15, 2017, the FBI released newly acquired photographs of Webb taken in the 1970s. They hoped these would aid in gaining the public's assistance in either capturing Webb or locating his remains. Faced with prosecution for harboring a criminal, Lillian Webb arranged to confess to police and the FBI. She told about sheltering Webb, and the strokes he suffered near the end of his life. He had been treated in a Massachusetts hospital under an assumed name for the serious injuries to his leg in 1980. She led the FBI to human remains buried on the grounds of her Dartmouth home. On July 17, 2017, the remains were identified by FBI forensic investigators as belonging to Webb. The investigators found that Webb had died in 1999 after suffering multiple strokes. State police documents said that Webb had lived for nearly 19 years hidden by his wife in the two different houses where she lived in that time.

He is a member of the Democratic Party. In 2010, Ortiz was defeated by Republican challenger Blake Farenthold.Ortiz-Farenthold recount expected next week The Brownsville Herald, November 12, 2010 Ortiz's son, Solomon Ortiz, Jr., is a former state Representative. Early life, education, and business career Solomon Ortiz was born in Robstown, Nueces County, Texas; his family had immigrated from Mexico. As a boy, he held several odd jobs, including working as a shoeshiner and an ink fogger for The Robstown Record's letter press. Ortiz befriended, and became fascinated with, law enforcement officers. He attended Robstown High School until the age of 19, when he dropped out after his father's death to help support his family. Ortiz joined the United States Army in 1960, serving two years and earning his GED. He received basic training at Fort Hood, Texas, and served a tour of duty in Verdun and Vitry-le-Fran√ßois, France. Expressing his interest in law enforcement, Ortiz was reassigned to the 61st Military Police Company Criminal Investigation Office and received advanced military police training at Fort Gordon, Georgia. After returning to South Texas, Ortiz worked for three years as an insurance agent. Early political career In 1964, he was urged by friends to run for Nueces County Constable and was elected in 1965, defeating the incumbent in a runoff election. He was elected to the County Commissioners Court of Nueces County in 1969; the first Hispanic to serve in that capacity. He remained in that position until 1976, when he was elected County Sheriff, another first for a Hispanic in Nueces County. U.S. House of Representatives =Elections= When the 27th District was created in 1982, Ortiz ran for the seat on a platform of jobs incentives and attention to education. He won the Democratic primary run-off election with 52% of the vote, defeating Republican State Representative Joe Salem. In the general election, he won with 64% of the vote. He won re-election thirteen times, dipping below 60% of the vote only four times before 2010. His lowest winning percentage was in 1992 when he defeated Republican Jay Kimbrough 55%-43%. ;2010 On November 2, election night, Ortiz appeared to have lost to the Republican challenger, Blake Farenthold, but Ortiz requested a recount. Ortiz conceded after the November 22 recount. Farenthold narrowly defeated him 47.8%-47.1%, by a margin of just 770 votes. While Ortiz had won four of the district's six counties, he lost the two northernmost counties, San Patricio and his home county of Nueces. =Tenure= Ortiz is a Democratic moderate. He is socially conservative but economically liberal. For example, he is anti-abortion, but usually voted with his party on economic issues. =Committee assignments= ;111th Congress *Committee on Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness (Chairman) Subcommittee on Seapower and Expeditionary Forces *Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Aviation Subcommittee on Highways and Transit Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment ;Previous committees In 1983, as a freshman congressman, he was assigned to the U.S. Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control.

She began her career working with promoter Billy Wolfe and his wife, wrestler and trainer Mildred Burke, as well as working alongside professional wrestler \\"Nature Boy\\" Buddy Rogers. She won the NWA World Women's Championship in 1956 and was the most prominent holder of the title for 28 years. She is overall an eight-time women's world champion and to this day holds the record as the longest reigning women's world champion in combination of all her reigns. In the 1980s, she joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, later WWE) as part of the Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection storyline, feuding with Cyndi Lauper and Wendi Richter, the latter of whom defeated her for the WWF Women's Championship in the main event of The Brawl to End It All in 1984. Moolah regained the Women's Championship on two further occasions before entering semi-retirement towards the end of the decade. She continued to make sporadic appearances for WWF/WWE until her death, often in comedic roles with longtime friend Mae Young. In 1999, she became the oldest champion in the history of professional wrestling when she won the Women's Championship for a final time at age 76. During her lifetime, Moolah was lauded as a leading figure in women's professional wrestling and was considered one of the industry's greatest wrestlers. She became the first woman to be inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame in 1995 and is also a member of the NWA Hall of Fame and the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame. Her legacy was tarnished in the years following her death, when allegations surfaced that she had exploited women wrestlers under her tutelage both financially and sexually.  Early life  Mary Lillian Ellison was born in 1923 in Kershaw County, South Carolina, and grew up in Tookiedoo, 12 miles from Columbia.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, p. 26. The youngest of five children, Ellison was the only daughter of a part-Cherokee father and an Irish mother. Her parents owned a farm, a grocery store, and a service station. When her mother died of cancer, eight-year-old Ellison went to live with her paternal grandmother and worked on her cousin's cotton farm to make money. At age 10, Ellison was still deeply distraught over her mother's death; to cheer her up, her father took her to the local wrestling matches. Ellison liked the matches, but it was not until she saw Women's Champion Mildred Burke wrestle that \\"they began to mean much more\\" to her.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, pp. 30‚Äì32. Ellison returned to the Columbia home of her father and brothers.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, pp. 36‚Äì38. She graduated from Columbia High School, but at age 14 married 21-year-old Walter Carroll. They soon became parents to a daughter. A few months after the birth of her daughter, she divorced Carroll. Still only 15, she left her daughter with a friend and set out on a wrestling career of her own.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, pp. 43‚Äì45.  Professional wrestling career  =National Wrestling Alliance=  Early career (1949‚Äì1955)  Ellison began her wrestling career with Mildred Burke's husband Billy Wolfe, the dominant women's promoter of the time. She competed with many other female wrestlers, stepping into the ring with the likes of Mae Young, Cecilia Blevins and Mildred Burke. Wolfe was notorious for advising his wrestlers to enter into sexual relationships with either himself or competing promoters to ensure additional bookings, a practice with which Ellison refused to go along.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, p. 46. She, however, soon began a romance with wrestler Johnny Long. Long later introduced Ellison to Jack Pfefer who gave her the moniker \\"Slave Girl Moolah\\".Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, pp. 60‚Äì65. By the early 1950s, Moolah was a valet for \\"Nature Boy\\" Buddy Rogers, accompanying him to the ring while providing eye candy for the male audiences and assisting Rogers against his opponents. Ellison broke up the partnership because Rogers kept pushing her to begin a sexual relationship. She then served as the valet for the Elephant Boy (Tony Olivas). Olivas was Mexican, but had very dark skin, which caused controversy when Ellison, a white woman, would kiss him on the cheek during their ring entrance routine.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, pp. 68‚Äì69. At one show in Oklahoma City, a man, who thought that Olivas was a black man, attempted to stab Ellison with a knife for kissing him. Moolah later left Pfeffer's promotion and began wrestling under Boston promoters Tony Santos and Paul Bowser.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, pp. 90‚Äì91. In 1955, she began working for Vince McMahon, Sr.'s Capitol Wrestling Corporation.  World Champion (1956‚Äì1983)  Moolah with the NWA World Women's Championship On September 18, 1956, Moolah defeated Judy Grable in a 13-woman battle royal to win the vacant World Women's Championship, which shares a lineage with the NWA World Women's Championship.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, pp. 98‚Äì100. She was not immediately recognized by everyone as the NWA Champion because Billy Wolfe, with whom she had conflict earlier in her career, still controlled the promotion.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, pp. 104‚Äì107. After the match, Vince McMahon, Sr. dubbed Ellison with a new ring name ‚Äì The Fabulous Moolah. Subsequently, June Byers came out of retirement to challenge Moolah to a match for the title. During the match, Moolah acted as the aggressor and pinned Byers to retain the championship. Moolah's first World Championship reign lasted over ten years. Moolah successfully defended the belt against the top female wrestlers in the world, such as Judy Grable and Donna Christanello, while also purporting to befriend some of the biggest celebrities of the day.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, p. 73. Moolah claimed in her book, First Goddess of the Squared Circle, that she formed friendships with Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis. After June Byers retired in 1964, Moolah was subsequently recognized as official NWA Champion, thus making her the undisputed Women's World Champion. Nevertheless, Moolah dropped the belt on September 17, 1967 to Bette Boucher, although she regained the title just weeks later. She also traded the belt with Yukiko Tomoe during a tour of Japan in 1968. On July 1, 1972, Moolah became the first woman allowed to wrestle at Madison Square Garden, which had previously banned women's wrestling. In fact, Moolah helped overturn the ban on women's wrestling in the entire state of New York, which the New York State Athletic Commission lifted in June 1972.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, pp. 134‚Äì137. During her quest to overturn the ban, she flipped football player Roosevelt \\"Rosey\\" Grier onto his back on The Mike Douglas Show. Moolah continued an uninterrupted eight-year reign before losing to Sue Green at Madison Square Garden in 1976. Moolah regained her title a short time later. She also bought the legal rights to the championship in the late 1970s, and after losing the championship for two days to Evelyn Stevens in 1978, began another long reign, defending her title for another six years. Also in the 1970s, Moolah held the NWA Women's World Tag Team Championship twice with Toni Rose. =World Wrestling Federation=  Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection (1983‚Äì1987)  In 1983, Vincent Kennedy McMahon began expanding the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) nationally, and Moolah sold him the rights to her Women's World Championship. Moolah agreed to appear exclusively for the WWF, and thus became the first WWF Women's Champion. The following year, singer Cyndi Lauper began a verbal feud with manager \\"Captain\\" Lou Albano, who long had a reputation of being a villain, that brought professional wrestling into mainstream culture in a storyline that became known as the \\"Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection.\\"Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, pp. 169‚Äì170. When it was finally time for Lauper and Albano to settle their differences in the ring, a match-up was scheduled with Albano representing Moolah against the challenge of Lauper's prot√©g√©, Wendi Richter. After much buildup and hype, the Fabulous Moolah lost the championship to Richter on July 23, 1984, in the main event of The Brawl to End It All, which was broadcast live on MTV.Shields, Brian. Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s, p. 87. Prior to the match, the WWF promoted Moolah as holding the championship for the previous 28 years. After losing the title to Richter, Moolah aided Leilani Kai in defeating Richter for the title in February 1985. Richter won it back at the inaugural WrestleMania, but when Richter's relationship soured with the WWF, Moolah donned a mask as \\"The Spider Lady\\" and regained the belt on November 25, 1985, in a controversial decision. Richter was never told she would be losing the title and fell victim to a real-life \\"screwjob\\" finish known as \\"The Original Screwjob\\". Richter promptly quit the WWF afterward, while Moolah continued to be champion for another two years‚Äîexcluding a six- day reign by Velvet McIntyre during a tour of Australia in 1986‚Äîbefore losing the belt to Sherri Martel on July 24, 1987. She later captained a team at the inaugural Survivor Series. Her team (Moolah, Velvet McIntyre, Rockin' Robin, and the Jumping Bomb Angels) defeated champion Martel and her team (Leilani Kai, Judy Martin, Donna Christanello, and Dawn Marie). =American Wrestling Association (1988)= On September 3, 1988 Moolah went to the American Wrestling Association for one match when she wrestled Madusa Miceli to a double DQ.https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr;=1053&page;=4&year;=1988&promotion;=41 Afterwards Moohlah would retire from wrestling. =Ladies International Wrestling Association (1990-2000)= During her retirement Moolah was the promoter for Ladies International Wrestling Association (LIWA) in 1990 based in North Carolina.https://www.cagematch.net/?id=8&nr;=2348 Also the shows were held in Las Vegas. She started wrestling again in 1993 at the age of 70 when she defeated Sunny Brook. On June 21, 1996 she teamed with Mae Young at LIWA Golden Girls Extravaganza event in Las Vegas where they wrestled Liz Chase and Lori Lynn to a no contest.https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr;=222603 Moolah continued wrestling for the promotion and even continued teaming with Young. In 2000, while working for WWF; LIWA shut down. Moolah would continue working for WWF. = Later Career (1987‚Äì2007) = Throughout the early 1990s, she made appearances in video packages and at live WWF events. On June 24, 1995, she was the first female wrestler to be inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame. In the late 1990s, Pat Patterson and Ellison began jokingly discussing a comeback for her, which resulted in Patterson contacting WWF Chairman Vince McMahon about the possibility.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, p. 205. In 1999, Moolah and Mae Young re-emerged in the WWF (later renamed World Wrestling Entertainment, WWE). The WWF women's division, however, had since moved away from the traditional athletic match-ups of the past and now featured women competing in sexually-themed bikini contests and strip matches. Upon returning, Moolah and Young began appearing regularly in comedic roles. On the September 9, 1999 episode of SmackDown!, Jeff Jarrett invited Moolah, 76, into the ring and smashed a guitar over her head. On the September 27, 1999 episode of Monday Night Raw, Moolah and Young defeated Ivory in a Handicapped Evening Gown match, which led to a title match at No Mercy on October 17. The match saw Moolah defeat Ivory to regain the WWF Women's Championship, thus becoming the oldest champion ever,Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, pp. 2‚Äì7. though she lost the title back to Ivory eight days later. On the September 15, 2003 episode of Raw, Moolah won a match against Victoria. Moolah had been promised the match for her eightieth birthday and became the first octogenarian to compete in a WWE ring. After Moolah's victory, the \\"Legend Killer\\" Randy Orton came out and performed an RKO on her. Moolah and Young made another appearance at New Years Revolution in 2006, during a Bra and Panties Gauntlet match attacking Victoria and stripping her of her top. She also made brief appearances at WrestleMania 23 and the 2007 Draft Lottery on June 11, 2007. Her last WWE appearance before her death was at SummerSlam in August 2007, in a backstage segment with Vince McMahon and Raw General Manager William Regal.  Training and promoting  Moolah stands at a turnbuckle in 1975 Ellison and her second husband Johnny Long began training women to become female wrestlers, including Ella Waldek, Daisy Mae, and Katherine Simpson. Long later contacted promoter Jack Pfefer, who agreed to book some of the wrestlers at his shows. After marrying wrestler Buddy Lee, he began helping Ellison train the female wrestlers. After she left Pfeffer's promotion in the 1950s, Ellison found it difficult to book her trainees in shows due to Pfeffer's influence over other National Wrestling Alliance promoters. Ellison claimed Pfeffer would threaten to reveal the pre- planned nature of wrestling if any other promoters did not do as he liked. As a result, Ellison began selling cosmetics door-to-door and Lee opened a service station to make enough money to pay their bills. They later began to book their wrestlers, including Judy Grable in Boston, under promoter Paul Bowser. In the late 1950s when the once-dominant promoter of women's wrestling, Billy Wolfe, was out of business, Ellison and Lee began to book their female wrestlers for more and more shows.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, pp. 108‚Äì112. They began calling their promoting business Girl Wrestling Enterprises (GWE). Ellison demanded a lot from the girls of GWE, including that they had to keep their hair and make-up done, act like a lady, and not date men who were in the professional wrestling business. In addition to women, Ellison also trained midget professional wrestlers, including Katie Glass in the 1960s. Ellison founded the Ladies' International Wrestling Association, a non-profit organization to help retired professional wrestlers, in the late 1980s.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, p. 23. In the 1990s, she spent most of her time training female wrestlers at her school in Columbia, South Carolina.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, pp. 8‚Äì10. She also began training men, including Del Wilkes, and in 1995 trained more men than women. She also spent time training in Los Angeles at Verne Langdon's Slammers Gym.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, p. 198. Allegations of exploitation =Financial and sexual exploitation= Journalist Dave Meltzer wrote an obituary for Moolah in which he stated that \\"different promoters had very different ideas of what being professional meant.\\" Wrestling historian Tim Hornbaker said that Moolah \\"chose not to\\" break the \\"dishonest, greedy\\" practices established by her mentor Billy Wolfe. Pat Laprade and Dan Murphy, in their book Sisterhood of the Squared Circle, wrote that Moolah's \\"tactics could be just as ruthless and cutthroat as those of 'The Godfather, Don Corleone. Wendi Richter and Mad Maxine both claimed that Ellison did not actually train the wrestlers at her wrestling school. According to Richter, Ellison accepted payment of the training fee (which at the time of Richter's training was $500) and had other female wrestlers within her camp (including Leilani Kai, Judy Martin, Winona Littleheart, and Joyce Grable) train the new recruits; these women did not get paid for their additional work as trainers. Richter also claimed that Ellison required all women that received training at her camp to sign a contract that allowed Ellison to function as their booker and receive 25% of their booking fee. Trainees were also required to rent duplex apartments on Ellison's property and they were responsible for paying her for rent and utilities. The training lasted six months and took place up to five hours per day inside a wrestling ring in a barn that lacked heating and air conditioning or fans. Mad Maxine said that due to owing Moolah both rent and training fees amounting to $1,500, the trainees \\"went into debt to [Moolah] and she controlled their lives... It was an environment ripe for abuse.\\" Maxine also said that when she went to work for WWF, Moolah was taking at least half of her earnings. Debbie Johnson, another former trainee of Ellison's, stated that she was required to give Ellison 30% of her booking fee, and her paycheck was further reduced as Ellison deducted travel expenses, food, rent, and utilities before paying her. As a result, Johnson worked for Ellison for two years before she received any money. Johnson stated that Ellison would refuse to book certain women in her training camp if they angered her, and that Ellison monitored her and refused to let her leave the physical constraints of the training camp unless she was accompanied by someone else. Over the years, various female wrestlers have come forward with stories accusing Ellison of being a pimp who often provided various wrestling promoters with unsuspecting female wrestlers that would be used as sex objects. Penny Banner directly described Moolah as a pimp who \\"in return for money,\\" rented her female trainees out \\"in bulk\\" to wrestling promoters so that the promoters and the male wrestlers could have sex with them. Banner said the women who were \\"sent on these tours were not told of this 'arrangement' ahead of time,\\" and that \\"those who refused to have sex with wrestlers and promoters were raped.\\" One of the most notorious accusations is from the family of Sweet Georgia Brown (Susie Mae McCoy), who was trained by Moolah and her husband, Buddy Lee. The Columbia Free Times reported allegations made by her daughter in 2006, in which she said her mother told her that she was often raped, given drugs, and made an addict in an intentional attempt by Ellison and Lee to control her. Ida Martinez, who wrestled during the 1960s, also recalls that many of the regional promoters \\"demanded personal services\\" before they would pay the female wrestlers. Mad Maxine described Moolah as an \\"evil person,\\" saying Moolah made money by sending trainees \\"out to this guy in Arizona and pimped them out.\\" In a 2002 interview, Luna Vachon claimed that when she was sixteen years old and training at Ellison's camp, Ellison sent her out of state to be photographed by an older man. Although she remained clothed during the photo shoot, Vachon stated she felt taken advantage of by Ellison and the older man. Vachon also stated that her aunt, Vivian Vachon, witnessed Ellison abusing alcohol and having sex with her female trainees. Sandy Parker, a lesbian former pupil of Ellison's, also claims that Ellison forbade her from going to any gay bars and tried to press her to date men. Parker says this enraged her, because \\"(Moolah) was two faced because she had her own little dalliances that we all knew about.\\" However, several former co-workers have spoken out in Ellison's defense. Professional wrestler Shane Douglas said he never heard anybody speaking against Moolah during his career. Former female wrestler Beverly Shade also defended Moolah, claiming \\"Moolah wasn't that kind of person.\\" Jerry Lawler also said he \\"never heard or saw anything like that when I was in the business around Moolah and her girls.\\" Former trainee Princess Victoria said Moolah never pimped any women or used drugs, but she did take money from them. Michael McCoy, Sweet Georgia Brown's son, refuted allegations made by his sister, stating that she has an agenda and that the allegations are false. However, on the Dark Side of the Ring episode about The Fabulous Moolah, Michael McCoy stated that she was indeed made to have sex with paying promoters. Bruce Prichard said she was protecting herself from the promoters and the only negative thing he heard of her was \\" took a percentage of their pay, which was laid out in their contract clearly before they even started training, day one.\\". =Manipulation of the women's wrestling industry in the United States= As well as allegedly exploiting female wrestlers sexually, Ellison was accused of using her influence to control the women's wrestling scene and ensure that other women did not gain greater recognition. In addition to being a key participant in the original screwjob on Wendi Richter, Ellison used her influence to take over the spot originally held by her prot√©g√© Mad Maxine on the animated series Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling. Maxine was about to receive a big push by Vince McMahon but left the WWF shortly afterwards, as Ellison was unwilling to provide her with additional bookings. Maxine said that Moolah never told her about the WWF's plans to include her in the cartoon. Numerous other former trainees defected from Ellison after growing tired of sharing their paychecks with Ellison. Women wrestlers including Vivian and Luna Vachon, Ann Casey, and Darling Dagmar moved into other regions where Ellison had less control and negotiated their own payouts with promoters. Both Judy Martin and Leilani Kai told in later interviews that Moolah would collect the women wrestlers' pay from promoters and, after taking out her own pay, would only give the girls half of the money they were owed (keeping half of their pay for herself, plus her own pay) and telling them that was all the promoter gave her to give them. Martin stated that shortly before Ellison left the WWF in 1988 (shortly after falling out with Martin and Kai due to Ellison no longer receiving their booking fees), she sabotaged the duo while they were touring Japan. Martin stated that Ellison contacted Japanese promoters and informed them that the Jumping Bomb Angels were supposed to drop the WWF Women's Tag Team Championship to The Glamour Girls before Martin and Kai returned to the United States. This was contrary to the booking decision made by Pat Patterson before the Japanese tour began. Unable to reach Patterson by telephone, Kai and Martin agreed to win the titles from the Angels since Ellison had already misinformed the Japanese promoters. Martin stated that upon returning to the United States, Patterson was angry with them and confirmed that nobody within the WWF made the decision for the title change and that due to her long-standing relationship with the company, the WWF refused to listen to their explanation of Ellison's deceit. Shortly thereafter, the WWF phased out the WWF Women's Tag Team Championship. In a later shoot interview, Leilani Kai told that had things gone as the WWF originally planned, The Glamour Girls would have had a title match against the Jumping Bomb Angels at WrestleMania IV and that Ellison's actions had cost the four girls what would have been ultimately their biggest ever payday. Women that chose to continue allowing Ellison to work as their booker were kept under tight control. Velvet McIntyre was forced to compete against Ellison (whom McIntyre stated she didn't care for) at WrestleMania 2 instead of competing during an all-women tour of Kuwait with a group of Ellison's other female wrestlers. Their WrestleMania 2 match lasted less than two minutes with the referee ignoring McIntyre's leg being on the ropes while she was being pinned. Women that did not agree to Ellison's booking fees faced limited options. Rhonda Sing stated that Ellison contacted her and offered to let her wrestle Richter in a couple of pay-per-view matches for the WWF in 1985, but demanded she receive half of Sing's pay check; a stipulation Sing was unwilling to accept. Penny Banner stated that her retirement was due in large part to Ellison refusing to allow any of her female wrestlers to accept bookings against Banner, which severely limited the number of bookings that Banner was offered by promoters. Legacy At the time of her death, Kevin Eck wrote in The Baltimore Sun: \\"The Fabulous Moolah didn't just dominate women's wrestling for parts of four decades, she was women's wrestling. Moolah ... is unquestionably the most influential and famous female wrestler in history.\\" The Post and Courier columnist Mike Mooneyham described her as \\"one of the greatest female performers to ever step into a professional wrestling ring and the most powerful woman outside the squared circle.\\" In 2010, WWE recognized her as the 43rd best wrestler ever. In 2016, after allegations against Moolah had become more prevalent, Luke Winkie of Sports Illustrated listed Moolah as the 69th greatest wrestler of all time because of her lengthy title reign but wrote that he \\"didn't feel great about it\\". Dave Meltzer described that women's wrestling \\"went way way down\\" under Moolah's \\"tutelage\\", but he also said he did not know if it was her fault. Meltzer said that although women \\"used to headline and they were successful\\", \\"during the period Moolah controlled women's wrestling, the popularity and product didn't evolve.\\" However, Meltzer noted that Moolah herself \\"stood the test of time\\" to remain culturally relevant long after the Japanese female wrestlers of the 1980s (more popular at that time) had faded from relevance. In March 2018, WWE announced \\"The Fabulous Moolah Memorial Battle Royal\\", a battle royal for the female wrestlers of the company scheduled for WrestleMania 34 named in honor of Moolah. The decision to hold a battle royal in honor of Moolah drew controversy after the allegations of exploitation against Moolah resurfaced. Two days after the announcement, WWE renamed the match \\"WrestleMania Women's Battle Royal\\", removing Moolah's name from the event. A 2019 episode of Dark Side of the Ring broadcast on Viceland examined the allegations against her in the aftermath of the battle royal name controversy. The episode repeated many of the allegations against her but also featured comments from the son of Sweet Georgia Brown and wrestlers Selina Majors and Beverly Shade, who defended her. \\"If I choose not to like her because of what she did to me, that's fine,\\" Princess Victoria stated. \\"But Moolah needs to be remembered. She was an icon in this business. You can't take away her history because she was an asshole!\\"  Other media  An animated version of Moolah was included on Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling. In addition, she appeared in one of Cyndi Lauper's music videos, \\"The Goonies 'R' Good Enough\\".Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, p. 173. An illness in the mid-1970s meant Ellison had to pull out of the Bill Cosby movie Mother, Jugs & Speed, which had a role written specifically for her.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, p. 150. In 2002, Moolah wrote her autobiography, The Fabulous Moolah: First Goddess of the Squared Circle. The book has been criticized for keeping kayfabe (the stance that wrestling storylines are real) and did not reveal a lot about her time controlling women's wrestling. Defending herself against these claims, Ellison retorted it was hard to fit all of her almost five decade career into one book. Moolah and Young, along with several other female wrestlers, starred in the 2004 film Lipstick and Dynamite, a documentary about the female wrestlers from the 1950s era. They also appeared on Late Night with Conan O'Brien promoting the film.  Personal life  Ellison's first husband was Walter Carroll, who became the father of her daughter Mary. Mary wrestled briefly but decided against pursuing the profession. Ellison had six grandchildren. Ellison and Carroll divorced shortly after their daughter's birth. Later, Ellison married wrestler Johnny Long.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, pp. 55‚Äì57. Marital conflicts developed when Long wanted Ellison to be a housewife instead of a career woman. In addition, Ellison accused Long of being a \\"womanizer\\". Ellison and Long divorced. Ellison also says that she dated country singer Hank Williams for four months in 1952. According to Ellison, Williams proposed to her, but Williams's drinking and heroin abuse forced the couple to go separate ways. She further claimed that he wanted Ellison to quit her wrestling career, which she did not want to do. Two months after the breakup, Williams died due to an overdose.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, pp. 73‚Äì77. Later, Ellison met a wrestler named Buddy Lee, whom she regarded as the \\"love of her life.\\" They were eventually married, and after divorcing in 1970 after nine years of marriage, they remained friends until Lee's death in 1999.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, pp. 82‚Äì85. The divorce was attributed to Lee's affair with Rita Cortez, one of the wrestlers the duo was training.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, p. 118. In the early 1980s, Ellison opened Moolah's Hideaway, a bar and grill which was operated by her daughter Mary and frequented by Andr√© the Giant.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, pp. 159‚Äì160. Beginning in 1991, Ellison lived with Mae Young in a house in Columbia, South Carolina. Her estate was located on a road named Moolah Drive. A midget professional wrestler named Katie Glass also lived with Moolah for over forty years. Another wrestler, Donna Christanello, also lived with Ellison on-and-off for forty years, ending in May 1999.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, pp. 143‚Äì145. During her return to the ring in 1999, Ellison began experiencing occasional dizziness, and as a result, her doctor requested that she begin to wear a heart monitor.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, pp. 18‚Äì22. A few days later, Ellison was admitted to the hospital for what turned out to be two clogged arteries and viral pneumonia. She stayed at the intensive-care unit of the hospital for 24 days, during which she was unconscious for fifteen days. After leaving the hospital, she again slipped into unconsciousness in the bathroom at her home, crushing several vertebrae. She underwent successful back surgery in mid-December. =Death= Ellison's gravestone in Columbia, South Carolina Ellison died on November 2, 2007 at the age of 84 in Columbia, South Carolina. According to her daughter Mary, the possible cause of death was a heart attack or blood clot related to a recent shoulder replacement surgery. Ellison is buried in a grave plot at Greenlawn Memorial Park in Columbia, South Carolina. The plot appears to be a family plot designed for The Fabulous Moolah, her daughter Mary, Mae Young, Katie Glass, and add-ons for the rest of her family.

Together with NGC 4647, it forms a pair known as Arp 116. Messier 60 and the nearby elliptical galaxy Messier 59 were both discovered by Johann Gottfried Koehler in April 1779 during observations of a comet in the same part of the sky. Charles Messier added both to his catalogue about three days after Koehler's discovery.  Characteristics  This is an elliptical galaxy of type E1/2 (E1.5), although some sources class it as S0 ‚Äì a lenticular galaxy. An E2 class indicates a flattening of 20%, which has a nearly round appearance. The isophotes of the galaxy are boxy in shape, rather than simple ellipses. The mass-to-light ratio is a near constant 9.5 in the V (visual) band of the UBV system. The galaxy has an effective radius of (about 10 kpc), with an estimated mass of ~1012 within three times that radii, of which nearly half is dark matter. The mass estimated from X-ray emission is within 5 effective radii. = Supermassive black hole = At the center of M60 is a supermassive black hole (SMBH) of billion solar masses, one of the largest ever found. It is currently inactive. X-ray emission from the galaxy shows a cavity created by jets emitted by the hole during past active periods, which correspond to weak radio lobes. The power needed to generate these features is in the range .  Supernovae  In 2004, supernova SN 2004W was observed in Messier 60. It was a type 1a supernova located west and south of the nucleus.  Environment  M60 is the third-brightest giant elliptical galaxy of the Virgo cluster of galaxies, and is the dominant member of a subcluster of four galaxies, the M60 group, which is the closest-known isolated compact group of galaxies. It has several satellite galaxies, one of them being the ultracompact dwarf galaxy M60-UCD1, discovered in 2013. The motion of M60 through the intercluster medium is resulting in ram-pressure stripping of gas from the galaxy's outer halo, beyond a radius of 12 kpc. NGC 4647 appears approximately 2‚Ä≤.5 from Messier 60; the optical disks of the two galaxies overlap. Although this overlap suggests that the galaxies are interacting, photographic images of the two galaxies do not reveal any evidence for gravitational interactions between the two galaxies as would be suggested if the two galaxies were physically close to each other. This suggests that the galaxies are at different distances and are only weakly interacting if at all. However, studies with the Hubble Space Telescope show indications that a tidal interaction may have just begun.  Recession speed and distance estimations  Messier 60 was the fastest-moving galaxy included in Edwin Hubble's landmark 1929 paper concerning the relationship between recession speed and distance. He used a value of 1090 km/s for the recession speed, quite close to the more recent value of about 1110 km/s (based on a redshift of 0.003726). But he estimated the distance of Messier 60, as well as of the other three nebulas of the Virgo Cluster which he included (Messier 85, 49, and 87), to be only two million parsecs, rather than the accepted value today of around 16 million parsecs. These errors in distance led him to propose a \\"Hubble constant\\" of 500 km/s/Mpc, whereas the present estimate is around 70 km/s/Mpc.

It was discovered on June 7, 1771 by Charles Messier, then added to his catalogue in 1779. M62 is at a distance of about from Earth and from the Galactic center. It is among the ten most massive and luminous globular clusters in the Milky Way, showing an integrated absolute magnitude of ‚Äì9.18. The cluster has an estimated mass of and a mass- to-light ratio of in the V band. It has a projected ellipticity of 0.01, meaning is it essentially spherical. The density profile of the cluster members suggests it has not yet undergone core collapse. It has a core radius of , a half-mass radius of , and a half-light radius of . The stellar density at the core is per cubic parsec. It has a tidal radius of . The cluster shows at least two distinct populations of stars, which most likely represent two separate episodes of star formation. Of the main sequence stars in the cluster, are from the first generation and from the second. The second generation is polluted by materials released by the first. In particular, the abundances of helium, carbon, magnesium, aluminium, and sodium differ between the two populations. Indications are this is an Oosterhoff type I, or \\"metal- rich\\" system. A 2010 study identified 245 variable stars in the cluster's field, of which 209 are RR Lyrae variables, four are Type II Cepheids, 25 are long period variables, and one is an eclipsing binary. The cluster may prove to be the galaxy's richest in terms of RR Lyrae variables. It has six binary millisecond pulsars, including one (COM6266B) that is displaying eclipsing behavior from gas streaming off its companion. There are multiple X-ray sources, including 50 within the half-mass radius. 47 blue straggler candidates have been identified, formed from the merger of two stars in a binary system, and these are preferentially concentrated near the core region. It is hypothesized that this cluster may be host to an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH), and it is considered particularly suitable for searching for such an object. Examination of the proper motion of stars within of the core does not require an IMBH to explain. However, simulations can not rule out an IMBH with a mass of a few thousand . Based upon radial velocity measurements within an arcsecond of the core, Kiselev et al. (2008) made the claim that there is an IMBH with a mass in the range .

Licensed to Durham, North Carolina, United States, the station serves the Research Triangle area. The station is owned by Duke University. History 1950 - WDBS Student radio at Duke began in the late 1940s when the Undergraduate Men's Student Government Association formed a \\"radio council\\" to look into the possibility of establishing a campus radio station. Their efforts produced WDBS (Duke Broadcasting System), which signed on the air in 1950 on AM frequency 560. WDBS's offices and studios were located in the basement of the Gray building. It used carrier current AM in order to broadcast to the University's dorms and union building. With carrier current, wires are placed in these buildings, and any radio plugged into an outlet in one of the buildings could receive AM 560. In the 1950s, this was the state-of-the-art way to broadcast. The music shows featured hits of the day, as well as classical and jazz shows. The WDBS news and sports departments were nationally acclaimed, winning \\"Best College News Department\\" awards from 1956-1959. David Hartman, former host of \\"Good Morning America,\\" got his start at WDBS. WDBS continued its broadcasting during the student activism of the 1960s, with its music programming changing to reflect students' changing tastes. WDBS was the first station to initiate a program exchange with Radio Moscow. Each week, the two stations would air the other's show, with complete translation of news and editorial comments. This program brought with it a lot of interest from the CIA, and it was eventually stopped. While the WDBS sports staff was covering national championship teams, the news department was busy reporting on-campus events. The years 1967-69 were tumultuous ones on the Duke campus, and the WDBS news team was always there with live news coverage, even when the main quad was tear-gassed. In 1969, when student protesters took over both the Allen Building and the President's home, WDBS reporters were inside sending out the only live reports from the scene. WDBS also sent a reporter to the Republican and Democratic conventions in 1968; live reports were broadcast when Chicago police clashed with young demonstrators outside the Democratic convention hall. FM radio had begun to achieve popularity in the late 1960s, as students were attracted to the advantages of stereo radio. The management of WDBS did not want to be left behind with its now-outdated carrier current system. In 1969, WDBS managers and University officials began the search for an FM frequency. With a $200,000 loan from the University, WDBS purchased the frequency 107.1 from the near-bankrupt WSRC. WDBS-FM signed on as Duke's new radio station in May 1971. They moved the studios into the once-condemned Bivins Building on East Campus. In order to repay the loan, WDBS intended to operate as a commercial, profit-making station, while maintaining a student staff. However, the realities of commercial radio soon necessitated an entirely professional staff, as former student volunteers stayed on to become employees. By 1973, there was only a handful of student station members left, and WDBS was, for all practical purposes, no longer the Duke station. In the early years, WDBS attracted a substantial following in the Triangle. It was one of the first free-form album rock stations in the Southeast, and its reputation grew as it expanded its programming to include blocks of classical and jazz music every day. The early WDBS certainly defined \\"alternative\\" radio. WDBS was not without a major problem, though. The former students now managing it had no previous business experience, and in no time, WDBS was losing money by the truckload. The University continued to loan the station money just to meet its operating expenses. In the meantime, Duke students were without their own radio station. In the fall of 1974, with the help of WDBS and the University, a group of students resurrected the antiquated carrier current system, and turned an old classroom next door to the Bivins building into their studios. WDUR signed on the air at 1600 AM. 1974 - WDUR/WDUK WDUR received constant trouble from the old transmission system. The station's small budget prevented them from buying any new equipment, and the old system had been allowed to deteriorate. Only a few dorms could receive an acceptable signal. Station engineers spent much of their time repairing the old transmission wires, only to have them go out again before too long. WDUR's fortunes brightened during the 1975-76 school year when the station officially became a student activity, and began receiving funding from the Associated Students of Duke University (ASDU). Reception was improved, and the station set up a direct line to the CI. The station grew, and developed into a tight Top 40 format. \\"Duke Radio 16\\", as it was called, then added progressive rock and jazz shows, and a juke box named \\"Otto\\", which automatically played singles at night, keeping the station on the air 24 hours a day. Otto would insert taped messages to identify the station at regular intervals. This sort of operation was legal because of WDUR's carrier-current status; a regular broadcast station could not operate automatically under the law. During the summer of 1977, a local commercial station petitioned the FCC for the call letters WDUR. Since a carrier current station is unlicensed, and actually makes up its own call letters, the FCC granted the commercial station's request. The Duke station became WDUK. While all this was happening, WDBS continued to pile up a huge debt, losing much favor with the administration in the process. By 1978, this debt was said to be over $400,000. Progressive rock grew to make up half of WDUK's programming, but the continued weak reception prompted management to look into alternatives. The decision was made to research the possibility of going FM. 1980 ended with two significant announcements: an open frequency had been found for an FM station (88.7), and WDBS was moving off-campus, allowing WDUK to move into larger studios. Getting an FM station on the air is no trivial task: among other things, WDUK would need a large amount of funding, University support, an FCC license, and a place to put the transmitter. The decision on where to put the transmitter was pivotal. Due to nearby stations of 88.5 and 88.9, a new station on 88.7 would not be able to operate at a very high power level. If the transmitter were put on campus, it could operate at a couple of hundred watts of power, and could reach almost a hundred square miles. If the transmitter were put at a location in the Duke Forest in Hillsborough, NC, it could operate at over one thousand watts, and could reach over three hundred square miles. The latter option would be a gamble, however, as studies showed that reception on campus could turn out to be marginal. Enticed by the offer of a larger coverage area, the management decided to put the transmitter in Hillsborough, and an FCC application was prepared (a lengthy process). WDUK continued to operate, and by this time progressive rock had entirely taken over the station's programming. Disaster was to strike, though; in January 1982, just as WDBS had finally left and WDUK was getting ready to begin building its new studios, the 32-year-old transmission system died. The entire spring semester of 1982 was spent repairing the old transmitters. 1983 - WXDU WDUK was finally back on the air by the 82-83 school year. Situated in its new studios, the station fine tuned its progressive format in anticipation of going FM. As it turned out, the FCC acted surprisingly quickly on the University's application for an FM station, and on December 1, 1982, the University was notified that its request had been approved. Since a commercial station with the call letters WDUK already existed, the name of the station was changed to WXDU. With a resounding 98% vote, the student body approved a referendum allocating $76,000 of their activities fee for the construction of the new FM station. Vice President William Griffith, one of the original members of the student \\"radio council\\" that founded WDBS in the late 1940s, provided additional funding. As construction progressed, WDUK continued to get attention by being the only station in the country to provide live coverage of the Duke-Indiana NCAA soccer championship game. In October 1983, with the song \\"Station to Station\\" by David Bowie, WXDU signed on the air, and a new era of Duke radio had begun. As it turned out, coverage on campus was indeed marginal. In 1984, the station applied for and received FCC approval of an antenna change that would bring the station's Effective Radiated Power up to a level of 1600 watts. This improved coverage, but WXDU was still not providing adequate service to campus. During the 1986-87 school year, the management researched the possibility of putting an FM broadcast translator station on campus. A translator would pick up the station's main signal on 88.7, shift it to another frequency, and re-transmit it at a low power level. But because a translator could be located on the campus, this power level would be enough to provide excellent service to those who could not receive the station at all. The frequency 90.7 was chosen for the translator, and an FCC application was submitted in June 1987. The application for 1-watt translator W214AF (90.7 MHz), transmitting from the West Campus bell tower, was granted in September 1987, and the translator went on the air at the start of 1988. When North Carolina Central University received a license to build WNCU on 90.7 FM in the early 1990s, W214AF shifted to 103.5 as W278AB. It discontinued licensed operation in the early 2000s. Over the next five years, WXDU developed a national reputation for the progressive music it played, and the growing local music scene it promoted. During the 1992-93 school year, WXDU left the supervision of the student government and joined the Duke University Union. The move has allowed the station to grow in new and exciting ways. WXDU can now, for instance, sponsor concerts on campus at the Coffeehouse, and pool resources with other Union groups such as Cable 13 and Major Attractions. The move also brought much-needed financial support to WXDU, and has allowed the station to refurbish the dilapidated studio equipment and furniture. In the years since then WXDU has continued to flourish with the support of the Union. The station has maintained a national reputation for great music, and in the late 1990s/early 2000s (decade), the station's Country/Bluegrass/Folk programming has been noted on both the local and national levels. During Hurricane Fran in 1996, the WXDU tower collapsed and the station spent the next 2 years virtually off the air with a very limited signal. Through a series of benefits and through the generosity of the Duke Union, WXDU was able to raise a new tower, just east of highway 86, south of I-85, with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 2150 watts, at a height above average terrain of 77 meters, or 253 feet. The signal is also directional (see FCC engineering data below), with full power toward the northeast, and lower powers in other directions. It is lowest toward the southeast (between Durham and Chapel Hill), where the null is 1/3 the full power value, or about 716 watts. In 2018, WXDU moved to new, custom-designed studio space in the new Rubenstein Arts Center.  Management  WXDU is run and managed by an executive board of members who oversee all aspects of the radio station. Each year, WXDU holds elections and the DJ community has a say in electing their representatives. The roles within the executive board entail the General Manager, a position that is only eligible to students, Programming Director, Music Director, Non Musical Programming Director, Promotions Director, and DJ representative.  Specialty Shows  WXDU airs a variety of specialty shows that are managed by specific DJs. These shows are then open to all WXDU DJs, old and new, every week as an opportunity to learn about different types of music genres. * Close Up the Honky Tonks * Out There a Minute * Mondo Mundo * Funk Disco Dance Friday * Who's Got The Cuckoo?! * Indignity and Frustration References External links *WXDU.org *WXDU profile on RDU RadioWaves *Remembering WDBS *FCC engineering data *WXDU's MySpace page Duke University Mass media in Durham, North Carolina XDU XDU Radio stations established in 1950 ","title":"WXDU"},{"id":"964097","text":"Brian Jones in 1999 Brian George Jones (born 27 March 1947 in Bristol, England) is an English balloonist.

Construction Hull was launched by Harlan & Hollingsworth of Wilmington, Delaware, on 21 June 1902; sponsored by Miss Mabel Hull, a descendant of Commodore Hull; and commissioned on 20 May 1903, Lieutenant Samuel Robison in command. Pre-World War I During her first two years of service, Hull engaged in patrol and training maneuvers off Newport and in Chesapeake Bay. After a cruise to the Caribbean January‚ÄìApril 1905, she returned to League Island, Pennsylvania, where she decommissioned on 30 September. Hull recommissioned on 14 November 1906 at Philadelphia, and took part in winter exercises with fleet units in Cuban waters. After operations off Newport, the ship returned to Norfolk in October 1907 to prepare for the voyage of the \\"Great White Fleet\\". Hull sailed as an escort vessel on 2 December and after stopping at many South American and Central American ports on the voyage around South America with the great battleships, arrived San Diego on 28 April 1907. Hull was detached on the west coast, and the Great White Fleet continued on its cruise, showing the flag around the world. The destroyer remained in the vicinity of San Francisco until departing on 24 August 1908 for a cruise to the South Pacific. She took part in various exercises in Hawaiian and Samoan waters before returning to San Diego in November. World War I Hull spent the years before World War I on patrol and training exercises off the California coast. She decommissioned on 30 October 1912 and joined the Reserve Torpedo Division at Mare Island, with which she made occasional training cruises to California ports. When America entered the war in April 1917, Hull was being refitted at Mare Island. She sailed with other destroyers for the Panama Canal Zone on 25 April and for the next three months was engaged in defensive patrol off the western approaches to that vital waterway. She sailed to Norfolk on 26 July for escort and patrol duty along the East Coast. In the months that followed, Hull escorted ships to Bermuda and engaged in training maneuvers with other ships of the fleet as well. In June 1918, she broke up an attack by German submarine U-151 on a merchant ship, and often rescued sailors from sinking ships. She continued this vital ocean patrol duty until the end of the war. Hull arrived at Philadelphia on 29 January 1919, and decommissioned on 7 July. She was sold on 5 January 1921 to Joseph G. Hitner of Philadelphia.

M63 was first discovered by the French astronomer Pierre M√©chain, then later verified by his colleague Charles Messier on June 14, 1779. The galaxy became listed as object 63 in the Messier Catalogue. In the mid-19th century, Anglo-Irish astronomer Lord Rosse identified spiral structures within the galaxy, making this one of the first galaxies in which such structure was identified. The shape or morphology of this galaxy has a classification of SAbc, indicating a spiral form with no central bar feature (SA) and moderate to loosely wound arms (bc). There is a general lack of large scale continuous spiral structure in visible light, so it is considered a flocculent galaxy. However, when observed in the near infrared, a symmetric, two-arm structure is seen. Each arm wraps 150¬∞ around the galaxy and extends out to from the nucleus. M63 is a weakly active galaxy with a LINER nucleus ‚Äì short for 'low-ionization nuclear emission-line region'. This displays as an unresolved source at the galactic nucleus that is cloaked in a diffuse emission. The latter is extended along a position angle of 110¬∞ relative to the north celestial pole, and both soft X-rays and hydrogen (H-alpha) emission can be observed coming from along nearly the same direction. The existence of a super massive black hole (SMBH) at the nucleus is uncertain; if it does exist, then the mass is estimated as , or around 850 million times the mass of the Sun. Radio observations at the 21-cm hydrogen line show the gaseous disk of M63 extends outward to a radius of , well past the bright optical disk. This gas shows a symmetrical form that is warped in a pronounced manner, starting at a radius of . The form suggests a dark matter halo that is offset with respect to the inner region. The reason for the warp is unclear, but the position angle points toward the smaller companion galaxy, UGC 8313. The distance to M63, based upon the luminosity-distance measurement is . The radial velocity relative to the Local Group yields an estimate of . Estimates based on the Tully-Fisher relation range over . The tip of the red- giant branch technique gives a distance of . M63 is part of the M51 Group, a group of galaxies that also includes M51 (the 'Whirlpool Galaxy'). In 1971, a supernova with a magnitude of 11.8 appeared in one of the arms of M63. It was discovered May 24, 1971 and reached peak light around May 26. The spectrum of is consistent with a supernova of type I. However, the spectroscopic behavior appeared anomalous.

Opened in 1930, the San Remo is described by Glen Justice of the New York Times as \\"a dazzling two-tower building with captivating views of Central Park.\\" As a housing cooperative, its board has a reputation for \\"lenient admissions standards\\" compared to the conservative, old-money boards on the other side of the park.  Apartments  When the San Remo was originally designed, it had a wide range of luxurious apartment configurations. The apartments were accessed from opulent twin lobbies which contained terrazzo floors, marble walls and custom light fixtures of bronze and frosted glass. The building has two addresses, 145 and 146 Central Park West, because the building was designed so that each half of the structure is served by separate lobbies, eliminating the need for long hallways across the main floor. There are still some doctor's offices on the first floor, but several of the professional/commercial spaces have recently been sold to tenants who reside in the building for use as office space. = Base = The average apartment contained eight rooms spread over about . Ten and eleven foot ceilings were the norm. As originally designed, the lower 14 floors were typically divided into seven apartments ‚Äì two on each of the side street wings of the building and three laid out along the front of the building facing Central Park West. There are numerous setbacks built into the far ends of each wing of the building, allowing for terraces for several of the units. The original layout of the Park-facing units was unusual; most full-block buildings on the avenue divided the park frontage into four units, not three. This allowed the San Remo's apartments to have very generous frontage along the park in addition to typically spacious interior layouts. The largest units on these lower levels are the \\"C-line\\" units, which occupy the southeast corner of each floor. The C-line apartments contain living rooms, libraries and dining rooms all facing the park. C-line apartments typically had four bedrooms arranged along the 74th Street (south) side of the building. These units are approximately in total. Above the 14th floor, the building began a series of setbacks, which allowed for terraces for the various units from floors 14 through 17. These units were typically larger floor space, with larger rooms, than the units on the lower floors. The building has twin terrazzo and marble lobbies and terracotta embellishments. = Towers = The San Remo seen from west At the 18th floor, the building splits into the San Remo's iconic 10-floor towers, inspired by the drum of the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates The towers culminate in Renaissance-style Corinthian temples crowned by 22-foot-high copper lanterns.Nash, Eric Peter., and Norman McGrath. Manhattan Skyscrapers. New York: Princeton Architectural, 1999. Print. The innovative twin tower design inspired imitators over the years, including The Majestic, The Century, The Eldorado and‚Äîmost recently‚Äîthe Time Warner Center. In the north tower of the building there are two apartments per floor of approximately . These are typically two-bedroom units, with all of the public rooms facing the park. The floors of the south tower are slightly larger, and these apartments as originally designed were all duplexed units. In total, these two-story units were approximately , rivaling the apartments in the best buildings of Fifth and Park Avenues (e.g., 834 Fifth Avenue), which typically range from . The San Remo's south tower units have their public rooms on the lower level. The public rooms include (36' x 22') living rooms, (14' x 20.5') libraries, and (17' x 24') dining rooms. There are also a breakfast room, kitchen, and several servants‚Äô rooms on this level. A semi-circular staircase leads past windows facing the park to the second level. Upstairs are four bedrooms, including a master suite with a bedroom of , and a large dressing room and bathroom, for a total of over , and additional servants' rooms. A separate back staircase connects the rear portion of the apartments, linking the servants' areas. = Residents = Past and present residents of the building include such famous personalities as James Levine, Barry Manilow, Fred Ebb, Stephen Sondheim, Cesar Pelli, Diana Balmori, Tiger Woods, Steven Spielberg, Donna Karan, Tony Randall, Demi Moore, Glenn Close, Dustin Hoffman, Steve Martin, Bruce Willis, Eddie Cantor, Robert Stigwood, Jennifer Rush, Marshall Brickman, Jackie Leo, Don Hewitt, Dodi Fayed, Andrew Tobias, Aaron Spelling, Diane Keaton, Mary Tyler Moore, and Hedy Lamarr. Rita Hayworth spent her last years there, in a unit beside that of her daughter, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan. Steve Jobs bought and renovated a penthouse apartment but never lived in it, ultimately selling it to U2 singer Bono. In 1985, Madonna applied to buy an apartment in the building but was rejected by the residents board. In 2007, Bono instigated a dispute with several neighbors, including Billy Squier, over damage from fireplace smoke. On December 23, 2013, philanthropist Robert Wilson committed suicide by jumping from his 16th floor apartment in the South Tower.  History  Between 1890 and 1929, the current site of the San Remo, at West 75th Street, was occupied by an apartment hotel of the same name, which was demolished to make way for the present building.\\"New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, UPPER WEST SIDE/CENTRAL PARK WEST HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGNATION REPORT VOLUME I: ESSAYS/ARCHITECTS' APPENDIX,\\" April 24, 1990, pp. 22, 52-53 The current building's architect, Emery Roth, took advantage of new zoning regulations to build the first of New York's twin towered apartment blocks.Brockmann, Jorg et al. (2002). Each of San Remo's ten-story towers is topped with an English Baroque mansion in the manner of John Vanbrugh and capped with a homage to the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates. The Athenian monument was known to Roth from the reproduction that had featured in the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, 1893. Roth also designed The Beresford and other landmark apartment houses and office blocks in New York. Construction began in 1929, weeks before the market crash initiated the Great Depression. The San Remo's construction process took approximately two years. In 1940 both buildings were sold for $25,000 over the existing mortgages. = The Great Depression = During the Great Depression, many of the larger units in the building were subdivided to make them easier to rent. All but one of the south tower two story apartments were divided into single floor units. Many of the larger C-line and E-line (northeast corner) units were also divided into smaller units. As a result, the total number of apartments in the building was expanded by approximately 20 units. = Conversion to a cooperative = San Remo after a snowstormThe San Remo is now one of the most desirable and expensive apartment buildings in Manhattan. It converted to a co-op in the 1970s, meaning that tenants in the apartments are actually shareholders in the corporation that owns the building. Owning shares entitles one to reside in a particular unit. Purchasing apartments (shares) in the building is a significant investment. Recent asking prices have ranged from a minimum of $3 million to a high of $75 million. The most desirable apartments (large units with Park views or tower floors) are typically valued at $2,500‚Äì$3,500 per square foot. The San Remo has consistently achieved the highest sale prices per unit on Central Park West, and is the top co-op building in terms of price per square foot on the Upper West Side, attaining prices of almost $5,400 per square foot for its penthouse units. Many purchasers over the years have combined their units. Steven Spielberg combined two Park-facing units on the 16th floor into a unit with terraces. A unit was reportedly sold to professional golfer Tiger Woods for $28 million in April 2008. Dustin Hoffman recently sold his unit. The 27th floor (top floor) of the north tower has been combined into a portion of the former mechanical space above it, creating a unique two-story unit. In total, the apartment has of interior space and of terraces. This unit was purchased by Bono from Steve Jobs for $15 million. Demi Moore owns the last remaining south tower two-story unit, at the very top of this tower. Moore and then-husband Bruce Willis purchased the apartment in 1987 from Robert Stigwood.http://www.cooperator.com/articles/1328/1/Celebrity- Appeal/Page1.html. This unit was combined into a portion of the tower's mechanical and storage space above it (similar to the top floor unit in the north tower), creating a three-story unit with over of interior space, multiple terraces and 360-degree views from all floors. As of May 2015, Moore was trying to sell the unit with an asking price of $75 million. Demi Moore is reported to have finally sold her south tower penthouse apartment for $45 million in May 2017, a $30 million reduction from the original asking price. This represents the highest price ever paid for a coop apartment on the Upper West Side in Manhattan.  Notes   References  * Brockmann, Jorg and Bill Harris. (2002). One Thousand New York Buildings.

It was discovered by Charles Messier in 1780. Along with M66 and NGC 3628, M65 forms the Leo Triplet, a small group of galaxies. Discovery M65 was discovered by Charles Messier and included in his Messier Objects list. However, William Henry Smyth accidentally attributed the discovery to Pierre M√©chain in his popular 19th-century astronomical work A Cycle of Celestial Objects (stating \\"They [M65 and M66] were pointed out by M√©chain to Messier in 1780\\"). This error was in turn picked up by Kenneth Glyn Jones in Messier's Nebulae and Star Clusters. This has since ramified into a number of other books by a variety of authors. Star formation The galaxy is low in dust and gas, and there is little star formation in it, although there has been some relatively recently in the arms. The ratio of old stars to new stars is correspondingly quite high. In most wavelengths it is quite uninteresting, though there is a radio source visible in the NVSS, offset from the core by about two arc- minutes. The identity of the source is uncertain, as it has not been identified visually, or formally studied in any published papers.

Interaction with other galaxies To the eye, M65's disk appears slightly warped, and its relatively recent burst of star formation is also suggestive of some external disturbance. Rots (1978) suggests that the two other galaxies in the Leo Triplet interacted with each other about 800 million years ago. Recent research by Zhiyu Duan suggests that M65 may also have interacted, though much less strongly. He also notes that M65 may have a central bar‚Äîit is difficult to tell because the galaxy is seen from an oblique angle‚Äîa feature which is suggestive of tidal disruption.

The Battle of Orsha was part of a long series of Muscovite‚ÄìLithuanian Wars conducted by Muscovite rulers striving to gather all the former Kievan Rus' lands under their rule. According to Rerum Moscoviticarum Commentarii by Sigismund von Herberstein, the primary source for information on the battle, the much smaller army of Lithuania-Poland (under 30,000 men) defeated a force of 80,000 Muscovite soldiers, capturing their camp and commander. These numbers and proportions have been disputed by some modern historians. Eve of battle At the end of 1512, the Grand Duchy of Moscow began a new war for the Grand Duchy of Lithuania's Ruthenian lands in present-day Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine. Albrecht I, Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, rebelled and refused to give a vassal pledge to Sigismund I the Old of Poland-Lithuania, as required by the Second Peace of Thorn (1466). Albrecht I was supported by Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor. The fortress of Smolensk was then the easternmost outpost of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and one of the most important strongholds guarding it from the east. It repelled several Muscovite attacks, but in July 1514 a Muscovite army besieged and finally captured it. Spurred on by this initial success, the Grand Prince of Moscow Vasili III ordered his forces farther into present-day Belarus, occupying the towns of Krichev, Mstislavl, and Dubrovna. Meanwhile, Sigismund the Old gathered some 35,000 troops for war with his eastern neighbor. This army was inferior in numbers, but consisted mostly of well- trained cavalry. The forces of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland placed under the command of Hetman Konstanty Ostrogski included 16,000 Lithuanian cavalry, 14,000 Polish cavalry (light and heavy), 3,000 Polish mercenary infantry, and 2,500 volunteers, mostly from Bohemia. Sigismund left 4,000‚Äì5,000 men in the town of Barysau, while the main force, around 30,000 strong, moved on to face the Muscovites. At the end of August, several skirmishes took place at the crossings of the Berezina, Bobr, and Drut Rivers, but the Muscovite army avoided a major confrontation. Suffering negligible losses, the Muscovites advanced to the area between Orsha and Dubrovno on the Krapivna River, where they set up camp. Ivan Chelyadnin, confident that the Lithuanian-Polish forces would have to cross one of the two bridges on the Dnieper River, split his own forces to guard those crossings. However, Ostrogski's army crossed the river farther north via two pontoon bridges. On the night of 7 September, the Lithuanian-Polish army began preparations for a final battle with the Muscovites. Hetman Konstantyn Ostrogski placed most of his 16,000 horses from the Grand Duchy in the center, while most of the Polish infantry and the auxiliary troops manned the flanks. The Bohemian and Silesian infantry were deployed in the center of the line, in front of the reserves comprising Lithuanian and Polish cavalry. =The size of the Muscovite army= Russo-Polish war, image from Jacob Piso Die Schlacht von dem Kunig von Poln und mit dem Moscowiter, 1514 The size of the Muscovite army remains an unsolved question. Narrative Lithuanian-Polish sources generally give large numbers.

Extant Polish and Lithuanian documents, however, list all captured nobles by name; only 611 men in all. The Polish historian Bohun considers it improvident to rely on what he terms \\"propaganda data\\" given by Sigismund.Bohun T. Bitwa pod Orsza 08.09.1514 // Rzeczpospolita. 2006. ¬π 4/20. S. 13. Gembarowicz (another Polish researcher) is of the opinion that the Muscovite army was about 40,000 strong. It also remains unclear why - if the figure of 70,000‚Äì80,000 men is to be trusted - King Sigismund (who knew about this superiority of the Muscovite army from Mikhail Glinsky's letters) kept a personal guard of about 5,000 men (about 15% of his army) in reserve, without sending them into the battle. The Muscovite chronicles (Novgorodian and Sophian codexes) claim a Lithuanian-Polish numerical superiority. The Russian historian A.

On 8 September, shortly after dawn, Ivan Chelyadnin gave the order to attack. The Muscovite forces attempted to outflank the Lithuanians and Poles by attacking their flanks, which were manned by Polish, Lithuanian light hussar, and Tartar troops. One of the pincers of the attack was commanded by Chelyadnin personally, while the other was led by Prince Bulgakov-Golitsa. The initial attack failed, and the Muscovites withdrew toward their starting positions. Chelyadnin was still confident that the odds, almost 3:1 in his favor, would give him the victory. However, preoccupied with his own wing of the Muscovite forces, he lost track of the other sectors and failed to coordinate a defense against the counterattack by the Lithuanian light and Polish heavy cavalry, which until then had been kept in reserve. The Lithuanian and Polish light horse and Tartars attacked the overstretched center of the Muscovite lines in an attempt to split them. At the crucial moment the Lithuanian-Polish cavalry seemed to waver, then went into retreat. The Muscovites pursued with all their cavalry reserves. The Lithuanian Tartars and Polish cavalry, after retreating for several minutes under chase from the Russians, suddenly turned to the sides. The Muscovite cavalry now found themselves confronted by artillery concealed in the forest. From both sides, Polish and Lithuanian forces appeared and proceeded to surround the Muscovites. Ivan Chelyadnin sounded retreat, which soon became somewhat panicked. The Muscovite forces were pursued by the army of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania for five kilometres. The Muscovite defeat is often attributed to repeated failures by Ivan Chelyadnin and Golitsa to coordinate their operations. Sigismund von Herberstein reported that 40,000 Muscovites were killed. According to accounts in Polish chronicles, 30,000 Russians were killed and an additional 3,000 were taken captive, including Ivan Chelyadnin and eight other commanders. The forces of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Kingdom of Poland seized the Muscovite camp and all 300 cannons. Upset at word of the massive defeat, Grand Prince Vasili III allegedly remarked that \\"the prisoners [were] as useful as the dead\\". Aftermath Polish Hussars during the Battle of Orsha (1514) Ostrogski's forces continued their pursuit of the routed Russian army and retook most of the previously captured strongholds, including Mstislavl and Krychev, and the advancement of the Russians was stopped for four years. However, the Lithuanian and Polish forces were too exhausted to besiege Smolensk before the winter. This meant that Ostrogski did not reach the gates of Smolensk until late September, giving Vasili III enough time to prepare defense. In December, Hetman Konstanty Ostrogski triumphantly entered Vilnius. To commemorate the victory, two Orthodox churches were erected: the Church of the Holy Trinity and the Church of Saint Nicholas, which remain among the most impressive examples of Orthodox Church architecture in Lithuania. Immediately after the victory, the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian state started to exploit the battle for its propaganda aimed at other nations in Europe, with the intent of improving the image of Poland- Lithuania abroad. Several panegyrical accounts of the battle were sent to Rome. \\"The Polish message was similar to Bomhover's: the Muscovites are not Christians; they are cruel and barbaric; they are Asians and not Europeans; they are in league with Turks and the Tatars to destroy Christendom\\". Impressed by the scope of the Lithuanian and Polish victory, Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, started peace negotiations with the Jagiellons in Vienna. On 22 July 1515, final agreements for peace were made and the broad coalition against Lithuania and Poland ceased. The war between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Grand Duchy of Moscow lasted until 1520. In 1522 a peace was signed, under the terms of which Lithuania was forced to cede to Moscow about a quarter of its possessions within the lands of the former Kievan Rus', including Smolensk. The latter city was not retaken until almost a century later, in 1611. After the peace agreement of 1522, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania tried to attack Moscow one more time, but major military conflicts were settled for around 40 years. Modern times The battle is regarded by Belarusians as a symbol of national revival, with many seeing it as a Day of Belarusian Military Glory. On 8 September 1992, the 478th anniversary of the battle, cadets from Minsk Higher Military Engineering School and the Minsk Higher Military Command School (now the unified Military Academy of Belarus) took the first military oath of allegiance to the Armed Forces of Belarus, with their induction ceremony being held on Independence Square in the presence of defense minister Pavel Pavlovich Kozlovsky.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lMs_c10EUchttps://charter97.org/ru/news/2017/9/8/262281/https://charter97.org/ru/news/2017/9/8/262248/ Despite attempts at reviving the state's earlier stance on the battle, its significance is being suppressed by state authorities. In September 2005, by order of President Alexander Lukashenko, four members of the Belarusian National Front opposition were each fined almost 4 million rubles (roughly ‚Ç¨1,500) for celebrating the 491st anniversary of the battle. The Battle of Orsha is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw, with the inscription \\"ORSZA 8 IX 1514\\". Popular culture On the BBC television program Being Human, Hal Yorke was made a vampire after the Battle of Orsha. Legacy In 1514, in appreciation for the victory in the battle, Konstanty Ostrogski built the Church and monastery of Holy Trinity in Vilnius. References External links * Cherkas, B. Battle of Orsha.

The election marked the first time that the 196th district was fought on its present boundaries; following the 1990 census, the approved legislative reapportionment plan moved it out of Philadelphia, and into its present boundaries. He took office on January 5, 1993, and left on November 30, 2000.Per Article II, Section 2 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, the legislative session ended on November 30, 2000. U.S. House of Representatives =Elections= While in Congress, Platts refused to accept contributions from any special interests or political action committees. ;2000 Platts was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2000, after winning a little over half the vote in a crowded Republican primary, and easily defeating college professor Jeff Sanders, the Democratic nominee, in the general election. He replaced Congressman Bill Goodling, who chose not to run for re-election that year. ;2002‚Äì2006 Platts ran unopposed by the Democratic Party during the 2002 and 2004 elections, although in 2002, he faced opposition in the Republican primary, most notably from Tom Glennon. He faced York College professor and decorated Vietnam Veteran Phil Avillo, Jr., the Democratic nominee, and Derf Maitland of the Green Party in the 2006 election. Platts won 64% of the vote to Avillo's 33% and Maitland's 3%. ;2008 * United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2008#District 19 In 2008, Platts and Avillo faced off again. With 67% of the vote, Platts became the most electorally successful Republican Congressional candidate in the Northeast. ;2010 * United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2010#District 19 Platts was challenged by Democratic nominee Ryan Sanders and Independent Patriots nominee Joshua Monighan. Platts was re- elected to a sixth term with 72% of the vote. =Tenure= As a Congressman, Platts supported many of President George W. Bush's initiatives, tax cuts, drilling in ANWR, the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan, the Iraq War, and a ban on same-sex marriage. He opposed any version of Bush's school voucher proposal, supported offshore oil drilling, supported increasing government regulated fuel efficiency standards for automobiles, voted for the Matthew Shepard Act, a hate crimes prevention bill, and supported the McCain-Feingold campaign finance legislation. In 2006, the National Journal political index describes him as having a moderate voting record despite the relatively conservative nature of his district, although the district does include some exurbs of Baltimore, Maryland. That journal gave him \\"conservative\\" ratings of 53% (economy), 65% (social issues) and 73% (foreign policy) in the 2004 congress. Platts' district went 64‚Äì36 for Bush in 2004. He has broken with his party on several issues, for example supporting President Obama's expansion of SCHIP and the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act. He is a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership and supports stem-cell research. Early in his political career, after his initial election to the Pennsylvania House, Platts supported abortion rights. However, he later changed his views and became anti-abortion. He remains so to this day, and he has a pro-life voting record as a Congressman. Platts has consistently voted against bail-outs of the financial industry and the automakers. He also voted against the economic stimulus legislation, the fiscal year 2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act, and fiscal year 2010 Budget Resolution. Platts was one of fifteen Republican House members to vote in favor of repealing the United States military's \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\" ban on openly gay service members. Along with nearly all other Republican members of the US House of Representatives, Mr. Platts voted to support The Path to Prosperity, the budget put forward by U.S. Representative Paul Ryan (R-WI). However, the next year he joined nine other Republicans in voting against Rep. Ryan's budget. =Committee assignments= ;Caucus Memberships * Congressional Arts Caucus Post-congressional career In 2013, Platts announced that he was running for a seat on the York County Court of Common Pleas. In a poll conducted by the York County Bar Association, 77% of its members responded that they believed Platts to be \\"not qualified\\" to serve on the bench. Platts and incumbent judge Mike Flannelly, also a Republican, who was appointed to the seat in 2012 following the death of Judge Chuck Patterson, both cross-filed to run in both the Democratic and Republican primary elections. Platts won the Republican primary 56%‚Äì44%, while Flannelly won the Democratic primary by the same margin. Platts and Flannelly faced each other again in the general election in November, which Platts won with 58% of the vote, to serve a ten-year term.

Its core product line were motherboards aimed at the overclocker market. Abit experienced serious financial problems in 2005. The brand name \\"ABIT\\" and other intangible properties, including patents and trademarks, were acquired by Universal Scientific Industrial Co., Ltd. (USI) in May 2006. The parent firm closed the brand as of 31 March 2009. Classic ABIT Logo  History  ABIT was founded in 1989. In 1991, they had become the fastest growing motherboard manufacturer, claiming US$10 million in sales. In 2000, ABIT underwent an initial public offering (IPO) on the TAIEX stock exchange. To keep pace with their \\"good\\" sales figures, they opened a factory in Suzhou, China, and moved to new headquarters in Neihu, Taipei. The number of motherboards sold was claimed to have doubled between 2000 and 2001. Abit chose to outsource two low-end boards for trial production from June 2002 to Elitegroup Computer Systems. Confirmation of the outsourcing move was made public in July 2002, accounting for 10% of Abit‚Äôs motherboard shipments for the first model, and by August 2002, this would increase to 15-20% for the second model, for the company‚Äôs niche products, such as servers and routers, Abit's factory in Taoyuan, Taiwan factory will then serve as their base. Abit had somewhat of a blow in March 2003, when Oskar Wu, a leading engineer on the famous Abit NF7-S motherboard, resigned after the NForce series to become head of the LANParty range at competitor DFI. On 15 December 2004, the Taiwan Stock Exchange downgraded ABIT's stock due to questionable accounting practices. Investigations revealed that the majority of their import/export business was conducted through seven companies, all located at the same address and each of which had a capital of only HK$2. This made it easy to inflate the reported number of motherboards sold. The Hong Kong media also reported that the management was being investigated for embezzling funds from the company. In June 2005, ABIT partnered with Wan Hai Industries. This container shipping company, also a principal investor in China Airlines, brought the company much needed capital, since the company had financial problems at this time, partly due to a class action lawsuit involving faulty capacitors on their products, but also because of marketing highly technical products to the general public while offering longer-than-average warranties and generous return policies. On 25 January 2006, ABIT announced that USI intended to purchase ABIT Computer's motherboard business and brand and announced a special shareholders meeting to discuss the sale of ABIT's Neihu building, changing ABIT's company name, the disposition of the company's assets, and the release of the directors from non-competition restrictions. ABIT sold its own office building in Taipei to Deutsche Bank in order to raise money to cut its debt. Following USI's acquisition of the motherboard business, the remaining divisions of ABIT switched to distributing components and networking products, while using its Suzhou, China plant only to offer some motherboard contract manufacturing services. The acquired motherboard business and the 'ABIT' brand name were used by USI under the new brand name Universal abit. In the US, it was known as Universal abit USA Corporation. The old company, ABIT Computer Corporation (USA), is now dissolved and is no longer in existence. Universal Abit later announced that it would close on 31 December 2008, and officially cease to exist on 1 January 2009. By 2009, Abit no longer sold motherboards. Universal Abit was located in Neihu, Taiwan with regional offices in the China, USA, Iran and the Netherlands.  Technical achievements  ABIT had a reputation among PC enthusiasts for producing motherboards that support overclocking. In the late 1990s, the company introduced their Softmenu feature, one of the first jumperless CPU configuration systems that enable overclocking to be adjusted from the BIOS instead of fiddling with jumpers. Softmenu was later extended with the development of the ŒºGuru chip. ŒºGuru is a custom microprocessor on Abit motherboards which, in conjunction with Abit software, gives the ability to modify overclocking settings in realtime while the OS is running. By providing instant feedback on the results of a particular overclock setting, ŒºGuru reduced the time required to discover optimal settings. ŒºGuru provided a special connector for a panel in a 5¬º\\" drive bay to display speed and voltage settings. They were also one of the first motherboard manufacturers to enable undervolting. ABIT was the first motherboard manufacturer to introduce 133 MHz FSB operation for the Intel BX chipset with the aptly named AB-BX133. ABIT also achieved symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) operation for Intel's Mendocino Celeron CPU, in their BP6 motherboard. This was an achievement because Intel had blocked SMP operation in the Celeron. In 2004, they introduced the OTES cooling system. This heat pipe based cooling system is intended to transfer heat from the chipset or the motherboard's voltage regulators and expel it out of the system through the rear I/O panel. During Computex 2008, Universal abit unveiled the FunFab P80 Digital Photo Frame and Printer. It integrated a photo printer directly to a mobile phone.

She was banished for her refusal to appear at the king's banquet to show her beauty as the king wished, and Esther was chosen to succeed her as queen. In the Midrash, Vashti is described as wicked and vain. She is viewed as an independent-minded heroine in feminist interpretations of the Purim story. Attempts to identify her as one of the Persian royal consorts mentioned in other historical records remain speculative.  In the Book of Esther  In the Book of Esther, Vashti is the first wife of King Ahasuerus. While the king holds a magnificent banquet for his princes, nobles and servants, she holds a separate banquet for the women. On the seventh day of the banquet, when the king's heart was \\"merry with wine\\", the king orders his seven chamberlains to summon Vashti to come before him and his guests wearing her royal crown, in order to display her beauty. Vashti refuses to come, and the king becomes angry. He asks his advisers how Vashti should be punished for her disobedience. His adviser Memucan tells him that Vashti has wronged not only the king, but also all of the husbands of Persia, whose wives may be encouraged by Vashti's actions to disobey. Memucan encourages Ahasuerus to dismiss Vashti and find another queen. Ahasuerus takes Memucan's advice, and sends letters to all of the provinces that men should dominate in their households. Ahasuerus subsequently chooses Esther as his queen to replace Vashti.Yosef Marcus, Megillah with In- Depth Commentary‚ÄîSide by Side Version, chabad.org. King Ahaseurus's command for the appearance of Queen Vashti is interpreted by several midrashic sources as an order to appear unclothed for the attendees of the king's banquet.Yalkut Shimoni Esther 1049, Esther Rabbah 4, Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer 48  Historical identification  The wrath of Ahasuerus (anonymous), Rijksmuseum Because the text lacks any references to known events, some historians believe that the narrative of Esther is fictional, and the name Ahasuerus is used to refer to a fictionalized Xerxes I, in order to provide an aetiology for Purim. Some historians additionally argue that, because the Persian kings did not marry outside a handful of Persian noble families, it is unlikely that there was a Jewish queen Esther and that in any case the historical Xerxes's queen was Amestris. That being said, many Jews believe the story to be a true historical event, especially Persian Jews who have a close relationship to Esther. In the Septuagint, the Book of Esther refers to this king as 'Artaxerxes' (). In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Bible commentators attempted to identify Vashti with Persian queens mentioned by the Greek historians. Traditional sources identify Ahasuerus with Artaxerxes II of Persia. Jacob Hoschander, supporting the traditional identification, suggested that Vashti may be identical to a wife of Artaxerxes mentioned by Plutarch, named Stateira.Jacob Hoschander, The Book of Esther in the Light of History, Oxford University Press, 1923 Upon the discovery of the equivalence of the names Ahasuerus and Xerxes, some Bible commentators began to identify Ahasuerus with Xerxes I and Vashti with the wife named Amestris mentioned by Herodotus.\\"The Religious Policy of Xerxes and the 'Book of Esther'\\", Littman, Robert J., The Jewish Quarterly Review, 65.3, January 1975, p.145‚Äì148.  Meaning of the name  The meaning of the name Vashti is uncertain. As a modern Persian name it is understood to mean \\"goodness\\" but most likely it originated from the reconstructed Old Persian *vai≈°tƒ´, related to the superlative adjective vahi≈°ta- \\"best, excellent\\" found in the Avesta, with the feminine termination -ƒ´; hence \\"excellent woman, best of women\\". Hoschander proposed that it originated as a shortening of an unattested \\"vashtateira\\", which he also proposed as the origin of the name \\"Stateira\\". Hitchcock's Bible Names Dictionary of the 19th century, attempting to interpret the name as Hebrew, suggested the meanings \\"that drinks\\" or \\"thread\\". Critics of the historicity of the book of Esther proposed that the name may have originated from a conjectured Elamite goddess whom they called \\"Mashti\\". Vashti is one of a very few proper names in the Tanakh that begins with the letter waw, and by far the most prominently mentioned of them. Hebrew names that begin with waw are rare because of the etymological tendency for word-initial waw to become yodh.  In the Midrash  According to the Midrash, Vashti was the great-granddaughter of King Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon, the granddaughter of King Amel-Marduk and the daughter of King Belshazzar. During Vashti's father's rule, mobs of Medes and Persians attacked. They murdered Belshazzar that night. Vashti, unknowing of her father's death, ran to her father's quarters. There she was kidnapped by King Darius of Persia. But Darius took pity on her and gave her to his son, Ahasuerus, to marry. Based on Vashti's descent from a king who was responsible for the destruction of the temple as well as on her unhappy fate, the Midrash presents Vashti as wicked and vain. Since Vashti is ordered to appear before the king on the seventh day of the feast, the rabbis argued that Vashti enslaved Jewish women and forced them to work on the Sabbath. They attribute her unwillingness to appear before the king and his drinking partners not to modesty, but rather to an affliction with a disfiguring illness. One account relates that she suffered from leprosy, while another states that the angel Gabriel came and \\"fixed a tail on her.\\" The latter possibility is often interpreted as \\"a euphemism for a miraculous transformation to male anatomy.\\" According to the Midrashic account, Vashti was a clever politician, and the ladies' banquet that she held in parallel to Ahasuerus' banquet represented an astute political maneuver. Since the noble women of the kingdom would be present at her banquet, she would have control of a valuable group of hostages in case a coup d'√©tat occurred during the king's feast.  As a feminist icon  Vashti's refusal to obey the summons of her drunken husband has been admired as heroic in many feminist interpretations of the Book of Esther. Early feminists admired Vashti's principle and courage. Harriet Beecher Stowe called Vashti's disobedience the \\"first stand for woman's rights.\\" Elizabeth Cady Stanton wrote that Vashti \\"added new glory to [her] day and generation...by her disobedience; for 'Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.'\\" Some more recent feminist interpreters of the Book of Esther compare Vashti's character and actions favorably to those of her successor, Esther, who is traditionally viewed as the heroine of the Purim story. Michele Landsberg, a Canadian Jewish feminist, writes: \\"Saving the Jewish people was important, but at the same time [Esther's] whole submissive, secretive way of being was the absolute archetype of 1950s womanhood. It repelled me. I thought, 'Hey, what's wrong with Vashti? She had dignity. She had self- respect. She said: 'I'm not going to dance for you and your pals.'\\"  Popular culture  * Vashti is the name of one of the principal characters in E. M.

So, a function f : I ‚Üí R admits œâ as a modulus of continuity if and only if :f(x)-f(y)\\\\leq\\\\omega(x-y), for all x and y in the domain of f. Since moduli of continuity are required to be infinitesimal at 0, a function turns out to be uniformly continuous if and only if it admits a modulus of continuity. Moreover, relevance to the notion is given by the fact that sets of functions sharing the same modulus of continuity are exactly equicontinuous families. For instance, the modulus œâ(t) := kt describes the k-Lipschitz functions, the moduli œâ(t) := ktŒ± describe the H√∂lder continuity, the modulus œâ(t) := kt(log(t)+1) describes the almost Lipschitz class, and so on. In general, the role of œâ is to fix some explicit functional dependence of Œµ on Œ¥ in the (Œµ, Œ¥) definition of uniform continuity. The same notions generalize naturally to functions between metric spaces. Moreover, a suitable local version of these notions allows to describe quantitatively the continuity at a point in terms of moduli of continuity. A special role is played by concave moduli of continuity, especially in connection with extension properties, and with approximation of uniformly continuous functions. For a function between metric spaces, it is equivalent to admit a modulus of continuity that is either concave, or subadditive, or uniformly continuous, or sublinear (in the sense of growth). Actually, the existence of such special moduli of continuity for a uniformly continuous function is always ensured whenever the domain is either a compact, or a convex subset of a normed space. However, a uniformly continuous function on a general metric space admits a concave modulus of continuity if and only if the ratios :\\\\frac{d_Y(f(x),f(x'))}{d_X(x,x')} are uniformly bounded for all pairs (x, x‚Ä≤) bounded away from the diagonal of X x X. The functions with the latter property constitute a special subclass of the uniformly continuous functions, that in the following we refer to as the special uniformly continuous functions. Real-valued special uniformly continuous functions on the metric space X can also be characterized as the set of all functions that are restrictions to X of uniformly continuous functions over any normed space isometrically containing X. Also, it can be characterized as the uniform closure of the Lipschitz functions on X. Formal definition Formally, a modulus of continuity is any increasing real-extended valued function œâ : [0, ‚àû] ‚Üí [0, ‚àû], vanishing at 0 and continuous at 0, that is :\\\\lim_{t\\\\to0}\\\\omega(t)=\\\\omega(0)=0. Moduli of continuity are mainly used to give a quantitative account both of the continuity at a point, and of the uniform continuity, for functions between metric spaces, according to the following definitions. A function f : (X, dX) ‚Üí (Y, dY) admits œâ as (local) modulus of continuity at the point x in X if and only if, :\\\\forall x'\\\\in X: d_Y(f(x),f(x'))\\\\leq\\\\omega(d_X(x,x')). Also, f admits œâ as (global) modulus of continuity if and only if, :\\\\forall x,x'\\\\in X: d_Y(f(x),f(x'))\\\\leq\\\\omega(d_X(x,x')). One equivalently says that œâ is a modulus of continuity (resp., at x) for f, or shortly, f is œâ-continuous (resp., at x). Here, we mainly treat the global notion. =Elementary facts= *If f has œâ as modulus of continuity and œâ1 ‚â• œâ, then f admits œâ1 too as modulus of continuity. *If f : X ‚Üí Y and g : Y ‚Üí Z are functions between metric spaces with moduli respectively œâ1 and œâ2 then the composition map g\\\\circ f:X\\\\to Z has modulus of continuity \\\\omega_2\\\\circ\\\\omega_1. *If f and g are functions from the metric space X to the Banach space Y, with moduli respectively œâ1 and œâ2, then any linear combination af+bg has modulus of continuity aœâ1+bœâ2. In particular, the set of all functions from X to Y that have œâ as a modulus of continuity is a convex subset of the vector space C(X, Y), closed under pointwise convergence. *If f and g are bounded real- valued functions on the metric space X, with moduli respectively œâ1 and œâ2, then the pointwise product fg has modulus of continuity \\\\g\\\\_\\\\infty\\\\omega_1+\\\\f\\\\_\\\\infty \\\\omega_2. *If \\\\\\\\{f_\\\\lambda\\\\\\\\}_{\\\\lambda\\\\in\\\\Lambda} is a family of real-valued functions on the metric space X with common modulus of continuity œâ, then the inferior envelope \\\\inf_{\\\\lambda\\\\in\\\\Lambda}f_\\\\lambda, respectively, the superior envelope \\\\sup_{\\\\lambda\\\\in\\\\Lambda}f_\\\\lambda, is a real-valued function with modulus of continuity œâ, provided it is finite valued at every point. If œâ is real-valued, it is sufficient that the envelope be finite at one point of X at least. =Remarks= *Some authors do not require monotonicity, and some require additional properties such as œâ being continuous. However, if f admits a modulus of continuity in the weaker definition, it also admits a modulus of continuity which is increasing and infinitely differentiable in ]0, ‚àû[. For instance, ::\\\\omega_1(t):=\\\\sup_{s\\\\leq t}\\\\omega(s) is increasing, and œâ1 ‚â• œâ; ::\\\\omega_2(t):=\\\\frac{1}{t}\\\\int_t^{2t}\\\\omega_1(s)ds is also continuous, and œâ2 ‚â• œâ1, :and a suitable variant of the preceding definition also makes œâ2 infinitely differentiable in ]0, ‚àû[. *Any uniformly continuous function admits a minimal modulus of continuity œâf, that is sometimes referred to as the (optimal) modulus of continuity of f: ::\\\\omega_f(t):=\\\\sup\\\\\\\\{ d_Y(f(x),f(x')):x\\\\in X,x'\\\\in X,d_X(x,x')\\\\le t \\\\\\\\} ,\\\\quad\\\\forall t\\\\geq0. :Similarly, any function continuous at the point x admits a minimal modulus of continuity at x, œâf(t; x) (the (optimal) modulus of continuity of f at x) : ::\\\\omega_f(t;x):=\\\\sup\\\\\\\\{ d_Y(f(x),f(x')): x'\\\\in X,d_X(x,x')\\\\le t \\\\\\\\},\\\\quad\\\\forall t\\\\geq0. :However, these restricted notions are not as relevant, for in most cases the optimal modulus of f could not be computed explicitly, but only bounded from above (by any modulus of continuity of f). Moreover, the main properties of moduli of continuity concern directly the unrestricted definition. *In general, the modulus of continuity of a uniformly continuous function on a metric space needs to take the value +‚àû. For instance, the function f : N ‚Üí N such that f(n) := n2 is uniformly continuous with respect to the discrete metric on N, and its minimal modulus of continuity is œâf(t) = +‚àû for any t‚â•1, and œâf(t) = 0 otherwise. However, the situation is different for uniformly continuous functions defined on compact or convex subsets of normed spaces. Special moduli of continuity Special moduli of continuity also reflect certain global properties of functions such as extendibility and uniform approximation. In this section we mainly deal with moduli of continuity that are concave, or subadditive, or uniformly continuous, or sublinear. These properties are essentially equivalent in that, for a modulus œâ (more precisely, its restriction on [0, ‚àû[) each of the following implies the next: *œâ is concave; *œâ is subadditive; *œâ is uniformly continuous; *œâ is sublinear, that is, there are constants a and b such that œâ(t) ‚â§ at+b for all t; *œâ is dominated by a concave modulus, that is, there exists a concave modulus of continuity \\\\tilde\\\\omega such that \\\\omega(t)\\\\leq \\\\tilde\\\\omega(t) for all t. Thus, for a function f between metric spaces it is equivalent to admit a modulus of continuity which is either concave, or subadditive, or uniformly continuous, or sublinear. In this case, the function f is sometimes called a special uniformly continuous map. This is always true in case of either compact or convex domains. Indeed, a uniformly continuous map f : C ‚Üí Y defined on a convex set C of a normed space E always admits a subadditive modulus of continuity; in particular, real-valued as a function œâ : [0, ‚àû[ ‚Üí [0, ‚àû[. Indeed, it is immediate to check that the optimal modulus of continuity œâf defined above is subadditive if the domain of f is convex: we have, for all s and t: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\omega_f(s+t) &=\\\\sup_{x-x'\\\\le t+s} d_Y(f(x),f(x')) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\leq \\\\sup_{x-x'\\\\le t+s}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{d_Y\\\\left( f(x), f\\\\left(x-t\\\\frac{x-x'}{x-x'}\\\\right)\\\\right) + d_Y\\\\left( f\\\\left(x-t\\\\frac{x-x'}{x-x'}\\\\right), f(x')\\\\right )\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\leq \\\\omega_f(t)+\\\\omega_f(s). \\\\end{align} Note that as an immediate consequence, any uniformly continuous function on a convex subset of a normed space has a sublinear growth: there are constants a and b such that f(x) ‚â§ ax+b for all x. However, a uniformly continuous function on a general metric space admits a concave modulus of continuity if and only if the ratios d_Y(f(x),f(x'))/d_X(x,x') are uniformly bounded for all pairs (x, x‚Ä≤) bounded away from the diagonal of X x X; this condition is certainly satisfied by any bounded uniformly continuous function; hence in particular, by any continuous function on a compact metric space. =Sublinear moduli, and bounded perturbations from Lipschitz= A sublinear modulus of continuity can easily be found for any uniformly function which is a bounded perturbation of a Lipschitz function: if f is a uniformly continuous function with modulus of continuity œâ, and g is a k Lipschitz function with uniform distance r from f, then f admits the sublinear module of continuity min{œâ(t), 2r+kt}. Conversely, at least for real-valued functions, any special uniformly continuous function is a bounded, uniformly continuous perturbation of some Lipschitz function; indeed more is true as shown below (Lipschitz approximation). =Subadditive moduli, and extendibility= The above property for uniformly continuous function on convex domains admits a sort of converse at least in the case of real-valued functions: that is, every special uniformly continuous real-valued function f : X ‚Üí R defined on a subset X of a normed space E admits extensions over E that preserves any subadditive modulus œâ of f. The least and the greatest of such extensions are respectively: :\\\\begin{align} f_*(x) &:=\\\\sup_{y\\\\in X}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{f(y)-\\\\omega(x-y)\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ f^*(x) &:=\\\\inf_{y\\\\in X}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{f(y)+\\\\omega(x-y)\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. \\\\end{align} As remarked, any subadditive modulus of continuity is uniformly continuous: in fact, it admits itself as a modulus of continuity. Therefore, f‚àó and f* are respectively inferior and superior envelopes of œâ-continuous families; hence still œâ-continuous. Incidentally, by the Kuratowski embedding any metric space is isometric to a subset of a normed space. Hence, special uniformly continuous real-valued functions are essentially the restrictions of uniformly continuous functions on normed spaces. In particular, this construction provides a quick proof of the Tietze extension theorem on compact metric spaces. However, for mappings with values in more general Banach spaces than R, the situation is quite more complicated; the first non-trivial result in this direction is the Kirszbraun theorem. =Concave moduli and Lipschitz approximation= Every special uniformly continuous real-valued function f : X ‚Üí R defined on the metric space X is uniformly approximable by means of Lipschitz functions. Moreover, the speed of convergence in terms of the Lipschitz constants of the approximations is strictly related to the modulus of continuity of f. Precisely, let œâ be the minimal concave modulus of continuity of f, which is :\\\\omega(t)=\\\\inf\\\\big\\\\\\\\{at+b\\\\, :\\\\, a>0,\\\\, b>0,\\\\, \\\\forall x\\\\in X,\\\\, \\\\forall x'\\\\in X\\\\,\\\\, f(x)-f(x')\\\\leq ad(x,x')+b\\\\big\\\\\\\\}. Let Œ¥(s) be the uniform distance between the function f and the set Lips of all Lipschitz real-valued functions on C having Lipschitz constant s : :\\\\delta(s):=\\\\inf\\\\big\\\\\\\\{\\\\f-u\\\\_{\\\\infty,X}\\\\,:\\\\, u\\\\in \\\\mathrm{Lip}_s\\\\big\\\\\\\\}\\\\leq+\\\\infty. Then the functions œâ(t) and Œ¥(s) can be related with each other via a Legendre transformation: more precisely, the functions 2Œ¥(s) and ‚àíœâ(‚àít) (suitably extended to +‚àû outside their domains of finiteness) are a pair of conjugated convex functions,Legendre transform and Lipschitz approximation for :2\\\\delta(s)=\\\\sup_{t\\\\geq0}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\omega(t)-st\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, :\\\\omega(t)=\\\\inf_{s\\\\geq0}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{2\\\\delta(s)+st\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. Since œâ(t) = o(1) for t ‚Üí 0+, it follows that Œ¥(s) = o(1) for s ‚Üí +‚àû, that exactly means that f is uniformly approximable by Lipschitz functions. Correspondingly, an optimal approximation is given by the functions :f_s:=\\\\delta(s)+\\\\inf_{y\\\\in X}\\\\\\\\{f(y)+sd(x,y)\\\\\\\\}, \\\\quad \\\\mathrm{for} \\\\ s\\\\in\\\\mathrm{dom}(\\\\delta): each function fs has Lipschitz constant s and :\\\\f-f_s\\\\_{\\\\infty,X}=\\\\delta(s); in fact, it is the greatest s-Lipschitz function that realize the distance Œ¥(s). For example, the Œ±-H√∂lder real-valued functions on a metric space are characterized as those functions that can be uniformly approximated by s-Lipschitz functions with speed of convergence O(s^{-\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{1-\\\\alpha}}), while the almost Lipschitz functions are characterized by an exponential speed of convergence O(e^{-as}). Examples of use *Let f : [a, b] ‚Üí R a continuous function. In the proof that f is Riemann integrable, one usually bounds the distance between the upper and lower Riemann sums with respect to the Riemann partition P := {t0, ..., tn} in terms of the modulus of continuity of f and the mesh of the partition P (which is the number \\\\scriptstyle P:=\\\\max_{0\\\\le i) ::S^*(f;P)-S_*(f;P)\\\\leq(b-a)\\\\omega(P). *For an example of use in the Fourier series, see Dini test. History Steffens (2006, p. 160) attributes the first usage of omega for the modulus of continuity to Lebesgue (1909, p. 309/p. 75) where omega refers to the oscillation of a Fourier transform. De la Vall√©e Poussin (1919, pp. 7-8) mentions both names (1) \\"modulus of continuity\\" and (2) \\"modulus of oscillation\\" and then concludes \\"but we choose (1) to draw attention to the usage we will make of it\\". The translation group of Lp functions, and moduli of continuity Lp. Let 1 ‚â§ p; let f : Rn ‚Üí R a function of class Lp, and let h ‚àà Rn. The h-translation of f, the function defined by (œÑhf)(x) := f(x‚àíh), belongs to the Lp class; moreover, if 1 ‚â§ p < ‚àû, then as «Åh«Å ‚Üí 0 we have: :\\\\\\\\tau_h f - f\\\\_p=o(1). Therefore, since translations are in fact linear isometries, also :\\\\\\\\tau_{v+h} f - \\\\tau_v f\\\\_p=o(1), as «Åh«Å ‚Üí 0, uniformly on v ‚àà Rn. In other words, the map h ‚Üí œÑh defines a strongly continuous group of linear isometries of Lp. In the case p = ‚àû the above property does not hold in general: actually, it exactly reduces to the uniform continuity, and defines the uniform continuous functions. This leads to the following definition, that generalizes the notion of a modulus of continuity of the uniformly continuous functions: a modulus of continuity Lp for a measurable function f : X ‚Üí R is a modulus of continuity œâ : [0, ‚àû] ‚Üí [0, ‚àû] such that :\\\\\\\\tau_h f - f\\\\_p\\\\leq \\\\omega(h). This way, moduli of continuity also give a quantitative account of the continuity property shared by all Lp functions. Modulus of continuity of higher orders It can be seen that formal definition of the modulus uses notion of finite difference of first order: :\\\\omega_f(\\\\delta)=\\\\omega(f, \\\\delta)=\\\\sup\\\\limits_{x; h<\\\\delta;}\\\\left\\\\Delta_h(f,x)\\\\right. If we replace that difference with a difference of order n, we get a modulus of continuity of order n: :\\\\omega_n(f, \\\\delta)=\\\\sup\\\\limits_{x; h<\\\\delta;}\\\\left\\\\Delta^n_h(f,x)\\\\right.

Ordered in 1909 for the Commonwealth Naval Forces (the predecessor of the RAN), Parramatta was the first ship launched for the RAN. Temporarily commissioned into the Royal Navy for the delivery voyage to Australia, the destroyer came under Australian naval control in 1910, and was recommissioned into the RAN on 1 March 1911, shortly before the latter's formal creation. After the beginning of the First World War in 1914 until 1917, Parramatta was conducted patrols in the Pacific and South-East Asia, before she and her sister ships were transferred to the Mediterranean for anti-submarine operations. She returned to Australia in 1919 and was placed in reserve. Apart from a brief period of full commission during the visit of the Prince of Wales in 1920, Parramatta remained in reserve until 1928. She was fully decommissioned in 1928, stripped of parts, and sold for use as prisoner accommodation on the Hawkesbury River. After changing hands several times, the hull ran aground during a gale in 1933, and was left to rust. In 1973, the bow and stern sections were salvaged, and converted into memorials. Description The Australian River-class destroyers had an overall length of , a beam of Briggs, \\"Australia's First Destroyers\\", p. 157 and a draft of .HMAS Parramatta (I) They displaced at normal load. The destroyers were powered by one set of Parsons steam turbines that drove three propeller shafts using steam provided by three Yarrow boilers. The turbines were rated at which was designed to give the ships a speed of . During her sea trials, Parramatta was able to achieve . The ships could carry enough fuel oil to give them a range of at a speed of . The ship's company consisted of between 66 and 73 crewmen, including five officers.Cassells, The Destroyers, pp. 74‚Äì75 The ship were armed with a single BL Mk VIII gun in a platform on the forecastle, three 12-pounder () 12 cwt guns\\"Cwt\\" is the abbreviation for hundredweight, 20 cwt referring to the weight of the gun. in single mounts, one on each broadside amidships and the third on the quarterdeck. They were also fitted with three 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes in rotating single mounts, two aft of the rear funnel and the last on the quarterdeck at the stern.Briggs, \\"Australia's First Destroyers\\", pp. 157‚Äì159 Construction and career Parramatta anchored in Port Adelaide in December 1910, shortly after arriving in Australian waters for the first time Parramatta, along with sister ships and , were ordered on 13 March 1909; the first ships to be ordered for the Commonwealth Naval Forces, the post-Federation amalgamation of the Australian colonial navies.Stevens, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 18 The ship was laid down by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, at their shipyard in Govan, Scotland, on 17 March.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 74 She was launched on 9 February 1910 by Margot Asquith, wife of British Prime Minister H. H. Asquith; the first new ship launched for the Australian navy.Stevens, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 19 Construction was completed on 10 September,Briggs, \\"Australia's First Destroyers\\", p. 162 and the ship was commissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS Parramatta for the voyage out to Australia. Parramatta and sister ship sailed from Portsmouth on 19 September. Once the ships arrived in Broome in December, they were transferred to the control of the Commonwealth Naval Forces.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 75 After entering Australian control, the two ships sailed to Melbourne for a gala welcome. During the celebrations, the ship's engineering officer fell overboard and drowned. On 1 March 1911, Parramatta was recommissioned as His Majesty's Australian Ship, although the HMAS prefix was not officially approved until 10 July, when King George V granted permission for the Commonwealth Naval Forces to be renamed the Royal Australian Navy. On 4 October 1913, Parramatta took part in a formal fleet entry into Sydney Harbour welcoming the battlecruiser .Stevens, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, pp. 25‚Äì26 =World War I= During the early stages of World War I, Parramatta operated with the Australian fleet in the search for the German East Asia Squadron, then was involved in the capture of German colonies in the South Pacific region, including German New Guinea, and the consolidation of Allied occupation in these regions. On 5 February 1915, Parramatta and sister ships Yarra and sailed for Australia, where they were used for convoy escort duties along the continent's eastern coast until November. The ships were refitted at Sydney, then sent to patrol the region around Malaya, the East Indies, and the Philippines. Parramatta returned to Australia on 17 July 1916, and patrolled home waters until 17 May 1917, when she and her sister ships were ordered to Malta. Stern view of Parramatta with crew on deck. The ship is flying the Australian National Flag from the stern instead of a naval ensign. On arrival, the six River-class ships were to undergo anti-submarine training, but were instead immediately deployed on convoy escort operations from Port Said to Malta. On 16 August, lookouts aboard Parramatta spotted the wake from a periscope. The destroyer sped to the area of the sighting, and dropped a depth charge on a submarine travelling just below the surface. After completing the convoy run, the Australian warships completed the training, and were assigned to patrols of the Adriatic. For this, Parramatta was fitted with an observation balloon. On 16 November 1917, Parramatta and several sister ships came to assist the Italian transport Orione, whose stern had been destroyed by a torpedo. Parramatta towed the stricken ship towards the mainland, while Warrego and recovered survivors and Yarra chased the attacking submarine. Apart from this, the patrols were uneventful, and on 28 September 1918, Parramatta was refitted in Greece before joining Allied forces at Constantinople. During October 1918, following the surrender of Turkish forces, Parramatta accepted the surrender of a German admiral assigned to the area. The destroyer was then used for mail runs between Constantinople and Sevastopol, Russia, until December, when she sailed to Devonport, arriving on 14 January 1919.Cassells, The Destroyers, pp. 75‚Äì76 During her career, Parramatta received no honours or awards for her activities during World War I.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 77 Following an overhaul of the RAN battle honours system, completed in 2010, the ship's wartime service was retroactively recognised with the honours \\"Rabaul 1914\\" and \\"Adriatic 1917‚Äì18\\". =Post-war= On 6 March 1919, Parramatta sailed for home, in company with several other Australian ships. Parramatta and Yarra ran out of fuel on 26 April, less than a day out from Darwin, and had to be towed into port by Warrego. The destroyer paid off into reserve at Sydney on 22 July 1919. She was recommissioned for the period 17 May to 13 June 1920 for the visit of the Prince of Wales aboard the battlecruiser , then was returned to reserve. From October 1924 until November 1925, Parramatta was based at Westernport, Victoria for use as a training ship, then spent time in Sydney, then Adelaide, before returning to Sydney in April 1928.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 76 Decommissioning and fate The wreck of Parramatta in the Hawkesbury River Parramatta was paid off from service on 20 April 1928 and handed over to the Cockatoo Island Dockyard for dismantling on 17 October. Parramatta and Swan were stripped down, and their hulks were sold to the New South Wales Penal Department and towed to Cowan Creek, where they were used to house prisoner labourers working on roads along the Hawkesbury River. The two hulks were then sold in 1933 for 12 pounds each to George Rhodes of Cowan, New South Wales, who intended to use them as accommodation for fishers. This was opposed, and the ships were sold on to a pair of fishermen, who used them to transport blue metal to Milson and Peat Islands. On 2 February 1934, Parramatta and Swan were being towed down the Hawkesbury River scrapped in Sydney, when a gale caused both hulls to break their tows; Swan foundered and sank, while Parramatta ran aground in a mangrove swamp opposite Milson Island and was abandoned in position . In 1973, the bow and stern sections of Parramatta were salvaged, with the stern established as a memorial on the south bank of the Parramatta River in Parramatta, New South Wales, and the bow later placed outside the Royal Australian Navy Heritage Centre, at the northern tip of the naval base at Garden Island, New South Wales.Cassells, The Destroyers, pp. 76‚Äì77 The wreck and bow and stern sections are heritage listed.

Around the same time, the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) was looking to replace four Leander-class frigates; a deterioration in New Zealand-United States relations, the need to improve alliances with nearby nations, and the commonalities between the RAN and RNZN ships' requirements led the two nations to begin collaborating on the acquisition in 1987.Greener, Timing is everything, pp. 23‚Äì9Jones, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 245 Tenders were requested by the Anzac Ship Project at the end of 1986, with 12 ship designs (including an airship) submitted.Greener, Timing is everything, p. 30 By August 1987, the tenders were narrowed down in October to Blohm + Voss's MEKO 200 design, the M class (later Karel Doorman class) offered by Royal Schelde, and a scaled-down Type 23 frigate proposed by Yarrow Shipbuilders.Greener, Timing is everything, p. 31 In 1989, the Australian government announced that Melbourne-based shipbuilder AMECON (which became Tenix Defense) would build the modified MEKO 200 design.Grazebrook, Anzac frigates sail diverging courses The Australians ordered eight ships, while New Zealand ordered two, with an unexercised option for two more.Wertheim (ed.), The Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World, p. 20Greener, Timing is everything, pp. 43‚Äì4 Parramattas makers plate The Anzacs are based on Blohm + Voss' MEKO 200 PN (or Vasco da Gama-class) frigates, modified to meet Australian and New Zealand specifications and maximise the use of locally built equipment.Wertheim, The Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World, pp. 20‚Äì1 Each frigate has a full load displacement.Sharpe (ed.), Jane's Fighting Ships 1998‚Äì99, pgs. 25, 470 The ships are long at the waterline, and long overall, with a beam of , and a full load draught of .

Its headquarters are located at Ostankino Technical Center near the Ostankino Tower in Moscow. First among Russia's country-wide channels, Channel One has more than 250 million viewers worldwide. From 1995 to 2002 the channel was known as Public Russian Television (, ORT) or Russian Public Television.  History  When the Soviet Union was abolished, the Russian Federation took over most of its structures and institutions. One of the first acts of Boris Yeltsin's new government was his signing of a presidential decree on 27 December 1991, providing for Russian jurisdiction over the central television system. The 'All-Union State TV and Radio Company' (Gosteleradio) was transformed into the 'Russian State TV and Radio Company Ostankino'. A presidential decree of 30 November 1994 transformed Ostankino into a closed joint-stock company, Russian Public TV (Obshchestvennoe Rossiyskoye Televidenie or ORT). The shares were distributed between state agencies (51%) and private shareholders, including numerous banks (49%). The partial privatization was inspired by the intolerable financial situation of Ostankino owing to huge transmission costs and a bloated payroll (total staff of about 10,000 in early 1995). Following the 1998 financial collapse, the channel obtained a government loan of $100 million from state-controlled bank Vneshekonombank.Television in the Russian Federation: Organisational Structure, Program Production and Audience Also in 1998, the closed joint stock company was transformed into an open stock company. However, controlling votes on the board of directors remained in the hands of structures linked to then-Kremlin-connected businessman Boris Berezovsky. Thanks to this state of affairs, Berezovsky was able to preserve control over the channel's cash flows as well as over its editorial line until 2002. From 1 April 1995 until late 2002, the channel was called ORT (–û–†–¢‚Äî–û–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–µ –¢–µ–ª–µ–≤–∏–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ, Obshchestvennoye Rossiyskoye Televideniye; Public Russian Television). It maintained the traditional programs and shows of the First Channel of the Soviet Television (RTO), such as Vremya, KVN, Chto? Gde? Kogda?, V mire zhivotnykh and Travelers' Club; the last two are no longer on the air of this channel. Political coverage In autumn of 1999 the channel actively participated in State Duma electoral campaign by criticizing Moscow mayor Yuriy Luzhkov, Yevgeny Primakov and their party Fatherland-All Russia, major opponents of the pro-Putin party Unity. Sergey Dorenko, popularly dubbed as TV-killer, was a close ally of business oligarch and media magnate Boris Berezovsky. From September 1999 to September 2000 he hosted the influential weekly program simply called Sergey Dorenko's Program on Saturdays at 9 pm. This was especially heavy on criticism and mercilessly attacked Putin's opponents.Russian Elections (transcript), Jim Lehrer NewsHour, PBS, 17 December 1999.

In August 2000, however, his program criticized how the Putin government handled the explosion of the Russian submarine Kursk. When Dorenko's show was in turn suspended on 9 September 2000, ORT director-general Konstantin Ernst insisted that ‚Äî contrary to Dorenko's allegations ‚Äî the government had not been involved in the change. Ernst stated that he yanked the show because Dorenko had defied his orders to stop discussing the government's plan to nationalize Boris Berezovsky's 49-percent stake in the network.Russia 2000 Country Report, CPJ.

Berezovsky claims that in 2001 he was forced by the Putin administration to sell his shares. He first tried to sell them to a third party, but failed. A close friend of Berezovsky, Nikolai Glushkov, was arrested while seriously ill, and Berezovsky gave up the shares and transferred them to Roman Abramovich's Sibneft with the understanding that Glushkov would then be released.

Soon after Berezovsky's withdrawal, the new ownership changed the channel's name to Pervy Kanal (Channel One). Konstantin Ernst remains as general director. As of 2008, Channel One's minority shares are held by three little-known companies, ORT-KB, Eberlink2002, and Rastrkom-2002. Their parent companies are domiciled in Panama and Seychelles and are managed by Evrofinans Group. The ultimate owner is still believed to be Roman Abramovich, who also controls the Video International advertising agency, the exclusive media seller of Channel One. Russian television media in the Putin era have been criticised for the pro- government bias.For example, see Index on Censorship Volume 37, Number 1, 2008, issue entitled \\"How Free is the Russian Media?\\" The critics charge that Channel One's news and information programs are frequently used for propaganda purposes. These critics contend that Channel One airs a disproportionate number of stories focusing on positive aspects of official government policy, while largely neglecting certain controversial topics such as war in Chechnya or social problems. In addition, some have argued that the station's news reports often blur the line between factual reporting and editorial commentary, especially when broadcasting stories concerning Russian government policies or goals. For example, during the 2004 Ukrainian presidential elections, many political observers believe the Russian government actively supported the candidacy of then Ukrainian Prime-minister Viktor Yanukovych over that of Viktor Yushchenko. In a 13 October 2004 news story, Channel One reporter Natalya Kondratyuk declared that \\"the Premier [Yanukovich], as a candidate, is adding to his ratings by working on the economy and by solving current social problems; he does not use slogans; he is not criticizing his opponent; and he is not creating scandals. Yushchenko‚Äôs style of campaigning is diametrically opposite.\\" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on the \\"Posner Show\\" in Moscow, 19 March 2010 In another controversial example, on a 23 January 2005 broadcast, in the midst of widespread protests against a new reform of Russia's social benefits system (L'goty), a Channel One anchor opined, \\"you can understand, and should understand, those who went out on the streets, but you also have to understand that the old system has completely outlived its use.\\" Later, in the same story, a reporter characterized those protesting against the reforms as political opportunists, adding, \\"criticizing the reform is good PR.\\" A few days later, on 27 January 2005, as the protests continued across Russia, a Channel One reporter noted, \\"You can understand the elderly [protestors, but] repealing free [bus] fares was the last hope for public transport.\\" Similarly, on a 12 February 2005 broadcast, a Channel One anchor declared, \\"The key question of the week has been: how are Presidents [Mikheil] Saakashvili [of Georgia]) and Yushchenko [of Ukraine] different? At first, it seemed the difference was only in their appearance, in all other ways, they were like characters from the film Attack of the Clones for us.\\" Critics of Channel One news argue that hundreds of similar examples exist where station news reporters and anchors insert editorial commentary into news reports, almost always to commend perceived allies of Russia or criticize perceived enemies. As of 2006, Vladimir Posner, Ekaterina Andreeva, Petr Tolstoy and Mikhail Leontiev are among the most prominent political journalists of the channel. On Sunday, 28 January 2006, the Channel One news and analytical program Sunday Time (Voskresnoye Vremya) hosted by Petr Tolstoy distorted the content of a speech by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko related to the Russia-Belarus energy dispute to the contrary by editing it and deleting some crucial words.(1) –ö–∞–∫ –¥–µ–ª–∞–ª–∏ –ø—Ä–æ–≤–æ–∫–∞—Ü–∏—é –ø–æ –õ—É–∫–∞—à–µ–Ω–∫–µ (–û–†–¢) (Kak delali provokatsi po Lukashchenke (ORT), \\"How they provoked on Lukashenko (ORT)\\"), for-ua.com (2) video (in Russian) (FLV file) (3) text of original speech in Russian (ITAR-TASS) According to a BBC News analysis by Stephen Ennis the channel has in its reports about Ukraine's War in Donbass \\"sought to further demonise and dehumanise the Ukrainian army\\".How Russian TV uses psychology over Ukraine, BBC News (4 February 2015) A 16 January 2016 Channel One news reports on a 13-year-old girl with German and Russian citizenship in Berlin who was allegedly raped by immigrants was denounced by the German police as fake.

In September 2008 the channel installed new digital audio mixing systems in their new state-of-the-art broadcast complex located in the Ostankino Television Technical Centre in Moscow. The new Channel One news facility opened in March 2008 and features advanced server technology with equipment from the world's leading television equipment manufacturers such as Thomson, EVS, and HP. Spearheading the transition of the renovated news facilities was Okno TV. Channel One began broadcasting a 1080i high-definition signal on 24 December 2012. Production Channel One has produced many films, including four of the highest-grossing Russian movies after the Soviet collapse, Night Watch (2004), The Turkish Gambit (2005), Day Watch (2006), and The Irony of Fate 2 (2007).

It was much used by √âlie Cartan as a basic ingredient of his method of moving frames, and bears his name together with that of Ludwig Maurer. As a one-form, the Maurer-Cartan form is peculiar in that it takes its values in the Lie algebra associated to the Lie group . The Lie algebra is identified with the tangent space of at the identity, denoted . The Maurer-Cartan form is thus a one-form defined globally on which is a linear mapping of the tangent space at each into . It is given as the pushforward of a vector in along the left-translation in the group: :\\\\omega(v) = (L_{g^{-1}})_* v,\\\\quad v\\\\in T_gG. Motivation and interpretation A Lie group acts on itself by multiplication under the mapping :G\\\\times G i (g,h) \\\\mapsto gh \\\\in G. A question of importance to Cartan and his contemporaries was how to identify a principal homogeneous space of . That is, a manifold identical to the group , but without a fixed choice of unit element. This motivation came, in part, from Felix Klein's Erlangen programme where one was interested in a notion of symmetry on a space, where the symmetries of the space were transformations forming a Lie group. The geometries of interest were homogeneous spaces , but usually without a fixed choice of origin corresponding to the coset . A principal homogeneous space of is a manifold abstractly characterized by having a free and transitive action of on . The Maurer-Cartan formIntroduced by Cartan (1904). gives an appropriate infinitesimal characterization of the principal homogeneous space. It is a one-form defined on satisfying an integrability condition known as the Maurer- Cartan equation. Using this integrability condition, it is possible to define the exponential map of the Lie algebra and in this way obtain, locally, a group action on . Construction =Intrinsic construction= Let be the tangent space of a Lie group at the identity (its Lie algebra). acts on itself by left translation : L : G \\\\times G \\\\to G such that for a given we have : L_g : G \\\\to G \\\\quad \\\\mbox{where} \\\\quad L_g(h) = gh, and this induces a map of the tangent bundle to itself: (L_g)_*:T_hG\\\\to T_{gh}G. A left-invariant vector field is a section of such that Subtlety: (L_g)_{*}X gives a vector in T_{gh}G \\\\text{ if } X\\\\in T_h G :(L_g)_{*}X = X \\\\quad \\\\forall g \\\\in G. The Maurer-Cartan form is a -valued one-form on defined on vectors by the formula : \\\\omega_g(v)=(L_{g^{-1}})_*v. =Extrinsic construction= If is embedded in by a matrix valued mapping , then one can write explicitly as :\\\\omega_g = g^{-1} \\\\,dg. In this sense, the Maurer-Cartan form is always the left logarithmic derivative of the identity map of . =Characterization as a connection= If we regard the Lie group as a principal bundle over a manifold consisting of a single point then the Maurer‚ÄìCartan form can also be characterized abstractly as the unique principal connection on the principal bundle . Indeed, it is the unique valued -form on satisfying :# \\\\omega_e = \\\\mathrm{id} : T_eG\\\\rightarrow {\\\\mathfrak g},\\\\text{ and} :# \\\\forall g \\\\in G \\\\quad \\\\omega_g = \\\\mathrm{Ad}(h)(R_h^*\\\\omega_e),\\\\text{ where }h=g^{-1}, where is the pullback of forms along the right-translation in the group and is the adjoint action on the Lie algebra. Properties If is a left-invariant vector field on , then is constant on . Furthermore, if and are both left- invariant, then :\\\\omega([X,Y])=[\\\\omega(X),\\\\omega(Y)] where the bracket on the left-hand side is the Lie bracket of vector fields, and the bracket on the right-hand side is the bracket on the Lie algebra . (This may be used as the definition of the bracket on .) These facts may be used to establish an isomorphism of Lie algebras :\\\\mathfrak{g}=T_eG\\\\cong \\\\\\\\{\\\\hbox{left-invariant vector fields on G}\\\\\\\\}. By the definition of the exterior derivative, if and are arbitrary vector fields then :d\\\\omega(X,Y)=X(\\\\omega(Y))-Y(\\\\omega(X))-\\\\omega([X,Y]). Here is the -valued function obtained by duality from pairing the one-form with the vector field , and is the Lie derivative of this function along . Similarly is the Lie derivative along of the -valued function . In particular, if and are left- invariant, then :X(\\\\omega(Y))=Y(\\\\omega(X))=0, so :d\\\\omega(X,Y)+[\\\\omega(X),\\\\omega(Y)]=0 but the left-invariant fields span the tangent space at any point (the push-forward of a basis in under a diffeomorphism is still a basis), so the equation is true for any pair of vector fields and . This is known as the Maurer-Cartan equation. It is often written as :d\\\\omega + \\\\frac{1}{2}[\\\\omega,\\\\omega]=0. Here denotes the bracket of Lie algebra-valued forms. Maurer-Cartan frame One can also view the Maurer-Cartan form as being constructed from a Maurer-Cartan frame. Let be a basis of sections of consisting of left-invariant vector fields, and be the dual basis of sections of such that , the Kronecker delta. Then is a Maurer- Cartan frame, and is a Maurer-Cartan coframe. Since is left-invariant, applying the Maurer-Cartan form to it simply returns the value of at the identity. Thus . Thus, the Maurer-Cartan form can be written Suppose that the Lie brackets of the vector fields are given by :[E_i,E_j]=\\\\sum_k{c_{ij}}^kE_k. The quantities are the structure constants of the Lie algebra (relative to the basis ). A simple calculation, using the definition of the exterior derivative , yields :d\\\\theta^i(E_j,E_k) = -\\\\theta^i([E_j,E_k]) = -\\\\sum_r {c_{jk}}^r\\\\theta^i(E_r) = -{c_{jk}}^i = -\\\\frac{1}{2}({c_{jk}}^i - {c_{kj}}^i), so that by duality ^i\\\\theta^j\\\\wedge\\\\theta^k.}} This equation is also often called the Maurer-Cartan equation. To relate it to the previous definition, which only involved the Maurer-Cartan form , take the exterior derivative of : :d\\\\omega = \\\\sum_i E_i(e)\\\\otimes d\\\\theta^i\\\\,=\\\\,-\\\\frac12 \\\\sum_{ijk}{c_{jk}}^iE_i(e)\\\\otimes\\\\theta^j\\\\wedge\\\\theta^k. The frame components are given by :d\\\\omega(E_j,E_k) = -\\\\sum_i {c_{jk}}^iE_i(e) = -[E_j(e),E_k(e)]=-[\\\\omega(E_j),\\\\omega(E_k)], which establishes the equivalence of the two forms of the Maurer-Cartan equation. On a homogeneous space Maurer-Cartan forms play an important role in Cartan's method of moving frames. In this context, one may view the Maurer-Cartan form as a defined on the tautological principal bundle associated with a homogeneous space. If is a closed subgroup of , then is a smooth manifold of dimension . The quotient map induces the structure of an -principal bundle over . The Maurer-Cartan form on the Lie group yields a flat Cartan connection for this principal bundle. In particular, if }, then this Cartan connection is an ordinary connection form, and we have :d\\\\omega+\\\\omega\\\\wedge\\\\omega=0 which is the condition for the vanishing of the curvature. In the method of moving frames, one sometimes considers a local section of the tautological bundle, say . (If working on a submanifold of the homogeneous space, then need only be a local section over the submanifold.) The pullback of the Maurer-Cartan form along defines a non- degenerate -valued -form over the base. The Maurer-Cartan equation implies that :d\\\\theta + \\\\frac{1}{2}[\\\\theta,\\\\theta]=0. Moreover, if and are a pair of local sections defined, respectively, over open sets and , then they are related by an element of in each fibre of the bundle: :h_{UV}(x) = s_V\\\\circ s_U^{-1}(x),\\\\quad x \\\\in U \\\\cap V. The differential of gives a compatibility condition relating the two sections on the overlap region: :\\\\theta_V = \\\\operatorname{Ad}(h^{-1}_{UV})\\\\theta_U + (h_{UV})^* \\\\omega_H where is the Maurer-Cartan form on the group . A system of non-degenerate -valued -forms defined on open sets in a manifold , satisfying the Maurer-Cartan structural equations and the compatibility conditions endows the manifold locally with the structure of the homogeneous space . In other words, there is locally a diffeomorphism of into the homogeneous space, such that is the pullback of the Maurer-Cartan form along some section of the tautological bundle. This is a consequence of the existence of primitives of the Darboux derivative.

Early life Eells was born in Westmoreland, New York, in the rural western part of the state, in 1810. He could trace his family back to early settlers of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and his father was a Congregationalist missionary who worked amongst the Native Americans in Western New York. He was educated at home, probably primarily by his mother, before attending the nearby Clinton Academy and finally Hamilton College. Eells' constitution was feeble, and through all of his short life he struggled with tuberculosis and possibly other illnesses. Nevertheless, he was known amongst his friends and colleagues for his intense intellectual curiosity, drive, and \\"personal magnetism.\\" Besides his praiseworthy writing and oration, he often undertook seemingly impossible projects; for example, before going to Hamilton, in order to improve his health, he traveled on foot from Maryland to Massachusetts, then sailed to Newfoundland and back, paying for his passage by fishing. Origins of Alpha Delta Phi Samuel Eells studied at Hamilton College from 1828 to 1832, a time when both the college and American society were in turmoil. The college was nearly bankrupt due to mismanagement, and the student body was torn apart by rivalries between underground debating and literary societies, primarily the Phoenix and the Philopeuthian. College life at the time was intensely supervised and instruction was rigidly traditionalist. Eells saw the virtue of the debating societies as a haven for free thought, association and intellectual cultivation, yet he deplored their vicious competition for members and social dominance. In 1832, Eells gathered five students to form a new society, Alpha Delta Phi, which would cultivate intellectual debate and development in the manner of the existing literary societies, but put aside their social competitiveness. It would seek to develop the \\"entire man,\\" \\"moral, social and intellectual,\\" and create a community of caring and brotherhood. In writing the constitution and \\"ideals\\" for Alpha Delta Phi, Eells and his cohorts drew on the previously existing debate and literary societies, the few previously existing Greek-letter fraternities such as Sigma Phi and Kappa Alpha, liberal Protestant philosophy, the Enlightenment philosophy and traditions of the Freemasons, and the very early stirrings of Transcendentalist philosophy, which would become very influential later in the 1830s. Alpha Delta Phi was the second Greek-letter fraternity at Hamilton College, behind Sigma Phi, and as it founded more chapters, it also became the first fraternity at Harvard, Brown University, and several other institutions. When it founded a chapter at Miami University in Ohio, it became the first Greek-letter fraternity west of the Alleghenies, and the first anywhere outside of New York and New England. Subsequent career and philosophy After graduating from Hamilton, Eells moved to Ohio, where his father had already gone in the intervening years. On the way, he had a nearly fatal bout with cholera, but surprised nearly everyone by surviving and recovering. Once in Ohio, he supported himself by teaching at a small school that he founded himself. He studied law on his own, passed the Ohio bar exam, and began practicing on his own in Cincinnati. He prided himself on taking pro bono cases for poor or unpopular clients, and built enough of a reputation for himself that he was taken on as a partner by Salmon P. Chase; Chase was a famous lawyer and jurist who would go on to become a leading abolitionist and a justice of the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, Eells was delivering noteworthy speeches and orations, especially to meetings of religious and philanthropic organizations, many of which were subsequently reprinted and preserved. His speeches and essays were fervently religious and showed a progressive, optimistic philosophy. He spoke on the value of liberal education, including the study of art and the Classics, on history, and occasionally on controversial social topics. Several of these writings and speeches can be found in the \\"Memorial of Samuel Eells,\\" collected by his nephew James Eells in 1873 (Cleveland, Oh., Cobb, Andrews & co., 1873). Probably his most noteworthy work is the \\"Address to the Biennial Convention of Alpha Delta Phi: On the Law and Means of Social Advancement,\\" delivered and published in 1839. Here, he argues that the general law of human history is progress. Each successive phase of human history brings greater fellowship amongst all humanity and freedom for the individual soul. Although tyranny and suffering may prevail in certain places and times, truth and freedom will always overcome them in the long run. Absolute perfection may never be achieved, but human society will always be pushed forward towards true freedom. He asserts that only spiritual and philosophical change‚Äînot material advancement or political reform‚Äîcan lead to real progress; he cites the mistreatment of the Native Americans as proof that democratic government and law are not enough in themselves to preclude tyranny. Rather, Eells believes that the spread of Christianity around the world will help begin a new era of equality, justice and peace. While the trust that Eells places in Christian missionaryism may seem naive at best, one must remember that he was raised on a very liberal, humanistic strain of early-nineteenth-century Protestantism. His philosophy is clearly influenced by his family's Congregationalism, by Enlightenment humanism, by Hegel's dialectical philosophy of history, and by the philosophers of Transcendentalism and the Second Great Awakening, such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller and Amoso Bronson Alcott. Although his idea of unstoppable progress may seem very familiar or clich√© today, at that time it was connected to a radical counterculture that was overthrowing conservative beliefs in the continuous decline of humanity. Last years After his partnership with Salmon P. Chase, Eells endeavored to practice law on his own again. This couldn't last very long, because, as had long been expected, his health began to fall apart. Eells tried several tactics to try to recover his health, such as spending the winter of 1840 in Cuba, but nevertheless, he died in 1842 in Cincinnati at the home of his friend S. W. Pomeroy, wracked with arthritis and tuberculosis. The middle joint of his rheumatic ring finger remains in the possession of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity as a testament to his courage and willpower. Samuel Eells was buried in the Eells family plot in Woodland Cemetery in Cleveland, Ohio. Legacy Though noteworthy in their time, Eells' works are not widely read today and are treated mostly as historical artifacts. Alpha Delta Phi, however, is a thriving organization. It is divided into two branches‚Äîthe Society, with five chapters and two affiliates,Alpha Delta Phi Society and the all-male Fraternity, with dozens of chapters in the United States and Canada.Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity > Home  References  External links  Biography of Samuel Eells  1810 births 1842 deaths Hamilton College (New York) alumni Alpha Delta Phi founders Writers from Cincinnati American abolitionists People from Westmoreland, New York Activists from Ohio Activists from New York (state) Burials at Woodland Cemetery (Cleveland) ","title":"Samuel Eells"},{"id":"964193","text":"HMAS Stuart (formerly HMS Stuart) was a British Scott-class flotilla leader. The ship was built by Hawthorn Leslie and Company for the Royal Navy during World War I, and entered service at the end of 1918. The majority of the destroyer's British service was performed in the Mediterranean, and in 1933 she was transferred to the Royal Australian Navy. Although placed in reserve in 1938, Stuart was reactivated at the start of World War II to lead the Australian destroyer force, nicknamed the \\"Scrap Iron Flotilla\\" by German propagandists. The flotilla operated in the Mediterranean, with Stuart participating in the Western Desert Campaign and the battles of Calabria and Cape Matapan, defeating the Italian submarine Gondar, evacuating Allied troops from Greece and Crete, and serving with the Tobruk Ferry Service. The destroyer returned to Australia for repairs and refit in late 1941, and spent most of 1942 and 1943 in Australian waters. Stuart was modified into a stores and troop transport in early 1944, and operated in this role around Australia and New Guinea until early 1946. Stuart was placed in reserve in 1946, and was sold for ship breaking in early 1947. Design and construction Stuart was one of nine Admiralty-type (or Scott-class) flotilla leaders constructed during World War I for the Royal Navy.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 107 The ship had a displacement of 1,530 tons standard and 2,053 tons at full load. She was long overall and long between perpendiculars, with a beam of , and a draught of at full load.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 106 The propulsion machinery consisted of four Yarrow boilers feeding two Brown-Curtis turbines, which delivered to the two propeller shafts. Although designed with a maximum speed of , Stuart could reach on the measured mile during trials. Maximum range was at . The ship's company initially consisted of 183 personnel, but by 1936 had decreased to 167: 11 officers and 156 sailors. Stuarts 4.7-inch \\"A\\" gun mounting As originally designed, the ship's main armament consisted of five BL 4.7 inch /45 naval guns, which were augmented by a 3-inch gun for anti-aircraft defence.Gillett & Graham, Warships of Australia, p. 156 When Stuart entered RAN service in 1933, the ship's armament consisted of five BL 4.7 inch /45 naval guns, a QF 3-inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft gun, two QF 2-pounder naval guns (known as pom-poms), five .303 inch machine guns (a mix of Lewis and Maxim guns), six 21-inch torpedo tubes (in two triple mountings), two depth charge chutes, and four depth charge throwers. By 1941, two of the 4.7-inch guns had been removed, five 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft guns and a Breda gun had been fitted, and the depth charge chutes were replaced with depth charge rails. A year later, a third 4.7-inch gun was removed, along with two of the Oerlikons, the .303-inch guns, the Breda gun, and the torpedo tube sets. During 1942, a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar was installed. When Stuart was converted into a storesship and troop transport in 1944, her armament was changed to a single 4-inch gun, seven Oerlikons, three quad-barelled pom-poms, a Hedgehog, and a payload of depth charges. Stuart was laid down by Hawthorn Leslie and Company at their shipyard in Newcastle-upon-Tyne on 18 October 1917, and was launched on 22 August 1918. Stuart was one of only four ships in her class to launch before the end of World War I. The destroyer was completed on 21 December 1918 and commissioned into the Royal Navy on the same day. The ship's name comes from the royal House of Stuart, and the badge design depicts a Stuart royal crown and a Yorkshire rose: the Scottish Stuarts' claim to the English throne came from their descent from Edward IV of the House of York.Cassells, The Destroyers, pp. 110‚Äì111 Operational history =Royal Navy= After being commissioned in December 1918, Stuart spent most of her Royal Navy career operating with British forces in the Mediterranean, during which time she was mainly assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla, operating out of various locations including Malta.Halpern, The Mediterranean Fleet, 1919‚Äì1929, p. 302 In the immediate post war period, amidst the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire and civil war in Russia, Stuart was heavily involved in various operations. In 1919‚Äì20, Stuart saw service in the Black Sea as part of Royal Navy operations during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, being dispatched to Yalta in April 1919 as fighting broke out in the Crimea,Halpern, The Mediterranean Fleet, 1919‚Äì1929, p. 32 and later evacuating troops from the British military mission in March 1920 as Bolshevik forces advanced on Novorossiysk.Halpern, The Mediterranean Fleet, 1919‚Äì1929, p. 187 She also provided assistance to the Greeks during operations against the Turks, reinforcing the Aegean Squadron and escorting troopships during the occupation of Smyrna in May 1919,Halpern, The Mediterranean Fleet, 1919‚Äì1929, p. 66 and the during the landing at Panderma in July 1920.Halpern, The Mediterranean Fleet, 1919‚Äì1929, p. 247 In early 1921, Stuart was operating out of Constantinople, where the Allied forces had established an occupation force at the end of the war.Halpern, The Mediterranean Fleet, 1919‚Äì1929, p. 306 Royal Navy operations in the Mediterranean normalised after 1923, and in the latter part of the decade Stuart undertook various exercises and other routine duties as part of the Mediterranean Fleet.Halpern, The Mediterranean Fleet, 1919‚Äì1929, p. 520 Between 1928 and 1931, the ship was commanded by William Whitworth. In May 1933, the ship was decommissioned. Stuart, along with four V and W-class destroyers, were transferred to the RAN as a replacement for the Australians' previous complement of destroyers: Stuart was to replace the destroyer leader . Stuart commissioned into the RAN on 11 October 1933. The five ships sailed from Chatham on 17 October, and arrived in Sydney on 21 December. =Royal Australian Navy= Gondar evacuating as HMAS Stuart lays off Stuart spent the early part of her RAN career operating in Australian waters, and she was decommissioned into reserve on 1 June 1938. The destroyer was briefly reactivated from 29 September to 30 November 1938. She recommissioned again on 1 September 1939 under Commander Hector Waller, RAN. On 14 October, Stuart led the RAN destroyer flotilla from Sydney; the ships reached Malta on 2 January, and were redesignated the 19th Destroyer Division, nicknamed the \\"Scrap Iron Flotilla\\" by German propagandists. On 27 May, they were merged with the 20th Division to form the 10th Destroyer Flotilla.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 108 In July 1940, Stuart led the 10th Flotilla during the Battle of Calabria.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 109 Stuart was also involved in the Western Desert Campaign, providing gunfire support to army forces. On 30 September 1940, the destroyer attacked the Italian submarine Gondar, forcing her crew to surrender. Stuart supported the 6th Australian Division when it captured Tobruk on 22 January 1941,Bertke et al, The Royal Navy is Bloodied in the Mediterranean, p. 247 and participated in the Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941. During the battle, Stuart hit the Italian cruiser with a torpedo.Bennett, Naval Battles of World War II, p. 129 Stuart on Sydney Harbour in 1944, following her conversion She then assisted in the evacuation of Allied troops from Greece in April 1941 and the evacuation from Crete in May 1941. During June and July 1941, Stuart participated in the Tobruk Ferry Service: supply runs to the Australian forces besieged at Tobruk. The destroyer made 24 runs before she was forced to sail back to Australia with a disabled port engine. Sailing on 22 August, the ship arrived in Melbourne on 27 September, and was docked for repairs and refits until April 1942. After the refit, the destroyer was employed on convoy escort runs and anti-submarine patrols in eastern Australian waters. At the end of 1943, the destroyer was removed from service, and during early 1944, was converted into a storesship and troop transport. After conversion, Stuart operated in Australian and New Guinea waters until January 1946.Gillett & Graham, Warships of Australia, p. 157 The ship earned eight battle honours for her wartime service: \\"Mediterranean 1940\\", \\"Calabria 1940\\", \\"Libya 1940‚Äì41\\", \\"Matapan 1941\\", \\"Greece 1941\\", \\"Crete 1941\\", \\"Pacific 1942‚Äì43\\", and \\"New Guinea 1942‚Äì44\\". Decommissioning and fate Stuart was decommissioned into reserve on 27 April 1946.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 111 The destroyer was sold to T. Carr and Company on 3 February 1947 for ship breaking, and was delivered to the breakers yard on 21 February. After scrapping, the keel was buried in Kissing Point Bay, Putney, New South Wales.

Alpha Delta Phi was originally founded as a literary society by Samuel Eells in 1832 at Hamilton College in Clinton, New York. Its more than 50,000 alumni include former presidents and senators of the United States, and justices of the Supreme Court. The mission of the Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity is to provide a comprehensive and positive personal growth experience for all undergraduate and alumni brothers: social, ethical, leadership, scholastic, community service, and literary. Founding When Samuel Eells arrived on campus at Hamilton College, he found two existing literary societies, the Phoenix and the Philopeuthian, the latter of which he reluctantly joined. Eells quickly became disenchanted with both societies' unscrupulous recruiting tactics and dispassionately small sizes and considered creating his own society which would disavow what he described as jealous and angry competition between the two. Eells proposed to select members from both the Phoenix and the Philopeuthian and found a new society of limited membership based on \\"the loftiest of intellectual and moral ideals.\\" Portrait of Samuel Eells On October 29, 1832, Eells gathered four other members, two from the Phoenix and two from the Philopeuthian, to a meeting in his room. The other men were Lorenzo Latham, John Curtiss Underwood, Oliver Andrew Morse and Henry Lemuel Storrs. At that meeting Eells wrote the constitution and he and Latham designed the fraternity's emblem and symbols. Later in the year, other members were added and the first chapter of the Alpha Delta Phi was in full operation by the beginning of 1833. Alpha Delta Phi was the first fraternity to establish a chapter west of the Appalachian Mountains when it formed a chapter at Miami University in 1832 in low back middle kirkland hall at Union college in New York. This chapter preceded the formation of three national fraternities at Miami University known as the Miami Triad in the years that followed. The Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity is a charter member of the North American Interfraternity Conference (formerly known as the National Interfraternity Conference; NIC). A Brother of Alpha Delta Phi, Hamilton W. Mabie (Williams College, class of 1867), was the first President of the NIC. The Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity is today still a member of the NIC; as a result of its decision to admit non-male-identifying members, the Alpha Delta Phi Society was not able to maintain membership in the NIC. Alpha Delta Phi is both a social fraternity and a literary society. As part of this focus, the Samuel Eells Literary and Educational Foundation makes educational grants and sponsors annual literary competitions, which award cash prizes. Nomenclature and insignia =The Badge= The Badge is an oblong slab with rounded corners, displaying on a shield of black enamel a white Crescent bearing the letters Alpha Delta Phi. Above the Crescent is a green Star with a gold center, and below is the date 1832 in gold. On the back is engraved a Monument with crossed Sword and Spear. In addition, the members initials and surname, chapter, and year of graduation appear on the back of the badge. The Badge is only to be worn with suit and tie attire. The Badge is properly worn over the heart with the horns of the Crescent pointing over the right shoulder. =The Crest= The Crest, which is the coat of arms, consists of the shield or escutcheon divided vertically in equal parts of green and white. It is bordered in black and studded with pearls. There is a small gold line between the center part of the shield and the border which has no particular significance except as a line of partition. On the shield in honor point are three Greek letters, horizontally aligned, alpha, delta, phi in gold. Above the shield is an esquires helmet in profile facing left with visor closed. Behind the shield is a Sword and Spear, both pointing upwards and both crossed saltirewise. Flanking the shield and issuing from the scroll on either side are two gold sprays of laurel leaved in gold. Beneath the escutcheon is a motto ribbon bearing the Latin phrase \\"Manus Multae Cor Unum\\", meaning \\"many hands, one heart\\". The whole escutcheon is radiant, meaning rays emanate from the top between the Spearpoint and Sword and base. There is a nimbus of very fine stars around the outer perimeter of the lower nimbus. Beneath the scroll is the date 1832. =Brothers-In-Arms Statue= The Brothers-in-Arms statue is a unique memorial to the 2,300 men of the fraternity, of Canada and the United States, who served in World War I, and especially for the 93 Brothers who made the supreme sacrifice. =Pledge Pin= The pledge pin is a shield divided vertically with the left half colored green and the right half colored white. Rules regarding the wearing of the pledge pin are established by each chapter. Chapters University of Illinois chapter house, listed on the National Register of Historic Places In August 2015, the fraternity had 31 chapters and 3 affiliates, the oldest of which is at Hamilton College. Its regional alumni organization, the Midwest Association of Alpha Delta Phi, is more than 125 years old. Alpha Delta Phi also has the third oldest continuously-operating chapter in the North American Fraternity System, which is also the second oldest Alpha chapter, placed at Hamilton College. At Yale University, it was mostly brothers of Alpha Delta Phi who were invited to join the university's top-ranked senior society Skull and Bones. Students at Harvard formed a chapter of Alpha Delta Phi but disaffiliated to form the independent final club, the A.D. =Cornell chapter= Alpha Delta Phi Chapter House, Cornell University (2002 Photo) In 1877, the Cornell University chapter's alumni group built its first house for the undergraduates, which has been described as the \\"first house in America built solely for fraternity use.\\" The chapter has since moved to a different location on campus - into a house designed by John Russell Pope - but the original chapter house, designed and built by William Henry Miller, still stands.This house, erected in 1878, stands at 503 East Buffalo Street, according to an architectural profile of a nearby ŒîŒöŒï lodge, designed by the same architect., p.5 and following, accessed 4 Feb 2016. =Dartmouth chapter= Alpha Delta Phi's Dartmouth College chapter was the inspiration for National Lampoon's Animal House.Miller, Chris. The Real Animal House: The saga of the fraternity that inspired the movie. Boston, Mass.: Little, Brown, 2007. The movie was co-written by Chris Miller and Doug Kenney. The chapter was affiliated with Alpha Delta Phi from 1846 until 1969, when it broke away from the national organization and formed an independent one, Alpha Delta. Notable alumni The Foundation The mission of the 1832 Foundation is to solicit financial resources, provide faithful stewardship and engage in high quality ethical practices in support of the Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity and leadership development. The foundation aims to leave a legacy which builds leaders of good character and well balanced men. The Foundation is a self-governing, tax exempt corporation founded August 1961, under Section 501 (c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code. It accepts deductible donations from Alpha Delts and others and makes grants and loans to chapters, individuals, and institutions of higher learning. The grants are intended to promote intellectual interest or achievement with qualified educational and literary programs. The Foundation has its own Board of Directors and functions independent of but in communication with the Fraternity. The Convention The Convention is composed of one delegate elected from each undergraduate chapter and alumni organization, each delegate being entitled to one vote. Each August, the Convention is hosted at a different location and presided over by an Honorary Chairman, both of which are chosen by the Board of Governors. The convention hears annual reports from the Governors, approves the International's budget, decides constitutional questions and has appellate jurisdiction over decisions of the Board of Governors and the Chapters. Between the business and leadership training sessions, Conventions are characterized by considerable socializing. Brothers from all over the continent get acquainted, swap stories and songs, and raise a glass in the spirit of brotherhood. Whether as a voting delegate or as an observer, all brothers are encouraged to attend a Convention at some time. =Board of Governors= The Convention also elects the Board of Governors. There are eleven Alumni Governors, elected for three year terms, and a Student Governor elected annually. The terms of the Alumni Governors are staggered to provide continuity. There are other restrictions on who may be elected to assure that no region or chapter may dominate the Board. The Board of Governors generally holds four regular meetings each year. One of these is at the Convention; others are held at various chapter houses in the fall, winter, and spring. The Governors elect the President, Vice President, Secretary and Treasurer. The President, with Board approval, may appoint an Assistant Treasurer and committee chairmen, who may or may not be Governors. An undergraduate Assistant Secretary is elected by the undergraduate delegates of the Convention. The Board of Governors appoints Regional Directors to coordinate activities of interest to nearby chapters and alumni organizations. Hazing and controversy In 1922, William Duncan Saunders died of a skull fracture and ruptured aorta when he was roughly flung from a bed during an incident variously described as horseplay. The Hamilton chapter of the Alpha Delta Phi was not implicated in his demise. On October 9, 1996, 18-year old William Price, a pledge at the University of Washington was paralyzed after falling from a third floor window of the Alpha Delta Phi house. Price remained hospitalized for five months. Despite the fact that Price claimed that he was not intoxicated, he admitted that him and other fraternity members consumed alcohol that evening, and that he could not remember how he fell. The fraternity was fined $1,100 for underage drinking. In the fall of 2001, the Phi Kappa chapter of the Alpha Delta Phi in Connecticut was put under probation after a serious hazing incident where a pledge had to be treated for burns on his legs. In March 2002, the chapter was shut down after they violated conditions of their probation which included not throwing parties and providing alcohol to other students. Sharon D. Herzberger, Vice President for Student Services, stated that the chapter had \\"an ample history of violations.\\" In 2010, a pledge from the Cornell chapter revealed that they were forced to chug a slurry of dog food, tabasco sauce, and sour cream, and run relay races around the chapter house while intoxicated and being hit with dodgeballs by the active chapter. The pledges were also forced to run laps outside, nude in below-freezing weather. In November 2013, the Alpha Delta Phi house at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign was found to have over 50 safety violations after an initial inspection. Among many of the dangerous violations, investigators found broken windows, tripping hazards and expired fire extinguishers. Beer cans were found in the fraternity‚Äôs crawlspace, which is not meant to be used as a habitable space. In 2015, a female student of Duke University claimed that she was assaulted at an Alpha Delta Phi party after consuming a mixed drink which she claimed caused memory damage. The fraternity was placed under interim suspension. On April 14, 2015, Dartmouth announced that, Alpha Delta, previously a chapter of the Alpha Delta Phi, and inspiration of the 1978 movie Animal House was shut down indefinitely after it was discovered that they had branded the flesh of 11 new members. The fraternity was already under suspension for holding unregistered parties. In March 2018, the Johns Hopkins chapter of the fraternity was ordered to cease and desist social activities due to sexual assault allegations. The order was violated when members of the fraternity were found engaging in hazing practices and the chapter was then placed on interim suspension. In November 2018, members of the Alpha Delta Phi chapter at Duke University were accused of being unreasonably loud and messy along Chapel Hill Road in Durham, North Carolina. One homeowner filed a complaint to the local mayor, saying that the issues have been going on for many years and that attempts to resolve the matter have been unsuccessful. City leaders are currently investigating the case. The Society The Fraternity is a retronym used now to distinguish the all-male Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity from the gender-inclusive Alpha Delta Phi Society (discussed below). In general parlance, the Fraternity refers to itself simply as the \\"Alpha Delta Phi\\"; the Society uses either the \\"Alpha Delta Phi Society\\" or \\"The Society\\". =Fraternity-Society Agreement of 1992= The Brunonian (Brown University) chapter first initiated women into its local membership in November 1973, and this was followed by a proposal at the 1974 national convention to either allow individual chapters to admit women or to do so fraternity-wide. This debate was often contentious, with most chapters opposed, and some members lobbying for full admission of women, but a larger number wanting to ban women altogether or grant them some form of associate membership. In 1992, at the Fraternity's 160th Annual Convention held in Brainerd, Minnesota, an agreement allowed five chapters to withdraw from the fraternity (the Brunonian, Columbia, Middletown (Wesleyan University), Stanford and Bowdoin Chapters) and to allow those chapters wishing to be gender-inclusive to create their own organization, which resulted in the legal formation of two separate organizations, the all-male Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity and the Alpha Delta Phi Society, the latter of which granted each of its chapters \\"home rule\\" permission to determine its gender make-up. Under the terms of this agreement, the Fraternity and the Society would be completely separate and independent legal entities, with separate governing bodies. The two organizations were not part of the same entity and did not share membership, except for male members of the Society who joined before 1992. Both groups would be licensees who share the Greek letters and intellectual property such as history and songs. The agreement put limitations on both organizations as to where they could have chapters, and there were limitations on the Society's use of the name \\"Alpha Delta Phi\\". =Fraternity-Society Agreement of 2017= On August 12, 2017, at the Fraternity's 185th Annual Convention held in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the Fraternity and the Society entered into a new agreement that replaced the Fraternity-Society Agreement of 1992. The new agreement maintained the original rights of the two independent and legally separate organizations to license and share the Greek letters alpha, delta, and phi, and other intellectual property. The new agreement removed all restrictions on the Society's license to use the name \\"Alpha Delta Phi Society.\\" It also removed most of the limitations on where either organization could have chapters. The Society as a national organization is gender-inclusive, and the Society continues to espouse \\"home rule\\" for its chapters, allowing them to determine their own membership rules. As of today, every Society chapter has been a gender-inclusive organization since at least the date of the Society's founding (for chapters that predate the foundation) or since the creation of the chapter (for newer chapters).

The ship was laid down by the Cockatoo Docks and Engineering Company at Cockatoo Island Dockyard in 1959, and commissioned into the RAN in 1963. During the ship's career, Stuart achieved a number of historical firsts: she was the first RAN ship to fly the Australian White Ensign, and the first major vessel to be homeported at Fleet Base West. Stuart was paid off in 1991, a year later than originally planned; RAN commitments to the Gulf War saw several warships deployed to the Middle East, and Stuart was retained in service to boost local defence. The destroyer escort was sold for scrapping. Construction The first four ships of the River class were based on the Royal Navy's Type 12 frigate, and were intended to close the gap between ships and submarines in regards to anti-submarine warfare, following the rapid improvement of submarines during and after World War II.Cooper, in The Royal Australian Navy, p. 189 Stuart was laid down by Cockatoo Docks and Engineering Company in Sydney on 20 March 1959.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 344 She was launched on 8 April 1961 by the wife of John Gorton, then Minister for the Navy, and was commissioned into the RAN in Sydney on 28 June 1963.

The main improvement was the installation of the Australian-developed Mulloka sonar system. Delays and cost increases meant that Stuart did not re-enter service until 1983. In January 1984, Stuart became the first major RAN warship to be homeported at Fleet Base West in Western Australia.Jones, in The Royal Australian Navy, p. 249 Between May 1984 and September 1986, the ship was deployed to South East Asia three times.

She was built at Williamstown in Victoria, and commissioned into the RAN in 2002. The frigate is operational as of 2016. Design and construction The Anzac class originated from RAN plans to replace the six River-class destroyer escorts with a mid-capability patrol frigate. The Australian shipbuilding industry was thought to be incapable of warship design, so the RAN decided to take a proven foreign design and modify it. Around the same time, the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) was looking to replace four Leander-class frigates; a deterioration in New Zealand-United States relations, the need to improve alliances with nearby nations, and the commonalities between the RAN and RNZN ships' requirements led the two nations to begin collaborating on the acquisition in 1987. Tenders were requested by the Anzac Ship Project at the end of 1986, with 12 ship designs (including an airship) submitted. By August 1987, the tenders were narrowed down in October to Blohm + Voss's MEKO 200 design, the M class (later Karel Doorman class) offered by Royal Schelde, and a scaled-down Type 23 frigate proposed by Yarrow Shipbuilders. In 1989, the Australian government announced that Melbourne- based shipbuilder AMECON (which became Tenix Defense) would build the modified MEKO 200 design. The Australians ordered eight ships, while New Zealand ordered two, with an unexercised option for two more. The Anzacs are based on Blohm + Voss' MEKO 200 PN (or Vasco da Gama-class) frigates, modified to meet Australian and New Zealand specifications and maximise the use of locally built equipment. Each frigate has a full load displacement. The ships are long at the waterline, and long overall, with a beam of , and a full load draught of . A Combined Diesel or Gas (CODOG) propulsion machinery layout is used, with a single, General Electric LM2500-30 gas turbine and two MTU 12V1163 TB83 diesel engines driving the ship's two controllable-pitch propellers. Maximum speed is , and maximum range is over at ; about 50% greater than other MEKO 200 designs. The standard ship's company of an Anzac consists of 22 officers and 141 sailors. As designed, the main armament for the frigate is a 5-inch 54 calibre Mark 45 gun, supplemented by an eight-cell Mark 41 vertical launch system (for RIM-7 Sea Sparrow or RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow missiles), two machine guns, and two Mark 32 triple torpedo tube sets (initially firing Mark 46 torpedoes, but later upgraded to use the MU90 Impact torpedo). They were also designed for but not with a close-in weapons system (two Mini Typhoons fitted when required from 2005 onwards), two quad-canister Harpoon anti-ship missile launchers (which were installed across the RAN vessels from 2005 onwards), and a second Mark 41 launcher (which has not been added). The Australian Anzacs use a Sikorsky S-70B-2 Seahawk helicopter; plans to replace them with Kaman SH-2G Super Seasprites were cancelled in 2008 due to ongoing problems. Stuart was laid down at Williamstown, Victoria on 25 July 1998. The ship was assembled from six hull modules and six superstructure modules; the superstructure modules were fabricated in Whangarei, New Zealand, and hull modules were built at both Williamstown and Newcastle, New South Wales, with final integration at Williamstown. She was launched on 17 April 1999 by the wife of Admiral Chris Barrie, the Chief of the Defence Force, and commissioned into the RAN on 17 August 2002. Operational history In April 2003, Stuart was used to capture Pong Su, a North Korean-owned freighter involved in drug smuggling operations. Several people were arrested ashore as part of an Australian Federal Police operation on 16 April, but Pong Su refused police orders to sail to the nearest port. A New South Wales Police launch attempted to detain the ship, off Eden, New South Wales on 18 April, but was unable to do so because of heavy seas. Stuart was deployed to board and capture the merchantman after scrounging sailors from other ships to make up for those on leave for the Easter weekend, embarking a Seahawk helicopter, and taking onboard special forces personnel from the Special Air Service Regiment and the Clearance Diving Team. Accompanied by two police launches, Stuart intercepted Pong Su off Sydney on 20 April. The special forces successfully boarded the ship, and she was sailed to Sydney by a RAN steaming party. In 2004, Stuart was deployed to the Persian Gulf as part of Operation Catalyst. On 24 April, Stuart, the patrol boat , and the cruiser were patrolling around the Al Ba≈ürah Oil Terminal (ABOT) and Khor Al Amaya Oil Terminal (KAAOT), with Stuarts commanding officer in tactical control of the two American warships. Around 19:00, a dhow sailed into the KAAOT security zone. Firebolt sent a RHIB to board the dhow and order the vessel away, but as the RHIB drew alongside, the dhow exploded. Stuart, away, began sailing to assist, while the Australian ship's S-70B-2 Seahawk helicopter, away diverted to the explosion site. The Seahawk and a RHIB from Stuart began assisting survivors from Firebolts boarding party; after experiencing difficulty in handling the injured Americans, the Seahawk's sensor operator dived into the water to assist. Casualties were brought aboard Firebolt, then transferred by helicopter and boat to Stuart. Meanwhile, two more dhows attempted to attack ABOT‚Äîthe explosion of the first dhow was the prelude to a coordinated attack on the oil terminal‚Äîbut were fended off by the facility's Iraqi security team and detonated before reaching their targets. Three of the seven personnel aboard Firebolts RHIB were killed, and the other four were seriously injured. The Seahawk's sensor operator was later awarded the Medal for Gallantry for his actions during the incident. Stuart arriving at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii in 2006 shortly before participating in that year's RIMPAC training exercise In February 2006, fire broke out about , Stuarts sister ship, during an exercise off the coast of Australia. Te Manas Seasprite helicopter was diverted to Stuart, while the fire was put out by the crew. On the morning of 13 March 2009, Stuart was one of seventeen warships involved in a ceremonial fleet entry and fleet review in Sydney Harbour, the largest collection of RAN ships since the Australian Bicentenary in 1988. The frigate was one of the thirteen ships involved in the ceremonial entry through Sydney Heads, and anchored in the harbour for the review. On 22 March 2011, while operating off Somalia as part of Combined Task Force 151, Stuart machine-gunned an unmanned skiff being towed by MV Sinar Kudus, a hijacked cargo carrier operating as a pirate mother ship. The skiff was destroyed. This was the first time an Australian warship had fired in anger at Somali pirates. On 11 April 2011, Stuart interdicted the Yemeni-flagged dhow named Al Shahar 75. A boarding party from the frigate rescued three crew members being held hostage, while the fifteen Somali pirates, who had surrendered as Stuart approached, were allowed to return to their skiff and sail to shore after their weapons and equipment were disposed of. In October 2013, Stuart participated in the International Fleet Review 2013 in Sydney. In November 2014, Stuart and sister ship were deployed to shadow a Russian naval force operating in international waters off Australia during the 2014 G-20 Brisbane summit. The Russian deployment was believed to be in response to troubled recent relationships between the two nations. Stuart is the last ship of the Anzac class to undergo the Anti-Ship Missile Defence (ASMD) upgrade. The upgrade will include the fitting of CEA Technologies' CEAFAR and CEAMOUNT phased array radars on new masts, a Vampir NG Infrared Search and Track system, and Sharpeye Navigational Radar Systems, along with improvements to the operations room equipment and layout. Work commenced in early 2016, and is due to be completed by 2017. HMAS Stuart joined KDB Darulehsan, HMAS Sirius, USS Rafael Peralta and RSS Supreme on their way to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii in preparation for RIMPAC 2020 on 6 August.

Propulsion machinery consisted of three Yarrow boilers feeding Parsons turbines, which supplied to the ship's three propeller shafts.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 118 Although designed to reach , Swan was capable of reaching a maximum speed half a knot greater. Maximum range was at . The ship's company consisted of 4 officers and 67 sailors. The destroyer's main armament consisted of a BL 4-inch Mark VIII gun, supplemented by three QF 12-pounder 12 cwt guns. This was supplemented by three single 18 inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes and three .303-inch machine guns. Later in the ship's career, two depth charge throwers and four depth charge chutes were installed. Swan being launched on 11 December 1915 Swan was laid down by the Cockatoo Docks and Engineering Company at Sydney in New South Wales on 22 January 1913. She was launched on 11 December 1915 by the wife of Sir William Rooke Creswell, the First Naval Member of the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board. The destroyer was commissioned into the RAN on 16 August 1916, six days before construction work concluded. The ship's name comes from the Swan River in Western Australia. Operational history Swans first operation was with British blockade forces in the Far East, particularly around the Philippines, Celebes, and Malaya. On 2 July 1917, the destroyer sailed for the Mediterranean, meeting all five of her sister ships en route. The Australian destroyers were based at Brindisi as an anti-submarine force. The patrols were uneventful, and the only action Swan saw was when she was diverted to perform shore bombardments during the Second Battle of Durazzo on 2 October 1918. On 25 October, Swan and sailed to Port Said to meet a troop transport convoy and their Japanese escort, and accompany them to Salonika. The ship received the battle honour \\"Adriatic 1917‚Äì18\\" for her wartime service. After the end of World War I, Swan was assigned to an Allied fleet responsible for taking over Russian anti-Bolshevik naval units as Sebastapol. She then sailed in December with the French destroyer to report on conditions in the eastern Ukraine, although they reached their destination, an advance by Bolshevik forces caused the cancellation of the mission. Swan sailed to Gibraltar, where she, her sister ships, and the cruiser departed for Australia on 3 January 1919. Swan operated in Australian waters until June 1920, when she was placed in reserve. In 1925, the destroyer was reactivated and sent to Tasmania, where she spent the next two years alternating between operational and reserve status. Decommissioning and fate Swan was paid off for the final time at Sydney on 15 May 1928 and sold to Cockatoo Island Dockyard for scrapping in 1930. Swan and sister ship were stripped down, and their hulks were sold to New South Wales Penal Department and towed to Cowan Creek, where they were used to house prisoner labourers working on roads along the Hawkesbury River. Public outcry opposed this use of prison labour, so two hulks were sold in 1933 for 12 pounds each to George Rhodes of Cowan, New South Wales, who intended to use them as accommodation for fishers.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 119 Rhodes' plan did not gain government approval, and the ships were sold on to a pair of fishermen, who used them to transport blue metal to Milson and Peat Islands. On 2 February 1934, Swan and Parramatta were being towed down the Hawkesbury River for final breaking in Sydney, when gale conditions caused both hulls to break their tows. While Parramatta ran aground, Swan filled with rainwater and capsized at Tumbledown, near Croppy Point and Wobbly Beach. The exact location of the wreck was forgotten until 1994 When Greig Berry, a researcher/diver from the Central Coast claimed to have found it in 19 meters of water near Little Wobbie public wharf. He in turn was contacted by the DSTO and Berry showed them the site in 1996 and several sonar runs positively identified the remains as Swan. A RAN hydrography team came across the wreck while updating charts in 2001.

Swan was laid down by Cockatoo Island Dockyard at Sydney, New South Wales on 1 May 1935. She was launched on 28 March 1936, and commissioned into the RAN on 21 January 1937. Operational history =World War II= Swan served as an escort and patrol vessel during World War II and escorted many convoys, including the Pensacola Convoy, in Australian waters and the South-West Pacific. On 12 January Swan arrived at Ambon escorting Bantam with reinforcements and remained there until 18 January, engaging bombers during raids on 15‚Äì16 January. In late January 1942 the ship was assigned to the short lived American-British-Dutch-Australian Command. The ship was part of the escort, led by with the destroyer and , for a convoy composed of , , , and leaving Darwin before two in the morning of 15 February for Koepang carrying troops to reinforce forces already defending Timor. By eleven in the morning the convoy was being shadowed by a Japanese flying boat that dropped some bombs without causing damage before departing. The next morning another shadowing aircraft had taken position and before noon the convoy was attacked by bombers and flying boats in two waves. After the attacks the convoy continued toward Timor for a few hours with Houston launching a scout plane seeking the enemy position. ABDA suspected the presence of Japanese carriers, an imminent invasion of Timor and a support fleet lying in wait and thus ordered the convoy back to Darwin which it reached before noon on the 18th. Swan was in Darwin the next day when the Japanese attacked the port and was secured alongside , which had a cargo that included 100 depth charges. The ship managed to get underway and contributed fire in defence, but was heavily damaged by a near miss. The day after the attack Warrego escorted the damaged Swan through Clarence Strait. Three crew members were killed in the attack. On 2 September 1942 Swan with departed Townsville escorting Sea Witch, , and bound for Port Moresby and Milne Bay. joined to be the escort with Swan for Anshun and 's Jacob to Milne Bay while Castlemaine escorted Sea Witch and Taroona to Port Moresby. 4-in twin Mk XVI guns on HMAS Swan in action, 26 February 1945 General Kenneth Eather, GOC Australian 11th Division, accepted the surrender of Japanese forces in New Ireland from General Ito on board Swan on 18 September 1945. From late 1945 to August 1948 she was used to command the RAN's minesweeping operation in Australian and New Guinean waters. The ship received three battle honours for her wartime service: \\"Darwin 1942\\", \\"Pacific 1941‚Äì45\\", and \\"New Guinea 1943‚Äì44\\". =Post-war= Swan paid off to reserve on 18 August 1950, was converted to a training ship between October 1954 and February 1956 and recommissioned on 10 February 1956. Decommissioning and fate Swan paid off for disposal on 20 September 1962 and was sold for scrap to Hurley and Dewhurst of Sydney on 5 June 1964.

Constructed in Melbourne following the loss of HMAS Voyager, Swan entered service in 1970. During her career, the ship was deployed to South East Asia on several occasions as part of ANZUK forces. She was modernised in the mid-1980s, then was assigned to the recently opened west coast naval base . Following the integration of women into the RAN, Swan was the site of sexual harassment and discrimination claims, leading to an Australian Defence Force-wide inquiry. Swan paid off in 1996, and was sunk as a dive wreck off the coast of Dunsborough, Western Australia at the end of 1997. Construction Swan and sister ship were ordered in 1964 as replacements for , a destroyer lost following a collision with the aircraft carrier in 1964.Jeremey, in Stevens, The Navy and the Nation, p. 197 Although intended to be the same as the previous River-class ships (themselves based on the British Type 12 frigate), the design was changed from 1965 to incorporate many of the improvements of the British s.Jeremey, in Stevens, The Navy and the Nation, pp. 197‚Äì8 Work on the two vessels started without specifications or a contract, and the evolving design meant changes were being made as the ships were being constructed, with resulting delays and cost increases attributed to a lack of planning.Jeremey, in Stevens, The Navy and the Nation, p. 205 Swan was laid down by the Williamstown Dockyard at Melbourne, Victoria on 16 February 1965, and was launched on 16 December 1967 by the wife of the Minister for the Navy, Allen Fairhall.'HMAS Swan (III), Sea Power Centre The launching ceremony did not go entirely to plan; it took 11 attempts to smash the ceremonial bottle of champagne to christen Swan.Jackson, Top Wreck Dives of the World, pp. 106‚Äì7 Although the ship had not been completed, she was commissioned into the RAN on 20 January 1970.Jeremey, in Stevens, The Navy and the Nation, p. 198 She was the third ship of the RAN to be named for the Swan River in Western Australia. Swan cost $22 million to build.Jackson, Top Wreck Dives of the World, p. 106 Operational history =1970‚Äì1983= In October 1970, Swan sailed to Fiji, and was present in Suva on 10 October when the former British colony was granted independence. The warship was deployed to Singapore on 16 September 1971 for her first and only deployment to the Far East Strategic Reserve, which was replaced by ANZUK on 1 November. Swan operated as part of ANZUK until April 1972, during which she visited Japanese ports, served as escort to the Royal Yacht Britannia during a Royal Visit to Thailand, and participated in SEATO Exercise Sea Hawk. On her return to Australia on 17 April, the ship underwent maintenance, then spent the rest of the year on training exercises. After more exercises during the first third of 1973, Swan was docked at Williamstown for a refit from early April to early October, during which an Ikara missile system was installed. Sea trials and exercises took up the rest of 1973. 1974 started with Swan deploying to Hobart to serve as flagship for the Royal Hobart Regatta. On 25 May, Swan received a distress call from the disabled yacht Cutty Sark: despite rough seas and high winds, swimmers from the warship were able to recover the yacht's crew. In October, the ship sailed to Singapore for a deployment as part of the ANZUK force, and on the organisation's disbandment at the start of 1975, served as the Australian contribution to the Five Power Agreement. During the ship's time in South East Asia, which ended in April 1975, she visited multiple ports, participated in three multinational exercises, and received news that she had been awarded the Gloucester Cup for 1947, recognising her as the most efficient ship in the RAN. After returning to Sydney on 14 April, Swan spent the rest of the year alternating between maintenance dockings and training exercises. The early part of 1976 was spent performing port visits around Australia, before Swan docked at Williamstown for a refit, which lasted from May 1976 to February 1977. During 1977, amongst training exercises and maintenance dockings, Swan participated in SINDEX 77, a multinational exercise in the Indian Ocean. After training exercises in early 1978, Swan was forced to make an emergency docking in early March because of leakage on a stern gland. In early May, the warship was tasked with finding the yachtsman from Josephine II, which had run aground on Middleton Reef, but was unsuccessful (the sailor was later found at sea by another ship). Swan participated in several major fleet exercises during the latter part of the year. On 18 January 1979, while docked alongside the destroyer tender at Garden Island, Swan was evacuated when a bomb threat was made against the tender. After port visits along the eastern Australian coast, the warship underwent a maintenance docking for the majority of the year. In March 1980, Swan was deployed to South East Asia for five months. On 17 April the ship visited Singapore at the start of the deployment in South-east Asian waters, \\"for the first of three 'show the flag' visits. During this trip she visited 18 ports in eight countries, and also rescued 72 refugees from an overloaded boat in the South China Sea on 17 June.Naval Historical Society of Australia, On this day ‚Äì 1976‚Äì1999 The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Ian Macphee, announced that Australia would accept responsibility for the refugees.Zanker, MV Tampa The warship returned to its home port of Sydney in late August, and underwent a short maintenance period before visiting New Zealand near the end of the year. Swan returned to South East Asia for a seven-month deployment in 1981, during which she visited 22 ports. After \\"weathering a violent stormAround The World, p. 4 (5 September 1981) \\"China Visit,\\" The Straits Times\\", Typhoon Agnes ‚Äì part of the 1981 Pacific typhoon season ‚Äì in the Yangtze Delta, she became the first Australian warship to visit China in 32 years (and the first following the formation of the People's Republic of China), and the first to participate in joint training exercises with the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. During 1982, Swan became the only ship of her type to use the Fremantle Public Works slipway, and the first warship to use the hydraulic lift at the West Australian Maritime Support Facility at Cockburn Sound. The ship embarked on five consecutive deployments in 1983, travelling throughout Australia, Asia, and the Pacific for port visits and multinational exercises. =1984‚Äì1996= At the start of 1984, Swan went into Williamstown for a 20-month modernisation. During this time, the Limbo anti- submarine mortar was removed and replaced with two triple-barrel Mark 32 torpedo launchers, while other upgrades to her capabilities were made. Near the end of the modernisation, a large number of components had to be scrounged from sister ship Torrens to make Swan operational: for a time, the ship came to be known as Swarrens, as she was reputed to be half-Swan, half-Torrens. Swan reentered service in September 1985, and in December became the second ship of her class to be based out of in Western Australia: she was better suited to operating from the less-advanced western base as she was did not need the specialised technical and logistics support required by the s and s.Jones, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 249 Early 1986 was spent adjusting to operating conditions in the Indian Ocean, visiting ports along the western and northern Australian coasts, and undergoing training exercises. Mid-year, Swan undertook a two-month deployment to South East Asia. On her return, she spent the rest of the year alongside at Stirling for maintenance. Early 1987 followed the same pattern as the previous year's start, after which Swan sailed to Melbourne for a refit in March. This was completed in June, and after returning to Stirling, the ship travelled to the South China Sea to participate in the multinational Exercise Starfish. The rest of the year was spent undergoing training exercises with the United States, Malaysian, and Indonesian ships.

Swan is the upper ship in the third row from the left. 1988 started with a multitude of port visits to celebrate the Australian Bicentenary Year, followed by two deployments to South East Asia, the first from June until August, the second from October to January 1989. On her return, Swan was docked for a refit; she was the first RAN vessel to use the Jervoise Bay shiplift, and the first major warship refitted in Western Australia. The refit ran until September, and Swan spent the rest of the year undergoing training exercises. After visiting New Zealand and Sydney in early 1990, the ship embarked on a five-month deployment throughout Asia; travelling as far north as the top of Japan and participating in multiple training exercises with regional navies. 1991 started off with more training exercises and port visits. In April, all of the Ikara missiles carried by Swan were removed following fleet-wide instructions to cease use of the system. Another deployment to South East Asia was made from April to August, followed by a brief visit to the region in September and October: during the latter, Swan was called in to provide humanitarian assistance following the eruption of Mount Pinatubo. The warship visited South East Asia again from June to October 1992. During the 1990s, women were integrated into the RAN. The hasty implementation and the lack of preparation or education caused problems aboard several ships, particularly Swan.Spurling, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 281 In August 1992, a female Reserve medical officer reported that she had been sexually assaulted by a male officer. Although the male officer was acquitted at a court martial, other claims from female personnel aboard Swan came forward, including unsatisfactory living arrangement, sexual harassment, and gender-based discrimination. The Swan incidents became the centrepiece of an inquiry into sexual harassment across the Australian Defence Force (ADF), which found that although the rate of sexual harassment in the ADF was equal to other workforces, the attitudes and traditions evolved by the previously all-male military had to change.Spurling, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, pp. 281‚Äì2 The ship participated in multinational exercises off Darwin in May 1993, and after returning to Western Australia, made a series of port visits along the southern and eastern coasts of Australia while en route to Sydney. Swan then sailed to South East Asia to participate in multinational exercises, and returned to Stirling at the start of December. Maintenance and training exercises were carried out during early 1994, after which Swan left to circumnavigate Australia, visiting ports across Australia and in Indonesia during April, May, and June. On her return, Swan was docked for a refit, which lasted until the end of the year. 1995 saw the ship participate in fleet exercises around Australia: during a gunnery exercise off Shoalwater Bay, Swan fired 1081 shells, becoming the first RAN vessel since 1942 to fire her entire magazine in one event. In 1996, the destroyer escort was reclassified as a training ship. Swan was used to train midshipmen during the early part of the year, then sailed to Singapore for a final South East Asia deployment before returning to Fremantle to decommission. Decommissioning and fate Swan paid off on 13 September 1996. During her career, she travelled during 56,982 hours spent at sea. In November, the Australian government gifted the ship to the state of Western Australia. On 11 November 1996, State Minister for Tourism Norman Moore announced that the ship would be given to the Geographe Bay Artificial Reef Society to be scuttled and made into an artificial reef and dive site; the first deliberately prepared dive wreck in the Southern Hemisphere.Jackson, Top Wreck Dives of the World, p. 108 Swan was towed to Bunbury, Western Australia, and over the next twelve months, the ship was cleared of environmental hazards (such as oil and plastics) and diver hazards (such as cabling), and had access holes cut. The engine and boiler rooms were sealed off. After preparations were completed, the ship was towed to a point from Point Picquet (Meelup Beach), near Dunsborough, Western Australia. Swan was scuttled on the morning of 14 December 1997; an event observed by an estimated 10,000 spectators on shore, plus numerous spectator craft. The actual detonation was performed by a six-year-old child, whose father had won a raffle for the honour. Swan sank quickly at , in of water, and came to rest on the sandy bottom in a nearly upright position. The wreck is marked with red buoys at the bow and stern. Swan has been described as \\"an instant tourism hit\\"; A$2.4 million was contributed to the local economy through tourism earnings during 1998, and up to 15,000 dives are made at the site each year.Laurie, Thousands take a dive to get wrecked The site is host to an estimated 100 different species of marine life. The wreck's popularity prompted the acquisition of the destroyer and her sinking as a dive wreck off Albany, Western Australia in 2001. Swan's 4.5-inch Mk V/Mk 6 gun turret is preserved at Princess Royal Fortress, Albany, Western Australia. This turret is open and accessible to visitors.

Geography The terrain consists of rolling hills, deep canyons, and a coastal lagoon. Highest peak is Vail Peak, at . During the last ice age, the four northern Channel Islands, including Santa Rosa Island, were conjoined into Santa Rosae, a single island that was only five miles (8 km) off the coast. Santa Rosa Island is home to the rare Torrey Pine, a species of pine tree that exists only in two locations around the world. History =Early history= The ancestors of the Chumash Indians lived on Santa Rosa for many thousands of years, establishing numerous village sites along the coast and in the interior. Recent research has documented the presence of maritime Paleocoastal peoples on the island at least 12,000 years ago.Erlandson, J.M., T.C. Rick, T.J. Braje, M. Casperson, B. Culleton, B. Fulfrost, T. Garcia, D. Guthrie, N. Jew, D. Kennett, M.L. Moss, L.. Reeder, C. Skinner, J. Watts, & L. Willis. 2011. Paleoindian seafaring, maritime technologies, and coastal foraging on California‚Äôs Channel Islands. Science 441:1181-1185. The Chumash called the driftwood that washed up on the sandy beaches by the channel currents wimal. The logs were used to build tomols (plank canoes). Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo's crew visited the island after his death, and found three Chumash villages, containing a total of 40-50 people. They called their island Wima, but George Vancouver listed it as Santa Rosa on his 1792 chart. He reported that this name appeared on a Spanish chart in his possession. Franciscan missionaries baptized a large number in 1822 and most were removed to their Mission Santa Barbara and Mission San Buenaventura by the late 1820s. =Mexican land grant= George Nidever hunted sea otters for their pelts in the late 1830s and 1840s, under a license granted by the Mexican government to William Dana. Governor Manuel Micheltorena made a Mexican land grant of the island of Santa Rosa to brothers Jos√© Antonio Carrillo and Carlos Antonio Carrillo in 1843. They gave the island to Carlos' daughters, Manuela Carrillo de Jones and Francisca Carrillo de Thompson. Their husbands - John Coffin Jones (1796‚Äì1861) and Alpheus Basil Thompson (1795‚Äì1869) - entered into a partnership to manage the island. A claim was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852,United States. District Court (California : Southern District) Land Case 56 SD but the grant was not patented to Manuela Carrillo de Jones and Francisca Carrillo de Thompson until 1871, Report of the Surveyor General 1844 - 1886 though a district court confirmed clear title in 1856. Then, the Thompson-Jones partnership started to come apart in 1857. By 1870, the More brothers, consisting of Thomas Wallace (T.W.), Alexander (A.P.), and Henry had bought out all of the interests, and A.P. and Henry became joint owners of the island. They transformed the island into a large sheep ranch, with headquarters at Bechers Bay. =Vail Ranch= The More family sold the island to Walter L. Vail and John V. Vickers in 1902. The Vail and Vickers Company transformed the sheep ranch into a cattle fattening operation. =Recent history= The United States Army leased 46 acres for a radar post during WW II, and erected 16 buildings for 75 men, between Jan. and Aug. 1943. The site was abandoned after the end of the war. The United States Air Force built a 200-man, early-warning radar site in 1952 during the Cold War. At the same time, the United States Navy built a communication station on 4.5 acres on Navy Hill, to track missiles launched from Point Mugu NAS. The Air Force cancelled its lease in 1963. Standard Oil Company obtained an exploration lease in 1932, but came up empty. Richfield Oil Company in 1938, and Superior Oil Company in 1947 were equally unsuccessful. In 1971 Mobil Oil Corporation obtained a lease and drilled six unsuccessful wells, plugging and abandoning the last one in 1975. =National park= In 1980, Santa Rosa Island was included within Channel Islands National Park over the objections of Vail & Vickers, which then successfully lobbied to have the legislation stipulate that purchase of their land would be the highest priority of the Channel Islands National Park. Vail & Vickers sold the island in 1986 for nearly $30 million. Subsequently, the National Park Service issued a series of five-year renewable special use permits. Threatened lawsuits in 1996 resulted in a settlement agreement, which included the end of all hunting and ranching operations, such that only one steer remained by 1998. Vail's 25 year use and occupancy agreement ended in December 2011. In 2006 U.S. Representative Duncan Hunter (R-CA) introduced a provision into the annual defense policy bill that would allow disabled veterans to continue hunting elk on the island past 2011, without the consent of Vail & Vickers or the National Park Service. The provision stayed in the bill and was signed into law by President George W. Bush. This legislation was repealed by the next Congress as part of the FY 2007 Omnibus appropriations bill, also signed into law by President George W. Bush. Activities Munchkin dudleya, an endemic plant species Recreational activities on Santa Rosa Island include kayaking, camping and hiking. A private boat charter company offers a number of trips to the island year round, and camping reservations can be made through Channel Islands National Park offices in Ventura, California. A year-round charter flight service is available from Camarillo Airport for hikers and campers to Santa Rosa Island. Defined by the United States Census Bureau as Block 3009, Block Group 3, Census Tract 29.10 of Santa Barbara County, California. =CSUCI Research Station= In November 2012 the National Park Service (NPS) issued a permit to California State University, Channel Islands (CSUCI) to operate a field research station on Santa Rosa Island. The mission of the CSUCI Santa Rosa Island Research Station (SRIRS) is \\"to encourage and advance the interdisciplinary knowledge and stewardship of our natural and cultural resources through long-term research, inquiry-based education, and public outreach.

Great white sharks are fairly common in the northern Channel Islands (especially San Miguel and Santa Rosa) and feed on the abundant marine mammals. The rare endemic lichen Caloplaca obamae, discovered in 2007 and described by Kerry Knudsen in 2009, commemorates United States President Barack Obama. Santa Rosa Island has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb in the K√∂ppen climate classification). In winter, frosts are almost unknown, and in summer cool fogs make heat waves rare.

Structures commonly used pastels geometric shapes, and surfaces of stucco, sheet metal, and often stainless steel. Populuxe emerged after people began seeing semi- luxury commodities as luxury ware and mass consumer goods. It is also interpreted as a mass culture that desired luxury finishes on everyday material goods.

Because it was adopted by the Philadelphia Association of Baptist Churches in the 18th century, it is also known as the Philadelphia Confession of Faith. The Philadelphia Confession was a modification of the Second London Confession that added an allowance for singing of hymns, psalms and spiritual songs in the Lord's Supper and made optional the laying on of hands in baptism. History The confession was first published in London in 1677 under the title \\"A confession of Faith put forth by the Elders and Brethren of many Congregations of Christians, Baptized upon Profession of their Faith in London and the Country. With an Appendix concerning Baptism.\\" It was based on the Westminster Confession of Faith (1646) and the Savoy Declaration (1658), with modifications to reflect Baptist views on church organization and baptism. The confession was published again, under the same title, in 1688 and 1689. The Act of Toleration passed in 1689 enabled religious freedom and plurality to co-exist alongside the established churches in England and Scotland. This official reprieve resulted in representatives from over 100 Particular Baptist churches to meet together in London from 3‚Äì12 September to discuss and endorse the 1677 document. Despite the fact that the document was written in 1677, the official preface to the document has ensured that it would be known as the \\"1689 Baptist Confession of Faith\\".  Contents  The confession consists of 32 chapters, as well as an introduction and a list of signatories. # Of the Holy Scriptures # Of God and the Holy Trinity # Of God's Decree # Of Creation # Of Divine Providence # Of the Fall of Man, of Sin, and of the Punishment Thereof # Of God's Covenant # Of Christ the Mediator # Of Free Will # Of Effectual Calling # Of Justification # Of Adoption # Of Sanctification # Of Saving Faith # Of Repentance Unto Life and Salvation # Of Good Works # Of the Perseverance of the Saints # Of the Assurance of Grace and Salvation # Of the Law of God # Of the Gospel and the Extent of Grace # Of Christian Liberty and Liberty of Conscience # Of Religious Worship and the Sabbath Day # Of Lawful Oaths and Vows # Of the Civil Magistrate # Of Marriage # Of the Church # Of the Communion of Saints # Of Baptism and the Lord's Supper # Of Baptism # Of the Lord's supper # Of the State of Man After Death, and of the Resurrection of the Dead # Of the Last Judgment  Confessions  * The law's continued value - while Christ \\"abrogated\\" the Levitical ceremonial laws, the confession cites Christ to have \\"strengthened this obligation\\" which \\"for ever binds all.\\" * Forbids prayers for the departed whether faithful or damned * Sabbatarianism - A weekly Sabbath day is prescribed and believed \\"to be continued to the end of the world\\" but a 7th year annual sabbath is ignored (cf.

Laid down in 1911 and launched in 1912, the cruiser was commissioned into the RAN in 1913. During the early stages of World War I, Sydney was involved in supporting the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force, and escorting the first ANZAC convoy. On 9 November 1914, she defeated the German cruiser at the Battle of Cocos. During 1915 and 1916, Sydney operated on the North America and West Indies Station, before joining the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron at Greenock, Scotland in November 1916. On 4 May 1917, the cruiser was involved in an inconclusive action against the German zeppelin L43; neither was damaged. During late 1917, Sydney became the first Australian warship to launch an aircraft, and the first warship to do so from a rotatable platform. After the war's end, Sydney spent a year in reserve before being reactivated to serve as Flagship of the RAN. The cruiser was decommissioned in 1928 and broken up for scrap. Several sections of the ship, including her bow and foremast, have been preserved as monuments, and three of the ship's main guns saw later use in shore fortifications. Design and construction Sydney was a Town class light cruiser, of the Chatham subclass.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 138 She had a standard displacement of 5,400 tons. The cruiser was long overall and long between perpendiculars, with a mean of , and a draught of . Coal- and oil-fuelled Yarrow boilers were connected to Parsons geared turbines, which provided shaft horsepower to the ship's four propellers. Although designed with a maximum speed of , Sydney achieved a mean maximum of during trials. Her economical cruising speed was rated at in 1921, and in 1926. The standard ship's company was 376 strong, but during wartime, this would increase to the maximum of 475; 31 officers and 454 sailors. Loading of a 6-inch gun at Portsmouth in January 1919 The cruiser's main armament was made up of eight single BL 6-inch Mark XI guns.6-inch BL Mk XI guns on mounting P Mk VI. The Sight Manual. Admiralty, 1916. ADM 186/216 Secondary and anti-aircraft armament consisted of a single quick-firing high- angle anti-aircraft gun and ten 0.303-inch machine guns (eight Lewis guns and two Maxim guns).Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 139 Two 21-inch torpedo tubes were fitted, with a payload of seven torpedoes carried. Two hydraulic-release depth charge chutes were carried for anti-submarine warfare. A single 12-pounder 8-cwt field gun and four 3-pounder Hotchkiss saluting guns rounded out the armament. Armour plating consisted of side belts thick amidships, tapering to thick at the bow and stern, along with protective decking over the engineering and magazine spaces, and an armoured conning tower.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 38 Sydney was laid down by the London and Glasgow Engineering and Iron Shipbuilding Company at Glasgow, Scotland, on 11 February 1911. The ship was launched on 29 August 1912 by the wife of Admiral Sir Reginald Henderson. Sydney was completed on 26 June 1913, and commissioned into the RAN that day. The ship cost approximately 385,000 pounds to build. Operational history =Early career and initial war operations= Sydney with and in 1914 Sydney arrived in Albany, Western Australia on 19 September 1913, after completing her maiden voyage. The cruiser operated off eastern Australia until March 1914, when she sailed to Singapore to meet the two new Australian submarines and . The three vessels reached Sydney in May, and the cruiser was reassigned to patrols along the eastern coast. When World War I started, Sydney was north-bound to join Admiral George Patey and the battlecruiser . The ships were quickly assigned to protect the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force, which was used to capture German colonial assets in the region; Sydney participated in operations against Rabaul and Anguar Island in September. In October, Sydney and sister ship left Patey's squadron for Sydney, where they joined the escort of the first convoy delivering Australian and New Zealand soldiers to Egypt. The convoy sailed around the southern coast of Australia to Albany, then departed on 1 November for Colombo. =Battle of Cocos= Emden at the Battle of Cocos in 1914. On the morning of 9 November, the communications station at Direction Island, in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands group, was captured by the German light cruiser . Before capture, the station was able to transmit an SOS, which was received by the troop convoy, and Sydney was ordered to investigate. Emdens wireless operators had overheard the distress call and the orders to Sydney, and prepared to meet the Australian warship. Sydneys first indication of Emdens location was when the German ship began to fire at a range of . The Australian warship was able to fire for effect after two salvos, destroying Emdens three funnels, foremast, wireless and steering gear, and setting the engine room on fire. The German ship beached herself on North Keeling Island, and Sydney went after the supporting collier Buresk, but the ship had already commenced scuttling, and the Australian warship returned to Emden. The Germans were still flying their war ensign, but pulled it down after Sydney transmitted an instruction to surrender, then fired two salvos when no response was forthcoming.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 141 In the course of the engagement, Sydney had fired some 670 rounds of ammunition, with around 100 hits claimed.\\"Narrative of the Proceedings of H.M.A.S. Sydney\\", p. 459 She had meanwhile been hit sixteen times; three of her crew were killed and thirteen were wounded.Forstmeier, p. 20 134 German personnel were killed, with the rest of the ship's company were captured by Sydney (apart from a shore party, which commandeered the schooner Ayesha and escaped) and were delivered to British forces at Valletta, Malta. After leaving Malta, the Australian cruiser proceeded to join the North America and West Indies Station, arriving in Bermuda on 6 January 1915.Cassells, The Capital Ships, pp. 140‚Äì1 =Atlantic Ocean= Sydney spent eighteen months uneventfully patrolling along the west coast of the Americas. On 9 September 1916, the cruiser sailed for the United Kingdom, and after a brief refit in Greenock, joined the 5th Battle Squadron at Scapa Flow. On 15 November, Sydney was reassigned to the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron at Greenock. Painting depicting Sydney and L43 in combat On 4 May 1917, while patrolling in the North Sea with the cruiser and the destroyers , , and , Sydney took part in a battle with Zeppelin L43.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 143 The airship dropped 10 to 12 bombs towards Sydney which failed to hit the ship (although the airship claimed to have hit one of the cruisers; the first air attack on an Australian warship.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 47 The Zeppelin was driven off by anti-aircraft fire. In August 1917, Sydney docked at Chatham for a three-month refit. During this, was fitted with a new tripod mast and a revolving aircraft launch platform; the first fitted to any warship. On 8 December, after acquiring a Sopwith Pup aircraft from sister ship , Sydney became the first RAN vessel to launch an aircraft. On 17 December, the Pup was launched again, this time with the ramp rotated to face into the wind; the first launch of an aircraft from a ship-mounted rotating platform. The Pup was replaced by a Sopwith Camel in early 1918. On 1 June 1918, the aircraft was launched for its only combat sortie, after two German aircraft were spotted while Sydney and the rest of the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron were heading to Heligoland Bight for a raid. The Camel chased the two aircraft for and shot down one, but was then forced to break off when one gun jammed and the other ran out of ammunition. Unable to locate Sydney, the pilot ditched near the destroyer . The Australian cruiser was present at the surrender of the German High Seas Fleet on 21 November 1918, and was assigned to escort another Emden, the K√∂nigsberg-class cruiser named to honour Sydneys opponent at the Battle of Cocos. Sydney left England for home in April 1919. Initially, the cruiser only received one battle honour, \\"Emden 1914\\", for her wartime service; this was one of only three single-ship action honours awarded during the 20th century.Cassells, The Capital Ships, pgs 143, 207 Following an overhaul of the RAN honours system in 2010, Sydney was retroactively awarded two more battle honours: \\"Rabaul 1914\\" and \\"North Sea 1917‚Äì18\\". =Post-war= Sydney was paid off into reserve on 13 April 1923. Following a refit, she was recommissioned on 29 September 1924 to serve as Flagship of the RAN. Decommissioning and fate Sydney being scrapped, 1929 Sydneys tripod foremast at Bradleys Head Sydney paid off at Sydney on 8 May 1928 and arrived at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard in 1929, where she was broken up. The ship's foremast was retained, and in 1934, it was erected at Bradleys Head by the floating crane Titan.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 144 This initially served as a monument to the engagement against Emden, but was rededicated in 1964 as a monument for all Australian ships lost and all sailors killed in the line of duty. Part of the bow, including the stem head, jackstaff, and fairleads, was set into the seawall at Milsons Point, under the Sydney Harbour Bridge. One of the cruiser's derricks is on display in the Victory Memorial Gardens in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, and a compass stand is located at Port Macquarie, New South Wales. The main top-mast was erected at Environa, New South Wales, but rotted at the base and collapsed. It was later moved to Jervis Bay. During the 1930s, two of the 6-inch guns were transported to Western Australia, and in 1938 were installed at Buckley Point on Rottnest Island. These were withdrawn from service and placed in storage in 1944, then were sold to a scrap merchant in 1963. However, the dealer never collected them, and the guns remained on site until 1980, when army reservists retrieved and refurbished them, with one on display outside the Army Museum of Western Australia.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 146 Another of the ship's guns was used on Thursday Island from 1940 to 1987. In 2014 a shield removed from HMAS Adelaide during a refit in 1943 and dumped on a tip on the Mornington Peninsula, Victoria, was transported to Perth for refurbishment. A member of the Royal Australian Artillery Historical Society of Western Australia, which had been searching for such a shield for 20 years as a match for a 6-inch Mk XI naval gun it held from HMAS Sydney had spotted the shield at location. The naval gun and shield were installed at the Leighton Battery in September 2015 to replicate the original 6-inch guns at site.

Ordered for the Royal Navy as HMS Phaeton, the cruiser was purchased by the Australian government and renamed prior to her 1934 launch. During the early part of her operational history, Sydney helped enforce sanctions during the Abyssinian crisis, and at the start of World War II was assigned to convoy escort and patrol duties in Australian waters. In May 1940, Sydney joined the British Mediterranean Fleet for an eight-month deployment, during which she sank two Italian warships, participated in multiple shore bombardments, and provided support to the Malta Convoys, while receiving minimal damage and no casualties. On her return to Australia in February 1941, Sydney resumed convoy escort and patrol duties in home waters. On 19 November 1941, Sydney was involved in a mutually destructive engagement with the , and was lost with all hands (645 aboard). The wrecks of both ships were lost until 2008; Sydney was found on 17 March, five days after her adversary. Sydneys defeat is commonly attributed to the proximity of the two ships during the engagement, and Kormorans advantages of surprise and rapid, accurate fire. However, the cruiser's loss with all hands compared to the survival of most of the Germans has resulted in conspiracy theorists alleging that the German commander used illegal ruses to lure Sydney into range, that a Japanese submarine was involved, and that the true events of the battle are concealed behind a wide- ranging cover-up, despite the lack of evidence for these allegations. Construction and acquisition The ship was laid down by Swan Hunter & Wigham Richardson at Wallsend-on-Tyne, England, on 8 July 1933 for the Royal Navy as HMS Phaeton, named after the Greek mythological figure. However, in 1934, the Australian government was seeking a replacement for the light cruiser , and negotiated to purchase Phaeton while she was still under construction.Hore, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy in World War II, p. 65 The cruiser was renamed after the capital city of New South Wales, and was launched on 22 September 1934 by Ethel Bruce, the wife of Stanley Bruce, former prime minister of Australia and the serving Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. Sydney was commissioned into the RAN on 24 September 1935, drawing her ship's company from Brisbane, which had been decommissioned earlier that day. Following the announcement that Australia was purchasing a British-built cruiser, there was criticism, primarily from the Opposition of the day, stating that such a warship should be built using Australian resources and labour. Several reasons were given in reply for acquiring British-built cruisers instead of Australian-made: the ship was already close to completion, the pending threat of war meant that there was not enough time to train Australians in the necessary shipbuilding skills, and that of the two cruisers built in Australian shipyards, one () had taken seven years to complete. Design Sydney was one of three Modified Leander-class light cruisers acquired by the RAN during the late 1930s.Goldrick, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, opp. p. 96 Although the first ship of the class to join the RAN, Sydney was the second ship to be laid down, although the first to be completed, in what was sometimes referred to as the Perth class: and operated with the Royal Navy for a short period before they were purchased by Australia in 1938. Like most British cruisers, the Leanders were designed for long-range patrols, scouting, and trade protection duties. Sydneys displacement ranged between 6,701 tons (light) and 8,940 tons (full load), with a standard displacement of 7,198 tons: improved fabrication and welding techniques made her 52 tons lighter than her sister ships.Cole, The loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 1, p. 18 She had a length of between perpendiculars and overall, a beam of , and a draught at standard displacement between forward and aft. The ship was propelled by four Admiralty 3-drum boilers, feeding Parsons single-reduction geared turbines, which supplied to the four propeller shafts. Unlike the first five Leanders, which had their machinery arranged on the \\"in-line\\" principle (consisting of six boilers in three compartments forward, and four turbines in two further compartments aft), Sydney was designed with two redundant machinery groups, a design practice adopted from the United States Navy.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 1, pp. 15‚Äì16 The cruiser had two boilers and the turbines for the outer shafts forward, and two boilers and the turbines for the inner shafts aft; as steam from any boiler could be routed to any turbine, the ship could continue operating if one space was damaged. Each space had its own uptake, giving the modified ships a different profile to the single-funnelled early Leanders; an arrangement which contributed to naval historian Henry Lenton's description of the Modified Leanders as \\"the most handsome cruisers ever built by the Royal Navy, with a symmetry that was as attractive as it was functional.\\" Sydney and her sister ships were constructed from hull plating, with a armour belt over the machinery spaces (the lengthening of this belt from to adequately cover both spaces negated the weight reduction from their reorganisation), and plates over the shell rooms and magazines.Cole, The loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 1, p. 17 Sydney was the first Australian warship fitted with asdic; a Type 125 unit in a retractable pattern 3069 dome. The retractable sonar dome, located near the bow, was a weak point in the hull. One of the cruiser's early commanding officers, Royal Navy Captain J.W.A. Waller, believed that the ship's single director control tower was a weak point in the design. The director control tower was the highest compartment on the ship, from where personnel would determine the range and optimum firing angle for a gun salvo, then transmit this information to the gun turrets: the actual firing could be controlled from the tower or the turret. Waller believed that the centralised system could be destroyed with a single hit, or the wiring linking the compartment to the turrets could be severed, forcing the four turrets to rely on independent control. Although Waller suggested that a second tower be installed aft to provide redundancy, it was deferred indefinitely as subsequent commanding officers did not share his concerns, and combat experiences of other Leander-class cruisers showed that the system was more robust than expected. =Armament= Sydneys main armament consisted of eight 6-inch (150 mm) breech-loading Mk XXIII guns mounted in four Mk XXI twin turrets: \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" forward, \\"X\\" and \\"Y\\" aft. All eight guns could be fired in salvo, elevated to an angle of 60¬∞ and depressed to ‚àí5¬∞, and fire eight rounds a minute at targets up to away.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 1, p. 19 Sailors working on the diameter barrels of \\"A\\" turret, following the Battle of Cape Spada in 1940 Four 4-inch (100 mm) quick-firing Mk V guns, mounted on single, high-angle, Mk IV mountings, were fitted to a platform around the aft funnel. These were primarily used to target aircraft at heights up to , but could also be used against surface targets, with a maximum range of . Their replacement with eight Mk XIX high-angle/low-angle guns in four twin mounts, which was to occur in the late 1930s, was prevented by the outbreak of World War II. The guns could have been swapped out during a maintenance docking, but the demand for cruisers and Sydneys fortune in never sustaining major damage meant that the additional time in dock could not be justified. For close-range anti-aircraft defence, the 4-inch guns were supplemented by twelve Vickers Mk III machine guns, which were arranged in three Mk II quadruple mountings, one on each side of the forward superstructure, and the third on top of the aft superstructure. A mixture of 0.303-inch (7.7 mm) machine guns were used for close defence work, and could be fitted to pedestals at various points on the ship, primarily around the bridge and on the three searchlight platforms (one either side of the forward funnel, the third raised above the aft superstructure). At launch, Sydney carried fourteen Lewis machine guns and two Vickers machine guns, but by the start of World War II, the Lewis guns had been reduced to nine, and the Vickers guns removed completely. Eight 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes were fitted in two QR Mk VII quadruple mounts to the deck below the platform for the 4-inch guns.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 1, p. 18 Only eight Mark 9 torpedoes were carried. Sydney was fitted with a single depth charge rail at the stern, which held five Mk VII depth charges. Four 3-pounder (47-mm, 1.9-in) quick-firing Hotchkiss guns were carried as saluting guns. These were removed during the August 1940 refit. Sydney was fitted with a , cordite-powered revolving catapult between the two funnels, which was used to launch a Supermarine Walrus (sometimes described as a Seagull V) amphibious aircraft.ANAM, Flying Stations, pp. 20‚Äì21 The Walrus was operated by Royal Australian Air Force personnel from No. 5 Squadron RAAF (which was redesignated No. 9 Squadron RAAF in 1939).ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 20 The 7-ton electric crane used to recover the aircraft also served to deploy most of the ship's boats. Operational history =Early history= Sydney completed working up trials before sailing from Portsmouth on 29 October 1935, Captain J.U.P. Fitzgerald RN in command. Almost immediately after departing, Sydney was instructed to join the Royal Navy's Mediterranean Fleet at Gibraltar and assist the 2nd Cruiser Squadron in enforcing economic sanctions against Italy in response to the Abyssinian crisis. During January 1936, the cruiser underwent maintenance in Alexandria and visited medical facilities in Cyprus: cases of rubella and mumps had been circulating through the ship's company since late 1935. In March, Sydney was reassigned the 1st Cruiser Squadron, where she and the heavy cruiser continued to enforce sanctions and participate in fleet exercises with Royal Navy units. Following the resolution of the Abyssinian crisis, Sydney departed for Australia on 14 July; reaching Fremantle in late July before visiting Melbourne on 8 August and arriving in her namesake city three days later. Sydney, circa 1935 After reaching Australian waters, Sydney spent most of her time on fleet exercises and training cruises. In 1938, the cruiser was one of several RAN units prepared to respond to the Munich crisis, but all ships stood down after the potential war was averted. From 17 to 19 April 1939, Sydney was one of eight warships involved in a joint forces trade protection exercise off the south-east Australian coast. In early August 1939, Sydney was in Darwin, prior to visiting the Netherlands East Indies. However, in response to the events which prompted the start of World War II, Sydney was ordered to sail to Fremantle on a war footing, where she arrived on 22 August. =Start of World War II= Following the declaration of war, Sydney was instructed to carry out patrol and escort duties in Australian waters. Captain John Collins took over command of Sydney on 16 November. On 28 November, Sydney joined the Australian heavy cruisers and in an unsuccessful four-day search for the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee, which was known to be operating in the Indian Ocean. Sydney was relieved by on 13 December, and sailed to Cockatoo Island Dockyard in Sydney for a maintenance docking. The work was completed in late January 1940, and as a shakedown cruise Sydney joined Canberra and the British ships Leander and in escorting the Suez-bound Anzac convoy US 1; Sydney broke off after the convoy left the east coast of Australia and returned to Sydney. Returning to Fremantle on 6 February, Sydney relieved Australia as the cruiser responsible for patrol and escort duties on the west coast. On 19 April, Sydney joined thse escort of Anzac convoy US 2 off Albany, and remained with the convoy until it reached the Cocos Islands on 28 April and was replaced by . The Australian cruiser set course for Fremantle, but on 1 May was assigned to the East Indies Station and rerouted to Colombo, where she arrived on 8 May. Arriving in Colombo on 8 May, Sydney was immediately tasked with meeting Anzac convoy US 3 off the Cocos Islands and escorting it across the Indian Ocean. The cruiser departed on 12 May, but while en route, she was instructed to make for the Mediterranean. Arriving back in Colombo on 18 May, Sydney replenished before sailing at high speed to Aden, where she arrived four days later. The Australian cruiser, accompanied by HM Ships and , departed the next day, with the ships crossing the Suez Canal during the night of 25‚Äì26 May, and arriving in Alexandria that afternoon at 15:30. Sydney was originally marked for operations in the Red Sea, but after observing the performance of an Australian five-destroyer flotilla assigned to the British Mediterranean Fleet, Admiral Andrew Cunningham decided to \\"keep the Australian cruiser for himself\\" and attached Sydney to the Royal Navy's 7th Cruiser Squadron.Grove, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy in World War II, p. 39 =Mediterranean operations= Sydney was in Alexandria harbour on 10 June 1940, and that evening learned of Italy's intention to declare war at midnight. By 01:00 on 11 June, all ships in harbour had departed to search for Italian warships in position to attack Alexandria, and secure the sea lines of communication in the eastern Mediterranean and Aegean. The Australian cruiser was involved in the westbound sweep, and sailed as far as the Gulf of Taranto during the four- day operation. Apart from an unsuccessful depth charge attack on a suspected submarine during the afternoon of 13 June, Sydney did not encounter any enemy vessels. 4-inch guns on HMAS Sydney On 21 June, Sydney fired in anger for the first time, joining the British cruisers and , the French battleship Lorraine, and a force of destroyers in shelling the Italian-controlled Libyan port of Bardia. Sydney focused her fire on a military camp throughout the twenty-two- minute bombardment. During this operation, the Australian ship's Walrus amphibian performed bombardment spotting for the squadron, but was fired on by three biplanes: although reported at the time as Italian Fiat CR.42s, the attackers were later determined to be British Gloster Gladiators.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 27 The pilot flew the damaged aircraft to Mersa Matruh, and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his skill in doing so, but the unrepairable Walrus was the only casualty of the operation. The next day, a retaliatory airstrike against the ships, by then having returned to Alexandria, failed to do damage. That same day, Germany and Vichy France signed the Second Armistice at Compi√®gne: although French warships (which had until that point operated with the Allies) were ordered to return to France and disarm, the British government was unwilling to allow them to fall into Axis hands. Sydney and the British warships in Alexandria turned their guns on the French, but unlike the situation in Mers-el-K√©bir, which deteriorated into a naval battle, British Admiral Cunningham and French Admiral Ren√©-Emile Godfroy peacefully negotiated to disarm the ships at Alexandria. Sydney and other elements of the 7th Squadron sailed from Alexandria on 27 June, escorting a Malta convoy. Late on 28 June, the ships engaged a force of three Italian destroyers carrying out a ressuply mission to Tobruk. Although two Italian vessels were able to continue their way, the third, Espero was disabled. At 20:00, Sydney (which had little opportunity to fire during the engagement) was detailed to recover any survivors and sink the destroyer while the rest of the force continued on to Malta. However, while from Espero, the Italian ship fired two shells, both of which fell in line with but short of the cruiser. Sydney opened fire, and after four salvos struck the destroyer with no shots fired in return, resumed the approach. Espero sank at 20:35, and Sydney remained in the area for almost two hours to collect survivors despite the risk of submarine attack, before she was ordered to withdraw to Alexandria. The cruiser rescued 47 Italians (three of whom died from wounds during the return voyage), and left a fully provisioned cutter in the water to be used by other Italian survivors after Sydney had departed. On the evening of 7 July, Sydney departed from Alexandria as part of a fleet including four other light cruisers, three battleships, an aircraft carrier, and sixteen destroyers, divided into three groups. The three groups were to rendezvous on 9 July at a point east of Cape Passero and from Malta, at which point the destroyers would escort two convoys outbound from Malta, while the other vessels would attack targets of opportunity around Sicily. However, early on 8 June, the British submarine reported that she had unsuccessfully attacked an Italian fleet including two battleships. Throughout the day, the fleet had to defend itself from multiple Italian air raids: at one point Sydney and the other cruisers of the 7th Squadron attacked what they thought was a high- flying bomber, but was later determined to be the planet Venus. Aerial reconnaissance located the Italian force during the afternoon, which was made up of at least two battleships, accompanied by multiple cruisers and destroyers. The sightings of such a large force of warships, combined with the heavy air attack, led Admiral Andrew Cunningham to conclude that the Italians were also covering a major convoy, and decide to reposition his fleet between the Italians and Taranto, the projected destination. Contact with the Italian fleet was lost during the night, but regained in the morning of 9 July. By 14:00, the Allied fleet had positioned itself in the Italians' path, and Cunningham ordered them west, to close on the projected position of the enemy and engage. Sydney spotted smoke at 14:45, and made visual contact with a force of five cruisers just after 15:00. The Allied cruiser squadron, supported by the battleship altered their course northward, and at 15:20, Sydney opened fire on an Italian Zara-class cruiser, distant, but both the Allied and Italian cruiser forces were unable to successfully hit their opposing numbers. Sydney remained unsuccessful until the late part of the engagement, when she successfully shelled a smokescreen-laying destroyer. The naval component of what came to be known as the Battle of Calabria concluded around 17:00, with Cunningham unwilling to pursue the Italian fleet through the smokescreen they had created. The Allied ships instead broke off for Malta, while enduring several heavy but ineffective air attacks; during the safe delivery of Malta Convoy MA 5 and the return to Alexandria on 13 July, Sydney sustained no damage, but expended all her anti-aircraft ammunition.Grove, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy in World War II, p. 40 Sydneys participation in the battle earned the ship a battle honour: \\"Calabria 1940\\". Sailors from Sydney posing around and in the forward funnel shellhole. This was the only damage received by the Australian cruiser during the battle of Cape Spada. The Australian cruiser spent five days in Alexandria for resupply and maintenance, before departing for Crete with the British destroyer . They arrived at sunset on 18 July, and the next morning, the two ships were ordered to patrol the Gulf of Athens for Axis warships and shipping, while providing support for a four-ship destroyer force (HM Ships , , , and ) conducting an anti-submarine sweep north of Crete. Believing that these two tasks were incompatible, and that protecting the destroyers was the more important, Sydneys commander, Captain John Collins, ordered the two ships to move south of their patrol area while maintaining radio silence.Goldrick, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 112 At 07:20 on 19 July, the destroyer force spotted and was spotted by a pair of Italian light cruisers; Giovanni dalle Bande Nere and Bartolomeo Colleoni, which opened fire seven minutes later. The British destroyers turned to a north-east heading and set off at , broadcasting news of the attack to the silent Sydney while closing the gap between the two forces. Using the wireless signals to track the four destroyers, Sydney and Havock made to intercept the destroyers and their cruiser pursuit, and was able to close at least half an hour earlier than if they had followed their original instructions: when Sydney opened fire on Bande Nere at 08:29, both sides were surprised by the appearance of the cruiser. Within minutes, Sydney had successfully damaged Bande Nere, and when the Italians withdrew to the south, the six Allied ships pursued. At 08:48, with Bande Nere hiding behind a smoke screen, Sydney shifted her fire to Bartolomeo Colleoni, which was disabled by 09:33. Collins ordered the destroyers to torpedo the ship and rescue survivors: Hyperion, Ilex, and Havock did so, while Hero and Hasty supported Sydney in continuing pursuit of Bande Nere. At 10:37, the chase ended, as the faster Italian cruiser had outrun the Allies, visibility was reduced by smoke and haze, and ammunition aboard the pursuing ships was low: Sydney had ten shells left for her forward turrets. The six ships returned to Alexandria around 11:00 on 20 July after fending off several air attacks (one of which damaged Havock), and were met by cheering from all ships in the harbour. The only damage to Sydney during what came to be known as the Battle of Cape Spada was caused by a shell at 09:21, which knocked a hole in the forward funnel, and wounded a sailor through splinter damage. For his actions, Collins was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath, while other officers and sailors from Sydney received two Distinguished Service Orders, two Distinguished Service Crosses, five Distinguished Service Medals, and twelve Mentions in Despatches between them. Sydney herself was awarded the battle honour \\"Spada 1940\\". After refuelling and rearming, Sydney and departed Alexandria on 27 July to join the covering force for a southbound convoy from the Aegean. The ships were attacked five times that afternoon by aircraft, but Sydney escaped with only minor damage and shrapnel wounds. The two cruisers broke away from the convoy the next day to locate and sink the Greek tanker Ermioni, which was supplying the Italian- held Dodecanese Islands. The two cruisers located Ermioni just before dusk: Sydney provided anti-submarine protection while the tanker's crew were convinced to transfer to the British warships, after which Ermioni was shelled by Neptune. The two ships returned to Alexandria on 30 July, and Sydney departed the same day in company with for a three-day patrol. Sydney underway in August 1941. The ship's first camouflage pattern can be seen on the starboard flank. Shortly after this photograph was taken, the camouflage pattern was changed. Back in Alexandria, Sydney underwent a refit, during which a high, thick wall of armour plating was constructed around the 4-inch gun platform, while the ship's company repainted the ship from standard grey to a naval camouflage pattern. The refit was completed by 12 August, when Sydney, Neptune, and five destroyers set off to interdict Axis shipping along the north African coast and the Aegean Sea. The operation was cancelled after no ships were located during the first two days, and Sydney was tasked with assisting a destroyer squadron during shore bombardments at Bomba and Bardia. At the end of the month, the cruiser joined the escort of Malta convoy MB 5. On the return voyage, Sydney and several other vessels were tasked with attacking Italian facilities.Hore, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy in World War II, p. 73 Canvas and timber were used to alter the cruiser's profile to resemble an Italian Condottieri-class cruiser, allowing her to manoeuvre close to Scarpanto during the night of 3‚Äì4 September. At dawn, Sydney and the British destroyer Ilex attacked the Italian Makri Yalo Airbase at Scarpanto; the cruiser fired 135 shells in 25 minutes, while the destroyer fended off five E-boats, sinking two. On completion, the two ships rejoined the fleet, but were again mistaken for Italian warships and nearly fired on before Sydney raised the White Ensign and cut down her disguise. Admiral Cunningham congratulated Sydney with the message \\"Well Done. You are a stormy petrel.\\", which was adopted as a nickname for the cruiser. On her return to Alexandria, the Australian cruiser underwent another short refit, which was completed late in the month: on 24 September Sydney supported during the interception of a French merchant ship, then completed a two-day patrol west of Cyprus. Late on 28 September, Sydney joined the heavy escort of a Malta-bound troop convoy. During the return voyage, Sydney and left the fleet on 1 October for a sweep of the Aegean Sea, which was concluded with a brief bombardment of Maltezana before returning to Alexandria two days later. Group portrait of the 645-strong ship's company following the action against Bartolomeo Colleoni in July 1940 The entire Mediterranean fleet sailed from Alexandria on 8 October to provide cover for several Malta Convoys, and attempt to draw the Italian fleet into battle.Hore, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy in World War II, p. 74 The convoys reached their destination safely, and the operation was uneventful for Sydney; the only contact with Italian forces was an engagement during the early morning of 12 October between the British cruiser and seven Italian torpedo boats and destroyers, of which Ajax sank three and damaged a fourth. From 25 October, Sydney, Orion, and the destroyers and were engaged in a sweep of the Aegean for Axis vessels, reaching as far north as the Dardanelles. No major incidents occurred until 28 October, when the Italians invaded Greece: the four ships were recalled to Alexandria, where they arrived that evening. Shortly after, the two cruisers were joined by HM Ships and and met the main force of the Mediterranean fleet west of Crete on 30 October. Over the next few days, the warships patrolled around Crete and along the Greek mainland, and provided cover for the first supply convoy to Crete. On 5 November, Sydney and departed from Port Said with military equipment to be used to establish an Allied advanced base at Souda Bay, Crete. After delivering the equipment, which included almost 1,000 soldiers, the equipment for a Bofors battery, cases of food, and several trucks, the cruisers rejoined the main fleet. The Mediterranean Fleet remained on patrol for several days, and during the night of 11‚Äì12 November, while the bulk of the fleet supported the world's first all-naval-aircraft attack on the Italian fleet anchored in Taranto, Sydney, Ajax, Orion and the destroyers and attempted to transit the Strait of Otranto as a diversion. Despite the mission of \\"looking for trouble\\", the northbound passage through the strait passed without incident. The return was not so uneventful: at 01:20, a convoy of four merchantmen with two escorting destroyers was spotted by Sydneys lookouts. The Allied warships manoeuvred in close, and opened fire at 01:27: Sydney directing her fire onto a freighter away. During the 23-minute engagement, the cruiser successfully contributed to the destruction of three merchant ships and damaged a destroyer, avoided a torpedo, and unsuccessfully fired two in return. At 01:57, the undamaged Allied force departed the strait, and met the main fleet before midday. From 15 to 20 November, Sydney and three other cruisers transported 4,000 Allied soldiers and their equipment from Alexandria to the Piraeus as reinforcements for the Greek military.Hore, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy in World War II, p. 75 On returning to Alexandria, Sydney deployed with the majority of the Mediterranean fleet to cover multiple convoys across the sea: the Australian cruiser spent the remainder of the month operating throughout the eastern and central Mediterranean, and was bombed by Italian aircraft on 24 November at Souda Bay, but escaped damage. Sydney started December in the Aegean, where she escorted convoys and shelled the port of Valona, then proceeded to Malta for a refit and repairs to her rudder, which lasted until the end of the year. During this refit, the cruiser was fitted with degaussing equipment. The ship rejoined the fleet on 8 January 1941, when she was instructed to head home after proceeding along the north coast of Africa and linking up with any Australia-bound merchant ships she encountered. The recall was attributed to the need to bring Sydney in for a major refit and give her personnel leave, a plan to spread combat experience throughout the RAN by trading the cruiser with her sister ship, , and a need to protect Australia against the German merchant raiders operating in the area, particularly following the attacks on Nauru.Goldrick, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, pp. 110‚Äì11Grove, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy in World War II, p. 42 Sydney manoeuvring to come alongside at Sydney Cove on 10 February 1941 Before leaving, 100 of the ship's company were removed on 11 January, so they could be sent to England to help man the new N-class destroyers. The next day, the ship sailed for Aden via the Suez Canal. Sydney and the troopship left Aden on 16 January to join Convoy SW 4B, which Sydney escorted until relieved by four days later. The Australian cruiser was instructed to attack any Italian ships at Mogadiscio, but as there were no large merchant ships in port and Sydney was forbidden to attack the harbour itself, she then proceeded to the Seychelles to refuel. On 24 January, Sydney was one of several warships which responded to an attack on the merchantman Mandasor by the German merchant raider Atlantis. Despite a three-day search, Sydney did not come into contact with Atlantis. Sydney resumed her voyage home, and arrived in her namesake city after sunset on 9 February. The cruiser anchored in Watsons Bay for the night, then sailed into the inner harbour the next morning and tied up alongside at Sydney Cove to a heroes' welcome. On 11 February, a holiday was declared for school students in Sydney, so they could join the thousands of people who witnessed the ship's company perform a freedom of entry march. As well as the battle honours for the battles at Calabria and Cape Spada, Sydney was granted the \\"Mediterranean 1940\\" battle honour for her various actions during the Mediterranean naval campaign. During the eight-month deployment, the only fatality in the ship's company was a death due to illness. =Australian waters= Following a short refit, Sydney sailed for Fremantle on 27 February, where she was assigned to escort and patrol tasks in the Indian Ocean. This primarily involved meeting convoys off the southern Australian coast and escorting them on the next leg of their journey, either westbound to the Middle East and Europe, or northwards to the Dutch East Indies.Hore, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy in World War II, p. 76 In April, Sydney escorted the troopship Queen Mary from Fremantle to Jervis Bay, before embarking Admiral Ragnar Colvin and a party of advisors from all three branches of the Australian military and transporting them to Singapore by 19 April for a secret conference between the British Commonwealth, the Netherlands East Indies, and the United States of America. The cruiser returned to Fremantle before month's end, after which Collins handed command over to Captain Joseph Burnett on 15 May. Shortly after, the cruiser escorted the transport SS Zealandia during a troop transport run to Singapore. Sydney escorted the troopship to Sunda Strait, where responsibility was handed over to the British light cruiser . In early June, Sydney met Zealandia and Danae on the troopship's return voyage, and took over escort duties from Sunda Strait back to Fremantle. After replenishing in Fremantle, Zealandia joined a multiple ship convoy to the east coast of Australia, which was also escorted by Sydney. The convoy departed on 24 June and made for Sydney, after which the cruiser joined the escort of a Pacific convoy before returning for maintenance. This concluded on 8 August, when Sydney escorted the troopship Awatea to New Zealand, then Fiji. The troopships Queen Mary (right) and Queen Elizabeth (left) sailing in Bass Strait, as seen from the stern of Sydney On her return to Sydney at the end of August, the cruiser joined the troopships Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth during the first leg of their voyage (Anzac convoy US 12A), escorting them until rendezvousing with Canberra in the Great Australian Bight. Sydney then sailed to Melbourne, and remained until 19 September, during which her camouflage was repainted in a new pattern. The cruiser then escorted the four-ship Anzac convoy US 12B to Fremantle: heavy seas while crossing the Great Australian Bight caused \\"A\\" turret to become jammed on a port facing.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 1, pp. 61‚Äì62 This was repaired in Fremantle, and the convoy proceeded to Sunda Strait, where Sydney handed the merchant ships over to the British cruisers and Danae on 3 October and set course for Fremantle. On the night of 5‚Äì6 October, a mysterious ship that responded to challenge signals near Rottnest Island then disappeared led the Naval Officer in Charge Fremantle to believe that the approaches to the harbour had been mined. Sydney was diverted to intercept Queen Mary before the troopship reached Fremantle, and ordered to remain with her until a channel was swept and found free of mines. After reaching port on 7 October, Sydney officially assumed patrol and escort duties in Western Australian waters. The next few weeks were uneventful for Sydney, and between 18 and 29 October, the cruiser visited Geraldton and Bunbury. On 2 November, the Australian cruiser sailed to meet Zealandia off Albany. The troopship was on a second troop transport run to Singapore; delivering the 8th Division. The two ships returned to Fremantle, and on 11 November, they departed for Sunda Strait. Zealandia was handed over on 17 November to for the next leg, and the Australian cruiser turned for home: she was scheduled to arrive in Fremantle late on 20 November. Final battle and loss :Note: all times in this section are UTC+7 On the afternoon of 19 November 1941, Sydney was off the coast of Western Australia, near Carnarvon, and heading south towards Fremantle. Around 15:55, the cruiser spotted a merchant ship on a northbound course, which quickly turned away from the coast at . Sydney increased speed to and made to intercept.Hore, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy in World War II, p. 78 As she closed the gap, Sydney began to signal the unidentified merchantman, first by signal light, then after no reply was forthcoming and the distance between the two ships had decreased, by a combination of light and signal flag. The merchant ship hoisted her callsign, but as she was ahead and just port of Sydney, the flags were obscured by the funnel. A request from the cruiser that the merchant ship make her signal letters clear, which the signals officer did by lengthening the halyard and swinging the flags clear. The callsign was that of the Dutch ship Straat Malakka, but she was not on Sydneys list of ships meant to be in the area. Further flag signals were exchanged between the ships, with Sydney asking the Dutch ship's destination and cargo. At 17:00, a distress signal was transmitted by Straat Malakka, indicating that she was being pursued by a merchant raider. Following this, Sydney pulled alongside the merchant ship from astern; pacing the merchantman on a parallel course, approximately away. Sydneys main guns and port torpedo launcher were trained on the ship, while she sent the interior portion of Straat Malakkas secret callsign. Fifteen minutes later, at around 17:30, the merchantman had not replied, and Sydney sent a signal ordering her to show the secret callsign. The auxiliary cruiser Kormoran in 1940 Straat Malakka had not replied because she was the in disguise, and when asked to reveal a callsign the Germans did not know, Kormoran responded by decamouflaging and opening fire. Prompted by the raider's unveiling, Sydney also fired (accounts are divided as to which ship fired first), but while her first salvo either missed or passed through Kormorans upper superstructure with minimal damage, four of the raider's six guns (the other two guns were on the port side and could not fire to starboard) were able to destroy the cruiser's bridge and gun director tower, damage the forward turrets, and set the aircraft on fire. Sydney did not fire again until after the raider's sixth salvo: \\"Y\\" turret fired without effect, but \\"X\\" turret was able to put multiple shells into Kormoran, damaging machinery spaces and one of the raider's guns, while igniting an oil tank. During this, Kormoran maintained heavy fire, and around the time of the eighth or ninth German salvo, a torpedo launched at the start of the engagement hit Sydney just forward of \\"A\\" turret and near the ASDIC compartment (the weakest point on the ship's hull), ripping a hole in the side and causing the bow of the cruiser to angle down. Down by the bows, the cruiser swung hard to port, and passed behind Kormoran; during the turn, shells from the raider knocked \\"B\\" turret off Sydney. By 17:35, Sydney was heading south and losing speed, wreathed in smoke from multiple fires. Her main armament was disabled (the two aft turrets had jammed on a port facing and could not be swung around), and her secondary guns were out of effective range. The cruiser continued to be hit by shells from Kormorans aft guns as the distance between the ships increased. The Germans reported that around 17:45, all four torpedoes from Sydneys starboard launcher were fired, but as Kormoran was manoeuvring to bring her port broadside to bear, they all missed. In fact, only two torpedoes from Sydneys port launcher were ever fired, which must have happened some time earlier.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 1, pp. 255‚Äì60 The raider's engines broke down after this turn, but she continued to fire on Sydney at a high rate despite being immobilised, although many of the shells would have missed as the distance between the two ships increased. Kormoran ceased fire at 17:50, with the range at , and launched another torpedo at 18:00, but missed Sydney. The Australian cruiser continued on a south-south-east heading at low speed; observers aboard Kormoran doubted that Sydney was under control. Although disappearing over the horizon shortly later, the glow from the damaged, burning warship was consistently seen by the Germans until about 22:00, and sporadically until midnight. At some point during the night, Sydney lost buoyancy and sank: the bow was torn off as she submerged and descended almost vertically, while the rest of the hull glided forward as she sank, hitting the bottom upright and stern first.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 2, pp. 357‚Äì66 Sydneys shells had crippled Kormoran; the German sailors abandoned ship after it was determined that below-deck fires could not be controlled before they reached the gun magazines or the mines in the cargo hold. The raider was scuttled at midnight, and sank slowly until the mine deck exploded half an hour later. =Aftermath= Sydneys failure to reach Fremantle on 20 November was not initially cause for concern, as several factors might have delayed the cruiser, none of which were sufficient reason to break the order to maintain wireless silence. However, with no sign of the cruiser by 23 November, shore-based wireless stations began transmitting orders for Sydney to break silence and report in. A raft of German survivors was recovered by a British tanker on 24 November, at which point a large-scale air and sea search began. During this search, which lasted until the evening of 29 November 318 survivors from Kormorans 399 personnel were found, but apart from a carley float and a lifebelt, nothing from Sydney or the 645 aboard was recovered. Memo from Frederick Shedden, Secretary to the War Cabinet, to Prime Minister John Curtin; the first formal advice to the Prime Minister that Sydney was believed lost. Australian Prime Minister John Curtin officially announced the loss of the cruiser during the afternoon of 30 November. Sydneys destruction was a major blow to Australian morale and military capability: her ship's company made up 35 percent of the RAN's wartime casualties.Jeans, Seafaring Lore and Legend, pp. 189‚Äì91 The cruiser's loss did not have the same impact internationally; two British capital ships were destroyed during the same fortnight, and Japan entered World War II with attacks on Pearl Harbor and Singapore three weeks later. The German survivors were taken to Fremantle and interrogated. Attempts to learn what had happened were hampered by the German officers instructing their sailors to obfuscate the enemy with false answers, people describing events they did not witness but heard of later, and difficulty in keeping groups separated in order to check their stories against each other. Despite this, Australian authorities were able to piece together the broad details of the battle, which was verified by a group of German sailors who had been taken to Sydney instead: their interviews showed the same commonalities and inconsistencies as those from Fremantle, and the interrogators concluded that the true story was being recounted.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 1, p. 393 Interrogations were concluded in December, and by the end of January, Kormorans personnel had been moved to prisoner-of-war camps in Victoria, where they remained until their repatriation to Germany in early 1947. On 6 February 1942, a Carley float containing a dead body was spotted just off Christmas Island and towed ashore. Examination of the raft and its occupant led the island's inhabitants to believe that they were from Sydney. Although a 1949 investigation conducted by the Royal Navy stated the raft was not from HMAS Sydney, and while some historians agreed, others concluded that the raft and the body originated from Sydney. The body was exhumed in October 2006 and reburied at Geraldton Cemetery in November 2008, after DNA was extracted. As of 2009, attempts to compare the DNA with relatives of Sydney personnel had yet to identify the unknown sailor.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 2, p. 356 =Controversy= The battle between Sydney and Kormoran is seen as controversial: the disbelief that a modified merchant ship could so successfully defeat a cruiser combined with the lack of Australian survivors led some to believe that the German account was false. Rumours that the battle was not what it seemed had been around since Sydney failed to reach Fremantle on schedule in 1941, but several historians (including Tom Frame and Wesley Olson) credit Michael Montgomery and his 1980 book Who Sank The Sydney? with igniting the controversy. The main claims made by supporters of an alternative view of the engagement include: that the Germans fired on Sydney before raising their battle ensign, or after using a flag of surrender or signals of distress to lure the cruiser in, that a Japanese submarine was partially or completely responsible for sinking Sydney, that the involvement of the Japanese was covered up to lure the United States into the war, and that Australian survivors were killed in the water to eliminate witnesses.Montgomery, Who Sank The Sydney?, pp. 109, 135‚Äì37, 205 Other claims, less widely heard, include a belief that Sydney was not at action stations and thus not prepared for Kormorans attack, distress calls from the cruiser were heard by Australian shore facilities but ignored, and that survivors were captured then executed by the Japanese.Montgomery, Who Sank The Sydney?, pp. 121, 132 These claims have been proven false by historians and researchers; the 1998 inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee for Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade concluded that the German accounts were a \\"feasible\\" interpretation of the battle, but there was no reliable evidence to support any of the alternative claims, while the 2009 report for the Cole Inquiry (the third volume of which was completely dedicated to the \\"frauds, conspiracies and speculations\\" surrounding the battle) found nothing to substantiate any of the theories raised.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 1, pp. xxvii‚Äìxxix In addition, most researchers have speculated as to why Sydney was so close to an unknown vessel, with various levels of blame assigned to Captain Burnett for the demise of his ship. Theories to explain Burnett's actions include that he was inexperienced or incompetent, deceived by Kormorans disguise, the idea that he was under conflicting orders instructing that raiders be attacked at range but enemy supply ships be captured, or that he was trying to clearly identify the merchantman.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney, vol. 2, p. 387 Search and rediscovery Despite the approximate position of Kormoran being known (most German accounts giving the battle coordinates as ), the required search area for both ships was immense. Calculating a search area was complicated by the fact that several people distrusted the German location, and believed the ships would be found further south and closer to shore. Several attempts to bring supporters of the 'northern' and 'southern' positions to a consensus and narrow down the potential search area were unsuccessful. Multiple searches were carried out by the RAN between 1974 and 1997 (using the survey ship and later the trials ship ), but efforts were restricted to the continental shelf, and were usually in response to civilian claims that they had found Sydney at a certain location. Other searches were conducted by RAAF aircraft carrying magnetometers; again, these were only in response to possible location claims. These searches failed to find either ship. American shipwreck hunter David Mearns first learned of the battle in 1996, and began to study it as a prelude to a search for the ships in 2001. Mearns, with the aid of other researchers, focused on primary sources (rediscovering several archive files and diaries in the process), and came to the conclusion that the German accounts were true, and that the ship would be found at the northern position. After attracting the interest of the RAN, Mearns entered into a partnership with HMAS Sydney Search, a not-for-profit company set up to administer and help fund an expedition to locate Sydney and Kormoran. State and Federal government grants totalling just under A$5 million, coupled with private and corporate donations, were used to fund a 45-day search from the end of February to early April 2008. Mearns' plan was to inspect a search box around the German location with a deep-water, towed side-scan sonar to locate Kormoran, after which the search team would be able to narrow down the search area for Sydney. After locating one or both vessels, the search ship (survey vessel SV Geosounder, chartered from the subsea exploration company DOF Subsea Australia) would return to port and replace the sonar with a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to photograph and video the wrecks. After problems with equipment and weather, Geosounder commenced the search, and located Kormoran on 12 March 2008 at . Using the newly discovered wreck and the accounts of the Germans describing Sydneys heading, speed, and last sighting after the battle, a search box for the cruiser was calculated: the dramatically smaller area was due to the quality of information regarding Sydneys position and heading in relation to Kormoran, while the raider's location consisted of only broad coordinates. Sydneys damaged \\"A\\" turret Sydney was located on 17 March 2008 just after 11:00, only hours after Kormorans discovery was made public. News that the cruiser had been found was announced by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd on 18 March. Sydneys wreck was located at at below sea level, south-east of the raider. The bow of the cruiser had broken off as the ship sank, and was located at the opposite end of a debris field stretching less than north-west from the hull, which was sitting upright on the ocean floor.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 2, p. 217 On discovery, both wrecks were placed under the protection of the Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976, which penalises anyone disturbing a protected shipwreck with a fine of up to A$10,000 or a maximum five years imprisonment. Both wrecks were placed on the Australian National Heritage List on 14 March 2011.Australian Associated Press & Australian Geographic Staff, HMAS Sydney makes heritage list After the side-scan sonar aboard Geosounder was switched out for the ROV (again delayed by technical issues and more bad weather), the survey ship returned to Sydneys wreck site on 3 April, and performed a detailed study of the ship and her debris field. Inspections were also carried out on Kormoran and the believed battle site (the latter found to be outcrops of pillow lava), before Mearns declared the search over on 7 April. In April 2015, an expedition to the wrecks by Curtin University and the Western Australian Museum commenced, with the objective of using 3D imaging to map the wrecksites for further study, and to determine if any deterioration since the 2008 discovery requires the development of a conservation management plan.Mundy, HMAS Sydney wreck to be recorded in safeguard mission Awards, memorials, and legacy Sydney was granted the battle honour \\"Kormoran 1941\\" in recognition of the damage done to Kormoran. This was one of only three honours awarded during the 20th century for the sinking of a single ship, and the second to a ship named Sydney (the other had been awarded to the previous Sydney for her defeat of the German light cruiser SMS Emden at the Battle of Cocos). The memorial at Geraldton The main memorial for the loss of Sydney is located at Geraldton, Western Australia, on top of Mount Scott. Planning for the memorial commenced in late 1997, after a speech by Sydney researcher Glenys McDonald at the local Rotary club. The first, temporary memorial (consisting of a large boulder, a flagpole, and a bronze plaque), was installed prior to 19 November 1998, and was used in a remembrance ceremony that year. During the playing of the Last Post, a large flock of seagulls flew over the participants and headed out to sea in formation: this became a major feature of the permanent memorial. The permanent memorial included four major elements: a stele of the same size and shape of the ship's prow, a granite wall listing the ship's company, a bronze statue of a woman looking out to sea and waiting in vain for the cruiser to come home, and a dome (dubbed the \\"dome of souls\\") onto which 645 stainless steel seagulls were welded. The memorial (minus the stele, which had not been completed in time) was dedicated on 18 November 2001, and was used the next evening for a commemoration ceremony marking the 60th anniversary of the ship's loss. In May 2009, the memorial was recognised by the Australian government as being of national significance.Minister for Veterans' Affairs, HMAS Sydney II Declared a National Memorial By 2011, the stele had been completed, and a fifth element‚Äîa pool of remembrance containing a map of the region and the marked position of Sydneys wreck‚Äîhad been added.Robertson, HMAS Sydney II Memorial completed in time for the commemorative 70th anniversary HMA Ships Sydney (right) and the carrier (left) Other memorials commemorating the loss of Sydney include an oak tree planted at the Melbourne Shrine of Remembrance, and an avenue in Carnarvon lined with 645 trees. The service of Sydney, along with the other ships of the same name, is commemorated by a stained-glass window at the Garden Island Naval Chapel, and by the mast of the first at Bradleys Head, New South Wales. The names of those killed aboard Sydney are inscribed at the Australian War Memorial. The \\"HMAS Sydney Replacement Fund\\" was established to help finance the acquisition of a replacement ship.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 60 The AU¬£426,000 raised was contributed to the purchase of Australia's first aircraft carrier in the late 1940s; the Majestic-class carrier was named upon her commissioning into the RAN in December 1948. This Sydney operated during the Korean War, then was modified into a troop transport and served in the Vietnam War, before her sale for scrap in 1973. The Supermarine Seagull V aircraft that operated from Sydney between 1937 and 1938 still survives as part of the collection of the Royal Air Force Museum at Colindale in north London.Simpson, Individual History: Supermarine Seagull V A2-4/VH-ALB The \\"HMAS Sydney II Cup\\" was introduced in 2010 as a commemorative trophy competed for by two Australian Football League clubs, the Sydney Swans (representing the ship's namesake) and the West Coast Eagles (representing the site of the ship's loss), in an annual match. The trophy is based on the cruiser's battle honour board, while the design of a Best On Ground trophy for the match's best player is based on a shell casing from the frigate Sydney.

She was built for the Royal Navy and was launched as HMS Terrible (93) in 1944, but was not completed before the end of World War II. The carrier was sold to Australia in 1947, completed, and commissioned into the RAN as Sydney in 1948. Sydney was the first of three conventional aircraft carriers to serve in the RAN, and operated as the navy's flagship during the early part of her career. From late 1951 to early 1952, she operated off the coast of Korea during the Korean War, making her the first carrier owned by a Commonwealth Dominion, and the only carrier in the RAN, to see wartime service. Retasked as a training vessel following the 1955 arrival of her modernised sister ship, , Sydney remained in service until 1958, when she was placed in reserve as surplus to requirements. The need for a sealift capability saw the ship modified for service as a fast troop transport, and recommissioned in 1962. Sydney was initially used for training and a single supply run in support of Malaysia's defence policy against Indonesia, but in 1965, she sailed on the first voyage to V≈©ng T√†u, transporting soldiers and equipment to serve in the Vietnam War. 25 voyages to Vietnam were made between 1965 and 1972, earning the ship the nickname \\"Vung Tau Ferry\\". Sydney was decommissioned in 1973, and was not replaced. Despite several plans to preserve all or part of the ship as a maritime museum, tourist attraction, or car park, the carrier was sold to a South Korean steel mill for scrapping in 1975. Design Sydney was one of six Majestic-class light fleet carriers; a modified version of the Colossus-class carrier, incorporating improvements in flight deck design and habitability. These two classes of carriers were intended to be 'disposable warships': they were to be operated during World War II and scrapped at the end of hostilities or within three years of entering service.Hobbs, in The Navy and the Nation, p. 217 Sydney was the second ship of the class to enter service, following Canadian aircraft carrier . The carrier had a standard displacement of 15,740 tons, and a deep displacement of 19,550 tons.Cassells, The Capital Ships, pp. 164‚Äì5 Her length was between perpendiculars and at her longest point, with a beam of and a draught of . Sydney was fitted with four Admiralty 3-drum boilers, which provided steam to Parsons single reduction geared turbines; these supplied to the two propeller shafts, and allowed the ship to reach . The average size of the ship's company in peacetime was 1,100, but could be increased to 1,300 for wartime deployments. Refitting the ship to serve as a transport reduced the standard displacement to 14,380 tons and the ship's company to a core of 544, which was supplemented by trainees and personnel from the Royal Australian Navy Reserve when required.Blackman (ed.), Jane's Fighting Ships (1968‚Äì69), p. 12 The Admiralty predicted that all Majestic-class carriers would require upgrades to their aircraft lifts and arrester gear in the early 1950s, to operate the faster and heavier carrier aircraft under development. Originally, the RAN wanted to upgrade Sydney to the same or similar standard as sister ship , after the second carrier was delivered. The installation of an angled flight deck and mirror landing aid, would have allowed Sydney to operate modern jet aircraft.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 105 However, financial and manpower restrictions led to the cancellation of this program.Wright, Australian Carrier Decisions, p. 160 =Armament, sensors, and aircraft= Sydney was initially armed with thirty Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns: eighteen single mountings and six twin mountings. During her refit as a troop transport, the carrier's armament was reduced to four single Bofors. The radar suite included two Type 277Q height-finding sets, one Type 293M surface search set, one Type 960/281BQ long-range air warning set, and one Type 961 air search set. A Sea Fury preparing to take off from Sydney during her flight trials in January 1949 As an aircraft carrier, Sydney operated with the RAN Fleet Air Arm's 20th and 21st Carrier Air Groups (CAGs), which were assigned alternately to the carrier. The former was made up of 805 and 816 Squadrons, while the latter was made up of 808 and 817 Squadrons. Twenty-four aircraft, split evenly between Hawker Sea Fury fighters and Fairey Firefly attack aircraft, were normally carried. Two Supermarine Sea Otter amphibious aircraft were carried for rescue duties (but were never required for this purpose); they were not attached to any squadron, but operated as the 'Ship's Flight'.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 62 The amphibians were removed from the ship at the start of her Korean War deployment, and were replaced by a helicopter.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 106 During the carrier's Korean War deployment, 805 Squadron was added to the 21st CAG to form a 38-strong wartime air group. While undergoing conversion into a troop transport, the ability to operate aircraft was removed from Sydney. However, on seven of the troopship's twenty-five voyages to Vietnam, she carried a flight of four Westland Wessex helicopters, sourced from either 725 or 817 Squadron, for anti-submarine surveillance.Cooper, in The Royal Australian Navy, p. 204Nott & Payne, The Vung Tau Ferry, p. 33 Construction and acquisition The ship was laid down by HM Dockyard Devonport in England as HMS Terrible on 19 April 1943, with the Viscountess Astor presiding over the ceremony.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 165 She was the only aircraft carrier of the Colossus or Majestic classes to be constructed in a 'royal dockyard': a dockyard owned and operated by the Royal Navy.Hobbs, in The Navy and the Nation, p. 210 She was launched on 30 September 1944 by the wife of British politician Duncan Sandys. Work on the ship continued until the end of World War II, when the Admiralty ordered the suspension of all warship construction.Hobbs, HMAS Melbourne II ‚Äì 25 Years On, p. 5 Launch of HMS Terrible, which later became HMAS Sydney A post-war review by the Australian government's Defence Committee recommended that the RAN be restructured around a task force incorporating multiple aircraft carriers.Donohue, From Empire Defence to the Long Haul, p. 33 Initial plans were for three carriers, with two active and a third in reserve at any given time, although funding cuts led to the purchase of only two carriers in June 1947; Terrible and sister ship Majestic, for the combined cost of AU¬£2.75 million, plus stores, fuel, and ammunition.Donohue, From Empire Defence to the Long Haul, pgs. 38, 45‚Äì47 As Terrible was fitted out as a flagship and was the closer of the two ships to completion, construction was finished without major modification.Wright, Australian Carrier Decisions, p. 151 Although Terrible was due for completion on 24 June 1948, a skilled labour shortage affected the installation of the ship's boilers, causing the Admiralty to revise the delivery date to October 1948.Wright, Australian Carrier Decisions, p 155 A commissioning crew for the aircraft carrier was raised in Australia from the ship's company of the decommissioned cruiser , which departed from Sydney aboard in June 1948.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 57 Ex-Royal Navy sailors were used to fill out the carrier's complement. Terrible was handed over to the RAN on 16 December 1948, and was commissioned at noon as HMAS Sydney.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 60 One of the reasons behind the choice in name was so AU¬£426,000 raised by the HMAS Sydney Replacement Fund after the loss of the light cruiser HMAS Sydney in 1941 could be accessed. Sydney was the last vessel to be commissioned into the RAN as 'His' Majesty's Australian Ship: as after the death of King George VI on 6 February 1952 and the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, all RAN ships became 'Her' Majesty's.Cooper, in The Royal Australian Navy, opp. p. 160 Operational history =1949‚Äì1951= Fireflies and Sea Furies overfly Sydney Although commissioned in mid-December 1948, Sydney did not enter service until 5 February 1949, as work was still being completed. On 25 December 1948, while still fitting out in Devonport, a helicopter from carrying Santa Claus became the first aircraft to land on Sydneys flight deck.Lind, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 220 The ship's sea trials and post-commissioning workup were not without event: in early December 1948, a 771 Naval Air Squadron de Havilland Mosquito crashed while helping Sydney calibrate her radar suite, killing both British aircrew, and a RAN pilot undergoing landing qualifications aboard on 17 March 1949 crashed while attempting to land: none were killed, but the pilot's Fairey Firefly and four others in the deck park were destroyed.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 59 Sydney passing through the Sydney Heads for the first time on 28 May 1949 The carrier sailed from Devonport on 12 April 1949, carrying the 20th CAG.McCaffrie, in Sea power ashore and in the air, p. 173 Sydney arrived at Jervis Bay on 25 May, where the aircraft of the 20th CAG and training equipment were offloaded for transport to the new naval air station, , before the carrier proceeded to her namesake city.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 69 Sydney arrived in Sydney on 2 June, and took over as Flagship of the Australian Fleet from on 25 August.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 73Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p, 304 20th CAG was reembarked during August, and Sydney exercised in Australian and New Guinea waters until late November. From January to April 1950, the carrier continued training exercises and visited ports in south-east Australia and New Zealand, and on 7 June, she departed for England to collect the 21st CAG.ANAM, Flying Stations, pp. 74‚Äì5 The 21st CAG embarked in October, and the carrier returned to Australia in December. Before Sydney departed in late October, the British Admiralty suggested that she be deployed to the Korean War as relief for and her worn-out catapult, but this was withdrawn because of the plan's drawbacks.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 76 On 29 January 1951, Sydney was part of an eighteen-ship fleet present in Sydney Harbour to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Australia's Federation.Lind, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 224 Following this, the carrier joined a multinational training exercise in south- east Australian waters, then visited Hobart for the Royal Hobart Regatta.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 80 During the exercise, a Sea Fury accidentally fired four practice rockets into the superstructure of the New Zealand flagship, : although an inquiry concluded that the pilot had unintentionally pressed the fire button, it was later found that certain signal frequencies transmitted by Sydneys radio aerials could trigger a Fury's firing circuits. Sydney was presented with the Gloucester Cup in April 1951, recognising her as the most efficient ship in the RAN for 1950. The two CAGs were switched over in April, and on 3 May, a Sea Fury crashed during a rocket-assisted take off; the pilot became the carrier's first fatality.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 81 =Korean War (1951‚Äì1952)= Firefly aircraft on board HMAS Sydney during her Korean War deployment In March 1951, the First Sea Lord requested that Sydney be deployed to Korea while was refitted in Australia, to maintain a Commonwealth carrier presence.McCaffrie, in Sea power ashore and in the air, p. 174Hobbs, British Commonwealth Carrier Operations of the Korean War, p. 66 This was agreed to, and a 38-strong wartime CAG was formed on 14 May by incorporating the Sea Furies of 805 Squadron into the 21st CAG. Because RAN Fireflies were optimised for anti-submarine warfare, and consequently not fitted with cannon, cannon- equipped RN aircraft were loaned for the duration of Sydney's deployment.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 79 After completing pre-departure exercises, during which several aircraft were destroyed in non-fatal, weather-induced deck crashes, Sydney and the destroyer sailed for Korea on 31 August. While en route, the carrier's aircraft were used for a fly-past demonstration over Rabaul on 6 September, following civil unrest.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 84 On her arrival, Sydney became the first aircraft carrier owned by a Commonwealth dominion to see wartime service. A map of the Korean peninsula. Sydney operated primarily off the west coast, although she was deployed to the east coast on occasion. Sydney was attached to the United States Navy (USN) Seventh Fleet and assigned to Task Element 95.11, which operated primarily off the western coast of Korea.McCaffrie, in Sea power ashore and in the air, p. 175Dennis et al, The Oxford Companion to Australian military history, p. 209 The carrier was sent on nine or ten-day patrols in the operational area, with nine-day replenishment periods in Sasebo, Nagasaki or Kure, Hiroshima between each; to maintain coverage, Sydney alternated with a USN carrier (initially , then from December with ).McCaffrie, in Sea power ashore and in the air, p. 178 RAN aircraft were mainly used for air strikes against North Korean units and supply lines; secondary duties including reconnaissance, bombardment spotting, combat air patrols, and anti-submarine patrols. During her deployment, the carrier operated an unarmed USN Sikorsky Dragonfly (designation UP28, which acquired the nickname \\"Uncle Peter\\") in the search-and-rescue and plane guard roles.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 168 This was the first helicopter to operate from an Australian warship, and the first USN equipment used by the RAN.Frame, Pacific Partners, p. 91 The success of helicopter operations convinced the RAN to acquire three Bristol Sycamores; the first helicopter squadron in Australian military service.Cooper, in The Royal Australian Navy, p. 178 Sydneys first patrol commenced on 4 October, with two days spent providing air support of efforts to push the front line away from the Han River.Lind, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 168McCaffrie, in Sea power ashore and in the air, p. 179 Sydney was then briefly repositioned off the east coast, where her aircraft flew strike missions near Wonsan. After returning to the east coast, Sydney set a record on 11 October for light carrier operations: her aircraft flew 89 sorties during the day, with 31 aircraft aloft at one point. Following her first patrol, the carrier sailed to Sasebo to resupply, but on 14 October, all ships were ordered to sea to avoid Typhoon Ruth.McCaffrie, in Sea power ashore and in the air, p. 182 Although the order to clear the anchorage was given that morning, the number of ships present meant Sydney did not leave until late in the day, and sailed during the worst part of the storm.HMAS Sydney (III), Sea Power Centre A Firefly, a motor dinghy, and a forklift were lost overboard, six other aircraft parked on the deck were destroyed, and the carrier experienced extreme winds‚Äîthe wind recorder broke after registering . UP-28 (\\"Uncle Peter\\"), the Sikorsky Dragonfly assigned to Sydney, hovering above the carrier's flight deck Sydneys second patrol began on 18 October, with her aircraft involved in strikes against North Korean units, coastal shipping, railway bridges, and other supply routes. They also performed their first close air support mission on 21 October, providing cover for the 1st Commonwealth Division.McCaffrie, in Sea power ashore and in the air, p. 180 Two Sea Furies were shot down on 25 October; both pilots escaped unharmed.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 169 The next day, during a moderately successful strike involving five RAN aircraft against a railway tunnel, a Firefly was shot down inland, deep inside North Korean territory.Hobbs, British Commonwealth Carrier Operations of the Korean War, p. 67 There were doubts that a rescue helicopter could reach the crash site and return safely, as it was at the extreme limit of helicopter range and some of the return flight would occur after dark.Lind, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 227 Despite this, Uncle Peter's USN aircrew volunteered to try, and after the observer was quickly taught how to use an Owen submachine gun, the helicopter launched at 16:22. The four RAN aircraft provided cover for the two downed personnel until they were ordered to return to the carrier; two of the Fireflies met Uncle Peter at 17:15, and turned around to escort the helicopter. At 17:33 Uncle Peter arrived at the crash site and collected the RAN aircrew, with covering fire provided by the escorting Fireflies and the helicopter's observer. All three aircraft were at extreme fuel limits on their return: the two Fireflies barely made it back to Sydney, while Uncle Peter arrived at Kimpo air base at 18:30 and had to land with the aid of truck headlights. The rescue was the longest helicopter rescue transit over North Korean territory during the war, and Sikorsky pilot received both the British Distinguished Service Medal and the United States Navy Cross: the only instance of these two medals being awarded to the same person for the same action.McCaffrie, in Sea power ashore and in the air, p. 183 Sydney was relieved by USS Rendova on 27 October and returned to Kure. Sydney at anchor in Korean waters during 1951 Sydney began her third patrol on 5 November, operating on the west coast of Korea and escorted by the Canadian destroyers , and , and American destroyers and . On the same day, the first RAN casualty of the war occurred, when a Sea Fury pilot failed to pull up from a strafing run and crashed.Lind, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 226 Despite foul weather, the carrier's aircraft continued to attack lines of supply and communication, and provide support to United Nations ships: the 1000th combat sortie was flown on 12 November, a day before the patrol's end. On 18 November, after replenishing in Sasebo, Sydney, Tobruk, and the British light cruiser sailed to H≈≠ngnam, where they joined Task Force 95.8 to aid a USN bombardment of H≈≠ngnam during 20‚Äì22 November. On that day, Sydney was being refuelled by when there was an accident that resulted in a large spill of fuel and damage to Wave Chiefs refuelling rig. Aircraft from Sydney performed strikes against coastal artillery batteries, barracks, industrial areas and railway lines, and provided a combat air patrol for the ships.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 170 At the conclusion of the operation, Sydney returned to the west coast, but was unable to resume operations because of snow and high winds until 27 November, a day before being relieved. In December, UN Command temporarily switched some of the responsibilities of Task Element 95.11 and the US Fifth Air Force. Consequently, Sydney was required to provide air support for convoys between Japan and Korea amongst the other duties of her fifth patrol, which commenced on 7 December.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 171 On 8 December, a second RAN pilot was killed; although he successfully bailed out of his flak-damaged Sea Fury, he was struck by the tail of the aircraft and died from wounds. Four other aircraft were damaged that day. Clear weather, which lasted until 14 December, allowed the carrier to maintain a high rate of attack against North Korean troop concentrations, railways, and coastal vessels, while providing air cover for the Task Element. Ending on 18 December, the fifth patrol was the most costly to Sydneys CAG, with one pilot killed, five aircraft destroyed, and another 25 aircraft heavily damaged. The carrier was in Kure for Christmas, and relieved USS Badoeng Strait on 27 December, the start of her sixth patrol. The remaining days of 1951 were spent providing air cover in the Inchon area for both UN ground forces and supply convoys returning to Japan. On New Year's Day 1952, Sydneys aircraft helped repel the North Korean invasion of the island of Yongho Do. The third RAN pilot to be lost in Korea died on 2 January while performing a combat air patrol around the carrier; personnel on the flight deck saw the aircraft fly into a cloud, but not emerge. No wreckage was found, and it was assumed that the plane dived into the Yellow Sea. For most of the patrol, RAN aircraft attacked artillery emplacements and concentrations of junks in the Cho Do-Sok To area, while also proving air support for South Korean Army and irregular forces. Deck crew working on a Sea Fury during a snow storm Sydneys seventh and final patrol commenced on 16 January, with , , and accompanying. This patrol was marked by minimal flying activity due to extremely poor weather and a lack of co- ordination between UN forces and the convoys RAN aircraft were meant to escort.McCaffrie, in Sea power ashore and in the air, p. 181 The primary targets for strike missions were changed from North Korean supply line infrastructure to water towers, as they took longer to repair. On the final day of the patrol, aircraft from Sydney did not fly at all, as overnight weather conditions had rendered all of the deck-parked aircraft unusable, including five which were completely encased in frozen sea water. On 25 January, Sydney was relieved by HMS Glory, and sailed for home. Sydney completed seven patrols during her 122-day Korean deployment: flying operations were conducted for 42.8 days, poor weather stopped operations for 11.7 days, transits to and from the operational area or between assignments consumed 29.5 days, and 38 days were spent in harbour.McCaffrie, in Sea power ashore and in the air, pp. 183‚Äì4 During this time, RAN Sea Furies flew 1,623 sorties, while the Fireflies flew 743, with the aircraft using 802 bombs, 6,359 rockets, and 269,249 rounds of ammunition between them.Hobbs, British Commonwealth Carrier Operations of the Korean War, p. 71 Three RAN pilots were killed and a fourth seriously wounded, while thirteen aircraft were lost: nine shot down by North Korean flak artillery (which damaged aircraft on over ninety other occasions), and four to deck accidents or foul weather.Cooper, in The Royal Australian Navy, p. 177 Replacement aircraft were loaned from British Far East reserve supplies. RAN aircraft damaged or destroyed an estimated 66 bridges, 141 pieces of rolling stock, over 2,000 structures, 469 watercraft, and 15 artillery pieces, while causing over 3,100 North Korean casualties.McCaffrie, in Sea power ashore and in the air, p. 184 Australian damage assessment practice was considered to be conservative, and claims of great underestimation by the RAN were made by US personnel inspecting the aftermath of RAN attacks. Personnel from Sydney and her CAG received four Distinguished Service Crosses (one with Bar), one Distinguished Service Medal, ten Mentions in Despatches, and two United States Legions of Merit.McCaffrie, in Sea power ashore and in the air, p. 185 Most of the personnel aboard would have been eligible for the Australian Active Service Medal, the Korea Medal, the United Nations Service Medal for Korea, and the Returned From Active Service Badge, while Sydney herself was awarded the battle honour \\"Korea 1951‚Äì52\\".ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 100 The carrier's presence in Korea allowed the Australian government to avoid deploying additional Australian soldiers. =1952‚Äì1958= During her return from Korea, Sydney ferried Spitfires and Vampires between several British bases in Southeast Asia. After a brief refit, Sydney embarked the 20th CAG in June 1952, before proceeding on a round- Australia cruise.ANAM, Flying Stations, pp. 109‚Äì10 The carrier visited Manus Island, was present off the coast of the Montebello Islands for the first British atomic bomb test, Operation Hurricane, on 3 October, and arrived back in her namesake city in November.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 110 On 25 March 1953, Sydney departed for England with representatives from each of the three branches of the Australian and New Zealand militaries for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The carrier and her aircraft participated in the Coronation Fleet Review on 15 June, and visited Canada, the United States, the Caribbean, Panama, Hawaii, and New Zealand on the return voyage, before reaching Sydney on 15 August.ANAM, Flying Stations, pp. 110‚Äì11 The carrier's 10,000th deck landing occurred during this voyage: a Firefly completed the landing on 17 July, while Sydney was en route to Pearl Harbor.Hobbs, in The Navy and the Nation, p. 215 Sydney left Fremantle on 27 October 1953 for a second deployment to Korea, to support United Nations enforcement of the July 1953 armistice.Gillett, Warships of Australia, p. 130 This deployment, which concluded in January 1954, was mostly uneventful compared to the first, with flight operations limited to patrols along the demilitarised zone established by the armistice.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 116 During operations in Korea, one pilot died when his Sea Fury crashed into the ocean, while another pilot was killed and an aircraft handler seriously injured in separate deck accidents. Sydney returned to Fremantle on 2 June 1954. A planned upgrade of Sydney to a similar standard as modified sister ship Melbourne was cancelled in 1954, and she was prepared for service as a training ship.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 174 The carrier's embarked aircraft were flown off for the last time on 22 April 1955, and Sydney underwent a brief reorganisation during 26‚Äì29 April. Not long after, she departed for New Zealand waters on her first training cruise on 2 May. This was followed by a refit and then a quick trip from Sydney to Adelaide, thence Melbourne, and back to her home port in Sydney. A visit by Earl Mountbatten of Burma was a highlight at this time - especially when, after his presentation to the ship's company, they were all granted a 'make and mend.' Sydney (background) escorting Melbourne (foreground) during the final leg of the latter's delivery voyage On 1 May 1956, Sydney met Melbourne off Kangaroo Island during the latter's delivery voyage.Hall, HMAS Melbourne, p. 73 The two carriers sailed together for the remainder of Melbournes delivery voyage, visiting Melbourne and Jervis Bay before arriving in Sydney on 10 May.Hall, HMAS Melbourne, p. 74 Three days later, the flagship role was transferred from Sydney to Melbourne. After this, Sydney continued on a program of training cruises throughout Australian and New Zealand waters, and visited the Far East Strategic Reserve to participate in a South East Asia Treaty Organisation multi-fleet exercise during September and October 1956. Following an appraisal process by the RAN, during which Sydney's potential usefulness as a commando carrier, aircraft transport, or troopship was considered, the ship was paid off into Special Reserve on 30 May 1958 as surplus to requirements.Grey, Up Top, p. 100 Sydney could be reactivated for use as a transport, but required at least four months notice. =Fast Troop Transport (1958‚Äì1965)= From 1958 to 1960, opinion within the Australian military swung between reactivating Sydney as a fast troop transport ship and disposing of her. The Australian Army saw the need for such a vessel, particularly if war broke out in Southeast Asia: Australian forces would need to be rapidly deployed to the conflict, and sealift was the only way to effectively move the required number of personnel, equipment, and vehicles.Grey, Up Top, pp. 100‚Äì1 However, the RAN did not want the cost of converting and maintaining Sydney coming from their share of the defence budget, as they felt there was no further use for her. As both strategic airlift and sealift with other naval or civilian vessels were unfeasible, Sydney was reactivated and converted into a fast troop transport ship during 1961 and 1962.Grey, Up Top, p. 102 All of her aircraft operating equipment was removed, her hangar was converted into accommodation and storage, and her armament was reduced to four single-mounted 40 mm Bofors. Sydney was recommissioned as a Fast Troop Transport on 7 March 1962, given the pennant number A214, and assigned back to the training squadron.Gillett, Australian and New Zealand Warships since 1946, p. 78 From April 1962 onwards, Sydney was used to train the ship's company and Army personnel for the troop transport role, while supplementing the RAN's regular training needs. The troopship first saw full use in her new role in August 1963, when she was used to support an amphibious landing at Hervey Bay, Queensland during Exercise Carbine. From 27 September to 4 October, Sydney conveyed the Governor-General of Australia, Viscount De L'Isle, on a tour of Norfolk and Lord Howe Islands.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 305 The ship then departed on a training cruise to northern Queensland, during which five personnel drowned in the Whitsunday Islands.Frame, Where Fate Calls, p. 37 Over several days, groups of trainee officers and sailors had been ordered to take one of the ship's whaleboats on a twelve-hour voyage around Hayman and Hooke Islands; out of the sight of both the carrier and her escort, the destroyer . The third group boat left Sydney at around 0500 hours on 17 October with a midshipman and four trainee sailors aboard, and was believed to have capsized four to five hours later. Despite poor weather, Sydneys captain had declined an offer by Anzacs captain for the destroyer to move to the north of Hayman Island in case of incident, and a search party was not sent until after the boat failed to return at 1900 hours. A Board of Inquiry was held aboard Sydney, which resulted in the ship's captain, executive officer, and training officer facing courts-martial.Frame, Where Fate Calls, pp. 37‚Äì8 The latter two were acquitted, and although the captain was found guilty on one of the charges brought against him, it was dropped on a technicality relating to the wording of the charge.Frame, Where Fate Calls, p. 38 Sydneys first overseas deployment as a transport was to Southeast Asia in 1964. In late May, the ship was loaded with supplies and munitions for Malaysian forces in support of the country's defence policy against Indonesia.Pfennigwerth, Tiger Territory, pp. 159‚Äì60 In total, 1,245 personnel were also embarked: engineers from the 7th Field Squadron, the Royal Australian Artillery's 111th Light Anti-aircraft Battery, and four UH-1 Iroquois helicopters plus associated air- and ground crew from No. 5 Squadron RAAF.Pfennigwerth, Tiger Territory, p. 160 Sydney departed Garden Island just after midnight on 24 May. After entering New Guinea waters, the ship was put on high alert; radio and radar silence was enforced, while the anti-aircraft guns of the 111th Battery were secured to the ship's deck to supplement her armament. Sydney met the destroyer escorts and off the Philippines on 3 June, and a day later, the ships arrived at Kota Kinabalu, where the 7th Field Squadron was offloaded with the aid of the Australian Army landing ships Vernon Sturdee and Clive Steele. Sydney and her companions left for Singapore at midnight on 5 June, and arrived three days later to offload 250 tonnes of ammunition.Pfennigwerth, Tiger Territory, p. 161 Sydney and Parramatta then proceeded to Penang, where the 111th Battery, No. 5 Squadron, defence stores, and more munitions were offloaded during 16‚Äì17 June. The return voyage to Australia was interrupted on the morning of 23 June by the detection of a suspected Indonesian submarine: the two Australian ships performed evasion tactics for eighteen hours before resuming the voyage to Fremantle. No awards were issued to Sydney for operating in support of Malaysia during her service life, but a reorganisation of RAN battle honours published in March 2010 saw the battle honour \\"Malaysia 1964\\" retroactively awarded to the ship.Royal Australian Navy, Royal Australian Navy Ship/Unit Battle HonoursRoyal Australian Navy, Navy Marks 109th Birthday With Historic Changes To Battle Honours =Vietnam War (1965‚Äì1972)= The main feature of the second half of Sydneys career was the twenty-five voyages the ship made to South Vietnam in support of the 1st Australian Task Force between May 1965 and November 1972.Nott & Payne, The Vung Tau Ferry, pp. 169‚Äì78 Sydney, along with the civilian vessels and , was used to transport the majority of the Australian personnel and equipment contributed to the Vietnam War effort.Cooper, in The Royal Australian Navy, pp. 204‚Äì5 These voyages earned Sydney the nickname \\"Vung Tau Ferry\\". The visits to Vietnam were interspersed by other duties, and Sydney continued to function as a training ship, with up to 30 midshipmen and 200 trainee sailors aboard at any given time. Sydney normally transported 450 soldiers‚Äîthe main force of a Royal Australian Regiment (RAR) battalion‚Äîplus equipment and vehicles on each voyage.Fairfax, Navy in Vietnam, p. 166 The soldiers were accommodated in the sailors mess decks, with the sailors displaced to the hangar. Vehicles were secured to the flight deck, while other cargo was packed onto pallets and stored either in the hangar or on the flight deck. Although it was originally intended that Sydney would sail to and from Saigon, the ship's commanding officer at the time of the first voyage, John Crabb, informed the Naval Board that he would refuse orders to do so, as the Saigon River could easily be mined after Sydney had sailed up.Crabb, quoted in Nott & Payne, The Vung Tau Ferry, p. 55 Instead, the port of V≈©ng T√†u was selected as the destination, with soldiers and equipment transferred to shore by helicopters, landing craft, and barges.Merson, quoted in Nott & Payne, The Vung Tau Ferry, pp. 59‚Äì60 During the early voyages, unloading and reloading was a multiple-day process, with the transport moving to deeper waters each night, but improved cargo handling practices, upgrades to Sydney (including the installation of three new cargo cranes and six embarked landing craft during mid-1968 refit), and increased access to US cargo- and troop-carrying helicopters, reduced this to a single day by 1968.Grey, Up Top, pgs. 109, 111Cecil, Mud & Dust, p. 25 Because of the perceived threat from Chinese submarines while in transit and from Viet Cong swimmers with limpet mines while in harbour, Sydney was always escorted by at least one other RAN vessel.Merson, quoted in Nott & Payne, The Vung Tau Ferry, p. 59 While in harbour, boats from Sydney and her escort would patrol around the troopship, while divers regularly inspected the hull, propellers, and anchor chain for explosives.Merson, quoted in Nott & Payne, The Vung Tau Ferry, p. 60 On seven voyages, Sydney carried four Westland Wessex helicopters for anti-submarine surveillance, sourced from 725 or 817 Squadron. During May 1965, Sydney was undergoing a refit at Garden Island, when she was ordered to prepare the ship for her first voyage to Vietnam.Grey, Up Top, p. 104 The refit was hastily completed, and cargo loading started on 23 May. A blanket media ban concerning the ship was issued, and soldiers of 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1 RAR) and the Prince of Wales's Light Horse armoured regiment, along with a logistics unit and a group of journalists were covertly transported to the ship on 26 May to foil any protest attempts.Ham, Vietnam, p. 128Grey, Up Top, pp. 104‚Äì5 Sydney began her departure at 01:39; leaving Sydney Harbour with only her navigational lights lit. The troopship was in V≈©ng T√†u from 8 to 11 June, and returned to Fremantle on 26 June.Nott & Payne, The Vung Tau Ferry, p. 169 Sydney was escorted by the destroyer for the entire voyage, and was joined by HMA Ships , , and for parts of the voyage. After loading troops and equipment in both Sydney and Brisbane, the troopship, accompanied by Melbourne and Anzac, started her second voyage on 14 September.Nott & Payne, The Vung Tau Ferry, p. 170Grey, Up Top, p. 106 Sydney was handed off to Duchess and off Manus Island six days later. The three ships reached V≈©ng T√†u on 28 September, and departed two days later: after clearing the Market Time area, the two destroyers headed for Hong Kong, while Sydney proceeded to Subic Bay, then to her namesake city, where she arrived on 20 October. Despite these deployments, Sydney was later presented the Gloucester Cup for 1966; being the most efficient vessel in the RAN that year.Crabb, quoted in Nott & Payne, The Vung Tau Ferry, p. 56 Sydney sailed to Vietnam for the third time on 24 April 1966, with units from both 5 RAR and 6 RAR aboard.Grey, Up Top, p. 108 She met her escorts, Vampire, , and Melbourne en route: the two smaller ships accompanied Sydney into V≈©ng T√†u from 4 to 6 May, while the aircraft carrier Melbourne left the group as soon as they reached the Vietnam operational area. Sydney and her escorts arrived in Hong Kong on 9 May, with the troopship returning to Sydney on her own on 18 May. On 25 May, Sydney departed on her fourth voyage to Vietnam, with the remaining units of 5 RAR and 6 RAR aboard, plus equipment and personnel of No. 9 Squadron RAAF.Nott & Payne, The Vung Tau Ferry, p. 171 Carrying the remaining units of 5 RAR and 6 RAR, plus equipment and personnel of No. 9 Squadron RAAF and escorted by Yarra, Melbourne, Derwent, and Vendetta for varying sections of the voyage, Sydney arrived in V≈©ng T√†u on 6 June. The voyage officially ended with the arrival of Sydney and Vendetta in Hong Kong on 11 June. In November, Sydney provided assistance to the submarine , which ran aground on Frederick Reef. On 1 March 1967, the ensign flown by RAN ships was changed from the British White Ensign to the Australian White Ensign.Australian White Ensign, Sea Power Centre Sydney became one of only two RAN ships to undergo wartime service under both ensigns‚Äîthe other being ‚Äîand the only RAN ship to fly two ensigns during the same conflict.Fairfax, Navy in Vietnam, p. 169 With 7 RAR embarked, Sydney departed her namesake city on 8 April for her fifth voyage to Vietnam. With Vampire escorting and Westland Wessex helicopters aboard for the first time, the troopship spent 20 April disembarking 7 RAR in V≈©ng T√†u before arriving in Singapore two days later. On 28 April, the two ships left Singapore on the sixth voyage, to collect 5 RAR.Nott & Payne, The Vung Tau Ferry, p. 172 The battalion was embarked on 30 April, with Sydney arriving home on 12 May. Although the fifth and six voyages are officially recorded separately, they are sometimes counted as a single trip, because Sydney did not return to Australia in between. Sydneys seventh voyage began on 19 May from Brisbane, with 2 RAR and a company from 1st Battalion, Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment‚Äîthe first New Zealand infantry force sent to Vietnam.MacDougall, Australians at War, p. 337 Sydney and the destroyer escort Stuart reached V≈©ng T√†u on 30 May, where the troopship's passengers were offloaded by Chinook helicopters and replaced by 6 RAR. The ships left Vietnam on the same day, and arrived in Brisbane on 14 June. The eighth voyage required Sydney to transport 3 RAR from Adelaide. Departing on 20 December, Sydney was met by Yarra en route, with the two ships arriving in Vietnam on 27 December, and returning to Fremantle on 3 January 1968. On 17 January 1968, Sydney departed Sydney on her ninth voyage to Vietnam.Nott & Payne, The Vung Tau Ferry, p. 173 Meeting Stuart off Singapore on 25 January, the two ships visited Sattahip, Thailand on 31 January before continuing on to Vietnam. Sydney arrived in V≈©ng T√†u on 3 February, and departed the same day for home; arriving in Sydney on 16 February. Sydneys tenth voyage began on 27 March, with 1 RAR embarked for their second Vietnam deployment, and the destroyer escort Parramatta meeting the troopship off Singapore.Lind, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 261 The battalion was delivered to V≈©ng T√†u on 9 April, with 7 RAR on board for the return to Australia, where they arrived on 26 April. The eleventh voyage saw Sydney, with the destroyer Anzac escorting, depart Brisbane on 21 May with 4 RAR aboard. The ships arrived at V≈©ng T√†u on 1 June, where the battalion was replaced by 2 RAR for the return voyage to Brisbane, which was reached on 13 June. After this voyage, Sydney underwent an extensive refit in which she was fitted with three new Favelle Favco-type cargo cranes and modified to carry six Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM (6)) on davits.Gillett, Warships of Australia, p. 131Andrews, Fighting Ships of Australia & New Zealand, p. 8 16 LCM were constructed for use with Sydney, but half were put up for sale in the early 1970s. During September and October, Sydney temporarily resumed flagship duties, and participated in the amphibious warfare exercise Coral Sands. After the exercise, the troopship undertook a training cruise to New Zealand. Sydneys twelfth voyage was to deliver 9 RAR to Vietnam.Nott & Payne, The Vung Tau Ferry, p. 174 The troopship sailed from Fremantle on 13 November, and met the destroyer Duchess off Singapore on 18 November. 9 RAR was delivered to V≈©ng T√†u on 20 November, while 3 RAR and a damaged de Havilland Caribou were loaded for the return trip, which concluded in Fremantle on 28 November. At the start of 1969, the RAN's ship designation and numbering system was altered from the British pennant system to a new system based on the United States' hull classifications: Sydney was assigned the pennant number P214.Jones, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 213 The troopship began her thirteenth voyage on 8 February 1969, when she sailed from Fremantle with 5 RAR aboard. Sydney and the destroyer escort Derwent arrived in V≈©ng T√†u on 15 February and departed the same day with 1 RAR embarked, with the troopship reaching Townsville on 25 February. A training cruise in March saw the ship visit New Zealand and Fiji. Sydney's fourteenth voyage, to deliver 6 RAR to Vietnam and return with 4 RAR, commenced on 8 May when Sydney sailed from Townsville. She met the destroyer Vampire off Singapore on 14 May, reached V≈©ng T√†u five days later, and arrived back in Brisbane on 30 May. On 17 November, Sydney and the destroyer Duchess departed Brisbane on the troopship's fifteenth voyage to Vietnam, with 8 RAR aboard.Nott & Payne, The Vung Tau Ferry, p. 175 The ships reached V≈©ng T√†u on 28 November; 8 RAR was replaced by 9 RAR, which was delivered to Fremantle on 5 December. Sydney, with 7 RAR on board, and the destroyer escort Yarra departed from Sydney for the sixteenth voyage on 16 February 1970. They arrived in Vietnam on 27 February, with Sydney embarking 5 RAR for the voyage to Fremantle, where they arrived on 5 March. On 16 April, Sydney was one of 45 vessels from 13 nations assembled in Sydney Harbour to celebrate the Australian Bicentenary, marking James Cook's discovery of the east coast of Australia.Lind, The Royal Australian Navy, pp. 274‚Äì5 Later that month, a visit to Portland, Victoria coincided with the Bicentenary Royal Tour of Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh. Sydney sailed from Fremantle on 21 October on the seventeenth voyage to Vietnam. The troopship met the destroyer Vendetta off Manila, and reached Vietnam on 31 October, where 2 RAR was offloaded and 8 RAR embarked. The two ships departed a day later, with Sydney reaching Brisbane on 12 November. At the start of February 1971, the troopship visited Hobart to serve as the flagship of the Royal Hobart Regatta, before she sailed to Adelaide, embarked 3 RAR, then departed on her eighteenth Vietnam voyage on 15 February.Nott & Payne, The Vung Tau Ferry, p. 176 Sydney met the destroyer escort Yarra en route, with both ships reaching V≈©ng T√†u on 25 February, where 7 RAR boarded for the return voyage. On 2 March, two days before reaching Fremantle, the ashes of Rear Admiral Harold Farncomb were scattered from Sydney. Fleet Air Arm in July 1971.

Smoke rises from the front tire. Water can be seen in the background. Sydney sailed again from Adelaide on 26 March for her nineteenth voyage, carrying general cargo and foreign aid supplies for the Khmer Republic. She met the destroyer Duchess off Singapore on 3 April, and the two ships arrived in V≈©ng T√†u on 5 April. The voyage officially ended when Sydney and Duchess arrived in Hong Kong on 8 April, and after a short period of recreational leave, the troopship returned to Australia.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 306 The twentieth voyage saw Sydney sail from Townsville on 13 May, with 4 RAR embarked. She met Duchess and Parramatta en route, and reached V≈©ng T√†u on 22 May.Nott & Payne, The Vung Tau Ferry, pp. 176‚Äì7 The ships left a day later, with 2 RAR aboard for the voyage home. Sydney arrived in Townsville on 1 June. In July 1971, Sydney sailed to Esquimalt, British Columbia, for Canada's centennial naval assembly. She then visited San Diego to collect ten new A-4G Skyhawk aircraft for the Fleet Air Arm, and delivered these to Australia in mid-August. On 20 September, Sydney departed on the twenty-first voyage to Vietnam.Nott & Payne, The Vung Tau Ferry, p. 177 The troopship first sailed to Singapore, where she offloaded equipment for the ANZUK force and met the destroyer escort Swan.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 175 The two ships were in V≈©ng T√†u for 6‚Äì7 October, during which 3 RAR was heli-lifted to Sydney for return to Australia, with the troopship arriving in Adelaide on 16 October.Ham, Vietnam, p. 555 Ten days later, Sydney sailed from her namesake city for her twenty-second visit to Vietnam, with a cargo of Defence Aid stores. Meeting the destroyer escort Derwent en route, Sydney arrived in V≈©ng T√†u on 6 November, where the stores were offloaded and replaced by Australian personnel and equipment from assorted units over a two-day period. Arriving back in Sydney, the troopship left again on 24 November for her twenty-third voyage to Vietnam.Nott & Payne, The Vung Tau Ferry, p. 178 Sydney met Swan off Subic Bay, then arrived in V≈©ng T√†u on 8 December, where 4 RAR, the 104th Battalion of the Royal Australian Artillery, and No. 9 Squadron were embarked for the return to Australia. The ship was visited by South Vietnamese President Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu before departing, who thanked the efforts of the Australian military during the Vietnam War. Sydney arrived in Townsville on 17 December. Sydney left for her twenty-fourth voyage to Vietnam on 14 February 1972; the troopship and the destroyer escort reached V≈©ng T√†u on 28 February, where 457 Australian soldiers from various units boarded. They left the next day, and Sydney reached Townsville on 9 March before arriving in her namesake city three days later, concluding the military involvement of the RAN in the Vietnam War.Lind, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 285 Sydney underwent a refit between 22 May and 20 October, then departed on 1 November for her twenty- fifth journey to Vietnam, carrying defence equipment and foreign aid supplies for South Vietnam and the Khmer Republic. Sydney and the destroyer Vampire reached V≈©ng T√†u on 23 November, and sailed a day later with miscellaneous Australian equipment aboard. During the return voyage, Sydney encountered the disabled merchant ship Kaiwing, and towed her to Hong Kong for repairs, arriving on 30 November. During her voyages to South Vietnam, Sydney transported 16,902 soldiers, 5,753 deadweight tons of cargo, 2,375 vehicles, and 14 aircraft.Grey, Up Top, p. 107 Initially, personnel from Sydney, the other transport ships, and their escorts, could not claim time served on logistics or escort deployments towards the active service requirements of the Vietnam Medal, the Australian Active Service Medal, or the Returned From Active Service Badge: the Department of Defence had attempted to limit the cost of repatriation benefits by taking the stance that these ships were not eligible as they were not in combat.Nott & Payne, The Vung Tau Ferry, p. 115Grey, Up Top, p. 117 Following numerous campaigns to change this, the Australian government issued the Returned from Active Service Badge to all these personnel in 1986, and allowed them to receive military service pensions.Nott & Payne, The Vung Tau Ferry, pp. 116‚Äì7 Further campaigning and legal challenges resulted in the creation of the Vietnam Logistic and Support Medal in 1992, which was presented as a campaign medal to personnel who did not meet the requirements for the Vietnam Medal, but were still involved in the conflict.Nott & Payne, The Vung Tau Ferry, pp. 118‚Äì9 Similar efforts were made to have Sydneys service recognised with a battle honour: according to Nott and Payne, such a battle honour is yet to be awarded as of 2008,Nott & Payne, The Vung Tau Ferry, p. 25 although a 2006 Department of Defence press release lists the honour \\"Vietnam 1965‚Äì72\\" among those awarded to the ship.Department of Defence, Next generation of naval ships to reflect a rich history of service [press release] The battle honour was confirmed in an updated list released in March 2010. Final years, decommissioning and fate The ship was assigned the pennant number L134 during 1973. At the start of the year, Sydney was marked for a potential deployment to Mururoa in support of a Royal New Zealand Navy frigate sent to protest French nuclear testing at the atoll.Frame & Baker, Mutiny!, pp. 236‚Äì7 The former carrier was chosen as she was capable of replenishing smaller vessels, and the RAN's dedicated replenishment oiler, , was undergoing refits.Frame & Baker, Mutiny!, p. 237 The Australian government did not want to send a warship until all other avenues of protest had been exhausted; the length of this delay meant Supplys refit was finished before Sydney was deployed, and the oiler was sent instead.Frame & Baker, Mutiny!, p. 242 Sydney visited Singapore in March, returned to Australia, and sailed to New Zealand in April: she participated in training exercises during both visits. The troopship was then involved in a joint warfare exercise in Jervis Bay during May. HMA Ships Sydney (right) and the carrier (left) On 20 July 1973, the Australian government decided that Sydney was to be decommissioned.Lind, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 286 A refit planned to start late in the year was cancelled, and on 12 November 1973, Sydney was paid off and marked for disposal. The ship had sailed since she was first commissioned: as an aircraft carrier, and as a fast troop transport. Several suggestions for disposal were made by various companies and agencies. The Geelong Regional Tourist Authority wanted the ship moored in Corio Bay for use as a maritime museum, convention centre, and floating casino. The Naval History Society of Australia suggested that the island superstructure be removed and located in The Rocks as a maritime museum, while the owners of the Sydney Opera House planned to use the ship as a floating car park. Tenders closed on 7 October 1975, and the ship was sold on 30 October for breaking up as scrap metal to the Dongkuk Steel Mill in Seoul, South Korea, for A$673,516. Sydney was towed from her namesake city by a Japanese tugboat on 23 December 1975, leaving at 1300 hours. Sydney had been originally slated for replacement in the 1960s, with rumours circulating that the new ship would either be an amphibious assault ship of the United States Iwo Jima class, or the British carrier .Lind, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 260 The assault ship rumour was proven false by the early 1970s, while the acquisition of Hermes was still under discussion in the 1980s as a possible replacement for sister ship HMAS Melbourne. Following the decommissioning of Sydney, the Australian Defence Force did not possess a long-range troop transportation capability until the modified Round Table-class landing ship was commissioned in 1981.Frame, No Pleasure Cruise, pp. 260‚Äì1 The ship's service, along with the previous two ships of the name, is commemorated by a stained-glass window at the Garden Island Naval Chapel. The carrier's chapel and bell were removed and installed at the naval base in 1974, then were relocated to the Australian National Maritime Museum's collection in the 1980s.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 178 One of Sydneys anchors is displayed at the Fleet Air Arm Museum at .

The frigate was one of six modified s ordered from 1977 onwards, and the third of four to be constructed in the United States of America. Laid down and launched in 1980, Sydney was named for the capital city of New South Wales, and commissioned into the RAN in 1983. During her operational history, Sydney has been involved in Australian responses to the 1987 Fijian coups d'√©tat and the Bougainville uprising. The frigate was deployed to the Persian Gulf on five occasions in support of United States operations during the Gulf War, War in Afghanistan, and the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and has completed two round-the-world voyages.

During the weekend of 7‚Äì8 February, the frigate was anchored in the River Derwent to free up wharf space for a civilian vessel. On attempting to return to Macquarie Wharf, the anchor chain broke, leaving the anchor below. The anchor was later recovered by divers. The loss of the anchor prevented Sydney from fulfilling duties as the regatta flagship, as the ship would be unable to maintain a stationary position during the event. Decommissioning and fate Sydney sailed into her namesake city for the final time on 27 February 2015. Despite flying a decommissioning pennant, the ship was not paid off until 7 November 2015; two years later than originally expected. In the interim, she was moored at Fleet Base East as an alongside training ship. On 6 November, the day prior to paying off, a parade of 350 current and former personnel from the ship marched in Sydney. At the time of decommissioning, Sydney had travelled .

At the , Uraidla had a population of 575. However it also sits at the centre of a larger population catchment of rural townships which include Summertown, Piccadilly, Ashton, Basket Range, Carey Gully, Norton Summit and Cherryville. History Once the home of the Peramangk Aboriginal people, European settlement commenced in the mid nineteenth century, a primary school opened in 1871 and the town was formally established in the 1880s. A tiny red brick building in the main street bears a plaque declaring that it was the local branch of the Scottish and Welsh Bank. The original courthouse (now a cottage) still stands on the corner of Swamp Road and Greenhill Road. The original general store still exists as a two-storey house near the junction of Days Road and Greenhill Road. The mainstreet of Uraidla was originally planted with a double avenue of European Elms. Only four of these remain. Etymology The name Uraidla is derived from local Aboriginal origins. The neighbouring Kaurna people (from the Adelaide plains) and a local subgroup known as Peramangk, had a tale about an ancestral giant who fell in battle and whose body formed part of the Mount Lofty Ranges, with his ears forming Mount Lofty and Mount Bonython. The name Yurrƒìidla thus derives from the Kaurna words yurre (ear) and the suffix denoting location, -illa (Teichelmann & Schurmann 1840Teichelmann, C. G.; C. W. Sch√ºrmann [1840] (1982). Outlines of a grammar, vocabulary and phraseology of the Aboriginal language of South Australia spoken by the natives in and for some distance around Adelaide. Tjintu Books. .). This was later corrupted to Uraidla and adopted as the name of the town. Industries Market gardens in Uraidla Uraidla and the surrounding area is an agricultural district with vegetable market gardens on large scale producing leek, cabbage and lettuce, with apple and cherry orchards, along with vineyards producing many local wine vintages. Local wineries that are part of the Adelaide Hills wine district include Parish Hills Wines and Barratt Wines. The Uraidla Hotel had been closed for several years from 2013, but was refurbished in 2016 and now enjoys pride of place in the town with an eclectic mix of decor, and sourcing local produce, wines, beers and ciders. A bottleshop and bakery, also run by the Uraidla Hotel now occupy the adjacent building that once housed the Squash Courts. A converted church across from the hotel dubbed 'Lost in a Forest' provides local wines and wood oven pizzas, whilst the name of a former local restaurant 'The Aristologist' has been resurrected n the form of a Tapas Bar in nearby Summertown. The central oval and showgrounds are used annually for the historic Uraidla and Summertown Show, drawing many hundreds of people, traditionally in mid-February; shifted in 2017 to early November. Uraidla is also traditionally a centre for sport with Australian Rules Football, Netball, Tennis and Lawn Bowls the main sports. The Football Club Rooms and Bowling Club both have licensed premises. Uraidla and nearby Summertown and Carey Gully are serviced by a mixed business General Store and Post Office and a Village Pharmacy and Health Spa, Hairdresser, Civil Engineering and the Uraidla Family Practice. Private massage therapists, chiropractors, artists and craftspeople, a metal foundry, a salvage warehouse and a freestone quarry also operate in the town or immediate area. The former Returned Servicemen's League Hall in the main street is now being used by the Country Fire Service as the hub for the several local fire crews of Ashton, Summertown, Carey Gully and Piccadilly.

The chief town is ≈†abac. The modern Maƒçva District of Serbia is named after the region, although the region of Maƒçva includes only the northern part of this district. A small northern part of Maƒçva region is in the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, in the Syrmia District. Name The region is named after a town of Maƒçva, which existed in the Medieval Ages near the river Sava. In the past, the region was also known as Lower Srem, while the neighbouring region on the northern bank of the river Sava (present-day Srem) was known as Upper Srem. In Serbian Cyrillic, the region is known as –ú–∞—á–≤–∞, in Serbian Latin, Bosnian and Croatian as Maƒçva, in Hungarian as Macs√≥ or Macs√≥s√°g, in Turkish as Ma√ßva, and in German as Matschva. History Throughout history, the region of Maƒçva has successively been a part of the Roman Empire (1st-4th century); the Byzantine Empire (4th-5th century; 5th-7th century; and 11th-12th century), the Hun Empire (5th century), Avar Khaganate (7th century), the Slavic-controlled territories (7th-9th century), the Bulgarian Empire (9th-11th century), the Kingdom of Hungary (12th-13th century; 14th century; 15th century; 16th century), the State of Serb king Stefan Dragutin (13th-14th century), the Serbian Empire (14th century), the State of Nikola Altomanoviƒá (14th century), the Moravian Serbia (14th century), the Serbian Despotate (15th century), the Ottoman Empire (15th century; 16th-18th century; 18th-19th century), the Kingdom of Serbia under the Habsburg Monarchy (1718‚Äì1739), Karaƒëorƒëe's Serbia (1804‚Äì1813), the vassal Principality of Serbia (1815‚Äì1878), the independent Principality of Serbia (1878‚Äì1882), the Kingdom of Serbia (1882‚Äì1918), the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (1918‚Äì1929), the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1929‚Äì1941), the area governed by the Military Administration in Serbia (1941‚Äì1944), the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1944‚Äì1992), the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1992‚Äì2003), and Serbia and Montenegro (2003‚Äì2006). Since 2006, the region is part of an independent Serbia. Maƒçva was inhabited since the Stone Age. Before the Roman conquest, the region was inhabited by Illyrianshttp://www.roman-glory.com/images/img050101-05.jpg and Celtic Scordisces. In the first century BC, the region was conquered by the Romans, and Scordisces were pushed to the northern side of the Sava river. During the Roman rule, the region was part of the provinces of Moesia and Pannonia. Roman rule lasted until the 5th century, and the region was conquered by the Sarmatians, Huns, Goths, Gepids, Lombards and Avars. In the 6th century, Slavic tribes settled in the region. Kingdom of Srem of Stefan Dragutin (1291‚Äì1316) Banate of Macho in 1370 Banovina of Maƒçva in 1490 The region was then included into Byzantine Empire, Frankish Kingdom, and Bulgarian Empire. In the 11th century, the Byzantine province known as the Theme of Sirmium included both, the present-day region of Srem and Maƒçva, thus the name of Srem became designation for the both regions. In the 13th century, the region was included into the Kingdom of Hungary and Banovina of Maƒçva was formed in 1247. Banovina was named after a town called Maƒçva, but the location of this settlement has not been clearly established in modern times. It is suspected that the town of Maƒçva existed a few kilometers down the river from modern ≈†abac. During the Hungarian administration the region was ruled by several powerful bans. Hungarian king B√©la IV granted authority over Maƒçva to Rostislav Mikhailovich, a refugee Russian prince. In the 13th century, B√©la of Macs√≥ (grandson of B√©la IV) ruled Maƒçva as well as Usora and Soli (areas across Drina river in today's northeastern Bosnia). Between 1282 and 1316 the Serb King Stefan Dragutin ruled the Kingdom of Srem, which consisted of Maƒçva, Usora, Soli and some adjacent territories. His capital cities were Debrc (between Belgrade and ≈†abac) and Belgrade. In that time the name Srem was designation for two territories: Upper Srem (present day Srem) and Lower Srem (present day Maƒçva). Kingdom of Srem under the rule of Stefan Dragutin was located in Lower Srem. According to some sources, Stefan Dragutin also ruled over Upper Srem, but other sources are mentioning another local ruler, Ugrin Cs√°k, who ruled over Upper Srem and Slavonija. At first, Stefan Dragutin was a vassal of the Hungarian king, but since the central power in the Kingdom of Hungary collapsed, both, Stefan Dragutin and Ugrin Cs√°k were de facto independent rulers. Stephen Dragutin died in 1316, and was succeeded by his son, King Vladislaus II (1316‚Äì1324). Vladislaus II was defeated by the king of Serbia, Stefan Deƒçanski, in 1324, and after this, Maƒçva became a subject of dispute between the Kingdom of Serbia and the Kingdom of Hungary. In the 14th century, the bans of the Garay family (Paul Garay, Nicholas I Garay and his son Nicholas II Garay) which were under the Hungarian suzerainty expanded their rule not only to Bosnia but to Srem and the last one also became the ban of Slavonia and Croatia, which was also part of the Kingdom of Hungary at the time.

In the 15th century, Maƒçva was part of Serbian Despotate, and since 1459, it was part of the Ottoman Empire. In the 16th-17th century, Maƒçva was part of the Ottoman Sanjak of Zvornik, which was part of the Pashaluk of Bosnia. It was under Ottoman administration until 1718, when it was captured by the Habsburgs. Between 1718 and 1739, Maƒçva was part of the Habsburg-administered Kingdom of Serbia, and since 1739, it was again part of the Ottoman Empire. In this time, the region was part of the Ottoman Sanjak of Smederevo. In 1788, the \\"Maƒçvanska kne≈æina\\" (\\"Princedom of Maƒçva\\" - a local administrative unit) had 25 villages with 845 houses. The name of the local administrator (\\"oberknez\\") was Uro≈° Drmanoviƒá. Between 1804 and 1815, Maƒçva was part of Serbia ruled by Karaƒëorƒëe. Since 1817, it was part of the autonomous Principality of Serbia, and since 1882, part of the Kingdom of Serbia. During World War I, the Austro-Hungarian army occupied the region and committed war crimes against innocent Serb civilians in Maƒçva and Podrinje. Beginning in 1918, the region was part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed Yugoslavia). Between 1918 and 1922 the region was part of Podrinjski okrug, between 1922 and 1929 part of Podrinjska oblast, while between 1929 and 1941 it was part of Drina Banovina. Between 1941 and 1944, Maƒçva was part of the area governed by the Military Administration in Serbia, and since 1945, it has been part of the Socialist Republic of Serbia and new socialist Yugoslavia. After the breakup of Yugoslavia and Yugoslav wars, Maƒçva became part of an independent Serbia.

Although the Underground State enjoyed broad support throughout much of the war, it was not supported or recognized by the far left (communists). The nationalists from the National Radical Camp Falanga and National Radical Camp ABC opposed the German occupation of Poland and the two movements were quickly replaced by the Konfederacja Narodu, a part of the Polish Underground State which also included most members of the pre-war far-right. Influence of the communists eventually declined amid military reversals (most notably, the failure of the Warsaw Uprising) and the growing hostility of the USSR. The Soviet Union had created an alternative, puppet government in 1944 (the Polish Committee of National Liberation) and ensured it formed the basis of the post-war government in Poland. During the Soviet-backed communist takeover of Poland at the end of the war, many Underground State members were prosecuted as alleged traitors and died in captivity. Abandoned by the Western Allies, finding it impossible to negotiate with the Soviets, and wishing to avoid a civil war, the key institutions of the Underground State dissolved themselves in the first half of 1945. Ultimately, hundreds of thousands of people were directly involved with various agencies of the Underground State (the estimates for membership in Armia Krajowa alone are often given at approaching half a million people), and they were quietly supported by millions of Polish citizens. The rationale behind the creation of the secret civilian authority drew on the fact that the German and Soviet occupation of Poland was illegal. Hence, all institutions created by the occupying powers were considered illegal, and parallel Polish underground institutions were set up in accordance with Polish law. The scale of the Underground State was also inadvertently aided by the actions of the occupiers, whose attempts to destroy the Polish state, nation, and its culture, including most importantly genocidal policies that targeted Polish citizens, fuelled popular support for the Polish resistance movement and its development. During the Cold War era, research on the Underground State was curtailed by Polish communist officials, who instead emphasized the role that communist partisans played in the anti- Nazi resistance. Hence, until recently, the bulk of research done on this topic was carried out by Polish scholars living in exile. History =1939‚Äì1940: Formation= In many respects, the history of the Polish Underground State mirrors that of the Polish non-communist resistance in general. The Underground State traces its origins to the Service for Poland's Victory (S≈Çu≈ºba Zwyciƒôstwu Polski, SZP) organization, which was founded on 27 September 1939, one day before the surrender of the Polish capital of Warsaw, at a time when the Polish defeat in the German invasion of Poland (accompanied by the Soviet one) appeared inevitable. SZP founder General Micha≈Ç Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski received orders from Polish Commander-in-Chief Marshal Edward Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy to organize and carry out the struggle in occupied Poland. Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski decided that the organization he was creating needed to move beyond a strictly military format; and in line with the traditions of the underground 19th-century Polish National Government and World War I-era Polish Military Organization, it would need to encompass various aspects of civilian life. Hence, the SZP, in contact with (and subordinate to) the Polish Government in Exile, envisioned itself not only as an armed resistance organization, but also as a vehicle through which the Polish state continued to administer its occupied territories. Following the Polish Constitution, President Ignacy Mo≈õcicki, interned in Romania after the Polish government evacuated itself from Poland on 17 September, resigned and appointed General Boles≈Çaw Wieniawa-D≈Çugoszowski as his successor; unpopular with the French government, Wieniawa-D≈Çugoszowski was replaced by W≈Çadys≈Çaw Raczkiewicz on 29 September. General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski, a long-term opponent of the Sanacja regime who resided in France and had the support of the French government, would become the Polish Commander-in-Chief (on 28 September) and Poland's Prime Minister (on 30 September). This government was quickly recognized by France and the United Kingdom. Raczkiewicz, described as \\"weak and indecisive\\", held relatively little influence compared to charismatic Sikorski. Due to political differences among factions in the Polish exile government, and in particular, SZP ties to the Sanacja regime which dominated the Polish government since mid-1920s, the SZP was reorganized into the Union of Armed Struggle (ZwiƒÖzek Walki Zbrojnej, ZWZ) on 13 November 1939. Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski supported that move, aiming to include parties marginalized by the Sanacja regime, and supported the formation of the Main Political Council (G≈Ç√≥wna Rada Polityczna, GRP). Sikorski named General Kazimierz Sosnkowski the head of the ZWZ and Colonel Stefan Rowecki was appointed the commander of the ZWZ German occupation zone. Karaszewicz- Tokarzewski became the commander of the ZWZ Soviet zone, but was arrested in March 1940 by the Soviets when attempting to cross the new German-Soviet border. In June Sikorski appointed Rowecki as the commander of both zones. W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski, Polish commander in chief and prime minister during World War II Given that the ZWZ focused on military aspects of the struggle, its civilian dimension was less clearly defined and developed more slowly‚Äîa situation exacerbated by the complex political discussions that were then unfolding between politicians in occupied Poland and the government in exile (first located in Paris, and after the fall of France, in London). Sikorski's government opted for a much more democratic procedure then the less democratic prewar Sanacja regime. The National Council (Rada Narodowa) was formed by the government in exile in December 1939, including representatives from different Polish political factions. Meanwhile, in occupied Poland, a major step toward the development of the organization's civilian structure was taken in late February 1940, when the ZWZ established its local version of the National Council, the Political Consultative Committee (Polityczny Komitet Porozumiewawczy, PKP). The structures in occupied Poland maintained close communication with the government in exile, through radio communications and \\"hundreds, if not thousands\\" of couriers, such as Jan Karski. One of the most significant developments of 1940 was the creation of the office of Government Delegation for Poland (Delegatura RzƒÖdu na Kraj), with Cyryl Ratajski (nominated on 3 December) as the first Delegate; this event marked the official beginning of the Underground State (Ratajski would be followed by Jan Pieka≈Çkiewicz, Jan Stanis≈Çaw Jankowski and Stefan Korbo≈Ñski). The post of the Delegate could be seen as equivalent to that of a Deputy Prime Minister (particularly since the legislation of 1944). Unlike the GRP and PKP, which operated alongside the military structures but had no influence over them, the Delegation had budgetary control over the military. The Delegation was to oversee the military, and recreate the civilian administration. As early as 1940, the Underground State's civilian arm was actively supporting underground education; it then set out to develop social security, information (propaganda) and justice networks. =1941‚Äì1943: Growth= By 1942, most of the differences between politicians in occupied Poland and those in exile had been positively settled. By 1943, the PKP had evolved into the Home Political Representation (Krajowa Reprezentacja Polityczna, KRP), which served as the basis of the Council of National Unity (Rada Jedno≈õci Narodowej, RJN), created on 9 January 1944. The Council, headed by Kazimierz Pu≈ºak, was seen as the Underground State's parliament. Meanwhile, the military arm of the Underground State expanded dramatically, and the ZWZ was transformed into Armia Krajowa (AK, or the Home Army) in 1942. ZWZ-AK commanders included Stefan Rowecki, Tadeusz Komorowski and Leopold Okulicki. In August 1943 and March 1944, the Polish Underground State announced its long-term plan, which was partly designed to undercut the attractiveness of some of the communists' proposals. The communists, in their increasingly radical What We Fight For declarations (from March and November 1943), were proposing the creation of a heavily socialist or even communist state, denouncing capitalism, which they equated to slavery. They demanded nationalization of most if not all of the economy, introduction of central planning, The Underground State's declaration What the Polish Nation is Fighting For declared the reconstruction of Poland as a democratic parliamentary state as its goal, guaranteeing full equality to the minorities, as well as full freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of political activity. The plan also called for the creation of a Central European federal union, without domination by any single state. In the economic sector, planned economy would be endorsed, by embracing the socialist and Christian Democrat principles, such as income redistribution, aiming at a reduction of economic inequality. The plan promised land reform, nationalization of the industrial base, demands for territorial compensation from Germany, and re-establishment of the country's pre-1939 eastern border. According to the plan, the country's Eastern borders, as delineated by the 1921 Treaty of Riga, would be kept while in the north and west compensation would be sought from German territories. Thus, the main differences between the Underground State and the communists, in terms of politics, were not rooted in radical economic and social reforms, which both sides advocated, but rather in their divergent positions on such issues as national sovereignty, borders, and Polish-Soviet relations. The program was criticized by the nationalist factions, for being too socialist, and not \\"Christian\\" enough. The Underground State achieved its zenith of influence in early 1944. In April, the Polish government in exile recognized the administrative structure of the Delegate's Office as the Temporary Governmental Administration. This was when the Delegate officially became recognized as the Deputy Prime Minister, and the Council of Ministers at Home (Krajowa Rada Ministr√≥w, KRM) was created. The Underground State however declined sharply in the aftermath of the nationwide uprising, Operation Tempest, initiated in the Spring of 1944. In addition to the costly and eventually unsuccessful Warsaw Uprising part of the Operation Tempest, the hostile attitude of the Soviet Union and its puppet Polish government, the Polish Committee of National Liberation (Polski Komitet Wyzwolenia Narodowego, PKWN) towards the non-communist resistance loyal to the Polish government in exile proved to be disastrous. The Underground State assumed that the Polish resistance would aid the advancing Soviet forces, and AK commanders and representatives of the administrative authority would assume the role of legitimate hosts. Instead, the Soviets commonly surrounded, disarmed and arrested the Underground's military authority members and its civilian representatives, instituting their own administrative structures instead. In early July 1944, even as the AK resistance continued its struggle against the Germans, the Underground State was forced to order the AK and its administrative structure to remain in hiding from the Soviets, due to continued arrests and reprisals experienced by those who revealed themselves. =1944‚Äì1945: Decline and dissolution= Events taking place in 1943 significantly weakened the Polish government in exile. A rift developed between Poland and the Soviet Union, an increasingly important ally for the West, particularly after the revelation of the Katyn massacre in 1943 (on 13 April), followed by the breaking-off of diplomatic relations with Poland by the Soviets (on 21 April). The subsequent death (on 4 July) of the charismatic General Sikorski, succeeded by less influential Stanis≈Çaw Miko≈Çajczyk as the Prime Minister, and General Sosnkowski as the Commander-in-Chief, contributed to the decline. No representative of the Polish government was invited to the Tehran Conference (28 November 28 ‚Äì 1 December 1943) or the Yalta Conference (4‚Äì11 February 1945), the two crucial events in which the Western Allies and the Soviet Union discussed the shape of the post-war world and decided on the fate of Poland, assigning it to the Soviet sphere of influence. In Teheran, neither Churchill nor Roosevelt objected to Stalin's suggestion that the Polish government in exile in London was not representing Polish interests; as historian Anita Pra≈ºmowska noted, \\"this spelled the end of that government's tenuous influence and raison d'√™tre.\\" After the Teheran Conference, Stalin decided to create his own puppet government for Poland, and the PKWN was proclaimed in 1944. PKWN was recognized by the Soviet Government as the only legitimate authority in Poland, while Miko≈Çajczyk's Government in London, was termed by the Soviets an \\"illegal and self-styled authority.\\" Miko≈Çajczyk would serve in the Prime Minister's role until 24 November 1944, when, realizing the increasing powerlessness of the government in exile, he resigned and was succeeded by Tomasz Arciszewski, \\"whose obscurity\\", in the words of historian Mieczys≈Çaw B. Biskupski, \\"signaled the arrival of the government in exile at total inconsequentiality.\\" Stefan Korbo≈Ñski, the last delegate The communists refused to deal with the Underground State just like they refused to deal with the government in exile; its leaders and soldiers in \\"liberated\\" Polish territories were persecuted. A number of prominent leaders of the Underground State, including the Government Delegate, Jan Stanis≈Çaw Jankowski and the last AK Commander-in-Chief, General Leopold Okulicki, who decided to reveal themselves and upon the Soviet invitation begun open negotiations with the communist authorities, were arrested and sentenced by the Soviets in Moscow in the infamous Trial of the Sixteen (arrests were carried out in March 1945, and the trial itself took place in June that year). On 27 June 1945 the Council of National Unity held its last session, issuing a 12-point declaration demanding that the Soviet army leave Poland and the repression of the non-communist political parties cease. The Government Delegate's Office at Home, restructured after the arrests of its leadership and headed by the last Delegate, Stefan Korbo≈Ñski, disbanded on 1 July, after the creation in Moscow of the Provisional Government of National Unity (Tymczasowy RzƒÖd Jedno≈õci Narodowej, TRJN) on 28 June 1945. The disbanding of those structures marked the end of the Underground State. The TRJN was composed primarily of communist representatives from the PKWN, with a token representation of the opposition as a gesture towards the Western Allies. With the establishment of the TRJN, the government in exile stopped being recognized by the Western Allies (France withdrew its recognition on 29 June, followed by United Kingdom and the United States on 5 July), who decided to support the Soviet-backed and increasingly communist TRJN body. Seeing this as a \\"Western betrayal\\", the government in exile protested that decision and continued to operate till the fall of communism in 1989, when it recognized the post-communist Polish government. The rigged Polish legislative election of 1947 marked the onset of undisguised Communist rule in Poland; the few independent politicians like Miko≈Çajczyk who attempted to form an opposition were threatened with arrests, retired or emigrated. The Underground State's military arm, Armia Krajowa, officially disbanded on 19 January 1945 to avoid armed conflict with the Soviets and a civil war. Over the next few years the communists solidified their hold on Poland, falsifying elections, persecuting the opposition and eliminating it as a political power. Remnants of the armed resistance (NIE, Armed Forces Delegation for Poland, Freedom and Independence) that refused to lay down their weapons and surrender to the communist regime continued to hold out for several years as the cursed soldiers, fighting the Soviet-backed communist forces until eradicated. Political representation The Underground State represented most, though not all, political factions of the Second Polish Republic. The Political Consultative Committee (PKP) represented four major Polish parties: the Socialist Party (PPS-WRN), the People's Party (SL), the SN, and the Labor Party (SP). The SP joined the PKP in June 1940, four months after the PKP was created; and the PPS-WRN withdrew from the PKP between October 1941 and March 1943. Those parties, known as the Big Four, were also represented in the Home Political Representation (KRP). Compared to PKP and KRP, the Council of National Unity was much more representative, and included representatives of several smaller political groupings. Several other groups lacked significant representation in PKP and KRP, but nonetheless had supported the Underground State. Non-Polish ethnic minorities, primarily the Ukrainians and the Belarusians, were not represented in the Underground State; however the Jews were. The most important groups that lacked representation in the Underground State included the communist (Polish Workers Party (PPR) and its military arm, the Gwardia Ludowa), and the far right (Group Szaniec and its military arm, the Military Organization Lizard Union). Both the extreme left (the communists) and the extreme right (the nationalists) saw themselves in opposition to the Underground State. Only the PPR, however, opposed to Polish independence and supporting full inclusion of Poland in the Soviet Union, was seen as completely outside the framework of the State; the other groups were seen as a legitimate opposition. In 1944 PPR would become part of the PKWN Soviet puppet government. Structure =Civilian= Information Bulletin, 15 July 1943, reporting the death of Gen. Sikorski and ordering a national day of mourning The government in exile, located first in France and later in the United Kingdom, with the President, Prime Minister and the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Army was the top military and civilian authority, recognized by the authorities of the Underground State as their commanders. The government in exile was represented in the occupied Poland by the Government Delegation for Poland, headed by the Government Delegate for Poland. The main role of the civilian branch of the Underground State was to preserve the continuity of the Polish state as a whole, including its institutions. These institutions included the police, the courts, and schools. This branch of the state was intended to prepare cadres and institutions to resume power after the German defeat in World War II. By the final years of the war, the civilian structure of the Underground State included an underground parliament, administration, judiciary (courts and police), secondary and higher level education, and supported various cultural activities such as publishing of newspapers and books, underground theatres, lectures, exhibitions, concerts and safeguarded various works of art. It also dealt with providing social services, including to the destitute Jewish population (through the Council to Aid Jews, or ≈ªegota). Through the Directorate of Civil Resistance (1941‚Äì1943) the civil arm was also involved in lesser acts of resistance, such as minor sabotage, although in 1943 this department was merged with the Directorate of Covert Resistance, forming the Directorate of Underground Resistance, subordinate to AK. The departments can be seen as loosely corresponding to ministries. Three departments were dedicated to war-related issues: the Department for Elimination of the Consequences of War, the Department for Public Works and Reconstruction, and the Department for Information and the Press; the other departments mirrored pre-war Polish ministries (e.g., Department of Post Offices and Telegraphs, or Department of the Treasury). The Delegate's Office was divided into departments, 14 of which existed toward the end of the war; the full list included: the Presidential Department, the Department of Internal Affairs, Justice Department, Employment and Social Welfare Department, Agriculture Department, Treasury Department, Trade and Industry Department, Postal and Telegraph Services Department, the Department for Elimination of the Consequences of War, Transport Department, Information and the Press, Department of Public Works and Reconstruction, Department of Education and Culture and the Department of National Defence. On the geographical division level, the Delegation had local offices, dividing Polish territories into 16 voivodeships, each under an underground voivode, further divided into powiats headed by starostas, and with separate municipal bodies. In early 1944, the Delegation employed some 15,000 people in its administration; those were primarily older people, as the younger ones were recruited for the military side of the operations. =Military= Regional organization of Armia Krajowa in 1944 The military arm of the Polish Underground State consisted primarily of various branches of the Armia Krajowa (AK) and, until 1942, the Union of Armed Struggle. This arm of the state was designed to prepare the Polish society for a future fight for the country's liberation. Apart from armed resistance, sabotage, intelligence, training, and propaganda, the state's military arm was responsible for maintaining communication with the London- based government in exile, and for protecting the civilian arm of the state. The Armia Krajowa's primary resistance operations were the sabotage of German activities, including transports headed for the Eastern Front in the Soviet Union. The sabotage of German rail and road transports to the Eastern Front was so extensive it is estimated that one eighth of all German transports to the Eastern Front were destroyed or significantly delayed due to AK's activities. The AK also fought several full-scale battles against the Germans, particularly in 1943 and 1944 during Operation Tempest. They tied down significant German forces, worth at least several divisions (upper estimates suggest about 930,000 troops), diverting much-needed supplies, while trying to support the Soviet military. Polish intelligence operatives supplied valuable intelligence information to the Allies; 43 percent of all reports received by British secret services from continental Europe in 1939‚Äì45 came from Polish sources. At its height, AK numbered over 400,000 and was recognized as one of the three largest, or even the largest, resistance movement of the war. Axis fatalities due to the actions of the Polish underground, of which AK formed the bulk, are estimated at up to 150,000. Definition, historiography and remembrance The Polish Underground State Monument in Pozna≈Ñ For decades, research on the Polish Underground State was restricted, largely because the communist People's Republic of Poland did not wish to fully acknowledge the role of the non-communist resistance. During the first postwar Stalinist years, efforts to explore this topic were regarded as dangerous, bordering on illegal. Research into the events occurring in the Soviet-annexed territories in the 1939‚Äì1941 period was particularly difficult. The limited research devoted to the Underground State that did take place was done mainly by Polish √©migr√© historians living in the West. The communist state downplayed the importance of the non-communist resistance movements, while the communist movement (Armia Ludowa) was emphasized as being of primary importance; in fact, the opposite was true. The absence of research by Polish scholars, along with obstacles presented to foreign scholars seeking access to source material in communist Poland, contributed to a situation in which there was virtually no discussion by Western scholars of one of Europe's largest resistance movements‚Äîthe non-communist Polish resistance movement. The bulk of Western research centred on the much smaller French Resistance (la R√©sistance). With the fall of communism, Poland regained full independence and Polish scholars could begin unrestricted research into all aspects of Polish history. Scholars who chose to investigate the Underground State were also confronted with the issue of its uniqueness (no country or nation has ever created a similar institution), and hence, the problem of defining it. Polish historian Stanis≈Çaw Salmonowicz, discussing the historiography of the Polish Underground State, defined it as a \\"collection of state-legal, organizational and citizenship structures, which were to ensure constitutional continuation of Polish statehood on its own territory\\". Salmonowicz concluded that \\"This constitutional continuity, real performance of the state's functions on its past territory and the loyalty of a great majority of Polish society were the most significant elements of its existence.\\" The Underground State also became officially recognized by the Polish government, local authorities and the community, with most major cities in Poland erecting various memorials to the Underground State affiliated resistance. In Pozna≈Ñ, there is a dedicated Polish Underground State Monument erected in 2007. On 11 September 1998 the Sejm (parliament) of Poland declared the day of 27 September (anniversary of the founding of the Service for Poland's Victory organization) to be the Day of the Polish Underground State.

Polish Secret State (Polish: Tajne pa≈Ñstwo) was a term used by Jan Karski in his book Story of a Secret State, written and first published in the second half of 1944 in the United States. : b Several sources note that the Armia Krajowa was the largest resistance movement in Nazi- occupied Europe. For example, Norman Davies wrote \\"Armia Krajowa (Home Army), the AK, which could fairly claim to be the largest of European resistance\\"; Gregor Dallas wrote \\"Home Army (Armia Krajowa or AK) in late 1943 numbered around 400,000, making it the largest resistance organization in Europe\\"; Mark Wyman wrote \\"Armia Krajowa was considered the largest underground resistance unit in wartime Europe\\". Certainly, the Polish resistance was the largest resistance movement until the German invasion of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union in 1941; in the last years of the war those two resistances would rival AK in its strength (see Resistance during World War II for a more detailed analysis). Compared to them, the size of the French resistance was smaller, numbering around 10,000 people in 1942, and swelling to 200,000 by 1944.

Teng has released five studio albums: Waking Hour (2002), Warm Strangers (2004), Dreaming Through the Noise (2006), Inland Territory (2009) and Aims (2013). She has also released one live album, The Moment Always Vanishing (2009), on which she is double-billed with her percussionist, Alex Wong. Teng's musical style incorporates folk, pop, classical piano, and a cappella. Early life, education, and early career  A native of Saratoga, California, she began playing classical piano at the age of five. Both her parents came from Taiwan. She was salutatorian at Saratoga High School. In 1996, while pursuing a degree in computer science at Stanford University, Teng joined the Stanford Harmonics, a student-run a cappella group. She began recording her compositions at the studios in Stanford's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA), intending to distribute her music on campus. Many of these recordings were eventually released in her d√©but album Waking Hour. After graduating in 2000, Teng worked as a software engineer for Cisco Systems in San Jose, but she continued to write music and perform in her free time. In 2002, Teng signed with Virt Records and quit Cisco Systems to focus on her musical career. Career =Waking Hour and Warm Strangers= Teng's first major national exposure was on National Public Radio's Weekend Edition in January 2003, followed shortly thereafter by CBS's Late Show with David Letterman. She has since made appearances on the CBS Saturday Early Show, CNN's NewsNight with Aaron Brown and The Wayne Brady Show, and opened concerts for Joan Baez, Shawn Colvin, Joan Osborne, India.Arie, Brandi Carlile, Sarah Harmer and Marc Cohn. Although nearly all of Teng's recordings are in English, Warm Strangers features a hidden cover of \\"Green Island Serenade\\", a 1950s Taiwanese classic performed in Mandarin Chinese. =Dreaming Through the Noise= In 2006, Teng signed with Zo√´/Rounder. From December 2006 to early 2007, Teng toured extensively in the United States to promote the release of her third album, Dreaming Through the Noise. Teng co-headlined with Duncan Sheik and opened for Madeleine Peyroux. She began the Green Caravan Tour in April 2007, accompanied by cellist Marika Hughes, violinist Dina Maccabee, and percussionist Alex Wong, along with opening acts such as David Berkeley and Jenny Owen Youngs. She performed a cover version of Radiohead's \\"Idioteque\\" during this time. In 2008, she relocated from California to New York City, and performed in Central Park on Earth Day at the Green Apple Festival. =Inland Territory and Study at the University of Michigan= Her fourth album, Inland Territory, was released in 2009. Teng stated that the lyrics to \\"Grandmother Song\\" from Inland Territory are nearly a verbatim translation of a lecture that Teng received from her Mandarin-speaking grandmother, voicing her disapproval of Teng's career choice. In 2010, Teng announced to her fans that she had been accepted into the Erb Institute for Global Sustainable Enterprise at the University of Michigan. Through the program, she received an MBA from the Ross School of Business and an MS from the School of Natural Resources and Environment. During this period, Teng moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where she continued to perform and compose music, although she did not tour as frequently as she had before enrolling. After graduating from the University of Michigan in 2013, she worked at McKinsey & Company full-time in the area of renewable energy. =Aims= Teng's fifth studio album, titled Aims, was released in September 2013. From September to December 2013 Teng went on a tour across the United States and Western Europe to promote the new material. During this tour, she performed as a trio with Alex Wong and Jordan Hamlin, two other musicians who appeared on the album. The album was released in a standard edition and in deluxe edition sold through Teng's website. In early 2019, Teng announced her marriage to Jacob Corvidae.

Hyposplenism is used to describe reduced ('hypo-') splenic functioning, but not as severely affected as with asplenism. Functional asplenia occurs when splenic tissue is present but does not work well (e.g. sickle-cell disease, polysplenia) -such patients are managed as if asplenic-, while in anatomic asplenia, the spleen itself is absent. Causes =Congenital= * Congenital asplenia is rare. There are two distinct types of genetic disorders: heterotaxy syndromeOnline Mendelian Inheritance in Man.

Johns Hopkins University. * polysplenia =Acquired= Acquired asplenia occurs for several reasons: * Following splenectomy due to splenic rupture from trauma or because of tumor * After splenectomy with the goal of interfering with splenic function, as a treatment for diseases (e.g. idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, thalassemia, spherocytosis), in which the spleen's usual activity exacerbates the disease * After splenectomy with the goal of arresting the progression of cancers (Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin's disease (starting in the 1970s), non- Hodgkin lymphoma) * Due to underlying diseases that destroy the spleen (autosplenectomy), e.g. sickle-cell disease. * Celiac disease: unknown physiopathology. In a 1970 study, it was the second most common cause of abnormalities of red blood cells linked to hyposplenism, after surgical splenectomy.  Functional asplenia  Functional asplenia can occur when patients with metabolic or haematological disorders have their splenic tissue organisation altered. This can lead to results similar to those seen in patients who have undergone a splenectomy e.g. becoming infected with encapsulated bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. Patients who have some form of asplenia have an increased susceptibility to these encapsulated bacterial infections mainly because they lack IgM memory B cells and their non-adherence to polysaccharide vaccines. Furthermore there is a deficiency of other splenic cells e.g. splenic macrophages. This combined with the lack of B cells can provide an environment favourable for the development of bacterial infections. Partial splenectomy and preservation of splenic function In an effort to preserve some of the spleen's protective roles, attempts are now often made to preserve a small part of the spleen when performing either surgical subtotal (partial) splenectomy, or partial splenic embolization. This may be particularly important in poorer countries where protective measures for patients with asplenia are not available. However, it has been advised that preoperative vaccination is advisable until the remnant splenic tissue can reestablish its function. Risks Asplenia is a form of immunodeficiency, increasing the risk of sepsis from polysaccharide encapsulated bacteria, and can result in overwhelming post splenectomy infection (OPSI), often fatal within a few hours. In particular, patients are at risk from Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and meningococcus. The risk is elevated as much as 350‚Äìfold.AAP Red Book 2006. The increased risk of infection is due to inability to clear opsonised bacteria from circulating blood. There is also a deficiency of T-cell independent antibodies, such as those reactive to the polysaccharide capsule of Streptococcus pneumoniae.Kasper, D. et al (2015) Harrison's principles of internal medicine. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Education The risk to asplenic patients has been expressed as equivalent to an adult dying in a road traffic accident (in every 100 people without spleens, 1 to 5 would develop a severe infection per decade) (reference UK Splenectomy Trust Advice)‚Äîhence sensible precautions are advisable. \\\\- reprint from Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust Increased platelet counts can be seen in individuals without a functioning spleen. Diagnosis Diagnosis is confirmed by abdominal ultrasonography and detection of Howell-Jolly bodies in red blood cells. Management To minimise the risks associated with splenectomy, antibiotic and vaccination protocols have been established, \\\\- published as a response by original authors but are often poorly adhered to by physicians and patients due to the complications resulting from antibiotic prophylaxis such as development of an overpopulation of Clostridium difficile in the intestinal tract. =Antibiotic prophylaxis= Because of the increased risk of infection, physicians administer oral antibiotics as prophylaxis after a surgical splenectomy, or starting at birth for congenital or functional asplenia. Those with asplenia are also cautioned to start a full-dose course of antibiotics at the first onset of an upper or lower respiratory tract infection (for example, sore throat or cough), or at the onset of any fever. Even with a course of antibiotics and even with a history of relevant vaccination, persons without a functional spleen are at risk for Overwhelming post-splenectomy infection. In an emergency room or hospital setting, appropriate evaluation and treatment for an asplenic febrile patient should include a complete blood count with differential, blood culture with Gram stain, arterial blood gas analysis, chest x-ray, and consideration for lumbar puncture with CSF studies. None of these evaluations should delay the initiation of appropriate broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines state that antibiotics should be administered in a patient suspected of sepsis within 1 hour of presentation. Delay in starting antibiotics for any reason is associated with a poor outcome. =Vaccinations= It is suggested that splenectomized persons receive the following vaccinations, and ideally prior to planned splenectomy surgery: * Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (not before 2 years of age). Children may first need one or more boosters of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine if they did not complete the full childhood series. * Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, especially if not received in childhood. For adults who have not been previously vaccinated, two doses given two months apart was advised in the new 2006 UK vaccination guidelines (in the UK may be given as a combined Hib/MenC vaccine). \\\\- see pages 50-1 and table 7.1 * Meningococcal conjugate vaccine, especially if not received in adolescence. Previously vaccinated adults require a single booster and non-immunised adults advised, in UK since 2006, to have two doses given two months apart. Children too young for the conjugate vaccine should receive meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine in the interim. * Influenza vaccine, every winter, to help prevent getting secondary bacterial infection. =Travel measures= In addition to the normal immunizations advised for the countries to be visited, Group A meningococcus should be included if visiting countries of particular risk (e.g. sub-saharan Africa). The non-conjugated Meningitis A and C vaccines usually used for this purpose give only 3 years coverage and provide less-effective long-term cover for Meningitis C than the conjugated form already mentioned. Those lacking a functional spleen are at higher risk of contracting malaria, and succumbing to its effects. Travel to malarial areas will carry greater risks and is best avoided. Travellers should take the most appropriate anti-malarial prophylaxis medication and be extra vigilant over measures to prevent mosquito bites. The pneumococcal vaccinations may not cover some of the other strains of pneumococcal bacteria present in other countries. Likewise their antibiotic resistance may also vary, requiring a different choice of stand-by antibiotic. =Additional measures= * Surgical and dental procedures - Antibiotic prophylaxis may be required before certain surgical or dental procedures. * Animal bites - adequate antibiotic cover is required after even minor dog or other animal bites. Asplenic patients are particularly susceptible to infection by capnocytophaga canimorsus and should receive a five-day course of amoxicillin/clavulanate (erythromycin in patients allergic to penicillin). * Tick bites - Babesiosis is a rare tickborne infection. Patients should check themselves or have themselves inspected for tick bites if they are in an at- risk situation. Presentation with fever, fatigue, and haemolytic anaemia requires diagnostic confirmation by identifying the parasites within red blood cells on blood film and by specific serology. Quinine (with or without clindamycin) is usually an effective treatment. * Alert warning - People without a working spleen can carry a card, or wear a special bracelet or necklet which says that they do not have a working spleen. This would alert a healthcare professional to take rapid action if they become are seriously ill and cannot notify them of their condition.

In Great Britain, Ireland and Australia, these businesses are termed newsagents. Newsagents typically operate in busy public places like city streets, railway stations and airports. Racks for newspapers and magazines can also be found in convenience stores, bookstores and supermarkets. The physical establishment can be either freestanding or part of a larger structure (e.g. a shopping mall or a railway station). In Canada and the United States, newsstands are often open stalls in public locations such as streets, or in a transit terminal or station (subway, rail, or airport).

Distribution newsagencies Distribution newsagencies offer home delivery of a comprehensive range of newspapers and magazines, These can be quite large and sophisticated businesses. If authorised, they are often fully computerized. They often have a territory, which is partly protected by contracts with most of the Australian Newsagents' Federation recognised publishers/distributors. These recognised publishers/distributors include ACP Publishing, News Limited, Fairfax Publications, Rural Press, The West Australian and Australian Provincial Newspapers. These monopolies have been a major source of contention between newsagents and the Australian Consumer Affairs. =Italy= In Italy, newsagents' shops are known as edicola and are usually family-owned, free-standing kiosks that only deal in periodical publications, stickers, bus tickets and the occasional book and cut-price DVD.

Opening times vary according to the owners' preferences. Many shops are family-owned. These family-owned shops may carry purchasing group or wholesaler group branding such as SPAR, Today's, \\"Local Shop\\" or NISA. Alternatively the private owner choosing to do his own purchasing (usually from cash and carries) may carry advertising for a local paper, national news group or soft drink brand externally. Prior to the banning of advertising of tobacco products, this was the most common form of external advertising. The primary employers association aimed towards looking after the interests of independent newsagents in the UK and Republic of Ireland is the National Federation of Retail Newsagents. Others are part of national chains such as RS McColl/Martins, Co-operative Group and WH Smiths. Mini-marts, off-licences and supermarkets may also act as newsagents. =Greece= In Greece, newsagents' shops are called periptera (singular: periptero) and they sell newspapers and magazines, but also other goods like beverages (including alcoholic ones), snacks, tobacco; and other kinds of merchandise.

Spanish Province of Luisiana from 1762‚Äì1803. Bourbon Street (, ) is a historic street in the heart of the French Quarter of New Orleans. Extending thirteen blocks from Canal Street to Esplanade Avenue, Bourbon Street is famous for its many bars and strip clubs. With 17.74 million visitors in 2017 alone, New Orleans depends on Bourbon Street as a main tourist attraction. Tourist numbers have been growing yearly after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and the city has successfully rebuilt its tourist base. For millions of visitors each year, Bourbon Street provides a rich insight into New Orleans' past. History of Bourbon Street and environs =1700 to 1880= Street name done with tiles in the sidewalk The French claimed Louisiana in the 1690s, and Jean Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville was appointed Director General in charge of developing a colony in the territory. He founded New Orleans in 1718. In 1721, the royal engineer Adrien de Pauger designed the city's street layout. He named the streets after French royal houses and Catholic saints. He paid homage to France's ruling family, the House of Bourbon, with the naming of Bourbon Street.Ashbury, Herbert. The French Quarter: An Informal History of the New Orleans Underworld. Garden City New York: Garden City Publishing Company, 1936. Print. New Orleans was given to the Spanish in 1763 following the Seven Years' War. The Great New Orleans Fire of 1788 destroyed 80 percent of the city's buildings. The Spanish rebuilt many of the damaged structures, which are still standing today. For this reason, Bourbon Street and the French Quarter display more Spanish than French influence. Following a brief restoration of French rule, the Americans gained control of the colony with the 1803 Louisiana Purchase.Primary Documents in American History - Louisiana Purchase They translated the French street names into English, with Rue Bourbon becoming Bourbon Street. During the 19th century, New Orleans was similar to other Southern cities in that its economy was based on selling cash crops, such as sugar and tobacco. By 1840, newcomers whose wealth came from these enterprises turned New Orleans into the third largest metropolis in the country.J. Mark Souther. New Orleans on Parade. Baton Rouge, Louisiana: Louisiana State University Press, 2006. Print The city's port was the nation's second largest, with New York City being the largest. The main difference between New Orleans and other Southern cities was its unique cultural heritage as a result of formerly having been a French and Spanish possession. Promoters emphasized this cultural legacy, in the form of its architecture, cuisine and traditions, to attract tourists to New Orleans. =1880 to 1960= The French Quarter was central to this image of cultural legacy and became the best-known part of the city. Recent arrivals in New Orleans criticized the perceived loose morals of the Creoles, a perception that drew many travelers to New Orleans to drink, gamble and visit the city's brothels, beginning in the 1880s. Bourbon Street was a premier residential area prior to 1900. This changed in the late 1800s and early 1900s, when the Storyville red-light district was constructed on Basin Street adjacent to the French Quarter. The area became known for prostitution, gambling and vaudeville acts. Jazz is said to have developed here, with artists such as King Oliver and Jelly Roll Morton providing musical entertainment at the brothels. This was also the era when some of New Orleans' most famous restaurants were founded, including Galatoire's, located at 209 Bourbon Street. It was established by Jean Galatoire in 1905. Known for years by its characteristic line snaking down Bourbon Street, patrons waited for hours just to get a table ‚Äî especially on Fridays. Before World War II, the French Quarter was emerging as a major asset to the city's economy. While there was an interest in historic districts at the time, developers pressured to modernize the city. Simultaneously, with the wartime influx of people, property owners opened adult-centered nightclubs to capitalize on the city's risqu√© image. Wartime Bourbon Street was memorably depicted in Erle Stanley Gardner‚Äôs detective novel ‚ÄúOwls Don‚Äôt Blink‚Äù. After the war, Bourbon Street became the new Storyville in terms of reputation. By the 1940s and 1950s, nightclubs lined Bourbon Street. Over 50 different burlesque shows, striptease acts and exotic dancers could be found. =1960 to today= Bourbon Street, New Orleans, 2002 There was a move in the 1960s under District Attorney Jim Garrison to clean up Bourbon Street. In August 1962, two months after he was elected, Garrison began raiding adult entertainment establishments on Bourbon. His efforts mirrored those of his predecessors, which had been largely unsuccessful; however, he had more success. He forced closure on a dozen nightclubs convicted of prostitution and selling overpriced alcohol. Following this campaign, Bourbon Street was populated by peep shows and sidewalk beer stands.Savage, James. ‚ÄúBorn on Bourbon Street: Jim Garrison‚Äôs French Quarter Fracas and the Shady Origins of a First Amendment Milestone, 1962-1964.‚Äù Louisiana History: The Journal of the Louisiana Historical Association 49.2 (2008): 133-162 When Mayor Moon Landrieu came into office in 1970, he focused his efforts on stimulating tourism. He did so by making Bourbon Street a pedestrian mall, making it more inviting. The 1980s and 1990s were characterized by a Disneyfication of Bourbon Street. Critics of the rapid increase of souvenir shops and corporate ventures said that Bourbon Street had become Creole Disneyland. They also argued that the street's authenticity had been lost in this process.Gotham, Kevin Fox. \\"Authentic New Orleans: Touristm, Culture, and Race in the Big Easy.\\" New York: New York University Press, 2007. Print On April 5, 2018 a giant saxophone, nearly high, was inaugurated in the street. It was offered by the city of Namur (Belgium) to recall that the inventor of the instrument Adolphe Sax is from the region of Namur, specifically Dinant. =Impact of Hurricane Katrina= Given Bourbon Street's high-ground location in the French Quarter, it was mostly intact following 2005's Hurricane Katrina. A major tourist attraction, Bourbon Street renovation was given high priority after the storm. However, New Orleans was still experiencing a lack of visitors. In 2004, the year before Katrina, the city had 10.1 million visitors. The year after the storm, that number was 3.7 million. One third of the city's operating budget, approximately $6 billion before Katrina, came from visitors and conventions, so officials saw tourism as vital for post-disaster economic recovery. The New Orleans Tourism Marketing Corporation initiated efforts to draw visitors back to the city, featuring celebrities such as Emeril Lagasse and Patricia Clarkson with the slogan, \\"Come fall In love with Louisiana all over again.\\" Travelers heard mixed messages in the media. Advertising campaigns gave the impression that New Orleans was thriving, while city leaders asked for increased Federal financial assistance and National Guard troops to help control municipal crime waves. New Orleans has been working its way back to pre-Katrina tourist numbers, as it attracted 9.5 million visitors in 2014 and 10.5 million visitors in 2016. The 2016 record was the highest since 2004. For a time in April 2017, the 100 block of Bourbon Street was closed off for reconstruction of the street and its underground utilities as part of the city's $6 million French Quarter infrastructure project. Entertainment, bars, and restaurants Looking northeast from Iberville Street in 2015 Largely quiet during the day, Bourbon Street comes alive at night - particularly during the French Quarter's many festivals. Most famous of these is the annual Mardi Gras celebration, when the streets teem with thousands of people. Local open container laws allow drinking alcoholic beverages on the Quarter's streets. Popular drinks include the hurricane cocktail, the resurrection cocktail, the hand grenade and the so-called \\"huge-ass beers\\" - a large plastic cup of draft beer marketed to tourists at a low price. The most heavily visited section of Bourbon Street is \\"upper Bourbon Street\\" toward Canal Street, an eight-block section of visitor attractions including bars, restaurants, souvenir shops and strip clubs. In the 21st century, Bourbon Street is the home of New Orleans Musical Legends Park, a free, outdoor venue for live jazz performances. The park has sculptures and other tributes to the city's legendary music personalities. Most of the bars are located in the central section of Bourbon. Popular spots include Pat O'Brien's, Johnny White's, the Famous Door, Spirits on Bourbon, Channing Tatum's Saints and Sinners, Razzoo and The Cat's Meow. Marie Laveau's House of Voodoo is located on the corner of St. Ann Street. The most renowned restaurant on Bourbon Street is Galatoire's; it represents traditional New Orleans dining and has a dress code. Lafitte's Blacksmith Shop and the Old Absinthe House are two of the many casual eateries. Also notable is the locals‚Äô hangout, the Bourbon House. \\"Lower Bourbon Street\\" (lower being a reference to downriver, or downstream Mississippi River), from the intersection of St. Ann Street, caters to New Orleans' thriving gay community. Featuring such establishments as Oz and the city's largest gay nightclub, the Bourbon Pub, St. Ann Street has been referred to as \\"the Velvet Line\\" or \\"the Lavender Line,\\" the edge or approximate boundary of the French Quarter's gay community. Cafe-Lafitte-in-Exile is the oldest gay bar in the nation. The intersection of Bourbon and St. Ann Streets is also the center of the Labor Day weekend event Southern Decadence, commonly referred to as the Gay Mardi Gras, which attracts upwards of 100,000 participants. Legal issues Historically, noise violations were the responsibility of the individual making the noise.Palermo, Gina. ‚ÄúWaking the Neighbors: Determining a Landowner‚Äôs Liability for Rowdy Tenants Under Louisiana Law.‚Äù Louisiana Law Review 70: 1339 This changed in 1996 with Yokum v. 615 Bourbon Street, which ruled that the property owner, not the noise-maker, is responsible for noise violations. A 2010 city ordinance states that no music may be played in the French Quarter between 8 pm and 9 am. Enforcement has been inconsistent, and critics claim its goals are vague. Some even say that the local law is unconstitutional. Besides being difficult to enforce, music enthusiasts claim that noise ordinances threaten the city's notable music culture. Local jazz bands who play in the streets, such as the To Be Continued Brass Band, would be prohibited from doing so under such ordinances. \\"Aggressive solicitation\\" bans are a more recent issue on Bourbon Street. In 2011, an ordinance was passed which prohibited individuals and groups from \\"disseminating any social, political or religious message\\" at night. The ordinance did not explain the justification for the rule. On September 21, 2012, the ACLU of Louisiana won a temporary restraining order against the ban, on behalf of Kelsey McCauley (Bohn), a woman who converted to Christianity through a religious group's activities on Bourbon Street. The group had several of its members arrested, some of whom were cited on September 14, 2012, for violating the anti- solicitation ordinance. A hearing was set for October 1, 2012. On July 25, 2013, the New Orleans City Council voted 6-0 to amend the law and exempt Bourbon Street from the ban, with legal language found acceptable by the participating attorneys.

The infections are typically characterized by either meningitis or sepsis, and are caused by encapsulated organisms including Streptococcus pneumoniae. Another source of infection are varieties of babesia, which are tick-borne parasites that cause babesiosis. Capnocytophaga canimorsus can trigger infection after dog bites. Mechanism The spleen contains many macrophages (part of the reticuloendothelial system), which are immune cells that phagocytose (eat) and destroy bacteria. In particular, these macrophages are activated when bacteria are bound by IgG antibodies (IgG1 or IgG3) or the complement component C3b. These types of antibodies and complement are immune substances called opsonizers, molecules that bind to the surface of bacteria to facilitate phagocytosis. When the spleen is no longer present (asplenia), IgG and C3b are still bound to bacteria, but they cannot be removed from the blood circulation due to the loss of the splenic macrophages. Hence the bacteria are free to cause infection. Patients without a spleen often need immunizations against pathogens that normally require opsonization and phagocytosis by macrophages in the spleen. These include common human pathogens with bacterial capsules (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Neisseria meningitidis, E. coli, Hemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ). Capsules made of polysaccharides (sugars) permit bacteria to evade phagocytosis by macrophages alone, since only proteins are directly recognized by macrophages in phagocytosis. So humoral immunity in forms of IgG and complement proteins is the human immune system's response against bacterial capsules. =Vaccination= The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's annual vaccine recommendations includes specifics for individuals without a functioning spleen. The CDC recommends against live vaccines and has specific advice for travelers, which includes malaria avoidance for asplenic individuals. Prognosis The risk of OPSI is 0.23-0.42 percent per year, with a lifetime risk of 5 percent. Most infections occur in the first few years following splenectomy, but the risk of OPSI is lifelong. OPSI is almost always fatal without treatment, and modern treatment has decreased the mortality to approximately 40-70 percent. Individuals with OPSI are most commonly treated with antibiotics and supportive care. Measures to prevent OPSI include vaccination and prophylactic antibiotics.

Scrapping was completed in 2000. It was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the aspro, a fish of the Zingel genus found abundantly in the upper Rhone River. Construction and commissioning The contract to build Aspro was awarded to Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi, on 26 March 1963 and her keel was laid down there on 23 November 1964. She was launched on 29 November 1967, sponsored by Mrs. Robert H. B. Baldwin, and commissioned on 20 February 1969 with Commander Roy Wight in command. Service history =1969= Aspro departed Pascagoula on 26 February 1969 for Key West, Florida, where she loaded torpedoes. She then headed to her home port, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, transiting the Panama Canal on 8 March 1969, and arriving at Oahu in the Hawaiian Islands on 24 March 1969. She joined the United States Pacific Fleet as a member of Submarine Squadron 1 in Submarine Division 12. Following three weeks of upkeep at Pearl Harbor, she proceeded to Bangor, Washington, where she unloaded her torpedoes before entering the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard at Bremerton, Washington, on 23 April 1969 for alignment of her fire-control system. Leaving drydock on 4 May 1969, she held tests along the United States West Coast for one month before returning to Pearl Harbor on 8 June 1969. Local operations occupied Aspros time during the month of July 1969. In August 1969, she served as a school ship for prospective commanding officers and took part in two exercises, \\"Kilo 5‚Äì69\\" and \\"Holdex 4‚Äì69\\", carried out in the Hawaiian operating area. Weapons tests and a nuclear reactor safety examination preceded her entry into the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard that autumn for post-shakedown repairs. =1970= Aspro got underway again on 6 March 1970 to conduct sea trials around Hawaii, followed by weapons trials during April. From 18 May through 12 June 1970, upkeep at the Submarine Base Pearl Harbor occupied her time. She then began to prepare for a deployment. On 19 July 1970, Aspro departed Pearl Harbor for a six-month Western Pacific deployment. She arrived in Yokosuka, Japan, on 10 September 1970 and commenced upkeep. On 29 September 1970, she visited Okinawa and, the next day, began more than a month of United States Seventh Fleet operations. She returned to Okinawa on 8 November 1970 and shifted to Subic Bay in the Philippines on 15 November for two weeks of upkeep. She sailed to Hong Kong late in November, providing services to aircraft along the way, and arrived at Hong Kong on 1 December 1970 for a week of leave and liberty. After an antisubmarine warfare exercise between 8 and 17 December 1970, she operated on \\"Yankee Station\\" in the Gulf of Tonkin in support of Vietnam War operations before returning to Subic Bay on 31 December 1970. =1971= Aspro left the Philippines on 2 January 1971 bound for Guam, where she spent several weeks engaged in tests before returning to Pearl Harbor on 5 February 1971. She spent the remainder of 1971 in Hawaii, alternating periods in port with exercises in the Hawaiian operating area. =1972= On 5 January 1972, Aspro commenced a restricted shipyard availability for alterations and repairs at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, which was followed by another month in upkeep. On 11 March 1972, she resumed operations in Hawaiian waters and, on 15 April, began preparations to deploy. Aspro got underway for her second Western Pacific deployment on 13 May 1972 and arrived at Yokosuka on 24 June. After a week in port, she departed on 4 July 1972 to begin Seventh Fleet operations. She arrived at Pusan, South Korea, on 13 August 1972 for a two-day visit, then shifted to Sasebo, Japan, for three days. Following an exercise with one of her sister ships, the attack submarine , from 18 to 26 August, Aspro arrived at Hong Kong on 27 August 1972. On 2 September, she was underway for Guam, where she arrived on 7 September and began two weeks of upkeep. On 21 September, she put to sea to return to Pearl Harbor, arriving there on 18 November 1972. She remained in port there through the end of 1972. =1973‚Äì1974= Aspro operated in the Hawaiian area conducting tests until she left Pearl Harbor on 17 March 1973 bound for Pascagoula. She transited the Panama Canal on 28 March 1973 and commenced an overhaul at the Ingalls Shipbuilding Corporation's yards in Pascagoula on 1 April 1973. The shipyard work ended on 12 May 1974, and Aspro departed Pascagoula the next day. After re-transiting the Panama Canal, she made liberty stops at San Diego, California, and Bremerton, then held acoustic trials in Puget Sound from 4 to 7 June 1974. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 19 June after an absence of more than 15 months and spent the rest of 1974 conducting operations in the Hawaiian Islands. =1975= The beginning of 1975 found Aspro preparing for her third deployment to the Western Pacific. After loading weapons, she left Pearl Harbor on 29 May 1975, conducted an exercise with the destroyer escort the next day, and reached Yokosuka on 10 June 1975 for a weeks visit. On 19 June, she began operations at sea that lasted until 10 August 1975 when she arrived at Guam. She participated in exercises with units of the Seventh Fleet from 24 August to 3 September 1975, made voyage repairs at Subic Bay from 4 to 16 September, and carried out exercises near Subic Bay with the attack aircraft carrier between 17 and 29 September 1975. Aspro left the Philippines on 1 October 1975, bound for the Mariana Islands. She arrived at Guam in the Marianas on 5 October and remained there until 27 October to replace the battery with the assistance of the submarine tender. She then departed for Hong Kong. From 6 to 18 November 1975, she took part in antisubmarine warfare exercises with Seventh Fleet air and surface units. After pausing briefly at Guam, she returned to Pearl Harbor on 4 December 1975 and commenced a post- deployment stand down to allow her crew to rest and recuperate. =1976‚Äì1978= Aspro spent the first two and one-half months of 1976 in upkeep and on exercises. On 15 March 1976, she entered drydock at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. Upon completion of this work on 23 April 1976, she began sea trials, exercises, and final preparations for a tour of duty along the west coast of North America. Aspro left Pearl Harbor on 6 September 1976 and stopped at Esquimalt, British Columbia, Canada, on 16 September for a two- day liberty call. She arrived at Bangor on 23 September 1976 to unload her weapons. Aspro commenced an overhaul on 11 October 1977. =1979= Aspros overhaul was completed on 11 March 1979, when she got underway for sea and acoustic trials. On 28 April, she went to Bangor for weapons trials. She departed Bangor on 17 May 1979 and made a voyage to San Diego, conducting deep-water acoustic trials en route. Upon her arrival in San Diego on 22 May, she spent one week undergoing repairs by auxiliary repair dock . Aspro returned to Pearl Harbor on 8 June 1979 after an absence of 21 months and spent the remainder of 1979 conducting training exercises and antisubmarine warfare operations and preparing for a deployment in 1980. =1980= Aspros pre-deployment preparations continued well into February 1980. She departed Pearl Harbor to begin her fourth Western Pacific deployment on 24 February 1980 and arrived in Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on 9 March. On 11 March, she put to sea to take part in Exercise \\"SHAREM 35.\\" She returned briefly to Buckner Bay on 16 March then set out for the Philippines. She entered Subic Bay on 20 March 1980 and remained there until 6 April; when she got underway for Guamn in the Mariana Islands. Aspro stayed at Guam from 12 to 24 April 1980, then departed for Japan. She made a brief stop at Yokosuka on 4 May 1980 before embarking upon a month of operations at sea. She returned to Yokosuka on 10 June 1980 but put to sea again on 12 June on her way to Hong Kong for a liberty call there that lasted from 17 to 21 June. Aspro then headed back to Guam, where arrived on 27 June. She put back to sea on 16 July 1980 for her last operational assignment of the deployment. She concluded both that operation and the overall deployment by returning to Pearl Harbor on 30 August 1980. Following the usual post-deployment stand-down period, Aspro resumed local operations in the Hawaiian Islands for the remainder of 1980. =1981= At the beginning of 1981, Aspro began a restricted shipyard availability for repairs and alterations at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard that lasted until late in March 1981. On 26 March, she left the shipyard and resumed normal operations out of Pearl Harbor until midsummer 1981, when she began getting ready for another tour of duty in the Western Pacific. Aspro stood out of Pearl Harbor to commence her fifth Western Pacific deployment on 2 September 1981. During the deployment, she visited a variety of ports in the Western Pacific and in the Indian Ocean. including a R&R; port call to HMAS Stirling, Rockingham, Western Australia from 30 November - 7 December 1981, the only time Aspro would visit Western Australia. Aspro successfully prosecuted all her operational missions. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 16 March 1982 and commenced the normal month of post-deployment leave and upkeep. =1982= Aspro resumed operations out of Pearl Harbor in April 1982. She participated in the multinational exercise Operation \\"RIMPAC 82\\" and served as a training platform for both prospective commanding officers and midshipmen. Early in July 1982, she embarked upon a five-week cruise that took her to the California coast and back, during which she participated in antisubmarine exercises and in the fleet exercise FLEETEX 1‚Äì82. Aspro returned to Pearl Harbor on 12 August 1982 and began preparations for a cold-weather deployment. On 15 October 1982, Aspro and one of her sister ships, the attack submarine , got underway for the Arctic. In addition to cold-weather drills, the two submarines gathered scientific data. They also made a winter rendezvous at the North Pole on 20 November 1982, celebrated by the mailing of cachet envelopes prepared especially for the occasion. Aspro returned to Pearl Harbor on 15 December 1982 and began a period of stand-down and upkeep. =1983‚Äì1984= In February 1983, Aspro resumed duty in the Hawaiian operating area, which continued through May. In June 1983, Aspro began preparations for her sixth tour of duty with the Seventh Fleet in the Western Pacific. Aspro departed Pearl Harbor in July 1983 for the deployment, which was highlighted by visits to many of the exotic ports of East Asia and successful completion of all assigned missions. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 23 October 1983 and, after the post-deployment stand-down, took up local operations. That duty continued into the beginning of 1984. On 16 January 1984, Aspro entered the medium auxiliary floating drydock for a restricted availability for repairs and alterations. Later, she resumed operations at sea. On 24 July 1984, Aspro began her seventh deployment to the Western Pacific. Operating both in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, Aspro carried her assignments to successful conclusions and made a number of port calls. =1985‚Äì1986= Aspro returned to Pearl Harbor from her deployment in January 1985 and, following the usual leave and upkeep period, embarked upon local operations in the Hawaiian Islands once more. In April 1985, she visited the United States West Coast again. That summer, she voyaged to the Arctic for more cold-weather drills. She returned to Hawaii at the end of September and resumed local operations in October, which she continued through April 1986. In May 1986, Aspro headed north for another round of cold-weather exercises in the Arctic. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 11 July 1986 and remained in the Hawaiian Islands until early September 1986, when she cruised to the Northern Pacific Ocean. Aspro concluded that voyage on 27 October 1986 at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard at Vallejo, California, where she began a regular overhaul on 15 November 1986. =1987‚Äì1994= USS Aspro's patch from around 1993. Aspro spent a significantly longer time at Mare Island Naval Shipyard than originally scheduled. During her overhaul, new sonar and fire-control system technologies became available and were installed during the delay. The delay also allowed Aspro to have anechoic (acoustic) tiling installed on her hull, making her one of the quietest attack submarines in the United States Pacific Fleet. At the conclusion of her overhaul, Aspro and her crew scored an EXCELLENT on the Post-Overhaul Reactor Safeguards Examination (PORSE), a rare feat for any nuclear-powered ship. She followed up this extraordinary achievement with outstanding performances on Tactical Readiness Examinations against much newer ships. Aspro returned to Pearl Harbor in October 1989. As she rounded the bend into the submarine base, the other moored submarines, led by her sister ship , sounded their whistles for over four minutes, welcoming Aspro back to her home port. After her return, Aspro deployed twice to the Western Pacific and twice to the Northern Pacific. She won the Battle Efficiency Award (Battle \\"E\\") for Submarine Squadron 1 three times in the next four years, twice under CDR J. A. \\"Andy\\" Borchardt and once under CDR J. M. \\"Mike\\" Willy. ASPRO was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation for performance during a period in 1994 while deployed to the Western Pacific. During her final WESTPAC cruise, she made port calls in Hong Kong, Guam, Sasebo Japan, and New Caledonia, with CDR Willy in command. USS ASPRO had her decommissioning ceremony at Naval Base Pearl Harbor in early 1995 upon return from her final cruise, and completed the formal decommissioning process at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard in 1995, with CDR Keith Sauls in command for the decommissioning process. Decommissioning and disposal Aspro was formally decommissioned on 31 March 1995 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day, although her decommissioning ceremony was not held until 2 April 1995. Her scrapping via the Nuclear- Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard at Bremerton began on 1 October 1999 and was completed on 3 November 2000.

He was the reformist chief minister of King Charles III of Spain, and also served briefly under Charles IV. He was arguably Spain's most effective statesman in the eighteenth century. In Spain, he is simply known as Conde de Floridablanca. Early life He was born at Murcia in 1728 as the son of a retired army officer. He studied in Murcia and Orihuela, and later law at the University of Salamanca and was an esteemed advocate in the Spanish courts. He became a criminal prosecutor in Castile in 1766. He was given the task of investigating the Esquilache riots that same year and acquired a reputation as a supporter of the king's reformist policies. He defended the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1767. The chief minister at the time, the Marquis of Esquilache, recognized his ability and made Mo√±ino Spanish ambassador to Pope Clement XIV in 1772. He was rewarded with the title \\"Count of Floridablanca\\" in 1773 for succeeding in obtaining the support of the Pope in suppressing the Jesuits. Francisco Mo√±ino, younger brother of the Count of Floridablanca, was the ambassador in the Republic of Venice and Lisbon Chief minister Floridablanca was named chief minister in 1777. He embarked on a thorough reform of the Spanish bureaucracy, establishing a true cabinet in 1787 (the Supreme Council of State). He established commercial freedom in the American colonies in 1778, founded the National Bank of San Carlos in 1782. He involved himself in university reform (Spain's universities had become increasingly lax since the 16th century) and improved press liberties. After the expulsion of the Jesuits, Spain's higher education system was left woefully understaffed; Floridablanca worked to hire new teachers and administrators and to modernize pedagogical methods. He also established new schools throughout Spain. During his tenure, Madrid was rebuilt; a great deal of the city dates from this period. Floridablanca regulated the Madrid police and encouraged public works in the city. =American War of Independence= As master of Spain's foreign policy, Floridablanca sought prominently to restore the economic well-being of Spain. He concluded trade agreements with Morocco and the Ottoman Empire and believed that good relations with Great Britain were key to Spain's growth. In spite of this, he was drawn reluctantly into the American War of Independence on the side of France and the American rebels. The war generally went well for Spain and Floridablanca succeeded in restoring much of Spain's prestige during the conflict and in 1782 Britain returned the island of Menorca, in the Baleares, and Florida to Spain. However attempts to capture Gibraltar, Jamaica and invade Britain met with failure. During the war Spain negotiated for a separate peace with Britain, in spite of its alliance with France. Talks were held between Richard Cumberland and Thomas Hussey. These discussions ultimately fell through, and Spain was a signatory of the Peace of Paris in 1783. Long-standing disputes with Portugal over the American colonies were resolved under Floridablanca's ministry and in the process Fernando P√≥, Annob√≥n, and R√≠o Muni (modern Equatorial Guinea) were acquired from Portugal. Floridablanca strove to carve out an independent foreign policy for Spain, distancing the country from France which Spain had been a virtual satellite of since the War of the Spanish Succession. Jos√© Mo√±ino, 1st Count de Floridablanca, painted by Goya =French Revolution= With the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789 the liberal movement in Spain - which, in his own way, Floridablanca personified - was shocked to a halt. Floridablanca was forced to react to the situation and supported the First Coalition against revolutionary France. The events in France discredited the reformers at court and contributed to their downfall in the following years. Later life His centralist policies brought him into conflict with regional interests and he was often at odds with the Aragonese faction at court which enjoyed many traditional liberties from the central government. The Aragonese faction, supported by the queen's lover Manuel de Godoy and the Count of Aranda, finally succeeded in ousting Floridablanca from power in 1792 on charges of embezzlement. Floridablanca was imprisoned at the castle of Pamplona for three years and only released after the intervention of his brother. He was acquitted in 1795, although the ordeal weighed heavily upon him and he retired to seclusion on his estates. When Napoleon marched against Spain in 1808, there was a public outcry for Floridablanca to lead the country in resistance. He accepted the call and became the President of the Supreme Central and Governmental Junta but, at the age of eighty, his strength failed him and he died at Seville on November 20 that year. Although an avid statesman, he left few writings, and only a few short treatises by his hand on jurisprudence were published during his lifetime. Plant genus Monnina was named after him.

It was developed around 1946 by RCA engineers in Camden, New Jersey, under developmental number A-4522. It was released for public sale under the 12AX7 identifier on September 15, 1947. The 12AX7 was originally intended as replacement for the 6SL7 family of dual-triode amplifier tubes for audio applications. As a popular choice for guitar tube amplifiers, its ongoing use in such equipment makes it one of the few small-signal vacuum tubes in continuous production since it was introduced.  History  The 12AX7 is a twin triode basically composed of two of the triodes from a 6AV6, a double diode triode. The 6AV6 is a miniature repackaging (with just a single cathode) of the triode and twin diodes from the octal 6SQ7 (a double-diode triode used in AM radios), which itself is very similar to the older type 75 triode-diode dating from 1930. the 12AX7 was made in various versions by one factory in Russia (New Sensor, which produces tubes under the Sovtek, Electro- Harmonix, Svetlana, Tung-Sol, Mullard, and other brands for which the firm has acquired trademark rights), at least two in China (Shuguang and Quanzhen Electron Tube Technology (sold as TJ FullMusichttp://www.tube- fullmusic.com/products/en/12AX7_en.htm), and one in Slovakia (JJ Electronic), for a total annual production estimated at two million units. The vast majority are used in new-production guitar amplifiers or for replacements in guitar and audio equipment.  Application  The 12AX7 is a high-gain (typical amplification factor 100), low-plate-current triode best suited for low-level audio voltage amplification. In this role it is widely used for the preamplifier (input and mid-level) stages of audio amplifiers. It has relatively high Miller capacitance, making it unsuitable for radio-frequency use. Typically a 12AX7 triode is configured with a high-value plate resistor, 100k ohms in most guitar amps and 220k ohms or more in high-fidelity equipment. Grid bias is most often provided by a cathode resistor. If the cathode resistor is unbypassed, negative feedback is introduced and each half of a 12AX7 provides a typical voltage gain of about 30; the amplification factor is basically twice the maximum stage gain, as the plate impedance must be matched. Thus half the voltage is across the tube at rest, half across the load resistor. The cathode resistor can be bypassed to reduce or eliminate AC negative feedback and thereby increase gain; maximum gain is about 60 times with a 100k plate load, and a center biased and bypassed cathode, and higher with a larger plate load. https://www.ampbooks.com/mobile/amplifier- calculators/output-impedance/calculator/ A_v = Œº * Rtot / ( rP + Rtot + ( RK * ( Œº + 1 ))) Where A_v = voltage gain, Œº is the amplification factor of the valve, rP is the internal plate resistance, RK is the cathode resistor and Rtot is the parallel combination of RP (external plate resistor) and Rload. If the cathode resistor is bypassed, use RK = 0. The initial \\"12\\" in the designator implies a 12-volt heater requirement; however, the tube has a center-tapped heater so it can be used in either 6.3V or 12.6V heater circuits, and in most current (as of 2018) applications is used in 6.3V circuits.  Characteristics  File:TriodeECC83Characteristic1.pngAnode current characteristic with grid voltage as parameter  Similar twin-triode designs  The 12AX7 is the most common member of what eventually became a large family of twin-triode vacuum tubes, manufactured all over the world, all sharing the same pinout (EIA 9A). Most use heaters which can be optionally wired in series (12.6V, 150 mA) or parallel (6.3V, 300 mA). Other tubes, which in some cases can be used interchangeably in an emergency, include the 12AT7, 12AU7, 12AV7, 12AY7, and the low-voltage 12U7, plus many four-digit EIA series dual triodes. They span a wide range of voltage gain and transconductance. Different versions of each were designed for enhanced ruggedness, low microphonics, stability, lifespan, etc. Those other designs offer lower voltage gain (traded off for higher plate current) than the 12AX7 (which has a voltage gain or A_v of 100), and are more suitable for high-frequency applications. Some American designs similar to the 12AX7: * 12AD7 (October 10, 1955 - 225mA heater - low hum) * 12AT7 (May 20, 1947, dual 6AB4, A_v = 60) * 12AU7 (October 18, 1946, dual 6C4,http://www.thetubestore.com/Tubes/6C4-M8080-Tube-Types A_v = 17-20) * 12AV7 (February 14, 1950 - dual 6BC4, A_v = 37-41) * 12AX7 (September 15, 1947 - dual 6DR4, also like octal 6SL7, A_v = 100) dual 12AV6 (6AV6) * 12AY7 (December 7, 1948 - A_v = 44, for audio preamp use)http://www.thetubestore.com/Tubes/12AY7-6072-Tube-Types * 12AZ7 (March 2, 1951 - 225mA heater, A_v = 60) * 12DF7 (A_v = 100, low microphonics) * 12DT7 (A_v = 100) * 12DW7 http://www.thetubestore.com/Tubes/12DW7-7247-Tube- Types(First triode: A_v = 100, Second triode: A_v = 17) * 12U7 (A_v = 20, for use in automotive radios on 12-volt plate supply) Although commonly known in Europe by its Mullard‚ÄìPhilips tube designation of ECC83, other European variations also exist including the low-noise versions 12AX7A, 12AD7, 6681, 7025, and 7729; European versions B339, B759, CV492, CV4004, CV8156, CV8222, ECC803, ECC803S, E2164, and M8137; and the lower-gain low-noise versions 5751 and 6851, intended for avionics equipment. In European usage special-quality valves of some sort were often indicated by exchanging letters and digits in the name: the E83CC was a special-quality ECC83. In the US a \\"W\\" in the designation, as in 12AX7WA, designates the tube as complying with military grade, higher reliability specifications. The 'E' in the European designation classifies this as having a 6.3 volt heater, whereas the American designation of 12AX7 classifies it as having a 12.6 volt heater. It can, of course, be wired for operation off either voltage.  12AX7 / ECC83 from various manufacturers  File:Electro-harmonix 12AX7EH.JPGElectro-Harmonix 12AX7EH File:ECC83 var.jpgVarious brands of 12AX7, with measuring tape to indicate size File:Dubulttriode darbiibaa.jpgTungsram ECC83 during operation File:Philips 12AX7WA tube.jpgPhilips JAN 12AX7WA See also * List of vacuum tubes  References   External links  * Duncan's Amps TDSL. * Several tube datasheets. * Reviews of 12ax7 tubes. * The 12AX7 tube.

It is located near the geographical center of the island, at the junction of Richmond Road and Arthur Kill Road.http://www.historicrichmondtown.org Staten Island Historical Society and Historic Richmond Town are two different names for the same organization, reflecting its long history and evolution. The original settlement of Richmond Town was known as not trustworthy in the 1690's due to an abundance of oyster shells. The town was later named Richmond Town in the early 18th century when it was formerly a county seat and commercial center, having contained the former courthouse of Richmond County, and is coterminous with the borough of Staten Island. People who lived in Richmond Town were mostly of Dutch, English, or French descent, and the most common jobs were those of blacksmiths, shoemakers, and other craftsman types. British troops were stationed in Richmond Town during the American Revolution. Historic Richmond Town consists of more than 30 historic buildings and sites dating from the late 17th to the early 20th centuries. Decker Farm, located about one mile from the center of Historic Richmond Town, features a farm stand and seasonal activities such as pumpkin picking. The site also contains other former commercial and government buildings, as well as farm buildings and homes, some of which were relocated from other parts of Staten Island. History The original New Dorp station building of the Staten Island Railway, which was also relocated from New Dorp. The creation of the museum site at Historic Richmond Town was the result of efforts by many Staten Islanders, led by local historians and preservationists: Loring McMillen, William T. Davis and local banker David L. Decker. Fueled by the same depression-era passion for historic preservation which resulted in the creation of Colonial Williamsburg, these men wanted to create a testament to Staten Island's rich history in an era of rapid development and urban sprawl. Established in 1958, Historic Richmond Town is a joint project of the Staten Island Historical Society, an independent nonprofit cultural organization, and the City of New York, which owns the land and the buildings and supports part of its operations with public funds from the Department of Cultural Affairs. On June 30, 2020 the Board of the Staten Island Historical Society elected Laura Gentile as board director and president, selecting a woman to lead the organization for the second time in its 164 year history. The previous woman was Edna Hayes, who served as president from 1978 to 1989. Current setting The main campus of Historic Richmond Town occupies of a site with 15 restored buildings, offering the opportunity to experience the lifestyle of a 300-year-old community. The two churches located outside the museum site are St. Andrew's Episcopal and St. Patrick's RC. A third church, the Reformed Dutch Church of Richmond, was demolished. Mount Richmond Cemetery, operated by the Hebrew Free Burial Association, is also adjacent to the site. Exhibits The purpose of this museum village is to make visitors feel as if they are living in the 19th century. Visitors are able to have a first-hand experience of what Historic Richmond Town once was. Visitors may take a guided tour of various homes and shops that are fully furnished and restored to specific periods of interpretation; other buildings are in the process of being restored and are not yet open to the public. While Historic Richmond Town is no longer a year- round living history museum (as it was briefly in the 1980s), demonstrations of historic trades, crafts, and basic household activities by costumed museum interpreters take place during certain special events throughout the year and on a regular basis by reservation for visiting school groups. Special events that are open to the public include the Richmond County Fair, quilting classes, Tavern Concerts, Pumpkin Picking at Decker Farm (October), English Country Dancing, Old Home Day, Candlelight Tours, Traditional Dinners, and the Summer Apprenticeship Program. The Voorlezer's House, dating to c. 1695, is the oldest exhibit as well as the oldest standing elementary school in the United States. Another exhibit to see is the Guyon-Lake-Tysen House, a Dutch Colonial farmhouse dating to c. 1740. The Christopher House, a restoration-in- progress which dates to c. 1720, features the only functioning jambless fireplace in New York City. Among the many structures are outstanding examples of Dutch Colonial and Greek revival architecture, such as The Stephens-Black House, the John Bennett House, The Britton Cottage, the Crocheron House, the Boehm House, the Basket Maker's House and the Treasure House. In 1987, The society purchased and relocated The Jacob Crocheron farmhouse (built ca. 1819-1820) to Historic Richmond Town from its original location at 84 Woodrow Road in the Annadale section of Staten Island, a distance of over 3.1 miles. In the process of moving the building, DOT issued the house seven traffic tickets that were later forgiven. The Diner film set, located on Center Street. In popular culture Historic Richmond Town is featured prominently in the documentary A Walk Around Staten Island with David Hartman and Barry Lewis, which profiles the history and culture of Staten Island. It premiered on December 3, 2007, on PBS member station WNET. Richmond Town was featured in the third season of the television series Boardwalk Empire. A 1920s diner and gas station were constructed and shot on location. These sets were shown in the shows third season, which aired in fall of 2012 on HBO. Historic Richmond Town was also featured as a haunted location on the paranormal TV series Most Terrifying Places which aired on the Travel Channel in 2019.https://www.travelchannel.com/shows/most-terrifying-places Access Richmond Town is served by the buses.

It is a sum of claims by all claimants: creditors (secured and unsecured) and shareholders (preferred and common). Enterprise value is one of the fundamental metrics used in business valuation, financial modeling, accounting, portfolio analysis, and risk analysis. Enterprise value is more comprehensive than market capitalization, which only reflects common equity.Definition of 'Enterprise Value - EV' Importantly, EV reflects the opportunistic nature of business and may change substantially over time because of both external and internal conditions. Therefore, financial analysts often use a comfortable range of EV in their calculations. EV equation For detailed information on the valuation process see Valuation (finance). : Enterprise value = :: common equity at market value (this line item is also known as \\"market cap\\") :: + debt at market value (here debt refers to interest-bearing liabilities, both long-term and short-term) :: + minority interest at market value, if any :: + preferred equity at market value :: + unfunded pension liabilities and other debt-deemed provisions :: ‚Äì value of associate companies :: ‚Äì cash and cash equivalents. Understanding A simplified way to understand the EV concept is to envision purchasing an entire business. If you settle with all the security holders, you pay EV. Counter-intuitively, increases or decreases in enterprise value do not necessarily correspond to \\"value creation\\" or \\"value destruction\\". Any acquisition of assets (whether paid for in cash or through share issues) will increase EV, whether or not those assets are productive. Similarly, reductions in capital intensity (for example by reducing working capital) will reduce EV. EV can be negative if the company, for example, holds abnormally high amounts of cash that is not reflected in the market value of the stock and total capitalization.Cheapest Stocks Since 1995 Show Cash Exceeds Market (Update5) All the components are relevant in liquidation analysis, since using absolute priority in a bankruptcy all securities senior to the equity have par claims. Generally, also, debt is less liquid than equity, so the \\"market price\\" may be significantly different from the price at which an entire debt issue could be purchased. In valuing equities, this approach is more conservative than using the \\"market price\\". Cash is subtracted because it reduces the net cost to a potential purchaser. The effect applies whether the cash is used to issue dividends or to pay down debt. Value of minority interest is added because it reflects the claim on assets consolidated into the firm in question. Value of associate companies is subtracted because it reflects the claim on assets consolidated into other firms. EV should also include such special components as unfunded pension liabilities, employee stock options, environmental provisions, abandonment provisions, and so on, since they also reflect claims on the company. It can be demonstrated that enterprise value depends on the probability of default (the rating) and works as a \\"negative growth rate\\" in the future. Enterprise value is only a useful measure of success or a useful measure of performance, when, apart from the rating, the earnings risks of the company are accounted for (for example by using the discount interest rate). Usage *Because EV is a capital structure-neutral metric, it is useful when comparing companies with diverse capital structures. Price/earnings ratios, for example, will be significantly more volatile in companies that are highly leveraged. *Stock market investors use EV/EBITDA to compare returns between equivalent companies on a risk-adjusted basis. They can then superimpose their own choice of debt levels. In practice, equity investors may have difficulty accurately assessing EV if they do not have access to the market quotations of the company debt. It is not sufficient to substitute the book value of the debt because a) the market interest rates may have changed, and b) the market's perception of the risk of the loan may have changed since the debt was issued. Remember, the point of EV is to neutralize the different risks, and costs of different capital structures. *Buyers of controlling interests in a business use EV to compare returns between businesses, as above. They also use the EV valuation (or a debt free cash free valuation) to determine how much to pay for the whole entity (not just the equity) since the change of control may require debt repayment. They may also want to change the capital structure once in control. Technical considerations =Data availability= Unlike market capitalization, where both the market price and the outstanding number of shares in issue are readily available and easy to find, it is virtually impossible to calculate an EV without making a number of adjustments to published data, including often subjective estimations of value: * The vast majority of corporate debt is not publicly traded. Most corporate debt is in the form of bank financing, finance leases and other forms of debt for which there is no market price. * Associates and minority interests are stated at historical book values in the accounts, which may be very different from their market values. * Unfunded pension liabilities rely on a variety of actuarial assumptions and represent an estimate of the outstanding liability, not a true ‚Äúmarket‚Äù value. * Public data for certain key inputs of EV, such as cash balances, debt levels and provisions are only published infrequently (often only once a year in the annual report & accounts of the company). * Published accounts are only disclosed weeks or months after the year-end date, meaning that the information disclosed is already out of date. In practice, EV calculations rely on reasonable estimates of the market value of these components. For example, in many professional valuations: * Unfunded pension liabilities are valued at face value as set out in notes to the latest available accounts. * Debt that is not publicly traded is usually taken at face value, unless the company is highly geared (in which case a more sophisticated analysis is required). * Associates & minority interests are usually valued either at book value or as a multiple of their earnings. =Avoiding temporal mismatches= When using valuation multiples such as EV/EBITDA and EV/EBIT, the numerator should correspond to the denominator. The EV should, therefore, correspond to the market value of the assets that were used to generate the profits in question, excluding assets acquired (and including assets disposed) during a different financial reporting period. This requires restating EV for any mergers and acquisitions (whether paid in cash or equity), significant capital investments or significant changes in working capital occurring after or during the reporting period being examined. Ideally, multiples should be calculated using the market value of the weighted average capital employed of the company during the comparable financial period. When calculating multiples over different time periods (e.g. historic multiples vs forward multiples), EV should be adjusted to reflect the weighted average invested capital of the company in each period.This is analogous to the way earnings per share (net income / weighted average number of shares) is influenced by changes in the number of shares over different financial years.

He served in the United States House of Representatives from 1989 to 2009 representing New York's Capital District and was chairman of the House Subcommittee on Social Security in the 110th Congress. Early life, education, and early political career McNulty was born in Troy, New York and attended Troy public schools. He attended the La Salle Institute, and graduated from the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts. He is a member of the third generation of a Catholic, Irish-American family long prominent in Capital District politics. His grandfather, Jack McNulty, Sr., was chairman of the Green Island, New York Democratic Party from 1919 to 1969, and Michael McNulty's father, Jack Jr., followed Jack McNulty Sr. as chairman. Michael McNulty worked as an insurance broker prior to entering politics. He was first elected to public office in November 1969 as Green Island's town supervisor; at 22, he was the youngest town supervisor in the state. In 1976, he ran for a seat in the New York State Assembly in the 106th Assembly District. He lost to Republican incumbent Neil Kelleher 55%-46%.http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=178862 A year later, he succeeded his father as chairman of the Green Island Democratic Party and was also elected as mayor of the village of Green Island, a post he held until 1982. New York Assembly After redistricting in 1982, Assemblyman Neil W. Kelleher, of the old 106th District, ran in the new 100th Assembly District, and McNulty ran in the new 106th. McNulty was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1983 to 1988, sitting in the 185th, 186th and 187th New York State Legislatures.  U.S. House of Representatives  = Elections = In 1988, U.S. Congressman Samuel S. Stratton of New York's 23rd congressional district announced his withdrawal from the race due to health issues. McNulty was selected to replace him on the ballot. He was elected handily in what was then one of the few reliably Democratic areas in Upstate New York. He was reelected nine more times without serious difficulty. The district was renumbered as the 21st District after the 1990 census. In 2004, he was challenged by Republican/Libertarian Warren Redlich, who would later run for governor in 2010. McNulty faced Redlich again in 2006, and was reelected with 78% of the vote - his widest margin. . He also had a primary challenge in 1996 by Lee H. Wasserman, in which he won by a closer margin than he ever had in the general election. In October 2007, McNulty announced that he would not seek an 11th term in Congress.Rick Karlin, McNulty won't run again: 10-term congressman plans announcement; move creates wide-open race for seat, October 26, 2007 .

Paul Tonko, who had served alongside McNulty in the State Assembly from 1983 to 1989, won the Democratic nomination to replace McNulty, and subsequently won the general election in November. Despite being an open seat, this was not considered a competitive election, as the 21st is considered the most Democratic district in the state outside of the New York City-based districts and Western New York. Both Congressional Quarterly and the Cook Political Report rated the race for the 21st's open seat as \\"Safe Democratic.\\" =Tenure= ;Positions McNulty is a moderate Democrat by New York standards. He voted for the War in Iraq, but since changed his stance and cosponsored Representative John Murtha's resolution for a phased withdrawal from the region.All Politics Is Local , Elizabeth Benjamin, Albany Times Union, July 20, 2006 McNulty was known for keeping a fairly low profile in the House; he said on numerous occasions that he had no plans to run for leadership posts or seek higher office, because he wanted to have more time to be with his grandchildren. He was known for being relatively quiet and not saying much on the floor; Roll Call once jokingly named him Chair of the Obscure Caucus.The Obscure Caucus, Lauren W. Whittington, Roll Call, September 8, 2003 ;Controversies McNulty presided over a vote to recommit an agricultural appropriations bill on the night of August 2, 2007 that would have prevented illegal immigrants from receiving food stamps. McNulty claimed the vote tied 214-214 with members changing their votes after time had expired, McNulty gaveled down a vote and tallied it 212-216 against the motion, while Republicans argued the House screen tally vote was 215-213 in favor to recommit. Republicans chanted \\"Shame\\" and later walked out of the House in protest. McNulty and Steny Hoyer apologized on the floor the next morning for prematurely gaveling down the vote. In May 2008, a bipartisan investigation panel including Bill Delahunt and Mike Pence began working to determine whether the vote had been tallied correctly and what action should be taken, if any. A year later, the panel found that the Democrats did indeed improperly tally the vote.http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,428082,00.html ;Rankings/endorsements He was consistently endorsed by both the Conservative Party and the Working Families Party, third parties in New York.

Cash equivalents are short-term commitments \\"with temporarily idle cash and easily convertible into a known cash amount\\". An investment normally counts to be a cash equivalent when it has a short maturity period of 90 days or less, and can be included in the cash and cash equivalents balance from the date of acquisition when it carries an insignificant risk of changes in the asset value; with more than 90 days maturity, the asset is not considered as cash and cash equivalents. Equity investments mostly are excluded from cash equivalents, unless they are essentially cash equivalents, for instance, if the preferred shares acquired within a short maturity period and with specified recovery date. One of the company's crucial health indicators is its ability to generate cash and cash equivalents. So, a company with relatively high net assets and significantly less cash and cash equivalents can mostly be considered an indication of non- liquidity. For investors and companies cash and cash equivalents are generally counted to be \\"low risk and low return\\" investments and sometimes analysts can estimate company's ability to pay its bills in a short period of time by comparing CCE and current liabilities. Nevertheless, this can happen only if there are receivables that can be converted into cash immediately. However, companies with a big value of cash and cash equivalents are targets for takeovers (by other companies), since their excess cash helps buyers to finance their acquisition. High cash reserves can also indicate that the company is not effective at deploying its CCE resources, whereas for big companies it might be a sign of preparation for substantial purchases. The opportunity cost of saving up CCE is the return on equity that company could earn by investing in a new product or service or expansion of business.  Components of cash  * Currency * Coins * Bank overdrafts normally are considered as financing activities. Nevertheless, where bank borrowings which are repayable on a demand form an integral part of company's cash management, bank overdrafts are considered to be a part of cash and cash equivalents. * Cash in saving accounts is generally for the saving purposes so that they are not used for daily expenses. * Cash in checking accounts allow to write checks and use electronic debit to access funds in the account. * Money order is a financial instrument issued by government or financial institutions which is used by payee to receive cash on demand. The advantage of money orders over checks is that it is more trusted since it is always prepaid. They are acceptable for payment of personal or small business's debts and can be purchased for a small fee at many locations such as post office and grocery. * Petty cash is a small amount of cash that is used for payment of insignificant expenses and the amount of it may vary depending on the organisation. For some entities $50 is adequate amount of cash, whereas for others the minimum sum should be $200. Petty cash funds must be safeguarded and recorded in order to avoid thefts. Often there is a custodian appointed who is responsible for the documentation of petty cash transactions.  Components of cash equivalents  1969 $100,000 Treasury Bill * Treasury bills, also called \\"T-bills\\", are a security issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury, where their purchase lends money to the U.S. government. T-bills are auctioned in denominations of $100, up to maximum amount of $5 million (or 35% of the auction offering if a competitive bid) and lack a coupon payment, but instead are sold at a discount, their yield being the difference between purchase price and redemption value, which is paid at maturity. Regular series Treasury bills mature in 4, 13, 26 & 52 weeks from their issue date, which may be purchased via TreasuryDirect or a licensed broker. * Commercial paper is a bearer document which is used by big companies. The minimum amount permitted is ¬£100,000 and this form of borrowing is not suitable for certain \\"entities\\". Finance companies sell 2/3 of their total commercial paper to the public, but there are also some companies which borrow less and sell their commercial paper to \\"paper dealers\\" who then re-sell the papers to the investors. A \\"round lot\\" for paper dealers is approximately ¬£250,000. * Marketable securities make business look more liquid, since they are also included in the calculation of current ratio. These securities are mostly traded on public exchange due to their ready price availability. There are two forms of Marketable Securities: Marketable Equity Securities and Marketable Debt Securities. * Money Market funds are similar to checking accounts, but they mostly pay higher interest rates generated on deposited funds. Net asset Value (NAV) of Money Market funds maintains stable compared to other mutual funds and its share price is constant: $1.00 per share. For businesses, non-profit organizations and many other institutions MMF are very effective \\"vehicle\\" for cash management. * Short-term government bonds are mostly issued by governments to support government's spending. They are mostly issued in country's domestic currency and in the U.S government bonds include the Saving bond, Treasury bond, Treasury inflation-protected securities and many others. Before investing into government bond investors should take into account political risk, inflation and interest rate risk.  Calculation of cash and cash equivalents  Cash and cash equivalents are listed on balance sheet as \\"current assets\\" and its value changes when different transactions are occurred. These changes are called \\"cash flows\\" and they are recorded on accounting ledger. For instance, if a company spends $300 on purchasing goods, this is recorded as $300 increase to its supplies and decrease in the value of CCE. These are few formulas that are used by analysts to calculate transactions related to cash and cash equivalents: Change in CCE = End of Year Cash and Cash equivalents - Beginning of Year Cash and Cash Equivalents. Value of Cash and Cash Equivalents at the end of period = Net Cash Flow + Value of CCE at the period of beginning  Liquidity measurement ratios  * Current ratio is generally used to estimate company's liquidity by \\"deriving the proportion of current assets available to cover current liabilities\\". The main idea behind this concept is to decide whether current assets which also include cash and cash equivalents are available pay off its short term liabilities (taxes, notes payable, etc.) The higher current ratio is, the better is for the organisation. \\\\mbox{Current Ratio} = {\\\\mbox{Current Assets}\\\\over \\\\mbox{Current Liabilities}} * Quick ratio is liquidity indicator that defines current ratio by measuring the most liquid current assets in the company that are available to cover liabilities. Unlike to the current ratio, inventories and other assets that are difficult to convert into the cash are excluded from the calculation of quick ratio.http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/quick+ratio \\\\mbox{Quick Ratio} = {{\\\\mbox{Current Assets} - \\\\mbox{Inventories}}\\\\over \\\\mbox{Current Liabilities}} * Cash ratio is more restrictive than above mentioned ratios because no other current assets than cash can be used to pay off current debt. Most of the creditors give importance to cash ratio of the company, since it give them idea whether the entity is able to maintain stable cash balances in order to pay off their current debts as they come due. \\\\mbox{Cash Ratio} = {\\\\mbox{Cash and Cash Equivalent}\\\\over \\\\mbox{Current Liabilities}}  Restricted cash  thumb Restricted cash is the amount of cash and cash equivalent items which are restricted for withdrawal and usage. The restrictions might include legally restricted deposits, which are held as compensating balances against short-term borrowings, contracts entered into with others or entity statements of intention with regard to specific deposits; nevertheless, time deposits and short-term certificates of deposit are excluded from legally restricted deposits. Restricted cash can be also set aside for other purposes such as expansion of the entity, dividend funds or \\"retirement of long-term debt\\". Depending on its immateriality or materiality, restricted cash may be recorded as \\"cash\\" in the financial statement or it might be classified based on the date of availability disbursements. Moreover, if cash is expected to be used within one year after the balance sheet date it can be classified as \\"current asset\\", but in a longer period of time it is mentioned as non- current asset. For example, a large machine manufacturing company receives an advance payment (deposit) from its customer for a machine that should be produced and shipped to another country within 2 months. Based on the customer contract the manufacturer should put the deposit into separate bank account and not withdraw or use the money until the equipment is shipped and delivered. This is a restricted cash, since manufacturer has the deposit, but he can not use it for operations until the equipment is shipped.

Symptoms include shortness of breath, weakness, fever, coughing and fatigue. A routine chest X-ray is not always necessary for people who have symptoms of a lower respiratory tract infection. Influenza affects both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Antibiotics are the first line treatment for pneumonia; however, they are neither effective nor indicated for parasitic or viral infections. Acute bronchitis typically resolves on its own with time. In 2015 there were about 291 million cases. These resulted in 2.74 million deaths down from 3.4 million deaths in 1990. This was 4.8% of all deaths in 2013.  Bronchitis  Bronchitis describes the swelling or inflammation of the bronchial tubes. Additionally, bronchitis is described as either acute or chronic depending on its presentation and is also further described by the causative agent. Acute bronchitis can be defined as acute bacterial or viral infection of the larger airways in healthy patients with no history of recurrent disease.Antibiotic Expert Group. Therapeutic guidelines: Antibiotic. 13th ed. North Melbourne: Therapeutic Guidelines; 2006. It affects over 40 adults per 1000 each year and consists of transient inflammation of the major bronchi and trachea. Most often it is caused by viral infection and hence antibiotic therapy is not indicated in immunocompetent individuals.Therapeutic guidelines : respiratory. 2nd ed: North Melbourne : Therapeutic Guidelines Limited, 2000. Viral bronchitis can sometimes be treated using antiviral medications depending on the virus causing the infection, and medications such as anti-inflammatory drugs and expectorants can help mitigate the symptoms. Treatment of acute bronchitis with antibiotics is common but controversial as their use has only moderate benefit weighted against potential side effects (nausea and vomiting), increased resistance, and cost of treatment in a self-limiting condition. Beta2 agonists are sometimes used to relieve the cough associated with acute bronchitis. In a recent systematic review it was found there was no evidence to support their use. Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) are frequently due to non-infective causes along with viral ones. 50% of patients are colonised with Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Moraxella catarrhalis. Antibiotics have only been shown to be effective if all three of the following symptoms are present: increased dyspnea, increased sputum volume, and purulence. In these cases, 500 mg of amoxicillin orally, every 8 hours for 5 days or 100 mg doxycycline orally for 5 days should be used.  Pneumonia  Pneumonia occurs in a variety of situations and treatment must vary according to the situation.Integrated pharmacology / Clive Page ... [et al.]. 2nd ed: Edinburgh : Mosby, 2002. It is classified as either community or hospital acquired depending on where the patient contracted the infection. It is life-threatening in the elderly or those who are immunocompromised. The most common treatment is antibiotics and these vary in their adverse effects and their effectiveness. Pneumonia is also the leading cause of death in children less than five years of age in low income countries. The most common cause of pneumonia is pneumococcal bacteria, Streptococcus pneumoniae accounts for 2/3 of bacteremic pneumonias.The Merck manual of diagnosis and therapy. 17th ed / Mark H. Beers and Robert Berkow ed: Whitehouse Station, N.J. : Merck Research Laboratories, 1999. This is a dangerous type of lung infection with a mortality rate of around 25%. For optimal management of a pneumonia patient, the following must be assessed: pneumonia severity (including treatment location, e.g., home, hospital or intensive care), identification of causative organism, analgesia of chest pain, the need for supplemental oxygen, physiotherapy, hydration, bronchodilators and possible complications of emphysema or lung abscess. Causes Deaths from lower respiratory infections per million persons in 2012 Disability-adjusted life year for lower respiratory infections per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004. Typical bacterial Infections: *Haemophilus influenzae *Staphylococcus aureus *Klebsiella pneumoniae Atypical bacterial Infections: *Legionella pneumophila *Mycoplasma pneumoniae *Chlamydophila pneumoniae *Chlamydia psittaci Parasitic infections: *Respiratory cryptosporidiosis Viral infections: *Adenovirus *Influenza A virus *Influenza B virus *Human parainfluenza viruses *Human respiratory syncytial virus *Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) *Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) *Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Aspiration pneumonia Prevention Vaccination helps prevent bronchopneumonia, mostly against influenza viruses, adenoviruses, measles, rubella, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, diphtheria, bacillus anthracis, chickenpox, and bordetella pertussis. Specifically for the children with low serum retinol or who are suffering from malnutrition, vitamin A supplements are recommended as a preventive measure against acute LRTI. Treatment Antibiotics do not help the many lower respiratory infections which are caused by parasites or viruses. While acute bronchitis often does not require antibiotic therapy, antibiotics can be given to patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. The indications for treatment are increased dyspnoea, and an increase in the volume or purulence of the sputum. The treatment of bacterial pneumonia is selected by considering the age of the patient, the severity of the illness and the presence of underlying disease. A systematic review of 32 randomised controlled trials with 6,078 participants with acute respiratory infections compared procalcitonin (a blood marker for bacterial infections) to guide the initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment, against no use of procalcitonin. Among 3,336 people receiving procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy, there were 236 deaths, compared to 336 deaths out 3,372 participants who did not. Procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy also reduced the antibiotic use duration by 2.4 days, and there were fewer antibiotic side effects. This means that procalcitonin is useful for guiding whether to use antibiotics for acute respiratory infections and the duration of the antibiotic. Amoxicillin and doxycycline are suitable for many of the lower respiratory tract infections seen in general practice. Another cochrane review suggests that new studies are needed to confirm that azithromycin may lead to less treatment failure and lower side effects than amoxycillin. In the other hand, there is no sufficient evidence to consider the antibiotics as a prophlaxis for the high risk children under 12 years. Oxygen supplementation is often recommended for people with severe lower respiratory tract infections. Oxygen can be provided in a non-invasive manner using nasal prongs, face masks, a head box or hood, a nasal catheter, or a nasopharyngeal catheter. For children younger than 15 years old, nasopharyngel catheters or nasal prongs are recommended over a face mask or head box. A Cochrane review in 2014 presented a summary to identify children complaining of severe LRTI, however; further research is required to determine the effectiveness of supplemental oxygen and the best delivery method. Epidemiology Lower respiratory infectious disease is the fifth-leading cause of death and the combined leading infectious cause of death, being responsible for 2.74 million deaths worldwide. This is generally similar to estimates in the 2010 Global Burden of Disease study. This total only accounts for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus Influenzae infections and does not account for atypical or nosocomial causes of lower respiratory disease, therefore underestimating total disease burden. Society and culture Lower respiratory tract infections place a considerable strain on the health budget and are generally more serious than upper respiratory infections. Workplace burdens arise from the acquisition of a lower respiratory tract infection, with factors such as total per person expenditures and total medical service utilisation demonstrated as greater among individuals experiencing a lower respiratory tract infection. Pan-national data collection indicates that childhood nutrition plays a significant role in determining the acquisition of a lower respiratory tract infection, with the promotion of the implementation of nutrition program, and policy guidelines in affected countries.

All three angles are at 180¬∞ in the conformation shown In biochemistry, a Ramachandran plot (also known as a Rama plot, a Ramachandran diagram or a [œÜ,œà] plot), originally developed in 1963 by G. N. Ramachandran, C. Ramakrishnan, and V. Sasisekharan, is a way to visualize energetically allowed regions for backbone dihedral angles œà against œÜ of amino acid residues in protein structure. The figure on the left illustrates the definition of the œÜ and œà backbone dihedral angles (called œÜ and œÜ' by Ramachandran). The œâ angle at the peptide bond is normally 180¬∞, since the partial-double-bond character keeps the peptide planar. The figure in the top right shows the allowed œÜ,œà backbone conformational regions from the Ramachandran et al. 1963 and 1968 hard-sphere calculations: full radius in solid outline, reduced radius in dashed, and relaxed tau (N-CŒ±-C) angle in dotted lines. Because dihedral angle values are circular and 0¬∞ is the same as 360¬∞, the edges of the Ramachandran plot \\"wrap\\" right-to-left and bottom-to- top. For instance, the small strip of allowed values along the lower-left edge of the plot are a continuation of the large, extended-chain region at upper left. A Ramachandran plot generated from human PCNA, a trimeric DNA clamp protein that contains both Œ≤-sheet and Œ±-helix (PDB ID 1AXC). The red, brown, and yellow regions represent the favored, allowed, and \\"generously allowed\\" regions as defined by ProCheck Uses A Ramachandran plot can be used in two somewhat different ways. One is to show in theory which values, or conformations, of the œà and œÜ angles are possible for an amino-acid residue in a protein (as at top right). A second is to show the empirical distribution of datapoints observed in a single structure (as at right, here) in usage for structure validation, or else in a database of many structures (as in the lower 3 plots at left). Either case is usually shown against outlines for the theoretically favored regions. Amino-acid preferences One might expect that larger side chains would result in more restrictions and consequently a smaller allowable region in the Ramachandran plot, but the effect of side chains is small. In practice, the major effect seen is that of the presence or absence of the methylene group at CŒ≤. Glycine has only a hydrogen atom for its side chain, with a much smaller van der Waals radius than the CH3, CH2, or CH group that starts the side chain of all other amino acids. Hence it is least restricted, and this is apparent in the Ramachandran plot for glycine (see Gly plot in gallery) for which the allowable area is considerably larger. In contrast, the Ramachandran plot for proline, with its 5-membered-ring side chain connecting CŒ± to backbone N, shows a limited number of possible combinations of œà and œÜ (see Pro plot in gallery). The residue preceding proline (\\"pre-proline\\") also has limited combinations compared to the general case. More recent updates The first Ramachandran plot was calculated just after the first protein structure at atomic resolution was determined (myoglobin, in 1960), although the conclusions were based on small-molecule crystallography of short peptides. Now, many decades later, there are tens of thousands of high-resolution protein structures determined by X-ray crystallography and deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Many studies have taken advantage of this data to produce more detailed and accurate œÜ,œà plots (e.g., Morris et al. 1992; Kleywegt & Jones 1996; Hooft et al. 1997; Hovm√∂ller et al. 2002; Lovell et al. 2003; Anderson et al. 2005. Ting et al. 2010). The four figures below show the datapoints from a large set of high- resolution structures and contours for favored and for allowed conformational regions for the general case (all amino acids except Gly, Pro, and pre-Pro), for Gly, and for Pro. The most common regions are labeled: Œ± for Œ± helix, LŒ± for left-handed helix, Œ≤ for Œ≤-sheet, and ppII for polyproline II. Such a clustering is alternatively described in the ABEGO system, where each letter stands for Œ± (and 310) helix, right-handed Œ≤ sheets (and extended structures), left-handed helixes, left-handed sheets, and finally unplottable cis peptide bonds sometimes seen with proline; it has been used in the classification of motifs and more recently for designing proteins. While the Ramachandran plot has been a textbook resource for explaining the structural behavior of peptide bond, an exhaustive exploration of how a peptide behaves in every region of the Ramachandran plot was only recently published (Mannige 2017). The Molecular Biophysics Unit at Indian Institute of Science celebrated 50 years of Ramachandran Map by organizing International Conference on Biomolecular Forms and Functions from 8‚Äì11 January 2013.

It was formed in Egypt in December 1914, and operated during the Gallipoli campaign. General William Birdwood commanded the corps, which primarily consisted of troops from the First Australian Imperial Force and 1st New Zealand Expeditionary Force, although there were also British and Indian units attached at times throughout the campaign. The corps disbanded in 1916, following the Allied evacuation of the Gallipoli peninsula and the formation of I ANZAC Corps and II ANZAC Corps. The corps was reestablished, briefly, in the Second World War during the Battle of Greece in 1941. Original formation Popular illustration of Anzac troops after the fighting at Gallipoli Plans for the formation began in November 1914 while the first contingent of Australian and New Zealand troops were still in convoy bound for, as they thought, Europe. However, following the experiences of the Canadian Expeditionary Force encamped on Salisbury Plain, where there was a shortage of accommodation and equipment, it was decided not to subject the Australians and New Zealanders to the English winter, and so they were diverted to Egypt for training before moving on to the Western Front in France. The British Secretary of State for War, Horatio Kitchener, appointed General William Birdwood, an officer of the British Indian Army, to the command of the corps and he furnished most of the corps staff from the Indian Army as well. Birdwood arrived in Cairo on 21 December 1914 to assume command of the corps. It was originally intended to name the corps the Australasian Army Corps, this title being used in the unit diary in line with the common practice of the time which often saw New Zealanders and Australians compete together as Australasia in sporting events. However, complaints from New Zealand recruits led to adoption of the name Australian and New Zealand Army Corps. The administration clerks found the title too cumbersome so quickly adopted the abbreviation A. & N.Z.A.C. or simply ANZAC. Shortly afterwards it was officially adopted as the codename for the corps, but it did not enter common usage amongst the troops until after the Gallipoli landings. At the outset, the corps comprised two divisions; the Australian Division, composed of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Australian Infantry Brigades and the New Zealand and Australian Division, composed of the New Zealand Infantry Brigade, New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, Australian 1st Light Horse Brigade and 4th Australian Infantry Brigade. The 2nd and 3rd Australian Light Horse Brigades were assigned as corps level troops, belonging to neither division. Despite being synonymous with Australia and New Zealand, ANZAC was a multi-national body: in addition to the many British officers in the corps and division staffs, the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps contained, at various points, the 7th Brigade of the Indian Mountain Artillery, Ceylon Planters Rifle Corps troops, the Zion Mule Corps, several battalions from the Royal Naval Division, the British 13th (Western) Division, one brigade of the British 10th (Irish) Division and the 29th Indian Brigade. Later formations =World War I= Following the evacuation of Gallipoli, Turkey, in December 1915, the Australian and New Zealand units reassembled in Egypt. The New Zealand contingent expanded to form their own division; the New Zealand Division. The First Australian Imperial Force underwent a major reorganisation resulting in the formation of two new divisions; the 4th and 5th divisions. (The Australian 3rd Division was forming in Australia and would be sent directly to England and then to France.) These divisions were reformed into two corps: I ANZAC Corps and II ANZAC Corps. I ANZAC Corps, under the command of General Birdwood, departed for France in early 1916. II ANZAC Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General Alexander Godley, followed soon after. In January 1916, the 4th (ANZAC) Battalion, Imperial Camel Corps, was formed with Australian and New Zealand troops. The 1st and 3rd Battalions were Australian, while the 2nd Battalion was British. Then in March 1916, the ANZAC Mounted Division with three Australian and one New Zealand brigade, was formed for service in Egypt and Palestine. There was also the 1st (ANZAC) Wireless Signal Squadron, which served with the British expeditionary force in Mesopotamia in 1916‚Äì1917. In early 1916, the Australian and, to a lesser extent, New Zealand governments sought the creation of an Australian and New Zealand Army, which would have included the New Zealand Division and all of the Australian infantry divisions, but this did not occur. =World War II= During World War II, the Australian I Corps HQ moved to Greece in April 1941. As the corps also controlled the New Zealand 2nd Division (along with Greek and British formations), it was officially renamed ANZAC Corps in April.Ewer, Peter (2008). Forgotten Anzacs: The Campaign in Greece, 1941, Scribe Publications Pty Ltd, . The Battle of Greece was over in weeks and the corps HQ left Greece on 23‚Äì24 April, with the name ANZAC Corps no longer being used.D.M. Horner. \\"Blamey, Sir Thomas Albert (1884‚Äì1951)\\". Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 13, Melbourne University Press, 1993, pp 196‚Äì201. Some troops evacuated to Alexandria, but the majority were sent to Crete to reinforce its garrison against an expected air and sea German invasion. Australians and New Zealanders were respectively deployed around the cities of Rethymno and Chania in western Crete with a smaller Australian force being positioned in Heraklion. The invasion began the morning of 20 May and, after the fierce Battle of Crete, which lasted ten days, Crete fell to the Germans. Most of the defenders of Chania withdrew across the island to the south coast and were evacuated by the Royal Navy from Sfakia. Many others evaded capture for several months, hiding in the mountains with generous assistance from the local Cretan population. Others who were captured and transported to Axis POW camps in mainland Europe were able to escape en route via Yugoslavia. Those who escaped found refuge with Chetniks and Yugoslav Partisans until they were either repatriated or recaptured by Axis forces. =Other conflicts= The Be'er Sheva Anzac Memorial Centre, Israel During the Vietnam War, two companies from the Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment were integrated into Royal Australian Regiment battalions. These integrated battalions had the suffix (ANZAC) added to their name (for example, 4 RAR became the 4RAR/NZ (ANZAC) Battalion). An ANZAC battalion served as one of the infantry battalions of the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) from early March 1968 until its withdrawal in December 1971. Due to the rotation of forces there were a total of five combined battalions of this period. The ANZAC Battle Group was the official designation of Australian and New Zealand units deployed to Timor Leste as part of Operation Astute. The battle group was established in September 2006.

Educators utilising the technique adopt a character or 'role', with the intent of engaging typically younger students in a fictional or historically-inspired setting to convey desired concepts, attitudes and ideals.  Rationale of the Methodology  If the role of a teacher is to teach, the role of a student must be to learn. However, it has been agreed that learning is not only an exercise in reading and reciting facts, but in gaining a deeper insight of events and situations. This is where drama becomes an invaluable tool. Through the use of drama and dramatic conventions a teacher does not only teach and learn the \\"what\\" but also the \\"why\\" and \\"how\\". Drama techniques in education allows students to take a step back out of usual teaching techniques. Students are able to communicate better in conceptual, personal and social levels as they are able to be a listener, speaker and receiver of knowledge. By using role-play, the teacher gives them a way to view and think about a situation using the \\"implied\\" behaviour for the role they are given. In turn, the teacher can allow the students to become in charge of their own learning and facilitate them in it. We empower the individual making their expertise greater than our own. Through role-playing, they gain knowledge of what the role entails, and thus insight into the experience and emotions of characters in those circumstances. Additionally, the technique improves personal social techniques in students, like eye contact and gestures. Methodology in Practice Teachers choose roles carefully in order to engender different interactions and dynamics within the context of the dramatic environment. Adopting different roles in a fictional setting and allowing students to explore the information of the setting through dialogue is an interactive and engaging method of teaching. Teacher- in-role theory highlights particularly the significance of differing status of the role in relation to the role of the students. Differing between a high status character (such as a king) and a low status character (such as a peasant) allows students to explore and engage with a range of differing experiences and emotions. Skilled educators can manipulate these dynamics to supplement teaching theory or larger concepts. Alternatively, the teacher can encourage students to use their own imagination and derive information from implied context behind their own roles. One of the best teacher in roles practices in this manner is a TV talk show interviewing various people (students) from educational books/stories. Mantle of the expert Mantle of the Expert is a drama in education device designed by Dorothy Heathcote. In Mantle of the Expert, students are in-role as experts in any given area. They cannot be simply told that they are experts, they have to really take on the role, and feel as if they are experts. This can be done through a number of character development games or exercises. The teacher is generally in-role in Mantle of the Expert, and provides a structure upon which the students can build to gradually progress to more independent learning. Mantle of the Expert is described, explained and exemplified in the book Drama for Learning: Dorothy Heathcote's Mantle of the Expert Approach to Education, by Dorothy Heathcote and Gavin Bolton.

The community is located near the center of Crockery Township in Ottawa County, close to the junction of Interstate 96 (I-96) M-104 and M-231 at . The first white settlers were Manley Patchin in 1836 and William Hathaway, Jr., in 1839. Hathaway became the first postmaster of Crockery Creek on February 7, 1848. The name of the post office was changed to Nunica on January 8, 1859. The settlement was first platted by Henry Ernst in 1865. The name Nunica is derived from the Native American word menonica, meaning \\"clay earth\\", from which pottery was made. This clay was also the origin for the name of Crockery Creek. The Nunica ZIP code 49448 serves most of Crockery Township, as well as portions of Sullivan Township in Muskegon County to the north and small areas of Polkton Township to the east.49448 5-Digit ZCTA, 494 3-Digit ZCTA - Reference Map - American FactFinder, U.S. Census Bureau, 2000 census History The Nunica vicinity has been inhabited by the Ottawa Native Americans for centuries. The name means \\"clay earth\\". The first European explorers in the Ottawa County region were the French-Canadian explorers Louis Joliet and Father Jacques Marquette who passed through the region in the mid 17th century. European settlement in the area proceeded slowly until the mid-19th century, when zinc was discovered in nearby Crockery Creek in 1858.Barnes, 1997 In 1872, the town of Nunica was officially incorporated, the name taken from the Ottawa word for zinc. The 1880 census showed approximately 1,000 settlers in the region. Nunica experienced rapid growth in population in the early 20th century as settlers came to the region to mine zinc and farm. The settlement process was aided by the Grand Haven‚ÄìDetroit branch of the Grand Trunk Western Railroad on which Nunica was an important stop. The 1920 census shows Nunica at the peak of its population, with 8,000 citizens. By 1924 the zinc ore in the region had been completely exhausted. Coupled with a particularly severe influenza outbreak in 1927 that claimed the lives of nearly 800 people from the town, the population of Nunica declined. The 1930 census shows the population of Nunica as 5,000. In 1935 nearly one-third of Nunica was destroyed by fire, in what became known locally as the great Nunica fire. It is speculated that the fire began when the Nunica train station was struck by lightning.Barnes, 1997, p. 35. In either case, the train station that had served as the main source of livelihood for the town was completely destroyed, along with such forgotten landmarks as the Nunica Conservatory for Music and other Fine Arts and the Nunica casino. None of these landmarks were ever rebuilt. In addition, nearly of farmland were completely destroyed. Since the train station was never rebuilt, Nunica never recovered from the devastating fire and the population went into freefall. By 1950 there were only 1,000 citizens in the greater Nunica area. In 1957 the town was unincorporated. The current population of Nunica is estimated at 400. A new highway has been built near the Nunica area just off I-96. M-231 has been built as a two-lane freeway so it can relieve traffic congestion at the U.S. Highway 31 drawbridge in Grand Haven. This highway was completed on October 30, 2015.

A dramatic convention is a set of rules which both the audience and actors are familiar with and which act as a useful way of quickly signifying the nature of the action or of a character. All forms of theatre have dramatic conventions, some of which may be unique to that particular form, such as the poses used by actors in Japanese kabuki theatre to establish a character, or the stock character of the black-cloaked, moustache twirling villain in early cinema melodrama serials. It can also include an implausible facet of a performance required by the technical limitations or artistic nature of a production and which is accepted by the audience as part of suspension of disbelief. For example, a dramatic convention in Shakespeare is that a character can move downstage to deliver a soliloquy which cannot be heard by the other characters on stage nor are characters in a musical surprised by another character bursting into song. One more example would be how the audience accepts the passage of time during a play or how music will play during a romantic scene. Dramatic conventions may be categorized into groups, such as rehearsal, technical or theatrical. Rehearsal conventions can include hot seating, role on the wall and still images. Technical conventions can include lighting, dialogue, monologue, set, costuming and entrances/exits. Theatrical conventions may include split focus, flashback/flashforward, narration, soliloquy and spoken thought.

He co-founded the Honolulu Diamond Sangha in 1959 together with his wife, Anne Hopkins Aitken. Aitken received Dharma transmission from Koun Yamada in 1985 but decided to live as a layperson. He was a socialist advocating social justice for gays, women and Native Hawaiians throughout his life, and was one of the original founders of the Buddhist Peace Fellowship. Biography Robert Baker Aitken and Anne Hopkins Aitken Robert Aitken was born to Robert Thomas Aitken and Gladys Page Baker in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1917. He was raised in Hawaii from the age of five. Living in Guam as a civilian working in construction‚Äîat the onset of World War II‚Äîhe was detained by the Japanese and held in internment camps for the duration of the war. In one such internment camp in Kobe, Japan in 1944 he met the scholar Reginald Horace Blyth, with whom he had frequent discussions on Zen Buddhism and anarchism. At the conclusion of the war he returned to Hawaii and obtained a B.A. in English literature and an MA in Japanese from the University of Hawaii. In the late 1940s, while going to classes briefly at the University of California in Berkeley, California, he met Nyogen Senzaki. Originally in California hoping for an encounter with Krishnamurti, he began to study with Senzaki in Los Angeles. It was during this period that his commitment to leftist social issues - such as pacifism and labor rights ‚Äì became more vocal. As a result of his advocacy, he was investigated during this period by the FBI. In 1950 he went back to Japan, under a grant to study haiku and followed Senzaki's recommendation that he study Zen there. There he took part in his first sesshin at Engaku-ji, a temple in Kamakura, Japan. Soon after, he met Nakagawa Soen, who persuaded him to come for a stay at Ryutakuji for the next seven months. During this period Soen took over for the ailing abbot of the temple, Yamamoto Gempo. Aitken then came down with a case of dysentery, and returned home to Hawaii. He married his second wife Anne Hopkins in 1957 and made occasional trips back to Japan. In 1957 Aitken met Hakuun Yasutani and sat with him for the first time. In 1959 he and Anne began a meditation group in Honolulu at their residence, which became known as the Koko-an zendo. The community that gathered at this zendo were then named the Diamond Sangha by the two. The Diamond Sangha has affiliate zen centers in South America, Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Europe and is known for making the rigors of traditional Zen accessible to lay practitioners. In 1960 Soen Nakagawa Roshi asked young monk Eido Tai Shimano to travel to Honolulu to assist at the Diamond Sangha center. In 1961, Aitken made an extended stay in Japan to study under Haku'un Yasutani, eventually ending his studies with Soen. He then worked in various capacities at the East-West Center and the University of Hawaii until 1969, when he and Anne moved to Maui, Hawaii to found the Maui Zendo in Haiku- Pauwela. Koun Yamada R≈çshi was invited to lead the Diamond Sangha and he moved to Hawaii in 1971. In 1974 Aitken was given permission to teach by Koun Yamada, receiving full Dharma transmission from him in 1985. Robert Aitken was a social activist through much of his adult life, beginning with protesting against nuclear testing during the 1940s. He was an outspoken critic of the Vietnam War, and became a strong opponent of the nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union. He was among the earlier proponents of deep ecology in religious America, and was outspoken in his beliefs on the equality of men and women. In 1978 Aitken helped found the Buddhist Peace Fellowship, an organization that advocates conflict resolution globally. Aitken Roshi died after a brief bout with pneumonia on August 5, 2010 in Honolulu, Oahu, Hawaii.

The Kotwica symbol on the Reduta Bank Polski monument to the Warsaw Uprising. The Kotwica (; Polish for \\"Anchor\\") was a World War II emblem of the Polish Underground State and Armia Krajowa (Home Army, or AK). It was created in 1942 by members of the AK Wawer Minor sabotage unit, as an easily usable emblem for the Polish struggle to regain independence. The initial meaning of the initials PW was Pom≈õcimy Wawer (\\"We shall avenge Wawer\\"). This was a reference to the Wawer massacre (26‚Äì27 December 1939), which was considered to be one of the first large scale massacres of Polish civilians by German troops in occupied Poland. At first, Polish scouts from sabotage groups painted the whole phrase upon walls. However, it was soon abbreviated to the letters PW, which over time came to symbolise the phrase Polska WalczƒÖca (\\"Fighting Poland\\"). Early in 1942, the AK organised a contest to design an emblem to represent the resistance movement, and the winning design (pictured) by Anna Smole≈Ñska, a member of the Gray Ranks who herself participated in minor sabotage operations, combined the letters P and W into the Kotwica. Smole≈Ñska was arrested by the Gestapo in November 1942 and died in Auschwitz in March 1943, at the age of twenty-three. History of the emblem The Kotwica was first painted on walls in Warsaw, as a psychological-warfare tactic against the occupying Germans, by Polish boy scouts on 20 March 1942. On 27 June 1942 it was used to initiate a new form of minor sabotage. In order to commemorate the patron saint's day of the Polish President W≈Çadys≈Çaw Raczkiewicz and the Commander-in-Chief W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski, members of the Armia Krajowa in Warsaw stamped several hundred copies of the German-backed propaganda newspaper, Nowy Kurier Warszawski (The New Warsaw Courier), with the Kotwica. This became an annual event during the German occupation. In its first year only 500 copies were stamped with the emblem but this number grew to 7,000 the following year. On 18 February 1943, the Armia Krajowa's commander, General Stefan Rowecki, issued an order specifying that all sabotage, partisan and terrorist actions be signed with the Kotwica. On 25 February, the official organ of the Armia Krajowa, Biuletyn Informacyjny, called the Kotwica \\"the sign of the underground Polish Army\\". The emblem gained enormous popularity and became recognised throughout occupied Poland. During the later stages of the war, most of the political and military organisations in Poland (even those not related to the Armia Krajowa) adopted it as their symbol. It was painted on the walls of Polish cities, stamped on German banknotes and post stamps, printed on the headers of underground newspapers and books, and it also became one of the symbols of the Warsaw Uprising (the letters P and W are also abbreviations of Wojsko Polskie (\\"Polish Army\\") and Powstanie Warszawskie (\\"Warsaw Uprising\\"). After World War II, Poland's communist regime banned the Kotwica, although it continued to be used abroad by associations of former Armia Krajowa members living in exile. Prohibition of the emblem's use was relaxed in Poland in the later years of communist rule and in 1976 it became one of the symbols of Ruch Obrony Praw Cz≈Çowieka i Obywatela (ROPCiO), an anti-communist organisation defending human rights in Poland. It was also adopted by other anti-communist political organisations, ranging from the rightist Confederation of Independent Poland (KPN) of Leszek Moczulski to Solidarno≈õƒá WalczƒÖca (Fighting Solidarity), an organisation formed in response to the de-legalisation of the independent trade union Solidarity and government repression of the opposition after martial law was declared in Poland in 1981.

These are also known as mass scales, weight scales, mass balances, weight balances, or simply scales, balances, or balance scales. The traditional scale consists of two plates or bowls suspended at equal distances from a fulcrum. One plate holds an object of unknown mass (or weight), while known masses are added to the other plate until static equilibrium is achieved and the plates level off, which happens when the masses on the two plates are equal. The perfect scale rests at neutral. A spring scale will make use of a spring of known stiffness to determine mass (or weight). Suspending a certain mass will extend the spring by a certain amount depending on the spring's stiffness (or spring constant). The heavier the object, the more the spring stretches, as described in Hooke's law. Other types of scales making use of different physical principles also exist. Some scales can be calibrated to read in units of force (weight) such as newtons instead of units of mass such as kilograms. Scales and balances are widely used in commerce, as many products are sold and packaged by mass. Balance scales =History= The Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead depicts a scene in which a scribe's heart is weighed against the feather of truth. The balance scale is such a simple device that its usage likely far predates the evidence. What has allowed archaeologists to link artifacts to weighing scales are the stones for determining absolute mass. The balance scale itself was probably used to determine relative mass long before absolute mass. The oldest evidence for the existence of weighing scales dates to in the Indus River valley. Prior to that, no banking was performed due to lack of scales. Uniform, polished stone cubes discovered in early settlements were probably used as mass-setting stones in balance scales. Although the cubes bear no markings, their masses are multiples of a common denominator. The cubes are made of many different kinds of stones with varying densities. Clearly their mass, not their size or other characteristics, was a factor in sculpting these cubes. In Egypt, scales can be traced to around 1878 BC, but their usage probably extends much earlier. Carved stones bearing marks denoting mass and the Egyptian hieroglyphic symbol for gold have been discovered, which suggests that Egyptian merchants had been using an established system of mass measurement to catalog gold shipments or gold mine yields. Although no actual scales from this era have survived, many sets of weighing stones as well as murals depicting the use of balance scales suggest widespread usage. In China, the earliest weighing balance excavated was from a tomb of the State of Chu of the Chinese Warring States Period dating back to the 3rd to 4th century BC in Mount Zuojiagong near Changsha, Hunan. The balance was made of wood and used bronze masses. Variations on the balance scale, including devices like the cheap and inaccurate bismar (unequal-armed scales), began to see common usage by c. 400 B.C. by many small merchants and their customers. A plethora of scale varieties each boasting advantages and improvements over one another appear throughout recorded history, with such great inventors as Leonardo da Vinci lending a personal hand in their development. Even with all the advances in weighing scale design and development, all scales until the seventeenth century AD were variations on the balance scale. The standardization of the weights used ‚Äì and ensuring traders used the correct weights ‚Äì was a considerable preoccupation of governments throughout this time.

Finely crafted pan balance or scales, with boxed set of standardized gram masses The original form of a balance consisted of a beam with a fulcrum at its center. For highest accuracy, the fulcrum would consist of a sharp V-shaped pivot seated in a shallower V-shaped bearing. To determine the mass of the object, a combination of reference masses was hung on one end of the beam while the object of unknown mass was hung on the other end (see balance and steelyard balance). For high precision work, such as empirical chemistry, the center beam balance is still one of the most accurate technologies available, and is commonly used for calibrating test masses. =Mechanical balances= The balance (also balance scale, beam balance and laboratory balance) was the first mass measuring instrument invented. In its traditional form, it consists of a pivoted horizontal lever with arms of equal lengththe beamand a weighing panOr \\"scale\\", \\"scalepan\\" or the obsolete \\"basin\\" (A Practical Dictionary of the English and German Languages (1869), p. 1069). suspended from each arm (hence the plural name \\"scales for a weighing instrument). The unknown mass is placed in one pan and standard masses are added to the other pan until the beam is as close to equilibrium as possible. In precision balances, a more accurate determination of the mass is given by the position of a sliding mass moved along a graduated scale. Technically, a balance compares weight rather than mass, but, in a given gravitational field (such as Earth's gravity), the weight of an object is proportional to its mass, so the standard masses used with balances are usually labeled in units of mass (e.g. g or kg). decagram masses Market hawker weighing meat (in catty) on a beam balance, Malaysia (1969) Masses of 50, 20, 1, 2, 5 and 10 grams 1 kg Mass used in India Unlike spring-based scales, balances are used for the precision measurement of mass as their accuracy is not affected by variations in the local gravitational field. (On Earth, for example, these can amount to ¬±0.5% between locations. pp. 3480‚Äì3485.) A change in the strength of the gravitational field caused by moving the balance does not change the measured mass, because the moments of force on either side of the beam are affected equally. A balance will render an accurate measurement of mass at any location experiencing a constant gravity or acceleration. Very precise measurements are achieved by ensuring that the balance's fulcrum is essentially friction-free (a knife edge is the traditional solution), by attaching a pointer to the beam which amplifies any deviation from a balance position; and finally by using the lever principle, which allows fractional masses to be applied by movement of a small mass along the measuring arm of the beam, as described above. For greatest accuracy, there needs to be an allowance for the buoyancy in air, whose effect depends on the densities of the masses involved. Aluminum, mass-produced balance scale (steelyard balance) sold and used throughout China: the scale can be inverted and held by the larger ring beneath the user's right hand to produce greater leverage for heavier loads (Hainan, China, 2011) To reduce the need for large reference masses, an off-center beam can be used. A balance with an off-center beam can be almost as accurate as a scale with a center beam, but the off- center beam requires special reference masses and cannot be intrinsically checked for accuracy by simply swapping the contents of the pans as a center- beam balance can. To reduce the need for small graduated reference masses, a sliding weight called a poise can be installed so that it can be positioned along a calibrated scale. A poise adds further intricacies to the calibration procedure, since the exact mass of the poise must be adjusted to the exact lever ratio of the beam. For greater convenience in placing large and awkward loads, a platform can be floated on a cantilever beam system which brings the proportional force to a noseiron bearing; this pulls on a stilyard rod to transmit the reduced force to a conveniently sized beam. One still sees this design in portable beam balances of 500 kg capacity which are commonly used in harsh environments without electricity, as well as in the lighter duty mechanical bathroom scale (which actually uses a spring scale, internally). The additional pivots and bearings all reduce the accuracy and complicate calibration; the float system must be corrected for corner errors before the span is corrected by adjusting the balance beam and poise. A Roberval balance. The pivots of the parallelogram understructure makes it insensitive to load positioning away from center, so improves its accuracy, and ease of use. Roberval balance In 1669 the Frenchman Gilles Personne de Roberval presented a new kind of balance scale to the French Academy of Sciences. This scale consisted of a pair of vertical columns separated by a pair of equal-length arms and pivoting in the center of each arm from a central vertical column, creating a parallelogram. From the side of each vertical column a peg extended. To the amazement of observers, no matter where Roberval hung two equal weight along the peg, the scale still balanced. In this sense, the scale was revolutionary: it evolved into the more-commonly encountered form consisting of two pans placed on vertical column located above the fulcrum and the parallelogram below them. The advantage of the Roberval design is that no matter where equal weights are placed in the pans, the scale will still balance. A gear balance:A rare document on \\"gear balance\\". A = Axle, F = Frame, G = Generator, GL = geared linkage, WL = weighted lever; counter weight added for balance, all the gear linkages free running on the rotating frameFurther developments have included a \\"gear balance\\" in which the parallelogram is replaced by any odd number of interlocking gears greater than one, with alternating gears of the same size and with the central gear fixed to a stand and the outside gears fixed to pans, as well as the \\"sprocket gear balance\\" consisting of a bicycle-type chain looped around an odd number of sprockets with the central one fixed and the outermost two free to pivot and attached to a pan. Because it has more moving joints which add friction, the Roberval balance is consistently less accurate than the traditional beam balance, but for many purposes this is compensated for by its usability. =Electronic devices= Microbalance A microbalance, ultramicrobalance, or nanobalance are instruments capable of making precise measurements of mass of objects of relatively small mass: of the order of a million parts of a gram and below. Analytical balance Mettler digital analytical balance with 0.1 mg readability An analytical balance is a class of balance designed to measure small mass in the sub-milligram range. The measuring pan of an analytical balance (0.1 mg or better) is inside a transparent enclosure with doors so that dust does not collect and so any air currents in the room do not affect the balance's operation. This enclosure is often called a draft shield. The use of a mechanically vented balance safety enclosure, which has uniquely designed acrylic airfoils, allows a smooth turbulence-free airflow that prevents balance fluctuation and the measure of mass down to 1 Œºg without fluctuations or loss of product. Also, the sample must be at room temperature to prevent natural convection from forming air currents inside the enclosure from causing an error in reading. Single-pan mechanical substitution balance maintains consistent response throughout the useful capacity is achieved by maintaining a constant load on the balance beam, thus the fulcrum, by subtracting mass on the same side of the beam to which the sample is added. Electronic analytical scales measure the force needed to counter the mass being measured rather than using actual masses. As such they must have calibration adjustments made to compensate for gravitational differences. They use an electromagnet to generate a force to counter the sample being measured and outputs the result by measuring the force needed to achieve balance. Such measurement device is called electromagnetic force restoration sensor. Pendulum balance scales Pendulum type scales do not use springs. This design uses pendulums and operates as a balance and is unaffected by differences in gravity. An example of application of this design are scales made by the Toledo Scale Company. Programmable scales A programmable scale has a programmable logic controller in it, allowing it to be programmed for various applications such as batching, labeling, filling, truck scales and more. =Symbolism= The scales (specifically, a two-pan, beam balance) are one of the traditional symbols of justice, as wielded by statues of Lady Justice. This corresponds to the use in metaphor of matters being \\"held in the balance\\". It has its origins in ancient Egypt. Scales are also the symbol for the astrological sign Libra. Scales (specifically, a two-pan, beam balance in a state of equal balance) are the traditional symbol of Pyrrhonism indicating the equal balance of arguments used in inducing epoche.Sarah Bakewell, How to Live: Or A Life of Montaigne in One Question and Twenty Attempts at an Answer 2011 p 127 Force-measuring (weight) scales =History= A simple balance from the 19th century Although records dating to the 1700s refer to spring scales for measuring mass, the earliest design for such a device dates to 1770 and credits Richard Salter, an early scale-maker. Spring scales came into wide usage in the United Kingdom after 1840 when R. W. Winfield developed the candlestick scale for weighing letters and packages, required after the introduction of the Uniform Penny Post. Postal workers could work more quickly with spring scales than balance scales, because they could be read instantaneously and did not have to be carefully balanced with each measurement. By the 1940s, various electronic devices were being attached to these designs to make readings more accurate. Load cells ‚Äì transducers that convert force to an electrical signal ‚Äì have their beginnings as early as the late nineteenth century, but it was not until the late twentieth century that their widespread usage became economically and technologically viable. =Mechanical scales= A mechanical scale or balance is used to describe a weighing device that is used to measure the mass, force exertion, tension and resistance of an object without the need of a power supply. Types of mechanical scale include spring scales, hanging scales, triple beam balances and force gauges. Spring scales A spring scale measures mass by reporting the distance that a spring deflects under a load. This contrasts to a balance, which compares the torque on the arm due to a sample weight to the torque on the arm due to a standard reference mass using a horizontal lever. Spring scales measure force, which is the tension force of constraint acting on an object, opposing the local force of gravity. They are usually calibrated so that measured force translates to mass at earth's gravity. The object to be weighed can be simply hung from the spring or set on a pivot and bearing platform. In a spring scale, the spring either stretches (as in a hanging scale in the produce department of a grocery store) or compresses (as in a simple bathroom scale). By Hooke's law, every spring has a proportionality constant that relates how hard it is pulled to how far it stretches. Weighing scales use a spring with a known spring constant (see Hooke's law) and measure the displacement of the spring by any variety of mechanisms to produce an estimate of the gravitational force applied by the object. Rack and pinion mechanisms are often used to convert the linear spring motion to a dial reading. Spring scales have two sources of error that balances do not: the measured mass varies with the strength of the local gravitational force (by as much as 0.5% at different locations on Earth), and the elasticity of the measurement spring can vary slightly with temperature. With proper manufacturing and setup, however, spring scales can be rated as legal for commerce. To remove the temperature error, a commerce-legal spring scale must either have temperature-compensated springs or be used at a fairly constant temperature. To eliminate the effect of gravity variations, a commerce-legal spring scale must be calibrated where it is used. Hydraulic or pneumatic scale It is also common in high-capacity applications such as crane scales to use hydraulic force to sense mass. The test force is applied to a piston or diaphragm and transmitted through hydraulic lines to a dial indicator based on a Bourdon tube or electronic sensor. =Domestic Weighing Scale= Electronic digital scales display weight as a number, usually on a liquid crystal display (LCD). They are versatile because they may perform calculations on the measurement and transmit it to other digital devices. In a digital scale, the force of the weight causes a spring to deform, and the amount of deformation is measured by one or more transducers called strain gauges. A strain gauge is a conductor whose electrical resistance changes when its length changes. Strain gauges have limited capacity and larger digital scales may use a hydraulic transducer called a load cell instead. A voltage is applied to the device, and the weight causes the current through it to change. The current is converted to a digital number by an analog-to-digital converter, translated by digital logic to the correct units, and displayed on the display. Usually the device is run by a microprocessor chip. Digital bathroom scale A digital bathroom scale is a scale on the floor which a person stands on. The weight is shown on an LED or LCD display. The digital electronics may do more than just display weight, it may calculate body fat, BMI, lean mass, muscle mass, and water ratio. Some modern bathroom scales are wirelessly or cellularly connected and have features like smartphone integration, cloud storage, and fitness tracking. They are usually powered by a button cell, or battery of AA or AAA size. Self-weighing is an effective strategy for weight loss, and over time, adults who engaged in frequent self-weighing found it to be more positive, more helpful, and less frustrating. Digital kitchen scale Digital kitchen scales are used for weighing food in a kitchen during cooking. These are usually light-weight and compact. Strain gauge scale In electronic versions of spring scales, the deflection of a beam supporting the unknown mass is measured using a strain gauge, which is a length-sensitive electrical resistance. The capacity of such devices is only limited by the resistance of the beam to deflection. The results from several supporting locations may be added electronically, so this technique is suitable for determining the mass of very heavy objects, such as trucks and rail cars, and is used in a modern weighbridge. Supermarket and other retail scale These scales are used in the modern bakery, grocery, delicatessen, seafood, meat, produce and other perishable goods departments. Supermarket scales can print labels and receipts, mark mass and count, unit price, total price and in some cases tare. Some modern supermarket scales print an RFID tag that can be used to track the item for tampering or returns. In most cases, these types of scales have a sealed calibration so that the reading on the display is correct and cannot be tampered with. In the US, the scales are certified by the National Type Evaluation Program (NTEP), in South Africa by the South African Bureau of Standards and in the UK by the International Organization of Legal Metrology. =Testing and certification= Scales used for trade purposes in the United States, as this scale at the checkout in a cafeteria, are inspected for accuracy by the FDACS's Bureau of Weights and Measures. Most countries regulate the design and servicing of scales used for commerce. This has tended to cause scale technology to lag behind other technologies because expensive regulatory hurdles are involved in introducing new designs. Nevertheless, there has been a trend to \\"digital load cells\\" which are actually strain-gauge cells with dedicated analog converters and networking built into the cell itself. Such designs have reduced the service problems inherent with combining and transmitting a number of 20 millivolt signals in hostile environments. Government regulation generally requires periodic inspections by licensed technicians, using masses whose calibration is traceable to an approved laboratory. Scales intended for non- trade use, such as those used in bathrooms, doctor's offices, kitchens (portion control), and price estimation (but not official price determination) may be produced, but must by law be labelled \\"Not Legal for Trade\\" to ensure that they are not re-purposed in a way that jeopardizes commercial interest. In the United States, the document describing how scales must be designed, installed, and used for commercial purposes is NIST Handbook 44. Legal For Trade (LFT) certification usually approve the readability as repeatability/10 to ensure a maximum margin of error of 10%. Because gravity varies by over 0.5% over the surface of the earth, the distinction between force due to gravity and mass is relevant for accurate calibration of scales for commercial purposes. Usually the goal is to measure the mass of the sample rather than its force due to gravity at that particular location. Traditional mechanical balance-beam scales intrinsically measured mass. But ordinary electronic scales intrinsically measure the gravitational force between the sample and the earth, i.e. the weight of the sample, which varies with location. So such a scale has to be re-calibrated after installation, for that specific location, in order to obtain an accurate indication of mass. Sources of error Some of the sources of error in weighing are: * Buoyancy ‚Äì Objects in air develop a buoyancy force that is directly proportional to the volume of air displaced. The difference in density of air due to barometric pressure and temperature creates errors. * Error in mass of reference weight * Air gusts, even small ones, which push the scale up or down * Friction in the moving components that causes the scale to reach equilibrium at a different configuration than a frictionless equilibrium should occur. * Settling airborne dust contributing to the weight * Mis-calibration over time, due to drift in the circuit's accuracy, or temperature change * Mis-aligned mechanical components due to thermal expansion or contraction of components * Magnetic fields acting on ferrous components * Forces from electrostatic fields, for example, from feet shuffled on carpets on a dry day * Chemical reactivity between air and the substance being weighed (or the balance itself, in the form of corrosion) * Condensation of atmospheric water on cold items * Evaporation of water from wet items * Convection of air from hot or cold items * Gravitational differences for a scale which measures force, but not for a balance. * Vibration and seismic disturbances Hybrid spring and balance scales The prototype of an elastic arm scale measuring a mass. =Elastic arm scale= In 2014 a concept of hybrid scale was introduced, the elastically deformable arm scale, which is a combination between a spring scale and a beam balance, exploiting simultaneously both principles of equilibrium and deformation. In this scale, the rigid arms of a classical beam balance (for example a steelyard) are replaced with a flexible elastic rod in an inclined frictionless sliding sleeve. The rod can reach a unique free of sliding equilibrium when two vertical dead loads (or masses) are applied at its edges. Equilibrium, which would be impossible with rigid arms, is guaranteed because configurational forces develop at the two edges of the sleeve as a consequence of both the free sliding condition and the nonlinear kinematics of the elastic rod. This mass measuring device can also work without a counterweight.

Between 1934 and 1943 General Electric and the PRR's Altoona Works built 139 GG1s. The GG1 entered service with the PRR in 1935 and later ran on successor railroads Penn Central, Conrail and Amtrak. The last GG1 was retired by New Jersey Transit in 1983. Most have been scrapped, but sixteen are in museums.For photos of the GG-1s in action, see Carleton, Paul. \\"Under Pennsy Wires\\" (1977: D. Carleton Railbooks). Technical information =Body and mechanical= The GG1 was long and weighed . The frame of the locomotive was in two halves joined with a ball and socket joint, allowing the locomotive to negotiate sharper curves. The body rested on the frame and was clad in welded steel plates. The control cabs were near the center of the locomotive on each side of the main oil- cooled transformer and oil-fired train-heating boiler. This arrangement, first used on the PRR's Modified P5 class, provided for greater crew safety in a collision and provided for bi-directional operation of the locomotive. Using Whyte notation for steam locomotives, each frame is a 4-6-0 locomotive, which in the Pennsylvania Railroad classification system is a \\"G\\". The GG1 has two such frames back to back, 4-6-0+0-6-4. The related AAR wheel arrangement classification is 2-C+C-2. This means one frame mounted upon a set of two axles unpowered (the \\"2\\") and three axles powered (the \\"C\\") hinged with the ball and socket to another frame of the same design (the +). The unpowered \\"2\\" axles are at either end of the locomotive. The GG1 was equipped with Leslie A200 horn. =Electrical and propulsion= A pantograph on each end of the locomotive body was used to collect the 11,000 V, 25 Hz alternating current (AC) from the overhead lines. In operation the leading pantograph was usually kept lowered and the trailing raised to collect current, since if the rear pantograph failed it would not strike the forward pantograph. A transformer between the two cabs stepped down the 11,000 V to the voltages needed for the traction motors and other equipment. Twelve GEA-627-A1 traction motors (AC commutator motors, not AC induction motors \\"In 1935, the PRR introduced the GG1 2-C+C-2 type... The PRR relied on the single phase commutator motor...\\"; ELECTRIC RAILWAYS 1880-1990, Michael Duffy, Institution of Engineering and Technology, London, England. 2003, p253. \\") drove the GG1's diameter driving wheels on six axles using a quill drive. The power required was such that were used, with two motors driving each axle. The traction motors were six-pole field, 400 volts, 25 Hz rated each at . The motors were frame-mounted using quill drives to the sprung driving wheels providing a flexible suspension system across a relatively long locomotive frame which allowed full wheel weight to rest on the rail for good traction regardless of track condition. A series wound commutator motor's speed is increased by increasing the applied voltage to the motor thus increasing the current through the motor's armature which is necessary for increasing its torque, thus increasing motor speed.Middleton, Wm: Appendix, The Interurban Erahttps:// The wound armature motor's high starting torque; need for a low-high voltage system to control armature current for speed control; Section 2, p31, Applications Manual for NEMA Motors, Siemans AG, Munich, Germany. The engineer's cab had a 21 position controller for applying voltage to the motors. Four unpowered leading/trailing wheels were mounted on each end of the locomotive. =Steam generation for heating= At the time of the GG1's introduction, railroad passenger cars required steam from the locomotive to operate heating equipment. The GG1 had an oil fired boiler to provide this steam to the train's \\"steam line.\\"See sidebar data. History Beginning in the early 1910s, the Pennsylvania received the FF1 but decided it was too slow for passenger trains and was relegated to heavy freight service. In the mid 1920s, they received the L5 electric which had third rail power supply at the time. When the Pennsylvania built the O1 and the P5, they chose the P5 over the O1 for its ability and power on the rails. After a grade crossing accident with the P5, the cab was moved to the center and was designated P5a. Pennsylvania still searched for the ultimate electric since the P5 did not track well at high speeds and were wondering if the P5a could be improved even further. Soon enough, the Pennsylvania was in luck and found two contacts as early as 1932. The mechanical design of the GG1 was based largely on the New Haven EP3, which had been borrowed earlier from the New Haven Railroad by the PRR to compare it to its current standard electric locomotive, the P5a. In 1933, the PRR decided to replace its P5a locomotives and told General Electric and Westinghouse to design prototype locomotives with the following specifications: a lighter axle load and more power than the P5a, a top speed of at least , a streamlined body design and a single (central) control cab. GG1 locomotive circa 1940 Both companies delivered their prototypes to PRR in August 1934. General Electric submitted the GG1 and Westinghouse submitted the R1. The R1 was essentially \\"little more than an elongated and more powerful version of the P5a\\" with an AAR wheel arrangement of 2-D-2. Both locomotives were tested for ten weeks in regular service between New York and Philadelphia and on a test track in Claymont, Delaware. Because the R1's rigid wheelbase prevented it from negotiating sharp curves and some railroad switches, PRR chose the GG1 and ordered 57 additional locomotives on November 10, 1934. Of the 57, 14 were to be built by General Electric in Erie and 18 at the Altoona Works. The remaining 20 locomotives were to be assembled in Altoona with electrical components from Westinghouse in East Pittsburgh and chassis from the Baldwin Locomotive Works in Eddystone.\\"$15,000,000 order\\" An additional 81 locomotives were then built at Altoona between 1937 and 1943. On January 28, 1935, to mark the completion of the electric line from Washington, D.C. to New York City, PRR ran a special train pulled by PRR 4800 before it opened the line for revenue service on February 10. It made a round trip from D.C. to Philadelphia and, on its return trip, set a speed record by arriving back in D.C. 1 hour and 50 minutes after its departure from Philadelphia. In 1945, a Pennsylvania GG1 pulled the funeral train of President Franklin D. Roosevelt from Washington, D.C.'s Union Station to New York City's Pennsylvania Station.FDR's Funeral Train by Robert Klara In the mid-1950s, with declining demand for passenger train service, GG1s 4801‚Äì4857 were re-geared for a maximum speed of and placed in freight service. They initially retained their train heating steam generator, and were recalled to passenger service for holiday season mail trains, and 'Passenger Extras' such as those run for the annual Army‚ÄìNavy football game in Philadelphia. Pennsylvania Railroad GG-1 4899 at Newark, NJ in September 1964 A Penn Central GG1 with The Afternoon Congressional, at Washington, DC Union Station on January 18, 1969 Timetable speed limit for the GG1 was 75-80 mph until October 1967 when some were allowed 100 mph for a couple of years; when Metroliner cars were being overhauled in the late 1970s, GG1s were again allowed 100 mph for a short time when pulling Amfleet cars on trains scheduled to run 224.6 miles from New York to Washington in 3 hours, 20‚Äì25 minutes. On June 8, 1968, two Penn Central GG1s pulled Robert F. Kennedy's funeral train. =Shell design= The first designer for the GG1 project was industrial designer Donald Roscoe Dohner, who produced initial scale styling models, although the completed prototype looked somewhat different. At some point, PRR hired famed industrial designer Raymond Loewy to \\"enhance the GG1's aesthetics.\\" The final design is retrospectively 'Art Deco' as we know it today. Although it was thought until 2009 that Loewy was solely responsible for the GG1's styling, Dohner is now understood to have contributed as well. (Dohner's GG1 designs influenced the modified P5as, which debuted before the GG1 ‚Äî not, as was thought, the other way around.) Loewy did claim that he recommended the use of a smooth, welded body instead of riveted one used in the prototype. Loewy also added five gold pinstripes and a Brunswick green paint scheme. In 1952, the paint scheme was changed to Tuscan red; three years later, the pinstripes were simplified to a single stripe and large red keystones were added. =Incidents= On January 15, 1953, train 173, the overnight Federal from Boston, was approaching Washington behind GG1 4876. The train passed a signal north of Union Station between , and the engineer decreased the throttle and started applying the brakes.\\"Accident at Union Station\\", p. 6. When the engineer realized that the train was not slowing down, and applying the emergency brake had no effect, he sounded the engine's horn. A signalman, hearing the horn and noting the speed of the 4876, phoned ahead to the station master's office. 4876 negotiated several switches without derailing, at speeds well over the safe speed limits and entered the station at around .\\"Accident at Union Station\\", p. 5. The train demolished the bumping post, continued through the station master's office and into the concourse where it fell through the floor into the station's basement. Thanks to the evacuation of the concourse, there were no fatalities in the station, or aboard the train. A temporary floor was erected over the engine, and the hole it created, for the inauguration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. 4876 was eventually dismantled, removed from the basement and reassembled in Altoona. It survives in the B&O; Railroad Museum in Baltimore. The accident was determined to have been caused by a closed \\"angle cock\\", a valve on the front and rear of all locomotives and rail cars used in the train's airbrake system, on the rear of the third car in the train.\\"Accident at Union Station\\", p. 13. The handle of the angle cock had been improperly placed and had contacted the bottom of the car. Once it was closed the air brake pipe on all the cars behind the closed valve remained at full pressure, keeping the brakes released on those cars while the brakes on the locomotive and first three cars were applied in emergency.\\"Accident at Union Station, p. 14. This was the only major wreck involving a GG1 in the entirety of its 49-year career. The only major electro-mechanical breakdown of the GG1 was caused by a blizzard which swept across the northeastern United States in February 1958. The storm put nearly half of the GG1s out of commission. Exceptionally fine snow, caused by the extreme low temperatures, was able to pass through the traction motors' air filters and into the electrical components. When the snow melted it short circuited the components. On about 40 units, the air intakes were moved to a position under the pantographs. =Disposition= Amtrak 904 westbound at Harrison, New Jersey in June 1975 In 1968 the PRR with its 119 surviving GG1s merged with the New York Central Railroad to form Penn Central. After its creation in 1971, Amtrak purchased 30 for $50,000 each, and leased 21, of which 11 were for use on New York and Long Branch commuter trains. Amtrak renumbered the purchased GG1s #900‚Äì929 as a solid block, later renumbered with a prefix \\"4\\". The leased units with conflicting numbers were then renumbered 4930‚Äì4939, except 4935 which kept its old PRR/PC number. Amtrak attempted to replace the GG1s in 1975 with the General Electric E60, but they were not a success: a derailment during testing had to be investigated (the E60 used the same trucks as the P30CH diesel then in service with Amtrak), which delayed acceptance, and the hoped-for service speed was never achieved (timetable limit was 90 mph, then 80, then 90). It was not until Amtrak imported two lightweight European locomotives ‚Äì X995, an Rc4a built by ASEA of Sweden and X996, a French design ‚Äì that a replacement was found. The ASEA design, initially nicknamed the \\"Swedish swifty\\",Burks 1980 or the \\"Mighty Mouse\\"‚Äîand later referred to often as the \\"Swedish Meatball\\"‚Äîwas the winning design. Electro-Motive Diesel, then a part of General Motors, was licensed to build it and it became the basis of the AEM-7. With AEM-7s on hand, Amtrak finally replaced its GG1s. GG1 service on Amtrak ended on April 26, 1980. Penn Central went bankrupt in 1970 and its freight operations were later assumed by government-controlled Conrail, which used 68 GG1s in freight service until the end of electric traction in 1980. The last GG1s in use were some of the 13 assigned to New Jersey Transit (#4872‚Äì4884) for its North Jersey Coast Line between New York and South Amboy (the former New York and Long Branch) that ran until October 29, 1983, thus retiring the locomotive after 49 years of service. Preservation Fifteen production locomotives and the prototype were preserved in museums. None are operational, as they had to have their main transformers removed due to the presence of PCB's in the insulating oil.

While other railroads were introducing streamlined trains, like the Union Pacific's M-10000 or the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad with the Zephyr, the PRR had the GG1. The GG1 has \\"shown up over the years in more advertisements and movie clips than any other locomotive.\\" It was also featured in art calendars provided by PRR, which were used to \\"promote its reputation in the public eye.\\" It has appeared in the films Broadway Limited in 1941, The Clock in 1945, Blast of Silence in 1961, the 1962 version of The Manchurian Candidate, and Avalon in 1990 in the PRR paint scheme.Broadway Limited, 60:07, 60:09The Clock, 01:14.Blast of Silence, 01:30.The Manchurian Candidate, 41:56.Avalon, 66:37.

Ise, Mie Prefecture. IseWashi makes washi for Ise Jing≈´. is traditional Japanese paper. The word \\"washi\\" comes from Wa meaning 'Japanese' and shi meaning 'paper'. The term is used to describe paper that uses local fiber, processed by hand and made in the traditional manner. Washi is made using fibers from the inner bark of the gampi tree, the mitsumata shrub (Edgeworthia chrysantha), or the paper mulberry (k≈çzo) bush. As a Japanese craft, it is registered as a UNESCO intangible cultural heritage.Government, paper makers welcome addition of ‚Äòwashi‚Äô to UNESCO list Washi is generally tougher than ordinary paper made from wood pulp, and is used in many traditional arts. Origami, Shodo, and Ukiyo-e were all produced using washi. Washi was also used to make various everyday goods like clothes, household goods, and toys, as well as vestments and ritual objects for Shinto priests and statues of Buddha. It was even used to make wreaths that were given to winners in the 1998 Winter Paralympics. Several kinds of washi, referred to collectively as Japanese tissue, are used in the conservation and mending of books. Manufacture Washi is produced in a way similar to that of ordinary paper, but relies heavily on manual methods. It involves a long and intricate process that is often undertaken in the cold weather of winter, as pure, cold running water is essential to the production of washi. Cold inhibits bacteria, preventing the decomposition of the fibres. Cold also makes the fibres contract, producing a crisp feel to the paper. It is traditionally the winter work of farmers, a task that supplemented a farmer's income. Paper mulberry is the most commonly used fiber in making Japanese paper. The mulberry branches are boiled and stripped of their outer bark, and then dried. The fibers are then boiled with lye to remove the starch, fat and tannin, and then placed in running water to remove the spent lye. The fibers are then bleached (either with chemicals or naturally, by placing it in a protected area of a stream) and any remaining impurities in the fibers are picked out by hand. The product is laid on a rock or board and beaten. Wet balls of pulp are mixed in a vat with water and a formation aid to help keep the long fibers spread evenly. This is traditionally neri, which is a mucilaginous material made from the roots of the tororo aoi plant, or PEO, polyethylene oxide. One of two traditional methods of paper making (nagashi-zuki or tame-zuki) is employed. In both methods, pulp is scooped onto a screen and shaken to spread the fibers evenly. Nagashi-zuki (which uses neri in the vat) produces a thinner paper, while tame-zuki (which does not use neri) produces a thicker paper. Types With enough processing, almost any grass or tree can be made into a washi. Gampi, mitsumata, and paper mulberry are three popular sources. * ‚Äì In ancient times, it was called . Ganpishi has a smooth, shiny surface and is used for books and crafts. * ‚Äì K≈çzogami is made from paper mulberry and is the most widely made type of washi.

It was used to print paper money in Meiji period. Applications Until the early 20th century, the Japanese used washi in applications where Western style paper or other materials are currently used. This is partly because washi was the only type of paper available at that time in Japan, but also because the unique characteristics of washi made it a better material.

Route Mableton, GA The Silver Comet Trail is named for the Silver Comet passenger train that traversed the same route from 1947 to 1969. It begins in Smyrna, Georgia, runs west through Cobb, Paulding and Polk counties, and continues as Alabama's Chief Ladiga Trail at the state line. The Silver Comet and Chief Ladiga trails join to form one continuous trail from Smyrna, Georgia to Anniston, Alabama, which together form the second longest paved rail trail in the U.S.Path Foundation Newsletter U.S. Bicycle Route 21 follows a portion of Silver Comet Trail from Cedartown to the east end of the trail. The trail is locally known as an ideal destination for bikers and runners to train or relax. History In 1947, the Silver Comet was introduced by the Seaboard Air Line Railroad (SAL) during the height of passenger rail use. Due to declining ridership, the Silver Comet was downgraded in the 1960s, losing its sleeper-lounger cars. In 1969, the Silver Comet was downgraded again and finally discontinued in June of that year, by SAL successor Seaboard Coast Line (SCL). By 1986 SCL had gradually merged with several nearby railroads, forming the Seaboard System, which had become CSX Transportation by July 1987. CSX abandoned of the former Silver Comet route from Cobb County through Paulding and Polk counties in 1989. In 1992, the Georgia Department of Transportation initially purchased the former roadbed for future use as a high-speed transit route, but later that year, Ron Griffith, Director of Cobb County Parks, requested a lease agreement between the county and the Georgia DOT to use the rail line as a multi-use trail. The Cobb County Board of Commissioners approved the multi-use trail plan in November. Construction began in July 1998, with the initial section between Nickajack Creek and Hicks Road opening by that November. The former SAL/SCL right of way is rail banked. This means at any time in the future, if rail traffic increases to the point where an old line exists, it could be purchased and track put back down and the right of way, would thus become a Class 1 railroad again. The former SAL/SCL line is 78 miles shorter than the line CSXT now uses, the former ACL and Atlanta & West Point lines which runs well south of the former SAL/SCL line. In September 2019 the James M. Cox Foundation gave $6 Million to the PATH Foundation which will connect the Silver Comet Trail to The Atlanta Beltline which is expected to be completed by 2022. Upon completion, the total combined interconnected trail distance around Atlanta for The Atlanta BeltLine and Silver Comet Trail will be the longest paved trail surface in the U.S. totaling about 300 Miles (480km). Geology In Paulding County, the Silver Comet Trail crosses over the Allatoona Fault; where the trail intersects the fault in the vicinity of Willow Springs Road, the fault serves to divide the distinctive Eastern Blue Ridge rocks from those that most characterize the Western Blue Ridge Province. One rock formation of particular note in Paulding County is the Ordovician-age Pumpkinvine Creek Formation (PCF), primarily composed of metamorphosed volcanic rocks thought to have originated out in the now-vanished, ancient ocean that geologists generally refer to as Iapetus.Holm-Denoma, Christopher S., 2006, Florida State University Ph.D. dissertation entitled: CHARACTERIZATION OF PALEOZOIC TERRANES AND TERRANE ACCRETION AT THE SOUTHEASTERN MARGIN OF LAURENTIA: GEORGIA AND ALABAMA APPALACHIANS The meta-volcanic rocks of the PCF are believed to be remnants of the sort of so-called \\"accreted terranes\\" described above, and exposures of PCF rocks can be found on the Silver Comet Trail near the Allatoona Fault.

The poem was written in the 1930s by the Chinese linguist Yuen Ren Chao as a linguistic demonstration. The poem is coherent and grammatical in Classical Chinese, but due to the number of Chinese homophones, it becomes difficult to understand in oral speech. In Mandarin, the poem is incomprehensible when read aloud, since only four syllables cover all the words of the poem. The poem is more comprehensible‚Äîbut still not very intelligible‚Äîwhen read in other varieties of Chinese such as Cantonese, in which it has 22 different syllables, or Hokkien Chinese, in which it has 15 different syllables. The poem is an example of a one-syllable article, a form of constrained writing possible in tonal languages such as Mandarin Chinese, where tonal contours expand the range of meaning for a single syllable. Explanation Chinese is a tonal language in which subtle changes in pronunciation could change the meaning. In Romanized script, the poem is an example of Chinese antanaclasis. The poem shows the flexibility of the Chinese language in many ways, including wording, syntax, punctuation and sentence structures, which gives rise to various explanations. The poem can be interpreted as an objection to the Romanization of Chinese. The 20th-century author Yuen Ren Chao used this poem as an example to object to the use of vernacular Classical Chinese which is used less in conversational daily lifeclassical Chinese is more written than spoken. The poem is easy to understand when read in its written form in Chinese characters, due to each character being associated with a different core meaning. It is also intelligible in its spoken form in Sinitic languages besides Mandarin. However, when in its Romanized form or spoken Mandarin form, it becomes confusing. = Evolution = The loss of older sound combinations in Chinese over the centuries has greatly increased the number of Chinese homophones. Many words in the passage had distinct sounds in Middle Chinese, but over time, all of the variants of spoken Chinese have merged and split different sounds. For example, when the same passage is read in Cantonese (even modern Cantonese) there are seven distinct syllables‚Äîci, sai, sap, sat, sek, si, sik‚Äîin six distinct tone contours, producing 22 distinct character pronunciations. In Southern Min, there are six distinct syllables‚Äîse, si, su, sek, sip, sit‚Äîin seven distinct tone contours, producing fifteen character pronunciations. Therefore, the passage is barely comprehensible when read aloud in modern Mandarin without context, but easier to understand when read in other Sinitic languages, such as Cantonese.

She was named in honor of Philip Van Horne Lansdale. History Lansdale was laid down on 20 April 1918 by Fore River Shipbuilding Corporation, Quincy, Massachusetts. The ship was launched on 21 July 1918, sponsored by Mrs. Ethel S. Lansdale, widow of Lieutenant Lansdale. The destroyer was commissioned on 26 October 1918 at Boston, Comdr. C. W. Margruder in command. Assigned to the Cruiser and Transport Force, Lansdale steamed to Norfolk from 4 November to 7 November and joined a European bound convoy as escort on 12 November. Sailing via the Azores, she reached Gibraltar on 26 November for patrol duty in the Mediterranean Sea. Operating out of Gibraltar until January 1919, she made three voyages to Tangier, Morocco, and one to Algiers, Algeria. Steaming to Venice from 4 January to 13 January, she joined the U.S. Naval Force operating the eastern Mediterranean. She performed dispatch duty in the Adriatic Sea, principally between Venice and the ports of Austria (on the Croatian coast). On 1 April 1919, she was in Spalato, now Split, with and .https://www.naval- history.net/OWShips-WW1-06-HMS_Cardiff.htm Departing Split, Croatia (then Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes on 10 June, she steamed to Gibraltar and the Azores and reached New York on 22 June. During the next year Lansdale operated along the Atlantic coast with Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet. Arriving at Philadelphia on 11 July 1920, she was converted to a light minelayer and reclassified DM-6. She steamed to Newport, Rhode Island from 2 June to 3 June 1921; joined the Mine Force, Atlantic Fleet on 5 July at Gloucester, Massachusetts; and until late October practiced laying mines off the New England and Virginia coasts under the command of Lt. Cmdr. Laurance T. DuBose. After overhaul at Boston, she steamed to Guantanamo Bay from 4 January to 9 January 1922 for maneuvers, mining exercises, and war games in the West Indies with Mine Squadron 1. Departing Culebra Island on 19 April, she arrived at Philadelphia on 25 April and decommissioned on 25 June. Lansdale recommissioned on 1 May 1930 at Philadelphia, Comdr. Frank R. Berg in command. She joined Mine Squadron 1 at Yorktown on 17 May; engaged in mining and tactical exercises along the eastern seaboard; then arrived at New London, Connecticut on 30 September to serve as target ship for submarines. She departed on 12 November; and, after visiting Boston, she arrived at Philadelphia on 22 December. Remaining there, Lansdale decommissioned on 24 March 1931. On 28 December 1936 she was reduced to a hulk for disposal in accordance with the London Treaty for limitation and reduction of naval armaments. Her name was struck from the Naval Register on 25 January 1937, and she was sold on 16 March 1939 to Union Shipbuilding Company, Baltimore, Maryland.

It is a re-engined and more voluminous version of the original A√©rospatiale SA 330 Puma. First flying in 1978, the Super Puma succeeded the SA 330 Puma as the main production model of the type in 1980. Since 1990, Super Pumas in military service have been marketed under the AS532 Cougar designation. In civilian service, a next generation successor to the AS 332 was introduced in 2004, the further-enlarged Eurocopter EC225 Super Puma. Development =Origins= In 1974, A√©rospatiale commenced development of a new medium transport helicopter based on its SA 330 Puma. The project was publicly announced at the 1975 Paris Air Show. While the new design maintained a similar generator layout to the preceding AS 330, it was powered by two of the new and more powerful Turbomeca Makila turboshaft engines, which drove a four-bladed main rotor which made use of composite materials. A great level of attention was paid to making the new model better withstand damage. A more robust fuselage structure was adopted along with a new crashworthy undercarriage, the rotor blades are also able to withstand a level of battle damage, as are the other key mechanical systems across the rotorcraft.Jackson 1984, pp. 7‚Äì10. External distinguishing features from the SA 330 include a ventral fin underneath the tail boom and a more streamlined nose.Lake 2002, p.82. From the onset, the new rotorcraft was planned to be available with two fuselage lengths; these were a short fuselage version that offered a similar capacity to the SA 330 while providing superior performance under \\"hot and high\\" conditions, and a stretched version which allowed for more internal cargo or passengers to be carried in circumstances where aircraft weight was less critical.Jackson 1984, p. 11. A pre-production prototype, the SA 331, modified from a SA 330 airframe with Makila engines and a new gearbox flew on 5 September 1977.Jackson 1984, p.10. The first prototype of the full Super Puma made its maiden flight on 13 September 1978, being followed by a further five prototypes. Flight testing revealed that in comparison with the SA 330 Puma, the AS 330 Super Puma had a higher cruise speed and range, in part due to the Makila engine having a greater power output and a 17% reduction in fuel consumption per mile. The Super Puma also demonstrated far superior flight stabilisation tendencies and was less reliant on automated corrective systems.Lambert 1979, pp. 437, 439. The development of the military and civil variants was carried out in parallel, including the certification process.Lambert 1979, p. 437. In 1981 the first civil Super Puma was delivered.Endres and Gething 2005, p. 272. =Production and improvements= In 1980, the AS 332 Super Puma had replaced the older SA 330 Puma as Aerospatiale's primary utility helicopter.McGowen 2005, p. 194. The AS 332 Super Puma proved to be highly popular. Between July 1981 and April 1987 there was an average production rate of three helicopters per month being built for customers, both military and civil.Sedbon, Gary. \\"Aerospatiale develops Super Puma II.\\" Flight International, 18 April 1987. p. 12. Indonesian Aerospace (IPTN) has also manufactured both the SA 330 and AS 332 under license from Aerospatiale for domestic and some overseas customers. By 2005 various models of Super Puma had been in operation with customers across 38 nations for a wide variety of purposes.McGowen 2005, p. 195. In total, 565 Super Pumas (including military-orientated Cougars) had been delivered or were on order at this point as well.Endres and Gething 2005, p. 487. The success of the AS 332 Super Puma led to the pursuit of extended development programs to produce further advanced models. Features included lengthened rotor blades, more powerful engines and gearboxes, increases in takeoff weight, and modernised avionics. A wide variety of specialised Super Puma variants followed the basic transport model into use, including dedicated Search and rescue (SAR) and Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) versions. Military Super Pumas have been marketed as the AS532 Cougar since 1990. As a fallback option to the NHIndustries NH90, a Mark III Super Puma was also considered for development. In February 2012, Eurocopter offered a lower cost basic Super Puma configuration in order to better compete with the Russian-built Mil Mi-17.Pyadushkin, Maxim and Robert Wall. \\"Mil Mi-171, Super Puma To Do Battle.\\" Aviation Week, 13 February 2012.

Design A French Army AS332 Super Puma, 1999. The AS332 Super Puma is powered by a pair of Turbomeca Makila 1A1 turboshaft engines which drive the rotorcraft's four- bladed main rotor and five-bladed tail rotor as well two separate hydraulic systems and a pair of electrical alternators. Fuel is housed in six internal fuel tanks, additional auxiliary and external tanks can be equipped for extended flight endurance. For safety, the fuel tanks use a crashworthy plumbing design and fire detection and suppression systems are installed in the engine bay. The monocoque tail boom is fitted with tail rotor strike protection, the forward portion of the boom accommodated a luggage compartment. The retractable tricycle landing gear is designed for high energy absorption qualities.\\"AS332 L1e Technical Data ‚Äì 2015.\\" Airbus Helicopters, 2015. The main cabin of the Super Puma, which is accessed via two sliding plug doors, used a reconfigurable floor arrangement, various passenger seating or cargo configurations can be adopted, including specialised configurations for medical operators. According to Airbus Helicopters, in addition to the two pilots, the short-fuselage AS332 can accommodate up to 15 passengers while the stretched-fuselage AS332 increases this to 20 passengers in a comfortable configuration.\\"Civil Range.\\" Airbus Helicopters, 2015. Soundproof upholstery is installed, as is separately-adjustable heating and ventilation systems. Along with the doors, 12 windows around the main cabin area are jettisonable for emergency exits. The lower fuselage can also be fitted with flotation gear. A hatch in the floor to access the cargo sling pole is present in the cabin, as is individual stowage space for airborne equipment. The flight control system of the Super Puma uses a total of 4 dual-body servo units for pitch control of the cyclic, collective, and tail rotor. A duplex digital autopilot is also incorporated. The cockpit is equipped with dual flight controls. Principle instrumentation constitutes of four multifunction liquid crystal displays along with two display and autopilot control panels; for redundancy, a single Integrated Standby Instrument System (ISIS) and Vehicle Monitoring System (VMS) are also fitted. According to Airbus Helicopters, the avionics installed upon later variants has ensured a high level of operational safety. Third party firms have offered various upgrades for the Super Puma, these have included integrated flight management systems, global positioning systems (GPS) receivers, a digital map display, flight data recorders, an anti-collision warning system, Night Vision Goggles-compatibility, and multiple radios.Morris, John. \\"RUAG Aviation Shows Super Puma Upgrade.\\" Aviation Week, 11 September 2012.Osborne, Tony. \\"Adding On Capabilities For Combat Helicopters In Europe.\\" Aviation Week, 25 March 2013.\\"CHC's Heli-One Group Awarded Swedish Military Super Puma Upgrade Contract.\\" CHC Helicopters, 30 March 2006. A navalised variant of the Super Puma has also been manufactured for performing anti-submarine warfare and anti-surface warfare missions. In such a configuration, the Super Puma is modified with additional corrosion protection, a folding tail rotor boom, a deck-landing guidance system, sonar equipment, and the nose-mounted Omera search radar. For the anti-surface role, it can be armed with a pair of Exocet anti-ship missiles.\\"Military Aircraft of the World.\\" Flight International, 1 August 1987. p. 24.

In August 1983, the French government created a new reactionary taskforce, the Force d'Action Rapide, to support France's allies as well as to contribute to France's overseas engagements in Africa and the Middle East; up to 30 Super Pumas were assigned to the taskforce.Chipman 1985, pp. 19‚Äì20. In June 1994, France staged a military intervention in the ongoing Rwandan genocide, dispatching a military task force to neighboring Zaire; Super Pumas provided the bulk of the task force's rotary lift capability, transporting French troops and equipment during their advance into Rwanda.Charbonneau 2008, pp. 140‚Äì141. By 2015, 187 Super Pumas had been reportedly ordered by military customers; amongst others, the orders included 29 for Argentina, 30 for Spain, 33 for Indonesia, 22 for Singapore and 12 for Greece. During the 1980s, the French Army were interested in mounting an airborne battlefield surveillance radar upon the Super Puma. The first prototype Orchid√©e was assembled at Aerospatiale's Marignane factory and began testing in late 1988; the French Army intended to procure 20 aircraft to equip two squadrons. Orchid√©e was described as having a pulse-Doppler radar mounted on the fuselage's underside, being capable of 360-degree scanning to detect low flying helicopters and ground vehicles at ranges of up to 150 km; gathered data was to be relayed in real time to mobile ground stations via a single- channel data link for processing and analysis before being transmitted to battlefield commanders. The system was said to be capable of all-weather operation, and would feature protection against counteracting hostile electronic countermeasures.Sedbon, Gilbert. \\"France develops Battlefield Radar.\\" Flight International, 18 June 1988. p. 17.

The Large Magellanic Cloud, which closely orbits the Milky Way and contains over 30 billion stars, is sometimes classified as a dwarf galaxy; others consider it a full-fledged galaxy. Dwarf galaxies' formation and activity are thought to be heavily influenced by interactions with larger galaxies. Astronomers identify numerous types of dwarf galaxies, based on their shape and composition.  Formation  Dwarf galaxies like NGC 5264 typically possess around a billion stars. One theory states that most galaxies, including dwarf galaxies, form in association with dark matter, or from gas that contains metals. However, NASA's Galaxy Evolution Explorer space probe identified new dwarf galaxies forming out of gases with low metallicity. These galaxies were located in the Leo Ring, a cloud of hydrogen and helium around two massive galaxies in the constellation Leo. Because of their small size, dwarf galaxies have been observed being pulled toward and ripped by neighbouring spiral galaxies, resulting in galaxy merger. Local dwarf galaxies Phoenix Dwarf Galaxy is a dwarf irregular galaxy, featuring younger stars in its inner regions and older ones at its outskirts. There are many dwarf galaxies in the Local Group; these small galaxies frequently orbit larger galaxies, such as the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy and the Triangulum Galaxy. A 2007 paper has suggested that many dwarf galaxies were created by galactic tides during the early evolutions of the Milky Way and Andromeda. Tidal dwarf galaxies are produced when galaxies collide and their gravitational masses interact. Streams of galactic material are pulled away from the parent galaxies and the halos of dark matter that surround them. A 2018 study suggests that some local dwarf galaxies formed extremely early, during the Dark Ages within the first billion years after the big bang. More than 20 known dwarf galaxies orbit the Milky Way, and recent observations have also led astronomers to believe the largest globular cluster in the Milky Way, Omega Centauri, is in fact the core of a dwarf galaxy with a black hole at its centre, which was at some time absorbed by the Milky Way. Common types UGC 11411 is a galaxy known as an irregular blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxy. * Elliptical galaxy: dwarf elliptical galaxy (dE) * Dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph): Once a subtype of dwarf ellipticals, now regarded as a distinct type * Irregular galaxy: dwarf irregular galaxy (dIrr) * Spiral galaxy: dwarf spiral galaxy (dS) * Magellanic type dwarfs * Blue compact dwarf galaxies (see section below) * Ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (see section below) Blue compact dwarf galaxies Blue compact dwarf PGC 51017. In astronomy, a blue compact dwarf galaxy (BCD galaxy) is a small galaxy which contains large clusters of young, hot, massive stars. These stars, the brightest of which are blue, causes the galaxy itself to appear blue in colour. Most BCD galaxies are also classified as dwarf irregular galaxies or as dwarf lenticular galaxies. Because they are composed of star clusters, BCD galaxies lack a uniform shape. They consume gas intensely, which causes their stars to become very violent when forming. BCD galaxies cool in the process of forming new stars. The galaxies' stars are all formed at different time periods, so the galaxies have time to cool and to build up matter to form new stars. As time passes, this star formation changes the shape of the galaxies. Nearby examples include NGC 1705, NGC 2915, NGC 3353 and UGCA 281. Ultra-compact dwarfs Ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCD) are a class of very compact galaxies with very high stellar densities, discovered in the 2000s. They are thought to be on the order of 200 light years across, containing about 100 million stars.Anglo- Australian Observatory Astronomers discover dozens of mini-galaxies 0100 AEST Friday 2 April 2004. It is theorised that these are the cores of nucleated dwarf elliptical galaxies that have been stripped of gas and outlying stars by tidal interactions, travelling through the hearts of rich clusters. UCDs have been found in the Virgo Cluster, Fornax Cluster, Abell 1689, and the Coma Cluster, amongst others. In particular, an unprecedentedly large sample of ~ 100 UCDs has been found in the core region of the Virgo cluster by the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey team. The first ever relatively robust studies of the global properties of Virgo UCDs suggest that UCDs have distinct dynamical and structural properties from normal globular clusters. An extreme example of UCD is M60-UCD1, about 54 million light years away, which contains approximately 200 million solar masses within a 160 light year radius; its central region packs in stars about 25 times closer together than stars in Earth's region in the Milky Way. M59-UCD3 is approximately the same size as M60-UCD1 with a half-light radius, rh, of approximately 20 parsecs but is 40% more luminous with an absolute visual magnitude of approximately ‚àí14.6. This makes M59-UCD3 the densest known galaxy. Based on stellar orbital velocities, two UCD in the Virgo Cluster are claimed to have supermassive black holes weighing 13% and 18% of the galaxies' masses.

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) car size class definition, the subcompact category sits between minicompact and compact categories. The EPA definition of a subcompact is a passenger car with a combined interior and cargo volume of between . Current examples of subcompact cars are the Ford Fiesta and Chevrolet Sonic. The smaller cars in the A-segment / city car category (such as the Chevrolet Spark and Smart Fortwo) are sometimes called subcompacts in the U.S., because the EPA's name for this smaller category‚Äî minicompact‚Äî is not commonly used by the general public. The prevalence of small cars in the United States increased in the 1960s due to increased imports of cars from Europe and Japan. Widespread use of the term subcompact coincided with the early 1970s increase in subcompact cars built in the United States. Early 1970s subcompacts include the AMC Gremlin, Chevrolet Vega and Ford Pinto. History = 1960s = The term subcompact originated during the 1960s, however it came into popular use in the early 1970s, as car manufacturers in the United States began to introduce smaller cars into their line-up. Previously, cars in this size were variously categorized, including \\"small cars\\" and \\"economy cars\\". Several of these small cars were produced in the U.S. in limited volumes, including the 1930 American Austin (later called the American Bantam) and the 1939 Crosley. From the 1950s onwards, various imported small cars were sold in the U.S., including the Nash Metropolitan, Volkswagen Beetle and various small British cars. = 1970s = Due to the increasing popularity of small cars imported from Europe and Japan during the late 1960s, the American manufacturers began releasing competing locally-built models in the early 1970s. The AMC Gremlin was described at its April 1970 introduction as \\"the first American-built import\\" and the first U.S. built subcompact car. Also introduced in 1970 were the Chevrolet Vega and Ford Pinto. Sales of American-built \\"low weight cars\\" (including subcompacts) accounted for more than 30% of total car sales in 1972 and 1973, despite inventory shortages for several models. The Gremlin, Pinto and Vega were all rear-wheel drive and available with four-cylinder engines (the Pinto was also available with a six-cylinder engine, and the Gremlin was also available with six-cylinder and V8 engines). The Pontiac Astre, the Canadian-born re-badged Vega variant was released in the U.S. September 1974. Due to falling sales of the larger pony cars (such as the Chevrolet Camaro and first generation Ford Mustang) in the mid-1970s, the Vega-based Chevrolet Monza was introduced as an upscale subcompact and the Ford Mustang II temporarily downsized from the pony car class to become a subcompact car for its second generation. The Monza with its GM variants Pontiac Sunbird, Buick Skyhawk, Oldsmobile Starfire, and the Mustang II continued until the end of the decade. The Chevrolet Chevette was GM's new entry-level subcompact introduced as a 1976 model. It was an 'Americanized' design from Opel, GM's German subsidiary. And then there were subcompacts that were imported but sold through a domestic manufacturers dealer network Captive imports, the Renault Le Car and the Ford Fiesta In 1977, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began to use a new vehicle classification system, based on interior volume instead of exterior size. This resulted in cars previously classified as subcompact (such as the AMC Gremlin, Ford Pinto and Chevrolet Vega) now being classified as compact cars, and a smaller group of cars now being classified as subcompact. In 1978, Volkswagen began producing the \\"Rabbit\\" version of the Golf‚Äî a modern, front- wheel drive design‚Äî in Pennsylvania. In 1982, American Motors began manufacturing the U.S. Renault Alliance‚Äî a version of the Renault 9‚Äî in Wisconsin. Both models benefiting from European designs, development, and experience. = 1980s = To replace the aging Chevette in the second half of the 1980s, Chevrolet introduced marketed imported front-wheel drive subcompact cars: the Suzuki Cultus (a three-cylinder hatchback, badged as the Chevrolet Sprint) and the Isuzu Gemini (a four-cylinder hatchback/sedan badged as the Chevrolet Spectrum). = 1990s = During the 1990s GM offered the Geo brand featuring the Suzuki-built Metro subcompact. = 2000s to present = Because of consumer demand for fuel-efficient cars during the late-2000s, sales of subcompact cars made it the fastest growing market category in the U.S. , numerous models of subcompacts were sold in North America. As of 2012, the Chevrolet Sonic was the only subcompact fully assembled in the United States. Imported subcompact cars include Korean models such as the Hyundai Accent and Kia Rio along with Japanese models such as the Honda Fit, Mazda 2 (discontinued after 2014), Nissan Micra, Scion xD (discontinued 2016), Suzuki Swift (produced and sold only in Mexico), Toyota Yaris and Toyota Prius C (discontinued after 2017) European made models are limited but include Mini Cooper, Fiat 500 (to be discontinued in 2020) and Smart Fortwo (discontinued after 2019) Ford reintroduced the Ford Fiesta in the North American market in 2010 but discontinued it in 2019. The cars were produced in Mexico. Low gas prices and the added room in SUVs contributed to a 50 percent drop in sales of subcompacts in the first half of 2020 compared to 2019. In June Toyota dropped the Yaris and in July Chevrolet discontinued the Sonic.

He was born in Hardin County, Kentucky, near the same area where Abraham Lincoln was born. In 1830, he went to St. Louis and from there to Springfield, Illinois, where in 1832 he was a partner of Abraham Lincoln in flatboating on the Sangamon River. He also fought in the Black Hawk War in Illinois where he was a Lieutenant and Abraham Lincoln was a private under his command. They were mustered into service by then Lt. Robert Anderson of later fame as Major Robert Anderson in command of Fort Sumter at start of Civil War. Lincoln became a surveyor for Sangamon County and Glasscock was a surveyor in Texas but it is not known if the two learned their surveyor skills together. George's sister stayed in Illinois and married a friend of Lincoln's law partner, Herndon. His sister's husband is quoted as saying he had received a letter from George in 1865 and that he stated Lincoln had pardoned him. In September 1834, he moved to Texas and settled first at Zavala, where he was in business with Thomas Byers Huling and Henry W. Millard. Glasscock was with James Chesshire's company in the Grass Fight and Siege of B√©xar. He was a surveyor and many land titles in Central Texas especially near the San Gabriel Rivers were surveyed by him. In a letter to his brother in 1838 he tells him he should come to the San Gabriel area as \\"the land is cheap and the Indians has not killd me yet\\". In 1840, he moved to Bastrop County, Texas and four years later to Travis County. In 1846, he moved yet again to the Williamson County area, where Glasscock helped to organize the county and donated 172 acres (3.9 km¬≤) for the county seat, Georgetown, Texas, which was subsequently named for him. In 1853, he returned to Travis County. He represented Travis and Williamson counties in the Tenth and Eleventh Texas Legislatures and was one of the managers of the State Lunatic Asylum during the gubernatorial administrations of Sam Houston, Edward Clark, Francis R. Lubbock and Pendleton Murrah. During the American Civil War, he served with the 33rd Texas Cavalry of the Confederate States Army. As a result of his interest in wheat growing, Glasscock built the first flour mill in what was then western Texas. He was an early member of Austin's First Baptist Church and was a Mason. He continued to live in Austin until his death on 28 February 1868. He died when he was thrown from a mule on his land near Webberville. He is buried in the Oakwood Cemetery in downtown Austin, TX.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/7633431 His son, George Washington Glasscock, Jr., was a State Senator in the Nineteenth, Twentieth and Twenty- first Texas Legislatures.

The Carling family and its descendants later resided in Ottawa, Montreal, Halifax, Brockville, London, Toronto, and Windsor, in Canada, as well as Guernsey in the Channel Islands. He was the son of farmer Thomas Carling, who emigrated from Etton in Yorkshire, England to Canada in 1818. The family moved to London in 1839, where Thomas founded the Carling brewery in 1843 using a recipe from his native Yorkshire. In 1849, the brewery was turned over to John and his brother William. John‚Äôs political career began in municipal government, and in 1858, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada. After Confederation in 1867, he represented London in both provincial and federal governments until such a practice was made illegal in 1872. In the 1871 provincial election, he defeated former London mayor Francis Evans Cornish. From 1872 to 1891, he served in the House of Commons as a Conservative Member of Parliament (MP), holding the position as the 7th Postmaster General from 1882 to 1885, and Minister of Agriculture from 1885 to 1891. In this position, he established the Ontario Agricultural College and the Central Experimental Farm near Ottawa. In 1888, he briefly simultaneously held the title of Postmaster General for a second time. After losing the 1891 election to Charles Hyman, he was appointed to the Senate by Prime Minister John A. Macdonald. However, the election was disputed and declared void, and Carling resigned from the Senate in order to run in a by-election in 1892, which he won. He served in the House of Commons until just before the 1896 election, when he resigned and was re-appointed to the Senate. Meanwhile, Carling remained active in London affairs, using his positions in the federal government to influence politics and business. In 1875, John and his brother William built a new Carling Brewery, and an even larger one was built after the first burned down in 1879. The brewery was one of the largest in Canada and rivalled the production of fellow London brewery Labatt. He also ensured that the Great Western Railway, the London and Port Stanley Railway, and the London, Huron and Bruce Railway passed through the city. Due to his influence, the Grand Trunk Railway began to manufacture their cars in London. In 1878, he established a water commission to provide a water supply to the city. He also established the Ontario Hospital for the Insane in London, and in 1885 he provided the land on which Wolseley Barracks was established, now the Home Station of The Royal Canadian Regiment and the garrison of the Regiment's 4th Battalion. Carling also facilitated the establishment of Victoria Park. He was knighted in 1893 and served in the Senate until his death in 1911. In 1927, Carling Brewery sponsored a trans-Atlantic flight from London (Canada) to London (UK). The plane was named the Sir John Carling, but both it and its pilots, Terence Tully and James Medcalf, disappeared over the Atlantic Ocean. Today there is an arena in London named for him. The town of Port Carling, Ontario is also named in his honor as well as the agricultural buildings in Ottawa, Ontario. Carling Avenue in Ottawa is named for Sir John Carling as well, as are the neighbourhoods of Carlington and Carlingwood.  Archives  There is a John Carling fonds at Library and Archives Canada.

Built at the entrance of the Columbia River in 1811, Fort Astoria was the first American-owned settlement on the Pacific coast of North America. The inhabitants of the fort differed greatly in background and position, and were structured into a corporate hierarchy. The fur trading partners of the company were at the top, with clerks, craftsmen, hunters, and laborers in descending order. Nationalities included Scots, French-Canadian voyageurs, American, Native Hawaiian Kanaka, and people from various indigenous North American peoples, including Iroquois and others from Eastern Canada. They found life quite monotonous, with the fish and vegetable diet boring. Venereal diseases were problematic. Types of fur taken in trade at the fort included beaver, sea otter, squirrel, and red fox. The onset of the War of 1812 caused the PFC to fold, too isolated to expect any military protection or support from the United States. The Montreal-based North West Company (NWC) bought out the assets of the PFC in 1813, including Fort Astoria. They renamed it Fort George and utilized it as the headquarters of its most western operations, primarily based along the Columbia. In 1821 the Hudson's Bay Company incorporated Fort George into its collection of posts after absorbing the NWC. The opening of Fort Vancouver in 1825 was planned to allow for a better placed headquarters for the Columbia Department. While Fort George was abandoned in 1825, the arrival of American naval merchants on the Columbia necessitated the reopening of Fort George by the HBC. Competition for control of Fort Astoria was a factor in the British and the Americans' resolving their disputed claims to the Oregon Country. The Fort Astoria Site was added to the list of National Historic Landmarks on November 5, 1961. It is marked by a reconstructed block house. Background John Jacob Astor was a German-American merchant who over several decades financed several successful mercantile missions to the Qing Empire. He promoted the idea of a joint company with the Canadian North West Company (NWC) to open trade posts in the Pacific Northwest. However, Astor was unable to convince the British subjects to join him in such a venture. This didn't deter the ambitious financier, who went ahead with his plans by creating the American Fur Company (AFC) in 1808. The Pacific Fur Company (PFC) was established shortly afterwards as an AFC subsidiary to establish commercial stations on the Pacific Coast. Notably Astor was able to recruit several NWC partners and employees into the PFC, including Donald Mackenzie, Alexander MacKay and Duncan McDougall. To create these new fur trade locations, Astor planned to send detachments of laborers and officers both overland on a route similar to one taken by the Lewis and Clark Expedition and on merchant vessels that rounded Cape Horn for the Columbia. The Tonquin was used to carry a detachment of employees to the Pacific under the command of Captain Jonathan Thorn. After several days were spent surveying the mouth of the Columbia River, 33 men disembarked on 12 April 1811. Among the PFC men were eleven Kanaka laborers from the Kingdom of Hawaii, including Naukane (also known as John Coxe). Notable among the early staff of Fort Astoria were two Scottish emigrants to Canada, Alexander MacKay, who had previously been with the North West Company, and Alexander Ross. Operations =Construction= The layout of Fort Astoria in 1811. By the end of May 1811, company employees built Fort Astoria out of bark-covered logs that enclosed a stockade and guns mounted for defense. Ross recalled that in almost two months, \\"scarcely yet an acre of ground cleared\\" due to the many initial difficulties the PFC employees faced in establishing Fort Astoria: > The place thus selected for the emporium of the west, might challenge the > whole continent to produce a spot of equal extent presenting more > difficulties to the settler: studded with many gigantic trees of almost > incredible size, many of them measuring fifty feet in girth, and so close > together, and intermingled with huge rocks, as to make it work of no > ordinary labour to level and clear the ground. By the time an overland party joined them in February 1812, the PFC laborers had constructed a trading store, a blacksmith's shop, a house, and a storage shed for pelts acquired from trapping or trading with the local Native Americans. The traders arranged cannons around the perimeter for defense. The post was to serve as an administrative center for various PFC satellite forts such as Fort Okanogan. =Activities= On June 15, 1811, two unusual native visitors arrived: the Two-Spirit Ka√∫xuma N√∫pika (known in English as Man-like Woman or Bowdash, which is derived from the Chinook Jargon burdash) and their wife, both of the Kootenai from the far interior. PFC management suspected the two of being spies for the NWC, but at the same time welcomed their detailed geographical knowledge. A NWC employee, David Thompson, arrived about a month later after navigating the entire length of the Columbia River. Thompson knew the Kootenai couple and told the Astorians about Ka√∫xuma N√∫pika and their unusual life. Both the Astorians and Thompson's party ended up protecting the life of Ka√∫xuma N√∫pika, whose prophecies of smallpox among the local natives put her life at risk. Thompson, who for months had been out of touch with the evolving politics between the fur companies, believed that the NWC held a one- third partnership with Astor's Pacific Fur Company. He carried a letter to the effect. The Astorians knew that the deal had fallen through but dealt with Thompson as if the deal were still on. The journals of Thompson and the Astorians are silent on the matter, yet both parties took steps to mislead or thwart the other, while at the same time remaining on friendly terms. It is likely that in this remote region, neither party knew for certain whether the two companies were to be allies or competitors. In June 1812, the number of men at Fort Astoria were reduced to 11 Hawaiians and 39 European descendants. Fear of attack by Chinookans was high and drills were directed by McDougall frequently. A delegation of Chinookans visited Fort Astoria on 2 July quickly left after witnessing these military demonstrations. This fear by the natives convinced the Astorians that \\"they are not friendly disposed towards us...\\" having \\"a desire to harm us.\\" According to Jones, this \\"latent distrust\\" of Chinookans by Astorians from this incident was probably unfounded, as they entered the post \\"for an innocent purpose\\" and were frightened by the drills. =Tonquin= Late in 1811 Tonquin was destroyed off the coast of Vancouver Island. The loss of the vessel created a shortage of provisions at Fort Astoria until arrived the following year in 1812. Acting on the orders of Astor, Thorn and Tonquin departed for Russian America in June 1811. At Destruction Island a Quinault man with familial ties to Vancouver Island, Joseachal, was hired to serve as a translator. While at Clayoquot Sound off Vancouver Island, Thorn became frustrated with the prices set by the local Tla-o-qui-aht people there. He reportedly took an animal pelt and struck the elder appointed as the primary negotiator. This offense greatly offended the Tla-o-qui-aht, and while Joseachal advised Thorn of the danger, the captain refused to immediately depart. Eventually a brisk trade commenced with the locals who had remained on board, with the pelts being sold primarily for American blades. Soon after receiving the weapons the Tla-o-qui-aht attacked and in the ensuing conflict Tonquin was destroyed. Josechal was the sole survivor and later returned to Fort Astoria to inform McDougall of the fate of the vessel. The loss of Tonquin caused a great deal of hardship for the personnel at Fort Astoria as it still held a large amount of the trade goods and foodstuffs intended for trade in the region. =First winter (1811-1812)= Many Tonquin passengers and crew members listed in Gabriel Franch√®re comprehensive travel log did not get to winter over after the initial fort was built, due to either being lost (deserting), drowning or perishing in the June 1811 Tonquin disaster (aside a single Indigenous interpreter survivor). New Kanaka passengers had also been added during the stopover on the Sandwich Islands and similarly, some did not winter over. One Kanaka was exchanged for an experienced Voyageur that came with David Thompson during the summer before he returned. Two additions came during fall 1811 following an expedition to establish Fort Okanogan. Some members of that expedition did return by January 1812 along with the first arrivals of the Wilson Price Hunt overland expedition. The first \\"Astorians\\" to operate the fort during the first winter of 1811-1812 were: * Tonquin remaining passengers and crew members: George Bell, Antoine Belleau, Jean Baptiste Belleau, Russel Farnham, Gabriel Franch√®re, Paul J√©r√©mie, Joseph Lapierre, Jacques Lafantaisie, Michel Laframboise, Olivier Roy Lapens√©e, Gilles Leclerc, William W. Matthews, Duncan M'Dougall, Donald McGillis, Thomas McKay, Donald McLennan, Ovide de Montigny, John M. Mumford, William (Guillaume) Perrault, Francis Benjamin Pillet, Alexander Ross, Augustus (Augustin) Roussil, Benjamin Roussel, David Stuart, Robert Stuart, William Wallace and Henry Weeks. * Kanakas additions: Harry, William Karimou, James Keemo, George Naaco, Dick Paow, Peter Pahia, Paul Pooar, Bob Pookarakara, Jack Powrowrie and Thomas Tuana. * Fall 1811 additions: Michel Boulard (in lieu of departing Kanaka Naukane alias John Coxe in June 1811 upon David Thompson return). * Other 1811 M√©tis, Indigenous and Iroquois additions: R√©gis Bruguier, Joseachal and Ignace Shonowane. * January 1812 additions: First ‚ÄúAstorian overlanders‚Äù Reed party from the Wilson Price Hunt expedition - William Cannon, Andr√© Dufresne, Prisque Felax, Joseph Landry, Guillaume Leroux (dit Cardinal), √âtienne Lucier, Donald MacKenzie, Robert McLelland, John Reed, Michel Samson and Andr√© Vall√©e. Although based in Fort Astoria, Ross, de Montigny, Roussel and Lafantaisie all wintered over around new Fort Okanogan. Robert Stuart, Pillet, McGillis and Bruguier wintered around the Willamette. =Beaver= Astor sent to resupply the fort which arrived in 1812. Besides additional American and British subjects, a further 26 Hawaiian Kanakas were transported to bolster the company workforce. From there the Beaver took the stockpiled animal pelts at Astoria on board and sailed for Novo-Arkhangelsk. An agreement with the Russian American Governor, Alexander Andreyevich Baranov, was made for the exchange of foodstuffs and trade goods in return for Russian furs. From there Beaver sailed to the Chinese port of Guangzhou to sell the furs for highly valuable Chinese manufactured goods. Due to then ongoing War of 1812, Beaver remained at Guangzhou until the resolution of the conflict and only reached New York City in 1816. =War of 1812= The War of 1812 between the British and Americans brought tension to Fort Astoria, though not as a result of hostilities between the fur companies. On 1 July 1813, the fort officers of Donald Mackenzie, Duncan McDougall, David Stuart and John Clarke, desiring to abandon the fort agreed to sell the PFC trading stations to the British-owned NWC, \\"unless the necessary support and supplies arrive with advice from John Jacob Astor of New York, or the Stockholders to continue the trade, the same shall be abandoned as impracticable, as well as unprofitable.\\" NWC staff arrived at the coast after running low on food supplies in the Interior on 7 October, with the liquidation of the PFC assets being executed on 23 October. , a British sloop-of-war, visited Fort Astoria on 12 December 1813, previously instructed to claim the station as a British possession. Its captain William Black found the trading station far from militarily imposing, reportedly exclaiming \\"Is this the fort about which I have heard so much talking? Damn me, but I'd batter it down in two hours with a four pounder!\\" Black renamed the post Fort George in honor of King George III. Relations with Lower Chinookan peoples Comcomly's mercantile skills as an intermediary gained him significant profits in deals with Fort Astoria. In particular he controlled the sale of many of the pelts originating from the Chinookan, Chehalis and Quinault nations. Scholars have affirmed that the American company and its \\"economic success depended on mutually beneficial economic exchanges with Indian groups... who controlled trade.\\" Many of the settlements near the station were under the influence of headman Comcomly. Consistently small stockpiles of foodstuffs at Fort Astoria created the need for frequent transactions with Chinookans for sustenance. Seasonal fish runs provided the major nutritional sources for the Columbian River based Natives. Major fish populations active in the Columbia included the Candlefish smelt, White sturgeon, Sockeye salmon and Chinook salmon. This dependence on fish made it a primary food source for the Astorians, which caused some discontent among employees desiring a more familiar diet. Terrestrial animals like members of the family Cervidae such as Roosevelt elk and black-tailed deer were not found in large numbers around Fort Astoria. This made them another important source of trade for the Chinookans when visiting the PFC station. Another frequent item sold was the Wapato root, with the volume consumed by the Astorians large enough to necessitate the creation of a small cellar made specifically to house the produce. Other typical purchases from Chinookans included manufactured goods. In particular woven hats were frequently bought for protection against the seasonal rains. These hats were tightly interwoven, making them essentially waterproof. British Fur Companies A watercolor painting of Fort George in 1845. Fort George soon became the center of NWC operations along the Columbia River, becoming \\"a Fort William in miniature.\\" At the time the NWC had no competition for the land-based fur trade in the region. NWC laborers developed Fort George by expanding its agricultural fields, in addition to creating \\"several large buildings erected, and the pallisades [sic] and bastions strengthened.\\" Fort George became an important port-of-call for the Maritime Fur Trade. By 1818 there about 50 NWC employees at Fort George, over half being Hawaiian Kanakas. In 1821, the North West Company was merged into the Hudson's Bay Company, which took ownership of the fort. Fort George continued to function the primary entrep√¥t of the Columbia Department until 1825. During a tour of the newly acquired assets on the Pacific shore, Governor George Simpson spent the winter of 1824 at Fort George. He found the station inappropriate both as a fur post and a regional depot. Simpson ordered the establishment of a new post and depot further in the interior along the Columbia River. A suitable prairie was selected by the Governor as having much more for agricultural projects. Besides his intention for this new post to supply foodstuffs for company stations in the Pacific Northwest, Simpson determined to relocate the Columbia Department administrative apparatus there as well. This new station was christened Fort Vancouver, with the initial construction completed in the spring of 1825. HBC personnel withdrew from Fort George two months later. Neighboring native villagers began to seasonally reside there, \\"rapidly reducing it to a state of ruin & filth.\\" A small number of lodges, likely maintained by Clatsops, were established fairly close to Fort George. To counter Americans merchant vessels, a reoccupation of Fort George by the HBC was ordered in 1829. The post was placed at the forefront of competition between the British and American fur traders. While the post was gradually rebuilt, the dilapidated condition and extensive repairs required forced the sole clerk to live in a tent during the winter. The residency of the HBC trader was made to be wide by long. Along with two minor buildings, there was a small warehouse. While ordering a lowering of exchange rates for skins in 1829, Chief Factor John McLoughlin focused on maintaining commercial ties with the Chinookan peoples through \\"forcing our Competitors to reduce their prices.\\" This continued value placed in the Chinookans by the British subjects went extended beyond a major source of fur pelts. For instance, the surrounding tribes of Fort George were frequently employed to man the post canoes. The sinking of such HBC ships as the William and Ann at the mouth of the Columbia necessitated the use of the trading post to guide ships inland. Beginning in 1830 the location was continuously used in a small capacity by the company.Fort Astoria, Oregon History Project The Isabella, a HBC trading ship, crashed near the station during that year. Neighboring Clatsops appeared on the scene, offering to recover property from the ship. Despite Chief Factor McLoughlin lamenting that \\"we have no alternative but to run the risk or lose the property\\", the assistance tendered by them proved invaluable for the company. During 1833 the post had a staff of four: an English clerk, a Scottish field manager from Stromness, and two Hawaiians. Throughout the 1830s and 1840s, several men served as Fort George's managing officer with James Birnie serving the longest. The Methodist missionary Daniel Lee reported that Birnie maintained \\"abundant crops of most excellent potatoes and garden vegetables\\" at the post. The growing salmon harvesting operations of the Hudson's Bay Company were focused on the fisheries surrounding Fort George. The company used the salmon to feed its employees, as well as exporting some to the markets of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Role in Oregon Question The USS Ontario was dispatched in 1817 to reassert the American claim to Fort Astoria, though ordered to avoid an armed confrontation. NWC partner Simon McGillivray dramatically claimed that the vessel was sent \\"to seize or destroy the establishments and trade of the North West Company...\\" The NWC partners had already instructed its staff at Fort George to not resist an attempt by Americans to reclaim the fur trading station. Despite the ceremony of formally transferring national possession, actual ownership by the NWC went on as before, and no actual American presence was established aside from the symbolic repossession. The negotiations that would formally end the War of 1812 briefly touched upon the topic of Fort Astoria/George. The American government exerted pressure for the return of the station from British subjects. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Viscount Castlereagh determined a conciliatory policy. In a letter to Charles Bagot on 4 February 1818, Castlereagh stated that \\"whilst the Government is not disposed to contest with the American govt't the point of possession as it stood in the Columbia River at the moment of the rupture, they are not prepared to admit the validity of the title of the Govt of the United States to this Settlement.\\" Ultimately the Treaty of 1818 established a \\"joint occupancy\\" of the Pacific Northwest between the United Kingdom and the United States. This accord allowed for subjects from either nation to travel to the distant region without hindrance. In 1846 the post finally became United States territory as one of the terms of the Oregon Treaty, which ended the Oregon boundary dispute. In the treaty, Great Britain ceded its territorial rights south of the 49th parallel. As the treaty would have subjected the Hudson's Bay Company to American jurisdiction, the company opted to sell off its possessions south of the 49th parallel, despite the fact that the treaty had specifically guaranteed their right to retain such properties.

Commissioned in 1918, Mahan was a flush deck destroyer, and the first ship to be named for Rear Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan. Her main battery consisted of four 4-inch/50 caliber guns.  Background  Norman Friedman, a naval historian, observed in U.S. Destroyers that the First World War ushered in a new aspect for American destroyer design; e.g. a significant need for a large number of ships. Specifically designed for speeds to match those of the fleet's new era of battlecruiser. The mass-produced destroyers that followed would have the same design speed of as the battlecruisers. Increased speed from to 35 knots required more than 90 tons of additional machinery, and modification of the hulls for greater efficiency. The ships would also be designed as a modified version of the 1916 Caldwell class destroyer. Design =General characteristics= USS Mahan (DD-102) was a Wickes-class destroyer built for the United States Navy by the Fore River Shipyard, Quincy, Massachusetts. The ship was named for Rear Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan and laid down on 4 May 1918. She was launched on 4 August 1918, and sponsored by Miss Ellen K. Mahan, niece of Rear Admiral Mahan. The ship was commissioned on 24 October 1918 - less than one month prior to the end of the First World War - with Lieutenant Commander F. P. Conger in command. Mahan was decommissioned on 1 May 1920. NHHC Mahan was built with a flush deck; meaning she was designed without a raised forecastle. Mahan displaced 1,060 tons at the standard load. The ship's overall length was , the beam was and her draft was . The ship's complement was 133 officers and enlisted men. =Machinery and armament= Service history After her shakedown cruise, Mahan operated off Cuba until May 1919. She then steamed to the Azores to become one of the guide ships for the transatlantic flights of the Navy flying boats: NC-1, NC-3, and NC-4. Mahan returned to Boston, Massachusetts, via Brest, France, on 21 June. She was converted into a light minelayer on 17 July 1920 and designated as DM-7. With the exception of a cruise to Pearl Harbor for maneuvers in early 1925, Mahan operated along the United States East Coast, in the Caribbean Sea, and off the Panama Canal Zone for the next 10 years. During this time, the destroyer participated in fleet training exercises, and patrolled courses for the International Six Meter Sailing Races of 1922 and 1927. Mahan assisted in salvage operations for submarines in September 1925 off Block Island, and did so for , periodically, from 17 December 1927 through mid-March 1928 off Provincetown, Massachusetts. Mahan conducted reserve-training cruises in the Caribbean Sea from 1928 to September 1929. Throughout the decade, in addition to her regular duties, Mahan served as an experimental ship testing new equipment for the Navy's future use. Fiction USS Mahan was used in the Destroyermen series, written by Taylor Anderson. In the books, Mahan and her sister ship are pursued by superior Japanese naval forces after the Battle of the Java Sea and seek refuge in a squall. The squall transports Mahan and Walker to an alternate earth, one where a different evolutionary path occurred. Anderson also uses other decommissioned and never-completed ships in the series: the U.S. Navy submarine and the Imperial Japanese Navy battlecruiser .

In 2016, Zagat gave Katz's a food rating of 4.5 out of 5, and ranked it as the number one deli in New York City. History In 1888, the Iceland brothers established what is now known as Katz's Delicatessen on Ludlow Street in New York's Lower East Side. Upon the arrival of Willy Katz in 1903, the establishment's name was changed from Iceland Brothers to Iceland & Katz. Willy's cousin Benny joined him in 1910, buying out the Iceland brothers to form Katz's delicatessen. Their landlord Harry Tarowsky bought into the partnership in April 1917. The construction of the subway system required the deli to move to the present side of the street, although the entrance remained on Ludlow Street. The vacant lot on Houston Street was home to barrels of meat and pickles until the storefront facade was added in the period 1946‚Äì1949. In the early part of the twentieth century, the Lower East Side was home to millions of newly immigrated families. This, along with the lack of public and private transportation, forged a solid community such that Katz's became a focal point for congregating. On Fridays, the neighborhood turned out for franks and beans, a long time Katz tradition. During the peak of the Yiddish theater, the restaurant was frequently full of actors, singers and comedians from the many theaters on Second Avenue as well as the National Theater on Houston Street. During World War II, the two sons of the owners ‚Äì Lenny Katz and Izzy Tarowsky ‚Äì were both serving their country in the armed forces, and the family tradition of sending food to their sons became sealed as the company slogan \\"Send A Salami To Your Boy In The Army\\". The slogan was coined by Izzy's mother Rose Tarowsky, whose son served in the South Pacific as a bomber pilot.'Profiles: The Bard in the Delicatessen', The New Yorker, March 18, 1944; see also New York Historical Society The next change in ownership took place with the death of Willy Katz, as his son Lenny took over. In 1980, both Lenny Katz and Harry Tarowsky died, leaving the store to Lenny's son-in-law Artie Makstein and Harry's son Izzy. In 1988, on the 100th anniversary of its establishment, with no offspring of their own to leave the business to, Lenny, Izzy and Arthur sold it to long-time restaurateur Martin Dell, his son Alan ‚Äì who was a chef and a manager at a neighboring deli ‚Äì and Martin's son-in-law Fred Austin. Alan‚Äôs son Jake joined the business in late 2009 and is in charge of major operations. The restaurant celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2013. In connection with that celebration, the restaurant opened a pop-up art gallery next door. The gallery featured original art by local New York City artists with Baron Von Fancy and Ricky Powell among the first displayed and others rotated on a monthly basis. In 2017, Katz's opened its first auxiliary location, in the City Point development's DeKalb Market Hall in Downtown Brooklyn. Early morning at Katz's, before the crowds Catch phrases During World War II, Katz's encouraged parents to \\"Send a salami to your boy in the army\\" which became one of the deli's noted catch phrases. It is part of the lyrics of a song in the Martin and Lewis 1950 film At War with the Army. It is referenced in the Tom Lehrer song \\"So Long Mom (A Song for World War III)\\", in the lyric: \\"Remember Mommy, I'm off to get a Commie, so send me a salami, and try to smile somehow\\". Katz's continues to support American troops today: the deli has arranged special international shipping for U.S. military addresses only and has been a source of gift packages to the troops stationed in Afghanistan and Iraq. Another of the deli's catch phrases is \\"Katz's, that's all!\\", which came about when a sign maker asked Harry Tarowsky what to say on the deli's sign, and Harry replied \\"Katz's, that's all\\". This was misinterpreted by the sign maker who painted the sign as it stands today on the side of the building. Tickets As each customer enters Katz's, a door attendant hands them a printed, numbered ticket. As they receive their food from various stations/areas throughout the deli (separate for sandwiches, hot dogs, bottled drinks, fountain drinks, etc.), employees compute a running total of the pre- tax bill. If several people's orders are combined on a single ticket, a cashier collects the blank tickets.http://ny.eater.com/archives/2010/05/katzs_management_explains_the_50_lost_ticket_fee.php, Katz's has instituted a \\"lost ticket fee\\". If a customer loses a ticket, an additional $50 surcharge is added to the bill. The fee's purpose, as stated by the management, is to encourage patrons to go back and find the lost ticket in the hopes of preventing theft (substituting a smaller ticket for a larger one).

Two months later, she returned and took up local duty until November when she cruised to Florida to serve as a school ship for prospective commanding officers. Albuquerque resumed local operations out of her home port in December. On 14 January 1986, Albuquerque entered Electric Boat Shipyard for a two-month restricted availability. In March, she began alternating between local evolutions and upkeep in her home port until late May. Between 19 May and 14 September, Albuquerque remained at sea, making port calls in Scotland and England. She returned home in mid-September and, after post-deployment standdown, reported to Exuma Sound late in October for sound trials. She returned to Groton briefly at the beginning of November, but put to sea on 4 November to take part in two fleet exercises. Upkeep at New London, Connecticut, took up the period between 24 November and 7 December and an ASW exercise consumed most of December. 1990‚Äì1999 Albuquerque was operating off the coast of Long Island, New York during the evening of 17 July 1996, however investigation determined that Albuquerque and several other military units were either out of range, unarmed or did not have the vertical launch capability of reaching TWA Flight 800. In 1999, Albuquerque participated in a six-month Mediterranean cruise as a part of the battlegroup. The ship pulled into several liberty ports during this cruise, including Naples, La Maddalena, and Toulon. Despite working up as a Special Operations Force (SOF) delivery platform and having a minimal load-out of Tomahawk missiles, Albuquerque quickly became a Tomahawk launch platform during Operation Noble Anvil. The ship fired four strike missions, reloaded missiles in theater, and fired again. Albuquerque completed this Tomahawk mission with a 100% success rate. 2000‚Äì2009 Albuquerque started a refueling overhaul at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (PNSY) 1 July 2001. Albuquerque was commended for being the fastest and most cost-effective Engineered Refueling Overhaul (ERO) in history during the shipyard period, 22.3 months in length. Albuquerque returned to Groton 8 May 2003. The rest of 2003 was spent conducting local operations, an ORSE, and a weapons system upgrade. Most of 2004 was spent at sea preparing for the ship's first overseas deployment since the shipyard. This included a two-month overseas surge deployment with a port call in Rota, Spain. Albuquerque conducted a six-month deployment as part of the Carrier Strike Group from 13 October 2004 to 12 April 2005. The ship made port calls in Scotland, Portugal, Bahrain, Seychelles, and Crete. During this deployment, Albuquerque was awarded the Squadron 2 Battle Efficiency Award for 2004. Albuquerque was homeported in Groton, Connecticut, as part of Submarine Group 2. =Alleged treason and espionage by crew member= In July 2005, a fire-control technician named Ariel Weinmann deserted from Albuquerque and remained at large until he was arrested in 2006. In addition to desertion, he was charged with espionage, larceny, and destruction of government property. He allegedly passed secret documents to officials at the Russian consulate in Austria,fas.org (.pdf) and then tried to pass sensitive information about Albuquerque to agents of unspecified foreign governments in Austria and Mexico, before attempting to defect to Russia. In December 2006, he was sentenced to 12 years in prison. On 6 August 2009, Albuquerque completed her change of homeport from Groton, Connecticut, to Naval Base Point Loma in order to maintain 60 percent of the submarine force in the Pacific in line with the 2006 QDR.USS Albuquerque Joins San Diego-based Fleet, Contributes to Maritime Strategy 2010‚Äì2017 Albuquerque conducted a six-month deployment to the Western Pacific, returning to San Diego 15 December 2011. The deployment covered more than 40,000 nautical miles and included port visits in Brisbane, Australia; Yokosuka, Japan; and Guam. In conjunction with other ships from the U.S., Australian, and Canadian navies, Albuquerque took part in exercise Talisman Sabre 2011. Albuquerque deployed from San Diego on 29 January 2013 and returned 21 August 2013 after steaming more than 30,000 nautical miles and visiting Yokosuka, Japan, Thailand, Sasebo, Japan and Saipan. The ship participated in several exercises with Japan and Thailand. This deployment included the ship's 1,000th dive and 30th birthday. Albuquerque sailed into Puget sound on 28 October 2015 after her inactivation in San Diego on 16 October 2015. She was decommissioned on 27 February 2017.

Born in Middletown, New York, Stringham entered the Navy on 15 November 1809, aged only 11 years old, receiving promotion to the rank of midshipman on 19 June 1810 while serving under Captain John Rodgers in the frigate . He was present during the Little Belt affair in May 1811, and during the engagement with on 23 June 1812. Having received his commission as a lieutenant on 9 December 1814, he was assigned to the brig , Captain Thomas Gamble, which was part of Stephen Decatur's squadron in the Barbary Wars, and helped to take an Algerine frigate. In early 1816, while Spark was at Gibraltar, a French brig, attempting to enter the bay in a heavy gale, capsized. Stringham and six seamen in a small boat, pulled over to the brig, and rescued five of the crew. He attempted to return to Spark, but could make no headway, so turned and pulled for the Algerian shore, but was wrecked in the heavy surf, with one of his crew and two of the Frenchmen drowned. In 1819 Stringham was serving aboard the , conveying black settlers to Liberia. While Cyane was off the African coast. Captain Edward Trenchard gave Stringham command of a boat in the capturing of four slavers. Trenchard then appointed Stingham prize-master and sent him home with them. In 1821 Stringham was appointed First Lieutenant of the brig in the West Indies Squadron, and from 1825 to 1829 served at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. In late 1829 he was appointed First Lieutenant of the to take part in the search his former ship Hornet, believed lost. During the search he was transferred to the sloop , and sent to Cartagena, finally returning to New York in 1830. Stringham was promoted to commander on 3 March 1831, and for the next five years was engaged on shore duty. In 1836-37 he served in the Mediterranean Squadron commanding the , then returned to the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Receiving promotion to captain in 1841, he commanded the razee in the Home Squadron in 1843, then returned to the Brooklyn Navy Yard, serving as Commandant in 1845-46. In late 1846 he was placed in command of the ship of the line , and during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War took part in the bombardment of Vera Cruz as it was besieged by troops under General Winfield Scott. For a short time afterwards he commanded the Brazil Squadron, but in 1851 took charge of the Gosport Navy Yard. Between 1852 and 1855 he commanded the Mediterranean Squadron, his flagship being the frigate . He then returned to Gosport, where he remained till 1859. On the outbreak of the Civil War in April 1861, he was appointed Flag officer of the Atlantic Blockading Squadron. In August he was sent with troops under General Benjamin F. Butler, to capture two coastal forts near Cape Hatteras. In the ensuing battle, the fortifications were captured without loss, though not without some difficulty owing to the weather, and the fleet returned to Fort Monroe to general acclaim. However this soon give way to criticism of Stringham for not taking his ships closer in, and continuing to attack along the coast. The fact that his ships drew too much water to enter the shallow coastal waters, and that he had been directly ordered to return immediately, eventually emerged, but apparently too late to soothe his irritation, as the next month, at his own request, he was relieved of his command. As some small compensation on 1 August 1862 he was promoted to the rank of rear admiral on the retired list. Though no longer on active duty, Stringham served as Commandant of the Boston Navy Yard, 1864‚Äì66, and as Port admiral of New York in 1870. Rear Admiral Stringham died in Brooklyn, New York, and was buried at Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn. Two Navy ships have been named in his honor.

The music is most often based on a polka or waltz tempo and its lyrics often deal with socially relevant topics, although there's also a large amount of norte√±o love songs. The accordion and the bajo sexto are traditional norte√±o's most characteristic instruments. Norte√±a music developed in the late 19th century, as a mixture between German folk music (which was introduced to Mexico with the arrival of German migrant workers in those years), and local Northern Mexican music. The genre is popular in both Mexico and the United States, especially among the Mexican and Mexican-American community, and it has become popular in many Latin American countries as far as Colombia, Chile, and Spain. Though originating from rural areas, norte√±o is popular in both rural and urban areas. A conjunto norte√±o is a type of Mexican folk ensemble. It mostly includes diatonic accordion, bajo sexto, electric bass or double bass, and drums, and sometimes saxophone. Repertoire The norte√±o repertoire covers canci√≥n ranchera, corrido, ballad, bolero, chot√≠s, cumbia, huapango norte√±o, mazurka, polka, redowa and waltz. Image:Ram√≥n Ayala.jpg Ramon Ayala, a norte√±o musician known as the \\"King of the Accordion\\" Image:Los Tigres Del Norte 1.jpgLos Tigres Del Norte performing at a Californian casino in 2006 History =Origins= Dress to dance polka and redova from Nuevo Le√≥n, displayed at the Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City Emperor Maximilian I brought music from Europe to M√©xico. By 1864 he had accumulated marching bands and musicians to entertain him. When Maximilian's empire was defeated, many of his former army and fellow countrymen fled north and dispersed into what is now the southwestern United States. Norte√±o music developed from a blending of Mexican and Spanish oral and musical traditions, military brass band instrumentation, and Germanic musical styles such as polka and waltz. European immigrants from Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States also brought dance traditions such as the varsovienne. The focus on the accordion in the music of their home countries was integrated into Mexican music, and the instrument is essential in the genre today. It was called norte√±o because it was most popular in the northern regions of Mexico. The late 1910s and 1920s were the golden age of the corrido, a form of ballad. Mexicans on both sides of the border came to San Antonio, Texas, to record in hotels. Their songs memorialize the Mexican political revolution of the time. Los Alegres de Ter√°n and Los Donne√±os were among the first norte√±o bands. Later in the century, the genre became more commercial with the works of Los Rel√°mpagos del Norte and other groups. More recent bands such as Intocable integrate elements of rock music and other popular styles. Modernization Modern norte√±o has also diverged significantly from more original \\"oldie\\" norte√±o of pre-1950s artists such as Narciso Mart√≠nez. Since the 1970s and 1980s, electric bass guitars and a modern drum set have been added. The traditional bajo sexto-accordion style of Los Alegres de Ter√°n and Los Donne√±os transformed into the modern style typical to that of Los Tigres del Norte, Los Tucanes de Tijuana, Intocable, and Duelo. Current songs may feature percussions, saxophone, or an electronic keyboard. In 2014, Los Tigres del Norte released the album Realidades, which contains the song ‚ÄúEra Diferente‚Äù (meaning ‚ÄúShe Was Different‚Äù) about a lesbian teenager who falls in love with her best friend; according to lead singer and songwriter Jorge Hern√°ndez, this is the first time a norte√±o band has ever written a gay love song.

Regional variations The norte√±o bands with the most traditional sounds come from Mexico‚Äôs northeastern states, while norte√±o bands from Mexico‚Äôs pacific states tend to play their music in a rougher manner and some replace the electric bass with a sousaphone (norte√±o-banda), and norte√±o bands who incorporate the saxophone into their music (norte√±o-sax) are primarily popular in Mexico‚Äôs landlocked states.

This fold is composed of alternating beta strands and alpha helical segments where the beta strands are hydrogen bonded to each other forming an extended beta sheet and the alpha helices surround both faces of the sheet to produce a three-layered sandwich. The classical Rossmann fold contains six beta strands whereas Rossmann-like folds, sometimes referred to as Rossmannoid folds, contain only five strands. The initial beta-alpha-beta (bab) fold is the most conserved segment of the Rossmann fold. The motif is named after Michael Rossmann who first noticed this structural motif in the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase in 1970 and who later observed that this was a frequently occurring motif in nucleotide binding proteins.  History  The Rossmann fold was first described by Dr. Michael Rossmann and coworkers in 1974. He was the first to deduce the structure of lactate dehydrogenase and characterized the structural motif within this enzyme which would later be called the Rossmann fold. It was subsequently found that most dehydrogenases that utilize NAD or NADP contain this same structurally conserved Rossmann fold motif. In 1989, Israel Hanukoglu from the Weizmann Institute of Science discovered that the consensus sequence for NADP+ binding site in some enzymes that utilize NADP+ differs from the NAD+ binding motif. This discovery was used to re-engineer coenzyme specificities of enzymes.  Structure  Schematic diagram of a six stranded Rossmann fold The Rossmann fold is composed of six parallel beta strands that form an extended beta sheet. The first three strands are connected by Œ±- helices resulting in a beta-alpha-beta-alpha-beta structure. This pattern is duplicated once to produce an inverted tandem repeat containing six strands. Overall, the strands are arranged in the order of 321456 (1 = N-terminal, 6 = C-terminal). Five stranded Rossmann-like folds are arranged in the order 32145. The overall tertiary structure of the fold resembles a three-layered sandwich wherein the filling is composed of an extended beta sheet and the two slices of bread are formed by the connecting parallel alpha helices. One of the features of the Rossmann fold is its co-factor binding specificity. Through the analysis of four NADH-binding enzymes, it was found that in all four enzymes the nucleotide co-factor entailed the same conformation and orientation with respect to the polypeptide chain. The fold may contain additional strands joined by short helices or coils. The most conserved segment of Rossmann folds is the first beta-alpha-beta segment. Since this segment is in contact with the ADP portion of dinucleotides such as FAD, NAD and NADP it is also called as an \\"ADP-binding beta-beta fold.  Function  The function of the Rossmann fold in enzymes is to bind nucleotide cofactors. It also often contributes to substrate binding. Metabolic enzymes normally have one specific function, and in the case of UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase, the primary function is to catalyze the two step NAD(+)-dependent oxidation of UDP-glucose into UDP-glucuronic acid. The N- and C-terminal domains of UgdG share structural features with ancient mitochondrial ribonucleases named MAR. MARs are present in lower eukaryotic microorganisms, have a Rossmannoid-fold and belong to the isochorismatase superfamily. This observation reinforces that the Rossmann structural motifs found in NAD(+)-dependent dehydrogenases can have a dual function working as a nucleotide cofactor binding domain and as a ribonuclease.  Evolution  The evolutionary relationship between the Rossmann fold and Rossmann-like folds is unclear. These folds are referred to as Rossmannoids. It has been hypothesized that all these folds, including a Rossmann fold originated from a single common ancestral fold, that had nucleotide binding capabilities, in addition to non-specific catalytic activity. Phylogenetic analysis of the NADP binding enzyme adrenodoxin reductase revealed that from prokaryotes, through metazoa and up to primates the sequence motif difference from that of most FAD and NAD-binding sites is strictly conserved. In many articles and textbooks, a Rossmann fold is defined as a strict repeated series of Œ≤Œ±Œ≤ structure. Yet, comprehensive examination of the Rossmann folds in many NAD(P) and FAD binding sites revealed that only the first Œ≤Œ± structure is strictly conserved. In some enzymes, there may be many loops and several helices (i.e., not a single helix) between the beta strands that form the beta-sheet. Despite this divergence, conserved sequence and structural features implicate a common evolutionary origin for the Rossmann folds.

Construction and commissioning launched at Groton, Connecticut, on 27 September 1969. The contract to build Trepang was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 15 July 1966 and her keel was laid down there on 28 October 1967. She was launched on 27 September 1969, sponsored by Mrs. Melvin R. Laird, the wife of United States Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird, and commissioned on 14 August 1970 with Commander Dean R. Sackett, Jr., in command. Service history = 1970-1971 = Following local operations out of her home port, New London, Connecticut, Trepang proceeded to the Arctic early in 1971. From 22 February to 22 March 1971, she operated beneath the polar ice cap, conducting extensive tests to provide data for her weapons systems as well as carrying out scientific experiments concerning the movement, composition, and geological history of the ice cap itself. After returning to New London via Faslane, Scotland, Trepang was soon deployed to the warmer climes of the Caribbean Sea, departing from New London on 22 April 1971 and subsequently making port at Frederiksted on St. Croix in the United States Virgin Islands for weapons systems acceptance and evaluation trials. Back in New England waters for local operations, Trepang again headed south for further tests. In November 1971, she deployed to conduct independent operations in the North Atlantic Ocean. = 1972 = Following her return to New London on 5 February 1972, Trepang underwent a routine post-deployment standdown and upkeep, as well as attack submarine training and equipment grooming in local operating areas. She conducted a second extended deployment into the North Atlantic from 24 July to 25 September 1972, returning to New London via Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. For the remainder of 1972, she operated off the United States East Coast between New London and Fort Lauderdale, Florida. = 1973 = An interim four- week drydocking period at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard at Kittery, Maine, preceded Trepangs 1973 operations before she headed south for weapons tests off the Florida coast. Completing a four-week upkeep period on 22 April 1973, she completed a Nuclear Technical Proficiency Inspection before returning to New London, where she completed an Operational Reactor Safeguard Examination on 4 May 1973. On 8 June 1973, Trepang departed New London for a six-month deployment with the United States Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea. She participated in several special operations with the Sixth Fleet during the increased tension brought on by the Yom Kippur War in the Middle East in October 1973. She returned to New London at the end of November 1973 for upkeep and the routine post-deployment standdown leave period. = 1974 = Trepang got underway on 15 February 1974 for a special operation which lasted through 9 April 1974. She then spent three days at Holy Loch, Scotland, before departing for New London. She continued local operations and training off the U.S. East Coast through her change of home port on 1 October 1974, when Portsmouth, New Hampshire, became her new base. She spent the remainder of 1974 in drydock in annual overhaul. = 1975 = While in overhaul, Trepang was assigned to Submarine Squadron 10 during March 1975. She spent April to August 1975 completing the overhaul and carrying out crew training and recertification. Following sea trials in late October 1975, Trepang returned to New London, which once again became her home port, on 7 November for an intensive post-overhaul upkeep alongside submarine tender . Departing New London on 1 December 1975, Trepang conducted post-overhaul weapons systems acceptance testing at Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Puerto Rico and five days of acoustic trials off Frederiksted at St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands before departing St. Croix on 17 December 1975 and returning to New London on 22 December. = 1976 = Trepang spent the early part of 1976 preparing for an extended cruise. She deployed to the Mediterranean Sea from June to November 1976, operating with the Sixth Fleet. She returned to New London upon conclusion of the deployment, and the routine post-deployment standdown lasted into 1977. = 1977 = In mid-January 1977, Trepang participated in Exercise \\"CARIBEX 77\\" in the Caribbean. She devoted the spring of 1977 to individual ship exercises which included a Nuclear Technical Proficiency Inspection, a Mk-48 Torpedo Proficiency Inspection, and an Operational Readiness Inspection, all of which she completed successfully. An extensive refit period, which included drydocking, took place in May and early June 1977. Midshipman orientation cruises followed and, in September, Trepang conducted pre-deployment work-up and certification. She then engaged in a training mission in the Atlantic Ocean from mid-October to mid-December 1977 before returning to New London and beginning a routine post-deployment standdown. = 1978 = After the standdown ended during January 1978, Trepang devoted the remainder of January, February, and March to attack submarine training and participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Exercise \\"Safepass.\\" She spent the summer of 1978 working up for a scheduled Mediterranean deployment. The deployment was subsequently cancelled to permit her to participate in a special Chief of Naval Operations project. She spent the remaining months of 1978 in the evaluation of equipment associated with that project, with periods at sea alternating with periods in port devoted to equipment maintenance. In October 1978, the FBI arrested three men‚Äîtwo in St. Louis, one in New York‚Äîon charges of conspiring to steal the USS Trepang, based in New London, Ct. The FBI discovered the plot when Edward J. Mendenhall and James W. Cosgrove, two of the accused conspirators, contacted an undercover agent seeking funds for training and supplies. After stealing the submarine, the two intended to kill the crew, put out to sea, and rendezvous with an unidentified buyer. http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA145248 She departed Groton on 27 November 1978 to conclude 1978 at sea conducting activities related to the special project. = 1979-1988 = Icex-85 03May85 Northpole In 1987, Trepang completed a Mediterranean deployment. = 1988-1991 = In 1988, Trepang visited Bermuda, earned the Battle \\"E\\" and visited Scotland following a Northern Atlantic deployment. After a change of command in November 1988, \\"Trepang\\" deployed on a two-month unsupported ASW mission to the North Atlantic for which she was awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation. After completion of Pre-Overhaul Testing (POT), in March 1989 Trepang entered her first regular refueling overhaul at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, ME. During the refueling overhaul \\"Trepang\\" completed the test program on- schedule and under budget. \\"Trepang\\" also maintained an effective \\"Host City\\" program with the city of Dover, NH. In recognition of the success of this and other community/education related programs she was awarded the 1990-1991 New Hampshire State Department of Education Community/School Partnership Award. Additionally \\"Trepang\\" was awarded the 1990 Silver Anchor Award for excellence in retention programs. In September 1991, after successful completion of her post overhaul sea trials she completed her refueling overhaul. Following a change of command in October 1991, \\"Trepang\\" then moved to her new home port of Charleston, South Carolina. During her voyage from Kittery, ME to Charleston, SC late in 1991 she transited beneath under the 1991 \\"Perfect Storm\\". = 1991-1998= During the remainder of her career, Trepang conducted many \\"fast-attack submarine\\" drill missions as well as a Mediterranean cruise interrupted by a stay of many weeks in La Maddalena, Italy, and Haifa, Israel. During her Mediterranean deployment, she participated in NATO operations off Bosnia-Herzegovina, became the first American submarine in history to perform peacetime operations with a German submarine‚Äînamely U-29 (S178), conducted a secret mission tailing a drug-smuggling ship, and trained with SEAL Team 6. During these years, one of Trepangs sister ships, was considered her \\"sister submarine,\\" and the two often docked near one another. Trepang conducted her final six-month deployment to the Mediterranean between June and December 1997. In late 1998, she circumnavigated the world in order to use up as much nuclear fuel as possible prior to decommissioning. She was awarded during this time the Joint Meritorious Unit Award (reasons unknown).  Decommissioning and disposal  Trepang was decommissioned on 1 June 1999 at Bremerton, Washington, and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton was completed on 7 April 2000.

Kogarah is located 14 kilometres (9 miles) south of the Sydney central business district and is considered to be the centre of the St George area. Location Kogarah took its name from Kogarah Bay, a small bay on the northern shore of the Georges River. The suburb originally stretched to the bay but has since been divided up to form the separate suburbs of Kogarah Bay and Beverley Park. Kogarah has a mixture of residential, commercial and light industrial areas. It is also known for its large number of schools (including primary school, high school and tertiary education) and health care services (including two hospitals and many medical centres). The NRL side, St George Illawarra Dragons have their Sydney office based at nearby Jubilee Oval, often referred to as Kogarah Oval. Kogarah features all types of residential developments from low density detached houses, to medium density flats and high density high-rise apartments. History left Kogarah is derived from an Aboriginal word meaning rushes or place of reeds. It had also been written as 'Coggera', 'Cogerah' and 'Kuggerah' but the current spelling was settled when the railway line came through the area in the 1880s. Early land grants in the area were made to John Townson (1760‚Äì1835) who received from 1808 to 1810, centred on Hurstville and James Chandler, whose neighbouring estate was centred on Bexley. The district provided fruit, vegetables and oysters for Sydney. In 1869, St Paul's Church of England opened on Rocky Point Road (now Princes Highway). It was built on of land given to the church by William Wolfen the Swedish Consul to Sydney, who owned in Kogarah. The suburb grew around the church and the Gardeners Arms Hotel. Kogarah became a municipality in 1885.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 142 The former neighbourhood of Moorefield is now part of Kogarah. It was originally a land grant from Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1812 to Patrick Moore, who built a fine house there. The Moorefield racecourse built by a descendant opened in 1888. Brigadier General John Lamrock CB VD was appointed secretary of the Moorefield Race Club in 1912 and remained in that position until early in 1935. The Moorefield estate was subdivided in the 1950s and the Department of Education purchased , where it built two high schools and college of further education. Moorefields Girls High School was erected there in 1955 on the former site of Moore's farm.Pictorial Memories. ST.

The commercial area also extends to surrounding streets such as Montgomery and Belgrave Streets. Kogarah Town Centre is a shopping centre on Railway Parade. This commercial area includes the St. George Bank national headquarters in a large office building in Montgomery Street, which is a large employer in the area. Many high rise apartment buildings have also been built around the commercial area in recent years. The noted builder, James Goyen, had his works depot at 18 Montgomery Street, and later at 4 Montgomery Street. He built the original building of what was, for many years, the St George Technical College (now a campus of the Sydney Institute of TAFE). Commercial and light industrial developments are also located along the Princes Highway and Rocky Point Road. The Darrell Lea Chocolate factory is located in Rocky Point Road. Surrounding streets feature more industrial developments. A small group of shops is located on President Avenue, sometimes referred to as Moorefield. St George Hospital is a major regional hospital, that serves the whole St George area but also accepts patients from other regions in New South Wales. St George Private Hospital is located nearby. Many medical centres, doctor's surgeries and specialists‚Äô rooms and related services are located in the surrounding area. Kogarah Police Station and Kogarah Local Court are located on Montgomery Street. The local court serves the whole of the St George area and as such many barristers and solicitors have their offices in Kogarah. A historic fire station is located in Gray Street and another heritage building, the Kogarah School of the Arts is in Bowns Road. The Kogarah Mecca cinema was a landmark building, located opposite the railway station in Station Street. The cinema was often used by local schools for important events such as Speech Day.

Retrieved 9 December 2017. =Kogarah Town Centre= The Kogarah Town Centre is Kogarah's largest shopping centre. It includes a post office, two supermarkets (Woolworths and Aldi), a tavern, along with a multitude of specialty stores. It provides easy access to Kogarah railway station. Kogarah Town Centre was recently under a complete overhaul, with renovations of the whole complex. It was completed in mid-2012, with the supermarket chain, Aldi, opening on the ground floor, along with fast-food chain Oporto (restaurant). An expansion of Kogarah Tavern & Woolworths was also included in this overhaul. The Coffee Club was added onto level one. Transport The entire City of Kogarah and surrounding areas rely on bus, train and taxi services that operate from the centre of Kogarah's shopping district. Bus and train services accommodate the large population within Kogarah, as well as the large number of schools in the area. Kogarah railway station is located on the Illawarra line of the Sydney Trains network. The station sits below a concourse and a small shopping complex called the Kogarah Town Centre. In the late 1990s, the station underwent extensive renovations which added easy access facilities such as elevators from the concourse onto each of the four platforms. Buses from Kogarah service surrounding suburbs, particularly those along the beach such as Brighton-Le-Sands, Monterey, Ramsgate Beach, Sans Souci etc. which rely heavily on bus services since they are far from railway stations. Until 1937, a steam tramway operated between Kogarah and Sans Souci via Rocky Point Road. This was replaced by an electric trolleybus service, one of only two such services to operate in Sydney. This was subsequently replaced in the 1950s with the gas powered diesel [Transit systems routes that formerly operate. The majority of public transportation in Kogarah departs and arrives close to Kogarah Town Centre. Kogarah is also serviced by St George Community Transport, a HACC funded transport service for the Frail Aged, people with disability and their carers.

Among the changes were the establishment of independent states of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia (right of centre) Border states, or European buffer states, were the European nations that won their independence from the Russian Empire after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, the Treaty of Brest- Litovsk and ultimately the defeat of the German Empire and Austria-Hungary in World War I. During the interwar period, the nations of Western Europe implemented a border states policy, which aimed at uniting them in protection against the Soviet Union and communist expansionism. The border states were interchangeably Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and, until their annexation into the Soviet Union, short-lived Belarus and Ukraine. The policy tended to see the border states as a cordon sanitaire, or buffer states, separating Western Europe from the newly formed Soviet Union.Stephanie C. Salzmann, Great Britain, Germany and the Soviet Union, Boydell Press 2013. Page 91. \\"Both countries regarded eastern Europe as a potential future troublespot due to the numerous conflicting interests.... The border states were now regarded as a cordon sanitaire against the spread of communism beyond Soviet Russia,...\\" The policy was very successful. At the time, Soviet foreign policy was driven by the Trotskyist idea of permanent revolution, the end goal of which was to spread communism worldwide through perpetual warfare. However, the Soviet advance to the west was halted by Poland, which managed to defeat the Red Army during the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War. After the war, Polish leader J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski made attempts to unify the border states under a federation called Intermarium, but disputes and different allegiances between and within the group of states prevented such a thing from happening, leaving them more susceptible to possible incursions by their more powerful neighbors. The matter was further complicated by the rise of the expansionist Nazi Germany to the west. In 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, which included a secret clause that sanctioned the partitioning of several border states between the two regimes in the event of war. Only nine days after the pact was signed, Nazi Germany invaded Poland, and the Soviets followed suit shortly after, beginning World War II in Europe. After the end of the war, all border states except for Finland were transferred to Soviet occupation as a result of the Western betrayal although Finland had already ceded some of its territory to the Soviet Union following the Winter War.

He became the first bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Marquette, Michigan, originally sited at Sault Sainte Marie, which he led for 15 years. His letters about his missionary work were published widely in Europe, inspiring the priests John Neumann and Francis Xavier Pierz to emigrate to the United States. In 2012, during the reign of Pope Benedict XVI, Baraga was declared \\"Venerable.\\" Early life Frederic Baraga was born in the manor house at Mala Vas () no. 16 near the Carniolan village of Dobrniƒç, in what was then Lower Carniola, a province of the Duchy of Carniola in the Habsburg Monarchy. Today it is a part of the Municipality of Trebnje in Slovenia. Never using his first name, he was baptized Irenaeus Frederic. He was the fourth of five children born to Janez Baraga and Marija Katarina Jo≈æefa n√©e Jenƒçiƒç. Upon her father's death, his mother inherited an estate at Mala Vas, plus a substantial fortune. His mother died in 1808, and his father in 1812. Frederic spent his boyhood in the house of Jurij Dolinar, a lay professor at the diocesan seminary at Ljubljana. Baraga grew up during the Napoleonic Wars, when France had taken over the Slovene Lands from the Austrian Empire for a time. As a result, the official language of instruction in his schools changed several times during his childhood between Slovenian and German. By the time he was nine, he was fluent in French as well. In addition, Latin and Greek were required subjects for all students. Thus, by age 16, Frederic Baraga was multilingual‚Äîa skill that would serve him well in later life. Priesthood Baraga attended law school at the University of Vienna, where he graduated in 1821. Influenced by Clement Mary Hofbauer, Baraga then entered the seminary in Ljubljana. At age 26, he was ordained a Roman Catholic priest on September 21, 1823 in the St. Nicholas' Cathedral by Augustin Johann Joseph Gruber, the Bishop of Ljubljana. As a young priest, he was assigned as an assistant first at St. Martin's near Kranj and later at Metlika in lower Carniola. Father Baraga was a staunch opponent of Jansenism. During this time, he wrote a spiritual book in Slovene entitled Du≈°na Pa≈°a (Spiritual Sustenance). In 1830 Baraga answered the request of Bishop Edward Fenwick of Cincinnati for priests to aid in ministering to his growing flock, which included a large mission territory. He left his homeland on October 29, 1830 and arrived in New York on December 31. He arrived in Cincinnati, Ohio on January 18, 1831. During the winter and spring he worked among the German immigrants in the area. At the same time he studied the Ottawa language, a branch of the Algonquian languages. In May 1831 was sent to the Ottawa Indian mission at Arbre Croche (present-day Cross Village, Michigan) to finish his mastery of the language. Baraga Street is located near the Catholic Church on Madeline Island. Baraga once operated a mission on the Island. In 1837, he published Otawa Anamie-Misinaigan, the first book written in the Ottawa language, which included a Catholic catechism and prayer book. After a brief stay at a mission in present-day Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1835 Baraga moved north to minister to the Ojibway (Chippewa) Indians at La Pointe, Wisconsin, at a former Jesuit mission on Lake Superior. In 1843 Baraga founded a mission at L'Anse, Michigan. During this time he earned the nickname \\"the Snowshoe Priest\\" because he would travel hundreds of miles each year on snowshoes during the harsh winters. He worked to protect the Indians from being forced to relocate, as well as publishing a dictionary and grammar of the Ojibway language. Although these works have important historical value, they are not recommended as basic resources for the language today. Through the texts Baraga published in his missionary years, the Slovenes learned about aspects of Native American culture and the United States. Bishop Baraga was elevated to bishop by Pope Pius IX and consecrated November 1, 1853, in Cincinnati at Saint Peter in Chains Cathedral by Archbishop John Purcell. He was the first bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sault Sainte Marie, Michigan, now the Diocese of Marquette. On July 27, 1852 he began to keep a diary, written in several languages (primarily German, but with English, French, Slovene, Chippewa, Latin, and Italian interspersed), preserving accounts of his missionary travels and his relationship with his sister Amalia. During this time, the area experienced a population explosion, as European immigrants were attracted to work in the copper and iron mines developed near Houghton, Ontonagon, and Marquette. This presented a challenge because he had few priests, and had to attend to the needs of immigrant miners and the Native Americans. Increased development and population encouraged the improvement of transportation on Lake Superior. The only way to travel in winter was on snowshoes, which Baraga continued to do into his sixties. He was particularly challenged by the wide diversity of peoples in the region, which included the native inhabitants, ethnic French-Canadian settlers, and the new German and Irish immigrant miners. Difficulties in recruiting staff arose because of many languages; while Baraga spoke eight languages fluently, he had trouble recruiting priests who could do the same. Baraga traveled twice to Europe to raise money for his diocese. On one trip he was presented a jeweled cross and episcopal ring by the Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. The bishop later sold these for his missions. Baraga wrote numerous letters to the Society for the Propagation of the Faith describing his missionary activities. The Society published them widely as examples of its missions in North America, and they were instrumental in inspiring the priests John Neumann and Francis Xavier Pierz to come to the United States to work. In time, Baraga became renowned throughout Europe for his work. In his last ten years, his health gradually declined; he became intermittently deaf and suffered a series of strokes. In 1865 Baraga wrote to Pope Pius IX in support of the canonization of his former confessor, Clement Hofbauer. He died January 19, 1868 in Marquette, Michigan. He is buried there in the crypt beneath Cathedral of Saint Peter. Legacy and veneration St. Peter Cathedral, Marquette. Baraga was declared venerable by Pope Benedict XVI on May 10, 2012. His cause was opened in 1952 by Thomas Lawrence Noa, the diocese's eighth bishop, and the formal canonization process began in 1973. The diocese planned to relocate his remains to a more accessible new chapel for veneration in the upper portion of the cathedral. At the time of his veneration, the Vatican was investigating a possible miracle for beatification. *The village of Baraga, Baraga Township, Baraga County, and Baraga State Park (all in Michigan) were named for him. *The Diocese of Ljubljana began construction of the Baraga Seminary in Ljubljana in 1936, however the building was unfinished on the outbreak of World War II in 1941. *A street in Milwaukee is named for Baraga. *An Ontario Provincial Plaque is located on the grounds of Our Lady of Sorrows Roman Catholic Church (Goulais Bay, Ontario), which was built by Baraga *A memorial sculpture of him by Jack E.

Kellie Martin's image was removed from the main cast opening credits in the 15th episode of season 6. Conception and creation Prior to this role in ER, Martin was nicknamed \\"One Take Kellie\\". She was not used to the medical jargon her character had to say, however, and claimed that it once took 12 takes to correctly pronounce \\"renal vein thrombosis.\\" Appearances =Season 5= During season 5 she was a third-year medical student. Dr. John Carter was quickly assigned as her resident while she completed her emergency room rotation. Knight and Carter varied between respectful and contentious interactions. At the beginning of her rotation at County General, she was popular with the attendings and nurses, who often treated her as another colleague. Lucy does run into trouble with Nurse Carol Hathaway after she asks for help with an IV. Lucy, unable to start an IV asks Carol for help and does not own up to Carter that she cannot start one until they end up in a trauma where she admits the truth. Carter was furious at her for lying to him and said if she ever did so again she would be off his rotation permanently, and the relationship between them was never quite the same. Lucy wound up in trouble with Carter again after a Halloween party at her med school gets out of control and two students nearly die. Angry about work that has been thrown at him at the last minute, Carter leaves Lucy in charge of the party even though, as RA, that is his responsibility. Carter blames Lucy for him losing his RA position and they fight again when Carter overrules her on a case where Lucy's judgment was correct, with Lucy then making comments on her Palm Pilot that Carter accidentally hears that describe his condescending treatment of her. Carter and Lucy eventually come to an agreement after the episode \\"The Good Fight\\" when the pair spend a day and evening searching for a little girl's father who has the same extremely rare blood type as she does. Although the pair find the father, the girl's condition remains critical as the story ends and it is not clear whether the blood donation came in time to help save her. At the end of this episode, Carter and Lucy reconcile over the efforts they made. During this episode, Lucy reveals to Carter that she was brought up by her mother, and that she did not know her father.The Complete fifth season: ER DVD. 1998. Disk1/Side B, Episode 8. During the episode The Storm: Part 1, Lucy accidentally kicks Carter while performing a work-out video with a patient in an exam room; he suffers a gash on his head. The pair later share a kiss in the x-ray room, but Carter ends their brief relationship because it is unethical for medical students and their residents to be romantically involved.The Complete fifth season: ER DVD. 1998. Disk2/Side B, Episode 14. Lucy's rotation in the psych department goes exceptionally well, with the senior doctors there are impressed with her successful results. This was the first time the show had a main character who started out working in the ER but was shown to be a poor match for emergency medicine and a good match instead for a different medical field (a similar, longer path was traced starting in Season 10 for Neela Rasgotra, who was an uneven ER doctor but emerged over time as a superb surgeon). Near the end of Season 5, it is revealed that Lucy is on Ritalin and has been since high school. Carter urges her to quit and she eventually does. When her performance at County begins to suffer, Lucy goes back on the Ritalin without telling Carter, and when he finds out and chides her for it she bluntly says that she does not expect him to understand or care, since \\"it's clear I've never lived up to your expectations.\\" =Season 6= Lucy's role in the early episodes of season 6 is rather small, having only minor sub plots such as helping a young artist who is using cocaine or by urging Dr. Dave Malucci to come forward and admit his possible mistake when using a Bunsen Burner that was thought to have caused an explosion in the ER. Lucy clashed with nurse Carol Hathaway when they both make a plea for the last bed in a rehab clinic. The bed ultimately goes to Hathaway's patient, which creates renewed friction between the pair when the patient does not show up for treatment. Lucy also clashes with Dr. Cleo Finch when Finch undermines Lucy's judgment in regard to a young boy and his mother who both have alcohol abuse problems. Lucy is finally able to come into her own and show her potential in the Christmas episode \\"How the Finch Stole Christmas\\" when patient Valerie Paige comes to the ER in desperate need of a heart transplant. Lucy goes above and beyond to ensure Valerie gets the life saving procedure - even going so far as to bang on Dr. Robert Romano's door in the middle of the night on Christmas Eve. Though initially angry with her, Romano agrees to perform the operation after Lucy berates him for his seemingly flippant attitude towards the dying patient. Though she faces a reprimand from Romano, he seems to have more respect for her from then on. Later in the episode \\"The Domino Heart\\", Lucy is devastated when Valerie dies from complications after another surgery. This makes her ponder her time at County General and prompts her to give a moving speech to Dr. Luka Kovac about it: \\"It's never been very easy for me to be here, sometimes I felt like I would never fit in. But at the beginning of every day I have been grateful that I'm walking in here of my own choosing and not being carried in here on some gurney and at the end of every day if I have helped just one person, it's been worth it. And that didn't happen today and it makes me sad...\\".The Complete sixth season: ER DVD. 1999-2000. Disk2/Side A, Episode 11. Kovac reminds her that her day is not yet over and that she may still help that one person. At that moment another patient arrives near the ambulance bay, and Kovac asks her to assist. The episode ends with the two of them rushing the patient into the ER and Kovac teaching Lucy procedures and asking her questions. Death In various interviews, Kellie Martin stated that she and the producers felt the character of Lucy was not working, so it was decided that Lucy would be written out of the show permanently. Martin also said that having family members face serious real-life medical issues nixed her interest in working on a medical show. On February 14, 2000, over the course of two episodes, \\"Be Still My Heart\\" and \\"All In The Family\\", Paul Sobriki (played by David Krumholtz), a man with schizophrenia, checks into the emergency room. Lucy picks up on his mental problems, but Carter refuses to help her with the case and either ignores her 100%-accurate views of Paul's state or openly scoffs at them. When she wants his help with getting the Psych Department to take a look at Paul, Carter dismissively says she should contact them and then pick up on other cases, leading her to angrily say \\"Just forget it, Carter!\\" and stop seeking his advice on the case. This is the last time they ever speak to each other. While in a delusional state, Paul acquires a knife that was to be used to cut a Valentine's Day cake and stabs Knight multiple times before lying in wait for Carter. When Carter enters the room and sees a Valentine for Lucy on the floor, he picks it up and looks over it smiling just as Paul emerges from the shadows and stabs him twice before fleeing. Upon glancing at his blood-stained fingers, Carter goes into shock and hits the floor, gazing in surprise at Lucy lying in a pool of blood on the other side of the gurney. Both lose consciousness. Both are later discovered by Dr. Kerry Weaver and immediately taken to the main Trauma rooms to be treated. It is discovered that Lucy had received four serious stab wounds to her internal organs, lung, and neck. Although Weaver and Dr. Elizabeth Corday are able to stabilize Lucy in the ER, and Corday and Dr. Robert Romano are then able to repair her tissue damage, she soon develops complications, including a pulmonary embolism. Despite the heroic efforts of Doctors Corday and Romano, Lucy dies while in the catheter lab awaiting a Greenfield filter. Lucy's memorial service takes place in the episode \\"Be Patient\\", although it is not seen on-screen and was apparently only attended by Jing-Mei Chen, who was there more as a representative of the ER than as a friend of Lucy's. That same day, Lucy's mother, Barbara Knight, arrives to clear out her locker. She eventually seeks Carter out and they spend the afternoon talking, with Mrs. Knight recounting how Lucy loved San Francisco but went to Chicago to practice medicine before she begins sobbing over her daughter's death as Carter watches silently and sadly. Hoping to spare her the knowledge of Lucy's suffering, he lies and says he did not actually feel pain when stabbed. Carter later talks to a few characters and says Lucy was a better doctor than he gave her credit for. He also says in the Season 6 finale \\"May Day\\" that Lucy's death is \\"partly my fault\\". In the episode \\"A Match Made In Heaven\\", a letter for Lucy arrives from a med school. She had matched to County, and, had she lived, she would have been given a position as a psych resident.

It was built in 1052 in Song dynasty (ÂÆãÊúù). Chinese architecture demonstrates an architectural style that developed over millennia in China, before spreading out to influence architecture throughout East Asia. Since the solidification of the style in the early imperial period, the structural principles of Chinese architecture have remained largely unchanged, the main changes being only the decorative details. Starting with the Tang dynasty, Chinese architecture has had a major influence on the architectural styles of Japan, Korea, Mongolia, and Vietnam, and a varying amount of influence on the architectural styles of Southeast and South Asia including Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and The Philippines. Chinese architecture is typified by various features; such as, bilateral symmetry, use of enclosed open spaces, the incorporation of ideas related to feng shui such as directional hierarchies, a horizontal emphasis, and allusion to various cosmological, mythological, or other symbolism. Chinese architecture traditionally classifies structures according to type, ranging from pagodas to palaces. In part because of an emphasis on the use of wood, a relatively perishable material, and due to a de-emphasis on major monumental structures built of less-organic but more durable materials, much of the historical knowledge of Chinese architecture derives from surviving miniature models in ceramic and published planning diagrams and specifications. Some of the architecture of China shows the influence of other types or styles from outside of China, such as the influences on mosque structures originating in the Middle East. Although displaying certain unifying aspects, rather than being completely homogeneous, Chinese architecture has many types of variation based on status or affiliation, such as dependence on whether the structures were constructed for emperors, commoners, or used for religious purposes. Other variations in Chinese architecture are shown in the varying styles associated with different geographic regions and in ethnic architectural design. Throughout the 20th century, Chinese architects have attempted to combine traditional Chinese designs into modern architecture (usually government), with great success. Moreover, the pressure for urban development throughout contemporary China required higher speed of construction and higher floor area ratio, which means that in the great cities the demand for traditional Chinese buildings, which are normally less than 3 levels, has declined in favor of modern architecture. However, the traditional skills of Chinese architecture, including major and minor carpentry, masonry, and stonemasonry, are still applied to the construction of vernacular architecture in the vast rural area in China. History =Neolithic and early antiquity= Jiangzhai, a Yangshao village Chinese civilizational cultures developed in the plains along the numerous rivers that emptied into the Bohai and Hongzhow bays. The most prominent of these rivers, the Yellow and the Yangtze, hosted a complex fabric of villages. The climate was warmer and more humid than today, allowing for millet to be grown in the north and rice in the south. There was, however, no single \\"origin\\" of the Chinese civilization. Instead, there was a gradual multinuclear development between the years 4000 and 2000 BC - from village communities to what anthropologists call cultures to small but well-organized states. 2 of the more important cultures were the Hongshan culture (4700-2900 BC) to the north of Bohai Bay in Inner Mongolia and Hebei Province and the contemporaneous Yangshao culture (5000-3000 BC) in Henan Province. Between the 2, and developing later, was the Longshan culture (3000-2000 BC) in the central and lower Yellow River valley. These combined areas gave rise to thousands of small states and proto-states by 3000 BC. Some continued to share a common ritual center that linked the communities to a single symbolic order, but others developed along more independent lines. All was not peaceful, and the emergence of walled cities during this time is a clear indication that the political landscape was very much in flux. The Hongshan culture of Inner Mongolia (located along the Laoha, Yingjin, and Daling rivers that empty into Bohai Bay) was scattered over a large area but had a single, common ritual center that consisted of at least 14 burial mounds and altars over several hill ridges. It dates from around 3500 BC but could have been founded ever earlier. Although there is no evidence of village settlements nearby, its size is much larger than one clan or village could support. In other words, though rituals would have been performed here for the elites, the large area implies that audiences for the ritual would have encompassed all the villages of the Hongshan. As a sacred landscape, the center might also have attracted supplicants from even further afield. Features A sancai (tri-colored) ceramic mansion from the Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907), excavated from a Tang era tomb at Zhongbu village in the western suburbs of Xi'an. The rectangular compound shown above has two sections of courtyards. The buildings on the axle line include central entrance, four-pointed pavilion, mountain-shaped front hall, artificial mountain and ponds, eight-pointed pavilion and mountain-shaped retiring quarters. The two sides of the central axle are arranged with corridor rooms symmetrically. =Architectural bilateral symmetry= The Wonderland of Fanghu in the Old Summer Palace.It was destroyed by the Anglo-French Allied Forces in 1860.(Fanghu is one of the wonderlands on the sea in Chinese myths.It is the same as Fangzhang.‚ÄúÊñπÂ£∂‚ÄùÔºåÂêå‚ÄúÊñπ‰∏à‚ÄùÔºåÊòØ‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰º†ËØ¥‰∏≠Êµ∑‰∏ä‰∏â‰ªôÂ±±‰πã‰∏Ä„ÄÇ) The Meridian Gate of the Forbidden City A very important feature in Chinese architecture is its emphasis on articulation and bilateral symmetry, which signifies balance. Bilateral symmetry and the articulation of buildings are found everywhere in Chinese architecture, from palace complexes to humble farmhouses. When possible, plans for renovation and extension of a house will often try to maintain this symmetry provided that there is enough capital to do so. Secondary elements are positioned either side of main structures as two wings to maintain overall bilateral symmetry. The buildings are typically planned to contain an even number of columns in a structure to produce an odd number of bays (Èñì). With the inclusion of a main door to a building in the center bay, symmetry is maintained. In contrast to the buildings, the Chinese gardens tend to be asymmetrical. The principle underlying the garden's composition is to create enduring flow. The design of the classic Chinese garden is based on the ideology of \\"Nature and Man in One\\", as opposed to the home itself, which is a symbol of the human sphere co- existing with, but separate from nature. So, the arrangement is as flexible as possible to let people feel they are surrounded by and in harmony with nature. The two essential elements of the garden are hill stones and water. The hill stones mean the pursuit of immortality and water represents emptiness and existence. The mountain belongs to yang (static beauty) and the water belongs to yin (dynamic wonder). They depend on each other and complete the whole nature.Cui, Huaizu, and Qingqing Hu (2015), Creation and Appreciation of ‚ÄúNature and Man in One‚Äù and Chinese Classic Beauty of Garden ‚Äì Taking the Suzhou classic garden as an example, (https://www.shs- conferences.org/articles/shsconf/abs/2015/04/shsconf_icmetm2015_02001/shsconf_icmetm2015_02001.html ). Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. =Enclosure= In much of traditional Chinese architecture, buildings or building complexes take up an entire property but enclose open spaces within themselves. These enclosed spaces come in two forms, the: *Courtyard (Èô¢): The use of open courtyards is a common feature in many types of Chinese architectures. This is best exemplified in the Siheyuan, which has consisted of an empty space surrounded by buildings connected with one another either directly or through verandas. *\\"Sky well\\" (Â§©‰∫ï): Although large open courtyards are less commonly found in southern Chinese architecture, the concept of an \\"open space\\" surrounded by buildings, which is seen in northern courtyard complexes, can be seen in the southern building structure known as the \\"sky well\\". This structure is essentially a relatively enclosed courtyard formed from the intersections of closely spaced buildings and offer small opening to the sky through the roof space from the floor up. These enclosures serve in temperature regulation and in venting the building complexes. Northern courtyards are typically open and facing the south to allow the maximum exposure of the building windows and walls to the sun while keeping the cold northern winds out. Southern sky wells are relatively small and serves to collect rain water from the roof tops. They perform the same duties as the Roman impluvium while restricting the amount of sunlight that enters the building. Sky wells also serve as vents for rising hot air, which draws cool air from the lower stories of the house and allows for exchange of cool air with the outside. =Hierarchy= A tomb mural of Xinzhou, dated to the Northern Qi (550-577 AD) period, showing a hall with a tiled roof, dougong brackets, and doors with giant door knockers (perhaps made of bronze) The projected hierarchy and importance and uses of buildings in traditional Chinese architecture are based on the strict placement of buildings in a property/complex. Buildings with doors facing the front of the property are considered more important than those facing the sides. Buildings facing away from the front of the property are the least important. South- facing buildings in the rear and more private location of the property with higher exposure to sunlight are held in higher esteem and reserved for elder members of the family or ancestral plaques. Buildings facing east and west are generally for junior members or branches of the family, while buildings near the front are typically for servants and hired help. Front-facing buildings in the back of properties are used particularly for rooms of celebratory rites and for the placement of ancestral halls and plaques. In multiple courtyard complexes, central courtyards and their buildings are considered more important than peripheral ones, the latter typically being used as storage or servants‚Äô rooms or kitchens. = Horizontal emphasis = Classical Chinese buildings, especially those of the wealthy, are built with an emphasis on breadth and less on height, featuring an enclosed heavy platform and a large roof that floats over this base, with the vertical walls not well emphasized. Buildings that were too high and large were considered unsightly, and therefore generally avoided. Chinese architecture stresses the visual impact of the width of the buildings, using sheer scale to inspire awe in visitors. This preference contrasts Western architecture, which tends to grow in height and depth. This often meant that pagodas towered above all other buildings in the skyline of a Chinese city. The halls and palaces in the Forbidden City, have rather low ceilings when compared to equivalent stately buildings in the West, but their external appearances suggest the all-embracing nature of imperial China. These ideas have found their way into modern Western architecture, for example through the work of J√∏rn Utzon. = Cosmological concepts = Model of a Chinese Siheyuan in Beijing, which shows off the symmetry, enclosed heavy platform and a large roof that floats over this base, with the vertical walls not as well emphasized. Chinese architecture from early times used concepts from Chinese cosmology such as feng shui (geomancy) and Taoism to organize construction and layout from common residences to imperial and religious structures. This includes the use of: * Screen walls to face the main entrance of the house, which stems from the belief that evil things travel in straight lines. * Talismans and imagery of good fortune:  Door gods displayed on doorways to ward off evil and encourage the flow of good fortune  Three anthropomorphic figures representing Fu Lu Shou (Á¶èÁ•øÂ£Ω f√∫- l√π-sh√≤u) stars are prominently displayed, sometimes with the proclamation \\"the three stars are present\\" (‰∏âÊòüÂÆÖ sƒÅn-xƒ´ng-zh√†i)  Animals and fruits that symbolize good fortune and prosperity, such as bats and pomegranates, respectively. The association is often done through rebuses. * Orienting the structure with its back to elevated landscape and ensuring that there is water in the front. Considerations are also made such that the generally windowless back of the structure faces the north, where the wind is coldest in the winter. * Ponds, pools, wells, and other water sources are usually built into the structure. * Aligning a building along a north/south axis, with the building facing south and the two sides facing east and west respectively. The use of certain colors, numbers and the cardinal directions in traditional Chinese architecture reflected the belief in a type of immanence, where the nature of a thing could be wholly contained in its own form. Beijing and Chang'an are examples of traditional Chinese town planning that represents these cosmological concepts. Architectural types There are various types of Chinese architecture. Some of these relate to the associated use of the structures, such as whether they were built for royals, commoners, or the religious. = Commoners = Due to primarily wooden construction and poor maintenance, far fewer examples of commoner's homes survive to this day compared to those of nobles. According to Matthew Korman, the average commoner's home did not change much, even centuries after the establishment of the universal style, such as early-20th-century homes, were very similar to late and mid imperial homes in layout and construction. These homes, be they those of bureaucrats, merchants or farmers, tended to follow a set pattern: the center of the building would be a shrine for the deities and the ancestors, which would also be used during festivities. On its two sides were bedrooms for the elders; the two wings of the building (known as \\"guardian dragons\\" by the Chinese) were for the junior members of the family, as well as the living room, the dining room, and the kitchen, although sometimes the living room could be very close to the center. Sometimes the extended families became so large that one or even two extra pairs of \\"wings\\" had to be built. This resulted in a U-shaped building, with a courtyard suitable for farm work. Merchants and bureaucrats, however, preferred to close off the front with an imposing front gate. All buildings were legally regulated, and the law held that the number of stories, the length of the building and the colours used depended on the owner's class. Some commoners living in areas plagued by bandits built communal fortresses called Tulou for protection. Often favoured by the Hakka in Fujian and Jiangxi, the design of Tulou also shows the Chinese ancient philosophy of harmony between people and environment. People used local materials to build the walls with rammed earth. There is no window to the outside on the lower two floors for defense, but it's open on the inside with a common courtyard and lets people get together easily.Wang, Shao-Sen; Li, Su-Yu; and Shi-Jie Liao (2012). The Genes of Tulou: A Study on the Preservation and Sustainable Development of Tulou (http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/4/12/3377/htm ). Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License. =Imperial= There were certain architectural features that were reserved solely for buildings built for the Emperor of China. One example is the use of yellow roof tiles, yellow having been the Imperial color; yellow roof tiles still adorn most of the buildings within the Forbidden City. The Temple of Heaven, however, uses blue roof tiles to symbolize the sky. The roofs are almost invariably supported by brackets (\\"dougong\\"), a feature shared only with the largest of religious buildings. The wooden columns of the buildings, as well as the surfaces of the walls, tend to be red in color. Black is also a famous color often used in pagodas. It was believed that the gods are inspired by the black color to descend to the earth. The Chinese 5-clawed dragon, adopted by the first Ming emperor for his personal use, was used as decoration on the beams, pillars, and on the doors on Imperial architecture. Curiously, the dragon was never used on roofs of imperial buildings. Only the buildings used by the imperial family were allowed to have nine jian (Èñì, space between two columns); only the gates used by the Emperor could have five arches, with the centre one, of course, being reserved for the Emperor himself. The ancient Chinese favored the color red. The buildings faced south because the north had a cold wind. Beijing became the capital of China after the Mongol invasion of the 13th century, completing the easterly migration of the Chinese capital begun since the Jin dynasty. The Ming uprising in 1368 reasserted Chinese authority and fixed Beijing as the seat of imperial power for the next five centuries. The Emperor and the Empress lived in palaces on the central axis of the Forbidden City, the Crown Prince at the eastern side, and the concubines at the back (therefore the numerous imperial concubines were often referred to as \\"The Back Palace Three Thousand\\"). However, during the mid-Qing dynasty, the Emperor's residence was moved to the western side of the complex. It is misleading to speak of an axis in the Western sense of a visual perspective ordering facades, rather the Chinese axis is a line of privilege, usually built upon, regulating access‚Äîthere are no vistas, but a series of gates and pavilions. Tang-era Chang'an, as depicted in this 8th-century mural from Prince Li Chongrun's tomb at the Qianling Mausoleum in Shaanxi Numerology heavily influenced Imperial Architecture, hence the use of nine in much of construction (nine being the greatest single digit number) and the reason why the Forbidden City in Beijing is said to have 9,999.9 rooms‚Äîjust short of the mythical 10,000 rooms in heaven. The importance of the East (the direction of the rising sun) in orienting and siting Imperial buildings is a form of solar worship found in many ancient cultures, where there is the notion of Ruler being affiliated with the Sun. The tombs and mausoleums of imperial family members, such as the 8th-century Tang dynasty tombs at the Qianling Mausoleum, can also be counted as part of the imperial tradition in architecture. These above-ground earthen mounds and pyramids had subterranean shaft-and-vault structures that were lined with brick walls since at least the Warring States period (481‚Äì221 BC).Guo, Qinghua. \\"Tomb Architecture of Dynastic China: Old and New Questions,\\" Architectural History (Volume 47, 2004): 1‚Äì24. Page 12. =Religious= Nanchan Temple (Wutai), built in the late 8th century during the Tang dynasty A timber hall built in 857 during the Tang dynasty, located at the Buddhist Foguang Temple of Mount Wutai, Shanxi Generally speaking, Buddhist architecture follows the imperial style. A large Buddhist monastery normally has a front hall, housing the statues of the Four Heavenly Kings, followed by a great hall, housing the statues of the Buddhas. Accommodations for the monks and the nuns are located at the two sides. Some of the greatest examples of this come from the 18th-century Puning Temple and Putuo Zongcheng Temple. Buddhist monasteries sometimes also have pagodas, which may house the relics of the Gautama Buddha; older pagodas tend to be four-sided, while later pagodas usually have eight sides. Daoist architecture, on the other hand, usually follows the commoners' style. The main entrance is, however, usually at the side, out of superstition about demons which might try to enter the premise (see feng shui.) In contrast to the Buddhists, in a Daoist temple the main deity is located in the main hall at the front, the lesser deities in the back hall and at the sides. This is because Chinese people believe that even after the body has died, the soul is still alive. From the Han grave design, it shows the forces of cosmic yin and yang, the two forces from the heaven and earth that creates eternity.Suhadolnik, Nata≈°a Vampelj (2011).

According to the theory of the traditional Chinese fengshui geomancy, it is a carefully planned ancient village and show the Human-Nature Intergraded Ecological Planning concept.Zheng, Shanwen; Han, Baolong; Wang, Dang; and Zhiyun Ouyang (2018).

Construction =Materials and history= Models of watchtowers and other buildings made during the Eastern Han Dynasty (AD 25‚Äì220); while these models were made of ceramics, the real versions were made of easily perishable wood and have not survived. Wood was originally utilised as a primary building material because it was very common. Also, Chinese people trust that life is connecting with nature and humans should interact with animated things, therefore wood was favored as opposed to stone, which was associated with the homes of the dead.Li, Lin; Tang, Lei; Zhu, Haihong; Zhang, Hang; Yang, Fan; and Wenmin Qin (2017).

However, unlike other building construction materials, old wooden structures often do not survive because they are more vulnerable to weathering and fires and are naturally subjected to rotting over time. Although now-nonexistent wooden residential towers, watchtowers, and pagodas predated it by centuries, the Songyue Pagoda built in 523 is the oldest extant pagoda in China; its use of brick instead of wood had much to do with its endurance throughout the centuries. From the Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907) onwards, brick and stone architecture gradually became more common and replaced wooden edifices. The earliest examples of this transition can be seen in building projects such as the Zhaozhou Bridge completed in 605 or the Xumi Pagoda built in 636, yet stone and brick architecture is known to have been used in subterranean tomb architecture of earlier dynasties. que (Èóï), in total height, located at the tomb of Gao Yi in Ya'an, Sichuan province, Eastern Han Dynasty (25‚Äì220 AD);Liu, Xujie (2002). \\"The Qin and Han Dynasties\\" in Chinese Architecture, 33‚Äì60.

Page 13. Remnants of the Great Wall of Qi on Dafeng Mountain, Changqing District, Jinan, which was once part of the ancient State of Qi during the Warring States Period (475‚Äì221 BC). The Great Wall of China at Mutianyu, near Beijing, built during the Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644) The earliest walls and platforms in China were of rammed earth construction, and over time brick and stone became more frequently used. This can be seen in ancient sections of the Great Wall of China, while the brick and stone Great Wall seen today is a renovation of the Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644). =Structure= *Foundations: Most buildings are typically raised on raised platforms (Ëá∫Âü∫) as their foundations. Vertical structural beams may rest on raised stone pedestals (Êü±Á°Ä) which occasionally rest on piles. In lower class construction, the platforms are constructed of rammed earth platforms that are unpaved or paved with brick or ceramics. In the simplest cases vertical structural beams are driven into the ground directly. Upper class constructions typically have high raised stone paved rammed earth or stone foundations with ornately carved heavy stone pedestals for supporting large vertical structural beams. The vertical beams rest and remain on their pedestals solely by friction and the pressure exerted by the building structure. *Structural beams: Use of large structural timbers for primary support of the roof of a building. Wooden timber, usually large trimmed logs, are used as load-bearing columns and lateral beams for framing buildings and supporting the roofs. These beams are connected to each other directly or, in larger and higher class structures, tied indirectly together through the use of brackets. These structural timbers are prominently displayed in finished structures. It is not definitively known how the ancient builders raised the huge wooden load bearing columns into position. *Structural connections: Timber frames are typically constructed with joinery and dowelling alone, seldom with the use of glue or nails. These types of semi-rigid structural joints allow the timber structure to resist bending and torsion while under high compression. Structural stability is further ensured through the use of heavy beams and roofs, which weighs the structure down. The lack of glue or nails in joinery, the use of non-rigid support such as dougong, and the used of wood as structural members allow the buildings to slide, flex, and hinge while absorbing shock, vibration, and groundshift from earthquakes without significant damage to its structure. Dougong has a special function. The rich people applied valuable materials to decorate the Dougong for displaying their wealth. The common people used artwork to express their appreciation to the house.Jin, Xia; and Shang-chia Chiou (2015). Architectural Features and Preservation of Ancient Residential Complexes of the Changs in Xiangan, Xiamen, page 458 (https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens- spatial-inf-sci.net/XL-5-W7/453/2015/isprsarchives-XL-5-W7-453-2015.pdf ).

However, with the reduction in availability of trees in the later dynasties for building structures, the use of load-bearing walls in non-governmental or religious construction increased, with brick and stone being commonly used. *Roofs: Flat roofs are uncommon while gabled roofs are almost omnipresent in traditional Chinese architecture. Roofs are either built on roof cross-beams or rest directly on vertical structural beams. In higher class construction, roof supporting beams are supported through complex dougong bracketing systems that indirectly connect them to the primary structural beams. Three main types of roofs are found: *#Straight inclined: Roofs with a single incline. These are the most economical type of roofing and are most prevalent in commoner architectures. *#Multi-inclined: Roofs with 2 or more sections of incline. These roofs are used in higher class constructions, from the dwellings of wealthy commoners to palaces. *#Sweeping: Roofs with a sweeping curvature that rises at the corners of the roof. This type of roof construction is usually reserved for temples and palaces although it may also be found in the homes of the wealthy. In the former cases, the ridges of the roof are usually highly decorated with ceramic figurines. *Roof apex: The roof apex of a large hall is usually topped with a ridge of tiles and statues for both decorative purposes as well as to weigh down the layers of roofing tiles for stability. These ridges are often well decorated, especially for religious or palatial structures. In some regions of China, the ridges are sometimes extended or incorporated into the walls of the building to form matouqiang (horse-head walls), which serve as a fire deterrent from drifting embers. *Roof top decorations: Symbolism can be found from colors of the eaves, roofing materials and roof top decorations. Gold/yellow is an auspicious (good) color, imperial roofs are gold or yellow. They are usually used by the emperor. Green roofs symbolize bamboo shafts, which, in turn, represent youth and longevity.

Miniature models Although mostly only ruins of brick and rammed earth walls and towers from ancient China (i.e. before the 6th century AD) have survived, information on ancient Chinese architecture (especially wooden architecture) can be discerned from more or less realistic clay models of buildings created by the ancient Chinese as funerary items. This is similar to the paper joss houses burned in some modern Chinese funerals. The following models were made during the Han Dynasty (202 BC ‚Äì AD 220): During the Jin dynasty (265‚Äì420) and the Six Dynasties, miniature models of buildings or entire architectural ensembles were often made to decorate the tops of the so-called \\"soul vases\\" (hunping), found in many tombs of that period.  Gender in Chinese homes and society  Beyond the physically creative architecture techniques that the Chinese used, there was an \\"imaginary architecture\\" that was implemented into a Chinese house. This imaginary architecture projected three major principles, that display a different set of messages about the relations between its inhabitants, the cosmos, and society at large, that each depicts a gender power imbalance. The first design principle was that the Chinese house was the embodiment of Neo- Confucian values. The values of the home incorporated prominently social values, collaborative values of loyalty, and values of respect and service. The values were depicted through how the Chinese home represented generations, gender, and age. Unlike western homes, the Chinese home was not a private space or a place separated from the state. It was a smaller community in itself. A place that sheltered a clan's or family's patrilineal kinship. It was quite common for houses to shelter \\"five generations under one roof.\\" In this patrilineal kinship, there are heavily influenced social concepts of Confucianist values from the Five Relationships between \\"ruler and subject, father and child, husband and wife, elder and younger brother and friends.\\"There is a large emphasis on the unequal relationship between the superior and subordinate. In the case of the relationship between husband and wife, it clearly was male-dominated. Despite this, the husband was still responsible for treating the partner with kindness, consideration, and understanding. The second aspect was that the Chinese house was a cosmic space. The house was designed as a shelter to thwart away evil influences by channeling cosmic energies (qi) through means of incorporating Feng shui (also known as geomancy). Depending on the season, astral cycle, landscape's configuration of hills, rocks, trees, and water streams, and the house's arrangement, orientation, and details of roofs or gates, an arbitrary amount of energy would be produced. However, since the cosmic energy was such an arbitrary concept, it would be used in both moral and immoral ways. The moral way is by adding Feng shui to a local community temple. Yet, it other times Feng shui would be used competitively to raise the value of one's house at the expense of others. For example, if someone built a part of their house against the norm, their house would be considered a threat. Since it was throwing off the cosmic energy. In one detailed account, a fight broke out over Feng shui.Additionally, this methodology was also incorporated inside the home. Symmetry, orientations, arrangements of objects, and cleanliness were important factors to cosmic energy. Even in poorer homes cleanliness and tidiness were highly desired since it would compensate for the cramped quarters. Sweeping was a daily task that was thought to be an act of purifying the room of pollutions such as dirt. As the Chinese historian, Sima Guang writes, \\"The servants of the inner and outer quarters and the concubines all rise at the first crow of the cock. After combing their hair, washing, and getting dressed, the male servants should sweep the halls and front courtyard; the doorman and older servants should sweep the middle courtyard, while the maids sweep the living quarters, arrange tables and chairs, and prepare for the toilet of the master and mistress.\\" Through cleaning, the gender segregation of the Chinese household can be seen. The third component was that the house was a space of culture, by depicting the Chinese view of humanity. The house was a domestic domain that marked the separation of the undomesticated world. Commonly symbolized through walls and gates. Gates were first a physical barrier and second a kind of notice board for the outside world. Walls were the boundaries of a patriarchal domain. The home culture was also a place where family rules could be enforced, causing divides in the upbringing of the inhabitants. Most commonly, there was a wide gender distinction. Women were often hidden away within the inner walls to do wifely domestic duties. While men would be house representatives. In terms of the marriage duties, \\"Men would grow up, marry and likely die in the house win which he, his father and paternal grandfather had been born and in which his mother would live until her death. Women would leave their natal home on marriage to become a stranger in a new house.\\" Women wouldn't be accepted into a new home until they sired a child. Often new brides would be treated badly by the senior members of a household. In extreme cases, junior brides were treated like unpaid servants and forced to do unpleasant chores. Additionally, to women, marriage was thought of as a descent into hell. \\"The analogy of the wedding process with death is made explicit: the bride describes herself as being prepared for death, and the wedding process as the crossing of the yellow river that is the boundary between this life and the next. Shes appeals for justice, citing the valuable and unrecognized contribution she has made to her family. Her language is bitter and unrestrained, and she even curses the matchmaker and her future husband's family. Such lamenting can take place only within her parents' household and must cease halfway on the road to her new home, when the invisible boundary has been crossed.\\" As a result of this, men and women faced two vastly different lives. The confinement of women was a method of controlling their sexuality. It was thought that women needed to be controlled so that they may not get pregnant by an outsider and then try to claim a state in the male's domain. In addition, wives were often represented as \\"gossiping troublemakers eager to stir up strife between otherwise devoted brothers, the root of family discord, requiring strict patriarchal control.\\"As a result, they were untrusted and were always considered to be involved in an illicit sexual relationship if they were in the company of another male. Even though a couple would be married, husbands and wives did not stay in the same private room for long. During the day, men would go out or work in their studies so that they can avoid any unnecessary contact with female relatives. Women weren't allowed to leave the inner perimeter. If a woman had to leave the inner perimeter, they must cover their face with a veil or her sleeve. However, the inner quarters did provide women with some control over the patriarchal order. Since they had their own private room that men were not usually permitted to enter. On all social levels and aspects of the Chinese home, the seclusion of women was ingrained into society. A married woman was a virtually a prisoner in her husband's domain while the husband \\"never had to leave his parents or his home, he knew which lineage and which landscape he belonged to from the time he began to understand the world.\\"  Influence from outside of China  Despite largely being self-developing, there have been periods where Chinese architecture received significant influence from abroad, particularly during conquest dynasties such as the Yuan and Qing, who tended to be more outward-looking. The ruins of the Yuan capital of Khanbaliq under the Forbidden City in Beijing were analysed by scholars to be both distinct from previous styles and influential to many later architecture. Additionally the import of many Muslim officials, architects and scholars from the Islamic world during the Yuan led to an influx of Islamic design elements, especially in Chinese mosques. The Zhenghai Mosque in Ningbo city, Zhejiang province is a type of Islamic Architecture which appeared in China during the Song dynasty (990 AD). When the Arabic traders arrived at the big commercial city of Ningbo and settled down there, they spread the Muslim culture and built a mosque. Later, more mosques were built around Beijing.Hagras, Hamada Muhammed (2017).

The case itself is found in the mosques of Xi'an such as Xi'an Great Mosque and Daxuexi Alley Mosque. Beijing's Mosques also follow essentially the norms of Chinese planning, layout, design, and traditional wooden structure. There are many miniature pagodas in Northeast China. They were built by Buddhists during the Liao dynasty (907-1125), and the dynasty supported the practice of Buddhism. They developed some new types of Buddhist architecture building with bricks. Thus, one can find many such pagodas from Hebei Province to Beijing and Inner Mongolia.Kim, Youn-mi (2017).

Influence on neighboring Asian countries  The Gate detail at the Winter Palace of the Bogd Khan, in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia contains Chinese architectural influences. Chinese architecture has been influential in varying degrees in the development of the architecture of many neighboring East Asian countries. After the Tang dynasty, the era when much Chinese culture was imported en masse by neighboring nations, Chinese architecture has had a major influence on the architectural styles of Japan, Korea, Mongolia, and Vietnam where the East Asian hip-and-gable roof design is ubiquitous. Chinese architecture also has underlying influences in the architecture of various Southeast Asian countries. Certain Chinese architectural techniques were adopted by Thai artisans after trade commenced with the Yuan and Ming dynasty towards Thai architecture. Certain temple and palace roof tops were also built in Chinese-style and Chinese-style buildings can be found in Ayutthaya a nod towards the large numbers of Chinese shipbuilders, sailors and traders who came to the country. In Indonesia, mosques bearing Chinese influence can be found in certain parts of the country. This influence is recent in comparison to other parts of Asia and is largely due to the sizable Chinese Indonesian community. In South Asia, Chinese architecture has played a significant role in shaping Sri Lankan architecture, alongside influences from India and other parts of Southeast Asia. The Kandyan roof style, for example bears many similarities to the East Asian hip-and-gable roof technique which has its origins in China. The Chinese-origin guardian lion is also found in front of Buddhist temples, buildings and some Hindu temples (in Nepal) across Asia including Japan, Korea, Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Cambodia and Laos. Regional variation There is considerable regional variance in traditional Chinese architecture, some of which are very divergent from general layouts. Several of the more notable regional styles include: =Shanxi architecture= Shanxi preserves the oldest wooden structures in China from Tang dynasty, including the Foguang Temple and Nanchan Temple. Yungang Grottoes in Datong and numerous Buddhist temples in the sacred Mount Wutai exemplify the religious architectures of China. Shanxi family compounds are representative of vernacular architecture in North China. In the mountainous areas of Shanxi, yaodong is a type of earth shelter that are commonly found.

Pictured is a Mazu temple in Shek Pai Wan, Hong Kong. =Minnan (Hokkien) architecture= Minnan architecture, or Hokkien architecture, refers to the architectural style of the Hoklo people, the Han Chinese group who have been the dominant demographic of most of Fujian and Taiwan. This style is noted for its use of swallowtail roofs (heavily decorated upward-curving roof ridges) and \\"cut porcelain carving\\" for decorations.Hongyin, X. (2009).

Map showing Santa Rosa Island south/east of Pensacola, Florida (right-click map to enlarge). The Gulf of Mexico: the shining light in the back is from the sun's light being reflected off windblown particles of white sand from the beach. Santa Rosa Island is a 40-mile (64 km) barrier island located in the U.S. state of Florida, thirty miles (50 km) east of the Alabama state border. The communities of Pensacola Beach, Navarre Beach, and Okaloosa Island are located on the island. On the northern side of the island, are Pensacola Bay on the west (see map) and Choctawhatchee Bay on the east, joined through Santa Rosa Sound. Santa Rosa Island has weathered numerous hurricanes and other tropical cyclones, including the hurricane of September 1559, Hurricane Erin and Hurricane Opal (both in 1995), Hurricane Ivan (2004), Hurricane Dennis (2005), Tropical Storm Claudette (2009), and the remnants of Hurricane Ida (2009). Parts of the island are protected from development within the Gulf Islands National Seashore.  History  Santa Rosa Island was explored by Spanish Conquistadors circa 1519. Years later, an expedition led by Tristan de Luna arrived from Vera Cruz (of New Spain) in August 1559 to found a settlement. Spanish settlements in the area were abandoned in 1561, following damage from storms, lack of supplies resulting in famine, and conflicts with the Pensacola natives. The Spanish settlement of St. Augustine, Florida on the Atlantic coast, established on August 28, 1565, has been continuously inhabited since then. During the American Civil War, the Battle of Santa Rosa Island took place here on October 9, 1861.\\"Battle Summary: Santa Rosa Island, FL\\", NPS.gov, 2008, web: NPS-B-fl001 . Confederate Richard Anderson crossed from the Florida mainland onto Santa Rosa Island with 1200 men, in two small steamers, in a failed attempt to capture Fort Pickens (located on the west end of the island). The Union held the fort throughout the war. Considering Fort Pickens to be outdated, the U.S. War Department sold Santa Rosa Island in 1929 to Escambia County, Florida, for US$10,000. Ten years later, the county returned the island to the federal government in the expectation that it would be developed as a U.S. National Monument preserving the remnants of Fort Pickens. The fort and other areas are now preserved within the Gulf Islands National Seashore. On July 8, 1950 the federal government conveyed an parcel of Santa Rosa Island with of Gulf frontage to Okaloosa County. The county paid the federal government $4,000 to complete the transaction, which was supported by Congressman Bob Sikes.\\"Island Tract Turned Over To Okaloosa - Formal Transfer Completed With $4,000 Payment\\", Playground News (Fort Walton Beach, Fla.), July 13, 1950, Volume 5, Number 24, page 1. The portion of Santa Rosa Island transferred is now known as Okaloosa Island. The twelve-mile (19 km) long beach road onto U.S. Air Force property, west of the Okaloosa Island portion of Santa Rosa Boulevard, was unguarded and accessible into the 1980s, but heightened security concerns have since led to it being guarded or blocked at all times. Various military missile launch and test facilities exist on Santa Rosa Island south and southwest of Hurlburt Field. The island has been hit by many tropical cyclones; in 1995 it was the landfall point of hurricanes Erin and Opal. Hurricane Dennis hit the island in July 2005, and with winds, was the strongest storm to do so. Tropical Storm Claudette hit in 2009. In 2008-2009, a sunken Spanish ship was located and excavated offshore. These findings confirmed reports of the 1559 expedition by Tristan de Luna, which had established a settlement at Pensacola. One of the final missions in the Florida Phase of the US Army's Ranger School is conducted on Santa Rosa Island.

His baptismal name was Daniil. He was grand prince of Kiev (1203, 1206, 1207, 1208‚Äì1212); he was also prince of Chernigov (1204‚Äì1206/1208) and of Belgorod (1205). He was one of the most successful senior princes of the Olgovichi (the ruling dynasty of Chernigov): while he was senior prince, they for the first time established their rule over lands stretching from Halych through Kiev and Pereyaslavl to Chernigov. Architectural and circumstantial evidence suggest that he initiated building projects in Chernigov: he sent an artel‚Äô (a team of builders) to the town where it built the Church of St. Paraskeva Pyatnisa between 1211 and 1214. His early life He was the third son of Sviatoslav Vsevolodovich (who later became the grand prince of Kiev) by his wife, Maria Vasilkovna of Polotsk. Between 11 October and 24 December 1178 he married a daughter of duke Kazimierz II the Just of Poland (her name is unknown). According to some scholars on 14 November 1179, Svyatoslav Vsevolodovich brought a daughter of duke Casimir II of Poland (her name was AnastasiaAccording to other sources, her birth name was Maria; the name Anastasia was probably used after her marriage. according to the Lyubetskiy sinodik) as wife for Vsevolod. Vsevolod's patrimonial domain was located in the northwestern part of the Vyatichi lands. When Khan Konchak with his Cumans pillaged the Pereyaslavl lands as far as Dimitrov in February 1184, Svyatoslav Vsevolodivich sent his sons (including Vsevolod) and his troops to prince Igor Svyatoslavich of Novgorod-Seversk ordering him to pursue the tribesmen. Igor Svyatoslavich pursued the raiders, found them at the river Khiriya (a tributary of the river Vorskla), and took many captive. Enemy bands frequently pillaged the Poros‚Äôe district (the Ros River basin) and the Chernigov lands after 1187. In 1192, Svyatoslav Vsevolodivich sent his sons (Vsevolod, Vladimir, and Mstislav) to march against the Cumans. The purpose of the campaign (which was led again by Igor Svyatoslavich) was to plunder Cumanian camps; the Olgovichi ventured deep into the steppe, past Kursk into the upper reaches of the river Oskol. But the nomads assembled in great numbers and awaited the princes. Igor Svyatoslavich, on seeing that he was outnumbered, resolutely ordered his troops to steal away under the cover of darkness. His father died during the last week of July 1194, and his death changed the order of seniority among the Olgovichi. His only brother, Yaroslav Vsevolodovich became the new senior prince of the dynasty, and thus Vsevolod became answerable to his uncle. In the autumn of 1196, Yaroslav Vsevolodovich ordered Vsevolod and his brother, Mstislav Svyatoslavich to accompany him against grand prince Vsevolod III Yuryevich of Vladimir and prince David Rostislavich of Smolensk who were pillaging the domains of the Olgovichi. Prince of Chernigov and his struggle for Kiev In 1201, Vsevolod's brother, Oleg Svyatoslavich pledged loyalty to grand prince Rurik Rostislavich of Kiev who had summoned the Olgovichi to campaign against prince Roman Mstislavich of Halych. The latter, however, pre-empted their attack, and the Kievans opened the gates of the podol‚Äô to him; he forced Ryurik Rostislavich and the Olgovichi to capitulate. On 2 January 1203, Ryurik Rostislavich and the Olgovichi re-captured Kiev. Ryurik Rostislavich avenged himself against the Kievans; the chronicler declares that his devastation exceeded that caused by all previous attacks. Ryurik Rostislavich had no intention of occupying the town, but he could not leave Kiev without a prince for fear that it would return into Roman Mstislavich's hand. Accordingly, Vsevolod occupied the town. However, Ryurik Rostislavich evidently appointed his ally to Kiev until he could settle his dispute with Roman Mstislavich and be reinstated. In February, Roman Mstislavich marched against Ryurik Rostislavich; the latter submitted to him and to Vsevolod III Yuryevich. Roman Mstislavich also advised him to ask Vsevolod Yuryevich to reinstate him in Kiev and promised to support his request. Consequently, the grand prince of Vladimir forgave Ryurik Rostislavich and reappointed him to the town which forced him to sever ties with the Olgovichi. Some month later, however, Roman Mstislavich seized Ryurik Rostislavich and had him tonsured as a monk. Under the year 1204, a number of chronicles state that Oleg Svyatoslavich of Chernigov died, while others add that his son died with him. The chroniclers do not identify Oleg's successor at the time of his death, but later evidence confirms that his brother, Vsevolod replaced him. We may assume that, with the demise of Oleg Svyatoslavich's family, Vsevolod appropriated his brother's domains along with the territories Oleg himself had taken from his elder brother, Vladimir Svyatoslavich; thus, with the extinction of the lines of his two elder brothers, Vsevolod's family became the most powerful line of the Olgovichi. On 29 June 1205, Roman Mstislavich died, and two sons survived him: Daniil and Vasilko Romanovich. The Olgovichi marched to Kiev and met Ryurik Rostislavich who had reinstated himself there; they made a pact to attack Halych. The Olgovichi had presumably promised that, in exchange for Halych, they would support Ryurik Rostislavich's rule in Kiev. Although, they achieved nothing in Halych, Ryurik Rostislavich paid Vsevolod for his support by giving him Belgorod; Vsevolod, in turn, handed it over to his brother Gleb Svyatoslavich. In the early summer of 1206, Vsevolod assembled all the Olgovichi for a snem (a meeting) in Chernigov presumably to organize a second campaign against Halych. Vsevolod also invited prince Mstislav Romanovich of Smolensk; his Polish in-laws also brought troops, and at Kiev, Ryurik Rostislavich joined them with his troops. When the Galicians and Daniil Romanovich heard how large a force had assembled against them, they asked the king Andrew II of Hungary for help; even so, Daniil Romanovich fled to his patrimony of Volodymyr-Volynskyi. Meanwhile, Andrew II crossed the mountains and sent messengers to prince Yaroslav Vsevolodovich (a son of grand prince Vsevolod III Yuryevich) inviting him to rule Halych. On hearing that the Hungarians stood poised for battle near Volodymyr-Volynskyi, the Olgovichi dared not attack Halych. For many days neither side made a move; finally, after the king negotiated peace with the Poles and returned home, the Olgovichi also withdrew. At that time, the Galicians sent word in secret to Vladimir Igorevich (Vsevolod's cousin) asking him to rule Halych. On receiving their invitation, Vladimir Igorevich stole away at night from the Olgovichi without informing Vsevolod; he rode to Halych, and occupied it. The Galicians also gave domains to Vladimir Igorevich's brothers. The sources do not report the fate of Novhorod-Siverskyi and the Poseme towns (along the Seym River) after the Igorevichi vacated them; to judge from an earlier example of absentee prince, the vacated towns were probably administered by Vsevolod. After Vsevolod failed to take Halych, he took advantage of the large force at his disposal, snatched Kiev from Ryurik Rostislavich, and forced him to withdraw to Vruchiy. Vsevolod also sent his posadniki to all the Kievan towns. There can be no doubt that Vsevolod made generous concessions to the Rostislavichi (the members of the dynasty of Smolensk) to win their support: Ryurik Rostislavich's son, Rostislav Rurikovich returned to Vyshgorod and his nephew Mstislav Romanovich of Smolensk seized Belgorod. Vsevolod, however, evicted Yaroslav Vsevolodovich from Pereyaslavl, and in September, he returned to his father (grand prince Vsevolod III Yuryevich) in Suzdalia. Although his brother, Mstislav Svyatoslavich, was next in line for a major domain after his elder brother Gleb Svyatoslavich occupied Chernigov following Vsevolod's seizure of Kiev, Vsevolod bypassed his brother and gave Pereyaslavl to his son Mikhail Vsevolodovich. However, Ryurik Rostislavich, the erstwhile monk, was determined to regain control of Kiev. Consequently, soon after Vsevolod occupied the town, Ryurik Rostislavich expelled him with relative ease. This is not surprising because the troops that had helped Vsevolod to capture Kiev had returned home. His failure to barricade himself in Kiev also suggests that the townsmen deserted him, and he withdrew to Chernigov. In early 1207, Vsevolod marched against Kiev, but this time his attacking force constituted only his brothers Gleb and Mstislav Svyatoslavich with their sons; the Cumans came in the main to pillage. They pillaged around Kiev for 3 weeks but accomplished nothing and withdrew. Some time in the summer of 1207, Vsevolod assembled his brothers, his nephews, the Cumans, and the princes of Turov and Pinsk; prince Vladimir Igorevich of Halych also came to his aid. He approached Kiev via Trepol in order to disable Kiev's southern outposts and deprive Ryurik Rostislavich of their military assistance. Outnumbered and outmaneuvered, Ryurik Rostislavich fled to Vruchiy even before the Olgovichi reached Kiev. Vsevolod besieged Belgorod, where Mstislav Romanovich had barricaded himself, and forced him to flee to Smolensk. Next, he attacked Ryurik Rostislavich's nephew, Mstislav Mstislavich in Torchesk. Mstislav Mstislavich put up such a valiant resistance; however, when Vsevolod unleashed the Cumans onto his lands, Mstislav capitulated in order to stop their atrocities. In light of Ryurik Rostislavich's flight and Vsevolod's victories, the Kievans opened their gates. On hearing that Vsevolod had expelled Yaroslav Vsevolodovich from Pereyaslavl, his father Vsevolod III Yuryevich summoned his eldest son Konstantin Vsevolodovich from Novgorod, prince Roman Glebovich of Ryazan with his brothers, and prince David Yuryevich of Murom. On 19 August, Vsevolod Yuryevich set out for the river Oka to meet the princes of Ryazan. After the latter arrived, two of the princelings accused their uncles of conspiring with the Olgovichi against Vsevolod Yuryevich; after satisfying himself that the accused were guilty, he took them captive on 22 September and carted them off to Vladimir. Then Vsevolod Yuryevich marched against Pronsk, where Vsevolod's son-in-law Mikhail Vsevolodovich was prince who fled to his father-in-law. On October 18 Vsevolod Yuryevich captured Pronsk and took Mikhail Vsevolodovich's wife (Vsevolod's daughter) captive. After devastating the lands of Ryazan, Vsevolod Yuryevich returned home without attacking Chernigov. When Ryurik Rostislavich learnt that Vsevolod Yuryevich was devastating Ryazan, he rode post-haste to Kiev, drove out Vsevolod, and occupied the town. Vsevolod fled from Kiev with his wife and children. Vsevolod launched an attack against Kiev in late February 1208, but he accomplished nothing, and he must have derived some satisfaction from pillaging the environs of Kiev. However, Ryurik Rostislavich died that year; Vsevolod became the only claimant to the capital of Rus‚Äô, and he occupied Kiev. Grand prince of Kiev During the winter of 1210, Vsevolod and all the Olgovichi sent Metropolitan Matfey to Vsevolod Yuryevich, who had been razing the towns of Ryazan, requesting peace. The chronicler states that they submitted to him in all matters; Vsevolod Yuryevich undoubtedly demanded that the Olgovichi relinquish control of Pereyaslav. After Vsevolod submitted in all matters, Vsevolod Yuryevich released his daughter (the wife of Mikhail Vsevolodovich of Pronsk). Nevertheless, Vsevolod Yuryevich kept the princes of Ryazan in chains and refused to forgive them. Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir In the following year (on 10 April 1211), Vsevolod Yuryevich's son Yuri Vsevolodovich and Vsevolod's daughter Agafia Vsevolodovna were married in the Cathedral of the Mother of God in Vladimir; Vsevolod attended with his court. In September 1211, Daniil Romanovich attacked the Olgovichi in Halych and captured the towns ruled by them. The Galician boyars hanged three of Vsevolod's relatives (Roman Igorovich, Svyatoslav Igorovich, and Rostislav Romanovich). If the information of a late chronicle is true, Roman and Svyatoslav's wives and children were executed with them. Consequently, the Igorevichi were reduced to one family, that of Vladimir Igorevich. In appropriating the patrimonies of the two executed Igorevichi, Vsevolod increased his personal holdings. The hangings in Halych were an unforgivable insult to the Olgovichi, and the ignominious murder of three of their princes called for unmitigated reprisals. At the beginning of 1212, Vsevolod waged war against the Rostislavichi. Surprisingly, he unleashed his wrath neither against the Galicians nor against Daniil Romanovich; instead, he accused the minor Rostislavichi ruling insignificant domains in the Kievan land of killing his relatives, and expelled them. In June 1212, the Rostislavichi launched a major offensive against Vsevolod to reclaim their lands. In addition to the troops that Mstislav Romanovich mustered from the Smolensk domains, Mstislav Mstislavich set out on 8 June, with the Novgorodian militia. The attackers pillaged many districts belonging to the Olgovichi beginning with Rechitsa which shows that they came down the right bank of the Dnieper River. The Holy Saviour Cathedral of Chernihiv (1030s) Vsevolod and his relatives confronted the attackers at Vyshgorod; but the Rostislavichi occupied the town. As the Rostislavichi pillaged the towns of the Olgovichi on their march to Kiev, their slow approach allowed the beleaguered inhabitants to warn Vsevolod of the advancing enemy. Accordingly, he had time to summon reinforcements, but the easy victory of the Rostislavichi suggests that they still greatly outnumbered the Olgovichi. Vsevolod fled from Kiev for the third time and sought safety in Chernigov. Although the Rostislavichi pursued him, they failed to capture the well-defended citadel. After some two weeks they succeeded only in setting fire to the outer town and in pillaging surrounding villages. As they passed their attack, Vsevolod died. As the former prince of Chernigov he was interred inside the Holy Saviour Cathedral.

The term is sometimes used to cover all Haredi Jews who follow a \\"Lithuanian\\" (Ashkenazi, non-Hasidic) style of life and learning, whatever their ethnic background. The area where Lithuanian Jews lived is referred to in Yiddish as , hence the Hebrew term (). Lithuania was historically home to a large and influential Jewish community that either fled the country or were murdered during The Holocaust in Lithuania. Before World War II, the Lithuanian Jewish population was some 160,000, about 7% of the total population.\\"Lithuania\\". United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Retrieved 2016-04-19. Vilnius had a Jewish community of nearly 100,000, about 45% of the city's total population. There were over 110 synagogues and 10 yeshivas in Vilnius alone. About 2,000 Jews were counted in Lithuania during the 2005 census.Lithuanian population by ethnicity Etymology The Yiddish adjective means \\"Lithuanian\\": the noun for a Lithuanian Jew is . The term itself originates from , a Polish term denoting \\"a man from Lithuania\\", which however went out of use before the 19th century, having been supplanted in this meaning by , only to be revived around 1880 in the narrower meaning of \\"a Lithuanian Jew\\". The \\"Lithuania\\" meant here is the territory of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Of the main Yiddish dialects in Europe, the Litvishe Yiddish (Lithuanian Yiddish) dialect was spoken by Jews in Lithuania, Belarus, Latvia, Estonia and northeastern Poland, including Suwa≈Çki, ≈Åom≈ºa, and Bia≈Çystok. However, following the dispute between the Hasidim and the Misnagdim, in which the Lithuanian academies were the heartland of opposition to Hasidism, \\"Lithuanian\\" came to have the connotation of Misnagdic (non-Hasidic) Judaism generally, and to be used for all Jews who follow the traditions of the great Lithuanian yeshivot, whether or not their ancestors actually came from Lithuania. In modern Israel, (Lithuanians) is often used for all Haredi Jews who are not Hasidim (and not Hardalim or Sephardic Haredim). Other expressions used for this purpose are and . Both the words and are somewhat misleading, because there are also Hasidic Jews from greater Lithuania and many Lithuanian Jews who are not Haredim. The term (\\"opponents\\") on the other hand is somewhat outdated, because the opposition between the two groups has lost much of its relevance. is also problematic because Hasidim now make use of yeshivot as much as the Litvishe Jews. Ethnicity, religious customs and heritage The characteristically \\"Lithuanian\\" approach to Judaism was marked by a concentration on highly intellectual Talmud study. Lithuania became the heartland of the traditionalist opposition to Hasidism. Though outnumbered and named \\"misnagdim\\" (opposers) by the Hasidim, the Lithuanian traditionalists believed that their standard Rabbinic Judaism predated Hasidism and was Judaism in its original and authentic form. Differences between the groups grew to the extent that in popular perception \\"Lithuanian\\" and \\"misnagged\\" became virtually interchangeable terms. However, a sizable minority of Lithuanian Jews belong(ed) to Hasidic groups, including Chabad, Slonim (Hasidic dynasty), Karlin (Pinsk), and Koidanov. With the spread of the Enlightenment, many Lithuanian Jews became devotees of the Haskala (Jewish Enlightenment) movement in Eastern Europe pressing for better integration into European society, and today, many leading academics, scientists, and philosophers are of Lithuanian Jewish descent. The most famous Lithuanian institution of Jewish learning was Volozhin yeshiva, which was the model for most later yeshivas. Twentieth century \\"Lithuanian\\" yeshivas include Ponevezh, Telshe, Mir, Kelm, and Slabodka, which bear the names of their Lithuanian forebears. American \\"offspring\\" of the Lithuanian yeshiva movement include Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin, Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary, Yeshivas Rabbeinu Yisrael Meir HaKohen (\\"Chofetz Chaim\\"), and Beth Medrash Govoha (\\"Lakewood\\"), as well as numerous other yeshivas founded by students of Lakewood's founder, Rabbi Aharon Kotler. In theoretical Talmud study, the leading Lithuanian authorities were Chaim Soloveitchik and the Brisker school; rival approaches were those of the Mir and Telshe yeshivas. In practical halakha, the Lithuanians traditionally followed the Aruch HaShulchan, though today, the \\"Lithuanian\\" yeshivas prefer the Mishnah Berurah, which is regarded as both more analytic and more accessible. In the 19th century, the Orthodox Ashkenazi residents of the Holy Land, broadly speaking, were divided into Hasidim and Perushim, who were Lithuanian Jews influenced by the Vilna Gaon. For this reason, in modern- day Israeli Haredi parlance the terms Litvak (noun) or Litvisher (adjective), or in Hebrew Litaim, are often used loosely to include any non-Hasidic Ashkenazi Haredi individual or institution. Another reason for this broadening of the term is the fact that many of the leading Israeli Haredi yeshivas (outside the Hasidic camp) are successor bodies to the famous yeshivot of Lithuania, though their present-day members may or may not be descended from Lithuanian Jewry. In reality, both the ethnic make-up and the religious traditions of the misnagged communities are much more diverse. Customs of Lithuanian non-Hasidic Jews consist of: # Wearing of tefillin during non- sabbath days of the intermediate days of the festival chol hamoed. # The pronunciation of the holam as \\"ei\\". # Although not widespread and uniform among Lithuanian Jews, the \\"shin\\" being pronounced the same way as \\"sin\\". History Jews began living in Lithuania as early as the 13th century. In 1388, they were granted a charter by Vytautas, under which they formed a class of freemen subject in all criminal cases directly to the jurisdiction of the grand duke and his official representatives, and in petty suits to the jurisdiction of local officials on an equal footing with the lesser nobles (szlachta), boyars, and other free citizens. As a result, the community prospered. In 1495, they were expelled by Alexander Jagiellon, but allowed to return in 1503. The Lithuanian statute of 1566 placed a number of restrictions on the Jews, and imposed sumptuary laws, including the requirement that they wear distinctive clothing, including yellow caps for men and yellow kerchiefs for women. The Khmelnytsky Uprising destroyed the existing Lithuanian Jewish institutions. Still, the Jewish population of Lithuania grew from an estimated 120,000 in 1569 to approximately 250,000 in 1792. After the 1793 Second Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Lithuanian Jews became subjects of the Russian Empire. =Lithuanian Jews in the Second World War= The Jewish Lithuanian population before World War II numbered around 160,000, or about 7% of the total population.\\"Lithuania\\" (updated June 20, 2014). United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Retrieved 2015-04-14. At the beginning of the war, some 12,000 Jewish refugees fled into Lithuania from Poland;Levin, Dov (2010). \\"Lithuania\\". YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe. Retrieved 2015-04-14. by 1941 the Jewish population of Lithuania had swelled to approximately 250,000, or 10% of the total population. During the German invasion of June 1941, 206,800 Jews were murdered by the Nazis and Lithuanian collaborators. Notable execution locations were in the Paneriai woods (see Ponary massacre) and the Ninth Fort. Quoting the research done by H. G. Adler into Poland during World War II called , there were \\"80,000 Jews conscripted into Poland's independent army prior to the German invasion who identified themselves as Lithuanian Jews\\". Using different sources Holocaust researchers claim there were between 60,000 and 65,000 Jewish soldiers in Poland's independent army who identified themselves as Lithuanian Jews. LITVISH. An Atlas of Northeastern Yiddish by Dovid Katz. Cartography by Giedre Beconyte Culture Litvaks have an identifiable mode of pronouncing Hebrew and Yiddish; this is often used to determine the boundaries of Lita (area of settlement of Litvaks). Its most characteristic feature is the pronunciation of the vowel holam as (as against Sephardic , Germanic and Polish ). In the popular perception, Litvaks were considered to be more intellectual and stoic than their rivals, the Galitzianers, who thought of them as cold fish. They, in turn, disdained Galitzianers as irrational and uneducated. Ira Steingroot's \\"Yiddish Knowledge Cards\\" devote a card to this \\"Ashkenazi version of the Hatfields and McCoys\\". This difference is of course connected with the Hasidic/misnaged debate, Hasidism being considered the more emotional and spontaneous form of religious expression. The two groups differed not only in their attitudes and their pronunciation, but also in their cuisine. The Galitzianers were known for rich, heavily sweetened dishes in contrast to the plainer, more savory Litvisher versions, with the boundary known as the \\"Gefilte Fish Line\\". Genetics The Lithuanian Jewish population may exhibit a genetic founder effect. The utility of these variations has been the subject of debate. One variation, which is implicated in familial hypercholesterolemia, has been dated to the 14th century, corresponding to the establishment of settlements in response to the invitation extended by Gediminas in 1323, which encouraged German Jews to settle in the newly established city of Vilnius. A relatively high rate of early-onset dystonia in the population has also been identified as possibly stemming from the founder effect.

Service history On 8 July 1972, lay in Apra Harbor completing repairs prior to a patrol in the Mariana Islands. Typhoon Rita was approaching Guam, and Barb intended to be at sea and submerged before the storm arrived. Shortly after 04:00 hours, \\"Cobalt 2\\", a B-52 Stratofortress of the Strategic Air Command commanded by United States Air Force Captain Leroy Johnson, took off from Andersen Air Force Base, intending to fly over the storm. Soon after takeoff, however, the aircraft became uncontrollable, and the crew bailed out. By 05:25, the six-man crew were in the ocean. A C-97 Stratofreighter spotted the survivors, and Barb was ordered to proceed at best speed and effect rescue. At about 23:00, Barb surfaced about from the reported location. The heavy weather had already forced surface ships to turn back, and caused the round-hulled submarine to roll and corkscrew violently. It was 01:15 hours the next morning before the boat's crew spotted the survivors' lights. They made numerous attempts to rescue the airmen through the night, but did not succeed. By 07:40 hours, visibility had improved and the typhoon had moved from the immediate area, and the boat approached a group of three rafts. Several attempts to shoot a line to the survivors failed, so Chief Torpedoman Jon Hentz volunteered to swim to them, towing a line. At about 08:15, the rafts holding Major Ronald Dvorak, the Electronic Warfare Officer, Lieutenant William Neely III, the copilot, and Lieutenant Kent Dodson, the navigator, were secured to the submarine. Over the next hour, they were brought aboard, a task made more challenging by the waves that often exposed the submarine's screw and the ballast tank flood grates at the bottom of the boat. At about 10:00 hours, orbiting aircraft vectored Barb to the next survivor, Airman Daniel Johansen, the aircraft's gunner, who caught a line shot to him and was pulled aboard in less than a quarter-hour. Meanwhile, Gurnard arrived on the scene, found Captain Leroy Johnson, the aircraft commander, and brought him aboard. Lieutenant Colonel J.L. Vaughn, the radar navigator, had not survived the night. Aircraft sighted his body floating face down, still tied to his raft. The survivors were carried back to Guam, where each boat was presented the Meritorious Unit Commendation, and ten submariners who played perilous topside roles received individual commendations. Torpedoman Hentz received the Navy and Marine Corps Medal. Gurnard operated in the Arctic Ocean under the polar ice cap from September to November 1984 in company with one of her sister ships, the attack submarine . On 12 November 1984 Gurnard and Pintado became the third pair of submarines to surface together at the North Pole. In March 1990, Gurnard deployed to the Arctic region during exercise Ice Ex '90 and completed only the fourth winter submerged transit of the Bering Sea. Gurnard surfaced at the North Pole on April 18, in the company of the . Decommissioning and disposal Gurnard was decommissioned on 28 April 1995 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, was completed on 15 October 1997. One diving plane from the Gurnard was saved and used in a sculpture in Magnuson Park in Seattle, WA in 1998.

The population was 4,485 at the 2010 census. History According to Oregon Geographic Names, the name \\"Beaver Creek\\" was first used for a school district in this area in the early 1850s. It was named for the creek that flows through the community and into the Willamette River. A post office operated under various names in the locality until 1922, when the name was changed to Beavercreek, the form still used today. Beavercreek's ZIP code is 97004. In the summer of 2006, the citizens of Beavercreek voted to become Oregon's first hamlet, a system of quasi-government which exists in Clackamas County, Oregon. A final hearing by the board of county commissioners on the formation of the hamlet took place in September 2006, and officially recognized the community as The Hamlet of Beavercreek. The hamlet holds monthly community meetings at the Beavercreek Grange hall, except for quarterly town hall meetings, which may be held at other locations to accommodate attendance. Education The community is served by the Oregon City School District, Canby School District,http://www.canby.k12.or.us/ Colton School District, and Molalla River School District. Beavercreek Elementary School is located in the Hamlet. Points of interest =Miller House= Just after 1900, the Miller family built a farm house on the corner of what is now Ridge Road and Lower Highland Road. The home was moved to keep it from being destroyed and is being restored by current Beavercreek residents Rick and Kassandra Young. The Miller House was the childhood home of Ava Helen Miller, who married Linus Pauling, the only person to be awarded two unshared Nobel Prizes (for chemistry in 1954 and for peace in 1962). =Geocaching= Beavercreek is the birthplace of geocaching.

He was the son of Roman Rostislavich. Mstislav defeated an invading Hungarian army in 1221. In April 1223, the Mongols of Genghis Khan sent an envoy of ten ambassadors to negotiate a surrender or alliance. The Russians haughtily executed them all.

Introduced in 1983 as the 1.6-litre F6, this engine was found in the Mazda B-Series truck and Mazda G platform models such as Mazda 626/Capella as well as many other models internationally including Mazda Bongo and Ford Freda clone, Mazda B-series based Ford Courier, Mazda 929 HC and the GD platform- based Ford Probe There were four basic head types within the F range, the diesel SOHC 8-valve (R-series), the petrol SOHC 8-valve, petrol SOHC 12-valve, and the petrol DOHC 16-valve. These heads came attached to multiple variations of the different blocks and strokes. Only the petrol 8-valve and 12-valve shared the same gasket pattern. It was built at the Miyoshi Plant in Miyoshi, Hiroshima, Japan. Predecessors (VC/MA)  These engines are only the predecessors to the F-series engines, in no other way related. They were fitted to rear-wheel drive models in a longitudinal arrangement. This is in contrast to the successor engines that were designed for transverse front- wheel drive applications as had become the trend in the late-1970s and early-1980s. =VC= The VC is a overhead camshaft inline-four, with a bore and a stroke of . It was all new in 1975 and has an alloy eight-valve head on an iron block.

Fuel injection was available in 1981 and 1982. Other capacities were available in some markets, such as the NA 1.6 L, but this engine is closer related to the smaller fours used in the Familia/323. Later on, this engine was designated the F.

It uses the same exhaust cam, but a different intake cam with less lift and a long, single-runner intake manifold. The F8 is usually identified by its unpainted cam cover. Output was at 6000 rpm and at 5000 rpm. It is usually found in wagon variants. Applications: * 1988‚Äì1996 Mazda Capella/626 * 1990-1992 Mazda Persona/Eunos 300 FE The FE has a square bore and stroke. It was available as an 8-valve SOHC and 12-valve SOHC.

Commonly called the FE3 because of its head castings, it was used in some 626s from Europe, New Zealand and Japan; but not the U.S. or Australia. After the GD platform stopped production in 1992, FE-DOHCs continued production until the end of the GV wagon in 1997. The FE-DOHC was also produced under license by Kia for the 1995+ Kia Sportage. The FE-DOHC shares the same dimensions as the original FE-SOHC, including the square bore x stroke and it has an ideal 1.74 rod/stroke ratio. The FE-DOHC is usually identified by a gold coloured cam cover, however not always. There were at least five different FE-DOHC engines available with various compression ratio, camshaft and ECU tuning combinations however none were fitted with a turbocharger from the factory. Unlike many DOHC engines, this engine has a non-interference valvetrain design, making periodic timing belt changes important but not vital to the engine's life. Should the timing belt break the engine shouldn't need to be replaced as piston and valvetrain damage is unlikely.

Internally the engine retains its bore and stroke of , but has a lower compression ratio of 7.8:1. It produces at 4300 rpm and . It is rumored that this figure was produced at the drive wheels, as this engine was suspected to be under-rated. However Mazda had only ever quoted these figures as SAE Net and DIN which are crankshaft rating standards, as required by law in the countries where the cars were sold. Due to the increased torque output, Mazda was forced to increase the strength of the transmission for the F2T, producing the H-type, the strongest FWD gearbox Mazda produced at the time. Applications: * Mazda 626 GT * Mazda MX-6 GT * Ford Probe GT * Ford Telstar TX5 Turbo R-series The R-series engines are diesel variants that are very closely related to the F-series, sharing essentially the same engine block. Later engines with 'F' nomenclature The FS and FP are structurally different from the original F-blocks with much smaller bore spacing, much shorter deck height and smaller head and journal dimensions. The FS and FP are more closely related to the Mazda BP engine than they are with the original F-engine. =FS= The FS has a bore and stroke of and produces and in its most common variant up to in the Japanese domestic market. In 1998 the engine evolved into the FS-DE by undergoing several changes, most notably a distributorless ignition as well as the move from hydraulic lifters to solid shim-on-bucket lifters. Japan received a couple of variations of the FS motor, all with increased power outputs. The highest being the Mazdaspeed Familia version of the FS-ZE which produced . Mazdaspeed US decided to turbocharge the US FS-DE, known as the FS- DET in 2003 for the Mazdaspeed Proteg√© and it generated and , the same hp rating as the naturally aspirated Mazdaspeed Familia edition FS-ZE but with a sharper torque curve. This means that the Mazdaspeed Proteg√©'s engine is internally identical to the regular FS-DE, except with a turbocharger installed. The updated FS-DE engine did enjoy a few minor technical features, such as: * Oil Squirters * VICS (Variable Inertial Charge System) - A system that can vary the volume of the intake manifold resulting in a broader power band. There were known issues with this system, the most noteworthy was a defect which allowed screws that secured the VICS butterfly valves to come loose and end up being sucked into the engine. Some engines had to be replaced entirely due to the extent of the damage caused. VICS recall information * VTCS (Variable Tumble Control System) - A set of butterflies in the intake manifold that would close to promote low emissions combustion under cold start at low engine speeds. These had a reputation of being noisy at times. * Windage Tray Applications: * 1993‚Äì2002 Mazda 626 * 1993‚Äì1997 Mazda MX-6 * 1999‚Äì2001 Mazda MPV (Japan) * 1999‚Äì2003 Mazda Capella * 2001‚Äì2003 Mazda Proteg√© * 1993‚Äì1997 Ford Probe * 1993‚Äì1999 Ford Telstar * 1999-2006 Kia Carens =FP= The FP is a destroked version of the FS, with a bore and stroke of . It produces and . This engine is often incorrectly called the F8, which is the earlier destroked engine based on the FE. The FP enjoys a much better power band vs the FS due to slightly different camshafts and a better rod ratio over the regular FS-DE. The FP is very close to the FS in many ways and shares a large percentage of parts but has its own FP specific block, crank, rods, pistons and timing belt. The pistons for the FS produce a compression ratio of 9.1:1 (USDM) but when FP pistons are used in the FS they yield 9.7:1 compression ratio. The biggest performance difference is that the European 1.8L FP & 2.0L FS both have maximum compression of vs the North American 2.0L FS which has a maximum compression of .

It was held concurrently with the Toronto External Contracts Inquiry. Background On January 1, 1998, the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto and its six lower-tier cities (Toronto, Scarborough, North York, Etobicoke, East York and York) were amalgamated into the single \\"megacity\\" of Toronto. In one of the new city's first official acts of business, computer equipment was leased for city councillors' offices from MFP Financial Services, at a value of $1,093,731. City staff have not been able to produce any documentation to prove that this contract was awarded through proper procedures. In May, 1999, the city issued a Request For Quotations for its new computer acquisition needs. MFP was one of the bidders, and was awarded the contract in July of that year. MFP was contracted to provide $43 million of computer equipment to the city on a three-year lease agreement. However, the final lease agreement was not signed until after the 90-day price guarantee had expired. That fall, the city sold its owned computer equipment to MFP, and then leased it back as well. Over the duration of the agreement, the city paid $85 million to MFP, rather than the original $43 million approved by city council. As well, many of the equipment schedules were for five-year leases rather than three. Some of these leases were later restructured to extend the lease terms even further, resulting in additional costs. In December of that year, the city acquired 10,000 Oracle database licenses, again through an MFP lease. This turned out to be a serious overestimate of the city's actual needs. These issues came to light in late 2001, after an investigation by Toronto city councillors David Miller and Bas Balkissoon. In February, 2002, the Toronto Computer Leasing Inquiry was established by city council. The commissioner of the inquiry is Madam Justice Denise Bellamy of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. The Inquiry MFP's lead salesman on the city contract was Dash Domi, the brother of former Toronto Maple Leafs player Tie Domi. Much of the testimony presented to the inquiry alleged an improper financial relationship between Domi and former city councillor Tom Jakobek, the city's budget chief at the time of the contracts.\\"Did Dash Domi give Tom Jakobek a $25,000 payoff? The evidence says he did\\", Toronto Star, 13 September 2005, B1; John Barber, \\"The mystery of Domi's disappearing windfall\\", Globe and Mail, 17 September 2005, M1; Peter Small, \\"MFP cast keeping low profile - 'It's time to get on with life'; Computer scandal harmed reputations - Domi, Jakobek now in real estate\\", Toronto Star, 7 August 2006, B1. The inquiry was presented with evidence that Jakobek's name, along with other city staff, was on the passenger manifest for a flight, paid for by MFP, to a Leafs game in Philadelphia.James Rusk, \\"MFP had internal city data\\", Globe and Mail, 19 December 2002, A27. For several weeks, witnesses testified that they could not recall whether Jakobek was actually on the flight, but Jakobek eventually admitted that he had been present, and apologized for lying under oath.James Cowan, \\"Jakobek backtracks on letter: Shaken candidate tells inquiry he lied to his lawyer\\", National Post, 22 May 2003, A18. Some of Jakobek's office staff have testified that Dash Domi was granted special access to Jakobek's office, although other staff members have denied this.James Rusk, \\"Domi treated like VIP, Jakobek aide says\\", Globe and Mail, 2 September 2004, A10. The inquiry also investigated possible connections between a $25,000 withdrawal from Domi's bank account on November 1, 1999 and $21,000 in payments on Jakobek's credit card two days later.James Cowan, \\"MFP scandal: City wants police to investigate \\", National Post, 30 September 2005, A11; James Rusk, \\"The report that reads like a novel; Inspired by the 9/11 commission, Bellamy wrote the MFP story in narrative form\\", Globe and Mail, 27 December 2005, A11; \\"Did Dash Domi give Tom Jakobek a $25,000 payoff? The evidence says he did\\", Toronto Star, 13 September 2005, B1. Witnesses have testified that Domi called Jakobek and then parked for thirteen minutes in the underground parking garage at Toronto City Hall barely minutes after the bank withdrawal, although Jakobek has testified that he was not at city hall at all that day.Jim Coyle, \\"Judge eviscerates old civic guard\\", Toronto Star, 13 September 2005, A1. Both Dash and Tie Domi testified that the $25,000 withdrawal was a birthday gift for Tie (whose birthday is on November 1), and Jakobek has testified that the $21,000 payment on his credit card came from his father-in-law, former Metro Toronto councillor Ken Morrish, to cover a family trip to Disney World.\\"Money screams, Dash whispers\\", Toronto Star, 21 April 2004, A1. A forensic review of Jakobek's financial statements found that only a portion of the money actually came from Morrish, and the remainder in fact came from several family accounts Jakobek controlled, all of which had unexplained patterns of deposits in denominations of $100. This also included $11,000 from Jakobek's grandmother, who has a declared income of less than $15,000 per year.\\"Did Dash Domi give Tom Jakobek a $25,000 payoff? The evidence says he did\\", Toronto Star, 13 September 2005, B1. Members of Jakobek's family testified that the money they deposited in his bank accounts was connected to a real estate investment Jakobek and his brother Joseph made in the 1990s. Due to Joe Jakobek's financial circumstances, the money was being repaid to Tom Jakobek through an arrangement in which the brothers' parents made regular payments to Tom and were subsequently reimbursed by Joe whenever he could afford it. They have also testified that family members, including the grandmother, regularly kept unusually large amounts of money in their homes due to their mistrust of banks.James Cowan, \\"Jakobek's defence rests on a scrap of paper\\", National Post, 30 September 2004, A6. Ontario Provincial Police launched an investigation in 2005 at the request of the City of Toronto. The OPP decided there are no reasonable grounds to lay any criminal charges. Followup On October 1, 2002, an additional inquiry was authorized to investigate a related matters regarding other city consulting contracts. The Toronto External Contracts Inquiry convened on October 18, 2004, after the Computer Leasing Inquiry ended. Final Report Justice Bellamy released her final report on September 12, 2005. She found that the testimony of Jakobek and Domi was not convincing. She made 241 specific recommendations, which included the following: * The city should set out its own code of conduct for lobbyists and identify mandatory minimum standards. * The city should have a gift registry for items received by staff and councillors and the information should be available on a searchable database. * City staff who leave the public service should not be permitted to become lobbyists for the city for at least 12 months after they leave. * Politicians who leave office should not be allowed to lobby on matters they worked on. * The city should expand its current code of conduct for councillors and its conflict of interest policy for staff to include broader ethical considerations. * Establish a full-time integrity commissioner. * City staff should have more latitude to speak at council meetings. * The mayor should report to the public annually on the city's budget, audited financial statements and major contracts or tenders awarded. In a press conference the same afternoon, Miller (who was later elected the city's mayor) welcomed the findings, and indicated that he would refer the matter to the Ontario Provincial Police for further investigation. In response to a recommendation that that Mayor report one year after the Inquiry's final report on the progress the City is making, Miller submitted a progress report in September 2006. No Criminal Charges On March 15, 2010, the Ontario Provincial Police announced that no criminal charges would be laid over the computer leasing scandal.David Rider, \\"No charges in MFP scandal\\", Toronto Star, 15 March 2010 References External links *Toronto Computer Leasing Inquiry *City of Toronto's Inquiry website *Toronto Star article on the final submissions Computer Leasing Inquiry Ontario political scandals Judicial inquiries Leasing ","title":"Toronto Computer Leasing Inquiry"},{"id":"964657","title":"International border states of the United States"},{"id":"964668","title":"Jim Davis (actor)"},{"id":"964669","text":"Ahmed Kuftaro or Ahmad Kaftaru (Arabic: ÿ£ÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ŸÉŸÅÿ™ÿßÿ±Ÿà; December 1915 ‚Äì 1 September 2004) was the Grand Mufti of Syria, the highest officially appointed Sunni Muslim representative of the Fatwa-Administration in the Syrian Ministry of Auqaf in Syria.

Goldsmith, Cycle of Fear: Syria's Alawites in War and Peace, Oxford University (2015), p. 122 In 1878, the Kuftaro family moved to Damascus and settled near the Abu al-Nur mosque in the Kurdish quarter. Kuftaro's father, Amin Kuftaro, received a traditional education and started working at the Sa'id Pasha mosque. His first wife was Najiya Sinjabi and he had four sons and two daughters with her: Musa, Taufiq, Ahmad, Ibrahim, Zaynab and Fatima. With his second wife, Is'af Badir, he had three children, Rabi', 'Abd al-Qadir and Rabi'a.Muhammad Bashir al- Bani, Al-Murshid al-Mujaddid, Damascus, private edition 1979, pp. 57-69. He became a student of Isa al-Kurdi, from whom he has an Ijazah for the spiritual guidance Irshad of Sufi adepts in the Naqshbandi-Mujaddidi-Khalidi-Sufi order. Later Amin Kuftaro took over as the head of this particular tariqa. At the time there were many Sufi shaikhs and Sufi traditions present in Damascus. Ahmed Kuftaro was born in Damascus between 1912 and 1915. Classic education in Damascus Kuftaro's father insisted that he first receive a classic education in Quran, Tafsir, Hadith and Islamic jurisprudence, namely Shafi'i Madhhab with Muslim scholars in Damascus.Muhammad Bashir al-Bani, Al-Murshid al-Mujaddid, Damascus, private edition 1979, pp. 95-97 His father introduced him to Sufism and the Naqshbandi Sufi order. He was taught by Sufi masters Ali al-Takriti, Muhammad Abu al-Khair al-Midani, and Amin al-Zamalkani. He also went on at least one khalwa. In 1929, he married the fourteen-year-old Arab girl Hawwa Milli, who gave birth to his twelve children: Umar, Fu'ad, Khadija, Wisal, Muhammad, Muhammad Amin, Mahmud, Zahir, Hasan, Ihsan, Wafa', and Salah (who was appointed as head of the Abu al-Nur Foundation, now named the Ahmed Kuftaro Islamic Foundation).  Taking over as a Sufi shaikh  Kuftaro was appointed as the head of Naqshbandiya Tariqa by his father. In the early 1940s he supported a stronger cooperation among the Ulama of Damascus and claimed to have founded the Ulama Association in 1944. In the early 1960s, he gathered more than 2,000 male and female participants in the ancient Abu al-Nur mosque for his Thursday lessons on Islam and his Friday khutbah. From 1959 to 1964 he made 120 radio broadcasts. Unlike most Ulama at that time, he was open towards the media and used it.  Abu al-Nur Islamic Center  The Abu al-Nur mosque was originally built with clay and wood. In the early 1970s, it was replaced by a huge concrete building with seven floors flanked by two 65-meter minarets. It became the center of official state Islam in Syria and propagated a sharia-oriented interpretation of Sufism with an uncritical attitude towards the increasingly expanding police state under President Hafiz al-Assad. It housed a cafeteria for students with 450 seats and sanitary facilities. In an annex was the tomb of the Kuftaro family. On the first floor was an intermediary and secondary school in the morning and university lectures in the afternoon. The actual mosque with a huge prayer hall was in the center. In 1987, the Syrian government decided to close all Islamic schools across the country, including the Abu Al-Noor institute. Kuftaro changed the name of the school to Al-Asad Institute for Learning Qur'an the day before it was closed. The closure happened throughout Syria and allowed branches in each mosque in the country to open Qu'ran learning programs. The building also comprised private apartments for disciples of the shaikh, offices, a library, and a shop. In 1987, the Shaikh Amin Kaftaru Institute for Arabic Language Teaching was opened to male students and expanded over the years. In 1988, a language school for female students was opened next to the mosque. By the 1990s, four universities were receiving students globally.  Career in the Ifta' Administration  In 1948, Kuftaro worked as a mosque teacher in Quneitra before moving to Damascus in 1950. Two years later, he became Mufti of the Shafi'i Madhhab in Damascus and a member of the Higher Ifta Council under Colonel Adib al-Shishakli.Muhammad al-Habash, al-Shaikh Ahmad Kaftaru wa- manhajuhu fi al-tajdid wa-l-islah. 2nd ed. Damascus: Dar al-Shaikh Amin Kaftaru, 1996, p. 77 Kuftaro's political instinct aligned him with the Syrian Baath Party in 1955. He reportedly supported the Baath Party candidate in the 1955 election for an open seat in parliament.  The Grand Mufti of Syria  On October 26, 1964, an election committee consisting of 36 sheikhs met in the Ministry of Auqaf in Damascus; the Minister of Auqaf was also present. Two candidates stood for election: Hasan Habannaka al-Midani, who was extremely popular and had a high reputation as an Islamic scholar, and Ahmad Kaftaru. Kuftaro won by one vote and was appointed the new Grand Mufti of Syria. He headed the Ifta administration, which was part of the Ministry of Auqaf. In 1984 during his visit to Pakistan, a ruling decision added that the Grand Mufti should have a PhD and would hold the position for life. Kuftaro was awarded an honorary PhD from Omar Al-Farouq University in Pakistan, before being appointed Grand Mufti. Kuftaro survived more than seven presidents: * Husni al-Za'im 11 April 1949 ‚Äì 14 August 1949 * Shukri al-Quwatli 6 September 1955 ‚Äì 22 February 1958 * Hashim al-Atassi 21 December 1936 ‚Äì 7 July 1939 * Abdullah Rimawi 29 October 1956 ‚Äì 13 April 1957 * Munif al-Razzaz April 1965 ‚Äì 23 February 1966 * Nureddin al-Atassi March 1966 ‚Äì 17 November 1970 * Ahmad al-Khatib 18 November 1970 ‚Äì 12 March 1971 * Hafez al-Assad 12 March 1971 ‚Äì 10 June 2000 * Bashar al-Assad since 17 July 2000  Advocacy of interreligious dialogue  Ahmad Kaftaru advocated interreligious dialogue. He visited many countries as a representative of Syrian state Islam, including a 1985 visit with the Pope in Rome. He signed the Amman Message, a statement calling for tolerance and unity in the Muslim world that was issued on 9 November 2004 (27 Ramadan 1425 AH) by King Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein of Jordan.\\"Jordan's 9/11: Dealing With Jihadi Islamism\\", Crisis Group Middle East Report N¬∞47, 23 November 2005  References   External links  * Kaftaru Homepage * Obituary for Kuftaro in Islamica Magazine * Homepage of Shaikh Ahmad Kaftaru Center, former Abu al-Nur Center 1915 births 2004 deaths Syrian Kurdish people Syrian imams 20th-century Muslim scholars of Islam Syrian Sunni Muslims 20th-century imams 21st-century imams Syrian Sufi religious leaders Grand Muftis of Syria ","title":"Ahmed Kuftaro"},{"id":"964671","text":"The G family of Mazda engines is a family of large inline-four piston engines that was commercialized from 1989 to 2001.

It is now the site of a high-end, mixed-use \\"town center\\" development of stores, restaurants, apartments, townhouses, and condominiums. Garden State Park's 600 acre (‚âà1 square mile) land area is roughly bounded by Route 70, Haddonfield Road, Chapel Avenue, and New Jersey Transit's Atlantic City Rail Line. History Aerial view of the facility in 1995Garden State Park opened on July 7, 1942 after delays caused by raw material rationing at the United States' entry into World War II. Due to the seizure of 30,000 tons of structural steel by war authorities, developer Eugene Mori\\"Garden State Park ‚Äì Cherry Hill Township\\", Retrieved May 28, 2013. mostly constructed Garden State Park's ornate Georgian-style grandstand of wood. Limited amounts of steel came from the demolition of New York City's elevated railways. Despite this inauspicious start, 'the Garden,' as it was known, was officially 'out of the gate.' In its heyday, it would host some of the finest thoroughbred racehorses in the nation at the signature Jersey Derby. Its Garden State Stakes and the Gardenia Stakes offered one of the largest purses available to for two-year-olds. Horses raced at Garden State Park included Whirlaway, Citation, and Secretariat on a cold, rainy Saturday afternoon in early 1972 in the Garden State Futurity. Garden State Park's success sparked a wave of entertainment-oriented growth and development in the formerly rural community of Delaware Township, New Jersey (now Cherry Hill Township). Mori followed his achievement at the racetrack with the construction of the Cherry Hill Inn on the site of Abraham Browning's Cherry Hill Farm (at Route 38 and Haddonfield Road); and in 1967 the Cherry Hill Lodge, also on Route 38 to the east of the Cherry Hill Mall. Soon to follow in 1961 was the Cherry Hill Shopping Center (today's Cherry Hill Mall, the first enclosed shopping mall on the East Coast) and the super-luxurious Rickshaw Inn with its gold-plated roof, which was situated on Route 70 opposite Garden State Park. Diagonally across Route 70 on the map in then-Delaware Township was the Latin Casino, adjacent to the Rickshaw and the Garden. This dinner nightclub hosted acts like Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Liberace, Cherry Hill Estates neighbors Al Martino & Frankie Avalon and more; before closing due to competition from casinos in Atlantic City. Followed later by Atlantic City Race Course and Monmouth Park Racetrack (1946), Garden State Park became a crucial part of what was called the \\"Golden Triangle\\" of New Jersey racing. =Fire= This triangle would lose a leg on April 14, 1977, when a fire raged undetected at Garden State Park in the Colonial Room restaurant's kitchen during a racing program. Despite no functional firefighting system, the wooden grandstand would last long enough to allow more than 11,000 patrons and employees to escape the inferno. At 4:45 p.m., the walls and massive roof overhang of the grandstand gave way to the flames and reduced the structure to a smoking ruin. Despite the flying embers very nearly igniting The Rickshaw Inn across the street and the wooden barns & stables on the backstretch, the damage was contained to the massive grandstand complex. Three lives were lost in the fire. One patron (Ed Bucholski) and one employee were later found in the rubble, and one fire officer (John McWilliams) died of a heart attack on- scene. But, the very next day, the vault with the previous days' \\"take\\" was opened, with the money intact; while outside on the track, horses continued to train. =Rebuilding= Despite the stables on the east side of the track remaining open for training, Garden State Park no longer held races until securities trader Robert Brennan financed construction of a new $178 million steel and glass grandstand which opened on April 1, 1985. The first race that day followed the schedule from the day the original track burned. The track, running night programs, would provide racing for standardbred harness racing as well as thoroughbred racing. The grandstand also had on the Clubhouse level The Phoenix Room, which also served as a large banquet hall that hosted events year-round. On May 27, 1985, Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year winner Spend A Buck won the first Jersey Derby at the new Garden State Park, having earlier the same year won the Cherry Hill Mile and the Garden State Stakes, both at Garden State Park, and also the Kentucky Derby. The $2.6 million purse, including a $2 million bonus put up by Brennan for winning the four races, was the largest single purse in American racing history up to that point., Retrieved May 28, 2013. One of the controversial tax breaks the facility enjoyed was a legislative loophole that allowed a near total exemption from what would have been high county property taxes because it was categorized as a \\"farm.\\" It qualified for this special exemption because its operations generated horse manure that could be sold. The tax classification was allowed because the business \\"produced over $500 per year in agricultural products\\". Some of the important annual races at Garden State Park Racetrack include: *Gardenia Stakes *Garden State Futurity *Garden State Stakes *Jersey Derby *Vineland Handicap *Trenton Handicap Garden State Park never re-acquired its glamorous past. Over sixteen years, the track suffered from the apathy of New Jersey horsemen and New Jersey state officials, and unrestrained competition from the Atlantic City casinos. The final straw came when Governor of New Jersey Christine Todd Whitman vetoed legislation that would have permitted slot machines at New Jersey racetracks, a measure that possibly could have saved the Cherry Hill landmark. =Demolition= On May 3, 2001, 2,000 fans came to see the last racing program at Garden State Park. After 58 years, the Garden ran its last race. On October 30, 2003, with the property sold to Realen-Turnberry for a mixed-use 'town center' redevelopment, demolition started on the grandstand often referred to as a masterpiece. By late March 2004, all that remained of the racecourse was the original 1942 gatehouse on Route 70. Redevelopment Garden State Park was redeveloped into separate retail and residential sections, owned by M & M Realty Partners. The retail section includes Costco, Wegmans, Home Depot, Bed Bath & Beyond, Christmas Tree Shops, Dick's Sporting Goods, and Best Buy, and restaurants such as Five Guys Burgers & Fries, Panera Bread, Houlihan's, Chick Fil-A, and Starbucks Coffee, The Cheesecake Factory, Brio Tuscan Grille.http://www.gardenstatepark.net/market-place/index.php There have been plans by Parx Casino and Racing and Penn National Gaming, in a partnership, to build an Off Track Betting Parlor at the site of the former raceway near the lone standing entrance gate. On May 14, 2018, the United States Supreme Court struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992, paving the way for states to legalize sports betting. New Jersey's enabling legislation that regulates and taxes sports betting at casinos and racetracks will include the former racetrack. The planned OTB plans to offer sports betting in Cherry Hill.

The street's name does not refer to the LGBT character of Greenwich Village, or to any other LGBT issues. Rather, the name may come from a family named Gay who owned land or lived there in colonial times: a newspaper of May 11, 1775 contains a classified ad where an \\"R. Gay\\", living in the Bowery, offers a gelding for sale. Since it was once too narrow to be a full-fledged street, the City of New York widened it in 1833. As a result, Federal houses of 1826-1833 line the west side of the street, while on the east side, following a hiatus caused by the Panic of 1837, the houses are of 1844-1860, with remnants of Greek Revival detailing in doorways and window surrounds.Joyce Gold, From Trout Stream to Bohemia: A Walking Guide to Greenwich Village History (1988:86f); Gold notes that though it is the second shortest street in Greenwich Village, one cannot see its full length because of the angle at the center. The street extends from Christopher Street one block south to Waverly Place, between and roughly parallel to Sixth and Seventh Avenues. It runs through the site of a brewery owned by Wouter van Twiller, who succeeded Peter Minuit as Governor of New Netherland in 1633.

It was discovered by Charles Messier in 1780. William Herschel described it as \\"a beautiful cluster of stars, extremely rich, and so compressed that most of the stars are blended together\\". His son John noted that it was \\"all clearly resolved into stars of 12th magnitude, very loose and ragged at the borders\\". A 2012 view of M68 from the Wide Field Camera of Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys M68 is at a distance of about 33,000 light-years away from Earth and is orbiting through the Milky Way with a large eccentricity of 0.5. This orbit carries it as far as 100,000 light years from the galactic center. It is one of the most metal-poor globular clusters, which means it has a paucity of elements other than hydrogen and helium. The cluster may be undergoing core-collapse, and it displays signs of being in rotation. The cluster may have been acquired by the Milky Way galaxy through accretion from a satellite galaxy. All told, as of 2015 a total of 50 variable stars have been identified in this cluster; the first 28 being identified as early as 1919‚Äì1920 by American astronomer Harlow Shapley. Most of the variables are of type RR Lyrae, or periodic variables. Six of the variables are of the SX Phoenicis variety, which display short pulsating behavior.

M67 is not the oldest known open cluster, but Galactic clusters known to be older are few, and none of those is closer than M67. It is an important laboratory for studying stellar evolution, since the cluster is well populated, has negligible amounts of dust obscuration, and all its stars are at the same distance and age, except for approximately 30 anomalous blue stragglers. These blue stragglers are generally the results of mass transfer in binaries or stellar collisions. This artist's impression video shows a hot Jupiter exoplanet orbiting close to a star in Messier 67. M67 is one of the most-studied open clusters, yet estimates of its physical parameters such as age, mass, and number of stars of a given type, vary substantially. Richer et al. estimate its age to be 4 billion years, its mass to be 1080 solar masses, and the number of white dwarfs to be 150. Hurley et al. estimate its current mass to be 1400 solar masses and its initial mass to be approximately 10 times as great. M67 has more than 100 stars similar to the Sun, and numerous red giants. The total star count has been estimated at well over 500. The ages and prevalence of Sun-like stars contained within the cluster had led astronomers to consider M67 as the possible parent cluster of the Sun. However, computer simulations have suggested that this is highly unlikely to be the case. The cluster contains no main sequence stars bluer than spectral type F, other than perhaps some of the blue stragglers, since the brighter stars of that age have already left the main sequence. In fact, when the stars of the cluster are plotted on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, there is a distinct \\"turn-off\\" representing the stars which have terminated hydrogen fusion in the core and are destined to become red giants. As the cluster ages, the turn-off moves progressively down the main sequence. It appears that M67 does not contain an unbiased sample of stars. One cause of this is mass segregation, the process by which lighter stars gain speed at the expense of more massive stars during close encounters, which causes the lighter stars to be at a greater average distance from the center of the cluster or to escape altogether A March 2016 joint AIP/JHU study by Barnes at al. on rotational periods of 20 Sun-like stars, measured by the effects of moving starspots on light curves, suggests that these approximately 4 Gyr old stars spin for about 26 days - much like our Sun, which has a period at the equator of 25.38 days. Measurements were carried out as part of the extended K2 mission of Kepler space telescope. This discovery strengthens the solar-stellar connection, a fundamental principle of modern solar and Stellar astrophysics.

Displacements range from 1.8 L to 2.5 L. They all use a 27-degree DOHC valvetrain with directly actuated hydraulic bucket lifters. The K-series also features a highly rigid aluminum split-crankcase engine block design with 4-bolt mains with additional bolts securing the lower block, an internally balanced forged steel crankshaft with lightweight powder forged carbon steel connecting rods. They were designed with the intent of being as compact as possible for short-hood front-wheel drive applications. One unique innovation of the K-series was the introduction of Variable Resonance Induction System (VRIS). Based on the Helmholtz resonance principle, the intake manifold is equipped with 3 chambers tuned to a specific resonant frequency. The computer dynamically switches between each resonant chamber to achieve the appropriate resonant frequency for the engine's rpm. This effect optimizes volumetric efficiency over a given rpm range to provide maximum torque over the entire rpm range. VRIS is used on the K8, KF, and KL but nearly all modern Mazda V6s are now using this technology. The K-series all have a 7,000 rpm redline with 7500-7800 rpm limiter, which given the engine design is conservative. The KJ-ZEM Miller cycle engine had a 6,000 rpm redline, but was only available with an automatic transmission.

It employs the \\"Miller cycle\\" which uses a supercharger to increase compression efficiency by decreasing the compression losses (i.e., flywheel energy used to compress the intake charge in the cylinder); and thereby increasing the net power output of the V6. It was used in the T-platform cars. The supercharger used is the twin-screw type with electronic boost control. Power output was and .

In 1998 a revised version of the KL known as the KL-G4 was used in the 626. It featured solid lifters, a cast crankshaft to reduce rotating mass and a reworked intake system. The distributor was replaced with a Ford EDIS coil-pack ignition. Mazda introduced a key technology with these engines, known as the Variable Resonance Induction System (VRIS). A series of two butterfly valves coupled with electronically controlled actuators varied the volume and length of a resonant chamber within the intake manifold. The valves actuate at particular engine frequencies (i.e. rpms) to produce optimal torque/horsepower output at any given engine speed. The valve operates to create three specific first-order resonant frequencies that increase cylinder air charge. All three resonances are used from 0 to 6250 rpm (6800 for the KL-ZE). Above that threshold, the first primary resonant chamber is again used, but at this engine speed the pressure wave from the second-order resonant frequency aids in charging the cylinder. * KL- DE  1993-1997 Mazda MX-6 LS (A spec)  1993-1997 Ford Probe GT  1992-1995 Ford Telstar TX5 Ghia, TX5 Ghia 4ws  1993-1997 Mazda 626 ES, LX (after 1994)  1995-2002 Mazda Millenia L * KL-ZE  1997 Mazda Capella Wagon  1993+ Mazda 626 Jspec Sedan  1993+ Mazda MX-6 Jspec  1993+ Mazda MS-8 (Japan)  1993+ Mazda Eunos 600/800 (Japan) * KL-G4  1998-2002 Mazda 626 ES, LX External links * Mazda New Lightweight and Compact V6 Engines SAE article 920677 K V6 engines Gasoline engines by model ","title":"Mazda K engine"},{"id":"964726","text":"Robert P. \\"Bobby\\" Koch (born January 13, 1960) is the president and CEO of the Wine Institute, acting as its chief lobbyist in Washington D.C. and Sacramento, California.

Wankel engines were invented in the early 1960s by Felix Wankel, a German engineer. Over the years, displacement has been increased and turbocharging has been added. Mazda rotary engines have a reputation for being relatively small and powerful at the expense of poor fuel efficiency. The engines became popular with kit car builders, hot rodders and in light aircraft because of their light weight, compact size, tuning potential and inherently high power-to-weight ratio‚Äîas is true for all Wankel-type engines. Mazda put the engine into series production with NSU (Ro80) and Citro√´n (GS Birotor) as part of the Comotor joint-venture between 1967 and 1977. Since the end of production of the Mazda RX-8 in 2012, the engine was produced only for single seater racing, with the one-make Star Mazda Championship being contested with a Wankel engine until 2017; the series' transition to using a Mazda-branded piston engine in 2018 completely ended the production of the engine, although Mazda have proposed several concepts for the engine's future. Displacement Wankel engines can be classified by their geometric size in terms of radius (rotor center to tip distance, also the median stator radius) and depth (rotor thickness), and offset (crank throw, eccentricity, also 1/4 the difference between stator's major and minor axes). These metrics function similarly to the bore and stroke measurements of a piston engine. Displacement is 3radius¬∑offset¬∑depth, multiplied with the number of rotors (note that this only counts a single face of each rotor as the entire rotor's displacement, because with the eccentric shaft ‚Äì crankshaft ‚Äì spinning at three times the rate of the rotor, only one power stroke is created per output revolution, thus only one face of the rotor is actually working per \\"crankshaft\\" revolution, roughly equivalent to a 2-stroke engine of similar displacement to ONE rotor face). Nearly all Mazda production Wankel engines share a single rotor radius, , with a crankshaft offset. The only engine to diverge from this formula was the rare 13A, which used a rotor radius and crankshaft offset. As Wankel engines became commonplace in motor sport events, the problem of correctly representing each engine's displacement for the purposes of competition arose. Rather than force the majority of participants (driving piston engine cars) to halve their quoted displacement (likely resulting in confusion), most racing organizations simply decided to double the quoted displacement of Wankel engines. The key for comparing the displacement between the 4-cycle engine and the rotary engine is in studying the degrees of rotation for a thermodynamic cycle to occur. For a 4-cycle engine to complete every thermodynamic cycle, the engine must rotate 720¬∞ or two complete revolutions of the crankshaft. The rotary engine is different. The engine rotor rotates at 1/3 the speed of the crankshaft. On two rotor engines, front and rear rotors are 180¬∞ offset from each other. Each rotation of the engine (360¬∞) will bring two faces through the combustion cycle (the torque input to the eccentric shaft). This said, it takes 1080¬∞ or three complete revolutions of the crankshaft to complete the entire thermodynamic cycle. Obviously, there is a disparity. How can we get a relatable number to compare to a 4-stroke engine? The best way is to study 720¬∞ of rotation of the two-rotor engine. Every 360¬∞ of rotation, two faces of the engine complete a combustion cycle. 720¬∞ will have a total of four faces completing their cycle. per face times four faces equals . That's a well-reasoned number and now gives something that can be compared to other engines. In addition, since four faces passed by in the comparison, it‚Äôs like a four-cylinder engine. The 13B therefore compares well to a 2.6L 4-cylinder 4-cycle engine. By using the same formula, calculating actual displacement in which 1080¬∞ is the complete thermodynamic cycle of a rotary engine and a total of six faces completing their cycle, per face times six faces equals , in reference to a Mazda 13B rotary engine. \\"Each face has a swept volume of and there are a total of six faces. With this known, the engine displacement should be times six to equal .\\" 40A Mazda's first prototype Wankel was the 40A, a single-rotor engine very much like the NSU KKM400. Although never produced in volume, the 40A was a valuable testbed for Mazda engineers, and quickly demonstrated two serious challenges to the feasibility of the design: \\"chatter marks\\" in the housing, and heavy oil consumption. The chatter marks, nicknamed \\"devil's fingernails\\", were caused by the tip-seal vibrating at its natural frequency. The oil consumption problem was addressed with heat-resistant rubber oil seals at the sides of the rotors. This early engine had a rotor radius of , an offset of , and a depth of . L8A The very first Mazda Cosmo prototype used a L8A two-rotor Wankel. The engine and car were both shown at the 1963 Tokyo Motor Show. Hollow cast iron apex seals reduced vibration by changing their resonance frequency and thus eliminated chatter marks. It used dry-sump lubrication. Rotor radius was up from the 40A to , but depth dropped to . One-, three-, and four-rotor derivatives of the L8A were also created for experimentation. 10A The 10A series was Mazda's first production Wankel, appearing in 1965. It was a two- rotor design, with each chamber displacing so two chambers (one per rotor) would displace ; the series name reflects this value (\\"10\\" suggesting 1.0 litres). These engines featured the mainstream rotor dimensions with a depth. The rotor housing was made of sand-cast aluminum plated with chrome, while the aluminum sides were sprayed with molten carbon steel for strength. Cast iron was used for the rotors themselves, and their eccentric shafts were of expensive chrome-molybdenum steel. The addition of aluminum/carbon apex seals addressed the chatter mark problem. =0810= The first 10A engine was the 0810, used in the Series I Cosmo from May, 1965 through July, 1968. These cars, and their revolutionary engine, were often called L10A models. Gross output was at 7000 rpm and at 3500 rpm, but both numbers were probably optimistic (rpm of the crankshaft). The 10A featured twin side intake ports per rotor, each fed by one of four carburetor barrels. Only one port per rotor was used under low loads for added fuel economy. A single peripheral exhaust port routed hot gas through the coolest parts of the housing, and engine coolant flowed axially rather than the radial flow used by NSU. A bit of oil was mixed with the intake charge for lubrication. The 0810 was modified for the racing Cosmos used at N√ºrburgring. These engines had both side- and peripheral-located intake ports switched with a butterfly valve for low- and high-RPM use (respectively) Applications: * 1965‚Äì1968 Mazda Cosmo Series I/L10A =0813= The improved 0813 engine appeared in July, 1968 in the Series II/L10B Cosmo. Its construction was very similar to the 0810. Japanese- spec gross output was at 7000 rpm and at 3500 rpm. The use of less-expensive components raised the weight of the engine from . Applications: * 1968‚Äì1973 Mazda R100/Familia Rotary =0866= The final member of the 10A family was the 1971 0866. This variant featured a cast-iron thermal reactor to reduce exhaust emissions and re-tuned exhaust ports. The new approach to reducing emissions was partly a result of Japanese Government emission control legislation in 1968, with implementation starting in 1975. Mazda called their technology REAPS (Rotary Engine Anti Pollution System). The die-cast rotor housing was now coated with a new process: The new Transplant Coating Process (TCP) featured sprayed-on steel which is then coated with chrome. Gross output was at 7000 rpm and at 3500 rpm. Applications: * 1972‚Äì1974 Mazda RX-3 (Japan- spec) 3A Mazda began development on a single rotor engine displacing , and was designed for kei car use in the Mazda Chantez but was never placed into production. A prototype engine is on display at the Mazda Museum in Hiroshima, Japan.Mazda 3A engine on display at Mazda Museum 3A rotary engine, originally intended for the Chantez 13A The 13A was designed especially for front wheel drive applications. It was a two-rotor design, with each chamber displacing so two chambers (one per rotor) would displace ; continuing earlier practice, the series name reflects this value (\\"13\\" suggesting 1.3 litres). This was the only production Mazda Wankel with different rotor dimensions: Radius was and offset was , but depth remained the same as the 10A at . Another major difference from the previous engines was the integrated water- cooled oil cooler. The 13A was used only in the 1969‚Äì1972 R130 Luce, where it produced and . This was the end of the line for this engine design: the next Luce was rear wheel drive and Mazda never again made a front wheel drive rotary vehicle. Applications: * 1970‚Äì1972 Mazda R130 12A The 12A is an \\"elongated\\" version of the 10A: the rotor radius was the same, but the depth was increased by to . It continued the two-rotor design; with the depth increase each chamber displaced so two chambers (one per rotor) would displace ; the series name continues earlier practice and reflects this value (\\"12\\" suggesting 1.2 litres). The 12A series was produced for 15 years, from May 1970 through 1985. In 1974, a 12A became the first engine built outside of western Europe or the U.S to finish the 24 hours of Le Mans. In 1974, a new process was used to harden the rotor housing. The Sheet-metal Insert Process (SIP) used a sheet of steel much like a conventional piston engine cylinder liner with a chrome plated surface. The side housing coating was also changed to eliminate the troublesome sprayed metal. The new \\"REST\\" process created such a strong housing, the old carbon seals could be abandoned in favour of conventional cast iron. Early 12A engines also feature a thermal reactor, similar to the 0866 10A, and some use an exhaust port insert to reduce exhaust noise. A lean-burn version was introduced in 1979 (in Japan) and 1980 (in America) which substituted a more-conventional catalytic converter for this \\"afterburner\\". A major modification of the 12A architecture was the 6PI which featured variable induction ports.

In 1982 a 12A turbo powered Cosmo coupe was officially the fastest production car in Japan. It featured \\"semi-direct injection\\" into both rotors at once. A passive knock sensor was used to eliminate knocking, and later models featured a specially-designed smaller and lighter \\"Impact Turbo\\" which was tweaked for the unique exhaust signature of the Wankel engine for a 5-horsepower increase. The engine continued until 1989 in the HB Cosmo series but by that stage it had grown a reputation as a thirsty engine. * Original output is at 6,500 rpm, and at 4,000 rpm. * Impact Turbo output is at 6,000 rpm, and at 4,000 rpm. Applications: * 1982‚Äì1989 Mazda Cosmo * 1982‚Äì1985 Mazda Luce * 1984‚Äì1985 Mazda RX-7 12B The 12B was a short lived engine that was produced for the Mazda RX-2, and the RX-3. It had increased reliability from previous series, and it introduced a single distributor. This was the beginning of the single distributor rotary engines: the earlier 12A and 10A were both twin distributor Wankels. The improved 12B was quietly introduced in 1974. Applications: * 1974‚Äì1978 Mazda RX-2 * 1974‚Äì1978 Mazda RX-3 13B Wankel rotors of 13B The 13B is the most widely produced rotary engine. It was the basis for all future Mazda Wankel engines, and was produced for over 30 years. The 13B has no relation to the 13A. Instead, it is a lengthened version of the 12A, having thick rotors. It was a two-rotor design, with each chamber displacing so two chambers (one per rotor) would displace ; the series name reflects this value (\\"13\\" suggesting 1.3 litres), as with the 13A of the same displacement but different proportions. In the United States, the 13B was available from 1974 through 1978 and was then retired from sedans but continued in 1984‚Äì1985 RX-7 GSL-SE. It was then used from 1985-1992 in the RX-7 FC, in Naturally Aspirated or Turbocharged options, then once again in the RX-7 FD in a twin turbocharged form from 1992. It disappeared from the US market again in 1995, when the last US-spec RX-7s were sold. The engine was continually used in Japan from 1972's Mazda Luce/RX-4 through 2002's RX-7. =AP= The 13B was designed with both high performance and low emissions in mind. Early vehicles using this engine used the AP name.

RESI = Rotary Engine Super Injection. The so-called Dynamic Effect Intake featured a two-level intake box which derived a supercharger-like effect from the Helmholtz resonance of the opening and closing intake ports. The RESI engine also featured Bosch L-Jetronic fuel injection. Output was much improved at and . Applications: * 1984‚Äì1985 Mazda HB Luce * 1984‚Äì1985 Mazda HB Cosmo * 1984‚Äì1985 Mazda FB RX-7 GSL-SE =13B-DEI= Like the 12A-SIP, the second-generation RX-7 bowed with a variable-intake system. Dubbed DEI, the engine features both the 6PI and DEI systems, as well as four-injector electronic fuel injection. Total output is up to at 6500 rpm and at 3500 rpm. The 13B-T was turbocharged in 1986. It features the newer four-injector fuel injection of the 6PI engine, but lacks that engine's eponymous variable intake system and 6PI. Mazda went back to the 4 port intake design similar to what was used in the '74‚Äì'78 13B. In '86‚Äì'88 engines the twin-scroll turbocharger is fed using a two-stage mechanically actuated valve, however, on '89‚Äì'91 engines a better turbo design was used with a divided manifold powering the twin-scroll configuration. For engines manufactured between '86-'88 output is rated at at 6500 rpm and at 3500 rpm. Applications: * 1986‚Äì1988 Mazda FC3S S4 RX-7, * 1989‚Äì1991 Mazda FC3S S5 RX-7, Applications: * 1986‚Äì1991 Mazda HC Luce Turbo-II, * 1986‚Äì1988 Mazda FC3S S4 Turbo RX-7 Turbo-II, * 1989‚Äì1991 Mazda FC3S S5 Turbo RX-7 Turbo-II, =13B-RE= The 13B-RE from the JC Cosmo series was a similar motor to the 13B-REW but had a few key differences, namely it being endowed with the largest side ports of any later model rotary engine. Compared to the sequential turbos fitted to the 13B-REW on the FD RX-7, these sequential turbos received a large (HT-15) primary with a smaller (HT-10) secondary turbo. Injector sizes = PRI + SEC. Approximately 5000 13B-RE optioned JC Cosmos were sold, making this engine almost as hard to source as its rarer 20B-REW big-brother. Applications: * 1990‚Äì1995 Eunos Cosmo, =13B-REW= A sequentially-turbocharged version of the 13B, the 13B-REW, became famous for its high output and light mass. The turbos were operated sequentially, with only the primary providing boost until 470 rad/s, and the secondary additionally coming online afterwards. Notably, this was the world's first volume-production sequential turbocharger system.JDM Spec Engines - Mazda 13B-REW Engine Output eventually reached, and may have exceeded, Japan's unofficial maximum of DIN for the final revision used in the series 8 Mazda RX-7.

The main difference between the 13G and 20B is that the 13G uses a factory peripheral intake port (used for racing) and the 20B (production vehicle) uses side intake ports. It was renamed 20B after Mazda's naming convention for the 767 in November 1987. As a three-rotor design, with each chamber displacing , three chambers (one per rotor) would displace , and so the new series name reflected this value (\\"20\\" suggesting 2.0 litres). The three-rotor 20B-REW was only used in the 1990-1995 Eunos Cosmo. It was the world's first volume-produced twin-turbo setup. It was offered in both 13B-RE and 20B-REW form. It displaced per set of three chambers (counting only one chamber per rotor) and used of boost pressure to produce and . A version of the 20B known as the \\"R20B RENESIS 3 Rotor Engine\\" was built by Racing Beat in the U.S.A for the Furai concept car which was released on 27 December 2007. The engine was tuned to run powerfully on 100% environmentally-friendly ethanol (E100) fuel, produced in partnership with BP. During a Top Gear photo shoot in 2008, a fire in the engine bay combined with a delay to inform the fire crews, the car was engulfed and the entire car destroyed. This information was withheld until made public in 2013. 13J  The first Mazda racing four-rotor engine was the 13J-M used in the 1988 and 1989 (13J-MM with two step induction pipe) 767 Le Mans Group C racers. This motor was replaced by the 26B. R26B The most prominent 4-rotor engine from Mazda, the 26B, was used only in various Mazda-built sports prototype cars including the 767 and 787B in replacement of the older 13J. In 1991 the 26B-powered Mazda 787B became the first Japanese car and the first car with anything other than a reciprocating piston engine to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans race outright. The 26B engine displaced per set of four chambers (counting only one chamber for each of the four rotors) ‚Äì thus the \\"26\\" in the series name suggesting 2.6 litres ‚Äì and developed at 9000 rpm. The engine design uses peripheral intake ports, continually variable geometry intakes, and an additional (third) spark plug per rotor.  13B-MSP Renesis  Production Mazda Renesis in the Mazda Museum The Renesis engine ‚Äì also 13B-MSP (Multi-Side Port) ‚Äì which first appeared in production in the 2003 Mazda RX-8, is an evolution of the previous 13B. It was designed to reduce exhaust emission and improve fuel economy, which were two of the most recurrent drawbacks of Wankel rotary engines. It is naturally aspirated, unlike its most recent predecessors from the 13B range, and therefore slightly less powerful than Mazda RX-7's twin-turbocharged 13B-REW . The Renesis design features two major changes from its predecessors. First, the exhaust ports are not peripheral but are located on the side of the housing, which eliminates overlap and allows redesign of the intake port area. This produced noticeably more power thanks to an increased effective compression ratio; however, Mazda engineers discovered that when changing the exhaust port to the side housing, a buildup of carbon in the exhaust port would stop the engine from running. To remedy this, Mazda engineers added a water jacket passage into the side housing. Secondly, the rotors are sealed differently through the use of redesigned side seals, low-height apex seals and the addition of a second cut-off ring. Mazda engineers had originally used apex seals identical to the older design of seal. Mazda changed the apex seal design to reduce friction and push the new engine closer to its limits. These and other innovative technologies allow the Renesis to achieve 49% higher output and reduced fuel consumption and emissions. Regarding hydrocarbon (HC) emission characteristics of the RENESIS, the use of the side exhaust port allowed for about 35 ‚Äì 50% HC reduction compared to the 13B-REW with the peripheral exhaust port. With this reduction, the RENESIS vehicle meets USA LEV-II (LEV).http://www.rotaryeng.net/New-rotary-eng.pdf The Renesis won International Engine of the Year and Best New Engine awards 2003 and also holds the \\"2.5 to 3 liter\\" (note that the engine is designated as a 1.3-litre by Mazda) size award for 2003 and 2004, where it is considered a 2.6 L engine, but only for the matter of giving awards.\\"For the purpose of displacement equivalency, either the rotary engine total displacement needs to be doubled or the piston engine total displacement needs to be halved. (...) we say that a 1.3 liter rotary has equivalent displacement of 2.6 liters.\\" Source: In several countries where a car tax is based on cylinder displacement, rotary engines are taxed according to this displacement equivalency rule. You pay the same tax for a 2.6L piston engine as for a 1.3L rotary engine. This is because a 2-rotor wankel with chambers displaces the same volume in one output shaft rotation as that of a 2.6L four-stroke piston engine. Finally, it was on the Ward's 10 Best Engines list for 2004 and 2005. The Renesis has also been adapted for a dual-fuel use, allowing it to run on petrol or hydrogen in cars like the Mazda Premacy Hydrogen RE Hybrid and Mazda RX-8 Hydrogen RE. All the Mazda rotary engines have been praised because of their light weight. The unmodified 13B-MSP Renesis Engine has a weight of , including all standard attachments (except the airbox, alternator, starter motor, cover, etc.), but without engine fluids (such as coolant, oil, etc.). Known to make . 16X Mazda Taiki Also known as the Renesis II, made its first and only appearance in the Mazda Taiki concept car at the 2007 Tokyo Auto Show, but has not been seen since. It features up to , a lengthened stroke, reduced width rotor housing, direct injection, and aluminum side housings. Sales Outdated annual Mazda Wankel \\"rotary\\" engine sales without RX-8 and without industry engines (data source: Ward's AutoNews) Mazda was fully committed to the Wankel engine just as the energy crisis of the 1970s struck. The company had all but eliminated piston engines from its products in 1974, a decision that nearly led to the company's collapse. A switch to a three-prong approach (piston- gasoline, piston-Diesel, and Wankel) for the 1980s relegated the Wankel to sports car use (in the RX-7 and Cosmo), severely limiting production volume. But the company had continued production continually since the mid-1960s, and was the only maker of Wankel-powered cars when (the RX-8) was discontinued from production in June 2012 with 2000 RX-8 Spirit R models being made for JDM (RHD) market. Though not reflected in the graph at right, the RX-8 was a higher-volume car than its predecessors. Sales of the RX-8 peaked in 2004 at 23,690, but continued to decline through 2011, when less than 1000 were produced. On November 16, 2011, Mazda CEO Takashi Yamanouchi announced that the company is still committed to producing the rotary engine, saying, \\"So long as I remain involved with this company... there will be a rotary engine offering or multiple offerings in the lineup.\\" Currently, the engine is produced for SCCA Formula Mazda, and its professional Indy Racing League LLC dba INDYCAR sanctioned Pro Mazda Championship.  Future expectations  Mazda last built a production street car powered by a rotary engine in 2012, the RX-8, but had to abandon it largely to poor fuel efficiency and emissions. It has continued to work on the technology, however, as it is one of the company's signature features. Mazda officials have previously suggested that if they can get it to perform as well as a reciprocating engine they will bring it back, to power a conventional sports car. On November 16, 2011, Mazda CEO Takashi Yamanouchi announced that the company is still committed to producing the rotary engine, saying, \\"So long as I remain involved with this company... there will be a rotary engine offering or multiple offerings in the lineup.\\" On November 17, 2016 Senior managing executive officer of Mazda research and development Kiyoshi Fujiwara told journalists at the Los Angeles motor show that the company is currently developing its first EV in 2019, and it‚Äôs likely to incorporate a rotary engine, but that the details were still \\"a big secret.\\" He did say, however, that the car is likely to use a new- generation rotary engine as a range extender, similar in concept to a BMW i3. In 2013, Mazda displayed a Mazda2 RE prototype car, using a similar rotary range extender EV system. On October 27, 2017 Senior managing executive officer and R&D; Chief Kiyoshi Fujiwara told journalists that they were still working on a rotary engine for a sports car, that will potentially in some markets be with hybrid drivetrains, but both will have distinct powertrains from Mazda's first EV, which will be released in 2019/20. \\"...some cities will ban combustion, therefore we need some additional portion of electrification because the driver can‚Äôt use this rotary sports car. Some of the regions we don‚Äôt need this small electrification, therefore we can utilise pure rotary engines.\\" See also * Wankel engine * Mazda engines * MidWest AE series References  External links * Mazda rotary engine page * Mazda Rotary Engine Specialist Wankel Wankel engines World Sportscar Championship engines ","title":"Mazda Wankel engine"},{"id":"964736","text":"M69 or M-69 may refer to: * M-69 (Michigan highway), a state highway in Michigan * M69 motorway, a motorway in England * Marine Highway 69, a designation of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway which runs along the Texas coastline * Miles M.69 Marathon, an aircraft * Messier 69, a globular cluster in the constellation Sagittarius * M69 Grenade A training grenade * M-69 Incendiary cluster bomb ","title":"M69"},{"id":"964739","text":"Renesis may refer to: * Renesis (engine), an engine used in the 2004-2011 Mazda RX-8 * Renesis Player, a SVG 1.2 compatible renderer and viewer ","title":"Renesis"},{"id":"964746","text":"On right, with Vladimir Putin on left. 2000 Aslambek Akhmedovich Aslakhanov (–ê—Å–ª–∞–º–±–µ–∫ –ê—Ö–º–µ—Ç–æ–≤–∏—á –ê—Å–ª–∞—Ö–∞–Ω–æ–≤, born 11 March 1942 in Novye Atagi) is the State Duma deputy from Chechnya, advisor and former aide to Russian president Vladimir Putin.

The vessel was used by Sea Launch for equatorial Pacific Ocean launches. She works in concert with the assembly and control ship . Her home port is the Port of Long Beach in the United States. In her current form, Odyssey is long and about wide, with an empty draft displacement of , and a submerged draft displacement of . The vessel has accommodations for 68 crew and launch system personnel, including living, dining, medical and recreation facilities. A large environmentally- controlled hangar stores the rocket during transit, from which the rocket is rolled out and erected prior to fueling and launch. In September 2016 the platform along with other Sea Launch assets was sold to S7 Group, the parent company of S7 Airlines. History Ocean Odyssey in her original drilling rig configuration The platform was completed in 1983 for Ocean Drilling & Exploration Company (ODECO) by Sumitomo Heavy Industries. It drilled its first exploratory hole about south of Yakutat for ARCO Alaska, Inc. The rig cost about to build during the early eighties oil \\"boom\\". During construction the vessel was called Ocean Ranger II, and was renamed Ocean Odyssey after capsized with all hands lost during a storm off Newfoundland on 15 February 1982. When built, Ocean Odyssey was classed +A1 +AMS by the American Bureau of Shipping for unrestricted worldwide ocean service. She was a long, wide, twin- hull design with a propulsion system. The rig's structure was designed to simultaneously withstand winds, waves, and a current. The derrick was fully enclosed with a heated drill floor permitting operations down to . The rig had other advanced extreme-condition features as well. For example, the rig's columns were strengthened to withstand some ice impact and the marine riser had a feature similar to a cow-catcher to keep floating ice off the marine riser that connected the rig to the well on the ocean bottom. =1988 North Sea gas blowout= On 22 September 1988, Ocean Odyssey suffered a blowout while operated by ODECO (now Diamond Offshore Drilling) on hire to ARCO (now a subsidiary of BP), drilling the 22/30b-3 well on a prospect in the North Sea. The ultimate direct cause of the incident was a failure of the subsea wellhead equipment after a prolonged period of well control. During the resulting fire the radio operator, Timothy Williams, was killed. He had been ordered from the lifeboats and back to the radio room by the rig's manager, who failed to countermand the order when the rig was evacuated. Survivors were picked up by the rig's emergency standby vessel Notts Forest (38 rescued) and the nearby anchor handling tug British Fulmar (28 rescued). Four Sea King helicopters from and a Sea King from RAF Lossiemouth assisted rescue operations and transferred survivors from Notts Forest and British Fulmar to the drilling rig Sedneth 701. A Royal Air Force Hawker Siddeley Nimrod provided coordination on scene. The incident was featured in the 1990 STV television series Rescue episode \\"Missing\\". =Launch platform conversion= Ocean Odyssey spent the next several years as a rusting hulk in the docks of Dundee, Scotland. Her availability prompted Boeing to establish the Sea Launch consortium, for which she was bought in 1993 by Kv√¶rner Rosenberg of Stavanger, Norway, and renamed LP Odyssey. From late 1995 to May 1997, Kv√¶rner extended the length of the platform and added a pair of support columns and additional propulsion systems. The upper deck  the location of the former drill floor  was rebuilt to accommodate the launch pad and launch vehicle service hangar. In May 1997, Ocean Odyssey arrived at Kv√¶rner Vyborg Shipyard for the installation of the launch vehicle equipment itself. By 1999, the vessel was ready for service, and on 27 March 1999, a Zenit-3SL rocket successfully launched a demonstration satellite to a geostationary transfer orbit. The first commercial launch occurred on 9 October 1999, with the orbiting of the DirecTV 1-R satellite. =2007 launch failure= Odyssey at port, with Sea Launch Commander behind On 30 January 2007, a Zenit-3SL carrying the NSS-8 satellite exploded aboard Odyssey at liftoff due to a turbopump malfunction. There were no injuries, as the ship had been evacuated for launch operations. Damage to the launch platform was mostly superficial, though a flame deflector was knocked loose from underneath the platform and lost, along with damage to the hangar doors and antennae. The vessel was repaired at a shipyard in Vancouver, British Columbia. Odyssey returned to service on 15 January 2008, with the successful launch of the Thuraya 3 satellite. =2013 launch failure= On 1 February 2013, the Zenit-3SL rocket carrying Intelsat 27 suffered a failure after its launch from Odyssey, crashing a short distance from the launch platform. Its first stage engine appeared to shut down around 25 seconds after launch and telemetry from the rocket was lost about 15 seconds later. Telemetry indicated that excessive roll was detected 11 seconds after launch. The guidance system was programmed to shut down the engine, but only after the rocket was safely away from the launch platform. It is believed that a failure in a hydraulic pump that provides power for gimbaling the RD-171 engine was ultimately the cause. The launch platform suffered no damage.

The STB was established in 1996 to assume some of the regulatory functions that had been administered by the Interstate Commerce Commission when the ICC was abolished. Other ICC regulatory functions were either eliminated or transferred to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration or to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics within DOT. The STB has broad economic regulatory oversight of railroads, including rates, service, the construction, acquisition and abandonment of rail lines, carrier mergers and interchange of traffic among carriers. The STB also has oversight of pipeline carriers, intercity bus carriers, moving van companies, trucking companies involved in collective activities and water carriers engaged in non-contiguous domestic trade. The Board has wide discretion, through its exemption authority from federal, state and local laws, to tailor its regulatory activities to meet the nation's changing transportation needs. Performance and policy goals The Board provides a forum for the resolution of surface-transportation disputes and other matters within its jurisdiction. It has the authority to limit or remove regulatory requirements where appropriate. Organizational structure and current members The Board is composed of five members nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate for five-year terms. The Surface Transportation Board Reauthorization Act expanded the Board from three to five members in 2015. The Board's chairman is designated by the President from among the members. As its chief executive, the chairman coordinates and organizes the agency's work and acts as its representative in legislative matters and in relations with other governmental bodies. Chairman Daniel R. Elliott III was nominated to the Surface Transportation Board by President Barack Obama on January 13, 2015, was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on June 22, 2015, and was sworn in as the Board's chairman on June 26, 2015, for a term of office expiring December 31, 2018. Chairman Elliott is in his second term at the Board, having previously served as the agency's chairman from August 13, 2009, until December 31, 2014. The vice chairman represents the Board and assumes the chairman's duties as appropriate. Additionally, the vice chairman oversees matters involving the admission, discipline, and disbarment of non- attorney Board practitioners. Deb Miller was sworn in on April 28, 2014, as a Member of the Board for a term of office expiring on December 31, 2017, following her September 25, 2013, nomination to the Board by President Obama and her confirmation by the United States Senate on April 9, 2014. She was designated vice chairman (May 27, 2014 ‚Äì December 31, 2014); served as acting chairman (January 1, 2015 ‚Äì June 26, 2015); and was again designated vice chairman on January 7, 2016, in the agency's annual rotation of the vice chairmanship. Ann D. Begeman was sworn in May 2, 2011, as a member of the Board. She currently serves as chairperson. Martin J. Oberman was confirmed to the Board on January 3, 2019, by a voice vote in the United States Senate. Patrick Fuchs was confirmed to the Board on January 2, 2019, by a voice vote in the United States Senate. He currently serves as vice-chairperson. Assisting the Board in carrying out its responsibilities is a staff of 150 with experience in economics, law, accounting, transportation analysis, finance and administration. Offices =Office of Public Assistance, Governmental Affairs, and Compliance= The Office of Public Assistance, Governmental Affairs, and Compliance serves as the agency's principal point of contact with Congress, state and local governments, the media, industry stakeholders and the general public. This office includes the Rail Customer and Public Assistance Program, where Board staff solves problems in ways ranging from a simple answer to a telephone inquiry to lengthy informal dispute resolution efforts between railroads and shippers. =Office of Economics= The Office of Economics analyzes rate cases, conducts economic and financial analyses of the railroad industry, and audits Class I railroads. =Office of Economics, Environmental Analysis and Administration= The Office of Economics, Environmental Analysis and Administration is responsible for undertaking environmental reviews of proposed STB actions in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act and other environmental laws and making environmental recommendations to the STB. =Office of the Managing Director= The Office of the Managing Director handles administrative matters such as personnel, budget and information technology. =Office of Proceedings= The Office of Proceedings (OP) is the office with primary responsibility for developing the public record in formal cases (or proceedings) filed with the STB, making recommendations regarding the resolution of issues presented in those cases, and preparing the decisions issued by the Board. The Office of Proceedings is a legal office, consisting almost entirely of attorneys and paralegal specialists, responsible for the majority of the cases at the STB. The office applies the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by the ICC Termination Act of 1995, as well as the Board's own regulations.STB regulations are found at Title 49, parts 1000 to 1332 of the Code of Federal Regulations. (). In carrying out its responsibilities, the Office of Proceedings obtains and applies any necessary input from economic, financial, operational, environmental, and other legal staff experts throughout the agency. The Office of Proceedings includes a clearance unit responsible for tabulating votes on STB cases and recording the official outcome of those votes, and a recordations unit that enters data about a filing's primary and secondary documents into the STB Recordations database, which is accessible to the public on the STB web site. =Office of General Counsel= The Office of the General Counsel (OGC) responds to questions on a variety of legal issues. However, its primary mission is two-fold: to defend the STB's decisions in court and to assess the defensibility of agency decisions that might be challenged in court. Unlike most Federal agencies, the STB has independent litigating authority (). Under the Hobbs Act, when an STB order or decision is challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals, both the STB (represented by the agency's own attorneys) and the United States (represented by U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) attorneys) must be named as \\"respondents\\" (defendants), and both have authority to appear in court in such cases.See . STB and DOJ attorneys, in most cases, jointly defend the agency's decisions, with the STB's attorneys preparing written briefs (in consultation with DOJ attorneys) and presenting oral arguments on behalf of the Federal Government. In performing defensibility assessments, OGC attorneys meet with other STB staff to discuss cases before draft decisions are prepared. Defensibility assessments are key to issuing sound decisions that are less likely to be challenged and, if challenged, are more likely to be upheld.

Credner and S. Kohle Messier 71 (also known as M71 or NGC 6838) is a globular cluster in the constellation Sagitta. It was discovered by Philippe Loys de Ch√©seaux in 1745 and included by Charles Messier in his catalog of non-comet-like objects in 1780. It was also noted by Koehler at Dresden around 1775. The star cluster is at a distance of about 12,000 light years away from Earth and spans some 27 light years across. The irregular variable star Z Sagittae is a member of this cluster. M71 was long thought (until the 1970s) to be a densely packed open cluster and was classified as such by leading astronomers in the field of star cluster research due to its lacking a dense central compression, and to its stars having more \\"metals\\" than is usual for an ancient globular cluster; furthermore, it lacks the RR Lyrae \\"cluster\\" variable stars that are common in most globulars. However, modern photometric photometry has detected a short \\"horizontal branch\\" in the H-R diagram of M71, which is characteristic of a globular cluster. The shortness of the branch explains the lacking of the RR Lyrae variables and is due to the globular's relatively young age of 9-10 billion years. The relative youth of this globular also explains the abundance of \\"metals\\" in its stars. Hence today M71 is designated as a very loosely concentrated globular cluster, much like M68 in Hydra. M71 has a luminosity of around 13,200 Suns.

Bobov developed into a leading Hasidic dynasty through the leadership of Shlomo Halberstam, a Holocaust survivor who possessed a strong charismatic personality. There are currently two independent Bobov communities, each with their own rebbes and institutions. The first,is led by Benzion Halberstam. The second one, named Bobov-45 , it is led by Mordechai Dovid Unger, younger son-in-law of the fourth Bobover Rebbe, Naftali Zvi Halberstam. . Bobov communities are found in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn; in Monsey, New York; Lakewood, New Jersey; Montreal; Toronto; Antwerp; and London. In Israel, Bobov has large branches in Jerusalem, Bnei Brak, Ashdod, Elad, Beitar Illit, and an enclave, \\"Kiryas Bobov\\", in Bat Yam. Outline of Bobov's Hasidic rabbinical lineage History =First Rebbe, Shlomo Halberstam = Shlomo Halberstam, the first Bobover Rebbe Bobov originated with Rabbi Shlomo Halberstam, who was the grandson of Grand Rabbi Chaim Halberstam of Sanz, in the Galician village of Bobowa. While most of the early yeshivos (Talmudical academies) originated in Lithuania, the 19th century saw the opening of similar institutions in Poland. The first yeshiva in Poland was established by the first Bobover Rebbe in 1881 in Vishnitsa, where he was rabbi then; and it later moved with him to Bobov. =Second rebbe, Benzion Halberstam = His work was continued by his son, Grand Rabbi Ben Zion Halberstam, author of Kedushas Tzion.\\"The Second Bobover Rebbe, Rabbi Ben Zion bar Shlomo Halberstam, was born in 1874 (5634) in the village of Bikofsk, Galicia. His family moved to Bobov and, ... The Bobov Yeshiva was originally situated only in the town of Bobov itself. However, under his guidance, the court grew in numbers, with Hasidic youth flocking to Bobov. Subsequently, as many as sixty branches of the yeshiva under the name Etz Chaim were established throughout Galicia. During World War II, the Bobov Hasidic movement was destroyed. The second Rebbe himself died in the Holocaust (1874 - 1941/3 Menachem Av, HY\\"D), together with family members and thousands of his followers. =Third Rebbe, Shlomo Halberstam= Barely 300 Hasidim survived, and the Rebbe's son, Rabbi Shlomo Halberstam, took it upon himself to rebuild Bobov.\\" .. had been all but wiped out by the Nazi Holocaust. Virtually single-handedly, Rabbi Shlomo Halberstam, who has died aged 92, revived it. He first settled in the West Side of Manhattan, later moving to Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn. The yeshiva was located on the west side of Brooklyn Avenue, at 184 Brooklyn Avenue, between Park Place and Prospect Place; it later moved to nearby Borough Park. Rabbi Shlomo was known as a very wise man and a gaon (exalted) in middos (good attributes). He was noted for his steadfastness in not taking sides in disputes. This brought him great popularity and respect. Over the more than fifty yearspre-WW II thru '00 that Rabbi Shlomo was Rebbe of Bobov, he founded and built a worldwide network of synagogues, Hasidic schools for boys and girls, mesivtas (high schools), and post-high school houses of learning. Besides schools, a summer camp for boys was founded in 1957 in Ferndale, New York, and a girls camp, Camp Gila, was founded a few years later. At the time of his death in August 2000, he was mourned by more followers than his father had in pre-war Poland. His Hebrew date of death was the first of Av, the same as that of Aaron, the Biblical High Priest. Many have noted their similar characteristics of Ohev Shalom VeRodef Shalom (Loved peace and pursued peace).Pirkei Avot 1:12 =Fourth Rebbe, Naftuli Halberstam= With Rabbi Shlomo Halberstam's death, his son, Rabbi Naftali Zvi Halberstam, succeeded him. Rabbi Naftali Zvi died on March 23, 2005 (12th of Adar II, 5765), at age seventy-four, leaving a wife, two daughters, and two sons-in-law: one, Rabbi Yehoshua Rubin, Rav of Bobov-45, and the other, Rabbi Mordechai Dovid Unger, Rebbe of Bobov-45. =Fifth and current Rebbe, Benzion Halberstam= He was born in 1955 to the third Bobover rebbe, Grand Rabbi Shlomo Halberstam and his second wife;[3] Grand Rabbi Shlomo had lost his first wife and most of their children in the Holocaust.[4] His son from his first marriage, Naftali Halberstam, survived and would eventually become the fourth Bobver Rebber. After his father's passing in 2000, Ben Zion Aryeh Leibish older brother, Grand Rabbi Naftali Halberstam was appointed to be the fourth Bobover Rebbe, and Ben Zion Aryeh Leibish was appointed as Rav Hatza'ir (\\"Younger\\" Rabbi).[5] After Grand Rabbi Naftali's passing in 2005, Ben Zion Aryeh Leibish Halberstam was appointed as the fifth Grand Rabbi of Bobov.[6] A group of Hasidim loyal to Naftali's son-in-law, Mordechai Dovid Unger, founded the split-off faction of Bobov-45. Post-war Bobov Instutions in Jerusalem The third Bobover Rebbe, Shlomo Halberstam, rebuilt the Bobov Hasidic dynasty in the United States, after losing his wife and most of his children in the Holocaust; his son, Naftali, survived. After the war, Shlomo Halberstam remarried, and had a son, Ben Zion Aryeh Leibish Halberstam, half-brother to Naftali. London,UK - \\"Chasidey Bobov-45 Beth Hamedrash\\" - \\" (The congregation should not be confused with the Beth Hemedrash of Kehal Chasidei Bobov of Egerton Road N16, which follows the leadership of the brother of the Fourth Bobover Rebbe.) Naftali became the fourth rebbe upon his father's death. He had no sons, but left two daughters, one of whom married Yehoshua Rubin, and the other Mordechai Dovid Unger. =Institutions= Bobov Institutions include numerous communal and educational establishments worldwide, particularly in the United States and Israel. see the Hebrew article :he:◊ó◊°◊ô◊ì◊ï◊™ ◊ë◊ê◊ë◊ï◊ë #◊©◊ú◊ï◊ó◊ï◊™ ◊ï◊û◊ï◊°◊ì◊ï◊™ ◊ë◊ê◊ë◊ï ◊ë◊¢◊ï◊ú◊ù These include several yeshivot and kollels, notable in Monsey, New York and Bat Yam, Israel.

A leadership dispute then arose between Unger and Ben Zion Aryeh Leibish Halberstam, who both claimed the title of Bobover Rebbe. Bobov-45 is also headquartered in Borough Park. It has branches in Williamsburg, Monsey, Lakewood, Montreal, Toronto, London, and Antwerp. In Israel, Bobov has branches in Jerusalem, Bnei Brak, Beit Shemesh, Ashdod, Elad, and Beitar Illit. The dispute was taken to a beth din (arbitration panel), which ruled that the faction following Halberstam held the rights to the name \\"Bobov\\". Unger was also allowed to use the name Bobov, as long as a distinguishing identifier would be added to it. The qualifying suffix was henceforth adopted in tribute to the street on which the community center of the sect was located at the time. In addition, the beth din ordered Bobov to pay $6,200,000 to Bobov-Rebbe and dayan in twenty-five quarterly installments, as an allotment of their faction's share of the inheritance of the Bobov enterprise's assets, which was valued at over $50,000,000 at the time. The award was based upon the number of members in the two communities. As the Rebbe of Bobov- Mordechai Dovid Unger has also been active in the wider Jewish community. Yehoshua Rubin, the older son-in-law of Halberstam, is the current dayan and rabbinical leader of the sect.

It is at a distance of about 32 million light-years away from Earth. The galaxy contains two clearly defined spiral arms and is therefore used as an archetypal example of a grand design spiral galaxy. The galaxy's low surface brightness makes it the most difficult Messier object for amateur astronomers to observe. However, the relatively large angular size of the galaxy and the galaxy's face-on orientation make it an ideal object for professional astronomers who want to study spiral arm structure and spiral density waves. It is estimated that M74 is home to about 100 billion stars. Observation history M74 was discovered by Pierre M√©chain in 1780. M√©chain then communicated his discovery to Charles Messier, who listed the galaxy in his catalog. Supernovae Three supernovae have been identified in M74: SN 2002ap, SN 2003gd, and SN 2013ej. Supernova 2013ej was noted for being as bright as 10th magnitude when viewed from the surface of Earth. SN 2002ap has attracted considerable attention because it is one of the few Type Ic supernovae (or hypernovae) observed within 10 Mpc in recent years. This supernova has been used to test theories on the origins of similar Type Ic supernovae at higher distances and theories on the connection between supernovae and gamma ray bursts. SN 2003gd is a Type II-P supernova. Type II supernovae have known luminosities, so they can be used to accurately measure distances. The distance measured to M74 using SN 2003gd is 9.6 ¬± 2.8 Mpc, or 31 ¬± 9 million ly. For comparison, distances measured using the brightest supergiants are 7.7 ¬± 1.7 Mpc and 9.6 ¬± 2.2 Mpc. Ben E. K. Sugerman found a \\"light echo\\" ‚Äì a reflection of supernova explosion that appeared after the explosion itself ‚Äì associated with SN 2003gd. This is one of the few supernovae in which such a reflection has been found. This reflection appears to be from dust in a sheet-like cloud that lies in front of the supernova, and it can be used to determine the composition of the interstellar dust. Galaxy group M74 is the brightest member of the M74 Group, a group of 5‚Äì7 galaxies that also includes the peculiar spiral galaxy NGC 660 and a few irregular galaxies. Although different group identification methods may consistently identify many of the same member galaxies in this group, the exact group membership is still uncertain. Star formation M74 as observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope as part of the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxy Survey. The blue colors represent the 3.6 micrometre emission from stars. The green and red colors represent the 5.8 and 8.0 micrometre emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and possibly dust. Gallery M74 imaged by W4SM with 17\\" PlaneWave CDK telescope, Louisa, VA. Suspected black hole On March 22, 2005, it was announcedChandra :: Photo Album :: M74 :: 22 Mar 05 that the Chandra X-ray Observatory had observed an ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) in M74, radiating more X-ray power than a neutron star in periodic intervals of around two hours. It has an estimated mass of around 10,000 Suns. This is an indicator of an intermediate-mass black hole. This would be a rather uncommon class of black holes, somewhere in between in size of stellar black holes and the massive black holes theorized to reside in the center of many galaxies. Because of this, they are believed to form not from single supernovae, but possibly from a number of lesser stellar black holes in a star cluster. The X-ray source is identified as CXOU J013651.1+154547. Amateur astronomy observation Messier 74 is located 1.5¬∞ east-northeast of Eta Piscium. This galaxy has the second lowest surface brightness of all the Messier objects. (M101 has the lowest.) It may be very difficult to see unless the sky is dark and clear, and it may be difficult to see in locations affected by light pollution. This galaxy may be best viewed under low magnification; when highly magnified, the diffuse emission becomes more extended and appears too faint to be seen by many people. Additionally, M74 may be more easily seen when using averted vision when the eyes are fully dark adapted.

St Bavo's Cathedral, Ghent. Christ the King is a title of Jesus in Christianity referring to the idea of the Kingdom of God where the Christ is described as seated at the Right Hand of GodPhilip Edgecumbe Hughes, A Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews, p. 401, 1988: \\"The theme of Christ's heavenly session, announced here by the statement he sat down at the right hand of God, .. Hebrews 8:1 \\"we have such a high priest, one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven\\")\\" (as opposed to the secular title of King of the Jews mockingly given at the crucifixion). Many Christian denominations consider the kingly office of Christ to be one of the threefold offices: Christ is a prophet, priest, and king.The Cyclopedia of Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Literature. James Strong and John McClintock; Harper and Brothers; NY; 1880 The title \\"Christ the King\\" is also frequently used as a name for churches, schools, seminaries, hospitals, and religious institutes. Biblical basis The titles of \\"Christ\\" and \\"king\\" are not used together in the gospel, but \\"Christ\\" is in itself a royal title (i.e. \\"the anointed [king]\\"). In the Greek text, the Christ is explicitly identified as king (Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒµœçœÇ) several times, so in Matthew 2:2 (\\"Where is the newborn king of the Jews?\\"). In John 18, Pilate refers to the implication that the Christ is a royal title by inquiring explicitly if Jesus claims to be the \\"king of the Jews\\" (Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒµ·Ω∫œÇ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ ·º∏ŒøœÖŒ¥Œ±ŒØœâŒΩ). Similarly, in John 1:49, a follower addresses Jesus as \\"the king of Israel\\" (·ΩÅ Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒµ·Ω∫œÇ œÑŒø·ø¶ ·º∏œÉœÅŒ±ŒÆŒª). In the Gospel of Luke, the angel Gabriel proclaims to Mary, \\"Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name him Jesus. He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father, and he will rule over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.\\"Hodge, Archibald Alexander, \\"The Kingly Office of Christ\\", Popular Lectures of Theological Themes, Presbyterian Board of Publication and Sabbath-School Work, 1887, p. 260 Outside of the gospels, the First Epistle to Timothy (6:14-15) explicitly applies the phrase of \\"king of kings and lord of lords\\" (ŒíŒ±œÉŒπŒªŒµ·Ω∫œÇ Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒ≠œâŒΩ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ Œ∫œçœÅŒπŒøœÇ Œ∫œÖœÅŒØœâŒΩ), adapting the Pentateuch's declaration, for the Lord your God is the God of gods and the Lord of lords, to Jesus Christ. In the Book of Revelation it is declared that the Lamb is \\"King of kings, and Lord of lords\\". Background The concept of Christ as king was the subject of an address given by Eusebius about AD 314. Depictions of the imperial Christ arise in the later part of the fourth century.Beskow, Per.

Writing in the aftermath of World War I, Pius noted that while there had been a cessation of hostilities, there was no true peace. He deplored the rise of class divisions and unbridled nationalism, and held that true peace can only be found under the Kingship of Christ as \\"Prince of Peace\\". \\"For Jesus Christ reigns over the minds of individuals by His teachings, in their hearts by His love, in each one's life by the living according to His law and the imitating of His example.\\"Pope Pius XI. \\"Ubi Arcano Dei Consilio\\", 23 December 1922 =Quas primas= Christ's kingship was addressed again in the encyclical Quas primas of Pope Pius XI, published in 1925.

The General Roman Calendar of 1969 moved its observance in the Roman Rite to the last Sunday of Ordinary Time, the final Sunday of the liturgical year. Most Anglicans and some Protestants celebrate it on the same day. However, Catholics who observe the pre-Vatican II General Roman Calendar of 1960, and members of the Anglican Catholic Church celebrate it instead on the last Sunday of October, the Sunday before All Saints' Day, the day assigned in 1925.

They were named after Peter Stuyvesant, the last director-general of the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam, whose farm occupied the site in the 17th century. The buildings north of 20th Street are called Peter Cooper Village, named after the 19th- century industrialist, inventor and philanthropist Peter Cooper, who founded Cooper Union.

History East 20th Street looking east in the direction of First Avenue in 1938. This picture shows two of the huge gas holders that gave the area the name Gas House District; the block in the foreground did not become part of the Stuyvesant Town‚ÄìPeter Cooper Village complex, but the area on the east side of First Avenue, where the tanks are, did. (Photo by Berenice Abbott) =Gas House District= In 1842, one gas storage tank at East 23rd Street and the river was erected, quickly followed by the construction of other gas tanks, and by the late 19th century, the site of the complex had become known as the \\"Gashouse District\\" because of the many gas storage tanks owned by Consolidated Gas Company that dominated the streetscapes. The tanks, which sometimes leaked, made the area undesirable to live in, as did the Gas House Gang and other predators who operated in the area. The population was predominantly poor, at first largely Irish, but then Germans and Jews as well; later, Slovaks and other Eastern Europeans were the dominant ethnic groups, including a large population of Armenians who lived in the upper Twenties between First and Lexington avenues., p.190 Crime in the district was endemic. When Alexander S. Williams was promoted to police captain on May 31, 1872, and assigned to the area, he met the gangs' violence with equal force of his own, putting together a brute squad that beat up gangsters with clubs. He commented: \\"There is more law at the end of a policeman's nightstick than in a decision of the Supreme Court.\\", p.999 With the construction of the FDR Drive, the area began to improve. By the 1930s, all but four tanks were gone, and, while shabby, the area was no more blighted than many parts of the city after the years of the Great Depression. Before the construction of Stuyvesant Town, the neighborhood contained 18 city blocks, with public schools, churches, factories, private homes, apartments, small businesses and even relatively new modern-style apartment buildings. In all, 600 buildings, containing 3,100 families, 500 stores and small factories, three churches, three schools, and two theaters, were razed. As would be repeated in later urban renewal projects, some 11,000 persons were forced to move from the neighborhood. In 1945, The New York Times called the move from the site \\"the greatest and most significant mass movement of families in New York's history.\\" The last residents of the Gas House district, the Delman family, moved out in May 1946, allowing demolition to be completed shortly thereafter. =Planning= Due to a New York City housing shortage that had been growing since the Depression, Stuyvesant Town was already being planned as a post-war housing project in 1942‚Äì43, some years before the end of World War II. A provision was made that the rental applications of veterans would have selection priority. The complex was developed by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, and was based on its earlier development in the Parkchester neighborhood of the Bronx, which was completed in 1942. The same companies and developers also built Riverton, which was completed around the same time. Metropolitan Life president Frederick H. Ecker said of Stuyvesant Town in its initial offering that it would make it possible for generations of New Yorkers \\"to live in a park ‚Äì to live in the country in the heart of New York.\\" On the first day the company received 7,000 applications; it would receive 100,000 applicants by the time of first occupancy. The complex's first tenants, two World War II veterans and their families, moved into the first completed building on August 1, 1947. In 1947, rents ranged from $50 to $91 per month. Current rents range from $3,300 for a one bedroom apartment to $9,000 for a 5 bedroom unit. Stuyvesant Town (bottom and left) and Peter Cooper Village (top and right) as seen from the air over the East River looking northwest (2012) Controversy Stuyvesant Town was controversial from the beginning. In 1943, the National Association of Housing Officials described the fight as \\"a battle up to now lacking only in beer bottles and murder.\\" Although nominally a private development, it was championed by Parks Commissioner Robert Moses, who has been called the \\"dominant force in [the] creation\\" of both Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village. At the behest of Mayor LaGuardia, Moses sought \\"to induce insurance companies and savings banks to enter the field of large-scale slum clearance.\\" It was enabled by various state laws and amendments which permitted private companies to enter what was previously a public field of action.\\"[For] projects such as Stuyvesant Town, Peter Cooper Village, Riverton and Concord Village ... though the money that built them was supposedly private money, the tax abatement that Moses arranged for them would, when totaled over the years, insure that the public investment in them would dwarf the private, and the powers that Moses used to make possible not only their construction but the assemblage of their sites ‚Äì eminent domain, street closings, utility easements ‚Äì were all public.\\" () Stuyvesant Town's central green, the Oval The fountain in the Oval The new public-private partnership, and the contract entered between the city and the developer, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, were the source of much debate. Among the issues at stake were use of the power of eminent domain for private purposes; the reversion of public streets and land, such as public school property, to private ownership; the 25-year tax exemption granted by the contract; and the lack of any restrictions on the company prohibiting discrimination in selecting tenants.Staff. \\"STUYVESANT TOWN APPROVED BY BOARD; Form of Contract and Plans for Housing Project Pass Estimate Body, 11-5 OPPONENTS CHARGE BIAS Nathan and Morris Oppose the Proposition on Ground That Negroes Would Be Barred STUYVESANT TOWN APPROVED BY BOARD\\", The New York Times, June 4, 1943. Accessed December 18, 2016. \\"\\"The chief objection voiced by more than a score of speakers was that the contract contained no clause that would prevent the Metropolitan company from discriminating against Negroes in renting. Those holding this view contended that since Metropolitan had been granted the right of eminent domain as well as a 25-year tax exemption on the improved property, the project was public in nature and should be protected from discrimination.\\" When the $50 million Stuyvesant Town plan was approved by the City Planning Commission on May 20, 1943 by a five to one vote, discrimination against African-Americans was already a significant topic of debate. Councilmen Stanley M. Isaacs and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. sought to introduce a provision into the contract that would prevent racial or religious discrimination in tenant selection. This provision was not accepted; those who rejected it, including Robert Moses, argued that the company's profitability would be harmed, and that opponents were \\"obviously looking for a political issue and not for results in the form of actual slum clearance.\\" In the years after it opened, black people were barred from living in the complex, with Metropolitan Life's president, Frederick H. Ecker, stating that \\"negroes and whites do not mix\\". Lee Lorch, a City College of New York professor, petitioned to allow African Americans into the development, and was fired from his teaching position as a result of pressure from Metropolitan Life. Upon accepting a position at Pennsylvania State University, Lorch allowed a black family to occupy his apartment, thus circumventing the 'no Negroes' rule.According to Lorch, he did not sublet the apartment, which would have violated his own lease. He allowed a friend who was black to move in with his family without paying rent. As a result of pressure from Metropolitan Life, he was dismissed from his new position as well. Lawsuits were filed on the basis that the project was public or semi-public, and thus violated anti-discrimination laws for New York City public housing. In July 1947, the New York Supreme Court determined that the development was private and that, in the absence of laws to the contrary, the company could discriminate as it saw fit. The court wrote, \\"It is well settled that the landlord of a private apartment or dwelling house may, without violating any provision of the Federal or State Constitutions, select tenants of its own choice because of race, color, creed or religion... Clearly, housing accommodation is not a recognized civil right.\\" The suit brought by three African American war veterans was thus settled. By this date, Metropolitan Life was building the Riverton Houses, a separate-but-equal housing project in Harlem with residents who were mainly black. Some years later, the company admitted a few black families to Stuyvesant Town and a few white families to Riverton. Both projects, however, remain largely segregated.Martin, Douglas. \\"COMMUNITY; Stuy Town: Urban Dream at Midlife\\", The New York Times, March 8, 2000. Accessed December 18, 2016. \\"MINORITY acceptances continued to be negligible, sparking lawsuits well into the 60's. Part of MetLife's response was to build a similar project in Harlem where most tenants would be black. Called Riverton, its 1,232 units made it considerably smaller than Stuyvesant Town's 8,756. But the apartments were carbon copies, the grounds were similar and the two complexes shared recreation staffs.\\" A host of other issues and controversies surrounded Stuyvesant Town's planning and design. From the outset, objections were made to the haste with which the project was approved and lack of public participation in the process; the project's population density; the absence of any public facilities such as schools, community centers, or shops in the development; the gated-community, private property character of the complex, and the denial of city residents of the right to walk through a part of the city that was once public; and violations of the city's master plan. Lawsuits were brought by property owners of the land, but in February 1944 the Supreme Court of the United States refused to review the constitutionality of the New York State law that enabled the development, despite the taking of public property for private profit, the granting of tax exemptions, and the public benefits advanced by the developers and their advocates. The complex contained original plaques honoring Frederick H. Ecker and marking the complexes as housing for moderate-income families, which were dedicated during the complexes' opening day in 1947. In 2002, when the property went luxury market rate, the plaques were removed.Putzier, Konrad. \\"How Stuy Town was won; A tale of the wheeling and dealing behind Blackstone and Ivanhoe's $5.3B buy\\", The Real Deal (magazine), October 29, 2015.

The inscription became a mantra for the 11,200-apartment complex, which, even as Manhattan became increasingly unaffordable, remained a rent-stabilized oasis for the middle class.But in 2002, the plaque was quietly removed.\\"Bagli, Charles V.

The sale was expected to close by November 15, 2006, according to documents which CB Richard Ellis, a commercial real estate broker representing MetLife, sent to bidders. MetLife hired a broker, who started registering bidders, and intended to name a winner by November 2006. The sale had drawn interest from dozens of prospective buyers, including New York's top real estate families, pension funds, international investment banks and investors from Dubai, according to The New York Times, citing real estate executives.MetLife's Stuyvesant, Cooper Village Sale Could Hit $5B , Commercial Property News, August 30, 2006 New York City Council member Daniel Garodnick, a lifelong resident of Peter Cooper Village, attempted to organize tenants and investors to place a buyout bid on the complex. Initially, MetLife deemed the tenants group an unqualified bidder, but, after being pressured by elected officials, the company reversed itself, and distributed bid books to the tenant group; bids were to have been submitted by October 5, 2006. Bids included the tenants' $4.6 billion offer, a bid by Vornado Realty Trust, a joint offer between Lehman Brothers and The Related Companies, and one by Apollo Global Management which came within $100 million of Speyer's $5.4 billion. Tishman Speyer paid just $56 million in cash for the property while raising $4 billion in debt from Wachovia and another $500 million from Merrill Lynch & Co.. On January 22, 2007, a class action lawsuit was filed against MetLife, Tishman Speyer Properties, and their associates on behalf of the market rate tenants of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village. The suit claimed that MetLife was improperly charging tenants \\"market rate\\" rents while at the same time receiving real estate tax benefits from the City of New York under the J-51 program, which requires property owners to maintain apartments as rent-stabilized during the period in which they are receiving benefits. The lawsuit asked for a monetary award of between $215 million and $320 million in rent overcharges and damages. Furthermore, it called for the market rate apartments to revert to rent stabilization until the expiration of the J-51 benefit period, sometime after 2017.Bagli, Charles V. \\"Suit Challenges Rent Jumps in Complexes MetLife Sold\\", The New York Times, January 23, 2007. Accessed December 18, 2016. 2010 default In January 2010, Tishman Speyer Properties defaulted on the mortgage, the largest commercial mortgage default in U.S. history. On January 24, 2010, Tishman Speyer Properties gave up control of the properties by handing the complex to creditors, thereby avoiding a bankruptcy of the site. The default was predicted many months in advance; Fitch ratings downgraded the associated CMBS in August 2009. As of January 2010, the complex was estimated to be worth around $1.9 billion or less than 40 percent of the $5.4 billion the property was purchased for in 2006. While the legal battle over rent stabilization played a small role in the demise, it is likely Tishman Speyer would have defaulted even had it won the case. The assumptions underlying the $5.4 billion 2006 valuation were extremely aggressive; the valuation assumed that the income from the properties would triple by 2011. The landmark sale and default are the subject of the 2013 book Other People's Money: Inside the Housing Crisis and the Demise of the Greatest Real Estate Deal Ever Made by New York Times real estate reporter Charles V.

Blackstone had recently raised a $15.8 billion fund, the largest real-estate fund ever. New York City was expected to contribute $225 million to help preserve a portion of the complex as affordable to low- and middle-income residents. Under a binding agreement with the city, Blackstone agreed to keep roughly 5,000 units below market rents until at least 2035.

He was first elected to council in 1982 after first serving as a school trustee since 1980. He remained a city councillor until 2000. Background Jakobek holds degrees from the University of Toronto. Certificate in Public Administration (CPA), 1981. Honours Bachelor of Arts, B.A., 1982. Masters of Health Science, MHSC, 2002. Jakobek is the son-in-law of former veteran Scarborough councillor Ken Morrish. Politics Jakobek was first elected as a Toronto District School Board trustee in 1980 at 21 years of age, the youngest school board trustee in the history of Ontario. Jakobek was first elected as a municipal politician at the age of 23 in the 1982 Toronto election as a Metro Toronto councillor for Ward 9 the Beaches and was the youngest councillor in the history of Metropolitan Toronto. He was for many years a bulwark of the council's right-wing. He became city of Toronto budget chief in 1990, and held the position for the next ten years despite an attempt by Barbara Hall and others to oust him in 1994. In this capacity, he delivered nine consecutive budgets with no tax increases. Following the city's amalgamation in 1997, Jakobek emerged as a prominent ally of new mayor Mel Lastman. In 2000, he retired from politics in disgrace after an investigation found \\"he lied, prevaricated, stalled, obfuscated and lied some more, all of which was a strategy to obstruct any investigation of his dealings with MFP\\". He later served briefly as a vice-president at Toronto East General Hospital. =Mayoral race, 2003= He ran for Mayor of Toronto in 2003 following Lastman's retirement, coming in a distant fifth. Jakobek garnered barely 5,000 votes across the entire city, less than one per cent of the total votes cast.

Immediately below it in importance, there is a group of Twelve Great Feasts (Greek: ŒîœâŒ¥ŒµŒ∫Œ¨ŒøœÅœÑŒøŒΩ). Together with Pascha, these are the most significant dates on the Orthodox liturgical calendar. Eight of the great feasts are in honor of Jesus Christ, while the other four are dedicated to the Virgin Mary ‚Äî the Theotokos.Mother Mary and Ware, Kallistos, \\"The Festal Menaion\\", p. 41. St. Tikhon's Seminary Press, 1998. The Twelve Great Feasts are as follows (note that the liturgical year begins with the month of September): #The Nativity of the Theotokos, #The Exaltation of the Cross, #The Presentation of the Theotokos, #The Nativity of Christ (Christmas), #The Baptism of Christ (Theophany, also called Epiphany), #The Presentation of Jesus at the Temple (Candlemas), #The Annunciation, #The Entry into Jerusalem (Flowery/Willow/Palm Sunday), the Sunday before Easter #The Ascension of Christ, forty Days after Easter #Pentecost, fifty Days after Easter #The Transfiguration of Jesus, #The Dormition of the Theotokos, Besides the Twelve Great Feasts, the Orthodox Church knows five other feasts that rank as great feasts, yet without being numbered among the twelve. They are: the Circumcision of Christ (), the Nativity of St. John the Baptist (), the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul (), the Beheading of St John the Baptist (), and the Intercession of the Theotokos ().Moscow Typikon, 1904, reprinted Graz, Austria, 1964 Explanations = Nativity of the Theotokos = Mary was born to elderly and previously barren parents by the names of Joachim and Anna (now saints), in answer to their prayers. Orthodox Christians do not hold to the Roman Catholic doctrine of the Immaculate Conception of Mary, in which it is taught that Mary was preserved from the ancestral sin that befalls us all as descendants of Adam and Eve, in anticipation of her giving birth to the sinless Christ. The Orthodox believe that Mary, and indeed all mankind, was born only to suffer the consequences of the ancestral sin (being born into a corrupt world surrounded by temptations to sin), the chief of which was the enslavement to Death, and thus needed salvation from this enslavement, like all mankind. The Roman Catholic Doctrine of the Immaculate Conception also recognizes that Mary was in need of salvation, viewing her as prevented from falling into the scar of sin, instead of being pulled up out of it. Orthodox thought does vary on whether Mary actually ever sinned, though there is general agreement that she was cleansed from sin at the Annunciation.Ware, p. 47 = Exaltation of the Holy Cross = The Exaltation of the Holy Cross (also called the Elevation of the Cross) commemorates the recovery of the cross on which Jesus Christ was crucified. The Persians had captured it as a prize of war in Jerusalem in the year 614, and it was recovered by the forces of the Eastern Roman Empire (\\"Byzantine Empire\\") in 629. The cross was joyously held up for veneration by the Christian faithful upon its recovery.Ware, p. 50 = Presentation of the Theotokos = According to Tradition, Mary was taken  presented‚Äîto the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem as a young girl, where she lived and served until her betrothal to Joseph.Ware, p. 51M.R. James, \\"The Apocryphal New Testament, Oxford, 1924. Cited by Ware, p. 47 = Nativity of the Lord = December 25  Christmas. The nativity account (Gospel of Luke ) begins with Mary and Joseph (Mary's betrothed) traveling to Bethlehem to be enrolled in the Roman census ordered by Augustus Caesar. On the way, they look for a place for Mary to give birth to her child, but all the inns are full and the only suitable place is a cave (show as a stable in most Western descriptions) where animals are kept. The Theotokos (God-bearer, the Virgin Mary) gives birth ineffably (without pain or travail) and remains virgin after childbirth.Ware, p. 52 = Theophany (Baptism of the Lord) = This observance commemorates Christ's baptism by John the Baptist in the River Jordan, and the beginning of Christ's earthly ministry (Gospel of Matthew , Gospel of Mark ). It is known by the Orthodox as both Epiphany (i.e., manifestation) and Theophany (manifestation of God). These are bundled, along with Christmas, differently in some eastern Christian traditions.Ware, p. 55 = Presentation of the Lord = In the Gospel of Luke , Mary and Joseph took the baby Jesus to the Temple in Jerusalem. He was received in the arms of the elder Simeon, who then prayed, \\"Now let Thy servant depart (die) in peace,...for I have seen Thy salvation.\\" This was one of the things that Mary \\"pondered in her heart\\"‚Äîthe fact that others recognized that her Son was the Messiah. This feast is also known as the Meeting of the Lord, or Hypapante.Ware, p. 60 = Annunciation = According to the Gospel of Luke , the angel Gabriel appeared to Mary to announce to her that she would conceive and bear a son, even though she \\"knew no man.\\" This date is selected to be exactly nine months ahead of Christmas, indicating that Christ was conceived at that time \\"by the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary\\", as stated in the Nicene Creed.Ware, p. 60 = Entry into Jerusalem (Palm Sunday) = A mere few days before His brutal crucifixion, Jesus was received by adoring throngs at his entry into Jerusalem on the back of young donkey (Gospel of Matthew ). The crowds threw palm branches in his path in jubilation, and even the children shouted praises to Him. The Orthodox celebrate this day with joy, but with the realization that very sad events are soon to come. Among the Russian Orthodox, willow branches are substituted in the celebration of this event, owing to the lack of availability of palm trees in Slavic climes. = Ascension = Forty days after the Resurrection, while blessing His disciples (Gospel of Luke ), Christ ascended into heaven (Gospel of Mark ), taking His place at the right hand of the Father (Nicene Creed). While the disciples were still looking into the air for Jesus, an angel appeared and told them that the Lord would return again in the same manner as they had seen him go into heaven (Acts of the Apostles ). = Pentecost = Fifty days after the Resurrection, on the existing Jewish feast of Shavuot, while the disciples and many other followers of Jesus were gathered together to pray, the Holy Spirit descended upon them in the form of \\"cloven tongues of fire\\", with the sound of a rushing mighty wind, and they began to speak in languages that they did not know. There were many visitors from the Jewish diaspora to Jerusalem at that time for the Jewish observance of the feast, and they were astonished to hear these untaught fishermen speaking praises to God in their alien tongues (Acts of the Apostles ). = Transfiguration = Jesus had gone with his disciples (later called apostles) Peter, James, and John (also called John the Evangelist) to Mount Tabor. Christ's appearance was changed while they watched into a glorious radiant figure. There appeared Elijah and Moses, speaking with Jesus. The disciples were amazed and terribly afraid. This event shows forth the divinity of Christ, so that the disciples would understand after his Ascension that He was truly the radiant splendor of the Father, and that his Passion was voluntary. Gospel of Mark Ware, p. 61 = Dormition of the Theotokos = The Orthodox feast of the Dormition is analogous to what Roman Catholicism calls the Assumption of Mary. According to Orthodox Tradition, Mary died like all humanity, \\"falling asleep\\", so to speak, as the name of the feast indicates. (Catholic theologians are divided on the issue of whether Mary died. Today most would favor an actual death before the Assumption.) The Apostles were miraculously summoned to this event, and all were present except Thomas when Mary passed from this life. She was buried. Thomas arrived three days later, and desiring to see her one more time, convinced the other apostles to open her tomb. To their surprise, her body was not there. This event is seen as a first symbol of the resurrection of the faithful that will occur at the Second Coming of Christ. The event is normally called the \\"Dormition\\", though there are many Orthodox Churches with the name \\"Assumption\\". In Greek, \\"Dormition\\" is \\"Kimisis\\" (Coemesis)  falling asleep in death‚Äîfrom which the word \\"cemetery\\" derives.Ware, p. 63  See also  * Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar * Paschal Cycle  References  * Icons of the Church Year, Orthodox Church in America.

Born in Argentina, he emigrated in 1960 to the United States, where he lived for the remainder of his life. He is best known for his series of compositions called Synchronisms, which in live performance incorporate both acoustic instruments and electroacoustic sounds played from a tape. Biography Davidovsky was born in M√©danos, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, a town nearly 600 km southwest of the city of Buenos Aires and close to the seaport of Bah√≠a Blanca. At seven he began his musical studies on the violin. At thirteen he began composing. He studied composition and theory under Guillermo Graetzer at the University of Buenos Aires, from which he graduated. In 1958, he studied with Aaron Copland and Milton Babbitt at the Berkshire Music Center (now the Tanglewood Music Center) in Lenox, Massachusetts. Through Babbitt, who worked at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center, and others, Davidovsky developed an interest in electroacoustic music. Copland encouraged Davidovsky to emigrate to the United States, and in 1960, Davidovsky settled in New York City, where he was appointed associate director of the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center. Most of his published compositions since the 1970s have been nonelectronic. His only published electroacoustic compositions since that time are Synchronisms No. 9 (1988) and Synchronisms No. 10 (1992). However, Davidovsky received a commission by a group led by SEAMUS to compose two more electroacoustic works in the Synchronisms series. No. 11 and No. 12 premiered in 2007 at the SEAMUS National Conference in Ames, IA. Davidovsky's association with the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center continued, and from 1981 to 1993 he was the lab's director as well as professor of music at Columbia. In 1994 he became professor of music at Harvard. During his career, Davidovsky has also taught at many other institutions: University of Michigan (1964), the Di Tella Institute of Buenos Aires (1965), the Manhattan School of Music (1968‚Äì69), Yale University (1969‚Äì70), and the City College of New York (1968‚Äì80). He served on the composition faculty of Mannes College The New School for Music. In 1982, Davidovsky was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.List of academicians at the American Academy of Arts and Letters . \\"Mario Davidovsky - Music - 1982\\"  Personal life  Davidovsky married Ellen Blaustein in 1961.\\"Bio: Mario Davidovsky\\", NNDB They had two children, and three grandchildren.

It uses tape delay to create a delayed copy of an audio signal which is then combined with the original. The effect is intended to simulate the sound of the natural doubling of voices or instruments achieved by double tracking. The technique was originally developed in 1966 by engineers at Abbey Road Studios in LondonMartin, George, All You Need Is Ears, St. Martin's Press, 1979, p. 155, . at the request of The Beatles. Overview As early as the 1950s, it was discovered that double tracking the lead vocal in a song gave it a richer, more appealing sound, especially for singers with weak or light voices. Use of this technique became possible with the advent of magnetic tape for use in sound recording. Originally, a pair of single-track (or \\"mono\\") tape recorders were used to produce the effect; later, multitrack tape machines were used. Early pioneers of this technique were Les Paul and Buddy Holly. Before the development of ADT, it was necessary to either record the vocal track twice on two different tracks of a multitrack tape, or to record the vocal first on one tape, then again on a second tape while simultaneously copying the first to the second‚Äîa process that could be both tedious and exacting, and might require several takes. After the development of ADT, this process became known as \\"manual double tracking\\". Ken Townsend ADT was invented specially for the BeatlesMartin pg.155 during the spring of 1966 by Ken Townsend, a recording engineer employed at EMI's Abbey Road Studios, mainly at the request of John Lennon, who despised the tedium of double tracking during sessions and regularly expressed a desire for a technical alternative.Lewisohn, Mark, The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions, Hamlyn (division of Octopus Publishing Group) for EMI, 1988, p. 70, . The double tracking effect Because it is nearly impossible for a performer to sing or play the same part in exactly the same way twice, a recording and blending of two different performances of the same part will create a fuller, \\"chorused\\" effect with double tracking. But if one simply plays back two copies of the same performance in perfect sync, the two sound images become one and no double tracking effect is produced. Townsend realised that, if two identical performances were played back with one of them slightly out of sync, the sound image would alter and widen, similarly to double tracking. There was no reliable way that this effect could be achieved by simply copying a vocal track on to another deck and then playing it back with the master slightly out of sync; at the time, there was no technique for synchronizing two different tape machines. The end result would be that, sometimes, the second tape deck would gradually drift further and further from the first. Tape delay system Instead, Townsend came up with a system using tape delay, after similar principles already in place for echoes applied via tape during a song mixdown. In essence, Townsend's system added a second tape recorder to the regular setup. When mixing a song, its vocal track was routed from the recording head of the multitrack tape, which was before the playback head, and fed to the record head of the second tape recorder. An oscillator was used to vary the speed of the second machine, providing more or less delay depending on how fast or slow the second machine was run relative to the first. This signal was then routed from the playback head of the second machine to a separate fader on the mixer. This allowed the delayed vocal to be combined with the normal vocal, creating the double-tracked effect. Use by The Beatles The Beatles were ecstatic by Townsend's technique and used it throughout the Revolver album, and on many of their subsequent recordings. It has been incorrectly claimed that the first use of ADT was on the first half of Lennon's vocal track on \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", but in actuality, this vocal track features manual double tracking. Otherwise, most of the double- tracked vocals heard on the rest of the album were created using ADT, while the group also used the technique on a number of the instrumental parts to colour the sounds ‚Äì there is factually more use of ADT on the mono version of the album than on the more widely known stereo version, with the lead guitar on \\"Taxman\\" and the backwards guitar on \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" treated with the effect. ADT could not only be used to create a single double-tracked sound image; but when used on a stereo mix, the effect could be used to \\"split\\" the vocal between the two stereo channels, creating the impression of two different vocal parts on either side of the stereo picture. This technique was used on the stereo mixes of \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\", \\"Love You To\\", \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\", and \\"Doctor Robert\\" (on \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\", the similar effect heard is actually two different vocals manually double-tracked and panned; on \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", the effect is obtained by a combination of manual double-tracking and ADT). This technique could also be applied to instrumental parts as well: on \\"Love You To\\", the same use of ADT was applied to the acoustic guitar track, giving the impression of multiple guitars panned left and right. Flanging Lennon dubbed the technique \\"flanging\\" after producer George Martin jokingly told him it was produced using a \\"double-bifurcated sploshing flange\\".Martin, George; Pearson, William; Summer of Love: The Making of Sgt. Pepper, London, Pan Books, 1994, p. 82. . Only years later did Martin learn that another technique, also called flanging, was already in use. The term referred to an engineer alternately pressing and releasing his finger against the flange (rim) of the supply reel on one of two synchronized tape machines as the same audio signal was combined and transferred to a third machine, slightly slowing the machine then allowing it to come back up to speed and in sync with the other, applying a \\"swooshing\\" comb filtering effect to the combined audio signal. Alternatively, the engineer could press the flange of one supply reel then the other to achieve a fuller effect. An additional explanation for the pedigree of flanging has it named after Fred Flange, a pseudonym given to Matt Monro by Peter Sellers, who used a Monro recording to open his 1959 Sinatra parody album Songs for Swingin' Sellers. The album was produced by Martin, and presumably the connection with flanging comes from Monro's mimicking (double-tracking) Sinatra.Gould, Jonathan, Can't Buy Me Love: The Beatles, Britain, and America, Harmony Books, 2007, p. 329, . Engineers at Abbey Road realised that the technique they had developed needed a proper technical name and eventually christened it ADT, short for \\"Artificial Double Tracking\\", although elsewhere the term \\"Automatic Double Tracking\\" became more common. ADT versus manual double tracking Townsend's process succeeded in simulating manual double tracking quite effectively; however, attentive listeners can often tell the difference between ADT and \\"real\\" double tracking, with the former having a synthetic quality to it and having none of the audible differences between the vocal tracks frequently present in the latter. Over the years, many artists, including the Beatles, continued to use both manual double tracking, ADT, or a combination of both in different circumstances depending on the effects they wished to achieve, with each technique thought to have certain unique qualities of its own. The Beatles used ADT widely in conjunction with manual double-tracking on all their subsequent albums, with the exception of Let It Be, which was initially intended to be an \\"honest\\" album utilising no technical artifice (ADT can still be heard on the finished album, however, because Phil Spector treated a Hammond organ part with it on his mix of the title track). Some notable examples of ADT used by the Beatles in the years following Revolver include \\"Within You Without You\\" (on which ADT was purportedly used on almost every vocal and instrumental part on the track), \\"I Am the Walrus\\" (which uses ADT in conjunction with equalisation to help simulate a \\"fake stereo\\" effect on the second half of the stereo mix, which was sourced from the mono mix, by splitting the entire mix between the channels), and the unusually wide ADT used on the lead vocal tracks on \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\\" and \\"Blue Jay Way\\". On \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", Eric Clapton used ADT to make his guitar sound 'less bluesy', according to Ian MacDonald in Revolution in the Head. Other users of ADT Townsend's technique, and minor variations on it, quickly caught on with other artists and record producers. Former Beatles engineer Norman Smith used ADT extensively on Pink Floyd's debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, recorded at Abbey Road in 1967. As well as using it for more conventional simulated double tracking, Smith made much use of the technique to split Syd Barrett's vocals between the stereo channels. In some cases, Smith (or possibly Barrett himself) used such extraordinarily wide ADT in this way as to give the slightly disorientating impression of not so much double tracking but two quite separate voices on either channel wildly out of time with each other ‚Äì the best example of this is perhaps on \\"Bike\\". Similar effects were later used on some of Barrett's solo works, perhaps indicating his fondness for this unusual use of ADT. Pink Floyd themselves continued to use ADT on most, if not all, of their subsequent albums up until the 1980s, with one notable use being on \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\", where a part of the drum track is treated with ADT. In the US, Simon and Garfunkel began to use ADT on stereo mixes of their songs to split vocal tracks between the channels, examples of which include \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" and \\"Cecilia\\". Gary Kellgren, Jimi Hendrix's engineer, used ADT extensively on all of Hendrix's albums. He frequently split vocal, guitar, and even drum parts between the stereo channels. As the music industry's hunger for technological advances increased, new devices were created to make it easier and faster to achieve the same results. Thus, the industry saw analog delay devices created and brought to market that no longer needed tape machines to achieve the ADT effect. They used electronic circuits instead. Much later on, these analong delays were augmented by digital delay units. Nowadays, the ADT effect, as well as a whole host of others, many never even dreamed of in the 60's, 70's and 80's, let alone possible, are available to everyday musicians, engineers and producers, as computer software plugins. Psychedelic music With the rise of psychedelic music, many artists used variations on Townsend's technique to create the \\"flanging\\" effect mentioned above, adding a slightly disorienting \\"swooshing\\" quality to instruments and voices (although in practice this effect is actually more similar to what today is called \\"phasing\\" rather than \\"flanging\\"). The Beatles themselves used this effect on \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" and more prominently on \\"Blue Jay Way\\". A notable example of this technique is \\"Itchycoo Park\\" by the Small Faces, where the effect is prominent almost throughout the entire track, particularly on the vocals, drums and cymbals during the chorus. Hendrix also used this technique extensively. An example of an ADT variation being used to create an effect more similar to what is considered \\"flanging\\" today (rather than phasing) is on the Beatles' White Album tracks \\"Cry Baby Cry\\" (acoustic guitar) and \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" (lead guitar). Doubling echo A similar technique to ADT is doubling echo, which uses short delays to mimic the double tracking effect. Many effects units were developed to produce similar sounds, such as chorus, flangers, and phasers, all of which use an oscillating delay (or, in the phaser, a variable phase network). Other notable uses of ADT doubling echo are apparent on select material by Elton John. Some examples of this can be heard on Nigel Olsson's drums, especially the tom toms, on songs such as Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me from the Caribou album, as well as Better Off Dead and Someone Saved My Life Tonight on Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy. Arrival of digital technology ADT became the standard recording studio technique for simulating double tracking throughout the late 1960s and 1970s until the arrival of digital technology in the 1980s (although not all engineers could apparently figure out how to reproduce the effect successfully, with Jack Douglas recalling that he was at a loss when John Lennon asked him to use ADT on his vocals during a recording session in 1980 but was unable to adequately explain to his producer how the tape decks should be set up to create the effect). With the advent of digital recording, tape- and analog-based delay methods have not been much used, though many of these analog techniques are frequently emulated using comparable digital techniques, or in some cases plugins which are used to extend the capabilities of a digital audio workstation. Although using digital delay to simulate double-tracking produces a very similar effect to ADT, some claim to be able to hear the difference between the two (certainly one can tell the difference between digital delay and manual double-tracking, as was the case with ADT in previous years ‚Äì manual double-tracking continues to be used by a number of artists). Some musicians and engineers may casually use the term ADT to refer to any form of simulated double tracking, including digital delay used in this manner. One of the very few examples of ADT being used in recent times is on the Beatles' Anthology albums from the mid-1990s, on which George Martin and Geoff Emerick decided to revive the analogue technique rather than simply use the modern digital alternatives to achieve a more authentic sound, feeling that ADT produced a warmer, less synthetic sound than digital delay and the latter would be inappropriate for use on recordings made on analogue equipment in the 1960s.

The group disbanded in 1999, but reformed in 2006 and continued to release music until 2014. History Brutal Truth was formed in 1990 in New York City, New York. The band was originally signed to Earache Records, on which they released two albums, Extreme Conditions Demand Extreme Responses and Need to Control, as well as an EP entitled Perpetual Conversion, and 7\\" singles for the songs \\"Ill Neglect\\" and \\"Godplayer\\". During this time, music videos were made for the songs \\"Ill Neglect\\", \\"Collateral Damage\\" and \\"Godplayer\\". Brutal Truth were frustrated with Earache Records and switched to Relapse Records, known for its roster of grindcore acts, with whom they stayed until the band's demise. With Relapse, they released the mini album Kill Trend Suicide, a full-length release entitled Sounds of the Animal Kingdom and a double CD live album called Goodbye Cruel World. The band has also released many split 7\\" singles on smaller labels, with most of these being out of print and difficult to find. The songs from these 7\\" singles were collected on the second disc of Goodbye Cruel World. The band disbanded around 1999 due to internal financial and management conflicts. In 2001, the Guinness Book of Records awarded Brutal Truth the record for \\"shortest music video\\" for their video \\"Collateral Damage\\", which is 2.18 seconds long and consists of 48 still images in rapid succession followed by a clip of an explosion. Richard Hoak, Hole In The Sky 2008 Drummer Richard Hoak also provides vocals and drums for a project titled Total Fucking Destruction. Kevin Sharp released an album with Venomous Concept in 2004, a hardcore punk band featuring members from The Melvins and Napalm Death. He was also a member of Australian grind band Damaged for a little over a year in 1999. He is also currently involved with the Atlanta-based hardcore-metal, grindcore band, Primate, with guitarist Bill Kelliher from Mastodon. Dan Lilker now plays for a host of bands and is currently bassist for the re-united Nuclear Assault. Brutal Truth re-formed in 2006 with three-quarters of the final lineup returning (Lilker, Hoak and Sharp); Erik Burke (of Lethargy) replaced Brent McCarty on guitar. On July 8, 2008, four new Brutal Truth tracks were released on the This Comp Kills Fascists compilation. This is the first new material from the band in almost ten years. On January 21, 2009, it was announced that Brutal Truth had finished recording a new album, entitled Evolution Through Revolution. It was released on April 14 in North America, April 17 in Germany and on April 20 worldwide. The band have also made the entire album available via streaming from their website. A video for \\"Sugardaddy/Branded\\" was released on July 17, 2009. On September 27, 2011, Brutal Truth released End Time on Relapse. In 2012, the band participated in the Lausanne Underground Film and Music Festival, performing material composed by Robert Piotrowicz. In October 2012, Dan O'Hare took over guitar duties. Brutal Truth will release a split with Bastard Noise on November 11, 2013. On January 10, 2014, Lilker announced that he would be retiring from being a full-time recording and touring musician on October 18, 2014, which was his 50th birthday. As a result, Brutal Truth disbanded on this day.

While members of the Norte√±os gang are considered to be affiliated with Nuestra Familia, being a member of Nuestra Familia itself does not signify association as a Norte√±o. Some law enforcement agents speculate that the Nuestra Familia gang, which operates in and out of prisons, influences much of the criminal activity of thousands of Norte√±o gang members in California. The gang's main sources of income are distributing cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamine within prison systems as well as in the community and extorting drug distributors on the streets. Origins Nuestra Familia was organized in Fresno, California, correctional facilities in 1968. In the late 1960s, KRIME Mexican-American inmates of the California state prison system began to separate into two rival groups, Nuestra Familia and the 1957-formed Mexican Mafia, according to the locations of their hometowns (the north-south dividing line is near Fresno, California.) Nuestra Familia were prison enemies of the Southern Latinos who comprised La Eme, better known as the Mexican Mafia. While the Mexican Mafia had initially been created to protect Mexicans in prison, there was a perceived level of abuse by members of La Eme towards the imprisoned Latinos from rural farming areas of Northern California. The spark that led to the ongoing war between Nuestra Familia and members of the Mexican Mafia involved a situation in 1968 in which a member of La Eme stole a pair of shoes from a Northerner at Deuel Vocational Institute in Tracy. This event put into motion the longest-running gang war in the state of California. Operation Black Widow Federal law enforcement agencies, long unable to infiltrate Nuestra Familia, began to step up their investigations in the late 1990s. In 2000 and 2001, 22 members were indicted on Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) charges, including several who were allegedly serving as high-ranking gang leaders while confined in Pelican Bay. Thirteen of the defendants pleaded guilty; the other cases are still ongoing. Two of the defendants face the death penalty for ordering murders related to the drug trade. The largest of the federal investigations was Operation Black Widow. At the time of Operation Black Widow, law enforcement officials had estimated that Nuestra Familia was responsible for at least 600 murders in the previous 30 years. In the aftermath of Operation Black Widow, the five highest-ranking leaders of Nuestra Familia, James \\"Tibbs\\" Morado, Joseph \\"Pinky\\" Hernandez, Gerald \\"Cuete\\" Rubalcaba, Cornelio Tristan, and Tex Marin Hernandez, were transferred to the United States Penitentiary, Florence ADX, the federal supermax prison in Colorado. Renewed organization Since the written constitution of the Norte√±os stated that the gang's leaders resided in Pelican Bay State Prison in California; the relocation of the five leaders led to turmoil among its members. The leadership vacuum resulted in a power struggle between prospective generals. Attorney General Kamala Harris announced the arrest of Nuestra Familia gang members on June 8, 2011 Eventually, three new generals came to power at Pelican Bay, yet two were demoted, leaving only David \\"DC\\" Cervantes as the highest-ranking member of the gang in California. Cervantes' rise marked the first time in decades that the Norte√±os had a single leader at the helm of their criminal organization. The remaining leadership of the organization in Pelican Bay consists of Daniel \\"Stork\\" Perez, Anthony \\"Chuco\\" Guillen and George \\"Puppet\\" Franco. While all Nuestra Familia soldiers and captains in California are expected to follow the orders of Cervantes, a small percentage of the gang remains loyal to the former generals and captains imprisoned in Colorado. California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has complained that keeping the five remaining gang leaders located in the same prison continues to add to California gang violence, and that they should be scattered throughout different prisons. While the recognized leaders of Nuestra Familia in Pelican Bay ask that members respect the former leaders, they have been effectively stripped of their authority. Operation Knockout In April 2010, federal and local law enforcement agencies concluded what was considered the most significant effort to dismantle the Central Coast leadership structure of Nuestra Familia. After months of investigation, at least 37 alleged gang members were arrested during the raids conducted. Law enforcement authorities seized 40 pounds of cocaine, 14 pounds of marijuana, and dozens of firearms. 2013 indictment On June 11, 2013, Santa Clara County district attorney Jeff Rosen announced the indictment of 48 Nuestra Familia associates on 77 felony charges ranging from drug dealing to murder. Membership While Nuestra Familia is primarily a Chicano gang, membership sometimes extends to other Latinos as well as non- Latinos. Members of the organization are considered to have taken a \\"blood oath\\" to join the gang, and are considered lifelong participants. Nuestra Familia's written constitution allegedly states that no member should prioritize women, money or drugs over their membership in the gang. Membership in the gang extends beyond prison. Women are not allowed to become full- fledged members of Nuestra Familia, but are sometimes used for communication and drug-running purposes as they are considered less likely to be noticed by law enforcement agents. The NF has a formal written constitution and claims about 2000 inmate members. Symbols Members of Nuestra Familia are known to wear red bandanas (\\"red rags\\") to identify themselves. Other symbols include use of the number 14 or XIV, as the letter \\"N\\" is the 14th letter of the English alphabet. Nuestra Familia members often use the image of a sombrero with a machete as their gang symbol. Allies and rivals Allies of the Nuestra Familia include the Norte√±os, Bloods, Crips,\\"Nustra Familia\\" , Gang Prevention Services Gulf Cartel, Sinaloa Cartel, Black Guerrilla Family and Bahala Na Gang. Rival gangs include the Mexican Mafia, Mexikanemi, Texas Syndicate, Sure√±os, Peckerwood, Fresno Bulldogs, Nazi Lowriders, Aryan Brotherhood, Public Enemy No. 1 and the 18th Street gang.

Wulfstan exhorts the English to behave in a manner more pleasing to God, and specifically to live according to the laws of the Church and of the king. The ' is noted for its rhetorical achievements, and is considered to represent the height of Wulfstan's skill as a homilist and rhetor.Wormald, \\"Wulfstan (died 1023).\\" The text of the ' has been critically edited many times, most recently by Dorothy Bethurum.Bethurum, ed., The Homilies of Wulfstan, pp. 255-75; Bethurum prints three versions, each numbered 'XX'. The work contains one of several mentions of Old English ', a term cognate to the Old Norse '‚Äîvalkyries. Historical context Wulfstan's past is obscure, though it is possible that he began his ecclesiastical career as a Benedictine monk.Knowles, The Monastic Order in England, p. 64; Whitelock, \\"Archbishop Wulfstan, Homilist and Statesman\\", p. 35. We know that he became Bishop of London in 996, perhaps already aged nearly 50.Wormald, \\"Archbishop Wulfstan: Eleventh-Century State-Builder\\", p. 13 In 1002 he was simultaneously promoted to Bishop of Worcester, and Archbishop of York.Whitelock, \\"A Note on the Career of Wulfstan the Homilist\\", p. 464. He held both sees in plurality until 1016, when he relinquished Worcester. He remained archbishop of York until his death. It was perhaps while he was Bishop of London that he first became well known as a writer of sermons, or homilies, perhaps specifically on the topic of Antichrist.Whitelock, ed., Sermo Lupi ad Anglos, pp. 12-13. As Archbishop of York, Wulfstan's administrative duties were considerable. In addition to tending the spiritual and financial needs of the religious and secular communities of the North of England, he was deeply involved in the vital politics of the South. He was one of the most important members of king √Üthelred II's advisory council, known as the Witan, and as such was active in all the most significant political decisions of the day. By 1008 he had secured the privilege of drafting the official royal legislation promulgated by the king and the Witan. He was deeply concerned with legislation, holding that good laws were essential if a people were to prosper. He continued as the king's chief legal draftsman on into the reign of the Danish king Cnut the Great. It is both remarkable and puzzling that Wulfstan was able to play so central a role in politics under both √Üthelred's and Cnut's reigns, especially as it was under √Üthelred's reign that Wulfstan, in his Sermo Lupi, so vehemently decried the depredations of the Danish and Norwegian Vikings. King √Üthelred II ‚Äî nicknamed √Üthelred 'The Unready' - ruled England from 978‚Äì1016. For virtually his entire reign, England was the object of successive Viking raids. Between the period of 980‚Äì1016, few areas of southern England remained unscathed as first Viking raiding parties, then entire Viking armies looted and ravaged the English countryside.Keynes, \\"√Üthelred II (c.966x8‚Äì1016).\\" √Üthelred, roundly criticised by historians as ineffectual in the face of the Viking onslaught, was never able to mount a successful offense against the nimble Viking fleets, and his efforts to defend his kingdom against Viking armies were continually undermined. √Üthelred and his advisors eventually adopted a policy of buying off the Viking armies with money. These enormous payments, known as Danegeld, had to be levied against English landowners and citizens, and this had a devastating impact on the English economy. Together, the Viking raids and the Danegeld payments brought the English people to their knees. But the Viking assaults continued. Few Englishmen during this time would have seen any reason to be optimistic about his own future or that of his countrymen. The situation became desperate in 1013, when, despite √Üthelred, a prominent leader of the Viking armies, Swein Forkbeard, managed to position himself as king of England. In response, √Üthelred retreated to Normandy where he remained until Swein's death the following year, upon which he immediately negotiated his safe return to England and his reinstatement as king. It is of these events that one of the versions of the Sermo Lupi makes mention. Wulfstan's role in these events are unclear, though sentiments he expresses elsewhere in his writings suggest that he would have supported √Üthelred's cause over any Dane's. Dorothy Whitelock writes that \\"we have no evidence where Wulfstan was at the time of the submission [of England to Swein], but he was at York within a fortnight of [Swegn's] death, and we may suspect that he used his influence to win back the province to the English king √Üthelred.\\"Whitelock, Sermo Lupi ad Anglos, p. 12. Authorship and dating Though Wulfstan's name is never directly attached to the Sermo Lupi, there is no question of Wulfstan's authorship. The text of the Sermo Lupi has survived in five manuscripts, a number of which associate the homily with Wulfstan's nom de plume, Lupus. The five manuscripts represent the text in three versions, one shorter and two longer.Whitelock, Sermo Lupi ad Anglos, pp. 1-5. It is generally accepted that the shorter version is the original, and that one of the longer versions is a later authorial revision; that is, Wulfstan composed the homily, then later re-worked and expanded it. These versions thus provide an opportunity to study the practices of an Old English writer as he revises his own work. The longer version, which Wulfstan probably revised himself, exists in a manuscript known to have been annotated and worked over by the archbishop;Ker, \\"The Handwriting of Archbishop Wulfstan\\", pp. 321-24. in fact, there are many corrections to the Sermo Lupi in this manuscript which were carried out by Wulfstan's own pen. The rubric, or title, for the Sermo Lupi in this manuscript reads: Sermo Lupi ad Anglos quando Dani maxime persecuti sunt eos, quod fuit anno millesimo XIIII ab incarnatione Domini nostri Iesu Cristi, 'The sermon of the Wolf to the English at the time when the Danes [Vikings] harried them, which was in the 1014th year from the birth of Jesus Christ.' Thus the date at which the revision was made was probably 1014.Godden, \\"Apocalypse and Invasion in Late Anglo-Saxon England\\", pp. 143-52. This was the year that √Üthelred returned to England from Normandy and resumed his position as king of the English. It is also the year of a great royal council, at which √Üthelred and his Witan published a new law code.\\"VIII √Üthelred\\", in Liebermann, ed., Die Gesetze der Angelsaschen, pp. 263-68. There is good reason to associate these events with a special oral delivery of the Sermo Lupi by Wulfstan to the re-constituted English Witan.Jonathan Wilcox, \\"Wulfstan's Sermo Lupi ad Anglos as Political Performance: 16 February 1014 and Beyond\\", in Matthew Townend (ed.), Wulfstan, Archbishop of York: The Proceedings of the second Alcuin Conference, Studies in the Early Middle Ages 10 (Turnhout, 2004), pp. 375-96. It seems significant that the Sermo Lupi specifically mentions √Üthelred's exile, recalling it with regret. Rhetorical style and technique Wulfstan not only abstractly discussed the correlation between the Viking invasions and the anger of God, but also explicitly stated the types of acts that God would find condemnable. In order to emphasize the severity of their situation, Wulfstan employed a variety of rhetorical techniques to elicit a sense of urgency (phrase repetition, metaphorical language, etc.). Rather than suggesting a unified stance against the Vikings, he implored his congregation/English population to abandon the behaviors of plundering, selling one another into slavery, betraying one's lord, buying women for sexual gratification, breaking religious and moral pledges, praising false gods, and a variety of other deplorable acts. Wulfstan, however, articulated that it was still possible to avoid the apocalypse/wrath of God, if they steered away from the devil and instead remain obedient and respectful to the Almighty. Wulfstan attained a high degree of competence in rhetorical prose, working with a distinctive rhythmical system based around alliterative pairings. He used intensifying words, distinctive vocabulary and compounds, rhetorical figures, and repeated phrases as literary devices. These devices lend Wulfstan's homilies their tempo-driven, almost feverish quality, allowing them to build toward multiple climaxes.See discussions in Bethurum, The Homilies of Wulfstan, pp. 87-98, and Angus McIntosh, Wulfstan's Prose. The genius of his style is based chiefly on sound and parallelsim. The passage below, taken from the Sermo Lupi, employs numerous rhetorical devices, including alliteration, parallelism, tautology, and rhyme: { :Old English :For√æam hit is on us eallum swutol & gesene √æ√¶t we √¶r √æysan oftor br√¶can √æonne we bettan, & √æy is √æysse √æeode fela ons√¶ge. Ne dohte hit nu lange inne ne ute: ac w√¶s here & hunger, bryne & blodgyte, on gewelhwylcan ende oft & gelome. & us stalu & cwalu, stric & steorfa, orfcwealm & unco√æu, hol & hete & rypera reaflac derede swy√æe √æearle.Bethurum, The Homilies of Wulfstan, p. 269, lines 53-58.  :Modern English :Therefore it is clear and well seen in all of us that we have previously more often transgressed than we have amended, and therefore much is greatly assailing this nation. Nothing has prospered now for a long time either at home or abroad, but there has been military devastation and hunger, burning and bloodshed in nearly every district time and again. And stealing and slaying, plague and pestilence, murrain and disease, malice and hate, and the robbery by robbers have injured us very terribly.Translation by Ser, The Electronic Sermo Lupi ad Anglos. } The Sermo Lupi, as with all of Wulfstan's literary works, is known for its frequent, almost habitual, use of intensifying phrases.Bethurum, The Homilies of Wulfstan, p. 90. Examples from the passage above include oft & gelome \\"often and frequently\\" and swy√æe √æearle \\"very terribly.\\" Other intensifying phrases frequently used by Wulfstan, in the Sermo Lupi and in other of his works, are ealles to swy√∞e \\"altogether too much\\", georne \\"eagerly\\", mide rihte \\"in right manner\\", for Gode and for worulde \\"for God and for world\\", among others. Famously, Wulfstan often created long 'lists of sinners', wherein he joined a series terms (of compound words, and often used by no one else) into groups using alliteration. One of the most famous examples is found in the Sermo Lupi: { :Old English :Her syndan √æurh synleawa, awa hit √æincan m√¶g, sare gelewede to manege on earde. Her syndan mannslagan and m√¶gslagan and m√¶sserbanan and mynsterhatan; and her syndan mansworan and mor√æorwyrhtan; and her syndan myltestran and bearnmyr√∞ran and fule forlegene horingas manegel and her syndan wiccan and w√¶lcyrian; and her syndan ryperas and reaferas and woroldstruderas; and, hr√¶dest is to cwe√æenne, mana and misd√¶d ungerim ealra.Treharne (2004:232).  :Modern English :Here, so it might seem, too many in the land are sorely injured by the wounds of sin: here are man-slayers, and killers of kinsmen, and murderers of priests, and enemies of monasteries, and here are cruel perjurers and murderers, and here are whores and child-killers, and many foul fornicating adulterers, and here are witches and Valkyries, and here are robbers and plunderers, and mighty despoilers, and, to speak briefly, numberless kinds of crime and every misdeed.Orchard (1997:184). } A similar device is at work in his list of afflictions in the first passage given above (here & hunger, bryne & blodgyte ... stalu & cwalu, stric & steorfa, orfcwealm & unco√æu, hol & hete...). The Sermo Lupi is considered to excel particularly in the use of repetition as a rhetorical device .Bethurum, The Homilies of Wulfstan, pp. 355-56. Other devices which have been noticed in Wulfstan's works are dubitatio and verborum exornatio.Bethurum, The Homilies of Wulfstan, pp. 90-92. His works are almost completely without metaphor and simile, and Wulfstan as a rule shies away from narrative and descriptions of the particular.Bethurum, The Homilies of Wulfstan, pp. 91, 97-98. The Sermo Lupi is one of his only works where description (i.e. of the moral decline of the nation) plays a significant role. Wulfstan's Sermo Lupi also employs the rhetorical device known as Ubi sunt (Latin, \\"where are... ?\\"), a common medieval literary refrain used \\"to designate a mood or theme in literature of lament for the mutability of things.\\"Oxford English Dictionary, second edition, s.v. ubi sunt. Though the refrain never properly arises in the Sermo Lupi (in English nor in Latin), the theme is nevertheless vigorously active as Wulfstan presents the cherished goods and virtues of the past as lost in the present due to the moral decline of Men and the world through time. Primary themes *The world nears its end, and worsens every day as the time of Antichrist approaches. The Devil has led the English nation astray. Evil and injustice fill the land and none seeks a remedy. We have suffered much, yet we have deserved much. Even in heathen lands offerings are made to gods, but here we have stripped the Church and her servants of honour and of wealth. Since King Edgar's death, the laws of England have greatly deteriorated. Sanctuaries are violated, widows are forced to marry unjustly, and many are made poor and taken advantage of and sold into slavery abroad. Children are enslaved for stealing, and the rights of citizens and slaves are taken away. God's own laws and teachings are hated. We are disgraced through God's anger, and it will become worse for us unless we seek His protection. *Much afflicts the nation, and no one prospers. Violence, hunger, pestilence, hate, and theft are rampant. Heavy taxation afflicts everyone. Storms ruin crops. The ties of kinship are no longer meaningful. We have made our own desires into law, and have ignored true law. Everyone seeks to betray and insult his neighbour. A lord is betrayed by his own men. The worst crime is to betray one's lord to death or to drive him from the land. Both have occurred here recently: King Edward was murdered and burned, and King √Üthelred was driven from his own kingdom. Innocent people have been slaughtered too often. Rich men frequently neglect to upkeep religious houses. *It is terrible to know that men often jointly purchase a woman, ravage her like dogs, and then sell her again to their enemies. Fathers sell their sons for profit, and sons their mothers. Too many perjure themselves and break oaths. A slave will flee his master to become Viking, and gains more honour thereby than his previous master keeps. We disgracefully pay off our enemies, and the English are continually defeated. Pirates are made strong, and one of them can drive away ten of our own, so afflicted are we with sin. Our lot is misery and public shame for we honour those who injure us and pay who humiliate us. *The nation is corrupted through vice. Crimes of every sort are perpetrated. Men are more ashamed now of good deeds than of evil ones. On account of pride no one repents of their sins, though books tell us to. We must seek remedy through repentance if we are to protect ourselves from God's anger, lest we suffer the fate of the Britons. The Britons were also afflicted with too many sins, and did not call out against evil when they saw it. Through their pride they angered God and he made foreigners (then the Anglo-Saxons) invade this island and take it from them. *Thus let us turn to what is right and abandon wickedness. Let us follow God's laws and the king's, and atone for our wrongdoings. Let us behave as we promised we would at baptism. Let us keep oaths and be loyal to each other, and think about the Final Judgement and save ourselves from the torments of eternal fire; let us gain for ourselves instead the eternal rewards of Heaven. Historical relevance In the sermon, Wulfstan addresses the entire English nation and holds it accountable for the country's plight. A key element of Wulfstan's sermon was the connection he made between the initial Anglo-Saxon rulers of England (who drove out the Britons from the country) and the Danes who were currently plaguing the country. According to Gildas, the Britons had been defeated because they had sinned against God. God had therefore allowed them to be vanquished. Wulfstan warns his listeners to learn from the past, and not share the fate of the Britons. The Sermon of the Wolf is one of many homilies that attribute the Viking raids to the anger of God. In understanding this text as part of Old English homilies that equated and analyzed physical events and natural processes with transcendental forces, modern audiences can observe Christian theology firmly manifesting itself in the psychology of the English population (a theology that most would have been unaware of only a few centuries earlier.) Inadvertently, such types of evocative speeches/texts presented the English as their own worst enemy, ultimately culminating in a passive response toward Viking conquests as they were not the source of their plagues. This attitude thus allowed the Danes to proceed further inland and form their own settlements in various regions. The sermon has been regarded as \\"an invaluable witness to the dismal state of affairs in √Üthelred's reign\\", as it is one of the only contemporary documents which describes the effects of the Viking invasions in the beginning of the eleventh century.Simon Keynes, \\"An Abbot, and Archbishop, and the Viking Raids of 1006-7 and 1009-12\\", Anglo- Saxon England 36 (2007): 151-220, at p. 203; Keynes, \\"The Declining Reputation of King √Üthelred the Unready\\", in David Hill (ed.), Ethelred the Unready: Papers from the Millenary Conference, British Archaeological Reports, British Series 59 (1978), pp. 227-53.

He became both a religious as well as civic leader in Saint Paul during the turn of the 20th century. Ireland was known for his progressive stance on education, immigration and relations between church and state, as well as his opposition to saloons and political corruption. He promoted the Americanization of Catholicism, especially in the furtherance of progressive social ideals. He was a leader of the modernizing element in the Roman Catholic Church during the Progressive Era. He created or helped to create many religious and educational institutions in Minnesota. He is also remembered for his acrimonious relations with Eastern Catholics. History John Ireland was born in Burnchurch, County Kilkenny, Ireland, and was baptized on September 11, 1838. Shannon, J. P. \\"Ireland, John\\" New Catholic Encyclopedia, Vol. 7. 2nd ed. Detroit: Gale, 2003 His family immigrated to the United States in 1848 and eventually moved to Saint Paul, Minnesota, in 1852. One year later Joseph Cr√©tin, first bishop of Saint Paul, sent Ireland to the preparatory seminary of Meximieux in France. Ireland was consequently ordained in 1861 in Saint Paul. He served as a chaplain of the Fifth Minnesota Regiment in the Civil War until 1863 when ill health\\"Ireland, John\\" in Webster's American Biographies (1979), Springfield, MA: Merriam. caused his resignation. Later, he was famous nationwide in the Grand Army of the Republic.\\"Ireland, John\\", in Webster's American Biographies (1979), Springfield. MA: Merriam. He was appointed pastor at Saint Paul's cathedral in 1867, a position which he held until 1875. In 1875, he was made coadjutor bishop of St. Paul and in 1884 he became bishop ordinary. In 1888 he became archbishop with the elevation of his diocese and the erection of the ecclesiastical province of Saint Paul. Ireland retained this title for 30 years until his death in 1918. Before Ireland died he burned all of his personal papers.Empson, The Streets Where You Live, 144 John Ireland was personal friends with Presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt. At a time when most Irish Catholics were staunch Democrats, Ireland was known for being close to the Republican party. He opposed racial inequality and called for \\"equal rights and equal privileges, political, civil, and social.\\"\\"Ireland, John\\", in Webster's American Biographies (1979), Springfield, MA: Merriam. Ireland's funeral was attended by eight archbishops, thirty bishops, twelve monsignors, seven hundred priests and two hundred seminarians.Johnston, Minnesota's Irish, 80 He was awarded an honorary doctorate (LL.D.) by Yale University in October 1901, during celebrations for the bicentenary of the university. A friend of James J. Hill, whose wife Mary was Catholic (even though Hill was not), Archbishop Ireland had his portrait painted in 1895 by the Swiss-born American portrait painter Adolfo M√ºller-Ury almost certainly on Hill's behalf, which was exhibited at M. KNOEDLER & CO., New York, January 1895 (lost)Mail and Express, New York, Friday evening, January 11, 1895; Hill was charged by Knoedler's $92 for the frame in March 1895 (Receipt 560) (James J. Hill Library, St. Paul) and again in 1897 (Archdiocesan Archives, Archdiocese of Saint Paul & Minneapolis). Legacy The influence of his personality made Archbishop Ireland a commanding figure in many important movements, especially those for total abstinence, for colonization in the Northwest, and modern education. Ireland became a leading civic and religious leader during the late 19th and early 20th centuries in Saint Paul. He worked closely with non-Catholics and was recognized by them as a leader of the modernizing Catholics. St. Augustine's Church in Washington, DC, c. 1899. Here John Ireland gave his 1890 sermon on racial equality. Ireland called for racial equality at a time in the U.S. when the concept was considered extreme. On 5 May 1890 he gave a sermon at St. Augustine's Church in Washington, DC, the center of an African-American parish, to a congregation that included several public officials, Congressmen including the full Minnesota delegation, U.S. Treasury Secretary William Windom, and Blanche Bruce, the second black U.S. Senator. Ireland's sermon on racial justice concluded with the statement, \\"The color line must go; the line will be drawn at personal merit.\\" It was reported that \\"the bold and outspoken stand of the Archbishop on this occasion created somewhat of a sensation throughout America.\\" (Sermon full text.) =Colonization= Ireland as a young man Disturbed by reports that Catholic immigrants in eastern cities were suffering from social and economic handicaps, Ireland and Bishop John Lancaster Spalding of the Diocese of Peoria, Illinois, founded the Irish Catholic Colonization Association. This organization bought land in rural areas to the west and south and helped resettle Irish Catholics from the urban slums. Ireland helped establish many Irish Catholic colonies in Minnesota. The land had been cleared of its native Sioux following the Dakota War of 1862. He served as director of the National Colonization Association. From 1876 to 1881 Ireland organized and directed the most successful rural colonization program ever sponsored by the Catholic Church in the U.S. Working with the western railroads and with the Minnesota state government, he brought more than 4,000 Catholic families from the slums of eastern urban areas and settled them on more than of farmland in rural Minnesota. His partner in Ireland was John Sweetman, a wealthy brewer who helped set up the Irish-American Colonisation Company there.List of Sweetman family papers at the National Library of Ireland, compiled 2010 In 1880 he also assisted several hundred people from Connemara in Ireland to emigrate to Minnesota. Unfortunately they arrived at the wrong time of the year and had to be assisted by local Freemasons, an organisation that the Catholic Church condemns on many points. In the public debate that followed, the immigrants, being Gaelic speakers, could not voice their opinions of Bishop Ireland's criticism of their acceptance of the Masons' support during a harsh winter.Shannon, JP \\"Bishop Ireland's Connemara Experiment\\"; Minnesota Historical Society Press, Vol.35, 1957http://conamara.org/index.php?page=graceville Note on the conamara.org site, 2011 De Graff and Clontarf in Swift County, Adrian in Nobles County, Avoca, Iona and Fulda in Murray County, Graceville in Big Stone County and Ghent in Lyon County were all colonies established by Ireland.Regan, Irish in Minnesota, 19-20. Charlotte Grace O'Brien, philanthropist and activist for the protection of female emigrants, found that often the illiterate young women were being tricked into prostitution through spurious offers of employment. She proposed an information bureau at Castle Garden, the disembarkation point for immigrants arriving in New York; a temporary shelter to provide accommodation for immigrants, and a chapel, all to Archbishop Ireland,Miller, Chandra. \\"‚ÄòTumbling Into the Fight‚Äô Charlotte Grace O‚ÄôBrien (1845-1909); The Emigrant‚Äôs Advocate\\", History Ireland, Vol. 4, Issue 4 (Winter 1996) who she believed of all the American hierarchy, would be most sympathetic. Archbishop Ireland agreed to raise the matter at the May 1883 meeting of the Irish Catholic Association which endorsed the plan and voted to establish an information bureau at Castle Garden. The Irish Catholic Colonization Association was also instrumental in the establishment of the Mission of Our Lady of the Rosary for the Protection of Irish Immigrant Girls. =Education= A bust of Archbishop John Ireland in the Ireland Memorial Library at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota Ireland advocated state support and inspection of Catholic schools. After several parochial schools were in danger of closing, Ireland sold them to the respective city's board of education. The schools continued to operate with nuns and priests teaching, but no religious teaching was allowed.(May 16, 1892), The \\"Faribault\\" System\\", The New York Times This plan, the Faribault- Stillwater Plan, or Poughkeepsie plan, created enough controversy that Ireland was forced to travel to Vatican City to defend it, and he succeeded in doing so.(May 11, 1892), Archbishop Ireland's Plans upheld by the Vatican, The New York Times He also opposed the use of foreign languages in American Catholic churches and parochial schools. The use of foreign languages was not uncommon at the time because of the recent large influx of immigrants to the U.S. from European countries. Ireland influenced American society by actively promoting the use of the English language by large numbers of German immigrants. He is the author of The Church and Modern Society (1897). =Relations with Eastern Catholics= Saint Paul Seminary's Metropolitan Cross In 1891, Ireland refused to accept the clerical credentials of Byzantine Rite, Ruthenian Catholic priest Alexis Toth, despite Toth being a widower. Ireland then forbade Toth to minister to his own parishioners, despite the fact that Toth had jurisdiction from his own bishop and did not answer to Ireland. Ireland was also involved in efforts to expel all non-Latin Church Catholic clergy from the United States. Forced into an impasse, Toth went on to lead thousands of Ruthenian Catholics out of the Roman Communion and into what would eventually become the Orthodox Church in America. Because of this, Archbishop Ireland is sometimes referred to, ironically, as \\"The Father of the Orthodox Church in America.\\" Marvin R. O'Connell, author of a biography on Ireland, summarizes the situation by stating that \\"if Ireland's advocacy of the blacks displayed him at his best, his belligerence toward the Uniates showed him at his bull- headed worst.\\"O'Connell (1988), p. 271 Establishments Cathedral of Saint Paul, of the Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis At the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore the establishment of a Catholic university was decided. In 1885 Ireland was appointed to a committee, along with, Bishop John Lancaster Spalding, Cardinal James Gibbons and then bishop John Joseph Keane dedicated to developing and establishing The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.. Ireland retained an active interest in the University for the rest of his life. He founded Saint Thomas Aquinas Seminary, progenitor of four institutions: University of Saint Thomas (Minnesota), the Saint Paul Seminary School of Divinity, Nazareth Hall Preparatory Seminary, and Saint Thomas Academy. The Saint Paul Seminary was established with the help of Methodist James J. Hill, whose wife, Mary Mehegan, was a devout Catholic.Empson, The Streets Where You Live, 143 Both institutions are located on the bluffs overlooking the Mississippi River. DeLaSalle High School located on Nicollet Island in Minneapolis was opened in October 1900 through a gift of $25,000 from Ireland. Fourteen years later Ireland purchased an adjacent property for the expanding Christian Brothers school. In 1904 Ireland secured the land for the building of the current Cathedral of Saint Paul located atop Summit Hill, the highest point in downtown Saint Paul. At the same time, on Christmas Day 1903 he also commissioned the construction of the almost equally large Church of Saint Mary, for the Immaculate Conception parish in the neighboring city of Minneapolis. It became the Pro-Cathedral of Minneapolis and later became the Basilica of Saint Mary, the first basilica in the United States in 1926. Both were designed and built under the direction of the French architect Emmanuel Louis Masqueray. John Ireland Boulevard, a Saint Paul street that runs from the Cathedral of Saint Paul northeast to the Minnesota State Capitol, is named in his honor. It was so named in 1961 at the encouragement of the Ancient Order of Hibernians. References Further reading  * .

In geology, a blowhole or marine geyser is formed as sea caves grow landwards and upwards into vertical shafts and expose themselves towards the surface, which can result in hydraulic compression of sea water that is released through a port from the top of the blowhole. The geometry of the cave and blowhole along with tide levels and swell conditions determine the height of the spray.  Mechanics  Blowholes are likely to occur in areas where there are crevices, such as lava tubes, in rock along the coast. These areas are often located along fault lines and on islands. As powerful waves hit the coast, water rushes into these crevices and bursts out in a high pressured release. It is often accompanied by a loud noise and wide spray, and for this reason, blowholes are often sites of tourism. Marine erosion on rocky coastlines produce blowholes that are found throughout the world. They are found at intersecting faults and on the windward sides of a coastline where they receive higher wave energy from the open ocean. The development of a blowhole is linked to the formation of a littoral cave. These two elements make up the blowhole system. A blowhole system always contains three main features: a catchment entrance, a compression cavern and an expelling port. The arrangement, angle and size of these three features determine the force of the air to water ratio that is ejected from the port. The blowhole feature tends to occur in the most distal section of a littoral cave. As their name suggests, blowholes have the ability to move air rapidly. Strong reverse draughts in response to pressure changes in a connecting littoral cave can send wind speeds upwards of 70 km/h. The formation of a blowhole system begins as a littoral cave is formed. The main factors that contribute to littoral caves formation are wave dynamics and the parent material‚Äôs rock property. A parent material property such as susceptibility or resistance to weathering plays a major role in the development of caves. Littoral caves can be formed by one of two processes: caves made of limestone are produced by karst (dissolution) processes, and caves made of igneous rock are produced by pseudokarst (non-dissolutional) processes. In time the littoral cave enlarges growing inland and vertically through weak joints in the parent material. As weathering continues the roof of the cave is exposed, and the blowhole continues to enlarge, eventually the roof of the littoral cave is weaken and collapses. This creates a steep-wall inlet that allows the next stage of coastal morphology to progress.  Ecological impacts  Blowholes have the capacity to change the topography near their locations. Blowholes can eventually erode the area surrounding the crevices to form larger sea caves. In some instances, the cave itself may collapse. This event may create shallow pools along the coast.  Other  A blowhole is also the name of a rare geologic feature in which air is blown through a small hole at the surface due to pressure differences between a closed underground system and the surface. The blowholes of Wupatki National Monument are an example of such a phenomenon. It is estimated that the closed underground passages have a volume of at least seven billion cubic feet. Wind speeds can approach 30 miles per hour. Another well-known example of the blowhole is the natural entrance to the Wind Cave.Rodney D. Horrocks and Bernard W. Szukalski; Using geographic information systems to develop a cave potential map for Wind Cave, South Dakota; Journal of Cave and Karst Studies 64 (1): 63-70. La Bufadora is a large blowhole located in the Punta Banda Peninsula of Baja California, Mexico. It consists of a littoral cave with a thin opening that has a recurrence eruption interval of 13 -17 seconds, ejecting water up to 100 ft. above sea level.

Their name came from the song \\"Blood Duster\\" by John Zorn, from the 1989 album Naked City. History =Formation= The band was formed in 1991 by Jason Fuller (aka Jason PC) (bass), Anthony Barry (vocals and guitar) and Andrew Brown (drums). After completion of their first demo Anthony Barry was replaced by Troy Darlington and Callum Wilson. A self-released demo recording in 1992 was titled Menstrual Soup. By the time the band recorded their first EP, Wilson and Darlington had been replaced by Tony Forde, Shane Rout and Brad Johnston. =Fisting the Dead (1993)= Fisting the Dead, the band's debut, is a straightforward grindcore EP that featured 25 tracks, released in mid-1993. According to Rosemary Overell, \\"They are largely credited with establishing Melbourne's gore- and porno-grindcore aesthetic\\". The tracks were initially recorded for a proposed split album on the Wild Rags label with other tracks by Impetigo and Meat Shits. The track \\"Derek\\" refers to a character played by Peter Jackson in his 1987 cult film Bad Taste, which was \\"heavily influenced by the late-'80s grindcore of such Earache label bands as Carcass and Napalm Death.\\" In 1996, the album was released in the US as bonus tracks on the U.S. CD issue of the group's 1995 EP Yeest, on Relapse Records and Drug Bust Records. In 2001, it was reissued on vinyl with Yeest on the B-side. In 2005, the album was reissued as Fisting the Dead... Again on bassist Jason Fuller's label, with bonus tracks, on Goat Sounds Records. In 2008, it was reissued on Stomp Records with Yeest, the compilation tracks, and live tracks from a gig at the Great Britain Hotel on 18 August 1993 as bonus tracks. AllMusic's Tom Forget described the 2008 version: \\"A noticeable splatter seems to accompany every spin of Blood Duster's mammoth reissue\\". He felt that it \\"traces the band's early-90s grind heyday, before elements of Southern and stoner rock groove seeped into their toxic sound.\\" =1995‚Äì2000= In 1995, Blood Duster released the EP Yeest, which started to show some more rock leanings. The band toured Australia including Canberra in November 1995. The band next produced 1998's Str8 Outta Northcote, which featured a bizarre combination of Southern rock riffs and blasting grindcore. In 1998, Blood Duster again toured Australia with Brutal Truth, and recorded shows for a planned double live album. The next album, controversially entitled Cunt, was released worldwide in 2001 and saw Blood Duster returning to a more percussive-driven grind style. It was also around this time that the band appeared in the music video for the song \\"Thunderbirds Are Coming Out\\" by fellow Australian band TISM. =2001‚Äì2017= After touring with The Dwarves in 2001, Blood Duster released the Drink, Fight, Fuck EP, which featured the track \\"66.6FMONYOURRADIODIAL\\", used in a television commercial for Reflex copying paper, along with three songs in the pre-gap. The eponymous Blood Duster album was released in 2003 and featured special guests including original AC/DC singer Dave Evans, Jay Dunne from 28 Days, and all three members of Melbourne band The Spazzys. Two further singles were released from this album, \\"IWannaDoItWithADonna\\" in 2003 and \\"SixSixSixteen\\" in 2004. Most of 2004 was spent touring Australia, first with the Big Day Out festival and then their own shows. Following tours with The Dwarves and Pungent Stench in early 2005, Blood Duster toured across Europe and Japan to promote the release of their first DVD, The Shape of Death to Come. In 2006, the band issued the live album Kill, Kill, Kill in a limited edition of 500 copies. The album was recorded in Sydney in 1996 during a tour with Brutal Truth. In 2006, Blood Duster began pre-production for a proposed triple album consisting of a disc each of death metal, grind, and drone doom, with guest '70s balladeer and actor Darryl Cotton. Lyden N√• (Norwegian for The Now Sound) was released in April 2007 as a double album, with the third disc available as additional downloadable content. In October 2012 the group released KVLT, a vinyl album, which had been deliberately rendered unplayable; its producer Jason PC explained \\"It's kind of a statement piece ... We made the album, sat down and listened to it, thought: 'Yep, that's perfect, let's wreck it'.\\" Blood Duster played their final show on 9 December 2017 at the Corner Hotel, Richmond.

Lusseyran was born in Paris, France. He became totally blind in a school accident at the age of 7. He soon learned to adapt to being blind and maintained many close friendships, particularly with one boy named Jean. At a young age he became alarmed at the rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany and decided to learn the German language so that he could listen to German radio broadcasts. By 1938, when Nazi Germany annexed Austria, he had accomplished this task. Germany invaded France in 1940. In the spring of 1941, at the age of 17, Lusseyran formed a Resistance group called the Volunteers of Liberty with other students from the Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand and the Lyc√©e Henri- IV. He was put in charge of recruitment. The group later merged with another Resistance group called D√©fense de la France. In July 1943 he organized and participated in a campaign to drop pro-resistance leaflets on trains, and claimed to carry tear gas canisters to stop people from interfering, though he never used them. On July 20, 1943, Lusseyran was arrested by the Gestapo, betrayed by a member of his resistance group named Elio. His knowledge of German helped him understand more of the situation than most French prisoners. He was sent to Buchenwald concentration camp with 2000 other French citizens, where, because he was blind, he did not have to participate in forced labor as most other prisoners did. Soon most of his childhood friends and fellow resistance operatives were arrested, and he met some of them in the concentration camp. Lusseyran helped to motivate a spirit of resistance within the camp, particularly within the French and German prisoners. In April 1945, he was liberated; 30 of his group of 2000 inmates survived. After the war, Lusseyran taught French literature in the United States and wrote books, including the autobiographical And There Was Light, which chronicles the first 20 years of his life. He died together with his third wife Marie in a car accident in France on July 27, 1971. He is survived by his four children.

This bay was where all foreign vessels would dock, hence the name neutral.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollen, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 185 The Aboriginal name for the area was 'Wirra-birra'. In 1789, soon after the arrival of the First Fleet in Sydney, Governor Arthur Phillip declared this bay a neutral harbour where foreign ships could anchor and take on water and supplies.Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Sites - Macquarie Neutral Bay was far enough away from Sydney Cove to discourage convicts from escaping on these vessels and to keep possible enemy ships at a distance from the main settlement.Naming North Sydney Image Library By the beginning of the 20th century, Neutral Bay and Cremorne were developing as \\"alternative society suburbs\\", populated by the kind of people who were attracted to the Arts and Crafts architectural style that was in vogue at the time.Sydney Architecture, Graham Jahn (Watermark Press) 1997 This style was an attempt to get away from mass production and give homes the \\"human touch\\". Notable examples soon appeared in the area. Brent Knowle, in Shellcove Road (now part of Kurraba Point), was designed by Bertrand James Waterhouse and built in 1914.A Pictorial Guide to Identifying Australian Architecture, Apperly (Angus and Robertson) 1994, p.142 It influenced home design in the area for at least the next fifteen yearsSydney Architecture and has a state heritage listing. A different style was used for The Cobbles (now in Kurraba Point), also in Shellcove Road. Designed by Peddle and Thorp and built in 1918, it made great use of natural stones and pebbles to achieve the desired look. It is an Australian interpretation of the California Bungalow style and has a state heritage listing. The Gables, in Spruson Street, was another Waterhouse design and was built in 1920. It was influenced by the \\"shingle style\\" which was brought to Sydney by Horbury Hunt, and featured prominent gables and extensive use of shingles. More Waterhouse designs appeared in Shellcove Road in the vicinity of The Cobbles and Brent Knowle (now in Kurraba Point). An outstanding example is Ailsa (now in Kurraba Point), which was designed by Waterhouse for Captain Robert Craig and built in 1908. It has a state heritage listing. Along with Keynsham (now in Kurraba Point), St Anne's (now in Kurraba Point), and Gundimaine House (now in Kurraba Point), these homes form a significant heritage group and have a state heritage listing. Neutral Bay was also the home of the English-born children's author and painter May Gibbs, who lived for a time in Derry, a two-storey Federation home in Phillips Street. Afterwards, she moved to the home Nutcote in nearby Kurraba Point. Neutral Bay was the location of the Royal Australian Navy's Submarine Service HMAS Platypus (naval base) between 18 August 1967 and 29 March 1999. It was home to the HMA Oberon submarines, with the first HMAS Oxley arriving at the site on the same day as the commissioning. During World War 2 the site was converted for use as the RAN Torpedo Maintenance Establishment (RANTME).  Heritage listings  Neutral Bay has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 2 Hayes Street: Hastings (Neutral Bay) * 146 Kurraba Road: Hollowforth * 5 Wallaringa Avenue: Nutcote * Yeo Street: St John's Uniting Church and Pipe Organ Commercial area Neutral Bay Junction on Military Road The main shopping district of Neutral Bay, known as Neutral Bay Junction, is along Military Road, which is the main road that runs through Neutral Bay, Cremorne and Mosman. It features many quality shops, restaurants and cafes. The Big Bear shopping centre is a shopping mall that features a supermarket and grocery shops. Sydney Buses' North Sydney Bus Depot is located behind the Big Bear. The Oaks Hotel is a well-known and popular venue located on the corner of Military Road and Ben Boyd Road. It has been a popular meeting place in Sydney since 1885. The Oaks Hotel features a number of restaurants, bars, function rooms and a beer garden with the main focal point an old oak tree. Transport At the 2016 census, 39.2% of employed people travelled to work on public transport and 36.4% by car (either as driver or as passenger). The Neutral Bay wharf sits at the end of Hayes Street and it is serviced by both public Neutral Bay ferry services and private ferries. The Warringah Freeway runs along the western border of Neutral Bay, providing links south to the Sydney CBD and north to Chatswood. Military Road has been a prominent local electoral issue, due to issues relating to the heavy traffic congestion on the road.

She is artistic director of Armitage Gone! Dance, a contemporary dance company that performs several times annually in New York City as well as touring internationally. She was dubbed the ‚Äúpunk ballerina‚Äù in the 1980s. She earned a Tony nomination for her choreography of the Broadway musical Hair. Early life and early career Born in Madison Wisconsin, Armitage grew up dividing her time in two places: Gothic, Colorado, and Lawrence, Kansas. Gothic was the site of the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory where her father, a biologist, did research. Armitage began studying ballet in Lawrence, Kansas at the age of four with former New York City Ballet dancer, Tomi Wortham, followed by classes in Crested Butte, Colorado with Shirley Strabhaur. She then continued her studies with Ballet West in Aspen and Salt Lake City, at the School of American Ballet the Harkness House in New York City, at North Carolina School of the Arts, and with Leonide Massine in London. Armitage began her professional career in 1973 as a member of the Ballet du Grand Th√©√¢tre de Gen√®ve in Switzerland. The company, directed by George Balanchine and Patricia Neary, was rooted in the Balanchine aesthetic and devoted exclusively to his repertory. There she performed many Balanchine masterworks including Agon, The Four Temperaments and Serenade. In 1975 she became a Swiss citizen and holds dual citizenship with the US. From 1976‚Äì1981 she was a member of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company performing leading roles across the globe. In 1978, she created her first piece Ne, then followed by the iconic Drastic-Classicism in 1981. Throughout the 1980s, Armitage led her own company, which was based in New York City. Her company toured internationally and was known for its collaborations with artists David Salle and Jeff Koons. In 1984, she was invited by Mikhail Baryshnikov to create a work for the American Ballet Theatre. Three years later, Rudolph Nureyev commissioned one of her works for the Paris Op√©ra Ballet. She created five ballets for the Ballet de l'Op√©ra National de Paris during the 1980s, leading to commissions in the US and Europe which she pursued throughout the 1990s. Armitage was named artistic director and choreographer of MaggioDanza (1995-1998) the ballet company at the Opera House in Florence, Italy, where she choreographed, curated and presented classical repertoire, modern masters and contemporary works. She was named resident choreographer of the Ballet de Lorraine in Nancy, France, in 1999, where she was to remain until 2002 creating over 20 works for the company that toured throughout Europe. In 2004, she served as the artistic director of the Venice Biennale International Festival of Contemporary Dance inviting companies from across the globe to showcase innovative dance throughout the city including in the Arsenale where the Art Biennale is held every two years. Armitage GONE! Dance Returning to New York City after 15 years abroad, Armitage founded her current company, Armitage Gone! Dance in 2004 as a way to create a culture with like-minded dancers exploring new ideas of what dance can do and be.[3] It is administered by the Armitage Foundation a 501 (c) not- for-profit foundation based in New York City. Armitage Gone! Dance has a home at Mana Contemporary, which is based in a vast former tobacco warehouse. Choreographic style Armitage is renowned for pushing boundaries to create works that blend dance, music, science, and art to engage in philosophical questions about the search for meaning. Armitage movement looks spontaneous despite its rigorous craftsmanship. Concepts such as ‚Äúcubism in motion‚Äù are applied to group patterns, creating several vantage points so that movement is seen from multiple perspectives, angles, and levels, with planes bleeding into each other. The steps are based on calligraphy and fractal geometry (that of clouds, mountains, seashores), creating a sinuous, curvilinear vocabulary unlike the Euclidean geometry of dance tradition. The dancers share a common purpose but do not dance in unison, producing a funky, democratic individuality with lyricism punctuated by raw, visceral accents. She is inspired by disparate, non-narrative sources, from 20th century physics, to 16th century Florentine fashion, to pop culture and new media. In her hands, the classic vocabulary is given a needed shock to its system, with speed, fractured lines, abstractions and symmetry countermanded by asymmetry. Music is her script and she has collaborated with contemporary and experimentalist composers such as John Luther Adams, Thomas Ad√®s, Rhys Chatham, Vijay Iyer, and Lukas Ligeti. The scores can be marked by extreme lyricism as well as dissonance, noise and polyrhythms The sets and costumes for her works are often designed by leading artists in the contemporary art world, including Karen Kilimnik, Jeff Koons, Vera Lutter, David Salle, Phillip Taaffe and Brice Marden. She has also collaborated with fashion designers Christian Lacroix, Jean-Paul Gaultier, and Peter Speliopoulos with whom she has created many works. Film director James Ivory created sets and costumes for an evening of her choreography that was performed in Italy's historic Teatro della Pergola, built in 1656. Armitage's choreography can be divided into three distinct, aesthetic periods: punk, picture, and poetry\\" =Punk= Armitage joins a long lineage of artists looking at the past at the same time as they seek to dismantle it. Her early work fused Merce Cunningham's aesthetics with an ebullient, joyous, punk-inspired jubilation in destroying the old to bring in the new. The work not only challenged formal notions of dance, but its imagery and content heralded the rise of themes relating to sexuality and gender that became so important in late 20thand early 21st Century discourse. She changed the idea of the ballerina, portraying her as independent thinker with an erotic appetite, rather than as an unobtainable, romantic ideal. In 1980 she put a man in a skirt on the stage as a matter of fact, rather than as drag. In 1982, Armitage was inspired to examine her roots as a classical ballet dancer after creating three new works for the Paris Opera Ballet at the invitation of Rosella Hightower and Rudolph Nureyev. She combined Balanchine's poetic refinement and brilliant phrase making with Cunningham's use of stage space as a field of action. Her controversial recipe combining the warring factions of ballet and modern dance injected with hard rock energy and the taboo of sexual content, gave dance a much needed shock to its systems with speed, fractured lines, off-balance movement, abstractions and symmetry countermanded by asymmetry and punch. =Picture= In 1984 Armitage met painter, David Salle, at a post performance dinner that included the choreographer, Yvonne Rainer. The meeting led to the second period in Armitage's aesthetic development as Armitage and Salle began a collaboration that continues to this day. Salle's work, combining figuration with an extremely varied pictorial language, brought dazzlingly original sets and costumes to the stage. The early Armitage/Salle collaborations were made in a free-spirited exploration of style, eras, pluralities and comparatives, embracing the contamination of languages in a mosaic of pattern. The divisions between ballet and modern, high and low, serious and banal disappeared through collage, juxtaposition and humor. Armitage and her dancers performed to spoken text, classical and popular music, jazz, world music and silence. Exploring American identity from the perspective of a culture using everything to sell products, Armitage and Salle's stage work created a contemplative universe awash in color. Though Armitage found consumer culture's influence on the creation of self disturbing, her collaboration with Salle was done, not in the spirit of the social critique, but in the spirit of the artist struggling for form, for the new, for the experimental. Jeff Koons joined Salle in designing several Armitage productions. The first collaboration in 1988 resulted in Gogo Ballerina for which Koons and Salle shared the costume design while Koons created sets. Armitage worked closely with Koons discussing themes and content for the new work, inspiring the creation of large, interactive sets for the piece. Her dancers used them physically: emerging from a black, heart-shaped chocolate box, dancing on illuminated gogo boxes with red plexiglas bears, hearts, and flowers and breaking apart a large, extravagant cake. The Koons sets were destroyed in the early 2000s when the expense of storage became prohibitive. Salle and Koons worked together again in 1989 on Contempt, Overboard (1991) and The Predators‚Äô Ball/Hucksters of the Soul (1996) where both contributed set and costumes. =Poetry= In 1995 Armitage was invited to direct the Ballet of Florence, Italy (known as MaggioDanza). The influence of Italian history, politics and aesthetics, living on the streets of Dante and Machiavelli, led to a third, poetic, period in Armitage's artistic thinking. She began to work with a minimum of ingredients to engage in philosophical questions about the search for meaning. Her ideas continued to develop while living in Naples working for the Teatro di San Carlo and in Venice where she directed the Venice International Biennale of Contemporary Dance. Her long collaboration with fashion designer Peter Speliopoulos began in 2000 with The Birds, created for the Greek National Ballet in Athens. He designed over 30 Armitage productions in opera and dance for important theaters in Europe including productions in France when Armitage served as resident choreographer for the Ballet de Lorraine (1999-2004). Their collaboration forms a significant role in the third period of Armitage's work. Upon her return to New York in 2004, Armitage relaunched Armitage Gone! Dance in a period of intense creativity. To complement her work with visual artists, Armitage began an ongoing collaboration with scientists, drawing upon conceptual ideas around time, space and geometry. In this new phase, Armitage created movement that looks spontaneous and personal, despite it is rigorous craftsmanship. Here dance, light, music, and design are unified into a balanced whole. Concepts such as ‚Äúcubism in motion‚Äù are applied to group patterns creating several vantage points so that movement is seen from multiple perspectives, angles and levels with planes bleeding into each other. The steps themselves are based on calligraphy and fractal geometry (the geometry of nature: clouds, mountains, seashores) creating a sinuous, curvilinear vocabulary unlike the Euclidean geometry of the dance tradition. In her work, the dancers share a common purpose but do not dance in unison. Her spatial design is both elaborate and cohesive, producing a funky, democratic individuality. Extreme lyricism is punctuated by raw, violent accents. Music Armitage has choreographed to silence, used text as a score, worked with punk, rock, rap, electronic dance music and commissioned new scores. She searches for music that has a lot of space and silence, allowing the audience to see dance as a primary source of communication. Armitage has also worked with classical music, such as that of composers B√©la Bart√≥k (Time is the echo of an axe within a wood, Gy√∂rgy Ligeti (Ligeti Essays) and, more recently of Gy√∂rgy's son, Lukas Ligeti. In a conversation with Lukas Ligeti for BOMB Magazine, Armitage described the challenge of choreographing Itutu. Itutu is a dance piece set to both Ligeti's own compositions and those of Burkina Electric, a band based in Burkina Faso. Ligeti works with electronica and Burkinabe popular music in collaboration with the dancer-musicians in the group. Itutu was an opportunity to \\"make these disparate, contradictory musical worlds mean something theatrical, exploring poly-visual dance and altered states of consciousness.\\"[7] Dance Commissions Armitage has created dances for numerous companies including the Paris Opera Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, The Tasmanian Dance Company, Extemporary Dance Company, England, The White Oak Dance Project, the Deutsche Oper Berlin, the Bayerische Staatsoper in Munich, Les Ballets de Monte Carlo, Lyon Opera Ballet, Ballet Nacional de Cuba, The Greek National Ballet, the Washington Ballet, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, The Kansas City Ballet, the Bern Ballet, The Washington Ballet, Balletto Teatro di Torino, Rambert Dance Company, Introdans in Holland and the Boston Ballet. Dance and Science In 2010 Armitage created the first part of Three Theories inspired by Brian Greene's popular science book The Elegant Universe. This premiered at the World Science Festival (physics of black holes and string theory.[4] Armitage stated that \\"Physics makes me dream. I try to think outside the box and open up my mind. I like science. Science always questions authority. This conflict between theories seemed to me so dramatic and so incredibly fundamental.\\"[5] The Armitage GONE! Dance Company, debuted the full-length work version of Three Theories, in 2010 at Champaign-Urbana's Krannert Center for the Performing Arts. The piece, born out of Armitage's desire to embody core principles of physics, presented performing refreshingly virtuosic contemporary ballet choreography. In March 2015, Armitage collaborated with the Stanford University biologist Paul Ehrlich and 30 dancers to create On The Nature of Things, a work about climate change in the Milstein Hall of Ocean Life at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, the first time the museum hosted a performance season. Dance and Theater In the summer of 2010 Armitage worked with the MIT- based composer Tod Machover on his opera titled Death and the Powers. In this opera Armitage incorporated choreography for robots as well as for singers. Armitage has worked several times at the American Repertory Theater, notably David Adjmi's play Marie Antoinette which was also performed at the Yale Repertory Theater with Armitage choreography Dance and Orchestras Armitage choreographed two works for the New York Philharmonic presented at Lincoln Center's Avery Fischer Hall. Both productions were conducted by Music Director, Alan Gilbert. The first, Jan√°ƒçek's The Cunning Little Vixen premiered in 2011. The second, A Dancers Dream, (2013) featured New York City Ballet principle dancers Sara Mearns and Amar Ramasar with Armitage Gone! Dance in choreography to music by Igor Stravinsky. In 2016 Armitage and Armitage Gone! Dance were commissioned by the London Philharmonia to create Agon with music by Stravinsky, conducted by Esa- Pekka Salonen as part of their Myths and Rituals season. Opera Director Armitage has directed operas from the baroque and contemporary repertoire for many of the prestigious houses of Europe. These include the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples, Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet in Paris, the Lyric Opera in Athens and Het Muzik Theater in Amsterdam. Her most recent production of Orfeo ed Euridice for the Teatro di San Carlo Opera House in Naples from 2015 was filmed for RAI television and made into a DVD. In 2007 Armitage directed and choreographed counter tenor Anthony Roth Costanzo's Princeton production of Zefirino - The Voice of a Castrato. Armitage directed Ariadne Unhinged for the Gotham Chamber Opera in New York and operas for Opera Saratoga including Dido and Aeneas (2015) and Philip Glass's (2016) The Witches of Venice. Making Art Dance Exhibition (2015) In 2015 Mana Contemporary presented Making Art Dance, an exhibition that surveyed 35 years of Armitage collaboration with artists and fashion designers in a 25,000 square foot gallery. Costumes, backdrops, sets, and drawings from 1978-2015 were nailed to walls, pinned on dress forms and hung from the rafters. Making Art Dance exhibition at Mana Contemporary Christian Marclay, while a student at Mass College of Art, created set, costumes and posters for Armitage's first work Ne in 1978. Her subsequent punk pieces were designed by filmmaker, Charles Atlas. Painter, David Salle became her primary collaborator in 1984. Salle created films, costumes, backdrops, sculpture, flats, and props for several incarnations of New York-based Armitage dance companies as well as for European ballet and opera productions. Carroll Dunham created a backdrop for Les Stances a Sophie in 1988. Jeff Koons worked with Armitage from 1987 ‚Äì 1996 on productions in the US and abroad creating sets and costumes in collaboration with David Salle. Philip Taaffe collaborated on Scheherzade in 1995 and on Itutu in 2008. Brice Marden created backdrops for the Italian production of Orfeo ed Eurdice in 2004 at Teatro di San Carlo in Naples. For Ariadne Unhinged in 2008, Vera Lutter created the set and Donald Baechler designed props. Karen Kilimnik created painted panels based on Domenico Tiepolo's Il Designi Di Pulcinella for Made in Naples in 2009. Armitage collaborators include composers, architects, fashion designers, lighting designers and scientists. Film director, James Ivory created sets and costumes for Armitage in Florence, Italy, as did Jean Paul Gaultier and Christina Lacroix. Peter Speliopoulos, Creative Director of Donna Karan collaborated extensively to create costumes for Armitage productions from the mid 1990s and continues to do so today. A smaller version of the exhibition was presented at the National Museum of Dance in Saratoga Springs, New York from 2015-2016. Several Armitage costumes remain on permanent display. Popular culture In addition to working for the stage, Armitage has worked with pop music, including choreography for Michael Jackson's In The Closet and Madonna's Vogue.[6] In 2012, she choreographed the Cirque du Soleil show Amaluna, a show highlighting the beauty and strength of women, loosely based on Shakespeare's The Tempest, directed by Diane Paulus.[8] She has also choreographed several movies in collaboration with director, James Ivory, including The Golden Bowl and The White Countess. Her work has been the subject of two documentaries made for television: The South Bank Show (1985), directed by David Hinton and Wild Ballerina (1998), directed by Mark Kidel. Her ballet Rave was filmed for television for the European channel Arte. Works *Ne (1978) - Armitage Gone! Dance - St. Francis Xavier High School gym.

It was essentially a slightly modified version of the Hansa-Brandenburg C.I aircraft that Aero had built during World War I as the Ae.10, and for this reason, the aircraft is sometimes referred to as the A.14 Brandenburg. When equipped with a slightly different engine (the Hiero L in place of the standard Hiero N), the aircraft was designated A.15 instead. The two versions were otherwise almost identical. Even though it was obsolete by the time it entered production in 1922, the A.14 is nevertheless noteworthy for its role in the establishment of Czech airline CSA.

It was founded in Greenwich Village in 1971 by Steina and Woody Vasulka, who were frustrated at the lack of an outlet for video art. The space takes its name from the original location, the kitchen of the Mercer Arts Center which was the only available place for the artists to screen their video pieces. Although first intended as a location for the exhibition of video art, The Kitchen soon expanded its mission to include other forms of art and performance. In 1974, The Kitchen relocated to a building at the corner of Wooster and Broome Streets in SoHo, and incorporated as a not-for-profit arts organization. In 1987 it moved to its current location. The first music director of The Kitchen was composer Rhys Chatham. The venue became known as a place where many No Wave bands like Glenn Branca, Lydia Lunch and James Chance performed. Notable Kitchen alumni also include Philip Glass, Laurie Anderson, Rocco Di Pietro, John Moran, Jay Scheib, Young Jean Lee's Theater Company, Peter Greenaway, Michael Nyman, Steve Reich, Pauline Oliveros, Gordon Mumma, Frederic Rzewski, Ridge Theater, The Future Sound of London, Leisure Class, Elliott Sharp, Brian Eno, Arthur Russell, Meredith Monk, Arleen Schloss, Vito Acconci, Keshavan Maslak, Elaine Summers, Lucinda Childs, Bill T. Jones, David Byrne/Talking Heads, chameckilerner, John Jasperse, Bryce Dessner, Nico Muhly, Dave Soldier, Soldier String Quartet, Komar and Melamid, ETHEL, Chris McIntyre, Sylvie Degiez, Wayne Lopes/CosmicLegends, Cindy Sherman, and Swans. Today, The Kitchen focuses on presenting emerging artists, most of whom are local, and is committed to advancing work that is experimental in nature. Its facilities include a 155-seat black box performance space and a gallery space for audio and visual exhibitions. The Kitchen presents work in music, dance, performance, video, film, visual art, and literature.The Kitchen website History =Mercer Arts Center (1971‚Äì1973)= Looking for a way to present their work to a public audience, Steina and Woody Vasulka rented the kitchen of the Mercer Arts Center, in the former Broadway Central Hotel in Greenwich Village, Manhattan. (The Mercer Arts Center was an important venue for music and theater performance in New York City from 1971 to 1973.) The Vasulkas, with help from Andy Mannik, opened The Kitchen as a presentation space for video artists on June 15, 1971. Later that year, the Vasulkas added music to their programming and named Rhys Chatham the first music director. The Kitchen continued their eclectic programming at the Mercer Arts Center until the summer of 1973 when they began planning to move to 59 Wooster Street. On August 3, 1973, the building that housed the Mercer Arts Center collapsed,Allan Kozinn (January 4, 2013), Drying Out After a Storm, and Moving On The New York Times. making this decision final. =Move to SoHo (1973‚Äì1986)= The 1973-1974 season started in The Kitchen‚Äôs new location at the corner of Wooster and Broome streets in the former LoGiudice Gallery Building. During its time on 59 Wooster Street The Kitchen emerged as New York‚Äôs premiere avant-garde and experimental arts center. In addition to a performance space, a gallery and video viewing room were established at this location. At new location, The Kitchen began a program of video distribution, when video was still considered an experimental form. =Today (1986‚Äìpresent)= The Kitchen moved uptown to 512 West 19th Street to begin the spring 1986 season and subsequently purchased the space in 1987. The inaugural event series in The Kitchen‚Äôs new home was entitled New Ice Nights. In 1991 The Kitchen held its twentieth anniversary celebration: The Kitchen Turns Twenty with a retrospective mini-music festival entitled Five Generations of Composers, as well as a re-creation of Jean Dupuy‚Äôs Soup and Tart, entitled: Burp: Soup and Tart Revisited. The Kitchen remains a space for interdisciplinary and experimental work by focusing its programming on emerging artists. In fall of 2011, after seven years as the Executive Director and Chief Curator of The Kitchen, Debra Singer handed over the reins to former ArtForum Editor-in-Chief Tim Griffin. In 2012, Hurricane Sandy flooded The Kitchen with four feet of water from the Hudson River, causing damage of about $450,000. With insurance only cover less than half the loss from the storm, the Kitchen received grants from Time Warner and the Art Dealers Association of America, as well as from nonprofit organizations and foundations (like the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts).

Past curators have included Sarah Michelson, Dean Moss, Yasuko Yokoshi, and Miguel Gutierrez. Dance and Process is The Kitchen's longest running series. *From 1994 to 1997, the Hybrid Nights performance series was initiated by curator, Kathryn Greene also known as Caterina Verde. * On November 10, 1995, David Hykes' Earth to the Unknown Power was performed here by The Harmonic Choir. The concert was sent live via ISDN to Le Thoronet Abbey in Southern France, where the exquisite acoustics was recorded and then broadcast back to the audience in New York.\\"CD description in the French National Library\\" * From 2000 to 2005, The Kitchen produced a music series called Kitchen House Blend, in which composers were commissioned to write for its \\"house band,\\" a 10-piece experimental chamber ensemble whose instrumentation included drums, percussion, keyboard, trumpet, trombone, two multi-instrumentalist wind players, violin, cello, and bass. Conceived by Music Curator John King, the goal for Kitchen House Blend was to combine musicians and composers from various communities to create new works that crossed boundaries of style and performance practice. During the series, The Kitchen commissioned music by a total of 30 composers including Matthew Shipp, Susie Ibarra, Roy Nathanson, Elliott Sharp, Roy Campbell, Jr., Zeena Parkins, Evan Ziporyn, Kitty Brazelton, Vijay Iyer, Anthony Coleman, Lee Hyla, David Krakauer, Ikue Mori, Lois V Vierk, and Derek Bermel. The group also performed and toured choreographer Molissa Fenley and composer and pianist Anthony Davis' early 1980s collaborative work Hemispheres. * In 2011, The Kitchen marked its 40th Anniversary with a number of events throughout the year, beginning with the Spring Benefit Gala, which honored Philip Glass on May 4. Next, were two music events celebrating the anniversary.

The long letter, dubbed Peregrinatio or Itinerarium Egeriae, is addressed to a circle of women at home. Historical details it contains set the journey in the early 380s, making it the earliest of its kind. It survives in fragmentary form in a later copy‚Äîlacking a title, date and attribution. Discovery and identity The middle part of Egeria's writing survived and was copied in the Codex Aretinus, which was written at Monte Cassino in the 11th century, while the beginning and end are lost. This Codex Aretinus was discovered in 1884 by the Italian scholar Gian Francesco Gamurrini, in a monastic library in Arezzo. In 2005 Jes√∫s Alturo identified two new fragments from one manuscript circa 900 in Caroline script.Alturo, Jes√∫s. \\"Deux nouveaux fragments de l'Itinerarium Egeriae du IXe-Xe si√®cle\\". Revue B√©n√©dictine, vol. 115, fasc. 2 (December 2005), pp. 241‚Äì250. doi:10.1484/J.RB.5.100596 Gamurrini published the Latin text and theorised the author was Saint Sylvia of Aquitaine. In 1903 Marius F√©rotin claimed the author is one Aetheria or Egeria, known from a letter written by the 7th century Galician monk Valerio of Bierzo. He dated her pilgrimage to about 381‚Äì384, during the reign of Theodosius I. F√©rotin believed she was from Gallaecia, but in 1909 Karl Meister disputed F√©rotin's theory about the date of Egeria's pilgrimage and her identity. Meister argues that her language shows no evidence of Spanish dialect, but rather, suggests that she may have been from one of the well known religious houses of 6th century Gaul; according to this theory her pilgrimage took place in the first half of the reign of Justinian (r. 527‚Äì565). John Bernard noted that certain details of Egeria's account that support the earlier dating ‚Äî two churches mentioned in the Breviarium and Peregrinatio Theodosii (both circa 530)‚Äîare absent from Egeria's otherwise detailed description of Jerusalem and thus confirm the 4th century dating. Most scholars favor the 4th century date. It is through Valerio's letter that we first see the name Aetheria or Egeria, and have much of the biographical information. He praises Egeria and identifies her as a nun, perhaps because she addresses her account to her \\"sorores\\" (Latin for \\"sisters\\") at home. However, others (including Hagith Sivan, 1988) have pointed out that during Egeria's time it was common to address fellow lay Christians as \\"sisters\\" and \\"brothers.\\" It is possible that Egeria used the term to address her Christian acquaintances.\\"About Egeria\\", on the website The Egeria Project. Valerio may also have believed her to be a nun because she went on such a pilgrimage, although lay women of the time are known to have engaged in such religious tourism. Egeria's ability to make a long and expensive journey by herself, her numerous acquaintances and attentive guides in the places she visited, and her education indicate her middle or upper class wealthy background. In his letter to Egeria, Valerio mentioned the shores of the \\"Western sea\\" or \\"Ocean\\" from which Egeria was sprung, which suggests he was writing about a person travelling from the Roman Gallaecia, but Meister believes that her reference to the river Rhone supports his theory of Gaulish origin. Travels of Egeria Egeria set down her observations in a letter now called Itinerarium Egeriae (\\"Travels of Egeria\\"). It is sometimes also called Peregrinatio Aetheriae (\\"Pilgrimage of Aetheria\\") or Peregrinatio ad Loca Sancta (\\"Pilgrimage to the Holy Lands\\") or some other combination. It is the earliest extant graphic account of a Christian pilgrimage. The text has numerous lacunae. The text is a narrative apparently written at the end of Egeria's journey from notes she took en route, and addressed to her 'dear ladies': the women of her spiritual community back home. In the first extant part of the text, she describes the journey from her approach to Mount Sinai until her stop in Constantinople. Staying for three years in Jerusalem, she made excursions to Mount Nebo and to the tomb of Job in ancient Carneas or Karnaia (modern Al-Shaykh Saad, Syria). Additionally, she visited the burial places of Haran, the brother of Abraham, as well as the site where Eliezer met with Rebecca. She spent time at the Sea of Galilee and comments on the traditions, which include that of Christ feeding the multitude and the place where he performed his miracles. On her way back to Europe she stopped at Hagia Thekla‚Äîi. e. the shrine of Saint Thecla's near Seleucia Isauriae (modern Silifke, Turkey), particularly venerated by women. Upon her return to Constantinople, she planned to make a further trip to St. John's at Ephesus. The second portion of the text is a detailed account of the liturgical services and observances of the church calendar in Jerusalem (most likely, under Cyril), The liturgical year was in its incipient stages at the time of her visit. This is invaluable because the development of liturgical worship (e. g. Lent, Palm or Passion Sunday) reached universal practice in the 4th century. Egeria provides a first-hand account of practices and implementation of liturgical seasons as they existed at the time of her visit. This snapshot is before universal acceptance of a December 25 celebration of the nativity of Jesus; this is very early and very helpful in cataloguing the development of annual liturgical worship. Philologists have studied Egeria's letter, which contains a wealth of information about the evolution of Latin in late antiquity into the \\"Proto-Romance\\" language, from which the medieval and modern family of Romance languages later emerged. For example, expressions such as \\"deductores sancti illi\\" (meaning \\"those holy guides\\" in classical Latin, but here rather simply \\"the holy guides\\") help to reveal the origins of the definite article now used in all Romance languages (except Sardinian)‚Äîsuch as Spanish (\\"las santas gu√≠as\\") or Italian (\\"le sante guide\\"). Similarly, the use of ipsam in a phrase such as \\"per mediam vallem ipsam\\" (classical Latin \\"through [the] middle of [the] valley itself\\") anticipates the type of definite article (\\"p√©ri su mesu de sa b√†dde\\") that is found in Sardinian (\\"sa limba sarda\\").

Located in Yorba Linda, California on land that President Nixon's family once owned, the library is one of 13 administered by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). The campus is located at 18001 Yorba Linda Boulevard in Yorba Linda and incorporates the Richard Nixon Birthplace, a National Historic Landmark where Nixon was born in 1913 and spent his childhood. From its dedication on July 19, 1990 until July 11, 2007, the library and museum was operated by the private Richard Nixon Foundation and was known as the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace. The facility underwent an extensive renovation in 2016 and now features tech-savvy museum exhibits; the complex is jointly operated by NARA and the Richard Nixon Foundation.  Background prior to dedication  Historically, all presidential papers were considered the personal property of the president. Some took them at the end of their terms while others destroyed them. Franklin D. Roosevelt was the first to make them available to the public when he donated them to the National Archives in 1939, as the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum, but did so voluntarily. The Watergate scandal and Richard Nixon's subsequent resignation from office complicated the issue, however. In September 1974, Richard Nixon made an agreement with the head of the General Services Administration, Arthur F. Sampson, to turn over most materials from his presidency, including the tape recordings he had made of conversations in the White House. However, the recordings were to be destroyed after September 1, 1979, if directed by Nixon, or by September 1, 1984, or his death otherwise. Alarmed that Nixon's tapes may be lost, Congress abrogated the Nixon‚ÄìSampson Agreement by passing the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act, which was signed into law by President Gerald Ford in December 1974. It applied specifically to materials from the Nixon presidency, directing NARA to take ownership of the materials and process them as quickly as possible. Private materials were to be returned to Nixon. As a result of the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act, President Nixon's White House papers and tapes were held by the National Archives, and so they could not be transferred to a facility in Yorba Linda. Funding to build the Nixon Library came from private sources. The estimated cost to build the institution was $25 million. Ground was broken by Julie Nixon Eisenhower, the youngest daughter of President Nixon and Mrs. Nixon, in December 1988.  Dedication  The original library and birthplace was officially dedicated on July 19, 1990. Former President Nixon and First Lady Pat Nixon were present, as were President George H. W. Bush, former President Gerald Ford, former President Ronald Reagan, and first ladies Barbara Bush, Betty Ford, and Nancy Reagan. A crowd of 50,000 gathered for the ceremony. At the dedication, Nixon said, \\"Nothing we have ever seen matches this moment‚Äìto be welcomed home again.\\"  Facilities  VH-3A \\"Sea King\\" helicopter is on permanent display. Richard Nixon's birthplace The graves of President Richard Nixon and First Lady Pat Nixon located on the library grounds. The museum, housed in a building, offers a narrative of Nixon's life and career. Behind the museum is the birthplace, which was constructed by Nixon's father using a home building kit, and restored to appear as it was in the 1910s. President Nixon and Pat Nixon are buried on the grounds, just a few feet from the birthplace. The Nixon Library compound also contains the Katharine B. Loker Center and Annenberg Court, a wing constructed in 2004, which includes a special exhibit room and an exact replica of the East Room of the White House that is used as an event space; the Nixon Foundation leases the East Room for events such as weddings and business meetings.  Presidential Museum  There is an extensive collection of memorabilia, artifacts, formal clothing, and photographs of the Nixons and their children. This collection includes an assortment of bronze figures of world leaders who had important relations with Nixon as president or during his service as vice president under President Dwight D. Eisenhower from 1953 to 1961. The leaders have been accurately recreated in lightweight bronze over a papier-m√¢ch√© frame, and they are dressed in their actual clothing. The U.S. government limousine used by President Nixon throughout his presidency, a customized 1969 Lincoln Continental, is on display in the domestic affairs gallery. A piece of the Berlin Wall is exhibited in the expansive foreign affairs gallery, which also includes a replica of a modest Midwest home from where American soldiers originated, statues of Nixon and Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai and pages of the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty I signed by Nixon and Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev in 1972. Lieutenant Colonel Gene Boyer, President Nixon's chief helicopter pilot, secured the President's VH-3A \\"Sea King\\" helicopter, tail number 150617, to be on permanent display on the library grounds. The helicopter was in the presidential fleet from 1961 to 1976, transporting Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, and Ford, and many foreign heads of state and government. Boyer flew President Nixon dozens of times to Camp David, over the pyramids in Egypt, and on his final flight from the White House in this aircraft. The entire facility underwent a $15 million renovation in 2016, and reopened on October 14 of that year with appearances from Dr. Henry Kissinger, former California Governor Pete Wilson and Chinese Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai. The new museum includes nearly 70 exhibits, including a replica of President Nixon's Oval Office. Much of the media surrounding the reopening referred to the museum's appeals to the Millennial generation; USA Today called it \\"a video-centric, cutting-edge experience\\" in which \\"guests are constantly invited to try touch screens or other interactive displays.\\" The money was raised entirely from private sources.  Joint Operation with the National Archives  In January 2004, the United States Congress passed legislation that provided for the establishment of a federally operated Nixon Presidential Library. Specifically, the legislation amended the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act of 1974, which mandated that Nixon's presidential materials were to remain in National Archives II facility in College Park, Maryland. Under this new legislation, over 30,000 presidential gifts as well as millions of presidential records were moved from College Park to Yorba Linda. The Nixon Library has a full-scale, exact replica of President Nixon's Oval Office that guests can enter and interact within. It was created as part of a $15 million renovation of the entire facility in 2016. In March 2005, the Nixon Foundation invited the National Archives to jointly operate the Nixon Library, and then-Archivist of the United States Allen Weinstein allowed for the Nixon Library to become the twelfth federally funded presidential library, operated and staffed by NARA, in conjunction with the Nixon Foundation. In April 2006, Weinstein appointed Timothy Naftali director of the NARA Library activities. On July 11, 2007, the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum was officially welcomed into the federal presidential library system. Before the National Archives took over its management, the Nixon Library had been accused by several media outlets of glossing over Nixon's 1974 resignation with \\"whitewashed\\" exhibits. In 2007, the National Archives removed the Watergate exhibit that had been in place for 17 years and, after three years of empty exhibit space, announced that the new exhibit was scheduled to open in July 2010. The Nixon Foundation objected to the proposed exhibit, specifically the process by which the proposed exhibit was crafted due to the fact that the Nixon Foundation was not consulted in the way that other presidential foundations are in similar situations. The foundation filed a 158-page memorandum to the assistant archivist for presidential libraries expressing its dissatisfaction and NARA stated a committee would review the objection but gave no timeline for when that process would be concluded.

Her name is used as an eponym for a female advisor or counselor. Origin and etymology Egeria may predate Roman myth: she could have been of Italic origin in the sacred forest of Aricia in Latium, her immemorial site, which was equally the grove of Diana Nemorensis (\\"Diana of Nemi\\"). At Aricia there was also a Manius Egerius, a male counterpart of Egeria. The name Egeria has been diversely interpreted. Georges Dum√©zil proposed it came from \\"e-gerere\\", suggesting an origin from her childbirth role.Georges Dum√©zil, La religion romaine archa√Øque, Biblioth√®que historique Payot, , 1974, 2000, appendice sur la religion des Etrusques It may mean \\"of the black poplar\\". Her role as prophetess and author of \\"sacred books\\" would compare her to the Etruscan figure of Vegoia (alleged author among other things of \\"Libri Fulgurales\\", which give keys to interpreting the meaning of lightning strokes, seen as ominous messages from a variety of deities). Function Egeria as a nymph or minor goddess of the Roman religious system is of unclear origin; she is consistently, though not in a very clear way, associated with another figure of the Diana type; their cult is knownJames George Frazer, The Golden Bough, I, \\"The magician king in primitive societies\\" to have been celebrated at sacred groves, such as the site of Nemi at Aricia, and another one close to Rome (see section below); both goddesses are also associated with water bearing wondrous, religious or medical properties (the source in that grove at Rome was dedicated to the exclusive use of the VestalsPlutarch, \\"The parallel lives, Numa Pompilius\\"); their cult was associated with other, male figures of even more obscure meaning, such as one named Virbius,Georges Dum√©zil, La religion romaine archa√Øque, Biblioth√®que historique Payot, , 1974, 2000, appendice sur la religion des Etrusques or a Manius Egerius, presumably a youthful male, that anyway in later years was identified with figures like Atys or Hippolyte, because of the Diana reference (see Frazer). Described sometime as a \\"mountain nymph\\" (Plutarch), she is usually regarded as a water nymph and somehow her cult also involved some link with childbirth, like the Greek goddess Ilithyia. But most of all, Egeria gave wisdom and prophecy in return for libations of water or milk at her sacred groves. This quality has been made especially popular through the tale of her relationship with Numa Pompilius (the second legendary king of Rome, who succeeded its founder Romulus). Relationship with Numa Pompilius The nymph Egeria dictating the laws of Rome to Numa Pompilius, by Ulpiano Checa. According to mythology she counseled and guided the King Numa Pompilius (Latin \\"numen\\" designates \\"the expressed will of a deity\\"Georges Dum√©zil, La religion romaine archa√Øque, Biblioth√®que historique Payot, , 1974, 2000, appendice sur la religion des Etrusques,p47) in the establishment of the original framework of laws and rituals of Rome. Numa is reputed to have written down the teachings of Egeria in \\"sacred books\\" that he had buried with him. When a chance accident brought them back to light some 500 years later, the Senate deemed them inappropriate for disclosure to the people, and ordered their destruction.Plutarch, \\"The parallel lives, Numa Pompilius\\"; Livy AUC libri XXXVIII. What made them inappropriate was some matter of religious nature with \\"political\\" bearing that apparently has not been handed down by Valerius Antias, the source that Plutarch was using. Dionysius of Halicarnassus hints that they were actually kept as a very close secret by the Pontifices.note by Gerard Walter, editor of Plutarch's Parallel Lives; translation by Jacques Amyot, La Pl√©√Øade volume n¬∞43, 1967 She is also gifted with oracular capabilities (she interpreted for Numa the abstruse omens of gods, for instance the episode of the omen from FaunusGeorges Dum√©zil, La religion romaine archa√Øque, Biblioth√®que historique Payot, , 1974, 2000, appendice sur la religion des Etrusques p377). In another episode she helps Numa in a battle of wits with Jupiter himself, whereby Numa sought to gain a protective ritual against lightning strikes and thunder.Plutarch, \\"The parallel lives, Numa Pompilius, ¬ßXXVII\\" Numa also invoked communicating with other deities, such as Muses;Plutarch, \\"The parallel lives, Numa Pompilius\\" hence naturally enough, the somewhat \\"pale\\" figure of Egeria was later categorized by the Romans as one of the Camenae, deities who came to be equated with the Greek Muses as Rome fell under the cultural influence of Greece; so Dionysius of Halicarnassus listed Egeria among the Muses.Dionysius of Halicarnassus, ii. 6o. Numa (1669) by Claude Lorrain The precise level of her relationship to Numa has been described diversely. She is typically given the respectful label coniuncta (\\"consort\\"); Plutarch is very evasive as of the actual mode of intimacy between Numa and Egeria, and hints that Numa himself entertained a level of ambiguity.Plutarch, \\"The parallel lives, Numa Pompilius, 4.2 and 8.6. By Juvenal's day that tradition was treated more critically. Juvenal called her Numa's Amica (or \\"girlfriend\\") in a sceptical phrase.Alex Hardie, \\"Juvenal, the Phaedrus, and the Truth about Rome\\" The Classical Quarterly New Series, 48.1 (1998), pp. 234-251. Numa Pompilius died in 673 BC of old age. According to Ovid's Metamorphoses, with Numa's death Egeria melted into tears of sorrow, thus becoming a spring (...donec pietate dolentis / mota soror Phoebi gelidum de corpore fontem / fecit... Ovid, Metamorphoses xv. 479.), traditionally identified with the one nearby Porta Capena in Rome. Egeria spring in Rome Parco Cafarella, Rome A spring and a grove once sacred to Egeria stand close to a gate of Rome, the Porta Capena. Its waters were dedicated to the exclusive use of the Vestals.Plutarch, \\"The parallel lives, Numa Pompilius\\" The ninfeo, a favored picnic spot for nineteenth-century Romans, can still be visited in the archaeological park of the Caffarella, between the Appian Way and the even more ancient Via Latina,Information about the Park of the Caffarella nearby the Baths of Caracalla (a later construction). In the second century, when Herodes Atticus recast an inherited villa nearby as a great landscaped estate, the natural grotto was formalized as an arched interior with an apsidal end where a statue of Egeria once stood in a niche; the surfaces were enriched with revetments of green and white marble facings and green porphyry flooring and friezes of mosaic. The primeval spring, one of dozens of springs that flow into the river Almone, was made to feed large pools, one of which was known as Lacus Salutaris or \\"Lake of Health\\". Juvenal regretted an earlier phase of architectural elaboration: :Nymph of the Spring! More honour‚Äôd hadst thou been, :If, free from art, an edge of living green, :Thy bubbling fount had circumscribed alone, :And marble ne‚Äôer profaned the native stone.Juvenal, Satire 3.17‚Äì20, as translated by William Gifford. In modern literature * In Nathaniel Lee's English Restoration tragedy Lucius Junius Brutus (1680), Egeria appears in a vision to Brutus' son Titus.  In Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest, the canon Chasuble refers to Cecily's tutor Miss Prism as \\"Egeria.\\" * In Joseph Conrad's Under Western Eyes, (1911) Madame de S___, a Russian lady of \\"advanced views\\" is referred to as the Egeria of Peter Ivanovich, the \\"heroic fugitive\\" who wrote books preaching and practicing the cult of women under the rites of special devotion to the transcendental merits of Madame de S___.

Forbes represented a Long Island district in the United States House of Representatives from 1995 to 2001, first as a Republican (until 1999) and then as a Democrat. Forbes left Congress after being defeated in the 2000 Democratic primary election. He subsequently moved to Texas, where he became a Roman Catholic permanent deacon.  Early life and career Michael Patrick Forbes of Round Rock, Texas and Quogue, Long Island, was born on 16 July 1952 at Riverhead, Long Island, New York to Kenneth and Jane (n√©e Morrissey) Forbes. He is the grandson of Carrie Bowman, a Broadway actress, and T. Harold Forbes, an actor and song and dance man who became a well-known newspaper publisher in New Rochelle and Long Island, NY. Forbes graduated from the SUNY Albany, Saint Paul University and the University of Ottawa. He received an honorary Doctor of Law from Long Island University. Forbes got his start in politics as an assistant to New York State Assembly Speaker Perry B. Duryea, Jr.. He was a senior aide and close advisor to Republicans U.S. Sen. Al D'Amato and U.S. Rep. Connie Mack. In 1979, Forbes joined the George H.W. Bush campaign as a volunteer in New York and again, in 1987, campaigned statewide in Maine for Bush to succeed Ronald Reagan. President Bush appointed Forbes to a senior post at the United States Small Business Administration in 1989. He served four years, leaving in 1993 when the Clinton administration came into office. Forbes remains involved as a volunteer, board member, and committee member of the not-for-profit Camp Agawam, an alumni-owned summer camp in Raymond, Maine which he first attended in 1965.  Congress  In 1994, Forbes ran on three ballot lines for the House of Representatives: Republican, Conservative, and Right to Life. Campaigning as a fiscal conservative, he defeated incumbent George Hochbrueckner by six percentage points. Forbes got a seat on the powerful Appropriations committee, unusual for a freshman Representative, due to his ties with new House Speaker Newt Gingrich. In December 1996, after Gingrich was cited for gross campaign irregularities, Forbes became the first Republican to announce he was not going to vote for Gingrich for speaker. Forbes voted for moderate Republican Jim Leach instead. Despite his record of support for a number of President Bill Clinton's programs, Forbes voted to impeach Clinton in 1998. =Party switch= On July 17, 1999, Forbes switched to the Democratic Party after chastising national Republicans for being \\"tone deaf\\" to the needs of average Americans. While embraced nationally by President Bill Clinton, House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt, U.S Senators Ted Kennedy and Max Cleland and other Senate and House Democrats, New York's liberal Democrats (particularly chairwoman Judith Hope) refused to welcome Forbes into the Democratic Party because he would not change his long-held belief in prohibiting abortion. Activists in the Suffolk County Democratic Party recruited a 71-year-old librarian, Regina Seltzer, to challenge Forbes in the 2000 Democratic primary. Seltzer won a court ruling halting state Democratic Party ads for Forbes. =Lost primary= Seltzer won the 2000 primary election by 35 votes after national and state Republicans funneled $250,000 to the Seltzer effort. Seltzer was then defeated by Republican Felix Grucci in the November election. Grucci served a single term in Congress, being defeated in 2002 by Democrat Tim Bishop, who served until 2015. Career after Congress Forbes is married to Barbara Ann (Blackburn) Forbes and has four children and six grandchildren. In his post-Congress years, Forbes worked as a public relations executive, opening his own firm in 2001. His clients included defense industry contractors, financial services, Internet payment providers, non-profit children's home, and other small businesses seeking Federal appropriations. He has also blogged for the Huffington Post. In 2007, Forbes and his wife moved to Round Rock, Texas.Karl Grossman, From Congress to Catholic deacon: Mike Forbes reinvents himself, again, April 14, 2016). In 2008, he entered five years of formation and theological study to become a permanent deacon in the Roman Catholic Church. He was ordained clergy in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Austin by Bishop Joe S. V√°squez on April 13, 2013. He serves at Saint William Catholic Church in Round Rock. In 2016, Forbes earned both ecclesiastical and civil degrees in canon (Church) law (the iuris canonici licentiate (J.C.L.) and a Masters in Canon Law (M.C.L.) from Saint Paul University and the University of Ottawa, respectively. He is a full-time judge on the ecclesiastical court of the Diocese of Austin.

Rather than being included in the major canon of the Slavic belief system, the Likho is traditionally found in fairy tales. Story There are several basic versions of tales about how a person meets with Likho, with different morals of the tale. *A person eventually cheats Likho. *A person cheats Likho, runs away (with Likho chasing him), sees a valuable thing, grabs it out of greed, the person's hand sticks to it and they have to cut off their hand. *Likho cheats a person and rides on his neck. The person wants to drown Likho, jumps into a river, drowns himself, but Likho floats out, to chase other victims. *Likho is received or passed to another person with a gift. Within the framework of superstitions, Likho was supposed to come and eat a person. In particular, this was used to scare small children. In Ukrainian folklore, it is sometimes portrayed as type of a bad spirit that can cling to one's neck. Nomenclature Likho is not a real proper name, but a noun meaning bad luck in modern Russian and the odd number in Polish (obsolete). Several proverbs utilize this term such as the Russian \\"–ù–µ –±—É–¥–∏ –ª–∏—Ö–æ, –ø–æ–∫–∞ –æ–Ω–æ —Ç–∏—Ö–æ\\", meaning \\"Don't wake likho while it is quiet\\", \\"let the sleeping dogs lie\\" and the Polish \\"Cicho! Licho nie ≈õpi\\", translated as \\"Quiet! Evil does not sleep\\" and \\"Licho wie\\", literally \\"Licho [only] knows\\", used to mean that a given piece of information is known by no one. In old Russian, the root meant \\"excessive\\", \\"too much\\", \\"remaining\\" and \\"odd number\\" (contrasted with chetno in the chetno i likho game) with pejorative connotations, similar to the unlucky 'odd man out'. Compare to Russian lishniy ‚Äì one in excess. The word is likely to be related to Indo-European leikw meaning something to remain, to leave. The derived adjective likhoy can be used to describe someone who is a bit too daring or brave. In Czech, lich√Ω means odd (number), idle, vain. In Polish, lichy means shoddy, poor, flimsy.

The movement was introduced by the architect and urban planner Denise Scott Brown and architectural theorist Robert Venturi in their book Learning from Las Vegas. The style flourished from the 1980s through the 1990s, particularly in the work of Scott Brown & Venturi, Philip Johnson, Charles Moore and Michael Graves. In the late 1990s, it divided into a multitude of new tendencies, including high-tech architecture, neo-futurism and deconstructivism. Origins Postmodern architecture emerged in the 1960s as a reaction against the perceived shortcomings of modern architecture, particularly its rigid doctrines, its uniformity, its lack of ornament, and its habit of ignoring the history and culture of the cities where it appeared. In 1966, Venturi formalized the movement in his book, Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture. Venturi summarized the kind of architecture he wanted to see replace modernism: > I speak of a complex and contradictory architecture based on the richness > and ambiguity of modern experience, including that experience which is > inherent in art... I welcome the problems and exploit the uncertainties... I > like elements which are hybrid rather than \\"pure\\", compromising rather than > \\"clean\\", ...accommodating rather than excluding... I am for messy vitality > over obvious unity... I prefer \\"both-and\\" to \\"either-or\\", black and white, > and sometimes gray, to black or white... An architecture of complexity and > contradiction must embody the difficult unity of inclusion rather than the > easy unity of exclusion.Cited in review of Robert Venturi's \\"Complexities > and Contradiction in Architecture\\" by Martino Stierli, in Architectural > Review, 22 December 2016 In place of the functional doctrines of modernism, Venturi proposed giving primary emphasis to the fa√ßade, incorporating historical elements, a subtle use of unusual materials and historical allusions, and the use of fragmentation and modulations to make the building interesting. Venturi's wife, accomplished architect and urban planner Denise Scott Brown, and Venturi wrote Learning from Las Vegas (1972), co-authored with Steven Izenour, in which they further developed their joint argument against modernism. They urged architects to take into consideration and to celebrate the existing architecture in a place, rather than to try to impose a visionary utopia from their own fantasies. This was in line with Scott Brown‚Äôs belief that buildings should be built for people, and that architecture should listen to them. Scott Brown and Venturi argued that ornamental and decorative elements \\"accommodate existing needs for variety and communication\\". The book was instrumental in opening readers' eyes to new ways of thinking about buildings, as it drew from the entire history of architecture‚Äîboth high-style and vernacular, both historic and modern‚Äîand In response to Mies van der Rohe's famous maxim \\"Less is more\\", Venturi responded, to \\"Less is a bore.\\" Venturi cited the examples of his wife‚Äôs and his own buildings, Guild House, in Philadelphia, as examples of a new style that welcomed variety and historical references, without returning to academic revival of old styles. In Italy at about the same time, a similar revolt against strict modernism was being launched by the architect Aldo Rossi, who criticized the rebuilding of Italian cities and buildings destroyed during the war in the modernist style, which had had no relation to the architectural history, original street plans, or culture of the cities. Rossi insisted that cities be rebuilt in ways that preserved their historical fabric and local traditions. Similar ideas were and projects were put forward at the Venice Biennale in 1980. The call for a post-modern style was joined by Christian de Portzamparc in France and Ricardo Bofill in Spain, and in Japan by Arata Isozaki.

After studying at the American Academy in Rome, he worked in the offices of the modernists Eero Saarinen and Louis Kahn until 1958, and then became a professor of architecture at Yale University. One of his first buildings was the Guild House in Philadelphia, built between 1960 and 1963, and a house for his mother in Chestnut Hill, in Philadelphia. These two houses became symbols of the postmodern movement. He went on to design, in the 1960s and 1970s, a series of buildings which took into account both historic precedents, and the ideas and forms existing in the real life of the cities around them. =Michael Graves= File:The Portland Building.jpgPortland Building by Michael Graves (1982) File:HumanaBuilding1.jpgHumana Building in Louisville, Kentucky (1982) File:US-CO - Denver - Library (4891836173).jpgThe Denver Public Library by Michael Graves (1995) IFC Building.JPGIFC building in Washington, D.C.

He later followed up his landmark buildings by designing large, low-cost retail stores for chains such as Target and J.C. Penney in the United States, which had a major influence on the design of retail stores in city centers and shopping malls. In his early career, he, along with the Peter Eisenman, Charles Gwathmey, John Hejduk and Richard Meier, was considered one of the New York Five, a group of advocates of pure modern architecture, but in 1982 he turned toward postmodernism with the Portland Building, one of the first major structures in the style.

In 1935, he co-authored the famous catalog of the Museum of Modern Art exposition on the International Style, and studied with Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer at Harvard. His Glass House in New Canaan, Connecticut (1949), inspired by a similar house by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe became an icon of the modernist movement. He worked with Mies on another iconic modernist project, the Seagrams Building in New York City. However, in the 1950s, he began to include certain playful and mannerist forms into his buildings, such as the Synagogue of Port Chester (1954‚Äì1956), with a vaulted plaster ceiling and narrow colored windows, and the Art Gallery of the University of Nebraska (1963). However, his major buildings in the 1970, such as IDS Center in Minneapolis (1973) and Pennzoil Place in Houston (1970‚Äì1976), were massive, sober, and entirely modernist. With the AT&T; Building (now named 550 Madison Avenue) (1978‚Äì1982), Johnson turned dramatically toward postmodernism. The building's most prominent feature is a purely decorative top modeled after a piece of Chippendale furniture, and it has other more subtle references to historical architecture. His intention was to make the building stand out as a corporate symbol among the modernist skyscrapers around it in Manhattan, and he succeeded; it became the best-known of all postmodern buildings. Soon afterward he completed another postmodern project, PPG Place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (1979‚Äì1984), a complex of six glass buildings for the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company. These buildings have neo-gothic features, including 231 glass spires, the largest of which is high. In 1995, he constructed a postmodern gatehouse pavilion for his residence, Glass House. The gatehouse, called \\"Da Monstra\\", is 23 feet high, made of gunite, or concrete shot from a hose, colored gray and red. It is a piece of sculptural architecture with no right angles and very few straight lines, a predecessor of the sculptural contemporary architecture of the 21st century. =Frank Gehry= File:Gehry House - Image02.jpgGehry residence in Santa Monica (1978) File:Venice Beach House.jpgNorton Beach House, Venice, California (1983) File:Case danzanti.jpgDancing House in Prague (1996) File:Bilbao - Guggenheim aurore.jpgGuggenheim Bilbao, Bilbao, Spain (1997) Frank Gehry (born 1929) was a major figure in postmodernist architecture, and is one of the most prominent figures in contemporary architecture. After studying at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles and then the Harvard Graduate School of Design, he opened his own office in Los Angeles in 1962. Beginning in the 1970s, he began using prefabricated industrial materials to construct unusual forms on private houses in Los Angeles, including, in 1978, his own house in Santa Monica. He broke their traditional design giving them an unfinished and unstable look. His Schnabel House in Los Angeles (1986‚Äì1989) was broken into individual structures, with a different structure for every room. His Norton Residence in Venice, California (1983) built for a writer and former lifeguard, had a workroom modeled after a lifeguard tower overlooking the Santa Monica beach. In his early buildings, different parts of the buildings were often different bright colors. In the 1980s he began to receive major commissions, including the Loyola Law School (1978‚Äì1984), and the California Aerospace Museum (1982‚Äì1984), then international commissions in the Netherlands and Czech Republic. His \\"Dancing House\\" in Prague (1996), constructed with an undulating fa√ßade of plaques of concrete; parts of the walls were composed of glass, which revealed the concrete pillars underneath. His most prominent project was the Guggenheim Bilbao museum (1991‚Äì1997), clad in undulating skins of titanium, a material which until then was used mainly in building aircraft, which changed color depending upon the light. Gehry was often described as a proponent of deconstructivism, but he refused to accept that or any other label for his work. =C√©sar Pelli= File:200LibertyStreet.jpg200 Liberty Street, formerly One World Financial Center in New York City (1986) File:Two_World_Financial_Center.jpg225 Liberty Street, formerly Two World Financial Center in New York City (1987) File:3_World_Financial_Center.jpg200 Vesey Street, formerly Three World Financial Center, and American Express Tower, in New York City (1985) File:Four_World_Financial_Center.jpg250 Vesey Street, formerly Four World Financial Center in New York City (1986) File:Petronas_Panorama_II.jpgThe Petronas Towers, also known as Petronas Twin Towers, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (1996) File: London_MMB_S6_Canary_Wharf.jpgOne Canada Square in Canary Wharf, London, (1991) C√©sar Pelli (October 12, 1926 ‚Äì July 19, 2019) was an Argentine architect who designed some of the world's tallest buildings and other major urban landmarks.\\"Master of the Schuylkill ‚Äì Architect C√©sar Pelli\\".

In 1991 Robert Venturi completed the Sainsbury Wing of the National Gallery in London, which was modern but harmonized with the neoclassical architecture in and around Trafalgar Square. The German-born architect Helmut Jahn constructed the Messeturm skyscraper in Frankfurt, Germany, a skyscraper adorned with the pointed spire of a medieval tower. One of the early postmodernist architects in Europe was James Stirling (1926‚Äì1992). He was a first critic of modernist architecture, blaming modernism for the destruction of British cities in the years after World War II. He designed colorful public housing projects in the postmodern style, as well as the Neue Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart, Germany (1977‚Äì1983) and the Kammertheater in Stuttgart (1977‚Äì1982), as well as the Arthur M. Sackler Museum at Harvard University in the United States. One of the most visible examples of the postmodern style in Europe is the SIS Building in London by Terry Farrell (1994). The building, next to the Thames, is the headquarters of the British Secret Intelligence Service. In 1992, Deyan Sudjic described it in The Guardian as an \\"epitaph for the 'architecture of the eighties. ... It's a design which combines high seriousness in its classical composition with a possible unwitting sense of humour. The building could be interpreted equally plausibly as a Mayan temple or a piece of clanking art deco machinery'.The Guardian, London, June 19, 1992 The Italian architect Aldo Rossi (1931‚Äì1997) was known for his postmodern works in Europe, the Bonnefanten Museum in Maastricht, the Netherlands, completed in 1995. Rossi was the first Italian to win the most prestigious award in architecture, the Pritzker Prize, in 1990. He was noted for combining rigorous and pure forms with evocative and symbolic elements taken from classical architecture. The Spanish architect Ricardo Bofill is also known for his early postmodern works, including a residential complex in the form of a castle with red walls at Calp on the coast of Spain (1973). The works of Austrian architect Friedensreich Hundertwasser are occasionally considered a special expression of postmodern architecture.

Before opening his studio in Osaka in 1969, Ando traveled widely in North America, Africa and Europe, absorbing European and American styles, and had no formal architectural education, though he taught later at Yale University (1987), Columbia University (1988) and Harvard University (1990). Most of his buildings were constructed of raw concrete in cubic forms, but had wide openings which brought in light and views of the nature outside. Beginning in the 1990s, he began using wood as a building material, and introduced elements of traditional Japanese architecture, particularly in his design of the Museum of Wood Culture (1995). His Bennesse House in Naoshima, Kagama, has elements of classic Japanese architecture and a plan which subtly integrates the house into the natural landscape, He won the Pritzker Prize, the most prestigious award in architecture, in 1995. Isozaki Arata worked two years in the studio of Kenzo Tange, before opening his own firm in Tokyo in 1963. His Museum of Contemporary Art in Nagi artfully combined wood, stone and metal, and joined together three geometric forms, a cylinder, a half-cylinder and an extended block, to present three different artists in different settings. His Art Tower in Mito, Japan (1986-1990) featured a postmodernist Titanium and Stainless Steel tower that rotated upon its own axis. In addition to museums and cultural centers in Japan, he designed the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA), (1981‚Äì1986), and the COSI Columbus science museum and research center in Columbus, Ohio. Concert halls ‚Äì Sydney Opera House and the Berlin Philharmonic File:Opera House and ferry. Sydney.jpgThe Sydney Opera House by J√∏rn Utzon (1957‚Äì1973) File:Philharmonie 1a.jpgFacade of the Berliner Philharmonie by Hans Scharoun (1963) File:Berliner Philharmoniker.jpg\\"Vineyard Style\\"; The orchestra surrounded by the audience in the Berlin Philharmonic The Sydney Opera House in Sydney, Australia, by the Danish architect J√∏rn Utzon (1918‚Äì2008), is one of the most recognizable of all works of postwar architecture, and spans the transition from modernism to postmodernism. Construction began in 1957, but it was not completed until 1973 due to difficult engineering problems and growing costs. The giant shells of concrete soar over the platforms which form the roof of the hall itself. The architect resigned before the structure was completed, and the interior was designed largely after he left the project. The influence of the Sydney Opera House, can be seen in later concert halls with soaring roofs made of undulating stainless steel. One of the most influential buildings of the Postmodern period was the Berlin Philharmonic, designed by Hans Scharoun (1893‚Äì1972) and completed in 1963. The exterior, with its sloping roofs and glided fa√ßade, was a distinct break from the earlier, more austere modernist concert halls. The real revolution was inside, where Scharoun placed the orchestra in the center, with the audience seated on terraces around it. He described it this way: \\"The form given to the hall is inspired by a landscape; In the center is a valley, at the bottom of which is found the orchestra. Around it on all sides rise the terraces, like vineyards. Corresponding to an earthly landscape, the ceiling above appears like a sky.\\" Following his description, future concert halls, such as the Walt Disney Concert Hall by Frank Gehry in Los Angeles, and the Philharmonie de Paris of Jean Nouvel (2015) used the term \\"vineyard style\\" and placed the orchestra in the center, instead of on a stage at the end of the hall.

Wexner Center by Peter Eisenman (1989) File:Wdw- dolphin-hotel.jpgCamp. Hotel Dolphin by Michael Graves, Walt Disney World Florida (1987) =Complexity and contradiction= Postmodern architecture first emerged as a reaction against the doctrines of modern architecture, as expressed by modernist architects including Le Corbusier and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. In place of the modernist doctrines of simplicity as expressed by Mies in his famous \\"less is more;\\" and functionality, \\"form follows function\\" and the doctrine of Le Corbusier that \\"a house is a machine to live in,\\" postmodernism, in the words Robert Venturi, offered complexity and contradiction. Postmodern buildings had curved forms, decorative elements, asymmetry, bright colours, and features often borrowed from earlier periods. Colours and textures unrelated to the structure or function of the building. While rejecting the \\"puritanism\\" of modernism, it called for a return to ornament, and an accumulation of citations and collages borrowed from past styles. It borrowed freely from classical architecture, rococo, neoclassical architecture, the Viennese secession, the British arts and crafts movement, the German Jugendstil. Postmodern buildings often combined astonishing new forms and features with seemingly contradictory elements of classicism. James Stirling the architect of the Neue Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart, Germany (1984), described the style as \\"representation and abstraction, monumental and informal, traditional and high-tech.\\" =Fragmentation= Postmodern architecture often breaks large buildings into several different structures and forms, sometimes representing different functions of those parts of the building. With the use of different materials and styles, a single building can appear like a small town or village. An example is the Abteiberg Museum by Hans Hollein in M√∂nchengladbach (1972‚Äì1974). =Asymmetric and oblique forms= Asymmetric forms are one of the trademarks of postmodernism. In 1968, the French architect Claude Parent and philosopher Paul Virilio designed the church Saint-Bernadette-du-Banlay in Nevers, France, in the form of a massive block of concrete leaning to one side. Describing the form, they wrote: \\"a diagonal line on a white page can be a hill, or a mountain, or slope, an ascent, or a descent.\\" Parent's buildings were inspired in part by concrete German blockhouses he discovered on the French coast which had slid down the cliffs, but were perfectly intact, with leaning walls and sloping floors. Postmodernist compositions are rarely symmetric, balanced and orderly. Oblique buildings which tilt, lean, and seem about to fall over are common. =Colour= Colour is an important element in many postmodern buildings; to give the fa√ßades variety and personality, coloured glass is sometimes used, or ceramic tiles, or stone. The buildings of Mexican architect Luis Barragan offer bright sunlight colours that give life to the forms. =Humour and \\"camp\\"= Humour is a particular feature of many postmodern buildings, particularly in the United States. An example is the Binoculars Building in the Venice neighbourhood of Los Angeles, designed by Frank Gehry in collaboration with the sculptor Claes Oldenberg (1991‚Äì2001). The gateway of the building is in the form of an enormous pair of binoculars; cars enter the garage passing under the binoculars. \\"Camp\\" humor was popular during the postmodern period; it was an ironic humour based on the premise that something could appear so bad (such as a building that appeared about to collapse) that it was good. In 1964, American critic Susan Sontag defined camp as a style which put its accent on the texture, the surface, and style to the detriment of the content, which adored exaggeration, and things which were not what they seemed. Postmodern architecture sometimes used the same sense of theatricality, sense of the absurd and exaggeration of forms. The aims of Postmodernism, which include solving the problems of Modernism, communicating meanings with ambiguity, and sensitivity for the building's context, are surprisingly unified for a period of buildings designed by architects who largely never collaborated with each other. These aims do, however, leave room for diverse implementations as can be illustrated by the variety of buildings created during the movement. Theories of postmodern architecture The characteristics of postmodernism allow its aim to be expressed in diverse ways. These characteristics include the use of sculptural forms, ornaments, anthropomorphism and materials which perform trompe l'oeil. These physical characteristics are combined with conceptual characteristics of meaning. These characteristics of meaning include pluralism, double coding, flying buttresses and high ceilings, irony and paradox, and contextualism. The sculptural forms, not necessarily organic, were created with much ardor. These can be seen in Hans Hollein's Abteiberg Museum (1972‚Äì1982). The building is made up of several building units, all very different. Each building's forms are nothing like the conforming rigid ones of Modernism. These forms are sculptural and are somewhat playful. These forms are not reduced to an absolute minimum; they are built and shaped for their own sake. The building units all fit together in a very organic way, which enhances the effect of the forms. After many years of neglect, ornament returned. Frank Gehry's Venice Beach house, built in 1986, is littered with small ornamental details that would have been considered excessive and needless in Modernism. The Venice Beach House has an assembly of circular logs which exist mostly for decoration. The logs on top do have a minor purpose of holding up the window covers. However, the mere fact that they could have been replaced with a practically invisible nail, makes their exaggerated existence largely ornamental. The ornament in Michael Graves' Portland Municipal Services Building (\\"Portland Building\\") (1980) is even more prominent. The two obtruding triangular forms are largely ornamental. They exist for aesthetic or their own purpose. Postmodernism, with its sensitivity to the building's context, did not exclude the needs of humans from the building. Carlo Scarpa's Brion Cemetery (1970‚Äì1972) exemplifies this. The human requirements of a cemetery is that it possesses a solemn nature, yet it must not cause the visitor to become depressed. Scarpa's cemetery achieves the solemn mood with the dull gray colors of the walls and neatly defined forms, but the bright green grass prevents this from being too overwhelming. Postmodern buildings sometimes utilize trompe l'oeil, creating the illusion of space or depths where none actually exist, as has been done by painters since the Romans. The Portland Building (1980) has pillars represented on the side of the building that to some extent appear to be real, yet they are not. The Hood Museum of Art (1981‚Äì1983) has a typical symmetrical fa√ßade which was at the time prevalent throughout Postmodern Buildings. Robert Venturi's Vanna Venturi House (1962‚Äì1964) illustrates the Postmodernist aim of communicating a meaning and the characteristic of symbolism. The fa√ßade is, according to Venturi, a symbolic picture of a house, looking back to the 18th century. This is partly achieved through the use of symmetry and the arch over the entrance. Perhaps the best example of irony in Postmodern buildings is Charles Moore's Piazza d'Italia (1978). Moore quotes (architecturally) elements of Italian renaissance and Roman Antiquity. However, he does so with a twist. The irony comes when it is noted that the pillars are covered with steel. It is also paradoxical in the way he quotes Italian antiquity far away from the original in New Orleans.Heinrich Klotz, \\"The History of Postmodern Architecture\\", MIT Press, Cambridge Massachusetts, 1988 Double coding meant the buildings convey many meanings simultaneously. The Sony Building in New York does this very well. The building is a tall skyscraper which brings with it connotations of very modern technology. Yet, the top contradicts this. The top section conveys elements of classical antiquity. This double coding is a prevalent trait of Postmodernism. The characteristics of Postmodernism were rather unified given their diverse appearances. The most notable among their characteristics is their playfully extravagant forms and the humour of the meanings the buildings conveyed. Postmodern architecture as an international style ‚Äì the first examples of which are generally cited as being from the 1950s ‚Äì but did not become a movement until the late 1970s site moved to and continues to influence present-day architecture. Postmodernity in architecture is said to be heralded by the return of \\"wit, ornament and reference\\" to architecture in response to the formalism of the International Style of modernism. As with many cultural movements, some of Postmodernism's most pronounced and visible ideas can be seen in architecture. The functional and formalized shapes and spaces of the modernist style are replaced by diverse aesthetics: styles collide, form is adopted for its own sake, and new ways of viewing familiar styles and space abound. Perhaps most obviously, architects rediscovered past architectural ornament and forms which had been abstracted by the Modernist architects. Postmodern architecture has also been described as neo-eclectic, where reference and ornament have returned to the fa√ßade, replacing the aggressively unornamented modern styles. This eclecticism is often combined with the use of non-orthogonal angles and unusual surfaces, most famously in the State Gallery of Stuttgart by James Stirling and the Piazza d'Italia by Charles Moore. The Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh has also been cited as being of postmodern vogue. Modernist architects may regard postmodern buildings as vulgar, associated with a populist ethic, and sharing the design elements of shopping malls, cluttered with \\"gew-gaws\\". Postmodern architects may regard many modern buildings as soulless and bland, overly simplistic and abstract. This contrast was exemplified in the juxtaposition of the \\"whites\\" against the \\"grays,\\" in which the \\"whites\\" were seeking to continue (or revive) the modernist tradition of purism and clarity, while the \\"grays\\" were embracing a more multifaceted cultural vision, seen in Robert Venturi's statement rejecting the \\"black or white\\" world view of modernism in favor of \\"black and white and sometimes gray.\\" The divergence in opinions comes down to a difference in goals: modernism is rooted in minimal and true use of material as well as absence of ornament, while postmodernism is a rejection of strict rules set by the early modernists and seeks meaning and expression in the use of building techniques, forms, and stylistic references. One building form that typifies the explorations of Postmodernism is the traditional gable roof, in place of the iconic flat roof of modernism. Shedding water away from the center of the building, such a roof form always served a functional purpose in climates with rain and snow, and was a logical way to achieve larger spans with shorter structural members, but it was nevertheless relatively rare in Modernist buildings. However, Postmodernism's own modernist roots appear in some of the noteworthy examples of \\"reclaimed\\" roofs. For instance, Robert Venturi's Vanna Venturi House breaks the gable in the middle, denying the functionality of the form, and Philip Johnson's 1001 Fifth Avenue building in Manhattan advertises a mansard roof form as an obviously flat, false front. Another alternative to the flat roofs of modernism would exaggerate a traditional roof to call even more attention to it, as when Kallmann McKinnell & Wood's American Academy of Arts and Sciences in Cambridge, Massachusetts, layers three tiers of low hipped roof forms one above another for an emphatic statement of shelter. Relationship to previous styles San Antonio Public Library, Texas ruyi symbol adorning Taipei 101, Taiwan A new trend became evident in the last quarter of the 20th century as some architects started to turn away from modern functionalism which they viewed as boring, and which some of the public considered unwelcoming and even unpleasant. These architects turned toward the past, quoting past aspects of various buildings and melding them together (even sometimes in an inharmonious manner) to create a new means of designing buildings. A vivid example of this new approach was that Postmodernism saw the comeback of columns and other elements of premodern designs, sometimes adapting classical Greek and Roman examples. In Modernism, the traditional column (as a design feature) was treated as a cylindrical pipe form, replaced by other technological means such as cantilevers, or masked completely by curtain wall fa√ßades. The revival of the column was an aesthetic, rather than a technological necessity. Modernist high-rise buildings had become in most instances monolithic, rejecting the concept of a stack of varied design elements for a single vocabulary from ground level to the top, in the most extreme cases even using a constant \\"footprint\\" (with no tapering or \\"wedding cake\\" design), with the building sometimes even suggesting the possibility of a single metallic extrusion directly from the ground, mostly by eliminating visual horizontal elements‚Äîthis was seen most strictly in Minoru Yamasaki's World Trade Center buildings. Another return was that of the \\"wit, ornament and reference\\" seen in older buildings in terra cotta decorative fa√ßades and bronze or stainless steel embellishments of the Beaux-Arts and Art Deco periods. In Postmodern structures this was often achieved by placing contradictory quotes of previous building styles alongside each other, and even incorporating furniture stylistic references at a huge scale. Contextualism, a trend in thinking in the later parts of 20th century, influences the ideologies of the postmodern movement in general. Contextualism is centered on the belief that all knowledge is \\"context-sensitive\\". This idea was even taken further to say that knowledge cannot be understood without considering its context. While noteworthy examples of modern architecture responded both subtly and directly to their physical context, postmodern architecture often addressed the context in terms of the materials, forms and details of the buildings around it‚Äîthe cultural context. Roots of postmodernism 125 London Wall (1992) by Terry Farrell and Partners aimed to \\"repair the urban fabric\\" of the district, dominated by post-Blitz modernist schemes. The postmodernist movement is often seen (especially in the US) as an American movement, starting in America around the 1960s‚Äì1970s and then spreading to Europe and the rest of the world, to remain right through to the present. In 1966, however, the architectural historian Sir Nikolaus Pevsner spoke of a revived Expressionism as being \\"a new style, successor to my International Modern of the 1930s, a post-modern style\\", and included as examples Le Corbusier's work at Ronchamp and Chandigarh, Denys Lasdun at the Royal College of Physicians in London, Richard Sheppard at Churchill College, Cambridge, and James Stirling's and James Gowan's Leicester Engineering Building, as well as Philip Johnson's own guest house at New Canaan, Connecticut. Pevsner disapproved of these buildings for their self-expression and irrationalism, but he acknowledged them as \\"the legitimate style of the 1950s and 1960s\\" and defined their characteristics. The job of defining Postmodernism was subsequently taken over by a younger generation who welcomed rather than rejected what they saw happening and, in the case of Robert Venturi, contributed to it. The aims of postmodernism or late-modernism begin with its reaction to modernism; it tries to address the limitations of its predecessor. The list of aims is extended to include communicating ideas with the public often in a then humorous or witty way. Often, the communication is done by quoting extensively from past architectural styles, often many at once. In breaking away from modernism, it also strives to produce buildings that are sensitive to the context within which they are built. Postmodernism has its origins in the perceived failure of modern architecture. Its preoccupation with functionalism and economical building meant that ornaments were done away with and the buildings were cloaked in a stark rational appearance. Many felt the buildings failed to meet the human need for comfort both for body and for the eye, that modernism did not account for the desire for beauty. The problem worsened when some already monotonous apartment blocks degenerated into slums. In response, architects sought to reintroduce ornament, color, decoration and human scale to buildings. Form was no longer to be defined solely by its functional requirements or minimal appearance. Changing pedagogies Critics of the reductionism of modernism often noted the abandonment of the teaching of architectural history as a causal factor. The fact that a number of the major players in the shift away from modernism were trained at Princeton University's School of Architecture, where recourse to history continued to be a part of design training in the 1940s and 1950s, was significant. The increasing rise of interest in history had a profound impact on architectural education. History courses became more typical and regularized. With the demand for professors knowledgeable in the history of architecture, program were developed including the Advanced Masters-Level Course in the History and Theory of Architecture offered by Dalibor Vesely and Joseph Rykwert at the University of Essex in England between 1968 and 1978. It was the first of its kind. Other programs followed suit, including several PhD programs in schools of architecture that arose to differentiate themselves from art history PhD programs, where architectural historians had previously trained. In the US, MIT and Cornell were the first, created in the mid-1970s, followed by Columbia, Berkeley, and Princeton. Among the founders of new architectural history programs were Bruno Zevi at the Institute for the History of Architecture in Venice, Stanford Anderson and Henry Millon at MIT, Alexander Tzonis at the Architectural Association, Anthony Vidler at Princeton, Manfredo Tafuri at the University of Venice, Kenneth Frampton at Columbia University, and Werner Oechslin and Kurt Forster at ETH Z√ºrich.Mark Jarzombek, \\"The Disciplinary Dislocations of Architectural History,\\" Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians 58/3 (September 1999), p. 489. See also other articles in that issue by Eve Blau, Stanford Anderson, Alina Payne, Daniel Bluestone, Jeon-Louis Cohen and others. The creation of these programs was paralleled by the hiring, in the 1970s, of professionally trained historians by schools of architecture: Margaret Crawford (with a PhD from UCLA) at SCI-Arc; Elisabeth Grossman (PhD, Brown University) at Rhode Island School of Design; Christian OttoCornell University Dept. of Architecture website (PhD, Columbia University) at Cornell University; Richard Chafee (PhD, Courtauld Institute) at Roger Williams University; and Howard Burns (MA Kings College) at Harvard, to name just a few examples. A second generation of scholars then emerged that began to extend these efforts in the direction of what is now called \\"theory\\": K. Michael Hays (PhD, MIT) at Harvard, Mark Wigley (PhD, Auckland University) at Princeton (now at Columbia University), and Beatriz Colomina (PhD, School of Architecture, Barcelona) at Princeton; Mark Jarzombek (PhD MIT) at Cornell (now at MIT), Jennifer Bloomer (PhD, Georgia Tech) at Iowa State and Catherine Ingraham (PhD, Johns Hopkins) now at Pratt Institute. Postmodernism with its diversity possesses sensitivity to the building's context and history, and the client's requirements. The postmodernist architects often considered the general requirements of the urban buildings and their surroundings during the building's design. For example, in Frank Gehry's Venice Beach House, the neighboring houses have a similar bright flat color. This vernacular sensitivity is often evident, but other times the designs respond to more high-style neighbors. James Stirling's Arthur M. Sackler Museum at Harvard University features a rounded corner and striped brick patterning that relate to the form and decoration of the polychromatic Victorian Memorial Hall across the street, although in neither case is the element imitative or historicist. Subsequent movements Following the postmodern riposte against modernism, various trends in architecture established, though not necessarily following principles of postmodernism. Concurrently, the recent movements of New Urbanism and New Classical Architecture promote a sustainable approach toward construction, that appreciates and develops smart growth, architectural tradition and classical design.Charter of the New Urbanism This in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture, as well as leaning against solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl.Issue Brief: Smart-Growth: Building Livable Communities. American Institute of Architects. Retrieved on 2014-03-23. Both trends started in the 1980s. The Driehaus Architecture Prize is an award that recognizes efforts in New Urbanism and New Classical Architecture, and is endowed with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist Pritzker Prize. Some postmodern architects, such as Robert A. M. Stern and Albert, Righter, & Tittman, have moved from postmodern design to new interpretations of traditional architecture.

In this reaction insoluble calcium silicate hydrate and calcium aluminate hydrate compounds are formed possessing cementitious properties. The designation pozzolana is derived from one of the primary deposits of volcanic ash used by the Romans in Italy, at Pozzuoli. The modern definition of pozzolana encompasses any volcanic material (pumice or volcanic ash), predominantly composed of fine volcanic glass, that is used as a pozzolan. Note the difference with the term pozzolan, which exerts no bearing on the specific origin of the material, as opposed to pozzolana, which can only be used for pozzolans of volcanic origin, primarily composed of volcanic glass.  Historical use  Pozzolana from Mount Vesuvius volcano, Italy Pozzolanas such as Santorin earth were used in the Eastern Mediterranean since 500‚Äì400 BC. Although pioneered by the ancient Greeks, it was the Romans that eventually fully developed the potential of lime-pozzolan pastes as binder phase in Roman concrete used for buildings and underwater construction. Vitruvius speaks of four types of pozzolana: black, white, grey, and red, all of which can be found in the volcanic areas of Italy, such as Naples. Typically it was very thoroughly mixed two-to-one with lime just prior to mixing with water. The Roman port at Cosa was built of pozzolana-lime concrete that was poured under water, apparently using a long tube to carefully lay it up without allowing sea water to mix with it. The three piers are still visible today, with the underwater portions in generally excellent condition even after more than 2100 years.  Geochemistry and mineralogy  The major pozzolanically active component of volcanic pumices and ashes is a highly porous glass. The easily alterable, or highly reactive, nature of these ashes and pumices limits their occurrence largely to recently active volcanic areas. Most of the traditionally used natural pozzolans belong to this group, i.e., volcanic pumice from Pozzuoli, Santorin earth and the incoherent parts of German trass. The chemical composition of pozzolana is variable and reflects the regional type of volcanism. SiO2 being the major chemical component, most unaltered pumices and ashes fall in the intermediate (52‚Äì66 wt% SiO2) to acid (>66 wt% SiO2) composition range for glassy rock types outlined by the IUGS. Basic (45‚Äì52 wt% SiO2) and ultrabasic (<45 wt% SiO2) pyroclastics are less commonly used as pozzolans. Al2O3 is present in substantial amounts in most pozzolanas, Fe2O3 and MgO are present in minor proportions only, as is typical or more acid rock types. CaO and alkali contents are usually modest but can vary substantially from pozzolana to pozzolana. The mineralogical composition of unaltered pyroclastic rocks is mainly determined by the presence of phenocrysts and the chemical composition of the parent magma. The major component is volcanic glass typically present in quantities over 50 wt%. Pozzolana containing significantly less volcanic glass, such as a trachyandesite from Volvic (France) with only 25 wt% are less reactive. Apart from the glass content and its morphology associated with the specific surface area, also defects and the degree of strain in the glass appear to affect the pozzolanic activity. Typical associated minerals present as large phenocrysts are members of the plagioclase feldspar solid solution series. In pyroclastic rocks in which alkalis predominate over Ca, K-feldspar such as sanidine or albite Na-feldspar https://digitalfire.com/4sight/mineral/ceramic_mineral_na- feldspar_11.html are found. Leucite is present in the K-rich, silica-poor Latium pozzolanas. Quartz is usually present in minor quantities in acidic pozzolanas, while pyroxenes and/or olivine phenocrysts are often found in more basic materials. Xenocrysts or rock fragments incorporated during the violent eruptional and depositional events are also encountered. Zeolite, opal CT and clay minerals are often present in minor quantities as alteration products of the volcanic glass. While zeolitisation or formation of opal CT is in general beneficial for the pozzolanic activity, clay formation has adverse effects on the performance of lime-pozzolan blends or blended cements.  Modern use  Pozzolana is abundant in certain locations and is extensively used as an addition to Portland cement in countries such as Italy, Germany, Kenya, Turkey, China and Greece. Compared to industrial by-product pozzolans they are characterized by larger ranges in composition and a larger variability in physical properties. The application of pozzolana in Portland cement is mainly controlled by the local availability of suitable deposits and the competition with the accessible industrial by-product supplementary cementitious materials. In part due to the exhaustion of the latter sources and the extensive reserves of pozzolana available, partly because of the proven technical advantages of an intelligent use of pozzolana, their use is expected to be strongly expanded in the future. Pozzolanic reaction The pozzolanic reaction is the chemical reaction that occurs in portland cement containing pozzolans. It is the main reaction involved in the Roman concrete invented in Ancient Rome. At the basis of the pozzolanic reaction stands a simple acid- base reaction between calcium hydroxide (as Portlandite) and silicic acid.

She wrote books on modern Jewish history, in particular books on the Holocaust. Life Dawidowicz was born in New York City as Lucy Schildkret.Ware, Susan and Lorraine, Stacy. Notable American Women. 2004, pg. 154 Her parents, Max and Dora (n√©e Ofnaem) Schildkret, were secular-minded Jews with little interest in religion. Dawidowicz did not attend a service at a synagogue until 1938. Dawidowicz's first interests were poetry and literature. She attended Hunter College from 1932 to 1936 and obtained a B.A. in English. She went on to study for a M.A. at Columbia University, but abandoned her studies because of concerns over events in Europe. At the encouragement of her mentor, the historian Jacob Shatzky, Dawidowicz decided to focus on history, especially Jewish history. Dawidowicz made the decision to learn Yiddish, and at Shatzky's urging, she relocated to Wilno, Poland (present-day Vilnius, Lithuania) in 1938 to work at the Yiddish Scientific Institute (known by its Yiddish acronym as the YIVO). With the help of Shatzky she became a research fellow there. Dawidowicz lived in Wilno until August 1939 when she returned to the United States just weeks before the war broke out. During her time at the YIVO, she became close to three of the leading scholars there, namely Zelig Kalmanovich, Max Weinreich and Zalmen Reisen. Weinreich escaped the Holocaust because he went to New York to establish a branch of the YIVO there before World War II, but Kalmanovich and Reisen perished. Dawidowicz had been close to Kalmanovich and his family, whom she reportedly described as being her real parents. From 1940 until 1946, Dawidowicz worked as an assistant to a research director at the New York City office of the YIVO. During the war, like most Americans, she was aware of the Nazi persecution of the Jewish people in Europe, although it was not until after the war that she became aware of the full extent of the Holocaust. =Following World War II= In 1946, Dawidowicz traveled back to Europe, where she worked for the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee as an aid worker among the Jewish survivors in the Displaced Persons (DP) camps. She helped the survivors to re-create schools and libraries. Over a period of months in Frankfurt, she examined books that had been looted from Jewish institutions by the Nazis and identified those to be returned to the YIVO headquarters in New York, recovering in this way vast collections of books. In 1947, she returned to the U.S. and on January 3, 1948, she married a Polish Jew, Szymon Dawidowicz. Upon her return to the U.S. she worked as a researcher for the novelist John Hersey's book The Wall, a dramatization of the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. From 1948 until 1960, Dawidowicz worked as a historical researcher for the American Jewish Committee. During the same period, Dawidowicz wrote frequently for Commentary, the New York Times and the New York Times Book Review. An enthusiastic fan of the New York Mets, Dawidowicz lived the rest of her life in New York. In 1985, she founded the Fund for the Translation of Jewish Literature from Yiddish and Hebrew into English. A fierce anti-Communist, Dawidowicz campaigned for the right of Soviet Jews to emigrate to Israel. She died in New York City in 1990, aged 75, from undisclosed causes. Holocaust study and historiography Dawidowicz‚Äôs major interests were the Holocaust and Jewish history.Scanlon, Jennifer and Cosner, Shaaron. American Women Historians, 1700s-1990s. 1996, pg. 56 A passionate Zionist,Bosworth, R.J.B. Explaining Auschwitz and Hiroshima. 1994, pg. 89 Dawidowicz believed that had the Mandate for Palestine been implemented as intended, establishing the Jewish State of Israel before the Holocaust, \\"the terrible story of six million dead might have had another outcome\\".Rubinstein, W.D. The Myth of Rescue. 1999, pg. 215 Dawidowicz took an Intentionalist line on the origins of the Holocaust, contending that, beginning with the end of World War I on 11 November 1918, Hitler conceived his master plans, and everything he did from then on was directed toward the achievement of his goal,Kershaw, Sir Ian The Nazi Dictatorship. London: Edward Arnold. 2000, pg. 97 and that he had \\"openly espoused his program of annihilation\\" when he wrote Mein Kampf in 1924. Dawidowicz's conclusion was: \\"Through a maze of time, Hitler's decision of November 1918 led to Operation Barbarossa. There never had been any ideological deviation or wavering determination. In the end only the question of opportunity mattered.\\" In her view, the overwhelming majority of Germans subscribed to the v√∂lkische antisemitism from the 1870s onward, and it was this morbid antisemitism that attracted support for Hitler and the Nazis. Dawidowicz maintained that from the Middle Ages onward, German Christian society and culture were suffused with antisemitism and there was a direct link from medieval pogroms to the Nazi death camps of the 1940s. Citing Fritz Fischer, Dawidowicz argued that there were powerful lines of continuity in German history and there was a Sonderweg (Special Path), which inevitably led Germany to Nazism.Dawidowicz, Lucy The Holocaust and the Historians, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts: 1981, pgs. 63-65 Dawidowicz criticized what she considered to be revisionist historians as incorrect and/or sympathetic to the Nazis, as well as German historians who sought to minimize German complicity in the Nazi era attempt to annihilate Europe's Jews. For Dawidowicz, Nazism was the essence of total evil, and she wrote that the Nazi movement was the \\"... daemon let loose in society, Cain in corporate embodiment.\\"Dawidowicz, Lucy The Holocaust and Historians, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts: 1981, pgs. 20-1 Regarding foreign policy questions, she sharply disagreed with A.J.P. Taylor over his book The Origins of the Second World War. In even stronger terms, she condemned the American neo-Nazi historian David Hoggan for his book War Forced on Germany as well as David Irving's revisionist Hitler's War, which suggested Hitler was unaware of the Holocaust. In her view, historians who took a functionalist line on the origins of the Holocaust question were guilty of ignoring their responsibility to historical truth.Dawidowicz. The Holocaust and Historians, ibid., pg. 146 =Disputes with Arno Mayer= Dawidowicz was a leading critic of the American historian Arno J. Mayer's account of the Holocaust in his 1988 book Why Did the Heavens Not Darken? arguing that Mayer played up anti-communism at the expense of antisemitism as an explanation for the Holocaust.Dawidowicz, Lucy What Is the Use of Jewish History?, New York: Schocken Books, 1992, pgs. 123-4 Dawidowicz titled her review of Why Did the Heavens Not Darken? in the October 1989 edition of Commentary as \\"Perversions of the Holocaust\\".Dawidowicz. What Is the Use of Jewish History?, ibid., pg. vii Dawidowicz argued against Mayer that the historical evidence shows that Hitler was not convinced that the war was lost as early as December 1941 and that Mayer's theory is anachronistic.Dawidowicz. What Is the Use of Jewish History?, ibid., pgs. 127-8 Dawidowicz commented that the Einsatzgruppen had been massacring Jews since the beginning of Operation Barbarossa in June 1941 and that Mayer's claim that the Jews were only surrogate victims due to Germany's inability to defeat the Soviet Union was, in her opinion, rubbish.Dawidowicz, What Is the Use of Jewish History?, ibid., pg. 128 Dawidowicz attacked Mayer for saying that more Jews died at Auschwitz from disease than from mass gassing and for supporting Holocaust denial by writing that Holocaust survivor testimony was highly unreliable as a historical source.Dawidowicz. What Is the Use of Jewish History?, ibid., pgs. 129-30 Dawidowicz questioned Mayer's motives in listing the works of Arthur Butz and Paul Rassinier in his bibliography.Dawidowicz. What Is the Use of Jewish History?, ibid. pg. 130 Dawidowicz ended her review of Why Did the Heavens Not Darken? by accusing Mayer of excusing German racism, rationalizing the Nazi dictatorship, of portraying Soviet Jews as better off than they were under the Soviet dictatorship, and by presenting the Holocaust as due to reasonable political goals instead of, as she believed, being an ideological decision fueled by fanatical antisemitism.Dawidowicz. What Is the Use of Jewish History?, ibid., pgs. 131-2 =Other= She criticized the British historian Norman Davies, the author of God's Playground: A History of Poland, for \\"his virtuosity in erasing Polish antisemitism from the history books he writes\\" and for peppering some of his writing \\"with anti-Semitic tidbits.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/13/us/scholar-says-his-views-on-jews- cost-him-a-post-at-stanford.htmlDawidowicz, Lucy. \\"The Curious Case of Marek Edelman\\", pages 66-69 from Commentary, March 1987. Ronald Hilton, professor emeritus at Stanford University replied: \\"Davies is not anti-Semitic, his reputation for fairness is recognized internationally.\\" He also added: \\"People are frightened to speak up about this.\\" Davies \\"absolutely\\" denied being antisemitic. During the same period, Dawidowicz denounced the work of the philosopher Ernst Nolte, whom she accused of seeking to justify the Holocaust. In her The War Against the Jews 1933-1945 (1975), she writes that antisemitism has had a long history within Christianity.Dawidowicz, Lucy The War Against the Jews 1933-1945. Bantam: 1986, pg. 23; . In her opinion, the line of \\"anti- Semitic descent\\" from Martin Luther to Adolf Hitler was \\"easy to draw\\". She wrote that Hitler and Luther were both obsessed by the \\"demonologized universe\\" inhabited by Jews and that the similarities between Luther's anti- Jewish writings and modern antisemitism are no coincidence because they derived from a common history of Judenhass. =Criticism of Dawidowicz= Raul Hilberg criticized Dawidowicz for her work The War Against the Jews, stating that it builds \\"largely on secondary sources and conveying nothing whatever that could be called new,\\" and then going on to say in regards to Dawidowicz's portrayal of Jewish resistance and resisters that she included \\"soup ladlers and all others in the ghettos who staved off starvation and despair.\\" Hilberg suggests that \\"nostalgic Jewish readers [would find here] vaguely consoling words, [which] could be easily clutched by all those who did not wish to look deeper.\\" He then lists over 20 key authors on the subjects that Dawidowicz covers, that she did not use as references in her own work. Hilberg ends on the subject of Dawidowicz stating \\"To be sure, Dawidowicz has not been taken all that seriously by historians\\".The Politics of Memory: The Journey of a Holocaust Historian page 142 to 147 Books by Dawidowicz Her books include The War Against the Jews 1933-1945, her best-selling 1975 history of the Holocaust, and The Holocaust and the Historians, a study of Holocaust historiography. A collection of her essays relating to Jewish history, What Is the Use of Jewish History?, was published posthumously in 1992. Dawidowicz wrote The Golden Tradition: Jewish Life and Thought in Eastern Europe to document Jewish civilization in Eastern Europe before its destruction during the Holocaust. In On Equal Terms: Jews in America, 1881-1981, Dawidowicz wrote an account of Jews in the United States that reflected an appreciation for her American citizenship, which saved her from being a victim herself in the Holocaust.

It was created in 1940 as a joint initiative of the Headquarters of the Armia Krajowa and the Delegate's Office. It was a kind of shadow administration prepared for the moment of either liberation of Poland or the start of an all-national armed uprising. It was based on the Polish pre-war administrative division, composed of three grades (voivodeship-powiat-gmina), combined with the pre-war military division. In August 1943 the division of competences between the army and the civilian authorities was agreed. The organization of the Provisional Administration was later accepted by the President of Poland on April 26, 1944. In 1944 during Operation Tempest, as the sole representatives of the legitimate Polish government, the members of the Provisional Administration took power from the withdrawing German troops and welcomed the advancing Red Army . However, most of them were arrested by the NKVD and either sent to Russia for interrogation, sent to the GULag or killed on the spot. 1940 establishments in Poland Military history of Poland during World War II Poland in World War II ","title":"Provisional Administration"},{"id":"965030","text":"Neal B.

He worked previously as the President of NBC News and the executive producer for Dateline NBC. Prior to this Shapiro spent 13 years as a news producer at ABC News.  Early life Shapiro was born to a practicing Jewish familyJInsider: \\"November Top Jew Neal Shapiro Shalom TV (Jewish Journey)\\" retrieved March 29, 2020 and raised in Delmar, New York. He attended Bethlehem Central High School graduating in 1976. He went on to graduate magna cum laude from Tufts University in 1980, with degrees in history and political science. Career with ABC Shapiro worked with ABC News from 1980 until 1993, where he eventually became a producer for PrimeTime Live. He also produced for Nightline and spent time working in the Chicago news bureau. Career with NBC =Executive Producer of Dateline NBC= In 1993 he was named the executive producer of Dateline NBC, and worked to address the aftermath of a series of dismissals at NBC regarding a fake news story produced by the show. According to his alma mater, \\"Shapiro oversaw the production of several major breaking-news stories, such as the Oklahoma City bombing, the death of Princess Diana, the Columbine tragedy, the war in Kosovo, and the Clinton impeachment trial when he worked as the executive producer of the Emmy Award winning Dateline. He also served as the executive producer for several hour-long specials, including reports on corporate layoffs in America, migrant farm workers, and welfare reform.\\" In 1998 Shapiro took the show from one night to five nights per week, producing about 800 news stories per year. Upon the expansion of the program, Shapiro stated that the news magazines of each of the major American networks had each pushed the genre, and helped Dateline become a nightly primetime program. That year the New York Times said that, \\"Under Mr. Shapiro's guiding hand  and not always to the delight of media critics  Dateline has rewritten the rules of the news magazine show.\\" In a later article, the New York Times said of Shapiro's time at Dateline that he \\"presided over the expansion of that show to multiple nights, a trend that was later followed by newsmagazines at both ABC and CBS. Under Mr. Shapiro, \\"Dateline\\" won 25 Emmy Awards 19 Edward R. Murrow Awards, three Columbia-DuPont awards\\" and a Gerald Loeb Award. =President of NBC News= Shapiro was appointed the president of NBC News in June 2001, and was also put in charge of overseeing MSNBC.

TV News Check summarized some additional projects that Shapiro undertook, writing that, \\"He led the No. 1-rated news programs in every day part: Today in the morning, NBC Nightly News in the evening and Meet the Press on Sunday morning ... On cable, Shapiro oversaw the news operations of MSNBC and developed Countdown with Keith Olbermann and Scarborough Country with Joe Scarborough. He also created NBC News Productions which produces programming for many cable channels, including A&E;, Bravo, Court TV, Discovery, History, and Lifetime. In the world of syndication, he developed two successful syndicated programs produced by NBC News, The Chris Matthews Show and Your Total Health with Hoda Kotb. On the Web, Shapiro spearheaded a number of changes at MSNBC. He expanded NBC News Radio, and began podcasts and cell phone reports. He also helped create and launch NBC's digital weather channel, Weatherplus.\\" In all Shapiro won 32 Emmys, 31 Edward R. Murrow Awards, and 3 Columbia DuPont awards during his time at NBC (including those awarded during his time at Dateline). Career with WNET In January 2008 Shapiro was named CEO of WNET public television. According to Forbes magazine, one of his first moves was to start the programs \\"Sunday Arts, which features the great museum exhibits, films, galleries and performances going on in New York City, and ... Reel 13, which air[ed] on Saturday nights and pair[ed] a classic movie with an indie film and a short film created by [their] viewers\\". Shapiro created the news program Worldfocus as a public television owned news broadcast in lieu of the prior practice of airing foreign news programs on American public television, saying that, \\"it‚Äôs good for public television to have a show that belongs to public television ... Are we taking a chance? Absolutely; that‚Äôs what innovation is about.\\" The show ran from 2009 to 2010, receiving internal financing as well as funding from The Peter G. Peterson Foundation. He also oversaw the sale of the public television news coverage paper Current, a public media-focused trade publication, to the American University School of Communication, saying, according to the New York Times that \\"he found it odd for his organization to publish a paper\\" about its own industry. In 2011 Shapiro led the bid to manage New Jersey‚Äôs public television station that was then renamed NJTV, which brought New Jersey public television under the same umbrella. Other programs Shapiro commissioned include New York War Stories, New York Goes to War, Need to Know, and A Cry for Help: A Generation at Risk?, in addition to the expansion of the network's classic movie slots to include more recent independent pictures that appeal to a younger audience.

A financial comptroller is a senior-level executive who acts as the head of accounting, and oversees the preparation of financial reports, such as balance sheets and income statements. In most Commonwealth countries, the comptroller general, auditor general, or comptroller and auditor general is the external auditor of the budget execution of the government and of government-owned companies. Typically, the independent institution headed by the comptroller general is a member of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions. In American government, the comptroller is effectively the chief financial officer of a public body. In business management, the comptroller is closer to a chief audit executive, holding a senior role in internal audit functions. Generally, the title encompasses a variety of responsibilities, from overseeing accounting and monitoring internal controls to countersigning on expenses and commitments. Etymology The word is a variant of \\"controller\\". The \\"cont-\\" or \\"count-\\" part in that word was associated with \\"compt-\\", a variant of the verb \\"count\\". The term, though criticized by people like Henry Watson Fowler, is probably retained in part because in official titles it was deemed useful to have the title dissociated from the word and concept \\"control\\". A variant explanation is that comptroller evolved in the 15th century through a blend of the French compte (\\"an account\\") and the Middle English (someone who checks a copy of a scroll, from the French contreroule \\"counter-roll, scroll copy\\"), thus creating a title for a who specializes in checking financial ledgers.Etymology of comptroller at etymology online, etymonline.com. Accessed 2007-07-01.Etymology of comptroller at Merriam- Webster online, m-w.com. Accessed 2007-07-01. This etymology explains why the name is often pronounced identically to \\"controller\\" despite the distinct spelling. However, comptroller is sometimes pronounced phonetically by those unaware of the word's origins or who wish specifically to avoid confusion with \\"controller.\\" Business role A comptroller is a person in the business who oversees accounting and the implementation and monitoring of internal controls, independently from the chief financial officer (or CFO). In the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Israel and Canada, a comptroller or financial comptroller is a senior position, reporting to the CFO in companies that have one. In business, the title is typically spelled controller, with government organizations only using the spelling comptroller.
