During the Pacific War, she participated in the Battle of Wake Island in December 1941 and the occupations of New Guinea and the Solomon Islands in early 1942. Design and description The Mutsuki class was an improved version of the s and was the first with triple torpedo tubes. The ships had an overall length of Watts & Gordon, pp. 265–66 and were between perpendiculars. They had a beam of , and a mean draft of . The Mutsuki-class ships displaced at standard load and at deep load.Whitley, p. 191 They were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four Kampon water-tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce , which would propel the ships at . The ships carried of fuel oil which gave them a range of at . Their crew consisted of 150 officers and crewmen.Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 143 The main armament of the Mutsuki-class ships consisted of four Type 3 guns in single mounts; one gun forward of the superstructure, one between the two funnels and the last pair back to back atop the aft superstructure. The guns were numbered '1' to '4' from front to rear. The ships carried two above-water triple sets of 61-centimeter torpedo tubes; one mount was between the forward superstructure and the forward gun and the other was between the aft funnel and aft superstructure. Four reload torpedoes were provided for the tubes. They carried 18 depth charges and could also carry 16 mines. They could also fitted with minesweeping gear.Chesneau, p. 192 Construction and career Yayoi was laid down by the Uraga Dock Company at its shipyard in Uraga on 11 January 1924, launched on 11 July 1925 and completed on 28 August 1926. Originally commissioned simply as Destroyer No. 23, the vessel was assigned the name Yayoi on 1 August 1928. In the late 1930s, Yayoi participated in combat during the Second Sino-Japanese War and later in the Invasion of French Indochina in 1940. =Pacific War= At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, Yayoi was assigned to Destroyer Division 30 under Destroyer Squadron 6 of the 4th Fleet. She sortied from Kwajalein on 8 December as part of the Wake Island invasion force. This consisted of the light cruisers , , and , the destroyers Yayoi, , , , , and , two old vessels converted to patrol boats (Patrol Boat No. 32 and Patrol Boat No. 33), and two troop transports containing 450 Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces (SNLF) troops. The Japanese approached the island early on the morning of 11 December, and the warships began to bombard the island at a range of at 05:30. As none of the six American coast-defense guns replied, Rear Admiral Sadamichi Kajioka, commander of the invasion forces, ordered his ships to close the island, believing that the American guns had been destroyed by the earlier aerial attacks. Encouraging this, Major James Devereux, commander of the United States Marine garrison, had ordered his men to hold their fire until he gave the order to do so. After the Japanese ships had closed to a range of , he ordered his guns to open fire. They did so with great effect, sinking Hayate, near-missing Kajioka's flagship Yubari, and causing to him to order his forces to disengage.Wukovits, pp. 99–108 During this time, Yayoi was hit by a 5-inch shell, which killed one man and wounded 17 others. Yayoi returned on 23 December with the second (and ultimately successful) Wake Island invasion force before returning to Kwajalein. The ship escorted a convoy from Kwajalein to the naval base at Truk in January 1942, where a sponson was installed for a pair of license-built Type 93 anti-aircraft machineguns on the forward side of the bridge. Yayoi then escorted a troop convoy from Truk to Guam later that month, and then joined the invasion of the Solomon Islands, covering the landings of Japanese forces during Operation R (the invasion of Rabaul, New Ireland and New Britain), and during Operation SR (the invasion of Lae and Salamaua on New Guinea) in January–March. From 28 March to 1 April, she participated in the initial occupation of the Shortland Islands and Bougainville in the Solomon Islands. Later that month, the ship supported the occupation of the Admiralty Islands. During the Battle of the Coral Sea from 7–8 May 1942, Yayoi was assigned to the Operation Mo invasion force for Port Moresby. After that operation was cancelled, she returned to Japan in July for refitting at the Sasebo Naval Arsenal.Nevitt Yayoi under attack near New Guinea on 11 September 1942 After repairs were completed in mid-July Yayoi was reassigned to the IJN 8th Fleet and participated in the bombardment of Henderson Field on 24 August 1942.Morison. The Struggle for Guadalcanal During the Battle of the Eastern Solomons on 25 August 1942, Yayoi rescued survivors from her sister ship , which had been sunk in an attack by USAAF B-17 Flying Fortress bombers. At the end of August, Yayoi made a number of Tokyo Express troop transport runs to Milne, New Guinea. From early September, it began participating in Operation Ke, the evacuation of Japanese forces from Guadalcanal. On 11 September 1942, after departing Rabaul on an evacuation mission to Goodenough Island, Yayoi came under attack by Allied B-17 Flying Fortress and B-25 Mitchell bombers, northwest of Vakuta Island at coordinates . The attack also killed the commander of Destroyer Division 30, Captain Shiro Yasutake. Taking on water uncontrollably, Yayois captain, Lieutenant Commander Shizuka Kajimoto, gave the decision to abandon ship. The destroyers and later rescued 83 survivors from nearby Normanby Island. Yayoi was struck from the Navy List on 20 October 1942.

Paint it Black is set in Los Angeles, California during the 1980s punk rock scene. There are references to artists and events of that era, such as the Germs (with emphasis on their lead singer Darby Crash) and the death of John Lennon, along with insights into the art world that surrounds the protagonist, Josie. The book was first published in 2006. Background Janet Fitch's third novel was originally planned to be a lengthy historical novel. But after her publisher contacted her regarding the manuscript, Fitch was told that the project would most likely not be fulfilled. She was given approval to finish Paint It Black after her agent read about one hundred pages of the handwritten manuscript. Fitch originally considered this work a side project. Reaction Some fans were unhappy with the final result, one reviewer saying, \\"If you enjoyed White Oleander, as I did, and expect more of the same in Paint It Black, you’ll be disappointed.\\": Nights and Weekends review by Maryann Boulter. Another was quoted as saying, \\"How Paint It Black holds up for readers under the scrutiny of comparison remains to be seen, but Fitch's fans should know that while the plot is very different, her new book returns to many of the same settings and themes she introduced in White Oleander, this time exploring them in an even deeper way.\\" San Diego Union Tribune review by Debra Ginsberg. Karen Valby, of Entertainment Weekly, is quoted in her review as saying, \\"The two lash at each other's jugulars, their shared misery both a balm and a repellent. Would that Fitch had left the little punk to her vodka and speed, and zeroed in on the wicked older woman.\\" Entertainment Weekly review by Karen Valby Fitch herself, in an Amazon.com blog dated December 4, 2007, said, \\"Paint It Black started as a gothic little short story, which became the emotional core of the book, like a secret windowless room at the heart of a haunted mansion. Then I built outwards from that room, into the outer life of the book, until I finally got the beginning, and then the ending, which is the doorway out, into the sun.\\" Amazon.com Blog post by Janet Fitch.

GameSpot Review of Star Rangers Storyline Players take on the role of a Star Ranger, the equivalent of law enforcement in the 23rd century, a pilot of a high-tech spaceship which he uses to repel Tuareg bandits along shared borders. Gameplay The game starts in a practice mode in which the player continually faces waves of enemies until death. This is an 'arcade' option of the game, which doesn't explore the storyline. The game offers a campaign mode which comprises a group of missions in which these encounters escalate. These missions evolve from incursion defense, to escort duty, to outright assaults. Players are provided only the Star Ranger spaceship throughout the campaign, but are offered a fair amount of customization of loadout and tuning. The player can divert energy to defenses (shield recharge) and offense (plasma gun recharge, autocannon reload). These levels can be adjusted for maximum performance or efficiency, energy being consumed faster in the former than in the latter. Players acquire a wider variety of missiles for their arsenal as they progress, from 'sharpsticks' to torpedoes. Strategy evolves from the mapping system built-in, where pilots can travel across a certain area of space. Enemies can attack multiple targets including friendly bases and sensor buoys. Buoys contain map information and so when destroyed or not present act as a rudimentary fog of war. The player has the option, at expense of energy, to warp and near-instantaneously travel across the map to attack, defend, or refuel at a friendly base. Development The developers designed the game to allow players to select their next mission in an open-ended format. Producer Michael Chen explained, \\"We were trying to make a break from the genre that tells you where you have to be and when.\\" References  External links  * 1995 video games Space flight simulator games DOS games DOS-only games Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Star Rangers (video game)"},{"id":"21174627","text":"Morgan House is a historic home located at Bloomington, Monroe County, Indiana.

Brooke debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 14 July 2008. The role was written with Allen in mind to play her. Brooke arrived as a locum GP but later advanced in her career. She is played as a manipulative female, who uses her sexuality to advance in her career. She is also characterised by her complex backstory which has resulted in her \\"messed up\\" persona. As a stylish female, Allen is required to spend longer in the dressing room with make-up artists. Brooke's style has been attributed to Katharine Hepburn, though she wears dark colours to convey her personality. Brooke has been described as \\"doctor- hunting\\" for her many relationships with colleagues. Two of her notable relationships include a failed romance with Ethan Pierce (Owen Black) - which almost led her to suicide. The other with TK Samuels (Benjamin Mitchell), who exposed her vulnerable side. With this stylist Nicola Newman began dressing Brooke is lighter colours to convey the change. Other storylines include coping with her alcoholic mother and making a serious medical error. Brooke has been positively received by critics, favouring her deceitful nature and calling her the serial's \\"token bitch\\". Allen has been nominated for a \\"New Idea People's Choice Award\\" at the 2010 Qantas Television Awards. Character development =Characterisation= Brooke was created with actress Beth Allen in mind to play her. When she auditioned for the role, Allen did not anticipate that Brooke would be such a \\"vixen\\". She had always aspired to work on Shortland Street and also found Brooke's complexity an appealing factor upon taking the role. Career wise, Brooke likes to create the impression that she is a competent, confident and ambitious woman. TVNZ describe her as \\"a study in fire and ice.\\" As she is ambitious, she finds general practice as a chore rather than her job. She is also described as often struggling to maintain her \\"professional façade\\" through general work. Brooke's persona has been characterised through her flirty, two-faced nature and she often manipulates her way through situations. Allen said Brooke uses her sexuality to get what she wants. Allen tried to understand Brooke because of her complex backstory, but admitted that when she watched her on-screen Brooke comes across as not a very nice person. Allen explained that Brooke is \\"quite messed up\\" because of stuff in her background that she has running away from. She also said Brooke get into \\"wrong situations or has friends who don't serve what she really wants.\\" Allen has applauded Brooke for having more \\"depth\\" to her than previous roles she has played. She added \\"She has enough depth that she does have room to move as a character.\\" Brooke is stylised as a fashionable female. Her early style was based on Katharine Hepburn's classy image. She has often been played with full make up and straight hair. Allen revealed it took more than one hour each day for the make up department to create Brooke's look. Due to Allen's thick-curly hair being hard to maintain, she had to have chemical treatment to straighten it. This was also used to keep continuity with Brooke's appearance. Described as \\"ultra-fashion- conscious\\", Brooke has usually dressed in tight silky blouses, high-waisted skirts and high heels. The skirts have made full movement for Allen difficult. A \\"classic Brooke look\\" is a black fitted dress, worn with a belt and gold jewellery and heels. Brooke's colour scheme was made up of very dark tones such as black, grey and gold. The serial's stylist Nicola Newman revealed that when Brooke showed her \\"vulnerable side\\", she implemented lighter colours to convey the change. =Storyline development= When Brooke first arrives she tried to romance Chris Warner (Michael Galvin). Allen thought it was \\"hilarious\\" that she got to chase \\"doctor love\\" around. One of Brooke's first relationships was with Ethan Pierce (Owen Black). Black told The Sunday Star- Times that he had a good working relationship with Allen, which helped them successfully perform many \\"big pashing scenes.\\" When Black was written out of the serial, his character Ethan was forced to run away. Brooke pleaded to run away with him, but Ethan prevented her from leaving with him. Black said that Brooke was always \\"the one\\" for Ethan. He concluded that Ethan just wanted to protect her as \\"he sees the wolf closing in on him and he was just getting out.\\" After Ethan was murdered, Brooke found out she did not know his true self. Brooke was distraught and purposely walked into a road filled with busy traffic. Allen said she sympathised with the way Brooke felt because the situation is easy to relate to. She added that because Brooke trusted Ethan and he let her down, she is left \\"questioning her whole view on the world.\\" Brooke makes an enemy in Ethan's girlfriend Alice Piper (Toni Potter) and they later have a cat fight. The scenes were described as \\"impromptu and embarrassing for both girls.\\" Allen and Potter had fun filming the scenes which involved much hair-pulling and slapping. Brooke later starts a relationship with TK Samuels (Benjamin Mitchell). Brooke played her vulnerable side to appeal to TK's morality. Allen revealed that Brooke does not \\"stay all that grounded about the relationship\\" and she that she became uncertain about her position as his girlfriend. She added that there was an element of \\"craziness\\" to the storyline. Brooke \\"proved too needy\\" for TK, so he ended their romance. In one storyline Brooke becomes too focused on running the Primary Care Clinic, that she put a patients life elsewhere at risk. Allen said Brooke's \\"standard of care and precision has slipped.\\" The scenes played out when she incorrectly prescribed Barry Knox (Richard Green) with the wrong drugs, he developed serotonin syndrome. Sarah Potts (Amanda Billing) confronted Brooke over her negligence and she realised she needed to cover her tracks. Allen explained that Brooke was \\"surprised and embarrassed\\" to realise she made a medical error. Brooke cared about the patient, but she cared for her career more so. Adding that Brooke knew she had to remain quiet and carry out \\"damage control\\". However Barry was not satisfied with her care and acted unpredictable. Brooke \\"comprehends the magnitude of her error\\" upon seeing his behaviour and told him the truth. Allen is an ambassador for a gynaecological cancer charity. She convinced a producer to explore the disease through her character. The storyline is played out when Brooke discovers she has ovarian cysts. Allen said she liked to think it was \\"making a difference\\" because it was an illness \\"that no-one talks about.\\" Brooke was later forced to cope with the arrival of her alcoholic mother Annette, with Louise Wallace being cast in the role. Producers later introduced Winston Youn (Min Kim) as her \\"devoted and meticulous\\" research assistant. When Kim auditioned for the role, producers were \\"blown away by his portrayal of the admiration the character felt towards Brooke.\\" In October, Brooke and polar opposite Vinnie Kruse (Pua Magasiva) develop a relationship. It was announced in November 2011 that a new addition to Brooke's family would be arriving. In December, actress Rachel Blampied arrived to the soap as Brooke's illegitimate half sister, Bree. Blampied enjoyed acting alongside Allen and Magasiva stating; \\"I've had some great scenes with Beth and Pua, which have been enormous fun as they're such generous actors and are heaps of fun to hang out with!\\" Storylines Brooke arrives at Shortland Street as a locum GP and instantly attracts a male attention from Kip Denton (Will Hall) and Chris. Ethan arrives to work at the hospital as a surgeon and they start an affair. Tania Jeffries (Faye Smythe) and Tracey Morrison (Sarah Thomson) take a disliking to Brooke as they think she is playing mind games with Kip and Chris. Brooke dates Chris to help Ethan gain a promotion. Their relationship soon ends. The Ferndale newspaper publish an article about Brooke, revealing that her father, Grant scammed millions of dollars from people. Brooke tells a lie to Chris, in order land Harry in trouble. TK suspects that Brooke is not a qualified doctor, as he disapproves of her work ethic. This leads to animosity between the pair. Brooke becomes tired of Shortland Street. When Ethan announces his departure, she pleads to move with him. However, Ethan is shot dead. Brooke is the main suspect in his killing. Brooke is then charged, until nurse Maia Jeffries (Anna Jullienne) is discovered to be the killer. Brooke starts dating Kieran Mitchell (Adam Rickitt). Kieran starts a false clinic up to scam Brooke's father (Alan Lovell) out of thousands, whilst Brooke is promoted to HOD, which in turn annoys TK. Brooke has TK moved to ED and begins taking more shifts at her own plastic surgery clinic. Though the clinic is forced to close when business does not come in. After ending her relationship with Kieran, she starts a relationship with hospital CEO Callum McKay (Peter Mochrie). She uses him to help herself advance in her career. Callum's wife Justine Jones (Lucy Wigmore) returns and he is unable to choose between the two. Justine realises the attraction between them and allows Callum to move on. Brooke is shot by hitman Don Lennox (Chris Easley), after he mistakes her for Justine and she survives the attack. Brooke gives romantic advice to Callums daughter Sophie McKay (Kimberley Crossman) about Kieran, this has a negative effect on her own relationship. Brooke faces hardship when Callum ends their relationship after he realises her manipulative ways. Hospital auditor, Rachel McKenna (Angela Bloomfield) then fires her. On her return Brooke clashes with ED doctor Maxwell Avia (Robbie Magasiva) which leads to a potential romance. The romance never gets off the ground and he makes her homeless from their shared apartment. Brooke is surprised when TK acts as her support network, Brooke falls in love with TK. She sets out to destroy his marriage to Sarah. She manages to cause problems that lead them to separate. Though TK initially fends off Brooke's romantic advances - he sleeps with Brooke when he realises Sarah has moved on. He later gives her a chance and she attempts to make him love her. She gives food to homeless people, as she thinks good deeds will make her look good. Brooke realises TK still loves Sarah so she attempts to fall pregnant by him. She makes holes in condoms - but it backfires when Loren Fitzpatrick (Sophia Johnson), becomes pregnant instead. When Brooke becomes too needy, TK breaks up with her. She then strikes up a friendship with Gerald Tippett (Harry McNaughton). Brooke's alcoholic mother Annette Freeman arrives in Ferndale - which upsets Brooke. Brooke is shocked when she has a cancer scare and her mother runs away out of fear. Brooke later starts dating Isaac Worthington (Matt Minto) and the two begin to plot against others. Brooke helps Isaac get Luke Durville (Gerald Urquhart) fired and in return Isaac helps Brooke steal research from Lars Hammett (Sean O'Connor), who has sex with Brooke and then dies. Brooke later dumps Isaac and she starts to work in research, achieving recognition and respect in her field. Winston becomes her assistant, but she is left disturbed by his stalker tendencies. He helps her bond with her mother and the two soon become good friends. Brooke is scared by the presence of Larz's wife Nadia Hammett (Jessi Williams). Nadia soon learns the secret and is found dead. Brooke fears Winston killed her but after starting a relationship with old flame Alex Murphy (Bede Skinner) and purposely mowing down Winston in her car, she learns Winston was only trying to protect Brooke and is innocent. In December 2011, Brooke meets her half- sister Bree Hamilton. Refusing to get to know her, Bree continued to try to get to know Brooke. Brooke's mother Annette Freeman returns, Bree assaults her mother after she told her that she was an unwanted mistake. Bree threw Annette down the stairs and crushed her foot in the door, all without Brooke knowing. Brooke kicks Annette out for accusing her of being insane. Anonymous to Bree taking off to Chicago with her name and passport, Brooke meets Bree's boyfriend and he is confused of the real Brooke. When Brooke tells Bree of the news she has learnt, Bree yells at Brooke telling her that her name is not Bree, but Brooke. Brooke tries to call for help, but Bree throws her phone under a couch. As Brooke bends over to get the phone, Bree attacks her and hits her over the head with an ornament. Brooke wakes up the next day in a small space (presumed to be a wardrobe), fearing for her life. Later on she is saved by Vinnie and Sarah, who successfully get information out of Bree, who was still referring to herself as 'Brooke'. Once in the hospital, Brooke comes to know more about Bree's motives and then makes the painful choice to refer her sister to a psychiatric unit. She had visited Bree but it was cut short and she was told to keep away from her, causing Brooke to feel guilty that she is unable to support her one and only sibling. Brooke later marries wealthy doctor Boyd Rolleston in an attempt to free him of ties to his horrific family. At first Brooke only considered Boyd because of his money and manipulated him into taking her to his family estate, but now has formed a somewhat normal relationship with him. Boyd was later stripped of all his money, yet Brooke stood by him. Maybe after all this time Brooke has finally changed and found 'the one'. Later, Brooke was discovered to have advanced renal failure and was needed a donor for a kidney transplant. She required the aid of a dialysis machine three times a week. However, Brooke knew that Boyd's career was much more important than her being his sick wife. Brooke split up with Boyd and decided to end the contract possibly because she did not want Boyd to suffer as she is dying. Brooke needs a kidney transplant and her sister, Bree comes back to Shortland Street as she may be the only person to donate the kidney to her. When Bree gets scared about having an operation she gets advice from Josh Gallager. Josh then murders Dayna Jenkins' injured mother to harvest a kidney for Brooke. On the last episode of 2013, Brooke has a successful operation. Brooke was devastated when Boyd cheated on her with Ava Erickson. The two decided to break up. After the death of her close friend Sarah Potts in August 2014, Brooke worked on a project in her honour, but in September, Brooke decided that she was better off leaving Shortland Street after-all. Brooke leaves for Washington. Reception For her portrayal, Allen was nominated in category of \\"New Idea People's Choice Award\\" at the 2010 Qantas Television Awards, but did not win. Sarah Lang of The New Zealand Herald said Brooke was the serial's \\"latest vixen\\" who had been putting her \\"pins to good use\\". She branded her a \\"doctor-hunting, enigmatic, eye-catching locum\\" because she mind games with Chris and Kip. She concluded by describing her as \\"an intriguing mass of contradictions, is assertive yet vulnerable, kind-hearted yet manipulative, gregarious yet aloof - so while we haven't much warmed to her, we don't hate her yet either.\\" Lang's Herald colleague Zoe Walker said Brooke is Shortland Street's \\"token bitch\\" with a liking for \\"tailored jackets, pencil skirts and plunging necklines.\\" Whilst Nicola Russel of the Sunday News similarly branded Brooke as the serial's \\"resident bitch.\\" The Sunday Star-Times said \\"Brooke's angelic looks hide a ruthless personality she won't hesitate to lie her way out of sticky situations.\\" They also said \\"everywhere she goes, men follow, like wafts of cheap perfume.\\" They ultimately rated her a seven out of ten in their \\"Bad girl\\" feature. Many of Allen's co stars listed Brooke as the soap's best villain, noting the character's ability to manipulate whilst also empathise with the audience.

He has questioned suspected terrorists, been a handler of informants in the U.S., and testified in both federal court and Guantanamo military commission trials. September 11 attacks The 9/11 Commission Report stated that in late August 2001, Fuller was given a lead on Khalid al-Mihdhar, who was one of the hijackers in the September 11 attacks. Fuller was instructed to open an intelligence case and attempt to find al- Mihdhar in the U.S. within the next 30 days. It was Fuller's first counterterrorism lead. He checked New York databases and the New York hotel listed on al-Mihdhar's U.S. entry visa. When nothing showed up, Fuller sent a lead to the FBI office in Los Angeles on September 11, because al-Mihdhar had originally entered the U.S. at Los Angeles International Airport in January 2000. HTML HTML A Department of Justice Office of Inspector General (OIG) report from November 2004, which was publicly released in 2006, provides a more detailed examination of Fuller's actions during his investigation. The FBI New York Field Office opened a full field intelligence investigation to locate al-Mihdhar on August 29, 2001. Fuller was given the assignment on August 30, without any particular priority, and another investigation kept him from starting until September 4. Fuller first filled out lookout request forms for the INS and U.S. Customs Service on al-Mihdhar. By September 5, Fuller had requested New York City criminal history, NCIC criminal history, credit and motor vehicle checks on al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, who was mentioned as an associate in the initial lead on al-Mihdhar. Fuller stated to the OIG that he conducted a ChoicePoint search on both men. However, the FBI located records on al-Hazmi in that database soon after September 11, 2001. Released Publicly June 2006. Fuller is referred to as \\"Richard\\" in this report. The OIG report did not fault Fuller for his efforts on the investigation. Rather, it stated the New York Field Office should have assigned the search more priority and resources. Released Publicly June 2006 Informant's self-immolation On November 15, 2004, an informant Fuller had been working with since November 2001, Mohamed Alanssi, set himself on fire in front of the White House. Alanssi had earlier sent a note to Fuller explaining his action: Guantanamo military commissions testimony In 2008, Fuller testified in the Guantanamo military commission trial of Salim Hamdan. Fuller stated that it was not FBI policy at the time to give a Miranda warning about self-incrimination to terrorism suspects. \\"A source can be a suspect as well,\\" Fuller testified. In March 2002, Hamdan, who had been detained in Kandahar for four months at that time, led FBI agents including Fuller on a tour of three compounds in Afghanistan owned by Osama bin Laden. In 2009, Fuller testified in the military commission trial of Omar Khadr. Fuller recounted that he interrogated Khadr at Bagram Airbase on October 7, 2002, three months after Khadr was captured. Fuller's report of the interview, written right after it, was introduced as evidence in the trial. The report stated that Khadr took several minutes to identify Maher Arar from a photograph. It also stated that Khadr thought he saw Arar at a Kabul, Afghanistan safe house in September and October 2001. The day after the interrogation, October 8, 2002, Arar, who had been in detention at J.F.K. airport for the past 12 days, was extraordinarily rendered to Syria. 2009 Bronx terrorism plot Fuller was the FBI handler of the informant Shahed Hussain, Timeline: The Making of an FBI Superinformant - By Trevor Aaronson Mother Jones September/October 2011 who conspired with James Cromitie to attempt an attack on two synagogues in the Bronx in 2009. Officially, the FBI authorized Hussain to offer US$5,000 to each man participating in the plot but how much money they believed they were doing it for remains unclear. Cromitie, along with three other defendants, was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Fuller testified at the trial that the informant, Shahed Hussain, made twelve trips to a mosque in Newburgh, New York, \\"to attempt to interact with other individuals in other F.B.I. counterterrorism operations,\\" and to keep his ear open for \\"radical Islamic thoughts.\\" Hussain was paid $44,000 for expenses and $53,000 for his services over a three-year period. Fuller repeatedly told Hussain to encourage Cromitie to buy an illegal gun. An email Fuller wrote suggested the reason he kept suggesting this was to have a criminal charge versus Cromitie \\"in our back pocket if things went south.\\" A different email from Fuller to officials at Stewart Airport, another potential target of the plot, stated that Cromitie would be casing the airport but that he posed no danger without help from Hussain. On June 29, 2011, US District Judge Colleen McMahon sentenced Cromitie to 25 years in prison but pointed out that the FBI played a key role in the situation. She says: \\"It created acts of terrorism out of his fantasies of bravado and bigotry, and then made those fantasies come true.\\" And added: \\"Only the government could have made a terrorist out of Mr. Cromitie, whose buffoonery is positively Shakespearean in scope.\\" Shahed Hussain became an much used FBI informant after his work with Fuller in this case.

It is located about northeast of the town of Jõhvi, on the coast of Narva Bay (part of the Gulf of Finland). Toila is known as an important sea resort in Estonia, with a spa hotel, beach and a beautiful park (Oru Park). Toila is the administrative centre of Toila Parish. As of the 2011 Census, the settlement's population was 780, of whom the ethnic Estonians made up 628 (80.5%). History The existence of an ancient settlement in Toila is suggested by a sacred grove (hiis) on a high coastal cliff, offering springs along the Pühajõgi River, and an offering stone in Oru Park. The oldest tarand grave found in Virumaa is located beside the current Toila cemetery. The burials there took place in two periods: 2nd–4th and 7th–8th centuries AD. The first written record about the Toila area, in the Danish Census Book, mentions neighbouring Pühajõe as a tiny hamlet with a size of 6 hides. In 1426, the neighbouring Kärilõpe village (now Altküla) was first mentioned. In 1547, the site of modern Toila was mentioned as Männiku, where a knightly manor was situated. During the Great Northern War, Russian cavalry general Boris Sheremetev built reduits around Pühajõgi, to hinder Charles XII in approaching the Battle of Narva. Toila as a summer resort was discovered in the middle of the 19th century. The first tens of summer cottages were erected in the 1870s. In the second half of the century, a harbour was built in the estuary of the Pühajõgi River. Among locals, it became known as the \\"King's Jetty\\" (Kuninga muul). In 1914, the number of vacationers exceeded a thousand, while the number of residents was around 500. After World War I, the number of vacationers from Russia drastically decreased and Toila was used by only several hundred vacationers, mostly Estonian intellectuals. At the end of the 19th century, Russian merchant Grigory Yeliseyev (who owned a store on the Nevsky Prospekt in St Petersburg) bought land for his new summer residence in Toila. A palace in the Italian renaissance style designed by Gavriil Baranovsky and a large park by Georg Kuphaldt were established. After being expropriated from its Russian owner, from 1934 to 1940, the palace, known as Oru Palace, was used as the summer residence of the first Estonian president, Konstantin Päts. The palace was destroyed in the Second World War.

The House of Nassau would become one of the reigning families in Germany, from which are descended through females the present-day royals of the Netherlands and Luxembourg, while officially belonging to this House. Biography Laurenburg Castle Dudo was probably a son of Rupert (German: Ruprecht), the Archbishop of Mainz’s Vogt in Siegerland. Dudo is mentioned as Tuto de Lurinburg between 1093 and 1117. In a charter dated 1134 (after his death) he is mentioned as Count of Laurenburg. Dudo was lord or Vogt of Lipporn and Miehlen and owned large parts of the lands of Lipporn/Laurenburg. There are more persons known who, as owners of the lands of Lipporn/Laurenburg (and thus the predecessors of Dudo), probably also were his ancestors. The first is a certain Drutwin mentioned in 881 as a landowner in Prüm, and who is the oldest known possible ancestor of the House of Nassau. Dudo built the castle of Laurenburg around 1090. In 1117, Dudo donated land to Schaffhausen Abbey for construction of a monastery in Lipporn. This monastery, built under Dudo's son Rupert I in 1126, was the Benedictine Schönau Abbey. From 1141 until her death in 1164, the abbey would be the home of St. Elizabeth of Schönau. In 1122, Dudo received the castle of Idstein in the Taunus as a fief under the Archbishopric of Mainz. This was part of the inheritance of Count Udalrich of Idstein-Eppstein. He also received the Vogtship of the richly endowed Benedictine Bleidenstadt Abbey (in present-day Taunusstein).Reuling.

He sat in the House of Commons from 1846 to 1857 for East Sussex, and thereafter suffered a series of electoral defeats as he unsuccessfully challenged the political power of the Duke of Rutland in North Leicestershire.  Early life  Frewen was the second son of John Frewen-Turner (1755–1829) of Cold Overton Hall in Leicestershire, who had been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Athlone from 1807 to 1812. His mother was Frewen-Turner's second wife Elizabeth, the heir and only daughter of David Hay from Hopes in Haddingtonshire. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and became a large landowner in both Leicestershire and Sussex. Frewen was a magistrate for Leicestershire, Sussex and Kent, and for three other counties. He was High Sheriff of Leicestershire in 1866, a post previously held by his father in 1791.  Political career  Frewen first stood for Parliament at a by- election in March 1839 for Leicester, but was unsuccessful. At the 1841 general election he contested Rye, again without success,Craig, p. 260. but he was elected as an MP for East Sussex at a by-election in February 1846 after the resignation of George Darby, who had been appointed as a Commissioner of Enclosures.Craig, p. 470. Frewen had been reluctant to stand, and when first approached by Darby as a possible protectionist candidate he had offered to donate £500 towards the expenses of another protectionist who would contest the seat. No other candidate came forward, and at the hustings in Lewes Frewen was elected unopposed on 4 February. He was re-elected for East Sussex in 1847 and 1852, and held the seat until his resignation on 17 February 1857 through appointment as Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds. He had resigned to contest a by-election in North Leicestershire, where his campaign was based on what The Times newspaper called his \\"extreme Protestant notions\\". Although he also raised issues of taxation, his main campaign focus was religion, and his agents' rallying cry was \\"no Popery!\\" He opposed the Maynooth Grant of financial assistance for St Patrick's College, a Roman Catholic seminary at Maynooth in Ireland, and distributed more than 20,000 handbills in one week to explain his views. However, the canvassing returns showed that he had little support, and that voters preferred the High Church stance of Lord John Manners, son of the locally powerful Duke of Rutland. In one district where Frewen had expected strong report, the returns showed 319 supporters of Lord John, but only 14 for Frewen; and in the Melton Mowbray district, canvassers identified no-one prepared to vote for Frewen. His agents, who included both Conservatives and Radicals, abandoned the campaign in mid-February when they realised that they could secure less than 200 votes in the whole county, and Manners was elected unopposed.Craig, pp. 415–416. He did contest North Leicestershire at the general election in April 1857, when he did not win either of the two seats. When Lord John sought re-election in March 1858 after his appointment as First Commissioner of Works, Frewen planned to stand again. He promptly issued an election address, which was published in the local newspapers, but his friends advised him not to proceed with the campaign. He appeared at the hustings on 8 March to explain his withdrawal, and was congratulated by Manners for avoiding \\"what, in Parliamentary language, would have been a frivolous and vexatious opposition\\". In a letter published in The Times on 12 March, Frewen struck back, claiming that Manners \\"would not have the least chance of being returned for any other county in the whole kingdom besides North Leicestershire\\", because his return had been secured only by \\"the great territorial influence that has been exerted in his behalf\\". Frewen claimed that land agents for the Duke of Rutland had been sent to \\"coerce whole villages\\", telling tenants farmers to vote for Manners, and that the farmers had obeyed rather than risk eviction. He contended that the 25 counties which had been divided under the Reform Act should have been allocated four seats as one constituency, rather than being split into a pair of two-seat divisions, and that if the two-halves of Leicestershire were combined in one constituency, then no single landowner could dominate the county's elections in this way. He stood again in North Leicestershire at the general elections in 1859, 1865 and 1868, but without success. At the 1865 election, polling had to be postponed in Ashby-de-la-Zouch when a group of colliers who supported Frewen rioted on 25 July, throwing stones at voters and overturning the carriages of Frewen's opponents. Sixty police officers attended, but despite breaking many heads they were unable to restore order, and the gates of the market hall were closed to further voters. A further 100 police arrived the next day, but polling was stopped after four people voted, since it was agreed that Frewen could not win and continued polling would only provoke his supporters further. The delay caused by the riots meant that the North Leicestershire was the last constituency in England county to declare a result in the election. At the 1868 election he styled himself not as a Conservative, but as an \\"Independent Conservative\\", opposed as before to the Duke of Rutland's power in the constituency. Polling was again disrupted by riots, this time at Shepshed in the north of the county. Polling was taking place in the village's Roman Catholic schoolroom, and Frewen's supporters realised that he was losing, and tried to stop his opponents from voting. Police tried to protect voters, but were driven back into the schoolhouse, where rioters broke all the windows and threw stones at those inside, as well as trying unsuccessfully to seize the polling books. Police reinforcements were sent from Loughborough, but were confronted en route by rioters who stopped the police carriage and attacked the officers with cudgels. The rioters dispersed when a second contingent of police arrived, and voting resumed the following day.  Family  In 1856 he married Frances Brisco, the daughter of Henry Woodgate from Pembury near Tunbridge Wells, and widow of Musgrave Brisco MP.

In federalism a nation has a dual government system i.e. federal government at central level and at state level. The federal government has the power to enlarge diplomatic territorial integrity, run a national project, make national monetary policy and so on. The state government has the power to make federal laws, maintain law and order in the state. Nepal is a country with geographical diversity. Nepal has been practicing unitary form of government since unification by, Prithvi Narayan Shah. However, this system was not able to achieve the development goals of the country and has been an \\"exclusive form of rule.\\" Federalism is seen as an in inclusive practice for Nepal. So, with the view of proportional development in all the parts of the country by appropriate distribution and mobilization of resources and reducing the economic, social and religious discrimination, the country has transformed into a federal structure. Nepal has become a federal democratic republican state since 15th Jestha, 2065 BS. According to the concept of a federal system, Nepal has been divided into 7 provinces, 77 districts and 753 local levels. Now each province has a separate government along with its federal government at the centre.  History  In the aftermath of the 2007 People's Revolt II, the 240 years of monarchy was abolished in the 5th amendment of the Interim Constitution of Nepal, 2063. The amendment was the first document to mention Nepal officially as the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal. It envisioned federalism as a prominent feature for a new Nepal. The Maoist party was the catalyst for bringing forth federalism and inclusion. Other major parties that supported the move include the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) and the Nepali Congress, whereas the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, which was only able to enter the parliament under the Proportional Representation scheme, has come out in opposition to the prospect of federalism as well bringing back the monarchy and declaring Nepal as a Hindu nation. Nepal had been practicing a unitary form of the government under the Shah rulers (Prithivi Narayan Shah).

The statue celebrated the city's stand against the apartheid system in South Africa at the time of the imprisonment of Nelson Mandela and fighting in Soweto township. Anne Ross Davidson, DA (3 February 1937 in Glasgow – 20 December 2008 in Aberdeen) was a Scottish sculptor and artist. Many of her commissioned works are on public view in Scotland and abroad. Early years Anne Ross was educated at the Convent of the Sacred Heart School, Aberdeen. She went on to study sculpture at Gray's School of Art, Aberdeen (1955–59), graduating top of her class with a DA (sculpture). After training as an art teacher, she worked as the principal teacher of art (1960–68) at Gray's School of Art, her alma mater. She would go on to work as a full-time sculptor. She returned to Gray's to lecture there on sculpture (1978–82). African Woman and Child Her sculpture African Woman and Child was commissioned by the Edinburgh City Council to symbolise the ANC's stand against apartheid. The sculpture depicts a black woman standing with a young child in front of the suggestion of a shantytown. It was unveiled on 22 July 1986 by a then-exiled member of the African National Congress, Suganya Chetty, who was then living in Edinburgh. Secular works Her sculpture of Robert the Bruce, commissioned by Aberdeen City Council, and on display in Aberdeen Town House, shows the heroic Scottish king in 14th-century armour carrying his shield and sword. Davidson used textured materials in the creation of the original models to produce the accurate decorative effects seen in the final casts. Other secular pieces include a figure of a Gordon Highlander officer for the Alick Buchanan-Smith Award, a statue of Mary, Queen of Scots and a series of ballet figures. The oil industry, the Royal Mail, William Grant and Sons Ltd., Glenfiddich Distillery and Aberdeen City Council were among other organisations and individuals who commissioned Anne Ross Davidson to model gifts and awards for them. Religious works In 1993, Mario Conti, then Bishop of Aberdeen, commissioned Davidson to create a small figure of St Margaret of Scotland to celebrate the 900th anniversary of the saint. Margaret had married King Malcolm III in the 11th century and the sculpture represents Margaret holding an open book and gently leading a small girl by the hand. In 2003, during an audience with Pope John Paul II, Tony Blair, then UK Prime Minister, presented him with one of the 500 statues of St Margaret that Anne Davidson had designed. Other important religious commissions she created were: * Relief sculptures in St Mary's R.C. Cathedral, Aberdeen * External reliefs for the Church of St Paschal Baylon, Liverpool * The Madonna and Child and St Columba statues in the St Columba Church complex, Aberdeen. * St Paul the Apostle Church, Glasgow (her final large commission, completed in July 2008) Later years Between 1985 and 1998, she and her husband ran a popular sculpture workshop for the blind, funded by Aberdeen City Council. She taught art to children at schools throughout Aberdeenshire. She was still teaching at three primary schools until she was incapacitated by illness in September 2008. She died three months later, aged 71\\\\. Family Anne Davidson was survived by her husband, Jimmy Davidson (a noted Scottish sculptor & calligrapher), their four children and four grandchildren.

Early life He was born in Philadelphia, United States, the second son of Alexander Baring and Ann Louisa, the daughter and coheiress of the wealthy William Bingham of Blackpoint, Philadelphia, a US Senator. He was the younger brother of Bingham Baring. Francis was educated privately and at Geneva and in 1817 joined Baring Brothers, the family bank. After successfully travelling on business to North America and the West Indies he was made a quarter share partner in the bank in 1823. However, after unfortunate financial speculations in Mexican land and in the French sugar market, he was demoted to a non-executive director in 1828 and in 1830 was given his brother's Parliamentary seat for Thetford. Political career He was elected at the 1830 general election as a Whig Member of Parliament (MP) for the borough of Thetford in Norfolk, and held the seat until the 1831 election, which he did not contest. He was re-elected in 1832 as a Tory, and held the seat as a Conservative until the 1841 general election, which he did not contest. According to the Legacies of British Slave-Ownership at the University College London, Baring was awarded a payment as a slave trader in the aftermath of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 with the Slave Compensation Act 1837. The British Government took out a £15 million loan (worth £ in ) with interest from Nathan Mayer Rothschild and Moses Montefiore which was subsequently paid off by the British taxpayers (ending in 2015). Baring was associated with eight different claims, he owned 1079 slaves in British Guiana and received a substantial payment. Retrieved on 20 March 2019. He was returned again for Thetford at a by-election in August 1848, and held the seat until his resignation through appointment as Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds on 30 November 1857.

It is dedicated to laying out a printed circuit board (PCB). The current version is 6.3.17875 as of 2017-09-20. It features a powerful autorouter and a set of tools intended to reduce the amount of effort needed for manual routing of a PCB. The most recognizable feature of TopoR is the absence of preferred routing directions, which results in unusual looking PCBs.  History  Printed circuit board sample Work on a flexible topological router began in 1988, when 1996 saw the release of the first version of a topological router that actually came to be used by industrial enterprises. In 2002, the FreeStyle Router (FSR) by Диал Инжиниринг (\\"Dial Engineering\\") ran under DOS and successfully routed dual-layer boards, interfacing with P-CAD. This early router showed the advantages of an innovative approach to routing and high efficiency of the models, algorithms, and software implementation. A 1.44 MB floppy disk was enough for the program and accompanying examples. The company also announced plans to commercially release a FreeStyle Suite for Windows later the year. The last version of FSR for DOS, consisting of the router named SpeedWay and the layout editor named FreeStyle was version 1.6 as of 2003-09-26/2003-11-01. The first Windows version of the topological router was released in 2001 and renamed to TopoR. TopoR 1.03 was available on 2003-09-26 and distributed through ElekTrade (ЭлекТрейд). The program routed not only dual-layer but also multi-layer printed circuit boards. TopoR was developed by a group called the FreeStyleTeam, supervised by Sergey J. Luzin (Юрьевич Сергей Лузин), with Oleg B. Polubasov (Олег Борисович Полубасов) as initial FSR developer, as well as Paul I. Dmitriev (Павел Иванович Дмитриев), Gevorg S. Petrosyan (Геворг Самвелович Петросян), Michael S. Luzin (Михаил Сергеевич Лузин) and Andrew A. Lysenko (Андрей Александрович Лысенко). Version 3.0 was released in 2006. The software was commercially distributed by Prosoft Spb. (ПРОСОФТ СПб) in 2007. TopoR 4.0 added support to import/export DSN design and SES session files. Since TopoR 4.1 (2008) the software is further developed and maintained by Eremex, Ltd.  Features  TopoR can be used as an external autorouter for third-party layout editors or in conjunction with Eremex's own schematic capture and layout editor Delta Design (DD). TopoR imports input in Delta Design's FST format, as Specctra-/ELECTRA-compatible DSN design files, or in P-CAD PCB ASCII (2000, 2002, 2004), PADS PCB ASCII (3.5, 4.0, 5.0, 2005.0), or EAGLE BRD XML formats (6.x). The resulting boards can be exported into Specctra/ELECTRA SES session files, DXF, Gerber, P-CAD PCB ASCII (2000, 2002, 2004), PADS PCB ASCII (3.5, 4.0, 5.0, 2005.0). Wires consisting of lines only Wires consisting of lines and arcs Routing of the wiring topology is done automatically and flexibly; angles are not limited to 90° and 45°. Efficient use of PCB space and absence of preferred routing directions in layers considerably reduces electromagnetic crosstalk. TopoR routes all connections, even if this entails violating design constraints. Such violations can be automatically corrected later. When objects (such as components and vias) are moved around, wire length and shape are optimized automatically with appropriate clearance. The user is free to choose from two ways to calculate the wire shape: with or without arcs. The first method involves wires consisting of lines only. The other makes wires keep appropriate clearance when circling around pads; it consists of arcs and lines. TopoR simultaneously optimizes several alternative variants of the layout. Variants with the worst parameters (per total wire length and number of vias) will be removed. TopoR has an automatic component placement feature. The procedure can be used both for all components of the board and only for components in a specific area. It is not comparable to the quality of the manual placement, but it can be used as a preparation step for manual placement. The minimum and desired clearances for each net can be specified. Reduced wire width TopoR automatically supports trace necking, that is, it reduces the width of a wire that approaches a narrow pad (or one with a diameter that is less than the width of the wire), or when it passes through bottlenecks (for example, between the pads of a component). Wire-to-pad transitions use teardrop-style smoothing. The use of this procedure at the design stage helps avoid violations in design-rule checking when teardrops are added in the CAM editor. BGA component routing TopoR can recognize ball grid array (BGA) component areas and apply a special strategy for routing them. This helps reduce the number of vias, the density of connections, and in some cases the number of routing layers. Single-layer printed circuit board sample A special algorithm is used for routing single- layer boards minimizing the number of interlayer junctions or to find a single-layer routing.  Similar solutions  The layout program PCB of the gEDA suite includes a similar topological autorouter named Toporouter, which was written by Anthony Blake in a Google-funded open source project mentored by DJ Delorie in 2008.

At present, the Centre is a vibrant and busy place with long-running programs, educational activities, art studio, and classes in Jewish dance. The YCC Study Workshop on Jewish History and Culture, is an initiative that began in 1995 as the first of its kind in Poland.

He was capped five times for Wales and was notable for leading an ill-advised response to the New Zealand Haka during the team's 1924 tour.A Neath warning for Warren Neath RFC website Rugby career Hiddlestone was born in Hendy, Carmarthenshire, where he played his early rugby with local club, Hendy RFC. After the end of World War I he joined Llanelli a first class team within Welsh club rugby. He left Llanelli under poor circumstances, some sources stating that Hiddlestone was considered \\"too dirty\\" for the club,Not only Neath may be cast into outer darkness The Independent 18-12-2001 though at the time of leaving the club he was the present team captain, a position elected by the club members. Whatever the reason for his leaving Llanelli, Hiddlestone was accepted to play for Neath. In 1922 he was first selected to represent Wales as part of the Home Nations Championship in a game against England. The Welsh team he joined had many new caps, including Swansea's Islwyn Evans and Frank Palmer, Bridgend's Bobby Delahay and William Cummins from Treorchy. Led by Tom Parker, Wales overran the English team, scoring a record eight tries against England; Hiddlestone himself not only scored one of the tries, but is also credited as being the central linchpin in the Welsh attack that won the game so comfortably.Smith (1980), pg 205. Hiddlestone played in all three of the remaining matches of the 1922 tournament, which saw Wales win the championship. The team beat Ireland and France, and it was only a draw with Scotland that prevented the team taking the Grand Slam title. Hiddlestone was replaced in the 1923 Championship by Gwilym Michael, but at the end of the 1924 season he was reselected for the Welsh team to face the touring New Zealanders. Although not selected as captain of the Welsh team, Hiddlestone decided to lead the team in a response to the All Black's Haka, similar to Teddy Morgan leading the national anthem in 1905. Hiddlestone chose to lead the Welsh team in a responsive \\"War-dance\\", which was seen as offensive and mocking towards the New Zealand team. During the game the Wales captain, Jack Wetter, took a heavy blow from George Nepia and was forced to play the end of the game, out of position, in the pack. Hiddlestone was pushed out as an extra-back to cover his captain. New Zealand outclassed the Welsh team, winning 19-0, and Hiddlestone never represented Wales again. Although out of favour with Wales, Hiddlestone was given the captaincy of Neath over the 1924/25 season. After his retirement from playing rugby, Hiddlestone became a rugby referee and officiated the joint Aberavon / Neath team when they faced the 1935 New Zealand tourists.Aberavon Wizards website =International matches played= WalesSmith (1980), pg 466. * 1922 * 1922 * 1922 * 1922 * 1924 Bibliography   References 1890 births 1973 deaths Welsh rugby union players Rugby union flankers Llanelli RFC players Neath RFC players Welsh rugby union referees Wales international rugby union players ","title":"Dai Hiddlestone"},{"id":"21175066","text":"Cost of Conflict is a tool which attempts to calculate the price of conflict to the human race. The idea is to examine this cost, not only in terms of the deaths and casualties and the economic costs borne by the people involved, but also the social, developmental, environmental and strategic costs of conflict. In most cases organizations measure and analyze the economic and broader development costs of conflict. While this conventional method of assessing the impact of conflict is fairly in-depth, it does not provide a comprehensive overview of a country or region embroiled in conflict. One of the earliest studies assessing the true cost of conflict on a variety of parameters was commissioned by Saferworld and compiled by Michael Cranna.Cranna, Michael (1994). The True Cost of Conflict. Earthscan Publication Strategic Foresight Group has taken this science to a new level by developing a multi-disciplinary methodology, that has been applied to most parts of the world. A key benefit of using this tool is to encourage people to look at conflict in new ways and to widen public discussion of the subject, and to bring new insights to the debate on global security. In today's world the cost of conflict tool and analysis can also be used to alert voters to the consequences of their governments' current positions,; these voters can be within the same country for example in the case of India, in countries within the same region as in the case of the Middle East, or Western voters whose nations are involved in conflicts abroad. While the study of conflict is not new, the use of 'Cost of Conflict' as a comprehensive tool is relatively new. While engaging in such a study it is also important to identify what is meant by 'costs', and to differentiate between measurable costs that have a bearing on resources, and costs that have a bearing on living conditions. Methodology The cost of conflict methodology takes into account different costs a conflict generates, including economic, military, environmental, social and political costs. The approach considers direct costs of conflict, for instance human deaths, expenditure, destruction of land and physical infrastructure; as well as indirect costs that impact a society, for instance migration, humiliation, growth of extremism and lack of civil society. The approach also examines the neighboring countries involved and assesses the impact on them as well as on the international community. Some studies are measured on a thematic basis, a recent example of which is the war on terror – though in this case most of the studies are done by the United States and examines the costs borne specifically by them. These studies follow a similar pattern. A brief introduction sets the conflict in context and defines the period of the conflict being studied, as is the pattern followed by Michael Cranna in his book. The study is based on extensive research, inputs from experts within the conflict region and collaboration with policy experts. As in the case of the collection by Cranna and a report on the Middle East by Strategic Foresight Group, these studies began with workshops involving organizations, governments and intellectuals which proved important in setting the priorities and direction of the studies. Such endeavors hold no weight without the input from experts of various fields from the conflict region under consideration. Each study also serves as an analytical tool and assesses past, present and future costs of conflicts using a wide range of parameters. In most cases there is little attempt by these studies to analyze the causes of these conflicts as they would have been previously documented, and do not serve the purpose of the tool of measuring the cost of conflict. With the use of such a tool and methodology, the question arises as to why researchers, intellectuals, and organizations might look at the cost of conflict, as opposed to discussing the benefits of peace. While it is important for people to benefit from peace and reconciliation through trade, cultural exchange and cooperation, it is much more crucial for them to understand and unravel the incentive structure of conflict and rid themselves of cost. Thus the use of 'cost of conflict' as a new and evolving tool to mobilize public opinion, broaden debate and examine new avenues for peace becomes extremely crucial. Limitations Researchers and analysts engaged in using this tool acknowledge that it is highly ambitious to identify the price of war, and there are limitations to assessing the total cost of any conflict. Conflict is not the only cause of impoverishment, diseases and other ills suffered by mankind; as Paul Collier deduces in his study of Africa, economics proved to be a major cause of conflict. What the cost of conflict tool serves to demonstrate is the impact of conflict above these and other natural factors, and how it has sometimes exacerbated them. In some cases it is difficult to find contemporary data, or attribute costs to a specific period when, for example in the case of Kashmir, where fighting has been going on at different levels of intensity for a long time. In such cases it could prove useful to have a significant year or episode in history as a benchmark for calculations. For example, the 'Cost of Conflict in the Middle East' report by Strategic Foresight Group, uses 1991 as a basis and explains how they believe that the Madrid Conference provided a historic opportunity for peace. The study by David Shave on the Peru Conflict uses 1980, or the first year of Sendero activity, as the starting point. Comprehensive Cost of Conflict Reports =The True Cost of Conflict= The True Cost of Conflict is a compilation, edited by Michael Cranna from Saferworld in 1994. It comprises studies on the costs of 7 different conflicts. The costs entail the effects of conflict on health, education, civil and political rights, trade, power supply and transportation amongst others. In the case of the Internal Conflict in Peru, Cranna and David Shave explicate the potential benefits that the country could have accrued, if the conflict had not occurred. By taking a cross section analysis of Bolivia, Chile and Ecuador, they conclude that Peru recorded the most significant drop in GDP growth due to international recession and suffered the highest rate of inflation in the 1980s. Hence \\"while all of Latin America suffered during the 1980's, no main Latin American country fell further…than Peru.\\" =Strategic Foresight Group's Cost of Conflict Reports= Strategic Foresight Group offers three reports—published in 2009 (Middle East), 2006 (Sri Lanka), and 2004 (India/Pakistan)—on the cost of conflicts in Asia. The reports take into account a varied number of parameters including military, economic, socio- political, environmental, psychological, and diplomatic costs among others. In other words, the report inculcates a comprehensive perspective of the effects of war and its aftermath. The documents are presented in a graphical form for easy and quick comprehension by decision makers. Apart from measuring the costs that have occurred in the past, the reports also includes potential future scenarios for conflict and their consequences. Cost of Conflict in India/Pakistan Strategic Foresight Group led the first endeavor in the field of cost of conflict studies, which was received extremely well by the media and political strata. The report has several interesting findings. According to the report, at least 100,000 families suffered direct human costs on account of the four wars between India and Pakistan. In addition, troop mobilization in Operation Prakaram (December 2001 – October 2002), cost India and Pakistan a combined $3billion. A similar mobilization in the future would see a 50% increase in costs on both sides. Cost of Conflict in Sri Lanka This report focuses on the Sri Lankan Civil War, a twenty-six-year- long military conflict between the Tamil insurgents and successive Sri Lankan governments. According to the report Sri Lanka was the most militarized among the South Asian countries with 8,000 military personnel per million population. In terms of military expenditure as percentage of GDP, Sri Lanka had the largest expenditure in the region. The country's defense expenditure is also higher than other comparable conflict-ridden countries such as Colombia, Myanmar, Sierra Leone, Sudan, the Philippines and Uganda. Although the report is sold out the information is readily available on-line. Cost of Conflict in the Middle East Lastly, the Cost of Conflict in the Middle East calculates the direct and indirect costs of successive wars in the Middle East. It involves all the countries affected. Some interesting findings from the report include the following points: 7 out of the 10 highest military spenders in the world are currently from the Middle East and the cumulative military expenditure is expected to double in the next 10 years. The region also has the highest number of military personnel per million people in the world. The First Gulf War in 1990, emitted CO2 that was equivalent to 1.5% of the world's annual emissions. The report has special chapters dedicated to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Opportunity Cost The most unusual feature in these reports is the opportunity cost of conflict – that is the economic benefits that could have been accrued had there not been conflicts in these countries or regions. According to the reports, countries in the Middle East that are directly involved in or affected by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, internal strife in Lebanon and the US invasion of Iraq have lost a $12 trillion (in 2006 dollar value) in opportunity costs from 1991 to 2010. In the case of Sri Lanka, SFG stated that Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) remained stagnant during periods of civil war and that net FDI increased during periods of ceasefire. In 2004, Strategic Foresight Group stated that India and Pakistan could achieve growth rates of 10% and 7% respectively, provided there is no major conflict, no global recession and effective resource and political management in the future. Thematic Cost of Conflict Reports =Africa's Missing Billions= A report conducted by 3 international organizations in 2007 highlighted the heavy cost to development in Africa, due to ensuing conflicts in various countries. The report conducted by Oxfam International, the International Action Network on Small Arms and Saferworld stated that 23 African countries were involved in one form of conflict or another between 1990 and 2005. During these 15 years the cost of conflict in Africa was equivalent to the funds granted to the continent in international aid over the same period – both conflicts and aid from 1990-2005 amounted to $284 billion. In other words, the money lost in conflict could have been used in more effective ways, such as addressing the needs of education, clean water and sanitation and the prevention of harmful disease in African countries.Hillier, Debbie (11 October 2007). \\"Africa's Missing Billions: International arms flows and the cost of conflict\\" . Oxfam.org. Oxfam International. Other facts included in the report: On average, armed conflict shrinks an African nation's economy by 15 percent. Conflicts are costing African economies an average of $18bn a year. Conflicts in countries like Burundi and Rwanda have cost their governments an annual economic loss of 37% and 32% of their GDP respectively. =US War on Terror= Several studies have been conducted on the economic costs of the US war on terror, which began in 2001. These include studies by William Nordhaus in 2002, Wallsten & Kosec in 2005 and successive studies by the US Congressional Budget Office (CBO). A majority of these reports focus on the 2003 war in Iraq but the costs also involve the Bush administration's wider global war on terror as well. The reports contain the cost of occupation – reconstruction & security, diplomatic and military expenditure. The findings are compared to previous US wars in Vietnam and Korea. The studies also contain other areas where this money could have been spent more efficiently. Perhaps the most famous study is one conducted by Harvard professor Linda Bilmes and Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz. While conventional estimates mark the economic cost for the US at $400 billion in 2007, the Stiglitz study on the 'War on Terror' estimates the total cost by 2015 at $1 trillion. This is because the report takes into account indirect costs such as disability pensions and the price of oil. In a 2008 update, Stiglitz and his co-author Linda Bilmes published the book, The Three Trillion Dollar War: The True Cost of the Iraq Conflict, which describes additional hidden costs. A new report dated 4 July 2011 by the Eisenhower Research Project based at Brown University's Watson Institute for International Studies estimates that nearly 10 years after the declaration of the War on Terror, the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan have killed at least 225,000 people, including men and women in uniform, contractors, and civilians. The wars will cost Americans between $3.2 and $4 trillion, including medical care and disability for current and future war veterans. The group's \\"Costs of War\\" project, which involved more than 20 economists, anthropologists, lawyers, humanitarian personnel, and political scientists. The organization provides new estimates of the total war cost as well as other direct and indirect human and economic costs of the US military response to the 9/11 attacks. The $3.2- $4 trillion figure does not include substantial probable future interest on war-related debt. The \\"Costs of War\\" report also includes other statistics such as deaths, injuries and displaced persons. For instance, more than 31,000 people in uniform and military contractors have died, including the Iraqi and Afghan security forces and other military forces allied with the United States. By a very conservative estimate, 137,000 civilians have been killed in Iraq and Afghanistan by all parties to these conflicts. The wars have created more than 7.8 million refugees among Iraqis, Afghans, and Pakistanis. Because the wars have been financed almost entirely by borrowing, $185 billion in interest has already been paid on war spending, and another $1 trillion could accrue in interest alone through 2020. Federal obligations to care for past and future veterans of these wars will likely total between $600–$950 billion. This number is not included in most analyses of the costs of war and will not peak until mid-century. Results of the War in Afghanistan and Iraq While it was promised that the US invasions would bring democracy to both countries, Afghanistan and Iraq, both continue to rank low in global rankings of political freedom, with warlords continuing to hold power in Afghanistan with US support, and Iraqi communities more segregated today than before by gender and ethnicity as a result of the war. =The human cost of conflict in the Philippines= This study conducted by Amnesty International in 2008, measures the cost of conflict on a humanitarian scale. The report estimates a total of 120,000 deaths and a further 2 million displaced from the conflict over a period of 40 years. The report features individual accounts by some of the survivors of the conflict as well as aid workers and human rights activists and hence it takes a more qualitative approach to the costs.\\"Philippines: Shattered Peace in Mindanao: The human cost of conflict in the Philippines\\".

It is operated as a regional community station heard mainly in suburban Westchester County, the Bronx, Queens, the North Shore of Nassau County, Fairfield County, Connecticut and northern New Jersey. The station president is William O'Shaughnessy, and its current owner is Hudson-Westchester Radio, Inc. along with WVIP 93.5 FM. The station claimed more than five million live listeners as of 2005. Its studios and transmitter are located separately in New Rochelle. WVOX reaches many more listeners, worldwide, by streaming live, online. As of July 12, 2010, WVOX can also be heard on the HD2 subchannel of its FM sister station, WVIP. Programming is primarily locally produced information and talk, including programs presented by local citizens and interest groups. The station is affiliated with Music of Your Life, which airs overnights, weekends and in time slots not occupied by a local show. History =Early years= On April 28, 1949, New Rochelle Broadcasting Service, Inc., filed for a construction permit to build a new radio station at 1460 kHz in New Rochelle. The permit was granted on June 22, 1950, and WGNR began broadcasts that September 9. WGNR-FM 93.5 had already launched in September 1948. New Rochelle Broadcasting Service, however, went bankrupt in 1952, signing the station off on August 1; after the appointment of a receiver, Radio New Rochelle, Inc., owned by the Iodice family, acquired the station and changed the call letters to WNRC on both the AM and FM stations. WNRC returned to the air in October 1953; it retained those call letters through a transfer of control to the Daniels family in 1955. WNRC became WWES- AM-FM on December 10, 1958, as the station was sold to Radio Westchester for $225,000. The Radio Westchester sale made it a sister to WVIP in Mount Kisco, serving lower Westchester County. On February 26, 1959, however, the station would adopt the calls it has used ever since: WVOX. =WVOX= WVOX joined a growing radio operation owned by the New York Herald-Tribune newspaper. By 1962, after John Hay Whitney bought the Herald-Tribune the year before, the paper's radio division included WVOX-AM-FM, WVIP, WGHQ at Saugerties and WFYI in Mineola. With the Herald-Tribune closed, Whitney Communications sold WVOX- AM-FM and WGHQ-AM-FM in 1968 to Hudson-Westchester Radio in an $800,000 acquisition. Hudson-Westchester was led by William O'Shaughnessy, a former account executive with the Herald-Tribune Radio Network who had been WVOX's general manager since 1965. O'Shaughnessy built WVOX into a community-oriented talk outlet, which by 1973 already had the reputation of being the \\"soap box of Westchester\\". That year, it moved out of its former studios, which he called an \\"upholstered sewer\\", to new facilities at One Broadcast Plaza in New Rochelle. O'Shaughnessy hosted a daily talk show on the station for more than 50 years, featuring interviews with many major U.S. politicians, authors, and entertainers.Colorful Radio Mogul Sees Threat to Freedom of the Airwaves, New York Sun, May 23, 2005 O'Shaughnessy, who has been called \\"the voice of Westchester\\",Stephen Warley (2005), Serving Their Communities: 50 Years of the New York State Broadcasters Association, Fordham University Press, , is fond of calling WVOX the \\"quintessential community radio station in America\\",WLNA radio mellows out, Westchester County Business Journal, September 28, 1998 a label first applied to the station by the Wall Street Journal. In 2005, O'Shaughnessy was one of the first 25 people to be inducted into the new New York State Broadcasters Hall of Fame by the New York State Broadcasters Association.Westchester County Business Journal, April 25, 2005 He was honored for his long record as a champion of free speech under the First Amendment. WVOX's programming in the 1970s included local news roundup shows dedicated to towns in its coverage area, such as Mount Vernon and Pelham; the call-in show \\"Open Line\\", which often ran over its allotted time slot; ethnic and religious blocks; and standards music when the station didn't have a talk show on the air. Following his departure from WEVD in 2001, Bill Mazer launched an afternoon interview program on WVOX, which aired from 3–6 PM ET (and streamed from WVOX's website), with his son Arnie serving as producer. Mazer's last show was aired August 3, 2009, ending his tenure at the station and marking his retirement from broadcasting.

It is a white, odourless solid which slowly decomposes into its elements at room temperature; despite this it is the most stable of the binary first row transition metal hydrides. A variety of coordination compounds containing Zn-H bonds are used as reducing agents, however ZnH2 itself has no common applications.  Discovery and synthesis  Zinc(II) hydride was first synthesised in 1947 by Hermann Schlesinger, via a reaction between dimethylzinc and lithium aluminium hydride; a process which was somewhat hazardous due to the pyrophoric nature of Zn(CH3)2. :Zn(CH3)2 +2LiAlH4->ZnH2 +2LiAlH3CH3 Later methods were predominantly salt metathesis reactions between zinc halides and alkali metal hydrides, which are significantly safer.Egon Wiberg, Arnold Frederick Holleman (2001) Inorganic Chemistry, Elsevier Examples include: :ZnBr2 \\\\+ 2LiH → ZnH2 \\\\+ 2LiBr :ZnI2 \\\\+ 2 NaH + → ZnH2 \\\\+ 2NaI :ZnI2 \\\\+ 2 LiAlH4 → ZnH2 \\\\+ AlH3 \\\\+ 2LiI Small quantities of gaseous zinc(II) hydride have also been produced by laser ablation of zinc under a hydrogen atmosphere and other high energy techniques. These methods have been used to assess its gas phase properties.  Chemical properties  = Structure = New evidence suggests that in zinc(II) hydride, elements form a one-dimensional network (polymer), being connected by covalent bonds. Other lower metal hydrides polymerise in a similar fashion (c.f. aluminium hydride). Solid zinc(II) hydride is the irreversible autopolymerisation product of the molecular form, and the molecular form cannot be isolated in concentration. Solubilising zinc(II) hydride in non-aqueous solvents, involve adducts with molecular zinc(II) hydride, such as ZnH2(H2) in liquid hydrogen. = Stability = Zinc(II) hydride slowly decomposes to metallic zinc and H2 at room temperature, with decomposition becoming rapid if it is heated above 90°C. :ZnH2 → H2 \\\\+ Zn0 It is readily oxidised and is sensitive to both air and moisture; being hydrolysed slowly by water but violently by aqueous acids, which indicates possible passivation via the formation of a surface layer of ZnO. Despite this older samples may be pyrophoric. Zinc hydride can therefore be considered metastable at best, however it is still the most stable of all the binary first row transition metal hydrides (c.f. titanium(IV) hydride).  Molecular form  Molecular zinc(II) hydride, ZnH2, was recently identified as a volatile product of the acidified reduction of zinc ions with sodium borohydride. This reaction is similar to the acidified reduction with lithium aluminium hydride, however a greater fraction of the generated zinc(II) hydride is in the molecular form. This can be attributed to a slower reaction rate, which prevents a polymerising concentration of building over the progression of the reaction. This follows earlier experiments in direct synthesis from the elements. The reaction of excited zinc atoms with molecular hydrogen in the gas phase was studied by Breckenridge et al using laserpump- probe techniques. Owing to its relative thermal stability, molecular zinc(II) hydride is included in the short list of molecular metal hydrides, which have been successfully identified in the gas phase (that is, not limited to matrix isolation). The average Zn-H bond energy was recently calculated to be 51.24 kcal mol−1, while the H-H bond energy is 103.3 kcal mol−1. Therefore, the overall reaction is nearly ergoneutral. :Zn(g) \\\\+ H2(g) → ZnH2(g) Molecular zinc hydride in the gas phase was found to be linear with a Zn-H bond length of 153.5 pm. The molecule can be found a singlet ground state of 1Σg+. Quantum chemical calculations predict the molecular form to exist in a doubly hydrogen-bridged, dimeric groundstate, with little or no formational energy barrier.The dimer can be described as di-μ-hydrido-bis(hydridozinc), according to IUPAC additive nomenclature.

He was elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Hythe in 1857 and served as Under- Secretary of State for War from 1857 to 1858. He resigned through appointment as Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds on 9 February 1859. He also sat as MP for Taunton from 1853 to 1857, for the West Riding of Yorkshire from 1859 to 1865, for Monmouth from 1868 to 1874, for the Eastern West Riding of Yorkshire from 1880 to 1885, and finally for Osgoldcross from 1885 to 1886. Stood as Liberal Unionist candidate for Osgoldcross in 1886. He served as High Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1868. He was Lord of the Manor of Huddersfield, and owner of a large proportion of the town as well as a total of 11,248 acres of the West Riding. In addition he owned a 138,000 acre estate in Inverness, and 800 acres of Lincolnshire.John Bateman: The Great Landowners of Great Britain and Ireland, 1873, p375 On 2 August 1865 he married Lady Helen Guendolen Seymour, daughter of Edward Adolphus Seymour, 12th Duke of Somerset, thus acquiring the Bulstrode estate at Gerrards Cross. They had four children: Guendolen Isabella Jane, Hermione Charlotte, Rosamund Isabel and Sir John Frescheville. = Links with the University of Huddersfield = In 1825 there was an attempt to set up a Scientific and Mechanics Institution in Huddersfield. Supported by a group of donors, Sir John William Ramsden later became the institution's Patron. Its aims were to instruct local mechanics and tradesmen in scientific principles relating to their work, through lectures and a circulation library. It later became part of the Huddersfield Philosophical Society. Subsequent educational initiatives in Huddersfield included the Young Men's Mental Improvement Society, the Huddersfield Mechanics' Institution, and the Technical School. The Technical School and Mechanic's Institute merged to become the Technical College, which subsequently became the College of Technology, then Huddersfield Polytechnic, before being granted University status as the University of Huddersfield in 1992. The Ramsden Building, named after Sir John William Ramsden, was opened in 1883 by the Huddersfield Technical School and Mechanics' Institute and is situated on Queen Street South, between Milton Church and St Paul's Church. The Ramsden Building is now part of the University of Huddersfield campus.

Life Orwell Road, Dovercourt He was the son of John Bagshaw of Rugby, Warwickshire. He moved to Harwich in Essex and acquired land at nearby Dovercourt, where he developed plans with the help of W.H. Lindsey, a London architect, to build a new resort overlooking the sea. He started the project in 1845 by building a mansion, Cliff House, for himself and his family and actively promoted a railway link to Harwich. When a chalybeate spring was discovered in the grounds of Cliff House, Bagshaw extended the property to incorporate a spa, library, pump room, and conservatory. He next developed Orwell Terrace where his son Robert John Bagshaw, also an MP for Harwich, moved into Banksea House in 1857. However the developments, which included Marine Parade and the Cliff Estate, caused him financial difficulties and he was declared bankrupt in 1859. Parliamentary career He was elected at the 1835 general election as Member of Parliament (MP) for Sudbury, having unsuccessfully contested the seat at a by-election in July 1834. At the 1837 general election, he did not stand again in Sudbury, but contested Kidderminster unsuccessfully.Craig, op. cit., page 165 At the 1841 general election he stood instead in Harwich, but was not elected.Craig, op. cit., pages 144–145 He won the seat in 1847, but was defeated in 1852. However, the election of his Conservative Party successor was voided on petition, and Bagshaw won the resulting by-election on 21 June 1853. After being re-elected in 1857, he resigned his seat in the House of Commons on 9 March 1859, through appointment as Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds. Private life He died in Norwood in 1861 after the contents of his house and spa had been sold and his estate broken up. Cliff House was demolished in 1909 and the Spa in 1920. He had married twice and had a son and 3 daughters. His son John Robert continued the development of Dovercourt and also became MP for Harwich.

The robot is 104 cm high and weighs around 22 kg Open-source robotics (OSR) is where the physical artifacts of the subject are offered by the open design movement. This branch of robotics makes use of open-source hardware and free and open-source software providing blueprints, schematics, and source code. The term usually means that information about the hardware is easily discerned so that others can make it from standard commodity components and tools—coupling it closely to the maker movement and open science. Advantages * Long-term availability. Many non-open robots and components, especially at hobbyist level, are designed and sold by tiny startups which can disappear overnight, leaving customers without support. Open-source systems are guaranteed to have their designs available for ever so communities of users can, and do, continue support after the manufacturer has disappeared. * Avoiding lock-in. A company relying on any particular non-open component exposes itself to business risk that the supplier could ratchet up prices after they have invested time and technology building on it. Open hardware can be manufacturered by anyone, creating competition or at least the potential for competition, which both remove this risk. * Interchangeable software and/or hardware with common interfaces. * Ability to modify and fork designs more easily for customisation. * Scientific reproducibility - guarantees that other labs can replicate and extend work, leading to increased impact, citations and reputation for the designer. * Lower-cost. Costs of a robot can be decreased dramatically when all components and tools are commodities. No component seller can hold a project to ransom by ratcheting the price of a critical component, as competing suppliers can easily be interchanged. Drawbacks * For commercial organisations, open-sourcing their own designs obviously means they can no longer make large profits through the traditional engineering business model of acting as the monopoly manufacturer or seller, because the open design can be manufactured and sold by anyone including direct competitors. Profit from engineering can come from three main sources: design, manufacturing, and support. As with other open source business models, commercial designers typically make profit via their association with the brand, which may still be trademarked. A valuable brand allows them to command a premium for their own manufactured products, as it can be associated with high quality and provide a quality guarantee to customers. The same brand is also used to command a premium on associated services, such as providing installation, maintenance, and integration support for the product. Again customers will typically pay more for the knowledge that this support is provided directly by the original designer, who therefore knows the product better than competitors. * Some customers associate open source with amateurism, the hacker community, low quality and poor support. Serious companies using this business model may need to work harder to overcome this perception by emphasising their professionalism and brand to differentiate themselves from amateur efforts. Popularity A first sign of the increasing popularity of building robots yourself can be found with the DIY community. What began with small competitions for remote operated vehicles (e.g. Robot combat), soon developed to the building of autonomous telepresence robots as Sparky and then true robots (being able to take decisions themselves) as the Open Automaton Project and Leaf Project. Certain commercial companies now also produce kits for making simple robots. A recurring problem in the community has been projects, especially on Kickstarter, promising to fully open-source their hardware and then reneging on this promise once funded, in order to profit from being the sole manufacturer and seller. Popular applications include: * Domestic tasks: vacuum cleaning, floor washing and automated mowing. * The use of RepRaps and other 3-D printers for rapid prototyping, art, toy manufacturing, educational aides, and open-source appropriate technology * metalworks automation * building electronic circuitry (printing and component placing of PCB-boards) * transportation, i.e. self-driving vehicles * combat robots, including manual controlled and autonomous contests See also *Accelerometer *Bluetooth *How-to *Internet of Things *Khepera mobile robot III *Maker culture *Modular design *Open-source computing hardware *OpenStructures *Phase-change material *Pulse-width modulation (PWM) *Robot software *Robotics suite *WiDi References Robotics ","title":"Open-source robotics"},{"id":"21175474","title":"Viktor Spasov"},{"id":"21175476","text":"Sámi institutional symbols are of relatively new origin, as the Sámi political institutions themselves are quite new. The symbols generally draw inspiration from old ornamental traditions such as duodji and the \\"runes\\" of the traditional shaman's drums. The symbols generally don't follow the rules of tincture, as the \\"Sámi colours\\" are traditionally placed colour on colour (rather than colour on metal and vice versa).  Sámi flag  Sami flag Though the highest ranking symbol, the flag does not symbolize any particular institution. It is, however, as of 1986 the official flag of all Sámi in all countries and a recognized flag in Norway.:no:Sameflagget#Det samiske flagget Hence, it is used by most important Sámi institutions. The flag is a combination of an old, unofficial flag and an often-used sun/moon symbol of the shaman's drum. It is inspired by a mythological poem claiming the Sámi to be \\"children of the Sun\\". With the creation of this flag, the \\"national colours\\" of the Sámi were defined as red, green, yellow and blue. All of these are heraldic colours, except yellow which is a metal (\\"ore\\") in heraldic terms.  Pan-Sámi political structures  = Sámi Parliamentary Council = = Sámi Council = The Sámi Council, which organizes Sámi non-governmental organisations at the international level has a symbol that predates the Sámi flag. In appearance it is similar to the arppa – a chain of rings used together with shaman's drums to predict the future. It symbolizes unity between Sámi of the four states.  Sámi parliaments  = Sámi Parliament of Norway = The logo of the Sámi Parliament of Norway draws the least inspiration from the Sámi flag. It represents the parliament building seen from above, with the main corpus marked in grey and the hall of parliament in red. However, the building is designed to suggest the sun/moon symbol when seen from above. = Sámi Parliament of Sweden = The logo of the Sámi Parliament of Sweden features a circle in the four Sámi colours. The circle is striped in resemblance of a shaman's drum's sun-symbol. Within the circle there is a runic symbol resembling an arrow pointing southwest. = Sámi Parliament of Finland = The logo of the Sámi Parliament of Finland features a red circle with a yellow line at the bottom (inside the circle) and four blue lines radiating from it - symbolizing the sun. The four lines represent the four Sámi groups of Finland, and the three colours are that of the first Sámi flag. The green colour was originally added to represent the South Sámi, who are not native to Finland.  Russian Sámi organisation  There is no longer a Sámi Parliament of Russia. The elected Council of Plenipotentiary Representatives of the Sámi of Murmansk Province uses a symbol heavily inspired by the flag: two reindeer horns joined like a crescent, the upper half red and the lower half blue, between the halves are two stripes in yellow and green. The official Centre for Indigenous People in Murmansk Province, under which the official Council of Indigenous Peoples under the [Provincial] Government operates, uses a logo also inspired by the flag: a circle, left half blue and right half red, at the centre of which is a brown lávvu, a blue line symbolizing water, and a multicoloured line symbolizing the Aurora Borealis, the colours of the latter being from left to right red, yellow, green and blue.  Other Sámi institutions  = Finnmark Estate = Finnmárkuopmodat, the autonomous entity established by the Finnmark Act has a logo that according to the entity's website \\"gets it colours from the Sámi and the Norwegian flag, as a symbol that the Finnmark Estate feels related to and responsible for both Sámi, kvens and ethnic Norwegians. (...) The circular shape... refers both to the Sámi flag's sun-symbol and to the solid and safe envelopment of a circle. (...)

Universal tunings are particularly favoured by advanced players of single-neck instruments. Motivation Many players prefer not to play a pedal steel guitar with multiple necks, which add to the weight of the instrument and complexity of learning multiple tunings. The E9 Nashville tuning is the most popular tuning by far, with most implementations on a 10-string neck. The next most popular tuning is C6, which many players enjoy playing but appears on few recordings compared to E9. There is great appeal for a single neck pedal steel guitar with a tuning that can duplicate 90+% of the music played on the most popular tunings. While most touring professional pedal steel guitarists tend to either carry a double neck guitar (D-10 with E9 and C6 tunings) on the road, many have found that a single neck 10 string pedal steel guitar with the E9 tuning is enough for their needs. Some pro players have chosen a 12- or 14-string pedal steel for touring and recording sessions. Notable examples of players of universal tunings include Maurice Anderson (mentioned below), Julian Tharpe, Winnie Winston (mentioned below), Jeff Newman (also mentioned below), Joe Wright, 'Cowboy' Eddie Long, and others. Examples The Bb6/Eb9 Universal Tuning was developed by Maurice ('Reece') Anderson in Dallas, TX. Reece was one of the last steel guitarists with the landmark western swing band Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys. Their music was very jazz-oriented and the tuning was developed to exploit the jazz changes but to also let the player use the characteristic sounds of the E9 Nashville tuning, which became popular in the 1960s in (what is now referred to as) CLASSIC country music. Maurice's Bb6 tuning is used by a relatively small number of players but is a powerful tuning for a player whose principal genre is western swing or jazz and for whom it is advantageous to be able to play the 'country licks' when the need arises. In ^ 1 Winston, Winnie; Bill Keith (1975). Pedal Steel Guitar. Oak Publications. p. 115. . the first instance of the E9/B6 Universal Tuning was published. It was used by both authors and included 14 strings. In 1974-5, Michigan steel guitarist Larry Bell adopted Maurice Anderson's tuning and quickly made changes toward incorporating more of the Nashville E9 sound by including pedal and knee lever changes (e.g., the 'C' pedal from E9, which Anderson had not incorporated into Bb6) and raising the entire tuning 1/2 step to B6/E9. Once the Winston/Keith book was published, Bell was influenced to continue modifying his tuning by changing the 4th and 8th strings from D# to E, developing a 12 string E9/B6 tuning that had elements of Maurice Anderson's tuning and elements of what Jeff Newman eventually published in his series of teaching materials. See http://www.larrybell.org for a more in-depth treatment of the tuning as used by Larry Bell. The 12-string version of the E9/B6 Universal Tuning was popularized in the late 1970s by Nashville steel guitarist Jeff Newman who created the most popular instructional materials for pedal steel guitar. It remains the most widely used universal tuning. This tuning is based on the E9 Nashville tuning and is optimized to deliver the characteristic sounds of that tuning. The addition of four additional pedals and 2 or 4 extra strings in the lower register provides the ability to play music originally played on the C6 tuning, which is the second most common tuning (to the Nashville E9) on pedal steel guitars worldwide.

Water reform was first placed on the national agenda at the 1994 Council of Australian Governments (COAG) meeting when a strategic framework was devised. As the knowledge of surface and groundwater systems grew and the awareness of the significance of sustainable water markets increased, further water reform was agreed to at the 2004 COAG meeting, under a national blueprint known as the National Water Initiative (NWI). Australia can be divided into 12 major drainage divisions. For example, the Murray-Darling drainage division consists of the Murray River basin and the Darling River basin. Three of these drainage divisions account for 87% of the water that Australia consumes – the North East Coast division, the South East Coast division, and the Murray-Darling. This means that the supply of water within Australia is highly concentrated, and any defect to one of these major water divisions can cause major water security issues. Privatisation of water In the 21st century, there have been attempts to establish a privatised water market in Australia, with Victoria acting as a model for other states. Many political parties, community groups, NGO's and other groups and people see the privatisation of water as a denial of basic human rights on behalf of state and federal governments . Water privatisation is a highly controversial issue and touches on the much broader arguments for and against the private control of formerly public services. Boundaries to water security A major boundary which affects effective water management is the highly variable precipitation levels of Australia – Australian rainfall is more variable than rainfall in the rest of the world since it is driven by the Southern Oscillation rather than by seasonal changes.Diamond, Jared (2005). Collapse, p. 384. Penguin Books, London. The result is that for the same level of reliability of supply, dams in Australia need to be six times as large as those in Europe and twice as large as the world average to ensure water sources do not run dry during dry seasons. Competition for water =Competition between states= In Australia there is competition for the resources of the Darling River system between Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia. Similarly, there is competition for the resources of the Murray River between NSW, Victoria and South Australia. The South Australian government established a new ministerial portfolio of Water Security as the water security issues facing South Australia and the Lower Lakes and Coorong emerged.(February 2007).

Retrieved on 25 January 2009. =Competition for environmental flows= The Snowy Mountains Scheme diverted water from the Snowy River to the Murray River and the Murrumbidgee River for the benefit of irrigators and electricity generation through hydro-electric power. In recent years, government has taken action to increase environmental flows to the Snowy in spite of severe drought in the Murray-Darling Basin. The Australian Government has implemented buy-backs of water allocations, or properties with water allocations, to endeavour to increase environmental flows. Regulatory agencies =Federal= National Water Commission The National Water Commission was an independent statutory body within the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities that was established to implement the National Water Initiative and reform the broader national water agenda. The National Water Commission published a report on the future need for desalination technologies to play a role in securing Australia’s water supplies.http://www.nwc.gov.au/resources/documents/Trends_in_Desalination_review_oct08.pdf It also publishes a biennial assessment of progress in implementation of the National Water Initiative, the latest being in October 2009. The 2009 assessment nominates areas of slow or inadequate reform and makes 68 recommendations for action over the next two years. The Commission was abolished in 2014.

The power usage is to be offset by a new wind farm. Sydney also draws water from the Shoalhaven River near Nowra. Hunter Water Corporation proposes a dam, Tillegra Dam, on the Williams River in Dungog Shire in the Upper Hunter Region. When completed, the dam will hold 450 billion litres of water. The estimated cost of the dam is around $300 million ($477 Million as at April 2010). Included in the dam proposal is a hydro-power generation plant which will generate around 3,000 megawatt hours of energy each year. Hunter Water is also proposing to plant 1.5 million trees as carbon offsets. The need for this dam is strongly disputed and subject to review by the NSW Government Department of Planning. Hunter Water claims the dam is required to \\"drought proof\\" Newcastle and the Central Coast. Opponents say the dam is grossly excessive for this need, will drown valuable agricultural land and greater water efficiency, demand management and recycling would eliminate the need for the dam. =South Australia= The Adelaide Desalination Plant, a 300 megalitre per day plant, began producing water in October 2011. =Victoria= Victoria has undertaken several major construction projects to link state water supplies. These projects were designed to establish a statewide water market in preparation for the privatisation of Victoria's water.

Retrieved on 20 January 2009 the North–South Pipeline completely in February 2010 to carry water from the Goulburn River to Melbourne’s Sugarloaf Reservoir in times of need, and an interconnector pipeline connecting the Geelong-Ballarat region. Many argue that in privatising Victoria's water resources and creating a market to trade water between regions, the State Government is divesting itself from its core human rights responsibilities to ensure potable water to the population it represents. This would come at great environmental cost, increase energy usage, decrease efficience, ignore sustainable water management options and increase end-user water costs, placing water privatisation as a high risk to water security in Victoria, despite its acceptance by the state government. =Queensland= The Queensland government has developed the SEQ Water Grid, to enhance the state's water security with the Western Corridor Recycled Water Project being a key part. The Gold Coast desalination plant which has been built at Tugun on the Gold Coast, is another project that supplies water to markets in the South East Queensland region. The Queensland government investigated the possibility of building a pipeline from the Northern Rivers of New South Wales to South East Queensland to facilitate water trade between these regions. Major initiatives for increased rural water security =Murray Darling Basin= The Snowy Mountains Scheme increased water security to properties near the Murray and Murrumbidgee Rivers during the 1960s and 70s. Overallocation of water licences and prolonged severe drought affecting snowfalls have undermined that security in the early 21st century. =Ord River Scheme= The Ord River Irrigation Scheme (ORIS) in the Kimberley region of Western Australia created Lake Argyle, Australia's second largest lake. ORIS provides water for irrigation to over 117 km² of farmland and there are plans to extend the scheme to allow irrigation of 440 km² in the future. Areas with critical water shortages =NSW= Lachlan River valley On 24 October 2009 the Sydney Morning Herald reported that the Lachlan River would stop flowing west of Condoblin within weeks as flows are slashed to keep only part of the river flowing, that the Wyangala Dam could be empty by mid summer (15 January 2010) and that thousands of households will need to have water trucked to them. This situation follows 8 years of drought. Farmers in the area of the Lachlan Valley where the river will not flow are deeply concerned for the viability of their farms. More than 100,000 people live in the total Lachlan catchment. 14% of NSW agricultural production is generated in the region from a land area of approximately 10% of NSW. =South Australia= The Coorong The Coorong's future is in doubt because of low flows of water reaching the mouth of the Murray River. Acid sulphate soils are being exposed as water levels drop in the Doorong and nearby lakes, adding to the problems in the region.

Marion Only the pays d'état had rights to such estates. This arose from the specific legal conditions of their historical incorporation into the royal domain (e.g., Burgundy, Foix, Languedoc) or into France itself (e.g., Béarn, Corsica, Dauphiné). Within a pays d'état, regions could have their own particular estates, the états particuliers (\\"estates particular\\"). For example, in Burgundy the counties (comtés) of Auxerre, Bar- sur-Seine, Charolais and the Mâconnais each had their own états particuliers in the early modern period. These would send representatives to the Burgundian états provinciaux in Dijon. Only the Mâconnais retained its own états in 1789; the rest had been absorbed into the Burgundian estates general.Julian Swann, Provincial Power and Absolute Monarchy: The Estates General of Burgundy, 1661–1790 (Cambridge, 2003), pp. 27–28. The impôts were the provincial estates' main preoccupation and raison d'être throughout the ancien régime. Their formal assent to the impôts was generally accompanied by the drafting of complaints to send to the king or his councils. In contrast to the pays d'état, any area where impôts were fixed by the king's representatives (known as the élus) were known as pays d'élection. This distinction was abolished during the French Revolution in 1789. A third category, \\"pays d'imposition\\" was used for recently conquered lands which had their own local institutions (they were similar to the \\"pays d'état\\" under which they are sometimes grouped), although taxation was overseen by the royal intendant.

Alongside a cappella works, the choir appears with Lithuanian and foreign chamber and symphony orchestras, including the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra, Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin, and others in Germany, Israel, and Russia. The choir has performed with many known musicians, including cellist Mark Drobinsky, singer Robin Blaze, cantor Joseph Malovany, and famous Lithuanian singers, such as Virgilijus Noreika, and others. An important part of the activities of Jauna muzika is representation of the Lithuanian choral art in foreign countries. Their concerts abroad have featured compositions by classical and contemporary composers. The choir has toured in Europe, China, Japan and Israel. Besides performances, the Jauna Muzika has organized a number of projects in Lithuania. Every year since 1995, th choir” has held workshops on choir conducting and interpretation. In the autumn of 1998, on the initiative of the choir, an international festival Eternal Jerusalem was held in the major concert halls of Vilnius - the Lithuanian National Philharmonic Hall, the Lithuanian National Opera and Ballet Theatre, and the Vilnius Town Hall. In 2000, together with the Vilnius Town Hall Festival, Jauna muzika invited the lovers of baroque music to a concert series English and French Baroque Music, in which The King’s Consort from Great Britain and Il Seminario Musicale from France appeared, and, in 2001, to The Days of German and Polish Baroque Music, which featured Musica Antiqua Köln from Germany and Capella Gedanensis from Poland. In 2002, the choir put on a series of five concerts, which was devoted to the rebuilding of the Vilnius Evangelical Lutheran Church.

The Estates of Brittany was the States Provincial for the province of Brittany. It gathered members of the high clergy, a large number of nobles and delegates from the 42 towns and cities of Brittany. In 1788 it included nearly 1,000 nobles as opposed to fewer than 100 representatives of the other two orders. History The Estates were founded in the Middle Ages by Arthur II, Duke of Brittany. It continued as the States Provincial of France during the time of the Ancien Régime. In addition to founding the Estates, Duke Arthur II introduced the innovation of permitting the third estate to be represented. The marquise de Sévigné participated in its meetings at Rennes and Vitré between 1670 and 1690, writing: > I did not want to see the opening, it was too early. The Estates do not have > to be long. It only needed to ask what the King wanted. He need not say a > word; and, voilà, it is done. For the Governor, he found there, I don't know > how, over 40,000 écus which returned to him. An infinity of other presents, > pensions, road and town repairs, 15 or 20 grandes tables, continual gaming, > eternal balls, comedies three times a week, a grand 'braverie' : that's the > Estates. I forget 400 pipes of wine that were drunk, but if I forget that > little thing, the others did not forget it, and this was the first.Letter to > Madame de Grignan – Aux Rochers, this Wednesday 5 August 1671. Meetings were the opportunity for an intense nightlife, with banquets (paid for on the provincial budget) offering the chance to continue disputes begun at the daily sittings by competition in consumption, drinking and card games. In more serious matters the Estates' interests were essentially the same as the parliament of Brittany. They sometimes met concurrently and addressed similar issues. The two bodies naturally cooperated in restricting royal power in the province and limiting the action of royal representatives there, mainly the intendant and commander in chief. The Estates particularly came into conflict with the royal state over taxes, since Brittany had been exempted from the national salt tax and also enjoyed other privileges. Conflicts arose in the late 17th century, leading to the uprising known as the Revolt of the papier timbré and later in the early 18th century when the Estates resisted the centralising measures of the king, leading to the Pontcallec Conspiracy, which was severely repressed by the monarchy.

It is located in the historic city centre of Dijon and housed in the former ducal palace which was the headquarters of the Burgundy State in the 15th century. When the duchy was assimilated to the Kingdom of France, the palace became the house of the King. In the 17th century it became the Palace of the Dukes of Burgundy following a project by Jules Hardouin-Mansart. Since 2006, the museum has been in a process of full renovation and extension. First, the work focused on one part including the renovated route “Middle-Ages – Renaissance”, inaugurated on September 7th 2013. The fully-renovated museum displaying 1500 works of art in 50 different rooms was inaugurated on May 17th 2019 in the presence of the Minister for Culture Franck Riester, the former French President François Hollande and the Mayor François Rebsamen.  History of the Museum  Tombs of the Dukes of Burgundy. The Museum was founded during the Age of Enlightenment on the order of the Estates of Burgundy on November 30th 1787 but the project dated from 1783 with the decision to build the eastern wing of the palace. The aim was to facilitate the teaching for the students of the art school by gathering works that could serve as models. This original school was free and open to everyone. It was created by François Devosge on March 24th 1767. The museum was placed under the protection of the Estates of Burgundy and presented its collections in the Salon Condé, conceived as a gallery of paintings to celebrate the glory of the Grand Condé’s battles, and in the Statues Room or “Room of the Antiques” where copies of plaster and marble antiques could be found. It is known for its collections in relation with the dukes of Burgundy, for the richness of its encyclopedic collections stretching from Egyptian art to the 20th century as well as the historical interest of the building that holds them, the Palace of the Dukes of Burgundy. The museum opened its doors to the public in 1799 and gradually spread out within the palace being enriched by imperial grants, deposits by the State, donations and legacies. As one of the largest museums of France, le Musée des Beaux-Arts de Dijon is known for its rich collections of sculptures, paintings, art objects and various other items from the past. Those interested in a specific historical age can admire various stunning items from Antiquity, Middle Ages, Renaissance as well as masterpieces stretching from the 17th century to the 21st century.

On January 1, 1556, in another discussion based on patristic texts, Cranmer was willing to sign the first of his statements, on papal supremacy, conditional on the history of the Council of Nicaea.Diarmaid MacCulloch, Thomas Cranmer (1996), pp. 586-7. Later in January they clashed on much worse terms, after the news of Cranmer's disgrading as Archbishop had reached England.MacCulloch, Cranmer, pp. 588-9. They met again at the Bocardo Prison adjacent to St Michael at the Northgate, when Villagarcía and John Harpsfield interrogated Cranmer in the middle of February. On 26 February there was another statement, written in Latin and probably by Villagarcía, that was signed by Cranmer and witnessed by Villagarcía and Henry Syddall. This was the fifth statement written or signed by Cranmer; he himself spoke of it as a return to the Catholic faith, and asked for sacramental absolution.MacCulloch, Cranmer, pp. 593-5. On 20 March, the day of Cranmer's execution, Villagarcía accompanied him to the University Church of St Mary the Virgin, where Cranmer preached, and exchanged words in Latin with him afterwards.

This has encouraged other major donations, most notably from Richard Harris, Robert Priseman, Grace Gardner,Looksystems.net Note on Grace Gardner and her pictures, Falmouth Art Gallery. and Sue and Ron Astles. The gallery has also benefited from purchases made through grant funding from organisations such as The Art Fund, the Heritage Lottery Fund, MLA/V&A; Purchase Grant Fund, and the Nerys Johnson Contemporary Art Fund. The collection Most of its art collection came from donations made by Alfred de Pass, a businessman and philanthropist who spent an important amount of his personal fortune on buying works of art, which were generously donated to museums and galleries throughout England and South Africa The town's art collection, administered by the gallery's director Brian Stewart until his untimely death in 2010, features works by major British artists including Sir Frank Brangwyn, Sir Edward Coley Burne-Jones, Charles Napier Hemy, Dame Laura Knight, Sir Alfred Munnings, Harry Ousey, William Strang, Henry Scott Tuke, John William Waterhouse, George Frederick Watts and Cornish painter John Opie. Following a 2009 Art Fund bequest, Falmouth acquired a major collection including etchings by Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Edvard Munch, and several works by Prunella Clough, one of the most significant British painters and printmakers of the post-war period. This was followed in 2013 by a major gift of 20 works of art to the gallery from the British artist Robert Priseman (b. 1965). Known as The Robert Priseman Gift works of art by leading British artists of the 21st century such as Mary Webb, Sir Peter Blake, Nicholas Middleton, Marguerite Horner, Alex Hanna, Simon Burton, Simon Carter and Julian Brown were donated to the Gallery.

The inauguration marked the commencement of the first four-year term of Andrew Jackson as President and the second term of John C. Calhoun as Vice President. Chief Justice John Marshall administered the presidential oath of office. Calhoun resigned into this term, and the office remained vacant for the balance of it. (Before ratification of the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967, no constitutional provision existed for filling an intra-term vacancy in the vice presidency.) thumb Travel Jackson's three-week journey from Nashville, Tennessee, to Washington, D.C., first by steamboat to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and then onward by carriage, was marked by large crowds greeting the president-elect. Inauguration The inauguration itself took place on March 4, 1829, and was the first time in which the ceremony was held on the East Portico of the United States Capitol. Ten thousand people arrived in town for the ceremony, eliciting this response from Francis Scott Key: \\"It is beautiful; it is sublime!\\" By 10:00 am, the area in front of the Capitol was filled with people, and the stairs on the East Portico were blocked by a ship's cable to prevent the crowd from advancing. An excited crowd of roughly 21,000 came to see the swearing-in, even if most would not be able to hear the inaugural address. Jackson came on foot to the ceremony, but to avoid the multitude, he used a basement door on the west front to enter the Capitol; upon exiting to face the crowd, he bowed to great cheers. The scene was described by a witness: As he had entered, Jackson left on the west front of the Capitol, for the crowd had broken the ship's cable and surged forward. He proceeded to mount a white horse and rode up Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. While this happened people were climbing in through the windows to get into the White House. The White House was opened to all for a post-inaugural reception and was filled by the public even before Jackson arrived on horseback. Soon afterward, Jackson left by a window or a side entrance, and proceeded to Gadsby's Hotel in Old Town Alexandria, Virginia. The crowd continued to descend into a drunken mob, only dispersed when bowls of liquor and punch were placed on the front lawn of the White House. \\"I never saw such a mixture,\\" said Joseph Story, then a justice of the Supreme Court: \\"The reign of King Mob seemed triumphant.\\" The White House was left a mess, including several thousand dollars worth of broken china. That night an official inaugural ball for administration officials and Washington's high society was held in Carusi's Assembly Rooms, and it set the stage for the scandal that would become known as the Eaton affair. Twelve hundred guests were present, but President Jackson, fatigued and still mourning the loss of his wife Rachel Jackson that December, was not. Another ball was held in the Central Masonic Hall. However, to be fair, two historians, David, and Jeanne Heidler wrote in 2004 about other contemporary accounts that play down the drunken-brawl aspects of the open house. The Heidlers point out that Hamilton, the Jackson supporter from South Carolina, called the damage from the event \\"trivial.\\" The crowd at the White House was mixed. The first arrivals were the people who made up Washington society. The second crowd that showed up at the mansion was made up of Jackson supporters who were dressed in their best clothes. What happened next doesn't seem to be disputed: The White House wasn't prepared for the crowd as it pressed in through the front door and sought out Jackson, along with the food and whiskey-laced punch. Jackson found himself pressed into a situation with his back to a wall until his people were able to get him away from the crowd, and back to his hotel. The sheer number of people inside the White House led to collisions with furniture and food. After Jackson left, the Heidlers say Antoine Michel Giusta, the White House steward, moved the party outside by taking the punch outside. Other reports indicated that staffers passed punch and ice cream through the White House's windows to the crowd outside. As for the image of a riot of drunken Jackson supporters, the Heidlers believed that the incident was used as a metaphor by Washington society and Jackson's enemies, who feared the new regime and its lower-class roots. \\"Most witnesses, however, mentioned little real damage, and newspapers reported only incidental break-age. Niles' Weekly Register, in fact, merely observed that Jackson had 'received the salutations of a vast number of persons, who came to congratulate him upon his induction to the presidency',\\" said the Heidlers. The story about the cheese happened at the end of Jackson's eight years in office. The president was given a 1,400-pound cheese wheel as a gift, and it sat in the White House for several years. Finally, Jackson allowed the public into the East Room to eat the cheese, which it consumed over several days in 1837. The odors lingered for days after the event.

The one-platoon system, also known as iron man football, is a platoon system in American football where players play on both offense and defense. It was the result of smaller roster sizes in the early days of the game and rules that limited player substitutions, rules that are also standard procedure in many other sports but were eliminated in the 1940s as free substitution was legalized. The alternative system is known as the \\"two- platoon system\\", or simply the \\"platoon system\\", because of its use of separate offensive and defensive units (three platoons if special teams is also counted). Each system was used at different times in American college football and in the National Football League. One-platoon football is seen in modern times mostly on lower-end and smaller teams at the high school and semi-pro levels, where player shortages and talent disparities require it; the system allows teams to play with a smaller roster than a two-platoon or multiple-platoon team, but because players are on the field the entire game with no rest between series, players slow down and become fatigued more quickly in the later stages of a game. As a result, modern teams with sufficient numbers of talented players no longer use the one-platoon system. History Prior to 1941, virtually all football players saw action on \\"both sides of the ball,\\" playing in both offensive and defensive roles. From 1941 to 1952, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) allowed unlimited substitution. This change was originally made because of the difficulty in fielding highly skilled players during the years of the Second World War, in which many able-bodied college-age men volunteered for or were drafted into military service.Douglas S. Looney, One Is More Like It, Sports Illustrated, 3 September 1990, retrieved 20 January 2009. The National Football League followed suit abolishing its substitution restrictions in 1943, for similar reasons. For the 1953 season, the NCAA emplaced a set of new rules requiring the use of a one-platoon system, primarily due to financial reasons.Clarence Munn, Thumbs Down On The One Platoon, Sports Illustrated, 29 November 1954, retrieved 20 January 2009. One source indicated that only one player was allowed to be substituted between plays;K. Adam Powell, Woody Durham, \\"An Era of Change (1963-1968) (Google Books cache), Border Wars: The First Fifty Years of Atlantic Coast Conference Football, Scarecrow Press, 2004, , . however, according to the NCAA, the actual rule allowed a player to enter the game only once in each quarter. Tennessee head coach \\"General\\" Robert Neyland praised the change as the end of \\"chickenshit football\\". The one-platoon rules were gradually liberalized over the next 11 seasons; by 1958, Louisiana State had developed a three-platoon system (a two-way platoon, an offensive platoon, and a defensive platoon known as the Chinese Bandits). O. J. Simpson said after retiring from the NFL in 1979 that when he began playing football the best players played both ways, with the weakest only on defense and stronger players on offense. For the 1964 season, the NCAA repealed the rules enforcing its use and allowed an unlimited number of player substitutions.17 Reasons Why Knute Rockne Wouldn't Recognize This Game, Athlon Sports, retrieved 20 January 2009. This allowed, starting with the 1964 season,Robert C.

The song features distorted guitars, walls of sound, and modern synthesizers. Nu gaze (sometimes called newgaze) refers to a form of alternative rock that originated in the 2000s that is directly influenced by the primarily British shoegaze scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s. A renewed interest in shoegaze occurred in the early 2000s when bands such as Maps, My Vitriol, and Silversun Pickups first emerged across both sides of the Atlantic. The origin of the moniker \\"nu gaze\\" has been credited to an interview in 2001 with My Vitriol frontman Som Wardner in which he denied his band was shoegaze, instead stating humorously, \\"I guess you could call us nu gaze\\". According to an article in The Oxford Student, music from the genre features \\"droning riffs, subdued vocals and walls of distorted, messy guitar or synth\\". The style of the music relies on using various effects such as looping, effects pedals and synthesizers to distort the music. The shoegaze revival draws inspiration heavily from shoegaze but incorporates more modern synthesizers and drum tracks. The ambient guitar band Hammock, based in Nashville, Tennessee is notable for their ambient rock that combines elements of shoegaze and ambient music. Ulrich Schnauss' 2007 album Goodbye demonstrates the influence of techno and ambient music on the Nu Gaze genre.

His posts at ICI included director of research and chairman of the paints division. He was also Master of the Worshipful Company of Salters. Life and career Rose was born in Greasbrough, Rotherham, Yorkshire on 2 January 1911 and was educated at Rotherham Grammar School before matriculating at Jesus College, Oxford in 1929 to study chemistry. He graduated with a BA degree in 1932, and spent a further year in study with Robert Robinson to obtain a post-graduate BSc degree in 1933. A two-year fellowship awarded by the Salters' Company allowed him to continue his research with Robinson in Oxford and to spend a year at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zürich with Leopold Ružička on the structure of abietic acid. In 1935, Rose started work as a research chemist for Imperial Chemical Industries in Blackley, Manchester, where his work included evaluating a new polymer called nylon. During the Second World War, Rose was part of a research group considering the possibilities for new business after the war, although plans to use acetylene as an intermediary for making organic chemicals were not pursued when it became clear that it was uneconomic to do so. In 1949, Rose became associate research manager, and then director of research in 1951; the company's work in this period included research into Procion dyes and Terylene (an artificial fibre). In 1958, he became production director, followed in 1959 by the post of joint managing director (and later chairman) of the paints division. His final appointment within ICI was as research and development director in 1966 (although he spent a period in 1968 to 1969 as chairman of Ilford Photo, which had been acquired jointly by ICI and the Swiss company Ciba). He retired in 1972. He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1971 and vice- president of the Society of Chemical Industry in 1968. After his retirement from ICI, he was a director of Laporte Industries and chairman of the Fulmer Research Institute.

The cast includes Anil Kapoor, Suchitra Krishnamurti, Boman Irani and Nandana Sen. The film is a remake of Telugu film, Madhyanam Hathya directed by Ram Gopal Varma himself. The movie seems to closely follow the story of Horace William Manton, the main accused in the Luton Sack Murder Case.  Plot  Police Inspector Tejpal Randhawa (Boman Irani) is assigned to investigate the case of the dead woman whose body is recovered from a small pond. Insp. Tejpal checks if this matter can be linked with a missing person's report filed by Ravi Patwardhan (Anil Kapoor) and his father-in-law. The dead woman is identified as Sheela (Suchitra Krishnamoorthy), Ravi's wife. According to Ravi, Sheela had left their home to go to visit Shirdi along with her parents. When Ravi is informed by his father-in-law that she had not arrived at their house at all despite 24 hours after her departure, they take the matter seriously and Ravi accompanied his father-in-law go to the nearest police station and file a report that she is missing. Insp. Tejpal concludes that Sheela was waylaid on her way to her parents' house by person(s) unknown, beaten, and her body was left in the pond. But this case puzzles him, as there was no apparent motive for unknown person(s) to waylay her, as no money was taken and her body did not show any sign of sexual molestation. Taking these facts into consideration, Insp. Tejpal starts to disbelieve and suspect Ravi. Ravi's assistant Reena,(Nandana Sen) tries to help Ravi. However, her involvement makes the matter worse for her and her boy-friend Raj, (Rajesh Kapoor), who suspects her to have a relation with her boss Ravi. The movie then takes the audience through a thrilling tale of how Tejpal chases down the fleeing Ravi and ultimately ascertains the truth behind Sheela's murder.  Cast  * Anil Kapoor as Ravi Patwardhan: He is a man whose wife is murdered and he has to make it out of the matter proving himself innocent. * Suchitra Krishnamoorthy as Sheela: Ravi's wife who gets murdered. * Boman Irani as Inspector Tejpal Randhawa: He investigates the case of Sheela's murder. * Nandana Sen: Reena, Ravi's assistant who tries to help Ravi, however, unwillingly gets too much involved making the matter worse for her, her boyfriend and their relationship. * Rajesh Tandon as Raj, Reena's boyfriend. * Abhijeet Lahiri as Sheela's father * Dr Manjali as Sheela's mother * Manish Khanna as Wagle, Tejpal's assistant in the murder case. * Abhay Bhargava as Tapan Banerjee * Meenakshi Verma as Tejpal's wife. * Geetanjali Rao as Ravi's maidservant. * Shankar Sachdeva as Singh. * Lalit Parashar as Hotel owner. * Aloke Shukla as bus conductor. * Master Zain Khan as Karan, Ravi's son. * Baby Maariyah Khatri as Minni, Ravi's daughter.

It had then already been a Phoenician and Mauretanian settlement since the 4th century BC. The city was an important station on the Antonine Itinerary. It was located at approximately 40 km south-west of Tangier, 13 km in the north-east of Asilah, close to the present village of Dshar Jdid.

Background Hugo Ironside was born in Thrapston, Northamptonshire, and educated at St Edward's School, Oxford. He was offered a place at the Royal Air Force College Cranwell, but was warned that, if he joined the RAF, he would probably be dead within two years. Instead, Ironside won a cadetship to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst and was commissioned into the Royal Tank Regiment in 1938. World War II Second Lieutenant Ironside landed at Calais with the 3rd Royal Tank Regiment (3RTR) on 20 May 1940 in the final phase of the battle for the port. Five days later, 3RTR was out of ammunition and petrol. The order was given \\"Every man for himself\\". Ironside and his platoon started marching along the beach towards Dunkirk. They were captured in the early hours of the morning. During the next two weeks, the men were force-marched to Trier, approximately 300 miles away. Food was so scarce for the men that they had to break away from the main group and risk being shot by the guards in order to scrounge food. From Trier, Ironside was moved between Oflag VII-C Laufen (Germany), Stalag XXI-D Poznań (Poland), Oflag V-B Biberach and Oflag VI-B Doessel-Warburg Prisoner of War camps before being sent to Oflag VII-B at Eichstätt, Bavaria. There he helped to work on a tunnel which started in a lavatory in one of the brick blocks. This was used for an escape of over 50 men, who were recaptured and sent to Oflag IV-C, Colditz. Later military service After the war, Ironside continued his military career, alternating between staff and regimental appointments. Ironside was promoted to captain in 1946, and major in 1951.

He was a member of the Parliament of Denmark for the Social Democrats (until 2015) and was Denmark's Minister for Business and Growth until he announced his resignation on 12 October 2012.Ole Sohn stopper som minister, TV 2 Nyhederne.Ole Sohn stepping down, Politiken.dk, October 12, 2012. Early life Ole Sohn was born in Torsted, in Horsens Municipality in Denmark in 1954. In the years 1970-1976 he worked as a ship's cook and an earth and concrete worker. In the years of 1972-1973 he took a Higher Preparatory Examination (HF) and later went to teacher's college. Sohn started his political career young. When he took his HF he was spokesperson for the students during the years of 1972-1973. From the mid-1970s he served in several union offices, among those the central board of the Danish General Workers' Union. The Communist Party Sohn was a member of the Communist Party of Denmark. From 1981 to 1991 he was a member of the party's central committee. He also served as a member of the Horsens city council from 1982 to 1984. From 1987 to 1989 he was a candidate for the parliamentary elections for the communists. From 1989 to 1991 he was a candidate on the ticket of the Red- Green Alliance which the communists had joined. He was elected chairman of the communist party in 1987. This was a time of great internal disagreement, disagreements that would later split the party. In 1987 the communists choose to elect two chairmen instead of one. Sohn was elected chairman together with the trade unionist Jan Andersen who was a communist hardliner who viewed Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms with great skepticism. Sohn was elected to balance out Andersen as a young and dynamic candidate who could represent the Gorbachev faction of the party. The election of two chairmen was meant to symbolize cooperation between the two factions of the party but Andersen died shortly after, leaving the young Sohn with the sole responsibility for settling the internal struggles in the party. Sohn had to deal with the great upheavals in the communist world in the late 1980s. However, he was too young to cope with the old hard-liners in the party. They won the power struggle and in 1990 they deposed him. This led to a party congress where the Sohn faction won and the party was split. However, a year after he left the communist party and joined the Socialist People's Party. The Socialist People's Party Sohn was first elected to parliament on the ticket of the Socialist People's Party in the 1998 election and has been in parliament since. After the 2011 election, Sohn became Minister for Business and Growth. As author Besides his political work, Sohn is an author and publisher. He has written several books on the Soviet Union, using material that has been released from Soviet archives after the breakup of the union. In 2004 he founded the publishing firm Forlaget Sohn. From the 1990s and onwards he has also been active in the Writers' Union.

It depicts the meeting of Duchess Anne and King Charles VIII. The monument was destroyed by Breton separatists in 1932. The union of Brittany and France was a critical step in the formation of modern-day France. Brittany had been a semi-independent component of the Kingdom of France since Clovis I was given authority over the Gallo-Roman domain during the 5th century. It was first recorded as a \\"duchy\\" during the rule of Nominoe in 846.Smith, Julia M. H. Province and Empire: Brittany and the Carolingians. Cambridge University Press: 1992, 97. Over the centuries, the fealty demonstrated by the Duchy of Brittany toward the French king depended significantly on the individuals holding the two titles, as well as the involvement of the English monarchy at that particular time. The reign of Francis II, Duke of Brittany, was at an especially crucial time, as the nobles struggled to maintain their autonomy against the increasing central authority desired by Louis XI of France. As a result of several wars, treaties, and papal decisions, Brittany was united with France through the eventual marriage of Louis XI's son Charles VIII to the heiress of Brittany, Anne in 1491. However, because of the different systems of inheritance between the two realms, the crown and the duchy were not held by the same hereditary claimant until the reign of Henry II, beginning 1547. Historical context =Roman times through the 13th century= According to Julius Caesar, Brittany (fr. Bretagne) was historically part of Celtic Gaul as Armorica (Gaulic for \\"Place by the Sea\\"). On the fall of the Roman Empire, it was integrated into the Gallo-Roman domain of Syagrius. The territory was liberated from imperial control and was awarded by the emperor to Clovis I after his victory at Soissons in 486. Clovis received the titles of Honorary Consul and Patricius, thus assuring the legitimacy of his authority over the ancient Gallo-Roman domain. When Clovis died, Brittany was included in the quarter of the kingdom that was given to his son, Childebert I. In the 9th century, with chaos spreading over Brittany, the Frankish kings, following their policy of partial delegation of power to local representatives (a precursor of the feudal system), nominated administrators of Brittany. Thus Nominoë was designated as Missus Imperatoris (emissary of the emperor) by King Louis the Pious, and then as Ducatus Ipsius Gentismissus of the Bretons, before he rebelled against royal power and obtained a degree of autonomy for Brittany. It has been reported that Louis IV of France (reigned 936–954) stated that Brittany was not part of his kingdom. This was probably because the French king was a close friend of Breton Duke Alan II. Both of them had grown up together at the court of Æthelstan, king of England, as they were in protective exile from King Raoul of France (Louis) and Viking occupation (Alan). Henry II of England (ruled 1154–1189) had attempted to conquer Brittany, which was surrounded on all sides by his possessions, as he held Normandy in his own right and married Eleanor of Aquitaine, thus gaining lands to the south of Brittany. While Henry's maneuvering was partially successful—he became the Count of Nantes, forced Conan IV, Duke of Brittany into abdication, and had Constance, the successor duchess, married to his son Geoffrey—the Duchy of Brittany never became incorporated into the crown of England. =14th and 15th centuries= In the 14th century, the Breton War of Succession between the Breton House of Montfort and the House of Penthièvre could be seen as an episode of the Hundred Years' War between the House of Valois (founded by Charles of Valois, the fourth son of Philip III of France) and the House of Plantagenet (founded by Henry II of England). In the 15th century, the Duchy of Brittany remained an independent and sovereign state led by a sovereign Duke. The more recent dukes of Brittany rendered homage to the French king, although Francis II, Duke of Brittany desired a return to greater independence. After the conclusion of the Hundred Years War, it manifested itself in direct conflicts between the king and the great princes of the kingdom. Francis II sought alliances and established diplomatic relations with England, the Holy See, and the Holy Roman Empire. The French ambassadors contested some of the duchy's moves toward independence and its assertion of historic sovereignty. The territorial expansion of France brought it to the borders of Brittany and led to the goal of overlordship or direct control of the peninsula. From the start of the Breton War of Succession in 1341, France sought this goal and because France never willingly accepted the victory of the opposing prince, battles or wars followed one another until the final French success in 1491, 1532 or 1598, according to different views and different sources. Louis XI felt a great hatred for Francis II of Brittany following the latter's involvement in a number of great conspiracies. Louis and his successors, the regent Anne de Beaujeu and Charles VIII, wished to: * destroy the threat of encirclement of the French kingdom between the Duchy of Burgundy (and subsequently the Burgundian Netherlands and the County of Burgundy, which passed to the archduke of Austria) to the north and east, and Brittany to the west. * consolidate the power of the king in the face of Francis II, who, like the other nobles, had profited from the historic enfeeblement of the monarchy to endue himself with symbols of sovereignty, such as a royal seal, a royal crown, the adoption of the principle of lèse-majesté, the establishment of a sovereign parliament (or court of justice), the establishment of a university (at Nantes), independent and direct diplomatic relations with the then major powers, and the eviction of the King's tax collectors. * punish those nobles, including Francis II, who had fought on the anti-royalist side in multiple conflicts, such as the League of the Public Weal (1465), the conquest of Normandy in 1467-68 for Charles of France (1446–1472), the war of 1471-1473, the Mad War (La Guerre Folle) (1484–85), and the Franco-Breton War (1487–1488). The French Chancery justified its sovereignty over Brittany based on historical precedent: * In 497, Clovis I united the Franks into a single kingdom. * In the late 8th century, Charlemagne incorporated Brittany into the Carolingian Empire. * In the 11th century, William the Conqueror expanded into Brittany. The Breton chroniclers and the Breton Chancellery of the 14th-16th centuries defended the opposite view, arguing mainly from settlement of the territory by Bretons at an earlier date than by the Franks; but conveniently forgetting the lack of a treaty with the Roman Empire permitting the settlement in Brittany and the settlement of the Franks in the Vannes region, as well as agreements with the Frankish kings in authority following the advent of Clovis. They also argued for the sovereignty of Brittany based on its status as an ancient kingdom, although Nominoe, who had won considerable autonomy for the administration of Britain, never had the title of king, and the fact that the homage paid by the dukes to the kings was one of alliance rather than as lieges. This last point was not recognized by the King of France. In the second half of the 15th century, the kings of France had multiple events work to their advantage in the quest to acquire Brittany: * England, a traditional ally of the Counts of Montfort-l'Amaury, was unable to act in force on the continent after being expelled in 1453 at the conclusion of the Hundred Years' War and while embroiled in the subsequent Wars of the Roses. Following this civil war, the new Tudor dynasty did not yet have the resources within England to permit a risky attempt to expand overseas. * Brittany lost another important ally with the 1477 death of the Duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, whose domain was in part incorporated into the French crown and otherwise inherited by his daughter. * The end of the dynasty of Anjou in 1482 gave the king control of the border between Anjou and Brittany. * The Breton nobility had many interests in the kingdom and, like other nobles, those concerning pensions related to their titles. In addition, the nobles envied the influence of the Valois and of the treasurer of the Landes (an administrative division in southern France), who was a simple commoner. * Francis II, Duke of Brittany, had irritated the nobility of Brittany when, as Prince of the Loire Valley, he had from his childhood retained strong ties with the princes of Valois at the French court (hence the unfortunate coalitions during the feudal revolts against the king). *This lack of authority over his upper aristocracy and his government in general deprived Francis II, and later Anne of Brittany, of support. The nobility preferred to respect royal power, and only associated themselves weakly with the revolt of the great feudal lords during the Mad War (La Guerre Folle) revolt against Anne of France's regency. * Francis II had no legitimate male heir, so his two daughters, Anne and Isabeau, were proclaimed heirs before the Estates of Brittany (the Breton council) in conformity with the Duchy's semi-Salic law of inheritance. However, there were other potential claimants: the Viscount of Rohan, the Prince of Orange, Alain d'Albret, and the King of France, who had purchased an inheritance claim from the Penthièvre family (arising from the treaty signed at the end of the Breton War of Succession). =Treaty of Sablé= Following the Battle of Saint-Aubin du Cormier, the Treaty of Sablé, or \\"treaty of the orchard\\", concluded with King Charles VIII of France on 20 August 1488, required the agreement of the French king to any marriage of the daughters of Francis II. The survival of the Breton state was thus contingent on the marriage of Anne of Brittany. Francis II wanted Anne to wed Maximilian I of Austria as a means to (hopefully) ensure the sovereignty of Brittany. Although Francis died in September 1488, his loyal supporters facilitated this union for Anne in a marriage by proxy held 19 December 1490. Unfortunately, this violated the Treaty of Sablé as the king of France did not consent to this marriage, and it also placed the rule of Brittany in the hands of an enemy of France. As a result, France resumed its armed conflict with Brittany. The spring of 1491 brought new successes by the French general La Trémoille, and Charles VIII of France came to lay siege to Rennes. Maximilian failed to come to his bride's assistance (the Habsburgs were too busy in Hungary to pay serious attention to Brittany), and Rennes fell. Anne became engaged to Charles in the vault of the Jacobins in Rennes and traveled to Langeais to be married. Although Austria made diplomatic protests, claiming that the marriage was illegal because the bride was unwilling, that she was already legally married to Maximilian, and that Charles was legally betrothed to Margaret of Austria (Maximilian's daughter), Anne was wed to Charles VIII on 6 December 1491. The marriage was subsequently validated by Pope Innocent VIII on 15 February 1492. The King of France as Duke of Brittany jure uxoris Charles VIII became Duke of Brittany jure uxoris upon his marriage to Anne of Brittany. During their marriage, Charles prohibited Anne from using the title of Duchess of Brittany, and imposed his own rule on the Duchy through a Royal Governor from the House of Penthièvre. However, when the king died leaving the royal couple childless, the Duchy of Brittany reverted to Anne. She returned to Brittany and re-established her independent rule. Anne's actions underscored that the Duke of Brittany's line of succession was governed by the Celtic nation's peculiar form of Semi-Salic Law rather than the strict Salic Law governing the Kingdom of France. Her actions also demonstrated that the Duke of Brittany and the King of France, at least at this time, remained distinct and separable titles. Charles VIII's successor, Louis XII, also married Anne of Brittany, and thus the title of Duke of Brittany jure uxoris was once again in the person of the king of France. In this marriage, however, Anne was allowed to use her title, and Louis enacted all official actions in Brittany in her name. When Anne died in January 1514, her and Louis' daughter Claude inherited the Duchy of Brittany in her own right. In May 1514, the title of Duke of Brittany jure uxoris was again extant through Claude's marriage to her cousin Francis, Duke of Angoulême, heir to the throne of France. Louis XII died in January 1515, at which time Francis was crowned king of France (as Francis I), with Claude as his queen consort. The King of France as hereditary Duke of Brittany The Union of Brittany and France was nearly perfected through Francis III, Duke of Brittany, the eldest son of Francis I of France and Claude of France, and therefore the Dauphin of France. Francis III inherited the Duchy when he was 6 years old after the death of his mother in 1524. That Francis I allowed his eldest son to carry the title of the Duke of Brittany supports the perception that the Duchy of Brittany remained separate from the Kingdom of France. However, before the kingship and dukedom could be joined in one person, Francis III died in 1536, never to inherit the French crown. The duchy then passed to Henry, the second son of Francis I and Claude. When Francis I died in 1547, Henry succeeded him as Henry II of France, and the kingdom and dukedom were united in ruler. Francis I also sought to enfold Brittany into the Kingdom of France through parliamentary maneuvers. Francis formally invited the Duchy of Brittany to join the French crown. On 13 August 1532, an edict of union was signed by the Estates of Brittany in Nantes.Bertrand Frélaut. Histoire de Vannes. Éditions Jean-Paul Gisserot, 2000. Page 46. .Yves Henri Nouailhat. Bretagne: écologie, économie, art, littérature, langue, histoire, traditions populaires, vol. 16. d'Encyclopédies régionales. C. Bonneton, 1979. Page 27. Some members of the parliament (the Estates of Brittany) were either intimidated into co-operation with the union or bought off, with the demand for union in fact being inspired by Francis I.Jean-Pierre Leguay. La fin de l'indépendance bretonne (volume 6), Fastes et malheurs de la Bretagne ducale 1213-1532, Ouest-France Université, 1992. Page 435. . It has been argued that the legal validity of the union is doubtful on such grounds.http://www.gwalarn.org/diellou/1532.pdf Louis Melennec, doctoral dissertation on the union between Brittany and France Regardless of the validity of the Edict of Union of 1532, four years later in 1536, Henry became the Duke of Brittany upon the death of his brother. Thereby the Duchy of Brittany was considered incorporated into the Kingdom of France upon the death of his mother.Christophe Levantal. Ducs et pairs et duchés- pairies laïques à l'époque moderne : (1519-1790). Maisonneuve & Larose, coll. Mémoires de France, 1996. Pages 479-481. .A Short History of Brittany The crowns of Brittany and France differed principally in the application of Salic Law, and this difference remained to challenge the permanent union of the two crowns. Before this legal challenge ever surfaced, however, centuries passed, and King Louis XVI of France, who remained Duke of Brittany in his own right, was deposed and beheaded during the French Revolution. The Revolution eliminated royalty, nobility, and any vestiges of a governing sovereign for both the Kingdom of France and the Duchy of Brittany, and the parliament of Brittany remains suppressed to modern times. Political and economic factors The duchy could only submit, in spite of its occasional resistance, in the face of one of Europe's strongest armies. The Breton elite were attracted by France's royal court, but the Breton merchant bourgeoisie in Saint-Malo did not identify with the interests of the Dukes of Brittany. Aftermath of the Union of Brittany and France The union of Brittany and France was a critical step in the formation of modern-day France. Geographically, the union resulted in France's northwestern border becoming the English Channel and its western border, as far south as the Pyrenees Mountains, becoming the Atlantic Ocean, save for island territories and colonies. Politically this unification marked the end to over 1000 years of efforts by various Kings of England to control Brittany, and thwarted later efforts by the King of Spain to establish a foothold there. Throughout its history the Kingdom of Brittany and then the Duchy of Brittany constantly sought independence from Merovingian Kings, Carolingian Emperors, Viking invaders, Norman Dukes, and English, French and Spanish Kings alike. Strong movements for autonomy and even Separatist movements persist in Brittany to modern times, accelerated in part by France's decision to become a leading member of the European Union. The history of the Union of Brittany and France is also incomplete without an understanding that Henry II of France worked to retain the separate legal status of the Duchy even while he, in his person, represented the final step towards the unification. His motivation stemmed from the possibility that if a war involving France were to be lost, he, or his successor, would still hold the Duchy of Brittany as a means to preserve their royal status and function. After union to the French crown the Duchy of Brittany was able to maintain certain privileges and symbolic independence. The Estates of Brittany continued to function independently of the Estates of France. The second son of Francis I of France, Henry II of France, attempted to preserve a legally separate Duchy, and it is felt by some historians that he did this to preserve the region as a sovereign haven for himself during a period when France was at war with Spain.

It has special properties including a high level of brightness and uniform molecular-weight distribution. This pulp is manufactured for uses that require a high chemical purity, and particularly low hemicellulose content, since the chemically similar hemicellulose can interfere with subsequent processes. Dissolving pulp is so named because it is not made into paper, but dissolved either in a solvent or by derivatization into a homogeneous solution, which makes it completely chemically accessible and removes any remaining fibrous structure. Once dissolved, it can be spun into textile fibers (viscose or Lyocell), or chemically reacted to produce derivatized celluloses, such cellulose triacetate, a plastic-like material formed into fibers or films, or cellulose ethers such as methyl cellulose, used as a thickener. Manufacture =Pulpwood= Dissolving pulp is mainly produced chemically from pulpwood in a process that has a low yield (30 - 35% of the wood). This makes up of about 85 - 88% of the production. Dissolving pulp is made from the sulfite process or the kraft process with an acid prehydrolysis step to remove hemicelluloses. For the highest quality, it should be derived from fast-grown hardwoods with low non-cellulose content. The sulfite process produces pulp with a cellulose content up to 92 percent. It can use ammonium, calcium, magnesium or sodium as a base. The prehydrolysis sulfate process produces pulp with a cellulose content up to 96%. Special alkaline purification treatments can yield even higher cellulose levels: up to 96 percent for the sulfite process and up to 98 percent for the sulfate process. =Cotton linters= A minor part is produced from the shortest cotton linters, normally second cut. These are washed mechanically and chemically to remove proteins, waxes, pectins and other polysaccharides. This is bleached to get the required brightness. Dissolving pulp from cellulose linters gives the purest cellulose and is used to manufacture acetate plastics and high-viscosity cellulose ethers. Applications Dissolving pulp is used in production of regenerated cellulose. In the regenerated cellulose process the cellulose is converted to cellulose xanthate which dissolves easily in caustic soda. The resulting viscous liquid can be extruded through spinnerettes and regenerated as man- made fibres. Cellulose can also be dissolved in some organic solvents directly and processed to regenerate the cellulose fibres in different forms. The lyocell process uses an amine oxide to dissolve cellulose and Tencel is the only commercial example of this direct-dissolution process, which unlike the viscose process is pollution-free. The 90-92% cellulose content sulfite pulps are used mostly to make textiles (like rayon) and cellophane. The 96-% cellulose content sulfate pulps are used to make rayon yarn for industrial products such as tire cord, rayon staple for high-quality fabrics, and various acetate and other specialty products. As a raw material of cellulose derivatives, dissolving pulp is used in carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), methyl cellulose (MC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), etc. Since dissolving pulp is highly refined, it is a product of high whiteness with few impurities making it suitable in specialty paper-related products such as filter paper and vulcanized fibre. Cellulose powder is dissolving pulp that has undergone acid hydrolysis, been mechanically disintegrated and made into fine powder. This pulp is used as a filler for urea-formaldehyde resins and melamine resin products.

His philanthropic works, administrative abilities and management of his estate (Raj Darbhanga) were highly appreciated and lead to development of his estate. Biography Lakshmeshwar Singh was the eldest son of Maharaja Maheshwar Singh of Darbhanga, who died when Lakshmeshwar was aged two. The British Raj placed the estate of Darbhanga under the control of the Court of Wards because the heirs to the estate were minors. He was placed under the tutorship of Chester Macnaghten, who later served as the founding Principal of the oldest Public school in India, the Rajkumar College, Rajkot from 1870 to 1896. For the next 19 years, till he attained majority, he was caught in political one-upmanship between his mother, who was supported by family priests, and the Tutors appointed by the British Government, who wanted him to be free from Zenana influence. He along with his younger brother Rameshwar Singh (who became Maharaja of Darbhanga after Lakshmeshwar Singh's death) received a western education from Government appointed tutors as well as a traditional Indian education from a Sanskrit Pandit, one of his uncles, a Maulvi and a Bengali gentleman. During the period when Lakshmeshwar Singh was under the guardianship of the Court of Wards, he received a monthly allowance of Rs.5 a month even though the annual income of his estate was equivalent to a six digit figure in pounds sterling.Biography of an Indian Patriot: Maharajah Lakshmishwar Singh of Darbhanga – Author Jata Shankar Jha On attaining his majority, Lakshmeshwar Singh devoted himself entirely to public duties of his position. He was appointed and served as a Member of the Legislative Council of the Viceroy, and took a leading part in the debates of that body. During the lengthened discussions on the important Bengal Tenancy Bill, he acted (in conjunction at first with the lamented patriot, Kristodas Pal, and subsequently with the Raja Piari Mohan Mukharji, (C.S.I.) as the representative of the landowners of Bengal and Behar and received warm recognition of the ability and moderation he brought to bear on this and other questions from successive Viceroys. He was also a member of the Royal Commission on Opium of 1895, formed by British Government along with Haridas Viharidas Desai who was the Diwan of Junagadh. The Royal Opium Commission consisted of a 9-member team of which 7 were British and 2 were Indians and its chairman was Earl Brassey.^ Royal Opium Commission, First Report of the Royal Commission on Opium: with Minutes of Evidence and Appendices, Eyre & Spottiswolde for HM Stationery Office, 1895 Lakshmeshwar Singh championed freedom of speech, personal and political rights. In 1898, he and W. C. Banerjee, were the only prominent Indians to publicly criticise and fight against the proposed widening of scope of section 124-A and 153-A of the Indian Penal Code that was meant to suppress freedom of press in reporting news that could be deemed seditious in nature or against Government policy and insertion of section 108 in Indian Penal Code that gave right to postal authorities to seize any material that was suspected of containing matter obnoxious to section 124-A and 153-A of Indian Penal Code.All India Political Parties, (major groups, A-Z) at page 244. Author – O. P. Ralhan Lakshmeshwar Singh died on 17 December 1898. He did not have any children and thus his younger brother, Rameshwar Singh, succeeded him as Maharaja Public charity Lithograph Print of Maharaja Lakshmeshwar Singh published in Graphic Magazine, December 1888 Maharaja Lakshmeshwar Singh spent approximately £300,000 on relief work during the Bihar famine of 1873–74. He constructed hundreds of miles of roads in various parts of the Raj, planting them with tens of thousands of trees for the comfort of travellers, as part of generating employment for people effected by famine. He constructed iron bridges over all the navigable rivers of the Raj Darbhanga, and completed an elaborate system of irrigation works, for prevention of famine. The lakes, ponds, dams, and other water bodies created during his rule still exist today and form important part in irrigation in northern Bihar. In addition to the £300,000 expended in charitable relief during the Bihar famine of 1873–74, in every time of scarcity the late Maharaja's arrangements for meeting it were on a splendid scale, and were in many cases the models for the Government measures. He built, and entirely supported, a first-class Dispensary at Darbhanga, which cost £3400; a similar one at Kharakpur, which cost £3500 ; and largely contributed to many others.Imperial gazetteer of India available at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V11_169.gif. He built an Anglo-vernacular school at a cost of £1490, which he maintained, as well as nearly thirty vernacular schools of different grades; and subsidised a much larger number of educational institutions.Non—fictional Indian prose in English, 1960–1990 By Hetukar Jha, Sahitya Akademi Most of the late Maharaja's munificence was devoted to objects of charity pure and simple, such as famine relief, medical aid, and the like. But he also contributed very largely to objects of general public utility — as, for instance, in the gift of Rs.50,000 to the funds of the Imperial Institute. It was computed that during his possession of the Raj an aggregate sum of something like two millions sterling was expended on charities, works of public utility, and charitable remissions of rent.Biography of an Indian patriot, Maharaja Lakshmishwar Singh of Darbhanga The late Maharaja devoted special attention to all agricultural improvements, and especially to improvements in the breeds of horses and cattle in Bihar. He was a liberal patron of the turf, and was the owner of the largest and most valuable racing stud in India. He was also a keen sportsman.The Journal of the Bihar Research Society, Volume 48 The Maharaja was also one of the founders of Indian National Congress as well as one of the main financial contributor theretoA Centenary history of the Indian National Congress, 1885–1985, Volume 1 by B.

Granular is based on PCLinuxOS and comes as an installable live CD. The CD version of Granular features two desktop environments  KDE and a development version of Enlightenment. Where KDE is a full-featured desktop environment, Enlightenment is a lightweight desktop shell which is markedly faster than KDE. Granular v0.25 was the first release that featured two desktop environments - KDE and Xfce  History  Granular has its roots in India. The Granular Linux Project kicked off in October 2006, when its first demonstration was given to some college students. The first release that was made available for download on 30 December 2006. The main idea behind the birth of the project, was to redefine the application set included in PCLinuxOS to some extent and to introduce the idea of having more than one major desktop environment on a single LiveCD. The latter idea was implemented beginning from the second version release of Granular - version 0.25 - where two desktop environments (KDE and Xfce) were included, KDE being highly customizable and feature-rich but resource heavy, and Xfce being a light- weight yet feature-full desktop environment. After v0.25, came out v0.90, and finally v1.0. Granular 1.0 (code name Esto Vox) was the last of the \\"Esto\\" series; the first was 0.90 (Esto Vello). In October 2007, a special DVD edition of Granular 0.90 was released with the name \\"FunWorks\\", which featured the LG3D desktop environment along with three others and a host of many other software and games. Granular utilizes the PCLinuxOS repository and its own as well for software/package management. Granular's own repository was opened in March 2008, and since then, it has been a source of all Granular-specific RPM packages, some of which are not available in the PCLinuxOS repository.  Features  Granular comes as a LiveCD, which means you don't have to install it to try it. The standard CD version of Granular includes two desktop environments - KDE and Enlightenment 17. Like PCLinuxOS, Granular uses Synaptic Package Manager, a GUI frontend to APT, for package management (installing, updating, or removing packages). Granular comes with a Perl-based script mklivecd which makes it possible to remaster Granular or create a backup CD/DVD out of the installed system. It also included Granular StartPoint, which is a HTML-based and acts as a primer to the various major software included in Granular.

Field Guide to Meteors and Meteorites, Springer-Verlag, London 2008 Only about 200 E-Type chondrites are currently known. Origin E-type chondrites are among the most chemically reduced rocks known, with most of their iron taking the form of metal or sulfide rather than an oxide. They tend to be high in the mineral enstatite (MgSiO3), from which they derive their name. Based on spectral analysis, it has been suggested that the asteroid 16 Psyche may be the common parent for this type of meteorite. Composition Saint-Sauveur meteorite, enstatite chondrite. Muséum de Toulouse. Unlike most other chondrites, the minerals in enstatite chondrites contain almost no iron oxide; they are the most oxygen-poor silicate rocks known. They were supposed to be the driest objects in the solar system but a recent study show they contain sufficient hydrogen to have delivered to Earth at least three times the mass of water in its oceans.Earth’s water may have been inherited from material similar to enstatite chondrite meteorites Metallic Fe-Ni (iron-nickel) and Fe-bearing sulfide minerals contain nearly all of the iron in this type of meteorite. Enstatite chondrites contain a variety of unusual minerals that can only form in extremely reducing conditions, including oldhamite (CaS), niningerite (MgS), perryite (Fe-Ni silicide), and alkali sulfides (e.g., djerfisherite and caswellsilverite). All enstatite chondrites are dominantly composed of enstatite-rich chondrules plus abundant grains of metal and sulfide minerals. Dusty matrix material is uncommon and refractory inclusions are very rare. Chemically, enstatite chondrites are very low in refractory lithophile elements. Their oxygen isotopic compositions are intermediate between ordinary and carbonaceous chondrites, and are similar to rocks found on the Earth and Moon. Their lack of oxygen content may mean that they were originally formed near the center of the solar nebula that created the solar system, possibly within the orbit of Mercury. Most enstatite chondrites have experienced thermal metamorphism on the parent asteroids. They are divided into two groups: * EH (high-iron) chondrites contain small chondrules (~) and high ratios of siderophile elements to silicon. Somewhat more than 10% of the rock is composed of metal grains. A diagnostic feature of EH chondrites is that the Fe-Ni metal contains ~3 wt% elemental silicon. * EL (low-iron) chondrites contain larger chondrules (>), and low ratios of siderophile elements to silicon. Fe-Ni metal contains ~1 wt% silicon. Superlatives The largest known recorded E-type chondrite fall happened in the town of Abee, in Alberta in 1952. The stone fell in a farmer's wheat field, creating an impact pit 0.7 m in diameter and 1.5 m deep.Griffin, A. A., Millman, P. M., & Halliday, I. \\"The Fall of the Abee Meteorite and its Probable Orbit\\", Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, Journal (ISSN 0035-872X), vol. 86, p.8 Feb. 1992. Based on estimates of its velocity and inclination, it is thought to have arrived on a relatively low-speed, low-inclination orbit that had a perihelion near 0.95 AU and an aphelion probably close to 2.74 AU.Griffin, A. A., Millman, P. M., & Halliday, I. \\"The Fall of the Abee Meteorite and its Probable Orbit\\", Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, Journal (ISSN 0035-872X), vol. 86, p.11 Feb. 1992.

Description The Sulawesi dwarf elephant (Stegoloxodon celebensis or Elephas celebensis) was about half the size of Archidiskodon (=Mammuthus) planifrons to which it was initially considered to be related by Dirk Albert Hooijer in 1949.Hooijer, D.A .(1949). Pleistocene Vertebrates from Celebes. IV. - Archidiskodon celebensis nov spec. Zoologische Mededelingen, Museum Leiden 30: 205–226. The most evident difference with the latter is the presence of functional lower tusks in some individuals. This was considered as paedomorphosis, a retention of juvenile characters in the adult stage, by Vincent Maglio in his revision of the proboscideans in 1973.Maglio, V.J. (1973). Origin and evolution of the Elephantidae. Transactions of the American Philosophical Society Philadelphia Volume 63. American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia. Pp. 149 He based his conclusion on the presence of vestigial incisive germs in mandibles of Mammuthus planifrons. This idea was followed by Hooijer in 1974.Hooijer, D.A. (1974). Elephas celebensis (Hooijer) from the Pleistocene of Java. Zoologische Mededelingen, Museum Leiden, 48: 85–93. Ancestry and taxonomy The retention of functional lower tusks is, however, not seen in juveniles of otherwise single paired tuskers, so cannot be considered a paedomorphic feature proper. It is simply a retention of a primitive character, as seen in the African elephantid genera Primelephas and Stegotetrabelodon, and possibly the earliest forms of Elephas planifrons. Between the late 1980s and early 1990s, an Indonesian-Dutch team excavated more material, including a fairly complete but rather distorted skull. All material, new as well as old, is described and revised in Van den Bergh’s thesis of 1999 on the Indonesian elephantoids, with a discussion on taxonomy.Bergh, G.D. van den, 1999.

Faunal evolution and the mammalian biostratigraphy of Java. Courier Forschungsinstitut Senckenberg 69: 219-235. Van den Bergh accepts a possible relation with “Elephas” indonesicus from Ci Pangglosoran near Bumiayu on Java, dated to the same geological period. Also this specimen was originally assigned to Elephas (= Mammuthus) planifrons, but was later renamed Stegoloxodon indonesicus by Kretzoi in 1950.Kretzoi, M., 1950.

Since September 2015, he also joined Angra, replacing Kiko Loureiro, who is now a member of Megadeth. Biography Barbosa began playing electric guitar when he was 11 years old. He was studying with several teachers, mainly with Allan Marshall. At 17 years old he already was a professional musician and a musical teacher in two musical schools in his home city Brasília. He then decided to establish his own one, focused on the electric guitar. Besides organizing work and managing other teachers, Barbosa established his own entire approach instead of copying or adapting any already existed one and he wrote all the didactic material. Barbosa also attended classes and workshops of musicians like Greg Howe, Lula Galvão, Hélio Delmiro, Toninho Horta, Guinga, Ian Guest among others. In 2002 he finished summer courses in the famous Berklee College of Music. As a result he was chosen with other 11 students to receive a scholarship for the college's regular course. However, it was not possible to continue due to GTR and his other responsibilities. Some time before that Barbosa became a member of Brasília pop rock band Zero10.

Later on, he would restart the band Khallice, which played the progressive metal he always liked. In September 2007, Barbosa was invited to join the band Almah formed by some members of Angra and he went into a national tour with the band. By spring 2008 the line-up of Almah was finally established. In the end of April 2008 the recording of new Almah album Fragile Equality started at Norcal studios (São Paulo) and finished in July 2008. Barbosa writes articles for important guitar magazines in Brazil like Guitar Class, Cover Guitarra and Guitar Player. Some time ago Barbosa wrote a book about technique to the \\"Toque de Mestre\\" series, published by HMP. Barbosa is endorsed by Ibanez, Elixir Strings, Nig pedals and Ibox. On Expomusic 2006 (a big musical exhibition in São Paulo) one of the most important guitar brands in Brazilian market TAGIMA released new MB-1, the guitar designed with Barbosa's specifications, which belongs to the select team of \\"Signature Series\\" of the company.  GTR  Nowadays his institute GTR is one of the biggest guitar schools in Latin America. GTR have already graduated over 4.000 students, with more than 600 people studying in two different units of GTR (Asa Norte and Asa Sul). Besides electric guitar, there are the courses of vocals, acoustic guitar, production, musical business and others. A number of events are frequently organized by GTR like festivals and workshops with musicians like Sidney Carvalho, Kiko Loureiro, Edu Ardanuy among others. To its 10th anniversary, GTR released a special 14 tracks CD recorded by some of the most prominent teachers. Marcelo Barbosa (guitars): GTR is a project I've worked already for twelve years at. It began like a guitar Institute but now we have classes for bassists, vocalists and acoustic guitar players too. I’m responsible for all the didactic material of the guitar course and we have more than six hundred students in three schools. Four years ago I decided to franchise GTR and some people got interested and now we have three schools in Brasília. (...) It is relatively big. We have many students and it’s growing up year by year. We try to teach music, not only one specific style or genre. Rock, Metal, Jazz, Country and Brazilian music is some of the approaches here.

In the Soda-AQ process, anthraquinone (AQ) may be used as a pulping additive to decrease the carbohydrate degradation. The soda process gives pulp with lower tear strength than other chemical pulping processes (sulfite process and kraft process), but has still limited use for easy pulped materials like straw and some hardwoods. History A precursor to the soda pulping process was the paper making process developed by Matthias Koops in 1801 which involved washing wood shavings in limewater, adding soda crystals and then boiling the mixture. Soda pulping was one of the first chemical pulping methods and was invented in 1851 by Burgess (United States) and Watts (England). In France in 1852 Coupier and Mellier patented a soda process based on a 1851 invention the patent of which preceded that of Watt and Burgess, which was filed in 1854. The first mill was started in 1866 in the USA. In 1865 they patented a method for recovery of the cooking liquors by incineration of the spent liquor. Many of the early soda mills converted to kraft mills once it was discovered.. Production Around 5%-10% of paper production worldwide is produced from agricultural crops, valuing agricultural paper production at between $5 billion and $10 billion. The most notable of these agricultural crops are wheat straw and bagasse. Using agricultural crops rather than wood has the added advantage of reducing deforestation. Due to the ease with which bagasse can be chemically pulped, bagasse requires less bleaching chemicals than wood pulp to achieve a bright, white sheet of paper. Most chemical bagasse pulp mills concentrate the spent reaction chemicals and combust them to power the paper-mills and to recover the reaction chemicals. =As solution for silicate scaling= Many grasses, bagasse, bamboo and some tropical hardwoods contain much silicates that may cause sodium aluminum silicate scales. Moderate amounts of silicates can be controlled with purging lime mud or lime kiln ash. Silicate removal from green liquor in a soda mill can be achieved by lowering the pH of the liquor with CO2-containing flue gases from the lime kiln or other sources. No commercial silicate removal system is available for the kraft process, but it can handle the small amounts of silicates from northern woods..

It used an optical disc that stored 170,000 word-for-word and statement-for-statement translations and a custom computer to look them up at high speed. Built for the US Air Force's Foreign Technology Division, the AN/GSQ-16 (or XW-2), as it was known to the Air Force, was primarily used to convert Soviet technical documents for distribution to western scientists. The translator was installed in 1959, dramatically upgraded in 1964, and was eventually replaced by a mainframe running SYSTRAN in 1970. History =Photoscopic store= The translator began in a June 1953 contract from the US Navy to the International Telemeter Corporation (ITC) of Los Angeles. This was not for a translation system, but a pure research and development contract for a high-performance photographic online storage medium consisting of small black rectangles embedded in a plastic disk. When the initial contract ran out, what was then the Rome Air Development Center (RADC) took up further funding in 1954 and onwards.Hutchins, pg. 171 The system was developed by Gilbert King, chief of engineering at ITC, along with a team that included Louis Ridenour. It evolved into a 16-inch plastic disk with data recorded as a series of microscopic black rectangles or clear spots. Only the outermost 4 inches of the disk were used for storage, which increased the linear speed of the portion being accessed. When the disk spun at 2,400 RPM it had an access speed of about 1 Mbit/sec. In total, the system stored 30 Mbits, making it the highest density online system of its era. =Mark I= In 1954 IBM gave an influential demonstration of machine translation, known today as the \\"Georgetown-IBM experiment\\". Run on an IBM 704 mainframe, the translation system knew only 250 words of Russian limited to the field of organic chemistry, and only 6 grammar rules for combining them. Nevertheless, the results were extremely promising, and widely reported in the press.John Hutchins, \\"The first public demonstration of machine translation: the Georgetown-IBM system, 7th January 1954\\" At the time, most researchers in the nascent machine translation field felt that the major challenge to providing reasonable translations was building a large library, as storage devices of the era were both too small and too slow to be useful in this role.Hutchins, pg. 172 King felt that the photoscopic store was a natural solution to the problem, and pitched the idea of an automated translation system based on the photostore to the Air Force. RADC proved interested, and provided a research grant in May 1956. At the time, the Air Force also provided a grant to researchers at the University of Washington who were working on the problem of producing an optimal translation dictionary for the project. King advocated a simple word-for-word approach to translations. He thought that the natural redundancies in language would allow even a poor translation to be understood, and that local context was alone enough to provide reasonable guesses when faced with ambiguous terms. He stated that \\"the success of the human in achieving a probability of .50 in anticipating the words in a sentence is largely due to his experience and the real meanings of the words already discovered.\\"King, 1956 In other words, simply translating the words alone would allow a human to effectively read a document, because they would be able to reason out the proper meaning from the context provided by earlier words. In 1958 King moved to IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center, and continued development of the photostore-based translator. Over time, King changed the approach from a pure word-for-word translator to one that stored \\"stems and endings\\", which broke words into parts that could be combined back together to form complete words again. The first machine, \\"Mark I\\", was demonstrated in July 1959 and consisted of a 65,000 word dictionary and a custom tube-based computer to do the lookups. Texts were hand-copied onto punched cards using custom Cyrillic terminals, and then input into the machine for translation. The results were less than impressive, but were enough to suggest that a larger and faster machine would be a reasonable development. In the meantime, the Mark I was applied to translations of the Soviet newspaper, Pravda. The results continued to be questionable, but King declared it a success, stating in Scientific American that the system was \\"...found, in an operational evaluation, to be quite useful by the Government.\\" =Mark II= On 4 October 1957 the USSR launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite. This caused a wave of concern in the US, whose own Project Vanguard was caught flat-footed and then proved to repeatedly fail in spectacular fashion. This embarrassing turn of events led to a huge investment in US science and technology, including the formation of DARPA, NASA and a variety of intelligence efforts that would attempt to avoid being surprised in this fashion again. After a short period, the intelligence efforts centralized at the Wright Patterson Air Force Base as the Foreign Technology Division (FTD, now known as the National Air and Space Intelligence Center), run by the Air Force with input from the DIA and other organizations. FTD was tasked with the translation of Soviet and other Warsaw Bloc technical and scientific journals so researchers in the \\"west\\" could keep up to date on developments behind the Iron Curtain. Most of these documents were publicly available, but FTD also made a number of one-off translations of other materials upon request. Assuming there was a shortage of qualified translators, the FTD became extremely interested in King's efforts at IBM. Funding for an upgraded machine was soon forthcoming, and work began on a \\"Mark II\\" system based around a transistorized computer with a faster and higher-capacity 10 inch glass-based optical disc spinning at 2,400 RPM. Another addition was an optical character reader provided by the third party, which they hoped would eliminate the time-consuming process of copying the Russian text into machine-readable cards. In 1960 the Washington team also joined IBM, bringing their dictionary efforts with them. The dictionary continued to expand as additional storage was made available, reaching 170,000 words and terms by the time it was installed at the FTD. A major software update was also incorporated in the Mark II, which King referred to as \\"dictionary stuffing\\". Stuffing was an attempt to deal with the problems of ambiguous words by \\"stuffing\\" prefixes onto them from earlier words in the text. These modified words would match with similarly stuffed words in the dictionary, reducing the number of false positives. In 1962 King left IBM for Itek, a military contractor in the process of rapidly acquiring new technologies. Development at IBM continued, and the system went fully operational at FTD in February 1964. The system was demonstrated at the 1964 New York World's Fair. The version at the Fair included a 150,000 word dictionary, with about 1/3 of the words in phrases. About 3,500 of these were stored in core memory to improve performance, and an average speed of 20 words per minute was claimed. The results of the carefully selected input text was quite impressive.Hutchins, pg. 174 After its return to the FTD, it was used continually until 1970, when it was replaced by a machine running SYSTRAN.Hutchins, pg. 175 =ALPAC Report= In 1964 the United States Department of Defense commissioned the United States National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to prepare a report on the state of machine translation. The NAS formed the \\"Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee\\", or ALPAC, and published their findings in 1966. The report, Language and Machines: Computers in Translation and Linguistics, was highly critical of the existing efforts, demonstrating that the systems were no faster than human translations, while also demonstrating that the supposed lack of translators was in fact a surplus, and as a result of supply and demand issues, human translation was relatively inexpensive  about $6 per 1,000 words. Worse, the FTD was slower as well; tests using physics papers as input demonstrated that the translator was \\"10 percent less accurate, 21 percent slower, and had a comprehension level 29 percent lower than when he used human translation.\\"ALPAC, pg. 20 The ALPAC report was as influential as the Georgetown experiment had been a decade earlier; in the immediate aftermath of its publication, the US government suspended almost all funding for machine translation research.John Hutchins, \\"ALPAC: the (in)famous report\\" Ongoing work at IBM and Itek had ended by 1966, leaving the field to the Europeans, who continued development of systems like SYSTRAN and Logos.

It applies the same idea to the parity check matrix, H, of a linear code. Niederreiter is equivalent to McEliece from a security point of view. It uses a syndrome as ciphertext and the message is an error pattern. The encryption of Niederreiter is about ten times faster than the encryption of McEliece. Niederreiter can be used to construct a digital signature scheme. Scheme definition A special case of Niederreiter's original proposal was broken but the system is secure when used with a Binary Goppa code. =Key generation= #Alice selects a binary (n, k)-linear Goppa code, G, capable of correcting t errors. This code possesses an efficient decoding algorithm. #Alice generates a (n − k) × n parity check matrix, H, for the code, G. #Alice selects a random (n − k) × (n − k) binary non-singular matrix, S. #Alice selects a random n × n permutation matrix, P. #Alice computes the (n − k) × n matrix, Hpub = SHP. #Alice’s public key is (Hpub, t); her private key is (S, H, P). = Message encryption = Suppose Bob wishes to send a message, m, to Alice whose public key is (Hpub, t): #Bob encodes the message, m, as a binary string em' of length n and weight at most t. #Bob computes the ciphertext as c = HpubeT. = Message decryption = Upon receipt of c = HpubmT from Bob, Alice does the following to retrieve the message, m. #Alice computes S−1c = HPmT. #Alice applies a syndrome decoding algorithm for G to recover PmT. #Alice computes the message, m, via mT = P−1PmT.  Signature scheme Courtois, Finiasz and Sendrier showed how the Niederreiter cryptosystem can be used to derive a signature scheme . # Hash the document, d, to be signed (with a public hash algorithm). # Decrypt this hash value as if it were an instance of ciphertext. # Append the decrypted message to the document as a signature. Verification then applies the public encryption function to the signature and checks whether or not this equals the hash value of the document. When using Niederreiter, or in fact any cryptosystem based on error correcting codes, the second step in the signature scheme almost always fails. This is because a random syndrome usually corresponds to an error pattern of weight greater than t. The system then specifies a deterministic way of tweaking d until one is found which can be decrypted. The choice of the code parameters is related to the probability that a random syndrome is decodable. Courtois, Finiaz, and Sendrier suggest the parameter values n = 216 and t = 9. Then the probability to decode a random syndrome is \\\\frac{1}{9!}. Therefore, a decodable syndrome is found after an expected number of 9! attempts. Add a counter, i, to the original document d, to produce a slightly altered document, di. Hashing di gives a syndrome that depends on i. Let i run from 0 to i0, with i0 the first value of i for which di is decodable. In this case the decrypted message is a word, z, of length n and weight 9, such that HzT equals the hash value of di0. The signature will be z combined with the value i0 for verification. This signature is attached to the original document, d.  References  * Henk C. A. van Tilborg. Fundamentals of Cryptology, 11.4.

The project will establish the technological building-blocks needed for the evolution of today’s diverse G2P databases into a future seamless G2P biomedical knowledge environment, by the projects end. This will consist of a European-centred but globally networked hierarchy of bioinformatics GRID-linked databases, tools and standards, all tied into the Ensembl genome browser. The project has the following specific objectives: * To analyse the G2P field and thus determine emerging needs and practices * To develop key standards for the G2P database field * To create generic database components, services and integration infrastructures for the G2P database domain * To create search modalities and data presentation solutions for G2P knowledge * To facilitate the process of populating G2P databases * To build a major G2P internet portal * To deploy GEN2PHEN solutions to the community * To address system durability and long- term financing * To undertake a whole-system utility and validation pilot study The GEN2PHEN Consortium members have been selected from a talented pool of European research groups and companies that are interested in the G2P database challenge. Additionally, a few non-EU participants have been included to bring extra capabilities to the initiative. The final constellation is characterised by broad and proven competence, a network of established working relationships, and high-level roles/connections within other significant projects in this domain... Background and Concept By providing a complete Homo sapiens ‘parts list’ (the gene sequences) and a powerful ‘toolkit’ (technologies), the Human Genome Project has revolutionised mankind’s ability to explore how genes cause disease and other phenotypes. Studies in this domain are proceeding at a rapid and ever-increasing pace, generating unprecedented amounts of raw and processed data. It is now imperative that the scientific community finds ways to effectively manage and exploit this flood of information for knowledge creation and practical benefit to society. This fundamental goal lies at the heart of the “Genotype-To-Phenotype Databases: A Holistic Solution (GEN2PHEN)” project. Previous genetics studies have shown that inter-individual genome variation plays a major role in differential normal development and disease processes. However, the details of how these relationships work are far from clear, even in the case of most Mendelian disorders where single genetic alterations are fully penetrant (essentially causative, rather than risk modifying). Background genetic effects (modifier genes), epistasis, somatic variation, and environmental factors all complicate the situation. This is particularly the case in complex, multi-factorial disorders (e.g., cancer, heart disease, diabetes, dementia) that will affect most of us at some stage in our lifetime. Strategies do, however, now exist to study the genetics of these disorders, and such investigations are a major focus of research throughout Europe and beyond. A common thread in these studies is the need to create ever-larger datasets and integrate these more effectively.

Named after the national hero José Rizal, it is a part of Radial Road 9 (R-9). The LRTA's Line 1 elevated railroad is built above the street in its entire length, and several jeepneys ply the area taking passengers from Caloocan and Quezon City. Most of the street is within the Sta. Cruz. By the 1960s, economic activities shifted from Binondo to Makati. Contemporary landmarks The Line 1 stations are the main landmarks of the avenue; there are nine of them at Rizal Avenue. At the northern end of the avenue is the Bonifacio Monument roundabout. Vehicles coming from Rizal Avenue's northbound carriageway can turn right into EDSA (Circumferential Road 4); its northern logical extension would be the MacArthur Highway (continuation of Radial Road 9), which leads all the way to Laoag, Ilocos Norte. Vehicles from Samson Road (EDSA's logical western extension) enter the avenue to its southbound carriageway. The avenue also provides access to the entrance and exit gates of the Manila Chinese Cemetery. The San Lazaro Compound (which hosts the San Lazaro Hospital, the Dr. Jose Reyes Memorial Medical Center and the Department of Health) and the Archdiocesan Shrine of Espiritu Santo are the other landmarks along the avenue. Shopping malls found along the Avenue are Araneta Square, Uniwide Sales, SM City San Lazaro (a walking distance from Tayuman Street) and at the south end at Carriedo Street is the Isetann Carriedo. In front of Isetann is Plaza Lacson (formerly Plaza Goiti). One passing through Plaza Lacson ends up in MacArthur Bridge, then to Taft Avenue (Radial Road 2). Eastbound takes one to Quiapo Church, although this part of the street has been pedestrianized. History Rizal Avenue in the late 1970s. The Avenida Rizal was created by Manila City ordinance in 1911 from two streets – Calle Dulumbayan (literally the edge of town) and Calle Salcedo. It also called Calle Cervantes. It lengthened in the next two decades all the way up to Caloocan and the then new monument honoring Andres Bonifacio. It became the city's longest street before being overshadowed by EDSA later in the century. Prior to and right after World War II, the avenue was center of the city's social life, with the street lined with shops, restaurants and movie theaters. The theaters were designed by the prominent architects of the day, many of whom would become National Artists. Two National Artists for architecture, Pablo Antonio and Juan Nakpil, created several of the movie theaters along the avenue. Antonio designed the Galaxy, the Ideal, the Scala and the Lyric theaters, while Nakpil designed the Capitol, the Ever and the Avenue theaters. As the years went by, the area was victimized by urban renewal. By the 1960s, economic activities shifted from the downtown area of Manila to Makati. The exodus of business and the rich residents from Manila to the suburbs coupled by the increase in low skilled rural migrants looking for work opportunities led to the deterioration of the old business districts, including Rizal Avenue. The construction of Line 1 in the 1980s, which required the closure of Rizal Avenue to vehicular traffic, essentially killed business along the route. The cinemas themselves resorted to showing double feature B-movies and soft porn, as people transferred to the newer and more modern Ortigas Center and the Ayala Center. In 2000, during the mayorship of Lito Atienza, the stretch from C.M. Recto Avenue to Palanca Street was turned into a pedestrian-only thoroughfare by laying bricks on the road, with the buildings and the Line 1 painted as part of an urban renewal project. This caused vehicles to use the secondary roads such as Tomas Mapua and Doroteo Jose Streets in order to go to and from Plaza Lacson. The Ideal Theater was previously demolished, the Galaxy, Scala and Lyric theaters are now misused. The first level of the Ever Theater is occupied by stalls, while the upper levels are abandoned. Only the refurbished Capitol Theater, now a dimsum palace, survived the modern times and is still active. The pedestrianization of Rizal Avenue was completed on 2003 and was meant to only last for a short time but it has persisted until 2008. The Avenue Theater, which survived the Battle of Manila of 1945, was demolished in 2006 to give way to a parking area. The costs of maintaining the facility were too high, as compared for it to be converted as a parking area. The National Historical Institute (NHI) and several private entities tried to prevent the building from being torn down. One of Mayor Alfredo Lim 's first decisions after winning the elections of 2007 was to reopen the pedestrian-only section of Rizal Avenue, which has elicited complaints from shopkeepers due to decreased traffic of people, and from commuters which caused traffic jams on secondary streets. Since the cost of the tiles for the pedestrianization was about P40 each, the tiles had been carefully removed for it to be used in future projects. On July 17, 2007, Lim attended the ceremony reopening the closed portion of Rizal Avenue, and it has remained open to this day. Train stations along Rizal Avenue R.

The system was built from the early 1890s through the 1930s, and initially owned by a state-level parks commission, which passed control to the city of Louisville in 1942. The system was intended to form a circuit around what was then the fringes of the city of Louisville. However, there is a disconnect of several blocks between Eastern and Southern Parkways, because of a planned parkway running from the terminus of Western (today's Northwestern) Parkway along the Ohio River and around to Eastern Parkway was never built. Today, the system falls under direct management of the Louisville Olmsted Parks Conservancy, and under broader supervision by Louisville's Metro Parks Department Development The system was first proposed in 1887 by businessman Andrew Cowan, an enthusiastic early supporter of Louisville's park system. He proposed a series of parkways that would cross every turnpike near the city as the parkways connected the three proposed parks at the eastern, western and southern fringes of the city. Although Cowan proposed a slow and deliberate development, Mayor Charles Donald Jacob purchased what became Iroquois Park a year later and quickly began acquiring through donations the land to build -wide \\"Grand Boulevard\\" (later renamed Southern Parkway) connecting that southern property to the city. Jacob claimed the boulevard would rival Champs-Élysées in Paris. A parks commission was created in 1890, and soon hired Olmsted's firm to design the entire system. The firm delivered a report in September 1891 calling for three large parks and parkways connecting them. The parkways were intended to carry light pleasure vehicles between the parks, with no access to heavier commercial vehicles. It was not until 1958 that the city opened up the parkways to all commercial and passenger traffic. As the city expanded and the parkways became heavily traveled roads, they have been widened beyond their original two lanes, in many cases sacrificing the grass medians and tree-lined yards that were originally a part of them. Still, as of 2000, 75% of the original trees remained or had been replaced by new trees. There were 5,107 trees along the parkways according to a 1994 count. Between 2008 and 2011, a major project was undertaken to restore many of the trees that had been damaged by storms, traffic, or age and disease. This has filled in many of the canopy gaps along the parkways, and was done as much as possible in accordance with the original Olmstedian plan. Today there are various proposals being debated to ease traffic issues and restore connectivity of the city's parks via these routes. One such plan involves bike lanes and center lanes for turning. Parkways =Algonquin Parkway= Algonquin Parkway connects the Western parkways to Southern and Eastern Parkways via Third Street, cutting east-to-west across the city. The last of the parkways to be finished, Algonquin was partially completed in 1928 by the Carey-Reed Company of Lexington at an initial cost of $120,000 with a width of just at the time, although space was reserved for widening once the area became more developed. When it opened it ran from Winkler Avenue to the Kentucky State Fairgrounds. The widening was finished in the late 1930s by workers for the Works Progress Administration. Algonquin has been cited as the \\"most extreme\\" example of a parkway that has deviated from the original plan, due to a junkyard that is located alongside it. =Eastern Parkway= Eastern Parkway begins at an intersection with Third Street in the Belknap (main) campus of the University of Louisville. This portion ends a few blocks from Southern Parkway, and is a key gap between the parkways that has never been filled in. The portion through the University of Louisville campus was initially just two lanes, creating a major traffic bottleneck. This portion was replaced with a viaduct which passes over the campus, completed in October 1954 at a cost of $850,000. The viaduct was opened with a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by mayor Broaddus, who then got into his car to become the first to drive over it. However, two vehicles competing to be the second collided, creating a wreck within seconds of the road's opening. Today, the parkway has one vehicular lane in each direction, plus dedicated bicycle lanes, through campus, widening to four lanes immediately east of the viaduct. East of the university, there is an interchange with Interstate 65, and past that the parkway takes on a more residential feel for the rest of the route, with houses and apartment buildings on either side, except for near major intersections. The parkway passes over a concrete channel Beargrass Creek on an overpass built in 1961. From Barrett to Baxter Avenue, the parkway is divided by a grassy median with mature trees. The final stretch of the parkway, past Bardstown Road, is the only two-lane portion outside of the U of L campus, although it is very wide, to allow for on-street parking. Eastern Parkway ends in a roundabout at the entrance to Cherokee Park, at the center of which is a 1906 statue of Daniel Boone made by Enid Yandell. Eastern Parkway is signed as US 60 from Third Street to Willow Avenue, nearly the entire length of the parkway. The right- of-way for Eastern Parkway is wide, and initial development of it was completed in late 1913. A long portion of the route was donated by John Breckinridge Castleman, accounting for the sharp jog at the Baxter Avenue intersection. Parkway Field took its name from and was located beside Eastern Parkway from 1926 until 2002. The entire length of Eastern Parkway is signed as Alternate US 60, as US 60 followed the Parkway through the city before a bypass, I-264, was created. Eastern Parkway has an interchange with Interstate 65. Parkways Of Louisville Although Eastern Parkway was intended as a recreational road, it is the only direct connector between the populous Highlands and Germantown sections of Louisville and mid-city destinations like the University of Louisville's main campus. As such, it has had problems associated with a road carrying much more traffic than it was designed for since at least the 1950s, when the intersection with Third Street consistently led the state of Kentucky in number of crashes per year at a single intersection. Various proposals have been made to improve safety on the road, including reducing it to three vehicle lanes and two bike lanes. Narrowing proposals were last made in 2006, although the plan was rejected since the traffic volume at the time, 21,000 vehicles per day, was too much for three lanes. =Northwestern/Southwestern Parkway= Northwestern and Southwestern Parkways were initially called just Western Parkway. A large amount of the right-of-way was donated by Democratic Party boss John Henry Whallen, who made his residence near what is now Chickasaw Park. =Southern Parkway= First called Grand Boulevard, Southern Parkway runs from near Churchill Downs to the entrance to Iroquois Park. It begins at third street, near the Eastern Parkway intersection, and the two parkways can easily be combined to connect Iroquois to Cherokee Park. It was renamed Southern Parkway on June 6, 1893 and opened to the public eight days later.

Life and career  Joe Val was born Joseph Valiante in Everett, Massachusetts. Although raised in the northeast, he took a very early interest in bluegrass music, prompted chiefly by hearing Bill Monroe on radio and records. The region in which Val was raised had a very strong bluegrass affinity. He also listened to local bands, and especially the work of fiddler Tex Logan. It was Logan who coined the name 'Val' (short for Valiante). Tex could not pronounce the Italian last name, thus introducing Joe onstage as Joe 'Val'. For over 25 years, Joe Val was, in the words of Peter Rowan, \\"The voice of bluegrass in New England.\\" It didn't matter that he was a short, skinny Italian from a blue-collar Boston suburb, nor did it matter that his renditions of Bill Monroe and Jimmie Rodgers standards were often tinted by a decidedly Yankee inflection. On-stage he was an unassuming, bespectacled, quietly smiling presence until he opened his mouth to sing. His smooth, high tenor voice made Joe no less an authority than a Bill Monroe or Del McCoury. Joe Val worked a full-time day job as a typewriter repairman. He often had to ask for time off from work to tour with his band. Joe helped blaze the trail for Boston's folk and bluegrass scene with the Lilly Brothers in the early '60s, and later surrounded himself with the cream of that city's musical crop including Joan Baez, The Charles River Valley Boys, banjo legends Don Stover and Bill Keith, Jim Rooney, and the less well-known members of the New England Bluegrass Boys (most notably a relatively unknown guitarist and singer, Dave Dillon). Val had started out on guitar, but also played banjo and finally the mandolin, which brought him lasting renown. Joe honed his skills as he played with several bands including the Radio Rangers, the Berkshire Mountain Boys and The Lilly Brothers & Don Stover. Val was in the right place to become involved with the Boston-area bluegrass boom among the region's university and college students in the 1960s. He played and recorded with the Bill Keith-Jim Rooney Band, and The Charles River Valley Boys. In both instances, he comfortably accommodated contemporary shifts in bluegrass but never lost his preference for the traditional form of the music. In 1970, Joe Val formed his own band, The New England Bluegrass Boys, bringing in Herb Applin (guitar/vocals), Bob French (banjo), and Bob Tidwell (bass). The band recorded their first album, the very first bluegrass release for Rounder Records, entitled One Morning In May in 1972. Joe Val & The New England Bluegrass Boys recorded exclusively with Rounder Records for what turned out to be a relatively short recording career, releasing albums from 1973-84 on that label. The personnel varied slightly through the years. Among those that played in the band were guitarists/lead vocalists Dave Dillon and Dave Haney, banjo players Paul Silvius, Karl Lauber and Joe Dietz, bass player Eric Levenson, fiddler Sonny Miller and dobro player Roger Williams. Just when Joe Val made the decision to finally make touring a full-time occupation, he learned that he was suffering from Lymphoma. Joe's last full show was performed during an afternoon set at a festival in Keene, NH in 1984. Shortly after that set, he was shuffled off to the hospital with the help of close friends and fellow musicians. Joe missed the evening set, perhaps for the first time in his long career. The band's final engagement was to be at the 1984 New Year's Eve Jekyll Island Bluegrass Festival in Georgia. Though Joe was feeling ill, he insisted on making the trip from New England and attempted to perform. However he was flown back home to a Boston hospital. Two major fundraising benefits were held to help defray medical costs and household bills while Joe was ill and unable to work. The first benefit concert was organized in November 1984 by Len Domler (The Sounding Board Coffeehouse) and Kevin Lynch in West Hartford, CT. The Johnson Mountain Boys, Del & Jerry McCoury, Bob & Dan Paisley and Traver Hollow donated their time, expenses, and talents to entertain a sold-out theater crowd. The second benefit, the Joe Val Benefit and Appreciation Day, on June 9, 1985 (two days before Joe died) was organized by the Boston Bluegrass Union (BBU), the now defunct North River Bluegrass Association (Cathy & Ted Howland and Linda Fitzpatrick) and many volunteers. A full day and early evening of jams, workshops and concerts drew many familiar names and a large crowd. Among the performers were the duo of Tony Rice & Jimmy Gaudreau (making a surprise appearance), John Lincoln Wright, Bill Keith, Traver Hollow, White Mountain Bluegrass, Joe's brother Paul Valiante (singing with Traver Hollow) and more. During his final weeks, Joe was humbled and comforted by the outpouring of good will and best wishes. He received calls, visits and countless cards & letters from fans and friends, as well as many of his peers in the music business. The likes of Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, Ricky Skaggs, and several other notable figures from Joe's early days in the Boston area music scene, took the time to make personal hospital visits and phone calls. Joe Val was honored throughout his funeral service with several renditions of Gospel songs sung and played in the upper loft of the church by New England Bluegrass Boys, Dave Dillon, Herb Applin, Paul Silvius, Dave Haney. and Karl Lauber. Joe was laid to rest in the historic Mount Feake Cemetery at 203 Prospect Street, Waltham, MA. His headstone is easily identifiable by an engraving of his 1923 Gibson 'Lloyd Loar' Mandolin, designed by Joe's devoted friend and bass player, Eric Levenson. The International Bluegrass Music Association posthumously presented Joe Val with an 'IBMA Award Of Merit' for his dedication and lifetime contributions to bluegrass music during their 1995 IBMA World of Bluegrass annual bluegrass trade show & convention. That presentation was made by John Rossbach, accompanied by Joe's mandolin. Although John did not know Joe Val, he gave an impressive history of Joe as a person, as well as his accomplishments and contributions to the bluegrass music genre. Joe Val received a standing ovation from a knowledgeable IBMA audience, including many of Joe's peers. In 1986, an annual \\"Joe Val Day\\" memorial event was organized and held on the Waltham Common in the center of Waltham, MA. One of Joe's best friends, next door neighbor and successful Waltham ophthalmologist, the late Rod O'Neill, was the founder. O'Neill, along with town treasurer Steve Kilgore and handful of others, produced the event for several years. Many of Joe's friends, fans and fellow bluegrass musicians volunteered their time and talents, including nearly all of his sidemen. At that time a portion of the Joe Val Day proceeds were used to develop an annual 'Joe Val Music Scholarship' for the Waltham elementary school system. Sadly, that scholarship no longer exists. When the original \\"Joe Val Day\\" ceased operations on the Waltham Common, the Boston Bluegrass Union took the reins. The BBU eventually moved it to a larger location, the Newton North High School sports field in neighboring Newton, MA. In the mid-1990s, the BBU event ultimately evolved into the \\"Joe Val Bluegrass Festival\\". In 2000, the BBU expanded and refined their festival concept, relocating it to Presidents' Day Weekend at a nearby hotel. The first indoor mid-winter event took place in Dedham, MA and, since 2003, in Framingham, MA. The festival won the coveted \\"Event of the Year\\" award in 2006 from the International Bluegrass Music Association. Information for the annual Joe Val Bluegrass Festival, held each February, can be found at the BBU website Joe Val Bluegrass Festival. Festival proceeds support a number of Bluegrass Music educational programs. Much of Joe's memorabilia is housed in the Waltham Museum, including photos from the very first \\"Joe Val Day\\" on Waltham Common. Photos are mounted on the original 'Joe Val Day' banner which served as a backdrop for the stage. Also included in the museum are Waltham country music legends Gerry Robichaud & The Country Masters, television personality Rex Trailer, John Penny & Bella Lee and George Mahoney (of \\"George & Dixie\\") who opened the Webster, MA country music venue Indian Ranch in 1946.

He had a long rowing career and competed on the international stage for 19 seasons, retiring aged 41. Biography He was born in 1943 in Züllichau, at the time located in Germany but since the end of World War II part of Poland. He started rowing in 1958 at age 15 but after two or three years, he became a coxswain instead. At 170 cm, he was tall for a cox but he suppressed hunger by heavy smoking to keep his weight at 55 kg, the minimum weight for that role. He competed for the SG Dynamo Potsdam / Sportvereinigung (SV) Dynamo. Ludwig's first international race was at the 1966 World Rowing Championships in Bled where he won gold with the coxed four. In 1972 he coxed the East German boat that won the gold medal in the coxed four event. In 1973 he won a silver medal at the European Rowing Championships in Moscow. At the 1980 Olympics he won the gold medal with the East German boat in the men's eight competition. He retired from competitive rowing—aged 41 and after 19 international rowing seasons—after winning silver with the men's eight at the 1984 Friendship Games, dubbed the \\"alternative Olympics\\". Skipping meals, heavy smoking and alcohol consumption took a toll on Ludwig's health. He lived in a care facility since the end of 2015. Shortly before he died on 18 May 2016 he had his stomach removed.

The show was a scripted sitcom with sketch comedy elements written by, and starring, nine CollegeHumor editorial staff members, who play fictionalized versions of themselves. The show was an adaptation of the style of the long-running Hardly Working short film series created for the CollegeHumor site, made more suitable for the longer, televised format. After the conclusion of the six episode season, the series was cancelled. The series also spawned the spin-off show Pranked, hosted by Streeter Seidell and Amir Blumenfeld and airing on MTV. Cast =Main characters= In the show, the actual CollegeHumor (and CollegeHumor Show) writers play fictionalized versions of themselves. There is no single \\"star\\" of the show; rather, the nine main characters function as an ensemble. For the most part, the characters are self-centered, operating according to their immediate desires rather than making rational or sensitive decisions. *Ricky (Ricky Van Veen) is the editor-in-chief; a wealthy, image-obsessed young man who craves the attention of D-list celebrities. *Sam (Sam Reich) manages the writing staff, though he is essentially as immature as the rest of them. Sam has a close friendship with Dan. *Dan (Dan Gurewitch) is a bright- eyed, enthusiastic writer who often has a naive approach to women and the world. *Amir (Amir Blumenfeld) is the outcast of the gang, socially inept and prone to fits of irrational anger. He wants nothing more than to be best friends with Jake. Their dysfunctional relationship was created and cultivated in their online video series Jake and Amir. *Jake (Jake Hurwitz) is the office ladies' man, and is enamored with Sarah. He spends much of his time attempting to convince Amir that they are not, in fact, best friends. He is sometimes up showed by Amir. *Sarah (Sarah Schneider), the most down-to-earth member of the group. As she is a bit of a tomboy, the guys on staff treat her like a sister. She is often the sole voice of reason in an otherwise chaotic office. *Streeter (Streeter Seidell), the front page editor, is moodier than the rest of the writers and is prone to emitting a signature whine when he doesn't get his way. *Jeff (Jeffrey \\"Jeff\\" Rubin), managing editor and video game fanatic, has a more \\"go with the flow\\" attitude. *Pat (Patrick \\"Pat\\" Cassels) tends to be more eccentric and put-upon than the other characters. =Supporting cast= *Nick Kroll as Chuck Paulson, CEO of CollegeHumor's fictional rival website GiggleBarn.biz. *Josh Ruben as Trip, an insensitive magician that the CH boys attempt to set up with Sarah.

It is a white crystalline solid, but will turn yellow upon exposure to light. It is slightly soluble in water and can be converted to a basic salt (Pb(CNS)2*Pb(OH)2 when boiled. Salt crystals may form upon cooling. Lead thiocyanate can cause lead poisoning if ingested and can adversely react with many substances. It has use in small explosives, matches, and dyeing. Lead(II)Thiocyanate in both compound( top) and salt (bottom) forms. Lead(II) thiocyanate is reasonably soluble at room temperature, thus it may be difficult to identify in a solution with low concentration of lead(II) thiocyanate. Although it has not been confirmed by other sources than the author of this article, experiments show that even if there is no precipitation of lead(II) thiocyanate in the solution, crystals of the salt may form.  Synthesis  Lead(II) thiocyanate can be formed from the acidification of Lead Nitrate Pb(NO3)2 with nitric acid (HNO3) in the presence of Thiocyanic acid (HSCN) Lead(II) thiocyanate may be made by reacting lead(II) acetate (Pb(CH3COO)2) solved in water with either potassium thiocyanate (KSCN) or ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN), thus causing a white precipitation of solid lead(II) thiocyanate. Ion reaction: :Pb2+(aq) + 2SCN−(aq) → Pb(SCN)2(s)  Reactivity  When exposed to UV or visible light lead thiocyanate will turn yellow due to the presence of sulfur. It is violently oxidized by nitric acid and will releases hydrogen cyanide gas after contact with acid, which is toxic. High amounts of heat such as that produces in a house fire will releases sulfur dioxide gas, also toxic. Like other metal cyanides, Lead thiocyanate explodes on heating when mixed with sodium nitrite.  Health Hazards  Skin and eye irritant, can induce lead poisoning by ingestion or inhalation. Symptoms include gastrointestinal disorders, irritation of digestive tract, leg cramps, muscle weakness, paresthesia. High doses can result in coma or death. Symptoms present in 1 to 2 days. = Lead Poisoning = Most lead(II) salts have a sweet taste making them a hazard for continued consumption small children. While lead thiocyanate was likely not used in paints due to its light sensitivity, many lead based paints have been used pre-1970s. The paint has a tendency to peel and fall off making it likely to expose small children and pets. Since Lead poisoning occurs with the binding of Lead (II) to biological systems, research has been done to find ligands that more preferentially bind to Lead (II) than other biological targets in an effort to combat the effects of lead poisoning. = EPA Restrictions = Reportable Quantity 10 pounds – “Facilities or vessels that release more than the RQ of a listed chemical within any 24-hour period must immediately report it to National Response Center (1-800-424-8802), as well as notifying the LEPC and the SERC. For details, including exemptions to the reporting requirements, see the regulations.” -EPA  Uses  Lead thiocyanate is used in explosives, specifically an ingredient in primers for small-arms cartridges, safety matches, and to reverse aniline black dyeing (Gideon).

Facts For £20,000 art dealer Ofir Scheps purchased a sculpture of 1991 Turner Prize winner Anish Kapoor, called Hole and Vessel II from an auction house. Scheps hired Fine Art Logistics Ltd (FAL) to collect and store it until it could be delivered to Kapoor's studio for restoration. FAL did pick it up from the auction house, but lost it before it could be delivered to Kapoor; during renovation work at their storage house in Ponton Road, Wandsworth, London, it was probably mistakenly discarded.Paul Willis, 'Turner prize artist's work \\"dumped in skip\\"' (17.3.2007) Daily Telegraph It was worth £350,000. FAL's standard terms limited liability to £350 per cubic metre of volume. FAL argued that Scheps must have been aware of such standard terms given his experience in arranging for art transport. Judgment Teare, J held there was no evidence that Scheps had knowledge of the terms of FAL or the business, and that FAL had not given a copy of the terms to Scheps, who was a private customer. Therefore the terms were not incorporated. Under the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 and the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 it would be reasonable or fair for a company to limit its liability by weight or volume had the terms been reasonably brought to Scheps' attention. But no such effort was made. Therefore, Fine Art Logistics was liable for wrongful interference and conversion of the sculpture. Scheps was entitled to the value at the date of conversion and consequential damage to compensate for the rise in value after.Kuwait Airways Corp v Iraqi Airways Co (No 6) [2002] UKHL 19, [2002] 2 AC 883 See also *British Crane Hire Corporation Ltd v Ipswich Plant Hire Ltd [1975] QB 303 Notes English contract case law English unfair terms case law High Court of Justice cases 2007 in case law 2007 in British law ","title":"Scheps v Fine Art Logistic Ltd"},{"id":"21178074","text":"Franz Held (born 6 May 1948) is a German rower who competed for West Germany in the 1968 Summer Olympics and in the 1972 Summer Olympics.

Shortly thereafter he turned his attention to electronic and digital art and is considered one of the pioneers of that art form. Biography From 1985 to 1996, together with his colleagues Flavia Alman, Sabine Reiff and Riccardo Sinigaglia, he was part of the Correnti Magnetiche Research and Electronic Art Group. The works produced by the group received many awards at such international exhibitions as SIGGRAPH in Los Angeles, Ars Electronica in Linz, Imagina in Monte Carlo and Nastro d'Argento in Rome. In 1989, Mr. Canali was awarded the Immagine Elettronica Prize in Ferrara for his pioneering work in electronic art. In 1993, working in collaboration with acclaimed computer scientist Marcello Campione, he created Satori, a revolutionary installation that featured the usage of immersive virtual reality for artistic and expressive purposes. In 1994, he founded Studio Canali with the goal of creating interactive installations capable of sensing psychophysical parameters and expressing that data as displays of light, sound, images and video. Assisted by psychologist Elio Massironi, computer scientist Marcello Campione and cabinet maker Leonardo Aurelio, he created a series of innovative works that combined art with science and technology. These displays were experienced and enjoyed by thousands of people in a wide range of venues ranging from museums to private parties. Since 1998, the company has focused on creating interactive installations enhanced by the use of technologies and the diffusion of digital thought as a means of promoting social interactions. In 1999 he designed the Cultural Entertainment Centre in an abandoned industrial area in Sesto San Giovanni in conjunction with the Reload Cultural Association. From 2000 to 2002, he created and managed Ludiialydis with performer Xena Zupanic: a psycho-bar, meeting place, experimentation and event production centre. In 2003 - 2004 he began the Arcnaut project, organizing a series of events focused on the conceptual understanding of art, science and philosophy and the interaction of these dynamics.

The main festival of the shrine is held annually on April 17, although its spring festival on February 17–18 is a larger event.Plutschow. Matsuri: The Festivals of Japan. History Mount Kunō (216 meters) is a steep peak on Suruga Bay, and the site of an ancient Buddhist temple called dating to at least the early Nara period. The temple prospered during the Kamakura period under the famous prelate Enni, who introduced the cultivation of green tea to the region. After the conquest of Suruga Province by the warlord Takeda Shingen, the temple was relocated to what is now Shimizu-ku, and the mountain top fortified into a mountain castle (. After the fall of the Takeda clan, Suruga Province came under the control of the Tokugawa clan. After Tokugawa Ieyasu retired to Sunpu Castle, he continued to maintain the fortifications on Mount Kunō. After his death, Tokugawa Hidetada ordered that he be buried on its peak, and had the first shrine buildings erected. The 3rd shōgun, Tokugawa Iemitsu, relocated Ieyasu's grave to the Nikkō Tōshō-gū, but a portion of his deified spirit was held to still reside on Mount Kunō.

History Breydon Viaduct was built to cross the River Yare just downstream of Breydon Water and hence connect Yarmouth Beach station to the Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway line from Yarmouth South Town railway station. By doing so it gave passengers from the Midlands a direct link to Lowestoft. The Engineer-in-Chief of the work was Alexander Ross, the Chief Engineer of the Great Northern Railway. William E. Newman provided the mechanical and structural design and William Marriott acted as executive engineer. The bridge was long and consisted of five spans. The second span from the south rotated about its midpoint in the manner of a swing bridge to leave two passages for river traffic. This section sat on a cast iron pivot which used ball bearings which made the bridge so free running that it could be manually opened by just one person. Breydon Road Bridge Work on the bridge began in 1899 and it was finished in 1903 at a total cost of £38,453. (equivalent to £ in ), It was the largest structure on the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway. The bridge was successfully weight tested on 8 July 1903 with a train of heavy engines and it was opened shortly after. The bridge was single track whilst the rest of the line was double track and so signal boxes were provided at each end. River traffic on the Yare had priority over trains that wished to use the bridge. The viaduct closed on 21 September 1953 prior to the rest of the MG&N; line. The tracks over the bridge remained in place for several years afterwards before the bridge was finally demolished in 1962. At the time of its closure it was anticipated that major repairs would be required to keep it in service, although it was found to be in good condition when it was demolished. The closure left Yarmouth Beach station a terminus until it was closed in 1959. After its demolition the pilings remained in the river until the construction of Breydon Road Bridge in the late 1980s when they were removed. The new road bridge followed the alignment of the rail viaduct and was a drawbridge which could open completely in 90 seconds; the rail bridge could take up to ten minutes to open in strong winds.

Their type genus is Xenusion. They have relatively large, annulated, cylindrical bodies. Their lobopod legs have tubercles at their bases. Some have large frontal appendages, although these may represent taphonomic artefacts. Their mouth is terminal or subterminal, and they are marine. They probably represent a grade (paraphyletic group) rather than a clade (monophyletic group).

Ross was born in Laggan, County of Inverness in Scotland on 20 April 1845. He was educated in Aberdeen and at Owen's College in Manchester, an institution now a part of the University of Manchester. Ross began his career in railway engineering with the Great North of Scotland Railway (GNSR) before moving to the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) in 1871. In 1873 he went to work for the North Eastern Railway (NER) before returning to LNWR in the next year. He changed employer again in 1884 when he went to work for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) before becoming the Chief Engineer of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&LR;) in 1890. During his time at MS&LR; he was responsible for the design of many of the works involved with that company's London Extension. In 1896 Ross became the Chief Engineer of the Great Northern Railway (GNR), a post he held until 1911 when he became an engineering consultant. During his time at GNR his advice was sought by the company's board on the locomotive design to be chosen for their no.1300 series of engines. Several designs were rejected as they were judged to be too long or heavy for the rail infrastructure. Despite several attempts at redesign by Nigel Gresley the series was scrapped in 1924. His works as an engineering consultant included the Hertford Loop Line and Breydon Viaduct, with Ross serving as the Engineer-in-Chief of the latter. On 16 June 1897 he was appointed Major in the Engineer and Railway Staff Corps, an unpaid unit of the Volunteer Force which provided technical advice to the British Army. He was a Lieutenant-Colonel in that corps at the time it joined the Territorial Force on 1 April 1908. He had been a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers since before 16 June 1897 and from November 1915 to November 1916 he served as their president.. Ross died in London on 3 February 1923.

He was responsible for major changes both to the company and to the classical guitars it produces. Ramírez was raised in a guitar making family, and served his luthier's apprenticeship in the family business founded by his grandfather and by then run by his father José II. During and in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War material shortages forced them to experiment, and the young José developed a love of innovation. But this was also a frustrating time for him; Frequently, his father sold his work with little if any documentation as to the construction, the results, or the buyer. In 1954, his brother Alfredo, who had been doing the administrative work of the family business, died, followed three years later by their father, forcing Ramírez to give up guitar making for a time to supervise the business. Undeterred, he committed his designs to paper for journeymen to make. Ramírez worked closely with top performers, which brought acceptance to his innovations. In Andrés Segovia, whom he first met in 1952, he found a performer who was like him passionate about achieving greater volume and clarity, to allow the classical guitar to be accompanied by a full symphony orchestra. Daring to tamper with the designs of Torres, Ramírez built larger and more powerful concert guitars, with longer scale lengths and asymmetrical bracing. Both of these innovations, and many others, are standard today. Segovia was an uncompromising customer, but when Ramírez' designs gave him what he wanted, an unsurpassable supporter. More radical still, in 1963 Ramírez built a ten-string guitar for Narciso Yepes, to accommodate Yepes' unique chromatically balanced tuning. Later he developed an eight-string guitar for José Tomás. He also experimented with different woods and varnishes and countless other major and minor innovations. In the 1960s, to cope with increasing demand, Ramírez moved his workshop to its own building, and greatly expanded the number of employees, leaving the original premises as a shop only. He continued to supervise every aspect of the business until 1988, when he passed control to his children José IV (also known as José Enrique Ramírez García or just José Enrique) and Amalia, both themselves by then guitar makers. He continued to experiment until the end of his life, and to collaborate with top performers, including younger performers and those from other musical traditions. With Marcel Dadi, he designed a classical guitar with a cutaway body, still in production. In 1983, he designed the \\"camara\\" guitar, with the intention of eliminating the wolf notes. Ramírez trained more than a generation of journeymen, many of them becoming top-ranking luthiers with their own establishments, and including his own children José IV and Amalia. In 1979, the company sent a number of its finest guitars to Segovia, from which he chose one which as it happened was to be the guitar he would use for the rest of his life. The one he chose was by José Ramírez IV. He had learned well, but he had a peerless teacher. In 1962, Ramírez was awarded the gold medal of the Guitar Society in Chicago. In 1968, he was elected Honorary Partner of the Centre Culturale de la Chitarra in Rome; In 1972 he received the Bronze medal award by the Official Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Madrid, gold medal to the exemplary Artisan of the Union Work of Craft; And in 1983 was made an Honorary Partner of Música en Compostela. There followed in 1987 the Diapason d'Or from the Ministry of Education and Culture of France, but to the end of his life the award he most cherished was a letter from Andrés Segovia acknowledging his work.

It is found to the east of the Andes in Ecuador, Colombia, northern Peru and western Brazil. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests. The English zoologist Philip Sclater described the white-cheeked antbird in 1855 and coined the binomial name Myrmeciza leucaspis. The title page gives the year 1854 but the volume was not published until the following year. It is now placed in the genus Gymnopithys which was introduced by the French ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1857. There are four subspecies: * G. l. leucaspis (Sclater, PL, 1855) – east Colombia * G. l. castaneus Zimmer, JT, 1937 – east Ecuador and northeast Peru * G. l. peruanus Zimmer, JT, 1937 – north Peru * G. l. lateralis Todd, 1927 – northwest Amazonian Brazil The white-cheeked antbird was formerly considered as conspecific with the bicolored antbird. They were split into separate species based on the results of a 2007 genetic study that found that the white-cheeked antbird was more similar to the rufous-throated antbird than it was to the bicolored antbird.

The first debate came after the 1956 Dalsenget fire, when most of the city's tram fleet was destroyed; a proposal to replace the tramway with a trolleybus line was rejected. In 1968, the Singsaker Line was closed, and replaced by a bus route. From the merger of all bus and tram companies into Trondheim Trafikkselskap in 1974, the debate was intensified. In 1984, the Elgeseter Line was closed, but a new depot was built and eleven new trams delivered. In 1988, the last tram line, from Lian to Lade, was terminated. The tracks in the city center and to Lade were removed, but the Gråkallen Line was kept to run heritage trams. By 1990, the trams were still not sold. Instead, the private company AS Gråkallbanen took over operations and seven trams, and have operated the Gråkallen Line since. The process cost two mayors their jobs. Merger After the city owned both tramway companies, Graakalbanen and Trondheim Sporvei, after 1966, it was decided in 1969 to merge them as well as the newly purchased Bynesruten into Trondheim Trafikkselskap (TT). Organized as a limited company, the merger took effect on 1 January 1972. However, this occurred when public transport was becoming commercially unprofitable, and the city had was forced to give subsidies for the first time. Two years later, the private bus company Trondheim Bilruter was nationalized along with the Trondheim operations of Klæburuten and NSB Bilruter. On 1 January 1974, all the bus and tram transport throughout the city was organized as one entity.Kjenstad, 2005: 252–62 Arne Watle, CEO of Trondheim Bilruter since 1951, was appointed CEO of the new company. Odd Hovdenak, former CEO of both Trondheim Sporvei and Graakalbanen, became CFO. In the beginning there were problems with two very different corporate cultures. TT established itself at Sorgenfri after the administration of the former companies had been scattered around town. Trondheim Sporvei had long had ambitions to also become a bus company; while it had captured a few routes, this ambition was merged into the new company culture.Kjenstad, 2005: 263–64 During 1973 and 1974, the oil crisis had encouraged people to start taking more public transport. With high capacity, the trams were better suited than buses to cope with the 10% ridership increase, in particular on car-free Sundays. Other new concepts were monthly passes and senior discounts. During the early 1970s, the interest for environmentalism and people-friendly cities grew. Some politicians and activists demanded that decision processes be made open, and to reduce the massive plans for motorway construction throughout the municipality. In 1976, ridership increased by 12%. 6 million people were transport by two tram lines, while 14 million were transported on 38 bus lines.Kjenstad, 2005: 259–69 Reports Lademoen Line through Olav Trygvassons gate =First report= In 1975, the city council decided to order a report to consider the future of the tram. The work was done by the Norwegian Institute of Technology and Arne R. Reinertsen. In particular, it looked at how a new line could be built to Valentinlyst and onwards to the University of Trondheim campus at Dragvoll. Alternative 1 followed an at-grade route, along Innherredsveien to Strindheim, and along Bromstadveien, Kong Øysteins veg and Jonsvannsveien, and would cost NOK 68 million. The second alternative involved a tunnel from Bakkegate to Valentinlyst; this would cost NOK 209 million. Alternative 3 ran along Høyskoleveien from Studentersamfundet to Klæbuveien, and into a tunnel to Valentinlyst; this would cost NOK 116. All the sections were dimensioned for , and were inspired by the new rapid transit in Oslo. Alternative 1 was recommended, but would give an annual increase in operation costs of NOK 6.8 million.Kjenstad, 2005: 271–72 The report was then considered by the politicians on 28 April 1977. The Socialist Left Party supported alternative 1, while Odd Einar Dørum from the Liberal Party wanted new articulated trams. Both suggestions were only supported by the two respective parties. The Labour Party was split, and decided to win time by ordering a new report. Mayor Axel Busch from the Conservative Party said that the report gave just the conclusion he wanted. The first report was criticized for not considering the economic impact of replacing trams and trailers with new articulated trams, which would have lower operating costs. It also failed to take into consideration the increased ridership that the comfort of trams resulted in.Kjenstad, 2005: 272 =Change of operation= During 1978, the Ministry of Transport and Communications required all public transport companies to reduce their costs. TT announced that they wanted to close the Voldsminde Loop on the Lademoen Line. Instead, a 7.5-minute headway would be introduced from Lade to the Elgeseter Line/Ila Line intersection in Prinsens gate, and both the Gråkallen Line and the Elgeseter line would get a 15-minute headway. This schedule would be able to operate with one less tram in service, and would give a significant reduction in costs. However, Chairman Jens Trøtteberg from the Conservatives chose to present this suggestion in the newspaper, and also his sentiment that the whole network be closed. The deputy chairman Eigil Gullvåg and the labor unions criticized the suggestion, saying that it would not be beneficial to close parts of the network. The city council rejected the proposal on 20 December 1979.Kjenstad, 2005: 275 =Proposal for expansion= The second report was initiated by a committee in January 1978. When presented in nine volumes in March 1979, it recommended two new tramways: Lade–Midtbyen–NTH–Risvollan–Heimdalsbyen and Lian–Midtbyen–NTH–Nardo–Moholt–Stokkan. By 1990, this would capture 90% of the public transport in the municipality. Investments would be NOK 340 million and annual operating costs would be NOK 103–106 million. A diesel bus system would cost 81 million annually, while a trolleybus network would cost 87 million annually. The report recommended the diesel bus alternative. An information office was established by the city in Hornemannsgården in the city square. The information brochure made by the city announced that the investment costs were equal to five new schools, ten new kindergartens, two swimming halls, a library and 1,000 new housing lots. The report was considered by the city council on 29 March. After a long debate, the council decided to keep the existing network, and upgrade the rolling stock and tracks. This was again stated in a new vote on 24 August.Kjenstad, 2005: 277–78 Due to this decision, of track were replaced in 1979 in Strandveien, Innherredsveien and Mellomvien. At Buran, the trams to Lade and Voldsminde each got their own track so they could pass each other during red lights. In 1980–82, the whole Ila Line was renovated; Nordre Ilevolden was transformed into a pure public transport road, and the tram was given its own road from Ila to Bergsli gate. On the Gråkallen Line, wooden sleepers were replaced with concrete, and the track weight was increased from 35 to 41 kg/m, and the tracks were welded.Kjenstad, 2005: 278–79 Political trial The city hall =Political circus= During 1979, state subsidies became part of the debate. The 1970s saw a large increase in state subsidies to bus operations. Mayor Olav Gjærevoll had contacted the state to investigate if the tram could receive the same subsidy level as an equivalent bus route, but this had been rejected by the department, even though Minister of Transport, Ronald Bye of the Labour Party, was positive. Chief of Administration Odd Sagør suggested, during the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications of the Norwegian Parliament's visit to Trondheim in 1979, that state road funds could be used on tramway infrastructure. He noted that the trams did not receive state subsidies and were responsible for funding infrastructure. This suggestion was rejected.Kjenstad, 2005: 276 The Labour Party had lost the election in 1975, and Axel Buch from the Conservatives had become mayor. During the 1979 election, the Labour Party had chosen the slogan \\"rather tram than Buch\\". They increased from 34 to 36 seats, but the right-wing parties claimed 43 mandates while the Conservatives had their best election ever. Hildur Karsesten, a woman tram driver, made the decisive vote. The election proved contentious. Members of the labour union organized a secret council meeting between Karstensen and Olav Gjørevoll, the Labour mayor candidate, during which rumors spread that the right-wing coalition would not hold. During a pause, a search was started for Kristiansen, who had to hide in a room of Labour politicians. Conservative Hans Sørum tried to enter the room, and took a grip of Kristian Dimmen's tie. This proved the closest there had been to a direct fight in the city council. Gjærevoll was elected mayor.Kjenstad, 2005: 279–80 =New trams= In 1979, TT started working on the process of ordering new trams. The whole fleet of Class 7 trams was from 1958, and these would soon need replacement. Invitations to tenders were sent in July 1980. A study trip was taken by seven people to the factories of ČKD Tatra in Czechoslovakia and Düwag in Germany. They also looked at the tramways in Brno and Essen. By 1 December, eight bids had come in from La Brugeoise et Nivelles (BN), Linke-Hofmann-Busch (LHB), Strømmens Værksted, Düwag, Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft, Valmet, Waggon Union and Pragoinvest/Tatra.Kjenstad, 2005: 280–81 Only LHB and Valmet would deliver the special wide trams used in Trondheim. The bid from Tatra was the cheapest (at NOK 2.2 million per tram), but 33 units would be needed, since they would have to run as double units. An alternative with using ten of the newest trailers. The committee instead chose to the articulated, six-axle, tram from LHB as the Class 8. For both lines, trams would be needed, costing NOK 80 million. Various suggestions were made to avoid a full load financing. This included using NOK 20 million from the parking fund, but despite the matter being considered by the government, the money was never used.Kjenstad, 2005: 282 =Only one line= Dalsenget Depot In 1981, the schedules were changed. 10-minute headways were reduced to 12 minutes, and to 20 minutes outside rush hour. Reduced state subsidies reduced schedules throughout the TT network in 1982, and again in 1983. Ridership declined 13.7% in 1982, to 12.7 million, while the tram had 4.3 million. The support for the tram among the tram- friendly parties started declining in the early 1980s. Both the Labour, Liberal and Socialist Left Party had several members who became opposed to tram operations. On 26 November 1981, the city council decided to consider reducing the number of trams to eleven, and close line 2, from Voldsminde to Elgeseter. To save the line, Ulf Ulseth suggested using the old stock on line 2.Kjenstad, 2005: 283 The chief of administration made a proposal to close line 2. The overlapping traffic could be taken over by the trams, and the traffic to Elgeseter could be taken over by southbound buses. This would force the main depot, located at Dalsenget, to be closed. The depot at Munkvoll was suggested rebuilt for NOK 34 million, including NOK 11 for machines. Dalsenget was valuated at NOK 15 million, and proposed sold. Ulseth's proposal would require five trams in route, demanding ten in total. This would also require NOK 6.5 million upgrade to the Elgeseter Line, plus new trams for line 2 around 1990. The new trams would increase the annual capital costs with 1.6 million, but reduce operating costs with NOK 1.2 million. One line would cost NOK 2.9 million per year, with investments of NOK 19.3 million. Two lines would cost 5.7 million to operate, and require investments of NOK 22 million. The labor union supported two lines, noting that expansion southwards and eastwards would be impossible with the lines abandoned, and that there would be no excess capacity in the new depot at Dalsenget. They also claimed operation could be rationalized by NOK 4.4 million at Dalsenget, and that old trams could be operated beyond 1990.Kjenstad, 2005: 283–84 On 27 May 1982, the board of TT voted five against two for Ulseth's suggestion to keep two lines, and change the trams to run Lian–Lade and Elgeseter–Voldsminde. The votes for a single line were by Conservative Jens Trøtteberg and Liberal Merie Widerøe. In July, the executive committee of the city council voted to have only one new line, buy eleven trams and build a new depot. On 26 August 1982, the city council considered the matter. With 43 against 42 votes the city council voted to close down the whole tram line. However, since that proposal was not on the protocol, the matter would have to be voted over a second time. It turned out that two members of the Socialist Left Party, Sigrid Irtun and Petra Johansen, had been away during the first voting. Irtun had been told by the party leadership to stay home, while Johansen had left the party and did not meet on a regular basis. Both women met to the final voting, and with 44 against 41 votes the city council decided to keep the tramway, but close the Elgeseter Line. Eleven trams were ordered, and a new depot was to be built. The executive committee agreed to the NOK 62 million contract with LHB on 29 September.Kjenstad, 2005: 284–85 Intermezzo A Class 8 tram in Dronningens gate The change of schedules was changed from the winter routes in 1982. Both had a 12-minutes headway during rush hour, while line 1 (Lian–Lade) had a 20-minute headway in the evening, and line 2 (Elgeseter–Voldsminde) had 24 minutes. Line 2 did not operate on Sundays. 11 June 1983 was the last day with line 2 in service. The cities newest depot was razed, and Dalsenget had all depot service from 2 May 1983. The city's tramway network was reduced to , but the headway changed to 10 minutes. 1983 gave an operating deficit of NOK 18.4 million. The first year after line 2 was closed, traffic sank 41%, from 4.3 to 2.5 million passengers.Kjenstad, 2005: 287–88 With the delivery of new trams, operational costs would be reduced. A new washing hall would replace cleaners; combined with reduced maintenance on new trams, it would give a reduction from 40 to 13 depot employees. Line employees would be reduced from 27 to 5–6 after the upgrade to concrete sleepers was finished on the Gråkallen Line. The articulated trams would not need conductors used in the trailers, and an additional 20 jobs could be removed.Kjenstad, 2005: 288 Due to errors in the decision documents regarding the cost of the new depot. Instead of a net cost of NOK 21 million, it increased to NOK 40 million—several costs had been forgotten, and NOK 9.7 million in new machinery had to be dropped. This showed that it would have been cheaper to keep the depot at Dalsenget, and just use the tracks to Elgeseter for transport to the depot. However, on 16 August 1984, the city council decided to transfer Dalsenget to a municipal property company, and develop it as a \\"techno stable\\" for new ventures. Therefore, the possible sales price would not go to reducing the debt to finance the new depot at Munkvoll. Combined with the unwillingness to use the parking funds, this resulted in 100% loan financing of the depot and the trams, the most expensive method. The new depot at Munkvoll opened 6 June 1984.Kjenstad, 2005: 289–92 The first articulated tram came to Trondheim on 29 July 1984. It was stored at Voldsminde, while part of the track through the city center was removed for maintenance. The first test run was on 22 August, and the last tram was delivered on 4 January 1985. The track on the Gråkallen Line was replaced, and a new packing machine was bought. The platforms on the Gråkallen Line had to be rebuilt to a lower platform height. On 28 March 1985, the city council voted to transform TT into a limited company. In 1986, tram ridership increased by 2.4%.Kjenstad, 2005: 294–95 New debate =Sale of trams?= Munkvoll Depot: The new depot on the left, heritage trams stored to the right After new trams, track and depot were in place, the tramway debate started again. In 1985, the city council voted for a full economic analysis of the costs of trams versus diesel buses. The question was if it would be possible to sell the trams to other cities. Trondheim had chosen an unusual combination of meter gauge and wide wagons. Oslo Sporveier was considered as a possible purchaser, but then the trams would have to be rebuilt, costing NOK 1.9 million per unit. Also, Oslo Sporveier had slightly larger trams, and felt the Class 8 was too small for their needs. Conservative chair of Oslo Sporveier, Haakon Magnus Preus said live at a public meeting for the labor union in January that they did not want the trams. TT still felt that it would be possible to sell the trams for NOK 45 million.Kjenstad, 2005: 298–99 Another problem was how to serve the population along the Gråkallen Line by bus. While there were roads to Lade, they were not suitable in Byåsen. Uglaveien would have to be upgraded for NOK 12.6 million, and new road following the right-of- way, and a rebuilding of the intersection with General Bangs vei. Total costs would be NOK 17 million. Costs were reduced to NOK 6.3 by only building a single lane road from Kyvannet to Lian. In addition, NOK 6 million was estimated as income from sale of the right-of-way. TT suggested two new bus routes: Lian–Munkvoll–Bøckmans vei–Stavne–Midtbyen–Lade and Breidablikk–Byåsenveien–Midtbyen–Lade. TT claimed they could save NOK 19 million by closing down the tramway.Kjenstad, 2005: 299–300 =More reports= An alternative report was launched by business administration student Knut Myhre. It showed that the TT report had false premises, since it had calculated the amortization from 1987 to 2000, as compared to the end of the economic lifetime of the trams around 2020. Other parts of the methodology were also criticized. The chair of TT, Ove Dalheim (Labour), and chief of administration, Axel Buch, both supported the closing of the tram. Dahlheim, a railway employee and a former member of the Communist Party, had been an eager supporter of the tramway, but subsequently changed his mind.Kjenstad, 2005: 300–301 Rolv Sverre Fostervold from the Labour Party suggested new expansions of the tramway. Parts of the Labour Party, as well as the Centre, Liberal and Socialist Left Party agreed to demand a new report exploring extending the tramway from Munkvoll to Vikåsen and Heimdal. TT's new report in 1986 was criticized, and another report by the external consultants A. R. Reinertsen, Asplan and Vattbyggnadsbyrået was instead published in 1987. This resulted in controversy on 5 November, when it was reported on the front page of newspapers that Gjærevoll and Fostervold had met with Reinertsen in the fall of 1986.Kjenstad, 2005: 302–303 The report proposed two new routes: Munkvoll–Saupstadringen–Kattem () and Mellomveien/Buran–Strindheim–Brundalen–Dragvoll–Nedre Vikåsen (). The lines would cost NOK 393 million to be divided equally between the two lines, and included a NOK 15 million track upgrade through the city center. A tunnel to Valentinlyst was again considered, as a better and cheaper route than the 1977 proposal had been outlined. 19 new trams would need to be ordered to operate the lines. The report claimed that it would cost 78 million more to operate than a bus system, but would result in noticeably less pollution. The models did not presume higher traffic for tram than for buses, despite previous evidence of the opposite. Also, most of the cost difference was related to the tramway having to pay the tracks itself, while the buses would use existing roadways.Kjenstad, 2005: 303 The report was criticized by the committee member Sivert Schevig, the representative from the employees, who felt that the report's conclusion was predetermined and the supporting material modified to support the conclusion. An opposing report was made by Knut Myhre and Rune Kjenstad, who claimed that the line would be built using overly expensive standards and that costs could be reduced by 30%. While they agreed that a full expansion was not feasible, they felt that shorter expansions should be considered more carefully. The opposing report claimed that closing the tramway would save NOK 6–7.8 million, while the initial report claimed that 19 million could be saved.Kjenstad, 2005: 303–304 =Closure= From 1983 to 1987, municipal subsidies to the tramway were reduced from NOK 18 to 15 million. However, the capital costs were NOK 23 million, so the tram had an operating profit of 8 million. The public debate had shifted from having a wide range of arguments, to being a fully economic debate. The Labour Party was in the decisive position, and in May 1987, its general meeting voted 71 against 25 to keep the tramway—but this time the council members were not bound to vote with the party. When the matter was decided in the city council on 18 July, nine Labour politicians chose vote for closure. Also members of the Socialist Left Party voted against the tramway, and with 53 votes against 32, the city council decided to abandon the cities whole tramway network. A memo from TT had circulated among the politicians, showing that the sales price for the trams and depot would increase, giving a saving of NOK 30 million if the tramway was closed. On 6 August, a haste paragraph was used by the executive committee to grant NOK 7.5 million to build a bus road from Ugla, and TT ordered 20 new buses for NOK 19.1 million.Kjenstad, 2005: 304–305 =A new political party= Many tram-friendly politicians were disappointed about how the Labour and Socialist Left Party had not been able to secure the tramway, despite a left-winged majority in the city council. Labour politician Asle B. Bjørgen and Centre politician Steinar Nygård founded a new part, the City List, that would found its political basis on support for the tram. Several other politicians from the Labour, Centre and Socialist Left parties also joined it. Following the 1987 election, the City List won six seats, and was larger than the Christian Democrats, the Liberals, the Centre Party and Red Electoral Alliance. In particular, the party had received many votes from areas that were served by the tram, such as Byåsen, Lademoen and Lade. The Labour Party was reduced from 35 to 31 councilors, while the Conservatives dropped from 28 to 21.Kjenstad, 2005: 305 After the election, the City List made a committee to find ways to rationalize operations, led by engineer Arne Vidar Hesjedal. Among the findings, was that while the trams were responsible for 15% of the traffic, they were paying 30% of the administrative overhead, and they were charged NOK 10 in administration per route kilometer. He also identified ways to reduce costs at the depot and with the infrastructure. It was also pointed out that since 1983, Oslo Sporveier had received state support for the tramway in Oslo on the same basis as the buses; Hesjedal presumed that such an agreement would now also be possible for Trondheim. If granted equal as buses per kilometer, this would give NOK 3 million in subsidies. Hesjedal claimed that the tramway could operate NOK 15 million cheaper than with the current cost structure, but this would require that it become a separate business unit within TT—just like Oslo Sporveier had done. The new CEO of TT, Arne J. Nymo, claimed that the result was not correct.Kjenstad, 2005: 306–307 In January, after the chief of administration had let the matter of the tramway again be voted over by the city council, the board of TT voted, with one vote's majority, in favor of keeping the trams. The board members from the City List and the Progress Party as well as the labor union's two members were sufficient to secure a majority. The City List had been part of the basis for the left-winged majority in the city council, and had supported Per Berge as major. They now threatened that if Berge and the Labour Party voted in disfavor of keeping the tram, they would not support his reelection for major in 1989. Given that the City List had the decisive vote in the council, this was a credible threat. During the proceedings in the city council on 27 May 1988, CEO Nymo chose to argue along the line of the administration, and not the company's board. With 50 votes against 35, the city council finally voted to abandon the tramway. Due to Nymo's disloyalty to the board, either he or the board had to retire. On 8 August, a new board was appointed, without members from the City List.Kjenstad, 2005: 306–314 =The last tram runs= The last tram ran on 12 June,Modern Tramway, September 1988, p. 328. Ian Allan Publishing/Light Rail Transit Association (UK). carrying about 20,000 passengers. All the trams were then parked in Voldsminde Depot, while the heritage trams were moved to Munkvoll.Modern Tramway, October 1988, p. 364. Ian Allan Publishing/Light Rail Transit Association (UK). The Gråkallen Line, including the Ila Line and the St. Olavs gate loop, would be spared, and would become a heritage tramway, with a tramway museum at Munkvoll. The Class 8 trams would be stored at Voldsminde until a suitable purchaser could be found. At Voldsminde, located just beside the Nordland Line, they could be freighted away by train. With the start of roadworks in Prinsens gate on 14 June, a section of track through the city center was removed, making the tracks east of that point unusable,Kjenstad, 2005: 309–313 and the overhead wiring was soon removed over the entire city centre–Lade section. Reincarnation One of the AS Gråkallbanen's trams at the terminus St. Olavs GateFriends of the Gråkall Line () was founded in October 1988. It attracted many local people in Byåsen who were dissatisfied with the bus service, along with many tram enthusiasts, and politicians from Bylista. This resulted in AS Gråkallbanen being founded. It proposed a more rational operation of the line, limited to the remaining right-of-way from St. Olavs Gate to Lian. The company offered a back door to several politicians, since it claimed it could operate the tram without municipal subsidies.Kjenstad, 2005: 321–329 On 22 June 1989, the city council voted to re-open the line from St. Olavs Gate to Lian. After the matter was re-considered on 31 August, it passed with 42 votes against 40. The company was free to receive subsidies from the county and the state. The new company started negotiating with TT about the details of the take-over. In particular, the number of trams to be used was a difficult matter. Gråkallbanen wanted all eleven, while TT only would give up six. In the end the politicians voted to give seven to the new company. Since the tram lines were presumed to be kept for the museum line, Gråkallbanen was not charged the extra NOK 135,000 for maintaining the tracks on the roads. The city also accepted to take economic responsibility for the heritage trams. During the discussions, TT demanded that the municipality pay NOK 23.8 million for the trams, depots and other material, but this was rejected by the city. The city also chose to give NOK 5 million to Gråkallbanen as a one-time payment, equal to the subsidies they were giving TT to operate the new bus routes in Byåsen. The negotiated agreement was passed with 51 against 34 votes in the city council. After all the agreements were in place, TT announced on 30 December 1989 that it had found a new buyer for the trams. An agreement had been made with the Copenhagen-based Unimex Engineering, who would sell the eleven trams to the Cairo Tramway. On 2 January 1990, TT sent a letter to Gråkallbanen giving them the option to purchase the trams for the same price as the Egyptions, at an estimated NOK 17–20 million. However, Gråkallbanen pointed out to the politicians that it was possible to purchase used articulated trams for DEM 20,000 from the Stuttgart Stadtbahn. The company took the press with it to Stuttgart to negotiate the agreement, and the following Adresseavisen presented the cities new trams to the people. However, by the time the delegation had returned, they were informed that the deal had been annulled. Adresseavisen tried to locate Unimex in Copenhagen, but it turned out to be a company that had never sold a tram. At a press conference in Trondheim, the director of TT blamed Arbeider-Avisa's journalists for the deal not going through. When asked about the matter, representatives from the tramway company in Kairo said that the deal did not go through because the trams did not fit. =Reopening= The final decision to restart the trams was made by the city council on 29 March 1990. In the meantime, the City List had changed their political support for the 1989 mayor election. Instead of supporting the Labour candidate Per Berge, they instead chose to support the Conservative Marvin Wiseth—who took over as mayor 1 January 1990. The Conservative Party was more than willing to support any suggestions that involved privatization. After this, the right-winged parties succeeded at keeping the mayor until 2003. On 9 June the overhead wires were powered up, and from 3 July there were test-runs with some of the historic trams. Tracks and substructure were replaced between Nyveibakken and Bergsli gate. A ballast tamper was rented from Germany, and the asphalt from Kyvannet to Herlofsonløypa was removed. Part of the work was done by volunteers. The night before 6 July, seven of the trams (no. 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9 and 11) were taken out of the depot at Lademoen, and moved by truck to Kongens gate, where they were put onto the Gråkall Line. They were then hauled by the working machine to Munkvoll. At noon the next day the first tram took a trial run in the city streets. They kept the TT colors, but were given the GB logo. At the same time they were renumbered (90–99, with holes). The official opening was on 18 August 1990, with a parade of historic trams leading the way. The traffic the first full year was 900,000 passengers annually, which is 20% higher than with the buses. Passenger numbers decreased until 1997, when they started rising somewhat. That year a bus corresponds with the tram at Breidablikk, and offers a correspondence with Marienborg, St. Olavs Hospital and Øya. During the 2000s the ridership stabilized somewhat at about 800,000. But in the latter part of the 2000s the ridership has begun to increase and is expected to continue to rise considerably as the city is introducing a more environmentally friendly scheme to reduce personal car use in the city (needs link to Miljøpakken).

The club fields teams in Gaelic football and Hurling, but is primarily known for hurling. The club participates in Cork GAA competitions. The club is a member of Carbery division of Cork GAA. History Kilbrittain GAA club was founded in 1904. It has been primarily a hurling club throughout its history, though it did play in the Cork Junior Football Championship final in 1926. Hurling has always been the first sport in the parish. From the beginning, especially in the 1920s, the club had some successes in the South-West division, winning 6 titles in a row and again in 1930, 1938, 1940, 1941 and 1942. Yet despite all the success in their division, the club could never achieve the ultimate, the Cork Junior Hurling Championship. From the late 1940s until the 1970s, success was very rare. The first breakthrough came in 1978 when Kilbrittain, after a lapse of 36 years, again won the Flyer Nyhan Cup or the South-West Junior Hurling Championship. Although they were beaten by Kinsale in the Cork Junior Hurling Championship, the seeds were sown for the success that would follow. In 1984, Kilbrittain reached the final of the Cork Junior Hurling Championship only to be defeated by Midleton. Kilbrittain came roaring back the next year 1985, to defeat Cobh in the final to win its first county title after 81 years. In 1994 the Carbery divisional team won the Cork Senior Hurling Championship title with a strong number of Kilbrittain players on the team, 5 playing on the team with 2 subs.

This community are also known as the Sangat community and are comprised majorly of Sikh. Today in the United Kingdom there are significant numbers of Sikhs with Bhat ancestry, as there are in India. The majority Bhat Sikhs originate from Punjab and were among the first followers of Guru Nanak in the Punjab community, in India they are classed as raja people (kings) and are well respected people. In the Punjab most Bhat Sikhs are now in Patiala, Amritsar, Nawanshahr, Hoshiarpur, Gurdaspur or Bhathinda districts, or in Jalandhar or Chandigarh; they also dwell in other parts of India such as Delhi. Bhat Brahmin priests were engaged in attaining the highest 'spiritual' knowledge (brahmavidya) of Brahman and adhered to different branches (shakhas) of the Vedas. The Brahmin priest was responsible for religious rituals in temples and homes of Hindus. They were authorised (after rigorous training in vedas and 'sacred' rituals) as liaisons between humans and God. In general, as family vocations and businesses are inherited, priesthood is also inherited among Brahmin priestly families. Brahmins are located at the top of the caste pyramid and were followed by the Khastriya (Kings, Warriors), Vaishyas (Merchants, Landlords), Shudras (Servants) and finally the untouchables (street cleaners, leather workers etc). The arrival of Islamic invaders in the north of India saw a large scale upheaval for the Hindu Bhat Brahmin's, as many Hindu temples were destroyed leading to the unsettled lives for the fleeing Hindu Bhats. The birth of Sikhism in the north of India caused many Hindu Bhats and some other types of Hindus to embrace the teachings of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, becoming Sikh Bhats or Bhatras, etc. The Bhat Sikhs were devoted followers of the Sikh Gurus, where they used there hereditary skills as priests and scribes to recite poetry, write down events, take part in religious discussions and as missionaries. As religious intolerance continued the Bhat Sikh took part in many of the Gurus campaigns against persecution on and intolerance. The Bhats contributed 123 compositions in the Sri Guru Granth Sahib (pp. 1389–1409), known as the \\"Bhata de Savaiyye\\". They also wrote the Bhat Vahis, which were scrolls or records on the Gurus and Sikhism maintained by the Bhat Sikhs. In recent times the Bhat Sikhs went on to travel and establish Sikh temples, around the globe mainly in the UK, Canada and the USA. Today's Bhat Sikhs have varied professions. In Andhra Pradesh and Tamilnadu, people who belong to the Hindu caste \\"Bhatraju\\" are said to have migrated from the north of India to the south, during the relocation of the Kakatiya king. The Bhatraju clan reside in the villages of Killianwali, Introduction to the Bhatra Sikhs The Bhatra Sikhs were originally northern hindu Saraswat Brahmins who eventually became Sikhs, these Brahmins were autochthonous inhabitants who helped found the Indus-Saraswati civilization during 4000-2000BC. They lived in the 700+ archeological sites discovered along the former Saraswati River that once flowed parallel to the Indus in present day Kashmir, Himachal, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan regions. As the intellectual and priestly class of that ancient civilization, they are highly respected and honored for creating the world's oldest literary and religious traditions. They were the original propagators (some argue composers too) of the revered texts such as the Vedas and the Upanishads and took these texts into other parts of South Asia. They are considered to be the descendants of the revered Brahmin, Sage Saraswat Muni, who lived on the banks of the ancient river Saraswati. Around 1900 BC, the river Saraswati started vanishing under ground and the people on its banks started migrating to other parts of South Asia thus forming sub-communities. During the Islamic invasions of modern day Pakistan and india, many Saraswat Brahmins were forced to flee due to religious oppression. Such as the saraswat Brahmin Kashmiri Pandit. =Sikhism= The destruction of Hindu temples in India during the Islamic conquest of India occurred from the beginning of the Muslim conquest until the end the Mughal Empire throughout the Indian subcontinent. In the book \\"Hindu Temples - What Happened to Them\\", Sita Ram Goel produced a politically contentious list of 2000 mosques that it is claimed were built on Hindu temples. Hindu temples- What happened to them During the 14th to 16th century many Saraswat Brahmins were forced to lead unsettled lifes, unable to practice their hereditary profession as Hindu priests, artists, teachers, scribes, technicians class (varna). They used their academia in their unsettled life travelling as scribes, genealogies, bards and astrologists. In the 15th century the religion of Sikhism was born causing many to follow the word of Guru Nanak Dev Ji. Further conversions of the Saraswat Brahmins Bhats to Sikhism were induced by a royal preacher by the name of Prince Baba Changa Bhat Rai. Bhatra tradition and Sikh text states their ancestors came from Punjab, where the Raja Shivnabh and his kingdom became the original 16th century followers of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism. The Raja's grandson Prince Baba Changa after studying and competing in competition for 14 years under the high Pandit Chetan Gir earned the title ‘Bhat Rai’ – the ‘Raja of Poets', and then settled himself and his followers all over India as missionaries to spread the word of Guru Nanak, where most of northern Saraswat Brahmin Bhat became Bhat Sikhs. The Bhats also contributed 123 compositions in the Sri Guru Granth Sahib (pp.1389–1409), known as the \\"Bhata de Savaiyye\\". They also wrote the Bhat Vahis, which were scrolls or records on the Gurus and Sikhism maintained by the Bhat Sikhs. As Guru Nanak and Sikhism do not support the caste system, the Bhat people do not consider themselves as a caste in the typical sense due to the message of Guru Nanak, but a clan within Sikhism linked by Guru Nanak which is not shackled by the caste system. The majority were from the northern Saraswat Brahmin caste (Bhat clan),(Bhat (surname)) as the Prince Baba Changa Bhat Rai although a kshatriya, trained under Brahmins scholars and shared the Bhat Brahmin heritage due to his passion for religion, many continued to be called the Bhat/Bhat-rai sikhs, eventually leading to the name Bhat-ra Sikh. The sangat also had many members from different areas of the Sikh caste spectrum, such as the Hindu Rajputs and Hindu Jats who joined due to Bhat sikh missionary efforts. The Ramaiya community of Uttar Pradesh is said to be a sub-clan of Bhatra origin.Sikh Encyclopedia Currently there are many Hindus and Muslims that share the Brahmin Bhat heritage.[^ https://books.google.com/books?id=QpjKpK7ywPIC&pg;=PA365&lpg;=PA365&dq;=History+of+kashmir+and+its+people&source;=bl&ots;=-RI_8tLrab&sig;=8d9tzPeeB5lAjaq9RZqzYO8QydA&hl;=en&ei;=ab9pSobcB46PkAXutZW4Cw&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=6] Today modern Bhat sikhs are commonly known to have pioneered many of the first Gurdwaras outside of India and have donated to various Gurdwaras. Sacrifice of Bhai Mati Das for the Sikh faith, being brutually killed by the Mughals, this image is from a Sikh History museum being run single handedly by one person in a small tin shed on way from Mohali to Sirhind in Punjab, India In the 17th century Bhats Bhai Mati Das and Bhai Sati Das were Saraswat Mohyal Brahmin and were disciples of the ninth Sikh Guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur (1621–1675). They were executed along with the Guru at the Kotwali (police-station) near the Sunehri Masjid in the Chandni Chowk area of Old Delhi, under the express orders of emperor Aurangzeb. Bhat Bhai Sati Das was wrapped in cotton wool and set on fire by the Mughal authorities for refusing to denounce his faith. His brother Bhat Bhai Mati Das was also tortured to death, by having his head sawn in two. On 16 December 1634 the Sikh forces under the command of Rai Jodh and Kirt Bhat waged a guerrilla attack on Mughal forces at night, whereby the Sikhs routed and defeated the enemy. Guru Sahib lost 1200 Saint Soldiers including Kirat Bhat Ji. On the other side Sameer Beg and his two sons Shams Beg and Qasim Beg were also killed. The Mughal forces fled to Lahore leaving behind the dead and wounded. After the Battle of Kartarpur, Guru Hargobind Sahib moved towards Kiratpur Sahib, which was under the rule of Raja Tara Chand (a hill state chief). Guru Sahib's entourage was suddenly ambushed by a contingent of royal forces under the command of Ahmed Khan in the village Palahi near Phagwara town on 29 April 1635. It caused considerable loss on the Guru's soldiers. In which Bhai Dasa Ji and Bhai Sohela Ji (sons of Ballu Bhat, and grandsons of Mula Bhat) sacrificed their lives.http://www.bhatra.co.uk Many Religious Bhats also went to fight as \\"warrior-saints\\" against Mughal persecution in the Khalsa campaign inspired by Guru Gobind Singh Ji. Since many Bhat lived as travelling missionaries, their mobility led them to depend on occupations which did not require a settled life. Bhat Kirat’s grandson Bhat Narbadh (son of Keso Singh) was in attendance to Guru Gobind Singh and accompanied him to Nanded (now Sachkand Hazur Sahib) where Guru Ji spent his last days. In the Bhat-Vahis, Bhat Narbadh records an entry, of the conferment of Guruship upon the Guru Granth Sahib in 1708 upon the death of Guru Gobind Singh. By the 19th century Bhat was the name of a caste or jati within the Indian tradition of social classes, each with its own occupation. Even though Sikhism itself does not support separation by caste, the social system meant that the Bhat followed a hereditary profession of missionaries, bards, scribes, poets and genealogists while some also foretold the future,HA Rose, Glossary of Tribes and Castes of the Punjab (Lahore 1883), quoted by Pradesh if they were considered to have clairvoyant or astrological ability's, most of which were from a Brahmin heritage, eventually becoming salesman due to economic change however it is not uncommon to see Bhats in other professions such as farming and retail. According to Nesfield as quoted in W. Crooke, The Tribes and Castes of the North Western India, 1896, Bhats frequently visited the courts of princes and the camps of warriors, recited their praises in public, and kept records of their genealogies. They have been praised for business acumen, described as people with \\"a spirit of enterprise\\". They were a small clan compared to others and many people in india did not know of them.Pradesh Though some lived in Lahore, many Bhat can trace their roots to villages around Sialkot and Gurdaspur Districts. In the 21st century due to the changing world and new opportunities which are available, Bhats have almost completely left their missionary and hereditary professions, to pursue careers in Engineering, Medicine, Law, Banking, Politics, Music etc. Origins According to the Sikh Encyclopedia, Bhat is related to the Sanskrit word bhatta, a bard or poet. =Raja Shivnabh and Prince Baba Changa Rai= Guru Nanak met Raja Shivnabh, who was the grandfather of Changa Rai. The Guru bestowed the title of sangat on the Raja and his people, united seven kingdoms and made the Raja Shivnabh leader of them all.Haqiqat Rah Muqam shivnabh raje ki page 624 [p.1248]khari Some scholars consider the Raja was the ruler of Batticaloa.For more on Guru Nanak's journey to Batticaloa/Batticola see: Kirpal Singh, Janamsakhi Tradition (Amritsar 2004) Theafter the grandson of Raja Shivnabh, Changa Rai or Changa Bhat, a disciple of Guru Nanak's mentioned in the Janamsakhis. Earned the title ‘Bhat Rai’ – the ‘Raja of Poets, and then settled himself and his few followers all over India as missionaries, where many Sikhs and general Indians became Bhat Sikhs., A congregation led by a teacher called Baba Changa Rai is described in an old document called the Haqiqat Rah Muqam.Haqiqat Rah Muqam \\"included in Bhai Banno's \\"bir\\", according to the Sikh Encyclopedia and others. The Sikh Encyclopedia discusses the link between Bhat Sikhs, Raja Shivnabh and Prince Changa Bhat, who became a disciple of Guru Nanak Dev Ji. Due to the Princes title ‘Bhat Rai’ he added Bhat to his name and spread the word of Guru Nanak to his followers, who also became known as Bhats or Bhatras. Bhatra Sikhs are said to have a mixed ancestry, the mass majority of Bhats were Punjabi saraswat Brahmin. The Northern traveling Saraswat Hindu Brahmins joined Sikhism due to the message of Guru Nanak Dev Ji and the preaching efforts of the Sikh prince Baba changa Bhat Rai. However, as by the commandment of Guru Nanak, caste discrimination was deemed as blasphemy and so the Sikh Bhats also have a mixed ancestry due to the missionary work of the Bhat prince and his followers to spread the message of Sikhism. Some Kambojas, Tarkhan, Jat, Rajput, Khatri, Gujjars and others also joined. Many Bhats are apart of the Khalsa and Nihang of Sikhism. M.S. Ahluwalia, a Senior Fellow at the Indian Council of Historical Research, New Delhi, offers historical evidence for Guru Nanak's presence in Sri Lanka, probably in the year 1510.M.S. Ahluwalia, Guru Nanak in Ceylon (Sikh Spectrum Quarterly 2004) A place called Singaldeep or Sangladeep is often mentioned in 'Hakikat-Rah-Mukaam-Shivnabh-Raje-Ki' and is stated to be in Sri Lanka. Bhat Sikhs in the United Kingdom Bhat Sikhs started to arrive in the United Kingdom in the 1920s, but most immigrated in the late 1940s or 1950s. In the 1920s some men travelled to Britain to work as door-to-door salesmen, most leaving their families in the Punjab to begin with. By the time of the Second World War there were a few hundred Sikhs clustered in British seaports like Liverpool, Cardiff, Bristol, and Southampton and Hull. Some returned to India when war broke out, but others stayed on and used contacts with Punjabi merchant seamen to import scarce goods. =Partition= The Partition of India in 1947 led many Sikhs to emigrate, and the Bhat population in the UK was greatly enlarged. Later arrivals tended to join relatives, friends and neighbours from the Punjab, so that some British Bhat communities have links to one or two particular villages.Nye Difficult journeys following Partition are not forgotten. The Edinburgh Sikh women's group (Sikh Sanjog) has exhibited artwork telling the story of leaving the Punjab and arriving in a strange land. A 2001 obituary of a senior figure in the Cardiff Bhat community described the trials of leaving northern India in turbulent times.Western Mail, 13 December 2001 =Jobs= The traditional Bhat profession of itinerant salesman, Business men and taxi drivers was useful to those arriving in the UK, and was \\"a skill with considerable potential\\". At first most Bhat, like some other Sikhs, worked either as doorstep or market traders (working with the Khatri community), but some settled in big cities like Leeds or Birmingham, gave up self-employment and took waged jobs in industry. (At this time many educated immigrants to Britain had difficulty finding employment suited to their qualifications and experience, because of racial and/or cultural prejudice.) Bhat traders gradually moved into other roles as self-employed businessmen, often specialising in retailing. By the end of the 1950s selling door-to-door was less common and many British Bhat Sikhs moved towards commercial enterprises like market stalls, shops, supermarkets and wholesale warehouses. ‘One group of Sikhs who kept their turbans were a group called Bhartedas (sic)’.The Irish Raj, 1997, p.174 =Gurdwaras= When possible the Bhat community have established Gurdwaras (temples). The first of which was opened in Manchester in 1953. As of 2006 there are more than 30 Bhat or Bhat Sikh temples in the UK, the newest being the one opened in Peterborough in 2004. In some British towns Bhats are a small proportion of the overall Sikh population (in Glasgow 5%); elsewhere, as in Edinburgh, they are in the majority. Many Bhats took the role of Gyanis in the newer established Gurdwara, especially in Luton and Leicester.

It combines the features of two former services from Google's DoubleClick subsidiary, DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP; formerly known as DART for Publishers) and DoubleClick Ad Exchange (AdX). Google Ad Manager initially used a second-price auction format, before announcing that it would be replaced with a first-price auction format in March 2019.  History  The Google Ad Manager platform started out as two distinct products of the, then independent, DoubleClick company: The DART for Publishers ad server and the DoubleClick Ad Exchange. Google acquired DoubleClick in 2007 securing both products as part of the sale. In 2010 DART was rebranded as DoubleClick for Publishers. A small business tier was introduced at the same time and the products became popularly known as DFP and DFP Small Business. In mid 2018 the product name changed again. This time the DoubleClick brand was dropped completely and DoubleClick for Publishers became Google Ad Manager. As well as a rebrand, this changed marked a point in the gradual merging of the two former DoubleClick products, with Ad Exchange now becoming a feature of Ad Manager rather than a stand-alone product. The rebrand to Google Ad Manager also saw the end of the Small Business label. The product still offers two tiers of service, but the lower tier is now Google Ad Manager, which the upper tier has been renamed Google Ad Manager 360. This product can sometimes be confused with the plural 'Google Ads Manager' more accurately known as 'Google Ads Editor' - software used to manage Google Ads campaigns outside of the web interface.  Functionality  To use Google Ad Manager, user first need an AdSense account. This is the Google's way to approve website to use premium tool and to keep up with its walled garden. User should have the working knowledge of adtech and understand the jargon.

He also taught at Pomona College and Vanderbilt University, and lectured in India, Japan, South Africa, England, and Hong Kong. Kaufman was an ordained minister in the Mennonite Church for 50 years. Early years Kaufman was born on June 22, 1925, in North Newton, Kansas. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Bethel College in 1947. He earned his Master of Arts degree in sociology from Northwestern University in 1948, a Bachelor of Divinity degree from Yale Divinity School in 1951, and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in philosophical theology from Yale University in 1955. His dissertation was titled The Problem of Relativism and the Possibility of Metaphysics. In 1961–1962 he completed a postdoctoral fellowship as a Fulbright Fellow at the University of Tübingen in Germany. Career In addition to Kaufman's long tenure at Harvard Divinity School, he was a past president of the American Academy of Religion (1982) American Academy of Religion and of the American Theological Society, as well as a member of the Society for Buddhist-Christian Studies. Kaufman was the author of 13 books, which influenced how many mainline Christians have considered God language and religious naturalism. Among these are An Essay on Theological Method, God The Problem, Theology for a Nuclear Age, and In the Face of Mystery. This last work earned him the 1995 American Academy of Religion Award for excellence among constructive books in religion. He participated for many years in the discussions on religious naturalism at the Highlands Institute for American Religious and Philosophical Thought and the Institute on Religion in an Age of Science (Lecturer 2006) A Religious Interpretation of Emergence: Creativity as God He was the subject of two Festschriften. Views on God In a review of Kaufman's In The Beginning ... Creativity:Amazon Book Review In a second review of In the Beginning ... Creativity:Developing Theology Developing Theology Kaufman in his Prairie View lectures says:Mennonite Life December 2005, vol. 60 no. 4 A Zygon abstract on a Kaufman article states: =God as mystery= For Kaufman, the only \\"available referent\\" for the word God is the construct we hold in our minds, a construct that has developed over the centuries. There may be a \\"real referent\\", but even if there is, it remains \\"a transcendent unknown\\". Thus, Kaufman thinks of God as \\"ultimate mystery\\". He does not speculate whether there is an \\"extra-human reality\\" called God. Thus, as a theologian, he views his work as dealing with \\"profound, ultimately unfathomable, mystery\\". Hence the resultant is a \\"theology within the limits of reason alone\\", holding with Kant the imaginative construction of basic concepts of religious ideas. Thus, Kaufman developed a \\"generic theology\\" for postmodern Christians of \\"an utterly transcendent God\\". The \\"ultimate mystery\\" called \\"God\\" serves as a living symbol in our culture. For many people, it functions as the primary point for \\"orientation and devotion.\\" Being oriented on the \\"ultimate mystery in things\\" is an awareness of one's \\"bafflement of mind\\" over the mystery \\"that there is something and not nothing.\\" When the mystery is thought of as God, it evokes not only bafflement but trust and confidence.

He took part in the Balkan Wars and World War I and afterwards served as the president of the Association of Serb Chetniks for Freedom and the Fatherland in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Beginning in 1941 he collaborated with the Italians under the awareness and condonation of supreme Chetnik commander Draža Mihailović. In the spring of 1942, he was appointed by Mihailović as the commander of Chetniks in Dalmatia, Herzegovina, western Bosnia and southwestern Croatia. In October 1942, Trifunović-Birčanin and his subordinate commanders, Dobroslav Jevđević and Petar Baćović, were responsible for the killing of over 500 Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat civilians in the Prozor region in October 1942. He died in Split on 3 February 1943, having suffered from poor health for a considerable period of time. Early life Birčanin and his band, 1907. Ilija Trifunović-Birčanin was born in Topola, Principality of Serbia in 1877. He served as a volunteer on the Serbian side in the Balkan Wars. He also fought with Serb forces during World War I, attaining the rank of Chetnik commander () and losing an arm in combat. Following the war, Trifunović-Birčanin fought against Albanian forces in Kosovo. From 1929 to 1932, during a period in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia when other political parties were banned, he served as president of the Association of Serb Chetniks for Freedom and the Fatherland. After 1932, he served as chairman of the Narodna Odbrana (National Defence), a Serbian patriotic association composed mainly of World War I veterans. In 1934, he formed and became the leader of the Organization for Chetnik Veterans. Yugoslav coup d'etat An organisation with considerable influence with the Serbian public, Narodna Odbrana petitioned Prince Paul on various occasions urging him to resist pressure from Adolf Hitler for Yugoslavia to join the Tripartite Pact. Trifunović-Birčanin was in close contact at this time with the British Special Operations Executive (SOE), which was actively attempting to prevent Yugoslavia from joining the Axis powers. SOE funded the Narodna Odbrana and established especially close ties to Trifunović-Birčanin. After discovering that Yugoslav Prime Minister Dragiša Cvetković and Foreign Minister Aleksander Cincar-Marković were travelling to Vienna on 24 March 1941 to sign a limited form of the Pact, the SOE opted to foment a coup d'etat. According to Williams, Trifunović-Birčanin was closely involved in its preparation and execution, informing the SOE that the coup was 99% certain to succeed and that preparations were making good progress. In contrast, Professor Jozo Tomasevich states that whilst Trifunović-Birčanin was probably informed of the coup, he was not among its organisers. The coup by predominantly Serbian military officers led by the Head of the Air Force General Dušan Simović took place on 27 March, and Prince Paul was replaced by King Peter II. Within days, it became clear that Simović was not as anti-Axis as the SOE had hoped, and Trifunović-Birčanin and others began \\"discussing the possibility of a second coup\\". World War II =Move to Split and Italian collaboration= Report of Chetnik general staff officer Ivanišević from Split on Trifunović-Birčanin's cooperation with the Italians. With the defeat of Yugoslavia, Trifunović-Birčanin fled to Kolašin in Montenegro before moving to the Italian-controlled city of Split in October 1941. The Chetnik movement was openly and deeply hostile to the nascent Yugoslav Partisans, and this led to Chetnik commanders negotiating a series of local co-operation agreements with Italian occupying forces, based on the strong mutual wish that the Partisan insurrection be extinguished. In essence, these agreements were that Italian and Chetnik forces would leave one another alone, and in return there would be an end to persecution of Serbs by the Italians. One such Chetnik-Italian agreement was concluded at a meeting in Split on 20 October 1941 by Trifunović-Birčanin, Dobroslav Jevđević, a leading Chetnik in the inter-war kingdom, and Angelo de Matteis, head of the information division of the Italian 6th Army Corps. Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović was aware of the collaborationist arrangements entered by Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin and condoned them. In addition to Jevđević, with whom he worked closely on liaison with the Italian forces, Trifunović-Birčanin's subordinate commanders included Momčilo Đujić (northern Dalmatia), Ilija Mihić and Slavko Bjelajac (Lika), and Petar Baćović (Herzegovina and southeastern Bosnia). In early January 1942, Trifunović-Birčanin played a central role in organizing the units of Chetnik leaders in western Bosnia, Lika, and northern Dalmatia into the Dinara Division and dispatched former Royal Yugoslav Army officer to help. Đujić was to be the commander of the division and its goal was for the \\"establishment of a Serb national state\\" in which \\"an exclusively Orthodox population is to live.\\" In the same month General Renzo Dalmazzo, Italian Sixth Army Corps commander organised a meeting in the hope that the Chetniks would take part in a joint operation against the Partisans. This was attended by Trifunović- Birčanin, Jevđević, Jezdimir Dangić and Stevo Rađenović, although \\"for the time being, however, the Germans vetoed any use of the Chetniks in such a capacity\\". Based in Split, Trifunović-Birčanin was appointed by Mihailović to command Chetnik forces over Dalmatia, Herzegovina, western Bosnia and southwestern Croatia in the spring of 1942. According to historian Jozo Tomasevich, \\"both Chetnik and Italian documents clearly show that his role as liaison officer between the Chetniks and the Italian Second Army was just as important as his command over the Chetnik formations in those areas.\\" On 23 June 1942, assisted by Trifunović-Birčanin, the Italians set up the first units of an Italian-controlled Anti-Communist Volunteer Militia known as MVAC (), dedicated to \\"the annihilation of communism\\". In 1942 and 1943, 19,000–20,000 Chetniks, an overwhelming proportion of which were organised as Italian auxiliary forces in the MVAC in the Italian-occupied parts of the NDH, were equipped with arms, ammunition and clothing by the Italians. In 1942, the agreements with the Italians came under threat when they \\"threatened to cut off provisions and funding\\" after warning Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin that \\"their units were provoking disorder.\\" =Operation Alfa= Beginning in September 1942, the Chetniks attempted to persuade the Italians into carrying out a \\"large operation\\" within their occupation zone. On 10 and 21 September, Trifunović-Birčanin met with Mario Roatta, commander of the Italian Second Army, and urged him to take action \\"as soon as possible\\" in a large operation against the Yugoslav Partisans in the Prozor-Livno area and offered aid in the form of 7,500 Chetniks on the condition that they be provided the necessary arms and supplies. In the meeting on 10 September, Trifunović-Birčanin told Roatta that he was not under the command of Mihailović, but that he had seen him on 21 July in Avtovac and had his approval in collaborating with the Italians. In late September or early October, Mihailović, responding to a letter from Trifunović-Birčanin dated 20 September, congratulated him on his conduct and \\"high comprehension of the national line\\" in these talks. In early October, Operation Alfa was launched by the Italians and targeted Partisans northwest of the middle part of the Neretva. Between 3,000–5,500 Chetniks took part in the operation and were under the command of Baćović and Jevđević. The Chetniks, acting on their own, massacred over five hundred Catholics and Muslims and burnt numerous villages in the process of the operation. According to incomplete data, around 543 Catholic and Muslim civilians were massacred on the pretense that they had harbored and aided the Partisans. Roatta objected to these \\"massive slaughters\\" of noncombatant civilians and threatened to halt Italian aid to the Chetniks if they did not end. He stated that \\"I request that Commander Trifunović be apprised that if the Chetnik violence against the Croatian and Muslim population is not immediately stopped, we will stop supplying food and daily wages to those formations whose members are perpetrators of the violence. If this criminal situation continues, more severe measures will be undertaken.\\" Death Having been in poor health for a considerable period, Trifunović-Birčanin died in Split on 3 February 1943. Following his death, Jevđević, along with Đujić, Baćović, and Radovan Ivanišević vowed to the Italians to carry on Trifunović-Birčanin's policies of closely collaborating with them against the Partisans.

Sparsely populated, inhabited areas are the hamlets of Brookdale and Boileau and also around the Maskinongé Bay and Loup, Champagneur, and Cross Lakes. History The area was first named Ponsonby on the Gale and Duberger map of 1795. In all likelihood, it was named after a town in Cumberland County, England. It is also possible that it was named in honour of any of several noted persons called Ponsonby, including the Postmaster General of Canada of 1784, William Ponsonby (1744-1806). Settlers were attracted to the area by the nature's beauty and resources. They were generally from Ireland and England, or the nearby villages of Calumet and Grenville. In 1876, the Township of Ponsonby was proclaimed. In 1880, the Parish of Sainte-Valérie was formed, and a year later the Boileau post office opened, named after the first postmaster, Pierre Boileau. In 1882, the Township Municipality of Ponsonby was established. Because the village was better known as Boileau and Ponsonby was limited to purely administrative use, the municipal authorities, with the support of the majority of the population, were granted the official name change from Ponsonby to Boileau in 1993.

The song was so popular, in fact, that it soon bumped a song by the more well- known Wang Fei out of the opening position for the show. During promotion of their album, Beauty4 performed before tens of thousands, sharing the stage with many recognized artists, including their \\"brother\\" group B.A.D. (also on EMI), May Day, Karen Mok, and one of their favorite Mandarin bands, Sticky Rice. They even performed a concert with the Canadian band The Moffatts, whose popular song \\"Bang Bang Boom\\" was re-made by Beauty4 in Mandarin. Beauty4's songs made the Top 20 video countdowns on Channel V and MTV in Taiwan. Their album was also released in mainland China, although two of their songs, \\"Gay Guy\\", penned by Cheng in a combination of English, Mandarin, and Taiwanese and lamented how all the cute boys she meets turn out to be gay, and \\"San Gu Liu Pau,\\" were banned. The group was also booked for many endorsements and commercials, including full commercial and print campaigns for the Jian Fu San amusement park and Bao Dao Mei Mei watch company. Cheng also became known for her acting skills, playing the role of mean girl Bai-He in the international Chinese hit and evening soap Meteor Garden. Ayesha, Anji and Djavan also appeared on the show in cameo roles as girlfriends of the show’s stars. Anji later appeared in the role of Maria on Yamada Tarō Monogatari, another Chinese soap. Beauty4 ultimately split due to differences with their management and difficulties being accepted as a foreign-looking group on Asian soil. Although Anji Clubb was a red-haired Caucasian American, and Ayesha Adamo an American exchange student with blonde and pink hair, the rest of the group (and thus half of it) was, in fact, of Taiwanese ethnicity, yet this did not seem to be enough for Beauty4 to truly fit in with the Taiwanese popular culture of the time. It seemed not to matter that the group's language skills were strong enough to be able to take over the hosting duties on the morning talk radio show on Taipei’s Power 98.9 for an entire week, or that their involvement in Taiwanese culture was enough to be able to participate in its variety shows and Chinese New Year events (they even gave a concert to the Republic of China Army on the island of Kinmen for example). At one of their New Year’s Eve performances, Anji Clubb, moved to tears at the sight of fans singing along with all the words to \\"Ai Ai Ai\\", expressed the feelings of the group by saying, \\"I've lived in Taiwan for so many years, all along living with Taiwanese people. I consider this place my home. I hope that everyone won't keep thinking of Beauty4 as foreigners; we'd like everyone to think of us as a part of what Taiwan is.\\" Members before and after Beauty4 Anji Clubb came to Taiwan as a nine-year-old and spent several years of elementary school in the Taiwanese school system, making her Mandarin completely fluent. After the breakup of Beauty4, Clubb returned to the US, having spent half of her life overseas, and recently graduated from Georgetown University, though she also took time to study in Beijing. She is currently the China Programs Associate at Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids,\\"Campaign Staff.\\" http://www.tobaccofreekids.org/organization/staff.shtml a non-profit organization with programs in the U.S. and abroad. Belinda Cheng, the jet- haired Chinese-American, was the first to audition for the group's management company. She auditioned in California, where she was born and raised. Belinda Cheng returned to Los Angeles after the group's breakup and graduated from UCLA. She is now working at Disney Interactive Studios and working towards an MBA at UCLA. The blonde and pink-haired Ayesha Adamo was a Columbia University student spending the summer in Taiwan studying Chinese when she auditioned and found her way into the group. Although she had only studied Chinese at college for one year, she was able to keep up with the challenges of singing and interviewing in Mandarin. Adamo released a mix album that was a double CD box set as a DJ on Hinote Records in Taiwan. She graduated with a degree in music from Barnard College, and completed the two-year acting program at William Esper Studios. She performed at Radio City Music Hall in New York with Mandarin pop star Qsi Qsin for the a New Year's Concert in 2006. She is currently acting, deejaying, and recording new music. Finally, the curly- haired, oft-mistaken-for-African-American Djavan Lin was born and raised in Taiwan, and is of Taiwanese aboriginal origin. Djavan Lin has continued her singing career, and performed on CTV Network’s popular singing competition. She is currently singing and performing in Macau.

According to Pohl, Phillifent's opinion of \\"the diagnostic cut ... between science fiction and all other forms of writing\\" was that science fiction \\"was unique in that it was invariably written by 'the science-fiction method' analogous to the 'scientific method' which ... underpins all science.\\" Pohl's own description of \\"the science- fiction method\\" (which Phillifent himself never troubled to define) is that \\"it consists in looking at the world around us, dissecting it into its component parts, throwing some of those parts away and replacing them with invented new ones - and then reassembling that new world and describing what might happen in it.

The farce takes place inside an American Embassy behind the Iron Curtain. Although Allen contributed material for the 1960 Broadway musical revue From A to Z, this was his first professionally produced play. The play was described as being \\"near the hit line\\", \\"one big overfed American folk joke\\" and \\"a very funny situation comedy\\" by critic Otis L. Guernsey. Production Don't Drink the Water premiered on Broadway at the Morosco Theatre on November 17, 1966, and closed on April 20, 1968, after 598 performances at three different Broadway theaters. The cast included Lou Jacobi, Kay Medford and Anita Gillette as the Hollander family. Tony Roberts (Axel Magee) and Donna Mills (Sultan's First Wife) were also in the cast. Richard Libertini also appeared, as Father Drobney, and reprised the role in the 1969 film. The production was directed by Stanley Prager and produced by David Merrick with Charles H. Joffe and Jack Rollins. According to the book Conversations with Woody Allen by Eric Lax, Allen says that Vivian Vance was originally cast as the wife character, but agreed she was wrong for the part, so she was replaced by Kay Medford, who Allen believes brought the character to life. Plot In an unnamed European country behind the Iron Curtain, the American Ambassador must leave the Embassy for business. In his absence he places his incompetent son Axel Magee in charge. Almost immediately the Embassy is thrust into a crisis as the Hollanders, an American family of tourists, come rushing in on the run from the Communist police. Walter Hollander, the father, had accidentally snuck into a high security area and taken pictures, causing the communists to believe that the family are spies. Axel digs the hole deeper and the embassy is surrounded, leaving the Hollanders trapped. The parents, Walter and Marion, act buffoonishly and make business at the embassy difficult, especially after Walter insults a high- class Sultan. The family's adult daughter Susan bonds with Axel, causing him to develop feelings for her even though she is engaged. After the incident with the Sultan, Axel's father demotes him and elevates his favor-seeking assistant Kilroy into charge instead. Kilroy almost immediately fixes the problem and arranges an exchange for a communist spy in jail in America. The communist police head Krojack still believes that the Hollanders are spies and confronts Walter. Walter, assuming that he is free, jokingly admits that he is. Kilroy then announces that the exchange has been called off. Krojack plans to increase the hostilities against the embassy. Susan, having recently announced her engagement has been called off, kisses Axel to Walter's horror. Though there are now riots outside the embassy, Walter is much more concerned with Axel's and Susan's relationship. Axel and Susan come up with a plan to escape by using a party in the Sultan's honor as a cover while Father Drobney, a priest who has been hiding in a small room in the Embassy for six years, works out the details. Walter is given a gun for the escape and accidentally shoots and wounds Kilroy. During the party Walter and Marion go through several problems, mainly due to a number of revelations or near-revelations of their own secret identities. Upon finally making it out, Walter accidentally shoots someone again—it proves to be Axel's own father. The escape appears to have failed till Axel discovers that the Sultan and his wife are still in the house. Disguising Walter and Marion as the couple, they plan to continue with the original escape. As for Susan, Axel plans to give her diplomatic immunity as the wife of a diplomat: himself. Walter and Marion escape as Father Drobney marries Axel and Susan.

A group of cyclists felt a pressing need for an organization to advocate on behalf of the needs of cyclists after a period of time where two cyclists were killed by trucks and another two arrested on a Critical Mass ride. ARC was initially formed to lobby for a coroner's inquest and to help in the defense of the two cyclists arrested at Critical Mass. It has since expanded to provide support and legal advice to cyclists involved in accidents, to educate on cyclists' rights, and to hold direct actions aimed at changing society's dependence on the automobile.Advocacy for Respect for Cyclists website Coroner's Report In 1996, two cyclists were killed on the streets of Toronto, Erin Krauser and Martha Kennedy. With calls from ARC and other activists, the City began a coroner's investigation. Along with representatives of Toronto Police, Ontario's Ministry of Transportation, the City of Toronto, the Toronto Transit Commission and the trucking industry, injury prevention professionals, ARC's volunteers sat on the committee to examine the conditions for the deaths of these cyclists.Cycling Advocacy Group Calls for Action on Coroner's Report cars-suck.org The Coroner's report, titled A Report on Cycling Fatalities in Toronto 1986-1996: Recommendations for Reducing Cycling Injuries and Death was released in 1998.Toronto Coroner's Report 1998 The points of the report that ARC felt were the most likely to reduce cyclists' injuries and death were revisions to the Highway Traffic Act, in particular that cyclists have the right of way over cars and pedestrians the right of way over cyclists; the creation of comprehensive on-street bike lanes and off-street trails; and side guards on large trucks to reduce the chances of cyclists being 'sucked' in by the large wheels.

Although the terms e-marketing and digital marketing are still dominant in academia, social media marketing is becoming more popular for both practitioners and researchers. Most social media platforms have built-in data analytics tools, enabling companies to track the progress, success, and engagement of ad campaigns. Companies address a range of stakeholders through social media marketing, including current and potential customers, current and potential employees, journalists, bloggers, and the general public. On a strategic level, social media marketing includes the management of a marketing campaign, governance, setting the scope (e.g. more active or passive use) and the establishment of a firm's desired social media \\"culture\\" and \\"tone.\\" When using social media marketing, firms can allow customers and Internet users to post user-generated content (e.g., online comments, product reviews, etc.), also known as \\"earned media,\\" rather than use marketer-prepared advertising copy. Platforms =Social networking websites= Social networking websites allow individuals, businesses and other organizations to interact with one another and build relationships and communities online. When companies join these social channels, consumers can interact with them directly.Zhang, M., Jansen, B. J., and Chowdhury, A. (2011) Influence of Business Engagement in Online Word-of-mouth Communication on Twitter: A Path Analysis. Electronic Markets: The International Journal on Networked Business. 21(3), 161-175. That interaction can be more personal to users than traditional methods of outbound marketing and advertising. Social networking sites act as word of mouth or more precisely, e-word of mouth. The Internet's ability to reach billions across the globe has given online word of mouth a powerful voice and far reach. The ability to rapidly change buying patterns and product or service acquisition and activity to a growing number of consumers is defined as an influence network. Social networking sites and blogs allow followers to \\"retweet\\" or \\"repost\\" comments made by others about a product being promoted, which occurs quite frequently on some social media sites. By repeating the message, the user's connections are able to see the message, therefore reaching more people. Because the information about the product is being put out there and is getting repeated, more traffic is brought to the product/company. Social networking websites are based on building virtual communities that allow consumers to express their needs, wants and values, online. Social media marketing then connects these consumers and audiences to businesses that share the same needs, wants, and values. Through social networking sites, companies can keep in touch with individual followers. This personal interaction can instill a feeling of loyalty into followers and potential customers. Also, by choosing whom to follow on these sites, products can reach a very narrow target audience. Social networking sites also include much information about what products and services prospective clients might be interested in. Through the use of new semantic analysis technologies, marketers can detect buying signals, such as content shared by people and questions posted online. An understanding of buying signals can help sales people target relevant prospects and marketers run micro-targeted campaigns. In 2014, over 80% of business executives identified social media as an integral part of their business. Business retailers have seen 133% increases in their revenues from social media marketing.Bowden, J. (March 17, 2014). The Impact of Social Media Marketing Trends on Digital Marketing. socialmediatoday.com Some examples of popular social networking websites over the years are Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, MySpace, LinkedIn, and SnapChat. =Mobile phones= More than three billion people in the world are active on the Internet. Over the years, the Internet has continually gained more and more users, jumping from 738 million in 2000 all the way to 3.2 billion in 2015. Roughly 81% of the current population in the United States has some type of social media profile that they engage with frequently. Mobile phone usage is beneficial for social media marketing because of their web browsing capabilities which allow individuals immediate access to social networking sites. Mobile phones have altered the path-to- purchase process by allowing consumers to easily obtain pricing and product information in real time. They have also allowed companies to constantly remind and update their followers. Many companies are now putting QR (Quick Response) codes along with products for individuals to access the company website or online services with their smart phones. Retailers use QR codes to facilitate consumer interaction with brands by linking the code to brand websites, promotions, product information, and any other mobile-enabled content. In addition, Real-time bidding use in the mobile advertising industry is high and rising due to its value for on-the-go web browsing. In 2012, Nexage, a provider of real time bidding in mobile advertising reported a 37% increase in revenue each month. Adfonic, another mobile advertisement publishing platform, reported an increase of 22 billion ad requests that same year. Mobile devices have become increasingly popular, where 5.7 billion people are using them worldwide. This has played a role in the way consumers interact with media and has many further implications for TV ratings, advertising, mobile commerce, and more. Mobile media consumption such as mobile audio streaming or mobile video are on the rise – In the United States, more than 100 million users are projected to access online video content via mobile device. Mobile video revenue consists of pay-per-view downloads, advertising and subscriptions. As of 2013, worldwide mobile phone Internet user penetration was 73.4%. In 2017, figures suggest that more than 90% of Internet users will access online content through their phones. Strategies There are two basic strategies for using social media as a marketing tool: =Passive approach= Social media can be a useful source of market information and a way to hear customer perspectives. Blogs, content communities, and forums are platforms where individuals share their reviews and recommendations of brands, products, and services. Businesses are able to tap and analyze the customer voices and feedback generated in social media for marketing purposes; in this sense the social media is a relatively inexpensive source of market intelligence which can be used by marketers and managers to track and respond to consumer-identified problems and detect market opportunities. For example, the Internet erupted with videos and pictures of iPhone 6 \\"bend test\\" which showed that the coveted phone could be bent by hand pressure. The so-called \\"bend gate\\" controversy created confusion amongst customers who had waited months for the launch of the latest rendition of the iPhone. However, Apple promptly issued a statement saying that the problem was extremely rare and that the company had taken several steps to make the mobile device's case stronger and robust. Unlike traditional market research methods such as surveys, focus groups, and data mining which are time-consuming and costly, and which take weeks or even months to analyze, marketers can use social media to obtain 'live' or \\"real time\\" information about consumer behavior and viewpoints on a company's brand or products. This can be useful in the highly dynamic, competitive, fast-paced and global marketplace of the 2010s. =Active approach= Social media can be used not only as public relations and direct marketing tools, but also as communication channels targeting very specific audiences with social media influencers and social media personalities as effective customer engagement tools. This tactic is widely known as influencer marketing. Influencer marketing allows brands the opportunity to reach their target audience in a more genuine, authentic way via a special group of selected influencers advertising their product or service. In fact, brands are set to spend up to $15 billion on influencer marketing by 2022, per Business Insider Intelligence estimates, based on Mediakix data. Technologies predating social media, such as broadcast TV and newspapers can also provide advertisers with a fairly targeted audience, given that an ad placed during a sports game broadcast or in the sports section of a newspaper is likely to be read by sports fans. However, social media websites can target niche markets even more precisely. Using digital tools such as Google Adsense, advertisers can target their ads to very specific demographics, such as people who are interested in social entrepreneurship, political activism associated with a particular political party, or video gaming. Google Adsense does this by looking for keywords in social media user's online posts and comments. It would be hard for a TV station or paper- based newspaper to provide ads that are this targeted (though not impossible, as can be seen with \\"special issue\\" sections on niche issues, which newspapers can use to sell targeted ads). Social networks are, in many cases, viewed as a great tool for avoiding costly market research. They are known for providing a short, fast, and direct way to reach an audience through a person who is widely known. For example, an athlete who gets endorsed by a sporting goods company also brings their support base of millions of people who are interested in what they do or how they play and now they want to be a part of this athlete through their endorsements with that particular company. At one point consumers would visit stores to view their products with famous athletes, but now you can view a famous athlete's, such as Cristiano Ronaldo, latest apparel online with the click of a button. He advertises them to you directly through his Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook accounts. Facebook and LinkedIn are leading social media platforms where users can hyper-target their ads. Hypertargeting not only uses public profile information but also information users submit but hide from others. There are several examples of firms initiating some form of online dialog with the public to foster relations with customers. According to Constantinides, Lorenzo and Gómez Borja (2008) \\"Business executives like Jonathan Swartz, President and CEO of Sun Microsystems, Steve Jobs CEO of Apple Computers, and McDonald's Vice President Bob Langert post regularly in their CEO blogs, encouraging customers to interact and freely express their feelings, ideas, suggestions, or remarks about their postings, the company or its products\\". Using customer influencers (for example popular bloggers) can be a very efficient and cost-effective method to launch new products or servicesGillin, P. (2007): The New Influencers, a Marketer's Guide to the new Social Media, Sanger, CA. Among the political leaders in office, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has the highest number of followers at 40 million, and President Donald Trump ranks second with 25 million followers. Modi employed social media platforms to circumvent traditional media channels to reach out to the young and urban population of India which is estimated to be 200 million. Engagement Engagement with the social web means that customers and stakeholders are active participants rather than passive viewers. An example of these are consumer advocacy groups and groups that criticize companies (e.g., lobby groups or advocacy organizations). Social media use in a business or political context allows all consumers/citizens to express and share an opinion about a company's products, services, business practices, or a government's actions. Each participating customer, non-customer, or citizen who is participating online via social media becomes a part of the marketing department (or a challenge to the marketing effort) as other customers read their positive or negative comments or reviews. Getting consumers, potential consumers or citizens to be engaged online is fundamental to successful social media marketing. With the advent of social media marketing, it has become increasingly important to gain customer interest in products and services. This can eventually be translated into buying behavior, or voting and donating behavior in a political context. New online marketing concepts of engagement and loyalty have emerged which aim to build customer participation and brand reputation. Engagement in social media for the purpose of a social media strategy is divided into two parts. The first is proactive, regular posting of new online content. This can be seen through digital photos, digital videos, text, and conversations. It is also represented through sharing of content and information from others via weblinks. The second part is reactive conversations with social media users responding to those who reach out to your social media profiles through commenting or messaging.Schaffer, Neal. Maximize Your Social : A One-Stop Guide to Building a Social Media Strategy for Marketing and Business Success. Somerset, NJ, USA: John Wiley & Sons, 2013. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 3 December 2014.

Traditional media such as TV news shows are limited to one-way interaction with customers or 'push and tell' where only specific information is given to the customer with few or limited mechanisms to obtain customer feedback. Traditional media such as physical newspapers, do give readers the option of sending a letter to the editor. Though, this is a relatively slow process, as the editorial board has to review the letter and decide if it is appropriate for publication. On the other hand, social media is participative and open; Participants are able to instantly share their views on brands, products, and services. Traditional media gave control of message to the marketer, whereas social media shifts the balance to the consumer or citizen. Campaigns =Local businesses= Small businesses also use social networking sites as a promotional technique. Businesses can follow individuals social networking site uses in the local area and advertise specials and deals. These can be exclusive and in the form of \\"get a free drink with a copy of this tweet\\". This type of message encourages other locals to follow the business on the sites in order to obtain the promotional deal. In the process, the business is getting seen and promoting itself (brand visibility). Small businesses also use social networking sites to develop their own market research on new products and services. By encouraging their customers to give feedback on new product ideas, businesses can gain valuable insights on whether a product may be accepted by their target market enough to merit full production, or not. In addition, customers will feel the company has engaged them in the process of co-creation—the process in which the business uses customer feedback to create or modify a product or service the filling a need of the target market. Such feedback can present in various forms, such as surveys, contests, polls, etc. Social networking sites such as LinkedIn, also provide an opportunity for small businesses to find candidates to fill staff positions. Of course, review sites, such as Yelp, also help small businesses to build their reputation beyond just brand visibility. Positive customer peer reviews help to influence new prospects to purchase goods and services more than company advertising. =Nike #MakeItCount= In early 2012, Nike introduced its Make It Count social media campaign. The campaign kickoff began YouTubers Casey Neistat and Max Joseph launching a YouTube video, where they traveled 34,000 miles to visit 16 cities in 13 countries. They promoted the #makeitcount hashtag, which millions of consumers shared via Twitter and Instagram by uploading photos and sending tweets. The #MakeItCount YouTube video went viral and Nike saw an 18% increase in profit in 2012, the year this product was released. Purposes and tactics One of the main purposes of employing social media in marketing is as a communications tool that makes the companies accessible to those interested in their product and makes them visible to those who have no knowledge of their products. These companies use social media to create buzz, and learn from and target customers. It's the only form of marketing that can finger consumers at each and every stage of the consumer decision journey. Marketing through social media has other benefits as well. Of the top 10 factors that correlate with a strong Google organic search, seven are social media dependent. This means that if brands are less or non-active on social media, they tend to show up less on Google searches. While platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Google+ have a larger number of monthly users, the visual media sharing based mobile platforms, however, garner a higher interaction rate in comparison and have registered the fastest growth and have changed the ways in which consumers engage with brand content. Instagram has an interaction rate of 1.46% with an average of 130 million users monthly as opposed to Twitter which has a .03% interaction rate with an average of 210 million monthly users. Unlike traditional media that are often cost- prohibitive to many companies, a social media strategy does not require astronomical budgeting. To this end, companies make use of platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram to reach audiences much wider than through the use of traditional print/TV/radio advertisements alone at a fraction of the cost, as most social networking sites can be used at little or no cost (however, some websites charge companies for premium services). This has changed the ways that companies approach to interact with customers, as a substantial percentage of consumer interactions are now being carried out over online platforms with much higher visibility. Customers can now post reviews of products and services, rate customer service, and ask questions or voice concerns directly to companies through social media platforms. According to Measuring Success, over 80% of consumers use the web to research products and services.Funk T. (2013) Measuring Success. In: Advanced Social Media Marketing. Apress, Berkeley, CA. Thus social media marketing is also used by businesses in order to build relationships of trust with consumers. To this aim, companies may also hire personnel to specifically handle these social media interactions, who usually report under the title of Online community managers. Handling these interactions in a satisfactory manner can result in an increase of consumer trust. To both this aim and to fix the public's perception of a company, 3 steps are taken in order to address consumer concerns, identifying the extent of the social chatter, engaging the influencers to help, and developing a proportional response. =Twitter= Twitter allows companies to promote their products in short messages known as tweets limited to 140 characters which appear on followers' Home timelines. Tweets can contain text, Hashtag, photo, video, Animated GIF, Emoji, or links to the product's website and other social media profiles, etc.\\"About Twitter\\", \\"Twitter\\", Retrieved on 27 June 2014. Twitter is also used by companies to provide customer service. Some companies make support available 24/7 and answer promptly, thus improving brand loyalty and appreciation. =Facebook= Facebook pages are far more detailed than Twitter accounts. They allow a product to provide videos, photos, longer descriptions, and testimonials where followers can comment on the product pages for others to see. Facebook can link back to the product's Twitter page, as well as send out event reminders. As of May 2015, 93% of businesses marketers use Facebook to promote their brand. A study from 2011 attributed 84% of \\"engagement\\" or clicks and likes that link back to Facebook advertising. By 2014, Facebook had restricted the content published from business and brand pages. Adjustments in Facebook algorithms have reduced the audience for non-paying business pages (that have at least 500,000 \\"Likes\\") from 16% in 2012 down to 2% in February 2014. =LinkedIn= LinkedIn, a professional business-related networking site, allows companies to create professional profiles for themselves as well as their business to network and meet others. Through the use of widgets, members can promote their various social networking activities, such as Twitter stream or blog entries of their product pages, onto their LinkedIn profile page. LinkedIn provides its members the opportunity to generate sales leads and business partners. Members can use \\"Company Pages\\" similar to Facebook pages to create an area that will allow business owners to promote their products or services and be able to interact with their customers. Due to spread of spam mail sent to job seeker, leading companies prefer to use LinkedIn for employee's recruitment instead of using a different job portal. Additionally, companies have voiced a preference for the amount of information that can be gleaned from a LinkedIn profile, versus a limited email.Caravella, Andrew. \\"Four Functions of Social Media Guide.\\" Retrieved 15 August 2013. =Whatsapp= WhatsApp was founded by Jan Koum and Brian Acton. Joining Facebook in 2014, WhatsApp continues to operate as a separate app with a laser focus on building a messaging service that works fast and reliably anywhere in the world. Started as an alternative to SMS, WhatsApp now supports sending and receiving a variety of media including text, photos, videos, documents, and location, as well as voice calls. WhatsApp messages and calls are secured with end-to-end encryption, meaning that no third party including WhatsApp can read or listen to them. WhatsApp has a customer base of 1 billion people in over 180 countries.https://www.whatsapp.com/about/ WhatsApp It is used to send personalised promotional messages to individual customers. It has plenty of advantages over SMS that includes ability to track how Message Broadcast Performs using blue tick option in WhatsApp. It allows sending messages to Do Not Disturb (DND) customers. WhatsApp is also used to send a series of bulk messages to their targeted customers using broadcast option. Companies started using this to a large extent because it is a cost-effective promotional option and quick to spread a message. As of 2019, WhatsApp still not allow businesses to place ads in their app. =Yelp= Yelp consists of a comprehensive online index of business profiles. Businesses are searchable by location, similar to Yellow Pages. The website is operational in seven different countries, including the United States and Canada. Business account holders are allowed to create, share, and edit business profiles. They may post information such as the business location, contact information, pictures, and service information. The website further allows individuals to write, post reviews about businesses, and rate them on a five-point scale. Messaging and talk features are further made available for general members of the website, serving to guide thoughts and opinions. =Instagram= In May 2014, Instagram had over 200 million users. The user engagement rate of Instagram was 15 times higher than of Facebook and 25 times higher than that of Twitter. According to Scott Galloway, the founder of L2 and a professor of marketing at New York University's Stern School of Business, latest studies estimate that 93% of prestige brands have an active presence on Instagram and include it in their marketing mix. When it comes to brands and businesses, Instagram's goal is to help companies to reach their respective audiences through captivating imagery in a rich, visual environment. Moreover, Instagram provides a platform where user and company can communicate publicly and directly, making itself an ideal platform for companies to connect with their current and potential customers. Many brands are now heavily using this mobile app to boost their marketing strategy. Instagram can be used to gain the necessary momentum needed to capture the attention of the market segment that has an interest in the product offering or services. As Instagram is supported by Apple and android system, it can be easily accessed by smartphone users. Moreover, it can be accessed by the Internet as well. Thus, the marketers see it as a potential platform to expand their brands exposure to the public, especially the younger target group. On top of this, marketers do not only use social media for traditional Internet advertising, but they also encourage users to create attention for a certain brand. This generally creates an opportunity for greater brand exposure. Furthermore, marketers are also using the platform to drive social shopping and inspire people to collect and share pictures of their favorite products. Many big names have already jumped on board: Starbucks, MTV, Nike, Marc Jacobs, and Red Bull are a few examples of multinationals that adopted the mobile photo app early. Fashion blogger Danielle Bernstein, who goes by @weworewhat on Instagram, collaborated with Harper's Bazaar to do a piece on how brands are using Instagram to market their products, and how bloggers make money from it. Bernstein, who currently has one and a half million followers on Instagram, and whose \\"outfit of the day\\" photos on Snapchat get tens of thousands of screenshots, explained that for a lot of her sponsored posts, she must feature the brand in a certain number of posts, and often cannot wear a competitor's product in the same picture. According to Harper's Bazaar, industry estimates say that brands are spending more than $1 billion per year on consumer-generated advertising. Founder of Instagram Kevin Systrom even went to Paris Fashion week, going to couture shows and meeting with designers to learn more about how style bloggers, editors, and designers are currently dominating much of the content on his application. Instagram has proven itself a powerful platform for marketers to reach their customers and prospects through sharing pictures and brief messages. According to a study by Simply Measured, 71% of the world's largest brands are now using Instagram as a marketing channel. For companies, Instagram can be used as a tool to connect and communicate with current and potential customers. The company can present a more personal picture of their brand, and by doing so the company conveys a better and true picture of itself. The idea of Instagram pictures lies on on-the-go, a sense that the event is happening right now, and that adds another layer to the personal and accurate picture of the company. In fact, Thomas Rankin, co-founder and CEO of the program Dash Hudson, stated that when he approves a blogger's Instagram post before it is posted on the behalf of a brand his company represents, his only negative feedback is if it looks too posed. \\"It's not an editorial photo,\\" he explained, \\"We're not trying to be a magazine. We're trying to create a moment.\\" Another option Instagram provides the opportunity for companies to reflect a true picture of the brand from the perspective of the customers, for instance, using the user-generated contents thought the hashtags encouragement. Other than the filters and hashtags functions, the Instagram's 15-second videos and the recently added ability to send private messages between users have opened new opportunities for brands to connect with customers in a new extent, further promoting effective marketing on Instagram. = Snapchat = Snapchat is a popular messaging and picture exchanging application that was created in 2011 by three students at Stanford University named Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown. The application was first developed to allow users to message back and forth and to also send photographs that are only available from 1–10 seconds until they are no longer available. The app was an instant hit with social media members and today there are up to 158 million people using snapchat every single day. It is also estimated that Snapchat users are opening the application approximately 18 times per day, which means users are on the app for about 25–30 minutes per day. =YouTube= YouTube is another popular avenue; advertisements are done in a way to suit the target audience. The type of language used in the commercials and the ideas used to promote the product reflect the audience's style and taste. Also, the ads on this platform are usually in sync with the content of the video requested, this is another advantage YouTube brings for advertisers. Certain ads are presented with certain videos since the content is relevant. Promotional opportunities such as sponsoring a video is also possible on YouTube, \\"for example, a user who searches for a YouTube video on dog training may be presented with a sponsored video from a dog toy company in results along with other videos.\\" YouTube also enable publishers to earn money through its YouTube Partner Program. Companies can pay YouTube for a special \\"channel\\" which promotes the companies products or services. =Social bookmarking sites= Websites such as Delicious, Digg, Slashdot, Diigo, Stumbleupon, and Reddit are popular social bookmarking sites used in social media promotion. Each of these sites is dedicated to the collection, curation, and organization of links to other websites that users deem to be of good quality. This process is \\"crowdsourced\\", allowing amateur social media network members to sort and prioritize links by relevance and general category. Due to the large user bases of these websites, any link from one of them to another, the smaller website may in a flash crowd, a sudden surge of interest in the target website. In addition to user-generated promotion, these sites also offer advertisements within individual user communities and categories.Lunden, Ingrid (2014-01-11) Ad 'Experiments' Come To Delicious As It Updates Social Bookmarking API With Authentication, Rate Limits. techcrunch.com Because ads can be placed in designated communities with a very specific target audience and demographic, they have far greater potential for traffic generation than ads selected simply through cookie and browser history.Aaron, Jesse (2014-06-18) \\"How to Integrate Reddit Into Your Next Digital Marketing Campaign\\". The Guardian Additionally, some of these websites have also implemented measures to make ads more relevant to users by allowing users to vote on which ones will be shown on pages they frequent.Parr, Benn (2009-08-06) \\"Digg Ads Are Here: Will Users Bury Them Into Oblivion?\\" mashable.com The ability to redirect large volumes of web traffic and target specific, relevant audiences makes social bookmarking sites a valuable asset for social media marketers. =Blogs= Platforms like LinkedIn create an environment for companies and clients to connect online. Companies that recognize the need for information, originality/ and accessibility employ blogs to make their products popular and unique/ and ultimately reach out to consumers who are privy to social media. Studies from 2009 show that consumers view coverage in the media or from bloggers as being more neutral and credible than print advertisements, which are not thought of as free or independent. Blogs allow a product or company to provide longer descriptions of products or services, can include testimonials and can link to and from other social network and blog pages. Blogs can be updated frequently and are promotional techniques for keeping customers, and also for acquiring followers and subscribers who can then be directed to social network pages. Online communities can enable a business to reach the clients of other businesses using the platform. To allow firms to measure their standing in the corporate world, sites enable employees to place evaluations of their companies. Some businesses opt out of integrating social media platforms into their traditional marketing regimen. There are also specific corporate standards that apply when interacting online. To maintain an advantage in a business- consumer relationship, businesses have to be aware of four key assets that consumers maintain: information, involvement, community, and control. =Tumblr= Blogging website Tumblr first launched ad products on May 29, 2012. Rather than relying on simple banner ads, Tumblr requires advertisers to create a Tumblr blog so the content of those blogs can be featured on the site. In one year, four native ad formats were created on web and mobile, and had more than 100 brands advertising on Tumblr with 500 cumulative sponsored posts. Ad formats * Sponsored mobile pPost – Advertisements (Advertisers' blog posts) will show up on user's Dashboard when the user is on a mobile device such as smartphones and tablets, allowing them to like, reblog, and share the sponsored post. * Sponsored web post – \\"Largest in- stream ad unit on the web\\" that catches the users' attention when looking at their Dashboard through their computer or laptop. It also allows the viewers to like, reblog, and share it. * Sponsored radar – Radar picks up exceptional posts from the whole Tumblr community based on their originality and creativity. It is placed on the right side next to the Dashboard, and it typically earns 120 million daily impressions. Sponsored radar allows advertisers to place their posts there to have an opportunity to earn new followers, reblogs, and likes. * Sponsored spotlight – Spotlight is a directory of some of the popular blogs throughout the community and a place where users can find new blogs to follow. Advertisers can choose one category out of fifty categories that they can have their blog listed on there. These posts can be one or more of the following: images, photo sets, animated GIFs, video, audio, and text posts. For the users to differentiate the promoted posts to the regular users' posts, the promoted posts have a dollar symbol on the corner. On May 6, 2014, Tumblr announced customization and theming on mobile apps for brands to advertise. Advertising campaigns * Disney/Pixar's Monsters University: Created a Tumblr account, MUGrumblr, saying that the account is maintained by a 'Monstropolis transplant' and 'self-diagnosed coffee addict' who is currently a sophomore at Monsters University. A \\"student\\" from Monsters University uploaded memes, animated GIFs, and Instagram-like photos that are related to the sequel movie. * Apple's iPhone 5c: Created a Tumblr page, labeling it \\"Every color has a story\\" with the website name: \\"ISee5c\\". As soon as you visit the website, the page is covered with different colors representing the iPhone 5c phone colors and case colors. When you click on one of the colored section, a 15-second video plays a song and \\"showcases the dots featured on the rear of the iPhone 5c official cases and on the iOS 7 dynamic wallpapers...\\", concluding with words that are related to the video's theme. Marketing techniques Social media marketing involves the use of social networks, consumer's online brand- related activities (COBRA) and electronic word of mouth (eWOM) to successfully advertise online. Social networks such as Facebook and Twitter provide advertisers with information about the likes and dislikes of their consumers. This technique is crucial, as it provides the businesses with a \\"target audience\\". With social networks, information relevant to the user's likes is available to businesses; who then advertise accordingly. Activities such as uploading a picture of your \\"new Converse sneakers to Facebook\\" is an example of a COBRA. Electronic recommendations and appraisals are a convenient manner to have a product promoted via \\"consumer-to-consumer interactions. An example of eWOM would be an online hotel review; the hotel company can have two possible outcomes based on their service. A good service would result in a positive review which gets the hotel free advertising via social media. However, a poor service will result in a negative consumer review which can potentially harm the company's reputation. Social networking sites such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, MySpace etc. have all influenced the buzz of word of mouth marketing. In 1999, Misner said that word-of mouth marketing is, \\"the world's most effective, yet least understood marketing strategy\\" (Trusov, Bucklin, & Pauwels, 2009, p. 3). Through the influence of opinion leaders, the increased online \\"buzz\\" of \\"word-of-mouth\\" marketing that a product, service or companies are experiencing is due to the rise in use of social media and smartphones. Businesses and marketers have noticed that, \\"a persons behaviour is influenced by many small groups\\" (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p. 189). These small groups rotate around social networking accounts that are run by influential people (opinion leaders or \\"thought leaders\\") who have followers of groups. The types of groups (followers) are called:Kotler, P., Burton, S., Deans, K., Brown, L., & Armstrong, G. (2013). marketing (9th ed.). NSW, Australia: Pearson Australia reference groups (people who know each other either face-to-face or have an indirect influence on a persons attitude or behaviour); membership groups (a person has a direct influence on a person's attitude or behaviour); and aspirational groups (groups which an individual wishes to belong to). = Influencer Marketing = Marketers target influential people, referred to as influencers, on social media who are recognized as being opinion leaders and opinion-formers to send messages to their target audiences and amplify the impact of their message. A social media post by an opinion leader can have a much greater impact (via the forwarding of the post or \\"liking\\" of the post) than a social media post by a regular user. Marketers have come to the understanding that \\"consumers are more prone to believe in other individuals\\" who they trust (Sepp, Liljander, & Gummerus, 2011). OL's and OF's can also send their own messages about products and services they choose (Fill, Hughes, & De Francesco, 2013, p. 216). The reason the opinion leader or formers have such a strong following base is because their opinion is valued or trusted (Clement, Proppe, & Rott, 2007). They can review products and services for their followings, which can be positive or negative towards the brand. OL's and OF's are people who have a social status and because of their personality, beliefs, values etc. have the potential to influence other people (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p. 189). They usually have a large number of followers otherwise known as their reference, membership or aspirational group (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong), 2013, p. 189\\\\. By having an OL or OF support a brands product by posting a photo, video or written recommendation on a blog, the following may be influenced and because they trust the OL/OF a high chance of the brand selling more products or creating a following base. Having an OL/OF helps spread word of mouth talk amongst reference groups and/or memberships groups e.g. family, friends, work-friends etc. (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p. 189).Fill, C., Hughes, G., & De Francesco, S. (2013). Advertising Strategy, creativity and media. London, UK: Pearson.Kotler, P., Burton, S., Deans, K., Brown, L., & Armstrong, G. (2013). marketing (9th ed.). NSW, Australia: Pearson Australia. The adjusted communication model shows the use of using opinion leaders and opinion formers. The sender/source gives the message to many, many OL's/OF's who pass the message on along with their personal opinion, the receiver (followers/groups) form their own opinion and send their personal message to their group (friends, family etc.) (Dahlen, Lange, & Smith, 2010, p. 39).Dahlen, M., Lange, F., & Smith, T. (2010). Marketing communications: A brand narrative approach. West Sussex, UK: John Wiley & Sons. = Organic Social Media = Owned social media channels are an essential extension of business' and brands in today's world. Brand must seek to create their brand image on each platform, and cater to the type of consumer demographics on each respective platform. In contrast with pre-Internet marketing, such as TV ads and newspaper ads, in which the marketer controlled all aspects of the ad, with social media, users are free to post comments right below an online ad or an online post by a company about its product. Companies are increasing using their social media strategy as part of their traditional marketing effort using magazines, newspapers, radio advertisements, television advertisements. Since in the 2010s, media consumers are often using multiple platforms at the same time (e.g., surfing the Internet on a tablet while watching a streaming TV show), marketing content needs to be consistent across all platforms, whether traditional or new media. Heath (2006) wrote about the extent of attention businesses should give to their social media sites. It is about finding a balance between frequently posting but not over posting. There is a lot more attention to be paid towards social media sites because people need updates to gain brand recognition. Therefore, a lot more content is need and this can often be unplanned content. Planned content begins with the creative/marketing team generating their ideas, once they have completed their ideas they send them off for approval. There is two general ways of doing so. The first is where each sector approves the plan one after another, editor, brand, followed by the legal team (Brito, 2013). Sectors may differ depending on the size and philosophy of the business. The second is where each sector is given 24 hours (or such designated time) to sign off or disapprove. If no action is given within the 24-hour period the original plan is implemented. Planned content is often noticeable to customers and is un-original or lacks excitement but is also a safer option to avoid unnecessary backlash from the public.Brito, M. (2013). How content governance will facilitate media company transformation. InYour brand (pp. 3-7). Retrieved from http://www.quepublishing.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2143149&seqNum;=3 Both routes for planned content are time consuming as in the above; the first way to approval takes 72 hours to be approved. Although the second route can be significantly shorter it also holds more risk particularly in the legal department. Unplanned content is an 'in the moment' idea, \\"a spontaneous, tactical reaction.\\" (Cramer, 2014, p. 6). The content could be trending and not have the time to take the planned content route. The unplanned content is posted sporadically and is not calendar/date/time arranged (Deshpande, 2014).Deshpande, P. (2014, August 24). The content marketing pyramid: Create more with less. Retrieved April 1, 2016, from http://contentmarketinginstitute.com Issues with unplanned content revolve around legal issues and whether the message being sent out represents the business/brand accordingly. If a company sends out a Tweet or Facebook message too hurriedly, the company may unintentionally use insensitive language or messaging that could alienate some consumers. For example, celebrity chef Paula Deen was criticized after she made a social media post commenting about HIV-AIDS and South Africa; her message was deemed to be offensive by many observers. The main difference between planned and unplanned is the time to approve the content. Unplanned content must still be approved by marketing managers, but in a much more rapid manner e.g. 1–2 hours or less. Sectors may miss errors because of being hurried. When using unplanned content Brito (2013) says, \\"be prepared to be reactive and respond to issues when they arise.\\" Brito (2013) writes about having a, \\"crisis escalation plan\\", because, \\"It will happen\\". The plan involves breaking down the issue into topics and classifying the issue into groups. Colour coding the potential risk \\"identify and flag potential risks\\" also helps to organise an issue. The problem can then be handled by the correct team and dissolved more effectively rather than any person at hand trying to solve the situation. Implications on traditional advertising =Minimizing use= Traditional advertising techniques include print and television advertising. The Internet has already overtaken television as the largest advertising market.Internet overtakes television to become biggest advertising sector in the UK. The Guardian (2009-09-30) Web sites often include the banner or pop-up ads. Social networking sites don't always have ads. In exchange, products have entire pages and are able to interact with users. Television commercials often end with a spokesperson asking viewers to check out the product website for more information. While briefly popular, print ads included QR codes on them. These QR codes can be scanned by cell phones and computers, sending viewers to the product website. Advertising is beginning to move viewers from the traditional outlets to the electronic ones. While traditional media, like newspapers and television advertising, are largely overshadowed by the rise of social media marketing, there is still a place for traditional marketing. For example, with newspapers, readership over the years has shown a decline. However, readership with newspapers is still fiercely loyal to print-only media. 51% of newspaper readers only read the newspaper in its print form, making well-placed ads valuable. =Leaks= The Internet and social networking leaks are one of the issues facing traditional advertising. Video and print ads are often leaked to the world via the Internet earlier than they are scheduled to premiere. Social networking sites allow those leaks to go viral, and be seen by many users more quickly. The time difference is also a problem facing traditional advertisers. When social events occur and are broadcast on television, there is often a time delay between airings on the east coast and west coast of the United States. Social networking sites have become a hub of comment and interaction concerning the event. This allows individuals watching the event on the west coast (time-delayed) to know the outcome before it airs. The 2011 Grammy Awards highlighted this problem. Viewers on the west coast learned who won different awards based on comments made on social networking sites by individuals watching live on the east coast. Since viewers knew who won already, many tuned out and ratings were lower. All the advertisement and promotion put into the event was lost because viewers didn't have a reason to watch. =Mishaps= Social media marketing provides organizations with a way to connect with their customers. However, organizations must protect their information as well as closely watch comments and concerns on the social media they use. A flash poll done on 1225 IT executives from 33 countries revealed that social media mishaps caused organizations a combined $4.3 million in damages in 2010. The top three social media incidents an organization faced during the previous year included employees sharing too much information in public forums, loss or exposure of confidential information, and increased exposure to litigation. Due to the viral nature of the Internet, a mistake by a single employee has in some cases shown to result in devastating consequences for organizations. An example of a social media mishap includes designer Kenneth Cole's Twitter mishap in 2011. When Kenneth Cole tweeted, \\"Millions are in uproar in #Cairo. Rumor has they heard our new spring collection is now available online at [Kenneth Cole's website]\\".Twitter account dedicated to poke fun at Kenneth Cole for #Cairo tweet. Ibtimes.com (2011-02-04). Retrieved on 2013-01-11. This reference to the 2011 Egyptian revolution drew an objection from the public; it was widely objected to on the Internet. Kenneth Cole realized his mistake shortly after and responded with a statement apologizing for the tweet.Kenneth Cole's Twitter Fail – PRNewser. Mediabistro.com (2011-02-03). Retrieved on 2013-01-11. In 2012 during Hurricane Sandy, Gap sent out a tweet to its followers telling them to stay safe but encouraged them to shop online and offered free shipping. The tweet was deemed insensitive, and Gap eventually took it down and apologized.Wasserman, T. (2012-10-31). Gap Criticized For Insensitive Tweet During Hurricane Sandy. mashable.com Numerous additional online marketing mishap examples exist. Examples include a YouTube video of a Domino's Pizza employee violating health code standards, which went viral on the Internet and later resulted in felony charges against two employees. A Twitter hashtag posted by McDonald's in 2012 attracting attention due to numerous complaints and negative events customers experienced at the chain store; and a 2011 tweet posted by a Chrysler Group employee that no one in Detroit knows how to drive.High price to be paid for controversial social-media mishaps San Francisco Chronicle March 17, 2011, retrieved April 4, 2012 When the Link REIT opened a Facebook page to recommend old-style restaurants, the page was flooded by furious comments criticizing the REIT for having forced a lot of restaurants and stores to shut down; it had to terminate its campaign early amid further deterioration of its corporate image.領匯「尋味」腰斬 如何拆網絡炸彈 (The Link terminates its search for \\"old tastes\\": How to improve online corporate image, Hong Kong Economic Times April 20, 2012, retrieved April 25, 2012 In 2018, Max Factor, MAC and other beauty brands were forced to rush to disassociate themselves from Kuwaiti beauty blogger and Instagram 'influencer' Sondos Alqattan after she criticised government moves to improve conditions for domestic workers. =Ethics= The code of ethics that is affiliated with traditional marketing can also be applied to social media. However, with social media being so personal and international, there is another list of complications and challenges that come along with being ethical online. A sensitive topic about social media professionals is the subject of ethics in social media marketing practices, specifically: the proper uses of, often, very personal data. With the invention of social media, the marketer no longer has to focus solely on the basic demographics and psychographics given from television and magazines, but now they can see what consumers like to hear from advertisers, how they engage online, and what their needs and wants are. The general concept of being ethical while marking on social network sites is to be honest with the intentions of the campaign, avoid false advertising, be aware of user privacy conditions (which means not using consumers' private information for gain), respect the dignity of persons in the shared online community, and claim responsibility for any mistakes or mishaps that are results of your marketing campaign. Most social network marketers use websites like Facebook and MySpace to try to drive traffic to another website. While it is ethical to use social networking websites to spread a message to people who are genuinely interested, many people game the system with auto-friend adding programs and spam messages and bulletins. Social networking websites are becoming wise to these practices, however, and are effectively weeding out and banning offenders. In addition, social media platforms have become extremely aware of their users and collect information about their viewers to connect with them in various ways. Social-networking website Facebook Inc. is quietly working on a new advertising system that would let marketers target users with ads based on the massive amounts of information people reveal on the site about themselves. This may be an unethical or ethical feature to some individuals. Some people may react negatively because they believe it is an invasion of privacy. On the other hand, some individuals may enjoy this feature because their social network recognizes their interests and sends them particular advertisements pertaining to those interests. Consumers like to network with people who share their interests and desires. Individuals who agree to have their social media profile public, should be aware that advertisers have the ability to take information that interests them to be able to send them information and advertisements to boost their sales. Managers invest in social media to foster relationships and interact with customers. This is an ethical way for managers to send messages about their advertisements and products to their consumers. Since social media marketing first came into being, strategists and marketers have been getting smarter and more careful with the way they collect information and distributing advertisements. With the presence of data collecting companies, there is no longer a need to target specific audiences. This can be seen as a large ethically gray area. For many users, this is a breach of privacy, but there are no laws that prevent these companies from using the information provided on their websites. Companies like Equifax, Inc., TransUnion Corp, and LexisNexis Group thrive on collecting and sharing personal information of social media users. In 2012, Facebook purchased information from 70 million households from a third party company called Datalogix. Facebook later revealed that they purchased the information in order to create a more efficient advertising service. Facebook had an estimated 144.27 million views in 2016, approximately 12.9 million per month. Despite this high volume of traffic, very little has been done to protect the millions of users who log on to Facebook and other social media platforms each month. President Barack Obama tried to work with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to attempt to regulate data mining. He proposed the Privacy Bill of Rights, which would protect the average user from having their private information downloaded and shared with third party companies. The proposed laws would give the consumer more control over what information companies can collect. President Obama was unable to pass most of these laws through congress, and it is unsure what President Trump will do with regards to social media marketing ethics. Metrics =Web site reports= This involves tracking the volume of visits, leads, and customers to a website from the individual social channel. Google Analytics is a free tool that shows the behavior and other information, such as demographics and device type used, of website visitors from social networks. This and other commercial offers can aid marketers in choosing the most effective social networks and social media marketing activities. =Return on investment data= The end goal of any marketing effort is to generate sales. Although social media is a useful marketing tool, it is often difficult to quantify to what extent it is contributing to profit. ROI can be measured by comparing marketing analytic value to contact database or CRM and connect marketing efforts directly to sales activity. =Customer response rates= Several customers are turning towards social media to express their appreciation or frustration with brands, product or services. Therefore, marketers can measure the frequency of which customers are discussing their brand and judge how effective their SMM strategies are. In recent studies, 72% of people surveyed expressed that they expected a response to their complaints on Twitter within an hour. Social media marketing in sport There has been an increase in social media marketing in sport, as sports teams and clubs recognise the importance of keeping a rapport with their fans and other audiences through social media. Sports personalities such as Cristiano Ronaldo have 40.7 million followers on Twitter and 49.6 million on Instagram, creating opportunities for endorsements.

The second movement is a theme with five variations in E major, Schubert's only set of symphonic variations.

The second variation passes the theme between the low strings and the woodwinds. The third variation is again violins and winds. The fourth variation is in C minor and features some acceleration with the use of triplet-sixteenth notes. The fifth variation maintains the triplet-sixteenths, but they move into the background with the melody returning close to its original form as a kind of recapitulation. A coda concludes the movement. The minuet is in C minor and mainly scored for the tutti and fortissimo. The contrasting Trio in E major is more thinly scored winds, violins and pizzicato bass. The melody of the trio is actually a variation of the theme used in the second movement, forming a melodic and harmonic (E major/C minor) link between the inner two movements.

In his verdict, the judge, Lord Ellenborough decided that in cases where an individual was bound to do a duty under an existing contract, that duty could not be considered valid consideration for a new contract. It has been distinguished from Williams v Roffey Bros & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd,[1989] EWCA Civ 5 which suggested that situations formerly handled by consideration could instead be handled by the doctrine of economic duress. Facts Stilk was contracted to work on a ship owned by Myrick for £5 a month, promising to do anything needed in the voyage regardless of emergencies.Poole (2004) p. 124 After the ship docked at Cronstadt two men deserted, and after failing to find replacements the captain promised the crew the wages of those two men divided between them if they fulfilled the duties of the missing crewmen as well as their own. After arriving at their home port the captain refused to pay the crew the money he had promised to them. The defence, represented by Garrow, argued that the agreement between the captain and the sailors or seamen > was contrary to public policy, and utterly void. In West India voyages, > crews are often thinned greatly by death and desertion; and if a promise of > advanced wages were valid, exorbitant claims would be set up on all such > occasions. This ground was strongly taken by Lord Kenyon in Harris v Watson, > Peak. Cas. 72, where that learned Judge held, that no action would lie at > the suit of a sailor on a promise of a captain to pay him extra wages, in > consideration of his doing more than the ordinary share of duty in > navigating the ship; and his Lordship said, that if such a promise could be > enforced, sailors would in many cases suffer a ship to sink unless the > captain would accede to any extravagant demand they might think proper to > make. The lawyers for the plaintiff attempted to distinguish this case from Harris v Watson by pointing out that the circumstances were completely different, and that the captain had offered the extra money without any pressure being brought to bear by the crewmen. Judgment Lord Ellenborough's judgment read: Significance Modern commentators say that the decision by the judge not to award the money to the plaintiffs was based at least partly on public policy; should he have done so it would have created precedent that would risk crew members blackmailing captains into giving them more money. It is accepted that the decision would likely be different if it was made in modern times, because of the doctrine of economic duress it would be difficult for such blackmail to be enforced in court.Poole (2004) p.125 In Hartley v Ponsonby[1857] 7 E&B; 872 it was held that where a remaining crew were required to do something extra, beyond the scope of their contracts (which unlike in Stilk did not require performance in all emergencies) that the promise of extra pay could be enforced.McKendrick (2007) p.97 Another exception to the rule that performing a pre-existing contractual duty is not valid consideration for a new agreement was created in Williams v Roffey Bros & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd [1991] 1 QB 1 which decided that in such situations the court will be quick to find consideration, if \\"practical benefits\\" are given from one to another party.McKendrick (2007) p.99 The practical benefit doctrine has recently been extended to a lease agreement which involved the payer of a lesser sum in MWB v Rock Advertising [2016] EWCA Civ 553 which has led to considerable criticism.

It is a compilation of highly divergent material, arranged in a time running from the \\"time before time\\" to the aftermath of the Apocalypse. Metamorphosis constitutes a dominant theme: against a background of cosmic transformation take place many sorts of changes in shape and content. Importance The first half of the 15th century had been crucial in the development of the Turkish language. This makes the Dürr-i Meknûn, with its volume and its varied subject matter, an important source for early Ottoman culture and language. The book was deliberately written by Bican for the common people in the vernacular Turkish and he strongly advocated against the widespread use among the learned elite of Arabic and Persian.

Founded in 1901 as a state-sanctioned distillery, Kristall is the largest liquor and vodka enterprise in Russia, and is best known internationally as the birthplace of the Stolichnaya vodka brand. History In 1896, by decree of the Minister of Finance of the Russian Empire, Sergei Yulevich Vitte, a state monopoly on the production and sale of alcoholic beverages was introduced. On June 24, 1901, Moscow State Wine Warehouse No. 1 was founded as a state-sanctioned vodka and wine distillery in Moscow, located on the banks of the Yauza River in the east of the city. The distillery employed 1,500 people and was planned to produce 600,000 state vodka buckets per year, however, only a week after opening plans were made to expand production due to unexpectedly high demand, and instead produced 2,100,000 (approximately 2.6 million decalitres) in its first year of operation. At the beginning, production was divided among three quality divisions, from lowest to highest quality: \\"simple\\", \\"improved\\", and \\"boyarskaya\\". From October 31, 1914, due to Russia's participation in the First World War, the distillery's production was cut down and was closed to the civilian market because of a dry law, while production continued for the military, foreign market, and medical applications. A military hospital was situated for some time in the unused areas of the distillery building. Due to the collapse of the Russian Empire and the rise of the Bolsheviks to power, it was not until 1923 that pre-war production was restored at the distillery as a state-owned enterprise of the Soviet Union. By January 1, 1924, the distillery had produced 844,720 litres of vodka. During the Second World War, in addition to vodka production, the distillery also produced \\"Molotov cocktail\\" weapons for the Soviet war effort. The distillery was severely damaged by a German bomb on July 22, 1941, igniting flammable products in the building, but despite the heavy damage production continued. For contributions during the war, the distillery was awarded the Banner of the State Defense Committee. In 1945, Workshop No. 1 was opened as a branch to produce the highest quality beverages for the Soviet political elite, with each bottle that left the workshop featuring a certificate with the list of lastnames and personal signatures of the experts responsible for the product. In 1953, the now-famous vodka brand Stolichnaya was released on to the market, having been introduced at an international trade show in Bern, Switzerland, where it received a gold medal in a blind taste test over the more well known Russian vodka brand Smirnoff. The Soviet Union began to mass-produce bottles of Stolichnaya in the Ukrainian SSR for international export. Stolichnaya is believed to have been created in 1944 at the Moscow distillery by an expert distiller, V.G. Svirida, but never sold or produced in large quantities. In January 1987, the distillery received its current name, Moscow Distillery Crystal. In 1993, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the distillery became a private joint-stock company and the Moscow Distillery Kristall name trade mark were registered. In 2003, Kristall introduced the new vodka brand Putinka.

It will fire repeatedly until the trigger is released or ammunition runs out. Automatic shotguns have a very limited range, but provide tremendous firepower at close range.  Design  Automatic shotguns generally employ mechanisms very similar to other kinds of automatic weapons. There are several methods of operation, with the most common being gas, recoil, and blowback operated: * Gas operation uses the pressure of the gas (created by the burning propellant) behind the projectile to unlock the bolt assembly and then move it rearward. * Recoil operation uses the backward force applied by the projectile (due to Newton's Third Law of Motion) to retract the bolt assembly. * Blowback operation uses the backward force to retract the entire barrel and bolt assembly, which unlock at the rear of the barrel's path. Each of these methods use springs to return the retracted parts to their forward positions and restart the cycle. Many automatic shotguns are capable of selective fire, meaning they can fire in multiple modes (semi-automatic, burst, and sometimes fully automatic).  Ammunition  They generally store ammunition in detachable box or drum magazines in order to decrease reloading time, whereas most pump-action and semi-automatic shotguns use under-barrel tubular magazines. Shotguns are able to handle a wide variety of ammunition, however automatics are slightly limited because the shot must provide sufficient force to reliably cycle the action. This means that they are not compatible with low powered rounds, like most less-than-lethal ammunition. The most common ammunition used in combat shotguns is 00 buckshot, which fires about 9 metal balls and is very effective against unarmored targets.  Strengths and weaknesses  A standard shotgun shot fires multiple small projectiles at once, increasing the chances of hitting the target. Shotguns have a short effective range of about , but provide a lot of firepower at close range. Automatic fire enhances these effects, due to the increase in the rate of fire. Automatics typically have much shorter barrels than pump-action shotguns (especially hunting shotguns). Barrel length contributes to tighter shot spread, so automatics have relatively wide spread. Short-barreled automatic shotguns have a very high chance of hitting close range targets, and can even hit multiple targets in one area, which is ideal for combat situations. Long-barreled pump action shotguns are more accurate and have increased range, which is ideal for hunting and sporting purposes. Automatic shotguns are generally viewed as less reliable than manual operation shotguns, because there are more moving parts and increased chances of error. If any one piece fails, it will most likely halt the operation and cause damage to the weapon and/or user. Automatic weapons are also more susceptible to jamming and negative effects from dirtiness.  Use  Automatic shotguns are intended for use as military combat shotguns. They typically have a high rate of fire and relatively low recoil, making them ideal for engaging targets in a fast-paced, close range combat situation. They are able to fulfill many different combat roles due to the wide variety of shotgun ammunition available. Automatic shotguns have not seen much use in the United States, but have been slightly more popular in some other countries.

The members of the family are sometimes known as frog-biting midges. The family currently consists of just one genus, totalling 115 extant and 10 fossil species worldwide. Most extant species are found in the lower latitudes, usually associated around the tropics. They are tiny flies with a wing length of 0.6-2.5 mm. The wing venation is similar to Culicidae (R 4 branched, M 2 branched, Cu 2 branched) with branches of Rs and M nearly parallel. R1 is, however, closer to Sc or almost midway between Sc and R2. They were, from 1962 until 1989, placed as a tribe Corethrellini within the Chaoborinae, a subfamily of Culicidae. Adult female Corethrella are attracted to the mating calls of male frogs, their chosen host taxa. As obligate external parasites, the midges feed almost exclusively on the blood of these frogs. Because of this, Corethrella follow typical distribution patterns of external parasites and are restricted to only areas with abundant populations of their host frogs. Female midges most likely detect their hosts using a specialized organ called a Johnston's organ, a collection of sensory cells found on the second antenna segment. There is evidence of host specificity and selection of particular biting sites for some species. Corethrella species have been observed sucking blood from individuals of the tree frog genus Hyla. Specifically, the North American tree frog species Hyla avivoca, Hyla cinerea and Hyla gratiosa were recorded as confirmed corethrellid hosts in a 1977 study. A few, select species are known vectors of frog-specific species of the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma. Corethrellid parasitism is thus a recorded cause of trypanosomiasis among host frog populations. The family contains members that date to the lower Cretaceous Period some 110 million years ago. At least one species, Corethrella andersoni, has been found in Burmese amber deposits dating from this time.

Accessed January 21, 2009. by American composer John Williams for the January 20, 2009, inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the United States. The first public performance of the piece was in Washington, D.C., immediately prior to Obama taking the oath of office, when musicians Anthony McGill (clarinet), Itzhak Perlman (violin), Yo-Yo Ma (cello) and Gabriela Montero (piano) synced their performance to a tape they had recorded two days earlier. It was the first classical quartet to be performed at a presidential inauguration. Obama officially became the President while the piece was being performed, at noon, as the United States Constitution stipulates. Although it appeared that the piece was being performed live, it was in fact mimed while a recording made two days before was fed to the television pool and speakers. Yo-Yo Ma told NPR's All Things Considered that the piano keys had been decoupled from the hammers, and the bows of the stringed instruments had been soaped to silence them. The performers stated that the cold weather could have affected the tuning and durability of the instruments, making a live performance too risky. Williams based the piece on the familiar 19th century Shaker hymn \\"Simple Gifts\\" by Joseph Brackett. The source piece is famous for its appearance in Aaron Copland's ballet Appalachian Spring. Williams chose the selection from Copland, one of Obama's favorite classical composers. The piece is slightly under 4.5 minutes. It is structured in roughly three parts. The first section presents the \\"Air\\" material, consisting of a spare, descending modal melody introduced by violin, pensively explored in duet with cello and piano accompaniment. The entrance of the clarinet, playing the \\"Simple Gifts\\" theme, signals the beginning of a small set of variations on that melody. The \\"Air\\" melody at first intermingles with the \\"Gifts\\" theme, though it is supplanted by increasingly energetic variations. Midway through, the key shifts from A major to D major, in which the piece concludes. A short coda reprising the \\"Air\\" material follows the most vigorous of the \\"Gifts\\" variations. The piece concludes with an unusual series of cadences, ending with chord progression D-major followed by B-major, G-minor and finally D-major.

Development Messerschmitt M 23s had won the Circuit of Europe or Challenge International de Tourisme in both 1929 and 1930, assisting sales of the aircraft. The M.29 was designed to repeat this success. It was a low-wing cantilever monoplane of slightly smaller span than the M.23, with an enclosed continuous cockpit for two in tandem which blended smoothly into a dorsal fairing that extended aft to the fin. The latter carried a wide chord rudder and an all-moving tailplane, mounted on bracing towards the top of the fin. It had a clean cantilever spatted undercarriage. The wings could be folded at wing root hinges, back along the fuselage sides. The aircraft could be powered either by a closely cowled 112 kW (150 hp) Siemens-Halske Sh 14a seven-cylinder radial engine (M.29a) or an air-cooled inverted inline Argus As 8R (a high-powered racing version of the Argus As 8) of the same power (M.29b). Operational history Four aircraft of both variants were delivered for testing a few days before the start of racing on 27 August 1932. Initial reactions were that the machine was both fast and responsive. However, within days one aircraft had disintegrated in mid-air, killing the pilot and another was lost in the same way on approach to landing. The pilot in the second accident, Reinhold Poss bailed out, though his observer was killed, and reported that the disintegration began at the tailplane, progressing forward. All M.29s were grounded, missing the race, whilst the tail structure was strengthened. The remaining race machines, joined by at least one more, flew successfully after modification.

Presentations at the conference cover recent advances in the structure, function and applications of gums and stabilisers, how these materials are used in industrial processes, and also educational material on the subject. The proceedings of each conference have been published (see below), with the most recent (9th through 16th conferences) published by the Royal Society of Chemistry. The conference series is organized by the Food Hydrocolloids Trust. History of the conference The intention of the conference series is to provide a forum for the free exchange of ideas between academia and industry and to promote the use and understanding of hydrocolloids in foods. Because hydrocolloids are sourced and used in all of the continents except Antarctica, and many types (such as resins, seed gums, and certain alginates) are obtained from specific countries or climate zones, the conference attracts an international attendance from Europe, Asia, North America, Australia, Africa and the Middle East. The first conference series was held at Glyndŵr University in Wrexham in 1981, chaired by Professor Glyn O Phillips (also of Glyndŵr University), and all subsequent conferences have taken place at the same location and with the same chairman. Th eonly exception to this was the 2011 conference, held in Wageningen in the Netherlands. Until 2008, Glyndŵr University was known as the North-East Wales Institute of Higher Education (NEWI). * Gums and Stabilisers for the Food Industry : Date of conference: July 1981 : Editors: G. O.

Successively lumpable processes  In 2012, Katehakis and Smit discovered the Successively Lumpable processes for which the stationary probabilities can be obtained by successively computing the stationary probabilities of a propitiously constructed sequence of Markov chains. Each of the latter chains has a (typically much) smaller state space and this yields significant computational improvements.

In August 1982, Mexican Secretary of Finance Jesús Silva Herzog Flores flew to Washington, D.C., to declare Mexico's foreign debt unmanageable, and announce that his country was in danger of defaulting. This crisis had long lasting impact over the entire Latin American countries which is also known as \\"Latin American debt crisis\\". The United States and other neighboring developed countries such as, Canada came up with the assistance plane for Mexico with the co-ordination of financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund, World Bank etc. During this period major economic reforms were undertaken, with liberalisation and privatisation replacing the earlier model of state led growth. As a fallout of neo-liberal economic policies, foreign investors started investing heavily and over $90 billion flowed into the country during 1990-93. But within a short span of time this plan failed totally and Mexico failed one more time to get itself out of this crisis.Kavaljit Sing(1999) \\"The Globalisation Of Finance:A Citizen's Guide\\"; Zed Books ltd, London & New York,  See also  *Latin American debt crisis *Brady Bonds  References  History of government debt Financial crises Economic history of Mexico 1982 in Mexico ","title":"Mexican Weekend"},{"id":"21180003","text":"The Ource () is a long river in northeastern France, a right tributary of the river Seine.

Formal definition  Let (X,\\\\mathcal A) and (Y,\\\\mathcal B) be measurable spaces. A Markov kernel with source (X,\\\\mathcal A) and target (Y,\\\\mathcal B) is a map \\\\kappa : \\\\mathcal B \\\\times X \\\\to [0,1] with the following properties: # For every (fixed) B \\\\in \\\\mathcal B, the map x \\\\mapsto \\\\kappa(B, x) is \\\\mathcal A-measurable # For every (fixed) x \\\\in X, the map B \\\\mapsto \\\\kappa(B, x) is a probability measure on (Y, \\\\mathcal B) In other words it associates to each point x \\\\in X a probability measure \\\\kappa(dyx): B \\\\mapsto \\\\kappa(B, x) on (Y,\\\\mathcal B) such that, for every measurable set B\\\\in\\\\mathcal B, the map x\\\\mapsto \\\\kappa(B, x) is measurable with respect to the \\\\sigma-algebra \\\\mathcal A..  Examples  =Simple random walk on the integers = Take X=Y=\\\\Z, and \\\\mathcal A = \\\\mathcal B = \\\\mathcal P(\\\\Z) (the power set of \\\\Z). Then a Markov kernel is fully determined by the probability it assigns to a singleton set \\\\\\\\{m\\\\\\\\} with m \\\\in Y = \\\\Z for each n \\\\in X = \\\\Z: :\\\\kappa(Bn )=\\\\sum_{m \\\\in B}\\\\kappa(\\\\\\\\{m\\\\\\\\}n), \\\\qquad \\\\forall n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}, \\\\, \\\\forall B \\\\in \\\\mathcal B. Now the random walk \\\\kappa that goes to the right with probability p and to the left with probability 1 - p is defined by :\\\\kappa(\\\\\\\\{m\\\\\\\\}n)= p \\\\delta_{m, n + 1}+ (1-p) \\\\delta_{m, n - 1}, \\\\quad \\\\forall n,m \\\\in \\\\Z where \\\\delta is the Kronecker delta. The transition probabilities P(mn) = \\\\kappa(\\\\\\\\{m\\\\\\\\}n) for the random walk are equivalent to the Markov kernel. =General Markov processes with countable state space= More generally take X and Y both countable and \\\\mathcal A = \\\\mathcal P(X),\\\\ \\\\mathcal B = \\\\mathcal P(Y). Again a Markov kernel is defined by the probability it assigns to singleton sets for each i \\\\in X :\\\\kappa(Bi)=\\\\sum_{j \\\\in B}\\\\kappa(\\\\\\\\{j\\\\\\\\}i), \\\\qquad \\\\forall i \\\\in X, \\\\, \\\\forall B \\\\in \\\\mathcal B, We define a Markov process by defining a transition probability P(ji) = K_{ji} where the numbers K_{ji} define a (countable) stochastic matrix (K_{ji}) i.e. :\\\\begin{align} K_{ji} &\\\\ge 0, \\\\qquad &\\\\forall (j,i) \\\\in Y\\\\times X, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sum_{j \\\\in Y}K_{ji}&=1, \\\\qquad &\\\\forall i \\\\in X.\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} We then define : \\\\kappa(\\\\\\\\{j\\\\\\\\} i) = K_{ji} = P(ji), \\\\qquad \\\\forall i \\\\in X, \\\\quad \\\\forall B \\\\in \\\\mathcal B. Again the transition probability, the stochastic matrix and the Markov kernel are equivalent reformulations. =Markov kernel defined by a kernel function and a measure = Let u be a measure on (Y, \\\\mathcal B), and k: Y \\\\times X\\\\to [0, \\\\infty] a measurable function with respect to the product \\\\sigma-algebra \\\\mathcal A \\\\otimes \\\\mathcal B such that : \\\\int_Y k(y, x) u(\\\\mathrm{d} y) = 1, \\\\qquad \\\\forall x \\\\in X , then \\\\kappa(dy x) = k(y, x) u(dy) i.e. the mapping :\\\\begin{cases} \\\\kappa:\\\\mathcal B \\\\times X \\\\to [0,1] \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\kappa(Bx)=\\\\int_{B}k(y, x) u(\\\\mathrm{d} y) \\\\end{cases} defines a Markov kernel.. This example generalises the countable Markov process example where u was the counting measure. Moreover it encompasses other important examples such as the convolution kernels, in particular the Markov kernels defined by the heat equation. The latter example includes the Gaussian kernel on X = Y = \\\\mathbb R with u(dx) = dx standard Lebesgue measure and :k_t(y, x) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}t}e^{-(y - x)^2/(2t^2)}. = Measurable functions = Take (X, \\\\mathcal{A}) and (Y, \\\\mathcal{B}) arbitrary measurable spaces, and let f:X \\\\to Y be a measurable function. Now define \\\\kappa(dyx) = \\\\delta_{f(x)}(dy) i.e. : \\\\kappa(Bx) = \\\\mathbf{1}_B(f(x)) = \\\\mathbf{1}_{f^{-1}(B)}(x) = \\\\begin{cases}1 & \\\\text{if } f(x) \\\\in B\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{otherwise}\\\\end{cases} for all B \\\\in \\\\mathcal{B}. Note that the indicator function \\\\mathbf{1}_{f^{-1}(B)} is \\\\mathcal{A}-measurable for all B \\\\in \\\\mathcal{B} iff f is measurable. This example allows us to think of a Markov kernel as a generalised function with a (in general) random rather than certain value. =Galton–Watson process= As a less obvious example, take X = \\\\N, \\\\mathcal A = \\\\mathcal P(\\\\N), and (Y, \\\\mathcal B) the real numbers \\\\R with the standard sigma algebra of Borel sets. Then :\\\\kappa(Bn)=\\\\begin{cases} \\\\mathbf{1}_B(0) & n=0\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Pr(\\\\xi_1 + \\\\cdots + \\\\xi_x \\\\in B) & n eq 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{cases} with i.i.d. random variables \\\\xi_i (usually with mean 0) and where \\\\mathbf{1}_B is the indicator function. For the simple case of coin flips this models the different levels of a Galton board.  Composition of Markov Kernels and the Markov Category Given measurable spaces (X, \\\\mathcal A), (Y, \\\\mathcal B) and (Z, \\\\mathcal C), and probability kernels \\\\kappa: X \\\\to Y and \\\\lambda: Y \\\\to Z, we can define a composition \\\\lambda \\\\circ \\\\kappa : X \\\\to Z by :(\\\\lambda \\\\circ \\\\kappa) (dzx) = \\\\int_Y \\\\lambda(dz y)\\\\kappa(dyx) The composition is associative by Tonelli's theorem and the identity function considered as a Markov kernel (i.e. the delta measure \\\\kappa_{1}(dx'x) = \\\\delta_x(dx') is the unit for this composition. This composition defines the structure of a category on the measurable spaces with Markov kernels as morphisms first defined by Lawvere. The category has the empty set as initial object and the one point set * as the terminal object.  Probability Space defined by Probability Distribution and a Markov Kernel A probability measure on a measurable space (X, \\\\mathcal A) is the same thing as a morphism * \\\\to X in the Markov category also denoted by P. By composition, a probability space (X, \\\\mathcal A, P_X) and a probability kernel \\\\kappa: (X, \\\\mathcal A) \\\\to (Y, \\\\mathcal B) defines a probability space (Y, \\\\mathcal B, P_Y = \\\\kappa \\\\circ P_X). It is concretely defined by : P_Y(B) = \\\\int_X \\\\int_B \\\\kappa(dyx) P_X(dx) = \\\\int_X \\\\kappa(Bx)P_X(dx) = \\\\mathbb{E}_{P_X}\\\\kappa(B\\\\cdot)  Properties  = Semidirect product = Let (X, \\\\mathcal A, P) be a probability space and \\\\kappa a Markov kernel from (X, \\\\mathcal A) to some (Y, \\\\mathcal B). Then there exists a unique measure Q on (X \\\\times Y, \\\\mathcal A \\\\otimes \\\\mathcal B), such that: : Q(A \\\\times B) = \\\\int_A \\\\kappa(Bx)\\\\,P(dx), \\\\quad \\\\forall A \\\\in \\\\mathcal A, \\\\quad \\\\forall B \\\\in\\\\mathcal B. = Regular conditional distribution = Let (S,Y) be a Borel space, X a (S,Y)-valued random variable on the measure space (\\\\Omega, \\\\mathcal{F}, P) and \\\\mathcal G \\\\subseteq \\\\mathcal F a sub-\\\\sigma-algebra. Then there exists a Markov kernel \\\\kappa from (\\\\Omega, \\\\mathcal G) to (S,Y), such that \\\\kappa(\\\\cdot,B) is a version of the conditional expectation \\\\mathbb{E}[\\\\mathbf 1_{\\\\\\\\{X \\\\in B\\\\\\\\}} \\\\mid \\\\mathcal G] for every B \\\\in Y, i.e. :P(X \\\\in B\\\\mid\\\\mathcal G)=\\\\mathbb{E} \\\\left [\\\\mathbf 1_{\\\\\\\\{X \\\\in B\\\\\\\\}}\\\\mid\\\\mathcal G \\\\right ] = \\\\kappa(\\\\omega,B), \\\\qquad P\\\\text{-a.s.}\\\\,\\\\, \\\\forall B \\\\in \\\\mathcal G. It is called regular conditional distribution of X given \\\\mathcal G and is not uniquely defined.  Generalizations  Transition kernels generalize Markov kernels in the sense that for all x \\\\in X, the map : B \\\\mapsto \\\\kappa(Bx) can be any type of (non negative) measure, not necessarily a probability measure.

Judgment Lord Campbell CJ decided that although Stilk v Myrick [1809] EWHC KB J58 said that sailors were not entitled to additional pay for fulfilling a duty already required by an existing contract, they were in this case.

The series began with Valkyria Chronicles, which was released for the PlayStation 3 in 2008, and later for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and the Nintendo Switch. Two sequels have been released on the PlayStation Portable, with the latest installment, Valkyria Chronicles 4, released for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and Microsoft Windows. The series has also been expanded into anime and manga media. Settings, gameplay, and characters The main line of games uses a turn based system known as the BLiTZ (Battle of Live Tactical Zones), while the later installment is described as being real time with strategy elements. The setting for these games take place in alternate versions of the Earth, during war times of the 20th century. Welkin Gunther is the main protagonist of the first game, Valkyria Chronicles. Selvaria Bles is a character that has appeared in every single installment, with the exception of Valkyria Revolution. Games Valkyria Chronicles debuted on PlayStation 3, with the original game later made available on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch. Sega opted to continue the series on PlayStation Portable instead of on PlayStation 3. However, Valkyria Chronicles 4 was released on the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Microsoft Windows and Nintendo Switch, it was the first Valkyria Chronicles game to debut on a Nintendo platform and Microsoft Windows in the West. =Main series= Valkyria Chronicles The first main entry in the series was originally released for the PlayStation 3 and later ported to Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4. The Windows port was developed by Little Stone Software. It takes place in Europa, a fictional continent based on Europe, during the beginning of World War II. Because of its abundance of Ragnite ore, which takes the place of petroleum in the game setting, the neutral nation of Gallia comes under attack from the East Europan Imperial Alliance, which is itself engaged in a war with the Atlantic Federation. Players take control of a unit of the Gallian Militia, dedicated to repelling the invasion. The game's visuals, which use Sega's CANVAS graphics engine, resemble pencil drawn paintings in motion. Valkyria Chronicles II The second main entry was moved to the PlayStation Portable platform. Story-wise, it takes place two years after the events of the first game, with a fight that breaks loose against the Gallian Revolutionary Army and the Regular Army in a bid to remove Cordelia from the throne. The game's story focuses on a military academy as its cadets seek to prevent an ethnic cleansing campaign by a ruthless rebel group. Valkyria Chronicles III The third main entry was also released on the PlayStation Portable. However, it takes place during the events of the first game. The story follows the \\"Nameless\\", a penal military unit serving the nation of Gallia during the Second Europan War who perform secret black operations and are pitted against the Imperial unit \\"Calamity Raven\\". Unlike the previous installments, it did not have an official release outside of Japan. Valkyria Chronicles 4 The fourth main entry was released on the PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch in 2018.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGL5EzrHm_U While taking place during the events of the first and third game, Valkyria Chronicles 4 focuses not on the Gallian forces but those of the Atlantic Federation, the other major superpower during the events of the war, that enacts a bold plan to strike at the Imperial Capital. =Spinoffs= Valkyria Chronicles D Valkyria Chronicles D is a mobile game released only in Japan. It was a free browser- based/iOS game, with radically different gameplay, focusing more on character management of war troops similar to sports team management simulations.http://kotaku.com/5957474/check-out-the-other-valkyria-chronicles- game-thats-never-left-japan It was released on July 26, 2012 and shut down on April 22, 2015.https://www.destructoid.com/sega-shuts-down-valkyria- chronicles-mobile-game-288268.phtml Valkyria Revolution Valkyria Revolution (known in Japan as Valkyria: Azure Revolution) was released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita on January 19, 2017 in Japan. It is considered a spin-off, with a storyline separate from the main series, taking place in the fictional country of Jutland. It was released in North America and Europe on June 27, 2017 and June 30, 2017 respectively for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita and Xbox One, making it the first series game to be on a Microsoft console, alongside the PlayStation versions.http://kotaku.com/valkyria-revolution-is-coming-west-1790092968 Other media =Valkyria Chronicles= Manga Three manga adaptations have been published based on the first game. The first is Valkyria Chronicles: Wish Your Smile, serialized by Enterbrain's Comics B's Log magazine and centering on two characters made for the manga: Mintz, an orphan and engineer, and Julius Klose, a sniper, with both of them in the Gallian army's militia force. It was written by Sega and illustrated by Kyusei Tokito, and was serialized from November 12, 2008 to January 22, 2010 with two compilation volumes released on May 1, 2009 and March 1, 2010. The second manga, titled Valkyria Chronicles: Gallian Chronicles, was written by Sega and illustrated by En Kito. Similar to the anime, it is a loose adaptation of the original video game, with some story details diverging from the source material. It was serialized by Kadokawa Shoten from November 26, 2008 to March 26, 2010 in Comp Ace magazine and later compiled in four volumes. The third manga is Valkyria Chronicles: Anthology Comic, written by Sega and published by the Bros Comics EX comic label. on December 28, 2009 in one volume. Anime The anime adaptation of the first game premiered on April 4, 2009 and was produced by Aniplex's A-1 Pictures. The series was directed by Yasutaka Yamamoto and written by Michiko Yokote under the Project Valkyria Group. Valkyria Chronicles was aired on Animax, Tokyo MX, MBS, CBC, Chiba TV, Television Kanagawa, Television Hokkaido, BS11, and TVQ Kyushu Broadcasting. Generally following the storyline of the original game, the anime version differs from its source in terms of characterization of main players such as Alicia, and introduces a character unique to the anime, Ramal Valt. While retaining elements of the CANVAS Engine's look, the characters were redesigned for the anime by Atsuko Watanabe. The original score for the anime is composed and conducted by the game's composer Hitoshi Sakimoto and performed by the Czech Film Orchestra. The first opening theme song, \\"Asu e no Kizuna\\" was performed by Animax Anison Grand Prix winner Catherine St. Onge, under her chosen moniker of Himeka. A CD single of the song was released on May 27, 2009. The first ending theme, was sung by the band Pe'zmoku with a CD single released on May 27, 2009 in a regular and special edition. Maria performed the series's second opening theme, , which was used from the 14th episode on. The second ending song, , was sung by Hikari Inoue beginning from Episode 14 until Episode 25. Episode 26's ending song was \\"Brightest Morning\\", also performed by Hikari Inoue. CD singles for \\"Kanashimi Rensa\\" and \\"Hitotsu no Negai\\" were released on August 12, 2009 and August 5, 2009. Region 2 DVDs of all 26 episodes were released across nine volumes, beginning on August 5, 2009, and concluding on April 7, 2010. Drama CD Two Valkyria Chronicles Drama CDs have been released. The first was released on July 24, 2009, and the second was released on October 7, 2009. =Valkyria Chronicles II= Three manga adaptations of the second game were released by Sega in Japan. The first one released was , drawn by Daisuke Shido and serialised in Dengeki Maoh from June 2010 to 2011, in which the story follows the developing friendship between the Valkyrian Aliasse, and her Darcsen classmate Magari. The first volume was published in January 2011 and the second volume was published on May 27, 2011. The next manga is called Valkyria Chronicles 2 (戦場のヴァルキュリア2, Senjō no Varukyuria 2). The story was written by Daiki Saito and the artwork was done by Watari. It was serialised in Comp Ace from October 2010 to September 2011, and its storyline is loosely based on the game, with emphasis on the relationship between Avan and his brother. The first volume was published on January 26, 2011 and the second volume was published in September 2011. Another manga, named Valkyria Chronicles 2 –our only days- (戦場のヴァルキュリア2 -our only days-, Senjō no Varukyuria 2 -our only days-), was illustrated by Mekki Kuroyama and was serialised as a webcomic by comic B's-LOG. The story is focused on Zeri and his changing relationships with his schoolmates over the course of the events of the game. The first volume was published on January 31, 2011 and the second volume in September 2011. Japanese band Chemistry performed the theme song of the game, \\"Our Story\\". It was released as part of their album \\"Regeneration\\" on February 24, 2010. =Valkyria Chronicles III= Anime Valkyria Chronicles III was adapted into a two-episode original video animation series in the same year of its release. Titled , it was originally released through PlayStation Network and Qriocity between April and May 2011. The initially-planned release and availability period needed to be extended due to a stoppage to PSN during the early summer of that year. It later released for DVD on June 29 and August 31, 2011, with separate \\"Black\\" and \\"Blue\\" editions being available for purchase. The anime is set during the latter half of Valkyria Chronicles III, detailing a mission by the Nameless against their Imperial rivals Calamity Raven. The anime was first announced in November 2010. It was developed by A-1 Pictures, produced by Shinji Motoyama, directed by Nobuhiro Kondō, and written by Hiroshi Ōnogi. Sakimoto's music for the game was used in the anime. The anime's title was inspired by the principal purpose of the Nameless: to suffer in battle for the goals of others. A subtitle attached to the project during development was \\"The Road to Kubinka\\", which referenced the Kubinka Tank Museum in Moscow. The game's main theme was how the characters regained their sense of self when stripped of their names and identities, along with general themes focused on war and its consequences. While making the anime, the production team were told by Sega to make it as realistic as possible, with the consequence that the team did extensive research into aspects such as what happened when vehicles like tanks were overturned or damaged. Due to it being along the same timeline as the original game and its anime television adaptation, the cast of Valkyria Chronicles could make appearances, which pleased the team. The opening theme, , was sung by Japanese singer Faylan. The ending theme, , was sung by Minami Kuribayashi. Both songs' lyrics were written by their respective artists. Manga Two manga adaptations were produced, following each of the game's main female protagonists, Imca and Riela. They were , illustrated by Naoyuki Fujisawa and eventually released in two volumes after being serialized in Dengeki Maoh between 2011 and 2012; and , illustrated by Mizuki Tsuge and eventually released in a single volume by Kadokawa Shoten in 2012. Reception The Valkyria series has had a generally positive reception. Valkyria Chronicles won numerous awards, including Strategy Game of the Year from GameSpy. By 2015, Valkyria Chronicles sold over 500,000 copies on Steam, exceeding expectations, and over 141,589 copies on the PlayStation 3. The second game was the second best-selling video game in Japan during its release week, selling 94,000 copies. The third game sold approximately 100,000 units during its premier week, faring better than its predecessors. During its initial March 2018 release on PS4, the fourth game sold 76,778 physical copies within its first three weeks in Japan. After its release on the Switch in September 2018, the game sold 5,596 physical copies within its first week in Japan.

It was formed in 1826 when the moribund Bullo Pill Railway and a connected private railway failed, and they were purchased by the new company. At this stage it was a horse-drawn plateway, charging a toll for private hauliers to use it with horse traction. The traffic was chiefly minerals from the Forest of Dean, in the Whimsey and Churchway areas, near modern-day Cinderford, for onward conveyance from Bullo Pill at first, and later by the Great Western Railway. When the South Wales Railway was proposed in 1844, the FODR was awarded £15,000 to modernise its line and make a broad gauge edge railway in connection; the FODR was slow to implement this and in 1849 the South Wales Railway purchased the FODR outright, making it a branch of its own network. The line was steeply graded and difficult to work, and it was often congested due to heavy traffic. In 1907 passenger traffic was instituted using railmotors, a low-cost means of carrying light passenger traffic, and for some time this was very successful. Trains ran from Whimsey, later extended northward to Drybridge on a contiguous line built by the GWR. Newnham was the main line junction station, although some branch trains ran through to Gloucester. As motor bus services became dominant, the passenger services became unprofitable and they were withdrawn in 1958. The network was closed completely in 1967 as mineral traffic ceased. First proposals for a tramroad The Forest of Dean Coalfield had long been a source of mineral working, for iron ore and coal. Free Miners had statutory rights in the Forest, which protected them from external competition. However this limited the extent to which large scale operations could be undertaken. A number of short tramways were built in the Forest, but the road network was extremely difficult and transportation of mineral products to market was expensive and uncompetitive. Timber in the Forest was used for the construction of ships for the Royal Navy, and Crown Commissioners protected the forestry in a way that also impeded industrialisation of the mining. The first railways—in fact plateways—in the Forest of Dean were designed to connect the rivers Severn and Wye, and it was not until 1806 that a serious proposal came forward to take minerals down the eastern area, southward along the Cinderford valley. That idea failed to progress, but the promoters together took land leases and announced that they would build a railway despite the setback. Work began on the line northward from Bullo Pill; no Parliamentary authority was needed as the land had been acquired. The Bullo Pill Railway Company The Forest of Dean Railway network in 1908 Towards the end of 1808 a further bill was prepared to authorise a public railway or tramroad from the summit of the hill above Churchway Engine (north-west of present-day Cinderford) to Cinderford Bridge. This became the Bullo Pill Railway, which was incorporated on 10 June 1809.Or 5 May 1809, Carter. There were several short branches serving mineral workings. On 20 September 1809 a press report announced \\"the tunnel is completed through Hay-Hill to the Forest of Dean, which is connected with the River Severn, and a channel thus established, by which the valuable productions of the Forest may be brought to market with a feasibility hitherto unknown.\\" The Haie tunnel, at 1,100 yards in length, was one of the earliest to be driven for a railway. The Bullo Pill Railway was probably completed soon afterwards. The track was of the L-plate form in which plain wagons wheels could run, guided by the upstand of the L. There are uncertainties about the gauge, but four feet measured between the outer faces of the vertical flanges, is generally assumed. The Whimsey branch was built about 1823, and Whimsey later became an important focal point for private tramroads running northwards. The Forest of Dean Railway takes control By 1826 the Bullo Pill Railway was almost at a standstill and Edward Protheroe, a prominent coal-owner in the Parkend area and chairman of the S&WR;, purchased the whole concern, including the Great Bilson colliery, selling the railway to a new company he formed, the Forest of Dean Railway Company, of which he was the chairman. An Act was obtained on 5 May 1826 authorising the new company to purchase and maintain both the Bullo Pill Railway and the private line, and to make the latter public. The eighteen subscribers included Edward and three other Protheroes, and the capital was £125,000 in £50 shares. The maximum tolls were maintained over the BPR section, and tolls were laid down for the private section. The line was in a poor state when the FODR company was formed in 1826, and it was probably then that a chaired form of track was introduced. The chairs weighed 11 lb; they had two bosses fitted into holes in the sleeper blocks, and a dovetail form seat, into which the plate was keyed with an iron wedge. These plates were still 3 feet long, and weighed about 50 lb. In April 1833 the mild winter was blamed for a reduced demand for house coal which led to a low dividend of 13s per share. In July 1835 the shares (nominally £50) were quoted at £27, but a dividend of 13s per share was again paid. Four months later the figures were £28 and 15s respectively. By October 1837 trade was improving, and 19s per share was paid for the half year. In April 1838 a fall in trade produced a 17s dividend, but in the following year the directors noted with satisfaction how the Dean Forest (Mines) Act 1838 had stimulated mining and trading activity in the district, and in 1839 and 1840 the dividend was up to about 5%. In October 1834 William Allaway asked the board for permission to use a locomotive on the tramroad. He enquired as to \\"the weight that six wheels would be allowed to carry\\", and he probably had in mind the six-coupled engines then being used on the Sirhowy Railway. He was told that the tramroad was not constructed for such engines, and that no \\"plans or proportions\\" had been submitted which would indicate what alterations might be necessary. Proposed duplication of the route By 1836 the lack of a double line, and stoppages at the tunnel, were causing frequent complaints. A sub- committee was appointed and reported in October 1837 that growth in traffic would soon necessitate new provision, in particular for coastwise trade to the west. They suggested a railway from Cinderford Bridge to a new harbour at Brimspill, or Purton, and it was agreed that the chairman should write to Robert Stephenson, asking him to send a surveyor to prepare plans, \\"on the understanding that the chief superintendence of the undertaking will be entrusted to him, Mr Stephenson\\". His report was read to the board on 12 April 1838. He stated that Brimspill was the natural outlet for that portion of the Forest. The new branch was to be 5 miles 68 chains long, and he estimated that the cost, including locomotives, other power and a stock of wagons, would be £40,000. The Crown authorities had approved the line, and it was hoped that iron, iron ore, and coal would be exported from the new harbour, while Bullo harbour would be retained for the existing trade. Stephenson's bill for the survey was £267 8s. A Bill was introduced into Parliament for the new line from Cinderford Bridge, passing through two tunnels, and touching the village of Blakeney on the way to Brimspill. However the Bill was thrown out for failing to comply with standing orders; some buildings had been omitted from the plans and there was a discrepancy in the datum levels. The chairman, Protheroe, immediately wrote to Stephenson, but he was abroad and George Parker Bidder replied. Bidder could only plead the difficulty of complying with the new and complicated standing orders, and dismissed a 12 feet inaccuracy in a level as \\"purely clerical ... not significant\\". The company decided to re-apply for an Act, but the idea was overtaken by the idea of main line railways in the area. The South Wales Railway The South Wales Railway was proposed in 1844, encouraged by the Great Western Railway; it was to run from Standish, south-east of Gloucester, to South Wales. There would have been a bridge across the Severn at Fretherne. However it was argued by opponents that this would impede shipping intending to reach Bullo Pill, and to avoid the opposition the promoters of the South Wales Railway agreed to purchase the Forest of Dean Railway for £30,000 and improve it, providing a new branch line to the Severn at Brimspill. In the event, for unconnected reasons the South Wales Railway Act of 1845 authorised only the section westward from Chepstow, and the crossing of the Severn was omitted. Nevertheless, the South Wales Railway proprietors confirmed on 31 October 1845 the agreement for conditional purchase of the Forest of Dean Railway, the chairman stating that the cost would be £101,000. The South Wales Railway introduced another Bill in 1847, seeking powers to convert the Forest of Dean Railway line to a broad gauge railway, but this was opposed by the Severn and Wye Railway on the grounds that the different gauge would prevent the interchange of traffic at Churchway. Daniel Gooch, for the SWR, agreed that they could preserve the tramroad down to Findall Mine level, near the tunnel, to meet S&WR; objections to a break of gauge at Churchway. The South Wales Railway Act was passed on 2 July 1847, and the SWR was authorised to rent or purchase the FODR and to divert, widen and improve it, constructing a locomotive railway. The branch to Bullo Pill was to pass under the South Wales line, permitting direct traffic to the docks, with a spur to the main line. Acquisition of the Forest of Dean Railway Isambard Kingdom Brunel, as engineer of the South Wales Railway, was not satisfied with the proposed conversion because of the steep gradients involved and the uncertainty as to whether the line might continue to be worked by horses. The South Wales Railway had priorities elsewhere, and the purchase and conversion by them was left in abeyance. The FODR meanwhile, with the promise of their concern being purchased, suspended any expenditure on maintenance or repairs. This enabled the FODR to enhance its profits: in 1848 the FODR paid a dividend of 8%, but in September 1849 Brunel reported an interview with local traders, who \\"feared the trade would be seriously inconvenienced if not actually stopped, unless arrangements were made to keep the line in repair\\". The South Wales Railway board then authorised its solicitors to guarantee the average cost of one month's repair of the FODR. The following month it was reported that a bill had been filed by the FODR to enforce performance of the agreement, and the South Wales Railway thereupon requested Brunel to negotiate some arrangement with the FODR. On 7 November 1849 the South Wales Railway agreed to purchase the FODR for £90,000, to be paid on 27 January 1853. The South Wales Railway was considered to be in possession from 27 July 1849. The South Wales Railway New Works Act was dated 3 July 1851, and it authorised the construction of a single-line broad-gauge locomotive railway from Churchway Engine and Whimsey to the main line (using parts of the tramroad), and a new wharves branch at Bullo; this was in substitution for the 1847 Act. The South Wales Railway opened its line from near Gloucester to a temporary station at Chepstow East on 19 September 1851. Brunel reported on 25 February 1852 that the contract for the enlargement of the FODR tunnel and the construction of another through Blakeney Hill, was to be let during the month. The final meeting of the FODR Company took place in London on Friday 10 September 1852. In February 1853 the conversion work was going ahead, but the enlargement of the tunnel was proving difficult, especially as the heavy winter coal traffic on the line had to be maintained during the work. By February 1854 the operation of enlarging the old tunnel had been completed. The railway to Churchway and Whimsey, with the dock branch, was opened for coal traffic on Monday 24 July 1854, as a broad gauge branch of the South Wales Railway. The work had cost £120,000; the line was 7 miles 20 chains long, and the Bullo dock branch was 53 chains long. For some time to come Whimsey was regarded as the centre of the traffic activity on the line; Cinderford as a community had not yet developed significantly. Operation as a broad gauge railway The broad-gauge railway was primarily intended to take the products of the Forest out of the district, but there was a large traffic between the works (principally iron-ore from the Parkend district, and coal from Wimberry, to the eastern furnaces) and several of the pits had only tramroad connections. The S&WR; board agreed on 26 May 1854 to keep the tramroad open from the junction with the Lightmoor branch to Churchway and Whimsey \\"for the present\\", and the east–west traffic continued on the tramroad throughout until an interchange wharf was put in at Churchway. There loaded tram wagons were placed on broad-gauge flat wagons by turntable, for onward transit to Cinderford ironworks. The steep gradients and the large number of sidings made operation of the former FODR network unusually difficult. The ruling gradient on the main stem was 1 in 48 near Upper Soudley, and 1 in 41 on the Churchway branch. A former station master at Bullo Pill recounted the operations: The single engine stationed at the junction did all the branch work and shunting and, north of Bilson, its duties included taking three empty wagons to Nelson colliery and collecting three laden ones, fetching wire from Churchway (whence it had been brought by tramroad from Lydbrook works), and carrying Edge Hill iron-ore from Whimsey (for Dowlais works). Coal traffic, averaging 40 wagons daily, was generally taken down to Bullo sidings in the afternoon, and on to Swindon next morning by two trains. Some 30 trucks of pig-iron, from Cinderford and Soudley, were brought down in the morning. No brake vans were used, and the three guards in charge of the trains rode on the tops of the wagons. The opening of Trafalgar, Foxes Bridge, East Slade and Stapledge collieries led to a down-going traffic of nearly 100 wagons. The account recalls an instance when, a train of 99 wagons having been made up at Bilson, the yard was vainly searched for one more, and the guard had to leave with only ‘99 on’, to his great disappointment. This gross overloading led to an event in the autumn of 1863, when a train of 70 wagons broke in two near Shakemantle. On discovering the shortage, the driver stopped below Shakemantle siding, whereupon the 30 truant wagons ran into the train, creating a confusion of wreckage which took five days to clear. It also led to the limiting of trains to 45 wagons and the employment of a third locomotive, so that four trains a day could be worked down. Traffic continued to increase, and on most days a wire had to be sent to Gloucester for two special engines to clear Bullo yard. Occasionally, a train would take wagons to Grange Court, the guard riding on the last truck carrying a red flag and a supply of detonators. Later, broad-gauge trains were despatched in the evening to Salisbury via Swindon, avoiding the wait through the night at Bullo.Reminiscences of Mr Dowding of Bullo Pill Junction, in the Dean Forest Mercury 19 November 1897, reprinted in Paar and also in Pope and Karau. In 1867 traffic was worked by train staff and ticket, on weekdays only (always the practice), with a guard to every 15 wagons. Four locomotives were based at Bullo Pill and were respectively referred to as the Bullo Yard engine (which worked the docks branch), the Branch engine (which worked up to Bilson), the Forest engine (which worked north of Bilson, and returned to Bullo with the last train), and the spare engine. Public goods stations were originally provided at Ruspidge and Whimsey, the former being called \\"Cinderford\\", from the settlement around Cinderford Bridge. A GWR circular of 26 November 1884 stated \\"It has been arranged to open the new goods station for Cinderford, which is situated at the Whimsey sidings on the Forest of Dean branch, on the 1st December and to call it 'Cinderford' instead of Whimsey. On and from the same date the present Cinderford station will be called 'Ruspidge'.\\" A public goods station was opened at Bilson in August 1862. In 1867 the Forest engine worked three trips for coal from Churchway and one ore trip from Whimsey, to Bilson. The branch engine worked seven trips down to Bullo Pill Jen, one a pick-up goods; there was also a short working down to Quidchurch to fetch ore back to Bilson, and a late trip if required leaving Bilson at 6.0 p.m. There were balancing workings, including two pick-ups which called at the various sidings as required; the journey time for a through train down from Bilson was usually 20 minutes (25 in the opposite direction), while the pick-ups were allowed one hour in each direction. E Fletcher, the local traffic superintendent, stated in 1869 that about 1,500 tons passed down the branch daily, beginning early in the morning, but work ceased early in the afternoon \\"for want of sufficient traffic\\". He also mentioned that some of the collieries served—Churchway, Quidchurch, Spero, Bilson, Prospect, Winnings, Cinderford Bridge, Woodside and Paragon—had ceased work after the broad gauge line had been completed. Conversion to standard gauge The Great Western Railway, as successor to the South Wales Railway from 1863, converted the gauge of the South Wales Railway line during the weekend of 11 and 12 May 1872. The former FODR line was converted at the same time. On 15 September 1873 the triangular junction with the S&WR; at Bilson Junction was opened for traffic. Brain's Tramway crossed both S&WR; and GWR lines at the same point and the GWR erected a disc-and-crossbar signal which became famous as the last survivor of its type. Operation in 1895 In 1895, the FODR main line was worked by train staff and ticket, supplemented by telegraph, in two sections, Bullo to Ruspidge and Ruspidge to Bilson. Due to the steep gradient, up trains were limited to 40 loaded wagons by day, 30 by night, reduced in bad weather, and had to stop at Ruspidge for pinning down of wagon brakes. They had to be drawn down the bank at not more than 10 mph, and no train of more than 20 wagons (or 25 with two engines) was to leave Ruspidge for Bullo unless the line was signalled clear all the way through, which could not be done within 25 minutes of any up passenger train being due on the main line. The Churchway branch was worked by the Bilson shunting engine, as was the Whimsey branch, which at that time extended to Speedwell siding. In the 1895 regulations, it was explained that at the level crossing with the Lightmoor colliery line, signals were provided for both lines, but the signalman had no communication along the line, and the crossing signals were not interlocked. \\"Mr Crawshay’s Engine Driver\\" was to maintain only such a speed as will enable him to pull up with certainty clear of the crossing, and every instance of his failing to do this must be reported by the signalman. Whimsey When the broad gauge railway was completed and opened in 1854, Whimsey was one of the two northernmost points, the other being Churchway. The line terminated alongside Whimsey Colliery; however, this appears to have closed soon afterwards and it seems that most of the railway traffic originating here in the early days came from elsewhere. The original FODR tramroad from Bullo Pill had also terminated at Whimsey until it was extended by private tramroads to Nailbridge in 1834, and to Westbury Brook Iron Mine in 1842. A northward extension from Whimsey to Speedwell siding was opened for mineral traffic in July 1885. Cinderford The Severn and Wye Railway only reached a Cinderford station that was some distance from the settlement itself, and for many years this was a source of complaint. On 2 July 1900 an extension was at last made to a new Cinderford station, but no connection was made with the FODR line until 6 April 1908, when a 31-chain loop was brought into use, from Bilson Junction to Cinderford Junction; the disparity of levels was such that the connection rose towards Cinderford at 1 in 51. The GWR had asked for the junction in July 1907, offering to contribute to the cost of the station, and its expenses, in the ratio that GWR trains bore to the total number using it, two GWR \\"motor-car\\" units to be equivalent to one conventional S&WR; train.The GWR had a half share of the Severn and Wye Company at that time; the other partner was the Midland Railway. The S&WR; network kept separate accounts and the toll charge was therefore necessary. The loop was authorised by the Great Western Railway (General Powers) Act of 16 August 1909, and was used for many years by passenger trains only. The Cinderford station was constructed on a lavish scale, and experience showed that its running cost was more than the income from the station supported. As early as May 1927 the station signal box at Cinderford (S&WR;) was taken out of use, and in 1929 the S&WR; passenger trains were withdrawn. A limited S&WR; goods service continued until 25 July 1949, and the track was severed in 1951. In 1958, the FODR auto-trains were discontinued, and the station was closed to local parcels traffic as from 1 November 1962, although it remained in use for goods traffic. The opening of Northern United colliery in 1935 produced new instructions for working the Churchway section. Loaded trains were limited to 40 ten-ton wagons or equivalent (soon amended to 35) throughout down to Bullo, while upgoing empties were limited to 23 as far as Bilson, and 15 on the Churchway branch. They were to be propelled up to the colliery from Bilson, with a brake van leading, the open end at the head, and the guard warning anyone on the line by means of a horn. Passenger traffic The Bullo Pill Railway and its successor, the Forest of Dean Railway, were never seriously planned for passenger operation, although the possibility had been mentioned more than once. By 1904 motor bus services in country districts began to be a real cause of competition for the railway. The GWR was seeking methods of catering economically for light passenger traffic, using steam railcars. These consisted of a passenger coach into which was built a four-wheeled steam locomotive, duplicate driving controls being provided at the opposite end from the locomotive. The very limited power of the small traction unit was always an issue, and on the steeply graded Forest of Dean Railway section it proved impracticable. Instead higher capacity units known as auto-trains, consisting of a tank locomotive coupled to one or two coaches were used. The coach remote from the locomotive had driving controls and a mechanical linkage enabled the driver to operate the locomotive regulator. Some configurations marshalled an intermediate trailer between the driving trailer and the locomotive, and in the extreme this could be done both ends of the locomotive, giving four passenger coaches. On 1 November 1906, £14,956 was authorised for the \\"adaption of mineral lines in the Forest of Dean for passenger traffic\\". Work proceeded quickly with the construction of halts at Bullo Cross, Upper Soudley, Staple Edge, Bilson, Whimsey and Steam Mills. The service was instituted on 3 August 1907, from Newnham to Steam Mills Crossing, with the intention of extending it to Drybrook, and to Cinderford (S&WJR;). Five services were operated on weekdays, taking 29 minutes down to Newnham and 30 minutes on return. A short run was made from Bilson to Steam Mills and back early in the morning, and on Saturday there was a late evening service from Newnham to Whimsey. Halts were provided at Ruddle Road (on the main line), Bullo Cross, Upper Soudley, Staple Edge, Ruspidge, Bilson (Cinderford), Whimsey, and Steam Mills, and in the first six weeks’ working 20,824 passengers were conveyed, including 3,319 on August Bank Holiday. The patronage was far beyond the expectation of the promoters. On 4 November 1907 the service was extended to Drybrook halt via Nailbridge halt, the basic service being six journeys each way, with extra short runs from Bilson to Drybrook, and Drybrook to Whimsey. On 6 April 1908 the Cinderford Loop was opened and the trains were extended to Cinderford station, from where they reversed back to Bilson Junction signal box before completing their journey. In November the platforms at Bullo Cross, Upper Soudley, Staple Edge, Nailbridge and Drybrook were raised from 1 ft 2 in. to 3 ft in height. Workmen's cars were introduced on 4 January 1909 to convey colliers between Drybrook and Whimsey and Bilson halts, but notices dated July 1909 and subsequently make no reference to the Bilson halt which had, in fact, been closed from 6 April 1908. In June 1910, five hundred men from Lightmoor Colliery travelled to Blackpool (via Grange Court, Hereford, Crewe, Manchester and Wigan). Bilson was re-opened from 2 April 1917 and closed again from 1 October 1920, but unadvertised use was made of it in later years and it appeared in official timetable alterations in March 1930. It was finally removed in 1944. Ruddle Road halt, although on the main line a little south of Newnham, was served only by the branch trains. It was closed on 29 April 1917, due to disappointing patronage. On 28 September 1910 the Board of Trade belatedly authorised the use of the branch for passenger traffic by means of \\"motor cars\\", also for excursion trains run between Cinderford and the main line, provided these did not call at the halts. By 1913 certain trains were running to and from Gloucester, and one had been extended to Grange Court, a pattern which was continued throughout the service, with Newnham bay platform becoming used less as more trains were extended to Gloucester. The service between Cinderford and Drybrook was withdrawn from 7 July 1930, the last trip being on Saturday 5 July, whilst in December 1932 a Saturdays-only evening train from Cinderford to Gloucester was worked without a guard as an economy measure. The method of working in 1952 was thus: the auto set left Lydney at 7.20 a.m. for Grange Court, running thence to Cinderford (arrive 8.45) and leaving for Gloucester at 9.0 (arrive 9.43). The auto made two further trips to Cinderford and back, and on Saturdays only there were two evening trips each way between Cinderford and Gloucester, and an afternoon short working between Cinderford and Newnham only, connecting there with main-line trains. The stock was worked back to Lydney during the week as the 5.30 p.m. auto from Gloucester, but as empty stock on Saturday. The passenger service was withdrawn on and from 3 November 1958; the last run was on Saturday 1 November 1958. No normal passenger trains were ever operated (apart from occasional excursions), and the auto-trains handled all the traffic. After 1918 By the late 1920s the sheer volume of traffic in the movement of coal, and the corresponding flow of empty wagons, had created serious problems on the branch once again, this time complicated by the passenger service. Eastern United Colliery was in a fairly cramped position and had limited siding space, which required regular clearance, especially during the winter when the colliery was at full output. During the summer there was the problem of loaded wagons of coal awaiting orders. With such limited siding space, the colliery could not hold them and the GWR soon filled any available siding accommodation to capacity. The output from both Eastern and Northern United Collieries kept the Forest of Dean branch very busy, but the somewhat restricted accommodation at Bullo Junction was critical. About 1932, additional loops were provided, but at the same time it was proposed to demolish the engine shed, extend the siding through it and extend the adjoining siding to provide accommodation for a further fifty wagons. Despite the problems in coping with the output of the two new collieries at Eastern and Northern United, other traffic was in decline. Passengers were increasingly attracted to the more convenient motor bus services, and other collieries and industries were dwindling. Ruddle Road Halt had been closed on 29 April 1917 and Bilson Halt was closed again from 1 October 1920 although it reappeared in later timetables. The rest of the decade saw further economies in the face of increasing competition from motor buses in the Forest. On 17 May 1927 Cinderford signal box was closed, the signals taken out of use, and the line from Cinderford Junction to the terminus was worked on the one engine in steam principle. Closure Drybrook Quarries were closed and the branch from Whimsey ceased to function in February 1953. The section from Churchway sidings, back to Bilson, closed on 28 December 1965, and the rest of the line, back to Bullo Pill, closed to freight on 3 August 1967. The Bullo Pill Docks line closed on 12 August 1963. Topography =Main line= Leaving the South Wales line at Bullo Pill West box (considered to be the zero point for mileages), and crossing the main road, Bullo Cross halt (32 chains) was on the down side, after which the line climbed to Hay Hill tunnel (1,064 yards). Less than 300 yards separated Soudley tunnel from Bradley Hill tunnel (299 yd) and beyond, on the up side, was a gated spur, Soudley siding, serving a small wharf by the road. Upper Soudley halt (2 m 17 ch) was on the up side. The line made a sharp turn northward at Scilly Point, and an early siding of that name served Findall iron-mine. Blue Rock tunnel (109 yards) followed, after which came Shakemantle siding, established by 1856 on the up side. This served the iron mine, and later the great limestone and dolomite quarries. The quarries had no road access as late as 1936, but for some years the siding, still partly laid with old broad-gauge bridge rail, was derelict. At the northern Shakemantle connection a short siding on the down side, Quidchurch, served a wharf on which a tramway incline (probably rope-worked) from Quidchurch colliery terminated. Another curve, under a road bridge, brought the line to Eastern United colliery, near the site of Staple Edge brickworks, themselves served by sidings existing in 1856. The colliery sidings diverged from the passing loop, on the up side of which was Staple Edge halt (3 m 26 ch). The loop was opened on 14 December 1913 to serve the new colliery. Later, two sidings were added on the up side, for additional wagon storage, but they were probably never used and they were later removed. A small siding at Meerbrook was laid by 1878, on the down side, serving a tramroad spur from Staple Edge quarry. At Cinderford Bridge the Speech House road was crossed on the level, with Ruspidge Halt (4 m 5 ch) immediately beyond on the down side. On the up side a single siding served the old goods shed. In 1925 an existing disused siding was extended to form a loop leading to two new sidings for obtaining ballast from the ironworks slag-tip. The replacement was lifted in 1939 but, long before, a short branch, built with the broad-gauge line but lifted after a few years, crossed the brook by a 3-arch stone bridge to Cinderford Bridge colliery. Passing Cinderford ironworks site on the up side, there was Bilson Ballast siding, used as a runaway siding in 1895, the points for it being set by hand, unless a train was passing. Beyond this was the Lightmoor Colliery Railway ironworks branch and, adjacent on the up side, was Bilson halt. The colliery railway on the down side, with a loop siding, ran under Letcher's Bridge which, until 1929, carried the Crump Meadow tramroad. Bilson Yard (4 m 74 ch) had three long tracks giving access to the Churchway branch, with a separate line on the up side, which divided to form the Whimsey and Cinderford station branches. There were other sidings for the Crump Meadow and Foxes Bridge collieries, the goods shed, and the Trafalgar colliery tramway, together with a spur off the Cinderford line, used as a rail- motor lay-by. =The Whimsey branch= The Cinderford line followed a sharp curve, past the site of Cinderford Junction (5 m 27 ch), to Cinderford station, formerly S&WR; property. The Whimsey branch passed under the S&WR; line, by the site of the Dam Pool, a relic of Cinderford ironworks; adjacent, on the up side, was a broad-gauge siding, probably called Spero. On the down side again Broadmoor brickworks and Duck colliery (5 m 40 ch) were served by sidings until post-war years, and beyond was Whimsey Halt, opposite which, on the up side, was a short-lived broad gauge branch to Regulator Colliery. Whimsey goods station (5 m 60 ch), renamed Cinderford Goods in 1884, was on the up side. Behind it was a large sawmill, once served by a siding, and Berry, Wiggins & Co.'s depot, established in 1949 for transferring bitumen from rail tanks to road tankers. On the down side was Dowlais siding, with the wharf on which the tramroad from Edge Hill terminated. Whimsey was the terminus of the branch from 1854 until the Mitcheldean Road line was built. The Mitcheldean Road and Forest of Dean Railway was authorised but ran out of money before completing construction, and it was acquired by the GWR. The GWR completed the construction but left it unused for some years, after which they opened the section from Whimsey to Speedwell sidings (6 m 63 ch) in July 1885. The extension to Drybridge followed in 1907 - 1908 on the introduction of passenger railmotors. The continuation of the line was therefore a GWR construction, in adoption of the Mitcheldean Road and Forest of Dean Railway route. Steam Mills halt was on the up side beyond a level crossing, after which came a shallow embankment, a bridge across the tramroad, an unusual joint bridge taking the Trafalgar tramway and the railway under a road, a skew girder bridge across the tramway, and Nailbridge halt (up side). Immediately beyond the halt was a bridge carrying the Drybrook road, followed by Speedwell siding, a loop to the running line, serving the Speedwell Newbridge level. Though officially closed in 1897, activity continued thereafter and the siding connections were not finally taken out of use until 6 January 1938. =From Bilson Junction to Churchway= The FODR line continued northward to Churchway: the New Bowson Deep Coal Company had a siding, licensed in 1868, but this fell out of use and in 1925 Bowson N & S ground frames were opened, traffic being taken up to Churchway for running round, before continuing to Bilson. Brickworks siding, on the up side, was put in to serve the small Hawkwell tinplate works, established in 1879 in connection with the existing Hawkwell colliery. In 1937 Brickworks siding (5 m 67 ch) was brought into use. The Northern United colliery was opened in 1935, when two ground frames were brought into use on the up side, one near Brickworks siding controlling outwards traffic and the other, nearer the branch terminus, controlling inwards empties. The private sidings, gravity-worked, covered part of the Hawkwell railway route, and further on crossed the site of East Slade colliery sidings which existed in 1856 but fell out of use, with the colliery, in about 1905. The terminus of the Churchway branch was a short loop; a private siding, long out of use, served the Nelson colliery and brickyard.

The party finds its roots with the split in Dravidar Kazhagam after which Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) was formed. E. V. K. Sampath, a founding member of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, left the party following differences with the party leadership. The differences arose due to the DMK's stance on achieving an independent nation called Dravida Nadu. Nevertheless, within years the Tamil National Party was merged with Indian National Congress. E. V. K. Sampath and DMK E. V. K. Sampath was nephew of Periyar E. V. Ramasamy and for a long time considered his political heir. He entered into a feud with Periyar after the latter married a woman much younger to him. Periyar soon after the marriage declared his new wife as his political heir and thus upsetting Sampath's aspirations. The marriage itself had caused opposition within the Dravidar Kazhagam, the social organisation that Periyar was heading. E. V. K. Sampath along with C. N. Annadurai broke away from Dravidar Kazhagam and formed their own party Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. Differences on using movie media Tamil cinema has been used extensively for popaganda for Dravidian politics. Although the Indian National Congress in the region did use movies and stars for propaganda, it was shunned upon by major Congress leaders. DMK to the contrary used the Tamil film industry as a major political organ. Thus movie stars held high ranks in the party. Sampath vehemently opposed the importance given to film stars in the party. Birth of Tamil National Party The differences between E. V. K. Sampath and Annadurai finally gave way on their stands on Dravida Nadu. Dravida Nadu was envisaged by Periyar E. V. Ramasami as an independent nation that included South India. Periyar and later Annadurai considered that remaining in the Union meant accepting linguistic domination of the North and backwardness of the South. Nevertheless, after touring the Soviet Union, E. V. K. Sampath opposed the call for Dravida Nadu and declared that the idea of independent Dravida Nadu was an impossible task to achieve. With this difference E. V. K. Sampath and his supporters left DMK and formed their own party. Thus Tamil National Party was born in 1962. Some of the well known members of the party included Kannadasan, M. P. Subramaiam, Pazha Nedumaran and Shivaji Ganesan. Policies of the party The policies of the party were: * Autonomous National linguistic regions with the freedom to secede from the federation based on the free will of the peoples. * Establishing a society sans inequalities by Industrialisation of Tamil Nadu. * Eradication of superstitions, castes, religions and all atrocities against humanity to usher in a just society based on rationalism. Merger with Congress Soon after the departure from DMK Tamil National Party members closely associated with that of the Congress party. At that time Periyar and his Dravidar Kazhagam was close with Kamaraj the leader of the Congress party. Thus when Kamaraj invited Sampath to join the Congress, Sampath merged Tamil National Party with the Congress party in 1964.

The film won several Japanese film awards, including Tanie Kitabayashi who won awards for Best Actress at Kinema Junpo Awards, Mainichi Film Concours, and the Japanese Academy Awards.  Plot  Three recently released criminals decide to kidnap an 82-year-old woman, Toshiko Yanagawa (Tanie Kitabayashi), the wealthiest woman in Wakayama Prefecture. They stake out her mansion, observing her for two months. During that time, Toji occasionally leaves the mansion to go on mountain hikes with her chambermaid Kimi. It is on one of those hikes that the three kidnappers make their move. Toji calmly negotiates with the kidnappers to let Kimi go. But once they have Toji in their car en route to the hideout, she begins giving them advice on how to avoid the police, convincing them to take her to a former servant's house instead of to their hideout. There, Toji is insulted to hear the kidnappers say her ransom is only 50 million yen (about 350,000 in American dollars of the time), and demands they raise it to 10 billion yen (a conversion to $6,666,666 is explicitly stated in the film). The kidnappers are aghast, but ultimately they comply. Furthermore, Toji also orchestrates how the ransom note will be delivered, how her family will get the money together, and how the police will deliver it. Police inspector Daigoro Igari (Ken Ogata) takes a special interest in the case because of Toji's charity towards him in the past. He addresses the kidnappers on TV to express skepticism that Toji really is safe. Toji arranges a TV broadcast from an undisclosed location, to show that she really is safe and to instruct her family on how to sell off some of their land so that after taxes there is enough money to pay the ransom. Ten billion yen turn out to take up a lot of space, so much so that a helicopter loaded with it barely has room left for the pilot. A second helicopter follows the ransom helicopter, but after setting down in a mountain pass, the ransom helicopter disappears. After flying an erratic path all over the wilderness, the pilot is found in a cave, drugged to sleep. Meanwhile, one of the kidnappers has fallen in love with a local woman and decided to become an honest man; he refuses his share of the ransom. Another kidnapper does take his cut, but he takes it to mean what he was originally promised, ten million yen. And the kidnapper who came up with the idea in the first place decides to go to work for Toji as a carpenter. His first task is to repair a shrine. Inspector Igari shows up to let Toji know he has figured out most of her plan and its purpose: to evade taxes and prevent \\"her\\" mountains from falling into government ownership. Igari suspects most of the ten billion yen are hidden in the recently repaired shrine, but he also indicates he won't pursue the matter.

Family and early life Maitland was born in Scotland in 1771, the third son of Colonel the Honourable Richard Maitland, who was himself the fourth son of Charles Maitland, 6th Earl of Lauderdale. His mother was Mary Maitland, née McAdam, of New York City. John Maitland was born into a substantial naval dynasty. His uncle was Frederick Lewis Maitland, who was a captain in the navy, and his first cousin was Frederick Lewis Maitland, who reached the rank of rear-admiral. John Maitland also entered the navy, and by 1793 was a midshipman aboard John Jervis's flagship . Maitland was involved in the attacks on the French colonies of Guadeloupe and Martinique, often serving on shore with landing parties. In the assault on Fort Fleur d'Épée he was the first person over the walls, and came to the rescue of Captain Robert Faulknor when Faulknor was attacked by two Frenchmen. Maitland ran one through with a pike and went on to kill another seven or eight of the garrison. During the attack on Pointe-à-Pitre, Guadeloupe, Maitland took over command of the landing parties as an acting- lieutenant when all of the more senior officers had been killed or incapacitated by wounds or exhaustion. Command =Lively and Kingfisher: \\"Doctor Maitland's Recipe\\"= He received his commission as a lieutenant on 20 July 1794, and returned to serve in home waters, initially aboard the 32-gun frigate , under Lord Garlies. Maitland then followed Garlies into the 32-gun frigate , soon becoming her acting commander and sailing her to join Jervis's Mediterranean Fleet. He continued to serve with considerable gallantry, capturing the French frigate Touterelle in 1795. An impressed Jervis promoted him to commander on 23 December 1796, appointing him to the sloop . Maitland was moved to in April 1797, and took her to cruise off Portugal. On 1 August though he was almost the victim of a mutiny. Taking a direct approach he gathered his officers and marines and attacked the mutineers with swords and cutlasses, killing and wounding several. This decisive action quashed the mutiny, and met with Jervis's approval. He described Maitland's actions as 'Doctor Maitland's recipe', and advised that it should be adopted in future instances of attempted mutiny. A further promotion for Maitland followed, he was made post-captain on 11 August 1797 and was given command of , one of the prizes captured by Nelson at the Battle of Cape St Vincent. =Channel duties= Maitland sailed the San Nicolas to Britain, where she was paid off at Plymouth on her arrival, and Maitland went ashore. He married Elizabeth Ogilvy on 22 April 1799, and by 1800 had returned to active service aboard the 36-gun in the English Channel. He moved to the 38-gun in 1803, and on 24 July 1803 he spotted the French 74-gun third-rate Duguay-Trouin and the 38-gun frigate Guerrière sailing off Ferrol, Spain. Maitland decided to test whether the French ships were armed en flûte and were being used as troopships, and closing to within range, opened fire. The French returned fire, revealing they were fully armed and manned, and Maitland broke off. The French pursued, but were unable to catch him. Maitland continued on in the Channel, but while sailing off Brest the Boadicea struck the Bas de Lis rock and was badly holed. She returned to Portsmouth and was back on station eight days later, having spent just three days in dock. He went on to have a successful cruise, capturing the 12-gun French Vanteur, and several merchants. Maitland and the Boadicea spent 1804 enforcing the blockade of Rochefort, followed by a period in the North Sea and off the Irish coast. On 2 November he came across a squadron of four French ships of the line under Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley, that had escaped from the Battle of Trafalgar two weeks previously. Maitland fired rockets to attract a nearby British squadron under Captain Sir Richard Strachan, but subsequently lost the French in fog. Strachan was able to make contact with the French thanks to Maitland, and after engaging them in the battle of Battle of Cape Ortegal, captured all of the French ships. A few days later Maitland spotted and gave chase to a French frigate, eventually breaking off after two days pursuit due to the nearness of the coast. He later learnt that the French frigate had run onto the island of Groix. In the autumn of 1806 Boadicea was employed protecting the whale fishery in the Davis Strait. He escorted a convoy to Britain from Oporto, and followed this with service on the Irish station in 1807, blockading Le Havre. During this time the 14-gun French privateer General Concleux was captured, and Maitland left the Boadicea in 1808. He was appointed to the 98-gun in late 1813, spending the rest of the war aboard her in the Mediterranean. Flag rank and later life Maitland married for the second time at Bath on 8 January 1820, this time to Dora Bateman. He was promoted to rear-admiral on 19 July 1821 and died at Montagu Square, London on 20 October 1836 at the age of 65.

Crosby's interests focus on metaphysics, American pragmatism, philosophy of nature, existentialism, and philosophy of religion. He is a member of the Highlands Institute of American Religious and Philosophical Thought (HAIRPT)Highlands Institute of American Religious and Philosophical Thought and has been a leader in the discussions on Religious Naturalism. Biography Crosby is a Religious Naturalist having contributed to the movement with six books and a number of journal articles and chapters in books. He argues that nature itself, without notions of God, gods, animating spirits, or supernatural beings or realms of any kind, is both metaphysically and religiously ultimate, and thus an appropriate and compelling focus of religious commitment and concern. Nature as a whole can be considered sacred. This is so despite the radical ambiguities of nature, or its intricate mixtures of goods and evils, to which he calls sustained attention in his 2008 book Living with Ambiguity: Religious Naturalism and the Menace of Evil. He was born in Mansfield, Ohio, and grew up in Pensacola, Florida. He attended Davidson College in North Carolina and trained for the Presbyterian ministry at Princeton Theological Seminary. He was minister of a Presbyterian church in Christiana, Delaware, for three years and decided after that time to study for a doctorate in religion, with emphasis on philosophy of religion and ethics, in the joint program in religion at Union Theological Seminary and Columbia University in New York City. During the first two years of his doctoral work he served as part-time assistant minister at the First Congregational Church on the Green in Norwalk, Connecticut. Following upon his doctoral studies, he became an assistant professor of philosophy and religion at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. In the fall of 1965 he began teaching religious studies and philosophy in the philosophy department at Colorado State University, from which he retired as Emeritus Professor of Philosophy in 2001. Crosby demitted the Presbyterian ministry in 1969 and began to develop his version of religious naturalism in writings dating from the early 1990s, reaching fuller expression in A Religion of Nature in 2002, and continuing to the present. Impetus for this process of development also dates from the writing of his book on philosophical nihilism, The Specter of the Absurd, published in 1988 and from his study of, and constructive work on, theories of religion in Interpretive Theories of Religion, published in 1981. The writing of his doctoral dissertation on Horace Bushnell’s theory of language, published in 1975 as Horace Bushnell’s Theory of Language in the Context of Other Nineteenth Century Philosophies of Language, contributed greatly to the freeing of his mind from any vestiges of biblical or theological literalism, as did his studies of the origins and characters of the Hebrew and Christian scriptures at Princeton. In addition, Crosby’s exposure to the field of world religions at Columbia helped to broaden his thought far beyond its earlier religious conservatism. The God is Dead movement in the 1960s, and especially its reflections on theological implications of the atrocities of the Nazi regime and the carnage of World War II, had an important influence on his abandonment of traditional theism. Finally, teaching courses on the philosophy of religion and on various philosophical systems in a secular university challenged him constantly to reflect on the relevance of religious and philosophical thought for his time and to continue to work out his own religious and philosophical outlook. He has been strongly influenced by the thought of William James, John Dewey, Alfred North Whitehead, and Paul Tillich in doing so, but other great philosophical and religious thinkers of the Western tradition have made their decisive contributions to his outlook as well, as have important writers about Eastern ways of thinking and living. Still another major influence on Crosby’s outlook is the findings of contemporary science, especially in the fields of cosmology, evolutionary biology, and ecology. Crosby summarizes much of his current mode of religious and philosophical thought with four “Ps”: pluralism, perspectivism, processism, and pragmatism. Discussion of the natures and interrelations of these four themes in his philosophy is presented, among other places, in his 2005 book Novelty and in the book Living with Ambiguity. To these four major themes typifying Crosby’s philosophical and religious outlook should be added the theme of his religious and philosophical naturalism. A sixth basic theme, also developed in his book Novelty, is the theme of emergentism, especially the emergence of life from non-life and of conscious life from organic life in general. A final important theme brought to the fore in this book is his defense of indeterminism and freedom. This theme is given further development in his books \\"Nature as Sacred Ground\\" and \\"Consciousness and Freedom.\\" All these themes have far-reaching consequences for philosophy of nature and a religious naturalism.

After some reluctance by its studio Vera Cruz, Barreto shot it in 1952. After its release it was national and international success, and won several film awards, including at the Cannes Film Festival. It was poorly received in retrospect despite being praised by the time of its release and started a subgenre in Brazilian cinema. Cast * Alberto Ruschel as Teodoro * Marisa Prado as Olívia * Milton Ribeiro as Galdino * Vanja Orico as Maria Clódia * Adoniran Barbosa as Mané Mole Production In 1950, Lima Barreto joined the film studio Companhia Cinematográfica Vera Cruz invited by its then president Alberto Cavalcanti. After releasing two documentaries successfully for the studio, Painel and Santuário, Barreto get the chance to direct a feature film. With the idea to shoot a film about Lampião since the early 1940s, he only commenced to shoot it in 1952 after some reluctance by Franco Zampari, Vera Cruz's founder. Although he went to Bahia and did some research there, it was shot in Vargem Grande do Sul, São Paulo, with a production that lasted nine months due to internal conflicts. Reception O Cangaceiro was released on January 20, 1953, and was a public success; it grossed 30 million Brazilian cruzeiros (about $1.5 million) in the 24 Brazilian theaters in which it spent six weeks. After its national success, it was distributed to over 80 countries, becoming one of the most internationally successful Brazilian films—a feat uncommon in that time. It led it to be considered Vera Cruz's \\"high point\\" and its \\"most important production\\" by Georges Sadoul, author of Dictionary of Films, and by O Estado de S. Paulos Luiz Zanin, respectively. After winning several Brazilian awards, the film was entered into the 1953 Cannes Film Festival, where it was \\"much liked for its original and truly national flavour.\\" O Cangaceiro won the Best Adventure Film Award, making it the first Brazilian film to win a prize at Cannes, and received a special mention to Gabriel Migliori's musical composition. At the Edinburgh International Film Festival it was awarded the Best Film. It received mixed commentaries since its release. It was once voted the best Brazilian film in 1968 by National Film Institute's magazine Revista Film Cultura. Sadoul declared, \\"Lima Barreto well conveys a sense of poetry of the open desert space of the Sertão and makes this story lively and suspenseful\\". After praising its cast performances and its \\"thrilling\\" musical score, Bosley Crowther of The New York Times said, \\"This [O] Cangaceiro is a picture that will cause the Western fans to rub their eyes.\\" However, Cinema Novo representants—mainly Glauber Rocha—would criticize it for borrowing too much the style of American films. Critics also went on to comment on its \\"sociological inaccuracies.\\" Legacy It is the first film to mix cangaço with Western, starting a genre called \\"Nordestern\\" —an amalgam of the words \\"Nordeste\\" (Northeast) and \\"Western\\". It would be followed by successful films such as Carlos Coimbra's A Morte Comanda o Cangaço (1960), Lampião, o Rei do Cangaço (1964) and Corisco, o Diabo Louro (1969), and Aurélio Teixeira's Os Três Cabras de Lampião. It also established cangaço as a subgenre in Brazilian cinema; subsequently, cangaço would be featured as a theme from comedy—such as Os Três Cangaceiro and O Lamparina—to pornochanchada films—As Cangaceiras Eróticas and A Ilha das Cangaceiras Virgens. Also, Ruschel and Ribeiro would reprise the role of \\"good cangaceiro\\" and \\"bad cangaceiro\\" in other films.

The first use of the term dates from 1624, and the design became common in French gardens and English gardens of the late 17th century.Taylor 2006, p. 369. Typically it focused on the entrance front of a house, and the road on its central axis continued as the entrance drive. The idea for the patte d'oie may have originated in town planning schemes where roads converged onto a single space or feature, such as the Piazza del Popolo in Rome.Curl 2006, p. 563. It is often a feature of site plans for the grander French châteaux of the 17th and 18th centuries, in which the roads converge on an important element of the central axis.

He is currently a member of the Chrome Lacrosse Club in the Premier Lacrosse League and was selected by the Philadelphia Wings of the National Lacrosse League. He never played for them. Queener is best known as a field lacrosse goaltender, however he plays an offensive position in indoor box lacrosse. Queener is currently the head coach of the Gulf Coast High School varsity lacrosse team. Early years Queener, a field lacrosse goaltender, began playing high-school varsity lacrosse for the Penn Yan Academy as an 8th grader. At Penn Yan, under his father and head coach Harry Queener, he helped the team capture five consecutive sectional titles. As a high school senior, Queener was recognized by US Lacrosse as an All-American. College career After high school, Queener enrolled at Penn State University, but left due to being kicked out by the college. He then enrolled at Herkimer County Community College. While at Herkimer, Queener led the lacrosse team to the 2005 National Junior College Athletic Association national championship, and was named \\"National Junior College Player of the Year\\". Queener transferred and joined the University at Albany Great Danes, an NCAA Division I collegiate lacrosse program in 2006. During his first game with the Great Dane's, against the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays, Queener ran the length of the field and scored a goal. He would accomplish this feat four more times during his career, setting a Division 1 lacrosse record for most career goals scored by a goal tender with five. While at Albany, he was named to the All-America East Conference team three times. In 2007, he led the Great Danes to the 2007 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship tournament, advancing to the quarterfinals before losing, in overtime, to Cornell University. Even though Queener was the team's starting goaltender, during man-up situations he would come out of net, exchange his goaltender stick for a short crosse and play offense. MLL career Queener was selected with the fifth-round selection (48th overall) by the Rochester Rattlers in Major League Lacrosse in the 2008 MLL Collegiate Draft. Queener was named Rookie of the Week in week 12 of the 2008 MLL season. He went on to help the Rattlers win their first Steinfeld Cup championship, splitting goaltender responsibilities with Mike Levin. With Levin starting the first half of the championship game, Queener came off the bench to play the second half. Making 10 saves, Queener also was involved in \\"highlight reel\\" clearings of the ball from the defensive end to the offensive side of the field. He was a factor on offensive plays, and assisted on one goal. His play was described by league MVP John Grant, Jr. as \\"a special half by a goaltender.\\" In part due to this performance, Inside Lacrosse named Queener the \\"Lacrosse Personality of the Year.\\" Prior to the 2014 season, he became a member of the Florida Launch, the first professional lacrosse team in Florida. During the second quarter of the game, Queener took a shot to his hand. He came out of the game, and the backup, Adam Fullerton, was put in. Queener came out after halftime with a sling on his arm. He needed an x-ray. The shot may have broken his hand. NLL career Undrafted in the National Lacrosse League draft, Queener joined the expansion Boston Blazers as a free agent. As a field lacrosse goalkeeper, Queener attended the Blazers free agent camp attempting to make the team as a field player and not a goaltender (the skills required and the protective equipment worn by indoor, or box lacrosse goaltenders are very different from the field lacrosse goaltender). After attending a free agent camp, Queener was invited to participate in the Blazers regular camp. Prior to the season, the Blazers announced that Queener made the roster as a transition or forward player. In his first professional indoor lacrosse game, Queener recorded two assists and nine looseballs. Queener played three seasons with the Blazers before the team folded in the summer of 2011. He was chosen in the fourth round of the resulting dispersal draft by the Philadelphia Wings. Personal Queener comes from a lacrosse family. His father Harry is a lacrosse coach at Penn Yan Academy. His mother is also a coach of the girls team at the high school. His brother, Brice, is a former professional lacrosse player and currently a lacrosse coach. His older sister, Sarah, was a collegiate All-American and is current women's lacrosse head coach at Pomona-Pitzer Colleges. His younger sister, Sylvia, plays Division II women's lacrosse at Limestone College.

Published in 1853, it has 1280 pages, and measures approximately long by wide, and thick, and is bound in burgundy red velvet with gilt edges. The back flyleaf of the Bible bears the seal of the Supreme Court of the United States along with a record of the 1861 inauguration.

History Donald Trump using the Lincoln Bible (being held by wife Melania Trump, with his personal Bible on top of it) to take oath of office at his inauguration. Abraham Lincoln reached Washington, D.C. for his inauguration in 1861. His belongings, including his Bible, had yet to arrive. William Thomas Carroll, the clerk of the U.S. Supreme Court, fetched a Bible that he kept for official use. This became the Lincoln Bible. Although the Bible remained with Carroll for a time, the Lincolns acquired it at an unknown time. The Bible later remained with the Lincoln family up until 1928, at which point Mary Eunice Harlan, the widow of Robert Todd Lincoln, donated it to the Library of Congress. When the Bible was donated, it contained markers at the 31st chapter of the Book of Deuteronomy and the fourth chapter of the Book of Hosea. Barack Obama chose this Bible for his inaugurations in 2009 and 2013.

This mycorrhizal fungus is recognized by its white inner surface and hairy brown outer surface. The specific epithet is derived from the Latin word hemisphaericum, meaning half a sphere. Taxonomy This species was originally described by Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries in 1823 as Peziza hemisphaerica.Fries EM. (1823). Systema mycologicum. Vol 2. Ex Officina Berlingiana, Lundae, Sweden. 620 pp. He considered it to be one of the Lachnia, a name he applied to cup fungi with hairy apothecia. In 1870 Leopold Fuckel transferred P. hemisphaerica to the genus Humaria.Fuckel L. (1870). Symbolae mycologicae. Beiträge zur Kenntnis der rheinischen Pilze. Jahrbuch des Nassauischen Vereins für Naturkunde 23-24:1-459. Description Humaria hemisphaerica has fruiting bodies (apothecia) that typically measure in diameter by deep. The fruiting bodies are initially spherical and expand to become cuplike at the fungus matures. This species typically does not have a stipe―when it does, it is present as a small abrupt base. The inner surface of the fruiting body (the hymenium) is white, while the outer hairy surface is brown and covered with brown hairs that taper to a sharp point. These hairs are 400–500 x 15–20 μm. The ascospores are elliptical, hyaline, 20–22 x 10–11 μm, and have 2–3 oil droplets. The hairy fairy cup is inedible. Habitat Humaria hemisphaerica grows solitary, scattered, or in groups on the ground or sometimes on rotten wood in wooded areas. Similar species There are several other cup fungi with hairy exteriors that may be confused with H. hemisphaerica. Jafnea semitotsa is larger (2-5 cm diameter) with a brown interior and a short stipe. Trichophaea boudieri and Trichophaea bullata are smaller (1-6 mm diameter).Trichophaea abundans is another small species that prefers to grow in burned areas.

With over 25,000 works of art that span cultures, eras, and media, the Snite Museum's permanent collection serves as a rich resource for audiences on campus and beyond. Through programs, lectures, workshops, and exhibitions, the museum supports faculty teaching and research and provides valuable cultural opportunities for students and visitors. Students play an active role in programming in their capacities as gallery guides and as student advisory members.  History  Before the Snite opened in 1980, Notre Dame did not have an art museum, although various public spaces at the University offered galleries. As early as 1924, the Wightman Memorial Art Gallery at University Library was used for art exhibitions. In 1952, O'Shaughnessy Hall, home of the Notre Dame College of Arts and Letters, was equipped with galleries. During the 1950s, Croatian sculptor Ivan Meštrović was in residence at the University, working in the eponymous Meštrović Studio. In 1975, the Fred B. Snite family donated funds to construct the Snite Museum of Art. The museum opened in 1980, incorporating both Meštrović's sculpture studio (Snite is also home to the Ivan Meštrović papers) and the O'Shaughnessy art gallery, the latter used for the presentation of traveling and temporary exhibitions.  Museum Building and Future Expansion  Beatrice II d'Esteby Bartolomeo Veneto, part of the Renaissance collection The museum opened in the fall of 1980, consolidating the adjacent O'Shaughnessy Hall Galleries and the studio of sculptor Ivan Meštrović with the new structure. The 70,000 square-foot building, designed by Ambrose Richardson, A.I.A., was a gift of the Snite Family in memory of Frederick Jr. '33. With the donation in 2018 of funds from lead benefactors Ernestine Raclin and her daughter and son-in-law Carment and Chris Murphy, plans are underway for construction of a 132,000 square foot complex to be built in two phases on the south edge of campus. The first phase of the Raclin Murphy Museum of Art is anticipated to be approximately 70,000 square feet and will house the museum galleries and other functions. In 2019, the University hired the leading classical design firm Robert A.M. Stern Architects (RAMSA), as the architects of the new museum. As a prominent element of a growing arts district, the Raclin Murphy Museum of Art will be situated in a location easily accessible for both on- and off- campus patrons. Construction is scheduled to commence in June 2020 with completion anticipated in 2022. Collection and Strengths The Snite's holdings are particularly strong in prints, photography, French 18th- and 19th painting, Baroque period paintings, decorative arts, African art, Olmec and Mesoamerican art, Native American art, and 20th-century art. The museum has been the fortunate recipient of exceptional holdings from donors, gifts responsible for many of the museum's strongest collections. These collections include the Jack and Alfrieda Feddersen Collection of Rembrandt Etchings; the Noah L. and Muriel S. Butkin Collection of 19th-Century French Art; the John D. Reilly Collection of Old Master and 19th-Century Drawings, the Janos Scholz Collection of 19th-Century European Photographs; the Mr. and Mrs. Russell G. Ashbaugh Jr. Collection of Meštrović Sculpture and Drawings; the George Rickey Sculpture Archive; and the Virginia A. Martin Collection of 18th-Century Decorative Arts. A generous gift by Charles S. Hayes made possible the creation of a unique public space for reflection, contemplation, and enjoyment of nature and art. Reopened in 2017, the Charles B. Hayes Family Sculpture Park was designed by noted American landscape architect Michael Van Valkenburgh on an eight-acre site at the south edge of the Notre Dame campus. A part of the Snite's permanent collection, the twelve sculptures in the park are by important national and international artists. The Snite holds paintings by artists such as Taddeo di Bartolo, Bernardino Luini, Memling, Francesco de Mura, Fiammingo, Corot, Gustave Colin, Walter Sickert, and Georgia O'Keeffe. It has late medieval paintings with devotional subject matter by Gentile da Fabriano (Master of Adoration of the Magi altarpiece, Minias of Florence, and Neroccio di Bartolomeo de' Landi. It has baroque period paintings by Ativeduto Grammatica, Francesco Trevisani, Francesco Vanni, Claude Lorrain, Simon Vouet, Nicolaes Maes, Jan Lievens, Jacobus Storck (\\"Port Scene\\"), and Isaack Luttichuys, Lubin Baugin. Its 18th-century collection includes paintings by François Boucher, Jean François de Troy, Carle Van Loo, and the American Benjamin West. It also has 19th-century paintings by Léon Cogniet (\\"View of Tivoli\\"), Gustave Courbet, Thomas Couture, Charles-François Daubigny, Jean- Léon Gérôme (Study for Picador), Alphonse Legros, Georges Michel, and Alexandre-Hyacinthe Dunouy. Americans represented with paintings at this art museum include Diego Lasansky, Marsden Hartley, Mauricio Lasansky, Milton Avery, Ralston Crawford, and Irish-born Sean Scully. 20th century painters also represented include Paula Modersohn-Becker (Tree), Natalia Goncharova (Spring), Joan Miró, Joaquín Torres García, Georgia O'Keeffe (Blue One), Philip Pearlstein, Otto Dix, and Josef Albers. There are also sculptures by Ivan Meštrović (Ashbaugh Madonna). Outreach programs Throughout the year, the Museum provides curriculum-related tours for 7,000 area-school children; after-school and summer programs at the Robinson Community Learning Center; summer art camps for at-risk children; art instruction for student teachers; and workshops for local K-12 instructors.

The Beacon, which occupies the Jersey City Medical Center's rehabilitated original complex, creates the northeastern corner of the Bergen Lafayette Section and is just east of McGinley Square. The Beacon includes of residential and retail space, approximately 1,200 luxury residences and of retail space. Jersey City Medical Center moved to the site in 1882, and the complex was expanded in stages through the mid-20th century. Metrovest Equities was designated the redeveloper of the property in the first decade of the 21st century. The redevelopment stalled after a down-turn in the market, but was completed by April 2016. The redeveloped complex, the largest concentration of Art Deco buildings in New Jersey, retains historical features of the exterior façades and public interior spaces. The complex is listed on the national and New Jersey registers of historic places. History The hospital began as the \\"Charity Hospital\\" by the Board of Aldermen of Jersey City who bought land at Baldwin Avenue and Montgomery Street in 1882 for a new hospital. The locale was chosen to remove the hospital from the industrial development at Paulus Hook. This building is now the Medical Center building. It was renamed the Jersey City Hospital in 1885 and had expanded to 200 beds. In 1909, the original hospital building was reserved for men and a second wing was added for women. When Frank Hague became mayor of Jersey City in 1917, he planned to expand the hospital. He had the original building renovated, and by the late 1920s started construction on a new 23-story structure for surgery. The new facility opened in 1931, and George O'Hanlon was the first director. During the Great Depression, new buildings were added as a Works Progress Administration project secured by Mayor Frank Hague, The Jersey City Medical Center included such architectural and designer trappings as marble walls, terrazzo floors, etched glass, decorative moldings and glittering chandeliers, and had one of the most famous maternity wards in the country – the Margaret Hague Maternity Hospital. The original main hospital building was demolished to make way for two new hi-rise structures. The formal dedication of the Medical Center Complex, including the new B. S. Pollack Hospital building, was on October 2, 1936, with Franklin D. Roosevelt dedicating the building. During the 1950s, JCMC was the home of the medical school of Seton Hall University, which later became the New Jersey Medical School, now located in Newark. Oversized and understaffed, in 1988 the Medical Center declared bankruptcy and became a private, non-profit organization. In 1994, the State of New Jersey designated the Medical Center as a regional trauma center, and in the late 1990s it was approved as a core teaching affiliate of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. The hospital and offices moved to a new complex in 2004. Prior to that, one building of the complex, 591 Montgomery Street had been converted for senior assisted-living residence. Metrovest Equities was designated the redeveloper of the property in 2003 and officially closed on it in 2005. The developer converted the ten federally landmarked, Art Deco buildings in the largest residential restoration project in the country and the largest in the history of New Jersey, with an expected cost estimated at $350 million. Use of existing infrastructure and restoration The rehabilitation of The Beacon represents a massive recycling and adaptive reuse effort. The existing buildings are listed on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places and National Register of Historic Places, and are the largest concentration of Art Deco buildings in the state. Unlike other proposals which had called for the demolition of the buildings, Metrovest intended to restore them to their original glory while simultaneously creating a viable new use using a team of craftsmen and historic preservationists to execute the restoration, which was performed under the Secretary of Interior's Guidelines for Historic Rehabilitation. This included rebuilding and restoring the buildings’ entire façades using the strictest of methods and materials, and restoring the protected interior spaces. A number of smaller low-rise buildings and utility structures were demolished throughout the complex over the years, and prior to total rehabilitation, especially in the area of Overlook Park, the new parking lots and the shuttle stop area. Painstaking efforts to re-establish the historic grandeur and character of the interior spaces included refurbishing original chandeliers, plaster, decorative painting, marble, elevator door surrounds and windows that were re-gilded with gold leaf. Former Art Deco theaters, lobbies, public corridors, executive offices and meeting rooms were restored, with many of the spaces converted to elaborate amenity offerings for Beacon residents, including Mayor Hague's former office which now serves as a poker room. The first buildings to be renovated were the Rialto and Capitol buildings, which now serve as residential condominiums and entertainment spaces. The restoration of these two buildings alone was estimated over $133 million and it took over four years to complete. In 2009, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Historic Preservation Office awarded an Outstanding Contribution of Excellence Award to the contractors and architects and others who participated in the restoration of the Rialto and Capitol buildings. Conversion Aerial photo of The Beacon in Jersey City, New Jersey One building of the complex at 591 Montgomery Street had been converted for senior assisted-living residence before Metrovest's involvement. The company completed the conversion of the first two buildings by 2008. Named The Rialto and The Capitol after famous theaters, the buildings contain 315 condominium residences, joined by a two-story lobby and a amenity core which features a gym, indoor pool, spa, screening room, and children's playroom. On the second floor are a restored theater/event space with catering kitchen and a rooftop sundeck. Other restored spaces include a poker room, reading gallery and a billiards hall. The next residential phase opened in 2012. The Mercury building features 126 rental residences. That was followed by the spring 2013 opening of The Orpheum, a 22-story, 158-unit rental building with one and two- bedroom residences offering 14-foot lofted ceilings. Construction continued on the parking garage that features a landscaped rooftop park with views of the Manhattan skyline, completed in late 2013. By early 2014 The Paramount building was next to be finished, with 20 stories of mainly one- and two- bedroom rental units, and its own gym. The final three buildings that were renovated were The Tower by late 2014, The Criterion in 2015, and The Hague by early 2016, all named after famous theaters.

In their short history, UU Singers achieved both national and international acclaim, winning the Grand Prize at the 2005 Florilège Vocal de Tours International Choir Competition in Tours, France, winning the European Grand Prix Choral Competition in Tolosa, Spain in 2006, winning first prize at the 11th International Chamber Choir Competition Marktoberdorf in 2009, participating in the 19th Festival “Choralies de Vaison-la-Romaine” in France and the 37th Abu Gosh international vocal music festival near Jerusalem.

Walker, the 2004 opening session of the Utah State Senate and the dedication ceremony of the Marriott Library with former first lady Laura Bush. They have collaborated with the Grammy Award-winning Kronos Quartet and also collaborated regularly with Utah-based groups, including the 23rd Army Band, the Salt Lake Choral Artists, the Brigham Young University Singers and Concert Choir, and the University of Utah Philharmonia, Wind Ensemble, A Cappella Choir, and Women’s Choir. They have performed in the Salt Lake Tabernacle, the Assembly Hall on Temple Square, and the Cathedral of the Madeleine. UU Singers premiered several new works, including William Hawley’s “Flos ut rosa Floruit,” for which they received a prize for the best new work at the Tours competition. In 2007, they were selected by the Barlow Endowment for Music Composition to premiere Judith Bingham’s “Ghost Towns of the American West” as part of an international performing consortium of choirs which included VocalEssence and the BBC Singers.

During his 21-year tenure conducting the Chamber Choir and teaching classes at the U, Professor Hales was known as an accomplished choral music arranger as well as a great and gifted musician. \\"Many current music educators were influenced by Dr. Hales as they took his choral methods, choral arranging, orchestration, elementary music methods, and other classes.\\"Obituary: Dr. Bernell Woodruff Hales, Jr. Published: Sunday, Nov. 19 2006 2:01 p.m. MST. Of key importance to Dr. Hales was the concept of vowel modification and blending, and his choirs could be so in tune as to produce overtones. He was a conductor who brought the music to life through his techniques. Many of his students went on to conduct choirs at the public school as well as university level, teaching what they had been taught.

Users could install applications from a variety of sources (over Wi-Fi or UMTS) provided by software developers or directly onto the iPhone without requiring a computer. Users could browse lists of applications inside Installer to find ones they wanted to install.

History In 1909, Tennessee Orphan Home began in Columbia, Tennessee, to meet the needs of the three Scotten children who were tragically orphaned. In 1934 the Church of Christ Tennessee Orphan Home bought the campus of the former Branham and Hughes Military Academy in Spring Hill, and the next year the orphanage was moved there from Columbia. Since 1909, over 21,000 children have been cared for at the Home. As with many of the old orphanages, the Home was originally designed as an institutional facility with central dining, central laundry, dormitory living and even a small farming operation to maintain a maximal level of self-sufficiency. The approach to child care was to provide the basic physical needs of children and to offer Christian instruction; however until recently the children received their main academic education from the public schools of Maury County operated by the Board of Education. The 1980s were a period of stable growth. There were many improvements in both programs and services offered. The number of children served grew throughout the decade. In late 1982, the name of the Home was changed to Tennessee Children's Home. The institutional approach was replaced with family-oriented group homes for the children, with each house led by married couples in an effort to provide a homelike, non-institutional setting. Both spouses in each group home are required to be active members of a congregation of the churches of Christ. Dormitories were remodeled into single family homes, with a maximum of eight children in each home. Central dining was replaced with family meals in the group homes. The family groups now individually carry on most activities like home devotionals, church attendance, housekeeping, laundry, cooking and cleanup. In 1988, the Home increased the number of children served under its direction by merging with another churches of Christ-related ministry, West Tennessee Children's Home. Continued growth in its service area occurred again in 2000 and 2001 through mergers with Happy Hills Youth Ranch near Ashland City, Tennessee and East Tennessee Christian Services in Knoxville, Tennessee. The Home has witnessed a change in the type of child needing help in recent times. Today the vast majority of residents are not \\"orphans\\" in the original sense that both of their birth parents are deceased, so now in addition to orphaned children, the Home receives children from a wide variety of dysfunctional family settings - including many abused and neglected youth who are struggling with their values and their relationships with other people. Their problems may be emotional, social, behavioral, educational or psychological or several of these. The services the Home now offers are designed to be flexible so each child is treated as an individual with unique needs. An unrelated organization with a similar name, the Tennessee Children's Home Society run by Georgia Tann, was involved in a baby-selling adoption scandal in the mid-twentieth century. The current Children's Home shares no connection with that former organization other than the similarity of names.

Plot Cyclops sends X-Force into the timestream in pursuit of Cable and Hope, shortening their operation against the Leper Queen despite Wolverine's protests. X-Force arrives in 2973, with hours to complete their mission before their time-travel devices kill them. Although Elixir removes his time-band, he does not return to the present. As Vanisher discovers his teleportation powers have failed, he is shot by a sniper (the future Deadpool). X-Force takes Deadpool in search of Cable, whom X-23 tracks to UN Headquarters. Wolverine finds Hope, and is held at gunpoint by Cable. When the team finds them, Cable tells X-Force that they are trapped and shows them the fortress of Apocalypse in the distance. Deadpool tells X-Force and Cable his 900-year story; Stryfe, not Apocalypse, rules this future. Cable refuses to believe this, and they are ambushed by Stryfe's soldiers. Stryfe has an alliance with Bishop, who agreed to help him kill Apocalypse in exchange for his aid in killing Cable. As X-Force overcomes Stryfe's troops, Archangel flies into the distance. Domino grows suspicious of Deadpool, who says that Stryfe just launched from his citadel and is about to kill them. Archangel investigates a cave and discovers a severely-injured Apocalypse. X-Force and Cable unsuccessfully battle Stryfe. Cable detonates explosives which destroy the cliff, but Stryfe captures Hope and Warpath. Warpath is tortured; Bishop neutralize Stryfe with nanomachines and tries to kill Hope, but Stryfe subdues him. X-Force splits into two teams: Wolverine, Elixir and Cable go to confront Stryfe and Domino, X-23, Vanisher and Deadpool search for what is keeping X-Force trapped in the future. Warpath unsuccessfully attacks Stryfe when he sees him with Hope. Stryfe awaits the arrival of Cable, who is quickly defeated. He realizes the purpose of the attack: to cloak Wolverine, who attacks him. Elixir tries his death touch on Stryfe, who subdues them with telekinesis (forcing Elixir to heal him and Wolverine to stab himself). In the cave Archangel decides against killing Apocalypse, who suggests that they kill Stryfe. Domino, X-23, Vanisher and Deadpool find what is keeping X-Force from returning to the present: Kiden Nixon, strapped to a device in Graymalkin which uses her time-manipulation powers to keep Stryfe's fortress out of the timestream. Deadpool says that he will save the \\"annoying messiah kid\\" and leaves. Cable and Bishop recover from Stryfe's assault and fight until Bishop leaves Cable to battle a brain-damaged Wolverine. As Bishop confronts Stryfe and Hope, Wolverine attacks Stryfe. Deadpool arrives with a laser cannon and blasts him off the platform. As Wolverine recovers and Deadpool celebrates, Stryfe returns and rips Deadpool in half. Archangel returns Apocalypse to his fortress, and they go to confront Stryfe. As Wolverine, Elixir, Warpath and Cable prepare to battle Stryfe, the time-travel devices reach 0:00 and try to pull X-Force into the present. Kiden is still alive and connected to Graymalkin, so X-Force remains in the future. Domino kills Kiden despite X-23's protests, and Vanisher removes his time band to return to the present. The rest remain to help Cable, who battles Stryfe until Archangel and Apocalypse arrive. Apocalypse declares the Age of Stryfe over. Bishop makes a final attempt to kill Hope, but is stopped by Cable. As Apocalypse and Archangel defeat Stryfe, Bishop escapes into the timestream. Apocalypse senses power in Hope and deems her worthy of hosting his essence, but Angel demands he return her in return for sparing his life. Apocalypse gives Hope to Cable, warning him that emotion will be their undoing. As X-Force leaves the citadel, Apocalypse teleports away with Stryfe. As Cable and Hope jump into the timestream, X-Force remains. Wolverine, Archangel and Elixir head to the United Nations, where they hope to find Hellion and Surge when they return to the present. As they remove their time bands, Domino and X-23 struggle to return to the building where Boom Boom was held by the Leper Queen. Domino goes blind and X-23, realizing that Domino is doomed, removes her time band and vows that she will save Boom Boom. X-23 crawls to her destination and, prepared to kill the Leper Queen, removes her time band to return to the present.

Its unofficial capital is Ciney. The region preserves the name of the Condrusi, a Germanic tribe which inhabited the area in the Roman era. Compared to other parts of Belgium, the Condroz is a sparsely populated, agricultural area. It consists of low hills of an average altitude of about 200 to 300 meters (670–970 feet). It is mainly situated in the provinces of Liège and Namur and also in smaller parts of the Belgian provinces of Hainaut and Luxembourg. It is bordered in the north by the Meuse river, in the east by the Ardennes, in the south by the Famenne region. Historically, the Condroz did not stretch west of the Meuse, but today there is a western section, south of Namur and the Sambre river stretching to the Thiérache and southern Hainaut. History Southern Belgium, showing the early medieval places recorded as being in the Pagus Condrustis and the Falminna (Famenne).The yellow dots are in the Pagus Condrustis (medieval Condroz) and the red stars are in the Famenne. The modern Province of Namur is in yellow. Late medieval catholic jurisdictions of Condroz and Famenne Very little is known of the Roman era Condrusi, after whom the region was originally named. Julius Caesar described them and the Segni as living between the Eburones, to their north, and the Treviri, who lived to their south in the area of what is now Arlon, Luxembourg and the Moselle region in modern Germany and France. From the fragmentary evidence it is known that citizens of the pagus or country of the Condrusi lived within the larger civitas of the Tungri, the Civitas Tungrorum, which had its capital in Tongeren. They fought in the Roman military and could earn Roman citizenship. In medieval records, the Pagus Condrustis or Condrustensis started to appear again from 747, in an area consistent with the old country of the Condrusi mentioned by Caesar. For the Christian church, Condroz was part of the Bishopric of Liège, which managed a region corresponding to the old Roman Civitas Tungrorum, though the capital had now moved from Tongeren to Liège. Unlike today, the medieval Condroz did not extend west over the Meuse river, into what is now the Belgian region Entre-Sambre-et-Meuse (fr), because this was part of the medieval Lommegau (de) or Pagus Lomacensis. To the south, the Famenne region, which is today considered distinct from the Condroz, was originally a part of the Condroz. South of the Famenne region is and was rougher and more wooded terrain of the Ardennes, which today stretches into France and Luxembourg. In 839, the Carolingian Emperor Louis the Pious granted the \\"county\\" of Condroz and the county of the Ardennes to his son Louis the German, effectively making the Meuse the boundary between the eastern and western Frankish kingdoms.https://www.dmgh.de/mgh_capit_2/index.htm#page/58/ (This is the only time the Condroz was described as a county like this.) To the east, the medieval Condroz stretched over the Ourthe. In 870 this area was specifically described in the Treaty of Meerssen, when the Condroz was allocated for some decades to the kingdom of the western Franks (from which France evolved).https://www.dmgh.de/mgh_ss_1/index.htm#page/488/ As a church jurisdiction under Liège, already in about 800 the Pagus Condrustinsus was mentioned as one of only four divisions of the bishopric, along with Lomme, the Ardennes, and the Hesbaye. By 1497 the medieval jurisdictions, which were reformed in 1559, an archdeaconry of the Fammene had been created from the southern part (together with the Chimay deanery from the Lomme pagus west of the Meuse). In at least two significant ways, the late medieval archdeaconry did not correspond to the Condroz in any geographical sense. *The geographical Hesbaye region north of the Meuse was divided between the Hesbaye archdeaconry and the neighbouring archdeaconries of Hainaut, Brabant and Condroz. Condroz held the deanery of Hanret in Hesbaye. *The archdeaconry of Condroz, like that of Hesbaye, was stretched significantly further west than the pagus or geographical region of Condroz itself, with the inclusion of the deanery of Saint Remacle, which stretched from Liège and Visé along the Vesdre, as far as what is now the Belgian border with Germany.For a listing of churches within this deanery see for example .

It is locally named Cape Newagen Road over its entire length. Route description SR 238 begins at an intersection between SR 27 (Hendricks Hill Road), Town Landing Road, and Cape Newagen Road (which carries SR 238) near the southern tip of Southport Island. This intersection is also the southern terminus of SR 27. Heading southbound on SR 27, the road bends to the left and becomes SR 238 north, and vice versa.

Since 2012, Pfleiderer is a 100% subsidiary of Atlantik S.A. from Luxembourg. The company was founded in 1894 in the town of Heilbronn and grew to one of Europe's largest producers of wood-based materials. When management was taken over by Hans Overdiek in 2003, a policy of rapid expansion was started. The company became excessively leveraged and made overpriced acquisitions, aimed primarily at the later struggling U.S. housing market. When the real estate crisis came to a head in 2008, Pfleiderer's high debt load turned into a financial disaster which led the company into bankruptcy in March 2012. With almost one billion euros of net debt, Pfleiderer became one of the largest corporate failures of recent German history. In 2006, the track system unit was sold to AXA Private Equity. As of 2013, the company has successfully emerged from bankruptcy. This was mostly achieved by the sale of many business units, including the laminate business and all North American activities.

The first order included 87 cars, with an option for a total of 585 cars. The cars arrived in Israel during 2008 and are gradually entering service in 2009. They were colored blue and white after the scheme won in a public poll published by Israel Railways. There have been a number of controversies surrounding the trains. After their delivery had been delayed by the manufacturer, problems were discovered in them and they were taken out of service in May 2009 but have since been gradually put back into service. Israel =Conception and delivery= Delivery at the Port of Ashdod right Siemens AG was chosen by Israel Railways to provide 87 cars for NIS 700 million, with an option for a total of 585 cars for NIS 4 billion, following an international tender in which Alstom and Bombardier also participated. The winner was chosen in January 2006 and the contract was signed in March 2006. The trains were constructed by Siemens in their factories in Prague, Maribor, and a temporary one built in Israel. The bogies were tested in Graz, Austria, and the cars in Switzerland by a company called PROSE, and delivered to Israel between June 18, 2008, and July 2009, after three delays. The color scheme was subject to a public poll, published by Israel Railways in newspapers and the Internet, which gave a choice of four designs: Blue and red with white stripes, blue, red and white, red with white stripes, and blue with white stripes. The blue and white design won with 34.9% of a total of 62,871 people who participated in the survey. 58,871 votes came from Internet users (at least 547 of whom were not from Israel), and an additional 4,000 rail travelers were polled by Israel Railways staff. There was no significant difference between the results of the two groups. In early 2010, due to an anticipated equipment shortage because of the opening of new rail lines, Israel Railways exercised its option to purchase additional units, ordering 4 control cars and 27 regular cars for the sum of €46 million. They are expected to arrive in the summer of 2011. =Technical specifications and features= There are three types of cars: a control car with a power generator, a regular passenger car, and a handicap-accessible passenger car with wheelchair equipment, including the Trainlift TR 450 technology. The control car is 25.6 meters long, while the trailer cars are 26.1 m long, although all cars have a length of 26.4 m including buffers. The total train length (10 cars) is 284 m. All cars are 2.8 m wide and 4.35 m high and weigh 56.1 tons (control car), 48.1 tons (regular car) and 47.9 tons (handicap- accessible car). The floor entrance height is 1.03 m. The wheel diameter is 92 centimeters, and the bogie (model SF-300) size is 2.5 m. The maximum service speed of the train is 160 km/h (100 mph), to be hauled by an Israel Railways Alstom/EMD JT42BW or Vossloh/EMD Euro locomotive and was initially meant to carry 10 passenger cars in total (including the control car and three wheelchair-accessible cars). The cars are connected with standard UIC gear. However, following initial testing in Israel, Israel Railways decided that only 8 or 9 cars would make up each train. The cars are connected by standard couplings as well as cables for power transmission. The cars are a monocoque design. The floor is 1,030 mm high, and 1,250 mm over the bogie sections. The control car is capable of seating 27 passengers (23 fixed seats at 1,850 seat pitch), while the trailer cars can seat 82 each (78 fixed and 4 folding seats, 1,080 mm pitch). The doors are 1,200 mm wide and 1,900 mm in height. They close either manually or after a set time after no movement is detected by electronic sensors. =Controversies= In February 2009, Ynet reported serious problems with the Viaggio Light model, including a longer stopping distance when traveling north, narrow doors and corridors, and problems with the Trainlift TR 450 technology. Israel Railways said that the allegations were exaggerated. These and other problems caused Israel Railways to take Viaggio Light out of service in May 2009, until the issues were sorted out.

After starting as a single lunch counter operation, George Webb Restaurants evolved into a chain of full-service family establishments serving made-to-order breakfasts, hamburgers and other sandwiches, soups, chili, and premium blend coffee. History In May 1948, George Webb opened the first \\"George Webb and Sons\\" lunch counter on the corner of Ogden and Van Buren Streets on the east side of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It began as a family business, with George, his wife Evelyn, and their three sons, Jim, Tom and Bob, all performing various tasks in the restaurant. In 1953, Jim Webb became the first George Webb franchise owner, when it was suggested by his father that he take over one of the restaurants. In 1957, not long after the business was passed on to his son, George Webb died. Jim Webb took over the management of the company, serving as president during a period of strong growth from the 1960s through the 1980s. In 1985, Jim Webb sold the now thriving chain to Dave Stamm, who had been a franchisee with the company for over 30 years. Current In 2005, after leading the company for 20 years, Dave Stamm turned operations over to Whitefish Bay businessman Philip Anderson, who had previously built a national rubber seal distributorship before taking on the task of managing George Webb Restaurants. George Webb celebrated its 60th birthday in 2008, though struggling to make this milestone. The company was in danger of going bankrupt in the middle of 2008. In an effort to get George Webb Restaurants out of the financial crisis, Anderson, who had lent money for the 2005 purchase of the company, pushed out owner Jayne Aliota and took over day-to-day operations. As of 2008, Webb had 40 locations including nine owned by the company. Later, the ownership of George Webb passed to M&I; Bank, which held a loan that financed the business. In mid 2010, Philip Anderson bought Webb's assets from M&I.; Webb required franchise operators to sign new agreements to get the franchises in a more typical franchise agreement with standardized menus. In August 2011, six former George Webb restaurants left the chain becoming \\"Griddlers Cafe\\".. As of late 2018, only two of these Griddlers Cafes remain. Gimmicks George Webb was a man noted for his gimmicks, and the restaurants continue that tradition. Locations have signs that display senseless phrases such as \\"Free rabbit lunch tomorrow\\", or \\"pay $10.00 for 1,893 pennies\\". =Clocks= George Webb Restaurants are known for displaying two clocks side by side in every restaurant, and there are two stories describing how this came about. One says that Webb originally had a wall full of clocks so that his patrons who used a nearby streetcar service would know the time. He had different clocks set at the current time at different places around the world. The streetcar rattled the clocks so violently that most of the clocks eventually fell off the wall. If asked, a worker will say that there had been a local law stating that no business could be open 24 hours per day. Webb installed two clocks and set them one minute apart. Technically, the company was closed one minute per day on one clock but not the other and Webb announced that his restaurants were open \\"23 hours, 59 minutes and 59 seconds, seven days a week and on Sundays\\". Currently, all George Webb locations are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, except on holidays. =Baseball prediction= George Webb Restaurants are famous for the traditional baseball prediction game that began in the 1940s and continues today. Webb was a baseball fan, and each year he predicted that the minor league Milwaukee Brewers would win 17 straight games. He continued the prediction as a publicity stunt when the Boston Braves (now Atlanta Braves) moved to Milwaukee in 1953. He printed napkins saying \\"George Webb's predicts the Braves will win 12 straight games.\\" The Braves left Milwaukee for Atlanta in 1965. The current incarnation of the Milwaukee Brewers major league team began in 1970 and he continued the promotion. The prediction continued in the 1970s with three 10-game wins streaks. While George Webb never promised to give away free hamburgers if the team won 12 straight games, on April 19, 1987, the Brewers won 12 straight games after a dramatic late inning win (the streak would reach 13) and in a three-day time period, 168,194 hamburgers were given away. In addition to their 12 win prediction, George Webb's offers 5 burgers for just $5 when the Brewers score 5 runs or more in any game, win or lose, home or away. Offer is valid the moment the 5th run is scored until midnight the following day. For spring training, the promotion is expanded, allowing customers to get the 5 for $5 deal any time during a ten-day period, regardless of the score. On October 12, 2018, the Brewers recorded their 12th consecutive win with a 6–5 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 1 of the 2018 National League Championship Series. Webb announced the free deal would be honored on October 18. Controversies Because of George Webb's commitment to staying open 24 hours a day, combined with the restaurants' reasonably low prices on food and drink, the chain has become a notorious refuge for homeless adults and juveniles. George Webb Restaurants have displayed a \\"No Loitering\\" sign in every restaurant, placed a two dollar minimum per person and a 20-minute time limit for a visit, although this rule is not strictly enforced.
