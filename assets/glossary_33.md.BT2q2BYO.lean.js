It is planned to operate 24/7 on a north‚Äìsouth corridor along the East River between the boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn. The BQX was initially proposed in 1989 as part of a Brooklyn waterfront streetcar line connecting Red Hook with Downtown Brooklyn. A study by the city, published in 2011, found the proposal to be infeasible. A later proposal by the nonprofit Friends of the Brooklyn Queens Connector, made public in January 2016, found backing from Mayor Bill de Blasio. A director for Friends of the Brooklyn Queens Connector was appointed in May 2016, and a list of possible routings was released in November 2016. However, there has been criticism of the project, namely that its completion date of mid-2020s may make it obsolete; that it does not have a clear source for funding; and that it is a poor substitute for subway service. Previous proposal View of a Brooklyn Historic Railway Association PCC streetcar that was to be placed on a proposed, but never used, streetcar line Since electric trolleys in Brooklyn stopped running in 1956, activists led by the Brooklyn Historic Railway Association (BHRA) had been trying to revive streetcars. In the 1990s, the BHRA received permission from New York City's government to develop a streetcar line running from Beard Street to Borough Hall. The association's president Robert Diamond collected disused PCC streetcars that had been used in Boston and Buffalo for potential use on the new line. By 1999, the group had begun laying new track for the project in Red Hook. However, in 2003, transportation officials elected to revoke Diamond's rights to the route's right-of-way. Instead, officials intended to sell the rights to the highest bidder in the event that the project ever moved forward. Diamond's efforts to secure independent funding were not successful. In 2005, U.S. Representative Nydia Vel√°zquez helped obtain a $300,000 federal grant for a six-month streetcar study. Although the BHRA had estimated $10‚Äì$15 million would be required to complete the project, the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) streetcar feasibility study (completed in April 2011) concluded that the line would cost $176 million in capital funding, plus an additional $6.2 to $7.2 million in annual operating funds. A significant portion of the capital cost would be required to make modifications to Red Hook's narrow streets in order to allow streetcars to make right turns. The study concluded that, due to a number of factors such as high costs, low ridership, and physical constraints like narrow streets, a streetcar line would not be an appropriate transit solution for the area. By June 2013, Diamond had partnered with John Quadrozzi of Gowanus Bay Terminal (a concrete firm), and the Gowanus Canal Community Development Corporation in an effort to revive the project, which he now envisioned running partly underground through the Cobble Hill Tunnel, a former Long Island Rail Road tunnel under Atlantic Avenue. Diamond pursued federal funding in order to pay for the project, which he estimated would cost $50 million. Connector proposal = Initial study = The current line was initially proposed by a non-profit group, Friends of the Brooklyn Queens Connector, which commissioned a study to examine the corridor along the Brooklyn and Queens waterfront. First publicly reported on in January 2016, the study proposed a route between the neighborhoods of Astoria in Queens and Sunset Park in Brooklyn, passing through several neighborhoods on the way. News media reported that the study had estimated construction costs of $1.7 billion, annual operating costs of $26 million, and 15.8 million annual riders by 2035. The proposal included a branch going through Downtown Brooklyn to the Atlantic Avenue‚ÄìBarclays Center station. The study described a routing that would begin in Queens near the New York City Housing Authority's Astoria Houses. It would run down 21st Street south to Queensboro Plaza, west onto 11th Street to Newtown Creek. The streetcar would cross Newtown Creek into Greenpoint, then pass through Williamsburg and the Brooklyn Navy Yard using one-way streets close to the waterfront. It would turn onto Park Avenue, run to Navy Street, then through Farragut Houses, Vinegar Hill, and Dumbo. The line would then run south through Red Hook, cross the Gowanus Canal, and continue south on Third Avenue to 58th Street, where it would turn west to serve the Brooklyn Army Terminal and Industry City. From there, the line would turn east, terminating at the 59th Street subway station in Sunset Park. Schwartz's firm worked on the proposal for over a year and considered five options aside from streetcars. One other option, Select Bus Service, was estimated to cost $1 billion to implement, and was not chosen since it would not raise property values as a streetcar would. The engineers projected 52,000 to 53,000 riders per day on the streetcar, which would have required a bus every minute. Each street car would be able to carry 150 to 175 passengers. Additionally, buses would also have a harder time navigating the 12 to 15 streets along the route. The engineers' route would have its own dedicated lanes for the whole route. The study recommended that two facilities for maintenance and storage would be built at a cost of $100 million. In addition, the streetcar would need at least 140 employees to operate the streetcars and a host of other workers, including traffic enforcement agents. = Mayoral endorsement = Long Island City, one of the areas that would be served by the new streetcar On February 3, 2016, the office of Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the city would begin planning work for the streetcar line, with a formal announcement by de Blasio at his State of the City speech the following day. The BQX was promised as a way to reinvent the city's transit system, along with the Citywide Ferry Service (now NYC Ferry) proposal. City officials said that several years of additional study and review would precede groundbreaking, planned for 2019, with service beginning around 2024. Since the line would be a street-level project, the streetcar would not need state approval. The city will rely on increased real estate revenues to pay for the project. Mayor de Blasio's office commissioned a study toward researching the projected effects of the streetcar. Under the slightly revised plan released by the city, the route would travel with 30 wheelchair- accessible stops, with an increased construction cost of $2.5 billion. There would be sixty vehicles, costing $5 million total, that would travel at , and would be separated from vehicular traffic for 70% of the route. Two bridges over the Newtown Creek and the Gowanus Canal were proposed, in the case that the Pulaski Bridge over the Newtown Creek, and the Hamilton Avenue bridge over the Gowanus Canal, aren't able to accommodate the vehicles; the Newtown Creek bridge will probably be located at Vernon Boulevard, where another bridge previously existed. A trip between Dumbo and Greenpoint would take 27 minutes via the line. The fare for the route would equal the fare of the subway and the buses. The line is planned to use multi-section vehicles to negotiate sharp curves at Lorraine Street, Cadman Plaza, 21st Street, and Astoria Boulevard. Streetcars, rather than light rail vehicles (LRVs), are proposed to be used, despite the fact that LRVs have more capacity and shorter headways; this is because streetcars were determined to operate better within mixed-use rights-of-way, as opposed to LRVs, which were determined to operate better within dedicated rights-of-way. Electrification is proposed to be from hydrogen fuel cells within the streetcars themselves, as opposed to from overhead lines or from embedded rails. Since the BQX would operate on both dedicated rights-of-way and on streets, the BQX would use both standard traffic lights and dedicated signals during operation. Annual operating costs are estimated at $26 million. The new line would provide a new transit route for 45,000 public-housing residents. An additional motivation for the line has been the tremendous growth in Brooklyn and Queens waterfront areas since the early 2000s. = Development = In May 2016, Friends of the Brooklyn Queens Connector appointed its first executive director, Ya-Ting Liu, to oversee route operations and design. Two months later, mayor De Blasio appointed Adam Giambrone, former councilor in Toronto and chair of the Toronto Transit Commission, to serve as a consultant or \\"streetcar czar\\" for the project. On November 1, 2016, the city presented a list of possible routings of the BQX through several neighborhoods. The study found that four New York City Subway stations along the BQX's route‚Äîat Jay Street‚ÄìMetroTech, Borough Hall, Court Square‚Äì23rd Street, and Vernon Boulevard‚Äîhad high weekday ridership, and thus, would benefit from a BQX transfer. The city, citing the successes of other American cities' streetcar systems, estimated that the project will pay for itself by increasing the property values in the neighborhoods around it in a form of transit-oriented development, similar to how the 7 Subway Extension was built. It is expected to create 86,000 jobs through 2045. In November 2017, Friends of the Brooklyn Queens Connector revealed a mockup of a vehicle that might be used on the BQX. The $100,000 prototype, a Citadis low-floor streetcar created by Alstom, was displayed at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. However, there was insufficient funding to start construction. Internal memos from the city around this time suggested that the project was endangered due to an ongoing dispute between Mayor de Blasio and New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo, since the state government owned some of the land that the BQX was to pass through. Shortly afterward, Liu stepped down from the director's position of Friends of the Brooklyn Queens Connector, to be replaced by Deputy Director Jessica Schumer, the daughter of U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer. By April 2018, there was still insufficient funding, and de Blasio announced that the city would ask for federal aid for the BQX, despite the city's previous assurances to completely self-fund the project. Moreover, the streetcar project was already behind schedule: major design work had been slated to start that year, but the public approvals process that preceded it had not started. Officials predicted that even if the BQX were to be fully funded, construction would not start until at least 2020. Additionally, if the BQX's construction were to proceed, the project would interfere with the renovation of the Brooklyn Heights Promenade section of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, which would occur during roughly the same time frame. The BQX's proposed route between Red Hook and Sunset Park was eliminated in August 2018, and a routing through Dumbo was shelved in favor of a more direct routing through Downtown Brooklyn. The route was thereby shortened from a alignment with 30 stops to an alignment with 26 stops. This was supposedly because of cost constraints, since it was projected that the stops in Sunset Park and Dumbo would not have enough ridership to justify building the streetcar there. However, the shortened route was estimated to be more expensive than the original proposed route to Sunset Park. The new route would cost $2.73 billion, versus the original proposal, which would have cost $2.5 billion. The proposed completion date for the BQX was also postponed to 2029. The NYCEDC announced in February 2019 that it had awarded a contract to create an environmental impact statement for the BQX. The report would be written by the firm Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, Inc., which would publish a final statement by 2020. Afterward, the city would perform a comprehensive uniform land use zoning plan (ULURP) for the areas along the BQX. Due to the length of the ULURP process, construction would not begin until at least 2024. In September 2020, de Blasio deferred decisions on the BQX to after the 2021 New York City mayoral election; de Blasio was term- limited and unable to run for reelection, which meant further action on BQX would be taken by the next mayoral administration. The city had experienced financial shortfalls that year because of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, making it unfeasible for de Blasio's administration to commence the project before the end of his term in 2022.  Route  As proposed in November 2016, the northern end of the route would probably be at Hoyt Avenue or along 27th Avenue, with the BQX using either 31st Street (under the Astoria subway line, carrying the ), Vernon Boulevard, 21st Street, or Crescent Street to go south to Long Island City. From there, the BQX would use 44th Drive and then cross the Newtown Creek using one of three bridges (a new bridge at either 2nd Street or Vernon Boulevard, or the existing Pulaski Bridge). These options would then travel down either Franklin Street, Manhattan Avenue (over the Crosstown subway line), or McGuinness Boulevard, respectively. 250x250px In southern Greenpoint, the Franklin Street routing would use either Kent Avenue or Berry Street (using Banker Street). The other two options could go down Wythe Avenue, Berry Street, or Bedford Avenue, via Nassau Avenue or Norman Street. The four options would merge into two (Kent Avenue and Wythe Avenue) south of Division Avenue in Williamsburg. South of the neighborhood, all of the options would then cut through the Brooklyn Navy Yard using Assembly Street. At Clinton Avenue, the BQX would have three options to the west to access Downtown Brooklyn, Dumbo, or Brooklyn Heights. The BQX could use Market Street and Eighth Street; Flushing Avenue; or Park Avenue. The Eighth Street option would merge onto Flushing Avenue at Cumberland Street in Fort Greene. At Navy Street, the two routings had three options: go to Dumbo using Gold Street, Front/York Streets, and Cadman Plaza East; go to Downtown Brooklyn using Navy Street, Ashland Place, Willoughby Place, and Joralemon Street; or use Tillary Street to access Brooklyn Heights. At Joralemon and Court Streets, all of the options would turn south down Court Street and then west along Atlantic Avenue. The Dumbo option was ruled out in August 2018. In Cobble Hill, the route could go in one of three directions. It could continue to the west end of Atlantic Avenue and then southward down Columbia Street, serving the Columbia Street Waterfront District; serve the residential section of Cobble Hill via Henry, Congress, and Columbia Streets; or turn down Hicks Street. The two Columbia Street options would need to go around the Brooklyn‚ÄìBattery Tunnel toll plaza, while the Hicks Street option would use Sackett and Union Streets to use Van Brunt and Richards Streets, thus bypassing this detour. South of the Brooklyn‚ÄìBattery Tunnel toll plaza, the Van Brunt/Richards Streets option would travel down to the streets' south end to Beard Street and turn eastward there, while the Columbia Street option could go down to either Mill or Bay Streets, then travel eastward at one of these two streets. The Mill Street option would go across the Gowanus Canal using 10th Street, while the Bay Street option further south could either use the existing 10th Street bridge or a new 19th Street bridge to cross the canal. The BQX's southernmost leg was canceled in August 2018. As originally planned, it would have traveled down Third Avenue underneath the Gowanus Expressway. This would be parallel to the Fourth Avenue subway line, one block east under Fourth Avenue. Between either 10th or 19th Street (depending on which bridge option was chosen) and 39th Street, the BQX would have run along Third Avenue. From 39th Street to 58th Street, the BQX could have swung west to 39th Street to serve Industry City, the Brooklyn Army Terminal, and the industrial center of Sunset Park; or it could have kept running along Third Avenue and serve residents of western Sunset Park. The BQX would have ended at Third Avenue and 59th Street, a block from the entrance to the 59th Street subway station.  Criticism  The Brooklyn‚ÄìQueens Connector has received criticism in regards to its operation and cost. Several complaints are that while it is planned to connect to 17 subway stations, it would be far from the BMT Canarsie Line () at Bedford Avenue. The line would also not go near the BMT Jamaica Line () at Marcy Avenue. Much of the areas that the new streetcar would serve are all from the IND Crosstown Line (), while areas in Eastern Queens and parts of Brooklyn do not have nearby subway lines. Since the project would be constructed and run by New York City and not the MTA, it is not known how it would integrate to the MTA's fare system, if at all. Public officials on Staten Island, including Staten Island Borough President James Oddo, did not oppose the plan, but they have stated that they felt under- represented after previous plans in Staten Island, including light rail along the island's North and West Shores, were rejected. The line was also criticized by public officials in South Brooklyn, who stated that their areas had their express bus service cut, their subway stations lacked elevators, their neighborhoods were under-served by public transit in general, and their requests for express F subway service and more reliable R train service had not yet been heeded. The proposal has also received criticism as it was viewed as a government subsidy to property developers. In addition, the BQX runs through several \\"100-year flood zones\\", meaning that the line would be prone to flooding during heavy storms and hurricanes. Steven Strauss, a Princeton University professor, expressed his reservations about the BQX in a New York Daily News editorial in May 2016. In the article, he stated that he was concerned that by the time the project is completed, it will be potentially obsolete due to the development of autonomous vehicles. Further, he thought the estimated cost of $10 per person per ride might be uneconomic compared to other alternatives. Instead, Strauss recommended that the city engage in a wider Request for Expressions of Interest Process to look at other potential alternatives. In February 2017, the Village Voice examined the BQX project's cost and found that the city had only tenuous sources of funding for the project. The Voice study found that the neighborhoods along the proposed BQX pay a combined $1 billion annually in residential taxes, with the tax revenue having increased 17% since 2015. However, to pay for the BQX, the streetcar alone would need to raise tax by another 17%, or else the city would need to resort to financing the streetcar out of its own budget. In addition, there would be less benefit in building in already-gentrified neighborhoods than in neighborhoods that are gentrifying or being redeveloped. The streetcar's feasibility study estimated that property values would go up even without the streetcar.

Function microRNAs (miRNAs) are short (20-24 nt) non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in multicellular organisms by affecting both the stability and translation of mRNAs. miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as part of capped and polyadenylated primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that can be either protein- coding or non-coding. The primary transcript is cleaved by the Drosha ribonuclease III enzyme to produce an approximately 70-nt stem-loop precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is further cleaved by the cytoplasmic Dicer ribonuclease to generate the mature miRNA and antisense miRNA star (miRNA*) products. The mature miRNA is incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the miRNA and most commonly results in translational inhibition or destabilization of the target mRNA.

He resigns and takes his wife and two-year-old son to a farm he has bought. On the way, his wife dies in an accident. His son receives a good education on the east coast and studies law. After his exam Tom returns to his father for a short time. One day Noble is asked by his old friend Marshall Crawford for help in the pursuit of the gang led by John Stillwell, who escaped from the Yuma penitentiary. The bandits murder some people and kidnap two women, a twelve-year-old girl and an Indian. Tom wants to join the persecution. His father is against it, because he is convinced that his son is not up to the strains of the persecution. However, Tom prevails. Noble, his son and the marshal pursue the gang, on which a reward of 500 $ is exposed. They meet a group of bounty hunters who are deserted soldiers. During a sandstorm, the three seek cover behind rocks as best they can. Stillwell and his gang find shelter in a Pueblo (Indian village built into a rock). Because Noble knows that the bandits want to cross the river with the only ferry, they take a tiring shortcut. At the ferry, the bounty hunters get in their way. In the shooting, Stillwell kills the marshal. Again and again there are conflicts between father and son. The father still lives in an atavistic world, in which life kills by the rule, so that you are not killed dominated. The son has a human behavior shaped by the civilized East Coast. Noble and Tom set another trap for the gang. Noble kills all gang members. Tom has been waiting for Stillwell. He has put his rifle on him and hesitates for a moment. Stillwell takes the girl to his horse. Tom can't shoot anymore. Noble and Tom meet as arranged with Indians, who bring them fresh horses and supplies. The older sister and the father of the girl are also at this meeting point. Noble wants to free the girl alone and follows the trail. Tom suddenly knows where Stillwell will hide. It can only be the Pueblo. He rides straight there. His father frees the girl and captures Stillwell. Stillwell distracts him with a trick and shoots him in the stomach with a hidden Derringer. Stillwell takes the girl on his horse and rides towards Utah. Tom arrives a short time later. His father tells him that he is mortally wounded. Tom promises to free the girl. He poses Stillwell, who surrenders. When Stillwell tries to outsmart him with the same trick, Tom shoots him. When Tom returns to his father, he dies shortly afterwards. The final picture shows Tom inviting his father's coffin into a train. The two sisters are also on the platform. He promises his older sister, with whom he grew up in his youth, to visit her in a few months.

Teaching and writing career From 1988 to 1992, Andreas taught at a rural school in northern Namibia. In 2001, she published The Purple Violet of Oshaantu which was inspired in part by her experiences there. The novel explores the status of women in traditional Namibian society. When the book was published as part of the African Writers Series by publishers Heinemann; the first Namibian author to have a work included. The work gained her international attention, being one of the first post-independence novels published following the South African occupation. She explained that at the time, the writing culture was not well established in Namibia, describing the work as \\"lonely\\". At the time of publishing her first novel, she was 37 years old. Andreas was working as a programme officer for the Forum for African Women Educationalists at the time of her death at the age of 46. The organisation seeks to educate women and girls.

History Cassa di Risparmio di San Miniato was found on 27 April 1830 in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, a year after the savings bank of Florence, the oldest savings bank in Tuscany region. On 14 January 1886, the savings bank was gained an independent status by a royal decree (part away from Florence). Due to Legge Amato, the bank was split into a company limited by shares (societ√† per azioni) and a banking foundation (Ente Cassa di Risparmio di San Miniato, later renamed to Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di San Miniato) on 13 April 1992 (gazetted on 14 May). The bank immediately sold about 70% shares of the bank to Holding Casse Toscane (literally Tuscan Savings Banks), a new intermediate holding company for the savings bank () of San Miniato, Florence, Livorno, Lucca, Pisa, Pistoia‚ÄìPescia, and Banca del Monte di Lucca. The ente received about 12% shares of Casse Toscane in return, making the ente had a minority interests in other banks, but only hold about 30% shares of their own bank directly or about 38.4% combined.

Vestergade begins in the Indre By neighborhood and ends in neighborhood of Vesterbro, close to CeresByen. Vestergade has some of the best preserved 18th-century merchant estates in Aarhus and a history of creativity and artistic expression. Vestergade was the original road leading to Viborg in the old Viking Age settlement. The buildings along Vestergade were the first outside the western defensive ramparts and formed the first civilian settlement. Originally, the street ended at Gr√∏nnegade but has since been lengthened as the city grew around it. Vestergade represents most periods in the history of Aarhus.  History  The early Viking Age settlement is thought to have been a military fortress and port. In the 900s, a settlement gradually developed outside the ramparts by the western gate. The new settlement housed traders, craftsmen, farmers and others that made a living dealing with the military base but were not permitted within it. In the settlement, a wooden church was constructed on the site of present-day Church of Our Lady. Vestergade is the street that led from the western gate of the fortress through the settlement by the church. In the 11th century, Aarhus had become the seat of a diocese and the wooden church was replaced by a new whitewashed travertine church devoted to St. Nicholas; officially the cathedral of the diocese. Vestergade became the trade and ecclesiastical center while the fortress remained the domain of the king and military. However, by the late 11th century the power of the church had grown and the King and Catholic Church worked more closely together. The fortress was opened for civilian use and a new cathedral was constructed within it. The St. Nicholas church was subsequently given to the Dominican Order which built a convent around it and eventually tore the church itself down. Until the Reformation, the convent in Vestergade was home to the Dominicans and their beggar monks. Vestergade no. 58 from 1761 is a four-winged timber framed merchant estate. Vestergade's low housing (1865) in the growing city of the industrial age Vestergade in 1884 seen from Lille Torv Vestergade street party is held every summer The end of the Middle Ages saw the rising importance of trade and crafts. The merchant became a more powerful figure, acting as the middleman between farmers and the city. The new merchant class built expansive houses with stables and storage space on the streets leading to the city gates in a bid to be the first to trade with farmers. Vestergade had most of these, seventeen in all, followed by Mejlgade which had sixteen by the northern city gate. The best preserved example is the listed no. 58, comprising four half- timbered wings. In 1529, the Dominicans abandoned their convent in Vestergade as the Reformation had made the people less favorable to their to cause. In 1533, a civil war broke out and in 1536 the Lutheran Christian III emerged victorious. Church, convent and diocesan properties were confiscated by the crown. In the short term this meant a complete restructuring of the economy since the vast lands owned by the church had resulted in wealth being concentrated in the cathedral in the city. During the following 200 years, the merchant fleet expanded and trade continued to grow. The merchant estates typically had small homes for rent behind it where craftsmen would rent and operate the first small factories. Vestergade and Skolegade were also rife with legal and illegal bars making Vestergade a lively place. By 1733, Aarhus had the largest merchant fleet in the country and the economy was thriving. In the early 1800s, the Danish state default and the loss of Norway hampered trade and the merchant fleet shrank. In the 1850s, political reforms broke the merchant monopolies the economy rebounded. Industrialization began and several factories were built in the city and Vestergade. Otto M√∏nsted established a margarine factory on Vestergade no. 11 and a tobacco factory opened in Vestergade no. 29. Vestergade, formerly dominated by merchants and nightlife, became dominated by industrial production. The Great Depression hit the city hard and many of the small workshops were converted to speakeasys. In the 1930s, Vestergade became a center for moonshine, prostitution and gambling. During the occupation by Germany in the Second World War, the assortment was further expanded to include the black market. In the 1950s, the city center was subjected to the first organized city planning efforts. The eastern section of Vestergade was demolished along with the entirety of Nygade. The old mayor's mansion on Lille Torv was moved to the Old Town Museum where it stands today. The modern buildings that replaced the old create a stark contrast to the old section of Vestergade. In the 1960s, the educational institutions expanded and Aarhus became dominated by students and their teachers. Vestergade became a center for culture with several jazz clubs, galleries and musical instrument stores. Vestergade no. 58 became a music venue and a small theatre frequented by among others Jens Okking, Gnags, Thomas Helmig, Henning St√¶rk and Anne Linnet. In Vestergade no. 38 a small theatre was established; it later became Svalegangen and moved to Rosensgade 11. In the 2010s, Vestergade is no longer the center for music it used to be but art is still represented with Aarhus Art Academy, galleries and handicrafts. It has become a popular street for bars, caf√©s and restaurants.  Notable buildings  There are four listed properties in Vestergade and one with address on Lille Torv, on the corner of Vestergade. Vestergade no. 1 is a small merchant's house from 1540 consisting of a brick building facing the street and two half-timbered buildings behind it with a diminutive courtyard between them. It is the oldest listed house in Aarhus and may be the oldest residential building. Vestergade 1 was listed in 1919. Vestergade 58 is a large half-timbered merchants house from 1761 consisting of six individual structures, listed in 1950. Vestergade 11, also known as M√∏nsted's House, was Otto M√∏nsted's factory site in the 1800s and was listed in 1950. Vestergade 29, which today houses Aarhus Art Academy, is a house in historicst style which was listed in 1924. The Business- and Agricultural Bank of Jutland building is situated on the corner of Lille Torv and Vestergade. It is an Italian Renaissance-style building from 1899 which previously housed a bank.

It is usually treated as part of the Pontic‚ÄìCaspian steppe which includes the area north of the Black and Caspian Seas, but there is some reason to treat it as a distinct place. Its natural boundaries are the Sea of Azov and Black Sea on the west, the Caucasus Mountains on the south and the Caspian Sea on the east. Its northern boundary may be taken as the triangle formed by the lower Don River and Volga River which are about 60 km apart to the west of Volgograd. This article excludes the north slope of the Caucasus which is not steppe and has a distinct geography and history. Geography Administratively it comprises (clockwise) the Astrakhan Oblast along the Volga, Kalmykia (west of Astrakhan oblast and reaching the Caspian in the south of the Volga), Northern Dagestan, the Stavropol Krai in the center-south, Krasnodar Krai in the west with its inclave of Adygea, southern Rostov Oblast in the northwest and the southern Volgograd Oblast in the north-center. The largest towns are Rostov-on-Don, Volgograd and Astrakhan in the north and Krasnodar and Stavropol in the south. Main roads are Rostov southeast to Stavropol and beyond, Volgograd south to Stavropol, and Astrakhan south to Dagestan. There are railroads approximately parallel to both coasts. The region is about 900 km at its widest and about 500 km from north to south. Low rainfall makes the whole area grassland. Rainfall decreases to the east and north (20-30 inches in the west, 13 in Volgograd and 9 in Astrakhan). Most of the area is less than 500 feet in altitude, rising to over 1000 feet in the Stavropol Highland. The Manych Depression is not much more than 65 feet above sea level and the area around Astrakhan and part of Kalmykia is below sea level. Relief Map Note Tsimylansk Reservoir on the lower Don (center), Volga-Don watershed, Stavropol Highland and eastern area below sea level Manych River and Manych Depression from space Upper left is the eastern tip of the Sea of Azov and lower right is the Caspian Sea Rivers: Through the center runs the northwest-tending Kuma-Manych Depression. This was once a strait connecting the Black and Caspian Seas and is now marked by the Manych River which is basically a chain of lakes. It will probably be the route of the Eurasia Canal if that great engineering work is ever built. In the south the rivers that flow north from the Caucasus are caught by the west-flowing Kuban River and the east-flowing Terek River. Between these the rivers are caught by the Malka River which is an east- flowing tributary of the Terek. In the west, since the Caucasus Mountains run parallel and close to the Black Sea coast, no significant rivers from this area reach the Black Sea. The western point is the Taman Peninsula. North of the Taman Peninsula the Kuban River, the Beysug River and the Yeya Rivers reach the Sea of Azov, and the long Manych River and the shorter Sal River reach the lower Don. In the north much of the lower Don is under the Tsimlyansk Reservoir and the Volga has a broad flood plain and a large delta. North of the Manych Depression the low Ergeni Highland forms the watershed between the Don and Volga. It drops off quickly to the Caspian Depression. To the east of this the Sarpinsky Lakes are a chain of lakes in Kalmykia that would be a north-flowing river if there were more rainfall. On the east the only important rivers that reach the Caspian are the Volga, Kuma River and the Terek. In the center the Yegorlyk River and Kalaus River flow north to the Manych and the Kuma River flows northeast to the Caspian. In the east there are many shallow lakes. Since the land is flat and the rainfall barely sufficient for agriculture there are important irrigation canals, most leading from the Caucasus peidmont to the Manych Depression. The Great Stavropol Canal leads northeast from the Kuban to the Kalaus and beyond and the Nevinnomyssk Canal runs from the Kuban to the Egorlyk. The Kuma-Manych Canal feeds water from the Kuma to the East Manych and Chyornozemsky Canal irrigates the interior of Kalmykia. There numerous canals around the lower Terek. History From about 700 BC the dominant peoples on the western steppe were the Scythians, Sarmatians and then Alans. Turkic-speakers arrived about 600 AD and gradually replaced the original Iranian languages. The Mongols took over about 1240 and their western lands became the Golden Horde which about 1500 broke up and became the Nogai Horde. In the nineteenth century the Nogai nomads were pushed southeast and the area populated by Russian agriculturists. Horse-based Pastoral nomadism appeared in this area some time between 4000 and 1000 BC. There is not enough data to be more specific. It is thought that the Northwest Caucasian languages are related to the ancient Hattite language and the Northeast Caucasian languages are related to Hurrian and Urartian. This implies that the mountaineers of the Caucasus have been in their present location for a very long time. According to the most common theory the Indo- European languages originated on the steppes north of the Caucasus and Black Sea. Some time before 3000 BC the Maikop culture appeared in Circassia and Kabardia. It is noted for its excellent gold and silver work. North on the steppe was the Yamnaya culture which was probably Indo-European. Around 1000 BC there was a bronze-age Koban culture in the Kabardian area which may have been proto-Chechen. Iron appeared in the eighth century BC. The small western area around the Taman peninsula had a distinct history since it was in contact with the literate civilizations of the Mediterranean basin. From the eighth century Greeks founded colonies around the Black Sea and we begin to have written reports. Maeotians was the Greek name for the peoples around the Sea of Azov. The Hellenized Sindi people appeared with a possible capital or seaport at Anapa. Both were perhaps ancestors of the Circassians. The Greek colonies exported grain and slaves to Byzantium and beyond ‚Äì a system that continued until the Russian conquest. They formed a state called the Bosporian Kingdom which lasted in various forms until Roman times. The Byzantines spread Christianity into the mountains. Around 1000 AD the Rus‚Äô held Tmutarakan on the Taman peninsula. At this time we hear of Kassogs who were probably ancestral Circassians. As Byzantium declined the ports were taken over by the Genoese who held them until they were captured by the Turks around 1480. The Turks spread Islam producing a mountain religion that was basically Islamic but with many Christian and pagan survivals. In the east Persian power held mountain Dagestan but did not reach the steppes.

Cuman‚ÄìKipchak confederation in Eurasia circa 1200 The boundary of 13th century Mongol Empire and location of today's Mongols in modern Mongolia, Russia and China. Steppe: Since the Don and Volga are not significant barriers the history of most of this area is part of the general history of the Pontic-Caspian steppe. Since this area is far from the centers of literate civilization it is hard to know the details of what happened. Variations in dates below represent early ancestors, late survivals and other irregularities. The pre-Scythian inhabitants of the steppe may have been Cimmerians who may have been a Thracians-Iranian mix with an Iranian elite. From around the ninth century BC the nomads of the western steppe are described as Scythians (800 BC ‚Äì 100 BC). They spoke an Iranian language and may have been the first to develop horse nomadism. Herodotus said that Scythians drove the Cimmerians from north of the Caucasus into Anatolia (about 700 BC), but this has been questioned. From around the second century BC the Sarmatians (c. 500 BC ‚Äì 400 AD?) replaced the closely related Scythians, either as an ethnonym or ruling group. The Siraces (300 BC ‚Äì 200 AD) were a group of Hellenized Sarmatians who lived along the Kuban. To their east and north were the Aorsi (100 BC ‚Äì 100 AD), also a Sarmatian group. In the first and second centuries AD the Alans (100 AD ‚Äì 1239) came from the east and took over from the Sarmatians. Since the Sythians, Sarmatians and Alans spoke similar languages the names may represent different dominant groups ruling similar people. From about 370 AD the Huns (376-469) overthrew the Alans, but many Alans continued to live in the area and later re-emerged. As a result of the Hun attack many Alans moved west and joined the Huns and Goths in attacking the Roman Empire. Around 600 AD the Western Turkic Kaganate took over the lower Volga ‚Äì perhaps the first appearance of Turkic languages in this area. The obscure Sabir people (c. 460 ‚Äì 700s), who may have been Turkic, lived near the Caspian. After 630 the Khazars (c. 630 ‚Äì 969), who had a Turkic-speaking ruling class, formed a state mainly on the lower Volga which lasted until it was destroyed by the Rus‚Äô about 969. Around 635 the Turkic Bulgars (c. 480‚Äì1014) were established west of the Khazars. The Alans re- formed a state (c. 700 ‚Äì 1240) in Kabardia which was Christianized by the Byzantines. The rise of Islam led to the Arab-Khazar Wars (642-737) and in 737 Arabs briefly reached the lower Volga. The Pechenegs (c. 800 ‚Äì 1100) moved from north of the Caspian into this area perhaps around 850. They pushed or were pushed westward and were eventually broken up in wars with the Byzantines. Behind them came the Cumans ‚Äì Kipchaks (?-1241), two peoples that are hard to distinguish. Like the Pechenegs they continued west and fought the Rus‚Äô and Byzantines. The appearance of the Kipchaks may mark the final establishment of Turkic languages north of the Black Sea. After the Mongols conquered the eastern side of the Caspian Subutai found himself in what is now Azerbaijan. In 1223 he crossed the Caucasus (via Derbent?), defeated the Cumans and nearly everyone else, defeated the Rus‚Äô near the Don and returned east. In 1236-1241 the Mongols conquered Russia and part of Eastern Europe, so they must have taken this area about this time. It was perhaps at this time that the Turkic Karachay and Balkars and the Iranian Ossets (Alans) left the steppe and sought refuge in the Caucasus mountains where they remain today. The Mongol Empire broke into four parts before 1300 and the western part became known as the Golden horde. The conquerors quickly adopted the Kipchak Turkish language of their subjects so that the Golden Horde was also called the Kipchak Khanate. They adopted Islam at some point, perhaps the 1250s or just before 1313. Nogai Khan and Tokhtamysh fought major battles on the Terek River. When the Golden Horde broke up about 1500 the steppe nomads came to be called the Nogai Horde. They were to some degree subjects of the Crimean Khanate which was in turn a semi-independent vassal of the Ottoman Empire. In 1557 the Nogais east of Azov broke off and formed the Lesser Nogai Horde, a name that gradually went out of use. Around 1630 the Kalmyks migrated west from Dzungaria and occupied the land around the north end of the Caspian Sea, driving the Nogais south and west. In 1771 a significant part of them returned to Dzungaria and the Nogais returned east and north. A few Russians were on the lower Terek by about 1520 and Cossacks were somewhere on the Don by 1550. In 1556 Russia took Astrakhan and interacted with Kabardia for a few years before losing interest in the area south of the Volga and Don. Russian peasant colonization of the steppe continued to expand southward toward the north of this area. Russia took and lost Azov several times before gaining it permanently in 1774. In 1783 Russia annexed Crimea and thereby took over the Crimeans‚Äô claim to rule the Nogais. Russian settlement began mainly on the North Caucasus Line along the Kuban and Terek Rivers between the mountains and steppe. This was used as a base for the conquest of the mountains. In 1792 Black Sea Cossacks (former Zaporozhians) were settled on the lower Kuban and the area between the Yeya and Kuban Rivers became the Black Sea Host Territory. In 1794 some Don Cossacks settled on the great bend of the Kuban. The Terek Cossacks were pushed west and became the Caucasus Line Cossack Host. In 1825 Volga Cossacks arrived in the center. Further north Cossack and peasant settlements were mixed. in the northeast the Kalmyks retained most of their land while the Nogais were pushed southeast to land south of the Kalmyks in what is now the Nogai Raion of Dagestan.

It is the most visited nature reserve in the Russian Federation, with over 200,000 recorded in 2010. Included in the reserve are a popular tourist complex (\\"Dombay\\") and resorts in the surrounding areas. The terrain show extremes in variation: 31.7% forests, 20% meadows, 8.5% glaciers, 38.4% rock and scree, 0.7% - water (there are 157 lakes and 109 glaciers). The reserve is divided into two sections - the Tebardinsky () to the east, and the Arkhyz () to the west. The two sections were connected in 2010 by a \\"biosphere polygon\\", the Caucasus State Nature Reserve. The two sectors are situated in the Karachayevsky District of the Karachay-Cherkess Republic. It is part of a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve. The reserve was created in 1936, and covers an area of . Topography The Teberda Reserve's southern border runs along the Main Caucasus ridge from the peak \\"Klukhori\\" to the peak \\"Herzog\\". The eastern section, Tebardinsky, covers the headwaters of the Tebarda River. The western section, Arkhyz, is the valley of the Kyzgych River. The altitude varies between 1,260 and 4,047 meters above sea level. The highest peaks in the area are Dombay-Ulgen (4042 m), Boo-Ulgen (3915 meters), Dzhalovchat (3870 meters), and Bela Kaya (3861 meters). The mountains were formed by tectonic forces, and the longitudinal valleys carved by two main periods of glaciation, one in the Jurassic, and the other the more recent. Mount Dombay There are 109 glaciers, with a total area of 74.3 km2, and extensive snowfields on the mountains. Feeding streams on steep slopes, the glaciers form powerful rapids and waterfalls. There are 157 lakes are concentrated on the territory, with a maximum depth of 30‚Äì50 meters, and most above an altitude of 2,000 meters. Climate and Ecoregion Teberda is located in the Caucasus mixed forests ecoregion. Located along the Caucasus Mountains between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. One of the highest levels of species endemism and diversity in the world: 23% of vascular species, and 10% of vertebrates. The climate of Teberda is Humid continental climate, cool summer (K√∂ppen climate classification (Dfc)). This climate is characterised by long cold winters, and short, cool summers. The average temperature in January is 2.9 C, and in July is +15.5 C. The average frost-free period is 126 days. Snow cover lasts from 21 to 122 days, an average of 73 days. As altitude increases, precipitation increases, and the temperature drops an average of 0.5 C per 100 meters of ascent. Flora and fauna Strong altitude zoning drives the plants in the reserve, with five levels (in ascending order): forest, sub-alpine (2,000 - 2,500 meters), alpine (2,500 - 3,000 meters), sub-nival, and nival (snow). The forest zone (34%) is dominated by pine, with an under story of juniper and rhododendron. The southern areas of the reserve are coniferous forest, and the lower floodplains of the Teberda River feature stands of alder. The alpine zones are alpine heath and meadow. There are 46 species of mammals living on the territory, with 1,300-1,600 of the Caucasian ibex, which have large saber horns reaching 1 meter in length on old males. Bison have been reintroduced into the area after being exterminated in 1926; the reserve's wild bison numbered 32 as of 2015. Recently, the jackal has penetrated the territory and is now the most common predator. There are three fishes in the streams of the reserve: brown trout, common minnow and European loach. Teberda is an important bird area, with 226 species recorded. The near-threatened Caucasian black grouse is a resident of the reserve, and endemic to the Caucasus.

It is a branch of \\"Enel Russia\\". Sredneuralskaya GRES History Sredneuralskaya GRES which has The Order of Lenin and The Order of the Red Banner of Labour, is situated at the Iset riverside. The first mention of the Srenderuralsk state region power plant was in \\"The plan of national economic construction of USSR\\" for the first five years. By the general \\"Plan of Ural electrification\\" the creation of \\"trunk feeder\\", which was based on 3 big region mains ‚Äì Southern (Chelyabinsk), Northern (Gubakhino) and Sredneuralsk ‚Äì was planned. The station partly supply with heat Yekaterinburg and its satellites. The main fuel is natural gas and the reserve fuel is mazut. On 31 August 1930 Energocenter decided to build Sredneuralskaya GRES, which had to cover ural energy deficit. In October 1930, specialists, planers, geodesists and geologs from Leningrad appeared on lakeside of Iset Lake. Building of the station was started in 1931, on 6th January 1963 the first turbo generator installed capacity of 50 MW on Sredneuralskaya GRES was put in operation. In 1937 the second turbine was launched and in 1939 the third turbo aggregate was put in exploitation. During the Great Patriotic War the staff of Sredneuralskaya GRES saw off a quarter of workers. SUGRES supplied with the energy \\"Uralvagonzavod\\" where one-third of all tanks, produced in USSR during the war, was constructed and also many other defense factories of Sverdlovsk region. On 1 April 1945 –≥. Sredneuralskaya GRES was awarded by The Order of Lenin. On 17 April 1945 the collective of power plant got for eternal storage The Red Standard of State Committee of Defense.5 —è–Ω–≤–∞—Ä—è 1936 –≥–æ–¥–∞ –±—ã–ª –∑–∞–ø—É—â–µ–Ω –ø–µ—Ä–≤—ã–π —Ç—É—Ä–±–æ–≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä –°—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–µ—É—Ä–∞–ª—å—Å–∫–æ–π –ì–†–≠–° –º–æ—â–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å—é 50 –ú–í—Ç By 1949 the building of the first line of GRES with 234 MW: 8 boilers and 5 turbo aggregates, was finished. During 1950-1953 on SUGRES for the first time in the state the complex automation of heating processes was realized. From 1962 the heat supply of two cities was started by 26 -km heat transport system SUGRES-Sverdlovsk that was unique in that period. From 1960 the building of the second line of SUGRES of 238 MW was started. That was the second born of the power plant. So, in 1960 powerful heating complex was come on stream on SUGRES, which provided Sverdlovsk, Verhnya Pishma and Sredneuralsk (with the total population more than one million people )with 1150 Gkal/hour of energy and 2000 tons of hot water per hour for the heat supply and hot water of. For improvement of Sverdlovsk heat supply by the end of 1966 the first line of electro station had been reconstructed: 3 turbines were transferred to heat supply and 2 boilers of 50 MW with 2 boilers of 200 tones/hour were demounted. Because of increasing demands of energy in the regional center, in 1964 the enlargement of SUGRES was started. In 1967‚Äì1970 the third line with 900 MW capacity ‚Äì 3 units of 300 MW ‚Äì was established. It included: turbines –ö-300-240 from Leningrad Metal Plant and boilers TGMP ‚Äì 114 with capacity of 900 tones per hour. In 1978 the power plant got the high rank of ¬´The factory of communist labour¬ª. In 1982 the first line of the power plant was transferred from carbon to natural gas, the reserve fuel ‚Äì mazut. In 1985 on SUGRES the complex of water preparation for replenishment of heating system with capacity of 6000 tons/hour was introduced. the water supply was operated through sluice from Volchihinskoe reservoir. Such filtering equipment had not been used previously in energy. By the decree of 29 April 1986 of the presidium of Supreme Council of USSR. BSUGRES was awarded by the Order of Labor Red Banner for high technical and economical work of energy equipment. More than once Sredneuralskaya GRES became the winner of social competitions. Totally there are 10 banners-relics on SUGRES, which were given to the collective for heroic work. In 1993 the reconstruction of energy unit with capacity 300 MW with its transition to heating regime was implemented. It was the first such experience in Russia.

Since 2011, the external audits were regularly carried out at the power plant and confirmed efficiency of internal processes management. In 2017, the company management resolved to carry out certification not only within the perimeter of Enel Russia PJSC, but also within the Global Thermal Generation of Enel S.r.L. In autumn 2017, the audit results confirmed the efficiency and controllability of processes of the integrated management system of occupational health (OHSAS 18001:2007), safety, environment (ISO 14001:2004) and quality (ISO 9001:2008).

Starting from 2013, upon the power plant‚Äôs initiative the Isetskoye water reservoir has been populated with over 286 thnd fish of valuable species.  Fish protection system  On 24 August 2017 a special committee accepted a new fish protection device into operation at the Isetkoye water reservoir; the device will protect fish fry from getting into the water intake area. The system was installed at onshore pumping station No.1 of Sredneuralskaya GRES (PJSC Enel Russia). Therefore, all water intakes at Sredneuralskaya GRES are equipped with the system protecting fish fry from being trapped and killed, thus ensuring reduction in the impact of the power plant cycle on the ichthyofauna of the water reservoir. The air-lift fish protection device will prevent at least 70 percent of fish fry (measuring 12mm and more) from getting into the power plant cycle. This effect is possible due to creation of an air bubble screen preventing the fish from getting trapped in water intake devices of Sredneuralskaya GRES. This is the third fish protection device at Sredneuralskaya GRES. In 2011 a polycontact pulse fish protection system was commissioned in the Isetkoye water reservoir water area near the water intake of the onshore pumping station of the CCGT unit. Thus, currently all water intake areas at Sredneuralskaya GRES are equipped with fish protection devices.  Noise-attenuating device  In 2018 the noise- attenuating equipment project for Sredneuralskaya GRES was completed. Late in 2017 power unit No.10 was equipped with 10 noise dampers. In 2018 power units No.9 and No.11 of Sredneuralskaya GRES were equipped with 12 noise dampers which allow minimising noise from outgoing HP steam. These devices are designed to reduce the noise load from steam emission into the atmosphere during power unit start-up and shut-down. Acoustic impact reduction is a pressing issue for Sredneuralskaya GRES because the residential area of Sredneuralsk is very close to the power plant. The situation was caused due to the fact that in 1930s, when the power plant was designed and built, there were no requirements to territorially separate residential premises and industrial facilities.  Interesting facts  * Late in 2017 SUGRES beat the record in thermal power generation ‚Äì 210M Gcal. Just imagine: the amount is enough to heat 62,000 schools for a year. * On 4 May 2018 the historic generation level was recorded at Sredneuralskaya GRES of PJSC Enel Russia. Since the first turbine generator commissioning (6 January 1936) the power plant has produced 400 billion kW*h of electric power. In other words, this amount of power is enough for 26 years in Yekaterinburg or 3 years in Moscow and Moscow region. Combined cycle gas turbine ‚Äì 410 CCGT Sredneuralskaya GRES Today Sredneuralskaya GRES is a subsidiary of \\"Enel Russia\\". There are also Reftinskaya GRES (Sverdlovsk region), Konakovskaya GRES (Tver region) and Nevinnomysskaya GRES (Stavropol region) in \\"Enel Russia\\". In September 2008, in compliance of the Directive of the Government of the Russian Federation ‚Ññ 215—Ä of 2008, Enel started construction of a new high-efficiency 410 MW combined cycle gas turbine. The construction of the turbine was completed in 2011.–ú–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç—Ä —ç–Ω–µ—Ä–≥–µ—Ç–∏–∫–∏ –†–§ –°.–ò. –®–º–∞—Ç–∫–æ: ¬´–ó–∞–ø—É—Å–∫ –Ω–æ–≤—ã—Ö —ç–Ω–µ—Ä–≥–æ–±–ª–æ–∫–æ–≤ –≤–Ω–µ—Å–µ—Ç —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –≤–∫–ª–∞–¥ –≤ –ø–æ–≤—ã—à–µ–Ω–∏–µ —ç–Ω–µ—Ä–≥–æ—ç—Ñ—Ñ–µ–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –∏ —É–∫—Ä–µ–ø–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞–¥–µ–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ —ç–Ω–µ—Ä–≥–æ—Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º—ã —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—ã¬ª Since CCGT commissioning in 2011, its operational performance has substantially improved.

He became a professed member of the Third Order of Saint Francis and was well known both for his trade and for his decision to remain in silence while living among the Franciscans. He became known for his charisma and for his care of both the poor and the ill and was honored as a saint during his lifetime by the people of Siena . He was beatified on 18 August 1802 after Pope Pius VII confirmed his \\"cultus\\" in Siena and in the surrounding cities. Life Pietro Pettinaio was born around 1189 in Campi, a village of Castelnuovo Berardenga near Siena and moved with his parents to Siena at some point during his childhood. He married but remained childless during his marriage and in order to provide for his new wife he worked as a comb-maker. He purchased a house in which vines flourished so as to make wine. Pettinaio later lost his wife and he lived alone in Siena while being able to devote more time to his trade. Pettinaio became a professed member of the Third Order of Saint Francis after serving as a nurse in a Franciscan-run hospital - Santa Maria della Scala - while continuing in his profession. He lived a simple life, giving excess wealth to the Franciscans and he spent his evenings in meditation and devoting such nights to God. He moved from his home (after selling it to the poor) to a cell among the Franciscans and there considered himself far too talkative, so worked towards living amongst them in silence. He undertook several pilgrimages to religious sites including Assisi, where Saint Francis worked and lived. During his lifetime he was hailed as a miracle worker and was considered to be a great saint. He became a sought after advisor to priests as well as to the people of Siena and was considered charismatic. He was so well-regarded to the point where in 1282 he was granted the chance to choose five prisoners to be pardoned. He saw as an advisor the Dominican orator Ambrose Sansedoni. Pettinaio died on 4 December 1289 at an advanced age and was buried at the Franciscan church in Siena. His grave soon became a pilgrimage site and the scene of miracles. A shrine was built over his grave in 1326 and an annual local feast in his honor was established in 1329. The shrine was lost to fire in 1655 and remaining relics were preserved when the Poor Clare nuns took them into their care. Dante Aligheri The poet Dante Aligheri is said to have included Pettinaio in his work (Divina Comedia) in \\"Canto XIII\\" through the character of Pier the Comb-Seller. Beatification The people adored Pettinaio as a saint and a patron and so established a local annual feast honoring him in 1329. It later led to calls for official recognition of sainthood and led to Pope Pius VII proclaiming his \\"cultus\\" acting as formal beatification on 18 August 1802 References External links *Saints SQPN Category:1189 births Category:1289 deaths Category:12th-century venerated Christians Category:12th-century Italian people Category:12th-century Roman Catholics Category:13th-century venerated Christians Category:13th-century Italian people Category:13th-century Roman Catholics Category:Italian beatified people Category:Italian Roman Catholics Category:People from Tuscany Category:Members of the Third Order of Saint Francis ","title":"Pietro Pettinaio"},{"id":"49319682","text":"The Sri Lanka Navy 50th Anniversary Medal (Sinhala: ‡∑Å‡∑ä‚Äç‡∂ª‡∑ì ‡∂Ω‡∂Ç‡∂ö‡∑è ‡∂±‡∑è‡∑Ä‡∑í‡∂ö ‡∑Ñ‡∂∏‡∑î‡∂Ø‡∑è 50‡∑Ä‡∂± ‡∑É‡∂Ç‡∑Ä‡∂≠‡∑ä‡∑É‡∂ª ‡∂¥‡∂Ø‡∂ö‡∑ä‡∂ö‡∂∏ ≈örƒ´ La·πÉkƒÅ nƒÅvika hamudƒÅ panasvana sangwathsara padakkama) was presented to all ranks of the regular and volunteer servicepersons of the Sri Lanka Navy provided they have completed a minimum of ten years in service at any time during the period of 9 December 1999 to 8 December 2000, the year of the 50th Anniversary of the Navy.

ESD may be done in the esophagus, stomach or colon. Application of endoscopic resection (ER) to gastrointestinal (GI) neoplasms is limited to lesions with no risk of nodal metastasis. Either polypectomy or endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is beneficial for patients because of its low level of invasiveness. However, to ensure the curative potential of these treatment modalities, accurate histopathologic assessment of the resected specimens is essential because the depth of invasion and lymphovascular infiltration of the tumor is associated with considerable risk for lymph node metastasis. For accurate assessment of the appropriateness of the therapy, en bloc resection is more desirable than piecemeal resection. For a reliable en bloc resection of GI neoplasms, a new method of ER called endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has been developed. Developmentt of ESD The ESD technique has developed from one of the EMR techniques, namely endoscopic resection after local injection of a solution of hypertonic saline-epinephrine (ERHSE). Initially, the ESD technique was called by various names such as cutting EMR, exfoliating EMR, EMR with circumferential incision etc. However, a new name was proposed to this technique in 2003, as a treatment positioned between EMR and laparoscopic surgery, since this technique is innovative and enables complete resection of neoplasms that were impossible to resect en bloc by EMR. At present, numerous electrosurgical knives such as insulation-tipped diathermic knife (IT-knife)‚Äì, needle knife, hook knife, flex knife‚Äì, triangle- tipped knife, flush knife, mucosectomy, splash needle and a special device called a small-caliber tip transparent (ST) hood are available for this technique. One or two of these electrosurgical knives are used in combination with a high frequency electrosurgical current (HFEC) generator with an automatically controlled system). New types of endoscopes are available for ESD, such as an endoscope with a water jet system, an endoscope with a multi- bending system to facilitate the ESD procedure‚Äì. As another approach to successful ESD, investigations of submucosal injection solutions have been actively done. It was reported that a hyaluronic acid solution makes a better long-lasting submucosal cushion without tissue damage than other available solutions,‚Äì. As a further improvement of hyaluronic acid solution, usefulness of a mixture of high-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid, glycerin, and sugar has also been reported,. ESD is characterized by three steps: injecting fluid into the submucosa to elevate the lesion from the muscle layer, circumferential cutting of the surrounding mucosa of the lesion, and subsequent dissection of the connective tissue of the submucosa beneath the lesion. The major advantages of this technique in comparison with polypectomy or EMR are as follows. The resected size and shape can be controlled, en bloc resection is possible even in a large neoplasm, and neoplasms with submucosal fibrosis are also resectable. So this technique can be applied to the resection of complex neoplasms such as large neoplasms, ulcerative non-lifting neoplasms, and recurrent neoplasms. The disadvantages of this technique are the requirement of two or more assistants, it is time-consuming, there is a higher risk of bleeding and perforation than EMR. In Japan, ESD is now gaining acceptance as the standard endoscopic resection technique for stomach neoplasms in an early stage, especially for large or ulcerative neoplasms. Recently, the ESD technique is applied to esophageal or colorectal neoplasms in some institutions, although it is still controversial considering the technical difficulty, associated risks, and favorable outcomes by EMR.

It is a 3D remake of the 1991 Game Boy game Final Fantasy Adventure, the first game in the Mana series. It was released worldwide for Android and iOS on February 4, 2016; a PlayStation Vita version was also released on the same date in Japan, and in June 2016 in North America, South America and Europe. In addition to these releases, Square Enix has said that they are considering developing versions for PlayStation 4 and personal computers. The player takes the role of a young hero who, together with a heroine, tries to stop the Dark Lord of Glaive from destroying the Tree of Mana. The gameplay focuses on combat with monsters or other enemies, and is seen from a top-down perspective. The player traverses the game world, which is divided into several areas, and makes their way through dungeons. While fighting monster characters, a gauge is shown on the screen filling up over time and resetting when the player gets hit or attacks; by waiting to attack until the gauge is full, the player can use a stronger attack. The player is accompanied by various non-player characters, who each have different skills the player can use, and who help them defeat enemies. The idea for the game came from the producer, Masaru Oyamada, who wanted all Mana games to be playable on modern platforms for the series' 25th anniversary in 2016. Initially there was some argument at Square Enix about whether the remake should be done in 2D or 3D; they chose 3D, as it was thought to be easier to control on smartphones and because it could be used as a base for potential future Mana remakes. The game has received positive reviews, with reviewers giving particular praise to the visuals and the music.  Content  The player character fights an enemy, early in the game. Adventures of Mana is an action role-playing game in which the player controls a young hero who, along with a heroine, tries to stop the Dark Lord of Glaive from destroying the Tree of Mana. The game is a 3D remake of the two-dimensional Game Boy game Final Fantasy Adventure, containing the same content. In the smartphone versions of the game, the player controls the hero by using a customizable virtual joystick and button set. The game is seen from a top-down perspective, and focuses on sword combat. The player moves the hero through the game world, which is divided into several areas; as the player enters one, enemy characters start to appear there. Among the areas in the game world, there are dungeons that the player needs to get through. These usually consist of a number of rooms divided across three to four floors; in order to navigate their way through a dungeon, the player needs to break walls, unlock doors, and sometimes press down buttons and break pots. In addition to the regular enemies, the player also needs to defeat several bosses and mini-bosses throughout the game. By defeating enemies, the player gains experience points, which make the hero's level increase; when this happens, the player gets points to spend on four different disciplines, each of which gives the hero access to different abilities and enhances different stats associated with the discipline: Warrior is associated with physical attacks, Monk with defense and health points, Mage with magic attacks and magic points, and Sage with an increase in the weapon limit gauge. Sometimes when enemies are defeated, they drop items; the player can carry items with them, which are grouped into stacks, each taking up one slot in the inventory. During battles, a weapon limit gauge is shown, filling up over time; by waiting to attack until the gauge is filled up, the player can use a more powerful attack specific to the currently equipped weapon. The gauge resets to zero whenever the player attacks or gets hit by an attack. The player is able to use various different types of weapons, such as swords, axes and flails, each having a different attack pattern: sword attacks, for example, are mid-ranged swings and stabs, while flail attacks are long-ranged and reach out in a straight line from the hero. Most weapons can also be used to affect the environment: the player can cut down trees with axes, for instance. There are also variants of each weapon type with bonus strengths, such as flame variations, which are effective against ice monsters. At various points in the game, the hero is accompanied by non-player characters who help the player defeat enemies. These companions have different abilities that the player can use, such as Fuji's healing spell and Watt's shop.  Development and release  Adventures of Mana is a remake of the 1991 Game Boy game Final Fantasy Adventure, which was the first entry in the Mana series. It is the second remake of Final Fantasy Adventure, the first being the Game Boy Advance game Sword of Mana, which had removed the connections to the Final Fantasy series in favor of being more connected to the rest of the Mana series. According to Adventures of Manas producer, Masaru Oyamada, the development team focused on not upsetting what had made the original game good, while adding things that had not been possible to do in the original version due to hardware limitations; they also aimed to make the game more comfortable and intuitive to play: for instance, switching armor and weapons and using items and magic was made easier, and shortcut commands were added. The game borrows some elements from the original Game Boy version, and some from Sword of Mana. For example, the first remake introduced the ability to play as the heroine, but Adventures of Mana, like the original, only has a male playable character; conversely Adventures of Manas battle system, user interface and sword attack are based on Sword of Manas rather than the original's. Kenji Ito, the composer for Final Fantasy Adventure, returned to create updated and more dramatic rearrangements for the remake. The idea to develop a remake came when Oyamada, due to the Mana series' 25th anniversary in 2016, thought about how he would like players to be able to play through the series in sequential order on modern game platforms. The platforms ‚Äì Android, iOS and PlayStation Vita ‚Äì were decided on from the beginning. Initially, there were some arguments at Square Enix about whether to create the game using 2D or 3D graphics; they settled on 3D, as Oyamada thought that 3D games are easier to control on smartphones. Additionally, the development team thought that a 3D version would be better, as it could be used as a base for potential remakes of other Mana games; depending on the reception of Adventures of Mana, Oyamada said that he would like to develop a remake of Trials of Mana, and would consider one of Secret of Mana depending on demand. The remake was developed by MCF. When the game was announced in September 2015, development was 50% complete; by late December, development was 90% complete. The game was released worldwide for Android and iOS on February 4, 2016; in Japan, a PlayStation Vita version was also released on the same date. Responding to feedback, Square Enix's European branch said that the game's development team was examining the possibility of a Western release of the PlayStation Vita version; the PlayStation Vita version was later released in North America, South America and Europe on June 28, 2016. Square Enix has also said that they are considering versions of the game for PlayStation 4 and personal computers.  Reception  Adventures of Mana has been positively received by critics. Shaun Musgrave at TouchArcade felt that the sparse story set-up and lack of \\"supervision or training\\", while likely to \\"rub some people the wrong way\\", was refreshing; he liked the simplicity and \\"efficiency\\" of the game, and said that, as a remake, he was unsure if he could be any happier with it than he was. TouchArcade named Adventures of Mana as their \\"Game of the Week\\", calling it a \\"truly wonderful remake\\". Nadia Oxford at USgamer said that the game was \\"a very decent re-construction of Final Fantasy Adventure\\" and less tedious than Sword of Mana. Jason Schreier of Kotaku thought that the game was excellent; like Oxford, he preferred it over Sword of Mana, which he said felt more like a new game than like a remake. Harry Slater at Pocket Gamer, Musgrave, and Schreier all commented on the price, considering it to be high. Oxford felt that the touch screen-based controls were not ideal for the fast pace of the gameplay. Schreier found the touch controls to be \\"just fine\\", but thought that the game would work better with a D-pad and buttons. He praised the presentation, saying that the music was \\"superb\\" and that the game looked great. Slater thought that the game's look was impressive and that the music was excellent. Musgrave called the music \\"outstanding\\", and found the monster characters to look fantastic, having benefited greatly from the updated 3D graphics; he was less sure about the art direction for the human characters, but still thought that they looked better than they did in Sword of Mana.

Later in life he moved to Omaha, Nebraska, where his son Daniel had settled. In Louisiana he served as a militiaman during the Reconstruction era and was involved in the Battle of Liberty Place. Later, he was a member of L'Union Louisianais and wrote for the weekly of the same name. He also wrote for the daily paper, the Crusader, and taught at the Couvent School in New Orleans. In 1890, he was among the founders of the Comit√© des Citoyens, which fought the 1890 Separate Car Act through legal challenges, leading to the US Supreme Court Case, Plessy vs Ferguson (1896). It rejected their challenge, ruling that \\"separate but equal\\" accommodations in public facilities were constitutional. He also wrote an important French- language history of Creoles in America called Nos Hommes et Notre Histoire, the first such book written in French by a member of the Louisiana Creoles of Color. Life Rodolphe Lucien Desdunes was born November 15, 1849 as one of at least five children of Pierre J√©r√©mie Desdunes and Henriette Ang√©lique (Sonty) Gaillard; siblings were Pierre Aristide, Joseph, Elmore, and Sarazin. Their father, Pierre, lived in New Orleans at least as early as 1840 and was probably born in the city. The Desdunes family had come from Saint-Domingue (now Haiti),Vernhettes, Dan and Hanley, Peter. \\"The Desdunes Family\\". The Jazz Archivist, Tulane University, XXVII, 2014, pages 25-45. Accessed February 3, 2016. and likely fled to New Orleans during the 1791 Haitian Revolution. They were free people of color. Rodolphe's education was likely provided by family and family friends Armand Lanusse and Joanni Questy, as well as at the Couvent School.Anthony Appiah, Henry Louis Gates. Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience, Oxford University Press, 2005 Rodolphe's brother Pierre Aristide also became involved in civil rights as an adult. By profession he was a poet, a cigar maker, a carpenter, and owner of a tobacco plantation. He fought in the American Civil War. He served on the board of directors of the Couvent School, which had been created by Marie Couvent in 1848. In 1873 Aristide married Louise Mathilde Denebourg. Rodolphe married Mathilde Cheval, and they lived for some time with her mother, also named Mathilde. Before 1880, they had children Daniel (born in about 1873), Agnes (about 1873), Louise (about 1874), Coritza (born in 1876), and Wendelle (born winter 1876-1877). The Chevals may have descended from early Cheval settlers of the Trem√© district, Pierre and L√©andre. In 1879, Rodolphe started a relationship with Clementine Walker, born in 1860 and a daughter of John and Ophelia Walker. Rodolphe and Clementine had at least four children, Mary Celine (March 25, 1879), John Alexander (1881), Louise (1889), and Oscar Alphonse (1892). Clementine died September 23, 1893. Mary Celine later became known as Mamie Desdunes and was a blues pianist. Clementine lived near Jelly Roll Morton's godmother, and J√©r√©mie and Henriette Desdunes were neighbors of Morton's mother. From this proximity, Morton learned the song he recorded as \\"Mamie's Blues\\" or \\"2:19 Blues\\" and attributed to Mamie, singing, \\"Can‚Äôt give a dollar, give a lousy dime,/ I wanna feed that hungry man of mine.\\" Other associates of Mamie included performer Bunk Johnson and promoters Hattie Rogers and Lulu White. Mamie married George Degay in 1898, and died of tuberculosis December 4, 1911. Oscar was also a musician. After his nephew Clarence's death in 1933, Oscar played with his band, the Joyland Revellers. Rodolphe had three other daughters, possibly by Clementine, named Edna, Lucille, and Jeanne (born about 1893).While it is not clear if Rodolphe and Clementine married, Clementine is called, Mrs. Clementine Walker Desdunes in the 1963 obituary of their child, Oscar.

In 1874, under the command of former Confederate General and then adjutant general of the Louisiana Militia James Longstreet, Desdunes was among the injured in the Battle of Liberty Place, fought between the pro-Republican city, state, and federal forces, and a pro-Democratic, largely ex-Confederate group called the White League.

Civil rights activism In the 1870s, Desdunes became involved in the pro-black rights Young Men's Progressive Association. As part of the Compromise of 1877, most of the federal troops were withdrawn from the South, enabling white supremacists to work more freely to suppress black rights. In 1878, the association, with Desdunes an officer and Thomas J. Boswell as president, were active in condemning lynchings: dozens of blacks had been killed in Louisiana in the 1870s. They noted the murders of Daniel Hill and Herman Bell of Ouachita Parish, Commodore Smallwood, Charles Carrol, John Higgins, and Washington Hill of Concordia Parish, Charles Bethel, Robert Williams, Munday Hill, James Stafford, Louis Postlewait, and William Henry of Tensas Parish.\\"An Address Of the Young Men's Progressive Association to the People of the United States\\".

J. Joubert, P. B. S. Pinchback, Caesar Antoine, Homer Plessy and others formed the Comit√© des Citoyens to organize black civil rights efforts. Rodolphe enlisted his eldest son, Daniel, to violate the act to allow for its challenge in the courts. On February 24, 192, Daniel boarded a train bound for Mobile, Alabama. While stopped at the corner of Elysian Fields and Claiborne in New Orleans, Daniel was arrested. However, Judge John Howard Ferguson ruled that the Separate Car Act could not be enforced for interstate travel because the constitution only granted the federal government the authority to regulate inter-state travel and commerce. The Comit√© then challenged the law again, this time focusing on intrastate travel and Plessy volunteered to break the law. Luscy, Bonseignure, Rodolphe Desdunes, Joubert, and Martinet secured Plessy's release on bail that same day.Carrillo, Karen Juanita. African American History Day by Day: A Reference Guide to Events. ABC-CLIO, 2012 When the case, Plessy vs. Ferguson, finally reached the U. S.

Omaha World-Herald (Omaha, Nebraska), Thursday, September 6, 1917, Page: 6 } Desdunes was very interested in the history and art of Creoles in Louisiana. From July through October 1895, Desdunes published translated excerpts from Joseph Saint-R√©my‚Äôs five volume work, P√©tion et Ha√Øti, for the New Orleans Crusader. Just before losing his sight, Desdunes finished a book about the contribution of Creoles to Louisiana history, Nos Hommes et Notre Histoire, which was published in Quebec in 1911. In the book, Desdunes uses personal reminiscences and scholarly biography to explore the lives of remarkable men in letters, fine arts, music, war, peace, and teaching. The story starts with the role of free black soldiers under General Andrew Jackson in the Battle of New Orleans in the War of 1812 and continues to explore the contribution of creoles to Louisiana and to the United States. It contrasts this with the hatred, contempt, and injustice that were faced by the men described and all blacks faced. In this way, Desdunes' work follows the example of La Campagne De 1814-15 by Hippolyte Castra, a commonality that Desdunes points out by including Castra and Castra's activities in his book. The introduction of the original edition was written by Louis Martin.V. P. Thomas, \\"The Creoles Story Told By R. L. Desdunes In His History 'Our Men And History'\\". Cleveland Gazette (Cleveland, Ohio). Saturday, May 11, 1912 Page: 4 In Omaha, he continued to work on his poetry, submitting his work to various outlets. He also became close to others in the Omaha black community, particularly Father John Albert Williams, who praised Desdunes as \\"Omaha's Blind Negro Poet\\" in the Omaha World-Herald.\\"Omaha's Blind Negro Poet\\". Date: Wednesday, September 12, 1917 Paper: Omaha World-Herald (Omaha, Nebraska) Page: 6 His poems in the Herald included praise for black soldiers serving in World War I, \\"To the French High Commission (Hommage de la population de couleur.)\\", and a tribute to Nebraska entitled \\"Aksarben, Eloge\\", both of which appeared in 1917.[No Headline].

With 8,723 cases reported, it was the largest outbreak of Zika fever before the outbreak in the Americas that began in April 2015. An earlier outbreak occurred on Yap Island in the Federated States of Micronesia in 2007, but it is thought that the 2013‚Äì2014 outbreak involved an independent introduction of the Zika virus from Southeast Asia. Investigators suggested that the outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases in the Pacific from 2012 to 2014 were \\"the early stages of a wave that will continue for several years\\", particularly because of their vulnerability to infectious diseases stemming from isolation and immunologically naive populations.  Epidemiology  = French Polynesia = Outbreaks of Zika virus, dengue and chikungunya in Oceania from January 2012 to September 2014. The first Zika outbreak started in French Polynesia in October 2013, with cases reported in the Society, Marquesas and Tuamotu Islands on Tahiti, Mo'orea, Raiatea, Tahaa, Bora Bora, Nuku Hiva and Arutua. The outbreak ran concurrently with an outbreak of dengue fever. In December 2013, an American traveler to Mo'orea was diagnosed with Zika virus infection in New York after an 11-day history of symptoms, becoming the first American tourist to be diagnosed with Zika. A Japanese tourist returning to Japan was also diagnosed with Zika virus infection by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases after visiting Bora Bora, becoming the first imported case of Zika fever in Japan. By February 2014, it was estimated that more than 29,000 people with Zika-like symptoms had sought medical care, roughly 11.5% of the population, with 8,503 suspected cases. Of 746 samples tested at the in Tahiti by 7 February, 396 (53.1%) were confirmed as containing the Zika virus by RT-PCR. Two further cases of Zika virus infection were imported into Japan, and on 25 February, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health reported that a traveler returning to Norway from Tahiti was confirmed to have a Zika virus infection. By March 2014, the outbreak was declining in the majority of the islands, and by October the outbreak had abated. A total of 8,723 suspected cases of Zika virus infection were reported, as well as more than 30,000 estimated clinical visits and medical consultations due to concerns about Zika. The true number of Zika cases was estimated at more than 30,000. = New Caledonia = Zika spread westwards from French Polynesia to New Caledonia, where imported cases from French Polynesia were reported from November 2013 onwards. The first indigenous case was confirmed in January 2014 by the Pasteur Institute. On 10 February, there were 64 reported cases of Zika in the communities of Greater Noum√©a, Dumb√©a, and Ouv√©a, of which 30 were imported from French Polynesia. By 26 February 2014, there were 140 confirmed cases of Zika in New Caledonia, including 32 imported cases. The outbreak peaked in April, and by 17 September, the number of confirmed cases had gone up to 1,400, of which 35 were imported. During the same time period, there were also outbreaks of chikungunya fever and dengue fever. = Cook Islands = In February 2014, an outbreak of Zika was reported in the Cook Islands, to the southwest of French Polynesia. In March, an Australian woman was diagnosed with a Zika virus infection by Queensland Health following a recent trip to the Cook Islands, becoming the second reported case of Zika diagnosed in Australia. Nearly 40 other cases of Zika virus infection were imported into New Zealand. By 29 May, the outbreak had ended, with 50 confirmed and 932 suspected cases of Zika virus infection. = Easter Island = By March 2014, there were one confirmed and 40 suspected cases of Zika virus infection on Easter Island. The Zika virus was suspected to have been carried to the island by a tourist from French Polynesia during the annual Tapati festival, held between January and February. Chilean health authorities decided against issuing a health alert, saying that the outbreak had been contained and was under control, and advised travelers to take precautions against mosquito bites. By the end of the year, 173 cases of Zika had been reported, but all of the cases were described as \\"mild\\". On 24 September 2014, a Belgian woman flying to Easter Island from Tahiti was diagnosed with Zika virus infection after having previously received ambulatory care in Tahiti, and was taken to Hanga Roa Hospital for evaluation. LAN Airlines undertook operations to ensure other people on the woman's flight were not infected, and local health authorities stated that Zika was not a risk for people on the island.  Transmission Adult Aedes aegypti mosquito, a vector or carrier of the Zika virus Zika is a mosquito-borne disease. Four aedine species of mosquito are found in the Pacific, including Aedes aegypti, widespread across the South Pacific, and Aedes polynesiensis, found between Fiji and French Polynesia. Aedes aegypti has previous been identified as a wild vector of the Zika virus, and preliminary results from the Institut Louis-Malard√© have supported the main role of Aedes aegypti and probable role of Aedes polynesiensis in spreading the Zika virus. People infected with the Zika virus traveling to other Pacific islands could transmit the disease to local mosquitoes that bit them. The infected mosquitoes could then go on to spread Zika among the local mosquito population, and thence cause outbreaks of Zika among local people. A study conducted between November 2013 and February 2014 in French Polynesia found that 2.8% of blood donors tested positive for the Zika virus, of which 3% were asymptomatic at the time of blood donation. 11 of the infected donors studied subsequently reported symptoms of Zika virus infection within 10 days. This indicated a potential risk of transmission of the Zika virus through blood transfusions, but there are no confirmed cases of this occurring. Nucleic acid testing of blood donors was implemented in French Polynesia from 13 January 2014 onwards to prevent unintended transmission of the Zika virus.  Possible links to neurological syndromes, infant microcephaly and other disorders  A concurrent increase in neurological syndromes and autoimmune complications was first reported in early 2014. Of the 8,723 cases of Zika reported in French Polynesia, complications related to neurological signs of infection were noted in 74 people, including Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome (GBS) in 42 people, as well as encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, paraesthesia, facial paralysis or myelitis in 25. However, there was only one laboratory confirmation of Zika virus infection using RT-PCR in patients with GBS. Among the initial 38 cases of GBS found in suspected Zika cases, 73% were male and infected individuals were aged between 27 and 70. This was highly unusual, as prior to the Zika outbreak there had only been 21 cases of GBS in French Polynesia between 2009 and 2012. 18 people newly diagnosed with GBS were admitted to the local rehabilitation centre, putting heavy strain on the limited intensive care resources available. On 24 November 2015, health authorities in French Polynesia reported that there had been an unusual increase in the number of cases of central nervous system malformations in fetuses and infants during 2014‚Äì2015, coinciding with the outbreak of Zika on the islands. These malformations included 12 with fetal cerebral malformations or polymalformative syndromes, which includes microcephaly, and another 5 with brainstem dysfunction and absence of swallowing, much greater than the annual average of one case. None of the pregnant women involved had medical signs of Zika virus infection, but four who were tested gave positive results in IgG serology assays for flaviviruses, suggesting an asymptomatic Zika virus infection during pregnancy. French Polynesian health authorities hypothesise that these abnormalities are associated with Zika if pregnant women are infected during the first or second trimester of pregnancy. Dr. Didier Musso, an infectious disease specialist at the Institut Louis-Malard√©, said that there was \\"very high suspicion\\" of a link between microcephaly and the Zika virus outbreak in French Polynesia, but added that further research was still needed. The two cases of Zika virus infection imported into Japan from French Polynesia in February 2014 showed signs of leukopenia (decreased levels of white blood cells) and moderate thrombocytopenia (decreased levels of platelets).  Aftermath  Brazilian researchers have suggested that a traveler infected with the Zika virus arrived in Brazil from French Polynesia, leading to the ongoing Zika virus outbreak that began in 2015. This may have occurred during the 2014 FIFA World Cup tournament, or shortly after, based on phylogenetic DNA analysis of the virus. French researchers have speculated that the virus arrived in August 2014, when canoeing teams from French Polynesia, New Caledonia, the Cook Islands and Easter Island attended the Va'a World Sprint Championships in Rio de Janeiro. Between 1 January and 20 May 2015, a further 82 confirmed cases of Zika were reported in New Caledonia, including ten imported cases. In early 2015, two cases of Zika virus infection were reported in travelers returning to Italy from French Polynesia. In February 2015, an outbreak of Zika began in the Solomon Islands. The Ministry of Health and Medical Services reported the first laboratory confirmation of Zika virus infection on 12 March 2015, and by 3 May 302 cases of Zika had been reported, with the number of new cases steadily decreasing. On 27 April 2015, the Ministry of Health of Vanuatu announced that blood samples collected prior to Cyclone Pam in March were confirmed to contain the Zika virus. The Ministry of Health advised people to consult medical aid if they experienced a high fever with no obvious cause, and recommended communities clean up places where mosquitoes could lay eggs. The introduction of the Zika virus was thought to be linked to frequent travel between New Caledonia and Vanuatu. Local transmission of the Zika virus by mosquitoes has been reported in the Polynesian islands of American Samoa, Samoa, and Tonga since November 2015. Cases of Zika virus infection have subsequently been confirmed in American Samoa, Samoa, Tonga, and the Marshall Islands.

It was first described by Norman I. Platnick in 2002, and has only been found in Australia. The name is a portmanteau of Barrow Island and Ammoxenidae. Members of this genus are most similar to Austrammo, but there are several distinct differences. Notably, they lack setae on the back of the last segment of the pedipalp, which is a defining characteristic of Austrammo. In males, there are tubercles on the bulb of the pedipalp and a scutum on the back of the abdomen that doesn't occur in members of Austrammo. In females, the abdomen is rectangular, while those of Austrammo are triangular. These differences were considered enough to create a new genus.

It is a shrub with many sticky branches, narrow, light green leaves and blue, purple or violet flowers. Description Eremophila ionantha is an erect shrub growing to a height of between with many spreading or ascending branches. The branches are sticky due to the presence of resin and have many small, wart-like lumps and glandular hairs. The leaves are arranged in opposite pairs along the branches and are light, olive-green in colour, linear in shape, mostly long and about wide, curved, sometimes S-shaped and sticky, at least when young. The flowers are borne singly or in pairs on a glabrous, sticky stalk usually long. There are 5 green, tinged reddish-brown sepals which are linear to narrow-triangular in shape, mostly long and hairy on the inner surface only. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The flower buds are brown but when it opens the petal tube is pale lilac-coloured to violet on the outside and white to pale lilac inside. The outside surface of the petal tube is glabrous and often shiny but the middle part of the lower petal lobe and the inside of the petal tube are covered with matted hairs. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs from late September to February and is followed by hairy, woody, oval-shaped or cone-shaped fruits with a pointed end. The fruits are about long. Taxonomy and naming Eremophila ionantha was first formally described in 1905 by Ludwig Diels and Ernst Georg Pritzel and the description was published in Botanische Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr Systematik, Pflanzengeschichte und Pflanzengeographie. The specific epithet (ionantha) is derived from Ancient Greek adjective, ion, meaning \\"violet\\", and the noun, anthos, meaning \\"flower\\". Distribution and habitat E. ionantha grows in Eucalyptus woodland between Merredin and Balladonia in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Esperance Plains, Mallee and Murchison biogeographic regions. Conservation status This species is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This eremophila is a hardy plant needing little maintenance and is long lived - garden specimens of this species have been known to survive for more than 40 years. It is a medium-sized shrub with attractive blue to purple flowers. It can be propagated easily from cuttings taken at any time of the year and will grow in most soils, including heavy clay. It will grow in full sun or heavy shade, is both drought and frost tolerant, is tolerant of windy conditions and useful as a low-density windbreak.

In the 1950s Guigui met and worked with Composer Aaron Copland, who later invited Guigui to the United States to conduct in Tanglewood, where Guigui remained studying at Boston University graduating with high honors. Guigui and his wife Elena moved to New York City in 1960 where Guigui played clarinet in the New York Philharmonic under the direction of Leonard Bernstein. Guigui made his American debut as conductor Maestro Guigui at Town Hall and went on to tour with the American Ballet Theatre. Guigui was then invited by Pablo Casals to San Juan, Puerto Rico to play clarinet with the Casals Festival and conduct the Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra. Guigui and his family (his son Martin, daughter Ana) all moved to and lived in Puerto Rico, where Guigui was also a full-time professor at the Conservatory of Music. Guigui went on to work alongside the likes of Itzhak Perlman, Isaac Stern, Yehudi Menuhin, Daniel Barenboim, Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo, and Alexander Schneider. Maestro Guigui was the conductor of the Vermont Symphony Orchestra from 1974 to 1989. He also conducted orchestras as a guest in South America. Additionally, he was a guest conductor at the Juilliard School in New York City. Guigui taught clarinet and conducting at Dartmouth College where he also conducted the Dartmouth Symphony. Guigui founded the Panama Symphony Orchestra, and Panama Youth Orchestra. Guigui established a children's orchestra in Mexico. He was the recipient of the Governor's Award for Excellence in the Arts from the Vermont Council on the Arts in 1989. In 1986 Guigui won the Ditson Conductor's Award. Guigui and his childhood best friend, Pulitzer Prize winning composer Mario Davidovsky, ran the Composers Conference for 40 years, with Guigui making over 3,000 recordings. Just prior to his passing, Maestro Guigui conducted three nights of the Rachmaninoff Competition at Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, to sold out standing ovations. Death Guigui died on June 18, 2007 of complications from sarcoma cancer, in Los Angeles, California.

Name  The concept is invented and coined by Vahe Gurzadyan, which then is attributed by Stephen Webb as Solution 23 to Fermi paradox: \\"The Armenian mathematical physicist Vahe Gurzadyan has posited an interesting hypothesis: we might inhabit a Galaxy ‚Äúfull of traveling life streams‚Äù strings of bits beamed throughout space.\\"  Background  Kolmogorov complexity is defined as the length of the computer program which enables the complete recovery of an object. Gurzadyan showed that the complexity of the human genome is relatively low due to non-random parts in the genomic sequences. Moreover, he noticed that since the genomic information on the terrestrial life, starting from bacteria up to humans, contains essential common parts, the entire terrestrial life information can be compressed and transmitted, as he estimated, to over Galactic distances via Arecibo-type antenna. Von Neumann automata network or some mechanism can perform the decoding of the information package. Within this concept one can even assume that the terrestrial life itself might be a result of such an information package. Information panspermia has been discussed by Gurzadyan and Roger Penrose within the scheme of Conformal Cyclic Cosmology, i.e. the possibility of transmission of information from pre-Big Bang aeon to ours via the cosmic microwave background radiation.  Influence on strategy of analysis of intelligent signals  This concept assumes a different strategy of the study of the cosmic signals based on universal compressing and decoding principles. Information panspermia is discussed in: \\"Gurzadyan‚Äôs idea offers a straightforward practical consequence: we should study alleged SETI signals from the point of view of the algorithmic information theory and we should try to identify and decode possible bit strings hidden in the noise.\\"  References  Category:Search for extraterrestrial intelligence Category:Interstellar messages Category:Fermi paradox ","title":"Information panspermia"},{"id":"49320044","text":"Marcus Randell Cole (born November 9, 1971) is an American gospel musician and worship leader, Christian R&B;, urban gospel and black gospel recording artist and singer.

Content  The English translation of the first verse is: In Verse 91 acharya asserts that both fate and human-effort are jointly responsible for desirable and undesirable effects. In Verse 98 acharya propounds that bondage (bandha) is caused due to ignorance 'accompanied' by delusion (moha), and bondage is not caused due to ignorance 'not accompanied' by delusion (moha).

She was a millionaire by the age of 29 as a result of her hard work and ambition. She also became a pioneer in the TV industry. Personal life Alvarez was born Maria Helen Harman on July 4, 1921, in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Her parents were Orlin and Edna Mae Harman. Alvarez was married three times. Her first husband was Joseph Alvarez whom she married in the 1940s. Her second husband was John Hill with whom she built the Tulsa Station in the 1960s. Finally, in the 1970s, she married C. Arnholt Smith. Her third union was perceived by many as controversial, since Smith had been convicted of grand theft and tax evasion in connection with the collapse of his U.S. National Bank. Alvarez had one child named Joseph Thomas Alvarez III. Alvarez spent most of her life in La Jolla, a community in the city of San Diego, California. Later, in her senior years, she moved to Rancho Santa Fe. She died of natural causes at the age of 88 in her home in Rancho Santa Fe, California. Career beginnings Maria Helen Alvarez Smith began her career in broadcasting by doing odd jobs and secretarial tasks at a Tulsa radio station in the 1940s. One day, the regular newscaster was absent from her slot, so she volunteered to report the news. Before long, her superiors recognized her potential and she was regularly reading stories for the station, many of which focused on the emerging television industry. While at the Tulsa radio station, Alvarez gained technical experience for what was to become her career in TV. She read everything she could find about TV, visiting 42 of the 89 TV stations that were on air throughout America. In her spare time, she took correspondence courses in electronic engineering and received the Federal Communications Commission license needed to build a television station. Tulsa TV history In 1950, it was Maria Helen Alvarez who brought TV to Tulsa, Oklahoma, creating the foundation on which KOTV currently stands. In the 1940s, people were not familiar with the concept of television. Alvarez, who had seven years prior experience in radio, pioneered TV, encouraging George Cameron to \\"take a chance on TV.\\" She was just 27 years old at the time. She totally revolutionized the station headquarters, turning it from a converted tractor shop to \\"the nation's largest TV broadcast center at the time.\\" With her design, the studio had 22-feet high ceilings and doors wide enough to enable the entrance of \\"parade floats and elephants.\\" Criticism and controversy Alvarez was the subject of much criticism throughout her media career. Station employees felt she was too frugal in her spending for the Tulsa station, impacting them negatively. According to Harry Volkman, there was one woman in particular who \\"was angry when she heard [she] was leaving. She said 'If Helen Alvarez wouldn't spend so much money on her boyfriends and more on the talent, we might keep some good people in this town! In 1957, Alvarez sued her business partners for $10 million in a civil suit. She accused them of conspiring to defraud her. It was allegedly San Diego's \\"largest lawsuit\\" in a federal court. A year later the matter was settled out of court. Recognition Life Magazine profiled her and dubbed Alvarez \\"Helen of Tulsa\\". She also became known as \\"The Mother of Tulsa TV\\". She was also the first female CEO in TV and a millionaire by the time she was 29. Walt Disney During the construction of Disneyland, Walt Disney was low on money. He wanted to have a hotel built at the exit of Disneyland but did not have the funds to build one. Walt Disney reached out to his friend, Jack Wrather, to help him out and build a hotel. Jack Wrather and Alvarez were in a partnership, and the Wrather-Alvarez company built the Disneyland Hotel. After an acrimonious end of Wrather and Alvarez's business relationship, Jack Wrather bought out the Alvarzez shares of the Wrather-Alvarez company. Other interests Alvarez had many interests. They included broadcasting, horse racing, hotel ventures, oil, politics and real estate ventures. She was a delegate to the 1964 Republican convention in San Francisco. In the 1980s, she acquired Imperial Airlines. Memberships Alvarez played an active role in the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club, the California Thoroughbred Breeders Association and the Scripps Foundation board. She was a member of the La Jolla Beach and Tennis Club, the Republican State Central Committee of California, and Charter 100.

With Mariage: on copie (1994), she became the first woman in Mali to publish a novel. A women's rights activist, her writings are aimed at improving the social conditions for women in Mali. Biography Born in Bamako, Mali, in 1957, A√Øcha Fofana was the daughter of B√©niti√©ni Fofana (1928‚Äì1991), who served as Mali's Minister of Health. After her primary school education in Bamako and in Bordeaux, France, she attended the Lyc√©e Notre-Dame in Niger. She went on to study languages, first at the Sorbonne, then at the University of Mannheim, Germany, and at Oxford. With her command of French, German and English, she subsequently worked as a translator and interpreter. Her first novel Mariage: on copie probes the conventional views of Malian women, telling the story of four of them who experience different problems owing to their varied ethnic backgrounds and status. By describing how the women resolve their marital problems, the novel sets out to show that Malian society is moving in the right direction. Her second novel La fourmili√®re (The Anthill) was published posthumously in 2006. It brings out the difficulties of Malian society as represented by the life of a large family. Her title is inspired by social structures which can be compared to those of a colony of ants. Frustrated by the time taken to have books published, Fofana decided to turn to the theatre where she could rely on communicating her ideas much more quickly. In April 1997, her first play Excellence on fait le m√©nage was presented at Bamako's Cultural Centre. As it was critical of political corruption, it caused quite a stir, both among the actors and those who came to see it. Her second play, L'Africaine de Paris no 2, presented the following year, tells the story of a Malian who marries a local woman only to discover that his first wife, also an African whom he married in Paris, comes to claim him as her husband, upsetting the family environment. Fofana is also remembered as a courageous advocate of women's rights. In 1998, she was a founding member of the Malian Association of Human Rights. Her writings are often centred on improving social conditions for African women. A√Øcha Fofana died unexpectedly in Bamako on 16 August 2003.

Seluk has started a few spin-off comics on the website of The Awkward Yeti. These are Heart and Brain, a webcomic following the daily lives of an anthropomorphic heart and brain, and Medical Tales Retold, which repurposes real medical stories into comedic or touching comics.

Overview The Awkward Yeti, featuring Lars, was originally self-published as a children's book in 2012. As Seluk started to get attached to the character, he began creating more adult-oriented comics strips about Lars and uploading them on the Internet in September 2012. Lars is a socially awkward yeti, trying to get by in day-to-day life. Seluk has also created various spin-off comics on the website of The Awkward Yeti. =Heart and Brain= Heart and Brain Heart and Brain features Lars' anthropomorphized heart and brain as the two main characters. In the webcomic, the heart follows its feelings and emotions, chasing down butterflies and getting excited about kittens, while the brain is concerned about adult responsibility. While the heart skips to emotional need, the brain brings in reason and logic for why the heart's action are ill- advised. Lindsey Holmes described Heart and Brain as \\"the internal tennis match we often face between our romantic hearts and our realistic brains.\\" Other characters include Tongue, who is often hedonistic and manipulative, Stomach, who is often sensitive, and other organ characters. The characters of Heart and Brain are considered very relatable, as they cover well-known dichotomies such as introversion and extroversion, and logic and emotion. Seluk's degree in psychology benefited him in reinforcing these aspects. The characters were metaphorically inspired by the concept of Id, Ego and Superego, represented by the heart, Lars, and the brain respectively. In November 2015, Seluk published a collection of Heart and Brain comics in a book. =Medical Tales Retold= For Medical Tales Retold, Seluk draws comics about unusual or touching stories he gets through his email. These stories are about illnesses and injuries and can be sent in by doctors or patients. The concept of Medical Tales Retold came up in collaboration with Tapastic. After Seluk saw an artist illustrate personal love stories through Tapastic, he thought it would be a good idea to normalize unusual medical stories through humor. OrganAttack In June 2016, Seluk launched a Kickstarter campaign for a card game based on his webcomics, titled OrganAttack (Stylized OrganATTACK). The card game features medical and pseudoscientific concepts, where players have the objective to remove the organs of their opponents. The campaign reached over $280,000 USD in its first week and closed on July 3. Reception Describing Heart and Brain as a \\"fun and eminently relatable read,\\" Jan Johnston, collection development coordinator of the Fort Vancouver Regional Library District, praised Heart and Brain the comic as something that is \\"guaranteed to make you laugh [and] nod in empathy.\\" Johnston also approved of its message to stop worrying and \\"let your heart lead the way.\\" Heart and Brain: An Awkward Yeti Collection reached number 3 in the New York Times Best Seller list shortly after its release in November 2015. \\"The Battle\\", the 26th episode of Medical Tales Retold, gained attention for visualizing the struggles of depression and anxiety. Lisa Winter of A Plus described the comic as an \\"amazing\\" illustration of a topic that can be difficult to explain, and Seluk himself was drawn to the story because it \\"broke an imaginary line between physical and mental ailments in my series.\\" The Huffington Post said that \\"Anxiety and depression are complex mental health disorders than can be difficult to describe ‚Äî but this comic totally nails it.\\"Holmes, Lindsay. \\"How It Really Feels To Have Anxiety And Depression, In One Comic: Simple yet accurate\\".

His work was primarily Neoclassical and Art Nouveau between 1893-1914 and Art Deco from 1915 until his death in 1925. Early life and education Schmidt-Hofer was born in Berlin, German Empire, in 1873. He studied at the Royal School of Art and also in the educational department at the Berlin Museum of Decorative Arts, founded as the Deutsches Gewerbe-Museum zu Berlin in 1868.Heute mal Extremit√§ten Tobias Timm, Die Zeit, 31 August 2009. Retrieved 4 February 2016. Career A signature example for German sculptor Otto Schmidt-Hofer from circa 1920 He specialized in genre sculpture featuring working people doing normal everyday tasks and activities. He produced a number of sculptures of blacksmiths and masons at work, women harvesting fields with scythes, and athletes. A number of the pieces he cast were of figures in the nude which was popular during the era he worked in. Schmidt-Hofer was a member of the National Association of Artists in Germany. He produced several Neoclassical statues in patinated bronze and held membership in the Reichsverband bildender K√ºnstler in Germany. Very versatile, Schmidt-Hofer was able to transition from works produced in the Art Nouveau era and pivot to doing a number of Art Deco sculptures during the latter portion of his career between 1915 and 1925. One sculpture, among his large career output of Art Deco sculptures, was The Entertainer. The statue, cast in four variations ‚Äì one being chryselephantine and the other being all bronze (and also clothed and nude) ‚Äì was among the best of the work he produced. The Entertainer features a beautiful, svelte young lady wearing a jewel-laden costume in the midst of a stage performance. Schmidt-Hofer also produced a small version of the statue (about 6 inches high) that was mounted on a Brazilian green onyx pin dish. The full array of Schmidt-Hofer's plentiful sculpting skills are displayed in this artwork which he completed . Death and legacy Schmidt-Hofer died in Berlin, Weimar Republic, in 1925. Along with other German sculptors of the period such as Iffland, Preiss, and Schmidt-Felling, Schmidt-Hofer takes his rightful place as one of the premier Neoclassical, Art Deco, and Art Nouveau sculptors that Germany has ever produced.

The surface of the body as a boundary, the line for coinciding body surfaces, as well as the color and structure of the material are the means. Peter Schwickerath preferably clearly defined shapes for his metal sculptures, such as the square pillar and the cylinder. These have, in their different arrangement and the interplay of mass and volume, display the destination, spatial relationships and to make recognizable.

It is a small to medium- sized shrub with hairy branches and leaves, lance-shaped to egg-shaped leaves and cream-coloured, lilac or purple flowers. Description Eremophila jucunda is a small to medium shrub, depending on its habitat, growing to about tall on hard, stony clay to on hillsides. Its branches and leaves are covered with grey or lemon-yellow branched hairs, especially densely when young. The leaves are lance-shaped to egg-shaped, mostly long and wide. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on a stalk long covered in hairs similar to those on the leaves. There are 5 pale yellowish-green to purplish-brown, linear to lance-shaped sepals which are mostly long but which enlarge after flowering. The sepals are covered with hairs similar to those on the young leaves. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube may be white, cream-coloured, violet or purple on the outside and white, sometimes with purple spots inside. The outer surface of the petal tube and its lobes are mostly glabrous but the inside of the tube is filled with long hairs. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs from July to September and is followed by oval-shaped to conical fruits with a pointed end and which are long.E. jucunda pulcherrima leaves and flower Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 2007 and the description was published in Eremophila and Allied Genera: A Monograph of the Plant Family Myoporaceae. The specific epithet (jucunda) is a Latin word meaning \\"pleasant\\", \\"agreeable\\" or \\"delightful\\". Two subspecies are recognized in the Australian Plant Census: *Eremophila jucunda subsp. jucunda which has cream-coloured to lilac flowers, bright yellow hairs on the young branches, leaves and sepals, and hairs on the outside of the petal tube; *Eremophila jucunda subsp. pulcherrima which has lilac-coloured to light purple flowers, grey hairs on the young growth and petals which are glabrous on the outside. Distribution and habitat Eremophila jucunda subsp. jucunda is widespread on hills, ranges and plains between Sandstone and Mount Vernon in the Gascoyne, Murchison, Pilbara and Yalgoo biogeographic regions. Subspecies pulcherrima grows mostly on slopes and rocky hills between Paraburdoo and Newman in the Gascoyne, Murchison and Pilbara biogeographic regions. Conservation Both subspecies of E. jucunda are classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This eremophila grows best in warm inland areas - in southern Australia it tends to be prone to fungal disease. It can be propagated most easily by grafting onto Myoporum rootstock and grown in well-drained soils in full sun. It needs only occasional watering during a long drought but is sensitive to frost which can damaged the stems.

It is native to much of Africa and parts of western Asia. It is found inland and by the sea in sandy saline habitats. Distribution and habitat Juncus rigidus is native to much of Africa, Mediterranean Europe, the Arabian Peninsula and western Asia, as far east as Pakistan. It grows in sandy, saline areas on the coast and inland, in deserts and in steppes. Its typical habitat is on the fringes of salt marshes, around pools, in seasonally wet depressions and near wells. Ecology In Egypt, Juncus rigidus grows in association with other salt-tolerant plants such as Halocnemum strobilaceum, golden samphire (Limbarda crithmoides), Arthrocnemum macrostachyum, shrubby seablight (Suaeda vera) and sea purslane (Halimione portulacoides). Uses In Ancient Egypt, Juncus rigidus was used to make pens for writing on papyrus. The rush has also been used for weaving mats and the fibre can be used in paper manufacture. The seeds are high in amino acids, proteins, oils and carbohydrates and might be of use in the chemical industry. It has been suggested that this plant, along with its close relative the sharp-pointed rush (Juncus acutus), might be grown on saline land as an alternative crop with agro-industrial potential.

It had a parasol wing, a single engine and hull stabilizing sponsons. Only one was built. Design In 1929 the French Air Ministry drew up a programme of military aircraft specifications to meet France's needs over the next few years. One part called for a reconnaissance and observation seaplane and the R.5 was Romano's response; at least two other manufacturers also built prototypes, though funding was not yet assured. The Romano R.5 was an all- metal flying boat. Its parasol wing was built in three parts; its centre section mounted a Hispano-Suiza 12Nbr water-cooled V-12 engine in tractor configuration on its leading edge and was braced over the fuselage by parallel pairs of struts from its outer ends to the mid-fuselage. Six short cabane struts braced it centrally. The inner and cantilever outer panels together provided a trapezoidal plan wing out to rounded tips; ailerons occupied most of the outer panels' trailing edges. Structurally a mixture of steel and duralumin, with dural skinning, the wing was built around two spars; in the centre section these were elaborated into a trellised girder. Its , flat-sided hull was built with of dural and with vedal, layers of dural and pure aluminium, for parts in direct contact with sea-water. The V-form underside had a single step under the wing and, further aft, a water rudder. The R.5 had a pair of Dornier-style sponsons, in span and at their broadest, mounted on the lower sides of the fuselage instead of wing mounted floats. There were plans to use these to contain retractable wheels to turn the R.5 into an amphibian. In the nose there was a position for mooring operations, navigation equipment and a machine gun mounting. The pilots' cabin was ahead of the propeller disc, fully enclosed and with side-by-side seats and dual controls. Behind the wing there were positions for a navigator who also operated the bomb release controls and for a radio and camera operator. Behind them was a dorsal gunner's position, midway between the trailing edge and the tail. The fuselage became slender to the rear, where the tall fin carried a deep, rounded unbalanced rudder. The R.5's tapered tailplane was raised out of the spray well up on the fin and supported from below with a pair of parallel struts from the upper fuselage. Its elevators were inset and unbalanced but far enough forward to only require a small central nick for rudder movement. The Romano R.5 first flew in September 1932. Soon after, it was delivered to the Forces A√©rienne de la Mer along with its competitors, the Amiot 110-S and CAMS 80.

Williams (July 21, 1842 ‚Äì 1910) was a Democratic assemblyman and state senator. He was a supporter of the Jacksonian democracy. Williams was born in 1842 in Conway, Arkansas as the son of a planter. The ancestors of his father originated in Wales and the ancestors of his mother in France. His father died when Williams was young. He moved to Calaveras County, California at age seventeen by crossing the Great Plains. He didn't know any people over there and started working in the mining business. In 1862, he moved to Nevada Territory and became a silver miner. Williams went with Governor Lewis R. Bradley to Austin, Nevada the next year during the Reese River excitement. He helped with organizing Nye County, Nevada and resided in the county since then. In September 1870, Williams married Sophie Ernst. On November 5, 1878, he was elected member of the Nevada Assembly, where he and W. B. Taylor represented Nye County. Williams' term started the next day and ended after the elections of 1880. At those elections, he was elected Nevada State Senator and succeeded Harry T. Creswell. Williams represented Nye County during two regular sessions until his mandate ended in November 1884. One of his most important accomplishments was the Williams Resolution of 1881, that he authored. This resolution regulated the freights and fares of the railroads in Nevada. In 1882, when he was a senator, he was thought to be a possible candidate for Governor of Nevada, but he denied these claims. The Belmont Courier called him \\"undoubtedly a very strong and popular man\\". The book History of Nevada (1881) stated that back then Williams was in the mining business and owned some mining claims, a hotel, and 500 acres of land, where he made hay. At that time, he lived in Hot Creek, now a Nevada ghost town. In February 1890, Williams became a charter member of the Board of Trade of Nye County.

He later lived with the family in the White House. Rob Roy was immortalized in a Howard Chandler Christy portrait of Grace Coolidge. He died in 1928 after a short illness. Life and death The Christy portrait of Rob Roy and Grace Coolidge Rob Roy was acquired by Calvin Coolidge's wife, Grace Coolidge, in 1922 from Island White Kennels in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Grace Coolidge had reportedly become enthralled by collies after seeing one of the breed perform in a circus.

Upon his death Coolidge wistfully remarked, Mannerisms Rob Roy was known as Coolidge's \\"favorite\\" among a menagerie of pets he kept that included dogs, birds, cats, and raccoons. Coolidge himself described Rob Roy as a \\"stately gentleman of great courage and fidelity\\". Rob Roy was known to lead Coolidge to the Oval Office each morning in a stoic manner with gaze fixed forward. Rob Roy's stately characteristics aside, Coolidge frequently tried to trick the dog into chasing animals that appeared on screen during the showing of films at the White House. According to Harry Truman, Coolidge once ordered Senator Morris Sheppard to surrender his sausage to the dog while Coolidge and Sheppard were having breakfast.

Early life  Obukhov was born in 1921 in the village of Malga in Perm Governorate to a peasant family. After graduation from junior high school, he worked in the Vereshchagino regional communications center.  World War II  In January 1942, Obukhov was drafted into the Red Army. He fought in combat from February 1942. By the summer of 1943, Obukhov was a squad leader in the 253rd Rifle Division's 551st Separate Combat Engineer Battalion. He fought in the Battle of the Dnieper during the fall. On 25 September, Obukhov was appointed commander of a pontoon boat for the Dnieper crossing. He first reached the river's west bank with 25 soldiers. While still crossing the river, the pontoon came under German fire while 100 meters from the shore. Bullet holes were causing the pontoon to sink when Obukhov reportedly began patching holes with overcoats and caps. He reportedly ordered the soldiers to do the same and they were able to successfully cross the river, keeping the pontoon afloat. During the landing, the infantry officer commanding the soldiers was wounded when German troops opened fire with automatic weapons and Obukhov reportedly replaced him in command. Obukhov organized machine gun fire and was able to neutralize the German positions. Another German machine gun was firing from a bunker, preventing the crossing of more pontoon boats. Obukhov reportedly crawled up to the bunker and destroyed the machine gun, killing its crew with two anti-tank grenades. Obukhov then repaired his pontoon and reportedly managed to cross the Dnieper again, ferrying two antitank guns and 50 soldiers.Hero of the Soviet Union citation, available online at pamyat-naroda.ru In the afternoon, Obukhov ferried 12 wounded soldiers across the Dnieper while under fire.

The estate belonged to the de la Poers, an Anglo-Norman family whose affiliation with the Roman Catholic Church led to their eventual expulsion from the Protestant English establishment. Count Edmund de la Poer, 18th Lord le Poer and Curraghmore, a Knight of Malta and Private Chamberlain to Pope Pius X, commenced the building of the present castle in 1863 to replace an earlier house which itself replaced an earlier house. The large Baronial house was designed by Samuel Ussher Roberts (1821‚Äì1900), great-grandson of the 18th century Waterford architect John Roberts. The design of Castle Gurteen was probably influenced by Scottish architect William Burn, an architect responsible for several Tudor-Baronial mansions in Britain. Construction began 1863 and was completed in 1866. After the completion of Castle Gurteen, Samuel Ussher Roberts also designed Kylemore Castle (now Kylemore Abbey) in County Galway. A number of features used at Gurteen were also used at Kylemore, and the same builder, Thomas Carroll, worked on both castles.From ‚ÄúExploring Irelands Castles, by Tarquin Blake, The Collins Press, 2017 Architecture The entrance facade has a large square tower with attached polygonal turret, which faces across a forecourt of castled walls. The interior of Gurteen is spacious and in the centre of the house is a top lit great hall with a gallery, divided by a screen of Gothic arches behind which is a staircase. Castle Gurteen de la Poer, Winter 2015 There are similar arches in the first floor gallery, which like the staircase, has a balustrade of wrought Iron. The library which is lined with bookcases has red walls and the drawing room and ballroom open into each other along the garden front. The dining room, on the other side of the hall, is to a Victorian Baronial style, with faded red walls above a dado of brown oak paneling. The chimney piece, of carved oak has heraldic angels holding shields of the family arms, and its head of St. Hubert's Stag - the family crest - with antlers and crucifix mounted on top of the mantle shelf. History The le Poer family claims descent from Sir Robert De Poer, who came to Ireland with Strongbow in 1172. King Henry II of England, who, by charter, granted to Robert the City of Waterford, with \\"the whole province thereabouts;\\" and made him marshal of Ireland. Count Edmund de la Poer, 18th Lord le Poer and Curraghmore, (1841‚Äì1915) who commissioned the building of Castle Gurteen de la Poer in 1863, was created 1st Count de la Poer [Papal States] in 1864. The Count was High Sheriff of County Waterford in 1879; Private Chamberlain to Pope Pius IX; HM Lord-Lieutenant for the County and city of Waterford, 1909. His second son, John William Rivallon, JP, 19th Baron and 2nd Count (1882‚Äì1939) was High Sheriff of County Waterford in 1913. In 1922, he claimed the barony of Le Poer and Curraghmore, and Committee of Privileges of House of Lords decided that but for the attainder of John Power in 1691, the claim had been established. His eldest son, Edmond Robert Arnold, 20th Baron and 3rd Count succeeded to the title of 20th Baron le Power and Curraghmore in 1939. He sold Castle Gurteen in 1979 but retained the right to live in the West Wing of the castle. He died on 20 November 1995 at age 84. Gottfried Helnwein In 1998, artist Gottfried Helnwein purchased Castle Gurteen and began restoration work on the castle and gardens. As of 2016, he lives and works there with his family. Since Helnwein took residence, the castle has hosted a number of guests. These have included a number in the entertainment industry - including Sean Penn, Ben Kingsley, Marilyn Manson, Lisa Marie Presley, Priscilla Presley, Beck, and others. Visitors from political circles have included ambassador William S. Farish, speaker of the German parliament Antje Vollmer, and former President of the Seychelles James R. Mancham. In December 2005, Marilyn Manson and Dita Von Teese were married in a private, non-denominational ceremony at the castle. In December 2014, the New York Times featured a 3 page-article about the Helnwein family at Castle Gurteen de la Poer.

Theodor Puschmann, from Julius Pagel's Biographisches Lexikon hervorragender √Ñrzte (1901), p 1301. Life and work Theodor Puschmann studied medicine in Berlin, Marburg, Vienna and Munich. He continued his medical training in England, France and Italy and spent a year as a physician in Egypt. In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1 he worked as a doctor in the reserves. In 1872 he began to practise in Munich and developed an interest in psychiatry under the influence of Bernhard von Gudden. In 1872 Puschmann published Richard Wagner: eine psychiatrische Studie, which set out the ways in which he believed the composer was suffering from mental illness, including persecution mania and sexual depravity. The book kicked off decades of speculation about Wagner's morals and medical condition, and the debate on degenerate music.Puschmann, Theodor, Richard Wagner: eine psychiatrische Studie (Berlin: Behr, 1872), In 1879 he became Professor of the History of Medicine in Vienna.

The plays were directed by Asit Basu with music by Hemango Biswas. Aikyatan Sangeet Vidyalay, a school for learning western music like guitar, mandolin & violin and Hindustani vocal & tabla, was also formed by Aikyatan. The school was led by music exponents Dr Loknath Subba, Pusparanjan Dey and Kishour Giri for more than two decades. Kalyan Baruah, an acclaimed musician of the country, learned guitar in the music school of Aikyatan during the eighties. The group was most prominent in the 1970s and 1980s. Since the early 2010s, it has been revived once again by filmmaker Prodyut Kumar Deka with the production of intimate plays like Apekhyat, Rising of the Moon, The Game of Chess, etc. Aikyatan performed a play Coffee Housot Apeksha under the aegis of Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA), Assam chapter on the occasion of its platinum jubilee in 2019 at District Library, Guwahati.

In 1827 he climbed Mont Blanc with Charles Fellows (address given as 26 Russell Square). With guides, they opened up what became known as the \\"Corridor Route\\" to the summit; the way via the Corridor and Mur de la C√¥te was standard for the next 30 years. An account of the ascent was published in 1828, edited by Benjamin Hawes, the younger. Initially Hawes was in the family soap-boiling business.Eug√®ne d'Eichthal, Condition de la classe ouvri√®re en Angleterre (1828) Notes prises par Gustave d'Eichthal, Revue Historique T. 79, Fasc. 1 (1902), pp. 63‚Äì95, at p. 64.

He married in 1833, as was recorded in Brunel's diary, to Anna Cartwright, daughter of Samuel Cartwright. He became chairman of the London and County Bank, retiring in 1847‚Äì8. The Hawes Soap Factory in New Cross, south London, was closed down in 1849, a move attributed by the family to the excise duty on soap, against which they had campaigned. Interests Hawes was involved in a number of learned and other societies. He was a Fellow of the Geological Society, from 1831 (address 17 Montagu Place, Russell Square); and the same year is listed (at St. John's Lambeth) as Fellow of the Zoological Society, and member of the Royal Institution. In 1848 he was borrowing a Royal Institution battery from Michael Faraday. He was a Fellow of the Statistical Society. Hawes chaired the Council of the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) four times in all, from 1863 to 1865 and in 1867. The membership included technocrats, largely Whig, Peelite or Radical in politics. His involvement with the RSA included promoting technical education; he coupled his support of artisans, for whom the RSA provided foreign travel, with opposition to trades unions. He brought in the Prince of Wales as President, in 1863. Not uniformly admired, he found that his report to the RSA on the 1862 International Exhibition placed him, according to the Gas Journal, among \\"dull, commonplace, fluent people\\". Attending the meeting of 29 July 1857 at Lord Brougham's house, where the Social Science Association (SSA) was set up, Hawes is counted one of its founders. In social matters, he had shown the visiting Gustave d'Eichthal round working-class dwellings, in 1828; and was still concerned with the issue in 1866. He took an interest in the management of public baths and washhouses, workhouses and hospitals. In 1869, during the debate on the bill for the 1870 Elementary Education Act, he defended the educational contribution of the livery companies. He belonged to the Haberdashers Company. Elizabeth Garrett was admitted to Middlesex Hospital for medical training in 1860. This came about through networking and Hawes, a governor of the hospital. Barbara Bodichon introduced Garrett to Emelia Gurney, who had provided Garrett with an introduction to Hawes; Hawes and Newson Garrett, Elizabeth's father, already knew each other via business; while Russell Gurney, Emelia's husband, was first cousin to Hawes, since William Hawes M.D. was his maternal grandfather. In 1871 Hawes spoke in favour of a presentation by Maria Grey to the RSA on female education.Alicia C.

He took a negative view of the proliferation of patents. Later business career In 1851 Hawes was chairman of the Australian Royal Mail Company (ARM). The Australian gold rushes were fuelling emigration to the continent, and the ARM placed orders for two steam vessels, the SS Adelaide and SS Victoria, using Brunel as consultant. In 1852 Hawes oversaw the trial of the Adelaide screw steamer, made by John Scott Russell. It made a journey to Adelaide in Australia, arriving in May 1853 but problems on the way had added three months to the journey. The Victoria also went to Australia in 1853. The Crimean War saw the Adelaide journeying to the Black Sea. After the war, which had removed steamers from the Australia route, the European and Australian (as it had become) was taken over in 1857‚Äì8 by the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company. During later life Hawes was involved in railway companies. He was a director of the Wallingford and Watlington Railway, and an investor in the North Metropolitan Railway and East London Railway, both of which he chaired.P. S.

He was the author of several texts and monographs on nutrition and allied sciences, including a 991-page treatise, Sorghum and the Millets: Their Composition and Nutritive Value. The Government of India awarded him the fourth highest civilian honour of the Padma Shri, in 2008, for his contributions to Science and for his humanitarian activities in India.  Biography  Royal College of Science and Technology. Joseph Hulse was born in Great Britain as the son of a baker and started assisting his father from the age of 4. He graduated in Industrial Biochemistry from the University of Manchester in 1943 during which time, he also worked as a farm hand at a local pig and poultry farm. He started his career by joining the Royal Air Force as a Trainee Officer and worked at the Bomber Command till 1947, serving as the in-charge of the educational and vocational training of the air force personnel at the Command. Retiring from the RAF in 1947, he became associated with the British Baking Industries Research Association (BBIRA) and obtained a research fellowship for higher studies in pharmaceutical and food chemistry with which he joined the Royal College of Science and Technology of the Glasgow University, involving in research on baking, specifically on biochemical and biophysical mechanics of bread staling. During this period, he also served as a technical adviser to Scotland and Ireland chapters of BBIRA and his researches at RCST lasted till 1951. In 1952, Hulse moved to Canada to join the Defence Research Medical Laboratories (DRML) of the Canadian Research Board, as a research biochemist, where he became the director of the Food and Nutrition Division, the youngest person to reach the position. He held the post till 1960 when he moved to the Maple Leaf Mills (MLM) as the Director of Research and worked there till 1966. During this time, he held two posts at the Canadian National Research Council; the vice-chair of the Committee on Fats and Oils, and the chair of the Food and Beverage Industries Committee. He was also a member of the Commission for the restructuring of the Winnipeg Grain Research Laboratories and worked on the Freedom from Hunger Canada (FFHC), as a committee member, chair of the Canada-Mysore Project and as the chair of the FFHC. He moved to Rome in 1967 to Food and Agriculture Organization as the assistant director where he was associated with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), with the responsibility for developing nine large food industries. He was also involved in the Codex Alimentarius project, a global standard and set of guidelines related to food safety. He also worked as the Scientific Adviser to the Secretary-General of the United Nations on Food and Nutrition and as the adviser to the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). He stayed in Rome for two years but was invited back to Canada by Maurice Strong, the then president of the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), as the scientific adviser to the organization, where he oversaw agricultural projects including the storage of food and grain. Hulse spent the next decade and half at International Development Research Centre (IDRC) where he started as the Director of the Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Sciences division (AFNS) while continuing his role as an adviser to CIDA for one more year. His stayed at the post in IDRC till 1984 when he was made the vice president with three divisions, AFNS, Health Sciences and Social Sciences divisions, reporting to him. It was during this period that he was involved in the establishment of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) and remained involved in its activities as a founding member till his departure from IDRC in 1987. When CGIAR established five new International Agricultural Research Centers, Hulse acted as the executing agent of the program. In 1980, the African inter-governmental consortium of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) utilised his services as the chairman of its mission to set guidelines for food security. After his resignation from IDRC, he served as the member of a World Bank committee for the establishment of the International Centre on Forestry Research and as an adviser, delegated by the Government of Canada, to the West Bank and Gaza strip for the establishment of an agro-industries institute for assisting the small farmers. He turned his focus to India in the 1990s which hosted many of his activities for the better part of the next two decades. During this period, he was known to have visited India over 60 times for stays of varying duration, and was involved with the Bio-villages Programme of M. S. Swaminathan Research Foundation. He was a visiting professor of the M. S. Swaminathan Research Foundation, Chennai and the Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysore. Joseph Hulse, who was associated with the Siemens-Hulse International Development Consultants, as its president, died on October 22, 2013, aged 90, at his residence in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.  Legacy  While working at the Royal Air Force at the educational and vocational training centre, Hulse was reported to have designed a free-fall dropping storage container for flour for use in food distribution at the famine-affected areas of the Netherlands. Later, during his researches at the Royal College of Science and Technology, he is known to have contributed in the development of Chorleywood Bread Process, a project the British Baking Industries Research Association (BBIRA) completed in 1961. He also spent time at the low temperature stations of Cambridge during his days at RCST and developed a new method of blood collection from bovines using cannula, to replace the slit-throat method in practice at that time. He also proposed the concept of using animal blood albumins in baked cakes. He was a part of the Committee on Fats and Oils of the Canadian National Research Council, which promoted the development of Canola oil. In 1960, the Freedom from Hunger Canada (FFHC) accepted a proposal by Hulse for a joint venture project in India, under the name, Canada-Mysore Project (CMP) and he was made the chair of the project. Under the aegis of the project, he set up a committee with representation from 20 food companies and many non-governmental organizations such as Save the Children Fund, and established an institute, International Food Technology Training Centre (IFTTC), Mysore, in collaboration with Mysore University, which accredited the 2-year course food technology offered by the institute. The institution grew to become the Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI), presently working under the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), a Government of India agency. Simultaneously, he was also a part of scientists who conceptualized the International Committee of Food Science and Technology (ICFoST), the latter day International Union of Food Science and Technology (IUFoST), and was involved with its activities till his death, serving as its president from 1979 to 1983.

Swaminathan Research Foundation brought him to India in the 1990s and he worked among the tribal women of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka for introducing new food processing techniques and for training them in the trade. His contributions have also been reported in the identification and documentation of over 60 forest plant extracts, which have since been registered with the Indian Council of Medical Research. He was a part of a Government of Karnataka project for the rehabilitation of sexually exploited women where he initiated programs for training the women in horticulture, handicrafts and dairy farming. Hulse, who is credited with over 250 articles, published his first book, The Science, Raw Materials and Hygiene of Baking, in 1952 which was co- authored by Alexander Urie. While working at the International Development Research Centre, he wrote a 997-page treatise, Sorghum and the Millets: Their Composition and Nutritive Value, co-authored by Evangeline Laing, Odette Pearson and published in 1980. Sustainable Development at Risk: Ignoring the Past, another book of Hulse published by IDRC in 2007, traces the history of the evolution of sustainable development as a concept and comments on the various aspects related to it. Polyphenols in Cereals and Legumes (1980) and Science, Agriculture, and Food Security (1995) are two other notable books published by him. Besides, he has also written monographs such as Triticale and Nutritive value of triticale protein (and the proteins of wheat and rye) and several reports including The Canadian Food Industries in National Survival, Nutritional Standards and Methods of Evaluation for Food Legume Breeders, World Food Resources ‚Äì an Overview and Agriculture International Engine of Economic Advance.  Awards and honours  Joseph Hulse, in his capacity as one of the founders of the International Committee of Food Science and Technology (ICFoST), delivered the inaugural Founder's Lecture at the IUFoST World Congress of 1991. He was an Outstanding Alumnus awardee (1998) and an elected Honorary Fellow of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (1978) and served as the Visiting Professor of Industrial Biotechnologies at the university. He was also elected as an Honorary Fellow by the national Institutes of Food Science and Technology of the UK, Australia and New Zealand, all in 1980 and the International Academy of Food Science and Technology (1997). A Life Fellow of the Association of Food Scientists and Technologists, India, he was elected as a Foreign Fellow of the National Academy of Sciences, India in 2006. The Polish Academy of Sciences awarded him their Distinguished Service Medal in 1983. The Earth Society of India and the Rotary Club International selected him for the Conservation of the Environment Award in 1998 and he was the only non-Indian to receive the award. The Government of India awarded him the fourth highest civilian honour of the Padma Shri in 2008, placing him among the few foreigners to have received the award.

Starting in 2006, the webcomic parodies the unusual aspects of video games in a comedic fashion. Initially gaining steam by parodying Super Smash Bros., Awkward Zombie is known for covering a broad selection of games. The webcomic has been featured by various gaming-related websites. Overview Updating approximately once a week, Awkward Zombie consists of gag-a-day parodies of a broad selection of video games, such as Super Smash Bros., Fire Emblem, Pok√©mon, The Legend of Zelda, World of Warcraft, Red Dead Redemption, and the Metal Gear series. Focusing on the \\"ridiculous situations\\" that could occur in video game worlds, Awkward Zombie is entirely non-sequential, with no main characters or plotlines. Because of this, the comic can be read entirely out of order. Tiedrich occasionally makes cameos in her own webcomic. Tiedrich occasionally does penciled 24-hour comics on the Awkward Zombie website. Tiedrich studied mechanical engineering at the Stevens Institute of Technology. Reception Graham Smith, editor-in-chief of Rock, Paper, Shotgun, praised Awkward Zombie for its focus on comedy rather than story. Stating that video game webcomics usually \\"start off being about videogames and then they drift ... to being more about the characters contained within the comic,\\" he said that Awkward Zombies great strength is not having a regular cast of characters. The staff of Paste Magazine described Awkward Zombie as \\"consistently hilarious\\". PC Magazine editor Eric Griffith listed Awkward Zombie among the \\"best webcomics of 2015\\". Awkward Zombie has frequently been featured in Kotakus \\"Sunday Comics\\" column, and multiple pages of the webcomic have been voted in Joystiq's \\"Weekly Webcomic Wrapup\\" poll as the best comic of their respective weeks.

While the knee is mainly involved, occasionally other joints such as the elbow or ankle can additionally be affected. Fluid accumulation in the joint can be extensive causing discomfort and impairing movement, although affected joints are not usually very painful. While the condition is chronic, it does not appear to progress to more destructive damage of the joint. It seems to affect slightly more women than men. Episodes of swelling last several days or longer, can occur with regular or semi- regular frequency, typically one or two episodes per month. Between periods of effusion, knee swelling reduces dramatically providing largely symptomless intervals. Unlike some other rheumatological conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, laboratory findings are usually within normal ranges or limits. Clear treatment options have yet to be established. NSAIDs and COX2-inhibitors are generally not effective. Where this condition has been correctly diagnosed, various anti-rheumatic drugs as well as colchicine may be trialled to find the most effective option. More aggressive intra-articular treatment such chemical or radio-active synovectomy can also be helpful although benefits beyond 1 year have not been reported in literature.  Signs and symptoms  Repeated, periodic joint effusions of the knee. Usually one knee is affected but sometimes both knees. Other joints may also be involved along with the knee. Effusions are large, restricting range of motion but significant pain is not a feature. There is usually stiffness. Tenderness of the joint may or may not be present. Aspirated synovial fluid is usually sterile but will sometimes show elevated cell count (>100 cells/mL) with 50% being polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Onset of effusions are sudden with no particular trigger or stimulus. Each episode lasts for a few days to about a week and recurs in cycles of 7 to 11 days with extremes of 3 days to 30 days also reported. Sometimes the joint may begin to swell again as soon as the fluid has subsided. Where both knees are affected concurrently, as one joint ceases to swell the other may become involved. The cycle of joints swellings have been reported as being very regular, even predictable. This has been a characteristic feature of IH in many case reports. However, over the longer- term especially, these cycles of effusion and recovery may not be as constant as first reported. In women, many cases seem to begin at puberty. Episodes of knee swelling may coincide the menstrual cycle. In nearly all case reports, pregnancy seems to suppress the condition but after birth, during lactation, it returns. In the main, patients are mostly free of other symptoms. Fever is rare. There no signs of local inflammation or lymphatic involvement. Laboratory tests are generally normal or within reference limits.  Cause  The cause is unknown but allergic and auto-inflammatory mechanisms have been proposed. In a 1957 review of IH, Mattingly did not find evidence that the condition is inherited unlike Reimann who, in 1974, describes the condition as ‚Äúheritable, non-inflammatory, and afebrile‚Äù. More recently, specific association with the Mediterranean fever gene, MEFV, has been proposed. So, with some individuals carrying gene mutations (MEFV and also TRAPS-related genes), the native immune system seems to plays a role in the development of IH, i.e. there is an auto-immune component to the condition.  Pathophysiology  Involvement of mast cells has been reported reflecting a possible immunoallergic aspect to IH. Mattingly suggests that IH may be an unusual variant of rheumatoid arthritis, and some patients may go on to develop RA. Joint damage however does not generally occur and only the synovial membrane is affected by a ‚Äònon-inflammatory oedema‚Äô. With regard to the periodic nature of effusions, Reimann theorises that: ‚Äú‚Ä¶either an inherent rhythm or a feedback mechanism (Morley, 1970) excites 'bioclocks' in the hypothalamus or in the synovial membrane (Richter, 1960). These 'Zeitgebers' provoke sudden accumulation of plasma in the lining and spaces of joints, tendon and ligament sheaths.‚Äù  Diagnosis  There is no specific test for this condition. Diagnosis is based on signs and symptoms, and exclusion of other conditions. =Differential diagnoses= *Rheumatoid arthritis. Confusion with rheumatoid arthritis may be common even though IH is a non- inflammatory condition without the many signs and symptoms associated with RA. So far, an association with HLA-B27 gene in IH has not been reported. With RA, small joints are mostly affected in an inflammatory, destructive manner. This is not observed in IH. Rheumatoid factor, cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies and antinuclear antibodies are usually negative in IH. *Palindromic rheumatism. Like IH, palindromic rheumatism (PR) is also characterised by relapsing, short-episodes of sudden onset arthritis with no recognisable trigger. However, unlike PR, IH affects the knee almost exclusively and there is a predictable periodic, regularity of attacks, with laboratory tests during attacks being generally unremarkable.Matteson EL. Periodic syndromes. In: Klippel JH, ed. Primer on the rheumatic diseases. Atlanta: Arthritis Foundation, 1997: 127‚Äì9. PR is also more likely to be associated with development of rheumatoid arthritis. *Familial Mediterranean Fever. For some patients with FMF, episodes of knee or joint inflammation may be the only presenting symptom during an acute inflammatory episode. The MEFV gene mutations associated with FMF have been implicated in the pathogenesis of both palindromic rheumatism and IH. *Other conditions for consideration (or exclusion) are other periodic arthropathies, crystal arthopathy, prepatellar bursitis (housemaids knee), pigmented villonodular synovitis, trauma and infectious causes.  Treatment  No treatment has been found to be routinely effective. NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors are not generally helpful other than for general pain relief. They do not seem to help reduce effusions or prevent their occurrence. Low-dose colchicine (and some other ‚Äòanti-rheumatic‚Äô therapies e.g. hydroxychloroquine) have been used with some success. (Use of methotrexate and intramuscular gold have not been reported in the literature). More aggressive treatments such as synovectomy, achieved using intra-articular agents (chemical or radioactive) can provide good results, with efficacy reported for at least 1 year.Setti G, Calciolari CA, Cimino V, et al. The treatment of idiopathic and secondary hydrarthrosis of the knee by intra- articular Rifamycin SV. Chir.Organi.Mov.1990; 75(4): 343-6. [Article in English, Italian] Reducing acute joint swelling: Arthrocentesis (or drainage of joint) may be useful to relieve joint swelling and improve range of motion. Local steroid injections can also reduce fluid accumulation short-term, but do not prevent onset of episodes. These treatments provide temporary relief only. Bed rest, ice packs splints and exercise are ineffective. A single case report of a patient with treatment-refractory IH describes the use of anakinra, an interleukin 1 receptor antagonist. At the first sign of any attack, a single 100 mg dose was given. With this dosing at onset of attacks, each episode of effusion was successfully terminated. Reducing frequency and severity of IH episodes: Case reports indicate some success using long-term, low-dose colchicine (e.g. 0.5 mg to 1 mg daily). A recent single case report has shown hydroxychloroquine (300 mg daily) to be effective too. Small-sized clinical trials have shown positive results with (1) chemical and (2) radioactive synovectomy. (1) Setti et al. treated 53 patients with rifampicin RV (600 mg intra-articular injections weekly for approximately 6 weeks) with good results at 1 year follow-up. (2) Top and Cross used single doses of intra-articular radioactive gold in 18 patients with persistent effusions of mixed causes including 3 with IH. All 3 patients with IH responded well to treatment at one-year follow-up.  Prognosis  Once established, periods of remissions and relapse can persist indefinitely. While IH may remit spontaneously for most people the condition is long-lasting. Treatments as described above can be effective in reducing the frequency and degree of effusions. Deformative changes to joints are not a common feature of this mostly non-inflammatory condition.  Epidemiology  Intermittent hydrarthrosis is uncommon and its prevalence is not known. (In 1974 more than 200 cases were reported in published literature). It affects men and women equally although some publications suggest the condition is slightly more prevalent in females. Case reports indicate that only white people are affected. First onset of IH is most common between the ages of 20 and 50 years, and in females, onset can often coincide with puberty. Usually the condition begins spontaneously or following trauma to the joint in otherwise healthy individuals.  History  Perrin (France) is reported to have first recorded this condition in 1845. The periodic nature of infusions was noted by CH Moore (Middlesex Hospital, UK) in 1852. When the condition was first being reported in scientific journals, IH was classified as either ‚Äòsymptomatic‚Äô or ‚Äòidiopathic‚Äô (of unknown cause). The symptomatic state was associated with existing disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, other arthritis, or infection e.g. Brucellosis. With the idiopathic variant, an allergic component was believed to be involved since, in some patients at least, allergic phenomena (including cases of angioedema) were associated with episodes of inflammation. Rheumatoid disease did not develop in this latter variant. Today, a primarily auto-immune cause predominates literature with speculation that IH may be an inherited condition (see Causes). On the basis that IH is periodic in its presentation, early researchers proposed links with malaria where symptoms are also cyclical, even though the two have different duration cycles. Treatment with quinine (and arsenic) compounds were trialled with little benefit. Links to other infectious disease have also been posited over the years. These included Brucella, gonorrhoea, and syphilis. Adrenaline injections, mercury, various hormone treatments (ovarian extracts, growth hormone, stilboestrol), and ergotamine tartrate are among other treatments at some time used without significant or long-term benefit. Physiotherapy, surgery, exclusion diets (following allergen testing) have similarly shown no particular success in early reports of IH.

It was established on 1971 and it holds a collection of 65,000 reels of film.  History  The Cinema Museum of the City of Buenos Aires was created on October 1, 1971 from the film collection donated by the widow of researcher and collector Pablo C. Ducr√≥s Hicken. In its founding act, it defines the central objectives that remain to this day: to exhibit and preserve the objects that are part of its heritage and to increase the collection dedicated to Argentine cinema. In this way, the elements that the Museum of Cinema preserves are not only films, but also cameras, projectors, moviolas and other elements of cinematographic technique, which were added -from their beginnings- to pieces of costumes and sets, models, props, scripts, filming plans, production reports, newsletters, photographs, advertisements and reviews. The first director of the Museum was the critic and researcher Jorge Miguel Couselo, who was succeeded during the Military Coup by the critic Rolando Fusti√±ana (Roland), founder of the Cinemateca Argentina. Once the democratic order was restored, other directors were the critic and filmmaker Guillermo Fern√°ndez Jurado, the critic and researcher Jos√© Mar√≠a Poirier Lalanne and the documentary maker David Blaustein. Since 2008, its director is the researcher and specialist in audiovisual preservation Paula F√©lix-Didier. The museum previously operated in six places: Teatro General San Mart√≠n, the former Di Tella Institute, the Centro Cultural Recoleta, the Sarmiento building at 2500, Defensa street 1220, the old textile company Piccaluga building at Feij√≥o 525, that on August 1, 2011, the historic building of La Boca neighborhood in Caffarena 51, part of the former Compa√±ia Electrica Italo Argentina built in 1916, arrived at its current location. To this headquarters was added a few blocks, in 2013, another administrative technical headquarters -in Minister Brin 615-, which contains the deposits of film material and archive in general as well as the technical areas of film, conservation and cataloging of scripts and photographs .  Heritage  Since its foundation, under Ministry of Culture of the City of Buenos Aires, has been carrying out an important task of rescue, preservation, research and dissemination of the Argentine audiovisual heritage. Among other activities, the Museum organizes and projects film cycles and exhibitions; carries out projects destined to the enrichment and diffusion of the Argentine cinematographic culture; performs exchange programs with archives and museums in different countries; offers courses and workshops and provides support for research and teaching. The Museum develops its activities in two venues, both located in the neighborhood of La Boca: The headquarters-exhibition of Caffarena 51 is located in a historic building in La Boca, part of the former power plant of the Italo Argentina Electricity Company built in 1916. The renovated headquarters has an auditorium with capacity for 70 people and a cabin equipped for analogue and digital projection and will include among its programming the material of the film archive of the museum. This space incorporates an educational area for workshops and seminars and the new permanent exhibition ¬´Dream, dream¬ª. Located in Ministro Brin street 615, its archive-site contains a library and a video library open to the public, a film library that holds more than 90 thousand rolls of film in various formats and supports, several collections such as the 400 teams, mostly cameras and projectors, more than three thousand original posters of Argentine films, 360 sketches of scenery and costumes and 400 pieces of costumes used in Argentine films, along with around 60 thousand photographs of films and personalities of our cinema. The Museum, dedicated to preserving and disseminating Argentine cinema past and present, seeks to be an open space for research, education and artistic production.

For over five decades prior to the KMT‚Äôs arrival, Taiwan thrived as an industrialized country bolstered by an efficient Japanese infrastructure ‚Äî whereas China was poorer, and comprised mostly farmers ‚Äî therefore, leading to a conflicting clash of cultures. After the Japanese surrendered during the aftermath of WWII, the KMT took control of the island in 1945. Furthermore, after losing the Chinese Civil War to the Communists in 1949, the rest of the KMT escaped from the mainland en masse across the Taiwan Strait, establishing what is known today as the Republic of China on the island of Taiwan.

Before entering politics, he ran the general store in Jeparit, Victoria. He was the father of Robert Menzies, the longest-serving Prime Minister of Australia. Early life Menzies was born in Ballarat West, Victoria, one of the nine surviving children of Elizabeth (n√©e Band) and Robert Menzies. His parents were both Scottish immigrants, meeting soon after their arrival in Australia in 1854 and marrying the following year. His father ‚Äì born in Renfrewshire ‚Äì was drawn to Ballarat by the Victorian gold rush, and worked initially as a miner and later as a machinery salesman. His sudden death from pneumonia in 1879 thrust his family into poverty.Martin (1993), p. 3. Menzies had little formal schooling, but was a keen reader.Martin (1993), p. 12. At the time of his father's death, he had just begun an apprenticeship as a coach-painter. After a period as a journeyman, he was able to open his own coach-painting firm. One of his neighbours around that time was Hugh Victor McKay, the inventor of the Sunshine Harvester (the first commercially viable combine harvester). He painted McKay's first model, and some accounts credit him with suggesting the name \\"Sunshine\\". In the late 1880s, Menzies closed his own business and joined the Phoenix Foundry as its chief locomotive painter.Martin (1993), p. 4. In 1893, Menzies moved to the small Wimmera township of Jeparit, where he took over the general store that had previously been owned by his brother-in-law Sydney Sampson. The move was prompted by his desire to relocate to a warmer climate for health reasons, though it may have also been related to the ongoing banking crisis.Martin (1993), p. 5. Menzies and his family lived in quarters at the back of the store, which \\"survived rather than prospered\\". He looked after the grocery and saddlery, while his wife managed the millinery, drapery, and dressmaking sections. He supplemented the family's income by acting as an agent for insurance firms and stock and station agencies, and also made occasional hawking trips to remote outposts.Martin (1993), p. 7. Public life Menzies \\"occupied every presidential chair Jeparit had to offer, political, civic, social, and sporting\\", and endeared himself to the local farming community by extending generous lines of credit. He was a Methodist lay preacher, having previously been a Presbyterian elder in Ballarat.Martin (1993), p. 9. In 1898, he was elected to the Dimboola Shire Council, where served two terms as shire president. Both his older brother Hugh Menzies and brother-in-law Sydney Sampson preceded him into politics. At the 1911 state election, Menzies was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly standing in the district of Lowan. His candidacy was supported by the short-lived People's Party, which drew its support from rural areas.Martin (1993), p. 16. In parliament, he served on the vaccination, housing, and public accounts committees, and was chairman of the railways committee for two years. He generally supported the Liberal and Nationalist governments.James Menzies, Parliament of Victoria. Retrieved 13 April 2018. However, in 1916 he crossed the floor to vote against a government bill that would have mandated the closure of Victoria's Lutheran schools (which were primarily German- speaking). He was one of the few MPs to speak out against the discrimination against German-Australians that was widespread during the war, stating that he knew many of the Germans in his constituency from his previous business dealings and that he could vouch for their character. Menzies was re-elected to Lowan unopposed in 1914 and 1917, but at the 1920 election lost to the Victorian Farmers' Union candidate, Marcus Wettenhall. He made unsuccessful attempts to reclaim his seat in 1921, losing by only 25 votes, and in 1924. Later years Menzies lived permanently in Melbourne after 1912; his family had relocated there in 1909, to advance the children's education.Martin (1993), pp. 16‚Äì17. He joined BHP as a statistical officer and tariff adviser in 1926, and also served on the executive of the Australian Industries Protection League. Menzies was a long-serving member of the Council of Agricultural Education, including as chairman from 1932 to 1934. He was also president of the Minton Boys' Home in Frankston for 20 years. In 1943, it was renamed in his honour as the Menzies Home for Boys; it later evolved into an organisation called Menzies: Caring for Kids, which continues to work with young people but no longer maintains residential facilities.The Menzies Home for Boys (1943 - 1961), Find & Connect. Retrieved 13 April 2018. Grave of James and Kate Menzies at Box Hill Cemetery. Menzies died at his home in Kew on 1 November 1945, aged 83. His funeral was held at Kew Presbyterian Church and he was buried in Box Hill Cemetery.Menzies, James (1862‚Äì1945), Obituaries Australia. Retrieved 13 April 2018. Personal life On 25 December 1889, Menzies married Kate Sampson (1865‚Äì1946), the daughter of a Cornish miner who had settled in Creswick. The couple would have five children together: James Leslie (called \\"Les\\"; b. 1890), Frank Gladstone (b. 1892), Isabel Alice (\\"Belle\\"; b. 1893), Robert Gordon (\\"Bob\\" or \\"Rob\\"; b. 1894), and Sydney Keith (b. 1905). The first three were born in Ballarat and the last two in Jeparit. Robert became the longest-serving Prime Minister of Australia, while Frank was Crown Solicitor for Victoria and Isabel managed the Royal Exhibition Building. Menzies's children remembered him as a strict disciplinarian who had high expectations for his children.Martin (1993), p. 11. In his memoir Afternoon Light, Robert recalled him as: > ...a strongly built man of little more than medium height. His hair was > prematurely grey, and became a splendid silver. He had a fairly full > moustache, in which he took some pride. The nervous tension which he had > tended to make him both dogmatic and intolerant; in a very modified sense, a > \\"Barrett of Wimpole Street\\". His temper was quick.

He is best known for his collaboration with Constance Naden on their philosophical theory called hylo-idealism. Army career Robert Lewins was a Surgeon Lieutenant Colonel who served with the 63rd Regiment in the Crimean War and the Indian Mutiny among other campaigns.McCrie, George M.\\"In Memoriam - Robert Lewins, M.D.\\", The Open Court, 22 August 1895. Retrieved on 4 February 2016. According to his obituary in the British Medical Journal, Lewins was also 'in the expedition to the north of China in 1865 in charge of the hospital ship Mauritius, and was present at the capture of the Taku Forts, receiving the medal'.\\"Navel and Military Medical Services\\", The British Medical Journal, 10 August 1895. Philosophical career Upon retiring to England in 1868, Lewins turned his attention to propounding his atheist philosophy. In 1877, he published Life and Mind; on the Basis of Materialism. This work was reviewed favourably in The Secular Review by G. W. Foote, who wrote that it was an 'excellent little essay\\" containing \\"valuable information on the pathology of religious excitement\\".\\"Review: Life and Mind; on the Basis of Materialism\\", Secular Review, 11 August 1877. Initially called Hylo-Zoism, it became Hylo-Idealism upon collaboration with Constance Naden. Other adherents during the 1880s were Herbert Courtney, George M. McCrie, and ‚ÄòJulian‚Äô (E. Cobham Brewer's pseudonym). He published numerous pamphlets on the subject, as well as being a prolific correspondent in certain quarters of the periodical press - including Knowledge, Journal of Science, Secular Review - during the latter decades of his life. The clearest articulation of his ideas (which were often expressed using jargon and obscure phrases) can be found in Humanism versus Theism; or Solipsism (Egoism) = Atheism. In a series of letters by Robert Lewins M.D. (London: Freethought Publishing Company, 1887). Friendship with Constance Naden From their first meeting 1876 until Naden's death in 1889, Lewins and Naden had a close intellectual friendship. In the early years Lewins encouraged Naden to study German and the natural sciences. The development of their intellectual relationship can be partially traced in the letters Lewins wrote to Naden between November 1878 and February 1880, which were edited and published in 1887, with a preface by Naden, as Humanism versus Theism. The went on to work together as peers on their atheist philosophy, Hylo-Idealism, which endeavoured to use scientific knowledge to show that the universe is best explained through a synthesis of materialism and (non-spiritual) idealism. Marion Thain has described how 'what appealed to Naden, came in key part from his poetic ability to elevate monistic theories of life through his rhetoric [... Naden] shares Lewins‚Äô desire to imbue her monism with the same sense of wonder and power which people have traditionally found in religion.' After Naden's death in December 1889, Lewins rapidly commissioned a memorial bust for Mason Science College, which is now housed in the University of Birmingham's Cadbury Research Library reading room. He also contributed to Constance Naden: A Memoir, a volume authored by four of her friends; Lewins' chapter focuses entirely upon explaining their shared philosophical ideals rather than recounting memories of Naden.Hughes, W.

The hall was in the premises of Burroughes & Watts Ltd., who had been at 19 Soho Square since 1836. Burroughes & Watts opened a new billiards saloon in 1903, known as the Soho Square Saloon. This was re-opened as the Soho Square Hall in 1904 and was renamed Burroughes Hall in 1913. In 1967, control of Burroughes & Watts Ltd. was taken over by a group of property developers. The assets included 19 Soho Square, which was demolished and replaced by a modern office block. In 1919 Burroughes & Watts opened a second London match-room in Piccadilly, generally called the New Burroughes Hall. This venture was not a financial success and the new venue closed in 1925. During this period, the hall in Soho Square was sometimes known as the Old Burroughes Hall. Snooker Before World War I, Burroughes & Watts organised an annual professional billiards 'London tournament'. This was a handicapped American tournament played at Soho Square Hall. In four tournaments, from 1907/08 to 1910/11, a snooker competition was arranged in parallel to the billiards. This generally consisted of a frame of snooker played at the end of each session of billiards. Soho Square Hall was also the venue of one of the earliest professional snooker matches, hosting a match of 101 frames between John Roberts and Tom Reece from 25 May to 6 June 1908. The match was for ¬£100, ¬£50 for the player winning most frames and ¬£50 for the player winning most aggregate points. Roberts won both prizes, winning 54¬Ω frames to 46¬Ω and 5,529 points to 5,209. Roberts made a break of 73, equalling a recently set record by James Harris. Burroughes Hall was sometimes used as the venue for the final of the English Amateur Championship from 1920 to 1962. In the 1920s and 1930s Thurston's Hall in Leicester Square was generally preferred for important professional matches but Burroughes Hall was occasionally used, hosting matches in the 1936 World Snooker Championship and the 1939/1940 Daily Mail Gold Cup when matches were played at the two venues simultaneously. After World War II, the hall was again used for World Championship matches in 1947 and 1951 as well as for the qualifying competition in 1946, 1947 and 1951. After the closure of Thurston's Hall in early 1955, Burroughes Hall was a regular venue for the News of the World Snooker Tournament until the tournament ended in 1959. With the revival of the World Championship in a challenge format in 1964, the hall was used for the first three matches in April 1964, October 1964 and March 1965.

The church is also called the Church of the Terrasanta (Holy Land), in honour to the first missionary priests who officiated Mass returning from Palestine. The church is part of the properties protected by the Superintendent of Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism (Italy).  History and Description  Father Giacomo Viale, who was the parish priest of Bordighera, was a Franciscan priest. One of his wishes was to build a church in the new area of the city that had developed along the coast. At first he turned to the architect Alexander Cantu of Sanremo, but the project was stopped when the priest returned to the convent. In 1875, he came back to Bordighera, enlisted the help of the architect Charles Garnier for the realization of his ambitious project. The land to build the church was donated by Mr. Francesco Moreno, well known for his beautiful gardens, the Moreno Gardens. The first draft plan of Garnier is dated 30 June 1882. Garnier liked to say that: It is probably because of this conviction that he decided to design a church typical of the mendicant orders of the Palestine (region). Then he designed a single nave, divided into three pillars that carry bows with large side windows. The facade which included a mosaic decoration was enriched with additional mosaics and the quotation Hic Domus Dei Oriente. The fa√ßade is also framed by two lateral towers, a porch that rests on a base of Turbie stone. Behind the church one can admire the bell tower that is inspired by the towers which Garnier used in the villa built on the coast for his clients. On 14 January 1883, the bishop, Monsignor Tommaso Reggio, inaugurated the project by blessing the foundation stone and works could begin. Father Giacomo Viale asked if the Mission of the Holy Land wished to send its missionaries returning from Palestine back to Bordighera first, to allow them an easier return. In 1885 the first missionaries, with health problems, began to arrive in the city and settled in the church, returning the hospitality by officiating Mass. On 14 February 1886, the bishop consecrated the church and dedicated it to the Immaculate Conception, but the church was not yet complete. The son of Charles Garnier, Christian, decided, when his father died, to finance personally and with the help of his mother, the end of the works. The bell tower was completed in 1899 and the interior decorations in 1902. They are by Marcel Jambon and by the Parisian Poinsot who painted the inside of the dome above the altar. Inside the church is also a painting depicting The Deposition by the Belgian painter Jules Pierre van Biesbroeck of Ghent and a painting by Giuseppe Balbo The death of Saint Joseph . Unfortunately in 1906 and in 1963, some additional works modified the initial design altering its consistency. The church is part of the properties protected by the Superintendent of Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism (Italy).

It is a mallee or shrub with smooth bark, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds with an elongated horn-shaped operculum, greenish-yellow flowers and cup-shaped or bell-shaped fruit. Flower budsFlowersFruit Description Eucalyptus burdettiana is a mallee or shrub that typically grows to a height of , forms a lignotuber and has smooth, brownish and dark orange bark. Young plants and coppice regrowth have triangular to egg-shaped leaves arranged alternately along the branches, long and wide and always have a petiole. Adult leaves are lance-shaped, long, wide on a petiole long and are the same glossy green on both sides. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven, nine or eleven on a flattened, often downturned peduncle long. The individual buds are sessile. The mature buds are cylindrical, long and wide with the operculum three to four times as long as the floral cup. The fruit is a woody, cup-shaped to bell-shaped capsule long and wide on a spreading or downturned peduncle. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus burdettiana was first formally described by William Blakely and Henry Steedman in 1939 and the description was published in Contributions from the New South Wales National Herbarium from specimens collected by Steedman on stony outcrops of Mount Barren near Hopetoun in 1938. The specific epithet (burdettiana) honours William Burdett (1871-1940) who was a friend of Henry Steedman. Distribution and habitat Burdett gum is found on quartzite ridges and rocky areas of the Barren Range in the Fitzgerald River National Park where it grows in sandy soils. The only remaining population is composed of 140 plants split into five sub-populations. Conservation This eucalypt is classified as \\"endangered\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and as \\"Threatened Flora (Declared Rare Flora ‚Äî Extant)\\" by the Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia). The main threat to the species is inappropriate fire regimes.

She later assumed the religious name of \\"Maria Teresa of Jesus\\" upon making her profession and in dedication to Saint Teresa of √Åvila. Scrilli became a noted educator and opened several schools during her lifetime in which she taught a range of religious and secular topics to girls. A period of anti-clericalism forced her to disband her schools and orders until a long while later when she could reinstitute her order and new schools. She was also known for her compassionate treatment of the poor and also for her enlightened views of a fundamental Christian education. Pope Benedict XVI recognized a miracle attributed to her direct intercession in 2005 and allowed for her beatification in Fiesole on 8 October 2006; Cardinal Jos√© Saraiva Martins presided over the Mass on the behalf of the pope. Life Maria Scrilli was born in 1825 as the second child into a household that was one of the most visible in the Italian nation. Her parents wanted a male heir and so her mother was quite indifferent to Scrilli during her childhood. A serious illness during her adolescence confined her to her bed for eighteen months and she was healed - in what was ruled to be a miracle. Her long convalescence solidified her belief that she was being called to serve God and to that end decided to enter a Carmelite convent on 28 May 1846 - Santa Maria Maddalenz de' Pazzi - despite the protests of her parents who objected this path for their daughter. She spent two months before going back home upon the realization that the cloistered life - which she loved - was not for her; she went back home to discern the will of the Lord. Scrilli opened a small school for the education of girls and was noted for her enlightened views of a religious education. The Chief Magistrate and the Superintendent of Schools were so impressed with her work that - on 3 May 1842 - tasked her with running another that was larger than the one she operated and worked at. It was around this time she began to establish her own congregation and she obtained the approval of the local bishop on 15 October 1854 as well as the approval of the Grand Duke of Tuscany Leopold II of Habsburg. She established the Sisters of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and assumed the new name of \\"Maria Teresa of Jesus\\"; this was a name that she took to honor fellow Carmelite Saint Teresa of √Åvila. She established a private school around this same time but it faced closure along with her other schools and the congregation itself on 30 November 1859 during the intense political period of anti-clericalism. Once that period eased she moved to Florence on 18 March 1878 and reestablished her schools and order with the permission of the Archbishop of Florence Eugenio Cecconi. Scrilli died on 14 November 1889. =Legacy= New houses of her congregation were opened in 1919 and the order would receive the pontifical approval of Pope Pius XI on 27 February 1933. The congregation now operates in the United States of America and in other places such as Canada and the Philippines. Beatification Tomb. The beatification proceedings opened in Fiesole and received the approval of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints under Pope John Paul II on 3 November 1988 which granted her the title Servant of God; what followed was a diocesan process that evaluated her life and her works as well as to ascertain how she lived a model life of virtue to a high standard. The process was decreed to be valid on 29 May 1992 and allowed for the postulation to compile and submit the Positio to Rome in 1996; it was at once relegated to the historical commission which met and gave its approval to the cause and its continuation on 26 November 1996. John Paul II declared that Scrilli had indeed lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue on 20 December 2003 and so conferred upon her the title of Venerable. The miracle needed for beatification was investigated on a diocesan level and was validated as being a valid and thorough investigation on 22 May 1998. The miracle received the papal approval of Pope Benedict XVI on 19 December 2005 and allowed for her beatification to take place. Cardinal Jos√© Saraiva Martins presided over the beatification on 8 October 2006 on the behalf of the pope. The current postulator of the cause is Vincenzo Mosca, O.Carm.

Unusually as an owner, he also interested himself directly in the design of ships. He was president of the Institute of Marine Engineers. The company, usually simply referred to as Dennys, had the highest output and tonnage of any of the Clyde shipbuilders, ranking them as one of the world‚Äôs largest companies at that time. Glasgow University award an Archibald Denny Prize annually to the best Naval Architecture student. This was granted in 1912 during Denny's lifetime, and the prize includes money intended for foreign travel. Life Denny was born on 7 February 1860, the fourth son of Peter Denny FRSE of Denny Brothers, shipbuilders in Dumbarton, and his wife Helen Leslie. The family was enormously rich being involved in the then (19th century) very safe industry of shipbuilding. His early education was at Dumbarton Burgh School. In 1874 he was sent to Lausanne in Switzerland to complete his education at a private school.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: Archibald Denny Unlike his brothers, Archibald felt a need to stimulate his mind, whilst still involving himself in the family business. He therefore went to London to engage in specific training as a naval architect at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. This brought a \\"hands-on\\" relationship between shipyard owner and design. He brought a practicality to designs, often absent in competitors, setting them up well for the more commercial elements of ship design. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography summarised this as \\"technical excellence\\". In 1883 the ownership of the family shipbuilders passed to Archibald (aged only 23). In the same year Archibald took over the shipyard in Leven, Fife, and introduced the world‚Äôs first hydromechanical experimentation laboratory: including a large tank for testing the properties of model ships. In 1885 he brought in John Ward to assist in the management, and in 1895 a cousin, Col Leslie Denny. Under Archibald‚Äôs control the company began to specialise in ferries and refrigerated ships (Reefer ships). In 1905 the company further broadening seeking and gaining lucrative Admiralty contracts for torpedo-boats, submarines, destroyers and hospital ships. One branch of the company also began building military fighter aircraft. Denny in 1897 In 1894 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were John Henderson, Sir John Murray, Alexander Buchan, and Alexander Crum Brown. He was awarded honorary doctorates (LLD) from both Glasgow University (in 1911) and Cambridge University (in 1927). He was created First Baron of Dumbarton in 1913.https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf He was a keen military volunteer and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel in first the Dunbartonshire Volunteers then the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. From 1903 to 1905 Denny was president of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland. In 1912 he was appointed onto the investigatory committee set up by the Board of Trade on the Titanic disaster which had sent shock waves through the shipbuilding world. The committee did not reach any final conclusions until 1915. He thereafter represented Britain at the International Conference on the Safety of Life at Sea. In 1918 the company became a limited company, William Denny and Brothers Ltd. After a slight dip in orders from 1920 to 1923, things revived with further work from the Admiralty and from Canadian Pacific. Commercial production drifted from ferries to cargo-liners. In 1921 he moved to London to look after the company‚Äôs shipping interests in that city. He died in London on 29 May 1935. Family He was married to Margaret Tulloch, daughter of John Tulloch, in 1885. They lived at Braehead House in Dumbarton. They had five sons and one daughter. Their eldest son, Maurice Edward Denny (1886‚Äì1965) took partnership in William Denny and Brothers in 1911. On the death of his father Archibald he became the 2nd Baronet. Their other children were: William Murray Denny (1887‚Äì1914); Eileen Margaret Denny (born 1891); Peter Archibald Denny (1892‚Äì1938); James Murray Tulloch Denny (born 1896); and Walter Brock Denny (1898‚Äì1902).

Verified aircraft collisions ;21 September 2017: A civilian UAV collided with a Black Hawk helicopter in the evening over the eastern shore of Staten Island, New York City, United States. The helicopter was one of two with the 82nd Airborne Division flying out of Fort Bragg on duty for the United Nations General Assembly. The helicopters were able to continue flying and landed at Linden Airport. Nobody was hurt, but part of the UAV was found at the bottom of the main rotor system. :In December 2017 the National Transportation Safety Board issued an accident report into the collision, finding the pilot of the UAV at fault. The UAV operator deliberately flew the UAV 2.5 miles away from himself and was unaware of the helicopters' presence. The operator did not know of the collision until contacted by the NTSB and when interviewed by them showed only a general cursory awareness of the regulations. There was also a Temporary flight restriction in place, which allowed the Black Hawk but not the UAV. UAVs are prohibited from flying beyond line of sight under FAA regulations. ;12 October 2017: A Beech King Air A100 of Skyjet Aviation collided with a UAV as the former was approaching Jean Lesage Airport near Quebec City, Canada. The aircraft landed safely despite being hit on the wing. The aircraft had flown from Rouyn-Noranda Airport to Rouyn-Noranda Airport with six passengers and two crew. A spokeswoman for Quebec City Police said that neither the UAV or operator had been found. It had been flying at 1500 feet ‚Äì five times the maximum altitude that UAVs are permitted to fly in Canada. Regulations banning flying of UAVs near airports had been introduced earlier in 2017. Minister of Transport Marc Garneau released a statement saying \\"Although the vast majority of drone operators fly responsibly, it was our concern for incidents like this that prompted me to take action and issue interim safety measures restricting where recreational drones could be flown. I would like to remind drone operators that endangering the safety of an aircraft is extremely dangerous and a serious offence.\\" ;10 August 2018: A hot air balloon carrying a certified pilot and two passengers was struck by a drone while flying near the Teton County Fairgrounds in Driggs, Idaho, United States. The drone fell to earth and was destroyed after its rotors were sheared off by contact with the balloon's envelope and load lines; the balloon suffered no significant damage and landed safely with no injuries to the pilot or passengers. The inexperienced hobbyist drone operator reportedly lost sight of the balloon in the aircraft's monitor and was operating within 5 mi (8 km) of Driggs‚ÄìReed Memorial Airport without notifying air traffic control, a violation of Federal Aviation Regulations; the balloon pilot had relied on radio communication with nearby manned aircraft and air traffic control to avoid other air traffic. The balloon pilot chose to report the incident to the National Transportation Safety Board in lieu of notifying the local sheriff's department, stating that she \\"[hopes] this incident helps create a conversation of respect for nature, the airspace, and rules and regulations.\\" The incident is currently under investigation. This is the first-ever recorded mid-air collision between a UAV and a hot air balloon. Alleged aircraft collisions ;17 April 2016: The pilot of British Airways flight BA727 reported a collision with a UAV to Metropolitan Police. The Airbus A320 was approaching Heathrow Airport when the collision happened. None of the 132 passengers or 5 crew were injured. After an inspection by engineers, the aircraft was cleared to take off for its next flight. :Members of the British government as well as the Labour Party and BALPA called for urgent action, including a register of drone users and geo- fencing of airports. :In late April 2016 Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin told MPs that experts believed that the incident was not related to UAVs. There was no damage to the aircraft and it wasn't clear if it was a plastic bag rather than a UAV. An investigation by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch had been closed due to lack of evidence. Police had searched a \\"wide area\\" of Richmond and found nothing. ;13 December 2018: The crew of an Aerom√©xico Boeing 737-800 operating as Flight 773 heard a \\"pretty loud bang\\" on approach to Tijuana International Airport, and after a safe landing, the nose of the aircraft was found to be damaged.

A Transport Canada spokesman said his department and the RCMP were investigating. ;July 2016:Edmonton police helicopter Air 1 was responding to a call downtown when the pilot saw a white quadcopter with red lights approaching. A flight crew member said that a collision \\"could have been catastrophic and potentially fatal for both crew members of Air 1\\". Transport Canada had been made aware of the incident and Edmonton Police Service said there was a criminal investigation into the events as well as possible charges under the Aeronautics Act. =China= In January 2017 a 23 year old UAV operator from Xiaoshan was detained because of footage taken from a drone flying near airliners descending to land at Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport. The incident came to light when footage was uploaded to QQ. This was an eight-second clip from a ten-minute recording taken from an altitude of 450m. The operator had flown it to photograph a sunset, but had also recorded several airliners flying past. The model used was a DJI Mavic and the manufacturer strongly condemned the incident. =France= ;February 2016: A UAV came within 5m of an Air France A320 flight from Barcelona to Charles de Gaulle Airport. The aircraft was at an altitude of 1600m when the pilot saw the UAV to the planes' port, disengaged the autopilot and took evasive action.

The pilots spotted the UAV as the aircraft was at a point in its descent where it was not possible to take evasive action and they initially feared it would be sucked into an engine. Flight NZ92, which flew from Tokyo to Auckland, was unharmed. The identity of the UAV controller is unknown. Air New Zealand called for tougher laws to prevent reckless use of UAVs near airports and prison terms for operators who endanger lives. Under current laws operators who breach Civil Aviation Rules can be fined up to NZ$5000. =Poland= ;21 July 2015: A Lufthansa plane landing at Warsaw Chopin Airport nearly collided with a drone. The drone came in within 100 m of the plane, at an altitude of 760 m, 5 km away from the airport, near Piaseczno. = United Kingdom = ;October 2014:It was reported that a UAV had flown within 25 metres of an ATR 72 passenger airliner on 30 May 2014. The aircraft was approaching London Southend Airport and about to intercept the ILS glide slope when the copilot reported seeing a small craft flying about 100 m to the right of the aircraft. The copilot and Air Traffic Controller agreed it was probably a quadcopter ‚Äì it was seen flying as close as 25 m to the aircraft. Southend ATC couldn't detect the craft on radar ‚Äì subsequent examination of radar from other sites produced several brief but inconclusive radar signals. Police were contacted, but the operator of the UAV could not be found. ;December 2014:Investigators confirmed that they were investigating claims that a UAV came about 20 feet of an Airbus A320 landing at Heathrow on 22 July. The A320 was 700 feet from landing when the craft passed 20 feet over the left wing of the aircraft ‚Äì they did not collide. Despite an investigation and cooperation of remote-control model aircraft club members, the operator of the aircraft could not be identified. The incident was given an A rating, meaning that there had been a serious risk of collision. ;April 2015:A Westland Lynx flying over Hambrook had to take evasive action to avoid a UAV that passed one rotor span from the side of the helicopter. ;June 2015:An autogyro flying over Detling, Kent encountered a UAV at an altitude of 450 metres. The UAV was 20m from the autogyro and the pilot considered the risk of collision high. ;July 2015:Both crew members of an RJ1 saw a UAV at an altitude of 1200m over Detling, Kent. As it would not be visible from the ground, the United Kingdom Airprox Board concluded that it was impossible for it to be flown legally under those circumstances. ;July 2015:A BE200 aircraft approaching Southampton Airport when a UAV passed within two wing lengths of it. Investigators concluded that chance played a large role in the vehicles not colliding. ;July 2015:A Dornier 328 was on final approach to Manchester Airport at 850m when a blue UAV was spotted. Investigators concluded that the UAV was not permitted to be in that space. ;September 2015:A Boeing 737 had a near miss shortly after takeoff from London Stansted Airport, leaving the pilot no time to react. ;September 2015:A UAV came within 20m of an Embraer 170 over the Houses of Parliament as the latter aircraft was on approach to London City Airport. ;September 2015:Shortly after a Boeing 777 had taken off from Heathrow Airport, a UAV passed within 25 metres of the jet at the same height. ;September 2015:An Airbus A319 was landing at Heathrow Airport at 150m when a UAV was seen about 23m to the left and 6m above the airliner. ;October 2015:A Dornier 328 was taking off from Manchester Airport when a UAV passed 15m from the left wing tip when the latter was at 900m, leading the pilot to conclude there was a high risk of collision. ;October 2015:A Piper PA-28 Cherokee was flying near Otherton Airfield, Staffordshire, when a UAV passed about 6m from the wing tip. ;March 2016:BALPA called for tests to determine the possible outcomes of UAVs colliding with passenger aircraft. ;August 2016: An East Anglian Air Ambulance Eurocopter EC145 narrowly avoided a collision with a drone over north London at 7:45PM on August 26. The drone passed within 30m of the air ambulance and was seen by the crew. Investigators found there was a high risk of the helicopter and UAV coming into contact, endangering the helicopter. The UAV was also being operated over a built-up area without Civil Aerial Authority permission and the incident was classed in the highest risk category, A. Prince William regularly flies the helicopter but was not on duty at the time of the incident. ;November 2016: An EasyJet aircraft landing at Edinburgh Airport narrowly avoided colliding with a UAV flying at the same altitude by 23m. The Airprox Board said a collision had only been avoided \\"by providence\\". ;May 2017: A Loganair flight descending into Edinburgh Airport had to take evasive action when the crew saw a UAV about 20-30m from the aircraft at an altitude of 4,000 feet. The flight from Shetland landed safely. Police believe the UAV was operated from Bathgate or Armadale. ;3 July 2017: Gatwick Airport closed its runway because of a UAV flying nearby. The runway was closed for one period of nine minutes, then another of five minutes. EasyJet said four of its flights were diverted and British Airways said one of its flights had been diverted to Bournemouth. Sussex Police are investigating. ;9 July 2017: An Airbus 319 was preparing to land when a UAV appeared and flew over the aircraft's starboard wing. The UAV was initially thought to be a bird, appearing as a small dark object due to twilight conditions at 20:35 BST. At the closest point of approach, the drone appeared between the wing tip and fuselage, above the starboard wing. The aircraft landed safely and Gatwick Airport police were involved. A UK Airprox Board report into the incident said there was a high risk of collision and that \\"A larger aircraft might not have missed it and in the captain's opinion, it had put 130 lives at risk.\\". The report also said the UAV was \\"very large, certainly not a toy\\", had four blades and estimated that the drone was about three metres across. The report said that the estimated distance and pilots' inability to avoid the UAV \\"portrayed a situation where providence had played a major part\\" in avoiding an accident. Former pilot Stephen Landells said it was a \\"worrying near-miss that could have ended in tragedy\\". Mr Landells also said that BALPA wanted to see details of proposed legislation for drone registration and a timeline for said registration. ;19 December 2018: A repeated deliberate intrusion of UAVs of \\"industrial specifications\\" occurred at Gatwick, the nation's second busiest airport. Sightings of UAVs over the runway caused a suspension of all takeoffs and landings starting at 9:03 P.M. on 19 December. Flights were briefly resumed early the following morning, but were again suspended upon further UAV sightings. Over 700 flights and 110,000 passengers were affected; incoming aircraft being diverted as far away as Paris. The airport's closure came during the particularly busy holiday season. A man and a woman were arrested in connection with the incident. They were later released without charge. =United States= ;March 2013:An Alitalia pilot on final approach to runway 31 right at John F. Kennedy International Airport reported seeing a small UAV near his aircraft. Both the FAA and FBI were reported to be investigating. ;22 March 2014:US Airways Flight 4650 nearly collided with a drone while landing at Tallahassee Regional Airport. The plane, a Bombardier CRJ200, was at an altitude of when it came dangerously close to the drone, described by one of the pilots \\"as a camouflaged F-4 fixed-wing aircraft that was quite small\\". Jim Williams, head of the UAV office at the Federal Aviation Administration, said: \\"The risk for a small [drone] to be ingested into a passenger airline engine is very real.\\" The Federal Bureau of Investigation was investigating the incident, which was the first known instance of a large airliner nearly colliding with a drone in the U.S. However, the authenticity of this report is under dispute. ;5 December 2015:A California Highway Patrol helicopter in Martinez, California was working with local police when they spotted the lights of a UAV. They were flying between seven and eight hundred feet and the UAV was about the same height. The helicopter banked to evade it, but the UAV passed by it. The helicopter followed the UAV to where it landed and called local police to find the operator. The CHP asked UAV operators to be careful about flying. The incident has been passed to the Federal Aviation Authority for investigation. According to the operator of the UAV, it was flying on autopilot because of a lost radio signal. The operator was cooperating with FAA, police and Caltrans and has offered an apology to the helicopter pilot. ;March 2016: A Lufthansa Airbus A380 reported a near miss as it approached Los Angeles International Airport. The airliner was at an elevation of 5000 feet and about 14 miles east of the airport when the UAV flew 200 feet over it. Police searched for the UAV pilot, though they admitted the search would be a long shot. ;2018: A video posted to YouTube showed footage from a UAV in midair above an Airbus 320 in Frontier Airlines livery. The airport was identified as McCarran International Airport and the UAV may have taken off from a parking lot near Whitney Mesa Nature Preserve to the east of the airport. Both The Academy of Model Aeronautics and Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International condemned the video. The Federal Aviation Authority is investigating the incident. Accidents and incidents UAVs have historically had a much higher loss rate than manned military aircraft. In addition to anti-aircraft weapons, UAVs are vulnerable to power and communications link losses. =Australia= ;October 2013:A UAV crash landed onto train tracks on the Sydney Harbour Bridge, where it was found and retrieved by a Sydney Trains conductor. Confused platform workers inspected the UAV, with concern that it may have been a weapon. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) started an investigation, and the police began searching for the pilot. The pilot was testing new UAV equipment when the camera mounting failed in mid-flight, and the UAV began to return to its GPS starting point. The UAV collided with the corner of a building and then a Sydney Harbour Bridge pylon, and the pilot presumed it to have been lost to the waters of Port Jackson. After seeing media stories of a \\"mystery drone\\" colliding with the nearby bridge, the pilot contacted aviation authorities and Sydney police. The police found the situation to be unsuspicious and returned the craft to the pilot. ;April 2014:A triathlete was injured in an incident involving a drone that was filming a race. She claimed that the drone collided with her and said \\"the ambulance crew took a piece of propeller from my head\\". The owner of the UAV claimed that the athlete had been injured when she was frightened by the falling UAV and tripped. Timing equipment caused interference with the operation of the UAV while it was close to people on the ground. In November 2014, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions stated that the evidence showed that the drone had crashed into the triathlete who sustained head injuries as a result. However taking into account the young age and antacedents of the drone operator the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions chose not to proceed with a charge against the operator and handed the matter back to CASA. CASA subsequently fined the operator $1,700 for flying the drone within 30 metres of people. ;February 2016:A recreational drone pilot crashed their drone, a DJI Phantom, during a ceremony at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. No one was injured. The drone reportedly landed near the Memorial's Director, and former defence minister, Brendan Nelson, who picked it up and subsequently handed it to security staff. Following a Civil Aviation and Safety Authority (CASA) investigation the drone pilot was fined $900, which according to a CASA spokesman, closed the matter. =Canada= ;June 2016:Stephanie Creignou was attending a 5K run in Beloeil, Quebec when a DJI Phantom 3 fell and hit her on the head. She was taken to hospital where she was diagnosed with whiplash. As of 22 June she was still out of work and had had to cancel a holiday with her husband. Rosaire Turcotte, who operated the UAV that crashed, said he couldn't understand how it happened and that he'd acted safely. The incident was caught by a camera on a different UAV, one owned by VTOL-X drones, who had been hired to cover the event. Flavio Martenkowski, CEO of VTOL-X, said he's spoken to Turcotte about the danger of flying so near to a crowd just before the crash. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada has opened an investigation into the crash. =France= ;October 2013:A tourist was arrested in Paris and fined 400 euro for \\"operating an aircraft non-compliant with safety laws\\". ;October and November 2014:Unidentified UAVs were seen flying near 13 nuclear power plants.

It is a 172-foot-tall tower with a Roman numeral clock built in on each of the four sides of the tower. The top of the bell tower holds an observation area. It is topped by a conical spire structure. The area around the bell tower is surrounded by hedges and a grass lawn designed by a University botany professor Coker, who also designed the Coker Arboretum on campus. The tower is one of the most visible landmarks on campus. History The idea of erecting a bell tower on the University of North Carolina campus was originally suggested by John Motley Morehead III in the 1920s, but it was denied several times by the University because of conflicts regarding the location. When the idea was finally approved, the construction began with the funding of two sponsors, Morehead and Rufus Lenoir Patterson II. The tower was designed by McKim, Mead & White, an architectural firm. The tower was dedicated and received by Governor Oliver Max Gardner on Thanksgiving day of 1931 with an acceptance address. Belfry The belfry originally began with 12 manually operated bells made by Meneely Bell Foundry in 1931. It is currently equipped with 14 mechanized bells with the addition of 2 bells by Petit & Fritsen in 1998. The names of prominent figures in the University history, Governor John Motley Morehead and William Lenoir, are inscribed on the two largest bells. The bells ring every 15 minutes, chiming on the hour. In addition, the bells play other songs or the alma mater as part of University celebrations or holidays.

The temple is situated at Mudakkal, around 8 km north of Attingal in the Thiruvananthapuram district of Kerala. The temple enshrines a Krishna shila idol of the goddess Amunthirathamma, an incarnation of Bhadra Kali. Devi is in Ardha padmasana (a yoga poster), Andarmugha (thinking with closed eyes) and chathur bahu (four arms). History Amunthirathu 'madam' (joint family) is a sub family of Vanjipuzha madam which is a Brahmin madam believed to be existed before the period of Raja Rama Varma (Travancore raja of 1724-1729\\"Kerala\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc., 2013. Web. 22 Oct. 2013 .) in Chengannur, Alappuzha. As then, the shrine of every Brahmin madam holds many Nair prominent and it holds many other cast groups under. At the beginning of the 17th century according to historians, within this small Travancore royal state, the power of the chief was only nominal, due to the power of the nobles, chief among them being the Barons of the Eight Houses (Pillaimar) and the barons (Matampimar). The powers of the ruler were also to a great extent curbed by the power of the Council of Eight and a Half (Yogakkar), the managing committee of Padmanabhaswamy Temple, Trivandrum. Travancore nobles were opposed to adoption made by the ruler in 1718 and out of fear for her life, the princess (who was the adopted sister of Marthanda Varma), was living in exile at Harippad with her four-year-old son (who grew up to be Dharma Raja). In the year 1728 the princess received news that the Ettuveetil Pillamar had despatched a band of soldiers to assassinate her and the little prince. She decided to seek refuge with the Vanjipuzha Thampuran of Vanjipuzha madam, the Brahmin Rajah of Chengannur, where she would be safe. In coordination with the princess's husband, the Kilimanoor Koil Thampuran, the Valiyamma provided an escort until Chengannur. She personally travelled with the princess and her presence of mind and the bravery of the Koil Thampuran helped save the lives of the princess and her son. The rivalries of European powers like the Dutch and the English made the situation more complex.Menon, A. Sreedhara. A Survey Of Kerala History DC Books (2007) In the year 1729-1758 Anizham Thirunal Marthanda varma become the Travancore raja and he fought against these noble aristocracies existed then in Travancore. But due to the opposition of the nobles, Marthanda Varma had to flee the capital for the safety of places such as Kottarakara (Kollam) and Kayamkulam (Alappuzha), where he is narrated by historians, to have lived in difficulty for many years, travelling from one place to another to escape his political enemies. Marthanda varma made intimate relations with Vanjipuzha thampuran for helping his sister and son-in-law. By political moves Marthanda varma gain victory over the nobles in travancore and bring his sister and son- in-law to Attingal palace which was considered as the ancestral homes of Travancore royals. The Queendom of Attingal favours Devi (female god) worship rather than deva (male god) and the queenly state is rich in Devi temples and Ammachi veedu (where the home was ruled by a grand female). Marthanda varma in 1727 brought seven Vanjipuzha madam sub-Brahmin families including Amunthirathu madam from Chengannur who were from the priest line of Chengannur Mahadeva temple and give property in and around Trivandrum. This was also a political move against the then existed Nair-Brahmin equity of Travancore including the Eight Houses (Pillaimar) and the council of eight and a half (Yogakkar). Nair cast are often brought out as the soldiers to the Queendom of Attingal and Kingdom of Travancore and it is very common to practice kalari marshal art associated with every Brahmin madam. Brahmins of Amunthirathu madam are the favorite to the king and are given property near to the Attingal palace (Keezhatingal, Otoor) they also hold a 'Kalari bhagavathi- bhadra kali' which is made of a gold oar \\"Salagramam\\" and they do daily offerings to the goddess. The idol was also believed to be worshiped by Marthanda Varma during his life of difficulties. Apart from Brahmins, Nairs are the only permitted group for worship due to the racial discrimination existed then. In the same period another Brahmin madam called ‚ÄòKallara madam‚Äô which was also one among from the seven was given property at 'Alankaravattom' in the same 'Attingal maharajyam', (in August 1925 the ‚ÄòVillage Panchayat Regulation - VII‚Äô (1100 Malayalam Era) named the region as Mudakkal in chirayankezhu thaluk of Thiruvananthapuram District). Both these Brahmin families have some properties in both the place of Kezhattingal and Mudakkal. Kallara madam also holds a Devi worship of their own and this was meant for upanayana and other Brahmin rituals. From Old words, it was noted that Kallara madam generates some land and property issues against Amunthirathu madam and hinder agricultural practices. Finally, they were believed to mutually exchange some part of their share without any conflict and start to do harvest festivals. It is believed that the 7 day festival of both the madam temples were practiced at one time and has some relation. It was heard that lord Shiva come from the nearby Aayiravalli temple on elephant, first visit Kallara madam Devi but at that time the goddess was in her oestroal (Fertility) periods and represented by a white cloth dipped in red stain (Aratha vellam), Lord Shiva returned and Amunthirathu Devi welcomes him with all kinds of pleasure. This ritual in old time is called 'Naaipuu' and has many similarities with the 'Triputharattu' of Shakthi Peedam in Chengannur maha deva temple (from where the Brahmins are related in history). In the long run, Amunthirathu madam and Kallara madam have almost perished and the goddess was left without any worship and offerings for many years in an abandoned room of madam (Ara). For a short time, Amunthirathu Devi was also believed to be worshiped by the lower cast, and by this time the idol of 'salagramam' was lost, and the worship change to some weapons of the goddess. During the early 19th century Brahmins become a rare and minor group and by the amalgamation of Travancore with Attingal the mighty land holders- Nairs make benefit of property by agriculture and in the meantime many backward castes were zonalized for various activities and the groups start worshiping in their own means. After a long sleep, Amunthirathu devi was again worshiped by these groups headed by Nair community as 'Padkali' with many ritual practices as 'Thookam', 'Kuthiyottam', 'Kaapu kettu', 'Kuruthi','Palli Vaeta' etc. During this period the worship practice again shifted to a mirror. The goddess's favorite offering include 'Otada nivaedyam' and 'Kadum Payasa nivaedyam'. In the 1950s Kerala was at its maximum for the communist political wave and this was against the traditional rituals and practices. Kuzhakkadu Kunjan Pillai was the one who sternly stood against this and almost for two and a half decade he co-ordinates the annual Ten-day festival. In the year 1972 Adv. Bhuvana chandran Nair, Kuzhakkadu start the first official yogam for the temple and was the president till to his death (1983). In 1987 July Alamthara Sreedharan mesthiri Mark the devine place for the temple and in 1988 a temple was established (engineer: Kezhatingal Maniyan Mesthiri) and the ditty is Sree Bhadra Kali with Dwaja prathishta. During the temple formation Main priest (Thanthri) was Swamiyar madam Krishnan Potii and daily priest (Shanthi) was Kattaykalil madam Krishnan Potii. The idol was carved from Myladi, Tamil Nadu. In 1991 there was an attempt to do a rare worship practice called 'Kaliootu' but it was collapsed by a heavy rain though it was religiously completed and later advocated in 'Devapreshnam' (Astrological advice from God) to do only after the completion of Chutambalam. In 2005 the temple was registered as Trust (3195/05) under the leadership of the then president Sree Dharan Panaikkal and secretary Adv. Anirudhan Kuzhakkadu. By the 20th century, the temple had expanded with Navagraha prathishta (worship for eight planets and the sun) and Chutambalam. Peculiarities of idol Krishna Shila idol of the goddess Amunthirathamma‚Äì an incarnation of Bhadra Kali. Devi is in Ardha padmasana, Andarmugha and Chathur Bahu. The length of the idol is 48 angula (1 angula= 1.76 cm) where the unit, 4 represent the no of Vedas (knowledge) and the digit 8 represents the complete prosperity called Ashtaishwaryam (Dhanya= food, Dhana= wealth, Adhi= creation, Veera= Courage, Vijaya= Viictory, Sandhana= Motherly, Gaja= Power, Bhagya= Luck). Her right leg is in mooladhara and left on the lion symbolising Shanthi and courage for the same time. Her right hands hold Thrishoola and Nandhaka while the left hold chakra and Daruka shiras. Temple hold two upabimbas (subsidiary idols) of which one is sreebali vigraha (in standing posture) and the other similar to moola bimba. Moolabimba is dramshtradhara so it doesn't hold a pana pathra which is common in Kaali idols. She holds Simha vahana in idol and Vethala vahana in dwaja. Amunthirathu devi temple architecture The central sanctum (Sree Kovil) of Amunthirathu temple is in pandya kovil structure similar to many other Kannaki temples of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. It is surrounded by a cloistered prakara, pierced at one or more cardinal points with only a main entrance (gopuradwara). The cloistered prakaram has a namaskara mandapam located directly in front of the sanctum and is also an artistic excellence. Sree Kovil is surrounded by chutambalam. A kitchen is located in the south eastern corner of this cloistered chutambalam. The mukha mandapam is integrated with the gopura entrance is also a part of chutambalam. The flagstaff or dwaja stambham is located outside of the chutambalam. The balipitham is located in the mukhamandapam. The outer prakaram or courtyard houses other subshrines as Ganapathy, Nagar, Brahma rakshasu, Yogeeshwaran, Navagraha, and Madan thampuran. A temple tank is on the south east corner.

Careful technique can limit this risk, which ranges from less than 1% to about 10%. The precise risk of pneumothorax depends on technique and on underlying lung disease, as certain lung diseases such as COPD can increase the risk of pneumothorax. Pneumothorax sometimes requires tube thoracostomy. =Bleeding= Bleeding can be life-threatening and can occur in 1 to 4%.

Centered on the junction of Main, South, and North Streets, it exhibits a variety of commercial architectural styles from the early 19th to mid-20th century. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, and was enlarged in 2008. Description and history Bennington's historic downtown extends along United States Route 7 (North and South Streets), from Elm Street in the south to the Walloomsac River in the north, and along Vermont Route 9, from a short way west of its junction with US 7 to Silver Street. It includes a broad diversity of commercial, civic, and cultural buildings, dating mainly from the second quarter of the 19th century to the early 20th century. Prominent civic buildings are the town hall (an 1846 Greek Revival building), the county courthouse (1936, Colonial Revival), and the Old Bennington Post Office (1914, Classical Revival, now the police station). The town of Bennington is the largest town in southwestern Vermont, and is one of two shire towns of Bennington County. It has long been a civic and economic center of the region, and was the first town to receive an official charter in what is now the state of Vermont. That charter was issued in 1749 by Benning Wentworth, the colonial governor of New Hampshire, who sought to establish his province's claim to the area. The town's original center was on a nearby hill (at what is now called Old Bennington), and grew economically around a crossroads (now US 7 and VT 9). This area flourished in the 19th century because of the water power provided by the Walloomsac River to its industries, its rise in political importance cemented in the 1870s with the construction of a new courthouse. Bennington's industrial economic success continued in the 20th century, and the town retains an economically diversivied economy.

The work recounts Sattouf's childhood growing up in France, Libya and Syria in the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. The first volume of L'Arabe du futur won the 2015 Fauve d‚ÄôOr prize for best graphic novel at the Angoul√™me International Comics Festival. Sattouf's father influenced the title of the memoir through his ideal of raising his son as an \\"Arab of the future.\\" Early in the story, the elder Sattouf proclaims, \\"I'd change everything among the Arabs. I'd force them to stop being bigots, to educate themselves, and to enter into the modern world. I'd be a good President.\\" Purposefully written from the perspective of a child, Sattouf employs simplistic yet comprehensive drawings that are more rudimentary than, yet not entirely dissimilar to, his other works such as La vie secr√®te des jeunes, his column in the famous satirical French magazine Charlie Hebdo. Both The Arab of the Future and La Vie Secr√®te des Jeunes are written from Sattouf's point of view, with the former describing his childhood and the latter his daily observations as an adult. Although both appear autobiographical, at least one reviewer calls into question elements of Sattouf's life story and family history. In 2020, Sattouf announced the memoir's fifth volume was finished with only one extra volume pending before finalizing the saga.  Plot  = Vol. 1: 1978‚Äì1984 = The Arab of the Future begins in France, where Riad Sattouf is born in 1978. He describes himself as a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù little boy with \\"platinum-blonde hair\\" and ‚Äúbright puppy-dog eyes.‚Äù Riad is the eldest son of Cl√©mentine, a reserved French woman, and Abdul-Razak Sattouf, a flamboyant Sunni-Syrian man. They met when Cl√©mentine took pity on Abdul-Razak's clueless failure to attract a friend of hers. A major theme of the novel is how young Riad looks up to his father as a hero. Abdul-Razak, however, is portrayed as a complex character, being educated, ambitious and a loving father, yet also hypocritical, sexist, racist, and simultaneously authoritarian towards his wife and children yet almost infantile in his relationships with his mother and elder brother. Abdul-Razak appears particularly conflicted over religion; he prefers to describe himself as a secular modernizer (he drinks wine, eats pork, and does not pray) but he also exhorts his son to respect God and to learn to read the Qur'an, seemingly motivated by the pressure of his conservative family and Syrian society. With Cl√©mentine transcribing his words and \\"rendering them intelligible,\\" Abdul-Razak obtains a Ph.D. in history from the Sorbonne. In 1980, he moves the family to Libya after accepting a job as an associate professor. (He is paid in US dollars, with the funds sent to an account in the Channel Islands.) Prime Minister Muammar Gaddafi has abolished private property, meaning all unoccupied housing is free for the taking. This causes the Sattouf family to lose their first residence when a policeman's family claims it. They are forced to move into a large apartment block described as a \\"ghetto for expatriates.\\" Riad befriends with two neighbor children: Abani, an Indian girl, and Adnan, a Yemeni boy. Despite his very young age, Riad observes the propaganda of the Gaddafi regime and frequent food scarcity and rationing. The family remains in Libya for two years, during which Riad's grandmother and uncle visit them from Syria. When Gaddafi's state of the popular masses declares new laws requiring people of different social classes to swap occupations, Abdul-Razak fears losing his teaching job, and the family leaves Libya in 1982. The family returns to France for a short period. Riad meets his recently divorced, womanizing maternal grandfather, then they stay with Riad's grandmother in Brittany. She teaches him about the family's history and her own physically abusive grandmother. She draws parallels between the rural France of the past, exemplified by her elderly neighbor who lives in extremely rustic conditions, and the developing Arab world of the modern era. Riad attends the local kindergarten, where he is praised for his drawings of French president Georges Pompidou and a sculpture of a bull. While in France, Cl√©mentine gives birth to Riad's younger brother, Yahya. Abdul- Razak obtains a teaching job in Syria and the family moves to his hometown Teir Maalah, near Homs. Riad encounters severe bullying, in which two cousins accuse him of being Jewish and mercilessly torment him‚Äîseemingly because of his blond hair and foreign mother. The cousins' enmity appears to be entangled with a financial dispute between their father and Riad's father. Riad also witnesses strict segregation of genders and sects, media censorship, animal abuse, corruption, poor sanitation, and crippling poverty. Riad befriends Wael and Mohammad, two other cousins who teach him Syrian Arabic; they try to protect him from the two bullies, who are their uncles though around the same age. Riad observes the cult of personality surrounding Hafez al-Assad, who he sees as more sinister than Libya's Gaddafi. Abdul-Razak wants Riad to begin school, but Cl√©mentine fears he is too young‚Äîthen forbids it entirely after witnessing a group of boys torture and kill a puppy for sport. The Sattouf family returns suddenly to Brittany. Riad's grandmother has remarried and her new husband takes a liking to Riad. Riad is relieved and expects that the family will remain in France for good. The family travels to the Bailiwick of Jersey to retrieve Abdul-Razak's Libyan salary, in cash, from his offshore bank account. Riad becomes terrified when his father‚Äîwho now has money to build his dream villa‚Äîmakes plans to return to Syria, knowing that he will have to attend school there and face his bullies. = Vol. 2: 1984‚Äì1985 = The Sattouf family moves back to Teir Maalah in Syria, where Riad attends the local school. = Vol. 3: 1985‚Äì1987 = Abdul-Razak works as a professor in Syria. Among his students is one of the bodyguards of Hafez al-Assad. Cl√©mentine and the children travel to Brittany for her to give birth to her third child. After they return to Syrria, Abdul-Razak announces that he will begin a new job in Saudi Arabia. = Vol. 4: 1987‚Äì1992 = Cl√©mentine has refused to take the family to Saudi Arabia, so instead she and the children are living in Brittany without Abdul-Razak. He visits them, and together they all visit Syria again. By the end of the volume, tensions between Cl√©mentine and Abdul-Razak lead to their breakup. She remains in Brittany with the two older children while Abdul-Razak takes his youngest son to live with him in Syria.  Sensory symbolism  Sattouf employs a repeating pattern of color schemes throughout the comic. Basic line drawings are black and white, and a general color tint signifies the location of the events. Certain objects and speech bubbles have thematic coloring. Red is regularly applied to loud speech, danger and violence, while non-verbal noises (hisses and growls, for example) are green. France is tinted light blue, and its art and media (such as radio, photographs and sculpture) are colored bright red. Libya's panels are tinted mustard yellow, while bright green is applied to TV broadcasts, loud noises, Libyan flags, portraits of Muammar Gaddafi and, of course, Gaddafi's manifesto The Green Book. Syria is represented by light pink. Its electronic music and speech bubbles are green; red is applied to television and the speech of a mythical creature in a folktale. Finally, a short time spent on the Bailiwick of Jersey is tinted light green. Smell is also vividly represented throughout the novel. The young Riad associates new places and especially new people with their smells, ranging from perfume and incense to sweat, spoiled food, and flatulence. These odors tend to convey the quality of relationships, with Sattouf explaining, \\"the people whose odor I preferred were generally the ones who were the kindest to me. I find that‚Äôs still true today.‚Äù  Critical reception  The Arab of the Future has received widespread critical acclaim and is considered an instant classic among graphic memoirs. The text has been translated into sixteen languages, demonstrating its international appeal. Michel Hazanavicius, Academy Award-winning director of The Artist, proclaims ‚ÄúSeriously funny and penetratingly honest, Riad Sattouf tells the epic story of his eccentric and troubled family. Written with tenderness, grace, and piercing clarity, The Arab of the Future is one of those books that transcend their form to become a literary masterpiece.\\" The New York Times described the graphic memory as, ‚ÄúExquisitely illustrated, and filled with experiences of misfortune bordering on the farcical,‚Ä¶ a disquieting yet essential read.\\" Also writing for the Times, Laila Lalami highlights the book's portrayal of Sattouf's father, and his gradual and uneven path from a young idealist to an authoritarian, yet impotent, hypocrite. Many reviewers note that, for all his faults, the elder Sattouf remains a compelling and interesting figure, with Adam Schatz writing for The New Yorker: \\"For all his rants against Jews, Africans, and, above all, the Shia, [Abdel-Razak] remains strangely endearing, a kind of Arab Archie Bunker.\\" References External links *The Arab of the Future website.

C9orf91 I-Tasser Predicted Protein Structure with a score of -2.87 Transmembrane protein 268 is a protein that in humans is encoded by TMEM268 gene. The protein is a transmembrane protein of 342 amino acids long with eight alternative splice variants. The protein has been identified in organisms from the common fruit fly to primates. To date, there has been no protein expression found in organisms simpler than insects. Chromosome 9 is shown. Area in green is 9q32, where C9ORF91 is found.  Gene  = Location = TMEM268 maps on chromosome 9 at 9q32. The gene neighborhood for TMEM268 is shown below.

The exon Sequence for the combinations shown indicate combined regions. Amino acid length differs due to variants in nucleotide additions or deletions within exon regions, conferring different splice variants with similar sequence combinations. Table for Exon and Transcript Variants for TMEM268 Splice variants of TMEM268 gene.  Protein  = General Characteristics = TMEM268 has seven variants. NP_694590.2 is the variant that is the most studied. An ExPasy result indicates TMEM268 has an isoelectric point at 5.19 and a molecular weight around 37.6 kdal. TMEM268 is a member of a domain of unknown function, DUF4481. The region is located within 37 and 328 in the amino acid sequence. BLAST results indicate there are no paralogs within humans, zebra fish, and fruit flies. C9orf91 Domain and Transmembrane Globe Plot 2. = Transmembrane Characteristics = Transmembrane conformation hypothesis of TMEM268. Two predicted transmembrane regions are on the polypeptide, located at amino acids 104-125 and 130-152 respectively. The SAPS tool on the San Diego Super Computing Biology Workbench garnered protein structural characteristics. An hypothesis for transmembrane direction is the N terminus and C terminus to remain within the cell, and the loop to stick out of the membrane into the cytosol, presented in the adjacent image. Evidence for the transmembrane direction stems from phosphorylation site predictions. Net Phos 2.0 results for TMEM268 indicate regions of phosphorylation that are present in areas around the transmembrane region. This indicates the N terminus and C terminus are going to be facing into the cell, providing support to the transmembrane direction.Phosphorylation sites predicted on C9orf91.  Protein Expression  The protein was found to be expressed in numerous different tissues. The ETS Profile for TMEM268 indicates the gene is expressed ubiquitously within the body. In support, there has been experimental evidence using antibody staining to show various tissue types that express TMEM268. A recent study linked TMEM268 as a lysosome transporter. The exact function within the lysosome and interactions with other molecules, however, is not known.ETS Profile for C9orf91.  Associated Disease  Due to limited characterization, linkage to associated diseases is not well known. Techniques to view SNPs have been used in numerous diseases to determine loci influence. In spondylocostal dysostosis and spondyloarthritis, both were found to have SNPs that had indicated TMEM268 as a possible factor to the diseases  Interacting Proteins  Interacting proteins were found with c-REL(via affinity chromotography and yeast-two hybrid) and ELAV1, via a yeast-two hybrid. REL is associated to be a proto- oncogene that is from a family of transcription factors. It is associated with B-cell proliferation. ELAV1 is associated with binding to mRNA in order to help increase stability of transcripts.  Homology  = Ortholog identity and similarity = Identity of orthologous domains within TMEM268 in other species with a 40% identity and above is shown below. The DUFF4481 start shown on the image retains conservation throughout time. Of interest, areas of transmembrane region are not as conserved as thought, indicating that specific amino acids may not be a vital component towards the protein's function. Alignment of sample of orthologs based on 40% or more identity = Conservation within species = TMEM268 is conserved in many organisms. Orthologs have been found in mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, sharks, fish, and a few insects. It was not found within plants, bacteria, or archea. Amino acid length tends to increase within orthologs as divergence from humans goes up based on BLAST search results for similar proteins.

The name \\"Loony Dook\\" is a combination of \\"Loony\\" (short for \\"lunatic\\") and \\"Dook\\", a Scots term meaning \\"dip\\" or \\"bathe\\". It was firstperformed by a group of soldiers returning from WW2 to wash away the sins of old and renew themselves for the year ahead. This was on 1st January 1946 under the Forth Rail Bridge not where it is done these days. Course of events On New Year's Day, typically in the forenoon (but times vary according to tides), around 1,000 Dookers first take part in the so-called Dookers' Fancy Dress Parade, leading from the Hawes car park at the far end of the town to the old mole. Over 4,000 spectators cheer on the participants at various vantage points. The Dookers are then greeted by bagpipe pipers and warmed with bowls of \\"energising porridge\\", prior to plunging themselves into the freezing Firth of Forth. History The event was conceived in 1986 as a joking suggestion by three locals for a New Year's Day hangover cure. The following year it was decided to repeat the event for charity. After a few years of only local significance, the event gradually grew in the 1990s, both in popularity and number of participants. The growth accelerated after the event was started to be mentioned in the official Edinburgh Hogmanay publicity material and got a boost when the Millennium edition was broadcast live by the BBC. Originally organised by locals and starting from the Moorings pub (now the Inchcolm), factors such as increased crowds, safety issues and popularity necessitated a different handling. As a consequence, the events 2009 onwards were professionally handled by event managers Unique Events. Being the organisers of the Edinburgh Hogmanay Festival, they included the Loony Dook into the latter from 2011. In the same year a registration fee was introduced to cover the cost of organisation and stewarding. The fee of originally ¬£6 was raised to ¬£10 in 2016. This went up to ¬£12 in 2020, attracting criticism from the event's founders, who described it as a \\"damned disgrace\\". The proceeds benefit RNLI Queensferry and local charities. The Loony Dook received sponsorship from the tour company Haggis Adventures (from 2011) and then from the porridge company Stoats. Up to 2016, three of the original Dookers, James MacKenzie, Keith 'Rambo' Armstrong and Kenny Ross, have the distinction of taking part in every Loony Dook and the trio wore specially designed T-shirts with 30yrs to celebrate the achievement. Other Loony Dooks The event has inspired similar annual New Year's day Loony Dooks, such as in North Berwick and Dunbar in East Lothian, Portobello in Edinburgh, St Andrews, Dalgety Bay and Kirkcaldy in Fife and Coldingham Sands in Berwickshire all of which are on the south east coast of Scotland.

The chemicals used for pool water disinfection can react with organic compounds in the water to create disinfection by-products or DBPs. Exposure to these DBPs are the potential cause for respiratory symptoms in swimmers. Multiple studies have shown the potential correlation between chronic exposure to DBPs and respiratory symptoms among competitive swimmers but more research is needed on the effects of these DBPs on recreational swimmers. The studies on recreational swimmers that have been done show a decreased risk for respiratory symptoms due to a decreased exposure to DBPs. Some studies have been done on the vulnerability of younger children and DBP exposure. Studies done on the vulnerability of younger children demonstrate that immature lungs are more likely to absorb more of these DBPs.

Soderbergh came out of retirement to direct the film, and to distribute it independently through his own company Fingerprint Releasing. The film features an ensemble cast consisting of Channing Tatum, Adam Driver, Riley Keough, Daniel Craig, Seth MacFarlane, Katie Holmes, Hilary Swank, Katherine Waterston and Sebastian Stan. The film follows the Logan family and their attempt to rob the Charlotte Motor Speedway whilst avoiding security officers and the FBI. Logan Lucky premiered in Knoxville, Tennessee on August 9, 2017, and was theatrically released in the United States on August 18, 2017 by Bleecker Street. The film received positive reviews, with many critics praising the cast's performances and Soderbergh's direction, and grossed $48 million worldwide. Plot West Virginian Jimmy Logan is laid off from his construction job in the tunnels underneath the Charlotte Motor Speedway. He is close to his daughter, Sadie, who lives with her mom, Bobbie Jo, and her new, rich husband, Moody. Sadie performs in beauty pageants, and Jimmy‚Äôs hair stylist sister, Mellie, does her hair. Bobbie Jo and Moody plan on moving to Lynchburg as Moody plans to open up a new dealership. Jimmy goes to a bar tended by his brother Clyde, who lost his lower arm fighting in Iraq. A pretentious NASCAR-team owner, Max Chilblain, makes fun of Clyde‚Äôs disability, leading to a fight with Jimmy, while Clyde sets fire to Max‚Äôs car. The next day, Jimmy tells Clyde his plan to rob the Speedway, exploiting his knowledge of its underground pneumatic tube system for moving its vast amount of money. Clyde and Jimmy recruit their sister Mellie, incarcerated safe- cracker Joe Bang, and Joe's dimwitted brothers, Sam and Fish. They will break Joe out of prison and return him later that day. Clyde intentionally gets himself sent to prison on a minor charge. With the help of a woman working at the vault, Mellie, Sam, and Fish infest the Speedway's tube system with painted cockroaches, determining which tubes go to the vault. While gathering supplies, Jimmy meets former schoolmate Sylvia, who gives him a tetanus shot inside her mobile clinic, which is in need of donations. Jimmy learns that construction at the speedway is being completed ahead of schedule, forcing them to mount the heist a week earlier, during the much busier Coca-Cola 600 race on Memorial Day weekend. Joe arranges for fellow inmates to stage a riot, resulting in a lockdown that hides his and Clyde‚Äôs escape. Mellie meets them in a Ford Shelby GT350 stolen from Moody. At the speedway, Sam and Fish blow up a generator to disable the credit card machines, forcing vendors to accept cash only. Clyde, Jimmy and Joe enter the tube room, and Joe uses an explosive improvised from bleach, gummy bears and a dietary salt substitute to blow open the gate from the tube to the vault. They connect the tube to a giant vacuum pump, and suck up all the cash into garbage bags. Security guards investigate the smoke from the explosion, but are diverted by Earl, one of Clyde's bar patrons. Jimmy accidentally reverses the direction of the vacuum, sucking Clyde's prosthetic arm into the machine. Sam and Fish get the money out and into Jimmy‚Äôs truck. On his way out, Clyde is recognized by Chilblain and hits him, then Clyde and Joe sneak back into the prison disguised as firefighters. Jimmy makes it to his daughter's pageant just in time to see her perform his favorite song, \\"Take Me Home, Country Roads.\\" Jimmy then abandons the money and anonymously informs the police of its location. FBI agent Sarah Grayson investigates the heist, dubbed ‚ÄúOcean‚Äôs Seven-Eleven‚Äù in the press. While she suspects Jimmy, Clyde and Joe, she has no evidence. Due to the unwillingness of the prison warden to report the riot, the refuting of Chilblain's eyewitness account by his disgruntled race driver, Dayton White (who wrecked due to a sugar crash brought on by the former's energy drink), and the speedway president‚Äôs satisfaction with the money's recovery and insurance settlement, the case is closed after six months. When Joe returns home after prison he finds a garbage bag of money buried in his yard. Sylvia receives an anonymous donation for her clinic, and the inmate who orchestrated the riot receives an envelope stuffed with cash when he is released. Unknown to Joe and his brothers, Jimmy had filled extra trash bags during the heist, which he hid at the dump to retrieve later. Now working in a Lowe‚Äôs store and having bought a house near his daughter and ex-wife's home, Jimmy happily reunites with his family at Clyde's bar. The group is watched by Grayson, who tells Clyde that she is new to the area but thinks she will stay for a while. Cast Six other NASCAR drivers make cameo appearances in the film. Carl Edwards and Kyle Busch are West Virginia state troopers, Brad Keselowski and Joey Logano are security guards, Kyle Larson is a limousine driver, and Ryan Blaney is a delivery boy. LeAnn Rimes and Jesco White also make cameo appearances. Production Soderbergh's Behind the Candelabra (2013) was intended to be his final film as director. Soderbergh has said that he was initially given the Logan Lucky script in hopes that he could recommend a suitable director for the project, but he enjoyed reading it and decided to take it on for himself, specifically noting that it was an \\"anti-glam version of an Ocean's movie\\". He told Entertainment Weekly, \\"Nobody dresses nice. Nobody has nice stuff. They have no money. They have no technology. It's all rubber band technology.\\" At the time, Soderbergh was also theorizing a new distribution model and felt that the script gave him the perfect opportunity to do so. The film was announced in February 2016, along with Channing Tatum's casting. Variety initially reported that Matt Damon was also to star, although Deadline Hollywood reported the same day that Damon was not involved, but rather Michael Shannon. Shannon later left the project due to scheduling conflicts. Much of the rest of the cast was announced between that May and August, among them Seth MacFarlane, Adam Driver and Daniel Craig in May, Hilary Swank in June, and Jim O'Heir in August. = Screenplay = There has been media speculation regarding the identity of the film's screenwriter, Rebecca Blunt. The film's production notes state that she is a native of Logan, West Virginia who now lives in New York City, and that she is a first-time screenwriter. No one other than Soderbergh and Adam Driver has personally vouched for her existence. Some people involved with the film have exchanged emails with a person they believed to be her, and think that she lives in the United Kingdom. Sources speculated that \\"Rebecca Blunt\\" was actually a pseudonym for Soderbergh's wife Jules Asner, for comedian John Henson, or for Soderbergh himself. According to The Playlist, Asner was the sole screenwriter and chose to use a pseudonym because she did not want the perception of the film to be that \\"Soderbergh was directing his wife's script.\\" =Filming= Logan Lucky began filming on August 24, 2016. Production lasted 36 days, with much of the photography taking place at the Charlotte Motor Speedway and Atlanta Motor Speedway during the NASCAR race meetings at both circuits. The Atlanta outside barriers were repainted yellow, in an attempt to resemble Charlotte; the Charlotte track had yellow walls owing to then NASCAR's premiership title sponsor Sprint (they have since been replaced with white walls); Atlanta has white walls with red and blue pattern for Folds of Honor, the charity that is involved with (now spring) race sponsor QuikTrip. The scenes with the Fox commentators inside the commentary box were shot in Atlanta, because in Charlotte, the commentators are typically positioned on top of the grandstand roof for opening broadcast scenes and also since the road course can be seen from the Charlotte commentary box. =Music= David Holmes composed the score for Logan Lucky, having previously scored other Soderbergh films, including Out of Sight, the Ocean's Trilogy, and Haywire. The soundtrack was released by Milan Records; it includes the cue \\"Original Score Medley\\" by David Holmes, and music by various artists. The film features \\"Flashing Lights\\" by Screamin' Lord Sutch and Heavy Friends. Release Fingerprint Releasing and Bleecker Street released the film on August 18, 2017. Logan Lucky is the first film distributed by Fingerprint Releasing, which Soderbergh created to distribute films independently, instead of through big studios. The distributors spent $20 million on prints and advertising. =Box office= Logan Lucky grossed $27.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $19.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $47.5 million, against a production budget of $29 million. In North America, the film was released alongside The Hitman's Bodyguard, and was projected to gross $7‚Äì9 million from 3,008 theaters in its opening weekend. Having already covered the cost of the production budget through international advance sales, and the costs of prints and advertising through a deal with Amazon, Soderbergh said a debut of $15 million would be needed to be considered a success. The film grossed $2.8 million on its first day (including $525,000 from Thursday night previews). It went on to open to $7.6 million, finishing third at the box office, behind The Hitman's Bodyguard and Annabelle: Creation. In its second weekend, the film took in $4.2 million, dropping 44.2% and finishing 5th, in what was the lowest combined grossing weekend (for the top 10 films) since September 2001. During the following weekend, which preceded Labor Day, the film made $4.4 million over three days (an increase of 4%), and an estimated $5.5 million over the four-day weekend. It was again part of a historically low weekend, as it was the worst combined holiday weekend since 1998. =Critical response= On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 92% based on reviews from 277 critics, with an average rating of 7.47/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"High-octane fun that's smartly assembled without putting on airs, Logan Lucky marks a welcome end to Steven Soderbergh's retirement ‚Äî and proves he hasn't lost his ability to entertain.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating to reviews, the film has a score of 78 out of 100, based on reviews from 51 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it an 80% overall positive score. Owen Gleiberman of Variety gave the film a positive review, writing, \\"Steven Soderbergh's Logan Lucky is a high- spirited, low-down blast.\\" Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review, saying, \\"This is a good-times film that doesn't put on airs, dress to impress or pretend to be something it isn't. It just aims to please and does a pretty good job of it.\\" Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, praising the smooth direction and efficiency of storytelling Soderbergh brought to the film, and stating that other than needing additional scenes to give its \\"oddball characters\\" more depth, [Logan Lucky is] a precision-tooled entertainment made by experts, and sometimes more than that. Watching it is like finding money in the pocket of a coat that you haven't worn in years.\\" Rex Reed of The New York Observer was critical of the film, and described Soderbergh as an overrated director. Reed complained that the film takes a slower pace than Ocean's Eleven, and although he praised the camera work, music and ham acting, he concluded, \\"It doesn't work. Logan Lucky is as charming and welcome as toenail fungus.\\" =Home media= Logan Lucky was released on digital download on November 14, 2017, and on DVD, Blu-ray, and Ultra HD Blu-ray on November 28, 2017.

This restaurant appeared in several fictional works including Jo Nesb√∏'s books about Harry Hole and several books by Bj√∏rg Vik. Schr√∏der in Torggata 14 from 1925 to 1954 In 1925, Hans Schr√∏der took over Elise Pettersens caf√© which had been operating in the corner building of Torggata/Hammersborggata since 1912, one block north of Youngstorget, with a view towards Arbeidersamfunnets plass. The restaurant lay on the same corner as the Oslo Workers' Society (Norwegian: Oslo Arbeidersamfunn), and was an important link between the meetings there. Male waiters had black pants, white jackets and a cloth draped over their arms. The female waiters had black silk aprons. Schr√∏der had live music, including Martin B√¶kkelunds accordion, and his sons Kjell and Rolf who debuted here on the piano and violin respectively. The building was torn down in 1954 in connection with the building of the new Folkets hus. Restaurant in Waldemar Thranes gate In 1956 Schr√∏der moved into the new building in Waldemar Thranes gate 8, near the intersection of Waldemar Thranes gate and Ullev√•lsveien, which is the heart of St. Hanshaugen with shopping and restaurants. A restaurant had been run in the old building since 1900 when Frk. Glansins Restaurant was established. Hilmar Hansen ran the Terrasse-Restaurant from 1923 to 1953. The building was torn down in 1954, and Schr√∏der moved into the new building upon completion in 1956. The building was designed by the architect G. T. Schulz. Georg Karlson, who had been running Schr√∏der since 1946, continued on and lived with his family in the building.Johnsen, page 23‚Äì28. There were two pillars in the middle of the premises and a small porch by the entrance. The tables were dressed first with red tablecloths and then with a smaller white tablecloth placed diagonally on top. For the past 20 years with the current owners, the interior has remained unchanged. After July 1, 2004, when the no-smoking law came into effect in Norway, the restaurant was painted to remove the smoke odour. Paintings from 1926 by Sigurd Fosnes hang on the walls,Johnsen, page 25. depicting Bergfjerdingen (the stairs up to Damstredet), Torggata with the first Torggata Bad and from the corner of the building where the restaurant was located, the wooden house district in Telthusbakken, the former wooden house district at Enerhaugen and a several meter wide picture from Youngstorget. There was live music at Schr√∏der in 1960s, and doorman Holm sung with the accompaniment of Sigurd Dahl on the piano and waiter Trygve Nilsen on the violin. The restaurant was well known as the place to go before and after sporting events at Bislett Stadium, such as the World Championships in speed skating.Johnsen, page 28‚Äì29. The Menu Wiener Schnitzel at Restaurant Schr√∏der The restaurant serves traditional Norwegian caf√© and restaurant style food, such as pork and sauce and Wiener Schnitzel. Entrec√¥te, meat patties and plaice were on the menu in 1957 and are still there in 2016.

Plot  As the film begins, in 1980s Thriunelveli, Arivudai Nambi (Vijay Antony) is killed by his rivals, who fear that their position would be threatened if he were to make it big in politics. Arividuai Nambi's wife commits suicide after the sudden death of her husband. Eventually, Arivudai Nambi's father looked after and cared for his grandson. Decades later, Arivudai Nambi's son Tamilarasan (Vijay Antony) is accidentally drawn into the murky world of behind-the-screens politicking when he is jailed due to admitting to having hit someone on the road. Two gangster- type baddies with political backing become his enemies, and this, in turn, brings him closer to Karunakaran (Thiagarajan), a political heavyweight who has his own ambitions. A minister sees Tamilarasan as an enemy because he sees him as Nambi, whom he had conspired to murder and later killed. Meanwhile, Tamailarasan had a friendly relationship with Anjana (Miya) after she accidentally hit him on his motorbike. Machinations and counter-machinations grow with the growing political ambitions of Tamilarasan, whose rivals will not let him and his wife, Anjana, live in peace. Tamilarasan boldly faces all this in his game of one-upmanship and realizes his dream of growing big in politics, like his father.

Shankar as Thangapandian *Jayakumar as Selvaa Production In December 2015, Jeeva Shankar announced that his next film would feature Vijay Antony and the pair would collaborate after working together in Naan (2012). Shankar had initially discussed the script with other actors including Vijay Sethupathi, who had requested the director to finish the script in two months, but Shankar took eight months and Vijay Sethupathi became busy with other projects. Antony's availability meant that Shankar chose to cast him in the lead role. He revealed that the film would be a political thriller film set in Chennai and Antony would portray the character who brings \\"the message of death\\". Miya was signed on as the film's lead actress during January 2016, while Lyca Productions announced that they would produce the film. Antony put on weight for the film and began working on the project during the same month, with the producers revealing that the film would be shot within eighty days. Thiagarajan joined the film's cast during May 2016 and revealed that he would portray the lead antagonist, appearing as a \\"political mastermind\\". Several scenes were shot in Chennai, while a prison set was erected in Pondicherry for the shoot. A song was shot in Mumbai during July 2016 featuring Vijay Antony and Miya. The team later moved on to film sequences in Georgia during July 2016. Soundtrack The film's score and soundtrack were composed by Vijay Antony. The song \\"Yem Mela Kai Vachaa Gaali\\" was released as a single in September 2016, during the Tamil Nadu Premier League match of Kovai vs Chepauk held in Tirunelveli. The album was released on 4 February 2017 by Lyca Music. Release The film had a worldwide theatrical release on 24 February 2017, with a dubbed Telugu version with the same name having a simultaneous release. The satellite rights of the film were sold to Zee Tamil. Sify.com gave the film a positive review, stating \\"to conclude, Yaman is a film with many layers, and one with solid drama at its core, which makes it such an engaging watch\\" and that \\"it is that rare kind of film which transports you bang in the middle of its action\\". In their review of the film, The Hindu found \\"strong performances and detailing save the day for Vijay Antony‚Äôs Yaman... the film's release timing is apt in the country‚Äôs politically active scenario\\". A critic from The Times of India wrote \\"overall, a little more pace, doing away a duet song which appears in the second half which makes audience yawn and slight tone down of heroism would have worked wonders\\". The Indian Express called it \\"a watchable political drama, which has come out at the right time in the light of the ongoing political crisis in Tamil Nadu\\". Likewise, The Deccan Chronicles review mentioned \\"the film works only in parts\\". The New Indian Express stated \\"despite the glitches, and with more positives than negatives, Yaman is a fairly interesting watch\\". Baradwaj Rangan of Film Companion wrote \\"There‚Äôs too much dialogue, explaining what we already know. And Vijay Antony isn‚Äôt actor enough to clue us into the character‚Äôs inner workings...To his credit, he wants to veer away from the mass-hero template. His films actually have a story. If only he‚Äôd find better people to tell them.\\" Box Office The film's box office gross was SuperHit by collecting Rs 24.15 crores.

LaLaVoice had several capabilities, which it mostly gained from basic text-to-speech input, though it was also possible to input the sounds using a microphone. As well as simple reading of text, it had the ability to produce singing vocals (\\"LaLaSong\\") and read specific frames of webpages. The vocals were robotic sounding when played. The vocals themselves were based on a family of characters from more realistic members of the family (such as a grandmother, girl, boy, grandfather, etc.) to those intended to be soul based on robots. The software also supported Microsoft Office and could be used with Excel or Word and could even read e-mails. The last function the software had was a mode where a rabbit called \\"SuPaamimi\\" (\\"„Åô„ÅÖ„Å±„ÅÅ„Åø„Åø\\") would act as a schedule management program.

This pattern avoids many of the problems with multiple inheritance. Definition  Instead of having a single class which is derived from two super-classes, have two separate sub-classes each derived from one of the two super-classes. These two sub-classes are closely coupled, so, both can be viewed as a Twin object having two ends. Applicability The twin pattern can be used: * to model multiple inheritance in a language in which multiple inheritance is not supported * to avoid some problems of multiple inheritance. Structure There will be two or more parent classes which are used to be inherited. There will be sub- classes each of which is derived from one of the super-classes. The sub- classes are mutually linked via fields, and each sub-class may override the methods inherited from the super-class. New methods and fields are usually declared in one sub-class. The following diagram shows the typical structure of multiple inheritance: Typical multiple inheritance The following diagram shows the Twin pattern structure after replacing the previous multiple inheritance structure: Twin pattern Collaborations Each child class is responsible for the protocol inherited from its parent. It handles the messages from this protocol and forwards other messages to its partner class. Clients of the twin pattern reference one of the twin objects directly and the other via its twin field. Clients that rely on the protocols of parent classes communicate with objects of the respective child class. Sample code The following code is a sketched implementation of a computer game board with moving balls. class for the game board: public class Gameboard extends Canvas { public int width, height; public GameItem firstItem; ‚Ä¶ } code sketch for GameItem class: public abstract class GameItem { Gameboard board; int posX, posY; GameItem next; public abstract void draw(); public abstract void click (MouseEvent e); public abstract boolean intersects (GameItem other); public abstract void collideWith (GameItem other); public void check() { GameItem x; for (x = board.firstItem; x != null; x = x.next) if (intersects(x)) collideWith(x); } public static BallItem newBall(int posX, int posY, int radius) {//method of GameBoard BallItem ballItem = new BallItem(posX, posY, radius); BallThread ballThread = new BallThread(); ballItem.twin = ballThread; ballThread.twin = ballItem; return ballItem; } } code sketch for the BallItem class: public class BallItem extends GameItem { BallThread twin; int radius; int dx, dy; boolean suspended; public void draw() { board.getGraphics().drawOval(posX-radius, posY-radius, 2*radius, 2*radius); } public void move() { posX += dx; posY += dy; } public void click() { if (suspended) twin.resume(); else twin.suspend(); suspended = ! suspended; } public boolean intersects (GameItem other) { if (other instanceof Wall) return posX - radius <= other.posX && other.posX <= posX + radius  posY - radius <= other.posY && other.posY <= posY + radius; else return false; } public void collideWith (GameItem other) { Wall wall = (Wall) other; if (wall.isVertical) dx = - dx; else dy = - dy; } } Code sketch for BallThread class: public class BallThread extends Thread { BallItem twin; public void run() { while (true) { twin.draw(); /*erase*/ twin.move(); twin.draw(); } } } Implementation of the Twin pattern The following issues should be considered: * Data abstraction - partner classes of the twin class have to be tightly coupled, as probably they have to access each other private fields and methods. In Java, this can be achieved by placing the partner classes into a common package and providing package visibility for the required fields and methods. In Modula-3 and in Oberon, partner classes can be placed in a common module * Efficiency - Since the Twin pattern uses composition which requires message forwarding, the Twin pattern may be less efficient than inheritance. However, since multiple inheritance is slightly less efficient than single inheritance anyway, the overhead will not be a major problem.

It was first described scientifically in 1886 by Petter Karsten, who called it Hydnum gracilipes. He transferred it to the genus Hydnellum in 1879. Fruit bodies of the fungus have a pinkish to reddish-brown colour, a delicate texture described as \\"felty or papery\\", and flimsy stipes. Its spores are roughly spherical with a diameter of no more than 5 ¬µm. H. gracilipes is found in northern Europe, where it is mycorrhizal with pine.

From 1872 to 1878 it served as the county seat building of Watonwan County, housing the courthouse, offices, and jail. Flanders' Block was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 for having local significance in the theme of politics/government. It was nominated for its associations with the early development of Watonwan County's government. Description Flanders' Block has eight arched windows on the second level. It was originally built with five arched windows on the main level and a conventional storefront in the remaining three bays. At the time of its National Register nomination, the street facades were covered by later remodelings, but the owner subsequently removed the sheathing and restored the original storefront. History The city of Madelia was platted in 1857 along the Watonwan River. Watonwan County was established in 1860 and its first county seat was in Madelia. The original courthouse was a wood frame structure, but it was destroyed in a fire. By that time St. James‚Äîa more centrally located community and a division headquarters for the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway‚Äîwas agitating to become the county seat. Fearful that the fire would provide a reason to relocate the government, Madelia officials acted quickly to secure a new location within their community. Joseph Flanders, the county's first registrar of deeds, had just built the two-story building on Main Street. He leased the upper floor for a courtroom, part of the first floor for county offices, and part of the basement for the jail. The Watonwan County Bank occupied the rest of the first floor. The local newspaper was critical of this arrangement. An editorial that appeared in the Madelia Times in 1875 said: > One of the evidences of the dictatorial spirit with which J. Flanders > attempts to run this county, subservient to his arbitrary will, is evidenced > by the manner in which he put the county offices out of possession of the > rooms, whose use belongs to the county, and to no one else, for county > purposes under a lease of ten years, or so long as it may be needed for said > purposes, by the county seat remaining at this place. It is a shame and a > disgrace that our county officers should be even asked to vacate the > apartments provided for them by the said lease, which was accepted by the > county board and put on record, and be moved into another room, which is not > well lighted, to suit the caprice of one dictating official, simply that he > may use the room which rightfully belongs to the county, to accomplish > selfish ends. Still worse than this, however, a part of the officers were > not even requested to move, but without being consulted and in their > absence, their desks, books and papers were removed. Madelia was unable to hold on to county seat status, however, and in 1878 the government was moved to St. James. In later years, Flanders' Block was home to an International Order of Odd Fellows lodge upstairs, and the main floor has housed various commercial establishments.

The letter was later published as a book by Khatami Culture House Institute. He promised to write the letter at a 27 April 2004 meeting with youth.  Naming  Iranian blogger writing under the pen name A disqualified Citizen, comments that Khatami, by calling his statements \\"A Letter for Tomorrow\\" means that \\"today's electorate and the current population of Iran lack the qualifications to fathom the depth of meaning stashed way in its luminous pages. It will have to wait for the people of tomorrow to catch up with the President's intellectual depth and realize that his apparent failures were veritable triumphs in disguise.\\"  Summary and themes  Khatami asserts that the Iranian reform movement aimed at the \\"modernization of religious culture\\" in order to render it compatible with democracy; it wanted to create a \\"free, prosperous, and happy\\" Iran. Iranians had demanded \\"liberty, independence, and progress,\\" for more than a century and despite numerous setbacks had not relented in pursuit of these aims. Placing the Iranian reform movement in the broader context of Iranian history, he implicitly compared the problems he faced with those encountered by Mohammad Mosaddeq. In this letter, Khatami readily admits to his own errors and unfulfilled objectives, conceded that not all his reforms had been successful, primarily because reforming legislations had often been blocked by the Guardian Council. He nevertheless contended that the achievements of the reform movement were not negligible and insisted that change would continue, citing a gradual softening of the hardliners' position, as comparing the past, the opponents were now more obliged to speak the language of law, reform, and democracy and to shun myopic views; violations of the private sphere were much less frequent than before. He has considerably written about \\"the flourishing economy\\" since 1997 than about positive achievements in other areas. Khatami blames the persistent legacy of \\"despotism\\" in Iran, which in his view affected the conduct of government, the opposition, and intellectuals. He criticizes \\"blind attachment to fossilized habits, rigid traditionalism, and the unreflective tendency to either love or loathe the West\\", he castigates \\"superficial reactionaries,\\" myopic opponents, and \\"impatient friends.\\" In this letter, he rebuked the Guardian Council, Judicial system of Iran, and \\"others who invoked a theocratic reading of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran in order to oppose liberty by portraying it as synonymous with moral depravity\\", also condemning those who promoted \\"violence instead of logic\\" and saw \\"values\\" as incompatible with progress. He insists on the indispensability of reform in a spirit of \\"moderation, flexibility, rationality, and patience\\"; warns against defying popular aspirations; and appealed to the cultural elite not to remain indifferent when freedom was being \\"stolen,\\" and urges the youth not to succumb to passivity. On the authoritarianism within the country, he writes \\"The war and the assassinations forced the state to impose more restrictions\\", but \\"What is amazing is that, for some people, this situation... came to be seen as the rule.\\" Last but not the least, Khatami warned against the danger posed to the country by \\"the reactionary trend with a superficial outlook\\", which was later explained by rise of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to power.  Reception  Gareth Smyth of the Tehran Bureau wrote that the letter \\"read[s] like a swansong\\". According to Fakhreddin Azimi, in this \\"rambling\\" and \\"didactic statement\\", Khatami, \\"reiterated his credo and tried to provide a justification for his conduct and for his government‚Äôs shortcomings.\\" He adds \\"detecting unpersuasive or implausible claims in Khatami‚Äôs statement is not difficult. Among other things, the statement replicated a confusion regarding the notions of \\"government\\" () and \\"the state\\" (), which in Persian are usually rendered interchangeably. The state as the institutional embodiment of indivisible sovereignty was not headed by Khatami; though notionally the president, he merely acted as the head of an institutionally fragile executive whose authority was ill defined and in practice heavily circumscribed\\". and \\"The structural constraints that Khatami faced cannot be underestimated.\\"  References  External links * Category:Open letters Category:2004 in Iran Category:2004 documents Category:Mohammad Khatami Category:History of civil rights and liberties in Iran Category:Reform in Iran ","title":"A Letter for Tomorrow"},{"id":"49323905","text":"Environmental Action is a 501(c)(4) non-profit environmental advocacy organization in the United States. Founded in 1970 by environmental activists at the first Earth Day, it operated until 1996 but was then rebooted in 2012 as part of the Public Interest Network, a family of non-profit organizations that includes the Public Interest Research Group, Environment America, Green Corps and others. Environmental Action developed the original \\"Dirty Dozen\\", a list of members of Congress with poor records on environmental issues. Begun in 1970, it has been run annually ever since in partnership with the League of Conservation Voters. The group also helped convince Richard Nixon to support the Clean Air Act of 1970, the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act. Overview Environmental Action, a national ecological organization that grew from the enthusiasm of Earth Day in 1970, combined political activism and grassroots organizing with an experimental egalitarian staff structure. Because of this, it was considered among the most radical of the national environmental groups. Based in Washington, D.C., Environmental Action used education and advocacy to create innovative media campaigns and score legislative victories. Operational from 1970 to 1996, the organization spawned dozens of activists who went on to play significant roles across the environmental and social change movements. After its demise, the name was later resurrected by a different entity. Environmental Action, previously known as Environmental Teach-In, was launched on April 21, 1970, the day before the first Earth Day. It was made up of young activists influenced both by America's pollution crisis and by the anti-war movement of the 1960s. In its founding statement, Environmental Action pledged to focus attention on poor people, African-Americans, anti-war groups, workers and the 1970 Congressional elections. The staff went from organizing Earth Day into lobbying for political change on Capitol Hill, advocating for meaningful new environmental laws and pressing for corporate reform through media efforts and demonstrations. Because Environmental Action lobbied Congress and was not tax- deductible, and because its paid membership peaked at only 22,000 in 1979, it continually operated over its 26-year lifetime on a bare-bones budget. Programs and campaigns =Dirty Dozen= Soon after its founding, Environmental Action named the \\"Dirty Dozen\\"‚Äî12 anti-environmental congressmen of both parties. Seven of the 12 went down to defeat in November 1970, helping to pave the way for overwhelming congressional passage of strong legislation on clean air and water that year and the next. The campaign also pushed Environmental Action onto center stage regarding environment and the voting booth. The Dirty Dozen campaign was widely covered in the press, not only in the news section but also through numerous editorials and even in political humor columns. It became Environmental Action's best-known and most effective tactic, even though it was strongly attacked by Congressional leaders who considered legislation to prohibit it. It has since been imitated by numerous other advocacy organizations across a spectrum of issues. =Clean Air= As part of the Coalition for Clean Air, Environmental Action lobbied for legislation engineered by Senator Edmund Muskie (D-ME) and John Sherman Cooper (R-KY). This marked the first time ever that citizen lobbyists helped to specifically draft detailed legislative language on an environmental issue. Despite opposition from virtually all of corporate America (but key support from the United Automobile Workers), the law was overwhelmingly passed in the House and unanimously in the Senate. In conference committee, Muskie's Senate version dominated a weaker House bill, and President Nixon signed the Clean Air Act into law on December 31, 1970. =Supersonic transport= Beginning in the 1950s, aerospace companies set their sights on building a commercial airliner that could fly faster than the speed of sound. By the mid-1960s, however, significant environmental impacts were coming to the fore, including massive fuel consumption, potential damage to the upper atmosphere, and a continuous sonic boom emanating in a wide wake behind the plane. Environmental Action, with Friends of the Earth, the Sierra Club and others, organized the broadest legislative effort to that point by environmentalists Thanks to the effort, along with the plane's dismal economics, the supersonic transport (upon which $1 billion had already been spent) was voted down by the Senate on December 3, 1970 and zeroed out of the budget by the full Congress on March 24, 1971. =Ecotage= Inspired by \\"The Fox\\", a pseudonym under which Chicagoan James F. Phillips led direct action against the U.S. Steel Corporation, Environmental Action coined a new word‚Äî\\"ecotage\\"‚Äîto denote the use of sabotage in the name of ecology. It then held a nationwide contest. The Fox had engaged in extra-legal direct action‚Äîincluding dumping a pail of dead fish on the white carpet of U.S. Steel's CEO and placing a heavy manhole cover on top of a U.S. Steel smokestack‚Äîbut Environmental Action expressly foreswore illegal actions, soliciting only ideas. The contest winners, the Eco-Commando Force '70 were feted at a banquet and, in 1972, Pocket Books published Ecotage, a book that was influential on later, more militant ecology organizations such as Greenpeace, Earth First!, and Rainforest Action Network. =Bust the Highway Trust Fund= In 1956, the United States began constructing the Interstate Highway System, the largest public works project in history. In rural areas the highways were popular, but by the late 1960s many Interstates had begun to penetrate inner cities, destroying neighborhoods, adding pollution, and generating political resistance. Local anti-highway groups sprang up in dozens of locations from Boston to Seattle calling for changes to the Highway Trust Fund, an exclusive source of highway- only dollars from Washington. In 1971, Environmental Action and several other organizations launched the Highway Action Coalition (HAC) with the purpose of allowing the federal Highway Trust Fund to be used for mass transit and other non-highway transportation projects. Although the trust fund was among the nation's most sacrosanct of funding sources, and although it was defended by the political might of the automobile, oil and construction industries, HAC used its citizen lobbying and its publication, The Concrete Opposition, to harness the anger and call for flexibility in funding all modes of transportation. On March 14, 1973, in a 49-44 vote, the Senate allowed up to $850 million of trust fund money to be spent on mass transit; while the House of Representatives did not go so far, the final compromise did \\"bust the trust\\" for the first time. On August 13, President Richard Nixon signed the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1973‚Äîstill with the old nomenclature but now allowing spending on transit. =Reforming the electric utility industry= Beginning in 1973, Environmental Action waged a two-decades-long campaign to reform the electric utility industry. Among its goals were a reduction in nuclear power generation, elimination of automatic rate increases, and reform of utility accounting procedures. Using media campaigns and guerrilla theater, as well as traditional political lobbying, the group helped pass the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (1978) and the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (1978). However, most of the focus was on regulatory agencies and the utility companies themselves, most notably through the booklet How to Challenge Your Local Electric Utility (1974), which sold more than 25,000 copies. In 1975, Environmental Action revealed that the utility industry had collected more than $1 billion in \\"phantom taxes\\" that had not actually been paid to the federal government. In 1978 it published Utility Scoreboard, a comparative rating of 100 major power companies on 15 environmental and consumer issues. The group also regularly clashed with the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), the utilities' lobbying arm. In 1984 Environmental Action revealed that EEI had unlawfully skimmed from utilities' dues $15 million that should have gone to the non-political Electric Power Research Institute. In its campaigns, Environmental Action regularly caricatured Reddy Kilowatt, a fictional cartoon \\"spokesperson\\" for the electric utility industry. The unflattering portrayals led to a 1977 lawsuit by the cartoon's owner, Reddy Communications, Inc. for copyright infringement and unfair competition. Two years later the court found that the caricatures were protected under free speech and dismissed the suit. =Bottle bill legislation and wasteful packaging= On Earth Day 1970, litter was widely lamented as one of the nation's most prominent environmental ills, and throwaways were held up as emblematic of the problem. Following passage of a bottle bill in Oregon, Environmental Action took on the mantle of national bottle bill legislation, requiring a five-cent refundable deposit on every beverage container. With insurmountable corporate opposition in Congress, the organization focused on public education and state advocacy, resulting in the passage of bottle bills in Vermont (1973), Maine and Michigan (1976), Connecticut, Delaware and Iowa (1978), Massachusetts (1982), New York (1982), and California (1987). Fifteen years later Hawaii also passed returnable legislation. In 1978, in order to pressure the president to act, Environmental Action organized the \\"Cans to Carter\\" campaign, resulting in the postal delivery of an avalanche of 50,000 empty soda and beer cans‚Äîcomplete with educational wrappers and a U.S. postage stamp‚Äîfrom around the country to the White House mail room. Environmental Action also sought to reduce all forms of over-packaging and solid waste, and it played a role in the enactment of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976. =Clean water= Following passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970, Environmental Action turned its attention to water pollution. With Senatory Edmund Muskie and his Subcommittee on Air and Water Pollution in the driver's seat, this major update of the 1965 water pollution law moved forward with almost unprecedented bipartisan support. The Clean Water Act passed 86-0 in the Senate in 1971 and also in the House in 1972. When President Nixon vetoed it on grounds that it was too costly, his veto was overridden by 52-12 in the Senate and 247-23 in the House. The law went into effect on October 18, 1972. =Filthy Five= Building on the success of the Dirty Dozen campaign and believing that corporations were as responsible for anti-environmental policies as politicians, Environmental Action in 1977 launched the \\"Filthy Five\\" campaign against the trade associations of the nation's five most polluting industries: American Petroleum Institute, American Iron and Steel Institute, Edison Electric Institute, American Paper Institute, and Manufacturing Chemists Association (which became the American Chemistry Council). The announcement received coverage in almost 200 media outlets. Three years later, in the 1980 \\"backlash year\\" when Ronald Reagan was elected president, the Filthy Five campaign was upgraded. This time Environmental Action named five specific corporations (rather than industries) and highlighted both their pollution records and the level of campaign spending by their political action committees. The companies were International Paper, Dow Chemical, Republic Steel, Occidental Petroleum, and Amoco. The group also shone a spotlight on 11 U.S. senators who received the highest amount of campaign funding from Filthy Five companies. =Forging alliances with labor= Environmental Action was one of the few environmental groups to speak out on the issue of occupational health and safety. The earliest relationship was with the United Automobile Workers, which contributed staff time and money to Earth Day in April, 1970. A few months later, Environmental Action collaborated with the UAW (and the United Methodist Church) in an unprecedented labor-environmentalist gathering in Onaway, Michigan, where 250 participants agreed to build a labor‚Äìenvironment alliance and to focus attention on the need to move automotive technology beyond the internal combustion engine. Soon thereafter, Environmental Action promoted a student‚Äìenvironmentalist alliance in support of the United Auto Workers' strike against General Motors. Environmental Action also worked closely with the United Steelworkers of America in lobbying for the Clean Air Act and with the Sheet Metal Workers of America to push for the expansion of solar power. In early 1973, Environmental Action and 10 other ecology groups endorsed a strike and boycott by the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union against Shell Oil for the company's failure to agree to five health and safety measures in contract negotiations. Calling it \\"America's First Environmental Strike,\\" Environmental Action took a lead role by creating and staffing the Committee to Support the Shell Strike. The strike settled with a compromise that June. Two years later, Environmental Action staff helped create a new organization, Environmentalists for Full Employment, to undertake research and advocacy into the many ways that pollution control can provide good jobs. =Forging alliances with the peace movement= More than other environmental organizations, Environmental Action sought to highlight the connection between ecology and anti-militarism, even choosing to use two anti-war votes on the floor of the House of Representatives in compiling the Dirty Dozen list, explaining that \\"war is the ultimate ecological catastrophe.\\" Environmental Action's longest battle against an ecologically destructive military program, from 1974 to 1977, involved the supersonic B-1 Bomber. Working with a coalition of peace and religious organizations, Environmental Action helped defeat the bomber's appropriation, with President Carter canceling the B-1 on June 30, 1977.Ornstein, Norman J.; Elder, Shirley (1983). \\"The B-1 Bomber: Organizing at the Grass Roots\\", in: Eston T. White (comp.), Studies in Defense. Washington, DC: National Defense University. p. 45-69, with mention of Environmental Action, p. 51, 53, 65. . It was later resurrected, during the Reagan Administration. Publications and reports =Environmental Action magazine= Environmental Action magazine, the thread that tied the organization together over its 26-year life, covered all ecological issues, even those far from the group's own lobbying purview. It particularly sought out non-mainstream and newly-emerging topics, and it served as a leading information and advocacy vehicle for the entire environmental movement. Environmental Action prided itself on challenging the motives and methods of corporations and politicians; in the early years, its most popular column was \\"Debunking Madison Avenue,\\" which exposed fraudulent and misleading advertisements. In 1992, famed author Studs Terkel said, \\"EA magazine should be required reading for any informed citizen who's concerned about the environment.\\" =Other periodicals= Environmental Action published several specialized newsletters on individual topics, including The Concrete Opposition, Garbage Guide, Power Line, Exposure, and Waterways. =Books and booklets= Soon after its founding, Environmental Action published two books, Earth Day: The Beginning (Arno Press/New York Times, 1970), a compendium of speeches delivered around the nation on April 22, and Earth Tool Kit (Pocket Books, 1971), a how-to book explaining environmental problems and describing the politics behind cleaning them up. In 1972, the group published Ecotage (Pocket Books), a collection of entries to the contest the group ran the previous year. In 1990, in conjunction with the 20th anniversary of Earth Day, it published Our Earth, Ourselves, a guide to help protect and preserve the environment. Environmental Action and Environmental Action Foundation also published a large number of studies and booklets about utility reform, waste reduction, and anti-militarism. These included: Do It Yourself Ecology (1970), The Case for a Nuclear Moratorium (1972), How to Challenge Your Local Electric Utility (1974), Who's Got the Power (1974), Boom and Bust (1975), A Citizen's Guide to the Fuel Adjustment Clause (1975), Bottles and Sense (1975), Taking Charge: A New Look at Public Power (1976), Countdown to a Nuclear Moratorium (1976), Phantom Taxes in Your Electric Bill (1976), Nuclear Power: The Bargain We Can't Afford (1977), Resource Recovery: Truth & Consequences (1977), Talking Trash (1977), The End of the Road (with National Wildlife Federation, 1977), Utility Scoreboard (1978), Accidents Will Happen: The Case Against Nuclear Power (1979), The Rate Watcher's Guide: How to Shape Up Your Utility Rate Structure (1980), Phantom Taxes Update (1980), Green Pages ‚Äì How to Write/Where to Write: A Guide to Public Interest Groups, Federal Agencies and Congress (1981), Power & Light: Political Strategies for the Solar Transition (1982), Rate Shock: Confronting the Cost of Nuclear Power (1984), Gambling for Gigabucks: Excess Capacity in the Electric Utility Industry (1986), Building a Brighter Future: State Experiences in Least-Cost Electrical Planning (1990). Demise, legacy and rebirth  By the 1990s, Environmental Action's finances had deteriorated even further, and in 1996 the financial shortfall resulted in a complete staff layoff. Rights to the Dirty Dozen name were given to the League of Conservation Voters and in November, 1996 the organization's files were donated to the environmental archives at the University of Pittsburgh. Environmental Action served as a linchpin between the pro-nature conservation community and the pro-public-health, pro-worker, corporate reform community. Utilizing grassroots activism, it raised a beacon against rampant consumerism by focusing on its severe environmental effects, from electricity usage to throwaway bottles and cans. The group also demonstrated that decisions can be made collectively and an equal-salary structure can work. While Environmental Action ultimately closed, it also served as a training ground for scores of young activists who went on to become leaders in such organizations as the Sierra Club, Union of Concerned Scientists, Natural Resources Defense Council, Environmental Defense Fund, Common Cause, Center for Science in the Public Interest, League of Conservation Voters, Solar Lobby, Rails-to-Trails Conservancy, Federation of American Scientists, Smart Growth America, Trust for Public Land and Worldwatch Institute, as well as numerous federal and state agencies, newspapers and magazines, foundations, universities and other non-profit organizations. In 2012, the Public Interest Network, a family of organizations, requested of the alumni of Environmental Action the right to utilize the name Environmental Action. This permission was granted, and the new Environmental Action, now located in Boston, continues to advocate for a green and healthy planet.

It involved the killing by firing squad at Avranches of approximately 800 prisoners. Although Avranches itself is some distance to the north of the Vend√©e region, the victims of the massacre had arrived in the area as part of the large but poorly coordinated counter-revolutionary force that had originated in the Vend√©e, and like many aspect of the War in the Vend√©e the Massacre of Avranches generated passionate and contrasting interpretations from commentators, throughout and beyond the nineteenth century. Background During their sweep north, the army of the Vend√©e counter-revolutionaries, their numbers swollen by volunteers in Brittany and Maine, moved on into Normandy in order to attack the port of Granville. On 13 November, approaching from Dol and Pontorson, they marched on Avranches. The local authorities gave the order to destroy the bridge connecting the little hamlet of Ville Ch√©rel with Pontorson which could have impeded the progress of the counter-revolutionaries, but this order was not implemented. The republicans then assembled an ad hoc peasant army of 5,000 or 6,000 from the surrounding area to defend Avranches, but without any weapons this force simply melted away when they saw the knights on horse-back at the head of the \\"cavalier\\" force approaching along the road from the west. The army from the Vend√©e was able to capture Avranches without resistance, and took the opportunity to replenish their supplies. Most of the Republican city administrators simply fled. Some, however, along with some soldiers, were captured and imprisoned. At the same time, some of the suspected anti- Republicans who had been languishing in the town jail before the arrival of the Vend√©e army were now liberated by the Vend√©e general, Gaspard Marigny. Those released included the former mayor from the days before the revolution, Louis-Jules Boessel-Dubuisson. Boessel-Dubuisson now interceded on behalf of his Republican \\"patriot\\" fellow townsfolk, and procured their release. Various other republican prisoners were released in return for a promise that they would not take up arms again against the Royalists. These had their heads shaved so that if they failed to keep their promise they would be easy to identify. Meanwhile a few acts of pillage by insurgents were identified and two men were shot. The next day, 14 November, reinforced by a small number of sympathisers, the royalist army resumed their march towards Granville where, it was rumoured, they might be able to join up with a force from England. They left behind in Avranches their wounded and sick, to be cared for in the church, as well as some women and children who had been accompanying their army, all under the protection of a \\"rear guard\\" under the command of two of their generals, the aging and . Granville was not far from Avranches, and the Vend√©e army arrived during the afternoon and successfully overran some suburbs before setting about the walls of the main town. However, they had no siege equipment and there was no sign of any supporting English army arriving. At some stage there were cries of \\"treason\\" from within their ranks which led to panic and a disorderly withdrawal. The siege of Granville became a decisive defeat for the royalist counter-revolutionaries, and without any obvious plan for this eventuality they returned inland in some disarray, heading initially for Avranches and then moving back towards Pontorson on 18 November, by now pursued by a republican force of 6,000 men from the Caen-based Army of the Coasts of Cherbourg, under the command of and the government representative . Massacre On 21 November 1793, while the counter revolutionary Catholic and Royal Army and the republican forces confronted one another nearby in what would come to be known as the Battle of Dol, troops sent by General Sepher entered Avranches. The town's republican administration was quickly restored, but they were desperate to avoid the Repr√©sentant en mission (government agent accompanying the republican forces) ordering that the town should be burned down. Their concern was based on a National Convention civil war decree that any town taken by the Vend√©e without a fight should be consigned to flames.Yves Gras, La Guerre de Vend√©e, √©ditions Economica, 1994, p. 102 The \\"Repr√©sentant\\" Jean-Baptiste Le Carpentier fueled the town council's concerns, accusing the townsfolk of cowardice or treason: \\"In a few more days, dear comrade citizens, I hope to be able to announce the annihilation of the new Vend√©e by the Channel and to incinerate, if necessary, the infamous Avranchinais(es)\\" (\\"Encore quelques jours, citoyens coll√®gues, et j'esp√®re vous annoncer l'an√©antissement de la nouvelle Vend√©e de la Manche et br√ªler, s'il est n√©cessaire, l'inf√¢me Avranches1\\"). Learning that the Vend√©ens had left between 55 and 60 of their people, injured or ill, in the town hospital, one of the first concerns of the council was to order that these be shot. The victims were led from the hospital to a field nearby where they were killed by a firing squad. The council sent a suitably worded report of the affair to the powerful Committee of Public Safety in Paris.Report of the republican administrators of Avranches to the Committee of Public Safety in Paris: ¬´Aussit√¥t que nous avons √©t√© inform√©s que l'arm√©e sc√©l√©rate avait √©vacu√© la ville, nous nous sommes empress√©s d'y rentrer et de reprendre nos fonctions. Un de nos premiers soins a √©t√© de faire fusiller 55 √† 60 de ces coquins, qui √©taient √† l'h√¥pital. Nous nous sommes occup√©s, sans perdre de temps, des moyens de d√©couvrir et de livrer au glaive de la loi ces √™tres l√¢ches et perfides qui, sans avoir le courage de se joindre √† la horde fanatique, ont partag√© ses forfaits en lui indiquant des patriotes √† piller et √† √©gorger. ¬ª The same day, Repr√©sentant Laplanche was informed that there were still a number of counter revolutionary rebels hiding in and around the town. He ordered that the town and surrounding villages be combed by troops: this led to the discovery and capture of about 800 identified as rebel royalists. Most of these were injured or sick. They were now taken to the Plateau de Changeons on the edge of town where they were grouped together and en circled by three musketeer battalions which fired into the group until there were none left alive. Retribution continued for several days, with people suspected of having joined the Vend√©ens imprisoned or killed. A number of bodies were later recovered of people who had drowned in the S√©lune River while trying to escape. Others were simply shot by the \\"Carpentier Commission\\".

After being under years of French colonial rule followed by Japanese rule during the war, Vietnam began to seek independence.Hammer, Ellen (1954). The Struggle for Indochina. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press. pp. 30‚Äì34. Specifically, the Japanese renounced French claims to the Vietnamese territory on March 9, 1945, officially declaring Vietnam independent over France and under the control of Emperor B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i. This was counteracted by a rebellion on September 2, 1945, when Ho Chi Minh and his guerilla army declared the official birth of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Ho Chi Minh became the leader of the Vietnamese Communist Party, and demanded complete autonomy from Europe. The French disregarded these claims of autonomy and quickly moved to resettle Vietnam as a member for the French Union. However, complete colonization was no longer an option due to power dynamics in the west and on March 6, 1946, after receiving pressure from the western allies, Jean Sainteny, French Commissioner for Northern Indochina met with Ho Chi Minh in Hanoi and signed the Ho‚ÄìSainteny agreement. The agreement officially gave Vietnam independence as \\"a free state with its own government, parliament, army and finances, forming part of the Indochinese Federation and the French Union\\".Hammer, Ellen (1954).

At the time of the signing, it was widely thought that Ho Chi Minh had given many concessions to the French. By allowing the continued presence of the French army, Ho allowed for a continuation of the French colonial control of the past. The Communist newspaper Les Temps modernes criticized the signing of the deal, calling the agreement \\"the lamentable surrender of all our [Communists] ideological and political plans\\". On the French side, Thierry d'Argenlieu illustrated French optimism regarding the treaty in a communiqu√© he wrote to the Parisian government: \\"On the French level, the armed forces are assured of a friendly reception and we are pre-empting any reproach for opening hostilities ... We are fully safeguarding French economic and cultural interests now and for the future.\\" Vietnamese worries in regards to the agreement soon came to fruition as France began to exert the same colonial authority it had formally denounced in the treaty. France created a virtual naval blockade of Haiphong by continuing to have a strong naval presence in the Gulf of Tonkin.Hammer, Ellen (1954). The Struggle for Indochina. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press. pp. 182. That led the Vietnamese to reach out for peace talks to curb French influence in the region. These peace talks came in the form of the Fontainebleau Agreements, which occurred at the Palace of Fontainebleau and were led by Ph·∫°m VƒÉn ƒê·ªìng for the Vietnamese and Max Andr√© on the side of the French, beginning on July 6, 1946.Lockhart, Bruce McFarland, and William J. Duiker. Historical Dictionary of Vietnam. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, 2006. Print. The conference at the palace was held to discuss the provisions of the Ho-Sainteny Agreement. At the conference, the French refused to revise the original treaty in any way. The Vietnamese leadership, led by Ho Chi Minh, settled to sign a modus vivendi, postponing talks to a later date. These talks never occurred due to the outbreak of violence in November. The Incident Dumont d'Urville in Dutch East Indies, 1930-1936 On the morning of November 20, 1946, a French patrol ship seized a Chinese junk attempting to bring contraband into Haiphong. While seemingly routine, the seizure of the ship was the beginning of a chain of unfortunate events. Vietnamese soldiers reacted to the seizure by firing on the French ship from the shore. Armed clashes immediately broke out on land between French and Vietnamese nationalists. The French immediately worked to dissipate the conflict and stopped the outbreak by agreeing to respect Vietnamese sovereignty in Haiphong on November 22, 1946. This, however, was only the beginning of the incident. Once the news of the skirmish came to Admiral d'Argenlieu in Paris, he sent a cable to Jean √âtienne Valluy, commander of French forces in Indochina, ordering him to use force against the Vietnamese in Haiphong. Valluy, in turn, sent an order to Colonel Deb√®s, commander of the French troops at Haiphong, stating, \\"It appears clear that we are up against premeditated aggressions carefully staged by the Vietnamese regular army ... The moment has come to give a severe lesson to those who have treacherously attacked you. Use all the means at your disposal to make yourself complete master of Haiphong.\\"Quoted in Institut franco-suisse d'√âtudes coloniales, France et Viet-Nam, p. 42Hammer, Ellen (1954). The Struggle for Indochina. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press. pp. 183. Deb√®s then issued an ultimatum to the Vietnamese in Haiphong demanding a withdrawal from the French section and Chinese sections of the city, including the port. In the order, Deb√®s invoked the Franco-Chinese agreement of February 28, 1946 as justification for demanding the Vietnamese evacuation of parts of the city. Deb√®s argued that the treaty gave France protective rights over the Chinese in Vietnam and thus gave them jurisdiction to engage in combat. After the Vietnamese failed to evacuate in time, the French began a bombardment of the Vietnamese sections of the city, using three French avisos Maurice Va√Øsse, L'Arm√©e fran√ßaise dans la guerre d'Indochine (1946-1954) : Adaptation ou inadaptation, 2000, : Chevreuil (Chamois-class minesweeping sloop)Bombardement de haiphong, Savorgnan de Brazza and Dumont d'UrvilleLa Terre du Dragon, tome 1. The communist activist Henri Martin wrote that the cruiser Suffren and fighter planes participated in the operation, but this is a lieHammer, Ellen (1954). The Struggle for Indochina. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press. p. 185. By November 28, 1946, Colonel Deb√®s had taken complete control over the town. While reports about the total number of casualties from the bombardment range widely from upwards of twenty thousand to less than one hundred.\\"Haiphong, Shelling of\\". Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War: A Political, Social, and Military History. Ed. Spencer C. Tucker. Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2011. Credo Reference. Web. 17 Feb. 2016. Today it is widely agreed that the number of casualties is very close to six thousand as reported by the French sociologist Paul Mus. Aftermath = Attempted reconciliation = Immediately after the shelling, the French government sought peace. All violence was ended by the afternoon of November 22 and tensions seemed to have been alleviated. This was not the case. Less than two weeks after the shelling, after receiving pressure from Paris to \\"teach the Vietnamese a lesson\\" General Morli√®re ordered a complete Vietnamese withdrawal from the city, demanding all Viet Minh military elements to be evacuated from Haiphong.Hammer, Ellen (1954). The Struggle for Indochina. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press. pp. 184. By early December, 1946, Haiphong was under complete French military occupation. The aggressive actions of the French regarding the occupation of Haiphong made it clear in the eyes of the Viet Minh that the French intended on maintaining a colonial presence in Vietnam.Le Monde, December 10, 1946Modelski, George. \\"The Viet Minh Complex\\". Communism and Revolution: The Strategic Uses of Political Violence. Ed. Cyril E. Black and Thomas P. Thornton. Princeton University Press, 1964. 185‚Äì214. Web. The threat of the French establishing a separate southern state in Vietnam by besieging the city of Hanoi became a top priority for the Viet Minh to counteract. On December 2, as a final effort to maintain good relations between the two nations, French Commissioner Sainteny (of the Ho‚ÄìSainteny agreement) visited Hanoi to reach an agreement for a ceasefire. This proved unsuccessful as the French insistence on maintaining complete military control of Haiphong stalled all negotiations. The December 16 election of the socialist L√©on Blum as the Premier of France offered hope to Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnamese, as the French socialists had a much more tolerant policy towards Vietnamese independence. That however, proved to be false hope as by the time Blum came into office, violence between the Vietnamese and French was already widespread. = The onset of war = As relations between France and Vietnam continued to worsen, Ho Chi Minh issued a plea for peace between the two nations on December 12, stating, \\"Neither France nor Viet Nam can afford the luxury of a bloody war\\".Hammer, Ellen (1954). The Struggle for Indochina. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press. pp. 187. Ho, however, was not completely supported in his call for peace. V√µ Nguy√™n Gi√°p, leader of the Vietnamese army was convinced that open confrontation was inevitable. Giap was certain that the takeover of Haiphong signaled France's intent to attack and take over Hanoi.Dalloz, Jacques; Bacon, Josephine (1990). The War in Indo-China 1945‚Äì1954. Dublin: Barnes and Noble Ltd. p. 80. . This led to Giap focusing on arming the Hanoi militias in preparation for an attack.Dalloz, Jacques; Bacon, Josephine (1990). The War in Indo-China 1945‚Äì1954. Dublin: Barnes and Noble Ltd. p. 81. . The Vietnamese media reflected the concerns of General Giap. In an article on December 10, 1946, a Hanoi newspaper stated, \\"The grave hour has arrived. The Hanoi Committee of the Vi·ªát Minh Front calls on the people to be calm, to be united, and to be ready to rise when the government gives the order [to rebel against the French].\\" The Vietnamese people, in turn, reacted to the plea to prepare, building barricades in the streets of Hanoi and engaging in armed skirmishes with French legionnaires.Duiker, William J. The American Historical Review 94.4 (1989): 1156‚Äì1157. Web The final ultimatum to the Vietnamese was issued on December 19, when General Morli√®re ordered the leading Viet Minh militia, Tu Ve, to completely disarm. That night, all electricity was turned off in Hanoi and the city was left in complete darkness.Smith, R. B. \\"Towards a History of Vietnam, 1941‚Äì75\\". Modern Asian Studies 16.2 (1982): 311‚Äì333. Web The Vietnamese (specifically the Tu Ve militia) attacked the French from within Hanoi with machine guns, artillery, and mortars.Zhai, Qiang. Contemporary Southeast Asia 32.2 (2010): 305‚Äì306. Web Thousands of French soldiers and Vietnamese civilians lost their lives. The French reacted by storming Hanoi the following day, forcing the Vietnamese government to take refuge outside of the city.Devillers, Phillipe; Lacouture, Jean (1969). End of a War, Indochina, 1954. London: Pall Mall Pres. p. 10. Ho Chi Minh himself was forced to flee Hanoi for a more remote mountainous area. The attack can be characterized as a preemptive strike against the French after the overtaking of Haiphong endangered Vietnamese claims to Hanoi and all of Vietnam. The uprising in Hanoi escalated the aggression between the French and Viet Minh into the First Indochina War.

It is directed and produced by Amna Nawaz Khan under her production company and written by Khalil-ur-Rehman Qamar. It stars Zahid Ahmed, Yumna Zaidi and Sana Javed.  Plot  The story revolves around Hadi (Zahid Ahmed) and Mahnoor (Sana Javed), who are first cousins and married (Nikkah). Hadi is a simple man, with a limited earning but earnestly in love with Mahnoor. He lives in a rented room in a house owned by Ikhtiar Ali (Rashid Farooqui). Ikhtiar and his college- going daughter Uzma (Yumna Zaidi) both hold Hadi in high regard due to his impeccable character and calm demeanor. Hadi is immensely caring and protective towards Mahnoor, whom he treats as the center of his universe. He is also broad-minded and encourages Mahnoor to work and be self-sufficient. Uzma, who is unaware that Hadi is married, is drawn to him due to his likeable nature. She ends up writing a letter to Hadi confessing her crush on him. Hadi gently rebukes her, letting her know that he is married and deeply in love with Mahnoor. He shows the letter to Mahnoor thinking that he should not hide anything from his wife. Mahnoor on the other hand is not as emotionally invested in the relationship as Hadi. Her selfish side emerges when she meets her new neighbour Waqar who teaches Urdu in a local college. Mahnoor finds Waqar wealthier and more attractive than Hadi. Her greed leads to her asking Hadi for divorce so that she can marry Waqar. Her selfish act creates a rift between her and her mother Aneesa (Saba Faisal (actress)) and leaves Hadi heart-broken. Although deeply hurt, Hadi agrees to divorce Mahnoor as he believes Mahnoor's feelings for Waqar to be genuine. He agrees to the divorce in order to preserve his own self-respect and also because he believes in letting go the woman who doesn't love him. Mahnoor asks Waqar to marry her on the same day that she gets divorce from Hadi, to which Waqar tacitly agrees. However, unbeknownst to Mahnoor, Waqar is an opportunist and has interest in women only for their wealth. He is hired to teach Urdu to Geeti (Sharmeen), who is the daughter of a renowned politician Deswali (Adnan Jilani). Geeti has recently returned from USA to contest upcoming elections from the town to which Waqar belongs. Waqar leaves for his hometown without informing Mahnoor, with his house help Umerdeen in his tow. While learning Urdu from Waqar, Geeti starts to get attracted to him. He accompanies her on her campaign tours, which allows them to spend more and more time together, strengthening her feeling for him. Eventually, Geeti confesses her feelings to Waqar, who feels elated to have won the heart of a powerful politician's daughter. Aneesa, concerned about the future of her daughter, manages to find Waqar's whereabouts and hands them over to Mahnoor so that she can find out his plans. Mahnoor, ecstatic at finally having received Waqar's whereabouts, calls him. Waqar acts innocent about his sudden departure, hints at being in some sort of trouble and promises to meet Mahnoor after a couple of months after he has had the chance to settle the matters he is involved with. Waqar's response makes Mahnoor suspicious and she seemingly grows repentant for her behaviour towards Hadi. She tries to apologize to Hadi without her mother's knowledge in order to move towards a possible reconciliation. However, Hadi does not forgive her immediately, still nursing his hurt self-respect. Mahnoor grows desperate and asks Hadi to remarry her, in blatant disregard of religious and social norms. Mahnoor's act leaves Hadi even more heart-broken because he sees Mahnoor taking marriage, commitment, love and relationships so lightly. He starts to wonder whether he is ready to suffer another heart-break by remarrying Mahnoor, despite still loving her to his core. Waqar's soaring dreams come crashing down when Geeti's brother discovers his schemes. Waqar gets beaten up, is warned to stay away from Geeti, gets threatened to marry immediately and leave the city. Helpless against the might of Geeti's brother, Waqar leaves the city as advised. Feeling cheated by Waqar, Mahnoor decides to get back with Hadi at all costs. However, she can do so only by marrying another man, divorcing him and waiting for a mandatory period before remarrying Hadi. Jealous of Uzma who she fears may take Hadi away from her, she asks Hadi to leave Uzma's house and find another accommodation. Uzma too asks Hadi to leave after she is accused by Mahnoor of trying to win over Hadi. A helpless Hadi leaves Uzma's house and takes up accommodation in another house, owned by (Fauzia Mushtaq). There he meets Anushay (Maryam Fatima), her grand-daughter. Hadi comes to know that Anushay is the new girlfriend of Waqar and unaware of Waqar's past, she is looking forward to marry him. Hadi tries to stop her by sharing Waqar's past deeds with her and her grandmother; but stubborn by nature, Anushay isn't willing to give up on Waqar and ends up marrying him. Geeti's brother gets arrested for a road accident and she learns that her father and brother have planted false evidence and witnesses to take the blame away from her brother. Disgusted, she decides to leave the country and go back to US but tracks down Waqar for one final meeting to thank him for introducing her to the world of deceit. This triggers a change of heart in Waqar who decides to lead a life of honesty and decency with Anushay. However, as fate would have it, Anushay gets murdered at their home and all evidence points towards Waqar, who gets sent to prison for his life. Hadi comes across Umerdeen and convinces him to marry Mahnoor for one day so that he and Mahnoor can get married. Umerdeen agrees to this and a relieved Hadi breaks this news to Mahnoor. However, he ends up overhearing Mahnoor telling her mother that she is marrying Hadi only out of pity. She further goes on to say that she finds Hadi's company unbearable and that she would treat her impending marriage to him as a prison for life. A disgusted Hadi finally wakes up to Mahnoor's true nature and regrets his selfless devotion to her. Mahnoor marries Umerdeen, thinking that he would divorce her the next day, only to find out to her shock that Umerdeen has no such intentions. He hands out a letter to her before taking her with him to his hometown. The letter has been written by Hadi who rebukes her for her selfishness and lack of respect for others. He also expresses his disappointment over Mahnoor's lack of acknowledgement for his love and care. He reveals his heartbreak to her after overhearing her conversation with her mother where she compared the prospects a life with Hadi to a lifelong prison sentence. He further writes that it was he who effected the change of plans with Umerdeen, even though he had to resort to deceit to do so, going against his nature and principles. Uzma too is in for a shock as she discovers Hadi at her doorstep, finally acknowledging her love for him and asking her to marry him, to which she agrees.

It was eventually (and later controversially) cancelled in favour of the Challenger 1, itself an evolution of the Chieftain design. History By the early 1970s, there was a great disparity in the number of tanks being fielded by NATO and the Warsaw Pact in Europe. The US Army fielded the M60 Patton which had been designed to deal with the 100 mm gun of the T-55, but this was not competitive against the 115 mm gun being fielded on the T-62, let alone the newer 125 mm model of the T-64 and T-72. The same-era West German design, the Leopard 1, was very lightly armored based on the conclusion that heavy armor had little purpose in an era of high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) weapons of rapidly improving performance. This decision proved unwise as the number of Soviet tanks grew and the idea of outmaneuvering their massed numbers did not appear to be workable. In 1963 the United States and West Germany started a joint project to develop a new tank to be used by both forces, the MBT-70. The only force with a tank able to go head to head with the latest Soviet types was the British Army's Chieftain, introduced to service in 1967. The Chieftain had heavy armor designed specifically to defeat the 115 mm, and mounted a 120 mm gun, among the most powerful in the world, able to defeat even the latest Soviet armor. When the 125 mm gun was introduced by the Soviets, the \\"Stillbrew armor\\" package was added to keep the tank competitive. However, the Chieftain had a number of problems due to its rather poor engine and outdated suspension, both of which conspired to make cross-country performance rather limited. By the late 1960s, the MBT-70 project had repeatedly overrun its development budget and the US Congress eventually canceled it. The Germans were still looking for a tank to replace their now outdated Leopards, as well as the many M48 Patton tanks they still had in service. A new joint program was formed between the UK and West Germany to develop a Future Main Battle Tank (FMBT). This was expected to replace the Chieftain tanks starting in the 1980s, as well as the older West German tanks. In 1977, Frederick Mulley, then Secretary of State for Defence, announced that, while both countries had agreed on the specifications of the joint tank, the replacement timetables diverged to such a degree that collaboration was not practicable at that time. The cancellation of the MBT-70 had led the US to begin the development of its own design, the XM1. Prototypes arrived in 1976 with production slated for the late 1970s, and using the UK's new Chobham armor, it was emerging as a potent design. When carefully examined by the British Army, a number of issues became apparent. Notable was the 105 mm gun, which did not have the power to defeat the latest Soviet designs at long range, the preferred action for British tankers. Moreover, the armor package had been designed to defeat either the 115 mm firing APFSDS or 125 mm firing HEAT, but would not be capable of stopping the 125 mm firing APFSDS at reasonable range. In spite of this, the desire to replace the Chieftain with a more mobile design remained, and there was some consideration given to importing XM1 hulls and turrets and then fitting them out with British-made components such as engine, transmission, and the 120 mm gun from the Chieftain on a domestic production line in order to produce a new tank. Reports on the XM1 were not favorable though. Ultimately the UK instead officially began development of the MBT-80 in September 1978. This new project would build on work already carried out by the Military Vehicles and Engineering Establishment (MVEE) as far back as 1968, when they had produced a tank prototype with an external (in other words unmanned) turret. This was followed in 1978 by another tank prototype fitted with Chobham armour. This later prototype was based on the Chieftain design, and had the designation FV4211. Design The MBT-80 was designed to counter all current and future armoured threats from the Eastern Bloc, combining a rifled gun, advanced composite armour and increased mobility onto one platform. Other design features included the use of a David Brown Gear Industries TN-38 transmission, a Sperry/Vickers stabilised panoramic sight for use by the tank commander, and an advanced vetronics suite incorporating Ferranti F100-L microprocessors. The MBT-80 would have also been the first operational British tank to have a crew compartment with a full environmental system, i.e. able to provide both heating and cooling for the crew. =Armament= The primary armament of the MBT-80 was to be a 120 mm rifled gun, the EXP-28M1, similar in some respects to the main guns found on the Chieftain and later the Challenger 1 and Challenger 2 main battle tanks, but a new design in its own right. It was an advanced development of the Royal Ordnance L11A5 tank gun, designed by the Royal Armament Research and Development Establishment (RARDE), and utilising a split-block breach mechanism. It was one of the first tank guns to use an Electro Slag Refined Steel (ESRS) barrel. This new barrel was intended to greatly increase the fatigue life of British 120mm tank guns. The technology had been cleared for use by new tank gun designs in 1976. The fire-control system was able to access and process relevant target, environmental and gun status data from various internal and external sensors including laser rangefinders and thermal imagers in order for the main gun to be able to accurately and consistently hit targets under the most adverse of conditions (\\"First shot, first kill\\"). Major components of the FCS included the Fire Control Computer which was the 'brains' of the FCS, the Gun Control Equipment, and the STAMPLAR sight (see below), all of which were connected together by a fully digital databus. The FCS was also designed with self-diagnostic capabilities. The commander and gunner had duplicate turret/main gun controls, so either of them could aim and fire the main gun. Ammunition for the EXP-28M1 would have included APFSDS, APDS-T, HEAT, HESH, and Smoke-white phosphorus rounds. Secondary armament would have included a 7.62mm L37A1 General Purpose Machine Gun mounted on the commander's cupola, which could be aimed and fired from within the tank. L2A1 \\"ball\\" and L5A1 tracer rounds would have been among the ammunition available for this weapon. =Protection= The MBT-80 was going to be primarily protected by the recently developed Chobham armour, first fielded on the American M1 Abrams. The armour would have provided greater resistance against high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rounds and kinetic energy penetrators. Thanks to the use of Chobham armour, it was anticipated that much greater use could be made of high grade aluminium alloy in the construction of the hull (the turret was steel) than in previous tank designs, helping to keep down the overall weight of the tank and therefore improve mobility and associated logistics, not to mention transportation of the tank to where it would be needed. The tank would also have had among other protection features a full active] NBC defences, something that was becoming more common on military vehicles being designed and/or introduced in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This included both advanced NBC sensors and radiation/electromagnetic interference (including electromagnetic pulse) shielding to help protect the crew and vehicle systems. An extensive electronic warfare system including a dedicated electronic counter-countermeasure capability was also to be included. This system would have incorporated various countermeasures against such threats as RPGs and 1st through 3rd generation anti-tank missiles. As a thermal signature management measure, the exhaust gases from the Rolls-Royce CV12 TCA Condor engine would have been mixed with cooling air prior to being discharged outside the tank. This feature was also used on the Vickers Valiant MBT. Mounted on the sides of the turret would have been two L8A1 six barreled 66 mm smoke grenade dischargers, the same British system was used as the M250 grenade launchers found on early models of the M1 Abrams. =Mobility= The MBT-80 was to have a longer range, more mobility and greater speed than previous tanks. Two options were considered; the Honeywell AGT1500 gas turbine engine used by the United States's prototype XM1 Abrams tank, producing 1,500 hp, and a modified, turbocharged version of the Rolls-Royce CV12 diesel engine, also producing 1,500 hp. The CV12 was eventually picked, primarily due to the fact that the AGT1500 would require substantial modification of the tank to suit the associated transmission that came with the engine, which had been specially designed for the XM1. The higher fuel consumption of the gas turbine engine was also a factor in choosing the diesel engine. The CV12 was expected to be produced at Rolls-Royce's Shrewsbury plant. =Sensors= Known sensors included: *Sperry/Vickers stabilised sight for tank commander - Daytime sight only with x1 x10 magnification. *PANTILI (Panoramic, Thermal Imager, Laser Integrated Sight) - 360 degree rotating thermal imager fitted with a () laser rangefinder. Accessible to both commander & gunner. Similar in concept to the 'hunter-killer' sight found on the later Challenger 2 tank. *Two axis stabilised monocular gunners sight incorporating a laser rangefinder and muzzle reference system, magnification x2-3 and x10. Backup telescope with x8 magnification also provided. *Driver's thermal imager - possibly the Barr & Stroud IR18 TVFS but this is unconfirmed. The IR18 was later used as part of the Challenger 1's TOGS (Thermal Observation and Gunnery Sight) system. *STAMPLAR (Sight, Thermal, Armoured, Periscope, LAser Rangefinder) - Part of the fire control system. Directly tied into the Fire Control Computer via a digital databus. *Roof-mounted infra-red detector - Part of the NBC defence suite, it could detect airborne chemical agents and radioactive fallout. Later available as an option on the Chieftain 900 tank. Versions and variants Among the projected vehicles based on the MBT-80 chassis were a SPAAG using the turret of the Flakpanzer Gepard, an AVLB, and an ARV. None of these had progressed beyond the concept stage at the time of the programme's unexpected cancellation. Cancellation In the aftermath of the Iranian Revolution, all orders for weapons from the United Kingdom were cancelled, including those for Shir 2 tanks. The British defence industry was heavily reliant on the Iranian market, forcing the government to cut the number of workers at ROF Leeds. At this same time, the government was looking into how they could still retain the skill and capacity at Leeds that would be needed to produce the next generation of main battle tanks. Despite attempts to put the tank into production as quickly as possible, it would not be until the mid-1980s that the MBT-80 would be ready for production even if development was drastically accelerated. In addition, there were increasing worries that Soviet tank technology was advancing at a such a rate that new designs, such as the T-80, reportedly about to enter service would render existing front line British MBTs obsolescent much sooner than had been previously predicted. Ultimately, the entire programme was cancelled in favour of the Challenger, which had been developed from the Shir 2 as a private venture. and would be in theory available for service by 1983 to replace the Chieftain tanks instead. With its adoption as an official programme, the Challenger was also known for a time as the MBT-85. However, various research elements of the MBT-80 programme were continued in order to develop and mature advanced technology for the next generation of British MBTs to enter service in the early 1990s, the design of which was to be provided by the new MBT-95 programme, launched in late 1982. In the event though, the MBT-95 was superseded by the Challenger 2 programme in 1987 in part due to financial and political considerations and partly due to the unexpectedly poor performance of the original Challenger in early trials, exercises and the like which seemed to indicate an urgent need for a replacement tank in the near term, and not just to replace the remaining Chieftains as originally planned. However, the Challenger 2 was not officially chosen as the British Army's new tank until late 1991, by which time the Challenger 1's problems had been resolved, with it having racked up an excellent operational record in the Gulf War. The MBT-80 was planned for development to be completed in 1987 and production by 1989. By 1989 the Challenger tank at the same point in time, despite having been in production for nearly seven years and officially in service for over four of those, was widely considered to be still not fully operational. Surviving vehicles Two test rigs were built to test the various systems that would be used in the planned MBT-80. The first, Automotive Test Rig 1 (ATR1), had a hull assembled from Shir 2 prototypes derived from the Chieftain, removable blocks of armour that either contained Chobham or steel designed to imitate it, and a dummy tank gun. It could also move under its own propulsion. ATR1 fell into the hands of a private collector but is currently in bad condition. The second rig, ATR2, was designed to test the ability to weld aluminium and steel tank hulls together to reduce weight. It also had a different turret design from the ATR1 and possesses advanced sights that were state-of-the-art at the time of construction. ATR2 is currently displayed in the Vehicle Conservation Centre of the Bovington Tank Museum in Dorset.

It was originally planned to consist of 13 episodes, however it was later changed to 10.  Production  The show's seventh season changes its setting from New York City to Los Angeles and follows the main characters as they run a private investigation agency in Hollywood. While developing the season, the creative team took inspiration from Magnum, P.I. when writing the stories and they also used the series' location switch to change the series from the 1960s-aesthetic of prior seasons forward to 1970s-style, which included new clothing for the main characters. The seventh season also marked the first time the show had a composer, J. G. Thirlwell, scoring the soundtrack for the season, a notable difference from previous seasons, in which only the opening and ending music themes were made by composers (Scott Sims and Mel Young, respectively), and the episodes used stock library music. On February 1, 2016, a trailer for the show's seventh season was released. The trailer was a shot-for-shot remake of the opening scene of Magnum, P.I.

On July 27, 2015, Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Senator Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) introduced the bill in the Senate with support and leadership from Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV). About The Anna Westin Act of 2015 is written to help those affected by eating disorders get the care they need by focusing on improved training and clarity of mental health parity. The bill is designed to have a zero CBO score. In addition, the House of Representatives version of the Anna Westin Act includes the truth in advertising act, a small inter- agency study looking at digitally altered images of humans as they related to fair advertising practices. The three components of the bill are as follows: * Training: The Anna Westin Act of 2015 will help prevent eating disorders by using existing NIMH and SAMHSA funds to provide training for health professionals and school personnel to identify eating disorders and intervene early when precursory symptoms and behaviors arise. * Clarity of Mental Health Parity: The Anna Westin Act of 2015 aims to provide better health insurance treatment coverage for those affected by eating disorders. The legislation clarifies the intent of former Congressman Jim Ramstad (R-MN) and former Congressman Patrick Kennedy (D-RI) to include residential treatment services in their past bipartisan legislation, the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (the Parity Law), which required insurance providers to cover people with mental illness equally as those with other health issues. * Truth in Advertising: The House bill (H.R. 2515) requires the Federal Trade Commission to conduct a small inter-agency study and report on digitally altered images of humans and fair advertising practices. History Anna WestinThe Anna Westin Act of 2015 received its name in observance of 21-year-old Anna Westin. Anna grew up living with her mom, dad and sisters in the small town of Chaska, Minnesota. When Anna was 16, she developed anorexia. Anna received outpatient treatment for her eating disorder and Anna and her family thought her treatment was successful. Unfortunately, when Anna returned from college her sophomore year, her parents realized she had relapsed and was suffering from severe anorexia. Anna‚Äôs family took her to the doctor and Anna was told she needed to be hospitalized. When Anna went to be admitted to the hospital, Anna‚Äôs insurer refused to cover inpatient treatment. Shortly thereafter, on February 17, 2000, Anna died from suicide as a direct result of her battle with anorexia. Kitty Westin, Anna's mother, established Minnesota‚Äôs The Anna Westin Foundation (now The Emily Program Foundation) and other resources to help people experiencing eating disorders.

Due to Legge Amato, a Societ√† per azioni that runs bank activity, and a banking foundation that runs charity activities, were formed on 7 April 1992 (gazetted on 29 April). The foundation immediately sold about 51% shares to an intermediate holding company \\"Holding Casse Toscane\\" (literally Tuscan saving banks holding), which also consist of the saving banks () of Florence, Livorno, Pisa, Pistoia, San Miniato as well as Banca del Monte di Lucca. CR Lucca received about 18% shares of the holding, making the foundation hold about 49% shares of their own bank directly, or about 58.18% directly and indirectly combined.

This zone permits only vehicles that have an environmental badge, or a green sticker, to enter. The policy was put into place in January 2008 due to the high density of Berlin‚Äôs inner city being affected by pollutants such as fine dust (PM 10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) threatening human health. Definition The pollution from vehicles highly affects human health in Berlin and surrounding areas, as well as a very high contribution to greenhouse gas emissions and the effect that has on the rest of the planet. It was brought to the forefront in 2002 that Berlin was not falling within the emission limits of these toxins that were set out by the World Health Organization for Europe and Copenhagen.WHO Regional Office for Europe and Copenhagen. (2000). Air Quality Guidelines for Europe. WHO Regional Publications p. 32 Part of the Berlin Governments‚Äô additional measures to mitigate this issue, was the Environmental Zone. The Environmental Zone is part of Berlin‚Äôs Air Quality Plan to reduce the emissions from vehicles focusing specifically on particulate matter (PM 10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Sixteen monitoring stations where set up in the city to record pollution concentrations in an effort to eventually narrow it down to a specific area of the city that required the most focus.Senate Department for Urban Development and the Environment .

Types  This system is controlled through what is called ‚Äòenvironment bandage classification‚Äô which categorizes cars based on the emissions they release. To attain an environmental badge, your vehicle must meet certain exhaust standards. There are four pollutant classes for diesel, and two for petrol, all based on the European emission standards set by The World Health Organization for Europe and Copenhagen. There are 6 stages ranging from Euro 1, which was released in 1993, to Euro 6, which was released in 2014, each one becoming more stringent each year.Diesel Net. (2015, 1).

This may seem like an insignificant issue, but these small increases continuously offset the natural balance of Earth.

Charly Bliss is Eva Hendricks (lead vocals, guitar), Spencer Fox (vocals, guitar), Sam Hendricks (drums), and Dan Shure (vocals, bass). History Eva and Sam Hendricks grew up in Westport, Connecticut, the children of devoted music fans. Eva first developed her interests in musical theater and also sang jingles for local commercials. She first met Spencer Fox, a former child actor who voiced Dash Parr in the 2004 film The Incredibles, outside of a Tokyo Police Club show at New York's Webster Hall. Fox moved to Westport mid-way through his junior year of high school and began collaborating with Eva on songs. Their earliest recordings, more acoustic, folk-based, and recorded in her bedroom, were posted to YouTube. Eva planned to go to New York University (NYU)'s Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music post-graduation, and wanted to have a finished product to enter the program with. She and Fox recorded an extended play under the Charly Bliss name, simply titled EP, which posted to Bandcamp in 2011. Their first tour was a six-month stint across Connecticut that was sparsely attended by friends and \\"a few drunk townies\\". Eva went on to attend NYU, while Fox attended the State University of New York at Purchase, and Sam Hendricks diverged to attend Ohio's Miami University. Their second EP, A Lot to Say, was released in 2013. The first iteration of Charly Bliss included bassist Kevin Copeland, who eventually left to pursue other interests. They toured consistently, opening for bands such as Sleater-Kinney, Wolf Parade, and Veruca Salt. In June 2014, they released the EP Soft Serve, which included a three-part video series as well as a comic book trilogy. After Copeland's exit, the band recruited Dan Shure on bass. He and Fox had met at theater camp as children and were longtime friends. At that time, Shure was directing off-Broadway productions but was an early fan of the band and did not want to miss the opportunity to join. They began recording their debut album, Guppy, in 2015, but shelved the first result, feeling as though it did not sound like them. \\"We were really highlighting the aspects of our sound that make us a garage band, or a punk band,\\" Eva remarked in a later interview. But the group came around to the fact that each member favored pop music above all, and they re-recorded Guppy with this renewed focus in mind.

The film was produced and directed by Stanley Hawes. The film's French version title is La Femme et la Guerre. Synopsis In 1940, as Canadian men are being mobilized to serve in the military, three million women are also mobilized to serve in the \\"home front\\". For the second time in a generation, women again have shouldered the burden of maintaining the households and taking on roles that will allow men to fight. From playing a role in hospitals and medical research, industrial labour, hospitality, education and domesticity, the service these women provided to their country is significant. On the home front, women can strengthen the war effort by strengthening the household, and, if they can, to enter the industrial workforce to supplement men in many positions at munitions factories. Women can take on specialized civilian roles such as driving heavy equipment or flight training at flying clubs. In the military, Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) women became clerks, drivers, photographers, air photo interpreters, weather observers, instrument mechanics, parachute riggers as well as many administrative and technical positions in the RCAF. Most women served at British Commonwealth Air Training Plan stations across Canada. As the stress of \\"total war\\" becomes greater, it is imperative that women in important organizations such as the Red Cross can play a dominant role on the home front. From its headquarters in Toronto, the Red Cross is in touch with depots and workrooms across the country where women provide services that \\"lessen the suffering of others\\". Others such as the Women's Institutes and Imperial Order Daughters of the Empire also provide essential services, such as raising funds for weapons of war. Women will also play a part after the war, in building a new world. Cast * Elsie MacGill, aircraft designer * Helen Harrison, flight instructor * Mrs. W.R.

Each film in the Canada Carries On series was shown over a six-month period as part of the shorts or newsreel segments in approximately 800 theatres across Canada. The NFB had an arrangement with Famous Players theatres to ensure that Canadians from coast-to-coast could see them, with further distribution by Columbia Pictures.Ellis and McLane 2005, p. 122. After the six-month theatrical tour ended, individual films were made available on 16 mm to schools, libraries, churches and factories, extending the life of these films for another year or two. They were also made available to film libraries operated by university and provincial authorities. A total of 199 films were produced before the series was canceled in 1959.Ohayon, Albert. \\"Propaganda cinema at the NFB\\". National Film Board of Canada, July 13, 2009. Retrieved: February 4, 2016. Historian Malek Khouri analyzed the role of the NFB wartime documentaries with The Home Front characterized as an example of a propaganda film. \\"During the early years of the NFB, its creative output was largely informed by the turbulent political and social climate the world was facing. World War II, Communism, unemployment, the role of labour unions, and working conditions were all subjects featured by the NFB during the period from 1939 to 1946\\".Khouri 2007, back cover. The role of women depicted in Home Front also showed an acceptance of a new role to come in postwar years.Ramsay 2011, p. 40. In an examination of the role of the NFB in wartime, historian Gary Evans observed: \\"If contemporary feminists sense omissions and patronizing in the film, one must at least acknowledge that [The Home Front] expressed a positive attitude to working women and was conditioning audiences to become accustomed to new and permanent women's roles in the workplace.\\"Evans 1984, p. 185.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987 for having state-level significance in the themes of architecture and politics/government. It was nominated for its exemplary Romanesque Revival architecture, its status as one of Minnesota's remaining monumental Victorian courthouses and as a local landmark, and its longstanding service as county seat. History When Watonwan County was initially created in 1860, the city of Madelia was designated the county seat and a courthouse was built there around 1861. As St. James‚Äîa more centrally located community and a division headquarters for the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway‚Äîgrew, a heated battle for county seat status erupted between the two cities. When the original wood-frame courthouse burned down in 1872, Madelia officials hastily leased space in a recently completed commercial building‚ÄîFlanders' Block‚Äîto avoid losing county seat status. However St. James interests petitioned for a vote on the matter and in 1874 voters approved the move. The first courthouse in St. James was a wood-frame structure built on land donated by the railroad. A new courthouse, the present building, was designed by Mankato architect H.C. Gerlach and built by Mankato contractor Otto Kleinschmidt from 1895 to 1896. The building served as a show of government strength and traditional values in a city that was only 25 years old. It is monumental in size and design, and a county-wide survey of historic properties identified it as one of the most architecturally significant Victorian buildings in the county.

Biography Broughton was the second son of Andrew and Ann Overton Broughton of Seaton, England, and born around 1668. However, it is not clear whether Thomas Broughton was born in England. He immigrated to South Carolina from the West Indies, possibly from the Leeward Islands, where his father-in-law Sir Nathaniel Johnson, the future Governor of the Province of Carolina (1703-1709) was Governor in 1686-89. The first record of Thomas Broughton in South Carolina was in 1692 when he pledged his allegiance to King William III and Queen Mary II of England. After his arrival in South Carolina he would marry Ann Johnson, the daughter of Sir Nathaniel Johnson and brother of future South Carolina Governor Robert Johnson. Career Broughton rose from captain through to major general in a 10-year stretch between 1696 and 1706. In addition, he held numerous other offices in the colony, including serving as a member of the Commons House of Assembly from 1696 to 1703), 1716 to 1717, and 1725 to 1727; controller and collector of customs (1708); commissioner of Free School at Charles Towne (1710, 1712); assistant to Judge of Admiralty to try men accused of piracy (1716, 1717, 1720); and collector of the Port of Charleston (1721). In 1702 Broughton was appointed as deputy to John Carteret, 2nd Baron Carteret (later 2nd Earl of Granville); and served on the eight-member Executive Council under acting Governor James Moore Jr. and Governor Sir Nathaniel Johnson. Broughton served as speaker of the Assembly from 1725 to 1727, and was named Lt. Governor of the province by a commission of King George II in 1729, the same commission which appointed his brother-in-law Robert Johnson Governor. When Johnson died on May 5, 1735, Broughton, took over as the province‚Äôs chief executive. Broughton died in office on Nov. 22, 1737. His burial site is unknown, but believed to be in South Carolina, quite possibly near his residence, called Mulberry Plantation. Broughton‚Äôs administration was noted for the beginning of constitutional struggles between the Commons House of Assembly and the advisors to the Crown over who had the right to originate grants of money in the province. Broughton‚Äôs residence, Mulberry Plantation, is located on the western branch of the Cooper River, near Moncks Corner in Berkeley County. The residence, built in 1714, is the third-oldest home in South Carolina. During the 1715 Yemassee War, many individuals took refuge at Mulberry as the structure had been constructed over a fortified cellar fort with firing slits in the foundation walls.

Before his patriarchate Athanasius was metropolitan of Thessaloniki. He participated at Patriarch Nikon's book editing reforms in 1653. Athanasius was canonized as an Enlightener into the Synaxis of Athonite Venerables by the Russian Church in the 1670s. His feast date is on 2 (15) May, on the 2nd Week after Pentecost, canonized alongside Athanasius the Great. Enlightener Athanasius, Patriarch of Constantinople, in the Lubensk Monastery, he who rested sitting. Russian icon, 17th century  Biography  Alexios was born to a noble family with roots dating back to the Paleologos Dynasty. His father Georgios was a scientist and publisher, and his elder brother Eustaphios was a physician. For 26 years he lived in Crete in the Arkadi Monastery, which was then under Venetian rule, and received there his education. Alexios knew well philosophy, Ancient Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Arab and Italian language. In 1631 Alexios was consecrated as metropolitan of Thessaloniki; he was under patronage of Patriarch Cyril Lucaris. In early 1634, a third opposition against Lucaris regarding the publication of Eastern Confession of the Christian faith on March 1629 was formed in Fanari, as the document had Calvinist theological lines. In February 1634, Athanasius became Patriarch of Constantinople and was enthroned on 25 March. After several days he was dethroned by Cyril Lucaris, who returned from prison. Athanasius then escaped to the Athos, where he built the skete (where in 1849 the Russian St. Andrew skete was founded), which kept the icon Consolation in Sorrow and Grief (–í —Å–∫–æ—Ä–±–µ—Ö –∏ –ø–µ—á–∞–ª–µ—Ö –£—Ç–µ—à–µ–Ω–∏–µ). After his second deposition in 1635, Athanasius went to Italy, staying in Ancona and Venice. Pope of Rome advised Athanasius to become cardinal and accept the Credo with the Filioque, but the saint declined. In 1637 Athanasius was called to Constantinople. On 26 June 1638, after Lucaris was strangled by the request of Murad IV, Athanasius became a pretender to the patriarchate. Parthenius of Constantinople, Patriarch from 1639 to 1644, required Athanasius to renounce from the patriarchate and return to the Thessaloniki cathedra. Because of the metropolis' taxes, Athanasius was imprisoned twice, and asked the Russian Tsar Michael I for charity. In 1643 he moved to Russia, but on the way there became ill and stayed in Moldavia, by the hospodar Vasily Lupu. In Gala≈£i he founded the St. Nicholas Monastery as a metochion of the St. Catherine's Monastery in Sinai. At that time he wrote the \\"Hymn to the Mother of God\\", and an encomium to Lupu. Athanasius returned to Constantinople in 1652 and took the patriarchate for the third time. Again holding the throne for a short time, Athanasius in July 1652 voluntarily renounced from the patriarchate and ad infinitum left Constantinople. During his last patriarchate, he spoke out a sermon mentioning his dissociation with Catholicism. He again went to Moldavia visiting Lupu in Ia≈üi, then to Chigirin visiting Bohdan Khmelnytsky. With the deeds of those people for the Tsar he reached Moscow on 16 April 1653, and on 22 April visited Tsar Alexey. There he lived at the Kirillov metochion, and made his divine service at the Novospassky Monastery and at the Saviour Cathedral by the Terem Palace. In July 1653 Athanasius visited the Trinity Sergiev Monastery. At the request of Patriarch Nikon, Athanasius wrote The Ordo of the Episcopal Liturgy in the East, which underlined the Muscovian edited Archieratikon of the Episcopal Service, which is used by the Russian Church to date.M. S. Zheltov. Episcopal Liturgy Athanasius delivered the Tsar a notebook in which he stated his main reason for his visit to Moscow; that is, to arouse the Tsar unite with Moldavia and the Cossack Hetmanate for a future war with the Turks, after which the Tsar should become the new Roman Emperor, and the Moscow Patriarch ‚Äì the new Ecumenical Patriarch.

Lithography, 1868 On 1 February 1662, the saint's relics were translated due to the metropolitan of Gaza Paisios Ligaridis, who, visiting Lubensk Monastery, had a vision of Athanasius during his sleep. In 1672, the Tsar requested podyachy M. Savin to investigate the wonders from the relics. In the 18th century, manuscripts of his hagiography and canon were preserved at the Lubensk Monastery. In 1818, Methodius (Pishnyachevsky), bishop of Poltava, applied the Most Holy Synod for the canonization of Athanasius, but the application was declined. However the saint's honouring and recorded wonders from his relics continued. In the 1860s, church historian Andrey Nikolayevich Muravyov created a new hagiography of Athanasius with examples of wonders at his relics. The history of the canonization of Athanasius is vague, but the official honouring began in the Russian Church by the end of the 19th century, although Yevgeny Golubinsky through his works proved that the honouring started between 1672 and 1676 under Joseph (Nelyubovich-Tukalsky), metropolitan of Kiev (Constantinople Orthodox Church). In 1922, the Transfiguration cathedral, including the saint's silver throne, was plundered by the Bolsheviks. The relics were moved to Kharkov in the 1930s. They were eventually preserved in the city's Annunciation Cathedral in 1947. Oil from the relics of Patriarch Athanasius  References   Further reading  # A. V. Ryndina, V.

The offensive successfully broke the three-year Siege of Nubl and Al-Zahraa, effectively cutting off the main supply route of the Syrian rebels from Turkey. Preparations During the latter part of January 2016, reports began circulating of significant Syrian government reinforcements being sent to Aleppo from Damascus, in preparation for a new offensive. Almost 3,000 additional soldiers were deployed. Offensive =Breaking the siege of Nubl and Al-Zahraa= Pro-government forces in the Nubl and Al-Zahraa pocket after breaking the siege. On 1 February 2016, a joint force consisting of the 4th Mechanized Division, NDF, Hezbollah, Kata'ib Hezbollah and Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba (Iranian-backed Iraqi Shi'ite paramilitary organisations), attacked rebel positions around the towns of Duwayr al-Zeytoun and Bashkoy. After securing Duwayr Al-Zeitoun, the SAA and its allies turned north and routed rebels from the town of Tal-Jibbin within the span of two hours. Spearheaded by Hezbollah units, the rebels were next struck at the Al-Mallah farms, where they made a determined defence. Citing this operation, the opposition groups at the Geneva Syria peace talks formally announced on 1 February 2016 that they had opted out and the talks were suspended. Rebel commanders said they hoped the collapse of the peace talks would \\"convince their foreign backers, states including Turkey and Saudi Arabia, that it was time to send them more powerful and advanced weapons, including anti-aircraft missiles\\". One rebel leader said he expects \\"something new, God willing\\" after the failure of the Geneva talks. By 2 February, government forces had pushed north of Tal Jibbin and secured the town of Hardatin. Continuing their assault, the army momentarily captured Ratyan before being repulsed by a rebel counter-attack later in the day. A later effort managed to push deep into Ratyan, bringing 75 percent of the town under government control. In addition to the government advance from the east, the fighters surrounded in the Nubl- Zahra pocket launched a complementary offensive from the west and managed to take some ground. The village of Muarrassat al-Khan was attacked by government forces in a pincer movement on 3 February. The fall of this village opened up a land bridge and broke the siege of Nubl and Al-Zahraa the same day. Residents thanked Assad, Iran and Hezbollah in celebratory scenes from the towns broadcast by Hezbollah's al-Manar. 11 rebel commanders were killed in the operation. =SDF assault launched and the battle for Ratyan= On 4 February, the YPG-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) also launched an offensive against the rebels in northern Aleppo and took control of Ziyara and Khreiybeh, north of Nubl. At the same time, government troops took the towns of Mayer and Kafr Naya. By 5 February, Al-Masdar News and Al-Mayadeen reported that the military had taken control of Ratyan, while the rebels re-established control of Kafr Naya after a counter-attack from the north. According to ARA News, the rebel Levant Front evacuated its headquarters in Ratyan after more than ten of its fighters were killed and a dozen more were wounded. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the western half of Ratyan had been retaken by rebels that day, and The Independent and The Guardian reported fighting continuing on 7 February. By the evening of 5 February, the army reached positions overlooking Bayanoun, with clashes continuing in the village. Thousands of people in the area fled towards the Turkish border. The next day, government forces captured all of Ratyan, as well as the Bashkoy- Ratyan road, after securing the soap factory. In all, Al-Masdar reported that 140‚Äì160 fighters on both sides were killed in the battle for the village the previous day, including 100 rebels and 60 government fighters. Among the government casualties were General Hafez Ahmed Al-Abood and Hezbollah commander Haydar Fariz. According to Al-Masdar, at least one of the dead rebel fighters was a child soldier, as the rebels were reportedly sending more child fighters to the front line due to a lack of manpower. Ali Yousef Dasho, described by Syrian government media as a \\"Lebanese war reporter\\", was killed while covering the battle for Ratyan from the government side, as was confirmed by Hezbollah to Russian media. Later on 6 February, the YPG and the Army of Revolutionaries captured two villages, a hill and the al-Faisal mill. One village was Al-Alqamiyeh, near the rebel-held Menagh Air Base, while further south YPG-led forces seized the quarry and Talat Al-Firan hill that overlook Tannurah. The town of Menagh was hit by Russian bombers after the SDF reportedly warned the rebels to hand the town over to avoid the strikes. The SDF also reached the southern entrance to the town of Deir Jamal. At the start of 7 February, government troops were seven kilometers from rebel-held Tell Rifaat.Syrian army advances towards Turkish border town They then advanced and captured the village of Kiffin, bringing them to within five kilometers of Tell Rifaat, after which they proceeded to attack Kafr Naya from two different flanks. Concurrently, the SDF seized three villages during the day, including Ajar and its hill, Maraanaz and Deir Jamal. During the SDF's advance on Deir Jamal, a local Mountain Hawks Brigade unit defected to the Army of Revolutionaries and handed over Deir Jamal to the SDF. The SDF also took full control of the road south of Deir Jamal, preventing government forces from advancing on Tell Rifaat via this route. The army and the SDF reportedly set up a joint checkpoint near Kiffin to avoid potential skirmishes. Heavy Russian air-strikes continued against Menagh throughout the following night. =Capture of the Menagh Military Airbase= As of 8 February, a rebel handover of Menagh and its air base to the Kurdish forces had still not taken place due to a dispute between two rebel groups, while south of the base the SDF captured Kafr Antun. Meanwhile, the army began an attack in the direction of Tannurah, south of Nubl and Al-Zahraa, which led to fighting in the hills overlooking the village. The attack was repelled. Nimr Shukri, Ahrar ash- Sham's Aleppo commander, was killed during the day. On 9 February, SDF forces (YPG and Jaysh al-Thuwar) captured Al-Mashtal, northwest of the Menagh air base. Further south, a rebel convoy consisting of 100 vehicles carrying reinforcements and ammunition was seen traveling from Idlib towards Aleppo. Later, a rebel convoy, including more than 20 vehicles, was reportedly destroyed by the Syrian Air Force on the Aleppo-Latakia Highway (M-4 Highway). On 10 February, fighting continued in the Menagh area and at the air base, despite claims the previous night the base and its village were captured by the SDF.ÿ¨Ÿäÿ¥ ÿßŸÑÿ´Ÿàÿßÿ± ÿØÿßÿÆŸÑ ÿ®ŸÑÿØÿ© ŸÖŸÜÿ∫ More clashes took place around Tannurah. That evening, the Menagh military airport and the village of Menagh were captured by the SDF, after the base was hit with at least 30 Russian air strikes. Meanwhile, after a three-day-long battle, Army, NDF and Hezbollah units broke through rebel positions around Kafr Naya and captured the village. =SDF push north, government push south and Turkish shelling= Map of the Kurdish advancements during the offensive Late on 11 February, according to several reports, the SDF reached the western outskirts of Azaz, with clashes taking place at the national hospital and the Al Shat checkpoint, 2 kilometers from the city. However, the SDF denied they had initiated an assault on Azaz. The next morning, government troops took control of Duhrat Al-Qur'ah and Duhrat Al-Qundilah hills, near Tannurah, following their second assault on the area during the week. They then seized the Tannourah Quarries and by the evening the northern part of Tannourah itself. This advance brought the military back to Mount Simeon for the first time after three and a half years. Elsewhere, the SDF advanced near Kafr Antoan and allegedly seized the Al Shat checkpoint, near Azaz. On 13 February, the Army fully secured Tannourah, advancing towards Anadan, while 20‚Äì46 air strikes hit Tell Rifaat. To the north, Turkish artillery shelled SDF forces at the recently captured Menagh air base and a village continuously for three hours, after the SDF came within 500 meters of Azaz. Several Twitter posts reported this was in support of a rebel counter- attack, which was eventually repelled. A Turkish official claimed the shelling was in response to YPG shelling of Turkish border military outposts, while Turkey's Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu demanded that the SDF withdraw from all recently captured territory. The SDF stated they would not retreat and, despite the Turkish shelling, launched a two-pronged attack on Tell Rifaat. They captured the village of Ayn Daqnah, on the road between Tell Rifaat and Azaz, and advanced to the western outskirts of Tell Rifaat. On 14 February, the Turkish military shelled Kurdish forces for a second day, while government troops made attempts to advance from Tannurah to Anadan. During the day, 350 rebel fighters crossed into Syria from Turkey to reinforce Tell Rifaat. They entered via the Atamah military border crossing and with the approval of Turkish authorities after they had earlier crossed into Turkey from Syria's Idlib governorate. Late that evening, SDF forces entered the western and northern neighborhoods of Tell Rifaat and reached the train station where clashes took place, after which they took control of the station, leaving them in control of most of the town (70 percent) by morning. The relative ease with which the SDF broke through into Tell Rifaat was due to no rebel defense lines being built on the western side of the town. The SDF also captured Kafr Kashir, after cutting the road between it and Azaz, leaving those in Azaz in fear of an imminent SDF attack on the town. The SDF also made attempts to advance towards the Kaljibrin area, moving closer to ISIS-controlled territory. On 15 February, government forces withdrew from Kafr Naya, handing over control of the town to the SDF. The SDF also seized Kafr Naseh and fully cleared Tell Rifaat, while south of the town, government troops captured the villages of Misqan and Ahras.Syrian Democratic Forces control Tal Rifaat and Kafr Naseh, the regime forces control Ihres after controlling Masqan At this point, the SDF were 6 kilometers from ISIL territory. The Turkish Prime Minister vowed \\"We will not allow Azaz to fall\\" and warned the SDF not to move east of Afrin or west of the Euphrates (into ISIL territory), as Turkish shelling continued for a third day, including hitting targets in Tell Rifaat. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden called on the Turkish Prime Minister to \\"de- escalate\\" and \\"cease artillery strikes on Kurds\\". The call was received with \\"astonishment\\" by Turkish officials. On 16 February, it was reported rebel forces agreed to withdraw from Mare' (on the frontline with ISIL), thus leaving it to the SDF. However, the rebels rejected this. In addition, there was speculation the Army would hand over Ahras to the SDF so to ease tensions and avoid potential future clashes. Later that day, the SDF captured Sheikh Isa, near Mare'. Meanwhile, Turkey continued artillery strikes against the SDF. Aftermath ‚Äì SDF advance in Aleppo city & SAA northwestern push thumbleftAdvances made in February 2016 During the night between 16 and 17 February, several unconfirmed reports stated the SDF had cut the Castello Road, which was the final rebel supply route into the rebel-held part of Aleppo city. The next morning, it was confirmed that the SDF had launched an attack from the northern SDF-held Sheikh Maqsood district against rebel positions: in the Bani Zaid district (to the west), in the Bustan al-Basha district (to the east), in the Ashrafiyah district (to the south) and at the Castello road (to the north). Meanwhile, the SDF's Army of Revolutionaries reported that its positions in Bustan al- Basha came under attack from the Syrian Army on one side and the Ahrar al- Sham-led Army of Aleppo on the other. During the fighting, the SDF reportedly imposed fire control over the Castillo Roundabout and seized the Hanaan Hospital in Al-Ashrafiyah. The SDF assault on the Castello Road was repelled. Later during the day, a batch of 500 al-Nusra fighters, coming from Idlib, crossed into northern Aleppo from Turkey via Azaz under the supervision of Turkish authorities. On 18 February, the SDF was reported to have captured the Youth Housing Area in Bani Zaid and the Castello Roundabout, potentially cutting the last rebel supply route into the city. However, the rebels recaptured the Youth Housing Area on the following day, or at least part of it. Between 22 and 23 February, the SDF reportedly captured the Saladin Mosque in Bani Zaid, and the Younis al-Saba'wi School and Jama' al-Istaqmat in Al- Ashrafiyah, supported by Russian airstrikes. The SDF also advanced once again, in the Youth Housing Area. On 24 February, it was reported that SDF forces fully recaptured the Youth Housing Area. On 26 February, Syrian government forces launched a new assault, northwest of Aleppo city, and reportedly through Kurdish-held territory, attacking Shaykh Aqil and Qabtan al-Jabal. The Syrian Army managed to capture Shaykh Aqil, but the rebels recaptured it a few hours later. The attempted advance took place hours before the implementation of a country-wide ceasefire. The same day, the Army handed over Ahras to the SDF peacefully. At the end of the month, preparations were reportedly underway for a new offensive to be launched west of Aleppo to cut the last rebel supply line into the city. At the start of March, according to both government and rebel sources, the SDF captured a strategic hill overlooking the Castello Road. The YPG denied this. Iranian and Russian support Iran's General Qasem Soleimani, the commander of the Quds Force, was reported to be present in the area and overseeing operations, whilst the Iranian contingent of the allied forces have reportedly played a crucial role in the victories of the Syrian army and its allies. A total of 14‚Äì24 IRGC advisors died, including Brigadier General Mohsen Ghajarian (), commander of the 21st Imam Reza Armored Brigade of Neyshabur and an Iran‚ÄìIraq War veteran, who was advising the allied troops during the assault when he and another six Iranians were killed.Militants kill Iranian general in Syria: Reports The Russian air support provided to the ground forces during their onslaught in northern Aleppo, was said to be one of the main reasons for the string of successes against the rebels in the offensive. During the offensive, heavy Russian air strikes destroyed all three health facilities in the town. SDF role The Iranian IRGC-affiliated Fars News Agency reported that the Kurdish-led People's Protection Units (YPG) were helping the Syrian Army, as the SDF of Efr√Æn captured the villages of Al-Ziyare and Kharebeh in the Shirava district. Fars' reports claimed that wounded Syrian government forces were sent to the Kurdish region.

In 1798, a Fr James Blundell was saying Mass in a house on Windmill Street. In 1803, a permanent chapel was built on Chapel Street and called St Philip and St James. In the first half of the nineteenth century, the Catholic congregation increased with the influx of workers at Stockport‚Äôs mills. In 1845, a priest would come from the chapel (which in 1905 would be replaced by Our Lady and the Apostles Church in Edgeley) to the centre of Stockport to say Mass in a temporary school in Parson‚Äôs Yard. In 1858, the schools on Tatton Street were built. They were designed by Matthew Ellison Hadfield and George Goldie. =Construction= In 1861, the foundation stone for the church was laid by the Bishop of Salford, William Turner. In 1862, a watercolour was made by M. E. Hadfield showing the west end interior of the church. It now hangs in the west end of the nave. In 1888, an industrial school, linked to the church, was built to the south of the school. It was part-funded by the Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk.

The family lived from the Middle Jurassic to the early Late Cretaceous before going extinct. Species of the family are known from Europe, Asia, and South America. The family has been occasionally described as \\"butterflies of the Jurassic\\" based on their resemblance to modern butterflies in morphology and ecological niche.  Range  The known distribution of Kalligrammatidae is widespread both in time and in location. Fossils of the family have been recovered from sediments in Western Europe, the British Isles, Central Asia, and China. The majority of described species, thirty one, are from Jurassic and Cretaceous fossils found in China. Eight species are known from Kazakhstan, the second largest number of species for a single country, while only two species are represented by fossils found in Russia, though only one is described due to the incomplete nature of the other specimen. One species has been described from Mongolia. Species from Europe are much less common, with four species from Germany and one species from England. Only one genus has been described from the Western Hemisphere, with two species found in Brazil. Six of the genera have been found at two or more locations; Kalligrammula and Kalligramma are the most widely distributed genera. Jurassic species are found in both Asia and Europe. The oldest described species are from the early Toarcian Posidonia Shale in Germany, with the next youngest being from the Callovian Haifanggou and Daohugou Formations in China. Cretaceous species are less common, but still found across Eurasia, the youngest being from China and Britain and the family lasting until the Aptian in Brazil (Crato Formation). In 2018, it was recognised that the subfamily Cretanallachiinae from the Burmese amber, formerly assigned to Dilaridae, belonged to Kalligrammatidae, extending the range of the family into the early Late Cretaceous. Burmogramma liui in Burmese amber from various views  Morphology  Sophogramma lii with disruptive coloration Most species are known from compression-impression fossils preserved in layers of soft sedimentary rock. Many of the species are known only from isolated fore or hind wings, though full bodies are known for some species. Species are typified by bodies that are over long when known and covered in dense layers of setae. The antennae are generally not longer than the length of the fore wings and have a simple filiform structure. There is variation in the mouthparts, which commonly are long siphon shaped proboscis, but some basal species have more distinct mandibles. The proboscis is formed from the same mouth parts as those of Nymphalidae butterflies and were used for probing and sucking. Species of at least one genus, Oregramma, have elongated lance shaped ovipositors. The wings are distinctly large, over long, often with centrally placed eye spots and the ovoid to triangular wings have numerous closely spaced branching veins. Most of the species also have distinctly developed wing scales, a feature seen in Lepidopterans. Two types of scales are seen in the kalligrammatids, shorter scales with a broad base that taper to a tip, and longer narrow scales with a spatulate shape. The species Makarkinia adamsi has the longest wingspan of any neuropteran species, estimated at .  Paleobiology  It is thought that their large body size and large wings would have made kalligrammatids weak fliers. Wing color patterning on many species and the setae covering on Makarkinia are indications that the species were day-time fliers similar to butterflies. The prevalence of eye spots in many species, the presence of light striping along the wing margins of Sophogramma were evolved to act as anti-predator adaptations against predation from pterosaurs and early birds. Given the structuring of the mouthparts, they are thought to have most likely been pollinators, feeding on pollen and plant juices, possibly produced by Bennettitales and Cheirolepidiaceae. The pollination behavior is nearly unique in the Neuroptera, most of which are predatory. The similarity of features and ecology between lepidopterans and kaligrammatids has led to the group occasionally being called \\"butterflies of the Jurassic\\". The only modern neuropteran family that feeds on pollen is Nemopteridae, and kalligrammatids are the only neuropterans which have developed proboscises. As flowering plants emerged and diversified, the host plants of kalligrammatids dwindled, possibly resulting in their extinction.  Taxonomy  Abrigramma calophleba Kalligramma haeckeli There are currently Six described subfamilies of Kalligrammatids, with all but two genera placed into them. The remaining two genera Makarkinia and Palparites have been left incertae sedis. :Kalligrammatinae ::Angarogramma ::Kalligramma ::Kalligrammina ::Limnogramma ::Sinokalligramma :Kallihemerobiinae ::Affinigramma ::Apochrysogramma ::Kalligrammula ::Kallihemerobius ::Lithogramma ::Ophtalmogramma ::Stelligramma :Liassopsychopinae ::Liassopsychops ::Huiyingogramma :Meioneurinae ::Meioneurites :Oregrammatinae ::Abrigramma ::Ithigramma ::Oregramma :Sophogrammatinae ::Protokalligramma ::Sophogramma :Cretanallachiinae ::Cretanallachius ::Burmogramma ::Burmopsychops ::Cretogramma ::Oligopsychopsis :incertae sedis ::Makarkinia ::Palparites = Phylogeny = A phylogeny of the family was produced in 2014 by a team of researchers showing the family to have 4 distinct subfamily clades. A placement of Palparites was not made due to the incomplete nature of the only fossil known, and Makarkninia was not included in the paper, as the second more complete species was not described until 2016.

The dish was described in cookery books of the 17th and 18th centuries. Confusion with words for battle led to the pie being crenellated, or shaped to resemble a castle with towers. Etymology A battalia pie was so named because it was filled with beatilles, small blessed objects (from Latin beatus, blessed) such as, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, \\"Cocks- combs, Goose-gibbets, Ghizzards, Livers, and other Appurtenances of Fowls (1706)\\".Oxford English Dictionary, \\"Battalia pie\\".

Biography As evidenced by his nisba, Ammar hailed from the Arab Banu Kalb tribe, and belonged to an aristocratic family established in Ifriqiya since the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb. The family had evidently embraced the Fatimid regime after the overthrow of the Aghlabids in 909, and his father Ali had served the Fatimids with distinction, being killed by the rebellious populace in Agrigento in 938. Along with his brother Hasan, Ammar belonged to the close circle around Jawdhar, the powerful chamberlain and chief minister of Caliph al-Mansur bi-Nasr Allah. In spring or early summer 956, Caliph al-Mu'izz dispatched him to Sicily at the head of a fleet, to confront the Byzantines. Ammar inflicted a heavy defeat on the Byzantine fleet, and the Fatimids under Ammar's brother Hasan and Jawhar al-Siqilli scored further victories and raided Calabria. The local Byzantine commander, Marianos Argyros, visited the caliphal court and arranged for truce, but it was soon broken and warfare resumed. In spring 957, Ammar crossed from Sicily to Calabria, but the Fatimids themselves suffered heavy losses in a storm. Another effort by Argyros to renew the truce in autumn failed, and in the next year, Ammar and Hasan defeated his forces in Sicily; but soon after, as the Fatimid fleet was returning from Calabria to Sicily, it was again wrecked in a storm off Palermo, in which Ammar perished (on 24 September 958, according to the Cambridge Chronicle; al-Maqrizi places these events two years earlier). As a result, al-Mu'izz accepted new Byzantine proposals for a renewed five-year truce. Ammar's body was recovered among the wreckage, and buried by his brother Hasan in Sicily. Ammar's son Hasan also served against the Byzantines in Sicily and Italy before going to newly conquered Egypt, where he rose to become chief minister under Caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah in 996‚Äì997, before being overthrown and executed by Bajarwan.

One of the most crucial goals of cyberjustice is increasing access to justice through both reducing the costs associated with administering justice as well as reducing the burden on the judges and the court system as a whole. Electronic justice services Several electronic services are available in various court systems worldwide. For example, there are several electronic courtrooms that have integrated information and communications technologies such as video-conferencing, holographic evidence presentation technology or other communications technologies in addition to various systems or applications meant to aid in the conduction of the proceedings as well as the presentation of evidence. Additionally, throughout the entire process there is what is known as an electronic case management system available to the parties, their lawyers and judges, that allow them to keep track of what is taking place in the case through the Internet and permit them to file court documents and proceedings electronically or access information relative to the case. Furthermore, many jurisdictions allow for the discovery of documents to be done electronically through the use of electronic discovery systems. Once a case has been finalized and has become public information, these court records as well as judgements can be made available electronically to members of the public. Online dispute resolution In addition to the use of technology for the purposes of litigation, the term cyberjustice also encompasses the domain of online dispute resolution, whose aim is to aid in the resolution of disputes prior to having to resort to the courts. Several mechanism for this type of electronic dispute resolution are available, namely cyber-negotiation, cyber-mediation and cyber-arbitration. The first can be classified as either assisted, which employs technologies for the purposes of communication, agenda development and adoption of solutions, or automated, where specialized software acts as a negotiator between the parties. For its part, cyber- mediation will often be an alternative where cyber-mediation was unfruitful and it involves a third party‚Äôs intervention to assist the parties in reaching an agreement. Finally, cyber-arbitration is different from the preceding two types of dispute resolution in that it is adjudicatory, and therefore must adhere to specified formal rules, as well as that parties never contact one another but rather communicate via an arbitrator. Cyberjustice initiatives Cyberjustice has been integrated into the legal systems of several jurisdictions worldwide, including the European Union, Australia, the United States of America, and Canada. Several other international initiatives have been made. =The European Union= The European Union, for example has created the e-Justice Portal through which legislation case law and legal information may be accessed. The European Union also offers two other cyberjustice services, namely e-CODEX, which simplifies cross-border litigations by providing access to electronic delivery services, electronic signatures, electronic payments, electronic authentication and electronic documents, and e-CURIA, which is essentially just an e-filing system. Additionally, other countries within the European Union have incorporated certain technologies into their adjudication of justice, such as the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain. The United Kingdom runs Money Claim Online (MCOL), a service that allows a claim to be instituted online against two people at most who owe up to a maximum of ¬£100,000 that they refuse to pay. Italy offers Trial Online, which is essentially both an electronic filing system and a case management system. Spain has passed laws whose aim is to regulate technology used in conjunction with the legal system and has ultimately resulted in the incorporation of technology in the legal system for the purposes of treating data and managing legal files, not the least of which is LexNET which enables the secure transfer of judicial data. =Australia= Australia offers e-filing services, online courtroom and online case management services, and is the first jurisdiction to have used a fully electronic courtroom for the hearing of a high-profile criminal case. =The United States of America= The United States of America has several electronic courtrooms. For example, the McGlothlin Courtroom, located at the William and Mary College of Law, is one of the few to possess technology making it possible to publish court transcripts online in real time, and was the first to use holographic evidence display and immersive technology. =Canada= Several developments have been made in Canada for electronic access to court records and judgments and electronic case management systems, but its only fully electronic courtroom is on the premises of the University of Montreal. Known as the Cyberjustice Laboratory, this courtroom employs some of the most advanced courtroom technologies, such as audio-visual technology allowing for multi- videoconferencing, and the presentation of evidence in different forms, including 3D evidence via a digital retro-projector and the option of live annotation of evidence while it is being presented. One of the particular developments of the Cyberjustice Laboratory is the platform known as PARLe (Platform to Assist in the Resolution of Litigation electronically), which aids in the resolution of low-intensity disputes via the Internet. =International initiatives= Several international cyberjustice initiatives have been made. They include ICANN‚Äôs Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP), which was created to settle disputes regarding trademark infringement in domain names and issues arising out of cybersquatting and typosquatting. The ICANN Electronic Consumer Dispute Resolution (ECODIR) offered a free and voluntary dispute resolution service that began with negotiation and, if not successful, proceeded to mediation and ultimately the recommendation of a solution by the mediator; but this service has been terminated. The United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) was exploring the possibility of developing an online dispute resolution system to take care of cross-border disputes resulting from e-commerce.

It premiered on February 23, 1936, at the Guild Theatre in New York City. Horizons was divided into four parts, two ensemble dances and two solos: Migration: New Trails (ensemble), Dominion: Sanctified Power (solo), Building Motif: Homesteading (solo) and Dance of Rejoycing (ensemble). The ballet was performed by Martha Graham and Group, the predecessor of the Martha Graham Dance Company.  Theme, score and set  The work was based on the theme of exploration and discovery. Program notes explained, the inspiration was \\"not specifically American, but abstracted from the American background.\\" According to the Dance Observer, Horizons was \\"evidently based on the concept of the first migrations from Asia, west to the American continent, settlement and thanksgiving.\\" Graham's receipt of a Guggenheim Fellowship, allowed her to commission composer Louis Horst for the music. However, Horst was unhappy with the score from the beginning. Experimental and innovative, Calder's kinetic set consisted of a collection of swaying and revolving mobiles. The vari-colored disks, balls, spirals and pear-shaped forms were attached to poles set at different heights against white and red backdrops.  Critical reception  More than one reviewer saw the work as a new direction for Graham. The choreography was depicted as \\"oriental, still, contemplative, restrained.\\" The dancing described as possessing a \\"new sentient warmth,\\" especially in Building Motif, which the critic called a softer, gentler version of the solo Frontier. The Springfield Union's reviewer agreed, writing that Horizons marked a milestone in Graham's artistic evolution, as she transitioned from the abstract to work with \\"utilitarian or social content.\\" In general, though, Horizons was not very well received. It was called \\"stylized to the point of obfuscation of content and irksome monotony of movement,\\" \\"too long\\" and \\"unnecessarily repetitious,\\" as well as \\"forced and lacking in spontaneity.\\" Louis Horst quoted one critic as saying, \\"Horizons was a poor dance and a poor music score.\\" Horst himself later added, \\"It was kind of a failure. The harshest criticism was reserved for Calder's set. The New York Telegraph's reviewer ridiculed it as \\"a series of floating balloons, ropes wriggling like sleepy snakes, and something that resembled a huge turnip...turning in the changing light.\\" The New York Times dance critic John Martin described it as \\"representing Miss Graham at her most abstract,\\" adding that the mobiles \\"were greeted by a series of cheers, boos and hisses.\\" The New York Post reporter cheered the audience response and mocked the use of mobiles to \\"enlarge the sense of the horizon...a monstrous corkscrew rotating sullenly in a frustrated attempt to prick a coy blue balloon which turned squeakily against a red background.

This novel continues the story of Rigg and his evolving ability to see and travel to the past, in an attempt to save the future. It is the third and final book of the Pathfinder series, preceded by Ruins and Pathfinder. Visitors was published on November 4, 2014.  Summary  In Visitors, Rigg, Umbo, and Param have determined that humans are the destroyers that bring about the end of their world. As they struggle to determine how to prevent the planet‚Äôs impending doom, they are forced into an impossible moral dilemma: whether it is justified to sacrifice one world for another, especially when one of those worlds is Earth, the Cradle of Humanity. They travel through the history of Garden and each Wallfold, hoping to uncover the reason that the visitors from Earth will send the destroyers and attempting to prevent this outcome without having to destroy Earth preemptively. Their skills and abilities are put to the ultimate test as they try to end the war between worlds before it can begin in this epic and explosive conclusion.  Plot Overview  The novel picks up where the events of Ruins left off: Ram, Rigg, Noxon (Rigg‚Äôs duplicate from the future who has come back to prevent him from killing Ram Odin), and Vadeshex are in the control room discussing what to do about the seemingly inevitable arrival of the visitors from Earth, followed by the destroyers. They decide to send Noxon to Earth to attempt to prevent the destroyers from coming to Garden, while Rigg will stay on Garden to assess the wallfolds and help with the war in Ramfold. = Garden = Rigg explores every wallfold on Garden with Ram, in order to decide whether the walls should come down or each should be preserved without the influence of the others. Rigg eventually decides to do the latter. Umbo escorts Loaf back to Leaky, hoping she will accept him with his facemask. Leaky attempts to take a facemask, but cannot master it, so a message from future Umbo warns them not to try it. When they return, he takes the opportunity to save his younger brother, Kyokay, from falling off a waterfall to his death, but has to do it over until he manages to isolate the effects from changing the events of Pathfinder. In the meantime, Leaky becomes pregnant. Umbo discovers that in a few years, Loaf and Leaky are able to have two children but are killed by Sessamid soldiers. Umbo brings their second child, Square, who was saved and hidden by neighbors, back to the past where he prevents their paths from leading to their demise and prevents Square‚Äôs conception. They all travel back to Vadeshfold to meet with Param, Rigg, Ram, and an expendable to discuss their plans to save the world and overthrow the government of Ramfold. Umbo and Param prepare to wage war on Param and Rigg‚Äôs mother, Queen Hagia Sessamina and General Citizen Haddamander, in Ramfold. Olivenko serves as advisor after spending years studying all material on the starships about war. Loaf is made commander of the army they recruit from various villages in Ramfold, succeeded by Rigg, succeeded by Square. The group creates an enclosed area between wallfolds to house and train the army, and they decide to raid Ramfold villages on progressively older dates to maintain the element of surprise in each raid. After this, they defeat the Sessamid army in one large surprise battle. Queen Hagia requests a meeting for surrender where she plants a trap for Rigg and Param; however they begin slicing time rapidly to escape and go so far that they see the destroyers arrive. A small ship arrives to confront them after the apocalyptic event and Rigg defeats the centipede-like alien that emerges by duplicating himself many times over. Param and Rigg realize they must warn the others that the destroyers are not from Earth and so they bring the jeweled knife back to the ship. = Earth = After working on slicing time backwards with Param, Noxon decides to try attaching to the 20th copy of the starship that was sent to Garden - which is moving backwards in time, towards Earth - bringing a small group of sentient mice with him. After successfully shifting the backwards moving ship into the forward timeflow, he and Ram Odin reach Earth and hide the starship in the past. They visit Ram‚Äôs friend, Professor Wheaton and his adopted daughter, Deborah. They take Wheaton, an anthropologist, back in time to witness Homo Erectus and Neanderthals‚Äôs behaviors in order to sway him to help them save Garden. While in the past, Deborah is killed by a hunter, and the group decides to leave themselves a note warning about the outcome of the day trip and save a version of past- Deborah from the car crash that blinded her, killed her parents, but also put her in Wheaton‚Äôs care. The entire group travels into the past to do this, keeping the current versions of Deborah and Wheaton alive in the main timeline and duplicating them. They visit Wheaton‚Äôs duplicate and while slicing time, experience the world ending in a nuclear event. Ram and Noxon realize that the destroyers were not humans at all, but a sentient species from another planet. They decide to return to the starship and attempt to jump to the aliens‚Äô planet in the past, preventing the evolution of the civilization which wipes out humanity and all life on Earth and Garden. They discover a binary system when they reach the aliens‚Äô planet - one planet with an upright three-legged species, and one with a roach-like many-legged species. They establish wallfolds and colonies on each world before the aliens develop language or any technology, varying combinations of humans, sentient mice, and the two species of aliens in each wallfold. Another copy of Noxon returns to Garden with Deborah, where she tries a facemask to restore her eyes. The heroes manage to prevent the version of the future in which the destroyers come to Earth and to Garden. Each of the characters and duplicates decides to live out the rest of their lives in a wallfold, using their time shaping powers minimally.  Reception  Visitors received mixed reviews, scoring lower in ranking according to Goodreads than the previous two books in the series. The book was criticized by readers as being overly convoluted and being less engaging to the reader as the previous novels.

As a two-year-old in Britain in 1983, he showed great promise, winning two of his three races including the Group One William Hill Futurity. In the spring of the following year he won the Sandown Classic Trial and the Lingfield Derby Trial before finishing fifth when second favourite for the Epsom Derby. After finishing third in the St Leger he was transferred to race in the United States where he won the Hollywood Turf Cup in December. After missing most of the 1985 season with injury he returned in 1986 to post several placed efforts in top class events on both turf and dirt before ending his racing career with a second victory in the Hollywood Turf Cup. He later stood as a breeding stallion in Kentucky and Ireland but was not a conspicuous success as a sire of winners. He died in 2004 at the age of twenty-three. Background Alphabatim was a big, good-looking bay horse hith a small white star bred in Kentucky by the Elmendorf Farm. He was sired by Verbatim, a leading dirt performer in the United States whose wins included the 1969 Whitney Stakes. The best of his progeny included the North American Grade I winners Summing and Princess Rooney, but until the appearance of Alphabatim he was little known in Europe. Alphabatim's dam made no impact as a racehorse, finishing unplaced on her only start but produced several other winners. She was descended from the mare Summer Time, a full-sister to both Bull Lea and the influential broodmare Nectarine (the female-line ancestor of Sir Harry Lewis and Lookin At Lucky). As a yearling, Alphabatim was consigned to the Keeneland sale in September 1982 and bought for $23,000 by representatives of the Saudi prince Khalid Abdullah. The colt was sent to race in Europe and entered training with Guy Harwood at Pulborough in West Sussex. Racing career =1983: two-year-old season= Alphabatim began his racing career in a minor race over one mile at Goodwood Racecourse in September in which he finished third behind his stable companion Gambler's Cup. In early October the colt recorded his first success in the Soltykoff Maiden Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse, winning by four lengths from Longboat and nineteen other juveniles. In late October he was moved up in class for the Group One William Hill Futurity. The field appeared to be sub-standard, with the only previous Group race winner being the French-trained Mendez who started 11/8 favourite after winning the Prix des Ch√™nes and finishing third in the Grand Crit√©rium. Alphabatim, ridden by Greville Starkey, started 9/2 second choice in the betting ahead of Beldale Lear (a winner in Belgium) and the Michael Stoute- trained maiden Falstaff. Alphabatim turned into the straight in fourth place behind the outsiders Lake Valentina, Ilium and Petrizzo before moving up to take the lead from Ilium just inside the last quarter mile. He was immediately challenged by Mendez on the outside but stayed on well in the closing stages to beat the favourite by half a length with Ilium a head away in third. =1984: three-year-old season= Alphabatim began his second season in the Guardian Classic Trial over ten furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse in late April when he was ridden by Brian Rouse and started at odds of 4/1 against seven opponents. Carrying a seven-pound weight penalty as a Group One winner, he raced in second place, took the lead entering the straight and then drew away to win by two and a half lengths from the Feilden Stakes winner Trojan Fen. In May he was moved up in distance to contest the Highland Spring Derby Trial over one and a half miles at Lingfield Park Racecourse and started 2/5 favourite against four opponents. With Rouse again in the saddle he won \\"very easily\\" by six lengths from Get The Message. Lester Piggott took over from Rouse when Alphabatim contested the 205th running of the Epsom Derby in June. He appeared to be the leading British-trained contender and started the 11/2 second favourite behind the Irish colt El Gran Senor in a seventeen-runners field. He stayed on steadily in the straight but never looked likely to challenge the leaders and finished fifth behind Secreto, El Gran Senor, Mighty Flutter and At Talaq. The Harwood stable had been in poor form in midsummer with Alphabatim among many horses to be reportedly suffering from a respiratory infection. The colt did not reappear until mid-August when he was moved up in distance and matched against older horses for the first time in the Geoffrey Freer Stakes over thirteen and a half furlongs at Newbury. He started the odds-on favourite but was beaten three lengths into second place by the Queen's Vase winner Baynoun, with the four-year-old filly Opale (later to win the Irish St Leger) in third place. On his last start in Europe, Alphabatim started at odds of 7/1 in the St Leger over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster in September. After appearing to be struggling five furlongs out he stayed on well in the closing to finish third behind Commanche Run and Baynoun, beaten a neck and one and a half lengths. Plans to run the colt in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe were abandoned and he was sent to the United States for an autumn campaign, with John Gosden taking over as trainer. On his American debut he was equipped with blinkers when he contested the Washington, D.C.International at Laurel Park Racecourse in October. He led the field from the start, and opened up a clear advantage before fading rapidly in the straight and finishing eleventh of the thirteen runners behind Seattle Song. The blinkers were left off when the colt contested the inaugural Breeders' Cup Turf at Hollywood Park Racetrack and finished a close fifth behind Lashkari, All Along, Raami and Strawberry Road. Alphabatim was back at Hollywood Park in December for the Grade I over eleven furlongs in December. After tracking the leaders he took the lead on the final turn and won by one and three quarter lengths from Raami with the Oak Tree Invitational winner Both Ends Burning in third place. =1985: four-year-old season= On his first appearance as a four-year-old, Alphabatim finished third to Dahar in the San Marcos Handicap at Santa Anita Park in January. He missed the rest of the year with an injury to his left forefoot. =1986: five-year-old season= Alphabatim returned after an absence of over a year to win an allowance race at Santa Anita in February 1986 and then finished fourth on dirt in the Grade I Santa Anita Handicap. Four placed efforts followed: he finished third in the San Luis Rey Handicap, third in a handicap at Golden Gate Fields, second in the Bel Air Handicap and second in the Hollywood Gold Cup. He then ran his only poor race of the season when he finished twelfth in the Arlington Million. After a seven-week break he returned to finish fourth in a handicap at Bay Meadows and then finished fifth to Skywalker in the Breeders' Cup Classic. On his final appearance he attempted to repeat his 1984 success in the Hollywood Turf Cup. Ridden by the veteran Bill Shoemaker he produced a strong late run on the wide outside and won by a head from Dahar, with Theatrical in third place. Shoemaker explained his decision to race wide by saying that when he rode Alphabatim in the Hollywood Gold Cup the horse showed that he \\"doesn't like to run on the inside\\". Gosden said \\"He's been a frustrating horse to train because you knew he was a good horse, but those foot problems kept getting in the way. I was getting him ready to run in the Hollywood Invitational (on the dirt last May), because I thought he could handle Flying Pidgeon and some of the others. But then on the morning of a prep race, he bruised the foot and was dead lame\\". Assessment In the official International Classification of European two-year-olds, Alphabatim was rated twelve pounds behind the top-rated El Gran Senor. The independent Timeform organisation gave him a rating, of 123 eight pounds behind El Gran Senor, who was rated the best two-year-old of the year. In 1984 Timeform rated him on 126, ten pounds behind El Gran Senor, whilst the International Classification rated him seventeen pounds behind the Irish colt. Stud record After his retirement from racing, Alphabatim stood as a breeding stallion in Kentucky for his owner's Juddmonte Farm. The best of his American progeny was probably Alphabulous, a filly who won the Grade III Gardenia Handicap in 1994. He was relocated to Ireland in 1993 and died in 2004 whilst based at the Rockmills Stud in County Cork. In Europe sired a few minor winners on the flat but his offspring had more success as a National Hunt stallion, with his best winners including Golden Alpha (Red Rum Handicap Chase) and Mr Nosie (Deloitte Novice Hurdle). He is also the damsire of the World Hurdle winner Cole Harden and the Chester Vase winner Ted Spread. Pedigree *Alphabatim was inbred 4 √ó 5 to Prince John, meaning that this stallion appears in the fourth and fifth generations of his pedigree.

He went to Rome, where he copied the Old Masters. Upon returning to Saint Petersburg, he produced two major historical works: Dmitry Donskoy at the Battle of Kulikovo and Count Ostermann-Tolstoy undergoing surgery at the Battle of Kulm. Later, he painted an iconostasis for the newly rebuilt Transfiguration Cathedral and created decorations for the Tauride Palace. These projects earned him the title of Academician in 1830. For the next twelve years, he received numerous commissions for religious paintings in Saint Petersburg's churches, interrupted by the occasional portrait.

Taxonomy The species was first described by British scientist Benjamin Britton as a subspecies of Hypericum mutilum, but Eugene Bicknell placed it as its own species in 1895 in the 22nd edition of the Bull. Torrey Bot. Club. The species is most closely related to Hypericum mutilum, Hypericum majus, and Hypericum canadense. In addition to being similar in appearance, it is reported that the species hybridizes with at least H. canadense. Description The inflorescence of H. boreale is almost identical to that of Hypericum majus, but they differ in a few key ways. These include having more oblong and blunt sepals, fewer flowered clusters that are more leafy, and more broad and round leaves. The inflorescence consists of single flowers or open clusters of a few to several flowers at the tips of stems and branches, with a pair of leaf-like bracts at the base of a flower stalk. Its flowers are yellow, and less than a quarter inch in diameter. It has with 5 narrow petals with blunt tips, 5 green sepals that have blunt tips, and 3 styles that are united at the base. Closely surrounding the center are 7 to 18 slender stamens. The leaves are simple, placed opposite and are either oblong, oval or elliptic. They are around half an inch long and a quarter of an inch wide. The tips and base are either rounded or taper to a blunt tip and there are 3 to 5 prominent veins. The stems are hairless and either branch on the upper part of the plant or from underground rhizomes. The fruit is an oval to ellipsoid capsule around an eighth of an inch long, and is a reddish to deep purple color. Distribution The species is found in the continental United States and parts of Canada. Specifically, its distribution is in the Pacific Northwest, the Midwest and Great Lakes regions, along the Eastern Seaboard, and in Eastern Canada. It shares a similar, but more limited, range to the related species H. majus. Habitat The species is almost always found in wetlands. Specifically, it is often found on pond edges, stream banks, marshes, and bogs. It grows well in coarse and moderate, but not fine, soils. It is cold tolerant, but requires at least 90 frost-free days and cannot survive below -33¬∞ F for sustained periods of time. It is not tolerant of salt in the soil, and requires a pH between 4.4 and 6.0 in order to survive. Conservation While H. boreale is considered to be secure globally and nationally in the United States and Canada, it is still somewhat threatened because of fragmentation and habitat loss due to the disruption of wetlands.

Rouss (3 December 1921 ‚Äì 8 May 1988) was an American citizen born on Saint Croix in the US Virgin Islands. Her career was marked by a series of firsts. She was the first Virgin Islander in the Women's Army Corps (WAC), first African-American woman to serve on General Eisenhower‚Äôs staff, and first black woman assigned as a permanent staff of Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe. After a 20-year military career, she retired from service and became the first woman parole officer in St. Croix. In 1973, she was elected as one of the first women to serve in the Virgin Island's legislature. In 1981, Rouss served as the first female President of the Virgin Islands Legislature, becoming the first black woman to lead a legislature in the United States. She was elected to serve a second presidency of the Senate in 1987 and died the following year. Posthumously, she was inducted into the Virgin Island's Women's Hall of Fame and a housing project in St. Croix was renamed in her honor. Biography Ruby Margaret Rouss was born on 3 December 1921 in Christiansted on Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands to William and Emmeline Rouse. Her father was a wharf porter, originally from St. Croix and her mother, Emmeline (Grant n√©e Clifton) was from St. Kitts. Rouse attended elementary school and began high school in Christiansted, but when she was fifteen, moved to the United States. She lived with her brother Stephen Grant in Manhattan and completed her secondary schooling at Washington Irving High School, in New York City. She later earned an associate degree while in the U.S. Army. =Military career= After completing high school in New York, on 23 January 1943, Rouss joined the Women's Army Corps (WAC), as its first Virgin Islander. She became a member of the drill team at Fort Dix, New Jersey, and was assigned as the first black woman to General Eisenhower‚Äôs staff during World War II. When the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) was organized in 1951, Rouss was the first black woman permanently assigned to it. In 1953, she married a civilian and continued her service until 1 May 1963, when she was honorably discharged and returned to the Virgin Islands. She was hired by the Harvey Aluminum Plant, the firm's first woman employee, to head the office staff. In 1965, became the first woman parole and probation officer of St. Croix. By 1966, Rouss was divorced and took in a niece to provide for her care. Later that same year, she took in three foster children from the Queen Louise Home for Children. =Politics= Rouss became involved in politics almost immediately after returning to St. Croix, participating as a delegate in the 1964 first Constitutional Convention. In 1968, Rouss was the Virgin Island's delegate to the Democratic Convention held in Chicago and served as one of the five black women on the Rules Committee. Then in 1970, she made her first bid for elected office in the Virgin Islands, running unsuccessfully for a seat in the Senate. In the 1972 election, Rouss finally succeeded in winning a Senate seat in the 10th legislature, becoming one of the first woman Legislators in the Virgin Islands. She served as chair of the Committee on Health and Welfare and by January 1973 was involved in an investigation of the Insular Training School. That same year, in May, Rouss submitted a report of recommendations to improve services for the children housed there. Two years later, she ran for lieutenant governor, but lost the election. Rouss resigned from her post as probation officer in 1975 after serving for a decade. In 1976 Rouss ran for reelection as Senator, but came in 6th in the race. Two years later, she won again and then went on to serve in 13th, 14th, 16th and 17th legislatures. She opened her term in the 13th legislature by sponsoring a bill to provide financial assistance for tuition or services to parents or guardians of special needs children, if there were no help facilities on their home island. During the same term, she served as chair of the Committee on Health, chair of the Subcommittee on Corrections and chair of the Subcommittee on Water and Power Authorities. In these capacities, she worked to secure the jobs of mental health workers, investigate unsafe prison conditions, and provide public services for poverty stricken constituents. In the 14th legislature, she was elected as the president of the Senate (1981‚Äì1982), becoming the first woman to preside over a legislature in the Virgin Islands and the \\"first black woman to head a Legislature in the United States\\". In 1982, she drove a bill to create the Virgin Islands Bureau of Audit Control in an effort to gain better oversight of the financial management of the island and the secure the autonomy of the Audit Bureau. That same year, Rouss ran unsuccessfully for governor, but was reelected to the Senate in 1985 and as Senate president in 1987. Rouss died on 8 May 1988 of complications from diabetes in St. Croix Hospital, Christiansted, St. Croix and was buried in the Kingshill Cemetery in Christiansted. Immediately following her death, she received accolades for her years of service from both the Legislature of the Virgin Islands and the United States Congress. Posthumously, she was inducted into the Virgin Islands Women's Hall of Fame in 2005. In a ceremony held on 17 June 2008, the Watergut Housing Complex on St. Croix was renamed the Ruby M. Rouss Housing Complex, in her honor.

Comments on Barbieri's work pp. 58-62 In 1965, he was employed by the Medical Faculty of the same University as a researcher in molecular biology and teacher of biophysics for medical students. He conducted research at the Medical Research Council in Cambridge, the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, and the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics in Berlin. Since 1992 he is professor of embryology at the Medical Faculty of Ferrara University. In 1997, he founded the Italian Association for Theoretical Biology (Associazione Italiana di Biologia Teorica) and in 2012 he founded the International Society of Code Biology. Research At the Max-Planck-Institut in Berlin, Barbieri obtained the largest microcrystals of eukaryotic ribosomes that have ever appeared in the scientific literature. At the Medical Research Council in Cambridge, and at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, he developed mathematical models for the reconstruction of structures from incomplete information and has shown that a convergent increase in complexity is possible if the reconstructions are performed with iterative methods that make use of memories and codes . He has proposed that the existence of organic codes is revealed by the presence of adaptors and has shown that such codes exist in signal transduction, in the cytoskeleton and in cell compartments. This adaptor-dependent definition of code has been used by K√ºhn and Hofmeyr to show that the histone code is a true organic code, whereas G√©rard Battail has argued that ‚ÄúBarbieri‚Äôs organic codes enable error correction of genomes‚Äù. He has been described as one of ‚Äòkey figures‚Äô in biosemiotics by Donald Favareau in Essential Readings, by Liz Else in New Scientist and by Nigel Williams in Current Biology . Theoretical work Barbieri underlined that copying and coding are two fundamentally different mechanisms of molecular change and suggested that there are two distinct mechanisms of evolutionary change: evolution by natural selection, based on copying, and evolution by natural conventions, based on coding. This in turn implies that many organic codes appeared in the history of life after the genetic code, and Barbieri proposed that the greatest novelties of macroevolution were associated with the origin of new codes. These ideas have been developed in the course of a thirty-year period in the books: The Semantic Theory of Evolution (1985), The Organic Codes (2003) and Code Biology (2015).

History HBN Law was founded in 1938 when S.W. van der Meer established Law office Van der Meer in Cura√ßao, then in the Netherlands Antilles. At the end of the forties begin fifties of the 20th century, Van der Meer associated with Mr. Ronchi Isa. The firm changed names over the years and became Halley & Blaauw in 1991, named after its partners Lucius Halley and Rob Blaauw. In 1993 Rob Blaauw moved the firm‚Äôs office from Pietermaai to the newly restored historic Villa Belv√©d√®re in Otrobanda. Back then all law firms were concentrated around Pietermaai and Punda. Otrobanda was considered a poor area with no business opportunities. The firm however rapidly expanded and became leading on all Dutch Caribbean islands ever since. Nelson Navarro joined the firm‚Äôs partnership in 1997 and the firm renamed into Halley Blaauw & Navarro. In 2005 the firm changed its name into HBN Law.

It was the company's first diesel engine originally designed to power road locomotives, with a higher output and operating speed than previous designs. The introduction of EMC's FT freight diesel in 1939 made Alco management realize that they needed a new diesel engine in order to compete for diesel locomotive sales. The engine that Alco needed must be capable of producing in the range of 1500 horsepower for a freight locomotive and 2000 horsepower for a passenger locomotive. The diesel engine that it did have in 1940, the Alco 539T, would produce approximately 1300 horsepower in an eight- cylinder engine. The 539 engine did not have capacity to produce much more than 1300 horsepower. It was not a good candidate for long term locomotive production with capability for greater horsepower.Steinbrenner, page 179-180\\" Design work on the 241, began in 1940, initially led by Ralph Miller, who was shortly thereafter replaced by Paul Vaughan. Alco Engineer Paul Vaughan did a study to recommend a diesel engine specification. His recommendation was for a high speed, 9\\" X 10.5\\" V-type diesel engine operating at a maximum of 1,000 rpm with a 45 degree angle between the two cylinder banks. Alco's first attempt at attaining 1500 horsepower in a diesel engine was with the Alco 241 engine program. The 241 engine was approved for development on March 12, 1940. The company authorized both 12 cylinder and 16 cylinder designs. The Alco 241 engine would have a bore (cylinder diameter) of , and a stroke of . Its designation combines Alco's identifier for that bore and stroke - 2 - with the year its design was approved for laboratory testing - 1941. Alco was focused on creating a diesel engine capable of competing with the EMD FT. The Alco's design goals for the 241 engine were a high operating speed, a high cylinder output of 135 psi bmep (brake mean effective pressure), a high horsepower to weight ratio, and the capability for growth with later improvements. World War 2 had started and the wartime environment caused all of Alco's businesses to grow. The diesel engine engineering and testing staff had been limited by the previous economic conditions of the Great Depression. Prior to the outbreak of the war the Gulf Mobile & Ohio Railroad ordered 80 diesel freight locomotives from Alco when and if there was a successful design. The additional burden of the war created more work for the Alco diesel engineering staff. This engineering work was mostly to expand production of diesel engines for the U. S. Navy. Effective April 4, 1942 the War Production Board began controlling all industrial production. The Transportation Equipment Branch and the Railroad Advisory Committee both of the War Production Board met on April 8, 1942 to develop a railroad equipment production program for the remainder of the year. This group recommended that diesel locomotive builders build for maximum production. Alco and Baldwin would build diesel switchers and EMD would build freight diesels.Steinbrenner, page 193\\" Faced with these considerable difficulties the Alco diesel engineering staff continued the 241 engine project, but at a very slow pace. With work delayed by the onset of World War II, the first test engine, a small two-cylinder model, was not tested until late 1943, with larger 12 and 16 cylinder versions under construction at the time. During the design process, engineers concluded that the company's existing turbocharger of choice, a Buchi product, did not have the capacity to allow the engine to reach the desired horsepower output. As a result, in mid-1943, work began with General Electric to incorporate that company's aircraft turbocharger design in the 241 engine.Stenbrenner, page 221\\" The first tests of a 241 engine with the GE turbo were conducted on the 12-cylinder test engine in March, 1944.Steinbrenner, page 222 On November 10, 1943 at the locomotive builders meeting with the War Production Board Alco again requested to build road diesels. On December 10, 1943 Alco received approval to build one experimental three unit road freight locomotive in the fourth quarter of 1944.Steinbrenner, page 200\\" A 12-cylinder 241 engine is put on test at Auburn, New York on March 29, 1944. Testing of 241 engines in 1944 revealed several shortcomings, including failures of the connecting rods and their bearings, and the GE turbocharger's inability to supply sufficient air to the engine as the engine's speed was increased. As a result, work began that year to design a new engine based on the 241; this design was named the 244. Later that year, ALCO management decided to abandon their previous plan to use the 241 in production locomotives, instead choosing to use the new 244 design as soon as possible.Steinbrenner, page 226\\" Three 12-cylinder 241 engines were placed in demonstrator road locomotives in 1945, which late in the year underwent testing on the Delaware and Hudson Railroad.Steinbrenner, page 228 During these tests, the aluminum pistons proved to have weakness not found in laboratory testing, while one of the GE turbochargers failed. After installation of redesigned pistons and other modifications in 1945, the locomotives returned to road testing on August 15, 1946 on the New Haven Railroad before moving to the Bangor and Aroostook Railroad in October. These tests were abruptly halted in November after several mechanical problems, including a crankshaft failure in one of the engines. The locomotives subsequently returned to ALCO property, where the engines underwent teardown and inspection, while the carbodies were scrapped. By this time, the 241's successor, the 244, had entered production, and no further work was conducted on the 241 design.Steinbrenner, page 229 References =Footnotes= =Bibliography= Cuisinier, W. A.

He is most-known for composing songs with lyricist L. Wolfe Gilbert. Their most popular songs include, \\"My Sweet Adair\\" (1915), \\"Are You From Heaven?\\" (1917), and \\"My Own Iona\\" (1916). Personal life Friedland was born on March 21, in St. Petersburg, Russia. Some sources claim his year of birth is 1881, while others list it as 1888. He used March 21, 1884 on his June 21, 1922 passport application. Friedland's early education came from private schools in St. Petersburg. He then studied music at the Moscow Conservatory before emigrating to the United States sometime after 1900. He attended the Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation at Columbia University in New York City, where he studied architecture. While a student at Columbia, Friedland composed music for several varsity shows. In 1936, Friedland had one of his legs amputated. Shortly after that, he retired and resided at The Ritz- Carlton Hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Friedland died on July 24, 1938. His daughter, Gloria Greer, was eight years old at the time of his death. She would go on to become a reporter, editor, and talk show hostess. His widow was Rollie Friedland, later known as Rollie Landers. She founded Sand-to-Sea magazine. Career You're So Cute, Soldier Boy cover; Music by Friedland After graduating, Friedland worked as an architect by day and composed music at night. As an architect, he earned $16 per week. He soon drifted more towards vaudevilles. In 1911, Friedland and lyricist Malvin Franklin wrote the score for the Broadway musical, The Wife Hunters. The musical starred Emma Carus and Lew Fields. Due to its success, Friedland was hired by the Shubert family to compose music for their Winter Garden productions, including The Passing Show. In 1912, he wrote the music for the Shubert hit, Broadway to Paris, which featured Gertrude Hoffmann, Louise Dresser, and Ir√®ne Bordoni. He also collaborated with Lee Shubert on musicals. His song, \\"My Little Persian Rose,\\" released in 1912, put him on the market. Friedland met L. Wolfe Gilbert, a fellow Russian, in 1913. The two would go on to write many successful songs together, including a handful of World War I songs. Sometimes they would perform the songs on stage together. Other times Friedland would perform the songs alone, playing the piano and singing. They set up miniature revues which featured their songs. In the early 1930s, Friedland produced \\"tabloid\\" versions of Broadway musicals. These toured motion picture houses that showed one film feature and one live vaudeville. At the beginning of their careers, Barbara Stanwyck and Mae Clarke appeared in these vaudevilles. Friedland and Gilbert's first song issued by their own publishing firm was, Are You From Heaven?. The Gilbert & Friedland Publishing Company operated for a few successful years. Its business would decline after a five-and-ten-cent store ordered five million copies of one song (Afghanistan), but reversed the deal after the song failed to catch on. In November 1919, Friedland returned to the publishing staff of Stern & Company, and was considered \\"one of the foremost writers of that organization.\\" Besides Gilbert, Friedland also collaborated with Harold R. Atteridge, and Edgar Allan Woolf. He also gave Phil Regan his start as a singer. For most of his career, he worked as a vaudeville performer and was a headliner in musical productions. For two decades, Friedland appeared in or produced \\"lavish revues.\\" One of these revues titled, Musicland (1919), starred Friedland and \\"a bevy of beautiful girls.\\" At the time it was considered the most costly production in theatrical history, and included bizarre costumes, scenic effects, and thoughtful lyrics. These elaborate productions earned him the nickname, the \\"Ziegfeld of Vaudeville.\\" Friedland headlined on the B. F. Keith Circuit in Anatol's Affairs of 1924. During prohibition, Friedland opened and operated a speakeasy known as Club Anatole. Friedland performed many of his songs at this club, which was located on West 44th Street, between Sixth and Seventh Avenues in New York. Stanwyck, Clarke, and Dorothy Sheppard were hired to perform at the club. Friedland became protective of the three women and gave them advice on how to navigate Broadway and Tin Pan Alley. In 1923, Friedland joined the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. Selected works While You're away Cover; Gilbert & Friedland WWI song Lyrics by L.

It has a lake containing brackish water, salt marshes and a swamp with reeds. Geography The Qattara Depression is about below sea level and is shaped like a teardrop, with Moghra Oasis in its northeastern corner. The floor of the Depression consists of salt marshes and dry lake beds that flood occasionally and there are also large areas of windblown sand. Moghra Oasis consists of a lake containing brackish water some below sea level. Adjoining it are salt marshes and some Phragmites swamps. To the south and west there are sand dunes near the lake and extensive sheets of sand beyond. Geology The water rises to the surface from an aquifer in the Nubian sandstone, but its precise source is unclear as the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System is at great depths in this area. Just to the north of the oasis is a cliff which gives its name to the Moghra Formation, a thick layer of clastic sedimentary rocks with some minor carbonate interbeds. This formation contains fossils of vertebrates and plants; large mammals found here include Megistotherium, hyaenodonts and Hyaenaelurus. These fluvial deposits are likely to have come from a river system which opened into the Nile Delta at the Moghra Oasis. Ecology To the south of the lake, the saltmarsh gradually merges into saline flats largely devoid of vegetation. There are three main species in this plant community, each dominating its own concentric zone; Zygophyllum album, Nitraria retusa and Tamarix nilotica. The most important variables affecting the distribution and structure of the communities are the moisture content of the soil and the salinity. In the outer zone, where the salinity is low and the surface is friable, small scattered plants of Zygophyllum album occur. In the innermost part of this zone the plants are larger and more crowded and they sometimes form hummocks. Here they are associated with T. nilotica, Alhagi maurorum and N. retusa. The next zone is dominated by N. retusa which shows a wide range of tolerances to moisture and salinity conditions. Among sand dunes it forms hummocks and plays an important role in stabilising dunes. In the outer fringes of the zone it is associated with Z. album and T. nilotica while on the inner fringes, where the water table is high but the soil has a low salinity level, the community includes Phragmites australis, Juncus rigidus, Sporobolus spicatus and Z. album. The T. nilotica dominated area forms a scrub community on the outer fringes of the dune zone surrounding the salt flats, where it is associated with A. maurorum, Cressa cretica, N. retusa and Z album. There are a few abandoned groves of date palms in the sandy areas.

The Hildt villa on the school premises Founded as K√∂nigliche Weinbauschule (Royal School of Viticulture Institute) in 1868, it is the oldest German wine and fruit growing school. The founder was Immanuel Dornfeld. It was given its name on 4 November 1952. In 1901 LVWO established a laboratory for wine and fruit growing that in 1924 joined the educational institution. The institution manages diverse fruits and vineyard goods. Vine breeding began in 1907 at the W√ºrttemberg Institute for Grapevine Breeding and Grafting in Offenau (from 1926 with an office in Lauffen am Neckar). The Grapevine Breeding Institute was connected in 1947 to LVWO. August Herold produced several grape varieties, including Helfensteiner, Heroldrebe (named after him), Dornfelder (named for the school's founder) and Kerner. The Istituto Agrario di San Michele all‚ÄôAdige in San Michele all'Adige, Italy is a partner of LVWO. The wines and sparkling wines produced by the wine school are, since 1995, marketed under the name Staatsweingut Weinsberg. On 1 January 2005 the LVWO was converted into a state company. Since 2008, eight months' training and auditing for wine experience guides will take place here. Since 1971 the state winery is a member of the Association of German Pr√§dikat Wine Estates. The approximately of vineyards are planted 20% with Riesling, 14% with Lemberger and Pinot varieties, 9% with Trollinger and 43% with other varieties. The principal vineyards are at Wildeck Castle in Abstatt, Himmelreich in Gundelsheim and Schemelsberg. Around 250,000 bottles are filled annually. References Literature *Festschrift 1868‚Äì1968.

In his 2003 Nobel lecture, Vitaly Ginzburg cited the gamma-ray laser as one of the thirty most important problems in physics. The effort to construct a practical gamma-ray laser is interdisciplinary, encompassing quantum mechanics, nuclear and optical spectroscopy, chemistry, solid-state physics, and metallurgy‚Äîas well as the generation, moderation, and interaction of neutrons‚Äîand involves specialized knowledge and research in all these fields. The subject involves both basic science and engineering technology.  Research  The problem of obtaining a sufficient concentration of resonant excited (isomeric) nuclear states for collective stimulated emission to occur turns on the broadening of the gamma-ray spectral line. Of the two forms of broadening, homogeneous broadening is simply the result of the lifetime of the isomeric state: the shorter the lifetime, the more broadened the line. Inhomogeneous broadening comprises all mechanisms by which the homogeneously broadened line is spread over the spectrum. The most familiar inhomogeneous broadening is Doppler recoil broadening from thermal motion of molecules in the solid containing the excited isomer and recoil from gamma-ray emission, in which the emission spectrum is both shifted and broadened. Isomers in solids can emit a sharp component superimposed on the Doppler-broadened background; this is called the M√∂ssbauer effect. This recoilless radiation exhibits a sharp line on top of the Doppler-broadened background that is only slightly shifted from the center of the background. With the inhomogeneous background removed, and a sharp line, it would seem that we have the conditions for gain. But other difficulties that would degrade gain are unexcited states that would resonantly absorb the radiation, opaque impurities, and loss in propagation through the crystal in which the active nuclei are embedded. Much of the latter can be overcome by clever matrix crystal alignment to exploit the transparency provided by the Borrmann effect. Another difficulty, the graser dilemma, is that properties that should enable gain and those that would permit sufficient nuclear inversion density seem incompatible. The time required to activate, separate, concentrate, and crystallize an appreciable number of excited nuclei by conventional radiochemistry is at least a few seconds. To ensure the inversion persists, the lifetime of the excited state must be considerably longer. Furthermore, the heating that would result from neutron-pumping the inversion in situ seems incompatible with maintaining the M√∂ssbauer effect, although there are still avenues to explore. Heating may be reduced by two-stage neutron-gamma pumping, in which neutron capture occurs in a parent-doped converter, where it generates M√∂ssbauer radiation that is then absorbed by ground-state nuclei in the graser. Two-stage pumping of multiple levels offers multiple advantages. Another approach is to use nuclear transitions driven by collective electron oscillations. The scheme would employ a triad of isomeric states: a long-lived storage state, in addition to an upper and lower lasing state. The storage state would be energetically close to the short-lived upper lasing state but separated by a forbidden transition involving one quantum unit of spin angular momentum. The graser would be enabled by a very intense optical laser to slosh the electron cloud back and forth and saturate the forbidden transition in the near field of the cloud. The population of the storage state would then be quickly equalized with the upper lasing state whose transition to the lower lasing state would be both spontaneous and stimulated by resonant gamma radiation. A \\"complete\\" chart of nuclides likely contains a very large number of isomeric states, and the existence of such a triad seems likely, but it has yet to be found. Nonlinearities can result in both spatial and temporal harmonics in the near field at the nucleus, opening the range of possibilities for rapid transfer from the storage state to the upper lasing state using other kinds of triads involving transition energies at multiples of the optical laser quantum energy and at higher multipolarities.

The book was awarded the 1996 Prix de Flore. Reception John Montague reviewed the book for The Times Literary Supplement in 2011: > Baudelaire is Houellebecq's dark master in the lyrics and prose poems of The > Art of Struggle; he pays an obvious homage in \\"Fin de Soir√©e\\", which, with > its descriptions of a desolate night (\\"Suspended without any foothold in the > world, night might seem long to you\\"), evokes Baudelaire's \\"Le Cr√©puscule du > soir\\" (\\"Voici le soir charmant, ami du criminel . . .\\"). ...

The technology has been certified as a Qualified Anti- Terrorism Technology by the Department of Homeland Security‚Äôs Science and Technology Directorate. This technology is increasingly used at airports and sports stadiums, because of the various patents that the company received. Alclear also collaborates with various airline companies and sports teams.  Origin and founders  Steven Brill was the owner of Verified Identity Pass, who was running CLEAR at the time. After stepping away from the company in 2008 Steven Brill gave an announcement to the customers regarding CLEAR and their future ‚ÄúI am deeply saddened for Clear‚Äôs dedicated staff and loyal customers that the company has ceased operations‚Äù. The email was sent out to all employees and customers of CLEAR. Caryn Seidman-Becker took over Clear in 2010 with her partner and co-founder Ken Cornick. Caryn Seidman-Becker ultimately overlooks everything that is being done in the company such as the overall approach the company takes, marketing, and business development. Clear operates out of its headquarters in Manhattan, New York. Clear began to work under the larger company of Alclear. Caryn Seidman-Becker and Ken Cornick saw Clear as a promising business to pursue based on the fact that they believed the market for surveillance and security would rise due to the catastrophic events that happened on 9/11.  Biometrics  Fingerprints and iris/face scans are examples of biometric data collection. Biometric identification is conducted through the evaluation of a person‚Äôs physical and behavioral characteristics. There are three different ways, in which someone can authenticate themselves, including possession (ids, keys), secret knowledge(passwords/pins), and appearance (face, fingerprints). The two main authentication methods are verification, where a person confirms him/herself through distinctive characteristics, and identification, where a person is compared to other people to determine if any characteristics match them. Alclear uses biometric identification as a means to shorten long lines-whether it be at airports or sports games. The process to register lasts a couple minutes and the only requirements are to be over the age of 18 and a U.S. citizen/legal resident. You can register for the price of $179 per year. Once registered, Alclear obtains your fingerprints and scans your irises and face to create a distinctive biometric identity. When you show up at one of the valid Alclear locations, you present a government- issued idea (driver‚Äôs license, passport, etc.) for authentication. In a matter of seconds, you are authenticated and are able to skip the long lines entirely. Clear uses an identification process to confirm who their customers are. They scan the iris of an individual as well as taking fingerprint biometrics. They then match it with the card the user is given to confirm this is their identity. They use identity systems and identification databases in order to keep track of their customers, their identities, and their biometrics. Their Patent US10521652B1 allows the company to use their customers identification through their biometrics and their identification card. This technology allows AlClear to identify their customers either through their identification card or their biometrics, then enroll their customers in an identity system. When Clear went under AlClear bought them out along with any technology the company had; this included kiosks that were stationed in airports. These kiosks determine the identity of a customer before they walk up to the AlClear using biometrics and their digital representation. This allows AlClear to act accordingly to what their identification profile says. Biometric Ticketing allows a person's biometrics to be tied in with their tickets and any other boarding passes. Searching for a person's digital representation not only brings up their ticketing information but also their identity. = Patents = The company Alclear has received patents for ‚Äúphysical token- less security screening using biometrics‚Äù, which allows a person to be identified using their individual and distinctive biometric identity that the company creates. The company has been successful in filing and receiving several patents throughout the years. On February 4, 2020, the company was granted the ability to ticket people through their biometric identities. Prior to this patent, the company was also granted two patents on January 14, 2020 to conduct pre-identification before an individual approached the stationed Alclear device and to use individual biometric identities to expedite interactions with people in the close vicinity. To simplify and expedite the process even further, on December 31, 2019, the company was granted a patent to use mobile devices in enrolling into the system. Alclear has partnerships with the European company Oberthur Technologies. Oberthur provides AlClear with identification cards encoded with information that is beyond a normal ID card. They follow the federal standards for Personal Identity Verification(PIV).  Places and Locations  Clear has locations throughout the United States, some major cities they are located in are Los Angeles, New York, Miami, and Houston. They have over 50 locations that vary from airports to sporting event venues. = Airport Registered Traveler Program = Alclear purchased CLEAR out of bankruptcy in 2010 for $5.87 million, relaunching the service that had previously closed in 2009. Upon relaunching, CLEAR opened lanes in Denver International Airport and Orlando International Airport. In the time since the relaunch in 2010, CLEAR has expanded to the following 30 airports in the United States:https://www.clearme.com/where-is-clear#where-is- clear * ATL - Hartsfield‚ÄìJackson Atlanta International Airport * AUS - Austin‚ÄìBergstrom International Airport * BOS - Logan International Airport * BWI - Baltimore‚ÄìWashington International Airport * CLE - Cleveland Hopkins International Airport * CVG - Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport * DAL - Dallas Love Field * DCA - Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport * DEN - Denver International Airport * DFW - Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport * DTW - Detroit Metropolitan Airport * FLL - Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport * HOU - William P.

In Seattle, Clear is also used at sporting venues to identify an individual's identity for alcohol purchases, eliminating the need to check identification for verification that the buyer is 21+. * AT&T; Park - San Francisco * American Airlines Arena - Miami * Avaya Stadium - San Jose * Banc of California Stadium - Los Angeles * CenturyLink Field - Seattle * Citi Field - New York * Comerica Park - Detroit * Coors Field - Denver * Marlins Park - Miami * Oakland‚ÄìAlameda County Coliseum - Oakland * Safeco Field - Seattle * SunTrust Park - Atlanta * Yankee Stadium - New York = Biometric Boarding Pass = In 2015, CLEAR collaborated with Alaska Airlines to launch a biometric boarding pass program. = Car Rental = In December 2018, Hertz began rolling out dedicated lanes at American airports with Clear, allowing Clear members to bypass Hertz employees when exiting their lots with a vehicle rental.  Anti-Terrorism  In June of 2012, CLEAR received certification under the SAFETY Act by the United States Department of Homeland Security. Now, CLEAR is officially certified as an ‚Äúanti-terrorism technology‚Äù under the SAFETY Act (Support Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act of 2002). CLEAR, under Alclear, uses stadiums and airports to deploy these anti- terrorist procedures. Because of the increasing amount of security in these areas, CLEAR offers ‚Äúthe equivalent of express security lanes‚Äù. Since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and Boston Marathon bombings in 2013, the Department of Homeland Security has continuously shown encouragement for stricter security measures. CLEAR continues to shorten long lines, which is important to anti-terrorist strategies, as shorter lines are less prone to terrorist attacks. However, under the desire for more security and creating environments that are least likely for terrorist attacks, several companies have made additional profits from customers. In 2014, the San Francisco Giants were the first to use CLEAR, where they collected biometric data to formulate predictions about customers, including (but not limited to) their purchasing habits, arrival times to games, and relative popularity of games. Despite selling data collection for its growth strategies, CLEAR claims to make safety and efficiency its top priority for its customers.  Revenue  The opposition program against CLEAR, TSA PreCheck The company, CLEAR, operates under Alclear, in which members pay $179 per year for membership. This cost of membership allows them to skip past long lines, whether they be at stadiums/arenas, airports, or concerts. By expanding and diversifying their locations, CLEAR also receives additional revenue from teams, who pay licensing fees. CLEAR‚Äôs competing company, TSA‚Äôs PreCheck program only charges its customers $85 for a five-year membership; however, after receiving certification under the SAFETY Act, the company continues to strive even by charging more.  Marketing and Collaborations  Clear is working on a partnership with the airline company Delta, that allows its customers to cut the security line, have their bags checked in by Delta employees, and have access to the Sky Club Lounge. The Sky Club Lounge is a lounge where frequent Delta customers can socialize prior to their flight. Delta Airlines partners with Clear. Clear is also working with specific sports teams that allow their customers to purchase items from the concessions stands including alcoholic beverages through their fingerprints. This program is being used by sports teams of Seattle which include the Seahawks (NFL Team), Sounders (MLS Team), and the Mariners (MLB). Clear has also partnered with Lyft which grants people a 3-month free trial to test out Clear and gives them a $20 voucher for Lyft customers to use towards a trip to any airport.  Controversies  Clear has the fear of security breach worrying customers and companies alike, considering its database is filled with thousands of their customers' biometrics. In 2008 before being bought out a laptop was stolen from the company with unencrypted information from 33,000 customers.  Reception  Despite the promised expedition through airport crowds and the special status that one believes to have under AlClear, in reality many travelers and subscribers don‚Äôt feel like they're getting much out of their subscription. After confirming a person's identity with Alclear with a person's ‚Äúbiometrically encoded card‚Äù, the person still has to go through TSA and go through their security efforts. Critics of AlClear call out how easy it is for these ‚Äúsecurity companies‚Äù to take a user's biometrics, without much knowledge as to where and who their information is going to. Users put their faith in companies like AlClear to handle their personal information to themselves and use it only for the purposes of the business model. India Mckineey, Deputy Director of Federal Affairs at the Electronic Frontier Foundation argues that the data Clear is not 100% safe, there will always be the fear and threat of a hacking. She wonders if giving your biometrics up for the ability to cut the line at the airport or a stadium is worth it. = Public Opposition = On the federal level, there are no restrictions on biometric data collection. However, several states, such as Illinois, Texas, Washington, and California, have shown their opposition to data collection and the admission of this data to others. In 2008, Illinois banned the admission and auctioning of data, with the exception of subpoenas or consent. The company has acknowledged the conversations around data collection and disclosure, in which it agrees that biometric data should not be used without consent, especially in consideration of past incidents with Facebook, Uber, Airbnb, and other companies.  Awards  In June 2019, Clear CEO Caryn Seidman-Becker and President Ken Cornick were given the 2019 EY Entrepreneur Of The Year Award for the New York Region.

Biography Humayd hailed from an Arab noble family (ashraf) settled in the Ghuta plain around Damascus. Beginning with his great- grandfather, Ma'yuf ibn Yahya al-Hujari, his family had loyally served the Abbasids and risen to a prominent position in Syria. In 806, according to al- Tabari, Caliph Harun al-Rashid placed him in charge of \\"the Levant coastlands of the eastern Mediterranean as far as Egypt\\". Humayd was sent to raid Cyprus, while the Caliph himself led a major invasion of Byzantine Asia Minor. Humayd ravaged the island, carrying off much plunder and 16,000 of its inhabitants, including the local bishop. They were sold as slaves in the markets of al- Rafiqah, under the supervision of the qadi Abu'l-Bakhtari Wahb ibn Wahb. In the next year, he sailed on another expedition against the Byzantine Empire, this time targeting Rhodes. The island was plundered, but the city of Rhodes resisted his attempts to capture it. On his return trip, he landed at Myra, where he tried to destroy the tomb of Saint Nicholas. A storm arose, however, sinking some of his ships and forcing him to retire, which the locals attributed to the intervention of the saint. It is sometimes considered that before attacking Rhodes, Humayd led his fleet to the Peloponnese, where he either assisted or even fomented a revolt by the local Slavs, leading to the unsuccessful siege of the port city of Patras. It is however possible that the reports of Arab participation in these events are the result of a later interpolation, mixing the real Slavic revolt with subsequent Arab raids. In the late 810s or the 820s, following a brief tenure by his father, Humayd governed Damascus as deputy to an absent governor of the Jund Dimashq; Paul M. Cobb theorizes that the latter was Nasr ibn Khamza, meaning that Humayd's tenure may have lasted until the appointment of Abu Ishaq, the future al- Mu'tasim, as governor of Syria in 828.

She sailed under multiple companies until she was scrapped in 1947 after 30 years at sea.  Construction  Regina was constructed in 1917 at the Harland & Wolff shipyard in Belfast and named Regina. However it was the middle of World War I so it was decided that Regina would be launched earlier than expected. Therefore, her original commercial design wasn't completed which resulted in her only having one funnel instead of two. She would serve as a Troop transport until the end of the war before being completed for commercial use at the Harland & Wolff shipyard with a second funnel in 1919. The ship was long, with a beam of and a depth of . The ship was assessed at . She had a Combination engine driving 3 screw propellers. She also had 2 sister ships SS Pittsburgh and SS Doric.  Career/Owners  Regina returned to commercial service for Dominion Line after World War I in 1919. She made her maiden voyage for the White Star-Dominion Line joint service in March 1922, she sailed from Liverpool, United Kingdom to Halifax, Canada and to Portland, United States. In 1925 Regina was transferred solely to White Star Line but kept her name as White Star refused to rename her. She was painted in White Star's colors and served 4 years for the company. In 1929 she was sold to the Belgian company Red Star Line and renamed Westernland, she was repainted again but this time in Red Star colors. From now on she sailed under the Red Star flag and sailed the Antwerp, Belgium - Southampton, United Kingdom - New York, United States route until 1935. In 1935 Westernland/Regina was sold to Bernstein Red Star Line and later sold again to Holland America Line in 1939, she was still named Westernland at this point. When World War II broke out and German Troops invaded The Netherlands in 1940, Westernland/Regina escaped to the United Kingdom and served as a home for the exiled Dutch Government at Falmouth, United Kingdom. Later in the war Westernland/Regina served again as a Troop transport and later as a Repair ship before finally serving as a Destroyer Depot ship until the end of the war. Westernland/Regina was decommissioned in 1945 and returned to Cunard- White Star Line service. Cunard-White Star had plans to refit her but those plans were abandoned due to the ships old age. A proposal in 1946 to sell the ship and convert it into a Whale Deport ship failed. Westernland/Regina was sold for scrap and broken up in 1947.

Early life and education Gilou was a descendant of Charles Sedelmeyer on his mother's side, and his father, Pierre Gilou, was a tennis player who captained the French Tennis Federation and won the Davis Cup five times. Gilou was raised in a highly motivating environment, and was given art and music lessons. In 1939, Gilou graduated from the Paris √âcole des Beaux-Arts with a degree in architecture. He was awarded two medals in drawing and sculpture modelling. Career During World War II, Gilou served as a naval officer, and in 1940 joined General de Gaulle and the \\"France Libre\\" on a staff mission. In 1942 he enlisted in the FNFL (Flotte Nationale de la France Libre, the French Resistance Navy), where he became an Officer Interpreter for the Cipher Services (ORIC).http://alamer.fr/index.php?NIUpage=31&Param1;=25999 alamer.frhttp://www.francaislibres.net/liste/fiche.php?index=71027 francaislibres.net In 1945, Pierre Lazareff, Chief Editor of the daily France- Soir, decided to foster the creation of a new monthly news magazine, R√©alit√©s, with its first issue dated February 1946. After collaborating regularly with the magazine as an art counselor and critic, Gilou accepted the position of Art Director of R√©alit√©s in 1950. Gilou considered photography as an art in its own right and hired many photographers to produce photographs for the R√©alit√©s magazine. The photographers he hired included Edouard Boubat, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa, David Seymour, Werner Bischof, Bruce Davidson, Dennis Stock, Eugene Smith, Robert Doisneau, Brassa√Ø, Manuel Alvarez Bravo, William Klein, Irving Penn, and Richard Avedon.INDEX OF PHOTOGRAPHERS PUBLISHED IN REALITES MAGAZINE from February 1946 to December 1964, in : Anne de Mondenard & Michel Guerrin, op. cit. pp 152‚Äì158. In 1951, Gilou created a monthly art magazine called Connaisseur des Arts. It was renamed to Connaissance des Arts in 1952. Francis Spar was its Managing Editor, while Gilou was its Art Director. Gilou also directed the creation of R√©alit√©s' collection of art reference books. He always responded favourably to invitations to speak at conferences or to lead art workshops. In this line, he began giving lectures and courses at the Institut Sup√©rieur des Beaux-Arts of Besan√ßon (Doubs, France) in 1958. Gilou was also an enthusiastic art collector. During the last years of his life, he collected art pieces that were oriented towards spirituality and its various expressions in art: Chinese paintings and sculptures, Japanese zen portraits, Persian paintings, Christian Bysantine and Mosan art, and archa√Øc Greek sculptures. In 1960, the French Ministry of Culture supported Gilou's project to establish a collection of France's religious architecture and art, but Gilou's brutal and accidental death in 1961 put an end to the ambitious project. Personal life Gilou was married to Miriam Gilou-Cendrars, the daughter and biographer of the writer and poet Blaise Cendrars. They had three children.

The Lorillard Spencer Troop On 15 November 1914, 2nd Lieutenant Sherman Kiser, then a young US Army artillery officer with the Philippine Scouts at Pettit Barracks in Zamboanga City, organised the Lorillard Spencer Troop, named after Lorillard Suydam Spencer (1883-1939),son of Lorillard Spencer and father of Lorillard Suydam Spencer, Jr., member of the Officers of the National Council and Executive Board of the Boy Scouts of America (Cf: Scouting, Vol. I, No. 1, April 15, 1913, page 4), indirectly honoring Lorillard's mother Caroline Suydam Berryman Spencer, a wealthy widow who worked as a missionary on Mindan√°o and provided money for the troop's Boy Scout uniforms. (Cf: The Telegraph Herald, Dubuque, Iowa, December 5, 1913.) In 1915 the Boy Scouts of America magazine Boys' Life, Vol. V, No. 6, August 1915, page 21, reported: \\"Lieut. Kiser of the Philippine scouts in the American army has organized a troop of boy scouts in the town of Zamboango. The boys are keenly interested in scouting and put the scout law into action daily.

In 1929 he graduated from the United States Army Command and General Staff College. On 14 March 1946, the 14th Major Port, the US Army unit Col. Kiser served as Port Commander, was honored by the Mayor and burghers of the Borough of Southampton in England ‚Äì allowing them to march through the town \\"with bayonets fixed, drums beating, and colours flying\\" ‚Äì for outstanding achievement in the operation of the Port of Southampton during World War II and on D-Day, the Allied invasion of Normandy. Later, Col. Kiser was also honored as a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his World War II service. Author After retirement, Kiser authored The American Concept of Leadership and Americanism in Action. In 1955 he gifted a copy of The American Concept of Leadership, personally inscribed to US Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson (later the President and Prophet of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Bronze Wolf awardee).

Desdunes (c.1870 - April 24, 1929) was a civil rights activist and musician in New Orleans and Omaha, Nebraska. Descended from a family of people of color free before the Civil War, in 1892 he volunteered to board a train car designated for whites in violation of the Louisiana 1890 Separate Car Act. This would be a test case to enable the New Orleans Comit√© des Citoyens to challenge the law in the courts. The train he boarded was an interstate train, and the court found that the law did not apply to such cases, which were bound by federal law and regulation. Shortly later, another member of the Comit√© des Citoyens, Homer Plessy, was selected to board an intrastate train. He was arrested for refusing to leave the white car, and what became known as Plessy vs Ferguson (1896) was litigated to the US Supreme Court. In the meantime, Desdunes became a musician, directing bands, orchestras, and minstrel shows and playing many instruments, including the coronet, the violin, the baritone horn, and the trombone. He was known for many styles, including minstrel, ragtime, jazz, gospel,\\"Concert by Colored Choir Delights Large Audience\\", Omaha World-Herald (Omaha, Nebraska), June 1, 1922, Page: 2 classical, and marching. He performed under the direction of Perry George Lowery in P. T. Wright's Nashville Students and under Harry Prampin in Lash E. Gideon's Grand Afro American Mastodon Minstrels and Gideon's Big Minstrel Carnival. In 1904 Desdunes moved to Omaha, which had become a destination for African Americans from the South during the Great Migration to northern cities. There his band became a fixture in civic life, and he also led the Boys Town Band at Father Flanagan's Boys Town. He was described as the \\"father of negro musicians of Omaha\\" in Harrison J. Pinkett's 1937 manuscript, \\"An Historical Sketch of the Omaha Negro.\\"H.J. Pinkett, \\"An Historical Sketch of the Omaha Negro\\" (1937). - parts of this text are available appended to WPA interview by Fred Dixon of Arthur Goodlett https://www.loc.gov/resource/wpalh1.16041210/ Life Daniel Desdunes was born in about 1870 (perhaps 1873Vernhettes, Dan and Hanley, Peter. \\"The Desdunes Family\\".

His siblings were Agnes (about 1873), Louise (about 1874), Coritza (born in 1876), and Wendelle (born winter 1876-1877). Rodolphe was a customs agent, civil rights activist, journalist, historian, and poet. In 1879, Rodolphe started a relationship with Clementine Walker, born in 1860 and daughter of John and Ophelia Walker. Rodolphe and Clementine had at least four children together: Mary Celine (in 1879), John Alexander (1881), Louise (1889), and Oscar (1892). Clementine died September 23, 1893. Mary Celine later became known as Mamie Desdunes and was a blues pianist. Clementine lived near Jelly Roll Morton's godmother and J√©r√©mie and Henriette Desdunes were neighbors of Morton's mother. From this proximity, Morton learned the song he later recorded as \\"Mamie's Blues\\" or \\"2:19 Blues\\" and attributed to Mamie, singing, \\"Can‚Äôt give a dollar, give a lousy dime,/ I wanna feed that hungry man of mine.\\" Other associates of Mamie included performer Bunk Johnson and promoters Hattie Rogers and Lulu White. Mamie was born March 25, 1879, married George Degay in 1898, and died of tuberculosis on December 4, 1911. Oscar was also a musician and played with his nephew Clarence's (son of Daniel) band, the Joyland Revellers, after Clarence's death in 1933. Rodolphe had three other daughters, possibly by Clementine, named Edna, Lucille, and Jeanne (born about 1893). Daniel F. Desdunes attended public schools in New Orleans and went to Straight University, a historically black college. After college he worked as a house painter and music teacher. In 1895, Desdunes married Victoria Oliver. They had a son, Clarence, on February 17, 1896, and Victoria died shortly afterward. Desdunes married a second time to Madia Dodd. Desdunes lived in New Orleans for most of the 1890s, although he called Chicago home for part of 1899.The Stage. Freeman (Indianapolis, Indiana), June 3, 1899, Volume: 12 Issue: 22 Page: 5 In 1904 he moved to Omaha, where he lived the rest of his life. Madia died March 3, 1930 while visiting her sister, Geneva Mabry in Brooklyn, NY.\\"Death Comes Suddenly to Mrs. Dan Desdunes.\\" Omaha World-Herald (Omaha, Nebraska), March 3, 1930, Page: 1 Her funeral was at St. Philip's Episcopal in Omaha and her burial was at Forest Lawn.\\"Mrs. Dan Desdunes\\". Omaha World-Herald (Omaha, Nebraska), March 7, 1930, Page: 23 Comit√© des Citoyens In 1890, the Separate Car Act was passed by the Louisiana State Legislature, segregating public transportation. Aristide, Rodolphe and Daniel Desdunes, Louis Martinet, Eugene Luscy, Paul Bonseigneur, L. J. Joubert, P. B. S. Pinchback, Caesar Antoine, Homer Plessy and other leaders who had been free men of color before the Civil War formed the Comit√© des Citoyens to organize black civil rights efforts. Rodolphe enlisted Dan, his eldest son, to violate the act in order to challenge it in court. On February 24, 1892, Daniel boarded a train bound for Mobile, Alabama. While stopped at the corner of Elysian Fields and Claiborne in New Orleans, Daniel was arrested. However, Judge John Howard Ferguson ruled that the Separate Car Act could not be enforced for interstate travel because the constitution only granted authority only to the federal government to regulate inter-state travel and commerce. The Comit√© challenged the law again, with a case of intrastate travel. Plessy volunteered to break the law. When the case, Plessy vs. Ferguson, finally reached the U. S. Supreme Court in 1896, the court ruled that it was legitimate for a state to establish \\"separate but equal\\" facilities, and Plessy's rights had not been violated. Albion Tourgee and James C. Walker were the lead defense counsel team in both cases. About that time the Comit√© and the Crusader both disbanded. Early career in New Orleans In the early 1890s, Desdunes was performing regularly with cornetist Sylvester Coustaut. Desdunes played violin and baritone horn for the band he co-led, known as the Coustaut-Desdunes Band. Also in the band were violinist O'Neill Levasseur and George Filhe. The band focused on quadrilles and schottishes. Later in the decade, Desdunes joined the fraternal organization the Soci√©t√© des Jeunes Amis, with Philip Nickerson, the son of Professor William Nickerson; and also the Onward Brass Band. He also performed with traveling minstrel shows as early as 1894. In the late 1890s Desdunes was performing with P. G. Lowery in the P. T. Wright-led Nashville Students. By the spring of 1897, Desdunes was the leader of the orchestra within the group, while Lowery led the band.\\"The Stage.\\" The Freeman Post Office.

In 1921, Desdunes was invited to teach the boys at Boys Town in music.

The term cycle refers to repeated applications of stress that lead to eventual fatigue and failure; low-cycle pertains to a long period between applications. Study in fatigue has been focusing on mainly two fields: application in designing regarding size in aeronautics and energy production using advanced calculation methods. The LCF result allows us to study the behavior of the material in greater depth to better understand the complex mechanical and metallurgical phenomena (crack propagation, work softening, strain concentration, work hardening, etc.). History Common factors that have been attributed to low-cycle fatigue (LCF) are high stress levels and a low number of cycles to failure. Many studies have been carried out, particularly in the last 50 years on metals and the relationship between temperature, stress, and number of cycles to failure. Tests are used to plot an S-N curve, and it has been shown that the number of cycles to failure decreased with increasing temperature. However, extensive testing would have been too costly so researchers mainly resorted to using finite element analysis using computer software. A graph comparing the number of cycles to failure for low cycle fatigue and high cycle fatigue. Through many experiments, it has been found that characteristics of a material can change as a result of LCF. Fracture ductility tends to decrease, with the magnitude depending on the presence of small cracks to begin with. To perform these tests, an electro-hydraulic servo-controlled testing machine was generally used, as it is capable of not changing the stress amplitude. It was also discovered that performing low-cycle fatigue tests on specimens with holes already drilled in them were more susceptible to crack propagation, and hence a greater decrease in fracture ductility. This was true despite the small hole sizes, ranging from 40‚Äì200 Œºm. Characteristics When a component is subject to low cycle fatigue, it is repeatedly plastically deformed. For example, if a part were to be loaded in tension until it was permanently deformed (plastically deformed), that would be considered one half cycle of low cycle fatigue, or LCF. In order to complete a full cycle the part would need to be deformed back into its original shape. The number of LCF cycles that a part can withstand before failing is much lower than that of regular fatigue. This condition of high cyclic strain is often the result of extreme operating conditions, such as high changes in temperature. Thermal stresses originating from an expansion or contraction of materials can exacerbate the loading conditions on a part and LCF characteristics can come into play. Mechanics A commonly used equation that describes the behavior of low- cycle fatigue is the Coffin-Manson relation (published by L. F. Coffin in 1954 and S. S. Manson in 1953): :\\\\frac {\\\\Delta \\\\varepsilon_p} {2} = \\\\varepsilon_f '(2N)^c where, *ŒîŒµp /2 is the plastic strain amplitude; *Œµf' is an empirical constant known as the fatigue ductility coefficient defined by the strain intercept at 2N =1; *2N is the number of reversals to failure (N cycles); *c is an empirical constant known as the fatigue ductility exponent, commonly ranging from -0.5 to -0.7. Small c results in long fatigue life.O'Donnell, W.J. and B.F. Langer. Nuclear Science and Engineering, Vol 20, pp. 1-12, 1964. Notable failures One noteworthy event in which the failure was a result of LCF was the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Many buildings and bridges collapsed, and as a result over 9,000 people were injured. Researchers at the University of Southern California analyzed the main areas of a ten-story building that were subjected to low-cycle fatigue. Unfortunately, there was limited experimental data available to directly construct a S-N curve for low-cycle fatigue, so most of the analysis consisted of plotting the high-cycle fatigue behavior on a S-N curve and extending the line for that graph to create the portion of the low-cycle fatigue curve using the Palmgren-Miner method. Ultimately, this data was used to more accurately predict and analyze similar types of damage that the ten-story steel building in Northridge faced.

He was educated at Tsinghua University then went to the United States for a doctorate at University of Wisconsin, Madison and post-doctoral work at University of London. In the years leading up to the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945) he was prominent in the National Salvation Association (ÊïëÂõΩËÅîÂêà Jiuguo lianhui) that agitated for resistance to Japan and criticized the Nationalist government for its weak policies. He was one of the so-called Seven Gentlemen, liberal scholars and activists arrested in 1936 for advocating a United Front between the Nationalist Party and the Communist Party of China in order to fight Japanese expansionism. He was active in the China Democratic League during and after the war. After the foundation of the People's Republic of China, he continued to advocate constitutional government, democratic reforms, human rights and democracy, but was attacked after the 100 Flowers Movement of 1957 and in the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976). Early life Wang was a native of Anfu County, Jiangxi, born September 1903 to a family of lumber and bamboo merchants. In 1919, as a middle-school student at Tsinghua College in Beijing he participated in the May Fourth Movement that attacked traditional Chinese civilization, and was twice arrested and jailed. He was student council president. After graduation in August 1925 he went to the United States, where he obtained a PhD in Political Science at the University of Wisconsin in June 1929. He then went as a research student to London School of Economics, where he worked with Harold Laski, the Fabian Socialist. Career and political activism In 1930 Wang returned to China by way of the Soviet Union and was appointed Dean of Faculty of Arts at Shanghai's Guanghua University. After the Japanese attacked Manchuria in the 1931 Mukden Incident, he founded Zhuzhang yu piping ‰∏ªÂº†‰∏éÊâπËØÑ (Advocacy and criticism) semimonthly, later founded the \\"Freedom Forum Ëá™Áî±ËÆ∫Âùõ (Ziyou luntan) magazine. November 1933, he participated in the \\"Fujian Rebellion. 7 Gentleman Released, Suzhou July 31, 1936 (Wang Zaoshi, Shi Liang, Zhang Naiqi, Shen Junru, Sha Qianli, Li Gongbu, and Zou Taofen)In the early 1930s, increasing repression by the Nationalist government led a group of both leftist and liberal intellectuals, including Song Qingling, Cai Yuanpei, and Lin Yutang, to form the China League for the Protection of Civil Rights (Zongguo minquan baozhang tongmeng), which also urged resistance to Japanese expansionism. Wang joined them, but seemed more interested in theoretical discussions than their campaigns to support political prisoners or civil rights. The League dissolved when one of its leading organizers was assassinated outside League headquarters in Shanghai, but the debate continued. Near the end of 1935, Wang, Zou Taofen, Shen Junru and several others organized the Shanghai Cultural Salvation Council. In 1936 he became head of the Shanghai Federation of National Salvation as cultural propaganda officer. He urged the Nationalist government to stop internal repression, to free political prisoners, and to put up resistance to the Japanese. In June 1936, Wang, Shen, Zou, Zhang Naiqi, Li Gongpu, Sha Qianli, and Shi Liang were arrested in the famous Seven Gentlemen Incident. While in jail, Wang revised the manuscript for his book An Analysis of the China Problem, whose publication government censors had prevented, and worked on Huangmiao ji (Absurd Notes). At the trial in April 1937 Huang argued that indicting his group for the crime of criticizing the government assumed that to criticize the government was to weaken the nation. This assumption, Wang told the court, ignored modern principles of political theory because the government derived its power from the people. When the seven were released on bail in July, they proclaimed that \\"one is not wrong to for wanting to save the country.\\" In March 1938, Wang offered a politics class at Jiangxi School of Education as Professor and Director, responsible for the training of cadres in Jiangxi Province during the Anti-Japanese War. In September, in Ji'an he founded Daily Front, and was elected to the National Political Council. After the war he founded the Shanghai Free Press, also served as private legal counsel. During these years, Wang was active in the China Democratic League, many of whose members had been human rights advocates since the 1920s. In December 1948, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the seizure of Chu Anping's liberal Shanghai magazine Guancha (Observer), and the arrest of the staff. Wang Zaoshi organized pressure on the authorities and the prisoners were released in February of the following year. In the People's Republic When the People's Liberation Army entered Shanghai, Wang was active in the \\"patriotic democracy movement\\" and in 1951, was made history professor at Fudan University and director of its Institute of World History. In the mid-1950s, Wang, along with older, liberal colleagues such as Fei Xiaotong, Chu Anping, Chen Renbing, and Luo Longji, was cautious in his criticisms of the political situation, but in 1957 joined the 100 Flowers Movement, in which liberals, seemingly at Mao's invitation, became more forthright. Wang told the People's Political Consultative Conference of 1957 that the \\"rule of law has to be strengthened if we are to extend democracy.\\" In the following Anti-Rightist Movement, Mao Zedong declared them all rightists. In September 1960 Wang was briefly rehabilitated, but in the Cultural Revolution Wang's daughter, Hairuo suffered from schizophrenia. His daughter Hairong refused to participate in criticism of her father, was labeled a \\"counter-revolutionary\\", and tortured to death. His sons were hospitalized for schizophrenia and died in hospital. In 1966 Wang was held in Shanghai First Detention Center, where in September 1971, due to hepatorenal syndrome, he died at the age of 70. Views on democracy and human rights Wang's views on human rights (minquan) had been shaped by Harold Laski's Fabianism. He argued \\"human rights\\" were different from the \\"natural rights\\" advocated by John Locke and rejected the idea that these rights proceeded from nature or that they were inherent; Wang insisted that human rights were indeed attached to man's moral nature, but that their central value was that meaningful existence would be impossible without them. Without rights, one could be hardly said to be a person (zuoren): people needed rights as much as a fish needs water. His definition of minquan was those fundamental rights required to develop the individual, protect individual interests, and promote social progress, a utilitarian definition rather than a Lockean one based on natural rights. Constitutionalism was another aspect of Wang's desires for China. He argued that constitutionalism had not failed in the years since the establishment of the Republic in 1912, for in fact it had never been tried. Critics pointed to their weaknesses, but the problem was not with constitutions but with the fact that \\"wicked people\\" undermined and opposed the principles behind them. Wang had high hopes for the People's Political Consulative Council, established just after the war with Japan started in 1937. He felt that the wide range of political parties and views represented in the new body could become a channel of communication between the government and the masses, leading eventually to democratic institutions. Wang criticized the Nationalist Party's doctrine of tutelage, which Sun Yat-sen had proposed to use for a transitional period but Chiang Kai-shek saw as justifying almost indefinite party rule. Wang agreed that the majority of the Chinese people were ignorant, but questioned whether the GMD was full of talented, honest, and morally pure members. Political tutelage, Wang charged, should be based on \\"good-man politics\\" (xianren zhengzhi). He argued that the GMD illustrated the rule: \\"It is human nature that, once in power, people either as individuals or as groups, are unwilling to give it up.\\" In 1957 he wrote that under the emperors, the censorate \\"had the right to impeach officials independently and publicly,\\" and that \\"perhaps we can consider expanding the monitoring role of the CPPCC... into something similar\\", which would \\"foster and carry on the fine tradition of scholars of integrity that China has had throughout her history.

In veterinary medicine, it helps differentiate the stages of the mammalian estrous cycle because the vaginal epithelium changes in response to sex hormone levels; practically, it is used to distinguish when a female canine is at a particular point in the estrous cycle. In a normal vaginal smear, lactational cells, navicular cells, endocervical cells, endometrial cells, trophoblastic cells, and leucocytes may be present. Vaginal cytology allows a clinician to: * Determine whether a canine is actually in heat. * Aid in determining the correct time to begin performing more expensive serum progesterone and luteinizing hormone (LH) assays for precise ovulation timing. * Determine if it is too late in the estrous cycle to perform artificial insemination in dogs unable or unwilling to breed naturally. * Determine if a bitch is under the influence of estrogen. * Predict the correct day to perform an elective cesarean section. The equipment needed for vaginal cytology includes a vaginal speculum, cotton-tipped applicators, frosted microscope slides, commercial Romanowsky stain, and light microscope. Types of cells *Basal cells - give rise to all epithelium in a vaginal smear. They are small cells with round nuclei, and a high nucleus-to-cytoplasm (N:C) ratio. They are rarely observed.Cowell, R., & Valenciano, A. (2019). Cowell and Tyler‚Äôs Diagnostic Cytology and Hematology of the Dog and Cat. (5th ed.). St Louis, MO: Elsevier.The two darker, smaller cells are parabasal cells surrounded by larger intermediate cells *Parabasal cells - the smallest epithelial cells seen on a typical vaginal smear, and are derived from the basal layer of squamous epithelial cells. They are round or nearly round and have a high nucleus-to-cytoplasm (N:C) ratio. Cytoplasm is dense and basophilic. The nucleus has finely granular chromatin and is vasiculated.Brown, M., & Tighe, M. (2015). Mosby‚Äôs Comprehensive Review for Veterinary Technicians. (4th ed.). St Louis, MO: Elsevier *Intermediate cells - two to three times larger than parabasal cells, but their nuclei are similar in size to parabasal cell nuclei. Small intermediate cells are round or almost round with a large prominent nucleus. Large intermediate cells, also called superficial intermediate cells or transitional intermediate cells, have a polygonal shape, and a small N:C ratio. *Superficial cells (dead cells) - the largest cells seen on a vaginal cytology and are derived from the outermost layer of non- keratinized epithelial cells. They are polygonal in shape, flat, and often have the appearance of being rolled up. The nuclei are absent or pyknotic, meaning small and dark. The cytoplasm may develop small vacuoles as the cells age. Cornification is the degeneration process into these large, flat, anucleated cells. Superficial cells without nuclei are considered fully cornified. *Metestrum cells - vaginal epithelial cells containing neutrophils in their cytoplasm. Although their name implies they are seen during metestrus, these cells are not specific for any stage of estrous. *Foam cells - sometimes seen during anestrus, and are simply nondescript cells with large vacuoles. Observable cells in each stage of estrous cycle =Proestrus= Proestrus in a canine * Early- to mid-proestrus - During this stage, vaginal cytology will show a gradual shift from parabasal cells, to intermediate cells, to superficial cells. Also present are neutrophils and red blood cells in large numbers. The red blood cells are due to the proliferation of vaginal epithelium caused by increased levels of estrogen. The cells may float in basophilic mucous. * Late-proestrus - there is a decrease in neutrophils because they are unable to cross the thickening vaginal wall. Cytology consists mostly of large intermediate and superficial cells. Red blood cells and bacteria may be present. =Estrus= Estrus in a canine Estrus is characterized by the presence of all superficial cells, many of which are anuclear (without a nucleus) or have small, pyknotic nuclei, and red blood cells may be present, along with bacteria. No neutrophils are seen unless there is inflammation. There is usually no mucous in the background. =Diestrus= In diestrus, superficial cells are replaced by parabasal and intermediate cells within one to two days of onset. Neutrophils are increased. Red blood cells may be absent or present. Bacteria is commonly observed. A smear made during late estrus to early diestrus may appear similar to one made in early- or mid-proestrus. =Anestrus= The final stage of estrous is anestrus, which is characterized by predominantly non-cornified squamous epithelial cells, such as intermediate or parabasal cells. The cells are smaller, have basophilic cytoplasm, and large round nuclei. There may be some neutrophils, but no red blood cells. The overall cellularity is low.

The track was released as the lead single from the group's second studio album Infestissumam. The song reached number 22 on The Official Finnish Charts. Background and release On December 14, 2012, the website SecularHaze.com was created by Ghost. The website contained a sound clip of a new Ghost song without vocals. On the page was a clock ticking backwards and five candles, each playing one element of the new song when the user hovered over it with the mouse. The next day, the band uploaded a new song to their official YouTube channel, also called \\"Secular Haze\\". Later that day, they performed a special concert in their hometown of Link√∂ping, Sweden, performing the entire Opus Eponymous record along with \\"Secular Haze\\" and their cover of \\"I'm a Marionette\\". Before \\"Secular Haze\\" was performed, Papa Emeritus, the band's vocalist, disappeared into the black of the stage to be replaced by Papa Emeritus II. After this concert, SecularHaze.com was updated to include a sixth candle containing the vocal track of the song \\"Secular Haze\\". Four days later, the band announced the title of their second album, Infestissumam, along with the webpage Infestissumam.com which showed the album's track list. Ghost performing in Spain at the Sonisphere Festival, 2013 \\"Secular Haze\\" was the album's first single, given as a free digital download to fans signing up to the band's mailing list from December 15, 2012. A limited pressing of 10\\" vinyl records of the single was later released. On choosing \\"Secular Haze\\" as the first single, a Ghoul said \\"we wanted to present a song from the new record that sort of stood on its own but without being too far off from the first record\\". The single's B-side is the cover of ABBA's \\"I'm a Marionette\\", which features Dave Grohl of Nirvana and Foo Fighters on drums as well as production. The collaboration happened when, before going to Nashville to record the album, Ghost had a bunch of covers demoed and were discussing if they should squeeze them onto the album. \\" ... we were at a festival in Europe and Foo Fighters was playing, and we knew that Dave was a fan, and [when we talked to him] after a few handshakes and a few laughs, we were like Okay, so you liked the band? So do you want to do something? And he said yeah, and one month later we were in [his studio in] L.A. doing that.\\" Ghost's version of \\"I'm a Marionette\\" was included on the deluxe and Japanese editions of Infestissumam. It and the other material recorded with Grohl was also released on the If You Have Ghost EP, which also includes a live performance of \\"Secular Haze\\". The band Tub Ring covered the song on their 2017 album A Choice of Catastrophes. Music video Ghost recorded their first music video for \\"Secular Haze\\" in Link√∂ping, with director Amir Chamdin. It was uploaded to the band's official YouTube channel on February 19, 2013. The video shows a performance of the band on a stage, reminiscent of a 1970s television show.

It is generally accepted that this strike led to the strategic victory of the Transnistrian/Russian military and the tactical setbacks of the Military of Moldova when installing a Moldovan government in the region.https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/ogrv-moldova.htm =OGRF establishment= After the war, the 14th Army was split between the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the Russian Army, with most of the Russian contingent being absorbed into Western Military District.

The task force provides the largest contingent of peacekeepers in the region. On 27 June 2016, the Transnistrian government passed new law which penalized any actions or public statements that criticize the OGRF. The punishment for committing this crime is 3-7 years in jail.

He founded the Eddie Bauer company to sell tennis-related items in Seattle, Washington in 1920. From a rented workbench inside another man's shop, it grew to become an international brand outfitting mountaineering and scientific expeditions with down-insulated garments and sleeping bags. Early life Bauer's passion for the outdoors was apparent from an early age. Born outside of Eastsound, Washington on Orcas Island in 1899, he grew up exploring the woods and waters of the Pacific Northwest, learning to fish before he was in school, and to hunt before he was a teenager. His parents, Jacob and Mary Catherine Bauer, were of German ancestry; they immigrated to Seattle from Russia in 1890, the year after the Great Seattle Fire when the city was booming with reconstruction. Bauer's father worked variously as the manager of a plum orchard, the caretaker of a country club, and as a carpenter on Seattle's first world's fair, the 1909 Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition. Career At age 13, the young Bauer left school and went to work at Seattle's Piper & Taft, one of the largest sporting goods and outfitting stores on the West Coast. For the next six years he apprenticed among the experienced hunters and fishermen on staff. At the age of 20, he left Piper & Taft and went into business for himself. =Bauer‚Äôs Sport Shop= In February 1920, Bauer rented space in Bob Newton's Gun Shop, set up a workbench, and opened Eddie Bauer‚Äôs Tennis Shop, where he sold and strung tennis rackets. Seven months later, around Labor Day, he put up a sign on his bench, \\"Eddie Bauer has gone hunting. Back February 1st.\\" That practice of spending a significant portion of the year in the backcountry became a hallmark of Bauer's operation when his business expanded enough to support his own space and he shifted its primary focus to outfitting outdoorsmen. While unconventional, it gave him the opportunity to develop and test the products that established his reputation as an outfitter for expeditions all over the world. His backcountry experience was also a key component in his offering an unconditional guarantee on everything he sold. As an outdoorsman, Bauer understood that in the wilderness, clothing and gear was vital. His groundbreaking development of the Skyliner, the first down jacket patented in America (U.S. Patent D119,122; 1940), came as the result of his suffering nearly fatal hypothermia on a winter fishing trip in 1935. In his words, \\"There can be no compromising quality when lives depend on performance.\\" With the development of down-insulated garments and sleeping bags, Bauer's expedition outfitting operation grew substantially. Designed and constructed in Seattle, the products were field-tested both in the mountains of the Pacific Northwest and in cold-storage lockers in downtown Seattle to ensure they would stand up to their unconditional guarantee, and to the company's claim, \\"Built for service you‚Äôll never require.\\" =World War II production= Six months after the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the Japanese attacked the Aleutian Islands, establishing garrisons on two of the islands, Attu and Kiska. This set in motion the year-long Aleutian Islands Campaign to remove the invaders from the Alaska Territory. In October 1941, Bauer was granted his second and third design patents for quilted down apparel‚Äîa down parka (U.S. Patent D130,167) and pants (U.S. Patent D130,166) that created a cold-weather suit he intended for Alaskan bush pilots and others who spent significant time in severe weather. In the early days of the Aleutian Campaign, some of the American pilots were buying this cold weather suit, and early in 1943 the U.S. Army Air Forces contacted Bauer, asking him to design a \\"cold weather buoyancy flight suit\\" for them. At Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio, Bauer designed the down-insulated B-9 Parka and A-8 Flight Pants. During the course of the war, Bauer manufactured approximately 50,000 of these suits. He also made 200,000 down sleeping bags for the military as part of the war effort. =Expedition outfitting= The 1950s have been called the Golden Age of Himalayan Mountaineering, as twelve of the world's fourteen 8000-meter peaks were first summited in that decade, with the first being Annapurna in 1950.Herzog, Maurice (1997). Annapurna, First Conquest of an 8000-Meter Peak, The Lyons Press. p. 13. . In 1953, a team of seven Americans and one British climber was attempting the first ascent of K2, the world's second highest peak. Three of the Americans were from Seattle, and they came to Bauer to ask if he could create a down-insulated parka for them. Bauer and his team built the Kara Koram Parka, named for the mountain range where K2 is located. In a letter to Bauer's partner, William F. Niemi, dated January 18, 1953, expedition leader Charles Snead Houston called it, \\"the finest article of cold weather, high altitude equipment I have ever seen.\\"Eddie Bauer Archives While unsuccessful in reaching the summit, the Third American Karakoram Expedition is widely admired for their heroic efforts to work together in surviving under catastrophic conditions. Their reputation, and enthusiastic endorsement of Bauer's parka, sealed Bauer's reputation as an expedition outfitter, and led to his down-insulated gear being used on many historic expeditions, including first ascents of Gasherbrum I (1958), Masherbrum (1960), and Antarctica's Vinson Massif (1966),\\"Antarctic Climbers Face Many Perils,\\" Svein Gilje, The Seattle Times, November 15, 1966 as well as the first American ascent of Mount Everest (1963)Ullman, James Ramsey (1964). Americans On Everest, J.B. Lippincott Company. p. 331 =Wanapum Kennels= As an outdoorsman, Bauer had worked with many breeds of field dogs until 1930, when he purchased a young Labrador retriever in British Columbia. He was so impressed by the dog's strength, stamina, and intelligence that he never owned another breed of field dog again. In 1960, he formed Wanapum Kennels to breed and raise champion field trial Labradors. His first dog of note was Dart of Netley Creek, who whelped several champions. The most famous of these was Wanapum Dart's Dandy, who became the first American Labrador retriever to be a Triple Crown national champion, and was inducted into the Retriever Hall of Fame. Retirement activities In 1968, Bauer and his son, Eddie Christian, sold their interests in the Eddie Bauer company to their partners, William F. Niemi, Sr. and Jr. For many years after, Bauer continued an active pursuit of his passion for hunting and fishing, as well as for his Wanapum dogs. In 1972, he designed and patented a fishing lure, the B&B; Flasher (U.S. Patent 3,673,727). In 1974, Bauer was named Retriever Breeder of the Year. In 1982 and 1983, he co- authored with Archie Satterfield three titles for the Eddie Bauer Outdoor Library: The Eddie Bauer Guide To Family Camping, The Eddie Bauer Guide to Cross-Country Skiing, and The Eddie Bauer Guide to Backpacking. Personal life On a hunting trip in eastern Washington in the fall of 1927, Bauer met Christine, \\"Stine\\" Heltborg, a young beauty shop owner from Seattle. Their first date was a fishing trip the following spring. They were married in February. Bauer referred to his wife as \\"my wilderness companion,\\" and said that she had more stamina in the backcountry than he did. In addition to being an accomplished outdoorswoman, Stine Bauer was a champion markswoman, winning the Washington State Women's Trapshooting Championship eight years running, from 1930‚Äì1937. Her string ended when she retired with the birth of their child, Eddie Christian, on February 5, 1938. On April 18, 1986, Bauer died, fifteen days after his wife of 57 years had died.

History  In 1883, Captain John Thomas Lowe made a landing here, with the town getting its name from Anona sweet apples from Key West. At first it was going to be named Lowe's landing but its postmaster, from Cedar Key suggested it was to be Anona. In December 1883, the town gained a post office with Jefferson Lowe as its post master. There was a railroad spur that had crossed over the island here that allowed for transportation of goods to and from here (bridge removed in 1928). Soon the post office at the landing was converted to a General Store for the residents here. In 1872, the town got its first church which was made by the residents with Rev. John Wells as its preacher. A year later in 1873, a church board was formed and a schoolhouse was most likely in operation there in the weekdays. In 1882 a second church building was built and is still used today as part of a church. In 1900, the school was moved to the new building. In 1916, a bridge for cars and pedestrians was built across with a toll of 25 cents. The town was later on absorbed into Largo.

It was an unusual accident, considering that there were no fatalities under the circumstances. Aircraft The Dakota involved made its first flight in 1944 as Douglas C-47A 42-92633 military transport of the United States Army Air Force (USAAF) and had Douglas serial number 12455, it was transferred to the Royal Air Force (RAF) as KG420. KG420 was registered to Railway Air Services as a Dakota 3 in March 1946 with the British registration G-AGZA, powered by 2 Pratt & Whitney R-1830-92 Twin Wasp engines.  Crash  The Railway Air Services Dakota was ready to depart from Northolt Aerodrome, London, United Kingdom on a scheduled service to Glasgow Airport on behalf of Scottish Airways and had a total of four crew and one passenger on board. The aircraft had been de-iced since it was a cold, snowy evening which had delayed the departure. While the Dakota was waiting the temperature dropped and snow began falling which froze on the wings. The aircraft was finally ready for departure and taxied into position for take-off. The snow storm had closed the airport to incoming traffic and outbound traffic was subject to long delays. The aircraft had been waiting for more than an hour for clearance. When the flight received clearance, the pilot ran the engines up to 45.5 inches of manifold pressure and 2,500 RPM.Piercey 1981, pp. 316‚Äì317. When the pilot accelerated down the runway he noticed that when the aircraft lifted off, it could not gain any height. The ice on the wings disturbed the air flow, which resulted in the aircraft not gaining any height. It was however too late to abort take-off so the crew was forced to try to get the aircraft to climb. The aircraft flew only a few metres high straight down Angus Drive from the end of the runway until the left wing contacted some rooftops and the aircraft slewed through 90 degrees and came to rest on the roofs of two houses at 44 & 46 Angus Drive in the London suburb of South Ruislip. G-AGZA was severely damaged and radio officer Murdoch was fortunate that he wasn't sitting in his seat as some metalwork was pushed through the seat and it would probably have killed him had he been sitting there. Irene Zigmund and her 4-month old-son David were in the neighbouring house (44 Angus Drive) house at the time, but the aircraft came to rest on the roof without even waking the child who was asleep in his cot upstairs. In fact no one was injured in the incident, the crew and passenger all descended into the house's loft, down the loft ladder onto the landing and then down stairs out the front door. The aircraft was a total loss and the house was damaged, but not greatly.  Investigation  It was quickly determined that the cause of the crash was the snow which had frozen to the aircraft's wings while G-AGZA was waiting to take-off, resulting in the aircraft not gaining any height and making an emergency landing on the roof of 46 Angus Drive. The house was subsequently nicknamed \\"Dakota Rest\\".Piercy 1981, p. 316. The pilot was also assigned a cause factor for failing to abort take-off after noticing it had been snowing and his aircraft being covered in snow. The crash landing on the houses earned the captain the nickname \\"Rooftop Johnson\\".Piercy 1981, p. 318.

JICA-RI was established as a research wing of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) on October 1, 2008. In the University of Pennsylvania's 2014 Global Go To Think Tanks Report, JICA-RI is ranked at the highest in the category of international development among institutions in Japan, which is followed by other institutions such as Institute of Developing Economies, JETRO (IDE-JETRO), Japan Institute of International Affairs (JIIA), and Global Industrial and Social Progress Research Institute (GISPRI).  Overview  JICA-RI, established as a part of JICA, aims at contributing to global development strategies by implementing policy-oriented, academically solid studies that address the important issues faced by developing countries. The role of JICA- RI is stipulated in the Act of the Incorporated Administrative Agency - Japan International Cooperation Agency (Act No. 136, 2002), as ‚Äúto implement study and research necessary for JICA‚Äôs activities.‚Äù JICA-RI is based in JICA Ichigaya Building in Shinjuku-ward of Tokyo, Japan.  History  JICA-RI was established on October 1, 2008, when the new JICA was launched as a result of merger of two existing institutions; former JICA which had been executing mainly technical cooperation and grant aid projects, and apart of JBIC (the Japan Bank for International Cooperation), which had been in charge of concessional yen loans. JICA-RI supersedes and strengthens the research capabilities of the former JICA and JBIC.  Organization  JICA-RI has about 20 research fellows, and headed by a director general and a deputy director general. Director General: Ichiro TAMBO (October 2014-) Deputy Director General: Naohiro KITANO Former Directors * Keiichi TSUNEKAWA (2008-2011) * Akio HOSONO (2011-2013) * Hiroshi KATO (2013-2014)  Research Strategy  According to its website JICA-RI has four research areas: peace and development, growth and poverty reduction, environment and development/climate change, and aid strategies. JICA-RI is the only research institution in Japan that is affiliated with a development agency, thus it has the advantage of access to development activities in the field and on the ground. JICA-RI intends to implement research by networking with other research institutions, as it stated in its website as ‚ÄúAs a research institute affiliated with a development agency, JICA-RI's work is both policy- and operations-oriented, carried out together with various operational and academic organizations and other professionals committed to international development.‚Äù JICA-RI has research partnership with the Brookings Institution, Center for Strategic and International Studies, Initiative for Policy Dialogue, French Development Agency, World Bank, and more.

On February 4, 2016, the bodies of Noe Martinez, his wife Rosaura, their son Noe Jr., their daughter Maria, and Maria's sons, Leonardo and Alexi, were discovered in the house at 5708 South California Avenue in Gage Park, Chicago, Illinois. Five of the victims were stabbed to death, and the sixth victim, Maria Martinez, was shot. On May 19, 2016, police arrested Diego Uribe, a relative of the family, and his girlfriend, Jafeth Ramos, in connection to the murders, saying that the massacre was a robbery gone wrong.  The massacre  Diego Uribe, who is the nephew of Maria Martinez's ex-husband, allegedly arrived at the Martinez household in the late afternoon or early evening of February 2, 2016 with the intention of robbing and killing the family. Uribe was let into the house as he was a frequent visitor to the house and apparently had a good relationship with Maria Martinez's two sons. Uribe then allegedly argued with Maria Martinez in the upper floor of the house before shooting her four times in the head. Noe Martinez Jr. rushed upstairs after hearing the shots, but Uribe allegedly beat him to death with his gun. Rosaura Martinez also rushed upstairs and was allegedly pushed downstairs by Uribe, who then grabbed several knives from the kitchen and stabbed her several times. Uribe then allegedly forced the young boys to retrieve cash, an Xbox and other valuables from various rooms in the house. Uribe then allegedly took the younger boy, Alexi, to the basement and stabbed him to death, and then returned upstairs and murdered the older boy, who begged for his life saying \\"Please no! Please don't! I just want to live!\\" Uribe then waited for the grandfather, Noe Martinez Sr. to arrive back to house from the store, whereupon he beat and stabbed him to death. Uribe and Ramos made off with the Xbox, about $550 in cash and jewelry which they pawned for about $150. Ramos is not believed to have directly committed any of the murders but has been described as an \\"active participant\\" in the massacre. The exact time at which the murders were committed is unknown, but the victims stop answering texts and phone calls to their cell phones between 5:30 p.m. and 6:45 p.m. on February 2.  Discovery  Police were called to the home to perform a well-being check after a coworker of one of the victims, Noe Martinez Jr, expressed concern because the victim had not gone to work since February 2. The bodies were discovered at around 1:05 p.m. on February 4 and quickly identified. No one from the family had been seen since February 2. Police initially stated that the events may have been a murder-suicide but have since ruled that all the deaths were homicides. The bodies were scattered throughout the entire home, which has led investigators to believe there were multiple attackers. Five of the victims were stabbed and beaten while the sixth, Maria Martinez, was shot to death. Three different bladed weapons, believed to be knives, as well as a firearm, were used to commit the murders. However, none of the murder weapons were found, though a rifle was discovered in the house. The family dog, Pelusa (Spanish for \\"fuzzy\\"), was found alive inside the house covered in blood.  Investigation  = Initial theories = Police did not ever believe that the killings were random and always believed that the family was specifically targeted, with Maria Martinez most likely being the primary target as she was shot rather than stabbed. Police also thought that the family may have been mistaken for another family that was the actual target of the killer or killers. = Arrest of suspects = On May 19, 2016, Chicago police announced that they had arrested 22-year-old Diego Uribe and his 19-year-old girlfriend, Jafeth Ramos, in connection with the murders. Uribe was related to the Martinez family through marriage. Police say that he had intended to rob the family, but ended up killing them all instead and that Ramos was acting as some kind of accomplice. The break in the case came when DNA from blood under Maria Martinez's fingernails matched Uribe. Uribe and several other family members had submitted DNA to authorities in March. Phone records also placed Uribe in the area when the murders occurred. Uribe and Ramos have both confessed to the murders and are both being charged with first-degree murder and held without bail. = Background of the suspects = Uribe and Ramos were in a committed relationship and were living in the Little Village neighborhood of Chicago with their young child at the time of the murders. Uribe did not have any previous arrests though Ramos was arrested in Cicero on October 6, 2015 for allegedly shoplifting. Both stated that they needed money for milk and diapers for their son as well as for a car. Uribe was a frequent visitor to the Martinez household and was apparently a close friend of the two boys, with a neighbor stating, \\"[he] played with those kids all the time. That family loved him.\\" However, there was apparently tension between Uribe and Maria Martinez over Martinez's divorce from Uribe's uncle. Uribe told police that he had \\"a lot of anger\\" over how she treated his uncle. Loudes Oliva, who raised Ramos, also stated that Uribe was very controlling of her and did not allow her to take showers, put on makeup or leave their home without his permission.

Guenther died from cardiac arrest which was believed to be caused by her eating disorder.  Biography  Guenther was born in San Francisco. She was raised in Los Osos, and trained at School of the American Ballet and Houston Ballet School during the summer. Guenther earned a full scholarship to the San Francisco Ballet School when she was twelve. She performed throughout high school and in 1994, performed in \\"Symphony in C\\" at the Kennedy Center. She was first told to lose weight by the San Francisco Ballet School. In 1994 and in 1995, Artistic director Anna- Marie Holmes encouraged Guenther to lose weight, eventually going to 110 pounds. The weight loss did not stop here. Gunther continued to drop weight at an alarmingly quick rate. Guenther was soon promoted to the Boston Ballet in 1994 as an apprentice dancer. A colleague, Kyra Strasberg, called Guenther, \\"a very, very talented dancer with a gorgeous light jump.\\" Though Heidi was told by the Artistic Director to lose weight in order to be successful, Holmes was not the only person who placed this kind of pressure on Guenther. George Balanchine, the father of American ballet, first created the idea that all ballerinas must be thin enough to see their bones through their skin. The dance world as a whole puts pressure on all dancers to be thin and light. Holmes just added to the pressure that is already inscribed in the minds of many young dancers. Guenther was somebody who was madly in love with dance and did whatever it took to reach her goals. Her loss of weight was one of the things she did in order to keep progressing in her career. Guenther broke her foot in the first season, as an apprentice. She did not seek medical attention, because she was afraid she would lose her contract. Instead she rested her foot when she wasn't dancing, causing her to gain five pounds. The Boston Ballet did urge her to not lose any more weight in an evaluation given in January 1997. At the time, the company was worried that she may have an eating disorder. Though the company noticed her weight loss they did not follow up with her about it. Boston Ballet did not address the issue that was an eating disorder. She was considered \\"dangerously thin\\" by the ballet's records. Holmes, however, told Guenther before she left for summer vacation starting in June 1995, that if she didn't lose the five pounds she gained, she would not gain a contract. Guenther wrote a note to herself for that summer vacation, renewing her commitment to lose weight, \\"They always pick people for parts who are skinny.\\" While the Boston Ballet did counsel her to gain weight, Guenther's mother noticed that the thinner her daughter was, the more dancing roles she was given. This added to the pressure already placed on Heidi to lose weight. During a family trip to Disneyland, Guenther died on June 30, 1997 of cardiac arrest at the age of 22. There was not an event that led up to her death. Heidi was sitting in the back seat of a vehicle when all of a sudden she was no longer breathing. Her death was speculated to be caused by her immense amount of weight loss. Heidi at a height of 5-feet-4-inches dropped to 93 pounds. The average weight for someone of this height is 120 pounds. Heidi had reached the point of being at an unhealthy weight for her height and age. In a later search, a stash of laxatives and herbal diet-aid pills were found in her possession. Along with the use of medication to lose weight, many of Heidi's friends stated that she had an unhealthy relationship with purging, as well as skipping meals. An autopsy showed no heart deformities and no abnormal substances in her blood. However, her heart wall was found to be abnormally thin. A week before her death, she told her family that her heart was \\"racing\\" and \\"pounding,\\" but she would not seek medical attention. Her family filed a wrongful death suit in 2000, against the Boston Ballet, for putting excessive pressure on Guenther to lose weight. Holmes was also named as a defendant in the suit, which was filed just before the statute of limitations expired. The suit was later rejected by the courts.  Legacy  Guenther's death \\"was a wake-up call for everyone,\\" causing ballet companies to treat eating disorders as a \\"top priority.\\" Immediately after her death, some American ballet companies said they would change their policies or offer extra information about eating disorders. Her death caused the Boston Ballet to begin nutrition counseling, onsite therapists, wellness seminars and help with weight control. Her family is attempting to start a foundation to help young athletes and dancers in honor of Guenther.

The history of aviation in New Zealand began in the late 19th century when balloon flights began. In the first decade of the 20th century, several New Zealanders began developing heavier-than-air craft with the first confirmed powered flight in New Zealand being made by Vivian Walsh in 1911. The First World War spurred the development of aviation in New Zealand. A flying school was established and several hundred New Zealanders went on to serve in British flying services in Europe. After the war, the civil aviation industry began to take shape as aero clubs became active from the late 1920s and Trans-Tasman flights were attempted. The first major commercial aviation company, Union Airways of New Zealand, began services in 1936. Meanwhile, the nation had established its own air service, the Royal New Zealand Air Force, and during the Second World War it played a significant part in the country's contributions to the Allied war effort with thousands of New Zealanders being trained under the Empire Air Training Scheme and serving in Europe, the Mediterranean and the Pacific as part of both mixed Commonwealth formations and primarily New Zealand-manned squadrons. In the post war years, the RNZAF acquired jet fighters, helicopters, maritime patrol and transport aircraft. The civil aviation industry also continued to grow with the national carrier, Air New Zealand, being formed in the 1960s, operating alongside smaller operators domestically, and internationally.  Pioneer aviation  New Zealand saw its first balloon flights in 1889. In 1894, a young American woman, Leila Adair, toured New Zealand, attracting large crowds to watch her parachute from a hot-air balloon. The first recorded aviation fatality came in 1899, when David Mahoney, known as 'Captain Lorraine' perished after his balloon was blown out to sea off Lyttelton. Several New Zealanders came close to building and flying heavier-than-air craft in the first decade of the twentieth century. Richard Pearse, working in isolation in South Canterbury, built a monoplane powered by a two-cylinder engine. He may have attempted flights as early as 1901, and there is contested evidence that he made a significant powered 'hop' in 1903, before the Wright Brothers. Herbert Pither built a plane at Invercargill in 1910, but was apparently unsuccessful in achieving sustained flights in tests there and at Timaru. Arthur Schaef made short powered hops in his first aircraft, the New Zealand Vogel, at Lyall Bay, Wellington, in 1911. The engine from this aircraft was later used in successful flights in the Wairarapa by Percy Fisher in 1913. The first confirmed powered flight in New Zealand was made by Vivian Walsh in 1911. Vivian Walsh and his brother Leo imported and assembled a Howard Wright 1909 Biplane, which Vivian Flew at Papakura on 5 February 1911.  First World War  The First World War spurred the development of aviation in New Zealand. The Walsh brothers established the New Zealand Flying School at Kohimarama on Auckland Harbour, using flying boats to train over 100 pilots. Henry Wigram established the Canterbury Aviation Company at Sockburn, Christchurch. The company imported some aeroplanes and built more, and trained 182 pilots. Some 800 New Zealanders served with the Royal Flying Corps, Royal Naval Air Service and Royal Air Force during the war, 80% of those serving as aircrew. A further 60 New Zealanders served with the Australian Flying Corps. Twelve New Zealanders became squadron leaders and fifteen were considered to be aces, including Keith Park, Keith Caldwell, Harold Beamish, Clive Collett and Arthur Coningham. William Rhodes-Moorhouse, of New Zealand parentage, became the first airman to be awarded the Victoria Cross. Developing civil aviation  Regulation of civil aviation was provided by a 1919 act of Parliament, which provided for registration of aircraft and licensing of pilots, flying schools, and personnel, as well as the registration of aircraft, and other matters. Aero clubs became active from the late 1920s, and the government provided some training aircraft and subsidies. Commercial aviation also began in the 1920s with some short-lived operations. The first major company was Union Airways of New Zealand, which began services in 1936 between Palmerston North and Dunedin via Blenheim and Christchurch. By 1939 the company was flying between Auckland, New Plymouth, Palmerston North, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin. Trans-Tasman flights were attempted from the late 1920s. John Moncrieff and George Hood disappeared while making an attempt in early 1928. Later that year, Charles Kingsford Smith and his crew flew from Sydney to Christchurch. Further flights across the Tasman followed, and by 1940 Tasman Empire Airways Limited (TEAL), jointly owned by Union Airways, Imperial Airways, Qantas Empire Airways, and the New Zealand Government was able to start scheduled services. Flying boat services across the Pacific to the United States were also developed by TEAL and Pan Am. Establishment of the Royal New Zealand Air Force New Zealand received a number of surplus military aircraft from the United Kingdom after the First World War as part of the Imperial Gift. The New Zealand Permanent Air Force was established in 1923, as part of the New Zealand Army. Bases were established at Wigram in Christchurch and Hobsonville in Auckland. A British mission led by Ralph Cochrane in 1936 led to the establishment of the separate Royal New Zealand Air Force in 1937, with Cochrane as the first Chief of Staff. New aircraft were ordered, and bases developed at Ohakea and Whenuapai as part of a new government focus on aerial defences. Second World War Geoff Fisken At the outbreak of war in 1939, the RNZAF was awaiting the delivery of 30 Vickers Wellington bombers. These aircraft, and crews, were offered back to the United Kingdom, and became No. 75 Squadron RAF. New Zealand became a major source of aircrew for the RAF, forming part of the Empire Air Training Scheme. The RNZAF itself expanded dramatically, to over thirty squadrons, many of which saw operational service in the Pacific. A number of New Zealanders enjoyed successful RAF careers. Keith Park commanded the key No. 11 Group during the Battle of Britain. Aces during the Battle of Britain included Edgar Kain, Colin Gray and Alan Deere. Arthur Coningham commanded the Desert Air Force and later 2nd Tactical Air Force during the Normandy landings. New Zealand pilots were awarded three VCs, to James Allen Ward, Leonard Trent and Lloyd Trigg. In the Pacific, RNZAF aces included Geoff Fisken. Postwar civil aviation There had been some experiments with aerial topdressing in the 1930s and these continued after the war. By the early 1950s over thirty firms were operating, mainly using the de Havilland Tiger Moth. Specialist aircraft were developed, starting with the Fletcher Fu24, from an American design. Pacific Aerospace produced the Fletcher and other later designs. TEAL had maintained its trans-Tasman service during the war. After the war, its flying boats serviced the Coral Route to Tahiti via Fiji, Samoa and the Cook Islands from 1951 to 1960. TEAL became fully owned by the New Zealand government in 1961, and became Air New Zealand in 1965. Union Airways was merged into the government-owned New Zealand National Airways Corporation (NAC) in 1945. NAC took over other private interests, and expanded air services nationwide. Main aircraft types operated by NAC included the Douglas DC-3, de Havilland Heron, Vickers Viscount, Fokker F27, and the Boeing 737. Straits Air Freight Express (SAFE Air) was established in 1950 as a specialist freight carrier across Cook Strait, operating the Bristol Type 170 Freighter Mk.31. SAFE Air was bought by NAC in 1972 and became a separate maintenance operation under Air New Zealand before being sold in 2015. NAC was merged into Air New Zealand in 1978 to form one government-owned airline for domestic and international services. Postwar RNZAF 40 Squadron Boeing 757-200 and C-130H Hercules flanked by 5 Squadron P-3K Orions breaking formation during the Whenuapai air show in March 2009. RNZAF units were deployed with the occupation force in Japan, to Cyprus and during the Malayan Emergency. Jet aircraft were acquired, firstly the de Havilland Vampire and then the English Electric Canberra. Maritime patrols were maintained with the Short Sunderland while transport squadrons were equipped with the C-47 Dakota and the Bristol Freighter. A major re-equipment programme in the 1960s saw the RNZAF acquire the A-4 Skyhawk, P-3B Orions, C-130 Hercules and UH-1 Iroquois. In the early 2000s, New Zealand ceased operating jet fighter aircraft when the Skyhawks were phased out and not replaced.

It is designed to protect the floodplain complexes of the Vyatka River, numerous lakes and coniferous- deciduous forests. The reserved is situated in the Kotelnichsky District of Kirov Oblast. The reserve was created in 1994, but has been a protected area since at least 1952 when it was organized as a beaver reserve; it covers an area of . Topography The terrain of Nurgush is typical floodplain, occupying a broad meandering section of the Vyatka River. The highest elevation is 93 meters above sea level; the typical ground level above the Vyatka is 5‚Äì6 meters. Among the lowing rolling ridges are numerous ponds, vernal pools, oxbow lakes, and other forms of wetlands, and in the river sandbars, shoals, and small sandy islands. The area floods almost completely every spring for a few days. In non-flood times, about 20% of the territory is wetland. These areas are mostly forb-grass or sedge-grass. The reserve is located entirely on the floodplain, so it does not pick cover then entire local ecosystem; the surrounding elevated terraces are mostly forested in pine or spruce, but with widespread patches of alder and birch in disturbed areas. Ecoregion and climate Nurgush is located in the Scandinavian and Russian taiga ecoregion. It is situated in Northern Europe between tundra in the north and temperate mixed forests in the south and stretches across Norway, Sweden, Finland and the northern part of European Russia. The climate of Nurgush is Humid continental climate, warm summer (K√∂ppen climate classification (Dfb)). This climate is characterized by large swings in temperature, both diurnally and seasonally, with mild summers and cold, snowy winters.. Average annual temperature in January is -13.9 C, and +18 C in July. Average annual precipitation on the reserve is 583 mm. Flora and fauna Forests cover 72% of the territory. The most common birch, aspen, alder forests and willow thickets. A quarter of the territory is covered with conifers. Scientists of the reserve and its buffer zone have observed 30 species of fish, 8 species of amphibians, 6 species of reptiles, 197 bird species (141 nesting, 38 migrating, 9 stray, 9 wandering), and 47 species of mammals. The area has been protected from commercial activity at least since 1952, when the site was organized as a beaver reserve. Ecotourism As a strict nature reserve, the Reserve is mostly closed to the general public, although scientists and those with 'environmental education' purposes can make arrangements with park management for visits. There are several 'ecotourist' routes in the reserve, however, that are open to the public, but require permits to be obtained in advance. The main office is in the city of Kirov.
