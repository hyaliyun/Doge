Enterprise Karlstad's largest employers are Wikstrom Telephone Company (Wiktel) and Mattracks. Wiktel provides internet and phone services for much of Northwestern Minnesota, including the regional telephone directory. The company has a long history in Karlstad, going back to the early 1900s. It was founded by the Wikstrom family, and many of the current employees are Wikstroms. Mattracks, however, is a newly founded company within the last 15 years, and manufactures and markets track conversion systems. Started by Glen Brazier, the rapidly growing company recently opened a new plant in China. Other than these two companies, most town businesses are locally owned and employ only a few individuals. Businesses include Hardware Hank, Germundson's Home Furnishings, Tony's Supermarket, Kim's Shear Design & Tanning, Nordisk Hemslojd, a Scandinavian gifts shop, a few restaurants and bars, and insurance and accounting services. In addition, the local community is primarily a farming one. From 1951 through 1995, the town had its own hospital. Events Every year Karlstad has the annual Kick'n Up Kountry Music Festival and Moosefest Education Karlstad has two schools: Tri-County Public Schools and Heritage Christian School. Both schools serve grades K-12. Tri-County School combines with Marshall County Central Schools of Newfolden, Minnesota, located 17 miles to the south, for all of its athletic programs.

The population was 675 at the 2010 census. Geography Kasota is about halfway between the cities of Mankato and St. Peter on the eastern side of the Minnesota River. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. The city center is about two miles north of the Kasota Prairie, designated as a Scientific and Natural Area by the state Department of Natural Resources. Minnesota State Highway 22 serves as a main route in the community. U.S. Route 169 is nearby, on the western side of the Minnesota River. History Kasota was platted in 1855. Kasota is a name derived from the Dakota language meaning \\"cleared off\\". On July 1, 1892, the Sontag Brothers, John Sontag and George Contant, and their partner in crime, Chris Evans, tried to rob a train between St. Peter and Kasota along the Minnesota River. The bandits acquired nothing of value during this holdup, but their activities came under the review of Pinkerton detectives and both were apprehended in June 1893. year. =The stone industry= The Kasota Village Hall is on the National Register of Historic Places. During the 1880s, the stone industry experienced an unexpected boom. It was during this time that C.W. Babcock took over the business from his father. He began applying modern quarrying methods, and in 1889 he formed a partnership with Tyrrell Swan Willcox, an immigrant from Rugby, England, who was instrumental in promoting the use of polished Kasota Stone for interior and exterior residential use. Much of the industry's boom was caused by the expansion of the railroads westward, requiring large quantities of stone for trestles and culverts.Don Pauley et al. Kasota, a Historical Perspective. Mankato, MN: Mankato State University Urban and Regional Studies Institute, 1976. Babcock also was the first to begin quarrying Kasota limestone in and around the city of Kasota. The Babcock Company was the chief stone company throughout the early history of the city, and according to the Kasota Historical Society the relationship between the stone company and the city was less than spectacular. At one point the Babcock Company decided to blast within the city limits. This led to the creation of the park on County Road 21 in the town center, after the company was forced to fill in the quarry near the homes of city residents. In the early 1980s, the Babcock Company went bankrupt. The Vetter Stone Company subsequently bought the Babcock quarries, further expanding the business, which currently operates just outside the Mankato city limits. The Vetters were former employees of the Babcock Company who left to start their own company in the 1950s. The former location of the Babcock Company plant in Kasota is now occupied by Door Engineering, a company manufacturing industrial doors. Currently much of the former Kasota quarry is occupied by Unimin Corporation, who mine silica sand for hydraulic fracturing (\\"fracking\\"). Kasota stone was selected as the primary stone in the building of the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, DC. as well as the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art in Indianapolis, IN =Namesakes= Kasota (Dakota for \\"a cleared place\\") was the name of a wooden Great Lakes iron ore steamer, built in 1884. The Kasota sank after colliding with the passenger steamer The City of Detroit on the Detroit River on July 18, 1890. The Kasota was salvaged and rebuilt in 1892 but sank again after springing a leak during a storm off Grand Marais, Michigan, on September 19, 1903. The USS Kasota was a naval tugboat, launched in 1944 and struck from the Navy list in 1961. It is believed that the Kasota (also known as the \\"Mighty Deuces\\") was the last wooden hull tug in the Navy at the time.

Arts and culture Downtown Montgomery during the 74th Annual Kolacky Days Festival Montgomery celebrates its Czechoslovakian heritage annually at the end of July with one of Minnesota's oldest festivals, Kolacky Days. The festival dates back to 1929, when an estimated 6,000 people visited Montgomery for the first Kolacky Day celebration, held on October 1. \\"The Kolacky Day spirit reigned supreme from early Tuesday morning until a comparatively late hour Wednesday morning. More than 1,600 of the celebrated delicacies were devoured,\\" according to a Montgomery Messenger account from the following week. Events at the first celebration included a trap shooting tournament, a parade, sports and races, and a football game between Montgomery and Le Sueur Center (now Le Center). In 1931 Miss Leatta Ehmke (later Leatta Trnka) was crowned the first Kolacky Queen by Mayor Henry Westerman. For the 1934 celebration, a novelty button, sold by the Kolacky girls, was devised and is still in use today. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Kolacky Day retreated to the background until the Montgomery Community Club revived the celebration in 1948. Kolacky Day officially became a summer festival in 1966 when the traditional date, the last Sunday in September, was dropped in favor of the first weekend in August. The earlier date and warmer weather brought huge crowds to the festival. In 1975, Kolacky Day became Kolacky Days and the event was held for the first time at the end of July. It is now celebrated on the fourth full weekend of that month.http://www.montgomery.govoffice.com/ The shift was made at the urging of the Green Giant vegetable canning company, to avoid conflict with the busy corn-processing season.

Hendricks is also home to a twenty-five-site campground near Lake Hendricks. They provide water and electric hookups as well as firewood. Hendricks boasts a remodeled creamery building that now operates as a brewery. Bank Brewing's roots lie in founder and president Jason Markkula's home, where his passion for home-brewing lagers led to the Beer For Wildlife¬Æ series of beer. Beer for Wildlife gives back a portion of the profits to wildlife land acquisitions and preservation. The name Bank Brewing was derived from the building that now houses the taproom, an old bank that sits on Main street in Hendricks. In 2014, after an extensive renovation of the building, the brewery began operation in what was previously a historic creamery building. The year also marked the introduction of the head brewer, Richard Drawdy. Richard brought a new spectrum of beer styles to the Bank Beer lineup including IPA, Black IPA and more approachable ones like Berliner Weisse and Pale Wheat. In December 2014 the Red Barn Theater was opened, attracting 230 of the 713 people of Hendricks in the opening night. Its first showing was Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb. It was the first time since 1972 that Hendricks had a theater.

In the October 25, 1873, issue, he wrote, \\"Nine months ago the first house was erected. Now there are 79 permanent buildings already constructed, and this number will be increased by others already planned.\\" Marshall became an incorporated village in 1876, and a city on February 20, 1901.

The population was 639 at the 2010 census. Old Mill State Park is nearby. History Before James J. Hill bought the Great Northern Railway in 1879 and accepted the task of completing the line from Crookston to the Canada‚ÄìUS border, a French-Canadian man founded a town named Louisa, after the French king, in the path of the railroad. However, Hill's company located the new railroad town just south of the Louisa property line and named it Argyle. The early settlement included many French-Canadians. Other settlers included immigrants from England, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Scotland, and Germany. The early townspeople and businessmen were always anxious to make Argyle an attractive community to the region. Today the community still boasts of several businesses, which draw customers from the regional area. Because of threats of flooding, a dike was built on the Middle River which is a branch of the Red River in 1988.

The population was 1,563 at the 2010 census. History Warren was platted in 1879, and named for Charles H. Warren, a railroad official. A post office has been in operation at Warren since 1880. Although several times larger than the next largest city in the county, Warren's prominence as the county seat has been threatened several times in its history. The original plan for the Soo Line Railroad (completed in 1905) branch line that passes through Warren called for it to run from Thief River Falls to Argyle and then west. Argyle interests hoped the establishment of a railroad junction there would lead to the removal of the county seat from Warren to Argyle. Other interests prevailed, although the railroad line forms a parabola extending north from Thief River Falls, and then south to Warren, as if the plan changed while the line was being built. In 1974, citizens of the eastern part of the county, noting Warren's location in the western quarter of the long county, and very nearly at its southern boundary, petitioned twice for the relocation of the county seat to Newfolden. Neither effort that year resulted in the question being put on the ballot, and in fact, voters in the interim had approved the construction of an addition to the courthouse in Warren. Warren was featured on a 2006 episode of the History Channel's UFO Files episode \\"Alien Encounters.\\" The unsolved case of a mysterious object impacting a county sheriff's car on August 27, 1979 was featured (see Val Johnson Incident). This same case was also featured in 2012 on the Travel Channel's Mysteries at the Museum episode \\"MGM Fire; UFO Car, Prophecy Sword\\" Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. The Snake River flows in serpentine fashion through the city (hence its name), and both banks are developed, which has proved problematic as the city attempts flood control. Some major floods in the city's history occurred in 1896 (twice), 1969, 1974, 1979, 1996 (twice), and 1997. The streets of the original townsite of Warren are laid out on a grid parallel and perpendicular to the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad. Some newer additions, particularly those south of Bridge Street (Minnesota Highway 1) are laid out on a conventional north-south grid. The BNSF is the dividing line for the street system east and west, and Bridge Street is the dividing line north and south.

In the rural area surrounding the city, there are three small Lutheran churches. Economy Agriculture and agribusiness have been the mainstays of Warren throughout its history. In fact, for most of its history, there has been no other industry at all. Although the Red River Valley has a short growing season, which is often made even shorter due to floods, the area has excellent crop yields which help make farming in the area less risky than in other areas with poorer soil. The principal crops are wheat, soybeans, potatoes, and sugar beets. Warren was at one time home to the largest independent elevator in Minnesota. Northwest Grain Cenex Harvest States Cooperative has a large elevator on the Soo Line, and the American Crystal Sugar Co. operates a sugar beet terminal just north of Warren during harvest. Warren has three bank branches, the largest being a branch of Community Bank of the Red River Valley, headquartered in East Grand Forks. Education and culture Warren is home of the Warren-Alvarado-Oslo school district. The district has one six-year high school and one elementary school, both located in Warren. Both buildings have been called superior facilities for a district its size. The high school, built in 1954, includes a 1000-seat auditorium. The elementary school, built in 1970, was originally an \\"open school\\" design where the classrooms were separated by chalkboard partitions rather than walls, although a few walls were installed in 1987. In the late 2000s, the school board went on to add on a new gymnasium. Warren has a public library, the Godel Memorial Library, and is home to the Marshall County Historical Society, the Marshall County Fair, and the Warren Riverside Country Club (9-hole, par 4, grass greens). Transportation The Warren City Council voted to build an airport in 1965 for an estimated cost of $109,000. A dedication ceremony took place in August 1966.

Olson, Minnesota Chief Justice Oscar Knutson, ophthalmologist Harold Scheie, founder of the Scheie Eye Institute, Capt. John J. Herrick, who led the craft fired upon in the Gulf of Tonkin incident, abstract painter Gerome Kamrowski, Civil Rights activist Joseph Steffan, and rock critic Paul Nelson. Serial killer Carl Panzram was born south of the city in rural Polk County but his connection to Warren is unknown. The former sheriff's deputy Val Johnson is known for his famed UFO encounter.

The population was 1,137 at the 2010 census. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated 2018 population is 1,093. Interstate 90 and Minnesota State Highway 4 are two of the main arterial routes in the city. In 1988, Sherburn consolidated with neighboring Trimont and Welcome schools to form the Martin County West School District. In 1999, Sherburn combined its Police Department, with nearby Welcome. The Department is currently known as the \\"Sherburn/Welcome Police Department\\". History The city of Sherburn is typical of many small communities throughout the Midwest and America, yet its history is unique in its own right. Sherburn celebrated its centennial in 1979, and since its early development in the mid to late 1800s; it has evolved over time as a result of a multitude of factors that have influenced communities of all sizes. = Early Years = In the mid-1860s, George Archer had a sod tavern on the north banks of what was then Lake Manyaska located just south of Sherburn. Marked by a lone Cedar tree, pioneer travelers used it as a rest stop as they traveled from Fairmont to Jackson. Soon there were pioneer settlers and a post office. As stage coaches from Fairmont to Jackson and St. James to Estherville crossed the area, it was concluded that there was a definite need for a settlement. The mid to late 1870s witnessed the arrival of many settlers to Martin County, primarily resulting from the growth of the railroad involving Winnebago City and Fairmont. A company called Cargill, Bassett, and Hunting from La Crosse, Wisconsin, anticipated the railroad expanding west of Fairmont and, consequently, bought land in the area. As steam locomotives took water often, stops were located every fifteen miles or so, which may have contributed the location of the Sherburn railroad station. A post office has been in operation at Sherburn since 1879. = Name = Several names were originally considered for the town site, including Lone Cedar, Huntington, and Vestal. But when the Southern Minnesota Railroad came through in October 1878, the name Sherburne was accepted in honor of Sherburne S. Merrill, General Manager of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad. With the railroad's influence on the area, Sherburn's growth by 1879 had grown to fifteen buildings with a total value of approximately $8,000.00. = Biker Bank Gang = Sherburn was not without its share of excitement in its formative years. It was the site of one of the first, and deadliest, bank robberies in Martin County's history. The Bank of Sherburn was robbed in October 1896 by two brothers. They entered the bank and without warning shot and killed two people in the bank, one being an employee. The robbers made off on bicycles with cash estimated to be between $1,000.00 and $2,000.00. Apparently not particularly observant, they failed to notice $2,000.00 in gold and silver that remained in the till. Following their escape on bicycles, they were quickly pursued by Martin County Sheriff Hill, his deputies, and a posse of local citizens. One of the robbers was soon located at a farmhouse fourteen miles east of Elmore. Although surprised by the posse, he managed to fatally shoot Bancroft, Iowa, Sheriff William Gallion. The robber, in spite of being wounded, once more attempted an escape on his bicycle. When his escape appeared fruitless, and surrendering was apparently not in the cards, he put his weapon to his head and killed himself. The second robber was soon captured without incident in Lake Mills, Iowa. He confessed to the crime of robbery, but placed the blame for the murders of the two people in the Bank of Sherburn on his brother. = Fox Lake company = In 1920 several Sherburn businessmen organized the Fox Lake Park Company issuing and selling stock to those interested in the development of the area. Much of the land along the lake was platted into lots, a dance pavilion was built, and playground equipment and picnic tables were purchased. In addition, a bath house, a diving tower, a toboggan slide, and fishing piers were also constructed. Later, a tennis court and a baseball diamond, including grandstands, were added. In 1932, the Fox Lake Golf Club was organized by ten businessmen. It started as a three-hole course, expanded to six holes, and finally became a nine-hole course. The Fox Lake Park Company was liquidated in 1944, and the dance pavilion and park area not owned by individuals was sold. The Fox Lake Golf Club purchased the land where the golf course was located. = \\"Dream Team\\" = Sherburn's history includes a dream that many communities share but few accomplish. That dream, winning a state high school athletic championship, was accomplished by the 1970 Sherburn Raiders high school basketball team during a time when only one state basketball champion was crowned. That team, coached by Dennis Christopherson, breezed through the regular season undefeated. Selected as the number one seed in District V, they defeated Fairmont, Delavan, and finally Wells for the championship. They then defeated Luverne and Jackson in Region II to reach the state tournament. In the state tournament, they first defeated Melrose 65‚Äì54, and then Marshall 71‚Äì60 to advance to the championship game. They would face heavily favored South St. Paul, a team that had been rated number one throughout most of the season. The Raiders, although much maligned by the Twin Cities media as being \\"hicks\\", went on to defeat the South St. Paul Packers by a score of 78‚Äì62.

Trimont was once two different towns, platted by competing railroads. The two towns were Triumph, to the east, and Monterey to the west. These towns joined, using the first letters in each town's name, to form what is today known as Trimont. This gives Trimont the unique characteristic of two separate Main Street business districts which are on the same street, yet placed about a half-mile apart. The yearly summer festival has been known as Town & Country Days, FunFest, and the Chocolate Festival. In 2011, the planning committee decided to go back to the name FunFest. Trimont FunFest is always held the second Saturday in July. FunFest showcases local talent for its live entertainment, along with games, sporting competitions, contests, a silent auction, a parade, a community church service, and a variety of food. The planning committee is composed entirely of volunteers and FunFest is funded by donations from area businesses, organizations, and individuals. FunFest is a family-oriented event with something for everyone. In 1988, Trimont Schools consolidated with neighboring Sherburn and Welcome to form the Martin County West (MCW) School District. The Trimont school building is now the MCW Trimont Elementary. (Grades kindergarten, 3rd - 6th grades.)

Roosevelt's Public Works Administration's program to provide employment and improve infrastructure. Hutchinson was once served by three railroads. The Electric Short Line (commonly known as the Luce Line) provided freight and interurban service between Minneapolis and Gluek via Hutchinson.

The population was 473 at the 2010 census. Cosmos was first settled by Daniel Jackman in 1867. Several others followed that first year, such as Isaac L. Layton or Leighton from Maine, Hansom W. Young from New Brunswick, and Daniel Hoyt from Massachusetts. The first two were the first farmers and they planted wheat. Hoyt suggested the name when the Township was organized on January 25, 1870. He had come in 1867 as a surveyor, and he was elected the first township clerk. He froze to death in February 1870, trying to walk on foot to the Minnesota River. Cosmos is an ancient Greek word meaning ‚Äúorder and harmony in the universe‚Äù. The city was incorporated as a village on September 21, 1926, and finally as a city in 1969. A post office was established as in Renville County in 1870, then to McLeod County in 1871, and finally, it was transferred to Meeker County in 1872. Isaac Layton was the postmaster. The post office closed in 1906 and re-opened in 1924. The town had a railway station serving several rail lines including the Minnesota and Western Railroad. The town sits along the South Fork of the Crow River. The population was 473 at the 2010 census. The banks in Meeker County starting improving their security systems in March 1925 after there was a rash of bank break-ins in Cold Spring, Prinsburg, Cosmos and Svea in 1924 and 1925. Three men made an attempt to rob the Cosmos First State Bank on Tuesday, April 21, 1924. The bandits parked out of town and walked into the sleepy little community where they got into the bank through a basement window. Before they came into town a little after one in the morning, they cut all the telephone and telegraph wires leading in and out of the town. One man was left to stand guard outside the bank. Inside the bank, the other two packed the safe with explosives and set them off. The door opened, but the thieves were confronted with an upper and a lower compartment inside. Eeny meeny, miney moe...the duo opted for ‚Äúmoe‚Äù, the lower one, which they then blew open too. Unfortunately, the bank's $5,000 in cash was in ‚Äúminey‚Äù, the upper compartment. The money had been received just the night before to pay the members of the local creamery. Do you suppose a creamery employee was involved in the attempted heist, tipping off some buddies? The noise from the first explosion aroused garage owner Emil August Hackbarth from his sleep. He lived right across the street from the bank. Apparently, Emil didn't like to be woke up. He reached for his revolver, which he conveniently kept near his bed, and went to his window facing the bank. He calmly fired off a shot. I don't know if he even saw the lookout there or not, but J. H. Jerabek, who lived a couple of houses down the street certainly did. Jerabek, the bank cashier, lit a lamp and stepped out onto his porch, where he ran into a shotgun. ‚ÄúGet back in there, or I‚Äôll blow your damned head off,‚Äù Jerabek was told. He went back in but inside he immediately grabbed his own shotgun, but he couldn't find any shells. Alerted by the lookout that the town was waking up, the two men inside the bank opened a window and climbed out. The three of them then ran off to their car and sped off, never to be seen or heard of again. Minnesota State Highways 4 (Milkyway Street) and 7 (Astro Blvd.) are the two of the main routes in the town. In keeping with the community's space theme, all streets are named after planets and all avenues are named after constellations.

The population was 327 at the 2000 census. Danielson Township was originally a part of Acton. Noah White was the first settler in 1857, but he moved to Kandiyohi County in 1858. The township was organized on March 12, 1872, and named after Nils Danielson, who settled there in 1861. (Another source says named after Nils AND his son, Daniel Nils Danielson.) Before coming to the township, Nils Danielson had been in Litchfield. Danielson came to Meeker County by covered wagon in the spring of 1857 and settled in Litchfield. In the township area, Nils had almost daily visits from the local Indians and they got along just fine. The braves had a camp by Hope Lake near where Hans Jensen lived. Chief Cut Nose (Marpiya Okinajin) used to come to Nils‚Äô farm to sharpen his hunting knife on the Danielson grindstone and whetstone. (Ex-State Senator Steve Dille owns the knife today.) Chief Cut Nose was the local chief and he had acquired the name because one of his nostrils had been bitten off or cut off in one of his numerous fights with other tribes. Nils would sharpen knives for the Indians and give them food, whenever he could spare any. It was understood then that Chief Cut Nose would not steal from Danielson and he didn't. He marked Nils‚Äô land with a yellow feather on a stake in the ground out front, meaning ‚Äúfriend‚Äù. Nels Olson alerted his neighbor Nils Danielson, who was four miles to the west of the Baker place, about the Acton Massacre. Danielson got some other settlers, they armed themselves, and they went to investigate. At the Baker farm, eighteen-year-old Hans Evenson was the first to discover the bodies. (He later did sentry duty at the Forest City Stockade.) The men buried the dead in one grave at the Ness Lutheran Church cemetery and then they went to get their families to go to Forest City for protection. While at his house gathering his possessions, Nils heard shots being fired at his neighbor Anders or Andreas Olson's place by Ellsworth. It was just fifty rods away. Sensing what was taking place and knowing that the Indians were close by, Nils gathered his wife, Ragnild, and his family and he grabbed a few possessions including a single feather mattress with ticking, which was a luxury in those days of straw beds. He rolled the mattress up, strapped it to his back, and he and his family took off into the woods, heading for Forest City. They ran and ran for their lives, never really seeing any Indians, but knowing that they were close by. When they stopped to rest, Nils took the mattress off his back and, only then, he discovered that there was an arrow sticking out of it. The mattress had saved his life. It was later discovered that Anders Olson and his entire family had been killed at their farm. Anders was shot and scalped while he was tending his cattle. At the end of the Indian War, Nils Danielson's friend Chief Cut Nose was convicted of being involved in the attack on New Ulm and he was one of the thirty-eight Indians hanged in Mankato. Nils Danielson was born in 1817 in Norway and he died in 1870.

The population was 1,469 at the 2010 census. History DASSEL In 1868, some men from the Saint Paul and Pacific Railroad were looking for land. They had chosen a route west from the Twin Cities that went right through a village named Collinwood. But the people in that village didn't want to give up or sell the land that the railroad needed for its rails, crossings, depot, etc. In frustration, the railroad men left town, redrew their route map, and moved one mile north. There they found the settlers in a place called Swan Lake more than eager to sell the land that the railroad needed. (Swan Lake Township was originally a part of Kingston and was named after a lake in the township. The first settlers were men by the names of Ayres and Richardson in 1856. They were surveyors from Mexico, New York. They left in 1862 during the Sioux Uprising and the Indians burned their cabin. After the Indian War, Isaac N. and Antone W. Russel came in 1864 or 1865. Soon a group from Kentucky came. The township became the town of Dassel.) The railroad platted out a new village in 1869, naming it Dassel, after one of their own employees, Bernard Dassel, a paymaster for the railroad, who came from a village named Dassel in the province of Einbeck, Germany. Bernard was a friend of railroad magnate James J. Hill and Hill gave Bernard the job of secretary of the St. Paul & Pacific Railroad, with a salary of $1800 a year. Parker Simons, a civil engineer for the railroad, put up the first frame building in Dassel. Bernard Dassel was put in charge of the pay car that was pulled by the Wm. Crooks Engine No. 1, which made a visit every month to Dassel with the cash for its workers. The station agent at the depot was Charles J. Atwater (who also had a town named after him), who was also postmaster with the new post office situated in the depot. When the post office was opened, it made the name Dassel official, by the way, and Dassel, with its 302 inhabitants, was incorporated as a village on March 4. 1878. The depot was on the north side of the main track until 1883, when it was moved over to the south side. Most of the early settlers of Dassel came from Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Virginia, and Sweden, especially from Vastergotland and Varmland. Adam Brower was living in Indiana when he enlisted in the Union Army in April 1861. He fought in battles at Winchester, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Cumberland, Resaca, and Altoona, where he was wounded and laid up in the hospital for a few weeks. He was taken prisoner by the Confederates in the battle of Winchester on May 25, 1862, and was kept by them until September 20, when he was exchanged for another prisoner. In February 1867, he came to Meeker County and purchased a place near Swan Lake (Dassel). For the first three years, he did brick making in the village, but then he started farming. Harlow F. Ames came to the township, with his brother Henry, in January 1868, and they settled on the farm their father, Harlow, Sr., who had bought the land in absentee. The brothers stayed there until 1869 when their parents came to claim their land. Harlow F. got his own claim and Henry moved between Darwin and Litchfield where he started his famous brickyard, the bricks of which built downtown Litchfield. George Maynard came in May 1866. He cast the first vote to incorporate the village in 1878. Andrew Davidson came to Meeker County on July 4, 1866. He drove the entire distance from Columbia County, Wisconsin with an ox team, bringing his family with him in a covered wagon. Upon his arrival, he took up a homestead of eighty acres of land on section 14. In 1866, James P. Davis came to Meeker County and took up a claim early in July on section 10. He built up his farm while working at the same time for the railroad. The next fall, he worked in the Forest City grist mill. In 1868, he helped clear the site of the village, chopping down trees, making cordwood, etc. Also in 1866, Frederick Spath came and took up a homestead of eighty acres of land in section 10, where his family lived for nine years. He worked for a while on the construction of the railroad, and on the laying out of the village of Dassel. He opened a blacksmith shop and his family moved into the town in 1875, where, on April 1, 1881, he turned the business over to his son, P. F. Spath, and then moved back to his farm. On the organization of the town in 1867, Frederick was appointed one of the town supervisors, and the following year as chairman of the board. He was also one of the first village trustees and held that office for three years consecutively. John Rudberg also came in 1866, a busy immigrant year for the town. John took up a homestead in section 26. He moved into the village in 1875 and, along with his brothers Louis and Jonas, bought into the business of Charles Morris who had the pioneer general merchandise store. It was called Morris & Rudberg Bros. and they remained in business until 1881. Then, selling out, John and brother Louis bought the Dassel lumber yard, and also started a furniture business. Louis Rudberg died in January 1884, and John operated the entire business from that time on. Madison DeLong came in 1867 and took up a claim on section 34. He became the town supervisor for eight years, and also an assessor for four. Henry Clay came to Dassel with his parents in the spring of 1868 and he settled on section 28. After serving in the Civil War, Henry came back home to take up his own claim on section 32. He started working for the St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba Railroad Company, building snow fences. In December 1887, he moved into town, and, on May 1, 1887, he took possession of the post office, having been appointed to that position. Erick W. Nelson came with his parents in 1868, when he was 12. After his parents died, he left the farm and came to the village to work as a clerk in a store until May 1886, when he embarked in the saloon business with N. J. Lind. A. A. Sanford was the sheriff in 1869 when Ralph Peters built a hotel which was run by him until the Dassel House was built in 1872 by George Brower. Brower was the hotel's landlord until 1873 when he sold the property to Samuel A. Bunting. James H. Morris came in March 1869 and he built a sawmill. The sawmill was sold to George Brower, William Bradford, and James Wilson in 1872. The mill operated until 1875 when it was destroyed by a fire. In 1876, it was rebuilt and continued in operation until August 5, 1881, when a small tornado came and wrecked it for good. It went out of business. In the time that it stood, it was owned by Joel B. Smith, the first Dassel President of the Council (Mayor), and also by Robert Hunter and Ruland T. Elliott. The first general store was opened by James H. Morris and his brother Charles A. in 1869. They operated it until 1872 when they sold out to Samuel A. Bunting. In 1873, it was destroyed by fire with no insurance. It was promptly rebuilt by Bunting and he was again in business, but he died on July 27, 1875, at the age of 43. After Sam Bunting died in 1875, his widow operated the hotel until 1877, when John Henry ‚ÄúHank‚Äù Remick became its landlord. On February 3, 1883, it was destroyed again, together with some other buildings in Block 7. This was Dassel's first big fire. Ray F. Case came near to losing his life. He was wedged in between the Dassel House, which was on fire, and a small office building, which was getting ready to be moved out on rollers. But it slipped off and Ray was stuck between the buildings. L. A. Whittemore, Jack Riordan, and Ben Records got a rope around him and he was hauled out, badly bruised and burned, but saved. A new Dassel House was then built by ‚ÄúHank‚Äù Remick, William Galiger, and John S. Larson. After it was completed, Larson sold his interest in the hotel. Dassel's first schoolhouse was built in 1870, at a cost of $625 and with only three months of school beginning on October 15, with Mrs. W. C. Russell as the teacher. She had 28 pupils and a salary of $25 a month. In 1873, Sarah Phelan became the teacher at $30 a month with a four months school term and 44 students. Dassel, at that time, had just 227 citizens. In 1878, a new $1500 two-story building was built with two rooms, one up and one down, and in 1883 the downstairs was divided into two rooms. The old schoolhouse was sold to the Swedish Lutheran Church and used by them until 1886 when a new church was built. The old schoolhouse church was sold and made into a house. The new school building was in use until 1886 when an $8000 building was built. The old schoolhouse was then sold to the Village on April 8. 1887 for $300 and moved to Lot 17 in Block 8, where it was used as a Village Hall and the Firehouse until 1912 when it was sold for $147, torn down, and the lumber hauled away by the owner. The Auditorium was built in that year and in use until February 24, 1930, when it was destroyed by fire. A semi-fire proof municipal building was built in the same year. The first principal of schools was J. H. McKenney. Dr. C. A. McCollum was Dassel's first physician and surgeon, coming in 1871. He also was the village recorder for several years and county commissioner from 1878 to 1880. On December 1, 1887, he sold his practice to Dr. J. H. Kauffman for $250. Dr. Kauffman also was the owner of the McCoy Drug Store. Other Dassel doctors were: Dr. H. E. Cassel, who came on February 1, 1889, and in 1891 moved to Cokato, Dr. George E. Sherwood, who came in 1894, but, in 1900, he moved to Kimball, Dr. E. A. Skaro came in 1886 and practiced for two years, then moved to Minneapolis, Dr. Wm. E. Tryon came in 1900 for three years, then left for Minneapolis also, Dr. M. Kranz came in 1902, but stayed for only three months, then moved to Saint Paul, Dr. G. J. Dahlquist came in 1903, staying until 1904 when he moved to North Dakota, and Dr. A. C. Peterson, in 1905. In 1872, the Pioneer Drug Store was opened by Louis Rudberg and Charles A. Morris. In 1875 Rudberg sold his half of the store to Morris and, in 1880, Morris sold out to Dr. C. A. McCollom and George B. Breed. They sold the store to the Rudberg Brothers in 1883. On his way to Sweden for a vacation in 1885, Jonas J. Rudberg died in Philadelphia on February 8, age 42, and the business was then sold to Ray F. Case, who was the store's druggist. He operated it until he sold out to McCoy & Co. in 1898, who had started the second store of this kind in 1894. Then it became the W. J. Busch Drug Store. Edwin F. Proctor took up a homestead on section 4, in the month of May 1869. He had been in the Civil War, and, under General William Tecumseh Sherman, he was present with the regiment that fought around and burned Atlanta, and in the subsequent March to the Sea. Edwin participated in fourteen battles in all and was only slightly wounded in two of them, at Chancellorsville and at Antietam. The railroad was completed to Dassel on July 4, 1869, and a celebration was held to honor the event. A few more buildings were put up that year. In 1870, the real boom started. Store buildings, many houses, and a schoolhouse were built, some of the houses are still in use. Jonas Rudberg, brother of John and Louis mentioned before, came in 1869 and lived on his brother John's farm. In 1872, Jonas moved into town and opened a drug store, which he ran until his death in February 1885. James Patterson came in 1870. Peter Anderson had a son, Elias L., who was born in Dassel on July 1, 1870. After working for the railroad as a carpenter, Louis Rudberg, brother of John and Jonas, came in 1872, and he joined John in the mercantile business until his death in January 1884. In 1876, he was elected a member of the Minnesota State Legislature and served one term. Luther W. Leighton came in the fall of 1872 and, in the spring of 1874, he opened the first wagon making shop in town. He continued with that until 1881 when he entered into the hardware business with John M. Johnson until January 1, 1887, when, after selling his interest to his partner, he entered into the new co-partnership in the firm of Osterlund & Leighton, a general merchandise store. Mickel Hendrickson, in 1872, started the construction of a building for a store, but he died just before it was completed. He was in partnership with John Rudberg owning a threshing machine driven by oxen. In threshing on his own farm, he accidentally stepped into the cylinder of the machine while it was in motion, which caused his death before a doctor could get to him. On June 12, 1873, a swarm of Rocky Mountain Locust, not grasshoppers as often mistakenly reported, invaded the central and southwestern parts of Minnesota. They came in swarms so huge that they blocked out the sun, sounding like a rainstorm. The ‚Äúgrasshoppers‚Äù became so thick on the railroad tracks that it took three hours to go just the five miles from Darwin to Dassel. On October 15, 1873, O. H. Sundahl, and Louis and Jonas J. Rudberg opened a general store in the Hendrickson building. On May 1, 1874, Charles. A. Morris bought O. H. Sundahl's share in the business and, on November 10, 1875, the firm purchased the Samuel A. Bunting store from his heirs and combined it with their business. William Wallace was an early photographer in Dassel with tin-types, which were the only pictures they had back then. His photo gallery was opened for business in 1873. After business hours, William would entertain his customers with his violin playing. Ray F. Case came in 1873 with his parents, but following their deaths, he moved to town in 1883 and worked in a drug store with Charles A. Morris, until Morris sold out to Dr. McCullom. Jonas Rudberg bought it from McCullom. Ray still worked there until Rudberg died. Then he and Jonas‚Äô widow formed a co-partnership to carry on the business. In 1886, McCullom bought out Mrs. Rudberg. Luther W. Leighton was the pioneer wagon maker and repairman in Dassel, opening a shop on May 1, 1874, with a horse tread power running his machine. In 1882, he started a hardware store with John M. Johnson as his partner in the same location. On January 1, 1887, he sold out his interest in the firm of Leighton and Johnson. He then went into partnership with Louis Osterlund in the general merchandise business, the store being known as Osterlund and Leighton. In 1890, this partnership was dissolved and the stock of merchandise divided into equal parts and each of them opened a store of his own. Leighton's store was destroyed by fire in 1894 and he then opened a new general merchandise store in a larger building east of his former location. In 1898, he sold out to the Murphy Brothers. In 1901, they built a two-story brick building, 40√ó110, on the corner of Atlantic Avenue and Fourth Street. The main floor was used for their store, the second floor was used for other rooms and apartments. The building was destroyed by fire on October 11, 1919. Louis Osterlund, after operating his store for twenty years, sold out to Andrew Olson & Co. in 1911 and retired from business. John Osborn started the first lumber yard in 1874 and then, in 1881, he sold out to John, Jonas J., and Louis Rudberg, who added furniture and undertaking to the business. Oscar E. Lindquist was born in Dassel in 1874. In 1896, at the age of only 22, Oscar became the town's postmaster. O. H. Sundahl started a feed mill in 1875, Ed Lewis started one in 1891, and G. B. Waller started one in 1897. James B. Lewis & Co. established a woolen mill in 1876, which burned down in 1880. A stock company was then formed, the mill was rebuilt and started business again under the name of the Dassel Woolen Mills, with Horace P. Breed and Daniel Methven as its managers. They manufactured all kinds of woolen goods, and the famous ‚ÄúSvenskt Wadmal‚Äù, wool fabric that is both warm and water-resistant. In 1876, Erick Rundquist became a blacksmith in Dassel and two years later he sold half interest in the shop to John M. Johnson. This partnership continued until 1880 when Johnson bought the other half from Rundquist. In 1882, when the firm of Leighton & Johnson opened their hardware store, the blacksmith shop was discontinued. Dassel's pioneer tailor was M. Chellin who operated a tailor shop in 1877 and ran it until his death in 1880. In 1881, Peter Westlin entered that line of business and operated a shop until he passed away in 1883. Peter Norden came to Dassel in 1883 and opened up his tailor shop. Olof Johnson and N. A. Skoog came in 1889 and also opened a tailor shop. Dassel's pioneer lawyer was W. L. Van Eman, who opened a law office in 1877 and, in 1881, he was succeeded by Douglas Martin until 1885 when he moved to Arizona. A. B. Bunting of Minneapolis came in 1887 but went back in 1889 because of a lack of business. Ed R. Heenan went into the law business in Dassel in 1904, he stayed a year then moved to North Dakota. The first butcher shop was started in 1876 by J. H. Mclntyre, who stayed in that line of business until 1882 when he sold out to Joseph E. Foster. Mclntyre then became an auctioneer, hoop-pole buyer, and the village constable. In 1888, Foster sold his meat market to Francis Marion Boyer, who went by the name Marion. Other owners of meat markets in the early days of Dassel were: John McCollom, Robert Edminster, Jonas Carlson, J. M. Mattson, Wm. R. Benson, O. M. Mattson, Olson & Paul, Joseph Paul, E. J. Sangren, and Aleck Lundquist. Back then, a butcher shop had its own slaughterhouse located just outside the village limits, so almost everything sold was a home product except for pickled pig's feet, tripe, oysters, lutefisk and herring. After working for the railroad, John Vogel came to Dassel in 1877 and settled on a farm in section 20. Samuel O. Lindgren came in November 1879 and he attended school until spring when he started working in August Sallberg's store as a clerk. After two years, John went to Minneapolis to work for a while. Then in the summer of 1883, he returned to Dassel and formed a partnership with John Thompson. The following September, they opened a general merchandise store in a building that they had just built. They operated it for four years, then they sold it to the Rudberg Brothers. In 1890, the Rudbergs sold an interest in it to Louis Palmersten of Stillwater, who remained a member of the firm of Rudbergs & Palmersten until 1895, when Nels Rudberg bought out Peter Rudberg and Louis Palmersten, and the partnership was dissolved. Palmersten opened a store of his own and Peter Rudberg bought the hardware store of John Clarquist. Later Charles Olson became a partner with Palmersten under the firm name of Palmersten & Olson. In 1890 Charles sold out his interest in the company and then established a new store known as Andrew Olson & Co. A few years later, Charles sold his share of the business to his brother, Joseph, who became the general manager of this store. John Norgren & Company, dealers in general merchandise, came to the village in the spring of 1875 and established their business. The ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù was his blind son-in-law, J. O. Berlin. The last ten years of business, it was owned by J. W. and L. M. Norgren. In 1878, Richard Elliot, a Civil War veteran, traded his farm elsewhere for an interest in the steam sawmill in Dassel. Two years later, he sold his mill interests and built a hotel, which, for a time, was leased out. In 1881, he took charge of the hotel himself. At the same time, he started buying and shipping hoop poles and cordwood. D. Winck started a shoemaker shop in Dassel in 1877 in which he worked for fifteen years, then he retired in 1891 and moved to California. John Henry ‚ÄúHank‚Äù Remick came in 1877 and started running the Dassel House hotel, until 1882. During the summer of that year, he engaged in his old trade of being a blacksmith, but on January 1, 1883, he went into the saloon business with John S. Larson. The following February, their place was destroyed by fire. In partnership with John S. Larson and William Gallagher, Remick then built a new hotel, the new Dassel House, the old one having burned down also. On the completion of the hotel, which was of brick and cost some $4,500, Remick again opened another saloon and remained in that business until 1886, when he closed it out. James H. McKenney came in 1878 to be the principal of the village schools for two years. In the fall of 1880, he bought an interest in the Dassel elevator and took charge of it. The Dassel Brass Band was organized in 1878 with the following members: W. L. VanEman; Director; Louis Rudberg. John S. Larson. Nels Chelgren. Douglas Martin, Jonas J. Rudberg. Oliver Bacon. Charles H. Morris, H. L. Babst, J. W. Norgren, George Norton, John E. Bunker, and Guy Breed. In October 1880, August Sallberg purchased the general store of the Rudberg Brothers and moved to Dassel taking charge of the business. In February 1883, the building was destroyed by fire, and he immediately put up a brick building. He moved into it on September 5 of that year. John H. Wallace was the first drayman in 1878, with his white horses. A dray was a low, flatbed wagon without sides, pulled generally by horses or mules. It was used for the moving and delivery of all kinds of goods. He sold out to Charles Penney in 1889. Charles ran the dray business until 1893 when William R. Benson bought the business from him. He sold the dray line to Nip DeLong in 1894. (Nip DeLong was the first white child born in Dassel on August 16, 1869.) The Peterson Brothers started a new dray business in 1902 and two years later bought out Nip. In 1906, Ed. Hardy bought out the Peterson Brothers, operating the dray for a year, then selling the business to Nip DeLong again. Nip ran the dray line until 1917 when he sold out to the Isaacson Brothers. The first livery stable was started in 1879 by John Henry ‚ÄúHank‚Äù Remick. Hank managed it until 1894 when a new stable was built on Lots 13 and 14 in Block 7. In its years of business, it had many owners: Lafayette N. Gates. A. L. Jones. A. E. Ansell, Elliott & Huntley, W. R. Benson, R. T. Elliott & Son, and Fred Collier. The first jewelry store in Dassel was owned by O. H. Sundahl in 1879 and he continued in that business until 1887 when he moved to California. August Swanson then opened a shop which he operated until 1891 when he moved to Los Angeles. Other jewelers in the early days were E. J. Iverson, R. G. Scott, August Skoog, and John Gevart. Mrs. J. H. Mclntyre started a millinery (hat) store in 1879, which she sold to Mrs. John M. Johnson in 1884. Mrs. O. B. Knapp started a second store in 1894. Later on, general stores put in millinery departments and then those small stores went out of business. Dassel's first policeman was Henry Adlerbjelke, who was appointed to the job on January 1, 1880, by H. P. Breed, President of the Council (Mayor). William Porter started a wagon, carriage, and repair shop in 1880. He was in that work until 1884, when he moved to Brandon, Minnesota. Henry L. Babst opened the first hardware store of Dassel in the Andrew Linquist building in 1880 and, in 1882, he sold out to A. M. Bell. Bell ran the establishment until 1886 when he sold it to Bartholomew & Co. They then sold the store to William Galiger and William S. Cox, the business being known as Galiger & Cox. In 1889, Cox sold his interest to Galiger, who became its sole owner. In 1882, L. W. Leighton and John M. Johnson started a second hardware store, the partnership lasting until 1887 when Johnson became the owner of this business. In 1891, Johnson sold out to John Clarquist. Peter Rudberg bought the store in 1895 and operated it until 1900, when the fire of January 12 destroyed it and all the other business places on Atlantic Avenue in Block Eight. The lot was then sold to S. N. Gayner & Co. They built a brick building for a new hardware store. The first fire fighting organization was established in 1881. On July 25, a petition signed by twelve voters was presented to the Council, proposing that the signers of the said petition might be known as the Dassel Hook & Ladder Fire Company, and on a motion, the following was passed: ‚ÄúResolved, that J.

McIntyre to be known as the Dassel Hook & Ladder Fire Company, and be entitled to all the benefits and subject to any penalties as such to the statutes made and provided.‚Äù They were equipped with two dozen rubber buckets, two fire axes, and one hook and ladder truck with ladders. After the town's big fire of February 3, 1883, the village bought a Rumsey Hand Engine and a hose cart with 628 feet of hose for $1560. A fire bell was bought on August 5, 1884, at a weight of 450 pounds, and a cost of $90.81. On May 2, 1884, the Dassel Fire Department was organized and called Engine Company No. 1. Dingman & Co. started a brickyard in the west end of Dassel in 1881, which was in operation until 1885. Some of the older buildings in town have Dassel brick in them. Marion Boyer, a Civil War veteran, worked at a meat market and ran a dray business in Dassel in 1881. William S. Cox did railroad work until 1881 when he purchased a farm on section 33, Dassel Township, where he farmed until 1885. He moved into town in January 1886, and for a year was a member of the firm of Johnson & Cox, dealers in agricultural implements, until January 1887. Then he was elected city marshal, but in August he resigned and started working for the Minnesota & Dakota Elevator Co. Louis Rudberg and Nels Erickson established a firm under the name of Nels Erickson & Co. in 1881, and built a building en the southeast corner of Block 8, but before it was completed a tornado struck Dassel and ripped off the second story of the building. It was then converted into a one-story building. They opened their general store on November 1, 1881. The post office was located there with Louis Rudberg as its postmaster, who was Meeker County's member of the Legislature in 1876, and County Commissioner in 1877. Lewis Osterlund came from Sweden in 1881, and in March 1882, Lewis worked in the post office as a clerk, under Louis Rudberg, the postmaster and in Rudberg's store there. On January 1, 1883, he was appointed postmaster. Peter Wicklund bought an interest in the store and became a member of the firm on December 1, 1882. The store was operated for three years and, with a big closing out sale, it went out of business. The building was then used for Dassel's roller skating rink. Roller skating had become a nationwide craze in 1885. The one in Dassel was owned by John E. Bunker. It was 48 laps around for a mile. 50 and 100-mile races were held monthly for cash prizes. World-famous skaters gave exhibitions of trick and fancy skating there. In 1887, the property was sold to J. Norgren & Co. and used by them in the general merchandise business until it was destroyed in the big fire of January 12, 1900. Lewis occupied the postmaster position until May 1, 1887, after which the firm of Osterlund & Leighton was formed and their general store was opened. Olof Olson and his family arrived from Sweden in 1882 and Olson opened a blacksmith shop. Herman Quady had the first confectionery and lunchroom in Dassel, opening it for business on October 1, 1882. In the early days of Dassel, John E. Bunker, the Remick Brothers, the Spath Brothers, Moon & Edminster, Louis Boyer & Edminster, and Charles B. Dunn were at various periods in the confectionery line of business. Many times, the postmasters carried a stock of confectionery because their compensation as the village postmaster was too low to make a living. Wreisner & Mattson established their business as machinists, blacksmiths, and wagon makers in 1883, but on October 20, 1887, the place was destroyed by fire with no insurance. The firm of Wreisner and Mattson was succeeded by the Wreisner Brothers, and then the Wreisner Brothers & Sons, at the same location, with a garage, machine shop, and oil station. The Dassel Manufacturing Co. was doing business in 1883 with a plant, a foundry, and a machine shop, with fifteen employees. In the Dassel News-Letter of March 13, 1884, their advertisement appeared as follows: ‚ÄúDassel Manufacturing Co., Founders, Machinists‚Äô, Blacksmiths and Woodworkers. Owners of mills, factories, elevators, and steam engines will find it to their interest to leave their orders for new work or repairs with the Dassel Manufacturing Co., manufacturers of all kinds of patterns and castings, experimental and practical machinery forgings, iron and steel, woodturning and scroll sawing. Persons having complicated inventions on their brains, difficult of clearing out will generally find ready help in times of need as we have had a long experience in such cases. We make drawings, specifications and anything in connection with our business.‚Äù However, the business failed and the property was sold to Erick Hagelin who converted it to a flour and feed mill in 1885 which he operated with success until 1912 when it was discontinued. At the death of Louis Rudberg on January 10, 1884, and Jonas J. Rudberg in 1885, John Rudberg paid off their heirs and continued the business until 1896, when he retired and sold out to B. Bresden with L. E. Larson as its manager. In a few years, it was bought by Larson Brothers. Farm machinery, wagons, buggies, and bicycles were also sold. On April 1, 1882, a barbershop was started by E. F. Soule, but after two years it went out of business. In 1889, a shop was opened by Thomas Jefferson, a black barber with the only black family that ever lived in Dassel. In 1891, he sold his business to Ed Jumer and in 1893 the shop was sold to Charles Robison. B. B. Bartlett opened a barbershop in 1893 which was destroyed by fire in 1894 at the same time Leighton's store burned down. Bartlett then moved to Hackensack. Robert N. Doucette went into the barber business in 1896, but three years later he moved to Cokato. In those days, shaves were 10 cents and haircuts 25 cents. Back then, no person of any standing shaved himself. He had a brush and a mug with his name and lodge or business engraved on it, resting on a pigeonhole cabinet on the wall in the barbershop. In 1885, J. J. Sundquist of Norwood moved to Dassel, built a store building, and put in a stock of drugs. In a few months, he disposed of the drugs and opened a small general store with a photograph gallery. He sold the store and then operated the gallery by itself for many years. Tin-types were now a thing of the past and Sundquist did regular photographs. The first harness shop in Dassel was started by Theodore A. Pramhus in 1885, and later on, he sold out to M. Halvorson. In 1891, Halvorson sold the business to John Sandell. John ran it until 1894 when he closed it out. The stock and tools were sold to Frank Rudberg who opened a shop which he operated until 1901 when he sold out to the Brown Hardware Co. Frank worked for them. Later on, he did the same work in the hardware store of Fred Rudberg and then for many years with S. N. Gayner & Company and the Gayner Brothers. Peter Johnson opened the second lumber yard of Dassel in 1885 and he sold it to John Rudberg in 1887. The Grand Hotel was built by Peter in 1887 and its first landlord was Edward Taylor. It was destroyed by fire in 1903 and not rebuilt. In the spring of 1885, John J. Sundquist came to town and purchased ten acres of ground adjoining the townsite, where he put up his residence. Later the same season, he purchased some town lots and put up a brick store building. In the summer of 1886, Sundquist put in a stock of drugs and notions and later added clothing, boots, and shoes. In connection with that business, he carried on a photographic art gallery in the second story of his building. A sawmill was built by John Norgren & Johnson in 1885. In August 1886, Harry Herbert Hines came to Dassel and took over the Minnesota and Dakota elevator. In 1886, John Osterman started a tin-shop on Second Street. He sold this business in 1889 to the Swanberg Brothers, who then added a full line of hardware and in 1891 they sold out to Peterson & Wickstrom. In 1901, the Brown Hardware Co., with C. D. Brown as its manager, opened a hardware store which they sold to Fred Rudberg in 1903, who operated it in connection with his furniture and undertaking business until his death on June 29, 1905. Then it became the Holm Brothers store. Pehr Ekstrom, ex-lawman, came in 1886 and partnered with Peter Johnson of Litchfield in the real estate business. In 1886, Peter Johnson built the Swedish Tile Stove Works in Dassel, the only one of its kind in the country. An exhibit of his stoves was made at the Minneapolis Industrial Exposition in 1886 and 1887. They were called Kakslungs, but they could not compete with the American stoves because of their high cost, so after a few years, the plant went out of business. Charles H. Nash established a cigar factory in 1887, which he operated until 1889 when he sold out to Charles L. Phifer. Phifer continued until 1905 when he discontinued cigar making and retired. His most popular and best-selling cigar was called the ‚ÄúGold Leaf‚Äù. Dassel's baseball club had the champion team of central Minnesota in 1887 and 1903. The team of 1887 consisted of Watson, the catcher; Herkimer, the pitcher; O. Nash, first base; G. Nash, second base; McNulty, third base; Miller, short-stop; Kearns, left field; C. H. Nash, center field; and Ben Records, right field. The batter, in 1887, had four strikes and five balls, and fouls were just fouls and not strikes, so they didn't count as anything. Dassel's baseball line-up of 1903 was as follows: Lee Wright, catcher; Tom Riffe, the pitcher; Louis Boyer, first base; Arthur Nelson, second base; Charles Gibney, third base; William A. Linquist, shortstop; Albert Colberg, left field; Charles W. Henke, center field; and Fred F. Spath, right field. M. A. Scheldrup opened the Lion Drug Store in 1887, selling out to Anton Heedles in 1889, who operated the store until 1891, then moved it to Minneapolis. In 1891, Ben A. Records resigned his position as the village marshal and opened a confectionery and lunchroom which he sold to E. Braun, Jr., in 1893. In 1894, Records bought back his former place of business. R. C. Trudgen started a drug store in Dassel in 1900, which he kept going for two years, when he moved the stock to Shell Lake, Wisconsin. Peterson Brothers opened a drug store in 1905. In January 1887, Dr. John H. Kauffman came to Dassel from Virginia. Andrew Swanberg opened a lumberyard in 1889 and he sold it to John Rudberg in 1891. On July 4, 1891, Charles L. Phifer held a popularity contest to select the four best-liked citizens of the village. The Meeker Co. Cigar Factory then placed a new cigar on the market with the picture of Ben A. Records, Louis M. Norgren, John H. Kauffman, and John Riordan on the box lid which soon proved to be their best seller. They were the four highest in this contest. Fred Rudberg entered the lumber business in 1902 but sold out to Larson Brothers in 1903. In 1893, the Dassel Anchor newspaper began publishing. On October 10, 1896, the people of Dassel gathered at the depot expecting to hear William Jennings Bryan make a speech, but his Great Northern engine No. 131 train went straight through at sixty miles an hour, killing one man, and scattering the citizens in all directions. In 1897, Campion & Wolfenden had a portable gallery (a tent) and he specialized in outside views. They enjoyed a good business for two years, then moved to another location. Iverson & Co. started a lumber yard in 1902 and sold it to Herman Manthei in 1910. Then it was run by W. J. Manthei, under the firm name of Manthei & Manthei. In 1897, Dassel had a race-track called the Dassel Driving Park, three laps to the mile, which was in use for bicycle and horse races for several years. The coming of the automobile seemed to lessen the interest in those sports so, in the course of time, it was discontinued. The track was then used as the fairgrounds and for baseball and football games. In 1898, Ray F. Case sold his drug business to Dr. John H. Kauffman, who combined it with his Ada McCoy & Co. store. Dassel's first commercial telephone line was built in 1898 from the Dassel Post Office to the Murphy Brothers store in Kingston. You could talk as long as you wanted to for only a dime. Later on, it was connected with the local telephone exchange. The Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. reached Dassel in 1900, the long-distance booth was located in the Dassel Anchor Printing Office. Then the Tri-State Telephone & Telegraph Co. line came in and consolidated with the Northwestern Bell. The Dassel and Collinwood Telephone Co. started a business with an exchange covering the village and adjoining country. In 1898, William A. Linquist established a jewelry, bicycle, and hardware store and was in that line of business until 1904 when he sold out to L. B. Wheeler. John M. Johnson opened a hardware store in 1900, which was destroyed by fire in the fall of that year. In 1900, Erick Hagelin, William A. Linquist, Charles S. Linquist, Minnie B. Linquist, and Oscar E. Linquist built a two-story building, 80√ó116, on the corner of Atlantic Avenue and Third Street. After its completion, it was occupied by the Dassel Post Office, Charles Robison's Barber Shop, William A. Linquist's Hardware, Jewelry and Bicycle Store, Norgren Brothers General Merchandise, and Olson & Co. General Merchandise. On the second floor was O. E. Linquist's living quarters, Ben A. Record's room, D. E. Murphy and Axel Nelson's two apartments, Dr. John H. Kauffman's offices, the Dassel Anchor's Printing Office, the Dassel & Collinwood Telephone Co., the A. O. U. W. Hall, and the Dassel Opera House. In the basement, was Boyer & Edminster's Bowling Alley. The building was destroyed by fire on September 12, 1931. Fred Rudberg owned Dassel's first automobile in 1904. It was a Rambler, named after a bicycle of the same name. Then it became the Nash. . The Mushroom Building, on the north side of Highway 12, was formerly a gas station. It is now a Dassel landmark and during the summer, June through August, there is entertainment at that site one evening each week. A few years ago, I performed there. Each year on Labor Day weekend, Dassel is busy with Red Rooster Days, a tradition that originated in 1959. The Universal Laboratories Building at Dassel is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. There's a wonderful place for disabled adults to work at in Dassel. It's called Red Rooster and my Down Syndrome daughter, Christine, works there every day. They are also involved with the Again and Again thrift store on Highway 12.

The population was 869 at the 2000 census. Forest Prairie Township was given that name for the forests and prairies within its borders. It is just north of Forest City, south of Watkins, and by Clear Lake. It was first settled in the spring of 1866 by Merritt Birdsall Case, Charles T. Groot, J. S. Reynolds, George Scrivner, George Smith, James W. Polk, Seymour Stevens, and Michael A. Roach. The township was organized on June 10, 1867. The first postmaster was H. M. Storrs in 1867.

In a skirmish with the rebel soldiers at the Battle of First Bull Run, Virginia, McKune, while rallying his troops for a charge, was shot in the chest and killed. Merritt Case was injured receiving a ‚Äúgunshot wound of right heel.

The population was 726 at the 2000 census. Greenleaf is an unincorporated community in Meeker County near Litchfield and Cedar Mills. The community is located along Meeker County Road 18 near State Highway 22. The first settlers in the area were three brothers: William, Herman, and Charles Kruger. Then two men, by the names of Isaac Orcutt and UNK Pratt broke sod on their claimed land in 1856. They had just plowed 3 acres when they took a break to eat in their lean-to shed. While they were eating, some Indians killed one of their two oxen team, so they couldn‚Äôt plow anymore. Discouraged, they gave up, left their claims and went to Forest City. Greenleaf was founded in 1858 by William Henry Greenleaf, Dana E. King, and Bennet M. and Judson A. Brink. The McGannons, Henry and John, also came in 1858. Greenleaf was platted on August 27, 1859 by William Greenleaf, who had come to Minnesota in 1858, and the township was named for or by him. When Greenleaf arrived, he immediately built a mill dam to power his flour and saw mills. Nearby Lake Willie was named after U. S. Willie, a lawyer who lived a year or two in Forest City and died there. A post office was established in Greenleaf in 1860 and he was legally appointed postmaster in 1861 and 1864. The post office remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1906. Greenleaf Lake was also named for William. Greenleaf was located within Ellsworth Township and Greenleaf Township. Ellsworth was named at the suggestion of Indian Uprising hero and the first ‚Äúmayor‚Äù of Litchfield, Jesse V. Branham, Jr., who came to the area in 1857 along with George C. Whitcomb. Col. Elmer E. Ellsworth was the first Union officer killed in the Civil War in Alexandria, Virginia. He was a friend of Lincoln and when Lincon heard of Ellsworth‚Äôs death, he said, ‚ÄúMy boy! My boy! Was it necessary this sacrifice should be made?‚Äù Lincoln had Ellsworth‚Äôs body brought to the White House to lay in state. Ellsworth Township was first settled in 1856 by Dr. Vincent P. Kennedy in June, Thadden R. Webb in July, and Dr. Russell Whiteman. The first child born was named George R. Whiteman, and he was born to Dr. Whiteman in 1857. The second births were twin boys, Frankie and Frederick, to William H. Greenleaf and his wife Maria in June 1860. The two boys were stillborn. The second death (actually third?) was a man named Halstead in 1862. The first schoolhouse was built in 1859, and the first teacher was 16 years old Lydia B. Angier. The first lawyer was Mark Warren, who came to Rice City in about 1860. Ellsworth was originally attached to Rice City in 1858, before it was organized as a separate township on September 1, 1868. The first sermon preached in Greenleaf was by Rev. J. C. Whitney, a Presbyterian minister. The U.S. Land Office was in Forest City, but in 1866, it was moved to Greenleaf. There, it was run by William Henry Greenleaf. The land office was moved, but not the building, so Greenleaf had to find a room for it. Colonel Jacob M. Howard, Jr., who was an important man in Litchfield‚Äôs history, came to Meeker County in 1867. The Civil War veteran bought a farm in Greenleaf. Still keeping his farm in Greenleaf, Jacob moved to the three-year-old village of Litchfield in 1872. He then built the first independent elevator in town on the railroad line. He bought and shipped grain but wanted to do more. Jacob sold the Greenleaf farm in 1879 so he would have the $19,000 he needed to build the grand Howard House hotel at the corner of North Sibley and Depot Street West, which everyone always knew as the Litchfield Hotel. Col. Howard never ran the hotel. He always leased it out, but he could be found ‚Äúholding court‚Äù many a day in the basement tavern. William Henry Greenleaf was born in Allegheny, New York, on December 7, 1834, and he was the son of William and Elmira (Sanford) Greenleaf. When he was eight years old, in 1843, he moved with his parents to Jefferson County, Wisconsin, and they settled on a farm. When William had grown to seventeen, he attended school at the Fort Atkinson Academy studying civil engineering. In 1856, during the troubles in Kansas, he made a trip to that territory with a group of men raised by a Professor Daniels, for the assistance of the Free Soilers. Greenleaf returned to Wisconsin, where, in 1857, he was employed as a surveyor on the Wisconsin Central railroad. In the spring of 1858, he came to Meeker County and located upon section 30, Ellsworth Township. He also took up a homestead on section 25, in what became Greenleaf Township. On September 27, 1859, he married Cordelia J. DeLong (1837-1928), the daughter of Hiram and Maria DeLong. Maria was a niece of the revolutionary general, Ethan Allen. William and Maria had four children: Charles Albert, born on October 27, 1861, married Hattie D. Campbell, and died in 1937; Jessie A., who married H. S. Branham, then a man named Meyer, she died in 1925; and twin boys, Frankie and Fred, who died in childbirth in June 1860. While a resident of Greenleaf Township, William was awakened at four in the morning of August 18, 1862, and was told of the Acton Massacre. He took his wife and ten-months-old child to St. Paul for safety and then he went to Hutchinson, where he helped defend the stockade against the Indians. He stayed there that fall. He then went to Minneapolis, where he made his home until March 1864, and then returned to Meeker County. In the spring of 1870, he moved to Litchfield and he had a general store at 229 North Sibley. It was in a thirty-two by fifty-foot two- storied building, costing $1700 to build. Greenleaf sold it to B. L. Perry and Company in the fall of 1870. In the fall of 1870, Greenleaf was elected to be a representative in the State Legislature. In 1871, he represented Kandiyohi, McLeod, Meeker, Monongalia (defunct), and Wright counties. From 1872 to 1882, he represented only Meeker County. In April 1871, Judge John M. Waldron and Capt. James Clinton Braden sold their general store business at 310 North Sibley to L. S. Weymouth and Greenleaf. Weymouth sold his interest in the grocery business to a man named LaCross in August 1871. Greenleaf eventually bought out LaCross and changed the store over to a hardware store. In 1874, he was appointed receiver of the United States Land office in Litchfield and continued in that office, having been reappointed in 1878, until 1879, when he resigned. In August 1874, Rosa Mary Stanton put a new building on the front of the lot at 242-244 North Sibley and William Henry Greenleaf rented it for the Greenleaf Real Estate Office. The Greenleaf hardware store moved to 207 North Sibley in March 1877. W. P. Todd, a brother of J. G. Todd who had a dry goods store in town, bought the twenty-five by sixty-foot two-story building from Greenleaf in September 1877, who moved to another Sibley location. Oren Wilbert ‚ÄúBert‚Äù Topping bought the old office of the Flynn & Bros. farm machinery business and moved it to 221 North Ramsey in September 1884 after he had bought lots 23 through 26 of this Block 60. Oren was born in Greenleaf, Minnesota, making him a rarity among early Litchfield businessmen. Most were from out of state. In 1878, Greenleaf purchased the lumber yard of M.J. Flynn, and in 1880 he bought the lumberyard of H. B. Brown and consolidated the two. In 1882, he added his son, Charles Albert, to the business in a full partnership. More than likely, he added his son to run the business while he was ‚Äúpoliticking‚Äù. Because from 1882 to 1886, William was sent to the State Senate. There was an old wooden building at the corner where the Nelson Buick dealership had once been. It housed the Clough Brothers lumberyard, which started in September 1882. Clough‚Äôs was sold to William Henry Greenleaf and Son (Charles Albert) in the spring of 1884. By now you know about Albert Spence, Litchfield‚Äôs only black resident who came after the Civil War. Most people don‚Äôt know about the second black person in the county. ‚ÄúBlack Jenny‚Äù was Jenny Gardner and she was originally a housemaid for the Harmon Pennoyer family in Greenleaf. The Pennoyers had vacationed in the south in October 1886 and had convinced Jenny to come back up north to work for them. Farm kids around the Greenleaf area had never seen a black woman, and Jenny was very black, so they would go out of their way to go by the Pennoyer place and peek in on Jenny working in the house. She‚Äôd see them and say, ‚ÄúRun along, you chiluns.‚Äù Black Jenny moved to Litchfield from Greenleaf, to run a laundry. Rankin‚Äôs Hardware at 201 North Sibley had been the Rankin & Greenleaf Hardware, which started in April 1883, at another location. Rankin had bought out Greenleaf in November 1884. In May 1889, Charles Albert Greenleaf and William Grono moved their real estate business into a corner room at 109 North Sibley. From July 1889 to July 1893, the popular Brightwood Resort was across the lake on the south shore of Lake Ripley. Hiram Branham and Charles Albert Greenleaf owned and ran the resort. The Greenleafs, father and son, leased an elevator in September 1889. William Henry Greenleaf and his son Charles moved an office for their lumberyard to 214 North Sibley in the front in March 1895. Charles Greenleaf and William Grono moved their real estate business to 236 North Sibley either in late 1894 or early 1895 and Grono moved out in 1897. There was an elevator across Sibley Avenue, south of the tracks, which Chauncey Sage Butler built in 1874 with his partner Isaac Hines. It failed in 1877 and James B. Atkinson, Sr. bought it. Michael J. Flynn and Brother (Daniel) bought it in 1880. It was bought by William Henry Greenleaf and Son and managed by H. H. Hine in September 1897. Charles Albert Greenleaf took over the lumberyard from his father in September 1897. Charles was Litchfield‚Äôs twentieth mayor in 1899 and he sold his Greenleaf Lumber Company in June 1900 to Fred A. Kopplin. William Henry Greenleaf moved his real estate office into a room at 212 North Sibley in March 1902. The Greenleaf mansion was the sole house in the entire block on the site where the Meeker County Hospital was constructed in 1950. William Henry Greenleaf died on October 28, 1917.

James Harvey moved to Forest City, during the Sioux Uprising, and he fought the Indians at the stockade. James ended up being the Clerk of the District Court. Harvey was first settled by John and Thomas Dougherty in the summer of 1856. They broke 25 acres of land that summer. A man named McCue came about two weeks before the Doughertys, but he soon left. The township was originally a part of Forest City, but it was organized separately in 1867. There were no marriages or deaths in Harvey until May 1870, when Dennis Dougherty and Mary Finnegan got married. Edward Dolan, an 8-year-old boy, died that year. Thomas Dougherty was the first Justice of Peace. Edward O. Britt, his wife Lucinda, and his mother Charity (n√©e Tibbits) were among the first settlers. They came from Maine. Charity was born in Litchfield, Maine on April 3, 1773. Forest City was first located in Harvey Township and was called Kar-i-shon by the Indians, which meant ‚Äúcrow‚Äù. In September 1931, Dan Brown had Dan Brown's Tavern and Restaurant in Litchfield. He then started the Harvey Tavern just outside of town in Harvey Township in August 1937.

The population was 161 at the 2010 census. History Tuesday afternoon, August 19, the day after the Sioux Uprising massacre at Acton in 1862, word was received that the outbreak was widespread and would extend all along the border. That evening, the frightened settlers held a council meeting, and they decided to send all the women and children to Clearwater. Jesse V. Branham, Jr., the future first Council President for Litchfield (Mayor), was appointed to take charge of the wagon train of loved ones. Wednesday morning, the wagon train started on the journey to safety. It was made up of animal teams of every description and was a half a mile in length. Jesse V. Branham, Jr., led them about halfway through the ‚ÄúBig Woods,‚Äù when he turned the train over to a couple of other gentlemen, bade his family good- bye, and returned to Kingston. There he talked with a number of the leading citizens, gave them his idea of a stockade, and on the following morning, with his team, he hauled the first logs for the Kingston fortifications. Kingston is a city along the North Fork of the Crow River was settled in 1856 and platted in 1857. A post office was established at Kingston that year, changed to a rural branch through 1907 to 1910, and was reestablished as a community post office in 1954. The town was organized on April 5, 1858, and the name was proposed by George A. Nourse, a lawyer of St. Anthony (Minneapolis). The city in section 22 was platted in 1871 and incorporated as a village on September 13, 1961. Twenty-five other states, and also the Canadian provinces of Ontario and New Brunswick, have villages or cities and townships of that name. State Highway 15 serves as the main route in and out of the community, and Minnesota State Highway 24 is nearby. There's always differences of opinion as to the first this or the first that. Most history books say that the first settler in Meeker County was Benjamin F. Dorman, who, in 1856, broke prairie sod between Kingston and Forest City, so that he could make a land claim, which he started farming. Morris Powers was the next to follow suit, but he died the next season. Jonathan Burnett Salisbury was working at doing public surveys for the government in various parts of Iowa, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. In the summer of 1855, while running township lines through what is now Meeker County, Jonathan was so much pleased with the country that he stuck a claim stake in sections 18 and 19, in what is now Kingston Township. At that time, there were no other people there, except those of the surveying parties, within the limits of Meeker County. Returning to his home in Scott County, Iowa in October 1855, he stayed there until the spring of 1856, when he came back to Kingston with his family. Salisbury had brought all his possessions with him, and the trip took about one month. To one large, wide tracked wagon were hitched four yoke of oxen, and to another wagon, a team of horses. A good share of the time was spent in getting through the ‚Äúbig woods,‚Äù because there was no road other than a trail, and a good deal of chopping was necessary. This trail had been cut so that one team could barely get through, and was for years known as the ‚ÄúOld Territorial Road.‚Äù The party, however, finally reached the claim, and their first job was to put up a little cabin. This was one of the first houses erected in Meeker County. At the time of the Indian outbreak, Salisbury and his family left the farm and went into the village of Kingston, which Jonathan helped to fortify. For two weeks, his family occupied someone's house, and then all the refugees who had gathered in the village spent the nights in the grist mill, which was being used as a fort. Salisbury and his family stayed in Kingston for about one month, at which time he sent his family to their old home in Iowa. Salisbury enlisted in the ‚ÄúMounted Rangers,‚Äù or the First Minnesota Cavalry, and he served through the Indian War for one year. He then enlisted in Hatch's Independent Battalion of Minnesota Cavalry for three years and served on the frontier. Upon being honorably discharged in the spring of 1866, he sent to Iowa for his family and again returned to their Kingston farm and cultivated it until June 1875, when they moved to Litchfield. In 1868, Salisbury was elected to represent his district in the Legislature. Mark Cates came to Meeker County in 1856, and upon the filing of his claim in April of that year, he went back to Maine, where he got married, and then he returned and settled upon his land that same year. His property was located on section 20, Kingston township. Orrin Whitney came in March 1857, with his brother, Albion P. Whitney, Samuel B. Hutchins, and some others, and Orrin settled at Kingston. He helped build the mill put up by him and Averill & Hutchins in 1857 and 1858. It was the first grist-mill in the county. Also in 1857, Samuel A. Dorman came to Kingston and settled on section 17. F. V. DeCoster came in the spring of 1858 and he started working in carpentering, teaching, and in the fur trade. He stayed in the fur business most of the time until the Indian Uprising of 1862 broke out. He already had become friendly with Chief Little Crow, the head of the massacre movement, and also with Chief Shakopee, buying fur and venison from them at various times. In 1859‚Äì1860, DeCoster left Kingston for a trip through the south for quite a while, but he returned to Kingston. When the Civil War started, DeCoster enlisted and fought in many battles, even personally capturing some Confederate soldiers. After the close of the war, he remained in St. Louis for four months and then he returned to Kingston and engaged in the general mercantile trade. This he conducted until 1868 when he sold out and became a partner in a flouring mill. He remained in that until the spring of 1871, when he moved to Litchfield. Most of his time in Kingston, he was a justice of the peace. Michael Murphy came in May in 1862 along with Daniel Byrnes and his children. His son Michael and his other son William had a general store in town starting in January of1886, along with T. Owen. They remained in partnership with Owen until the 1st of January, 1888, when Mr. Owen sold out to Timothy J. Murphy, yet another Murphy brother. William taught in the Kingston village school for the winter term of 1883-1884 and later settled in the village. He held the office of justice of the peace for two years, and that of the clerk of the township for quite a time. He was appointed postmaster in September 1886. In 1864, Frederick Spath came to Kingston where he opened a blacksmith shop and continued in that business for two years. He then moved to Dassel. William Hamilton enlisted in the Union Army and fought in the battles of Chickamauga, Hoover's Gap, Mill Spring, Berryville, besides many small skirmishes. In one of those battles, he lost the use of his left arm. He was honorably discharged in St. Paul in August 1864, and he got married in St. Anthony, now East Minneapolis, in September 1864. He and his wife then came and settled in Kingston. When the Civil War ended and Ephraim A. Briggs was mustered out in New York, he got married on November 16, 1866, to Helen F. Hale, a native of Maine and they moved to Kingston. He started in the mercantile business, but after eight months, he sold out and returned to New York. Three months later he came back and took up a homestead on section 34, Kingston township. He then purchased the store of F. V. DeCoster, and continued the mercantile business until 1875, since which time he has been chiefly employed dealing in real estate. Ephraim was the postmaster of Kingston from 1874 until 1886; has filled the offices of justice of the peace and the town treasurer. Otho H. Campbell came to Kingston in the year of 1866 and entered into the general merchandise trade in connection with the Whiting Brothers, a Clearwater firm. One year later he bought out his partners, and for two years ran the business alone. At the end of that time, he moved to the new village of Litchfield, and, purchased the Lake Ripley House, which he ran for two years. His son, Ernest Wells Campbell, a Litchfield lawyer, was born on November 19, 1870, in Kingston. Adam Brower, during the Civil War, was in many of the bloodiest battles of the war, among which were Winchester, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, in the east, and, after they were transferred, in Cumberland, Resaca, and Altoona. He was wounded in Altoona and was laid up in the hospital for a few weeks. He was taken prisoner by the rebels at the battle of Winchester, May 25, 1862, and kept by them until September 20, following, when he was exchanged and resumed duty. He was mustered out, at Indianapolis, September 14, 1865. In February 1867, Adam came to Meeker County and purchased a place in Kingston. For the first three years of his residence here he was engaged in brick making in the village, but at the expiration of that time took up farming. Two seasons since that he has been in the same business, and a part of the time in the sawmill at Dassel. John W. Benton was among the settlers of 1867 and he settled in section 10. Alphonso Carvil, a doctor, came in 1867 and stayed for several years. Robert M. Damuth came to Meeker County in 1868 and settled in Kingston. Nelson Turner did the same, in the same year, and located on section 34, Kingston. He served for three years as director of school district No. 41. John Olson came in 1868 and took a homestead of eighty acres of land on section 34. Thomas F. Price came with his mother. After his father died, his mother went West with her family in the fall of 1856, and for six months stayed in Minneapolis. Then the family settled in Kingston and made their home. They stayed in Kingston during all of the trouble with the Indians in 1862 and on, although nearly all of the settlers throughout the county went away for safety. In 1863, the family moved to Harvey Township. H. V. Rumsey came to Minnesota in 1868 from Wisconsin, where he had been living for years, and he settled in Kingston. Samuel C. Vincent came to Meeker county in 1869 and settled on section 4 of Kingston to farm. Peter Norgren came in 1873 and purchased a half interest in the saw and flouring mill at East Kingston. Peter worked in the milling business for two years and a half when he sold his interest to his partner and moved to Dassel. James H. Shimin came on December 18, 1876, to farm on section 26 of the township. John Wise came in 1879 to farm. He claimed section 29, Kingston Township. John Mattson owned and operated the flouring mill in Kingston. He came to Kingston on October 4, 1882, and purchased from J. H. Thompson, of Minneapolis, the mill built by Whitney & Hutchins. George Maynard was one of the first settlers of Dassel, where he landed in May 1866. He made his home in that part of the county for about twenty years and then he moved to Kingston in section 32. He was one of the ‚Äúwoods‚Äù farmers and stock-raisers of the town. Three men visited Kingston September 24, 1919. The men drove into town in a Buick-Six touring car. They were all dressed in hunting clothes, which wasn't unusual given the area and the time of year. But they didn't seem to be in any hurry to do any hunting. Instead, they hung around town, walking the streets, standing next to their car smoking, and talking. Finally, a little after noon, they ambled into the local caf√© and had a bite to eat. Stretching their dinner out as long as they could, they paid their bills and walked back to their car. They got in and drove out of town. About a mile out of town, they pulled over, got out, and removed the car's license plates. Jumping back in, they turned around and headed back into town where two of the men were deposited at 1:30 pm in front of the Kingston State Bank, the only bank in town. The third man stayed in the car. Then two of the men, still dressed in their hunting clothes, walked into the bank and one of them walked up to cashier John E. Matsen's counter. He started a conversation with Matsen about the weather, how the hunting was in the area, just small talk, never once saying what he wanted in the bank. Matsen started to get suspicious. Suddenly the man pulled a revolver out of his pocket and pointed it in Matsen's face. ‚ÄúThis is a holdup,‚Äù the man said. Matsen looked at him and then just ducked down under his counter and pressed the alarm button. The robber fired his gun into the counter. Frightened by the alarm, the two men gave up their quest and turned and ran out the door, where they jumped into the waiting car and sped away. Matsen ran out the door after the men, saw them head west out of town across the bridge. He ran to his own car, where John A. Hannula joined him. The quickly formed posse took off after the outlaws. Just out of town, they were met with some men moving a herd of cows across the road. Slowed down, they couldn't find their quarry again and gave up the pursuit. The would-be bank robbers were never caught. One of the baseball players on the 1951 Litchfield Optimists Championship team was Bob Kinsel from Kingston. He pitched (a record of 6 and 1) and he played outfield. The population of Kingston was 161 in the 2010 census. On March 12, 2013, a special election was held regarding the dissolution of Kingston. With 23 votes in favor of the dissolution and 36 votes against the dissolution, the petition for dissolution was rendered not effective Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

The population was 6,726 at the 2010 census. History The January 22, 1880 Litchfield News-Ledger newspaper stated, ‚ÄúTwenty-five years ago (1855), where now stands the beautiful and enterprising city of Litchfield, was an unimproved waste, inhabited only by wild beasts and wandering bands of red men.‚Äù There wasn't much else here other than some thick woods and a prairie. The famous ‚ÄúBig Woods‚Äù was just four miles away. But, the plentiful wood, nearby water, and rich black earth was appealing to settlers. And the price was right...$1.25 per acre for the homesteader. (The homestead law did not become effective until January 1, 1863.) In an early historic document, our area of Minnesota was called the ‚Äúgarden of the State‚Äù. In the late spring/early summer of 1855, John W. Huy, Benjamin Brown and someone named Mackenzie (John?), all employed by a St. Paul lumber company, paddled a canoe up the Crow River to the Minnesota Territory's west-central area in search of pine timber. Not satisfied with their findings, they returned to St. Paul, but Huy organized another exploring party, consisting of young lawyer D. M. Hanson (called the first Swede to visit the area), Dr. Thomas H. Skinner, and Rudolph Schultz. Late that summer, the explorers took off for the same area and, in the fall, they stopped in what is now the township of Harvey. There they planned to start a town and call it Kar-i-shon, Sioux for ‚Äúcrow‚Äù, which is what the Indians called the area. But, for some reason, they moved on to the present day Forest City area where they met Dr. Frederick Noah Ripley. They preferred this area so Schultz and Huy made a dugout house on the banks of the Crow River where it made a junction with a creek and Huy stayed in it through the following winter to make a claim on the land. He thus became the first permanent white resident of the county. The others, except for Dr. Ripley, returned to St. Paul where Hanson went before the legislature and urged them to create a new county, which would include the area he had just visited. The legislature complied and established Meeker County on February 23, 1856. The county was named in honor of Bradley Burr Meeker of Minneapolis, who was an associate justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court from 1849 to 1853. Hanson and Huy, who were appointed county commissioners, met in the newly started Forest City on May 6, 1856, and organized the county on paper. Ripley, another appointed commissioner, was to have joined them, but he had frozen to death the previous March 3 half a mile from the lake which now bears his name. William S. Chapman found his body later in the spring. With the nearby Crow River for transportation, more and more people gravitated to Forest City. It was named the county seat. Litchfield was originally a portion of a Congressional township named Round Lake, but most people called it Ripley after the lake one mile from its center. Prairie schooners or covered wagons brought the first white people to settle in the area in July 1856. They were Ole Halverson of Ness or Nes, Norway, who changed his name to Ole Ness, Henry T. Halverson, Sr., Ole Halverson of Thoen, who changed to Ole Thoen, Amos Nelson of Fossen, changed to Amos Fossen, Nels Charles G. Hanson, Colberg Olson, Gunder Olson, and all of their families. Having previously left their homeland of Norway in 1846, the settlers came here from Orfordville, Wisconsin (south of Madison, almost to Illinois). Nels Charles G. Hanson had a twin brother named Carl John Gottfried Hanson, who I believe didn't accompany Nels. Later that year, William Benson, Sven or Swen, and Nels Swenson, Michael Lenhardt, and Ferdinand, Christian, Frederick and William Cook came, also by prairie schooner. Sarah Jane Dougherty became the first white child to be born in Meeker County. She was born in her parents‚Äô prairie schooner on July 15, 1856. (She died in 1952 in Litchfield.) The first white male child, born in his parents‚Äô crude log cabin on December 11, 1856, was Ole Hoen H. Halverson. (He died in Litchfield on June 22, 1925.) I suppose Henry Thoen Halverson and his wife Margaret's cabin was the first ‚Äúhouse‚Äù in town if you can call it that. There was another ‚Äúfirst house‚Äù. More about that later. More people came in 1857. The 1857 Litchfield township census had Englishman George Blackwell, Norwegians Ole and Margaret Halverson, Gunden Alson, Keeted and Carrie Harrison, Henry and Margaret Hulverson, Barbary Hendrickson, Ole Halverson, Oliver and Jane Halverson, Guider Holson, Nelsoter and Annie Johnson, Gulfan Eberson, Asmond Nelson, Oli Climinson and Swedish Ole Benson. After the census, more people came. They were Bengt Hanson, John Larson and his sons, Nels, Andrew, Peter E. and Lewis Larson, Hogen Peterson, Thorlson J. Cornelius, Ole Amundson, Nels Danielson, Kittel Haroldson, Henry J. Johnson, Ole Kittelson, Jesse V. Branham, Sr. and his sons, Jesse V., Jr., William and Edward Branham, Oscar Erickson, Nels Clements, Ola Johnson, and Louis and Maximillian Cook. Still more in 1858. They were Iver Jackson, Bengt Nelson, John and Thomas McGannon, and a man named George B. Waller, Sr. George had so much land, that he deeded one-half interest in 150 acres of his land to the railroad company to plat a town upon, and upon which a part of the original township was laid out in July, 1869. Waller shipped the lumber to build a house, which he had gotten out of Minneapolis, to here as soon as the trains were running, and he put up one of the first houses in the village. He moved his family here in November 1869. The pioneers, some of whom lived in nothing more than a ‚Äúdugout‚Äù, named their settlement Ness on April 5, 1858, because most of the first settlers‚Äô home church was in Ness, Hullingdahl, Norway. Minnesota became the 32nd state in the Union on May 11, 1858. In the fall of 1858, the Ness church here was established in the Ness home, which was southwest of present-day Litchfield. Norwegian Reverend William Frederickson conducted the first service and, in 1874, the settlers there built an actual church building. The government started offering free land to homesteaders in the Litchfield area in 1861. The Indian Outbreak of 1862, also called the Sioux Uprising, slowed immigration to the area, however. The Sioux War moved further out west as the local Indians were put under control and the Civil War ended in 1865. Veterans started coming to Minnesota looking to start a new life. Immigration to our Meeker County, however, continued to be slow until the St. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba Railroad, which became the St. Paul and Pacific and then the Great Northern, started coming through the Ness area in 1869. The first train to arrive was a construction train on August 13, 1869. Having been in service for only seven years, the railroad's first locomotive was called the William Crooks Engine No. 1. A man named Bernard Dassel paid out money to the railroad workers along the route from the train's ‚Äúpay car‚Äù. In gratitude for his loyalty, the railroad named a village after him. The William Crooks brought the first female residents to our town. Marietta Porter, who was married to Charles O. Porter, came on August 26, 1869 and Mary L. Pixley, wife of insurance agent B. F. Pixley, came the next day. In September 1924, the railroad sent the William Crooks engine on a good-will tour from Chicago to Seattle. It stopped in Litchfield pulling two 1862 coaches and was met by a large crowd of on-lookers. The September 13, 1924, Litchfield Saturday Review read, ‚ÄúOld engine to be here. Great Northern engine No. 1, the William Crooks and the old sleeper car No. 9, the first to be used on the Great Northern, will be in Litchfield on Friday of next week between 9 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. The appearance of the William Crooks, which last was operative in 1908, should prove of interest to young and old.‚Äù Litchfield was just prairie prior to 1869. An old pioneer, interviewed by the newspaper, said there was prairie grass growing down Sibley Avenue and there was a small pond where Sibley Antiques is today. The pioneer remembered shooting ducks at that pond. Another pioneer, butcher Chris Sather, remembered a big wheat field in the mid-1870s from the corner of Sibley Avenue North and Second Street all the way out to Lake Ripley. In 1867, George Baker Waller, Sr. moved his family to Minneapolis from Illinois, where they had lived for two years. Then, in June 1869, Waller came to the area where Litchfield now stands. While living in Minneapolis, George had purchased the northeast quarter of section 11 here, knowing that a town would soon be located in this vicinity. George must have heard some talk in Minneapolis about the railroad coming this way and he even knew the route of the rails‚Äô path. When the railroad did come here, George owned the land and he deeded an undivided one-half interest in 150 acres of his land to the railroad company to plat a town upon. I wonder what he got for his land investment? Possibly he just gave the railroad the land as an inducement for the railroad to locate a town here, which of course would increase the value of the rest of George's land. Regardless, railroad engineer and surveyor Charles A. F. Morris surveyed the land that Waller had deeded to the railroad and formally platted it on June 17, 1869. George moved his wife Mary and two of his sons, George, Jr. and Henry W., here in November 1869. He had a large apple orchard on the one hundred and sixty acres he kept, where he also grew beets. Waller's oldest son, John A. C. married Retta D. while working as a clerk in Minneapolis in 1869. He brought her to Litchfield where he had the first post office in town in his home starting on September 20, 1869. (One local newspaper tells us that Horace B. Johnson was the first postmaster, so John must not have been officially appointed, but he acted as a postmaster.) From 1870 to 1874, the post office was at the northwest corner of Sibley Avenue and Second Street where Litchfield's first official postmaster Horace B. Johnson had his clothing store. The Pizza Ranch is there today. John D. and William C. ‚ÄúBilly‚Äù Peterson were on one of the first trains that stopped here. They eventually had a tobacco and candy shop on the west side of Sibley Avenue. They said that when they arrived, the only building in town was a little eight by ten-foot shack across the street to the east from the current Post Office. That would be at the northeast corner of Marshall Avenue and Second Street (202 North Marshall). Ole lived in the barn for a summer while his house was being built. Truls Peterson built the building in 1869 that John and Billy referred to. Truls conducted a tailoring business from it. He had bought the southeast corner of Sibley Avenue and Second Street but traded it for this corner. Ole Ness-Halverson bought the lot and it was Farmers‚Äô Insurance Company agent B. F. Pixley's residence for many years. It's no surprise then that Litchfield's first real residential house and the second building was next door north of Truls‚Äô shack. Even though the land was deeded by the railroad to Nils Pearson for the sum of $50 on October 6, 1869, George B. Waller, Sr. built the house in 1871 and it was at 206 Marshall Avenue North and still there today. In those days, you could order a house from a lumberyard, like from the big lumberyards in Minneapolis. The lumberyard would then ship, by rail, everything you needed to build the house, including detailed construction plans. So, George had a house shipped to him from Minneapolis as soon as the trains were up and running. The third building to go up was Samuel Alvin Heard and C. D. Ward's general merchandise store at the southwest corner of Sibley Avenue and Third Street. It was Litchfield's first store and Heard was Litchfield's eighth Village Council President in 1879. The clothing store and Post Office building owned by Horace B. Johnson at the northwest corner of Sibley Avenue and Second Street came next. Johnson was Litchfield's third Village Council President in 1874 when the population of Litchfield was just nine hundred people. At some time J. M. Miller's house went up somewhere. Next came a lumberyard owned by Joseph James, just across the railroad tracks to the south and also his office building, which was on the west side of Sibley Avenue. When the railroad came in the fall of 1869, the businesses in town were Samuel Alvin Heard and C. D. Ward's store, William S. Brill's drug store, which became Meeker County's first drug store, the lumber business (but not a lumberyard) owned by Joseph James, a lumberyard owned by John Esbjornsson and Charles Ellis Peterson, Clark L. Angell's photography studio, Chase and Dunn's livery stable, Charles John Ludwig Almquist's hotel called the Litchfield House, and the Railway Land Office managed by Col. Hans Mattson. The lone doctor in town was George W. Weisel, Litchfield's second Village Council President in 1873, but there were three lawyers, Francis ‚ÄúFrank‚Äù Belfoy, Newton H. C. Chittenden, and Judge Charles Henry Strobeck. Strobeck, born in New York, was the first lawyer in town and he was Litchfield's eleventh Village Council President in 1882 and seventeenth mayor in 1895. Some other store ‚Äúfirsts‚Äù were B. O. Esping's jewelry store, D. E. Potter's furniture store, Mark Baldwin's harness shop, (John) Vander Horck and (Smith D.) King's hardware store, and Harrington and Lynn's Bank of Litchfield, which closed in 1877. Lewis L. Nyholm laid the first cement sidewalk in Litchfield in 1895 in the 200 block of Sibley Avenue. Before that, of course, any sidewalks in town were made of wood. Because there was a gentle southerly slope of the land in town towards Daley Slough, by the time the sidewalk reached where True Valu hardware was, it was four feet off the ground and required steps. Daley Slough was a large wet area taking up more than the block where Longfellow Square apartments are today at 416 Sibley Avenue South. It was deep enough that some old-timers remembered swimming in it. By 1871, the village, which by then was then called Ness, had grown to double the population of Forest City. The county, at that time, had 6,610 people living in it. Somewhere in town, most likely by the tracks and the depot, the St. Paul and Pacific railroad put up an ‚Äúimmigrant‚Äôs reception house.‚Äù The 1871 Meeker County News referred to the twenty-five by sixty-foot one-story building as an ‚Äúemigrant house‚Äù. The railroad put them up in villages, such as Litchfield, Willmar, Benson, Morris, and Breckenridge, along the railroad's lines in the 1870s. The largest one was in Duluth and it could accommodate one hundred immigrants. The houses were ‚Äúfitted up with cooking-stoves, washing conveniences, and beds.‚Äù The newly arriving immigrants were given shelter in the reception houses and the chance to buy food and clothing at cost from the railroad while they looked for land in the area. It wasn't that costly to come to America in the early days. In 1885, the Stevens and Company Bank offered tickets from Germany to Litchfield for $23.00. In 1886, you could get a ticket from Sweden to Litchfield for $29.50. Litchfield got its name from a man named Electus Bachus Darwin Litchfield. Little is known about the man. E. Darwin, as he preferred to be called, was a contractor, an investor, and a stockholder in the St. Paul and Pacific Railroad. That railroad line originally went from St. Paul to St. Cloud and was built from 1862 to 1864. Later, Mr. Litchfield's investments provided the means for building a more southern line through Meeker County to Breckenridge. The town of Darwin got its name from Mr. Litchfield also. The village here was called Round Lake, Ripley, and finally Ness, and the people of Ness were permitted to vote on the actual chartered village name of their township. Electus, showing his business sense, had his wife in London donate grants of $2000 each to various religious sects in town to build churches. The Episcopal and Presbyterian churches were two of them. The Presbyterian Church, Litchfield's first church, was built in 1870. Presbyterian minister Reverend D. B. Jackson had held the first religious service in Litchfield on August 15, 1869, in a small building that had no windows. It was also used as a schoolhouse. Litchfield's first school, however, was in the home of Ole Halverson-Ness in 1860. Ole employed and paid John Blackwell to teach his children and as many others who could get to his house. The church-going three hundred and fifty-three people in town could hardly snub Mr. Litchfield and keep the name Ness. The citizens put their votes into a ballot box made out of butternut wood in 1868 by Hendrick Thoen ‚ÄúHenry‚Äù Halverson, Sr. The box was still being used in town in the early 1900s. The majority voted for the name Litchfield and the township of Litchfield was chartered as a village on February 29, 1872. The first village council meeting was held on April 5, 1872, in the railroad's land office, which was at the northeast corner of Sibley Avenue North and Depot Street, where Sibley Antiques is today. Jesse Vawter Branham, Jr. was elected the President of the Council, which was the same as being elected mayor. In October 1924, Electus Darwin Litchfield's son, also named Electus Darwin Litchfield, came by train to visit the town. A telegram was sent in advance and the city fathers mistakenly thought old man Litchfield himself was coming. They pulled out all the stops, meeting the train with dignitaries, speeches and flowers. Junior was embarrassed and he wrote the Independent newspaper a letter of apology for the misunderstanding. He wrote, ‚ÄúI am afraid the telegram may have been worded so as to give you all the impression that my father was to arrive. I hope you will again thank Mr. (Jesse V.) Branham‚Äôs daughter (Alice) for the beautiful flowers, which his son appreciated no less than would have his father for whom they were intended.‚Äù Remembering that Mr. Litchfield's son was an architect, the town petitioned the government to have him design its new post office. Washington, D.C., gave the job to the son in November 1933 and so the son of Litchfield's namesake designed that brick building on the northwest corner of Second Street and Marshall Avenue. Litchfield's entire downtown, between Depot Street (once called Wall Street) and Third Street, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Most of the store buildings were built between 1882 and 1945. Many were built with bricks manufactured between the years of 1875 to 1899 at Henry Ames and Sons‚Äô Brickyard Farm northeast of town. The first building, made from Ames‚Äô bricks in Litchfield, was barber Michael Robert ‚ÄúMike‚Äù Weiss‚Äô residence on Sibley Avenue South in about 1877. I would say the years of 1885 and 1886 pretty much defined the look of downtown Litchfield. Many of the first brick buildings on Sibley Avenue North, especially the 200 block, went up in those years, as well as the first brick courthouse and the G.A.R. Hall across from the park. The brickyard closed in July 1902, moving to Paynesville. An 1889 Litchfield Ledger article about Litchfield called it the ‚ÄúQueen of the Prairies‚Äù and added the statement ‚ÄúNo Drone in Her Hive, and Every Inhabitant Full of Work and Public Spirit‚Äù. Apparently the newspaper editor thought quite a bit of the city that had ballooned to a population of 2,500. Litchfield wasn't officially a city until 1943. Up until then, it was a village or a town. In the early fifties, a billboard by Lake Ripley boasted that Litchfield had a population of 5000 (exactly?) and a town motto of ‚ÄúLarge enough to serve you, small enough to know you.‚Äù The north end of town had a billboard that claimed ‚ÄúLitchfield - The Hub Of Rural Progress‚Äù. I don't think you could argue either motto. Litchfield's businesses did have everything we needed to get by in life and everyone in town knew everyone else's business. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. U.S. Highway 12 and Minnesota State Highways 22 and 24 are three of the main routes in the city.

The population was 414 at the 2000 census. Swede Grove Township was first settled in 1857 by N. E. Hanson, Nels Elofson, Hans Peterson, Peter E. Lund, Nels Weylander, Andrew Petersonk, and John Rosencranz. There were a few others with their families. The township was named by N. E. Hanson and Nels Elofson because it was settled by Swedes and there was a nice grove of trees nearby. Nels, by the way, was the second white man in Meeker County. The township, originally a part of Acton Township, was organized on March 15, 1868. Nels Elofson was appointed postmaster in 1859. The same day as the Indian attack in Acton in 1862, a meeting of some of the settlers was being held at Nels Elofson's house in Swede Grove in the morning. The purpose of the meeting was not about the Indians, as they hadn‚Äôt heard about the massacre yet. The purpose was to find three men to go off into service in the Union Army. Swede Grove Township was required to fill the draft quota made on it by the government. At about ten o'clock in the morning, Nel‚Äôs neighbor Ole Monson‚Äôs children came running in the house and informed their father, and the other settlers at the meeting, that some Indians were in the area. The children were frightened and wanted to stay at the house. Monson and Swan Nelson went to see what the trouble was. Along the way, they met some Indians on horseback. One of the Indians reached down from his horse, grabbed Nelson by his whiskers, and pointed to the east. Swan didn‚Äôt understand what the Indian was trying to tell him. They parted company peacefully. The Indians stopped at Elofson's place. Nels knew several of them. They told Nels that they were on their way to the ‚ÄúBig Woods‚Äù for the purpose of killing some Chippewas who, they said, had been killing the whites. Then they rode off. Before long, news of the murders of the Jones and Baker families in Acton got to Nels and, in the evening, he and Nels Hanson went to the scene of the murders where others had also gathered. There they learned the details of the attack and were told to come back the next morning to help bury the dead, which they did. While they were there, nine Indians came in sight and several shots were exchanged, but no one was hurt. Elofson returned to his home and helped to get up his and all the neighboring families to go to Ripley (now Litchfield). When the settlers returned to their homes later, they found that the Sioux had burned down most of the houses, except for a couple. The couple not burned down were the homes of men who had been friendly with the Indians, like Nels, and even had bothered to learn their language. Their homes had been ‚Äúprotected‚Äù by a yellow feather on a post marking it. On September 1, 1862, seventeen men and some others started for Green Lake on the word there was a family on an island there. But Green Lake has no islands. They were turned back at Swede Grove, however, after a skirmish with the Indians. Two Indians were killed and a soldier named Samuel B. Hutchins, from Kingston, was hit in the thigh with a musket ball. On their way away from the skirmish, Ovid B. Todd was injured when someone's gun accidentally discharged. A summer of 1925 Litchfield newspaper headline read: ‚ÄúMan, 93, Arrested as Still Tender, Stands on Rights. Nels Elefson (Elofson was the correct spelling) of Meeker County Held as State's Oldest Moonshiner.‚Äù Other than the fact that the paper got his name and age wrong, the old settler, who died a couple of months later on June 8, 1925, at the correct age of 90 plus, was going to go out with a bang. Nels, who, as I wrote, was involved in the Sioux Uprising, was still the oldest man ever accused of bootlegging in Minnesota. Prohibition agent Ole Olson brought Nels into custody. According to the newspaper article, Nels was ‚Äúsaid to have been caught red-handed in the act of tending a still cooker in Grove City. Elefson was born in 1831 (actually June 18, 1834) and used to be a justice of the peace in his county.‚Äù (He was also the postmaster in Swede Grove in 1859.) ‚ÄúIt's my constitutional right to make moonshine if I want to,‚Äù Nels stated. The article went on that ‚Äúthe still, said to have been operated there by the aged man, was in a tiny teapot and that it took him (Nels) three weeks to make a quart of alcoholic liquor which he used in his coffee in the morning, the habit of 80 years. Elefson is known as a pioneer and Indian fighter of the early days. He was released on his own recognizance.‚Äù Notable locations in Swede Grove Township are Cojo Dairy, Grove Creek Raceway, Trinity Lutheran Church, Fellowship Church, and the First Lutheran Cemetery.

Lyman Allen named the town, but no one knows the reason behind it. Patriotism and trees? The township was organized on April 18, 1866. Charles H. McCune, the postmaster in Union Grove, had built a small house on a hill overlooking the Crow River in Union Grove Township. Charles did something unusual for the times when he built his house. He put in a back door. Doors and windows were used sparingly in the pioneer days as they were costly and were places to lose much needed heat in Minnesota‚Äôs cold winters. Charles was out working in his field and his wife, Catherine, was in the house cooking his noon meal. She had the back door open, as it was a warm morning, and her cooking made her kitchen even warmer. Catherine glanced up from her work and noticed a small group of Indians approaching the house on the back door‚Äôs side. They had war paint on their faces. Her immediate thoughts were to get Annie, her small baby in the other room, and run for it, but she realized that would only make the Indians pursue her. Instead, she went to the rear door and greeted the Indians with some food. ‚ÄúPlease come into my house and share my food,‚Äù she said to the braves, smiling and holding out some great smelling fresh bread. The Indians grabbed the bread and devoured it, following her into the house. No doubt they were very hungry. ‚ÄúPlease sit,‚Äù she said, pulling out a chair. The Indians understood and sat down while Catherine hustled around the kitchen serving them everything she could find. Little Annie gave out a muffled cry and the Indians hardly looked up from their eating as the white woman went into the next room. There Catherine picked up Annie and quietly slipped out the front door. The Indians were used to white men‚Äôs houses with only one door so they never thought to check on the woman. The frightened woman ran down the hill to where her husband and some other men were mowing hay. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a war party of Indians in our house, Charles,‚Äù Catherine yelled, running up to her husband. Wiping his brow, it took only a few seconds for Charles to grasp the situation. He ran over to the other men, talked briefly, and then he grabbed his wife and baby and they took off running on the trail to Manannah, five miles to the east. Along the way, they warned all the settlers they could find. David B. Hoar and Jeremiah Leaming were two of the settlers. Fortunately, most were in their homes at the time eating their noon meal instead of in their fields. They all grabbed their guns, hitched up their wagons, threw in some possessions, and started a wagon train for Manannah. The Indians destroyed Leaming‚Äôs grain in the field and burned his house down during his absence. Back at the McCune house, a brave went to check on the missing white woman and found the front door open. He alerted the others and they took off to find the escaping woman. The settlers had only gone about a mile towards Manannah when they saw the Indians coming, approaching from their rear. By this time, however, the settlers outnumbered the braves, who stopped in their tracks, talked amongst themselves, and then turned and left. Catherine McCune‚Äôs quick thinking and the two door cabin no doubt saved many lives that day. The population of Union Grove was 633 according to the 2010 census.

The population was 225 at the 2010 census. History After the Little Falls and Dakota Railroad was completed in 1882, there was a sidetrack to a mill at the site which later became Flensburg Village. The mill was called Flen's Landing or Flynn's Siding, with a depot and named for J. C. Flynn of Little Falls. Flynn was a teacher in the Little Falls schools in the late 1870s. Later, Flynn was an inspector for the Northern Pacific Railroad and a representative in the state legislature. He was also instrumental in developing the Little Falls & Dakota (L.F.& D.) railroad which ran through the future town of Flensburg. Flensburg was platted in March 1890 by Olaf and Dagmar Searle. The post office began in 1892 and Flensburg was incorporated on June 17, 1911. Flensburg received its name in 1892 and the local newspapers, the Little Falls Weekly Tribune and Little Falls Herald, began using that name about that time. However, a brief item in the April 7, 1893 edition of the Little Falls Transcript states, \\"The name of Flynn station, on the L.F.& D., has been changed to Flensburg, to take effect on April 1, 1893.\\" No further explanation was given. One theory is that Flensburg may have been named after the German town of Flensburg, a seaport in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein. However, many land owner surnames were Polish in the 1892 Culdrum Township Plat Book of the Flensburg area and it seems unlikely they would have chosen the name of a distant German seaport for their new town. Since \\"burg\\" simply means CASTLE it would be reasonable to name the new town Flynnsburg, or the shorter version Flensburg, since the name \\"Flen's Landing\\" was also in use for Flynn Station.

Burton, born to Isaac and Sarah Burton, was the seventh of eight children. At age 18, he moved from Wisconsin to St. Cloud, Minnesota, where he engaged in the clothing and men's furnishing business with his brother, Jacob, as a partner. In 1886, they moved their business to Little Falls, but in 1891 the brothers dissolved their partnership. Nevertheless, the business kept growing and the Barney Burton Clothing Store became the largest mercantile business in Morrison County. Burton married Sarah Deautsch, of Minneapolis, in 1894. She died after the birth of their daughter. In 1898, Barney married Josephine, a sister of Sarah, and had three children. At the turn of the century, they were becoming increasingly prosperous and began planning and building a home. In 1903, they started to build their house in the Classical Revival Style. Barney died of a heart attack in 1942 and Josephine died in 1953. Christian and Linda Rosenmeier moved to Little Falls in 1914 and resided in a flat over the Barney Burton Clothing Store. In 1921, they purchased the home with their three children, Gordon, Margaret and Donald, from the Burton family. Christian had a long career as an attorney, a president of the American National Bank and American Savings and Trust Company, and as a Minnesota state senator from 1922 to 1932. As a state senator, he was the author of the legislation, and helped in establishing Camp Ripley and Lindbergh State Park. Gordon Rosenmeier, Christian's oldest son, followed in his father's footsteps. In 1940, he was elected to the unexpired term of the late senator Fred Miller of Little Falls, and he served in the Minnesota State Senate under eight successive governors. During his three decades of service, he authored series of major bills. Gordon was also a corporate attorney for the local lumber barons R.D. Musser and C.A. Weyerheauser, whose mansions are on the adjacent property to the Rosenmeier estate. His story would not be complete without mentioning his dearest friend and companion, Margaret Hastings. After her divorce, she resettled in Brainerd, where she had accepted a teaching position. Gordon provided advice and counsel in her relocation process. Margaret served as a sounding board for Gordon's pursuit of better government. She became an active participant in documenting his political life through a series of scrapbooks, which provided an orderly collection of media commentary. The Burton-Rosenmeier House serves as the Little Falls Convention and Visitors Bureau.

History Currie was laid out in 1872 around a gristmill built by Neil and Archibald Currie. A post office has been in operation at Currie since 1874. End-O-Line Railroad Park & Museum The park's Georgia Northern #102 steam engine and coal tender End-O-Line Park is nestled on the northern edge of Currie. Founded in 1872 by Neil and Archibald Currie, this place was thought to be the most beautiful country with the Des Moines River moving across the prairie and Lake Shetek in the west. The park is located along Murray County Road 38 near Minnesota Highway 30. The railroads were the first great achievement in transportation of the machine age. This achievement led to the expansion and growth of the West. It is this story, as well as the story of the area, which the museum is trying to tell. A model railroad display, in HO scale, is one of the highlights of the museum. This display is an authentic reproduction of the Currie railroad yards as they were around the turn of the 20th Century. The layout features scratch-built locomotives and structures, complete landscaping, a full wrap-around mural, complete sound effects and more. Visitors can hear the old steam locomotive puff and chug throughout the countryside, which is accented by the steam whistle, bell and hiss of steam. District Number One, the Sunrise School, was moved to End-O- Line Park and restored by the Murray County Historical Society. The embossed tin ceilings and walls, vertical wainscoting, recitation bench and many blackboards are typical, but the triangular sunrise worked into the front and back of the schoolhouse are unique. The little one-room school with tin dinner pails, water cooler, wash basin, old world maps, bell tower and rope, ink wells and cloakrooms, will bring back fond memories to share with children. End-O-Line Park's section house, originally located in Comfrey, was built by Chicago and Northwestern for a section foreman and his family. A saltbox structure, the house has been restored to the early 1900 style. Recreation Currie has many outdoor activities available to the general public. These include the seven-mile bike trail that goes through Lake Shetek State Park, Lake Shetek, and local farmland.

The lower level of the depot is currently used as an antique museum and store. The other building in the city on the National Register is the former Citizens State Bank building. Fulda has a Civil War cannon located in its city park. This cannon is a three-inch (76 mm) rifled gun and was purchased for $155 on June 25, 1892, by the Zach Taylor Post No. 42 of the Grand Army of the Republic. =Notable people= * Fulda was the birthplace of Harold Hotelling, a mathematical statistician and very influential economic theorist. * Baseball Hall of Famer and Negro League pitcher Hilton Smith played for Fulda's semi- pro baseball team in 1949 and 1950. * Sports columnist Patrick Reusse of the Minneapolis Star-Tribune spent his early years in Fulda. * The Continental Co- ets, America's first touring all-girl rock & roll band, originated in Fulda in 1963. * Ted Winter, former Minnesota House Majority Leader and longtime state representative (1987-2003) is from Fulda.

History Adrian owes its birth to the St. Paul and Dakota Railroad Company, a branch of the Sioux City and St. Paul Railroad. Railroad employee O.D. Brown surveyed a 16-block town site in May 1876 and track-laying crews arrived in August of that same year. A city plat was dedicated on August 28 and filed on October 4. =Name= Portrait of Mrs. Adrian Iselin, by John Singer Sargent Railroad company history states that the city was named after Adrian Iselin, a large stockholder in the Sioux City and St. Paul Railroad. A copy of a portrait of Iselin's wife, painted by John Singer Sargent, has been displayed for years in Adrian City Hall. =Railroad era= Adrian's early development was largely fostered by the efforts of John Ireland, bishop of the St. Paul Roman Catholic Diocese. Through the Catholic press, he encouraged Catholics from eastern cities to come to Minnesota, and he used his personal wealth to buy land near Adrian to sell to the new arrivals. In 1877, he bought of land; seven months later he made an additional purchase of . In 1877, 100,000 bushels of grain were shipped from the Adrian station, and the town population totaled 193 people as of 1880. By 1882 the local parish reported 250 Catholic families living in the area. The town population increased to 671 in 1890 and 1,258 in 1900. Growth slowed thereafter, as some of Adrian's rail trade had shifted to the towns of Ellsworth, Lismore and Wilmont. In 1893, Adrian tried but failed to split Nobles County into two parts in order to become a county seat. =St. Adrian Catholic Church= The first St. Adrian Catholic Church was established in 1877. The building burned to the ground Christmas Eve, 1899. The young town responded by building the current church, which was completed in 1901. St. Adrian Church is on the National Register of Historic Places along with the Hotel Slade. =Interstate highway era= At 2:00 p.m., November 4, 1967, the section of Interstate Highway 90 passing Adrian officially opened to traffic. The previously used highway, U.S. Highway 16, passed directly through town. The by-passing of all east/west traffic forever sealed the character of Adrian as a small town.

When declarer plays a winner in one suit (the squeeze card), an opponent is forced to discard a stopper in one of declarer's two threat suits. The simple squeeze takes place against one opponent only and gains one trick only. That opponent must hold the defense's only stoppers in declarer's two threat suits. The simple squeeze requires that declarer has rectified the count: declarer must have already lost as many tricks as he can afford, and can win all but one of the remaining tricks with top cards. Positional squeezes, described next, also require that the defense's stoppers be located favorably for declarer. Other requirements are also discussed in this article. Positional squeezes In Example 1, when the A is cashed, West is squeezed in the major suits. West must discard before North plays. If West discards a spade, dummy discards the K and declarer then wins the AJ. If West discards the A, dummy discards the J and declarer then wins the A and the K. The squeeze will not work if East's and West's cards are swapped as shown in Example 2. Here East can wait to see which threat card is played on the A and discard accordingly; if declarer throws the J, East discards a spade, and if declarer throws the K, East discards the A. (This example assumes that West holds at least one heart after following to the A; else, South's 2 becomes a legitimate threat and the squeeze is automatic‚Äîsee the next examples.) The positional squeeze, is so called because its success depends on the position of the threats K and J relative to the defense's stoppers, the KQ and the A. Either the K or J, or both, must be in the upper hand: the hand that plays after the squeezed defender. Automatic squeezes The positional squeeze which works against one defender only can be distinguished from the automatic squeeze, which works against either defender. Consider the layout in Example 3, where the J and the K are divided between declarer and dummy. When South leads the squeeze card, the A, West is squeezed. If West discards a spade, dummy throws the 2 and declarer then wins dummy's AJ. If West discards the A, dummy throws the J and declarer then wins the K and dummy's A. If the defense's stoppers are in the East hand instead of the West hand and the North-South hands are unchanged as in Example 4, then when declarer leads the A and dummy discards the 2, East is squeezed. If East discards a spade, declarer then wins dummy's AJ. If East discards the A, declarer then wins the K and dummy's A. This is still a simple squeeze, but it is termed an automatic squeeze to distinguish it from a positional squeeze. The fact that declarer's two threats are in different hands means that no matter which defender holds both stoppers, at least one of the threats lies in the upper hand (the J if West is to be squeezed, the K if East is to be squeezed). Entries A successful simple squeeze poses several requirements. The count must be rectified, the defense's stoppers in the threat suits must be held by one opponent only, at least one threat card must lie over the squeezed defender, and at least one threat must lie opposite the squeeze card. In addition to these requirements, one of three general types of entry positions must be present. =The threat opposite the squeeze card has an entry in its own suit= Earlier, Examples 1 and 4, illustrated positional and automatic squeezes; here, they also illustrate one way to satisfy a simple squeeze's entry requirement. One of the threat cards is the J. It lies opposite the squeeze card (the A), and it is accompanied by an entry (the A) in its own suit. The hand containing the squeeze card must of course have another card (here, the 4) that can be used to cross to the A after the squeeze has taken place. =Split two-card threat and twin-entry threat= Another entry position in the simple squeeze gives dummy, for example, an immediate winner and a small card in declarer's threat suit. This position is termed a split two-card threat or split two-card menace. The split two-card threat \\"splits\\" the threat between declarer's hand and dummy. In Example 5, the spade threat is the J. The split two-card threat splits the spade threat's immediate winner, the A, from the threat itself. Dummy holds an immediate winner in the suit where declarer holds the threat. When the squeeze card, the A, is played, West might discard the A. Then dummy throws the 3 and cashes the A and the K. If West discards the Q instead, dummy throws the K. South plays the 2 to the A, removing West's remaining K, and takes the last trick with the J. Notice that the simple squeeze with a split two-card menace is a positional squeeze. It will not operate against East if West's cards in Example 5 are transferred to East, as in Example 6. In Example 6, the split two-card menace is still present but if dummy discards the 3 on the A, East discards the Q and declarer must still lose to the A. If dummy instead discards the K, East throws the A and declarer must still lose to the K. The problem in Example 6 is that declarer does not hold an entry to the J threat after playing the squeeze card. The twin-entry threat converts the positional split-threat squeeze to an automatic squeeze. See Example 7. Dummy holds winner-and-small in declarer's threat suit, as with the split two-card menace in Examples 5 and 6, but now declarer also has a winner (the K) in that threat suit. This is a twin-entry squeeze and is automatic: with these cards in North and South, either West or East could be squeezed. In Example 7, declarer leads A and dummy follows suit. If East discards a spade, declarer wins the A, the K and the 9. If East discards the A, declarer wins the K, the A and the K. The same sequence occurs if West instead of East holds the guards in spades and hearts. =The criss-cross squeeze= The third general type of entry position in the simple squeeze occurs when declarer has an entry in dummy's threat suit and dummy has an entry in declarer's threat suit. This situation is termed a criss-cross squeeze. It is regarded as a comparatively rare position. Example 8 illustrates the criss-cross squeeze. Dummy's threat card is the Q and declarer has an entry, the A, in that suit. Declarer's threat card is the Q and dummy has an entry, the A, in that suit. When declarer cashes the A, East is squeezed. South cashes the A in whichever suit East discards from, crosses to the other A, and cashes the remaining Q. This is an automatic squeeze: it works regardless of which opponent guards the two threats. However, the position is usually ambiguous. After the squeeze has taken place, declarer is often uncertain which guard (in Example 8, the K and the K) is now a singleton. For example, if East unguarded the K earlier in the play, the situation might actually be as shown in Example 9. In this case, declarer cashes the A and East throws a small heart. If declarer now judges that East has bared the K, he will cash the A. When the K does not fall, declarer will subsequently be stuck in dummy, losing the final trick to the K. A similar outcome can result if East bares the K early in the play. The possibility of this sort of ambiguity is inherent in the blocked entry position that characterizes criss-cross squeezes. A defender who can see what's coming can discard deceptively, putting declarer to a guess after the squeeze has matured. The Vienna coup One particular entry configuration may require special handling. In the layout shown in Example 10, the threats (J and Q) are divided between the North and South hands and East holds the guards in the threat suits. Furthermore, North holds a winner in each threat suit and South holds no winner in either threat suit. Suppose that South leads the squeeze card, the A, in the position shown. East simply discards either heart, because the South hand can neither retain nor regain the lead, and the North hand must eventually lose the J to the K. The solution is to unblock the A before leading to the A. After the unblock, the position is as shown in Example 11. The unblock of the A transposes Example 10 into Example 11, a simple automatic squeeze with the Q positioned to exert pressure against East. Compare Example 11 with Example 4, which shows the same basic position. The unblocking solution remains the same even if the East and West hands were interchanged. The play, prior to the squeeze card, of the winner that blocks South's threat is called the Vienna coup. The term has long been regarded as unduly connoting brilliance: \\"In short, the aura of glamor which has always seemed to surround this play is wholly fictitious.\\"Clyde E.

The first two were Worthington and Brewster. All three towns appeared on the map in 1871, though Bigelow remained nothing more than that - a spot on a map - until the spring of 1872, when the tracks of the St. Paul & Sioux City Railway reached the site of the present- day town. Throughout the summer of 1872, the site was occupied only by a large tent which furnished shelter for the construction crew. A railroad depot was constructed in September 1872, and Mr. S. O. Morse assumed duties as station agent. He went into partnership with a man named Frothingham, and the two established a small grocery store in the depot. This was the only business established in 1872. Source of name: Even before railroad tracks had reached present-day Bigelow, the town's future name had been decided. It was named after Charles H. Bigelow. He was also a director of the St. Paul & Sioux City Railway, and the board decided to flatter him by naming a new town after him. Bigelow Township was also named after Mr. Bigelow. There is no record of Charles Bigelow visiting the town that bears his name, though it is likely he passed through on the railroad that he helped to create. Incorporation: The townsite was platted and a dedication was made on September 24, 1873. Two new business came to town in 1873. S. D. Tinnes opened a general merchandise store and John DeBoos and John Colvin opened a hardware store. A grain dealer, a lumber yard, and a coal business were established in 1874. A school house was also built in that year and began that fall with 24 students. The village grew slowly. The 1880 census gave Bigelow a population of only 28. (One must assume that many of the 24 students enrolled in the Bigelow school resided on farms outside of the village.) Charles L. Davidson, of Hull, Iowa, purchased the townsite on January 25, 1892, and decided to \\"boom the town\\", or attract investment and settlers. His efforts apparently paid off, for by 1894, Bigelow claimed 150 residents. A census taken on November 16, 1899, counted 224 residents. On February 13, 1900, an election was held, and by a vote of 37 to 6 it was decided that the time had come for municipal government. The first president of Bigelow was a Mr. W. C. Wyatt.A. P. Rose's History of Nobles County Bigelow today: According to the 2010 census, Bigelow has a population of 235. Perhaps a half-dozen businesses exist in the town. In recent years, Minnesota State Highway 60, which once passed directly through town, was upgraded to four-lanes, and bypassed Bigelow entirely. Bigelow does not have a public school. Children attend school either in nearby Worthington or in Ellsworth. Minnesota's open-enrollment law gives them this option.

It was the first town established in Nobles County by the St. Paul and Sioux City Railroad, and was named after General Samuel F. Hersey, a lumber baron from Maine, and one of the railroad's directors. The first resident was W. R. Bennett, who came to take charge of the railroad station. T. J. Smith put up the first store which was run by A. J. Timlin for many years. Mr. A. O. Conde established a lumber yard and a grain business, Martin Heiser opened a second store, a hotel was opened by a Mr. Humphrey, and John Iverson established a blacksmith shop. All of this occurred in 1872, the same year that A. J. Timlin became postmaster. Source of name: In 1880, the St. Paul and Sioux City Railroad was purchased by the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway, or the Omaha Road, and there was already a station named Hersey on the latter road's track in Wisconsin. In order to avoid confusion, the name of Hersey was changed, briefly to Nobles County Station. Soon thereafter, the name Brewster was settled upon. There is some confusion regarding the choice of name. E. F. Drake, president of the St. Paul and Sioux City Railroad once stated that the name \\"was changed to Brewster after a director of the Omaha Road.\\" But a brochure later put out by the Chicago and North Western Railway Company stated that \\"the present name was given in honor of Brewster, a town in Barnstable County, Massachusetts, which was named in honor of Elder William Brewster, one of the first settlers of Plymouth Colony.\\" Incorporation: By the fall of 1898, it was found that 180 people lived in the community of Brewster. Thus it was decided that the time had come for incorporation. An election was held on December 14, 1898, and out of the 28 ballots cast, only one was opposed to idea of municipal government.

The first station out of Heron Lake was proposed in the extreme northeastern corner of Nobles County, and was originally named Warren, in honor of Joseph Warren who fell at the Battle of Bunker Hill. The town was surveyed and platted in July 1879, and construction of a depot began on August 13. Mr. G. Foils moved to town and assumed duties of stationmaster on September 1. He was also named postmaster when a post office was established on November 1, 1879. It was at this time that the name was changed to Dundee, after the city of Dundee, Scotland. The reason for the name change is lost to history, although it is known that stationmaster/postmaster G. Foils (whose first name is also lost to history) made the change. A Scottish Company known as the Dundee Improvement Company was then financing construction of an elevator, general store, and hotel in nearby Kinbrae, and perhaps Mr. Foils thought he could attract investment in Dundee. The first business was opened in the spring of 1880 by F. D. Lindquist and H. A. Scherlie. Several homes were also built in that second year, but real growth for Dundee did not occur until the late-nineties when the country began to recover from the Panic of 1893. A census taken on December 23, 1897, gave the village a population of 187. At this time, citizens petitioned for incorporation, and on January 4, 1898, the county commissioners granted their request.

The township was organized in 1873, though settlers had taken up residence in the township as early as 1871. One of these early settlers is known in history only as \\"Uncle\\" Stillwell. Mr Stillwell made a claim to the land where Ellsworth now stands, and he established a small store on his farmstead, supplying the needs of local farmers. He also operated a peddler's wagon in the vicinity. Mr. Stillwell had great confidence in the future of the region, and often remarked that a town would one day be located on his property, or very near to it. However, Stillwell packed up and left the area two years before the town of Ellsworth was eventually established in 1884. Ellsworth sits on Stillwell's former claim, and the business district of the town is located less than 1/2 mile west of Stillwell's cabin.A. P. Rose's History of Nobles County A new railroad town: The town of Ellsworth was named in honor of Eugene Ellsworth of Cedar Falls, Iowa, and came into existence as a result of construction of the Burlington Railroad in the summer of 1884. The site was selected by agents of the Cedar Rapids, Iowa & Northwestern Land & Town Lot Company. The site was surveyed by F. D. Randall, and dedication of the plat was made on September 29, 1884, by S. L. Dows and James B. Close, president and secretary, respectively, of the town lot company. When the rail line was completed, a box car was set off to the side, and this served as a depot until a more substantial structure could be built. The first structure in town was a saloon completed by Sam Stevens and Phil Lattenberger in September 1884. Construction of a dozen or more buildings were started at this same time, and before the close of the year, the booming town had about 150 inhabitants. During the winter of 1884‚Äì85, the Ellsworth postoffice was established with B. F. Garmer as postmaster. In the early fall of 1886, the town was selected as a division point of the Burlington railroad. The company built a five-stall roundhouse, put in a turntable, erected a substantial depot, and built a branch line from Ellsworth to Rock Rapids, Iowa. Incorporation: The necessary steps were taken to bring about incorporation at a county board meeting held in Worthington on December 10, 1886. An election was held on January 13, 1887, and municipal government began in February. The census of 1890 gave Ellsworth a population of 258. The population in 2000 was 540.

The first township meeting occurred April 21, 1871. The township was named for East Graham Lake and West Graham Lake which are entirely within the township's borders. These lakes were first noted on Joseph Nicollet's 1842 map based upon his explorations of the late 1830s and early 1840s. Nicollet named the lakes after Joseph Duncan Graham. Graham served as a commissioner for the survey of the northeast segment of the boundary between the United States and Canada from 1840 until 1843.Names of Nobles County by Raymond Crippen In the month of May, 1867, a pioneer named Stephen Muck pushed out into the unsettled Graham Lakes region and squatted on land on the bank of West Graham Lake. When surveyed, this land proved to be on section 22 of Graham Lakes Township. There he built a log structure from timber growing near the lake, the first house of wood in the county. In the fall of 1867, Muck brought his family from Jackson County, Minnesota. He earned his livelihood by trapping for a few years, then turned to farming. He lived continuously on his farm from 1867 until the time of his death in 1897. Stephen Muck was the very first permanent resident of Nobles County.A. P. Rose's History of Nobles County p. 329 The first town to appear on any map of Nobles County was a curious place called Gretchtown. According to an 1856 map - a map drawn 11 years before the arrival of Stephen Muck - Gretchtown was located on the south bank of West Graham Lake, very near to Muck's claim. Rumors of a railroad to be built through southwestern Minnesota had circulated in the 1850s, and even though no survey had been taken for the railroad, the town of Gretchtown had been created - at least on paper - to serve as a stopping point. When Nobles County was formally created by the Minnesota legislature on May 23, 1857, Gretchtown was briefly designated as the county seat of Nobles County, a county at that time without any residents.Minnesota Statutes, 1858 See sections 183 and 192A. P. Rose's History of Nobles County p. 38 When a route for the St. Paul and Sioux City Railway was surveyed in 1871, it was located far south of the Graham Lakes region. No towns or villages existed in Graham Lakes Township until 1879 when Kinbrae and Dundee were established. Neither town grew beyond a few hundred residents. Thus, the Graham Lakes region has remained entirely rural, and the lake shores of both East Graham Lake and West Graham Lake remain undeveloped.

A rail station was proposed for the Graham Lakes region, and the site selected was briefly named Airlie in honor of David Ogilvy, the 10th Earl of Airlie. The Earl was president of the Dundee Improvement company, a Scottish company formed for the purpose of founding a town in southwest Minnesota. In September and October 1879, Oglivy's company built a steam elevator with a capacity of 16,000 bushels, a hotel, and a general store building in Airlie. The Dundee Improvement company played no role in founding the nearby town of Dundee. In fact, the towns of Kinbrae (Airlie) and Dundee, though separated by a mere 1/2 mile, were rivals, built along the roads of competing rail lines. Change of name: When the site was surveyed in December 1879, Airlie was formally rechristened DeForest. A depot and a post office were both constructed in 1880 even though the census showed a mere 19 residents. The depot was known as DeForest Station, but the post office was known as Airlie until January 1882 when the name was formally changed to DeForest. The steam elevator was wiped out by fire on April 20, 1883, and this spelled the end of the Dundee Improvement Company's involvement. As a historical footnote, David Ogilvy's granddaughter Clementine Hozier was married to Winston Churchill from 1908 until his death in 1965. Kinbrae: In August 1883, DeForest Station, the townsite, and the post office were renamed Kinbrae. Little is known about the name Kinbrae, other than that it is Scottish. Ownership of Kinbrae passed into the hands of Hanson & Graeger, a Chicago land-colonization firm, but the company showed little interest in development of the new town. The townsite was then sold to W. N. Bickley and W. E. Fletcher in 1895, who made great efforts \\"to boom the town,\\" or to attract businesses and residents. By 1896, Kinbrae boasted two general stores, a hardware store, a lumber yard, two elevators, a blacksmith shop, a hotel, a bank, a creamery, two churches (Methodist and Presbyterian), and a school.A.

A site for a railroad station was chosen in fall of 1882, and the initial choice of name was Indian Lake, after the township in which it was located. However, a wealthy Chicago Board of Trade operator named Mr. O. H. Roche donated of land for a townsite, and it was his wish that it be called Round Lake. Mr. Roche owned nearly of land on nearby Round Lake in Jackson County, and he was apparently fond of the name Round Lake. A town was platted in December 1882 and the site was divided into 100 lots, not one of which were sold. Only two buildings were built in that first year, and both were constructed by the railroad. The railroad section foreman and his crew were the only residents of the new town, until October 1883 when E. A. Tripp came to town to assume duties as station agent. A post office named Indian Lake was established in March 1884, and Mr. Tripp became the postmaster. When another post office with the name Round Lake (located on Round Lake in Jackson County) was closed, the post office in the town of Round Lake assumed the name of that town. A few businesses moved to town, but by 1887, the town had a mere 34 residents. In 1889, the town was re-platted, correcting some legal issues with the original plat, and real growth began. Nine years later, Round Lake boasted numerous businesses, a bank, a newspaper, and 179 residents. Residents voted to incorporate the town, and on October 11, 1898, the first election was held, and town government began under President A. F. Diehn. A new $2,000 school was erected at this time.A.

The town owes its existence to the construction of the Worthington and Sioux Falls Railway, and the desire of a New York capitalist to establish a land colonization scheme in southwestern Minnesota. When the Worthington and Sioux Falls Railway was initially surveyed, it was decided to construct a station house in section 19 of Dewald Township. The station house was Named Miller Station, in honor of ex-governor Stephen Miller, and for two years it had no inhabitants. In 1878, George I. Seney, a New York capitalist, secured control of large plots of railroad land in Dewald and Olney Townships. He immediately began the process of colonizing the lands, bringing out settlers from New York City and other eastern points. On May 27, 1878, a Mr. S. M. Rushmore arrived in Worthington along with his family, and immediately took a train for Miller Station. There he established a store to serve Mr. Seney's flood of colonists. A railroad depot was also constructed, and the town was surveyed and platted. In August 1878, the town was renamed Rushmore in honor of the pioneer shopkeeper, and the community grew rapidly. Indeed, a business directory from the fall of 1879 shows that Rushmore had a general store, a feed mill, an elevator, a hotel, a hardware store, a grocer, a lumber agent, a tinware dealer, a notion store, a jeweler, and two blacksmiths.

The town was named after the township in which it was located‚Äîsort of. Willmont Township (note the double-L) was established in 1878. There was a general disagreement over the township name, one faction wishing to call it Willumet, and the other favoring Lamont. On November 22, 1878, a compromise was reached, and the township was formally named Willmont. For twenty-one years, the residents of Willmont Township lacked convenient railroad transport. That all changed in the summer of 1899 when the Burlington Railway surveyed a new route extending northwest from Worthington. Railroad right-of-way man Thomas H. Brown selected a site for a new town and named it Wilmont. He made a point of spelling the new town with one L to distinguish it from Willmont Township. The railroad was completed on December 16, 1899, and hundreds of newcomers soon took up residence. The survey was made, and the plat was dedicated on January 22, 1900. A Post Office was established on February 13, 1900. In April 1900, the first saloon was established in Wilmont by the Stuntebeck Brothers. Construction of a new school was approved in September 1900 with the school opening two years later. When the town celebrated its first birthday in December 1900, the town boasted two churches (Presbyterian and Catholic), three saloons, and nearly two dozen other businesses. The date and reason for Willmont Township's name change from Willmont (double-L) to Wilmont (single-L) remains obscure. Minnesota State Highway 266 was constructed in 1949, connecting Worthington, Reading, and Wilmont. Responsibility for this highway was transferred to Nobles County in 2003. It has been renamed Nobles County Road 25. The Burlington Railway later was taken over by the Rock Island Railroad. This line was closed, and the tracks torn up, in the 1970s. Wilmont once boasted both public and Catholic schools. However, the town's last school closed in the 1970s. Children are currently bused to schools in Worthington, Adrian, or Fulda. Minnesota's open- enrollment law allows Wilmont residents this choice. Despite having no school, railroad, or state highway connection, Wilmont remains a thriving community of 332 residents. As in 1900, life in Wilmont revolves around the town's churches and saloons.

Eyota is a city in Olmsted County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 1,977 at the 2010 census. History Eyota was platted in 1864. The name Eyota is derived from the Sioux Indian word iyotak, meaning \\"greatest\\" or \\"most\\". A post office has been in operation at Eyota since 1864. The city was incorporated on February 16, 1875. Settlers had begun arriving in the area and staking claims in 1854. The earliest, Benjamin Bear, initially came in 1853 to choose a prime site with an ever-flowing spring, then returned the following year with his family. A stream called Bear Creek starts from this spring. (Today Chester Woods Lake is formed around a portion of Bear Creek that was held back behind a dam built to protect nearby Rochester from flooding.) In the early years Eyota was an important destination for business travelers and mail, and shipping point for locally raised grain and cattle. It was located only a mile from a wye with rail extensions going north to Plainview and south to Chatfield, making Eyota a stopping point for travelers on their way to other places. (Daily trains to Chatfield and Plainview left from the Eyota depot.) The railroad was an important local employer, The railroad later became the Chicago & North Western Railway. Eyota streets were laid out on the farmland of Milo Matteson by investor Samuel E. Everett, a speculator from New York State. A downtown district, built only on the south side of the street, faced the busy railroad yard. A large hotel, frequented by business travelers, called the Everett House, was located along this street (South Front Street). Charles P. Russell, another early investor, built a store on the corner of South Front Street and Center Avenue in 1865. Russell continued living in the community (whereas Mr. Everett soon moved on). He built a fine two-story home and bought grain from local farmers with his business partner O.H. Jackson. Years later, in 1910, Charles Russell partnered in the banking and mercantile businesses with his son, Fred Russell. A whole line of stores flanked on the ends by the C.P Russell building and the Everett House faced the railroad depot and yard to the north. Establishments included hardware, lumber, wagon and harness makers, livery, drug store, general mercantile, hotels and several saloons. Doctor Augustus Stinchfield was Eyota's first medical doctor, who came to town after Eyota druggist E.D. Dyar invited him to visit. Both Stinchfield and Dyar once lived in Strong, Maine. Dr. Stinchfield built up an extensive practice, having another office in nearby St. Charles and using part of his home as a hospital. Stinchfield married Martha Bear, the daughter of early settler Benjamin Bear. He arrived in 1873 and left in 1892 when the Mayos from Rochester convinced him to become the first non-family member to partner in their practice. Dr. Rollo C. Dugan, the son of local settler Elijah Dugan, followed Stinchfield's local practice. He built the Eyota Hospital, an eight-bed facility on Second Street in 1900.
