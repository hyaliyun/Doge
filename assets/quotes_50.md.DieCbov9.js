Created by Jessica Ladd, the organization has developed a website that allows users to submit a time stamped record of the alleged offense, and if another individual files a report about the same perpetrator, will alert the authorities. The site uses a third party encryption software to flag the reports of the victims. Since its release, Callisto has received criticism for its policies towards reporting to authorities and over concerns of its database being hacked.  The Process  When users report alleged assaults, they have the opportunity to be in an environment they feel comfortable in. The reporters are encouraged to take breaks so that they do not become overwhelmed. The report does not have to be in chronological order. No one will be able to access the report, unless the filer grants access. Once the report has been submitted, there are three outcomes. The system will notify the authorities as well as the college, only if two victims report the same assailant. The reporter may forward the record to the school. If the victim chooses, they may take the report to the authorities.  Reception  Callisto is considered a tool in helping to reduce sexual assault. Other methods for reducing this crime include an online sexual assault course that colleges require students to take, apps that students can download to tell them local crime hot spots and more. Most colleges have “blue light poles” in case of emergency, and have a night ride service so that no one has to walk alone. Callisto’s biggest competitor is Lighthouse. Callisto’s approach is sensitive to trauma when reporting. Callisto had an app at one point, but took it down so that there was no shame in having it on your phone. It is now only offered online 24/7 so it is easily accessible and confidential. Callisto believes that there is safety in numbers and that no one is alone. = Criticism = Since the data collected from Callisto is stored on a database by a third party, critics are worried that this information could potentially be hacked and the victims identities revealed. There is not a guarantee that just because you report to Callisto, your case will be investigated. Since there has to be at least one match to alert the authorities, the cases that never get matched will never be ingested through Callisto. Callisto would like victims to produce some form of identification when reporting, such as the perpetrators Facebook page, email, or phone number. Analysts do not like this aspect of the website, as gathering personal information about the attack could be overwhelming, or even trigger the victim. Callisto could be accused of crowd-sourcing, taking away from the individual and their story  References   External links   Category:Sexual violence ","title":"Callisto (project)"},{"id":"58627048","text":"Emidio is a given name.

Generally they are small, synthesised molecules that bind competitively to the ATP-site of the tyrosine kinase domain. VEGFR-2 selective inhibitor can interrupt multiple signaling pathways involved in tumor, including proliferation, metastasis and angiogenesis. __TOC__ VEGFR The VEGF receptor family contains three members, which are all receptor tyrosine kinases (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3). VEGFR-1, or FLT-1 (fms-like tyrosine kinase), are important for hematopoietic stem cell development, VEGFR-2 (KDRor FLK-1 (fetal liver kinase)) are vital to vascular endothelial cell development and VEGFR-3 (FLT-4) for lymphatic endothelial cell development. Binding of VEGF to the VEGFR induces a conformational change in the receptor producing a signaling pathway. VEGFR-2 VEGFR-2 is a 210-230 kDa glycoprotein expressed in vascular endothelial cells and in hematopoietic stem cells and binds VEGF-A. VEGFR-2 is closely related to VEGFR-1 for they have common and specific ligands but VEGFR-2 is a highly active kinase while VEGFR1 is an impaired receptor tyrosine kinase. This receptor is a regulator in responses in the endothelial cells of VEGF. These regulations include permeability, proliferation, invasion and migration. The signaling pathways, Y1175 and Y1214, are the main autophosphorylation sites of the human VEGFR-2 followed by VEGF binding. Autophosphorylated VEGFR-2 is required for activation of several downstream pathways, which are hyperactivated in some tumors. These signaling pathways are important in tumor angiogenesis, which stimulates tumor growth by supplying the tumor with oxygen and nutrients. VEGFR-2 is overexpressed in several cancers, for example ovarian, thyroid, melanoma and medulloblastoma. Structure VEGFR-2 are a part of the VEGF family. The other receptors in the family are VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-3. These receptors are a type of transmembrane kinase receptors and have similar structure. They have an extracellular part that is made up of an N-terminus signal and a 7 immunoglobulin-like domain. The intracellular part of the receptor consists of a juxtamembrane (the tyrosine kinase domain), which is divided to proximal and distal kinase domains and a C-terminus tail. Medical Uses Sorafenib is used as an oral drug which inhibits angiogenesis and tumor cell growth in VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 (inhibits the phosphorylation), PDGFRβ (platelet-derived growth factor receptor), RAF kinase, FLT3 (Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3) and KIT (stem cell factor receptor). Sorafenib is used in the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma. As of October 2018, it is in phase III of clinical trials for hepatocellular carcinoma, metastatic melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Sunitinib is an oral drug that inhibits the phosphorylation of all the VEGF receptors, PDGFR-ß, KIT FLT3, CSF1R and GDNF. Sunitinib is used in the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, which binds selectively to VEGF receptor. It is used as an injection therapy, often in combination with other drugs. It is used in combination with 5-fluorouracil as a first-line treatment of metastatic carcinoma in the colon or rectum. In advanced non-small cell lung cancer bevacizumab (Avastin) is used as a first-line treatment in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin. It can also be used in the treatment for breast cancer and kidney cancer. Lenvatinib and vandetanib are used for the treatment of progressive and locally advanced differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Pazopanib and axitinib are used orally for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma. Cabozantinib has the same indication but it is only used on patients who have already received an anti-angiogenic therapy. Regorafenib is administered orally for the treatment of colorectal cancer, gastrointestinal stromal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. Nintedanib is used for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Tests for liver function have to be made to modify doses before the therapy can start. Apatinib is used for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer. It is often diagnosed in lage stages because there are no early signs or symptoms. Mechanism of action Binding to VEGF receptor induces dimerization, which modifies the conformation in the intracellular domain. This modification leads to the exposure of the ATP- binding site, which causes ATP binding on the receptor and also transphosphorylation on specific tyrosine residues. Tyrosine phosphorylation on the receptor is regulated by internalization, degradation and by dephosphorylation through different protein tyrosine phosphatases. This can then lead to the initial receptor signal transduction cascade, which activates several downstream enzymatic pathways. The signaling inhibition of VEGFR is through tumor vessels and not the tumor cells. Reduction of VEGF expression reduces blood flow to tumor and stops tumor angiogenesis. Adverse Effects VEGF inhibitors in the treatment of cancer often cause adverse effects. Treatment with VEGF inhibitors suppresses cellular signalling pathways that are important in microvasculature regulation and maintenance. The effects on normal organs can then lead to vascular disturbances and regression of blood vessels. FDA has approved three drugs, bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib, that were developed for antiangiogenic actions and are used in the treatment of patients with specific cancer types. All of these drugs have the mechanism of inhibiting VEGF signalling by blocking either the function of the VEGF ligand or VEGF receptor. Bevacizumab is a function-blocking monoclonal antibody that binds selectively to VEGF. Generally it is well tolerated and safe but can have adverse effects which can be intensified by chemotherapeutic agents used at the same time. For bevacizumab the most common adverse effects are hypertension, epistaxis, proteinuria, upper respiratory infection, stomatitis, diarrhea or other symptoms from the gastrointestinal tract as well as dyspnea, fatigue and dermatitis. Serious adverse effects connected to bevacizumab are infrequent but among those listed are gastrointestinal perforation, arterial thromboembolic events, hypertensive crisis, neutropenia, complications with wound healing, haemorrhage, nephrotic syndrome, heart failure and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome. Sunitinib is a small molecule inhibitor which inhibits phosphorylation of VEGF receptor among other receptors. Sunitinib is mostly well tolerated. Common adverse effects which have an incidence rate of 20% are fatigue, asthenia, diarrhea, nausea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, constipation, hypertension, skin discoloration, altered taste, stomatitis and mild bleeding. Sorafenib is a small molecule inhibitor of many tyrosine kinase receptors such as VEGFR-2. Side effects are in most cases mild to moderate such as rash, hand-foot skin reaction, diarrhea and dermatitis, and occur in about 33-38% patients using sorafenib. Other side effects are mild hypertension, leukopenia and bleeding. Uncommon side effects are cardiac ischaemia or infarction, gastrointestinal perforation, life- threatening haemorrhage and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome. Hypertension is one of the most common side effects regarding inhibition of VEGF signalling. VEGF increases synthesis of NO through upregulation of endothelial NO synthase and therefore inhibition of VEGF diminishes NO synthesis. Decrease in NO causes vasoconstriction, increased peripheral resistance and increased blood pressure. Hypertension caused by VEGF inhibition can usually be treated with oral antihypertensive agents. Proteinuria is common when VEGF signalling is inhibited which shows how important VEGF is for normal renal function. VEGFR-2 can be found on the glomerular capillary endothelial cells and is activated by VEGF. Proteinuria is in most cases asymptomatic and usually decreases when treatment ends. Impaired wound healing can be an adverse effect of VEGF inhibition as angiogenesis is an important step in wound healing. Gastrointestinal perforation can be caused by VEGF inhibition although the mechanism is unknown. Abscesses, diverticula as well as bowel resection and anastomosis have been related to some cases. Haemorrhage and thrombosis can occur when VEGF is inhibited as VEGF promotes endothelial cell survival and helps maintaining vascular integrity. When VEGF is inhibited, the regenerative capacity of endothelial cells may diminish and pro-coagulant phospholipids could be exposed on the plasma membrane or the underlying matrix, possibly leading to either thrombosis or haemorrhage. Since VEGF increases production of NO and prostacyclin, the inhibition of VEGF leads to decrease in both chemicals which contributes to thromboembolic events. Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy is often attributed to hypertensive encephalopathy as well as endothelial dysfunction. This can cause focal cerebral oedema, vasospasms, and even a breakdown in the blood-brain barrier. Inhibition of VEGF is implicated as a factor in the pathophysiology of the disease but has not yet been replicated after VEGF inhibition in preclinical models. Endocrine dysfunction has been reported as an adverse effect of VEGF inhibition. Hyperthyroidism is one such, since thyroid function can be damaged by capillary regression around the follicles of the thyroid. The fenestrated capillaries of the pituitary, adrenal cortex and pancreatic isle have also been known to regress as an effect of VEGF inhibition. The thyroid- hypothalamic feedback loop can also be impaired due to VEGF inhibition, followed by raised TSH blood concentration. Interactions  Lenvatinib inhibits the liver enzyme CYP3A, which also happens to be a metabolic enzyme for the drug. It inhibits the UDP-glucuronosyltransferases UGT1A1 and UGT1A4. Lenvatinib induces CYP3A but not UGT1A1 and UGT1A4. Use of other drugs, especially ones metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A, should be monitored in case their plasma concentration changes. In vitro studies have shown that lenvatinib inhibits organic anion transporters 1 and 3 (OAT1 and OAT3). Sunitinib is metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4. It interacts with inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A4 leading to a decrease or increase in the plasma concentration of particular drugs metabolized by the same pathway. It will not change the amount of drug metabolized by the enzyme, because it does not inhibit or induce the enzyme directly. Sunitinib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein and ABCG2 transporters. It acts as an inhibitor for both transporters, especially for ABCG2. Therefore, drugs that are substrates of these carriers will have modified pharmacokinetics. Plasma concentration of sorafenib and paclitaxel may be increased when the drugs are co-administered along with carboplatin. This has no effect on carboplatin. It also increases the AUC of docetaxel, doxorubicin and irinotecan but decreases the AUC of fluorouracil and neomycin, so it is cautionary to administer sorafenib with these drugs as it may alter the plasma concentration. Sorafenib is metabolized by CYP3A4 and UGT1A9. This means that drugs metabolized by these pathways have to be carefully administered. Sorafenib's inhibition of UGT1A9 and UGT1A1 may increase plasma concentration of other drugs. The same goes for the CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 pathways, they are inhibited by sorafenib. Giving sorafenib in combination with rifampicin or inducers of CYP3A4 can decrease plasma concentration of sorafenib. CYP3A4 inhibitors are unlikely to affect sorafenib. Sorafenib is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. It inhibits P-glycoprotein, therefore it can increase the plasma concentration of drugs which are P-glycoprotein substrates. Pazopanib is metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4 enzyme. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, other than pazopanib, can increase the plasma concentration of pazopanib, and CYP3A4 inducers will do the opposite. Grapefruit juice is a CYP3A4 inhibitor and should be avoided when taking pazopanib. It is also a weak inhibitor of other liver enzymes, CYP2C8 and CYP2D6. Axitinib is metabolized by CYP3A4 and UGT1A1. Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 will increase the plasma concentration of axitinib, while weak inhibitors have less effect on the plasma concentration. Strong inducers of CYP3A4 will decrease the plasma concentration of axitinib and should be avoided. Pipeline drugs Lucitanib is a tyrosine kinase activity inhibitor, highly selective for VEGFR types 1-3, FGFR types 1-2 and PDGFR alpha/beta. Tumor types such as breast carcinoma show amplification of fibroblast growth factor related genes. Simultaneous inhibition of VEGF and FGF receptors in FGFR1 dependent tumors could be therapeutically advantageous. Lucitanib has been shown to have promising efficacy, a manageable side-effect profile and clinical benefits in both FGF-aberrant and angiogenesis-sensitive populations leading to a phase II program being planned. Motesanib is a small-molecule multikinase inhibitor highly selective for VEGFR 1-3, PDGFR and KIT. The drug has shown anti-tumor activity as a monotherapy in advanced solid tumors. Vatalanib is an antiangiogenic VEGFR inhibiting molecule which is being researched as a potential treatment of solid tumors. Vatalanib inhibits VEGFR 1-4 although it has greater potency as an inhibitor of VEGFR 1-2. At concentrations under 10 μM, Vatalanib does not have cytotoxic or antiproliferative effects on cells that do not express VEGF. Specific inhibition of tumor-induced angiogenesis like the inhibition by Vatalanib can both prevent ongoing growth of tumors and the metastatic potential. Cediranib is a multi VEGFR 1-3 inhibitor being tested as a maintenance treatment for patients with platinum sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer. Cediranib stops blood flow to the site of the tumour and thereby inhibits its growth. Quinalone structure Structure-activity relationship (SAR) =Quinoline and quinazoline-derivatives= Quinazoline structure Lenvatinib, Vandetanib and Cabozantinib are drugs that belong to this group. Novel biphenyl tricyclic quinazoline compounds and aryloxy quinolone derivatives are multiple kinase inhibitors. They are less likely to lead to drug resistance than selective inhibitors, which increases life expectancy. 4-quinazolinamine heterocyclic compounds and 2-chloro-4-anilino-quinazoline derivatives inhibit tumor vessel generation and restrain EGFR, HER-2, VEGFR-2 and mitosis process. Quinoxaline derivatives with a diaryl-amide or diaryl-urea substructure have B-Raf mutant kinase inhibition activity. Some novel quinazoline derivatives inhibit Raf kinase selectively and have less effect on inhibition of VEGFR-2 and EGFR kinase. A scaffold in position N1 on quinolone and quinazoline derivatives behaves as a hydrogen bond receptor and interacts with Cys919 residue. The terminal substituent aromatic ring can form hydrophobic bonds with the hydrophobic pocket of VEGFR-2, especially the terminal phenyl group substituted by chloride in the para-position. Quinolone-urea containing VEGFR inhibitors will bind to Asp1046 residue of the receptor via the carbonyl oxygen, and interact with Glu885 residue via two NH groups. =Urea derivatives= Urea structure. Urea derivatives on the market are Regorafenib and Sorafenib. The urea derivatives block the VEGFR and/or one or more protein kinases and can therefore modulate, regulate and/or inhibit tyrosine kinase signal transduction. Increased stability against degradation by liver enzymes can be acquired by adding a deuterium to heterocyclic compounds. Novel urea compounds with pentafluoro-sulfane substitute on a phenyl group show better protein kinase inhibition in diseases like cancer when compared to aryl-urea compounds with either quinazoline or pyrimidine moieties. N-substituted phenyl N’-substituted heterocyclic urea compounds give an IC50 between 15 nM and 1 μM for VEGFR-2. Having a 1H-indole-1-carboxamide scaffold on aryl-urea compounds results in added VEGFR-2 potency and selectivity and gives an IC50 of 3nM against the receptor. =Indolin derivatives= Indolin structure.Indolin derivatives on the market are Sunitinib and Intedanib. Two indol derivatives that target the VEGF pathway, semaxanib and sunitinib, have been developed. The former is potent but was inefficient in clinical trials and the latter has many side effects. There is need for a drug with pharmacological effects similar to semaxanib and sunitinib, but it needs to be less toxic. MPEG3-9-semaxanib is semaxanib with an additional water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer attached to it via a spacer moiety. MPEG3-9-semaxanib derivatives are 10 times more active against VEGFR-2 than sunitinib. Compounds with sunitinib heterocyclic moiety but different amide side chains inhibit VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 and regulate disorders. Another compound with sunitinib heterocyclic moiety and a pyrrole side chain has very good VEGFR-2 potency, with an IC50 of 65 nM. N-indol-1-amide compound is a possible anti-tumor drug in combination with other anticancer treatment and has an IC50 value of 31 nM. There are many indol derivatives with different side chains that target multiple kinases and take part in several pathways in tumor development. Intedanib is a multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor and is the first drug to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Indol derivatives with 1-NH of 2-indolinone motif that is an H-bond donor, and 2-carbonyl oxygen that acts as an H-bond acceptor, bind with Glu915 and Cys917, respectively. These compounds have basic amine side chains or nitrogen heterocycles and provide ideal solubility and pharmacokinetics. These compounds are promising anti-cancer and anti-fibrosis agents, inhibiting various protein tyrosine kinases. They have higher efficiency, lower toxicity, fewer side effects, favorable preparation technology and favorable physicochemical properties. =Pyridine derivatives= Pyridine structure.Pyridine derivatives on market are axitinib, regorafenib and apatinib. Pyridine derivatives with thiazolyamino-substituted heterocycle derivatives are kinase inhibitors. They show antiangiogenesis activity and anti-proliferation in tumor cells. The presence of sulfur atom in the heterocyclic ring is hypothesized to enhance potency on VEGFR-2 inhibition. Compounds with thieno [3,2-b] pyridine urea moiety are inhibitory for VEGF receptor signaling and HGF receptor signaling. HGF and HGF receptors undermine the activity of VEGF inhibition. Pyridine derivatives with benzazepine have stronger selectivity and anti-tumor activity and less toxic side effects. They target many receptors like c-Met, VEGFR2, EGFR and therefore show inhibitory activity on a variety of tumors. Compounds with no fluorine atom in the benzazepine inhibit multiple targets and have better in vitro enzyme inhibiting activity. 3-chloro derivatives and 3-methoxy-N-methyl-2-pyridine carboxamide derivatives inhibit, modulate and regulate tyrosine kinase signal transduction. VEGFR2 related diseases are treated with the compounds mentioned above in conjugation with other cancer therapies. 1-(5-tert-butyl-2-aryl- pyrazol-3-yl)-3-[2-fluoro-4-[(3-oxo-4H-pyrido[2,3-b] pyrazin-8-yl) oxy] phenyl] urea compounds are RAF inhibitors and treat disorders associated with mutated forms of RAF, like cancer, proliferative disorders, inflammation, immunological disorders, viral infections and fibrotic disorders. =Pyrimidine derivatives= Pyrimidine structure.Pazopanib is a multi- targeted tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor. The structure is formed by indazole, pyrimidine and a benzene ring. If the indazole ring is kept the same, replacing 5-amino-2-methylbenzenesulfonamide with another arylamine at position 2 of the pyrimidine, gives inhibitory effect on VEGFR-2 and c-Kit. For R2, two groups can show this effect on the compound, an ether group on one, and on the other a chloride group. When substituents are added on pazopanib with different electronic effects at the benzene ring the inhibition to the kinase changes. Regarding the steric effect on position R1 and R2, a hydrogen in position R1 and a trifluoro-ether in R2 have the most inhibitory effect on VEGFR-2, which can be the effect of the electronegative groups. There is a steric hindrance of the indazole heterocycle, which can play an important role in the interaction with the tyrosine kinase receptor inhibition. Mechanism of pazopanib from indolin derivative. =Other small molecule VEGFR inhibitors= 3-amino-5-phenylisothiazole derivative.Conjugated 3-(indolyl)- and 3-(azaindolyl)-4-arylmaleimide compounds can induce apoptosis in cancer cells and therefore may have use in cancer therapy, including colorectal and gastric adenocarcinoma. Oxetane 3,3-dicarboxamide compounds are possible inhibitors of tumor angiogenesis and metastasis, and may also be effective against viral infections. A 1,6-naphyridine-4-ketone fused heterocyclic derivative inhibits various kinases and the activity of tumor cells. The antifungal drug itraconazole may be and inhibitor for VEGFR-2 and could be used in treatments that VEGFR-2 plays a role. 3-phenyl-5-ureidoisothiazole-4-carboximide and 3-amino-5-phenylisothiazole derivatives inhibit, modulate and regulate tyrosine kinase signal and can be used for treatment of disorders that are caused by unregulated tyrosine kinase signal transduction, including cell growth, metabolic and blood vessel proliferative disorders. Thioether derivatives can be used to treat all forms of cancer and target multi target protein kinase inhibitors. Pharmacology =Pharmacokinetics= Pharmacokinetics of Quinoline and quinazoline- derivatives Absorption is variable within the group, with tmax ranging from 1–4 hours for Lenvatinib to 4–10 hours for cabozatinib. Food can slow down the absorption rate but should not affect the extent of the absorption. All drugs have high protein binding, ranging from 90-99%. Vandetanib and cabozatinib are metabolized mainly by CYP3A4, while lenvatinib is metabolized by CYP450 and via other pathways. The drugs are eliminated mostly in faeces, but also in urine. Vandetanib has a half-life of 19 days, while cabozatinib’s half-life is 99 hours. Pharmacokinetics of urea derivatives Regorafenib and sorafenib reach mean peak plasma level in about 3 or 4 hours after a single oral dose. A high-fat meal decreases their absorption, while a low-fat meal may increase it, in comparison to taking the drugs in a fasting condition. In vitro protein binding is 99,5% for both drugs. The drugs are mainly metabolized in the liver by oxidative metabolism of CYP3A4, and glucuronidized by UGT1A9. Their half life ranges from 20 to 48 hours. Most of the administered dose should be out of the system in around 14 days. The drugs are mostly excreted in faeces, around 70-80%, but also in urine. Pharmacokinetics of indoline derivatives Sunitinib's peak plasma level is reached 6–12 hours post-dose. The drug is 95% protein bound and has a volume of distribution of 2230 L, which indicates distribution into tissues. Sunitinib is metabolised mostly by CYP3A4 and has a half life of 40–60 hours. Nintedanib reaches maximum plasma concentration 2–4 hours post-dose. The drug is 97,8% protein bound and is preferentially distributed in plasma. Only a minor part of the biotransformation of nintedanib is caused by CYP3A4 as the prevalent metabolic reaction for nintedanib is a hydrolytic cleavage of esterases. The half-life of nintedanib is about 10–15 hours. Pharmacokinetics of pyridine derivatives Axitinib has short half-life, ranging from 2.5 to 6.1 hours, and therefore steady state should be reached in 2–3 days after the first dose. Peak plasma concentration is reached in 2.5 to 4.1 hours. In vitro protein binding is over 99%. Axitinib is primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4/5. 30-60% of the drug is excreted in faeces, and about 23% in urine. Regorafenib is a pyridine derivative, but also a urea derivative and has therefore been covered in that section. Pharmacokinetics of pyrimidine derivatives Sunitinib structure. First small molecular VEGFR-2 inhibitor. Pazopanib reaches maximum plasma concentration 3.5 hours post-dose. Pazopanib is about 99% protein bound to human plasma protein. Metabolism of pazopanib is mediated primarily by CYP3A4 and the half-life of the drug is about 30.9 hours. Elimination of pazopanib is primarily with faeces. History Inhibition of angiogenesis including VEGFR-2 inhibitors has been of much interest and research in recent decades because angiogenesis is required for tumors to grow beyond a diameter of 1–2 mm. Many small molecular drugs and biological macromolecules targeting VEGFRs or blocking signal transduction of VEGF/VEGFR have been approved for clinical use or entered clinical trials. In 2004 the monoclonal antibody bevacizumab became the first VEGFR inhibitor to be approved for cancer therapy. The first small molecular VEGFR-2 inhibitor to be approved was sunitinib in 2006.

Dick's was one of Dublin's most famous and long lasting coffeehouses, established by Richard Pue in the late 17th century, at some point before July 1698. Pue was a bookseller and owned one of Ireland's earliest newspapers, Pue's Occurences. Dick's was housed in Skinner's Row (now Christchurch Place), on the drawing room floor of Carberry House, which had previously been the home of the Earl of Kildare. The London bookseller, John Dunton, held auctions in Dick's in 1698. Pue ran his printing workshop from the same premises, printing for a number of Dublin publishing houses. Thomas Bacon held auctions in Dick's from the 1760s, and printed his paper the Dublin Gazette from there for a time. Land and property auctions were also held from Dick's from the 1730s. The printer and bookseller, Sarah Cotter, operated from the coffee house from 1751 to 1774, taking over from her brother who worked from there from 1744 until his death in 1751. The customers of Dick's were described in 1740: \\"Ye citizens, gentlemen, lawyers and squires, Who summer and winter surround our great fires, Ye quidnuncs! who frequently come into Pue's, To live upon politicks, coffee, and news.\\" After Richard Pue's death in 1722, his wife Elizabeth ran the coffee house and printing business, which in turn their son Richard took over from her by 1731. The business then passed to Richard's nephew, James Pue and his wife Sarah. The coffee house closed around 1780, when Carberry House was demolished.

From the mythical story of the war of the Pallantidae against Theseus, we learn that the demoi of Pallene, Gargettus, and Agnus were adjacent. When Pallas was marching from Sphettus in the Mesogaea against Athens, he placed a body of his troops in ambush at Gargettus, under the command of his two sons, who were ordered, as soon as he was engaged with the army of Theseus, to march rapidly upon Athens and take the city by surprise, But the stratagem was revealed to Theseus by Leos of Agnus, the herald of Pallas; whereupon Theseus cut to pieces the troops at Gargettus. In consequence of this a lasting enmity followed between the inhabitants of Pallene and Agnus.Plutarch, Thes. 13; Philochor. ap. Schol. ad Eurip. Hippol. 35. The road from Sphettus to Athens passed through the opening between Mount Pentelicus and Mount Hymettus. A monastery there by the name of Ieraka (or Hieraka) is the site of Gargettus. The proximity of Pallene and Gargettus is indicated by another legend. Pallene was celebrated for its temple of Athena; and we are told that Eurystheus was buried at Gargettus in front of the temple of Athena Pallenis.πάροιθε παρθένου Παλληνίδος, Euripides, Heracl. 1031.

The mortar utilized a new nickel-steel alloy of greater strength than other cast cannons, though it lacked a recoil mechanism. While the gun was more effective than previous models, it was soon phased out because of improved field artillery and counter-battery fire, though it remained in service in limited numbers throughout the war because of heavy German losses.  History  = Background = The majority of military planners before the First World War were wedded to the concept of fighting an offensive war of rapid maneuver, which in a time before mechanization meant a focus on cavalry and light horse artillery firing shrapnel shells. Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Western Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. The theorists hadn't foreseen that trenches, barbed wire, and machine guns would robbed them of the mobility they had been counting on, and like in the Franco-Prussian and Russo-Turkish wars the need for high-angle heavy artillery to deal with fortifications reasserted itself. Since aircraft of the period were not yet capable of carrying large diameter bombs, the burden of delivering heavy firepower fell on the artillery. The combatants scrambled to find anything that could fire a heavy shell, meant emptying fortresses and scouring depots for guns held in reserve. It also meant converting coastal artillery and naval guns to siege guns by either giving them simple field carriages or mounting the larger pieces on rail carriages. = Service = The Mrs 99 was designed in 1893 and built by Krupp in 1899. The Mrs 99 was a successor to earlier 21 cm mortars that had been in service since the Franco-Prussian War. The Mrs 99 was fairly conventional for its time and most nations had similar mortars such as the Mortier de 220 mm modèle 1880 or Mortaio da 210/8 D.S. However, its lack of recoil mechanism made it dated, and by the time the First World War broke out it had been largely made obsolete by the 21 cm Mörser 10. In 1914, it was estimated that 48 were in service with reserve units. However, it was brought back into service due to a combination of higher than expected losses and insufficient numbers of heavy guns which led to them being issued as replacements to heavy field artillery battalions. Each battery consisted of four guns with four batteries per battalion. Design The Mrs 99 was a short barreled breech-loading mortar on a rigid garrison mount which consisted of a U-shaped gun cradle which held the trunnioned barrel. Like many of its contemporaries, its carriage did not have a recoil mechanism. The barrel was a typical built-up gun of the period with all steel construction. The gun had an early form of horizontal sliding-block breech and it fired separate-loading bagged charges and projectiles. The Mrs 99 could fire a variety of different projectiles which the later Mörser 10 also used. The advantage the Mrs 99 had over its predecessors was that it was made from nickel-steel of much greater strength than previous guns made of cast bronze or cast iron. This meant that the Mrs 99 could be smaller in diameter, lighter in weight, fire heavier projectiles, and have longer range. However, field artillery also improved during that time and the threat of counter-battery fire led to the Mrs 99 being phased out soon after its introduction. For transport, the Mrs 99 could be broken down into two separate wagon loads for the barrel and gun cradle. At the front of the gun cradle, a two-wheeled wooden spoked axle was attached and the rear of the cradle was then hooked up to a limber so the mortar could be towed by a horse team or artillery tractor. The barrel was towed on its own four-wheeled wagon with an integral hoist to mount/demount the barrel. Once on site, the axle was removed and a set of small wheels could be fitted to the front of the gun cradle. A piece of ground was then leveled, a wooden firing platform was assembled, and the mortar was placed on the firing platform. The mortar could then be connected to an external recoil mechanism which connected to a steel eye on the firing platform and a hook on the carriage between the wheels. Two wooden ramps were then placed behind the wheels and when the mortar fired the wheels rolled up the ramp and were returned to position by gravity. There was also no traversing mechanism and the gun had to be levered into position to aim. A drawback of this system was the gun had to be re-aimed each time which lowered the rate of fire.

The team plays in the Israeli National League. History =Elitzur Netanya (1959–1998)= Elizur Netanya was promoted to the first league in 1985. In their first season, the team qualified for the playoff finals against Maccabi Tel Aviv but lost both games in the Playoffs. Among the most prominent stars of Elitzur Netanya were: Willie Sims, Carl Neverson, Terry Fair, Danny Bracha and Jimmy Hall. In their second season in the first division, the team finished in fourth place. In their third season, the team qualified for the Israeli Basketball State Cup finals, but the team was defeated by Hapoel Galil Elyon. In the 1988–89 season, the team struggled against the relegation to the second division, but finally the team finished in tenth place and secured their place in the first division. However, the team could not open the next season and in fact did not appear at all due to heavy debts and the team relegated to the lower leagues. In total, the team played for four consecutive seasons (1985–1989) in the first division. =Barak Netanya (1998–2005)= At the end of the 1998 season, Elitzur was merged with Maccabi Netanya and renamed \\"Elizur Maccabi Natanya\\". One year later, they decided to add to the club's title the name \\"Barak\\", following a plane crash incident of Netanya's fan - Zvi Barak, who entered into coma. From 2000 to 2006, Netanya climbed back from League A (Fourth-tier division) to the Liga Leumit (Second-tier division). In the 2006–07 season, the team was close to promote to the Israeli Basketball Premier League but they were eliminated by Elitzur Kiryat Ata in a playoff series for the third place leading to the Premier League. In the 2007–08 season, Netanya led the Liga Leumit's table, losing only one game during the regular season. In the playoffs, They defeated Hapoel Tivon, Hod Hasharon and Hapoel Afula in the Playoffs and was promoted back to the Premier League. In the 2009–10 season, Netanya reached the Israeli League Final Four as the fifth seed. Netanya defeated Maccabi Haifa 3–1 in the Quarterfinals, but eventually they lost to Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Semifinals. In the 2010–11 season, Netanya reached the 2011 Israeli State Cup Finals, but they lost to Maccabi Tel Aviv. In the summer of 2014, Netanya was relegated to Liga Leumit due to financial difficulties. In the 2014–2015 season, Netanya finished the Liga Leumit regular season as fifth seed, but they were eliminated in the playoff semifinals by Ironi Kiryat Ata. On July 21, 2015, Barak Netanya was dissolved due to financial issues. =Elitzur Netanya (2016–present)= In the summer of 2016, the team was re-established and changed their name to \\"Elizur Netanya\\" and played in the Liga Artzit. In the 2016–17 season, Netanya led the Liga Artzit's and reached the finals, but they eventually lost to Maccabi Kiryat Motzkin.

From the mythical story of the war of the Pallantidae against Theseus, we learn that the demoi of Pallene, Gargettus, and Agnus were adjacent. When Pallas was marching from Sphettus in the Mesogaea against Athens, he placed a body of his troops in ambush at Gargettus, under the command of his two sons, who were ordered, as soon as he was engaged with the army of Theseus, to march rapidly upon Athens and take the city by surprise, But the stratagem was revealed to Theseus by Leos of Agnus, the herald of Pallas; whereupon Theseus cut to pieces the troops at Gargettus. In consequence of this a lasting enmity followed between the inhabitants of Pallene and Agnus.Plutarch, Thes. 13; Philochor. ap. Schol. ad Eurip. Hippol. 35. The road from Sphettus to Athens passed through the opening between Mount Pentelicus and Mount Hymettus. A monastery there by the name of Ieraka (or Hieraka) is the site of Gargettus. The proximity of Pallene and Gargettus is indicated by another legend. Pallene was celebrated for its temple of Athena; and we are told that Eurystheus was buried at Gargettus in front of the temple of Athena Pallenis.πάροιθε παρθένου Παλληνίδος, Euripides, Heracl. 1031. We know further that Pallene lay on one of the roads from the city to Marathon. Between the monastery of Ieraka and the small village of Charvati, a celebrated inscription respecting money due to temples was discovered , and which was probably placed in the temple of Athena Pallenis.Böckh, Inscr. n. 76. In Ieraka there was also found the boustrophedon inscription of Aristocles, which probably also came from the same temple.Böckh, n. 23. In one of the churches nearby, George Finlay found the following inscription fragment: ΞΕΟΦΑΝΗΣ ΠΑΛΛΗΝΕΥΣ - XEOPHANES PALLENEUS. This situation, where the roads of the Mesogaea necessarily unite in approaching Athens, is such a point as would be important, and often occupied in military operations; and accordingly, we find that on three occasions in the early history of Athens, Pallene was the scene of action; first, when Eurystheus fought against the Athenians and Heracleidae; again, when Theseus was opposed to the Pallantidae; and a third time when Peisistratus defeated the Alcmaeonidae. The inscription, however, in such a case, is not decisive evidence of location, as material may be moved (see spolia). Agnus is placed by Ludwig Ross in the hollow which lies between the extreme northern point of Hymettus and Ieraka. William Martin Leake, on the other hand, fixes it at Markópulo, in the southern part of the Mesogaea, because Finlay found at this place an inscription, .... υλίδης Ἀγνούσιος - ... ylides Agnousious. Modern scholars favor the Markopulo location, and fix the site as southwest of Markopoulo Dardiste. Notable among the ancient articles related to Agnus is the Fragment from the tomb of Nikarete; Nikarete was a daughter of Ktesikles of Agnus.

It is a proactive protocol based on distance vectors and operates on IEEE 802.15.4, optimized for multi-hop and many-to-one communication, but also supports one-to-one messages. This protocol is specified in with special applications in RFCs . RPL can support a wide variety of link layers, including those with limitations, with potential losses or that are used in devices with limited resources. This protocol can quickly create network routes, share routing knowledge and adapt the topology in an efficient way.  Protocol configuration  RPL creates a topology similar to a tree (DAG or directed acyclic graph). Each node within the network has an assigned rank (Rank), which increases as the teams move away from the root node (DODAG). The nodes resend packets using the lowest range as the route selection criteria. Three control messages are defined in ICMPv6 via : * DIS (information request DODAG): Used to request information from nearby DODAG, analogous to router request messages used to discover existing networks. * DIO (object of information of the DAG): Message that shares information from the DAG, sent in response to DIS messages, as well as used periodically to refresh the information of the nodes on the topology of the network. * DAO (object of update to the destination): Sent in the direction of the DODAG, it is a message sent by the teams to update the information of their \\"parent\\" nodes throughout the DAG.  Implementation of the RPL protocol  The implementation of the RPL protocol occurs in wireless sensors and networks, the most used operating system for its implementation is Contiki which is a small open source operating system developed for use in a number of small systems ranging from 8-bit computers to integrated systems on microcontrollers, including sensor network nodes.  Other Operating Systems  The RPL protocol is implemented in other operating systems, such as: *LiteOS is an edition of the Zorin OS operating system designed for low- resource computers, developed in principle for calculators, but which has also been used for sensor networks. *TinyOs was the first operating system oriented to the wireless sensor network (WSN), works through events and guided tasks, and uses an extension of the C language, called nesC. TinyOS is implemented as a set of cooperating tasks and processes and it determines the priorities between tasks and events. *T-Kernel is an operating system that accepts applications as executable images in basic instructions. Therefore, it will not matter if it is written in C++ or Assembly language. *EyeOS is defined as a desktop environment based on Web, which allows monitoring and access to a remote system through a simple search engine. *RIOT is a small operating system for networked, memory-constrained systems with a focus on low-power wireless Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

In a jarring mix of aesthetics, memorial and documentation, the sculptures juxtapose familiar International Style architectural grids and objet d'art scale and beauty against the reality of rubble, collapse and (undepicted) death. Ruttan's decisions to leave some of the buildings intact on one side—thus portraying the transition and path from whole to collapse—and to place others on low tables organized like city-block grids had a similar effect, positioning viewers to embody time and destruction as they moved around the work. Critics linked the uncomfortable, God's-eye view to a distanced, perhaps American perspective, interpreting the works overall as a reflection on the failures of modernism, reason, and basic empathy. For Line in The Sand/Highway of Death (2013–4), Ruttan created a 30-foot by 12-foot diorama of more than 600 ceramic pieces and sand. The installation depicted the aftermath of a 1991 U.S.-Canadian bombing raid on a 60-mile stretch of highway between Kuwait and Basra, which killed hundreds of retreating Iraqi military and civilians. Set low to the ground in a Chicago Cultural Center exhibition (2015), it recreated for visitors a bird's eye view chillingly akin to that of the bombing pilots. Lisa Wainwright described the piece's \\"horrific gestalt\\" as an \\"instance of the sublime,\\" alternating between pleasure and horror, seduction and repulsion, and aesthetics and politics. In her \\"An Unmaking\\" works (2018), Ruttan has sought to close the gap between her damaged architectural forms and domestic life, as well as between the sites of carnage and American viewers.

A positive phobic response is one in which either activity is increased or the organism moves toward the stimulus, while a negative phobic response is when activity is decreased or the organism moves away from the stimulus. On the bacterial level, phobotaxis is regularly seen in accordance with phototaxis, random movement in response to light. In the protobacteria Rhodospirillum rubrum, the presence of ferric ion does not create a favorable wavelength of light for physiological activity. This elicits a positive photophobotactic response where the protobacteria moves towards blue and near-UV light. While the phobic response is classified as a photophobotactic response, the photochemical product of ferric complex in medium acts as a chemical stimulus, making this an example of chemotaxis as well. In the eukaryote Euglena, positive phototaxis and positive phobotaxis exhibit nearly the same action spectra, providing more evidence for their association. There also exists evidence to support photophobotaxis being coupled with electron transport needed in photosynthesis for two specific algaes: Phormidium uncinatum and Ph. autumnale. While there does not exist much evidence of phobotaxis in response to tactile stimuli, there is evidence to suggest species will respond in ways that will maximize necessary resources such as food. An experiment that simulated trail movements of trace fossils in the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition showed that those who engaged in phobotaxis, as in avoiding trails which indicate already exploited areas, gained more resources and had higher search efficiency. This foraging for resources involves changes in patchiness, which combines gravitaxis, movement in response to changes in gravity, and chemoreception to identify the spatial pattern of odors and move in response to chemical gradients.

Missouri is a leading producer of lead from minerals formed in Paleozoic dolomite. Geologic history, stratigraphy and tectonics The oldest rocks in Missouri are igneous and metamorphic crystalline basement rocks formed during the Proterozoic through the accretion of volcanic island arcs to the southern shore of the proto-North American continent of Laurentia. Rocks formed from 1.7 to 1.6 billion years ago are primarily known from deep boreholes in the north of the state, but are universally deeply buried by thick layers of sedimentary rock. Younger igneous rocks formed from magma in the south between 1.5 and 1.4 billion years ago. In places, magma intruded preexisting basement rock and then erupted at the surface as volcanoes along the Laurentian coastline. Granite and lava flows remain in the St. Francois Mountains from this period. Middle Proterozoic basement rocks are cut by the Central Missouri Tectonic Zone and Grand River fault zone, both of which are hypothesized to be the remnants of boundaries between small plates. Magma often moves along these fault zones. Between the two zones is the Missouri Gravity Low, or MGL, a mass of low density granite including the Missouri batholith up to 370 miles long and 60 miles wide, identified in gravity surveys. Igneous activity ended around 1.3 billion years ago, with the intrusion of numerous dikes and sills into newly crystallized rhyolite and granite. Although not directly impacting the current boundaries of Missouri, the Midcontinent Rift System formed from 1.2 to one billion years ago as mafic lave erupted in a rift zone spanning Lake Superior through Iowa to Kansas. Laurentia was included in the supercontinent Rodinia from one billion to 541 million years ago and no new rock formation took place in Missouri. Failed rifting of the continent produced the Reelfoot Rift, which extends beneath the Mississippi Embayment to the southeast lowlands of the state and intersects the Missouri Gravity Low, creating the New Madrid Seismic Zone. =Paleozoic (541–251 million years ago)= Sloss sequences—long-running changes in sea level, described by American geologist Lawrence Sloss—played an important role in sediment deposition during the Paleozoic. The Sauk sequence formed during the Cambrian, followed by the Tippecanoe in the Ordovician, the Kaskaskia between the full immersion of the Silurian and the early Mississippian. Finally, the Absaroka sequence emplaced into the early Pennsylvanian. The Great Unconformity separates Proterozoic igneous rocks from the Lamotte Sandstone, the basal unit of the Sauk sequence which also includes the Bonneterre Dolomite, Davis Formation, Derby-Roe Run Dolomite, Potosi Dolomite and Eminence Dolomite from the Cambrian, and the Ordovician Gasconade Dolomite, Roubidoux Formation and Jefferson City Dolomite. The Tippecanoe comprises the St. Peter Sandstone, Joachim Dolomite, Plattin Limestone, Decorah Shale, Kimmswick Limestone, and an unconformity, followed by the Girardeau Limestone (only in the southeast), Maquoketa Shale and northeast Missouri Noix Limestone. Silurian Tippecanoe rocks include only two units: the Bainbridge Formation in the southeast and Bowling Green Dolomite in the northeast. Devonian Kaskaskia rocks include the Chattanooga Shale in the southwest, Cedar Valley Limestone, split by an unconformity and separated from Mississippian rocks by a second unconformity, with numerous small shale and limestone units in the east. A complicated sequence of shale, sandstone and limestone follows from the Carboniferous. Sedimentary petrologists have debated why dolomite is so prevalent in Missouri relative to limestone, even though marine conditions often favor limestone formation. Only a few dolomite beds formed after the Middle Ordovician and few are younger than the Joachim Dolomite. Fault fractures suggest that groundwater altered limestone to dolomite, replacing calcium with magnesium. =Mesozoic (251–66 million years ago)= The Zuni sequence formed in the Mesozoic, during a fifth major marine transgression lasting from the Middle Jurassic into the Cretaceous. The Cretaceous geochronology of the state is unclear and debated, between some who believe the state experienced dryland conditions and others who suspect it was flooded. The only Cretaceous deposits are unconsolidated marine and delta sands together with clay in the Southeast Lowlands, beneath Pleistocene alluvium. Previously, small circular deposits of Cretaceous clay in the Ozarks were suspected to be the remains of sinkholes in Ordovician dolomite. However, recent fossil discoveries suggest possible small lakes and ponds. =Cenozoic (66 million years ago – present)= A final marine transgression called the Tejas sequence took place in the Cenozoic. Aside from clay and both delta and marine sandstone in the Crowley Ridge, deposited in the subsiding Mississippi Embayment, there are no Paleogene rocks in the state. The Midway Group deposited in the Paleocene, rich in bentonite, followed by the Eocene Wilcox Group, which contains terrestrial sandstone and clay laden with plant fossils. In unglaciated parts of the state and beneath Quaternary deposits in the north is the Pliocene Mounds Gravel, unconformably atop older rocks and sediments. The Mounds Gravel remains as gravel alluvium from the Teays River, which once flowed north of current day St. Louis transporting sediments shed by the rising Rocky Mountains. Some geologists have suggested that the Mounds Gravel originated from erosion of the Central Highlands, when a large river flowed south through Kansas and Oklahoma to the Gulf of Mexico, until it was rechanneled to the present Mississippi River during the Illinoian glaciation. As Missouri experienced terrestrial erosion in the Pliocene, the Ozark Dome uplifted. Missouri did experience the Pleistocene glaciations, with the most recent glacial till from 600,000 years ago. A small lobe of ice pushed across the Mississippi River in the vicinity of St. Louis 200,000 years ago. The route of the Ancestral Kansas River rapidly eroded and filled with sediment in the area of Kansas City during periods of glacial melting and outwash. Till in northern Missouri is up to several hundred feet thick, sometimes containing cobbles and boulders, with an overall tan to red-brown color. 38th Parallel Lineament The Thirty-Eight Parallel Lineament is one of Missouri's unique structural features, a 10- to 20-mile wide area of folds, faults and shattered bedrock from the Kansas state line to Vernon County to the Mississippi River in Ste. Genevieve County. It contains the widespread Ste. Genevieve Fault and pockets of Paleozoic rock—particularly eight locations with broken, but rearranged groupings of igneous and sedimentary rocks together. Hypotheses suggest possible origins ranging from cryovolcanoes to pent up gas tearing through Paleozoic rocks and bringing up more ancient igneous rocks. Natural resource geology Galena is the official state mineral of Missouri and lead mining began in the 1720s in Madison County, spearheaded by French miners. The state is the leading extractor of lead in the US, both from galena and sphalerite. The minerals are sourced from Mississippi Valley Type deposits, deposited through hydrothermal activity. The Old Lead Belt and Tri-State Area were mined significantly before World War II, with new deposits found since in the southeast. The new deposit is known as the Viburnum Trend and spans Iron County and Reynolds County, with secondary production of copper, cadmium and silver, housed in the Bonneterre Dolomite between 600 and 1500 feet deep. During the late Cambrian, stromatalite beds shielded carbonates forming below and created a permeable interface for mineralization.

It was established by the Chicano labor leader Cesar Chavez as the unofficial newspaper of the United Farm Workers (originally National Farm Workers of America) during the Chicano/a Movement of the 1960s and early 1970s. Published in both English and Spanish editions, El Malcriado provided a forum for migrant workers to criticize working conditions and served as a way to organize the collective voice of Mexican American farmworkers. The newspaper's contents ranged from articles on union activities, coverage of labor issues, political commentary, cartoons, satire, and artwork. It is an example of ethnic press or alternative media that developed from political movements and immigrant communities within the United States to challenge existing power structures and gain political leverage.  Circulation  El Malcriado was a primarily biweekly newspaper. Initially, copies were available for ten cents only at local grocery stores in Mexican American neighborhoods in the California Central Valley. Over time, the newspaper earned a list of paying monthly subscribers and expanded its audience to cities ranging from the Bay Area to Los Angeles In September 1965, El Malcriado published 3,000 copies in Spanish and 1,000 copies in English. The popularity of the grape strike and the publication of both Spanish and English editions caused the paper's audience to increase dramatically. After 1965, El Malcriado began to publish more copies in English than in Spanish (as much as 8,000 English copies and 3,000 Spanish copies) and continued to target an audience of English speaking Mexican American farm workers raised in the United States. The newspaper's readership peaked at 18,000 subscribers.  Publication History  = Origin = As early as 1962, Cesar Chavez and the NFWA discussed creating a newspaper. Chavez believed a newspaper was essential to politically organize uneducated farmworkers and provide a unifying voice for the movement. However, Chavez wanted to keep the paper separate from the NFWA to protect the union from being sued by growers. As a result, El Malcriado was published as a separate entity under the Farm Worker Press. In English, El Malcriado roughly translates to \\"the ill-bred one,\\" \\"the brat,\\" \\"the bad boy,\\" or \\"troublemaker.\\" Chavez borrowed the name from a newspaper that ran during the Mexican Revolution. The title of Chavez's newspaper was therefore meant to reflect the rebellious spirit of the farmworker movement. = 1964-1965 (Early Period) = In 1964, Chavez hired Andy Zermeño as the first staff member of El Malcriado, putting him in charge of graphics and illustrations, and later hired Bill Esher as the first editor. Although the newspaper officially became a separate entity from the NFWA after Esher arrived as editor, El Malcriado still remained politically in line with the union's goals. While Esher served as editor, Chavez remained heavily involved in translating and writing articles. The first eighteen issues were written in Spanish; beginning after issue eighteen, El Malcriado was published in both Spanish and English editions.Guerrero, Carlos Reyes. (2003) Silent No More: The Voice of the Farmworker, 1964-1975 (Phd). Claremont Graduate University. Chavez eventually hired Doug Adair, a young political activist, in 1965 to be in charge of the paper's English edition. During first six months of the newspaper's existence, El Malcriado mostly focused on encouraging its readers to become NFWA members. However, as a result of the grape strikes led by the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC), in the summer of 1965 El Malcriado grew more radical and actively promoted striking. In one article, the newspaper provided instructions for new strikers. In another article, the writers promoted striking as the best method for laborers to obtain power. El Malcriado helped spread news and boost morale for protesting farm workers during the Delano Grape Strike. The paper printed copies of Jack London’s essay, “Definition of a Strikebreaker” in response to scabs. The popularity of the grape strike led to a spike in the newspaper's readership. In 1965, The FBI targeted El Malcriado after Chavez and the NFWA were accused of communist infiltration. The FBI used an article from El Malcriado as evidence to J. Edgar Hoover that the NFWA and Cesar Chavez were influenced by communism. They subsequently offered $1,000 for anyone that could provide information on communist infiltration of the NFWA or El Malcriado. = 1966-1967 (Rift Between Chavez and Newspaper Staff) = Between 1966 and 1967, the paper's main audience expanded from farmworkers to a broader coalition of sympathizers in cities from the Bay Area to Los Angeles. As the paper grew, Chavez found that El Malcriado began to show an independent streak and often clashed with the paper's staff on certain issues. One point of conflict was over the 1966 California Governor Race, during which El Malcriado refused to endorse incumbent governor Pat Brown. Chavez, the NFWA, and the AFL-CIO agreed to support Pat Brown over his opponent Ronald Reagan. The staff of El Malcriado meanwhile had grievances with Brown for his bringing contracted Mexicans into California and accused him for being a traitor to Mexican Americans and farmworkers. Another point of contention was over U.S. intervention in Vietnam. Despite the change in national attitude towards the war, the AFL-CIO, the UFWOC, and many farm workers were largely pro-war and supported President Lyndon B. Johnson. Chavez was strategically silent on the issue, and to avoid divisiveness, he urged Doug Adair and El Malcriado to remain neutral on the Vietnam War. Going against Chavez's orders, Doug Adair and the staff of El Malcriado openly expressed their opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam and criticized the draft. In one issue, El Malcriado published a photo of Mexican American GIs and a letter by a Mexican American GI urging fellow Mexican Americans to oppose the war. Chavez became increasingly frustrated with the newspaper's staff and their disobedience. Both Bill Esher and Doug Adair noted Chavez's growing irritability and eventually left the paper. The last issue of El Malcriado in its first incarnation was published in August 1967; the paper went bankrupt after that. = 1968-1976 (Revivals and Death of El Malcriado) = In 1968, El Malcriado was purchased by the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee, the new union, which combined the NFWA and AWOC, and consequently controlled much of the newspaper's content. Doug Adair returned as the paper's editor. After numerous revivals and cessations, Chavez began to gradually phase the newspaper out after 1971, as he believed it no longer served the movement's interests.Adair, Doug. (2009). El Malcriado (1964-1970) Analysis. University of California, San Diego  Content and Themes  = Journalism = Many articles in El Maclriado reported the corrupt practices of employers and labor contractors. For example, the newspaper helped expose a corrupt labor contractor named Jimmy Hronis, who was notorious for stealing wages from underpaid sugar beet workers. El Malcriado reported that Hronis was only paying workers fifty cents per hour, which consequently lead to state hearings in which a judge forced Hronis to pay back his employees. = Zermeño Cartoons = El Malcriado used cartoons and graphics to visually communicate ideas to its audience, since not all farmworkers were literate. To do this, he hired a Mexican American graphic artist named Andy Zermeño as the newspaper’s cartoonist. Zermeño and Chavez were responsible for the newspaper's iconic cartoon characters: Don Sotaco, Don Coyote, and El Patron or Patroncito. The magazine frequently depicted Don Sotaco, a misfortunate Mexican American farm worker, who was repeatedly exploited by his antagonistic boss, Patroncito. Don Sotaco represented the common Mexican-American farmworker without class consciousness. The character of Don Coyote represented the obsequious labor contractor and henchman of the grower. El Patron or Patroncito represented the grower and the owner of the fields and the boss of the farmworkers. The Don Sotaco cartoons informed the newspaper's audience on issues affecting Mexican- American laborers and helped raise a sense of class consciousness. Chavez and Zermeño hoped the newspaper's readership would identify with the character of Don Sotaco, and this would help educate farmworkers about their rights. The comics employed humor, satire, and irony to expose the exploitation of migrant farmworkers. = Connections with Other Political Movements = El Malcriado often displayed solidarity with other social justice causes and connected the farm workers’ movement to the larger Civil Rights Movement. In one article, the newspaper compared a rent strike occurring in Tulare County to the efforts made by Civil Rights activists in Alabama and Mississippi. In another article they compared the Delano grape strike to the Montgomery Bus Boycott. After the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., El Malcriado dedicated the entire April 15, 1968 edition to his legacy, highlighting his efforts in fighting for workers rights. The issue’s title asserted that King was killed for organizing workers and connected his legacy to the efforts of Mexican farm workers. El Malcriado also connected the struggles of migrant Mexican workers to the legacy of Mexican Revolution. For example, Chavez borrowed the newspaper’s title from another newspaper that ran during the Mexican Revolution. Covers of El Malcriado often featured engravings of Mexican peasant life and rural Mexico. At other times the magazine used images of Mexican Revolution era figures such as Emiliano Zapata and Pancho Villa. El Malcriado opposed the war in Vietnam. The newspaper demonstrated sympathy with the anti-war movement when it published an image of Mexican American GIs along with a letter from a Mexican American GI urging fellow Mexican Americans to oppose U.S. involvement in Vietnam.  Legacy  El Malcriado represents one of the first examples of Chicano/a press and influenced later Chicano/a newspapers for combining art, satire, and political commentary. An online archive of El Malcriado is available via the Farmworker Documentation Project at University of California, San Diego.

Established by a young generation of immigrant activists, presented left-wing beliefs. Chief editors of the paper were M. Sokołowski, and H. Anielewski.  Role of the Polish-language press in the immigrant community  The press, along with the Roman Catholic Church and political organizations, was one of the forms of leadership in the Polish immigrant community. In the beginning, the press was creating fewer leaders than the Church and other organizations as was mainly concerned with the political situation in Poland and was not paying much attention to organizing immigrants’ life in the USA. There were several newspapers in each settlement town and they often represented contradicting views, which made it difficult to coordinate a community. The Polish-American press was used as a tool to develop patriotism among former peasants. It played a major role in changing a peasant into an urban citizen. Many of the papers were targeting peasants and, after a while, working-class immigrants settled in urban areas of the USA. The first polish language newspaper, Echo z Polski, appeared in 1863 and closed two years later. There is no information about any other polish language publications in the United States in the following fifteen years. The next Polish periodicals appeared in the early 1870s. From the 1880s Polish press entered a phase of rapid development due to the growing immigrant population in the USA. The first dailies appeared in the late 1880s. The three main centers of the polish community and press were localized in big cities: Chicago, Milwaukee, and New York.  History  The first issue of Dziennik Ludowy was published in 1907 by Polish immigrants to the USA. In its first months, the newspaper supported Polish nationalist movement organized during the World War I. It was one of the most popular Polish language titles supporting the contemporary leader of the country- Jozef Pilsudski. After a split in the Polish- American socialist movement in 1908, the Polish Section of the Socialist Party was formed, and Dziennik Ludowy became the official organ of the Polish Socialist Alliance. It rejected the notion of military activity as a method of establishing an independent Poland proposed by Jozef Pilsudski. Instead, the newspaper focused on opening its columns to various Polish organizations, unions, and societies. Dziennik Ludowy supported the idea of establishing an independent Poland by promoting popular education and labor activism as a way of liberating the nation. The target audience of the newspaper was the first generation of immigrants, who did not speak English and strongly relied on the Polish language news. By 1925, when the daily stopped being published, the younger generation of Polish Americans was often educated in American schools and more accustomed to the American culture. Due to gradual Americanization younger people often chose English language newspapers, which contributed to decreasing readership of Dziennik Ludowy. The last issue was published on April 20, 1925, when it declared bankruptcy and was superseded by other Chicago-based titles.  Ideology  Dziennik Ludowy was an example of non-English press of the Socialist Party of America. The newspaper provided national and international news, focusing particularly on labor movements. It was concerned with issues of class struggle and informed about working-class conditions and ongoing strikes, concentrating on various ethnic groups of workers, not only Poles. The newspaper editors believed that the class struggle is the most important problem, while religion or ethnicity could divide and impede the working class movement. It enhanced solidarity within the working class from various ethnic backgrounds. The majority of Polish immigrants consisted of peasants coming from underdeveloped rural areas. After arriving at the USA they stayed in urban regions and tended to work in fabrics and manufactures. Their identity slowly changed from a peasant to a working-class man. A Polish immigrant worker identified himself, basing on his economic status, as a member of a larger labor movement, consisting of people of various ethnicities. Dziennik Ludowy became a platform for working- class men of different origins. The newspaper also supported the American Socialist Party, as its goal was to unite all workers and provide them with more social power. The daily was a platform that allowed organizing strikes, movement, and celebrations of a working-class immigrant in Chicago. One of the biggest meetings was organized on May 21, 1907, on Labor Day, when workers celebrated the labor holiday. Dziennik Ludowy allowed the organizers to reach the interested readers and spread the news among the working-class people. The editors of the daily saw the education as an important tool for creating a stronger immigrant community. Educating children was desirable and was seen as the best method of increasing skills and employability in the future. The newspaper promoted gaining proficiency in English language and achieving marketable skills as the most successful path to the advancement of peasant and working-class immigrants. As other publications of that time, Dziennik Ludowy was cooperating with other educational organizations such as parochial and ethnic schools or libraries.  Relation to other Polish-language press  Dziennik Ludowy was one of the five major Polish language newspapers in Chicago in the first half of 20th century. All titles tried to integrate Polish immigrants in the city, however, each of them promoted a different political view. They were divided over the issues of ideology, organizing of immigrants and the role of Catholic Church. Dziennik Ludowy, unlike other titles, was not associated with the institution of Church and its audience was not limited only to Poles. The newspaper was recognized as an aspect of cultural and educational activities organized by Polish socialist and national movements. Some of the other influential dailies that were being published over the same time period in Chicago were Dziennik Narodowy and Dziennik Zgoda.

Throughout its geologic history, Wyoming has been uplifted several times during the formation of the Rocky Mountains, which produced complicated faulting that traps hydrocarbons. Geologic history, stratigraphy and tectonics The Precambrian crystalline basement rocks of Wyoming include schist and gneiss in the Wyoming Craton, which formed during the Archean beginning 3. 6 billion years ago. The Wyoming Craton was sutured together with the Superior Craton and Hearne Craton during the Trans-Hudson Orogeny. The Wyoming Craton was a separate continent until it joined the proto-North American continent Laurentia 1.86 billion years ago. Along its southern margin, the Wyoming Craton is faulted against younger Proterozoic rocks from 1.7 billion years ago, which form the Front Range, extending into Colorado. The Mullen Creek-Nash Fork fault zone extends northeast to the Black Hills. =Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)= Shallow tropical seas dominated Wyoming during the Paleozoic. The Cambrian Gros Ventre Formation is made up of shale and limestone, overlain by the Ordovician Bighorn Dolomite and the Mississippian Madison Limestone. Small unconformities appear in the stratigraphic record due to periodic erosion or lack of deposition on the Wyoming shelf. During the Pennsylvanian, the uplift of the ancestral Rocky Mountains began, with a prong known as the Pathfinder uplift extending into Wyoming. However, most of the region was draped in erosion deposits, forming the Tensleep Sandstone. =Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)= More terrestrial conditions prevailed in the Mesozoic, with the deposition of Triassic red bed formations and mudstone in rivers, which bear well-preserved dinosaur fossils. During the Cretaceous, a renewed marine transgression produced the Western Interior Seaway forming sandstone and the thick, organic- rich Thermopolis Shale, Mowry Shale and Cody Shale, which are a major source of oil. =Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)= Dryland conditions have continued since the end of the Cretaceous, through the Cenozoic and the Laramide orogeny uplifted the Rocky Mountains through the Eocene. Wyoming has numerous Laramide orogeny-related thrust faults, which form the Wind River Range, Bighorn Range and Laramie Range, with more ductile sedimentary rocks folded over Precambrian igneous rocks at the core of each range. This foreland deformation is particularly visible in Clarks Fork Canyon, the Beartooth Range and the Gros Ventre Range. Large quantities of oil and gas are held beneath the anticline formations formed by the west dipping, low angle faults of the overthrust belt. Large coal beds formed as highlands eroded throughout the Paleocene, burying organic material. In the Fort Union Formation, coal beds are as much as 100 feet thick. Lake Gosiute and Lake Uinta were playa lakes in the Eocene, that accumulated the oil shale Green River Formation, which include numerous fossils visible at Fossil Butte National Monument. In the Shirley Basin, south of Casper, Wyoming, the Wind River Formation has a brilliant white color imparted by rhyolite ash fall in the Oligocene, Miocene and Pliocene from volcanic eruptions further west in the Basin and Range Province. Young Cenozoic rocks are well preserved in a downfaulted area in the Sweetwater Hills. During the last 2.5 million years of the Quaternary continued uplift has accelerated erosion, as the Teton Range formed and the Yellowstone Caldera formed in its present location.

He was the author of Perush Shelosh Esreh Middot or (Commentary on the Thirteen Attributes of God), and his most important work, the Sefer ha-Yiḥud (The Book of Unity, an explanation of the Tetragrammaton and the sefirot), which is the first Kabbalistic treatise to be preserved integrally. He identifies, on the one hand, the ten Sefirot with the ten spheres of the philosophers, and, on the other, explains the thirteen attributes of God as derivations of the three middle Sefirot: (love, justice, mercy), which he designates as fundamental principles. According to Gershom Sholem Asher ben David is the main transmitter of Kabbalistic doctrines to the Catalan rabbinic schools, and in particular the School of Girona, in the early thirteenth century.Scholem, Origins of the Kabbalah, Princeton, 1987, p. 252.

Morgan (born January 22, 1957) is an American linguist and professor of Hispanic linguistics at Ohio State University. He is a phonologist and dialectologist specializing in documenting linguistic diversity and developing methods for students, teachers, and other linguists to experience the sounds and structures of Spanish in the real world. His research includes work on phonetic and morphosyntactic variation on topics such as rhotics, voseo, the current usage of vosotros, and pedagogical approaches to phonetics.  Education  Morgan graduated from the College of William & Mary in 1979 with a B.A. in linguistics and a minor in computer science. During his undergraduate career, he studied abroad at the University of Valencia in Spain. After earning his M.A. in linguistics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Morgan went on to complete a Ph.D. in Hispanic linguistics at the University of Texas at Austin in 1984. His dissertation is entitled Consonant-Glide-Vowel Alternations in Spanish: A Case Study in Syllabic and Lexical Phonology, and was directed by Jean-Pierre Y. Montreuil.  Career  Morgan has been a professor of Hispanic linguistics at the Ohio State University since 1984. Additionally, Morgan has served as director of the Ohio Hispanic Heritage Project, and director of the Center for Latin American Studies at the Ohio State University. Morgan published the Spanish phonetics textbook Sonidos en contexto: Una introducción a la fonética del español con especial referencia a la vida real in 2010. He has also co- edited two volumes, written book chapters, and published articles in journals such as Spanish in Context, Probus, and Studies in Romance Linguistics. He has delivered keynote addresses at conferences such as the Foreign Language Association of Virginia and Laboratory Approaches to Spanish Phonetics and Phonology and presented at the Hispanic Linguistics Symposium, the Workshop on Spanish Sociolinguistics, the Asociación de Lingüística y Filología de América Latina, and the Sociolinguistics Symposium, among others. Morgan has received multiple awards, including the Carnegie Foundation's Ohio Professor of the Year, the Alumni Award for Distinguished Teaching (awarded twice), and the Friend of the Foreign Language Association of Virginia Award. Morgan is the creator of the website Voices of the Hispanic World, an interactive collection of interviews with people from around the Spanish-speaking world designed to give Spanish teachers and students a way to experience Spanish dialects firsthand. = Summer Seminars Abroad for Spanish Teachers = In 1991, Morgan founded the Ohio State University Summer Seminars Abroad for Spanish Teachers (SSAST), an intensive two-week seminar that teaches primary and secondary school teachers of Spanish about Hispanic linguistics. The seminar has been held throughout the Spanish-speaking world. Previous locations include Cuernavaca, Mexico; Quito, Ecuador; San José, Costa Rica; Valencia, Spain; Santiago de los Caballeros, Dominican Republic; Santiago, Chile; Asunción, Paraguay; Antigua, Guatemala; Cochabamba, Bolivia; Granada, Nicaragua; Córdoba, Argentina; Lima, Peru; Barranquilla, Colombia; and Havana, Cuba.  Personal life  Morgan grew up in Hampton, Virginia, where he graduated from Kecoughtan High School in 1975.

Modern archaeology is the discipline of archaeology which contributes to excavations. Johann Joachim Winckelmann was one of the founders of scientific archaeology and first applied the categories of style on a large, systematic basis to the history of art. He was \\"the prophet and founding hero of modern archaeology\\". The next major figure in the development of archaeology was Mortimer Wheeler, whose highly disciplined approach to excavation and systematic coverage in the 1920s and 1930s brought the science into the modern era. Wheeler developed the grid system of excavation, which was further improved on by his student Kathleen Kenyon. The two constant themes in their attempts to improve archaeological excavation were first, to maintain strict stratigraphic control while excavating (for this purpose, the baulks between trenches served to retain a record of the strata that had been dug through), and second, to publish a record of the excavation promptly and in a form that would tell the story of the site to the intelligent reader. Bomb damage during the Second World War and subsequent rebuilding gave archaeologists the opportunity to meaningfully examine inhabited cities for the first time. Bombed sites provided windows onto the development of European cities whose pasts had been buried beneath working buildings. Urban archaeology necessitated a new approach as centuries of human occupation had created deep layers of stratigraphy that could often only be seen through the keyholes of individual building plots. In Britain, post-war archaeologists such as W. F. Grimes and Martin Biddle took the initiative in studying this previously unexamined area and developed the archaeological methods now employed in much cultural resource management and rescue archaeology. Archaeology increasingly became a professional activity during the first half of the 20th century. Although the bulk of an excavation's workforce would still consist of volunteers, it would normally be led by a professional. It was now possible to study archaeology as a subject in universities and other schools, and by the end of the 20th century nearly all professional archaeologists, at least in developed countries, were graduates of such programs. New technology Undoubtedly the major technological development in 20th century archaeology was the introduction of radiocarbon dating, based on a theory first developed by American scientist Willard Libby in 1949. Despite its many limitations (compared to later methods it is inaccurate; it can only be used on organic matter; it is reliant on a dataset to calibrate it; and it only works with remains from the last 10,000 years), the technique brought about a revolution in archaeological understanding. For the first time, it was possible to put reasonably accurate dates on discoveries such as bones. This in some cases led to a complete reassessment of the significance of past finds. Classic cases included the Red Lady of Paviland. It was not until 1989 that the Catholic Church allowed the technique to be used on the Turin Shroud, indicating that the linen fibres were of medieval origin. Other developments, often spin-offs from wartime technology, led to other scientific advances. For field archaeologists, the most significant of these was the use of the geophysical survey. This encompasses a number of remote sensing techniques, such as aerial photography and satellite imagery. Also used is light detection and ranging (LIDAR), a technology that measures the height of the ground surface and other features in large areas of landscape with resolution and accuracy that was not previously available. Subsurface remote sensing techniques such as magnetometry and ground-penetrating radar enable an advanced picture to be built up of what lies beneath the soil before excavation even commences. The entire Roman town of Viroconium, modern day Wroxeter, has been surveyed by these methods, though only a small portion has actually been excavated. The application of physical sciences to archaeology, known as archaeometry or archaeological science, is now a major part of archaeology. Archaeology has also come to use geographic information systems, designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and visualize all types of geospatial data. The discovery in 1991 in the Ötztaler Alps of the prehistorical mummy dubbed Ötzi resulted in the techniques of genetics being brought to bear on archaeological science. With the help of DNA analysis, scholars were able to ascertain that Ötzi does not belong to any known human population. In the subsequent years, genetics has helped us reconstruct human migrations that occurred during prehistory.

It was released on February 19, 2008, through his own homemade record label, Rhyme Time Records, and later released physically by indie record label Animated Music. It is the most well known of all of his albums, gathering a strong cult following since its release. Viper himself has been quoted as saying it is his favorite album he has made. Background The album was recorded and produced between late 2007 to early 2008. Viper made all the beats himself using only a Yamaha Motif keyboard and a Roland beat machine. According to Viper himself, the album's upfront lyricism allowed him to address controversial issues with society, such as his crack use and dealership at the time, violence, and his past gang membership with 5-9 Piru, a sub-group of the Bloods. You'll Cowards Don't Even Smoke Crack is distinct not only for its lo-fi nature, but also for being the only album by Viper that does not contain any samples or reversed beats. The album was later remastered and released through the indie record label Animated Music in 2018 celebrating the album's 10th anniversary, with inserts signed by Viper. Cover The album's cover has become a popular reaction image and internet meme, along with many of Viper's other album covers, with people commonly making their own covers using the rapper's face. The back cover of the indie vinyl issue of the album consists of a fake Fox News report using one of Viper's selfies which he had sent out to fans. The cover itself is a cropped and poorly scanned image of Viper's face sourced from the cover of his 2006 album The Southwest Hooligan. Reception You'll Cowards Don't Even Smoke Crack and Viper in general remained relatively obscure throughout the 2000s, where he would host his albums on the CD Baby to limited exposure. In early 2013, the title track was posted onto YouTube. Since then it has garnered over three million views, and news outlets started to report on the song and album in response. You'll Cowards Don't Even Smoke Crack received positive coverage in the music press. Sputnik Music wrote that the album fuses \\"a nostalgic and ethereal blend of cloud rap and vaporwave\\". The Chicago Reader wrote that the album is \\"outsider-artist genius. People on the Internet are initially drawn to Viper because of his blatant disregard for grammar, outrageously violent and drug- centric lyrics, and how sonically bizarre he is in general.\\" You'll Cowards Don't Even Smoke Crack is Viper's most successful album - it became an internet meme due to its tacky album cover and title, which has been noted as being \\"shockingly upfront\\".

Rutherford specializes in outdoor sports photography and often shoots in the mountains of New Zealand. She shoots everything from sports, travel, and lifestyle. Personal Rutherford was born in Edinburg, Scotland, on 7 August 1983 to a family of five children. She had always been an outdoor adventurer and, like her mother, she later became a ski instructor. She studied at St. Martins College of Art in London where she earned an Arts Honors Degree. Rutherford then traveled to the South Island of New Zealand and ended up in Wanaka. She married Tim Rutherford and has a son named Alfie. Before she moved to Wanaka, she alternated between Verbier, Switzerland, and Wanaka so that she could both live in the southern and northern hemisphere. After she married Tim, she moved to his farm in Tarras. She settled down officially in Wanaka. The South Island is filled with peaks and lakes where the bottom can be seen from the top. She went to Wanaka for the outdoor factor and that is where she likes to photograph the most. According to Rutherford, the outdoors are where the pictures turn out the best. Rutherford shoots mostly in the mountains all over New Zealand to get her perfect shots. She says, \\"Beautiful things happen when people and the mountains meet\\". Career Rutherford grew up in Scotland and has worked as a freelance photographer since graduating from St. Martins College in London, with a major in Theatre Design. Her background in theatre led to her interest in photography and her love of skiing. She started as a ski instructor with a camera and is now an award winning photographer. To add to her interest in photography, she launched her new website in 2009. The Faction Collective ski company advertised her website to their users to promote her work. Rutherford left her home in Scotland to go to New Zealand to resume her love for skiing. She started shooting with her Iphone 4 before getting her Canon camera. She shot in the winter for four years before moving to Wanaka and shooting her first summer photos there. Wanaka is not far from Mount Aspiring National Park where she sometimes takes photographs. She also travels to Nepal, China, Japan, India and Switzerland to get some shots as well. Usually using her Canon 5D Mark 3 camera, she says capturing the athletes in their element is the most critical part in telling the story within the picture. The landscapes and terrain in Wanaka help produce her work. \\"It can be as simple as someone standing admiring a vista, not even doing anything extreme but simply taking it all in, and this gives a whole new meaning to the photo\\", Rutherford says. She has many pictures published on her website, social media, and Vimeo made a slideshow to display her work. Many of her pictures have been published in travel magazines all over the world. Air New Zealand used her pictures in their advertisements in Sydney and Melbourne’s Central train stations as part of an ad campaign for Air NZ. Rutherford is supported by F-Stop Gear, Peak Design, Cecilia Gallery, Smith Optics and Faction Skis.

Aspiring National Park. In 2011, Rutherford got together with a group of mountain bike photographers in Are, Sweden, for the Scandinavian Photo Challenge by Nikon, which she won. She was featured in the Exposure section of Outside Magazine in 2011. Rutherford appeared as a finalist in the Pro Photographer Showdown in 2012. She was also a finalist in the New Zealand Geographic Photographer of the Year in 2013. Rutherford was featured in Outside Magazines Best Travel photography in 2014 with a picture of moonlight bliss in New Zealand. Rutherford was one of the winners of the 2015 New Zealand Press Photographer of the Year. Her photos were displayed as part of an exhibition The Botanist in Auckland on 9 December 2015.

It was formed on the advice of SS (Schutzstaffel) official Dieter Wisliceny; the first leader, Heinrich Schwartz, was removed after refusing to cooperate with Nazi demands and replaced by the ineffectual Arpad Sebestyen. The collaborationist Department of Special Affairs run by Karol Hochberg aided the authorities in confiscating Jewish property and collecting information that was used to arrest and deport Jews. Nevertheless, most of the ÚŽ members focused on providing opportunities for emigration and improving the social welfare of Jews remaining in Slovakia, although they were hampered by the dwindling resources of the community. In addition, the ÚŽ attempted to resist deportation by bribing Slovak officials, retraining Jews who had been expelled from their previous profession, and improving and expanding labor camps for Jews in Slovakia. The underground resistance organization that ran under its auspices, the Working Group, took over the ÚŽ leadership in December 1943. Since its formation in early 1942, the Working Group had used the ÚŽ as cover for its illegal rescue activities. After the German invasion of Slovakia in August 1944, the ÚŽ was disbanded and many of its members were arrested and deported to concentration camps.  Background  On 14 March 1939, the Slovak State proclaimed its independence from Czechoslovakia under German protection; Jozef Tiso (a Catholic priest) was appointed president. According to the Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, the persecution of Jews was \\"central to the domestic policy of the Slovak state\\". Slovak Jews were blamed for the 1938 First Vienna Award—Hungary's annexation of 40 percent of Slovakia's arable land and 270,000 people who had declared Czechoslovak ethnicity. In the state-sponsored media, propagandists claimed that Jews were disloyal and a \\"radical solution of the Jewish issue\\" was necessary for the progress of the Slovak nation. In a process overseen by the Central Economic Office (led by Slovak official ), 12,300 Jewish-owned businesses were confiscated or liquidated; this deprived most Slovak Jews of their livelihood. Although Jews were initially defined based on religion, the September 1941 \\"Jewish Code\\" (based on the Nuremberg Laws) defined them by ancestry. Among the Code's 270 anti-Jewish regulations were the requirement to wear yellow armbands, a ban on intermarriage, and the conscription of able- bodied Jews for forced labor. According to the 1940 census, about 89,000 Jews (slightly more than three percent of the population) lived in the Slovak State. About two-thirds of Jews in Slovakia were Orthodox, of whom many were strongly anti-Zionist. Other Jews belonged to Neolog Judaism or were Zionists influenced by German-Jewish culture. Zionists and Neologs often formed an alliance against Orthodox interests.  Establishment  In response to the anti-Jewish measures, Zionist and Neolog leaders set up an umbrella organization called the ŽÚÚ (Židovská Ústredná Úradovna pre krajinu Slovenska) in late 1939. The ŽÚÚ attempted to negotiate with the Slovak government to ease anti-Jewish measures, as well as help Jews to emigrate and provide education and welfare. They tried to convince the Orthodox Jews to join the organization, to no avail; the lack of cooperation caused the ŽÚÚ to collapse. In September 1940, Dieter Wisliceny, representing Adolf Eichmann, director of the Jewish section of the Reich Main Security Office, arrived in Bratislava as the Judenberater for Slovakia. His aim was to impoverish the Jewish community so that it became a burden on gentile Slovaks, who would then agree to deport them. On the basis of the Slovak Government Decree 234, passed 26 September, all Jewish community organizations were closed down and the Jews forced to form the Ústredňa Židov (Jewish Center, ÚŽ). The first Judenrat outside the Reich and German-occupied Poland, ÚŽ was the only secular Jewish organization allowed to exist in Slovakia; it inherited the property of the disbanded Jewish organizations. It operated under the direct control of the Central Economic Office and all Jews were required to be members. Its offices were located at multiple addresses in central Bratislava. Leaders of the Jewish community were divided on how to react to this development. Some refused to associate with the ÚŽ in the belief that it would be used to implement anti- Jewish measures, but more saw participating in the ÚŽ as a way to help their fellow Jews by delaying the implementation of such measures. As a result, the ÚŽ was initially dominated by Jews who refused to collaborate and focused on charitable projects (such as soup kitchens) to help those impoverished by the anti-Jewish measures. The first leader of the ÚŽ was Heinrich Schwartz, longtime secretary of the Orthodox Jewish community, who had been chosen for his fluency in Slovak. Schwartz, a respected figure in the Orthodox community, was opposed by the Zionists and Neologs, who nevertheless joined the ÚŽ as a minority. Initially, the Zionists and Neologs worked to undermine Schwartz's authority, in order to gain influence for themselves. They were also worried that Schwartz and the Orthodox faction would collaborate with the authorities. These fears proved groundless; Schwatz thwarted anti-Jewish orders to the best of his ability by delaying their implementation. In particular, he sabotaged a census of Jews in eastern Slovakia with an aim to remove them to the west of the country; Wisliceny had him arrested in April 1941. His replacement was Arpad Sebestyen, who took a position of complete cooperation with Wisliceny. At about this time, Jewish businesses were being \\"Aryanized\\", causing massive unemployment. Many Jews who had lost their jobs sought positions in the ÚŽ with the support of the Central Economic Office, causing the introduction of \\"undesirable elements\\" who were willing to collaborate.  Departments  = Emigration = The ÚŽ's emigration department was headed by Gisi Fleischmann, a prewar Zionist leader known for her connections to international Jewish organizations. Through the embassies and consulates of neutral countries in Bratislava and Budapest, the department attempted to help Jews immigrate to other countries. The obstacles to immigration were rarely surmounted but a few Jews did manage to immigrate; the last group of 82 Jews left for Mandatory Palestine in April 1941. = Welfare = The ÚŽ's main challenge was to provide social welfare to Jews who had been deprived of their livelihoods, using the dwindling resources of the Jewish community. By April 1941, 24,767 Jews had lost their jobs (76% of those employed in 1939). By August, the ÚŽ was providing welfare to 23,877 Jews with 1,500 welfare applications to be considered; this consisted of about 3 Slovak koruna (Ks) daily per adult and 2 Ks per child. In addition, the ÚŽ established soup kitchens that fed more than 35,000 people. The organization also funded a hospital, orphanages, and homes for the elderly. It funded healthcare for Jews, establishing free clinics where Jewish doctors practiced. This money came from resources inherited from Jewish organizations that had been dissolved as well as international organizations, especially the Joint Distribution Committee (JDC). The ÚŽ also levied fees on its own members, but due to the impoverishment of the Jews, only collected 15 million Ks of the 50 million Ks due to it through July 1941. An attempt to take out a loan on immovable property owned by Jews, which had not yet been confiscated, failed due to the Central Economic Office's opposition to giving up its claim to the property. Over time, the ÚŽ's financial situation worsened while the demands on it increased due to the progressive exclusion of Jews from economic life. Despite its poor financial straits, the ÚŽ provided aid to Jews in neighboring countries, who were even worse off, sending packages to Germany, the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, and the General Government. With the Slovak Red Cross, it also provided food to Austrian Jews being deported to Theresienstadt concentration camp or locations in the east. In late 1941, the ÚŽ's budget was cut by one- third while it was struggling to provide aid to tens of thousands of Jews who had been forcibly relocated from their homes. Later, in 1943 and 1944, the ÚŽ received significant food supplies and other support from Jewish and non- Jewish organizations in neutral countries, while a changed leadership of the Central Economic Office, more sympathetic to the Jews, released some funds. The organization was finally able to solve the housing crisis and attempted to find work for its unemployed members, who absorbed the ÚŽ's funds and were most vulnerable to deportations in the event of a resumption. = Education and Culture = The education and culture department succeeded at keeping most children in school due to an arrangement with Jozef Sivák, the minister of education; Sivák was sympathetic to the Jews. At the end of the 1940–1941 school year, 61 Jewish schools instructed 7,941 children. However, 596 Jewish children did not attend school because a Jewish school did not exist in their area; Jews were barred from attending non-Jewish schools. The department also published a few books, including Theodor Herzl's The Jewish State which was the first publication to promote Zionism. However, the Central Economic Office prevented the ÚŽ from organizing a cultural academy or summer camps for youth, which it characterized as \\"undesirable activities\\". Most of the Jewish schools were later taken over for housing Jews displaced by the large-scale internal relocation of Jews in late 1941; educational activities had to cease. The department also published the only Jewish newspaper allowed, which was called the Vestník Ústredne Židov (Gazette of the Jewish Center), distributed to every Jewish household. In this gazette, the ÚŽ called for calm and discipline for all Jews, in fear that a lack of cooperation would cause reprisals for the entire Jewish community, and held out the promise of immigration to Palestine, an increasingly unrealistic proposition. Kamenec notes that this absolute cooperation and suppression of resistance was exactly what the Slovak State sought to impose on the Jews. = Non-Israelites = The department for Jews who had converted to Christianity was largely unsuccessful in exempting converts from anti-Jewish measures. It argued that being forced to wear the Star of David would have \\"severe consequences from the psychological, educational, family and religious points of view\\". = Special Affairs = Wisliceny set up a department for \\"Special Affairs\\" or \\"Special Tasks\\" on 11 June 1941 to ensure the prompt implementation of Nazi decrees, appointing an ambitious, unprincipled Viennese Jew named Karol Hochberg as its director. The main task of the department was collecting statistical data to be used in future forced relocations. On 4 October 1941, the Slovak government ordered 11,466 Jews from Bratislava—those not employed or intermarried—to relocate to fourteen smaller towns: Zvolen, Bardejov, Prešov, Humenné, Liptovský Mikuláš, Michalovce, Nové Mesto nad Váhom, Nitra, Žilina, Stropkov, Topoľčany, Trnava, Vrbové and Spišská Nová Ves. The ÚŽ was forced to pay for their relocation, which Hochberg's office supervised. To be more efficient, he reorganized the department into six subdivisions, for registering Jews, tracking down those who did not report for deportation, keeping track of stolen property, and so forth. More than 160,000 Ks in property was confiscated, despite the fact that the affected Jews were poorer than average. Hochberg personally embezzled some of the confiscated furniture to bribe Wisliceny. According to the official statistics, 5,679 people had been relocated by the beginning of December, and a total of 6,720 had been moved to the towns by the end of March. This did not include some who had been imprisoned in labor camps. Due to Sebestyen's ineffectuality, Hochberg's department came to dominate the operations of the ÚŽ. During the 1942 deportations, Hochberg's department worked on categorizing Jews. These records were used by various Slovak agencies, such as the Central Economic Office and the Hlinka Guard, for preparing the lists of Jews to be deported. Andrej Steiner, an employee of the ÚŽ who was involved in the Working Group, tipped off the Slovak police to Hochberg's acceptance of bribes from the Working Group on behalf of Wisliceny; Hochberg was arrested in November 1942 and jailed for corruption. Although Hochberg's collaborationism was strongly opposed by much of the ÚŽ leadership, it tarnished the ÚŽ's reputation in the Jewish community, which persisted even years after Hochberg had lost power. = Retraining and labor camps = Barracks at Sereď labor camp As an outgrowth of the work of the welfare department, a retraining department led by Oskar Neumann ran retraining courses for Jews put out of work, supposedly in preparation for emigration to Palestine. However, Neumann was able to use his position in order to extend aid to the Zionist youth movements, which had been banned. By February 1941, 13,612 people had applied for these courses but only a few could be accommodated. In June, 63 courses were retraining 1,300 Jews for agricultural work. Craft retraining programs were more difficult to organize because Jewish businesses were rapidly liquidated. Nevertheless, by July there were 605 participants in such courses. Many graduates later worked in the labor camps in Slovakia. The ÚŽ paid for the courses, which included instruction in the Hebrew language and life in the future Jewish state. In a further step to reduce unemployment, the ÚŽ established labor camps and centers, an activity approved by an April 1941 decree. Although this effort was connected to the discriminatory conscription of all Jewish men aged 18–60 for labor, it had a beneficial effect for unemployed Jews. The first center was established at Strážke in spring 1941; by September, about 5,500 Jews were working at 80 sites. The companies employing the Jews enjoyed cheap labor, but the ÚŽ had to subsidize their wages to meet the legal minimum. By the end of the year, most of these centers were dissolved, officially due to the harsh weather conditions. According to Slovak historian Ivan Kamenec, the real reason was that the Slovak State was planning to deport the Jewish workers. Instead, three larger camps were established at Sereď, Nováky, and Vyhne. The ÚŽ financed the construction of these camps in the fall of 1941; however, the government began to discourage construction (because it planned to deport Jews instead) in the fall of 1941. During the deportations, the welfare department provided aid to Jews forced into concentration centers for deportation, providing blankets and other supplies to indigent Jews to take with them. However, its efforts were inadequate to alleviate the poor housing, food, and sanitary conditions. During the deportations, the desperate Slovak Jewish leadership tried to use the camps as a way to save the Jews imprisoned there. Alois Pecuch, the director of the camps, and others were bribed to prevent the deportation of the Jews working in the camps, but many local commanders ignored their instructions to this effect. Sereď and Nováky were used as concentration centers and their workers targeted for deportation on the last trains of autumn 1942. Jews deported from Slovakia had to sign a declaration surrendering their remaining property to the ÚŽ. 2,500 Jews, out of the 18,945 legally present, were living in these three camps at the end of 1942. In March 1943, the Central Office for Jewish Labor Camps (Ústredná kancelária pre pracovné tábory Židov) was established in order to increase production in the labor camps. The Central Office also improved conditions in the camps by constructing new buildings and staging cultural activities for prisoners. Bribery of labor-camp guards continued, in order to ease life for the inmates. =Appeals= During the 1942 deportations a Department of Appeals, led by Tibor Kováč, was formed in order to ensure that exemptions from deportation would be honored. The department also helped Jews apply for exemptions. The workers in this department went to great lengths to save Jews; some were arrested and deported while attempting to obtain the release of Jews from detention centers. There is little information on how much success it had.  Illegal resistance  In summer 1941, several ÚŽ members dissatisfied with the Department of Special Affairs gathered around Gisi Fleischmann, who began holding meetings for the nascent resistance group in her office. In 1942, this group was eventually formalized into an underground organization known as the \\"Working Group\\". It was an alliance of the ideological factions in the UŽ, led by Fleischmann and the anti-Zionist Orthodox rabbi Michael Dov Weissmandl. Other members included Oskar Neumann, assimilationist Tibor Kováč, Neolog rabbi Armin Frieder, and the apolitical architect Andrej Steiner. Israeli historian Livia Rothkirchen emphasizes that the members of the Working Group operated in dual capacities as resistance members and official representatives, coordinating legal and illegal activities, which makes it difficult to draw a distinction between the two groups' activities. She also notes that the successes of the Working Group were due in large part to the official standing of the ÚŽ. Censorship of correspondence and this newsletter intensified in early 1942 during the deportations, in order to prevent the ÚŽ from warning the Jewish population. After news of forthcoming deportations was leaked on 3 March 1942, many Jews came to the ÚŽ offices in Bratislava to confirm the rumors. Several ÚŽ officials signed a petition detailing the economic arguments for retaining Jews in Slovakia and mailed it illegally to Tiso. The chairman of the ÚŽ, Arpad Sebestyen, also wrote a petition arguing that the Jews could serve as a source of cheap labor in Slovakia, to the profit of Slovak companies, and sent it illegally to the Slovak parliament. These efforts failed to halt or delay the deportations. Despite censorship, the ÚŽ managed to insert covert warnings into the official circulars. Later, the Working Group attempted to prevent the deportation of Jews by bribing German and Slovak officials. Sebestyen was aware of the activities of the Working Group and made no effort to stop them; neither did he report them to the authorities. In December 1943, a reorganization of the Slovak government caused Sebestyen to be let go. The Jewish community was allowed to choose his successor and the Working Group voted unanimously for Oskar Neumann, one of its members, effectively taking over the ÚŽ. Neumann focused on restoring the reputation of the ÚŽ in the Jewish community. The Working Group activists even distributed information about rescue operations in official ÚŽ messages.  Dissolution  Jews from Carpathian Ruthenia arrive at Auschwitz, May 1944 Because of Germany's imminent military defeat, much of the Slovak populace and the leadership of the army switched its allegiance to the Allies. Increasing partisan activity in the mountains caused a dilemma for Jews and the leadership in particular. The Slovak government ordered the removal of Jews from eastern Slovakia; the ÚŽ leadership was able to avoid their resettlement in camps. On 29 August 1944, Germany invaded Slovakia in response to the increase in partisan sabotage. The same day, the Slovak National Uprising was launched, but it was crushed by the end of October. The Jews, who fought with the partisans in substantial numbers, were blamed for the uprising, providing the Germans with an excuse to implement the Final Solution. Eichmann sent SS- Hauptsturmführer Alois Brunner to Bratislava to oversee the deportation and murder of some 25,000 surviving Jews in Slovakia. Immediately after the German invasion, Neumann disbanded the ÚŽ and told its members to go into hiding or flee. The ÚŽ employees suffered the same fate as the remaining Slovak Jews; most were deported to concentration camps. Among prominent UŽ members, Hochberg was executed as a collaborator by Jewish partisans during the uprising, Fleischmann was killed in Auschwitz concentration camp, and Neumann survived in Theresienstadt. Frieder, Steiner, and Kováč were able to avoid deportation. Frieder died in 1946 of a heart condition, Steiner emigrated to the United States, and Kováč killed himself in 1952 after suffering harassment from the secret police.

Adjacent Right-Right pairs do not affect the score.

The disturbance continued westward over the next few days, organizing into a tropical depression on September 29. Later in the day, the system strengthened into a tropical storm, receiving the name Walaka from the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC). The storm then rapidly intensified, becoming a hurricane on September 30 and a major hurricane by October 1. The cyclone took on a more northward track under the influence of a low-pressure system located to the north. Walaka peaked as a Category 5 hurricane with winds of 160 mph (260 km/h) and a pressure of early on October 2. An eyewall replacement cycle caused the hurricane to weaken, though it remained a powerful storm for the next day or so. Afterward, less favorable conditions caused a steady weakening of the hurricane, and Walaka became extratropical on October 6, well to the north of the Hawaiian Islands. The storm's remnants then accelerated northeastward, before dissipating on October 7. Although the hurricane did not impact any major landmasses, it passed very close to the unpopulated Johnston Atoll as a strong Category 4 hurricane, where a hurricane warning was issued in advance of the storm. Four scientists there intended to ride out the storm on the island, but were then evacuated before the storm hit. Walaka then neared the far Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, but weakened considerably as it did so. East Island in the French Frigate Shoals suffered a direct hit and was completely destroyed. The storm caused significant damage to the nesting grounds for multiple endangered species; coral reefs in the region also suffered considerable damage, displacing the local fish population. Meteorological history The National Hurricane Center (NHC) first forecasted that a low- pressure area would form around 130–140° west on September 22, 2018. Two days later, a troughan elongated region of low atmospheric pressure formed around 1,600 mi (2,575 km) south-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii. The disturbance entered the central Pacific Ocean on September 26 as a mixture of low-level clouds and larger cumulus clouds. A subtropical ridge located north of the Hawaiian Islands caused the system to track westward over the next few days. A surface low formed by 12:00 UTC on September 27 as the system was located 805 mi (1,295 km) southeast of Hilo, Hawaii. The system became Tropical Depression One-C around 12:00 UTC on September 29 while it was around 690 mi (1,110 km) south of Honolulu, Hawaii. Convection or thunderstorm activity formed near the system's low-level circulation center, and a banding featuresignificantly elongated, curved bands of rain clouds became established over the southern and eastern portions of the depression. Six hours later, the system strengthened into a tropical storm, receiving the name Walaka from the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC). The nascent tropical storm was located in an environment of warm sea surface temperatures, low vertical wind shear, and humid air. After forming, the cyclone's banding features degraded, although its convection persisted. Meanwhile, the ridge continued to steer Walaka westward. Around this time, Walaka began a stint of rapid intensification. Convection became more abundant around the storm's low-level center during the morning of September 30. Walaka's cloud tops cooled to around ; the tropical cyclone intensified into a hurricane by 18:00 UTC. A cloud-filled eye emerged on visible satellite imagery by early October 1 as Walaka continued to strengthen. Walaka became a Category 3 major hurricane around 12:00 UTC on October 1, the fourth storm to do so in the central Pacific in 2018. At that time, the hurricane possessed a prominent eye surrounded by a sizeable ring of cold, clouds. Walaka had also turned towards the west-northwest as it moved around the southwestern edge of the ridge. Walaka peaked as a Category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 160 mph (260 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of at 00:00 UTC on October 2. Walaka's peak intensity made it the second Category 5 hurricane of the 2018 Pacific hurricane season. Around that time, the cyclone had a clear, 23-mile (37 km) wide eye surrounded by cool cloud tops. Meanwhile, microwave imagery and ASCAT data showed the formation of concentric eyewalls, signaling that an eyewall replacement cycle had commenced. Additionally, a strengthening low-pressure system located north of Walaka was causing the hurricane to begin a more northward track. Walaka as a minimal Category 1 hurricane early on October 5 Hurricane Walaka maintained its peak intensity for six hours before beginning to decay as a result of the eyewall replacement cycle. the cyclone continued to track northward under the influence of a Pacific upper-level low. The hurricane weakened to a minimal Category 4 hurricane by 00:00 UTC on October 3. By that time, Walaka's eye had degraded on satellite imagery; the eye had become cloud-filled, and the clouds making up the eyewall and central dense overcast had warmed. After completing the eyewall cycle, Walaka reintensified slightly, reaching a secondary peak of 145 mph (230 km/h) around 12:00 UTC on October 3. The cyclone's eye became increasingly delineated as the clouds comprising the eyewall cooled. Although the storm had restrengthened, increasing wind shear was thinning the northwestern eyewall. Soon after, Walaka began to weaken once more as it advanced north-northeastward. Later on October 3, the western and southwestern eyewall also eroded as a result of the wind shear. At the same time, upper- level cirrus outflow was disrupted in the southwestern and northeastern portions of the storm. The already strong wind shear increased even further, peaking at 54 mph (87 km/h) around 00:00 UTC. Walaka's eye disappeared from visible satellite imagery and the southwestern portion of the low-level center became uncovered. Walaka made landfall as a high-end Category 3 hurricane approximately 35 mi (55 km) west-northwest of French Frigate Shoals at 06:20 UTC on October 4. Environmental conditions deteriorated even further on October 4 as sea surface temperatures fell below and ocean heat content decreased. This caused Walaka to rapidly weaken; the hurricane fell below major hurricane intensity around 12:00 UTC and was a minimal Category 1 hurricane by 00:00 UTC on October 5. Early on October 5, Walaka turned towards the northwest as it traced the northern boundary of the upper-level low. Convection associated with the storm continued to dissipate; the remaining thunderstorm activity was displaced northeast of the storm's low-level center. The wind shear abated later on October 5, however, sea surface temperatures along the remainder of the tropical storm's track were cooler than . As a result of the decreased shear, Walaka's low-level center was temporarily recovered by convection and the weakening trend slowed as the storm continued north-northwest. By late October 5, the low-level center was completely exposed once more and the remaining convection had all but dissipated. Walaka had also turned towards the northeast by this time. Walaka transitioned into an extratropical cyclone around 12:00 UTC on October 6 after having been deprived of thunderstorm activity. The extratropical cyclone tracked over the open sea and dissipated by 18:00 UTC on October 7. Preparations and impact The 11-acre (4.5 ha) East Island was completely swept away by the hurricane's storm surge. The majority of sediment was deposited to the north across coral reefs. As Walaka approached the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, a hurricane watch and warning were issued for the Johnston Atoll on September 30 and October 1, respectively. Early on October 2, a hurricane watch was issued for Nihoa to French Frigate Shoals to Maro Reef. Later in the day, a hurricane warning was issued for French Frigate Shoals to Maro Reef and a tropical storm warning was issued for Nihoa to French Frigate Shoals. Over the next couple of days, the watches and warnings were gradually discontinued. A crew of four scientists on the isolated Johnston Atoll had planned on riding out the storm in an evacuation shelter until the United States Fish and Wildlife Service sought an emergency evacuation on October 1. The United States Coast Guard flew a plane from Kalaeloa Airport to evacuate the personnel on the next day. Also on October 2, seven researchers studying Hawaiian monk seals and green sea turtles on French Frigate Shoals were evacuated to Honolulu. Walaka struck the northwestern Hawaiian Islands as a Category 3 hurricane on October 4. A powerful storm surge accompanied the hurricane as it traversed the French Frigate Shoals. The small, low-lying East Island suffered a direct hit and was completely destroyed, with sediment scattered across coral reefs to the north. The island had served as one of the major nesting locations for the endangered green sea turtles, and critically endangered Hawaiian monk seals. An estimated 19 percent of 2018's sea turtle nests on the island were lost; however, all adult females tending the nests left before the storm. Approximately half of Hawaii's green sea turtles nested on the island, and Charles Littnandirector of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's protected species divisionstated it would take years for the implications of the island's loss to be fully understood. Coral reefs near the French Frigate Shoals, Lisianski Island, and the Pearl and Hermes Atoll were substantially damaged, displacing the native fish population.

The historic houses include structures that date from the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries and retain their architectural and historic integrity. The district was listed in the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district in 2016. Early History Jessup Ave & Midland St Clock In 1659 John Ogden purchased Quawcanantucke from Sachem Wyandanch of the Montauk tribe for 400 pounds, vouchsafing his friend access for hunting, fishing and gathering berries. That land, from Westhampton to Southampton was to secure grazing for the sheep, hogs and cattle of the town and the first structure there was built for the shepherd that tended John Foster's flock. By the mid-18th century, the grandsons of Southampton's original settlers became the founders of the Quogue settlement. The Cook, Foster, Herrick, Jessup, Howell, and Post families started building homes along Quogue Street. Once a bucolic collection of farms by the sea, Quogue in the early 20th century had become a place for wealthy bon vivants to create country estates by purchasing whole farms and building cottages along the dunes. Families that had summered in one of its boarding houses came to stay, many building the now-iconic shingle covered homes that dot the streets. Over 250 such shingle-style homes make up the historic hamlet. Mary Paynes store Part of Southampton Towne in 1850, home to the first modern bridge over Quantuck Bay, Quogue was the second overnight stop on the stagecoach run from Brooklyn to Southampton in 1835, before the arrival of the LIRR (Riverhead -1844) during the Victorian era rush to colonize the Hamptons. Steamships plied stately courses off the Atlantic coast and homes built by whalers had dominated Quogue and Quaquanantuck streets. Jessup Avenue served as the main commercial street with the country market and the fire dept setting up roots in 1870. Early inhabitants include the linen house and the store by the pond, now home to the Quogue Historical society. Quogue Street, the widest in the hamlet, had been the grazing path that cattle were driven down each spring. Shingle-style Church Chapel 20180914 By 1845, whaling had become the country's fifth largest cash crop as the demand for whale oil for lighting grew. In Quogue, some families invested in the voyages; others signed aboard the whalers as crew; and a fair number became captains of their own vessels. Some of these included residents Frederick M. Hallock, Henry Gardiner, Edward Stevens, and members of the Cooper family. Until then, Quogue was a quiet, pastoral community. Each small holding grew food for the table, some were working by farming, ocean fishing and then whaling, starting in small whaleboats from shore, then in Barks and Schooners on long ocean voyages. A secondary business of boarding summer visitors was thriving by 1855. Haddads Linen shop In 1870, a spur of the LIRR to Quogue brought a flood of visitors each summer and, by 1880, the hamlet was a bustling summer resort. Thirteen boarding houses and hotels ensconced along Quogue Street and the village flourished. The cottages on Dune road were large affairs, built to accommodate the seasonal influx of beach goers. It was by then considered the wealthiest village on Long Island by proportion of its residents. It was nicknamed “The Queen of the Hamptons” by the LIRR. Gales and Nor’easters Quogue Life- Saving station, currently a private home on Dune Rd. On the high seas nor’easters might be the most terrifying of the dangers, but thousands lost their souls to the sea within sight of shore. Nestled among the dunes during the middle of the 19th century was a garage like structure, long gone. It was once the shed that was used by the Quogue Life-Saving Station (NRHP ref# 99000640) before the quarters were upgraded in 1872 to a larger red house. The red house still remains on Dune Road as a private home after the quarters were moved in 1912. The original shed was in use from 1849 to 1872 and involved Maritime disasters. The poet Longfellow famously wrote in 1839 of The Wreck of the Hesperus, a tale of a winter storm and ill-fated voyage off the Atlantic coast of which Long Islands had its own share; and the need for coast watchers and seagoing rescue crafts had spawned life-saving stations along the south shore. Wrecks such as the “Infanti” (1851), the “Europa” (1886) and Nahum Chapin (1898) gave notoriety to the Quogue lifesaving station and it became a part of the US Coast guard in 1915. The latest station (Designed by Victor Mendelheff – 1912, currently a private home) is one of the few remaining examples of this type of structure and was the only individual building in the Quogue Historic District on the NRHP lists, despite being outside the limits of the district boundaries. QHD sign Historic Status 44 Quogue St. Nancy D. Mullan of Quogue was on the Town of Southampton Landmarks and Historic Districts Board and also a member of the Quogue Historic Preservation Society. She was instrumental in the effort to establish the Quogue Historic District – which was added to the N.Y. State Register in December 2015 and National Register on February 2, 2016. On Jessup Ave, Quogue Community Hall is part of the Quogue Historic District along with the Hampton Theatre company. St. Paul AME Zion is a Southampton town landmarked church on Montauk Highway and the fight to gain NRHP status for the hamlet had been underway as far back as 1992. Numerous attempts were rebuffed, reasons counter varied in considering historic district status, the primary question was whether those sectors being considered had any real historical significance. The Village of Quogue had set itself apart from the Hamptons summer vibe by having a quaint country village lifestyle lacking the moneyed elements common to towns further east in the Hamptons. Boarders occupied rooming houses 4 months out of the year beginning in the 1840s. Stately cottages lined Dune road. The connection to Sag Harbor whaling captains and the landmarked Life-Saving Station along with the Victorian era homes still standing eventually won out. Some 200+ Victorian era houses are contributing to the districts status.https://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/places/pdfs/15001028.pdf 47 Quogue St was built near the location of a historic hotel it replaced The Park Service, in the nominating petition, stated “The Quogue Historic District is locally significant under Criterion A in the areas of settlement and social history and recreation. The district is additionally significant under Criterion C for its remarkable collection of architecture that reflects Quogue's history as an early agricultural community that transformed into a predominantly seasonal community during the nineteenth century”. Many Victorian homes are still standing in the Quogue Historic District and more than 300 acres have been preserved in a wildlife refuge. Historic Victorian summer cottages alongside modern mansions line Dune Road and the many homes on village streets have the wrap around porches common to the time. The previously landmarked Life-Saving station and the Quogue Cemetery – (National Register Information System ID:13000914) are already separately listed on the NRHP. The integrity of the Tom Bendelow designed golf course for the Quogue Field Club is also considered to be an important feature of the recreational history of the district. Five houses, First House, Old Revolution, Antiquity, the Miss Mary Post House and the Foster Homestead are the oldest residences in the village, all date to the pre-Colonial era and all have interiors that have been modernized. .

He was also the director of the online news platform, Enlace Gutiérrez Zamora. Vázquez was known for reporting on crime and politics.  Personal  Along his reporting career, he also owned and operated his own food stand, and sold carnitas, tacos, and pork rinds.  Career  Before starting his digital career at Enlace Gutiérrez Zamora, he worked at two of the local papers, La Opinión de Poza Rica and the Vanguardia. Before his digital career, he also edited for the newspaper El Noreste, and was the one of the founders of the magazine El Portal. Vázquez was known for reporting on crime and politics in Veracruz, Mexico.  Death  Vázquez was shot dead inside his home in Gutiérrez Zamora on March 21, 2018. He had reportedly been shot three times. The murderer or murderers were believed to have left the scene by motorcycle. The motive for his murder is believed to be in association to his work as a journalist, as he had reported on illegal invasion of private property in Tecolutla on March 6, 2018. However, other sources state that the reason for his murder is because of his reporting on a notary. Vázquez had asked for help and protection several days before his death. The body was found by his wife. Jaime Cisneros confirmed on March 22, 2018, that they are investigating his murder and his reporting as a possible motive. Cisneros is the special prosecutor in Veracruz that covers attacks on journalists in the area.  Context  A year ago, the editor at his former workplace, La Opinión de Poza Rica, had been subjected to armed aggression. However, as of March 21, 2018, his case has had no progress. In February 2018, he had begun reporting on crime and corruption in the local area. On March 6, he had reported on invasion on illegal seizure of private property. Vázquez had become aware that he was in danger on March 9. Vázquez had asked the police for protection, and was ignored. Before his death, Vázquez was allegedly threatened by the local authorities. These threats were received shortly after Vázquez 's reporting on illegal estate invasion in Tecolutla by the Water Commission of the State of Veracruz. While local media outlets reported that he had requested protection, the State Commission for the Care and Protection of Journalists (CEAPP) reported that he had not lodged an official complaint with the organization.  Impact  Mexico is considered to be one of the most dangerous countries in the Western hemisphere for criminal and political corruption reporting. In Veracruz especially, reporters have often had to resort to self-censorship to stay alive. On March 22, 2018, the organization Article 19 reported that Vázquez was the third journalist in Mexico killed that year.

He was one of the founders of the Association of Painters of Serbia (Udruženja likovnih umetnika Srbije). During the First World War, he was a war painter of the Serbian Army's Supreme Command and, as such, he painted portraits of Voivodes Radomir Putnik, Živojin Mišić, Stepa Stepanović and Petar Bojović, as well as General Pavle Jurišić Šturm, King Peter I of Serbia and Regent Alexander Karađorđević. Biography In 1905, Mihailo Milovanović enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, where he studied first under the direction of Ludwig von Herterich and then Hugo von Habermann, a painter renowned for his portraits. Milovanović graduated from the Academy in 1909. In 1912, Milovanović returned to Serbia when the First Balkan War broke out and joined the army as a volunteer.

In 1915 he participated in the difficult Serbian army's retreat through Albania. Mihailo Milovanović was killed in Užice at the end of November 1941 by Tito's Communist partisans who supposedly mistook him for an English spy. After the Second World War and in the days of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, he was completely overshadowed, his name was conveniently omitted in encyclopedias devoted to art. To add insult to injury, the art authorities in Belgrade attributed most of Mihailo Milovanović paintings to Milan Milovanović instead.

He lived in Davao del Norte, Philippines, where he wrote about the history, events, and issues of the province. On June 7, 2018 Denora was murdered by two motorcyclists while stuck in traffic with his driver Mayonito Revira.  Biography  Denora lived in Davao del Norte, working as a columnist, broadcaster, and publisher. He had a radio program on Luzon's DXKS-FM based in Tagum City and was the founding chair of a media association based in Davao del Norte. Denora wrote about events and issues that affected the Davao del Norte province and often criticized political officials from the region.  Death  = Events = On June 7, 2018 Denora was riding in a white Hyundai Elantra with his driver, Mayonito Revira, on the national highway in New Pandan, Panabo City. At approximately ten past one in the afternoon, they were ambushed while in traffic by two men riding a motorcycle, who shot Denora multiple times in the head and body and Revira twice in his right hand. After the attack, Revira was able to drive approximately 300 meters to escape the assailants. Authorities later recovered three fired bullets and one fired cartridge from a caliber .45 pistol. = Investigation = Local authorities and governmental task forces investigated the murder, offering a reward of 100,000 Philippine pesos for information that could lead to an arrest. Denora's friends offered an additional 200,000 Philippine pesos for such information. A Special Investigation Task Group (SITG) called \\"Task Force Denora\\" was created to investigate the murder, consisting of a Deputy Regional Director for Operations, Provincial Director, Criminal Investigation and Detection Group, the Provincial Crime Laboratory Office, the Provincial Investigation and Detective Management Branch, and a Provincial Legal Officer. The SITG worked alongside the Presidential Task Force on Media Security (PTFOMS) in conducting the investigation, resulting in the discovery and analysis of closed circuit television footage and Denora's mobile phone. Investigators suspected the involvement of a high-level politician in Denora's murder, with several of Denora's colleagues claiming that he had been arguing with a government official shortly before his murder. Reporters questioned former Speaker of the House of Representatives Pantaleon Alvarez about the incident due to his previous lawsuit against Denora for libel. Alvarez denied any involvement in Denora's murder and claimed to be outside of the country at the time the murder occurred. = Aftermath = Denora's murder caused an increase in the amount of attention paid to motorcycle attacks in the Philippines, which have resulted in hundreds of unsolved murder cases over the past few decades. Police Chief Director General Oscar Albayalde proposed that stickers be attached to every motorcycle in the country to facilitate the identification of suspects. Friends and colleagues of Denora advocated for a nationwide ban of tinted motorcycle helmets as well as stricter gun laws. In the wake of the deaths of Denora and several Filipino prosecutors, Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque stated that President Rodrigo Duterte was frustrated with the killings and corruption in the Philippines. Roque stated that Duterte was considering \\"radical changes\\" such as the declaration of a state of national emergency. Filipino Congressman Antonio Floirendo Jr. said in a statement that the killing \\"underscored the threat media faces when exposing the evils of society, particularly the lies that some sectors peddle in order to gain public support.\\" Floirendo Jr. went on to honor Denora as a man of \\"decency, integrity, and a strong commitment to seek the journalistic truth.\\" The National Union of Journalists in the Philippines (NUJP) organized a protest during which journalists and friends of Denora lit candles in his honor. At the event, NUJP Chairperson Jo Clemente stated, \\"This should be the last. The list of journalists killed in the Philippines should not increase.\\" Other journalists commented on the crime, criticizing the lack of accountability which had allowed for the murders to continue. = International reactions = Daniel Bastard, the head of Reporters without Borders' Asia Pacific desk, wrote in a statement that \\"the current government keeps on pointing to this task force, created in October 2016, as evidence of its desire to protect journalists but this is the 6th journalist to be murdered since Rodrigo Duterte became president. The authorities must take more concrete measures to guarantee journalists' safety.\\" Audrey Azoulay, the Director General of UNESCO, condemned the murder, saying that \\"it is essential for freedom of expression and press freedom, for democracy and rule of law, that the authorities ensure this crime does not go unpunished.\\"  See also  *Crime in the Philippines  References  Category:1951 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Filipino radio journalists Category:Murdered journalists Category:Deaths by firearm in the Philippines Category:Journalists killed in the Philippines Category:People from Davao del Norte ","title":"Dennis Denora"},{"id":"58629300","text":"Pickler & Ben is an American syndicated daytime talk show hosted by country singer Kellie Pickler and media personality Ben Aaron, focusing on lifestyle, beauty, celebrity and advertorial segments, along with the subjects of human interest stories. The series premiered on September 18, 2017. The series also had a \\"shop the show\\" advertorial segments tying into merchandise featured by cable shopping network HSN and its website. In March 2019, it was announced that Pickler & Ben was cancelled after two seasons. The final episode aired on May 22, 2019. Production Pickler & Ben launched on September 18, 2017, being exclusive in that season to the stations of the producing television station group E. W. Scripps Company, along with a late night cable replay on CMT for nationwide coverage of the series. The show is recorded in Nashville and hosted by Scripps' CBS affiliate WTVF, and is recorded with a live audience at Skyway Studios, the former north Nashville studio facility of the Christian Broadcasting Network. Multiple episodes are taped throughout a period of days each month, with Ben Aaron flying into Nashville from his New York home. On January 16, 2018, it was announced that Pickler & Ben was renewed for season 2. The renewal came with much-wider distribution, as Disney–ABC Domestic Television now distributes the series to a wider base of affiliates outside of Scripps, including ABC's large-market base of O&O; stations (with CMT not carrying it in subsequent seasons). Season 2 premiered on September 17, 2018. On March 1, 2019, it was announced that the show would not be picked up for a third season and, thus, ended its run in May 2019, mainly due to potential time slots being blocked out in major markets by ABC O&O; stations and NBC Owned Television Stations for new talk shows hosted by Kelly Clarkson and Tamron Hall, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas-Fort Worth and others; this would have left Pickler & Ben in undesirable late night slots in the future. Aaron remains employed by Scripps; he is now a features reporter for new Scripps New York flagship station WPIX-TV and their morning newscasts. Repeats of Pickler & Ben aired until February 2020 on the Live Well Network, a digital subchannel network on ABC's owned-and-operated stations, after which it was converted to a new concept, Localish.

Overheating was generalised by Elwyn Berlekamp for the analysis of Blockbusting. Chilling (or unheating) and warming are variants used in the analysis of the endgame of Go. (paperback version of Mathematical Go: Chilling Gets the Last Point) Cooling and chilling may be thought of as a tax on the player who moves, making them pay for the privilege of doing so, while heating, warming and overheating are operations that more or less reverse cooling and chilling.  Basic operations: cooling, heating  The cooled game G_t (\\" G cooled by t \\") for a game G and a (surreal) number t is defined byBerlekamp, Conway & Guy (1982), p. 147 :: G_t = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\\\\\{ G^L_t - t \\\\mid G^R_t + t \\\\\\\\} & \\\\text { for all numbers } t \\\\leq \\\\text{ any number } \\\\tau \\\\text{ for which } G_\\\\tau \\\\text{ is infinitesimally close to some number } m \\\\text{ , }\\\\\\\\\\\\ G_t = m & \\\\text{ for } t > \\\\tau \\\\end{cases} .

Heating is the inverse of cooling and is defined as the \\"integral\\"Berlekamp, Conway & Guy (1982), p. 163 :: \\\\int^t G = \\\\begin{cases} G & \\\\text{ if } G \\\\text{ is a number, } \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\{ \\\\int^t (G^L) + t \\\\mid \\\\int^t (G^R) - t \\\\\\\\} & \\\\text{ otherwise. } \\\\end{cases}  Multiplication and overheating  Norton multiplication is an extension of multiplication to a game G and a positive game U (the \\"unit\\") defined byBerlekamp, Conway & Guy (1982), p. 246 :: G.U = \\\\begin{cases} G \\\\times s & \\\\text{ (i.e. the sum of } G \\\\text{ copies of } s \\\\text{) if } G \\\\text{ is a non-negative integer, } \\\\\\\\\\\\ -G \\\\times -s & \\\\text{ if } G \\\\text{ is a negative integer, } \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\{ G^L.U + (U + I) \\\\mid G^R.U - (U + I) \\\\\\\\} \\\\text { where } I \\\\text { ranges over } \\\\Delta (U) & \\\\text{ otherwise. } \\\\end{cases} The incentives \\\\Delta (U) of a game U are defined as \\\\\\\\{ u - U : u \\\\in U^L \\\\\\\\} \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{ U - u : u \\\\in U^R \\\\\\\\} . Overheating is an extension of heating used in Berlekamp's solution of Blockbusting, where G overheated from s to t is defined for arbitrary games G, s, t with s > 0 as Berlekamp (1987), p. 77 :: \\\\int_s^t G = \\\\begin{cases} G . s & \\\\text{ if } G \\\\text{ is an integer, } \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\{ \\\\int_s^t (G^L) + t \\\\mid \\\\int_s^t (G^R) - t \\\\\\\\} & \\\\text{ otherwise. } \\\\end{cases} Winning Ways also defines overheating of a game G by a positive game X , asBerlekamp, Conway & Guy (1982), p. 170 :: \\\\int_0^t G = \\\\\\\\{ \\\\int_0^t (G^L) + X \\\\mid \\\\int_0^t (G^R) - X \\\\\\\\} : Note that in this definition numbers are not treated differently from arbitrary games. : Note that the \\"lower bound\\" 0 distinguishes this from the previous definition by Berlekamp  Operations for Go: chilling and warming  Chilling is a variant of cooling by 1 used to analyse the Go endgame of Go and is defined byBerlekamp & Wolfe (1994), p. 53 :: f(G) = \\\\begin{cases} m & \\\\text{ if } G \\\\text{ is of the form } m \\\\text{ or } m * \\\\text{ , } \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\{ f(G^L) - 1 \\\\mid F(G^R) + 1 \\\\\\\\} & \\\\text{ otherwise }. \\\\end{cases} This is equivalent to cooling by 1 when G is an \\"even elementary Go position in canonical form\\".Berlekamp & Wolfe (1994), pp. 53–55 Warming is a special case of overheating, namely \\\\int_{1*}^1 , normally written simply as \\\\int which inverts chilling when G is an \\"even elementary Go position in canonical form\\".

This was the only administrative office that it maintained in northern East Africa after their withdrawal from Kilwa. Origin The origin of the office lay in a government trading factory which had been set up in Malindi in April 1509 and whose special purpose was to have been as a purchasing center for goods needed for the Sofala gold trade Appointment The office was usually awarded as a Royal favor but on occasion was also leased out Administrative duties The responsibilities of the captaincy were the general supervision of Portuguese interests along the coast. Official duties The known duties of the office were the issuing of ships passes. Trade The activities of the trading factory continued after the establishment of the office and it has been suggested that the holder attached more importance to conducting this trade than to carrying out their official duties. There is every indication that trade was carried out as private enterprise and not on an official capacity though there are none as to how this trade was actually conducted. There are also no indications of direct trade with Portugal and it is thus assumed that all trade was carried out with India. =Monopolies= The holder of this office held monopolies in the exports of ivory, coir and a resin referred to as 'breu' and which is assumed to be gum copal. They also held monopolies in the import of Indian cotton goods and it is also thought that the holder might have had monopolies on the export of Ambegris. The monopoly exercised did not extend beyond these articles.

He was the founder of the influential Novine Serbske (Serbian News) together with Dimitrije Davidović in Vienna during the Serbian Enlightenment. He was a well-respected physician in his day who played an important role in the construction of a new hospital  Ospedale Maggiore  in Trieste. Biography Dimitrije Frušić was born in today's Vojvodina, in the village of Divoš, near Sremska Mitrovica in Fruška Gora, then part of the Habsburg Monarchy. He originates from a noble family Frušić. Dimitrije Frušić studied philosophy and medicine at the University of Vienna and became a doctor in 1815. At the university, he studied art and architecture as well. While still a medical student in Vienna, he and Dimitrije Davidović, launched the Novine Serbske on 17 August 1813. When the newspaper ran its course, Dimitrije Frušić, now a graduate from Medical School, left Vienna in 1819 for Trieste where he opened his practice and worked at a hospital there. Frušić designed plans for the construction of a new hospital, Ospedale Maggiore. He was also an active participant in the literary and political life of the city. As a student in Vienna Frušić, who had an excellent command of the German language, served as an interpreter for Serbian envoy and Prota (priest) Matija Nenadović in the company of the Austrian emperor on two occasions. At that time he and Davidović also met Vuk Karadžić and Jernej Kopitar who were working on the language reform. In the modest premises of his printing shop, Frušić opened a Reading Room equipped with Serbian books and Novine Serbske that also became a meeting place for intellectuals. Always impressed with Vuk Karadžić's work, Frušić raised money for the scholar with the help of such friends as Joakim Vujić, Atanasije Stojković, Pavle Solarić, and the wealthy Teodoroviches of Trieste. He supported Vuk's reforms along with many other intellectuals in Trieste and elsewhere at the time. Dimitrije Frušić died in Trieste where he was buried in a Serbian cemetery. Family life He was married to Jovanka, daughter of Lazar and Ana Lukić of Dubrovnik. They had three children: Čedomilj (born 6 February 1826; d. 1835), Dušan (born March 7, 1827; d. 1896) and Milica (born 17 July 1831; d. 1911).

Modern movement In 2004, Shakespeare's Globe, in London, produced three performances of Romeo and Juliet in original pronunciation. Spearheaded by linguist David Crystal and play director, Tim Carroll, this was the beginning of contemporary interest in Shakespeare in original pronunciation. In 2005, the Globe went on to produce six performances of Troilus and Cressida in original pronunciation. Since then, there have been many further productions of Shakespeare in original pronunciation, including A Midsummer Night's Dream in 2010 by the University of Kansas and Twelfth Night in 2012 by the American Theatre of Actors. Motivations Shakespeare's Early Modern English was a time of great linguistic change for the English language. One change that was then taking place was the Great Vowel Shift, which changed the pronunciation of long vowels. Many words of Early Modern English were pronounced differently from today's standard pronunciation of Modern English. According to linguist David Crystal, Shakespeare in Original Pronunciation is \\"Shakespeare as hopefully he would have heard it.... It sounds raw and from the heart, which is very different from the way I think Shakespeare has been performed for the last half century or so.\\" Also, audiences hearing Shakespeare in contemporary pronunciation often miss hearing rhymes and puns that worked well in Early Modern English. On the other hand, Laura Lodewyck, Assistant Professor of Theatre at North Central College, comments that \\"there are limits to the OP enterprise. Some texts, for instance, may be better suited to OP performance than others.\\" Examples =Pun= An example of a Shakespearean pun that no longer works in Modern English comes from the prologue of Romeo and Juliet, Act 1, lines 5-6: > From forth the fatal loins of these two foes > A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life In Modern English, the word \\"lines\\" does not carry the double meaning of the Early Modern English, when both lines and loins were pronounced as \\"loynes\\". Thus, Modern English audiences miss the pun. Another example is the pronunciation of \\"hour\\", as in As You Like It: > And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe. > And then from hour to hour we rot and rot. > And thereby hangs a tale. In Early Modern English, \\"our\\" was pronounced \\"oar\\", which was also the pronunciation of \\"whore\\", the \\"h\\" being regularly dropped. The change in pronunciation of both words in Modern English means that a rude sex joke is missed by a modern audience. =Rhyme= An example of a Shakespearean rhyme that no longer works in Modern English comes from A Midsummer Night's Dream, Act 3, Scene II, lines 104-106: > Flower of this purple dye, Hit with Cupid's archery, Sink in apple of his > eye. In Modern English pronunciation, the rhyme does not work in all lines, but in Original Pronunciation, all three lines rhyme. Reactions The audience reaction to Shakespeare in Original Pronunciation varies. Laura Lodewyck cites a New York Times review of the 2005 production of Troilus and Cressida in which the reviewer states: \\"Soaring Shakespearean lines, such as 'Her hand / In whose comparison all whites are ink,' evaporate like a cough in the theatre... the waves of words produce a mesmerizing static, sort of like listening to poetry underwater.\\" Alternatively, David Crystal writes that audience members often connect to the performance through the pronunciation and comments, \\"We speak like that where we come from.\\" However, as Lodewyck also notes, as a leading expert in that area of study, Crystal has reasons to be biased toward such productions. As well, Original Pronunciation can have an effect on the actors involved. Ben Crystal, a Shakespearean actor and son of David Crystal, comments on the way Shakespeare in original pronunciation affects his body and vocal register: \\"It drops your center.... With OP, it comes down towards your stomach and your groin. It changes the way you move. I go from speaking in a very, in a much sort of higher quality of my voice, and I get down more into the gravelly part of my resonance. It has tremendous ramifications, from male to female, old to young, anybody that I've seen use OP, the effect's the same.\\" Although the beginning of the Globe's foray into Original Pronunciation showed that older actors had more difficulty in embracing it, successful performances eventually occurred.

It was first observed on 13 October 2015, by astronomers at the Mauna Kea Observatories, Hawaii. Based on its discovery date and the letters in its provisional designation , the object was informally nicknamed \\"The Goblin\\" by its discoverers and later named Leleākūhonua, comparing its orbit to the flight of migratory birds. It was the third sednoid discovered, after and , and measures approximately in diameter.  Discovery  Leleākūhonua was first observed on 13 October 2015 at the Mauna Kea Observatory , by American astronomers David Tholen, Chad Trujillo and Scott Sheppard during their astronomical survey for objects located beyond the Kuiper Cliff. The unofficial discovery was publicly announced on 1 October 2018. The survey uses two principal telescopes: For the Northern hemisphere, the 8.2-meter Subaru Telescope with its Hyper Suprime Camera at Mauna Kea Observatories, Hawaii, and for the Southern hemisphere, the 4-meter Blanco telescope and its Dark Energy Camera at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. For follow- up observations to determine an object's orbit, the astronomers are using the Magellan and the Discovery Channel telescopes. The survey's discoveries include , and .  Orbit and classification  Leleākūhonua orbits the Sun at a distance of once roughly every 32,000 years (semi-major axis of ~1080 AU). Its orbit has a very high eccentricity of 0.94 and an inclination of with respect to the ecliptic. It belongs to the extreme trans-Neptunian objects defined by their large semi-major axis and is the third sednoid ever to be discovered, after and (\\"Biden\\"). = Implications of orbit = Along with the similar orbits of other distant trans-Neptunian objects, the orbit of Leleākūhonua suggests, but does not prove, the existence of a hypothetical Planet Nine in the outer Solar System. , the object is inbound 78 AU from the Sun; about two-and-a-half times farther out than Pluto's current location. It will come to perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) in 2078. As with Sedna, it would not have been found had it not been on the inner leg of its long orbit. This suggests that there may be many similar objects, most too distant to be detected by contemporary technological methods. Following the discovery of Leleākūhonua, Sheppard et al. concluded that it implies a population of about 2 million inner Oort cloud objects larger than , with a combined total mass of , which is several times the mass of the asteroid belt.  Numbering and naming  This minor planet was by the Minor Planet Center on 10 October 2019 (). In June 2020, it was formally Leleākūhonua, allegedly a lifeform mentioned in the Hawaiian creation chant, the Kumulipo, though the name/phrase does not actually occur there. Like other recently coined Hawaiian names for astronomical objects, it is more likely a descriptive phrase. The discoverers state (in English) that the name \\"compares the orbit to the flight of migratory birds and evokes a yearning to be near Earth\\" and (in Hawaiian) me he manu i ke ala pōaiapuni lā, he paa mau nō ia i ka hui me kona pūnana i kumu mai ai (like a bird on a path circling the sun, it is forever seeking a leeward wind back toward home).  Physical characteristics  The size of Leleākūhonua depends on the assumed albedo (reflectivity); if it is a darker object then it would also have to be larger; a higher albedo would demand that it be smaller. The faint object has a visual magnitude of 24.64, comparable to the visual magnitudes of Pluto's smaller moons. It was initially estimated to be in diameter under the assumption of an albedo of 0.15, though observations of a single-chord stellar occultation at Penticton, Canada on 20 October 2018 suggested a smaller diameter of , corresponding to a higher albedo of 0.21.

People think about their future selves similarly to how they think about other people. The extent to which people feel psychologically connected (e.g., similarity, closeness) to their future self influences how well they treat their future self. When people feel connected to their future self, they are more likely to save for retirement, make healthy decisions, and avoid ethical transgressions. Interventions that increase feelings of connectedness with future selves can improve future-oriented decision making across these domains.  Philosophical foundations  Derek Parfit influenced the psychological research on the future self. Psychological research on the future self often attributes its theoretical foundations to the philosopher Derek Parfit. Parfit argued that people might differ in the extent to which they feel similar and connected to themselves in the future. Under Parfit's conceptualization, people act rationally by basing their concern for their future on the degree of connectedness between present and future selves. According to Parfit, it is rational for people who perceive very little connectedness with their future self to act in ways that neglect the future self (e.g., by smoking). The psychological work that followed did not similarly argue for Parfit's normative view but has instead attempted to test the descriptive validity of Parfit's theory.  Psychological theory  Social psychological and neurological evidence suggests that people think about themselves in the future similarly to how they think about other people. Just as feeling close to others increases prosocial giving, feeling close to one's future self motivates people to delay present gratification in order to benefit themselves in the future. = Measuring psychological connectedness = Shane Frederick initially tested whether the degree of connectedness with the future self is associated with less discounting of future benefits (in dollar amounts and time). Asking subjects how similar they felt to their future selves on a 1-100 scale, Frederick did not find a statistically significant relationship between the degree of connectedness and discounting of future benefits. However, later researchers argued Frederick did not find a connection because of the way he measured connectedness. In 2009, Hal Hershfield and colleagues introduced a new measurement of psychological connectedness by adapting the Inclusion of Other in the Self Scale, where the relationship between present and future selves is depicted with seven pairs of successively overlapping circles. Using this measurement, Hershfield, as well as Daniel Bartels and Oleg Urminsky, have now demonstrated a robust relationship between psychological connectedness and discount rates. The more psychologically connectedness people feel between present and future selves, the more they care about the future, and the less they discount future benefits. = Manipulating psychological connectedness = The research that followed showed systematic ways to enhance psychological connectedness. Experiments have manipulated connectedness by having participants: # Interact with a visual depiction of their future self (increased connectedness) # List ways in which they expect to be similar to themselves in the future (increased connectedness) # Expect an upcoming event (e.g., college graduation) to fundamentally change who they are (decreased connectedness) The randomized experiments revealed a causal relationship between feeling connected to one's future self and subsequently making more patient long-term decisions.  Policy applications  = Finances = In one of the first experiments to enhance psychological connectedness with the future self, participants were given immersive virtual reality technology and instructed to look at themselves in a virtual mirror. The experimenters randomized whether participants saw an age-progressed version of themselves (meant to look approximately 70 years old) or a current-aged self. Participants that interacted with their future self were more likely to delay present monetary rewards and indicated greater intentions to save for retirement. Leveraging the insights from this experiment, firms such as Merrill Lynch have since adopted web applications with age-progressing software in order to increase retirement savings. The finding has been conceptually replicated with multiple diverse samples. In one field experiment, students from economically diverse backgrounds that had weekly interactions with an avatar of their future self demonstrated heightened performance during a financial education course. A team of researchers, in collaboration with Ideas42, launched another replication with thousands of Mexican citizens. Before deciding whether to sign-up for an automatic savings account, the treatment group was asked to spend time vividly imagining their lives in the distant future. Compared to a 1% take up rate in the control condition, 3% of people in the treatment condition enrolled in the automatic savings account. The effect of psychological connectedness on financial decision making is moderated by knowledge about future outcomes. When people are unaware of their future financial needs, regardless of how connected they feel, they are unlikely to save for the future. Similarly, people that have full information about the consequences of their financial actions will only save if they also feel connectedness with their future self. The researchers argue that policy makers who provide information to consumers on retirement savings should also consider simultaneously enhancing psychological connectedness. People are most likely to save rather than spend when they are knowledgeable about the outcomes of their decisions and feel connected to their future selves. In 2017, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau included a measure of psychological connectedness to the future self in its first Financial Wellbeing Survey. = Health = Applying the existing theory, researchers hypothesized that increasing feelings of connectedness with the future self should cause people to make healthier dieting and exercising decisions. Correlational evidence suggests that feeling psychologically connected to the future self corresponds with greater self-reported health. In randomized experiments, participants that wrote in detail about a distant future self were more likely to exercise in the days following the intervention. = Ethicality = People engage in ethically dubious behavior because they tend to neglect the potential future consequences of their behavior, but feeling connected to one's future self should lead them to discount the future less and thus avoid ethical transgressions. Experiments have found that assigning participants to write about their future selves can decrease support for unethical negotiation strategies. In another set of experiments, after interacting with a 40-year old version of themselves in immersive virtual reality, college students were less likely to cheat on a following task. In a field experiment in the Netherlands, high schoolers that received texts from an avatar of their future self were less likely to engage in delinquent and anti-social behavior.  Related constructs  = Possible selves = Possible selves are specific ideas about who one might become in the future. Possibles selves include the ideal selves people hope to become, other selves who people could become, and selves people are afraid of becoming. Possible selves can serve as a roadmap to guide individuals from where they are in the present to where they imagine being in the future. When the possible selves who people imagine are unattainable fantasies, rather than reasonable expectations, effort and performance are lower across educational, dating, and medical contexts. = Want-should conflicts = Want-should conflicts refer to internal conflicts between one's want self and one's should self. The theory assumes people simultaneously hold two sets of preferences; one associated with their want self (i.e., present-focused, hedonistic) and one associated with their should self (i.e., future-focused, utilitarian). Interventions that seek to increase patient decision making, for example, can use commitment devices to ensure people act on their should preferences and avoid succumbing to their want preferences. = Delayed gratification = Enhancing psychological connectedness to the future self can improve ability to delay gratification. Walter Mischel devoted a chapter to the future self in his book, The Marshmallow Test.

He met Pierre Dutot in Grasse in 1994 during an internship and joined his class at the Conservatoire de Lyon in 1997 after having obtained a special exemption given his young age (13 years). He perfected his skills there until 2000, also learning the baroque trumpet with Jean-François Madeuf,Jean-François Madeuf already developing his taste for playing the works studied on the original instruments of the composition. At the age of eleven, he participated in L'École des fans dedicated to Maurice André and five years later won the 1st Grand Prix de la Ville de Paris of the famous .

Their Distance stars Ren, Fumiko Aoyagi, Minhyun, Hanae Kan, JR, Haruka Kinami, and Tateto Serizawa. The plot is centered around different ideas of love, from generational to cultural, told in a nonlinear narrative switching from various days in April to illustrate the perspectives of all the characters. Part of the film is in spoken Korean, with the film using actors who were fluent in Korean. The film was first screened at the 28th Tokyo International Film Festival on October 23, 2015, before being released to the general public on January 9, 2016. Plot Kim Leon is a quiet apprentice working at a custom shoe shop in Japan. Two years ago, he ran a red light on his bicycle, causing Mikio Arakawa to get hit by a car and be permanently paralyzed below his waist. Overcome with guilt, Leon becomes withdrawn and does not notice that his co-worker, Akiko Kokaze, is in love with him. On April 2, college student Yoo Ji-woo confesses to his Japanese teacher, Kanako Koda, that he is in love with both her and his girlfriend, Han Suna. On April 3, Ji-woo tells Suna, who gets drunk to cope with the shock. Leon finds her on the morning of April 4 sleeping on his favorite park bench. As Suna leaves, she breaks the heel off her shoe, and her co-worker and friend, Nam Sang-soo, takes her shoes for repair. Captivated by Suna, Leon recognizes her shoes, and on April 5, he begins secretly following her home after her shift ends to make sure she arrives safely. Meanwhile, Sang-soo, who has fallen in love with Kokaze, asks Kanako to translate a love letter he is writing to her. As Kanako does so, Arakawa suggests that they separate, as he and her parents feel that his injury is burdening her. On April 6, Sang-soo picks up the repaired shoes, and, suspicious of Leon's sudden change in behavior, Kokaze begins following him in secret. On April 8, Sang-soo finishes writing his letter and gives it to Kokaze on April 9. While Ji-woo sorts out his confused feelings with Kanako, he also encourages her to make up with Arakawa. Suna begins looking for the park where she met Leon and admits to Sang-soo later that night that she hopes to meet him again. She drunkenly kisses him when he takes her home, and after he leaves, she continues to describe her feelings to Leon himself, mistaking him for Sang-soo. When Leon confides in her his guilt towards Arakawa's accident, believing he doesn't deserve to be happy, Suna encourages him to move forward. After their conversation, Leon stops following her home. On April 13, Kokaze turns down Sang-soo's confession because of her feelings for Leon. She and Sang-soo piece together that Leon is attracted to Suna, but Sang-soo believes that he has stopped following her because he had seen them kiss. Unaware that the person Suna is looking for is Leon, Kokaze suggests helping her, believing that Suna's inevitable rejection will allow Leon the chance to pursue her. On April 16, Kokaze and Sang-soo help Suna look for the park to no avail, to which Suna concludes that she may never see Leon again. In the evening, she confronts Ji-woo about her newfound feelings for Leon and suggests breaking up, hoping to confirm he still cares for her. Kanako and Arakawa reconcile and decide to get married. They visit the shoe shop on April 17 to buy Kanako a new pair of shoes. Leon is overcome with relief that Kanako and Arakawa are still happily in love and have forgiven him. At the same time, Suna and Ji-woo make up and decide to stay together. Recalling Suna's advice from earlier, Leon finally reveals himself to personally thank her. When he returns to the shoe shop, he tells Kokaze that he's changed because he fell in love.

The commission was created due to its inclusion as one of the measures in the “Accord for National Reconciliation and the Strengthening of Democracy in Honduras\\". This agreement was created in response to the 2009 Honduran coup d'état which took place on June 28, where military troops were involved in the removal of former president Manuel Zelaya from office, in response to the 2009 Honduran constitutional crisis. The report itself collected a significant amount of information and testimonies from the public, and released a report detailing the abuses committed towards 20 of the victims. This report also criticized the role of several actors in the coup, such as de facto president Roberto Micheletti, and presented a list of recommendations for the Honduran government.  Background  On the morning of June 28 2009, military troops in Honduras stormed the house of president Manuel Zelaya, who had been in power since November 2005. These troops surrounded his residence, disarmed and beat his security guards, before arresting him and sending him on a plane to Costa Rica to live in exile. What sparked this event had been a disagreement in response to president Zelaya’s proposed changes to the constitution. One of the most controversial was a proposed removal of the presidential term limit, which many critics saw as a self-serving move to extend his own rule. When congress voted against this measure and tried to intervene, Zelaya refused to cancel the referendum, leading to congress ordering the removal of Zelaya from office. Following the ousting of president Zelaya, there was further political conflict. Several dozen high ranking government officials including the foreign minister were all taken captive, and ambassadors from other countries which supported the Zelaya government were detained and beaten, however later released. The new military government also committed a range of crimes in the period succeeding including the killing of opposition activists.  Commission  = Establishment = On October 30 2009, the San Jose accords were agreed upon by representatives from each of Micheletti and Zelaya’s camps, in response to the military coup that had occurred, with the aim of ending the political turmoil and restoring a level of peace to the country. One of the key mandates was the creation of the CVR, or the Honduras Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Whilst both parties would later go against the terms of the accord, essentially voiding it, the new president, Porfirio Lobo Sosa, was elected shortly after on 29 November 2009, and he supported the contents of the accord with the backing of international actors such as the United States. The work of the new commission began in May 2010. = Mandate and structure = The commission was set to run for at least 8 months, with a likely end date of early 2011, but was later delayed until July. The commission was funded by countries such as the United States and Spain. President Lobo selected five members for the commission, which included two Hondurans, and three foreigners. The first member selected was Eduardo Stein, who was a former vice-president of Guatemala, and was in charge of both writing the charter of and assisting in the picking of foreign candidates for the commission. The two other foreign members selected were Michael Kergin, formerly a Canadian Ambassador in the United States, and María Zavala Valladares, who was formerly a President of the Supreme Court in Peru, and held other high ranking positions. The two Hondurans selected by Lobo were Omar Casco and Julieta Castellanos, both of whom have served as Rector of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras. The mandate of the commission was to “Clarify the events that occurred prior to and after June 28, 2009 in Honduras, with the goal of identifying the acts that led to the crisis situation and providing the people of Honduras with elements to prevent such incidents from recurring in the future\\". = Report and findings = The commission wrote the report using public information collected, reports by human rights organisations and the media, and testimonies from over 250 members of the public with knowledge of the violations committed. The final report, So That the Events Will Not Be Repeated, was presented by Eduardo Stein to President Lobo and other high ranking officials in July 2011. The commission referenced Zelaya’s proposed changes and actions as key issues which caused the crisis, and that he had broken the law when he had ignored the urges of congress with regards to cancelling the referendum. The commission also said, however, that it was illegal for congress to have removed the president from office and appointed an interim president, Micheletti, in the meantime. It identified that what had occurred was a Coup d'état and identified that 20 people had been killed by the military government or actors following the coup, and detailed these violations. The commission also found that the police and army had obstructed investigations into some of the human rights violations, and attributed responsibility for the violations to several key actors including de facto President Micheletti. The commission made a list with more than 80 total recommendations to the Honduran government, such as increasing political transparency, police reforms, and providing conditions which would ensure that human rights defenders could work free from harassment or obstruction. This included seven key recommendations relating to human rights including the following: *pursuing, prosecuting and punishing perpetrators of human rights abuses committed during the interim government; *establishing a national plan of reparations for those having legitimate and verifiable human rights grievances; *providing sufficient resources and independence to the Public Prosecutor’s Office, in order that it may respond promptly to human rights complaints; *conducting an independent review of the actions of the human rights commissioner during the interim government; *reviewing legislation to ensure that Honduran law is compatible with international norms and standards, particularly in relation to personal security related to freedom of expression – especially that of journalists – and freedom of association; *guaranteeing that tribal and indigenous people have access to justice in their own language; and *ensuring compliance with the International Labour Organization convention regarding the duty to consult about the use and exploitation of natural resources in aboriginal territories. =Criticism= There has been a mixed response to the commission. Much criticism has been levelled at the fact that there was no mandate to investigate human rights violations or abuses during or following the coup. There has also been criticism for the members selected, none of whom had a significant background in human rights, the fact that several of the members hail from countries which were supportive, and into the large role that the international community played in forming the truth commission. The distrust towards President Lobo also manifested itself into a general distrust towards the commission.  Aftermath  The report itself had limited impact on society in Honduras, due to factors such as the distrust for President Lobo, however, some groups welcomed the information presented and admittance of wrongdoing, and it was met by praise from Secretary General of the OAS, José Miguel Insulza, who thought it would likely result in positive change for Honduran society. As of October 2013, Honduras has reported to have complied with 32 of the recommendations, be in the process with complying with 37 more, and are yet to implement the final 17. Honduras, however, also reported that they had failed to prosecute and investigate those responsible for the violations during the coup. There have been reports that politically motivated attacks on opposition supporters have continued under President Lobo. An alternative truth commission, the Comisión de Verdad (CDV) was set up by human rights groups due to many of the criticisms.

One of the very few schooling systems where Ancient Greek is still a compulsory subject, is Italy. Ancient Greek is usually treated as a written language in formal instruction. Curriculum requirements in Europe =Italy= In Italy, Ancient Greek is a compulsory subject only for liceo classico schools students. Students of different Italian schools aren't required to study Ancient Greek. Since liceo classico students amount to 6.7 percent of Italian high school students, it can be concluded that about 6.7 percent of Italian students actually study Ancient Greek. Inside liceo classico, Ancient Greek courses last for the whole high school five-year study period, and, together with Latin it takes up a significant amount of time and effort to students. During the first two years of high school, students study, among other things, the grammar of both Latin and Ancient Greek, while in the remaining three years are mostly devoted to Latin literature and Ancient Greek literature. In Italy, Ancient Greek, together with Latin, is deemed to be highly educative for students. Those languages are believed to provide a successful study method and to \\"open one's mind\\" (, as it is said), which means to make the students more skilled and willing to study, and also to significantly improve language skills, and it is deemed to improve the student's skills not only in the field of humanities, but in any field. Students who study Ancient Greek and Latin are said to perform better than other students both at university and in their career, but there is no conclusive statistical evidence for it. Italian liceo classico students are required to translate short texts from Ancient Greek ( the so- called ) and Latin almost on a daily basis, and it takes up a considerable amount of the time spent by students for homework. In Italy, the compulsory study of Ancient Greek have been both praised and criticized. It has been suggested that Italian schooling system should be revised to meet the international modern education standards, but very little has changed inside Italian schools when the study of Ancient Greek and Latin are considered. Italian physicist Guido Tonelli also attended liceo classico high school, and he said that the translation of short texts from Ancient Greek and Latin is comparable to \\"scientific research\\"; it's also supposed to be a useful mental exercise. Some Italian newspapers also praised Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates because they had studied Latin and Ancient Greek at high school, and some newspapers even claimed that this was the key to their success. According to the sources, without the knowledge of these disciplines they would have been \\"underpaid employees\\". Other sources, however, pointed out that Mark Zuckerberg was very clever on his own, he had studied in elite institutions, he also knew Hebrew and other ancient and modern languages, and he had knowledge in various fields. Moreover, it is unclear how many hours Zuckerberg and Gates actually devoted to these subjects, perhaps only a small part compared to the significant amount of weekly periods required by Italian liceo classico schools. Last but not least, other successful entrepreneurs, such as Steve Jobs, did not know Latin and Ancient Greek.

Along with Ruperto Donoso of Chile, and, later, his younger brother Antonio Fernandez, he was among the first Latin–American jockeys to find major success in the United States. He was born in Havana in 1906, and went to work at the nearby Oriental Park Racetrack, in Marianao, as a teenager.Cuban champion Fernando Fernandez, aboard Juanita, winner of the S.S. Washington Handicap, March 16, 1941, Oriental Park Racetrack, Havana, Cuba. Beginning as an exercise rider for trainer Henry \\"Pepito\\" Torriente, he took out his jockey's license in 1931. His first big break came when he travelled to the United States with Torriente's large stable in May 1934. Fernandez won his first American race at Beulah Park in Ohio and was an immediate riding sensation, winning races at various meets across the Midwest. A favorite of both fans and the press, his successes were regularly reported in local and national newspapers. He was famously involved in a physical altercation with jockey George Woolf, who slashed him across the back with a whip during a race at the Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans. In the jockey's room later, Woolf again attacked Fernandez, bruising his face and blackening an eye before being restrained by other riders. The beating resulted in Woolf's 10 day suspension and a fine by the racing authorities.Detroit Free Press, July 6, 1934.

During the purification process, the majority of the HCPs are removed (>99%), but residual HCP amounts remain in the distributed products, such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), antibody-drug-conjugates (ADCs), therapeutic proteins, vaccines, and other protein-based biopharmaceuticals. National regulatory authorizations, such as FDA and EMA, require that biopharmaceuticals must be analysed and purified to reduce HCPs to an acceptable level. The HCP acceptance level is evaluated case-by-case and depends on multiple factors including; dose, frequency of drug administration, type of drug and severity of disease. Analysis of HCPs is not simple, since the HCP mixture consists of a large number of protein species, which are unique to the specific host and not related to the intended recombinant protein. The acceptance level of HCPs has commonly been in the range 1–100 ppm (1–100 ng/mg product) due to the detection limit of the established analytical methods. Even with these trace levels of HCPs in the final product reaching the patient, it is unknown if specific residual protein impurities might affect protein stability or immunogenicity in the patient. If the stability is affected, durability of the active substance in a biopharmaceutical could decrease. It is also possible that the effect of the protein might be higher or lower than intended. The degree of immunogenicity on a long-term basis is practically impossible to determine and thus might be a relatively severe threat to the patient’s health.  Safety risk  It is crucial to characterise the HCP population in biopharmaceuticals due to the potential safety risk of introducing foreign proteins into the human immune system. With commonly applied host cell systems such as E. coli, yeast, the mouse myeloma cell line (NS0) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), the genetic differences between the host system and the human body are many. It is well established that a higher difference to human proteins increases the risk of immunogenicity and thus, a higher level of HCPs is suggested to elicit a more pronounced immune response. Several studies have linked a reduction in HCPs to a decline in specific inflammatory cytokines. Other HCPs may be very similar to a human protein and may induce an immune response with cross reactivity against the human protein or the drug substance protein. The exact consequences of HCPs for the individual patient is uncertain and difficult to determine with the current analytical methods applied in biopharmaceutical approval.  Analysis  During the production process several factors, including the genes of the host cell, the way of product expression and the purification steps, influence the HCP composition and abundance. Several studies report that HCPs often are co-purified along with the product itself by interacting with the recombinant protein. Therefore, the requirements for analytic instruments are extremely high and must be developed further to analyse the entire HCP population more thoroughly in a biopharmaceutical product. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the most commonly applied method for HCP analysis, mainly because it has been the only method with the required sensitivity to detect the low levels of HCPs. Even though the developmental process requires a significant period of work and several research animals, the analysis is rapidly performed and interpreted. However, there are several limitations associated with ELISA for HCP analysis. The HCP quantification relies mainly on the quantity and affinity of anti-HCP antibodies for detection of the HCP antigens. Anti-HCP antibody pools cannot cover the entire HCP population and weakly immunogenic proteins are impossible to detect, since equivalent antibodies are not generated in the process. It is apparent that HCP-ELISAs are insufficient alone for analysis of the HCP population, and therefore orthogonal methods providing complementary information are needed. = Future of HCP analysis = For a thorough evaluation on the risk of HCPs in biopharmaceuticals and for proper quality control of the manufacturing, it is of the essence that all HCPs are identified and quantified during the production process and in the final product. A suitable orthogonal method is ideally able to: * Detect varying protein concentrations in a complex sample * Track an ever-changing HCP population and their concentrations during a manufacturing process * Analyse many proteins at once * Measure low abundant HCPs overshadowed by the high abundant target protein product A method, which fulfills these requirements and emerges as the primary orthogonal method to ELISA, is mass spectrometry (MS). The main advantage of MS is the ability to identify the individual proteins of low abundance, when MS is coupled to liquid chromatography (LC-MS). Recently, the MS method has been further improved through the method SWATH LC-MS. SWATH is a data independent acquisition (DIA) form of mass spectrometry, where the mass range is partitioned in small mass windows, which are then analysed with tandem MS (MS/MS). The key advantages are the reproducibility for both individual HCP identification and absolute quantification by applying internal protein standards.

He was accused by the British of presiding over a number of acts of maritime piracy, an assertion he denied. Despite signing a treaty of peace with the British in October 1814, a punitive expeditionary force was mounted against Ras Al Khaimah in December 1819 and Hassan bin Rahma was removed as Sheikh of Ras Al Khaimah, which he ceded to the British in a preliminary agreement to the General Maritime Treaty of 1820.  Rule  The nephew of the Ruler of Emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi, Hassan bin Rahma emerged as the de facto Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah in 1814, although it is likely his rule started before this time. He was a dependent of the ruler of the first Saudi state, Abdulla Ibn Saud (and his father Saud bin Abdulaziz before him). During a visit to Abdulla in Riyadh in August 1814, Hassan bin Rahma received a letter from the British Resident at Bushire accusing him of responsibility for the theft of two boats from Bombay laden with grain. The boats were apparently appropriated by six Al Qasimi boats off Karachi on 14 January 1814, although the British agent's letter asserts that Al Qasimi vessels had captured six or eight boats off the coasts of Karachi and Sind. Hassan denied the charges, pointing out that the Al Qasimi's boats did, indeed, travel to Sind where they traded. However, he also made a careful distinction between British subjects and native craft of Indian origin and denied capturing any boat with British passes and colours. This was accepted by the Bushire Resident, William Bruce. On 6 October 1814, an agreement was drawn up between Bruce and a representative of Hassan bin Rahma's, in which the Al Qasimi acquiesced to respecting vessels flying the British flag and assuring both British and Al Qasimi ships safe passage to the ports of Ras Al Khaimah and India. Al Qasimi ships would be distinguished by flying a red flag carrying the text 'There is but one God and Mohammed is his Prophet' in the middle. = Accusations of piracy = However, soon after the signature of the agreement, a British boat was seized as it visited Ras Al Khaimah with letters for Hassan bin Rahma from Bruce and the envoy had suffered 'the most degrading treatment.' A series of incidents of 'piracy and plunder' then followed over the following four years, with the Al Qasimi laid firmly to blame by historian J. G. Lorimer, who asserted that the Al Qasimi \\"now indulged in a carnival of maritime lawlessness, to which even their own previous record presented no parallel\\". This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. British accusations against the Al Qasimi at this time have been described as the result of a combination of acts of legitimate war by them against Muscat (with which they were at war) and confusion with Qatari pirate Rahma bin Jabir. Whether the accusations were baseless, forming part of an attempt to curb Arab trade with India on the part of the East India Company (the argument put forward by Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi in his Myth of Piracy in the Arabian Gulf) or a catalogue of piratical acts, the end result was the same. The British were resolved to move against Ras Al Khaimah. In March 1819 Hassan bin Rahma went to the Ruler of Bahrain, Abdulla bin Ahmed, to mediate with the British and a release of prisoners (17 British subjects, all Indian women, were delivered to the British). His complaints to the British fell on deaf ears, as did his offer (of September 1819) to send three emissaries to negotiate a peace. Arriving at Bushire, the three representatives were turned back.  The fall of Ras Al Khaimah  Ras Al Khaimah under attack by the British in December 1819 In November 1819, the British embarked on an expedition against Ras Al Khaimah, led by Major-General William Keir Grant, with a platoon of 3,000 soldiers. The British extended an offer to Said bin Sultan of Muscat in which he would be made ruler of the Pirate Coast if he agreed to assist the British in their expedition. Obligingly, he sent a force of 600 men and two ships. The force gathered off the coast of Ras Al Khaimah on 25 and 26 November and, on 2 and 3 December, troops were landed and, on 5 December, the town was bombarded from both land and sea. Continued bombardment took place over the following four days until, on the 9th, the fortress and town of Ras Al Khaimah were stormed. On the fall of Ras Al Khaimah, three cruisers were sent to blockade Rams to the North and this, too was found to be deserted and its inhabitants retired to the 'impregnable' hill-top fort of Dhayah. The fort fell on 22 December. The rout of Ras Al Khaimah led to only five British casualties as opposed to the 400 to 1000 casualties reportedly suffered by the Al Qasimi. The town of Ras Al Khaimah was blown up and a garrison was established there, consisting of 800 sepoys and artillery. The expedition then visited Jazirat Al Hamra, which was deserted, but then went on to destroy the fortifications and larger vessels of Umm Al Qawain, Ajman, Fasht, Sharjah, Abu Hail and Dubai. Ten vessels which had taken shelter in Bahrain were also destroyed.  General Maritime Treaty  Defeated, Hassan bin Rahma gave himself up to the British and was imprisoned, but released when it was realised his imprisonment was widely unpopular. He signed a preliminary agreement which ceded the town of Ras Al Khaimah and the area of Maharah to the British for use as a garrison. The General Treaty for the Cessation of Plunder and Piracy by Land and Sea, dated 5 February 1820 was signed at variously at Ras Al Khaimah, Falayah Fort and Sharjah by the Sheikhs of Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm al-Quwain and Ras Al Khaimah and the British. Hassan bin Rahma signed the treaty as \\"Sheikh of 'Hatt and Falna', formerly of Ras Al Khaimah\\" ('Hatt' being the modern day village of Khatt and 'Falna' being the modern day suburb of Ras Al Khaimah, Fahlain near the location of Al Falayah Fort). The treaty having been signed by William Keir Grant and all of the Trucial Rulers, the Government in Bombay made clear that it was most dissatisfied with his leniency over the coastal tribes and desired, 'if it were not too late, to introduce some conditions of greater stringency'. The release of Husain bin Ali, the Wahhabi leader and chief of Rams and Dhayah, was particularly regretted. Hassan bin Rahma was deposed in 1820 and Sheikh Sultan Bin Saqr Al Qasimi, Ruler of Sharjah, also became Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah.

Formerly the residence of the governor of the citadel, it was refurbished for use as the summer residence of the Royal Family, which spent September there annually from 1870 until the assassination of King Dom Carlos in 1908. It was subsequently used as one of the official residences of Portuguese presidents, but over time fell into neglect. After extensive restoration it was opened as a museum in 2011. The Palace forms part of the Museum of the Presidency of the Republic, ('), which has its headquarters at the Belém Palace in Lisbon.  History  By 1870, Cascais had lost its strategic importance for the defence of the Lisbon coast and the River Tagus estuary and the citadel was no longer required for military purposes. King D. Luís adapted the old house of the governor to a vacation residence. The Royal Family popularised sea bathing and their presence in Cascais in September led to the Portuguese nobility also building houses in the town so they could be close to the King. The practice of Royal Family visits continued under King Dom Carlos until his assassination. King Carlos dedicated himself to the study of the oceans, installing in the Citadel the first Portuguese marine biology laboratory. Following the 5 October 1910 revolution and the end of the monarchy the palace was assigned to the Presidency of the Republic and used as a residence by several presidents.  The Museum  Development of the Palace into a museum was first discussed in 2004 and was completed in 2011 at a cost of €4.2 million. There is a permanent exhibition as well as rooms on the ground floor available for temporary exhibitions.

This film was also released in Marathi-language following popular demand. Tracing the life of Maratha warrior Tanaji Malusare, it stars Ajay Devgn in the titular role along with Saif Ali Khan and Kajol in the lead roles. It also features Sharad Kelkar and Luke Kenny in the pivotal roles. Set in the 17th century, it revolves around Tanaji's attempts to recapture the Kondhana fortress once it passes on to Mughal emperor Aurangzeb who transfers its control to his trusted guard Udaybhan Singh Rathore. Principal photography commenced on 25 September 2018, and the film was released in India in 3D and conventional theatres on 10 January 2020. Tanhaji grossed worldwide. Plot In 1647, Tanhaji's father, Kaloji Malusare trains him in sword-fighting, later succumbing to a Mughal plunder in Umrat. 17 years later in 1664, a now-adult Tanhaji with his younger brother Suryaji, commands Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's Maratha Army to attack an intruding Mughal cavalry. In 1665, the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb dispatches Jai Singh to contain Shivaji fearing his rapid imperial expansion in Deccan, thus annexing his 33 forts. Later, the Mughal general Beshak Khan orders a quick vacation of the strategic fortress Kondhana, insulting Jijabai, who swears to remain barefoot until the Marathas recapture the fort. Tanhaji is informed about the treaty as well. Five years later, Shivaji's spy informs him about Aurangzeb's plan to assign the Kondhana fort to his Rajput general Udaybhan Rathod and to use it as a base for Aurangzeb's southern imperial expansion. Shivaji plans to recapture Kondhana, considering himself to lead the campaign as Tanhaji, though an able general, can't be employed due to his son Rayba's upcoming wedding. Meanwhile, Tanhaji celebrates Holi with his family. Marathas begin their war preparations and Shivaji warns his generals to keep Tanhaji from knowing about the campaign. Tanhaji arrives at Rajgad for inviting Shivaji to Rayba's wedding. Chandraji Pisal, a Maratha general, reveals Tanhaji about the secret plan at his nephew Chultya's recommendation. Tanhaji convinces Shivaji and Jijabai to permit him to lead the campaign and postpones Rayba's wedding. Elsewhere, Udaybhan reaches Burhanpur while the Marathas discuss his route possibilities. Tanhaji coins an attack plan but Pisal sends Chultya to warn Udaybhan about this. Udaybhan is also bringing an imprisoned Kamla Devi en route, the sister of his Rajput general Jagat Singh. Chultya informs Udaybhan about Tanhaji's attack plan and he tricks Tanhaji into attacking Maratha soldiers disguised under Mughal attire. Elsewhere, Udaybhan reaches Kondhana and aims a huge cannon at Rajgad, threatening Shivaji's safety. Dejected, Tanhaji reaches Kondhana alone to learn about a secret thief-entrance inside. Udaybhan kills a guard for disobeying the security protocol. Tanhaji recovers his dead remains and motivates the villagers to betray/fight Udaybhan. He is recommended to participate in a Shivratri event on Kondhana where he kills Chultya for betrayal. Tanhaji is imprisoned and tortured by Udaybhan. Jagat Singh secretly releases Tanhaji, revealing Udaybhan's plan to marry his sister. Tanhaji promises to release them from Udaybhan's clutches. Tanhaji escapes from the thief-entrance and returns to Umrat. Udaybhan hangs the guards responsible for Tanhaji's escape and Jagat Singh agrees to marry his sister to Udaybhan on Ashtami's eve, thus convincing her to fake the marriage preparation until Tanhaji arrives. Tanhaji now plans to directly attack Kondhana during Ashtami night on February 4, 1670. He scales the fort through various entrances and attacks the Mughal army. The confusion allows Jagat and Kamla Devi to escape. Udaybhan is alerted and Tanhaji dies in the ensuing battle, although he captures Kondhana before killing Udaybhan. Shivaji arrives at Kondhana to praise a visibly dying Tanhaji for his heroic act. He declares in Marathi, \\"Gad aala pan sinha gela\\" (We won the fort, but my lion is dead.) He personally oversees Rayba's marriage while Aurangzeb's dream of winning southern India remains unfilled. The film ends with Savitribai fulfilling her promise of grandly welcoming Tanhaji from his return. Cast  Production  Pre-production began on 20 July 2017. Principal photography commenced from 25 September 2018.  Marketing and release  Earlier marketed as Taanaji: The Unsung Warrior, it was revealed on Twitter by Ajay Devgn that the film will be known as Tanhaji. In December 2017, the release date of Tanhaji was revealed as 22 November 2019 but was postponed to December 2019 due to shooting problems. Amar Chitra Katha released the film edition comic book in 2019. The film was theatrically released in 3D and conventional cinemas on 10 January 2020. The Akhil Bhartiya Kshatriya Koli Rajput Sangh has filed a petition in Delhi High Court, claiming that Om Raut, the director of Tanhaji has concealed the true lineage of the great warrior Tanaji Malusare in the movie. Critical reception On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Tanhaji has an approval rating of 73% with an average score of 6/10, based on eleven reviews. Anupama Chopra of Film Companion noted it to be an un-nuanced retelling of history right out of Amar Chitra Katha comics, that blended historical spectacles, nationalism, and hyper-masculinity. The storytelling, soundtracks, costumes, and individual performances were specifically praised. Rahul Desai noted it to be a slick work which was but marred by an extensive saffronisation which sought to exploit the political climate in India. A review over The Hindustan Times noted it to be a magnificent work, which had exceptional individual performances, a captivating story-line and excellent video-effects. Namrata Joshi of The Hindu noted of the film to have started off well, before floundering in the middle but regaining brilliance at the end, delivering a catharsis and adrenaline rush. Uday Bhatia of The Mint noted it to be a silly cartoon history, which borrowed its physics from Prince of Persia but nonetheless consisted of fluent actions and interesting individual performances. . Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV noted it to be a historically inauthentic work that ironed out any and all nuances in its portrayal of a saffronized Hindu-Muslim binary; however, he noted the overall production to be crisp and backed by powerful individual performances. Tanul Thakur of The Wire noted it to be a work that had excellent cinematography but was intensely buoyed down by its ahistorical religio-nationalist propaganda, catering to the overall saffronisation of India. Shubhra Gupta over Indian Express noted it to offer a \\"simplistic, dressed-up slice of the past\\" that painted hyperbolic tales of Maratha bravery with a Hindu fervor. Sukanya Verma of Rediff noted it to be a mythical retelling of history with a bout of saffron fervor; individual performances and choreography of combat sequences were praised. Rajeev Masand noted it to be a dubiously stereotyped fictional work, which appealed to the hyper-nationalistic climate but had robust filmography, visceral battle scenes, and superb individual performances. Stutee Ghosh of The Quint noted it to be a visually stunning film with strong individual performances, despite its broad liberties with historical accuracy and problematic prejudices.  Soundtrack  The film's music was composed by Ajay-Atul, Sachet-Parampara and Mehul Vyas with lyrics written by Swanand Kirkire and Anil Verma. Box office Tanhaji earned 15.10 crore at the domestic box office on its opening day. On the second day, the film collected ₹20.57 crore. On the third day, the film collected ₹26.26 crore, taking total opening weekend collection to ₹61.93 crore. , with a gross of 332.80 crore in India and 34.85 crore overseas, the film has a worldwide gross collection of 367.65 crore and became the highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2020.

Isberg has served extensively abroad, in Cyprus, Lebanon, Yugoslavia, Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Afghanistan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. His senior commands include commanding officer of the Norrbotten Engineer Corps and the Haparanda Border Regiment, deputy force commander of MONUC and brigade commander of the Ituri Brigade and the Kivu Brigade. Early life Isberg was born on 7 April 1947 in Enskede Parish, Stockholm. Isberg graduated from Military Academy Karlberg (the same officer course as Ulf Henricsson.) in 1969 and was commissioned as an officer the same year in Svea Engineer Regiment with the rank of lieutenant. Career =Early military career= From 1969 to 1975, Isberg served as platoon leader and company commander. He attended the Engineering Officers School at the Artillery and Engineering Officers School from 1971 to 1972 and the Swedish Armed Forces Staff College from 1975 to 1978 and served in the Army Staff from 1978 to 1983, whereupon Isberg served as company commander 1984 to 1985. His first mission abroad was with the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) in Cyprus in 1984. Isberg was head of the Army Field Work Department in the Operation Section 4 in the Joint Operations (Operationsledningen, OPL) in the Defence Staff from 1985 to 1988 and he was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1986 He served as battalion commander from 1988 to 1990, after which he was commander of the Swedish Lebanon Battalions L106/L21 from 1990 to 1991 and commanding officer of the Swedish Army Field Work School (Fältarbetsskolan, FarbS) from 1991 to 1993 and at the same time head of the Swedish UN Stand-by Force in 1992. =1990s to early 2000s= In January 1992 during the Yugoslav Wars, during the planning stage of the Swedish contribution to the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), there was thought that the Swedish unit JK01 could largely amount to a battalion, possibly in cooperation with other nationalities. Battalion commander would be the then colonel Isberg, but politicians and other senior decision makers wanted otherwise. The force finally came to include a purely Swedish company instead, now led by major Jan Söderberg. In January 1993, Isberg was appointed to command Nordbat 1 (Nordic Battalion 1) with the United Nations Protection Forces/Macedonia (UNPROFOR/M), a joint Nordic unit consisting of a mechanized infantry company from Sweden, Norway and Finland, as well as a joint staff and train company from these countries. In mid-1993, American troops were sent to Macedonia and were put under Isberg's command. This was the first a Swedish officer commanded American soldiers. In 1993, Isberg was also appointed commanding officer of the Norrbotten Engineer Corps (Ing 3) and the Haparanda Border Regiment (Haparanda gränsregemente) (that consisted of the 2nd brigade of the Norrbotten Regiment) which comprised more than 6,000 men. In the 1990s, he also served as adviser in Bulgaria. In 1996, Isberg served in the Bosnia Army Corps Staff of the Implementation Force (IFOR). Isberg served at the Swedish Armed Forces Headquarters in Stockholm from 1997 to 1999: as head of the Program Department (1997–1998), as head of the Ground Warfare Department in the Joint Forces Directorate (Krigsförbandsledningen) (1998–1999). Isberg served as Senior Military Adviser at the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan (UNSMA) from 1999 to 2000 and from 2001 to 2003 he served as head of the Baltic Cooperation Department at the Swedish Armed Forces Headquarters. =Congo= In 2003, the UN decided to seriously deal with the war in the Congo. It had been going on for six years and the situation in northeastern Congo in 2003 was described as a slow- going genocide. Although a peace agreement had been signed in 2002, it was broken by militia groups in the eastern part of the country. Isberg arrived in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in late July 2003 to take up his post as deputy force commander of the UN peacekeeping mission in the DRC, known as MONUC. On 21 August 2003, Isberg was appointed acting commander of the Ituri Brigade - the UN force that took over on 1 September from the French-led Interim Emergency Multinational Force (IEMF) that had completed its mandate of securing the eastern town in Bunia in the embattled Ituri District. Overall, Isberg commanded 5,000 men in the Ituri District. The Ituri Brigade included personnel from Morocco, Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan; an Indian aviation unit; and a Bangladeshi and Indonesian engineering unit. In October 2003, Isberg, superseded as brigade commander by a Pakistani brigadier general, returned to his regular position at the MONUC headquarters in Kinshasa, a time as Acting Force Commander; the regular, Mountaga Diallo, was replaced in December by major general Somaila Ilyia from Nigeria, a superior with whom Isberg had easy cooperation. Isberg was later appointed commander of the Kivu Brigade from March 2004. He was the only western soldier in his brigade, which was composed of a Uruguayan and a Bangladeshi battalion, totalling 4,000 men. During this time, Isberg was repeatedly sent to Ituri to lead the Ituri Brigade, and periodically he commanded both brigades, a total of 9,000 professional soldiers. In March 2004, Isberg suspended the work of raising the Kivu Brigade temporarily. Due to new unrest, he was sent back to Bunia to confront the UPC militias. In mid- March, he led from helicopters and from the ground four major operations aimed at cracking down on the UPC militia's core areas. There, among other things, the UPC brigade staff and other support points were destroyed. Later during the most extensive operation, they entered a large area of three militia camps. The main force was equipped with twenty armored vehicles. One company was landed by helicopter in the back of the militia. The militia quickly opened fire, and in the coming hours, battles were fought over a large area. Eventually, the militia took refuge. The attack helicopters were used to fight militias camps. After the cleaning operations, about twenty-one militiamen were arrested. Isberg would command the Kivu Brigade during 11 month, March 2004 to February 2005. Isberg has described his service in the Congo in his book By all necessary means: Brigadier General Jan-Gunnar Isberg's experiences from service in the Congo 2003-2005 (2012). =Later career= Isberg served as project manager for the Swedish Armed Forces international leadership exercises (Project Viking) from 2005 to 2010. In 2007, Isberg served as exercise director of Illuminated Summer 07, a multinational exercise with participants from Sweden, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Norway and the United Kingdom. In 2008 he was responsible for the VIKING 08 exercise. At the end of the 2000s, internal and external criticism had been made of the fact that the Swedish Armed Forces did not manage to take care of and implement experience, especially in the context of more complex missions. Furthermore, an experience management process had already been proposed in the mid-2000s for the then Joint Forces Command (OPIL), but this was considered not to have been fully implemented. As a direct result of this, an internal investigation, under the direction of brigadier general Isberg, was added to analyze and propose measures to accelerate the development and implementation rate of systematic experience management. In 2010, Isberg led a commission of inquiry into the killings of two Swedish officers in Afghanistan. Later life Isberg was the chairman of the Fortifikationsklubben (\\"Fortification Club\\"), an association of fortification officers, engineer officers and officers of the Road and Waterway Construction Service Corps.

It became the first FM radio station in Dumaguete City to use Digital Audio Tape (DAT) and compact discs (CDs) for song playback and cart machines for playing national and local commercials, jingles and station promotional materials, all of which were acquired from the United States through JAM Creative Productions. The said format has proven popular to its listeners, as it quickly became the overall #1 FM radio station in Dumaguete City and the entire province of Negros Oriental. In the same year, DYEM's owner, Negros Broadcasting and Publishing Inc., filed a case against GLBSI because the station was broadcasting nearer to that station's frequency, which is at 96.7 MHz. GLBSI later responded to DYEM's case by moving DYGB to its current frequency, 91.7 MHz, with the branding being changed to Power 91 FM. In mid-1994, DYGB-FM was relaunched as a \\"news and music\\" FM station, shifted to the masa format with news, public affairs, commentary, public service and brokered programming to its schedule. Since the reformat, it remains the city's most listened-to FM radio station, a distinction that still holds up to this day.

This was without counting on a strong, powerful and generous personality with an uncommon friendliness. A former soloist with the Orchestre National de Lyon, which he reluctantly left to face the many requests to which he was subjected, his generosity led him to lend his talent to many ensembles where his brilliance was matched only by his virtuosity. Passion and generosity served as the driving force behind his pedagogical and instrumental career. The Hexagon brass ensembleEnsemble Hexagone is the most brilliant example of this. Talent, passion and originality recognized on many international stages, a renowned pedagogical experience, an original and unpublished repertoire, all this makes this formation a unique permanent ensemble in France and Europe that regularly represents the French brass school throughout the world. The ministry assigned him a trumpet teacher training centre. He is regularly invited as a jury to French conservatories and national and international competitions. Dutot, who was a 22-year-old teacher at the Conservatoire de Lyon, is one of the most sought-after teachers of the French Brass School, as his students trust his success in national and international competitions. Among them, Pascal Clarhaut, David Guerrier (first prize at the ARD International Music Competition in 2003, André HenryAndré Henry (first prize at the Geneva International Music Competition in 1996), etc.).

Christ's followers were thus called Galileans. Galilee was part of the province of Judea. The reason for this term was to marginalize Christianity and to indicate that it came from a small area, a religion of only local significance. In the same manner, Jesus was called \\"of Nazareth\\" or \\"the Nazarene\\" in this context (another emphasis on geographical origin and the indication of local significance) instead of \\"Christ\\" (derived from the Greek word \\"anointed\\"). These terms were used as part of the ideological struggle against the new religion, which was perceived as a threat. Over time, the originally factual designation absorbed a pejorative meaning, which, despite its expansion throughout the Roman Empire, still referred to it as a local religion. The terms appeared in several texts that in ways contradicted the different aspects of the new religion and showed either theological errors, contradictions, or an overall misconception of the faith. The use of these terms in late antiquity was generally meant to weaken the religion, gaining an advantage just by the naming, before making any arguments.

The character is based on the DC Comics character of the same name, created by Robert Kanigher and Carmine Infantino and was adapted for television in 2013 by Greg Berlanti, Andrew Kreisberg and Geoff Johns. Barry Allen has been continually portrayed by Grant Gustin, with Logan Williams and Liam Hughes portraying younger versions. In the series, Barry is portrayed as a smart, goofy and tardy character, who works at the Central City Police Department as a crime scene investigator. When he was younger he witnessed the murder of his mother by The Reverse Flash, which resulted in the false imprisonment of his father for the crime. Later in life, while working at the Central City Police Department he is struck by lightning created by the explosion of the S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator sending him to a nine- month coma. After waking up he finds himself in S.T.A.R. Labs and develops metahuman powers; the power of speed and he became friends with Cisco Ramon and Caitlin Snow. Throughout the series, he is constantly training himself to control and enhance his powers, and uses his powers, along with his team's help, to fight criminals and other metahumans who have misused their powers. He is a friend and frequent ally of Star City-based vigilante archer Green Arrow and Kryptonian superheroine Supergirl from the parallel universe of Earth-38. Gustin has appeared as Barry Allen and his superhero persona in crossovers on the television series Arrow, Legends of Tomorrow, Supergirl, and the animated web series Vixen, all set within the Arrowverse. The character has also appeared in a digital comic book series. Gustin has won an IGN award for his performance. Storylines =Arrow= Barry Allen travels to Star City to investigate a superhuman-related crime in hopes that it is related to his mother's murder and to meet his vigilante idol, The Arrow (Oliver Queen). He helps Oliver and his team to begin uncover the Mirakuru plot orchestrated by Slade Wilson. After returning to Central City, he gets struck by lightning which puts him in a nine-months coma and becomes The Flash. In season three, Barry, as The Flash, and his own team helps Team Arrow against a rogue former ASIS agent Digger Harkness (nicknamed by Cisco as \\"Captain Boomerang\\"), who wields lethal boomerangs. He later assists Team Arrow of their escape from their captivity at Nanda Parbat. In season seven, Allen is interviewed for the Emerald Archer documentary seen in the episode of the same name due to his friendship with Oliver Queen and his family is publicly known, but denies knowing that Queen is the Green Arrow. =The Flash= Season 1 Barry Allen's first appearance on The Flash is in the episode \\"Pilot\\". Barry is introduced as quite a goofy and kind character, who is quite brilliant at his job as a crime scene investigator for the Central City Police department. His obsession for the particle accelerator and interest in Harrison Wells began before his superhuman abilities. After the explosion that consequently led to Barry being struck by lightning, he wakes up and discovers that he has developed meta-human abilities, in particular the power of speed. This season portrays Barry's development in his superpowers, he has his setbacks in the beginning, in \\"Fastest Man Alive\\" he begins fainting, which he only finds out later that it is because his body is burning more energy than he could intake. Throughout the episode, Barry's character develops and he is able to better control his powers through training at the S.T.A.R Labs, with his team the STAR team: Caitlin Snow, Cisco Ramon and Harrison Wells. Barry's once platonic (at least to Iris West) relationship with Iris is turned complicated after all the episode \\"The Man in the Yellow Suit\\" when Barry confesses his love to her. In the episode \\"Crazy for You\\" however, Barry begins a relationship with Linda Park, who in the next episode suspects that Barry is still in love with Iris West. Over the course of the second half of the season, Barry begins to suspect and learns that Wells is actually the man in the yellow suit that killed his mother, otherwise known by his true name Eobard Thawne, whom had been manipulating events since that night to turn Barry into The Flash in an effort to harness his speed and return to the future. Eobard ultimately fails and is erased from existence by his distant ancestor, Eddie Thawne when Eddie kills himself. This provides an effort to allow Barry to travel to the past and save his mother. However, doing so results in a singularity opening above Central City which Barry then has to stop. Season 2 Season two introduces a new villain, Hunter Zolomon who is from Earth-2 and is the enemy of the Earth-2 Flash, Jay Garrick. Jay becomes an important mentor for Barry, but in fact, he is Hunter Zolomon / Zoom an evil killer who had misused a drug that made him terminal, which meant his only chance of survival and to regain his speed was to befriend Barry and steal his speed. Both sides of Hunter Zolomon had a great impact on Barry's character, Garrick, an older and experienced mentor and Zoom, the villain who made him choose between his speed and Wally West’s life. This was a true test of character for Barry and depicted that his powers have not changed the kind-hearted person he was. This season featured both different and familiar chemistries, Barry begins first dating Patty Spivot but then after her departure, Barry returned to old flames. Iris reciprocates the feelings Barry has for her. Barry also briefly accidentally travels to Earth-38 and meets its hero Kara Zor-El/Supergirl with whom he assists against her own villains and befriends. After his father Henry's death by Zoom's hand and following Zoom's subsequent defeat by Barry when attempting to destroy every earth in the multiverse excluding Earth-1 with a magna-tar, Barry decides to alter history out of grief and consequently changing the storyline of Iris's love for him as well as well as all his friends lives. Season 3 The third season begins with a new reality identified as Flashpoint, in this reality, Barry's mother was not murdered as Barry had run back in time to save her. In this season Barry's character is faced with a vital moral dilemma, he has to choose either to save his friends who are not doing so well in this reality or to keep living in this timeline where his parents are alive. He chooses to ask Eobard Thawne to go back and murder his mother again in the hopes of restoring his original timeline. A new reality is created again due to Barry's changes in history and the timeline, this resulted in the death of Cisco's brother, seemingly Caitlin gaining frost powers (though it is later revealed a year later this wasn't a result of Flashpoint), Team Arrow's John Diggle/Spartan having a son instead of a daughter, and Barry's former rival at the CCPD turned disgraced private investigator Ralph Dibny not dying during the Particle Accelerator explosion. The team at first distrust Barry for these changes but forgives him after they have to team up to fight Savitar, whom is revealed to be a broken and evil time remnant of Barry from the future that was released from a speed force prison Barry created with Flashpoint by Flashpoint and became destined to kill Iris in front of Barry which in turn would lead Barry to create time remnants to fight Savitar and inadvertently create him. During a final battle after having his plan foiled by the sacrifice of Earth-19's H.R. Wells, Savitar attempts to splice himself throughout history to ensure his survival though that plan is foiled as well and after being beaten in combat with Jay Garrick, Team Flash and Gypsy and having his armor destroyed by Barry, he is shot and killed by Iris. The season ends with Barry sacrificing himself and places himself in the speed force prison to stop a speed force storm from destroying Central City as it becomes unstable without a prisoner. Season 4 Team Flash rescues Barry out of the speed force prison and Barry is given a new suit. Barry and Iris attend couples therapy in attempts to mend their relationship. Barry along with Oliver, Kara, the Legends, and each of their respective teams repel a Nazi Invasion from Earth-X led by Thawne (who had returned from the dead due to being a living time paradox), and both Oliver and Kara's evil doppelgänger's after they attack during Barry and Iris wedding though the Invasion results in the death of Legends team member and Barry's old friend Martin Stein/Firestorm. Following the invasion, both couples Barry and Iris along with Oliver and Felicity are married together side-by-side by Diggle. Barry and Caitlin, now going by the codename “Killer Frost”, are kidnapped by two different people and the team has to choose whom to save, Barry ultimately escapes and the team are seen celebrating at the West House. Barry, however, is then framed and arrested for the murder of Clifford DeVoe/The Thinker, he is then deemed guilty by the jury and sentenced to life in prison. Barry and Iris are back together but Barry is still in Jail. Barry is released from prison after his new teammate and friend as well as meta- human Ralph Dibny/Elongated Man shapeshifts into DeVoe and appeals Barry's case. Over the course of the season, Barry and Team Flash consistently falter trying to prevent DeVoe from killing off 12 “Bus Metas” whom were created when Barry was released from the speed force and nearly lose Ralph as well but eventually finally defeat DeVoe by entering his mind and bringing Ralph's (of whom's body DeVoe's consciousness was currently inhabiting) consciousness out. Before DeVoe's death he activates a kill-switch which causes the massive S.T.A.R. labs satellite he was using to try and reset everyone in the world's brains to plummet to the earth to cause an extinction-level event though it is destroyed by both Barry and a mystery speedster together. The season ends when Barry and Iris discover that the mystery speedster who appeared throughout the series is, in fact, their daughter from the future. Season 5 Team Flash is introduced to Barry and Iris's daughter, Nora West-Allen. Barry learns from Nora that in the future he did not return after a Universal Crisis in 2024 and she had only known Iris. Barry is introduced to a new villain, Cicada, who is a meta human serial killer. However, in an attempt to defeat Cicada in “What's Past Is Prologue”, Barry and Nora travel back to time and Nora learns that Eobard Thawne killed her grandmother. It is also revealed at the end of the episode that Nora works with Thawne and he sent her back to time to meet her father. Barry and Oliver wake up one day to find they've swapped lives with Oliver as The Flash and Barry as the Green Arrow. They recruit Kara to assist in figuring out the reality change and after defeating a super android known as A.M.A.Z.O. with the help of Kara's cousin Clark Kent/Superman, they realize with the help of Cisco's vibe powers that reality is being manipulated by an insane doctor at Arkham Asylum in Gotham City named Dr. John Deegan and a strange godlike individual known as Mar-Novu/The Monitor. After confronting Deegan at Arkham and stopping a prison break with the help of new ally Kate Kane/Batwoman and acquiring additional information from Barry Allen/The Flash of the recently decimated Earth-90, Deegan changes reality again making himself an evil Superman but a combined effort from Barry, Oliver, and Kara defeats him and resets reality back to normal, though Barry and Oliver are warned of a coming crisis by Novu and his decimation of Earths in the multiverse like Earth-90 was to prepare everyone and see who is worthy to fight the crisis. Later on, Barry and Iris eventually learn their future daughter's alignment with the Reverse-Flash through one of Harrison Wells' parallel universe doppelgängers Harrison \\"Sherloque\\" Wells' discovery; they feel betrayed by Nora and Barry bitterly imprisoned his daughter in the pipeline before sending her home now knowing that he cannot trust her. He is also glad to see that Thawne is serving capital punishment for his crimes in the future. After giving Dwyer a meta-human cure Cisco and Caitlin formulated on his own free will, a future version of his niece, Grace Gibbons, who is now using the Cicada mantle and is much more powerful than Dwyer and more psychotic arrives and begins giving Team Flash new problems (including murdering Dwyer when he tries to convince her off her path as well as the doctor overlooking her present-day self in her coma). This distracts them from Reverse-Flash and his secret escape plan, however, who is being held in Iron Heights prison and is on death row for his crimes. Cicada's dagger in the future is the item that is keeping him in prison, and if that is removed in the past he can escape freely. Cicada's dagger has a power-dampening ability. He convinces Nora during all those times she came to see him to try to get rid of the dagger so he can escape. Eventually Nora wakes up past Grace and gives her the cure on her own free will though it doesn't fix anything and in a desperate effort to save Nora from Cicada II knowing the inevitable outcome of his actions, Barry destroys the dagger and erases future Grace from existence and in turn releases Eobard from his imprisonment and execution in the future to which Barry and Nora quickly head there to confront him. After an extended fight between Eobard and Team Flash to which he's defeated by the combined effort of each member, he escapes after Nora begins to fade from existence due to the massive timeline change Barry caused by destroying the dagger. Barry tries to save Nora but she refuses due to being connected with the negative speed force under Thawne's proper manipulation and not wanting to become like him after seeing the effects it has on her rage, forcing Barry and Iris to allow Nora to erase from existence in their arms and leave them devastated. The two later view a message left behind for them from Nora in the event of her death stating she wouldn't change a thing about her journey and for them not to grieve for her. Unaware to everyone, the timeline shift causes the 2024 Crisis that Mar Novu (Monitor) previously mentioned and had been seen in a newspaper article from the future in the time vault since the pilot to change drastically, resulting in the date of it to be moved up to December 2019. Season 6 Moments after Nora's erasure from the timeline, her father's message from the future is also erased. The Monitor informs Barry and Iris that the Flash must die in the coming crisis. As Barry prepares for the team with a world without him, he attempts to travel into the future to see the Crisis after his apparent death, but an anti-matter barrier prevents him from doing so. This prompts him to seek help from Jay and his wife Joan Williams, a doppelganger of Barry's mother. To bypass the barrier, Jay uses a machine he built to use on Barry, who sees billions of possible future, one where he sees himself vanish. After, Barry is left weakened. Meanwhile, scientist and metahuman Ramsey Rosso discover his abilities allow him to bring back the dead to alive although instead of coming back as a human, they come back as zombies. When Ralph follows up on a lead to a person of interest – Sue Dearbon in Midway City, Barry asks to tag along with him as one of the preparations for a post-Crisis world without him. There, the two go undercover at a criminal gala where Barry learns that the host, Remington Meister, has allied himself with metahuman assassin Esperanza Garcia, aka Ultraviolet. After defeating Meister, Esperanza escapes and Barry and Ralph return to Central City where that night, Russo attacks and infects Ralph with his blood. After a brief battle, Cisco and Caitlin rescue Ralph and bring him back to S.T.A.R. Labs where Barry gives him a blood transfusion to save him. However, a trace of Russo's blood enters Barry's. The Speed Force, in form of Barry's mother Nora, inform Barry that he is infected by Russo's blood which allows Russo to gain access to Barry's mind. Eventually, Cisco and Caitlin revive Barry, although Russo's blood manages to successfully take over Barry's consciousness as well as taking over the city using his blood. Team Flash lure Barry back to the lab where they use a combination of the particle accelerator and Allegra Garcia's metahuman abilities to bring back Barry. The team then subvert Russo's plan. With his plan foiled, Barry uses a hologram of Russo's mother to make him surrender and is imprisoned at A.R.G.U.S. Minutes before the Crisis begins, the team spends their last moment as red skies loom over Central City. During the Crisis, Barry is recruited by Lyla Michaels, now a \\"Harbinger of things to come\\", to Earth-38 among other heroes, to evacuate the world. After Earth-38 is erased by a wave of anti-matter, he is detected as a Paragon, one of the prophesied warriors that will save the multiverse from the Anti- Monitor. Barry's fate during the Crisis is altered by the intervention of the Flash from Earth-90 (who is another doppelganger of Barry's father), who sacrifices himself in Barry's place. The Anti-Monitor ultimately erases the rest of the multiverse and proceeds with his scheme to replace it with his antimatter universe. Just before the heroes on the Waverider are erased, Pariah sends the seven Paragons to the Vanishing Point. There, the Paragons fail to find a way out until Oliver, now known as the Spectre, unlocks Barry's full potential to help the Paragons escape. Later, the Paragons travel to the dawn of time where they have their battle against the Anti-Monitor who is defeated when Oliver sacrifices himself. Following Oliver's sacrifice, a new world dubbed \\"Earth-Prime\\" is created and Barry leads a new group of heroes in memory of Oliver. Character development =Costume= Barry's suit is altered and upgraded every season. The suit is designed by Cisco Ramon and its original design was intended as a uniform for firefighters. The suit was a modernised version of the traditional flash suit with a matching dark maroon colored helmet, which features the same maroon emblem and gold lightning symbol as the suit does. The second season suit made minor changes to the suit, the alteration being the background color of the emblem is now white with a gold lightning symbol which is more true to the comics. Besides the alteration of the emblem in season 2, there appears to only minor changes made throughout the three seasons. The suit in season 4 appears to be a brighter red, with added leather paddings and golden accents. The fifth season made one of the most significant changes, that is the removal of the chin strap and switching the fabric softer more body fitting look, created by Ryan Choi, in the future. The sixth season suit is fairly similar to the season 5 suit though now with gold piping along the torso and an entirely new cowl which features the return of the chinstrap. =Relationships= Iris West Barry and Iris's relationship has often been compared to Superman and Lois Lane, she is introduced as his one true love. Barry and Iris were close friends since they were 10 years old, this friendship escalates after Barry's mother is murdered and Barry is taken in by Joe West (Iris's father). It is revealed in the first season that Barry is in love with Iris while Iris still sees him as more of a brother. It is later shown that a newspaper article is written by Iris West-Allen in 2024, thus indicating their future romance and marriage. Iris and Barry's relationship changes due to alterations of the timeline when Barry time travels, however, their love seems to always prevail and they are eventually married, Barry says in his wedding vows \\"That's you. You’ve always been there, as a friend, as a partner, as the love of my life. You’re my home, Iris, and that's one thing that will never change.\\". The end of season four reveals that, in one timeline, Iris and Barry have a daughter named Nora in the future. Linda Park Barry dates Linda Park briefly in the first season, who is both friends and colleagues at the Central City Picture News with Iris West. Their relationship slowly dies out as she suspects him to still be in love with Iris, they eventually break up and decide that they are better of as friends. Patty Spivot Barry and Patty Spivot begin dating in the second season, she was much like Barry with her quirky personality and sad past, that has caused them to dedicate their lives and careers to avenging and seeking the truth about their parents. Patty made the decision to end the relationship because Barry was pushing her away emotionally, and she needed to attend Midway City University and study to become a CSI agent, which meant she had to leave Central City and consequently him. Before leaving she had one final case with Barry, in which she tells Barry \\"I know you’re upset but I was hoping it wouldn't be like this between us\\". Other versions =Versions from other Earths= * Barry Allen of Earth-2 (also played by Gustin) is a non-metahuman who is a CSI at the Central City Police Department and a PhD graduate, married to Iris but despised by Joe. * Blitzkrieg of Earth-X, seen in Freedom Fighters: The Ray was originally confirmed by Marc Guggenheim in an interview to be that Earth's Barry Allen. However, many of the concepts for Earth-X have changed since the interview and the animated series' production started and as such, it is unclear whether this information is still accurate. He is voiced by Scott Whyte and is an amalgamation of Baron Blitzkrieg, Baroness Blitzkrieg, Blitzen and Nazi Flash. * Barry Allen of Earth-90 is played by John Wesley Shipp. * Ezra Miller’s Barry Allen from an unknown Earth met Earth-1 Barry in the Speed Force during \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\". =Savitar= Gustin also portrays Savitar (voiced by Tobin Bell in his exosuit which is performed by stuntman Andre Tricoteux), an evil and scarred future version of his character who is season three's main antagonist. Savitar is essentially Barry with no loved ones and embracing his dark side. Savitar's origins are a predestination paradox; he is a temporal duplicate of the Flash's future self using time travel in order to defeat Savitar. Although Savitar is ultimately defeated, the time remnant is spared but shunned by the rest of his friends and family for being an aberration. As a result, he goes back in time to set in motion the events that led to his own creation, including the death of Iris. Savitar's presence is \\"chronologically\\" the multiverse's first metahuman with speed. Naming himself after the Hindu god of motion, he is worshipped by his own cult. Long-held myths referenced Savitar throughout the multiverse with even Jay believing these stories, and with Savitar regarded as a worst nemesis than the Reverse- Flash, Zoom and the Thinker. From his prison, Savitar manipulates Julian Albert into acquiring the Philosopher's Stone, through which Doctor Alchemy can re-empower metahumans from the Flashpoint timeline. After manipulating Kid Flash into freeing him from his prison, Savitar next convinces Killer Frost to be his personal enforcer. When Savitar reveals his true identity to Barry, it forces his younger self to confront his own dark impulses and temptations that plagued him. Savitar's plan of Iris' murder before Barry (which would lead to his own creation), however, is ruined with the sacrifice of H.R. Wells (Earth-19) by impersonating Iris. To save himself, Savitar manipulates Vibe to fragment himself throughout all of time and then goad his original self to give into dark impulses as Savitar himself. However, both efforts are foiled by Team Flash and Savitar is erased from existence after being shot by Iris. In season five, Savitar has a cameo appearance when Barry and Nora time travel to season three and observe his final battle. Reception Regarding Gustin's debut as Barry Allen in Arrow and the potential for a series, IGN's Jesse Schedeen stated his concern: \\"Gustin doesn't come across as leading man material. His awkward bumbling intertwining with Felicity's was cute, but rarely did I get the impression that this character could or should be given his own spinoff series.\\" Schedeen eventually warmed up to the character, however, once the \\"dorkiness and social awkwardness\\" were downplayed a bit and the emphasis was placed on \\"his keen scientific mind\\". Grant Gustin as Barry Allen has received positive reviews by both fans and critics, with The Flash being the most watched show in The CW history. Since the premiere of The Flash, Gustin has been nominated for 20 awards for his role as Barry Allen and had won a total of 5 of them. In 2015, Gustin won the Teen Choice Award for \\"Breakout Star\\", in that same year he won the Saturn Award for \\"Breakthrough Performance\\" and was nominated for \\"Best Actor on Television\\". In the following year Gustin won the Teen Choice Awards for \\"Choice TV Actor: Sci- fi/Fantasy\\" and in 2017 and 2018 he took home the Teen Choice Awards for \\"Choice TV Actor: Action\\". Gustin's Barry Allen has been said to be the better Flash, compared to Ezra Miller who starred in the Warner Bros. Justice League. According to Nick Mangione from Geek.com, \\"By the time Ezra Miller made his brief cameo appearance in Batman v. Superman, we had already seen the perfect Barry Allen\\", he goes on to say \\"More than heart, more than a perfect embodiment of the character from the comics, Grant Gustin is the one true Barry Allen because his show allows him to be. At least at this point, the same can't be said for Miller and the DCEU.\\" While the first season received a large number of positive reviews, the latter seasons received more mixed reviews. Erik Kain a senior contributor on Forbes indicated that \\"The first season of 'The Flash' on the CW remains one of my very favourite seasons of a superhero show. I maintain that it's among the best ever made, with great characters and one of the most intriguing villains on TV.\\". Kain, however, also states that the show has gone downhill and that \\"Miller's Barry Allen is better in almost every way than Gustin's, though that's largely because he's not weighed down by CW melodrama.\\".

He also participated in the French and Indian War, including the Expulsion of the Acadians. He was the first Registrar of Deeds (1767) and the first Justice of the Peace in Yarmouth County.Place-names and places of Nova Scotia. Public Archives of Nova Scotia, 1967 In 1749 Cook commanded the ship Baltimore and transported 255 settlers as part of Edward Cornwallis' expedition to settle Halifax. He fell out of favour with Cornwallis and went to jail for insulting a judge. Five years later, during the French and Indian War, Cook established the settlement of Mahone Bay under the protection of Captain Thomas Lewis (mariner) and his rangers (1754).. He built the first ship in Mahone Bay, the snow Edward (1754). In 1755, Cook was captain of the snow Edward, and departed with 278 Acadians from Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia on 8 December 1755. The ship were blown off course by violent storms and arrived in New London, Connecticut on May 22, 1756. 98 Acadians (35%) died en route because of disease. After the Raid on Lunenburg (1756), he built a block house to protect Mahone Bay (in the present-day community of Blockhouse). He lost his leg while building the blockhouse and returned to Massachusetts. Another account of the story of his leg suggests he lost it while serving in Capt. Gamaliel Bradford’s company of Colonel Doty’s Regiment in New York. While building Fort Cosby at Schenectady, New York, he is reported to have lost his leg in 1758, during the French and Indian War. In 1757, along with Joshua Mauger, Cook pushed Governor Charles Lawrence to establish an elected assembly. In 1763, Cook established Chebogue and was the first to settle Lower Melbourne, Nova Scotia and is the namesake of the near-by Cooks Beach. He established the most profitable fishing industry in Western Nova Scotia. He was also the leader of the local militia. Cook married Louisa Ring March 30th, 1764. They had 11 children. Captain Cook died in 1821 and was buried on his farm in Lower Melbourne, but his headstone is in the Chebogue Cemetery.

It is housed in a former Capuchin convent dedicated to Saint Francis.Ros Belfordː The Rough Guide to Sicily, London 2014, , 273 It was inaugurated in the summer of 1984 and preserves the findings of over thirty years of excavations in Morgantina, ordered according to chronological and thematic criteria.  Works  In the three rooms are materials of prehistory and protohistory of the ancient city, coming from the village \\"castellucciano\\": smoothed basalt stone axes, tiny cointainers and ceramic fragments worked without the use of a lathe, with an essential linear engraved decoration. At the following Sicilian city, of the early Iron Age, instead, the acromi ceramic in carenate forms, of red and brown paste, finds evidences in the culture of Ausonius in Lipari. The exhibits belonging to the period from the ninth to the middle of the 5th century BC witness the coexistence of Sicels and Greek cultures in the town: antefixed of religious buildings, \\"pithoi\\", a domestic arula on which is depicted a boar, a \\"kernos\\" with three small cups and the greater crater of Euthymides, with simposium and \\"amazzonomachia\\" scenes, used for public banquets. The findings of the classical and Hellenistic period, up to the destruction of the city (211 BC), consist mainly of earthenware coming from the necropolis and urban sanctuaries of Demeter and Pershephone, including several busts of the latter, to which are added a large \\"black painted\\" lamp with three spouts and a fish dish, perhaps from Syracuse. A limestone statue without head, most likely of the goddess Demeter found in the central sanctuary in 1955, provided the material to show that the famous \\"Aphrodite\\" of the Paul Getty Museum in Malibu (USA) comes from Morgantina. In the former sacristy of the convent are exposed objects of common domestic use, agricultural and religious, offering a picture of the daily life of the inhabitants of the ancient city (kitchenware, children's toys, feminine trinkets, tools for agriculture).  The Goddess' Return  The museum in the 2010s is at the center of events of historical importance. The Italian State has succeeded in obtaining the return of precious artefacts stolen by \\"tombaroli\\" and, through the clandestine market bought by the main American museums. On 13 December 2009, two acroliths (two heads, three hands and three feet in marble) from the Greek archaic period, probably belonging to the goddesses Demeter and Kore, very revered in antiquity in Central Sicily, returned from the University of Virginia Museum. December 5, 2010, was the turn of the return from the Metropolitan Museum of New York of a service of sixteen pieces in silver for ritual and table uses, belonging to that Eupolemos, as revealed by the inscriptions engraved in votive arula. Finally, in the spring of 2011, the so-called \\"Goddess of Morgantina\\" returned. It is a statue of a treacherous limestone school with an acrolithic technique, in which it is more probable that the goddess Demeter should be recognized. Now it is exhibited at the Regional Archaeological Museum of Aidone, where it was presented on May 17, 2011, in the presence of the authorities. Today it is visible to the public.  Goddess of Morgantina  The Goddess of Morgantina is a statue illegally excavated from the archaeological site. Purchased years ago by the Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, it was returned to Italy on March 17, 2011 at the end of a dispute that lasted for several years between Italy and the United States. The Venus of Morgantina (more probably Kore or Demeter) is a statue 2.25 m high, carved between 425 BC and 400 BC in Sicily. The author would be a direct disciple of Phidias, operating in Magna Graecia. The material used to sculpt it is marble, used for the face and for the naked parts of the body, similar to the Metope of Selinunte. The drapery is instead in calcareous tufa, which has been ascertained to come from Sicily.

The campaign was established in 2009 by actress Greta Scacchi and Brighton restaurant-owner Nicholas Röhl, initially to launch the documentary adaption of The End of the Line. The annual photographs feature celebrities modelling nude, posing with dead endangered sealife as censor bars, to highlight issues around the sourcing and consumption of sealife. The campaign raises awareness of illegal fishing and pollution, and the preservation of marine life through reforms addressing deep-sea bottom trawling or fishing. It also aims to reduce the pressure on popular fish such as cod, and instead encouraging consumption of sprats, herring, mackerel and gurnard. The campaign's first photograph featured Scacchi covering her chest with an Icelandic cod, and the concept was inspired by an image of a naked woman holding a fish by advertising agency Leo Burnett. Co-founder Röhl's Brighton sushi restaurant, Moshimo, serves only sustainable fish, and was a contributing factor for the city of Brighton being shortlisted for Sustainable Fish City status. The restaurant funds the studio and make-up costs of the campaign through their paid membership scheme. Röhl attributed the campaign's success to the depiction of fish as creatures needing love and protection, rather than as foodstuffs, and as a \\"...wake-up call to the world...\\" to end over-fishing and the reduction of fish stocks.  Campaign impact  The Fishlove campaign has been considered a success as Rankin's photographs resulted in coverage of fish conservation across international news outlets. Bonham Carter's photograph has been credited as contributing towards government policy, with chancellor George Osborne's agreement to create a marine-life reserve around the Pitcairn Islands. It also influenced the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy. = Controversy and criticisms = In 2015, a seafood supermarket in Kyiv, Ukraine, misused some of the FishLove images in an advertising campaign. The campaign has been compared as a 'piscine version' of PeTA's \\"I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur\\" campaign, and has been criticised as an attention-seeking use of nudity in a lazy and ubiquitous fashion and its effectiveness has been questioned.  Featured models  Models have included journalists Mariella Frostrup and Eleanor Mills, actors Arthur Darvill, Eileen Atkins, Mélanie Laurent, Richard E. Grant, Emilia Fox, Ben Kingsley, Jerry Hall, Elizabeth Jagger, Josh Brolin, Helena Bonham Carter, Fiona Shaw, Barbara Cabrita, Julie Christie, Zoë Wanamaker, Judi Dench, Gillian Anderson, Tara Fitzgerald, Zoë Tapper, Michael Gambon, Simon Callow, Dakota Blue Richards, Asli Bayram, Miriam Margolyes, Mark Rylance, Dougray Scott, Alex Jennings, Hugh Bonneville, Jodhi May, Emma Thompson, Rula Lenska, Imelda Staunton, Eve Best, Jessie Buckley, Jane Horrocks, Cressida Bonas, Elizabeth McGovern, Sean Penn, Florence Keith-Roace, model Paris Jackson, dart-player Bobby George, dancer Gary Avis, director Steven Berkoff, fashion designer Kenzo Takada, musician Goldie, businessman Richard Branson and comedian Lenny Henry. The 60lb giant tuna from Bonham Carter's photoshoot was donated to Islington charity, Shelter From The Storm, to feed homeless people, and the fish from other photoshoots are generally not procured specifically for that purpose, and are also donated for consumption. Dench posed with a lobster to highlight increasing ocean acidification, which results in the changing health of lobster populations. = Photographers = In 2012, Rankin's photographs were exhibited at Pertwee, Anderson & Gold gallery in Soho, London, coinciding with the OCEAN2012 campaign against over-fishing. The logo and poster for the campaign were designed by Studio Am of Brighton. Fishlove photographs were also displayed at the Baudoin Lebon gallery in 2013.

Taxman, (born 1955) Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) is a Criminology Professor at George Mason University (2009–present) in Northern Virginia, United States as well as a Director at the Center for Advancing Correctional Excellence!. Her work is better known for its influence on the redesign of aspects of the behavioural corrections system, specifically pertaining to the reduction of recidivism and mechanisms to achieve this such as offender rehabilitation. She is known to the general public for her novel, Implementing Evidence-Based Practices in Community Corrections and Addiction Treatment (Springer, 2011). Taxman received the 2017 Joan McCord Award for her work concerning Experimental Criminology and the 2015 Caron Foundation Award for Research of the Year. Within her present day line of employment, she is also an Affiliate Professor at the College of Medicine at Howard University, based in Washington, D.C. (2012–present) as well as Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia (2013–present).  Overview  To date, Taxman has published in excess of 190 articles, among these is Tools of the Trade: A Guide to Incorporating Science into Practice (National Institute of Corrections, 2004). The guide outlines primarily the factors that contribute to criminal behaviour and the mechanism employed by correctional behaviour facilities for the prevention of offender recidivism. Of her most reputable works, Tools of the Trade: A Guide to Incorporating Science into Practice, Taxman outlines the process by which rehabilitation facilities can affect a decline in criminal behaviour. The article is segmented into the following sub sections: * Attitude corrections The publication advises offender correction facilities employ various techniques to redress criminal behaviour. Such techniques shall be evidenced through the actions of employees to accomplish the goals of the organisation and decrease the prominence of criminal-related issues. This section defines behavioural management as a construct affected by a number of factors: society, corrections, psychology and law. The chapter details a humanistic approach towards offenders, so as not to ostracise criminals and treat them as incapable of making meaningful contributions to society. In this, offenders must take an active role in the construction of their rehabilitation guidelines. * Mechanisms for effective communication According to Tools of the Trade, positive outcomes are more likely to arise when the offender is persuaded. As such, the examination process places strong emphasis on employee skills, specifically, communication and obtaining information relevant to the proper examination of offenders. Such information is then processed and used to construct “supervision plans” and “behavioural contracts”. In this, offenders receive constant feedback and have an obligation to improve their behaviour. This translates the goal of the offender rehabilitation and reduction of criminal recidivism into an actionable and measurable plan. Such an approach requires open and effective communication between employees and offenders at all times so as to provide the opportunity for individuals to adopt the appropriate skillset to recognise and redress behavioural deficiencies. Within the correctional facilities workplace environment, this process is more formally referred to as “staff- offender contacts”. It is paramount such communications are unambiguous so as to streamline the achievement of mutual offender and employee goals. The interview-style discussion adheres to a semi-structure of: introduction, middle and summary. In this, the conversation remains primarily goal- orientated while maintaining adaptability to employee methods. * Mechanisms to obtain information In the attitude correction process, employees collate information concerning offenders under their guidance. Such information is sourced widely from “staff-offender contacts”, mandatory testing for illicit substances, polygraph test results and various monitoring systems such as electronic surveillance, Global Positioning Satellite systems and fingerprinting or biometric scanning. The advantage of such a wide source of information means employees almost always reserve the ability to pin point the location of offenders. Present day, the movement towards “community supervision” has taken the place of “office-based supervision”. This is based on indications interviews in the workplace environment neglect to provide employees with sufficient information required for the adequate supervision of criminals, specifically pertaining to high-risk offenders. In person meetings occur routinely, generally restricted to monthly or weekly sittings, therefore non optimal to the collation of offenders’ progress. This constant monitoring enables behavioural correction employees to maintain a watchful-eye on the offender’s reintegration into society and monitor whether or not the individual is acting in line with “supervision plans” and “behavioural contracts”. This allows staff to identify prominent members of offender’s lives and foster appropriate employee-offender rapport. By extension of this, employees develop rapport with local home and business-owners who maintain the ability to a) offer information relevant to offenders and b) may be able to facilitate and support the offenders’ positive change. In this, both the community and technological surveillance as per the offenders’ risk level enables employees to adapt accordingly to counteract the recurrence of criminal behaviour. * How to incentivise offenders Given the extensive use of resources, information concerning noncompliance with conditions of parole, probation or rehabilitation is readily available for employees. By nature of the “behaviour management model”, there are specific sanctions or rewards in place for both violations and compliant actions. Sanctions and rewards serve as mechanisms to ensure offenders act in line with behavioural contracts. This form of incentivisation occurs across a spectrum that progressively limits offenders’ freedoms, placing restrictions based upon their respective lifestyle. Such limitations can manifest in the form of increased staff- offender contact and short- or long-term imprisonment. Noncompliance are offset by heavier impositions and phases of compliance are rewarded by a decrease in restrictions on daily activities. In facilitating positive progression, offenders are made aware of the actions that warrant rewards and sanctions. * Categories of criminals The degree to which offenders are supervised upon re-entering society is dependent upon their level of risk. Given this, criminals are classed according to the nature of their offence: aggressive and sex offenders, dealings in or use of illicit substances, white collar criminals and first-time offenders. However, all offenders must be supervised with respect to individual examination, communication, information and incentives. Proper examination method requires offenders be identified at the commencement of case planning. This ensures the correct guidelines are implemented based on the profile and description of the offender. These Guiding Principles are testament to Taxman’s well-researched title and heavy influence in the field of criminology. Of her most recognised published works, Implementing Evidence-Based Practices in Community Corrections and Addiction Treatment (Springer, 2011), is now part of the Springer Series on Evidence- Based Crime Policy (SSEBCP). This novel offers a platform for evidence-based programs to be reintroduced and reapplied for the more adequate provision of justice in the real-world context. The novel outlines mechanisms for positive offender rehabilitation based on extensive research into internal factors within the organisation, for example, faculty development and management buy- in and external factors, including stakeholder commitment and the allocation of resources and funding. The novel creates an actionable and measurable framework to ensure the implementation of evidence-based strategy in operational agencies. According to Taxman and co-writer, Belenko, factors influencing the effectiveness of outcomes pertaining to the behavioural corrections system are as follows: * Part One Taxman's novel is segmented into three parts, the first being the adaptability on the part of the broader community. This section of the novel is mostly concerned with the skills and resources of officers whom are entrusted to enforce the law within behavioural corrections facilities. This section questions the ability of officers to adopt various innovative structural frameworks based on readiness to adapt, learning capabilities and the goal-orientation of the organisation. Members of staff are required to be trained to a level deemed sufficient by the entity to ensure measurable achievement of organisational goals. This questions not only staff ability but overall success, insofar as the ability of the organisation to both train and retain employees as well as the commitment of staff to manifesting the vision of the organisation. * Part Two This section enquires into the progress of the organisation and how on track it is to achieve the intended outcome of the change. Here, Taxman and her co-writers link organisational success to commitment to its goals. Based on studies undergone to construct the text, it is concluded the overall ineffectiveness of goal implementation when the organisation demonstrated a lack of commitment to the integration of such innovations. Thus, organisational commitment to its vision and values is a mechanism to improve overall success. The process by which such outcomes are measured can be seen through a decline in offender recidivism and substance abuse. * Part Three In this section, Taxman and Belenko outline the mechanisms employed by an organisation to ensure the effective implementation of its goals and visions to innovate, counteract issues and engage in problem-solving behaviour. This is an ongoing methodology adopted for the overall enhancement of behavioural corrections systems. The process involves the monitoring of complaints on behalf of both officer and offenders and investigation into such complaints. Records must also be kept as issues arise as a means of measuring achievement goals. In addition, the organisation must prioritise issues based on merit and the overall level of their disruption to the organisations a) day-to-day life and culture and; b) goals and vision.  Educational background  Taxman's interest in Criminal Justice can be seen throughout the timeline of her various studies. In 1977, Taxman graduated from the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma with Bachelor of Arts (with Honours). Shortly after, she continued her studies within the field of Arts, graduating Rutgers University in Newark, New Jersey from a Master of Arts (with Honours) in 1981. In 1982, Taxman attended the Rutgers University again to complete her Doctor of Philosophy and earn her Ph.D. title.  Academia and professional experience  Taxman commenced work in 1977 as a Research Analyst for the Police Foundation, a non-profit organisation in many cities and states around the United States. However, her work within the field of Criminology began as she commenced her role as Research Assistant at Rutgers University (1978-1981). This led to her role as Acting Director for the CJCC, otherwise referred to as the Criminal Justice Coordinating Commission. In this role, she monitored the administration of justice and the standard of law enforcement within the Montgomery County. From 1980-1981, she was employed by Rutgers University as an Adjunct Instructor, and soon after, as a Staff Associate within the field of Applied Management Sciences in 1983-1986. Between 1988-1991, Taxman worked her way upwards within the CJCC organisation, moving into her role formally referred to as Deputy Director. Onwards between 1991-1994, she was employed by the Institute for Law and Justice as Principal Associate. Between 1999-2004, Taxman was employed at BGR, more commonly referred to as the Bureau of Governmental Research at the University of Maryland as Director. Between 2004-2007, she was employed by the Virginia Commonwealth University within the position of Full Professor. Present day, among other employment, within her main role as University Professor at George Mason University, Taxman teaches a number of criminology- related courses such as: Drugs and Crime, Justice Organisations and Administration, Corrections and Sentencing.  Awards and honours  Taxman has been accredited a number of awards, her most recent being the Joan McCord Award granted by the American Society of Criminology. For research within her respective field, she was awarded the Caron Foundation Award for Research of the Year in 2015. She was also acknowledged to be among the most productive Criminology Scholars in the Journal of Criminal Justice Education. In 2013, Henriikka Weir and Erin Orrick recognised Taxman as one of The Most Prolific Female Scholars in Elite Criminology. In 2013 again, Taxman was awarded the Ted Palmer and Rita Warren Differential Intervention Award and the Title of Distinguished Scholar within her respective fields of Sentencing and Corrections by the American Society of Criminology. For her work on Collaborative Behavioural Management to reduce Drug-Related Crimes and Substance-Abuse, she was awarded the Best Research Abstract Award in 2011 by AMERSA, more formally referred to as the Association for Medical Education and Research in Substance Abuse. In 2009, Tewksburt R. recognised Taxman among The Most Successful Criminal Justice Scholars and Departments in Research Grant Acquisition. For contributions to the field of Criminology, the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services awarded Taxman the Dic2000.

She was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2018, together with Gérard Mourou, for the practical implementation of chirped pulse amplification. She is a professor at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. She served as fellow, vice president, and president of The Optical Society, and is currently chair of their Presidential Advisory Committee. In 2018, she was listed as one of BBC's 100 Women. Early life and education Strickland was born on 27 May 1959, in Guelph, Ontario, Canada to Edith J. (), an English teacher, and Lloyd Strickland, an electrical engineer. After graduating from Guelph Collegiate Vocational Institute, she decided to attend McMaster University because its engineering physics program included lasers and electro-optics, areas of particular interest to her. At McMaster, she was one of three women in a class of twenty-five. Strickland graduated with a B.Eng. degree in engineering physics in 1981. Strickland studied for her graduate degree in The Institute of Optics, receiving a Ph.D. degree from the University of Rochester in 1989. She conducted her doctoral research at the associated Laboratory for Laser Energetics, supervised by Gérard Mourou. Strickland and Mourou worked to develop an experimental setup that could raise the peak power of laser pulses, to overcome a limitation, that when the maximal intensity of laser pulses reached gigawatts per square centimetre, self-focusing of the pulses severely damaged the amplifying part of the laser. Their 1985 technique of chirped pulse amplification stretched out each laser pulse both spectrally and in time before amplifying it, then compressed each pulse back to its original duration, generating ultrashort optical pulses of terawatt to petawatt intensity. Using chirped pulse amplification allowed smaller high-power laser systems to be built on a typical laboratory optical table, as \\"table-top terawatt lasers\\". The work received the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physics. Career and research Strickland's ultrafast laser group at University of Waterloo, in June 2017 From 1988 to 1991, Strickland was a research associate at the National Research Council of Canada, where she worked with Paul Corkum in the Ultrafast Phenomena Section, which had the distinction at that time of having produced the most powerful short-pulse laser in the world. She worked in the laser division of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory from 1991 to 1992 and joined the technical staff of Princeton University's Advanced Technology Center for Photonics and Opto- electronic Materials in 1992. She joined the University of Waterloo in 1997 as an assistant professor. She became the first full-time female professor in physics at the University of Waterloo. Strickland is currently a professor, leading an ultrafast laser group that develops high-intensity laser systems for nonlinear optics investigations. She has described herself as a \\"laser jock\\": Strickland's recent work has focused on pushing the boundaries of ultrafast optical science to new wavelength ranges such as the mid-infrared and the ultraviolet, using techniques such as two-colour or multi-frequency methods, as well as Raman generation. She is also working on the role of high- power lasers in the microcrystalline lens of the human eye, during the process of micromachining of the eye lens to cure presbyopia. Strickland became a fellow of The Optical Society in 2008. She served as its vice president and president in 2011 and 2013 respectively, and was a topical editor of its journal Optics Letters from 2004 to 2010. She is currently the chair of The Optical Society's Presidential Advisory Committee. She is a member of and previously served as a board member and Director of Academic Affairs for the Canadian Association of Physicists. Strickland had not applied to be a full professor prior to her Nobel prize, but in October 2018, she told the BBC that she had subsequently applied and was promoted to full professorship at the University of Waterloo. =Selected publications=  * Awards and recognition Strickland, 2016 * 1998 – Alfred P.

Arthur Ashkin received the other half of the Prize for unrelated work on optical tweezers. She became the third woman ever to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, after Marie Curie in 1903 and Maria Goeppert Mayer in 1963. Strickland and Mourou published their pioneering work \\"Compression of amplified chirped optical pulses\\" in 1985, while Strickland was still a doctoral student under Mourou. Their invention of chirped pulse amplification for lasers at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics in Rochester led to the development of the field of high-intensity ultrashort pulses of light beams. Because the ultrabrief and ultrasharp light beams are capable of making extremely precise cuts, the technique is used in laser micromachining, laser surgery, medicine, fundamental science studies, and other applications. It has enabled doctors to perform millions of corrective laser eye surgeries. She said that after developing the technique they knew it would be a significant discovery. When she received the Nobel Prize, many commentators were surprised that she had not reached the rank of full professor. In response, Strickland said that she had \\"never applied\\" for a professorship; \\"it doesn't carry necessarily a pay raise… I never filled out the paper work… I do what I want to do and that wasn't worth doing.\\" =Order of Canada= Strickland was appointed as a Companion of the Order of Canada in 2019, one of Canada's highest civilian honours. Personal life Strickland is married to Douglas Dykaar, who received a doctorate in Electrical Engineering from the University of Rochester.LinkedIn profile of Doug Dykaar They have two children. Strickland's daughter Hannah is a graduate student in astrophysics at the University of Toronto. Strickland's son Adam is studying comedy at Humber College.

In WWII, in prisoner-of-war camps, goon-baiting was used amongst prisoners of all nationalities. The French sung banned songs without moving their lips at Appell. It was not quite sabotage; it was an art form, and the aim of goon- baiting was to achieve maximum impact without endangering yourself. Though not all prisoners participated in goon-baiting, some thinking it was bad manners, others thinking it gave any oppressor an opportunity, or more reason to retaliate, therefore it only brought with it more suffering. Examples of goon- baiting include, one prisoner being counted more than once in Appell in order to cover for a missing comrade, or to sow some confusion; or exaggerated salutes. Etymology Some claim the roots of the term ‘goon’ come from a 1930’s cartoon character called Alice the Goon and people also used the term goon to describe an incompetent professional bully. Pete Tunstall claims a fellow prisoner called Bill Fowler was the first to ever coin the term amongst the prisoners and that Fowler referenced a well known comic strip.

Content The book was written by Gordon Allport in the early 1950s and first published by Addison-Wesley in 1954. Thomas F. Pettigrew and Kerstin Hammann selected, as the book's most lasting contribution, its success in redefining the relation between intergroup contact and prejudice. While some previous scholars argued that contact between different groups leads to increased prejudice and conflict, Allport argued to the contrary, a view that Pettigrew and Hammann describe as supported by \\"literally hundreds of studies from dozens of nations\\".Pettigrew, Thomas F., & Hammann, Kerstin. Gordon Willard. 2016. Allport: The nature of prejudice. In S. Salzborn (Ed.), Klassiker der Sozialwissenshaften [Classics of social science]. pp. 174–178. Wiesbaden, Germany: Springer. [English version]. Another idea introduced in the book became known as Allport's Scale, a measure of prejudice starting from antilocution and ending up at genocidal extermination. In simpler terms, Allport argued that even simple prejudice, if left unchecked, can develop into an extreme form. Impact and significance The book was called a classic a decade after its initial publication, in 1965. Irwin Katz, writing in Political Psychology in 1991 on the topic of \\"classics in political psychology\\", called the book a landmark and \\"one of the most influential and often-cited publications in the entire field of intergroup relations\\". In 2016 Pettigrew and Hammann described the book as \\"probably the most read volume in the history of social psychology\\", noting that it has received numerous translations and remains influential in the modern study of prejudice. In a volume published roughly on the fiftieth anniversary of the book's original debut, On the Nature of Prejudice: Fifty Years after Allport (2008), the authors referred to Allport's book as \\"the fundamental work for social psychology of prejudice\\" and the most widely cited work on the subject, still used in teaching and quoted in modern research. Most contemporary research on how racism shapes public opinion is rooted in The Nature of Prejudice. A further influence of the book was the later formulation of the common ingroup identity theory. Pettigrew and Hammann also credit Allport's ideas with influencing government policies, in the United States and elsewhere, which have successfully reduced levels of prejudice. Describing the book's significance, Katz noted that it \\"defined the field of intergroup relations for social psychologist as the study of prejudice and its effects on group interactions\\". He noted, however, that Allport's assumption that prejudice causes discrimination has still to be proven beyond doubt; though other scholars also stressed that many of other assumptions Allport expressed in the book have become accepted since its publication. In addition to being highly influential in the field of social psychology, the revised (and shortened) second edition of the book (The Nature of Prejudice: Abridged) published in 1958 was also a success on the mass market, being written in a relatively simple way that was accessible to a general readership. One of the reasons for its success, in Pettigrew and Hammann's opinion, was the boldness of its topic: while targeting a white, Protestant, American, and mostly male readership, it discussed numerous examples of anti-African-American, anti- Jewish, anti-Catholic, and anti-female prejudices.

The film's English cast features Rob Schneider (in a dual role), Haylie Duff, Norm Macdonald, Lauren Elizabeth, and Tom Kenny (in a triple role). Many of the film's fight scenes were animated using motion capture. Plot In Imperial China, a peace-loving soldier named Jinbao has heard about Merryland from his grandfather who gave him a necklace he got. His Captain states that the world won't be at peace. During an attack on their camp, Jinbao runs off the cliff and finds himself in Merryland in the form of the giant panda. When falling out the sky, he is saved by Flying Pig. Jinbao learns about Merryland and how it is ruled by an evil master and his Phantom Army as well as the prophecy of the Panda Warrior. While traveling through the forest, they are attacked by a giant spider. Then they spar with Mantis who becomes their ally. Arriving at a village of onion creatures, they find it attacked by the Phantom Army which is led by a pyrokinetic tree spirit named Charcoal. With help from Flying Pig claiming that Charcoal insulted his grandfather, Jinbao subdues Charcoal in the nearby water. A Ginseng Spirit arrives and plays the Song of Peace to purify it. Jinbao learns from the Ginseng Spirit that he must rest in order to have the energy to do the Song of Peace. Now purified, Charcoal joins up with Jinbao. Traveling through the field, Jinbao, Flying Pig, Mantis, and Charcoal are attacked by the Phantom Army's general Cattle. They are joined by Flying Pig's fellow rebels Cotton Sheep Sister, Steel Mouth Chicken, Horse, Big-Eyed Monkey, Golden Retriever, and Big-Eared Rabbit. Despite the difficulty, the group manages to knock Cattle off a cliff. Jinbao gets to know each of the members where he did annoy Horse by stating that he looks more like a hippopotamus than a horse. The group arrives at the headquarters of the rebellion where they meet with Lion King. When he sees Jinbao, Lion King states that Jinbao is not the Panda Warrior of Legend. The history is that Merryland is guarded by the heavenly sperm whales Hope and Faith. When Hope absorbed too much of the Dragon Ball of Light, a warrior from Earth appeared and became the Panda Warrior. Jinbao figures out that the Panda Warrior is his grandfather. When his grandfather defeated Hope and returned to his world with the necklace from Merryland's ruler Princess Angelica, an evil rat from another world arrived in Merryland where he took control of Hope's body and turned it into a Nine-Headed Snake in order to enslave Merryland. Jinbao asks for Lion King to train him. Despite many painful and comical outcomes, Jinbao passes the training. Jinbao and Charcoal pay a visit to the Fox Elder in order to find the Nine-Headed Snake's lair where he is keeping Princess Angelica captive. After getting a stone that came off the lair and a piece of paper to use for emergencies, Jinbao and Charcoal find Cotton Sheep Sister who states that the other rebels have been captured by the Phantom Army. Once they have found the Nine-Headed Snake's lair, the three of them are attacked by a corrupted Flying Pig who they knocked out. Traveling through the caves, Jinbao, Charcoal, and Cotton Sheep Sister are attacked by the corrupted rebels and brought to Cattle. It is then revealed that the rebels faked being corrupted as they attack Cattle. Once Cattle is restrained, the Ginseng Spirit arrives and plays his Song of Peace to purify Cattle. Now purified, Cattle joins up with the rebels to rescue Princess Angelica. As the group gets further into the Nine-Headed Snake's lair, they are attacked by the Nine-Headed Snake. Each of them tries to attack the Nine-Headed Snake only to fail because his heads can regenerate. Charcoal sacrifices himself to buy everyone else time to get to Princess Angelica. Big- Eyed Monkey reads from the partially-burned paper that one must be sacrificed to save everyone. They find her chained over the water that is filled with evil poison that is slowly corrupting the Dragon Ball of Light. Cattle starts to make up for his mistake by traversing the poison water to rescue Princess Angelica as he is the only one who can break the chains. Cattle collapses as Jinbao hopes that he'll recover. When the Nine-Headed Snake starts to catch up to them, Mantis appears and has dug a hole for everyone to escape through. Cattle buys everyone time to get out. The Nine-Headed Snake starts to tunnel after them as his flying lair collapses. When morning comes, Steel Mouth Chicken crows at the sight of the sun. As Jinbao faces the Nine-Headed Snake, a recovering Princess Angelica states that the Nine-Headed Snake is at his weakest during the day. The rebels join the fight against the Nine-Headed Snake. The Ginseng Spirit shows up and plays his Song of Peace to weaken the Nine-Headed Snake. Faith shows up to help as she restores the land, purifies the Phantom Army, and even revives Cattle and Charcoal. The rebels then do a combo attack against its heads in order to defeat it while getting entangled. The final blow breaks the Nine-Headed Snake as the evil rat emerges and flees Merryland. What's left of the Nine-Headed Snake is restored to Hope as she rejoins Faith in the sky. Princess Angelica gives them the Dragon Ball of Light as she states that Hope and Faith will continue to guard Merryland. Everyone celebrates their victory. During the credits, Jinbao is back on Earth as he spars with his Captain using the moves that he learned in Merryland as well as drinking Chinese alcohol. Their sparring ends in a draw.

It was produced by West, with co- production from No I.D. and additional production from Jeff Bhasker. The track was covered by a cappella group Pentatonix on their 2016 album A Pentatonix Christmas. It is about the passing of Kanye's mother Donda West. West performed the song live thrice on The Yeezus Tour. The music video was officially released in February 2010, which includes a revamped version for the audio. Composition and recording The vocal chorus from 1983 track \\"Memories Fade\\" by English pop rock band Tears for Fears is repurposed within the song. Co-producer No I.D. revealed that he was the one who came across \\"Memories Fade\\" when sitting around listening to records from the 1980s and played it for West - as soon as No I.D. heard West make usage of the track, he knew it was special. \\"Coldest Winter\\" is centered around the passing of Kanye's mother Donda that occurred in November 2007 - she was very important to Kanye, since he was quoted after her death as saying to MTV: \\"My mother was my everything\\" and showed that they had a connection through music when Donda was alive by saying: \\"My mother always kept me around music. She was also my first manager.\\" When performing at Madison Square Garden on November 24, 2013 during The Yeezus Tour, West went into the story of how he wrote it after her death. Release On October 16, 2008, an excerpt of the track was released by West on the radio station Power 106 in Los Angeles, around one month before the featuring album was released. A slightly revamped version of it was used when West released the music video on February 24, 2010. Critical reception Michael Roffman of Consequence of Sound branded the song's position as the closing track as showing in conjunction to West's previous three studio albums that \\"808s slams the door on it all, explaining why there's so much hate, self-aggrandizing, and animosity on everything of his that's come out since'. Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork pointed out 'the 909 and descending synth' of \\"Coldest Winter\\" as being \\"among the sonic highlights\\" of the album. Live performances After West had finished performing the track on October 26, 2013 in Los Angeles during The Yeezus Tour, a beast with red eyes appeared. When West performed the first concert in New York City on the same tour, the song was part of his set list. As well as this, he performed it when taking The Yeezus Tour to Madison Square Garden on November 24, 2013 and went into the story of writing about his mother passing away after it happened, which was a glimpse of vulnerability for West. At the 2015 Hollywood Bowl, West performed the song live with fake snow, which gathered notable attention from his fanbase. The snow was unleashed above the audience during the performance. Music video The music video was officially released on the internet on February 24, 2010 and was directed by Nabil Elderkin. Elderkin gave a heads up for viewers on how haunting it's going to be two days before the release. A revamped version of \\"Coldest Winter\\" was used for the audio of the video. Stereogum wrote in response to this version being used by describing the new track as feeling so cold that it is \\"Total beat wraith.\\" In the music video, a bride is depicted running through a forest in slow motion and West doesn't appear at all. Elderkin said of West's approach to his videos at the time: > He didn't want to be in 'Paranoid,' to be honest. There was more Kanye in > 'Paranoid' [originally], and I took him out. He's just cool right now with > putting out visuals that fit the song without having to be in it. I think > he's in that place in his life where right now he just wants to make art.

Function This gene encodes a subunit of the asialoglycoprotein receptor. This receptor is a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in serum glycoprotein homeostasis by mediating the endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of glycoproteins with exposed terminal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residues. The asialoglycoprotein receptor may facilitate hepatic infection by multiple viruses including hepatitis B, and is also a target for liver-specific drug delivery. The asialoglycoprotein receptor is a hetero-oligomeric protein composed of major and minor subunits, which are encoded by different genes. The protein encoded by this gene is the more abundant major subunit. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene.

It was built as the Hotel Durant in 1919, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. History In the early 20th century, the automotive industry in Flint rapidly expanded, raising Flint's population from 13,000 in 1900 to more than 90,000 in 1920. Buick and Chevrolet led the rise of the automakers in Flint. When both were folded into the new General Motors (GM) in 1908, the company dominated Flint's economy. The rise of GM quickly created an urgent need for more and better hotel accommodations in Flint. By the late 1910s, the Durant Hotel Company, headed by GM chairman William C. Durant, had raised $500,000 to construct a new hotel. The company contracted with the United Hotels Company of America to supervise the construction and furnishing of the hotel, and to manage it after opening. In 1918, United retained the architectural firm of Esenwein & Johnson of Buffalo, New York, to design the hotel, and construction began in 1919. The hotel was originally planned as a six-story structure, but two additional stories were added during construction to respond to increased demand. The hotel opened with 264 guest rooms on December 14, 1920. The Durant was immediately Flint's leading hotel, by far the largest and the most distinguished in the area. In addition to hosting guests from out of town, it was used by local groups and individuals for meetings and celebrations. In 1942, the hotel was purchased by the Albert Pick Hotels Company. By the late 1960s, GM's operations in Flint were declining, and there was less need for a large hotel. The 1973 oil crisis provided the final shock, and the Hotel Durant closed its doors in 1973. The hotel remained vacant, with various redevelopment plans falling through. In 2005, it was purchased by the Genesee County Land Bank. In 2008, it was taken over by an LLC, and renovations began to turn the former hotel into an apartment complex. The new apartments opened in 2010, and reached full capacity the next year. Description The Durant is a large eight-story Neo-Georgian building with a splayed U configuration fitting into a trapezoidal lot. It has three primary exterior facades, each having a two-story base finished in limestone, with the upper six stories finished in red brick with limestone detailing, including bands at the fourth and eighth floors. Two main entrances leading to the lobby are located to the south (the base of the U) and west facades. The primary entrance on the south is flanked by two large arched windows; a set of four similar windows are on the west side. Commercial storefronts ring the remainder of the base. The upper floors contain identical, six-over-six, double-hung windows with limestone sills. The building is topped with a brick and limestone cornice/parapet.

The attack was defeated by South Vietnamese forces assisted by United States bombing of North Vietnamese base areas in Cambodia. Background Since the Khmer Rouge had closed off access to Cambodia's sea ports, supplies for the Khmer Republic were dependent on convoys up the Mekong River from South Vietnam. South Vietnam's border provinces of Kien Phong, Châu Đốc and Kiên Giang, as well as the southern areas of the adjacent Cambodian provinces of Prey Veng, Kandal, Takéo and Kampot, had long been used by the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and Viet Cong (VC) for base areas and lines of communication. In early 1973 the PAVN had up to 11 regiments in Cambodia, all used in South Vietnam except for 3 or 4 deployed against the Khmer National Armed Forces (FANK). The US and South Vietnamese were determined to keep the convoys moving and the Khmer Republic alive, while the PAVN was determined to stop them. The South Vietnamese also sought to prevent PAVN main force incursions and infiltration of supplies and men into South Vietnam and the PAVN sought to keep its lines of communication open through Cambodia and into South Vietnam. The river town of Hồng Ngự, where the Hồng Ngự tributary flows into the Mekong River, became the focal point of the PAVN's attacks to clear impediments to infiltration and interdict the Mekong convoys as they moored at the Republic of Vietnam Navy base at Tân Châu opposite Hồng Ngự before crossing into Cambodia. Battle In March the PAVN concentrated the 174th and 207th Regiments, 6th Division, the 272nd Regiment (detached from the 9th Division) and elements of the 75th Artillery Group in Base Area 704 in Prey Veng Province, Cambodia northwest of Hồng Ngự. With the 207th leading, supported by artillery, the PAVN attacked from Base Area 704 towards Hồng Ngự. Not only did they meet immediate heavy resistance, but their rear area was pounded by USAF B-52's and tactical bombers. While US forces had disengaged from Vietnam on 28 January 1973 in accordance with the terms of the Paris Peace Accords, US military operations in Cambodia and Laos would continue until 15 August 1973 and the USAF was heavily engaged in support of the FANK campaign to clear the banks of the Mekong from the Vietnam border to Phnom Penh. One B-52 strike on 23 April 1973 north of the border between the Mekong and the Hồng Ngự stream caught a large portion of the attacking force with survivors reported seeing impressed civilians carrying the bodies or more than 100 PAVN from the area. In mid-April the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) 15th Infantry Regiment, 9th Division, together with the 2nd Armored Cavalry Squadron and a Regional Forces Group countererattacked. Although casualties were heavy, Republic of Vietnam Air Force and Navy support helped enable the ARVN troops to clear the east bank of the Mekong from Hồng Ngự to the Cambodian frontier. The attack inflicted heavy casualties on the PAVN and dealt a damaging blow to their morale. By the end of May, one battalion of the 207th Regiment had only 100 men. Aftermath By 4th May the fighting had reduced to intermittent small contacts and light shellings. 422 PAVN dead had been counted, while ARVN casualties were 94 killed and 36 missing. Civilian casualties in the action were by far the highest since the ceasefire, over 300, of which 80 were killed by PAVN artillery. Almost 300 houses were destroyed by PAVN fire. In the second week of April alone 123 122mm rockets hit Hồng Ngự.

He lived for a time in Lancashire and in the upper Calder Valley area of Yorkshire but spent most of his adult life in Barry, in South Wales, where he was also deeply involved in politics and stood for parliament in the general election of 1923 representing the Labour Party. He was the elder brother of the pottery and fabric designer William Worrall. Early life Worrall was born in Wednesbury, the son of Thomas Worrall, a blacksmith.England & Wales, Civil Registration Birth Index, 1837–1915 Thomas Frederick was the eldest of three boys but had two step sisters and a step brother.1881 England census: Staffordshire, Darlaston, District 2: piece 2871, folio 28 The family lived in the Woods Bank area of Darlaston which was heavily industrialized, with foundries, mines and metal works.They lived on the side of a tramway that connected various metal-working plants, and this tramway formed the site of what is now Moxley Road. By the early 1890s the whole family had moved to the village of Church in the county of Lancashire, where the elder siblings were involved in local industries. Worrall senior, however, worked for a time as a blacksmith in Cheshire so was living away from the family.1891 England censuses: Church, Lancashire: piece 3409, folio 86; Cheadle, Cheshire: piece 2801, folio 61 Although the centre of Church was heavily built up, with close-packed, terraced housing and many mills, foundries and chemical works, the Worralls lived in Dill Hall Lane which was surrounded by fields and pleasant views of countryside. There was a vista from their house across the Leeds and Liverpool Canal to Dunkenhalgh Park. Thomas Frederick married Martha Green in the spring of 1899 and their first-born was Robert, born in 1900.England & Wales, Civil Registration Marriage Index, 1837–1915 Martha's family had built the Albion Mill, which became known locally as Green's Mill,See description of their family get together in Clitheroe Advertiser and Times, 17 July 1936, p. 7 It was while a young man in the north of England that Worrall's artistic leanings emerged. He attended art lessons in Manchester and created a series of watercolours of local scenes including Priestly Clough and Fern Gore, both in nearby Accrington, and Stoodley Pike in Yorkshire (see list of works, below). There is a photograph of him aged about 20 years in Haslingden public library, labelled Tom Worrall, artist. Not all of his pieces are signed, but when he did so he generally used the signature T. Worrall or sometimes the initials TW. Artistic ability and an eye for colour was clearly a family trait as Worrall's brother William became a cotton print designer, and his youngest brother, Simeon, a painter and decorator.Worrall entry in 1901 census for Church, Lancashire reference RG13/3917 By the time Thomas Frederick was in his late twenties, he himself was a working as a blacksmith in the neighboring county of Yorkshire, at a quarry in Southowram. This was a much less industrialized part of the country, indeed the family’s residence was “West Fields” adjacent to farmland. There were more children, with daughters Bertha and Mary born in 1902 and 1906 respectively.1901 England census, Southowram: piece 4118, folio 206 Worrall continued to work as a blacksmith, but was a journeyman, not a master.See details on birth certificate of Mary Worrall, born 21 September 1906. Later life Worrall's election poster, 1923 Thomas and Martha with their offspring, son- and daughter-in law and grandchildren The family moved again, this time to south Wales, where Thomas Frederick now began to work as a gas fitter. Their residence in 1911 was a terraced house, typical of the type found in the industrialized south Wales valleys but their village, Nelson, was semi-rural and surrounded by views of distant coasts and mountains. Once again, as in Darlaston, they lived alongside a tramway that now forms the base of a metalled road, namely Crescent Street. They named their terraced house Primrose Cottage, which still exists. Worrall had visited this part of the country in 1910 to address meetings of socialists, illustrating his interest in left-wing politics, supporting at that time the Independent Labour Party.See 'Barry I.L.P.' in Barry Herald, 3 June 1910 and 'Wild disorder' in Aberdare Leader, 25 June 1910; https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3646303/3646310 Such was his interest that he attended the I.L.P. conferences in 1906 and 1907 and addressed the delegates.Reports of the Independent Labour Party Annual Conferences, 1906 and 1907, pages 95 and 97 respectively The south Wales years were Worrall’s most active as a painter and when the family moved to live in the small town of Barry on the coast, his portfolio grew to include many observations of nearby maritime areas as well as further inland and further away. The Worralls' residence in Cardiff Road, gave a view over Swanbridge Bay and Sully Island which inspired many depictions of that seascape.See address details in the birth certificate of Edith Worrall, born 11 Nov 2016, Barry. Although it was work firstly as a time keeper then as a store man in the new cement plant to the west of the town that first occupied him,See occupational details in birth certificate of Bessie Worrall born 3 September 1913 Worrall returned to working with gas. He became an oxy-acetylene welder and lived in Barry until the end of his life, latterly in Hywel Crescent,See address and occupational information in footnote 9 and in England and Wales register (1939), ref RG101/7315l and painted numerous images of local scenes. His family expanded too, with daughters Bessie and Edith born in 1913 and 1916 respectively. He became increasingly politically active, and tried to be selected as the Labour Party candidate for the Llandaff and Barry constituency in 1918. He was unsuccessful on that occasion but was selected and stood in the 1923 general election. He received nearly 8000 votes but came third behind the Unionist and Liberal contenders.D. Moore (ed.), Barry: The Centenary Book (Barry, 1985), p. 394. He may have become disillusioned by the Labour Party and returned to his original interest in the Independent labour Party, as he attended the I.L.P. annual conference in 1925.Annual report of the Independent Labour Party, 1925, p. 181 During this time Worrall made visits back to Lancashire and painted scenes including the war memorial in Great Harwood which had been unveiled in 1926. He and his wife and elder children attended Workers Educational Association courses in Oxford which gave him opportunities to sketch scenes of the waterways and colleges, and visits to his two brothers in London and Glastonbury provided further potential for artistic work.See William E Worrall's entry in England and Wales register (1930), Stone Down, Glastonbury After retirement from gas fitting, Worrall collected subscriptions for the Barry and District Co-operative and Industrial Society,See occupation information, England and Wales register (1939), ref RG101/7315l a group in which he was a committee member until 1948.Returns of Barry and District Co- operative and Industrial Society (1939–1948), National Library of Wales. In 1938 he and his wife travelled to the United States where he created a collection of scenes including around Niagara, the Potomac, Blue Ridge Mountains and the Californian and New Mexico deserts.UK, Outward Passenger Lists, 1890–1960 [database on-line]; The National Archives at Washington, D.C: Passenger Lists of Vessels Arriving at Boston, Massachusetts, 1891–1943; Manifests of Alien Arrivals in the Seattle, Washington District; NAI: 2953576 Worrall also travelled to Greece and Italy, working as a stevedore to help fund the ventures,Interview with Worrall's grandson, William Morris Jones, National Library of Wales Sound Archive and some art from this period exists in private collections. By this time his creative work had moved away from mostly industrial and urban scenes to generally picturesque rural landscapes and included settings in the Lake District, Cornwall and Somerset. His depictions often included water, and he frequently used the technique of placing a house and/or tree in the foreground or middle distance. A good example of this is his painting of Stoodley Pike in Yorkshire, currently on display in Todmorden public library. Worrall sometimes used family visits as opportunities for art work. For example, a family get together in Haslingden in 1936 was a chance to paint scenes of West Yorkshire;See note 6 visits to his daughter, Edith, who obtained a teaching post in Clitheroe led to depictions of the countryside around the River Whalley; and his brother's death and burial in Keswick led to Lake District landscapes. A visit to his brother-in-law in Mt. Rainier, Maryland, gave rise to paintings of the River Potomac, which are now in Washington DC Public Library, Killingley library and Brunswick Heritage Museum in Washington DC. Thomas Frederick Worrall suffered from stomach cancer and died of heart failure in 1957 at home at 7 Hywel Drive, Barry. His daughter, Bertha was present and reported the death to the local registrar.Death certificate, GRO Reference: 1957 S Quarter in East Glamorgan Volume 08B Page 293 He is buried in Merthyr Dyfan cemetery in Barry.

Have also been photographing an ana-baptist sect [...] the amish [...] They are shrewd, hard, tight, hypocritical as any people ever were [...] yet with a strange beauty in their children, and a clean hardness about their lives which is most attractive [...] But when a people use their religious people use their orthodox beliefs as a shield against the encroachment of the material world, they are already in defeat\\"  Recognition  He first exhibited his work in 1947Francis, H.

In the meantime Wood began writing reviews of local jazz musicians for the Cleveland Press and Downbeat Magazine, and made a regular income as an advertising agent. Curator Edward Steichen chose Wood’s photograph of a pensive barefoot Mexican girl hurrying with her empty basket past a wooden door for the 1955 world-touring the Museum of Modern Art exhibit The Family of Man, seen by 9 million visitors. Woods had been included in a previous MoMA show Photographs by 51 Photographers August 1 to September 17, 1950.  The Scovill photographs  Around 1949 Wood and his young family moved to 1294 Spruce Court in the Lakeview Terrace, one of the nation’s first federally funded housing projects, and in the 1950s Wood had several one-man and two-man shows of imagery made in the neighbourhood. His principal subjects were inhabitants of the Scovill Avenue area of Cleveland, familiar to him from his visits to jazz clubs in the neighbourhood in the late 1930s and early 1940s.Counterpoint, Volume 17, Issue 5, 1952 Stanley Associates, p.25 Exhibition venues included Image Gallery (New York City), the San Francisco Museum, the Los Angeles County Museum and an exhibition of Scovill photographs at the 1030 Gallery in Cleveland from February 19-March 11, 1950.Milliken, W.

His Girl with Doll, part of the Scovill series, won first place in the 1951 American Photography magazine annual contest. Also that year, the Akron Art Museum held a joint show by Jasper Wood and friend Harry Schulke who were each asked to invite 13 photographers to exhibit work alongside theirs. Wood invited Ben Shahn, Walker Evans, Ansel Adams, Edward Steichen, and Bernice Abbott.American Photography July 1951: pages 420-423 In 1953, Wood also ventured into film with a 15-minute short Streetcar,Belton, J.

Rutgers University Press. which provides a cross-section of life in Cleveland by depicting passengers traveling the tramway in the early 1950s, just before it stopped running in Cleveland in 1954.Erick Trickey '\\"Streetcar\\" by Jasper Wood', Cleveland Magazine blog Sunday, September 7, 2008 Wood’s motivation in making photographs and film was existential and humanist, and he was not interested in deriving profit from or making a career of a creative medium which he regarded as a means to connect with his subject and to capture what he called the ‘felt moment seen’, in his paraphrase of Henri Cartier- Bresson’s ‘decisive moment’. For a living, he and partner Carl Malmquist established Malmquist and Wood advertising art studio in 1955, a concern profitable enough that the family no longer qualified to live in the housing project where they had built a modest life and they relocated to a three- bedroom apartment in Cleveland Heights where they lived a more privileged existence.James Bigley II (2016) The Lost Art of Jasper Wood, Cleveland Magazine, Saturday, October 01, 2016 Later career Wood’s interest in photography wavered but his love of art continued, bringing him success as an art dealer. A film society he’d founded screened others' works at the Cleveland Museum of Art and the Masonic Temple. When his friend Nico Jacobellis was arrested on obscenity charges in 1959 for showing Louis Malle’s The Lovers at the Heights Art Theater, Wood founded 'Citizens for Freedom of the Mind'. Through it he raised funds for the defence of bookseller James Lowell and counterculture poet D. A. Levy against charges of obscenity corrupting a minor during their poetry reading on November 15, 1966. Wood had stopped taking photographs altogether by 1960 and his last show was in Image Gallery (New York City) that year. By 1970 he had closed Malmquist and Wood for an early retirementInterview in The Plain Dealer, Aug. 2, 1970 and he and Manning married and purchased a house in San Cristobal, living in Mexico until 1973 when Wood returned to work as an advertising agent, relocating to Raleigh, North Carolina, to be near his eldest son. Wood died in 2002, survived by his sons Denishttp://www.deniswood.net/bio.htm and Chris and his wife, who died in 2008.

It holds several historical buildings dating back to the mid-1800s, such as the Grand Pacific Hotel. Clint Williams had a very large role in the restoration process for the hotel, which revitalized the square.  History  The oldest, and most historic, existing building in Grand Pacific Junction, the Grand Pacific Hotel, was erected in 1840. There are about 30 buildings and storefronts that consist in this junction today. A few of the oldest buildings are the Jail house, built in 1860, and the Granary building, built in 1875. Both were renovated in the late 1900s and serve different uses today. The Granary building used to be a storage and market for grain and feed, while the Jailhouse was the main jail house of the police department in that era.  Grand Pacific Hotel  The Grand Pacific Hotel served as a hotel until 1888 when Philip Simmerer bought it and turned it into a hardware store. It continued as a store until the 1970s. The Grand Pacific Hotel was then owned by Bill Kucklick, and he renamed it Kucklick's Village Square Annex. On October 10, 1975, while Kucklick owned the building, it was put on the National Register of Historic Places, and was known in the register for having Greek Revival-style architecture. During the time when the hotel was a hardware store, it also housed a dentist's and doctor's office on the third floor. To make it easier for customers to access those offices without having to go through the store, a staircase was added on the south side of the building. In 1989, Clint Williams, a realtor, bought the building and began restoring it, along with the rest of the Grand Pacific Junction. Changes made by Williams include the removal of the staircase on the south side of the building and the addition of six dormers on the roof, two more on the south side and four on the north side. Inside the hotel, there was an addition of another room, a changing of the configuration of the windows and doors, and an installation of a wooden bar in the rear of the building's interior. The renovations were completed in August 1992, and the building now served as a banquet room, especially for weddings.  Restoration  Clint Williams bought the Grand Pacific Junction in 1989. Williams saw a need to restore the Grand Pacific Junction, as the buildings were in very poor condition and falling apart. Williams had a history in restoration, as in 1978, he converted an old Shell Gas Station into his realtor business building. Williams saw this as an opportunity to revive the history that this junction once had. During the restoration, Williams added electrical, heat and air conditioning, and sewers in all of the buildings. In addition to this, multiple buildings had their windows redone, new dormers put in, and had their siding redone. The insides were all renovated, but still kept the old, historic look. Williams also had a gazebo built outside by the parking lot, overlooking the creek that runs along the backside of the Grand Pacific Junction. Right next to the gazebo, he had a 1922 Vulcan locomotive and a caboose put in a small segment of tracks. The train was then painted, commemorating the revitalizing of this part of Olmsted Falls. In the 24 months that it took to restore the junction, Clint Williams had put in 19 merchants into the buildings, and there were more to come in the years following the completion of the restoration.  Heritage Days  The heritage days fair and parade, occurring in early August, is an annual event that is put together by the city and its people. Established in 1992 by Clint Williams, the Heritage Days is a time that many in the town and in surrounding communities look forward to. The parade is the first thing that happens for this event, and circles the Grand Pacific Junction, where many of its viewers reside. After the parade, the main event is the fair that goes on for four days. Within the fair, there are food trucks and stands, crafts and activity stand for kids, and tables for adults to shop and look over the different businesses that surround the city. Along with this, there are beer and wine tastings, along with other things for adults to do. Throughout the three days, there are also performances for entertainment and also to inform the people watching of the history of Olmsted Falls and specifically the Grand Pacific Junction.  Buildings Present Day  Some of the more notable buildings that were restored have been and are currently being used for small businesses. The old jail house is now the Emerald Winds Honey Shoppe. Customers can go and enjoy fresh local honey and bee products. The depositors building is home to a new popular Italian restaurant called Matteo's. The old P. Simmerer's Flour and Feed shop is now Creekside Vintage antiques store, and their Hardware store is now Clementine's Tea Room. One of the more popular buildings, especially on warmer days, is the Falls Ice Cream shop. The shop was featured in the Cleveland Plain Dealer for having the best shakes.

It is the state's largest provider of services to children in crisis. Its services include providing homes to abused, abandoned, or neglected children. Sunrise is owned and operated by the Kentucky Baptist Convention. Sunrise has previously been known as Louisville Baptist Orphan's Home, Baptist Children's Homes, and Kentucky Baptist Homes for Children. Sunrise celebrates 150 years of service in 2020. Recently celebrating over 500 adoptions. Provides services to all 120 counties in Kentucky, from Paducah to Pikeville. Faith based mission serves over 1,000 kids and families a month. Smallest case loads, 24/7 support, online trainings and dedicated team to help you be successful as a foster parent. https://www.sunrise.org/ Work Sunrise Children's Services is a licensed behavioral health organization with locations in Danville, Dixon, Elizabethtown, Mayfield, Morehead, Bronston, and Mount Washington. The organization maintains a \\"covenant agreement\\" with the Kentucky Baptist Convention that requires, among other things, that the agency \\"shall maintain its distinctive Baptist character\\". Members of the organization's board of directors are selected by the Convention. In 2018, Sunrise officials estimated that the organization served approximately 1,200 people in all 120 Kentucky counties. As of 2018, Sunrise holds the highest levels of accreditation from The Joint Commission, the Better Business Bureau, and other professional organizations. Sunrise provides training and support to foster parents. The Kentucky Baptist Convention is waging initiatives to support Sunrise, including adopting foster care families in each of the Baptist churches. History = Early history = Sunrise Children's Services was founded as Louisville Baptist Orphan's Home in 1869 by a group of women at Walnut Street Baptist Church in Louisville, Kentucky. It would later be known as Baptist Children's Homes and Kentucky Baptist Homes for Children. Sunrise's purpose was to house and care for children orphaned as a result of the American Civil War and its aftermath. The original facility moved to a campus in Middletown, Kentucky, and was named Spring Meadows Children's Home. In the early 1900s, the Baptist Educational Society of Kentucky purchased the former Lynnland Military Institute (which closed in 1879) in Hardin County and opened the Glen Dale Children's Home on the property in 1915. The facility closed in 2009, and operations were moved to consolidate all of the agency's operations under one roof at a new location elsewhere in the county. In 1956, Pine Crest Children's Home opened in Morehead. In 1978, Sunrise secured a contract with the state of Kentucky to care for wards of the state. In 1980, Kentucky Baptist offered more counseling services, opened residential centers in Dixon and Morehead, and opened an emergency shelter in Elizabethtown. = Modern day = In March 2007, Sunrise adopted its present name, changing from Kentucky Baptist Homes for Children. The change occurred around the same time as other Baptist organizations - such as Guidestone Financial Services (formerly the Southern Baptist Annuity Board) and LifeWay Christian Resources (formerly the Baptist Sunday School Board) - were dropping the \\"Baptist\\" moniker from their names. In 2013, Sunrise's then-CEO Bill Smithwick proposed to the board of directors to lift the ban on hiring homosexual employees. Smithwick feared that the prohibition would eventually cost Sunrise its eligibility for state and federal funding, which Smithwick estimated to comprise approximately 85% of its $27 million budget. At the Kentucky Baptist Convention in November 2013, messengers adopted a motion of no confidence in Smithwick; many of the Convention's churches withheld financial support while the proposal was being considered, resulting in a $7.5 million shortfall in Sunrise's budget. The board of directors ultimately rejected the proposal, and Smithwick resigned in December 2013 after 16 years as CEO. Sunrise elected to close its Sunrise Children's Services Youth Support Center in London, Kentucky, on September 26, 2014, after 20 years in operation. The Youth Support Center had been operating at a financial loss; a state grant to Cumberland River Comprehensive Care allowed them to open a competing facility, making it unlikely that the Youth Support Center would be able to achieve financial viability. \\"Sunrise Children's Services - Aaron's Story\\", a short film by Mike Benton of Lexington-based Courage Media, won the \\"Short Format Program - Informational\\" award at the 2016 Ohio Valley Emmy Awards. The film chronicled the life of Aaron Green, who was a former foster child placed by Sunrise. On January 19, 2018, a fire destroyed the activities center on Sunrise's Woodlawn campus in Danville, Kentucky. In September 2018, home improvement retail chain Lowe's announced that it would donate $28,000 in materials and offer the volunteering time of about 50 local store employees to help rebuild the activity center and refurbish other properties on the campus, including the Gibson Cottage, which had remained uninhabited since the 1990s. In 2018, Clark County resident Judy Huls Singleton agreed to donate her farm to Sunrise, which planned to open the Solid Rock Children's Ranch on the property. Legal issues = Pedreira case = In 1998, Sunrise (then known as Kentucky Baptist Homes for Children) fired Alicia Pedreira after coworkers discovered pictures of Pereira and her lesbian partner on a website for the Kentucky State Fair. A spokeswoman for Sunrise explained that Sunrise \\"strive[s] to be fair in [its] dealings with all people, including, certainly, [its] employees. At the same time, it is important that [Sunrise] stay[s] true to [its] Christian values. Homosexuality is a lifestyle that would prohibit employment.\\" In response to the firing, five Sunrise employees resigned, and the social work programs from Spalding University and the University of Louisville withdrew their students from working with Sunrise. With the help of the American Civil Liberties Union and Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, Pedreira sued Sunrise and the state of Kentucky, claiming religious discrimination. In 2001, U.S. District Judge Charles Simpson dismissed the case, ruling that \\"While Baptist Homes seeks to employ only persons who adhere to a behavioral code consistent with its religious mission, the absence of religious requirements leaves their focus on behavior, not religion.\\" Opponents of President George W. Bush's then-recently announced White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives cited Simpson's decision as an example of potential negative consequences that could result from the government partnering with faith-based organizations. One aspect of the lawsuit that Judge Charles Simpson allowed to proceed claimed that Sunrise was using taxpayer funds to coerce children in its care into participating in religious practices. In 2015, near the end of his term, Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear reached an agreement with the ACLU and Americans United to settle the case. Under terms of the agreement, the state would \\"require providers to inform a child and the child's parents of a foster home's religious affiliation, to provide children with opportunities to go to the church of their choice, and to provide non-religious alternatives to religious activities. Providers must also agree not to discriminate against children on the basis of religion, coerce children to engage in religious activity or attempt to convert children to a new religion. Further, when children leave their care, providers must give them an exit survey that asks, among other things, whether the provider tried to convert the child to a new religion.\\" Both the ACLU and Americans United would have gained access to the agency's redacted records to ensure compliance. Sunrise was not party to the settlement and challenged some of its provisions to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals—where it won some modifications—and to the Supreme Court of the United States, which twice declined to hear the case. These challenges delayed the agreement becoming effective, and incoming governor Matt Bevin asked the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky that it be nullified completely. In 2018, Judge Charles Simpson sided with Bevin, saying that the state would have to rewrite its regulations to comply with the agreement, which would have been illegal under state law. = Danville ordinance = In 2014, the city of Danville, where Sunrise maintains its Woodlawn Campus, passed an ordinance prohibiting discrimination in housing, employment, and public accommodations based on sexual orientation or gender identity. After Sunrise said it would challenge the ordinance in court, the ordinance was amended to exempt \\"faith-based social services providers\\". Sunrise stated that if a court challenge was unsuccessful, it would no longer operate in the city.

It is hosted by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia (PIF). The first event was in October 2017 and featured the announcements of the launch of NEOM, a proposed $500bn independent economic zone in the northwest of Saudi Arabia. The second event was in 23-25 October 2018. The third event took place on 29-31 October 2019. Background The Future Investment Initiative was announced in September 2017 by the Public Investment Fund, Saudi Arabia's main sovereign wealth fund, in the context of the Saudi Vision 2030 program of economic and social reform. The first Future Investment Initiative event took place in Riyadh from October 24 to October 26, 2017, under the patronage of King Salman of Saudi Arabia. The conference hosted 3,800 attendees from 90 countries, involving major investors, chief executives, public officials, and economists. Notable participants included the managing director of the IMF Christine Lagarde, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, and Japanese business magnate Masayoshi Son, CEO of SoftBank. Themes discussed included artificial intelligence, big data, cryptocurrencies, and climate change. In an address to the conference, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman said Saudi Arabia was returning to a more moderate form of Islam “open to all religions and to the world”. The event was colloquially referred to by some media and commentators as \\"Davos in the Desert\\". The World Economic Forum, which organises the annual conference held in Davos, Switzerland, has objected to the use of \\"Davos\\" in such contexts for any event not organised by them.  Announcements  The Public Investment Fund announced several major plans at the conference, including its goal to increase its assets under management to $400 billion by 2020. The fund outlined how it would structure its investments in six areas: Saudi equity holdings, sector development, real estate and infrastructure, mega projects, international strategic investments, and a “diversified pool” across global asset classes. The Public Investment Fund also announced several major investments, including the finalisation of its participation in a $40 billion infrastructure fund set up with the US private equity firm Blackstone, and a memorandum of understanding to invest $1 billion in Virgin space companies. Among the projects announced at the conference was NEOM – a proposed $500bn economic zone covering 26,000 square kilometres in northwest Saudi Arabia, extending into Jordan and Egypt. The project aims to attract investment in sectors including renewable energy, biotechnology, robotics and advanced manufacturing. Further ‘giga projects’ presented at the 2017 event included Qiddiya, a multi-billion dollar entertainment resort; and the Red Sea project, a planned luxury resort across 50 islands on Saudi Arabia’s Red Sea coast. 2018 conference In May 2018 the Public Investment Fund announced plans for the second edition of the Future Investment Initiative, to be held from October 23 to 25, 2018. In August 2018 a team of business leaders were announced as members of a new FII advisory board, including Saudi businesswoman Lubna Olayan, MasterCard CEO Ajaypal Singh Banga, and the journalist and entrepreneur Arianna Huffington. Following the killing in Turkey of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018, some speakers and sponsors who had planned to attend the event withdrew pending the outcome of investigations. These included Los Angeles Times owner Patrick Soon-Shiong, the president of the World Bank Jim Yong Kim, and Viacom CEO Bob Bakish. Media outlets including The New York Times, the Financial Times, CNBC, Bloomberg, and CNN withdrew as partners. Google also issued a statement stating that Google Cloud Chief Executive Diane Greene would not be attending Future Investment Initiative Summit in Riyadh. Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said amid the concerns over Khashoggi disappearance, Uber would not be a part of the summit. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, The Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman, and US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin also withdrew from the conference.

Before entering politics, Meehan ran his family's paving business and was known as a local basketball star. Beginning as an insurgent within the city's Republican Party, he soon won the favor of party bosses and climbed the ranks of Philadelphia's Republican organization. Meehan served two terms as county sheriff from 1944 to 1952 and was recognized as the unofficial head of the Republican Party in Philadelphia in the 1950s. He remained an influential party member until his death in 1961. Early life Meehan was born in 1897 in Philadelphia, the son of John Meehan and Anna Waldron Meehan. Meehan's parents were Irish immigrants, and he grew up in North Philadelphia's 37th ward. In 1917, he married Jane McNulty, with whom he would later have four sons and four daughters. From the age of 14, Meehan worked for his father, a paving contractor with his own increasingly successful business. Meehan played on some of the early professional basketball teams around the city, including the Philadelphia 50 Club, St. Henry, and Shanahan. Local sports writers awarded Meehan the credit for Shanahan's defeat of the city's dominant team, the SPHAs, in 1925. After his basketball career ended, he became involved with charity work in Northeast Philadelphia, including sponsoring youth sports. Financial success from his contracting business gave him independence, and Meehan entered politics at an early age, often sparring with the Republican Party establishment in the city. Insurgent candidate In 1935, Democratic governor George H. Earle appointed Meehan to one of the Republican slots on the city's voter registration committee. Meehan immediately found himself at odds with the party organization, saying later that year that the \\"dead heads\\" in the party must be removed from power if they hoped to win the election that year. He soon broke with councilman Clarence K. Crossan, who had supported him for the job, and considered a run for sheriff or for Crossan's seat on city council. Meehan and Crossan later reconciled, but Meehan bucked the party by throwing his support to John B. Kelly Sr., the Democratic candidate for mayor. The 35th ward was the base of Meehan's political power.Kelly lost the 1935 election, and Meehan resigned his seat on the registration committee. Meehan never again backed a Democrat for office, but he remained a thorn in the side of the Republican party regulars. In 1937, he ran for city treasurer against the organization-backed candidate, David E. Watson (though with the backing of Republican Mayor Samuel Davis Wilson). Meehan lost by a two-to-one margin in the primary. After publicly toying with leaving the party, Meehan backed Watson and the rest of the Republican slate in the general election that November. Meehan, by this time elected the leader of the 35th Ward Republicans, continued his independent streak into the early 1940s. In 1941, he ran for the Republican nomination for city controller. Meehan represented the so-called \\"insurgent Republicans\\" against the party hierarchy, but he also had the support of United States Senator James J. Davis. He was unsuccessful again, losing to Alvin A. Swenson, but he tallied more votes than any of the other insurgents, with 73,135 to Swenson's 124,327. His growing popularity meant the organization could no longer treat Meehan as a mere nuisance. Sheriff In 1943, David W. Harris, the head of the Republican City Committee, approached Meehan about running for sheriff with the organization's backing. John M. Cummings of The Philadelphia Inquirer called the development \\"encouraging,\\" writing that Meehan's business acumen, community work, and civic-mindedness would make him a \\"tower of strength\\" on the November ballot. Meehan was unopposed in the primary and won easily in the general election that fall, defeating Democrat Elmer Kilroy by more than 40,000 votes. Although he had come to office as an outsider, allegations of insider corruption were made about Meehan. Similar accusations about the entire Republican organization led many independent voters to shift toward the opposition. The Democratic candidate for mayor, Richardson Dilworth, accused Meehan of controlling illegal gambling in Northeast Philadelphia, among other crimes. In response to his repeated accusations, Meehan challenged Dilworth to a televised debate. Meehan was later persuaded that it would be a mistake to debate Dilworth, a skilled trial lawyer, and backed out; but Dilworth went on without him, haranguing an empty chair instead. Meehan was, nonetheless, reelected in 1947 with a 100,000-vote majority. It would be the last election the Republicans would dominate in the city. Party boss =Decline of the Philadelphia Republicans= With the death of Thomas Sovereign Gates in 1948, the last of the \\"old Philadelphia\\" upper-class leadership of the Republican Party was gone. That left Meehan, William F. Meade, and Morton Witkin as the remaining powers in the party organization. Meehan's wealth gave him some advantage over the other two, but none of the three was strong enough to control the entire organization, and intra-party feuding was often the result—as was an increase in \\"indiscriminate graft,\\" according to author James Reichley. By this time, Meehan's contracting business was more successful, as well, as it received contracts for much of the city's street paving. Academy of Music was the site of Meehan and Dilworth's 1949 debate. In 1949, the Democrats, led by Dilworth and city controller candidate Joseph S. Clark Jr., mounted another campaign focused on corruption. Dilworth claimed that Meehan was bribed by the local utility companies, though he did not present any evidence of the charge. Meehan dismissed the two Democrats as \\"Dilly and Silly\\". He and Meade drew attention to the Americans for Democratic Action, a left-wing group that backed the Democratic ticket, which Meade said was \\"infiltrated with communists.\\" This time, Meehan and Dilworth did debate before a packed house at the Academy of Music, as well as over the air on radio and television. The debate soon turned to an exchange of insults, with the personal morals of both politicians being criticized. Unlike in 1947, the Democrats won all of the races on the ballot by 100,000-vote majorities. After the defeat, relations worsened between Meehan and Meade, leading to an open split by 1950. Dilworth and Clark ran again in 1951—this time for district attorney and mayor, respectively—and painted Meehan and his associates as irredeemably corrupt while endorsing the recently approved city charter. The campaign was successful and led reform-minded voters to abandon the Republican Party, resulting in sweeping losses in the 1951 mayoral and council races. The Democrats won nearly every election on the ballot in 1951, including sheriff. Meehan did not run for a third term. =Head of the party= The 1953 elections saw Meade and Meehan enter rival slates in the primaries, with Meade's faction coming out on top. Meehan backed the primary victors in the general election, and the result was a surprise victory in the city controller and register of wills offices that were on the ballot that year. After the election, Meade joined with the Hamilton brothers of Roxborough's 23rd ward to place William Hamilton Jr. at the head of the city committee. However, Meade and Meehan soon both tired of Hamilton, and replaced him with the newly elected register of wills, Robert C. Duffy. By 1954, they were again at odds over the distribution of federal patronage. The 1955 election saw a return to bad fortune for the Republicans as Dilworth succeeded Clark as mayor. The next year, Meehan backed David E. Watson—against whom he had run in the primary for city treasurer in 1937—for city committee chair; Watson defeated Duffy, who was Meade's choice for reelection. Watson died four months later, but Meehan's choice of Wilbur H. Hamilton prevailed. In 1957 Meehan, by then the predominant force in Philadelphia Republican politics, resigned as leader of the 35th ward and John F. Kane (Meehan's son-in-law) was elected in his place. In 1959, Meehan's choice for mayoral nominee, former Minnesota governor Harold Stassen, was selected in the primary, but he lost overwhelmingly to Dilworth. He was selected to head the Pennsylvania delegation to the 1960 Republican National Convention, but increasingly came under attack from independent Republicans who wanted a change from \\"bossism.\\" Death and legacy While speaking to the Northeast Lions Club in October 1961, Meehan suffered a heart attack. He was taken to Holy Redeemer Hospital, but died without regaining consciousness. 50,000 people turned out for his viewing before a funeral Mass at Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary Roman Catholic church in Lawndale. He was buried in Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Cheltenham. Meehan's memory would be revered among Philadelphia Republicans for years to come, and many would recall his mix of friendliness and political acumen. Austin Meehan Middle School in Northeast Philadelphia was named for him at the behest of his one- time rival, Richardson Dilworth. Meehan's son Billy followed in his father's footsteps to become the informal head of the party in Philadelphia.

Русский балетный театр от возникновения до середины XIX века. — Л.-М., 1958. She belonged to the pioneer group of professional stage artists in Russia. Biography She was from an orphanage in Moscow and trained as a ballet dancer by the imperial ballet master Leopold Paradise from Vienna, which was not an uncommon background for a Russian stage artist in this period. Leopold Paradise joined the Foster House in 1778, and in 1780 he released the first students of his ballet class - seven dancers and nine dancers, among whom was Arina Sobakina.Foster House Валерия Васильевна Носова. Балерины. Жизнь замечательных людей Arina Sobakina was sent to St. Petersburg to Karl Knipper Theatre. This theater was opened by Karl Knipper, the doctor of the Foster house. Since there were not enough artists in Russia yet, he signed a contract with the Foster House to supply it with its graduates of the stage classes. Arina Sobakina, having got to the Knipper Theatre, immediately became the main comic dancer on this stage. In 1782, Ivan Dmitrevsky joined the theater. He not only headed the staging works, but also conducted acting lessons. Arina Sobakina worked in the theater under his leadership. However, the theater experienced problems because of the extremely unsatisfactory attitude of the host to the cast. As a result, the Foster House stopped supplying young artists for the theater and soon the theater ceased to exist. On September 1, 1783, the freelance theater was included into the structure of the imperial theaters. Part of the troupe was sent to Moscow. In this last group, sent back to Moscow, was Arina Sobakina. By that time, a public theatre had also appeared in Moscow. In 1780 it was opened on Petrovka Street by Michael Medoks, an English businessman and engineer. It was named the Bolshoi Petrovsky Theatre (from which today's Bolshoi Theatre originated). Arina Sobakina also moved to the theatre. French and Italian artists worked there as choreographers and directors, but the ballet company was mainly composed of Russian artists, the graduates of the orphanage, where they were specially trained. The repertoire of the Moscow troupe was more liberal and was intended not only for the high-society public. It included many comic ballets and domestic genre scenes, close to the creativeness of Sobakina. In 1784-1785 she was one of the leading actresses of the Petrovsky Theatre. The main partner was Gavrila Raikov, her co-worker and another main actor in the ballet troupe of the Bolshoi Theatre.Самые Знамнитые Театры и Самые Знаменитые Режиссеры.

Background  Originally active as the Uganda Teachers Association (UTA), the Teachers' Association renamed itself the Uganda National Teachers' Union in March 2003 and thereby complied with the Trade Union Act of 1971. In 2006, these laws were updated with the Labor Unions Act. UNATU has been recognized as a charitable organization since 2006. With its 140,000 members, it is the largest and oldest teacher union in the country. One of the major tasks is collective bargaining and the attractiveness of the teaching profession. Uganda, once a pioneer in education policy within Africa, is now a developing country in the field of education. Low salary and a class size of 120 students makes the profession of being a teacher unattractive. Since its inception, the union has been calling for a 100% increase in pay, as well as benefits such as travel allowance, health insurance and pension increases. In 2011, the union called for a strike and was able to demand concessions from Yoweri Museveni in the upcoming elections, which were diluted again as a result. At the same time, however, the union itself was in the Kitik, as they view the spin-off Uganda Liberal Teachers Union (ULTU) selects members selectively and their structures are non-transparent.

After her father's death, the family decides to move to Fortaleza, where Freitas studied French, English, geography and arithmetics in a private school. Later she moves to the Normal School, becoming a teacher. In 1873 she began to write poems for several literary newspapers of Ceará and Pará like O Libertador, O Cearense and O lyrio e a brisa. Most of these poems were later compiled in the volume titled Canções do lar (1891). A year later, after her mother's death, she moved to Manaus with his brother, teaching at the Instituto Benjamin Constant for boys. In 1900, she married and returned to her home state with her husband, the journalist Antonio Vieira, editor of Jornal de Fortaleza. de Freitas participated actively in the Sociedade das Cearenses Libertadoras, an abolitionist society, having even spoken in 1893 in the gallery, a fact that was much applauded and reported in the newspapers.

The concept of gender may be used to initiate debate regarding gender stereotypes, gender equality or the reversal of genders within books. This term can be used as a synonym for gendered fiction. Gender novels also may be categorised not only under the genre of gendered fiction but crime, fantasy, and science-fiction. For a novel to be considered a gender novel, the plot, characters or context must somehow play with the concept of gender. This may be the inclusion of transgender or androgynous characters, the development of gender focused conflicts throughout the novel or a setting in which gender may or may not be a framework for societies to function. Usually gender novels are used to respond to contemporary issues within societies in regards to the perception of gender in the world. They can also be used to express sentiments or arguments relating to the disagreement regarding the concept of gender. Famous gender novels include Ursula Le Guin's Left Hand of Darkness, and Markus Zusak's The Book Thief. Many of these gender novels have been critically acclaimed for their groundbreaking theories surrounding gender roles. Gender novels, as a contemporary genre, has its foundations in the late 1940s. Later on in the 21st century, the works of Jeffrey Eugenides, Jeff Garvin and Jessica Herthel re-evaluated outdated gender-related theories and shed light on new post revisionist hypotheses.  Background  = History of gender in literature up until the 19th century = Philosopher and academic Voltaire in 1889. Gender in literature mostly reflected how gender was seen in society in that specific time period. That being said, it is important to understand how society saw the roles of men and women because it translated into the literature published during that time. Gender throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th century all over the world was very set in stone. Women were required to wear, act and behave a certain way both in public and in the private home. Life back then was extremely patriarchal, with opportunities, power and respect reserved for men only. Prior to the 17th century, men would play women's roles in old Shakespearean plays and musicals. Cross-gender acting is seen as evidence of the fact that women were not typically included or invited to participate in the arts, literature and musical theatrics. Throughout the 17th century, women played a significant role through primarily domestic activities such as taking on the responsibilities of being a chef, cleaner, counsellor, wife, mother and seamstress. Women were discouraged from expressing their opinion with things relating to politics, money and other contemporary issues. Due to their overall submissive role, most literature that was produced during this time was very patriarchal, and heavily featured men, their journeys and their achievements. The women who were educated and capable of writing were discouraged from pursuing their talent, as within society, it was seen as an inappropriate hobby for a women. The only way that women were able to publish their written work, was to write about submissive and inferior roles of females in society, as these were the writings in the 17th century that would be popular. Therefore, the more domestic role of women is reflected in their history, which was based mostly on their first and foremost duty to serve men. Absalom & Achitophel Poem written by Dryden. During the 18th century, women were still seen as the far more submissive sex; however, the beginning of the cultural revolution in Britain brought about changes to the roles of women. Women were now more frequently assisting their husbands in work, and even began having a better access to education. Despite this, women were still taught to behave in a certain way. Even throughout the cultural revolution, women were still victims of both economic and social discrimination. Their career choices were still restricted to marriage, motherhood, nursing or teaching. However, women's primary role was seen as being childbearers and wives. Literature however, still primarily focused on men, which still reflects this rigid construct of gender. Nevertheless, works such as John Dryden's prose Absalom and Achitophel have depicted an 18th- century perception of masculinity and the role of women, which can be thought of as one of the first important 'gendered texts' to exist. Despite the fact that the 19th century brought about romanticism in literature, it was still a period in time where women were oppressed, especially socially. Women weren't as valued as men, which is shown through the literature that was written by Mary Virginia, who was an American novelist during the 19th century. She wrote of the suppression of and inferior public attitude towards women, in which she says, that to a man, \\"women are ... valued according to the amount of hard usage she will endure\\". She follows this with the quote stating that women are to be \\"treasured in a windowed cabinet\\". Here, we get some of the first feminist writings, which reflect the gradual uprising against the patriarchy during the late 19th and early 20th century.  Gender novels in the 20th century  The 20th century was a significant time period of change and growth across the world, with movements such as feminism making their presence during the latter half of the century. This is reflected in the emergence of gender novels during this time period, one of the most important being Ursula Le Guin’s Left Hand of Darkness. These gender novels shed light on new concepts regarding the gender construct and revisioned new theories surrounding what gender actually means and how it impacts the human person. = The Left Hand of Darkness = A sign for The Left Hand of Darkness Play, evidencing the book's success.Another quintessential gender novel that was produced in the 20th century is Le Guin's text, Left Hand of Darkness, which was published in 1969. Her book deals with whether gender constructs are in fact what constitutes a human being. To highlight just how entrenched the construct of gender is within society, she bases her entire novel on a planet where gender does not exist and where the androgynous race live in harmony. She imagined a world whose inhabitants have no permanent gender: their sexual roles are determined by context and express themselves only once every month. Le Guin effectively uses her novel to express her thoughts on the role gender and sexual stereotypes play in the way one acts, behaves and responds. \\"He, after all, had no standards of manliness, of virility, to complicate his pride.” Le Guin's text focuses a lens on 1960s concerns and the concept of constructivism, which focuses on the idea that feminine attributes are created as a consequence of living in a patriarchal society. Her novel pictures this portrayal of a progressive gender construct where her depiction of the planet is a level playing field, equal for all peoples. This foundational novel was the first of its kind and one of the first texts to address the impacts of the construction of gender that have become entrenched throughout history, and throughout societies all over the world. It became the inspiration and springboard for many gender novels that were to come. Lee C. Bollinger awarding a Pulitzer Prize to Jeffrey Eugenides  Gender novels in the 21st century  The 21st century brought about a number of changes, including more social movements and many philosophical schools of thought. Postmodernism, narcissism and revisionism are just a few movements that dominated literature and philosophical writings during this period. The rise in technology use and social media were also factors that had a significant impact on some of these phenomenal gender novels. = Middlesex = One of the most famous gender novels that came out of this period was Jeffrey Eugenides's Pulitzer Prizewinning work, Middlesex. The novel details the story of Cal Stephanides, an intersex person growing up in the 1960s. Cal was diagnosed with 5 alpha- reductase deficiency syndrome, which means that his masculine hormones were suppressed in the womb. Cal, therefore, was born genetically as a male but raised by his female in Detroit, which highlights the importance of gender in the novel as the contradictions in relation to gender are definitely present throughout the novel. At different stages throughout the novel, Cal wears dresses and does his hair in a feminine way and then switches to more masculine suits. Gender is not seen as a static framework in Middlesex, which highlights Eugenides's perspective of gender itself; as a fluid and ever- changing societal construct. Due to the fact that it is one of the first texts ever to openly discuss people who suffer with genetic sex diseases such as with 5 alpha-reductase deficiency syndrome. Therefore, with over four million copies of it being sold worldwide, Middlesex has been one of the most successful and fundamental pieces of literature that is preoccupied with gender and its properties, but more importantly, discusses the link between gender, genetics and thus science. = The Symptoms of Being Human = Jeff Garvin's 2016 novel The Symptoms of Being Human is another fundamental text that can be considered a gender novel. The book tells the story of young Riley Cavanaugh, who is a 'gender fluid' adolescent who writes a blog about the struggles of being a teenager, such as bullying and anxiety. The story evolves around Riley's life and their decision to come out as gender fluid to the world. Again, this novel was one of the first of its kind, as its discussion and preoccupation with the concept of 'gender fluidity' had not been written about before. In an interview, Garvin states that his goal in writing the book was to emphasize how hard it is for gender-fluid people to live in this world, without constantly being reminded of this entire construct of gender. He added that: > It’s important to point out that [in real life], most gender fluid people > can’t avoid gendered pronouns—they’re everywhere... my point: language is a > powerful tool for shaping thoughts. So, if a nonbinary person asks you to > address them using a pronoun that seems unnatural or awkward to you, honor > their request! The awkwardness will pass, your friend will feel respected, > and you’ll have taken a significant step toward rewiring your brain and the > brains of those with whom you speak. This novel was a first in the representation of gender-fluid people, and was well received by critics and audiences alike.

Early life Gurnee was born on March 11, 1855 in Chicago, Illinois. He was the son of Mary (née Coe) Gurnee (1820–1893) and capitalist Walter Smith Gurnee (1813–1903), who served as Mayor Chicago from 1851 to 1853 and was the namesake of Gurnee, Illinois. Gurnee attended Harvard University and graduated with the class of 1878. Through his maternal uncle, Dr. Matthew Daniel Coe, he was a first cousin of Frantz Hunt Coe, the physician, public official and educator. Among his siblings was Delia E. Gurnee, Mary Evelyn Gurnee, Frances Medora Gurnee, Walter Scott Gurnee, Grace Gurnee, and Isabel Gurnee. In 1863, the family moved to New York where his father engaged in banking and other businesses, serving as the treasurer and director of the Shelby Iron Company, the American Smelting and Refining Company, and the American Surety Company, among others. Society life After graduating from Harvard, where he was a member of the Hasty Pudding Club, he briefly worked as a banker in New York. Gurnee was \\"free from the necessity of engaging in business\\" and, instead, spent his time \\"engrossed in the cultivation of the arts and spent much time in travel, living at intervals in Italy and France.\\" In 1892, Gurnee was included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. Personal life Gurnee had a home in Bar Harbor, Maine, Paris, and Nice, France. His home in Maine, known as Beaudesert, was originally designed by William Ralph Emerson in 1881, but was renovated for Gurnee in 1900 by architect Fred L. Savage, who also designed the nearby Breakwater, Reverie Cove, Raventhorp, and the Philler Cottage. In 1925, he donated his home in Nice, for the benefit of wounded soldiers, and a number of valuable works of art to the city of Paris, including twelve tapestries of Aubusson, Flanders, and Paris before the time of Gobelin. He was honored by France with the ribbon of the Chevalier of the Légion d’Honneur. Gurnee, who did not marry, died on July 6, 1926 in Baden- Baden, Germany, and was interred at the Gurnee Mausoleum at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery. In his will, Gurnee left many large bequeaths to charity, including the Presbyterian Hospital, St. Luke's Hospital, the Nursery and Child's Hospital, and the Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor, many trust funds for his relatives, and then left his residuary estate to Harvard.

Opened in 1887 by the Norcross Brothers construction firm, it supplied granite to a number of high-profile construction projects, including the Statue of Liberty and the Marshall Field and Company Building, and was in operation until 1980. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003, and is now owned by the town as a passive recreation area. Description and history The former Norcross Brothers Granite Quarry is located in a rural setting of eastern Branford, at the northern end of Quarry Road. The quarry is part of a larger parcel, where there is still ongoing quarrying. The historic quarry is a semicircular cut into a hillside on the west side of the property, between the north end of the public road and the active quarry. It has a stepped face, which extends about above the ground to the east, and is about wide. The lower reach of the quarry is filled with water, obscuring the depth from which stone was taken. Built features of the quarry include a wooden derrick near the upper lip, which was originally used as part of a hoisting mechanism. Foundational remnants of a stone-cutting shop are located nearer the road end, and the property is scattered with stone fragments and old tools. With The quarry was opened in 1887 by the Norcross Brothers, a construction firm based in Worcester, Massachusetts. Norcross was founded in 1864, and was by the end of the 19th century one of the nation's highest-profile construction firms. The company owned a number of stone quarries, from which materials were taken for building projects nationwide. Stone from this quarry is known to have been used in the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, DC, in the Howard-Tilton Memorial Library in New Orleans, and in the base of the Statue of Liberty. The quarry had a pronounced effect on the local economy and the town's demographics, bringing in a large number of immigrants into the formerly \\"Yankee\\" community. The quarry was sold by the Norcross Brothers in 1926, and operated intermittently until 1980.

A shallow marine sedimentary environment covered the region for much of the Paleozoic and Mesozoic, followed by dryland conditions, volcanism and the formation of the basin and range terrain in the Cenozoic. Utah is a state in the western United States. Geologic History, Stratigraphy & Tectonics The eastern Uinta Mountains near the Colorado line and the Raft River-Dover Creek Mountains contain the oldest rocks in Utah from more than two billion years ago. Rubidium-strontium dating of the Red Creek Quartzite in 1965 indicated an age of 2.3 billion years. Other geologists found 2.4 billion year old schist and gneiss in the Albion Range Green Creek Complex. Prior to the 1960s, geologists inferred the Vishnu and Farmington Canyon gneiss and schist as Archean in age, but subsequent research indicated an formation between 1.6 and 1.5 billion years ago in the Proterozoic. From 1.75 to 1.65 billion years ago, Utah was impacted by the Matzatzal Orogeny. Thick sequences of sedimentary rocks from the Neoproterozoic, including tillite underlie much of the state. =Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)= Utah has numerous rocks deposited during the Paleozoic, as multicellular life diversified for the first time. Basal Cambrian quartzite, up to thick, is sometimes difficult to distinguish from Precambrian rocks. A shallow marine environment produced mottled limestone and stromatalite beds, deepening to the west. Thin shale and siltstone units of the Whirlwind Formation likely originated from sediment sources in the east. The Pioche Shale contains some of the oldest Cambrian fossils, followed by a continuous sequence of trilobite fossils in the House Range. In eastern Utah, which rests on the craton of the proto-North American continent Laurentia, there are no Ordovician deposits, but Early Ordovician clastic limestone, Middle Ordovician quartz sandstone and Late Ordovician dolomite is common in the west. Geologists have found intraformational limestone from the Early Ordovician, formed as limestone forming in a tidal bed is redeposited as pebbles in situ. Brachiopod, trilobite and echinoderm fossils are common in these rocks. Middle Ordovician quartzites form distinctive orange, brown and pink cliffs above gray limestone slopes, set beneath black dolomite cliffs in the north and west. Chert rich dolomite cliffs form in the most widespread Ordovician unit: the Fish Haven-Ely Springs Dolomite. Only a single stratigraphic unit—the Laketown Dolomite—formed during the Silurian, far from sediment sources in a carbonate platform environment, with few distinct fossil assemblages. Although thickest in the west, Devonian strata are present in the east unlike Ordovician and Silurian rocks. A local orogeny produced the Stansbury Uplift, leading to downward erosion into older rock units dating to the Precambrian and the deposition of the coarse conglomerate Stansbury Formation. Shale and quartz sandstone are often interbedded with carbonates as in the Hanauer Formation in the Thomas-Dugway Range. In the Mississippian, up to of sediment accumulated in the Oquirrh Basin. Marine deposition was continuous, with numerous fossils in an unbroken record, such as the crinoid stems, brachiopods and corals in the Chainman-Manning Canyon shale. Silicified brachiopod and coral fossils mark the Redwall, Leadville, Madison, Gardison, Joana and Lodgepole limestones and only the northwest lacks extensive limestone formations. Geologists focused significant attention on the Pennsylvanian rocks of the Paradox Formation in the Paradox Basin after the discovery of oil, potash and rock salt. The basin took shape as part of the Uncompahgre Uplift, produced by the uplift of the ancestral Rocky Mountains. Several thousand feet of salt accumulated beneath arkose shed off the mountains. Up to 13,000 feet of sedimentary rocks accumulated in the Oquirrh Basin. A small unconformity separates these rocks from those formed in the Permian. These rocks tend to be difficult to correlate, with significant lateral variation, cross-bedded sandstones indicating wing transportation and a lack of late Permian rocks. A major marine transgression generated the Kaibab Limestone (the rimrock of the Grand Canyon), represented by the Park City and Phosphoria groups in Utah. =Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)= In the early Mesozoic, one final marine deposit formed in western Utah during the Triassic—the Thaynes Limestone—before the region was uplifted. The early Triassic Moenkopi Formation is a mudstone with thin layers of limestone formed as the sea spread out across mud flats and hosts the Canyonlands in southern Utah. From east to west, mudstone grades into limestone. The Navajo, Wingate and Kayenta sandstones are distinguished by the cross-bedding of the Kayenta Sandstone across the Colorado Plateau, which tends to be more characteristic of a stream environment than the sand dune deposits that make up the Wingate Sandstone. The Navaja Sandstone began to form in the late Triassic, but is mainly a Jurassic formation, including the formations in Zion National Park. Other important Jurassic units include the Entrada Sandstone, which hosts Arches National Park and the Morrison Formation, with notable fossils preserved at Dinosaur National Monument. The thickest Jurassic sediments are between Devil's Slide, east of Ogden, and Marysvale, which include gypsum and other evaporites, mined from the Arapien Shale. The Sevier orogeny to the west shed gravel and other sediments into the Morrison Formation. The formation was entirely continental in origin, recording shallow lakes, shifting streams and volcanic ash. A shallow seaway formed in the Middle Jurassic, leaving behind the fossil-bearing Carmel and Twin Creek formations. For the last time, Utah was covered by shallow seas in the Cretaceous and with the continued uplift of the Sevier orogeny leading to erosion, deposits from the time are double the thickness of Jurassic units. The Kelvin and Lower Indianola formations indicate continuous sand and gravel deposition in streams along the foothills of the mountains, while both the Burro Canyon and Cedar Mountain formations (which are rich in fossils) point to floodplain deposits similar to those in the underlying Morrison Formation. Near the Wyoming line, the Dakota Sandstone is overlain by the Aspen-Mowry Shale. In the Wasatch Plateau, the Ferron sandstone represents a brief marine regression to the east and serves as an important natural gas horizon. The Emery and Mesaverde sandstone indicate similar regressions (the Mesaverde marks the last one in the late Cretaceous). Coals formed in units such as the Straight Cliffs Formation. =Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)= In the Cenozoic, the Laramide orogeny uplifted the Rocky Mountains. Near Flaming Gorge, the Paleocene Fort Union Formation angularly overlies the Cretaceous Ericson Sandstone while on the south slope of Uintas Mountain, the Wasatch Formation overlies the Cretaceous Mesaverde Sandstone. The Wasatch Conglomerate formed as the coarsest debris accumulated in basins near the uplifted areas, with sediments growing finer further east and reaching up to 13,000 feet thick through the Eocene in the Uinta Basin. Large lakes played an important role as well. Paleocene Lake Flagstaff left algal limestone in the Southern Wasatch Mountains, along with marl-mudstone in Bryce Canyon, Cedar Breaks and Richfield. Eocene Lake Green River deposits do not extend as far south, but include an important oil shale resource. Erosion wore down the Uinta Mountains enough that the Duchesne River Formation covered over earlier Cenozoic basin fill. An abrupt shift to volcanic activity in the Needle Range and at Marysvale, Crystal Peak, Tintic and Bingham took place in the Oligocene, erupt thick ash flow tuff and produced welded ignimbrite. The Needle Range ash flow tuff is the most extensive, covering 13,000 square miles in southwest Utah and eastern Nevada. While most tuffs are rhyolite, the Needles Range tuff includes amphibolite, biotite and plagioclase phenocrysts. Volcanism was related to the subducting Farallon Plate and took place from 35 to 19 million years ago, predating the block faulting of the Basin and Range Province making tuff useful for stratigraphic comparisons. Several unusual laccolith intrusions formed including the Henry, La Sal, Abajo and Three Peaks mountains. Volcanic activity lessened from 19 to 16 million years ago, followed by basalt flows, cinder cones and the Topaz-Spor Mountain rhyolite into the Miocene, Pliocene and Quaternary. During this time and continuing to the present, block faulting created the basin and range terrain in western Utah and Nevada. Lake Bonneville formed during the Quaternary, covering 20,000 square miles. The Great Salt Lake is the remnant of the deepest part of the lake, where the depth was once as much as . During the Pleistocene, glaciers formed in the mountains and in the case of the Temple Lake Stade and Gannett Peak Stade, advanced 4,000 years ago in the Holocene. Natural resource geology In the 1800s, coal extraction at Coalville was used to supply the Salt Lake Valley, Cedar City and iron mines, with a shift to Carbon County in the 1900s.

The region was submerged for much of the Paleozoic and Mesozoic and formed extensive oil and gas reserves due to tectonic activity in the Arctic Ocean. Alaska was largely ice free during the Pleistocene, allowing humans to migrate into the Americas. Geologic History, Stratigraphy & Tectonics Compared with other areas of the North American continent, Alaska formed in the recent geologic past. Until 200 million years ago, western North America terminated at the Rocky Mountains, 120 miles further inland than the current shoreline, until the addition of the Yukon- Tanana Terrane. The Birch Creek Schist is the oldest rock in Alaska's interior and forms the core of the Yukon-Tanana Terrane with muscovite-quartz schist, mica quartzite and graphite schist. This intensely folded and rock unit extends from Fairbanks into the Yukon Territory in Canada and formed between 800 and 600 million years ago in the Proterozoic, due to the metamorphism of shale, sandstone and mudstone along the western margin of the continent. A different schist belt may underlie the Brooks Range and is known from deep boreholes in the vicinity of Prudhoe Bay, reaching greenschist and blueschist on the sequence of metamorphic facies. Precambrian metasedimentary gneiss is found in the Kigluaik Mountains on the Seward Peninsula, while in southeast Alaska, additional Precambrian rocks underlie Prince of Wales Island. =Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)= Throughout the Paleozoic, a marine shelf environment dominated the western edge of the proto-North American continent Laurentia, becoming deeper over time and experiencing widespread volcanism over 5000 square kilometers, as well as the deposition of carbonates, mudstone and sandstone. Volcanic rocks remain in the Keevy Peak Formation in the Northern Alaska Range and metamorphosed into the Totatlanika Schist in the interior, as well as in the Alexander terrane in the southeast. =Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)= In the Mesozoic, North America separated from the supercontinent Pangea which had formed in the late Paleozoic. Oceanic plates in the Pacific Ocean subducted in trenches offshore, carrying volatiles such as water and carbon dioxide with them, leading to rock melting and volcanic activity. Intense volcanism built up Alaska's mountains until a slowing of eruptions in the late Cretaceous around 80 million years ago. During the Middle Triassic three large terranes—Wrangellia, Alexander and Stikine—remained offshore as separate island arcs not yet joined to the continent. The Wrangellia and Alexander terranes merged offshore by the Middle Jurassic and experienced folding and faulting during a collision with Alaska in the Cretaceous. The addition of the terranes generated metamorphism and led to the intrusion of huge amounts of granite in the Coastal Ranges. By the end of the Cretaceous, a fourth landmass—the Chugach terrane—docked with Alaska. Geologists have interpreted the Alexander terrane as a volcanic island chain surrounded by coral atolls, given volcanic rocks, chert and limestone from the Paleozoic. Rocks in Glacier Bay and the Heceta-Tuxekan Islands to the west of Prince of Wales Island preserve clam shells and reef life. In many locations, Alexander terrane limestone rests on top of conglomerate made up of beach boulders. Volcanic rocks, carbonates and phyllite overlie these lower rock units, intruded by Jurassic igneous rocks. Many sections of the terrane are highly metamorphosed and broken into smaller blocks by faults, such as the Chatham Strait Fault, which offsets rocks up to 120 miles. The Stikine terrane includes Paleozoic volcanic rocks interbedded with marine shale, limestone and sandstone, overlain by Jurassic and Cretaceous sedimentary and igneous rocks. Thrust faults and the Chatham Strait Fault separate the small Taku terrane from neighboring terranes. It is marked by metamorphosed andesite, rhyolite and basalt with small amounts of limestone, marble and conglomerate. On top of the Coast Range batholith are remnant metamorphic rocks from the gneiss, schist and marble dominant Tracy Arm terrane. The Wrangellia terrane, as one of the largest in Alaska formed beginning 300 million years ago in the Pennsylvanian and built up with basalt, carbonate and phyllite during the Triassic (these rocks are exposed from the Alaska Range to the Wrangell Mountains). Originating as a volcanic island arc, Wrangellia exhausted its magma supply and began to sink, although renewed volcanism built up basalt and the Nikolai greenstone above the water level, until the new land sank again covered over by limestone and deep water sediments. The Chugach terrane, by contrast, is made up of turbidite deposits from the Mesozoic, along with conglomerate, shale and volcanic rocks. During the Cretaceous, tectonic activity in the Arctic Ocean created a series of sediment filled basins, which now host oil and gas deposits, underlying the continental shelf of northern Alaska. Organic-rich shale overlies a major unconformity in the area, acting as the source rock for hydrocarbons. Plate rotation produced the Brooks Range with a plate collision visible at the surface in the Kobuk River. Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks separated from the descending slab, leaving mineral deposits in the Brook Range related to older rock units. =Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)= The Talkeetna Mountains north of Anchorage preserve granite formed from igneous activity during the Cenozoic accretion of the Chugach terrane. During the Eocene, the Prince William terrane was joined to Alaska. The Eocene brought a change in the motion of the Pacific Plate, marked by the chain of volcanoes in the Emperor Seamount and Hawaiian Islands. The small Kula plate, which was being overridden by the Eurasian and North American plates in the Mesozoic, became \\"jammed\\" in place, creating the Bering Sea shelf. The St. George and Navarin extensional basins formed in the Bering Strait and filled with sediments. For much of the Cenozoic, Alaska experienced very cold conditions, preserved by fossils in the 5000 foot thick terrestrial sediments of the Chickaloon Formation in the Cook Inlet. By 10 to 13 million years ago, mountain glaciers had formed. A steady supply of moisture from the Pacific Ocean supported coastal glaciers beginning five million years ago, recorded by the glacial mudstone of the Yakataga Formation along the Gulf of Alaska. During the Pleistocene, the interior of Alaska remained ice free, except for the Yukon-Tanana Upland west of Fairbanks, which experienced six phases of glaciation (the western Alaska Range experienced the same number, while the Brooks Range experienced four). North of the Brooks Range, a polar desert developed with windblown sand dunes. Mammoth steppe allowed humans to cross into North America from Siberia. A return to cold conditions 3000 years ago in the Holocene brought major glacial advances in Glacier Bay and Icy Strait, reaching new maximums by 1750 before going into retreat. Currently, Alaska is experiencing an ongoing terrane collision, with the uplift of the Saint Elias Mountains by the Yakutat block, volcanism and deep granite formation.

A layer of mineral dust blowing north from the Sahara met cold, wet air over the British Isles, resulting in thick, dense clouds and severe thunderstorms across most of England and Wales. These clouds completely blotted out the light in some areas and the rain and hail resulted in property damage and flooding, and at least four people were killed. During the storm, Leeming Bar in North Yorkshire saw of rain in under 10 minutes – a UK record until 2003. Meteorology The Hoggar Mountains in Algeria saw a number of severe thunderstorms on 26–27 June. These appear to have blown a large quantity of Sahara dust into the atmosphere, where it was caught in a southerly wind in an atmospheric layer between and in altitude, forming a classic Spanish plume. Unusually, no clouds formed as this dust blew over continental Europe, and the layer reached England on 30 June largely unrained out. The warm desert air brought a heatwave over Southern England, with temperatures in London on 1 July measured at , until it met the much cooler, moister Atlantic airstream. The boundary between the two formed a squall line stretching from Devon, along the England–Wales border and up across Northern England to the River Tees. Thick clouds, darkened by the Sahara dust, rose to , plunging areas along the squall line into total darkness. In some areas, the lightning continued for 24 hours, and ball lightning was seen at RAF Chivenor in Devon. The dust particles served as seeds for nucleation, causing water to rapidly precipitate out and form especially large raindrops and hailstones. The thunderstorms resulted in one of the most widespread intense hail falls ever recorded in the UK, with hail events in 9 separate places reported as \\"severe\\" (H3) or greater on the TORRO hail scale, and the strongest rated \\"destructive\\" (H6). Hailstones across – the size of a tennis ball – were measured at Cardiff Airport, and the local newspaper for Hartland, Devon, reported the finding of \\"a piece of ice long\\". Along with the hail came heavy rain, with the 9 minute fall at Leeming Bar setting a record for a sub-10-minute total. The Isle of Man measured of rain over the 48 hour time period associated with the storms. Areas south and east of the squall line saw less severe storms, but the rain that fell in the night of 1–2 July 1968 was rich in Saharan dust, turning it blood red and leaving dusty deposits on the surfaces it fell on – only the south coast and uplands of Wales avoided the red rain. The last comparable storm associated with Saharan dust was seen in October 1755. Aftermath The storms resulted in at least four fatalities. Three people were struck by lightning – a 72-year-old woman in Northallerton, a 14-year-old girl in Oldham, and an unnamed woman in Hampsthwaite – while an 80-year-old man drowned in flooding in Welshpool. Hail broke windows and dented cars across a wide swathe of the country, and damage was reported at both Cardiff Airport and RAF Chivenor. At Yeadon, West Yorkshire, the accumulated hail piled deep, and in parts of Yorkshire the ice was so severe that roads had to be cleared with bulldozers. Bradford saw severe flooding on 2 July, with many streets in the centre left underwater, as did the Isle of Man. The Met Office noted that many rivers across the West Country and the Midlands burst their banks, and said that every town and village in Devon was flooded, with damage to property and crops assessed as \\"a major disaster\\". The summer of 1968 would prove to be one of the worst ever recorded for flooding in the UK, with further storms causing the Chew Stoke flood of 1968 just a week later and the Great Flood of 1968 that September, and would not be equalled until the 2007 floods. In the wake of the storm, a number of normally rare African and Southern European insects were reported across England, having been blown across with the Sahara dust.

Copyright: All rights reserved by SkinnyPop Popcorn. SkinnyPop is a snack brand that manufactures and sells popcorn products. The company is owned by Hershey Co., headquartered in Austin, Texas and sells internationally.  History  SkinnyPop was founded in Skokie, Illinois by Andy Friedman and Pam Netzky, with investors Jeffrey and Michael Eiserman. Friedman and Netzky first entered the popcorn business in 2007 when they launched Wells Street Popcorn, which they sold in grocery stores and theaters near Chicago. In 2010, Friedman and Netzky developed a new popcorn recipe and launched a separate brand from Wells Street, which they named SkinnyPop Popcorn. The first thousand bags of SkinnyPop were hand-produced by the company's founders and sold locally in Chicago stores. In October 2010, SkinnyPop signed with a distributor. Due to time constraints from managing two brands, Friedman and Netzky franchised Wells Street Popcorn to Netzky’s cousin at the end of 2010. By 2012, SkinnyPop was being manufactured in Chicago and distributed to 4,500 retail stores. In early 2013, the company partnered with a food industry entrepreneur Jason Cohen to grow sales and distribution. That year, SkinnyPop recorded $44 million in sales. By August 2014, SkinnyPop was being sold in 25,000 retail stores in the United States as well as internationally. That same year, Friedman and Netzky sold their majority stake in the company to TA Associates for $320 million. TA Associates hired Tom Ennis, former president of Oberto Brands, to be the company’s CEO and reincorporated SkinnyPop as Amplify Snack Brands. = Initial public offering and sale to Hershey = Amplify Snack Brands went public in 2015 with an initial public offering of $18 per share. That year, the company’s sales were $176.9 million. Amplify shares hit a low in January 2016. They recovered later that year, but did not reach the initial IPO. In 2016, sales grew to $326.9 million. In December 2017, Hershey Co. purchased Amplify Snack Brands for $1.6 billion at $12 a share.  Products  SkinnyPop’s original pre-popped popcorn was launched in 2010 and was made with sunflower oil and salt. Different flavors were later introduced. The company released a microwave popcorn product in 2017. Its other products have included popcorn puffs and cakes.

The first urban settlements in the Caucasus  The highway has partially cut down the current highway from Aghdam to Agjabadi. The western part of the hill is now cemetery. In 1954, this hill attracted the attention of many Azerbaijani and Russian scholars. The most interesting thing is that this hill is not artificially created as a mound. That is, it is a natural hill. On the other hand, many material and cultural remains of 3-4 thousand years ago have been collected by the traveler in the destroyed part of this natural hill. Of course, it is the fate of this mysterious hill, the most thoughtful of scholars, how the find could fall to the middle of the hill and how many other fossils would be found on the hill. Among the scholars there were also controversial. Some claim that he was a cemetery from the earliest times, while others claimed to be a hilltop. In order to put an end to all these disputes, St. Petersburg scientist A.A. Gessen suggested to do excavation on the hill. One of the reasons for excavation was that in the 1950s, the Bronze Age settlements in Karabakh had not been studied. Therefore, the nature of the settlements 3-4 thousand years ago, their habitation, the structure of their homes, the type of building materials, etc. The study of such monuments was of great importance for learning. Only living places could help to learn the level of material and spiritual life of the population. The only ancient settlement in the archeological excavation of the Millard is Uzerliktapa. This monument is located in a geographically favourable position in the east from the city of Aghdam. The residence has an oval plan which is incorrect. Its widest range from north to south is 202 m. Archaeological excavations were carried out on 484 m2 area. The thickness of the cultural layer on the natural hill is 3 m. During the archeological excavations, 3 construction layers were discovered. The first construction layer is characterised by the presence of various types of workshops. Some of them are full of kitchenware and ash. It has been used to store animals from straw piles. Remains of this building have been found on this layer. Its walls are woven from thick sticks and dipped into clay. The roof of the building is covered with wooden shells, and the ground floor is covered with a mat. Clay bottles on the floor, clay stoves were found inside the scattered hearth. Frosted metal alloy was found inside the clay bush found in the oven. Teas, lugs and stone molds from tea stones were obtained near the quarry. This house was painted by K. Kushnareva as a \\"cast house\\". Clay items found in this layer are divided into two groups, kitchen and household utensils. Ceramic products are cooked in gray or black color. Household appliances are thoroughly polished. The boards are designed with various motifs of gray ornaments. The thickness of the middle layer selected by rich oak residues, economic wells and rich archeological materials is 1.5 m. The ruins of the magnificent protective wall, which depicts the entire habitat, have been discovered on this layer. The wall of the protective wall is 35 m in length and 3 m in width and 1 m in height. One of its entrance doors is reinforced with counterfeit. Remnants of ground-based and wood-covered houses were found on the inside of the defensive wall. During this period, the place of residence was exposed to a double fire. As a result of the collapse of the houses and the accumulation of the cultural layer, the defense wall has lost its significance and has been calibrated. The third building period was located on the wall of the defense. In spite of the fact that it was extremely bad, the ground floor and the household items kept on them were found on this layer. Ceramics of the second and third classes were accepted by K. Kushnaryeva as a single complex. During this period, there was considerable progress in the production of clay products. The sculptural ornament used in the substrate was replaced by a more perfect ornament. During this period, painted containers, which are completely different from the black colored ceramics of Oterliktepe, appear. K. Kushnaryeva links the formation of the painted containers with the progress made in the development of pottery. Monochrome painted dishes, differing from the black polished ceramic, reflect the effect of another culture and will be further explained below. At the moment, it can be said that this culture can be considered as evidence of the progress of the painted vessels to the north of the Nakhchivan-Urmia Basin. Very few (2%) of the painted containers inside the clay products confirm that this is the case. Karabakh’s cult Architecture The protection of the inhabitants of the Uzerliktapa In 1954 archeological excavations began in Uzeriktapa. As a result of the excavations, it was discovered that at about 6-7 m, the Uzerliktapa was approximately 3.5 m high at the end of the 2nd millennium BC. At that time local residents had settled down on the Upper East. It is interesting that, as in all of Azerbaijan, the ancient inhabitants of Karabakh used mainly the tall hills when selecting their dwelling places during the tribal period. This is only a military objective. During the tribal battles with harsh methods, the hills were able to see the enemy forces faster and to prepare emergency response measures. On the other hand, a deep trench was dug around the hill that had a compact area. These trenchers played a role in the danger. Sometimes, they filled the trench with water, turning the hill into a kind of island. The fortress was one of the most fortified settlements in the surrounding wall. In fact, the Uzerliktepe settlement, which had collapsed during the period of the primitive community and where property inequality occurred, was one of the rare monuments reflecting the city culture. As a result of the excavations it has been discovered that Uzerliktapa has been inhabited for many centuries, and as a result of this habitat, a three-meter-long cultural layer has emerged. Archaeological observations of the cultural layer revealed that the habitation period Uzerliktapa was continued 2000 year. One of the main heritages that attracted attention during excavations was the remains of a large volume of bricks. It is known that this wall surrounded the upper part of the hill roundly. Scholars have rightly ruled that this wall is a defensive fortress. Thus, the residents of the Upper East, apparently, took every effort to protect themselves from enemy attacks. The ruins of the semi-permanent dwelling houses, the hearths, the trench used for various purposes, the farming tools, clay trays and clay figures were found inside that fortress wall. Residential houses in Uzerliktapa are mainly built of bricks. The floor of the houses is smoothly watered with clay. Each house has cobblestone holes. In addition, many holes were built inside the dwellings, and sometimes in the yard. According to researchers, these pits, which are of different sizes, are often used to store food and, in a few cases, for the garbage cans. Agriculture A number of remnants of the ancient culture of the ancient inhabitants of Karabakh have been discovered. Many of the hollows and houseplants, as well as wheat and barley remains were found in clay vessels. After laboratory analysis it became clear that the remains of this wheat were cultivated 4-5 thousand years ago by cultivation. In addition, wheat and barley were grown together in most cases. It also proves that the stone tool used in the harvesting of the planted grain was found. The stone sickle cuts the smaller stones and equips them to the jawbone of the large horned beetle. One side of stone pieces that are considered to be teeth of the field is stinging with stone. Stone tools in the life of the inhabitants of the Far East have taken a major place. Here, stone-made arrows, stone blades, many pagan battles, and grasshoppers were discovered. In addition, stones from scarves, scales, ornaments or breasts, playing roles, etc. It has been established that all these 3-4 thousand years ago still show that stone tools play a major role in the lives of indigenous people. The sting was also plucked by stones. To do so, they took a piece of solid rock and thinned one end of it. The stomach of the stone is well-suited to the tree. These tissues were found in Rasultapa, another settlement near Aghdam. One of the great finds is the remains of grape seeds, which proves that gardening has an ancient history in that area. The role of bone instruments in the lives of the ancient residents has also been minimal. They made needles for knitting machines and needles for sewing. The same items are made of bronze made of copper and copper. Acquired weapons, knives and so on. it is also from the bronze. As a result of the excavations conducted in Uzerliktapa, ancient inhabitants of Karabakh were known 4.5 thousand years ago for the mystery of solid metal, 3 thousand years before the mystery of iron production. A travel to ancient Karabakh. R. Goyushov. 1993 Craftsmanship and livestock farming Beside agriculture, livestock has also taken a major place. Imagination about the illness and its species creates numerous animal bones found in that monument. As a result of laboratory analyses carried out by our scientists, the affinity of the Beetle's identified animal bones has been fully understood. Only 464 units of bull bones, 285 sheep and goat bones, 40 parts of horse bones, 104 pork bones and 6 part dogs were discovered here. As a result of the surveys, residents of the Upper Cretaceous used 15 seasonal forms of migration. They had developed livestock breeding in the summer, moving to the mountains in the summer and moving to the winter in order to provide the animals with pastures. Other archaeological finds show that domestic craftsmanship, along with farming and cattle, is also evolving. Weaving, painting, pottery and metalworking have become more popular in home art. Along with these, the ancient inhabitants of the Far East achieved significant successes in the development of fine arts items. Bracelets, earrings, various beads, breasts, etc., made of metal, bone, agate and pasta. are currently the best exhibits of our museums. During the excavations in 1965, a pelican was found in Uzerliktapa, a \\"moving pitcher\\", that is, made of clay and able to move from one place to another. Clay containers are particularly clustered in the remains of material culture discovered here. It is interesting that, unlike clay vessels found in Khojaly cemetery, the dishes of the residents of the Uzerliktapa are quite diverse. From here you can see a carpenter, a helmet, a teddy bear, a river, different sized boxes and so on. more detected. However, the biggest progress was that they were already aware of the secrets of colouring the plants, and painted many of the 14 clays they used in the household. For this purpose, they mainly used two colors - black and red. Religious ideology in the Uzerliktapa Another discovery discovered in science is extremely interesting from the scientific point of view and is of great importance for the study of the religious ideology of the residents. This finding is female. The idol found in the stonework made of stone in the upper layer proves that idolatry has spread among the local population. This religious belief, which was generally observed in the territory of Azerbaijan during the Eneolithic period, later developed a dominant role in the ancient times. During this period, the majority of female idols have come from the idea that the mother is a symbol of heresy or the origin of life. Reasons for the abandonment Archaeologists have discovered that the settlement was cut at the end of the first millennium BC. How did it happen that people left this hill where they lived for centuries? It is known that life in Durartapa was cut after a powerful fire there. Archaeologists have said that the burnt remains of the burnt utensils, the thick ash layer formed of that fire, had come to the fore. The cause of this fire is that researchers see the result of external attacks. Thus, at the end of the first millennium BC, the history of the Ottoman Empire was abolished. Despite being destroyed by fire, the material cultural remains found among its ashes, allowing the ancient inhabitants of Karabakh to have a great culture, a thorough economic field and an ideological view of their own time, as well as in Azerbaijan and in all Transcaucasia one of the richest monuments. Uzerliktapa Aghdam is Karabakh's heart.

Murray (died 2006) was a Scottish trade unionist. He became the leader of his union and organised its merger into the GMB, but his time in office was overshadowed by allegations of vote-rigging which were later withdrawn. Born in Glasgow, Murray completed an apprenticeship as a boilermaker with Babcock & Wilcox. During World War II, he served in the Royal Navy as an engine room artificer. After the war, he returned to the Clyde, spending time in engineering and shipbuilding before returning to boilermaking and joining the United Society of Boilermakers (USB). Murray became increasingly active in the USB, initially as a lay official, then from 1962 as a full-time district delegate. He was also elected to the union's executive committee, and spent a period as its chair. In 1980, Murray stood to become general secretary of the union, by then known as the Amalgamated Society of Boilermakers, Shipwrights, Blacksmiths and Structural Workers. He topped the first poll, then beat leading communist Barry Williams 1,831 to 1,435 in a run-off. He took up office and was also elected to the General Council of the Trades Union Congress, but Williams took legal action, claiming that the election had been rigged, and he should be declared the winner. The union's executive investigated, and discovered that some ballots, marked for both candidates, had been forged. As a result, it suspended Murray, appointing Sandy Scott as acting general secretary, while the run-off was held again. On a re-vote, Murray again won election, this time beating Williams by 2,349 votes to 1,970. Williams again took legal action, but a further executive investigation found no issues, and Murray took up the post in October. He completed merger negotiations with the General and Municipal Workers' Union, and in December the USB became part of the General, Municipal, Boilermakers and Allied Trades Union (GMBATU). Murray was appointed as the secretary of the GMBATU's new boilermakers' section. Williams finally withdrew his legal action in February 1984, despite which he never believed he had lost to Murray. Murray, having found the situation stressful, retired at the end of the year. He died in 2006.

The Sonoma orogeny uplifted the ancestral Rocky Mountains in parallel with the diversification of multicellular life. Shallow seas covered the regions, followed by the uplift current Rocky Mountains and intense volcanic activity. Colorado has thick sedimentary sequences with oil, gas and coal deposits, as well as base metals and other minerals. Stratigraphy, Tectonics & Geologic History In the early Proterozoic, between 1.78 and 1.65 billion years ago, the continental crust of Colorado was assembled from several older island arcs, along the coast of the Archean Wyoming Craton. The Colorado Province took shape as a mobile belt—an area of thinner, orogeny related continental crust lacking the deep \\"keel\\" of rock, which stabilized the neighboring Wyoming Craton and other cratons like it. Throughout Colorado's geologic history, rocks have often been deformed, metamorphosed and overprinted, obscuring the ancient record. Beginning 1.7 billion years ago granite and pegmatite intruded. The Routt Plutonic Suite is dated to 1.66 to 1.79 billion years old and is an important rock formation in Rocky Mountain National Park and Buffalo Mountain. The Berthoud orogeny from 1.45 to 1.35 billion years ago created granite intrusions, uplifts, rifts and ductile shear zones, grouped as the Berthoud Plutonic Suite. The Grenville orogeny intruded large granites throughout much of Laurentia, the Proto-North American continent, although Pike's Peak was the only location significantly affected by Grenville granite intrusions in Colorado. The region's crystalline basement rock finished forming with a massive batholith 1.1 billion years ago. The breakup of Rodinia one of the oldest supercontinents, produced rifts between 900 million and 600 million years ago in the Neoproterozoic. These deep extensional basement faults filled with sediments, such as the Uinta rift basin and were often reactivated more recently in Earth history by orogenies. The Uinta Formation and Uncompahgre Formation are both examples of remnant Precambrian rift basin sediments. The end of the Neoproterozoic is not known from the rock record, indicating a period of long-running terrestrial erosion which produced by the Great Unconformity, from 1.1 billion to 510 million years ago. Ten kilometers of basement rock and almost all Precambrian sediments eroded away. =Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)= In the Paleozoic, as multicellular life became common, Colorado was covered in a shallow tropical sea. Thick sequences of sandstone, shale and limestone were laid down on the Precambrian bedrock. The Sonoma orogeny uplifted the ancestral Rocky Mountains around 300 million years ago, which reached heights of around 10,000 feet. The Laurentian continent was colliding with the supercontinent Gondwana to the south, to form the larger supercontinent Pangaea. This continental collision generated two large island mountain ranges, the Frontrangia and Uncompahgria. Erosion quickly wore away at the mountains, shedding sediments across the landscape. =Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)= Dark red Triassic shale and wind-blown sands transformed into sandstone overlie Permian rocks, marking the beginning of the Mesozoic. The sea reached western Colorado and the area was blanketed in ash fall from eruptions to the west. Early Jurassic dune sands were covered over by the sandstone and shale of the Morrison Formation, until a large scale marine transgression flooded the region in the Cretaceous. As sea levels fell, the Dakota Formation sands and pebbles took shape, followed by another marine transgression that deposited several thousand feet of shale as the Mancos Formation and Pierre Formation. Intermediate water depths filled with the Niobrara limestone. Sand layers point to periodic regression and shale layers contain extensive marine fossils. With the beginning of the Laramide orogeny that uplifted the Rocky Mountains, coastal wetlands formed large coal deposits. Thick coal and sandstone layers that grow thicker to the west are known as the Mesaverde Group. =Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)= The Laramide orogeny continued in the Cenozoic up until the Eocene with tectonic forces shifting from north-south mountain ranges to east-west. The Uinta Range is unique, trending east-west due to older tectonic constraints. In the Denver Basin, the Denver Formation and Dawson Formation formed in the Paleocene from sand and gravel eroded out of the Rockies. To the west, rivers filled the lowlands with the Wastach Formation. Erosion and uplift occurred in sync, creating mountains that tended to have gradual slopes. After the end of uplift 20 million years ago, erosion cut down to bedrock in the mountains. In the northwest, the Green River Formation siltstones formed as a lake deposit in a basin formed along Proterozoic faults and was covered over with siltstone and sandstone of the Uinta Formation. Together with Utah and Nevada, Farallon Plate related volcanism in the Oligocene produced enormous eruptions that built up the San Juan Mountains in the southwest. One third of the region was covered in ash flow. Throughout the Miocene, large scale regional uplift elevated Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Arizona 5000 feet above sea level. Erosion in the Pliocene downcut sedimentary rocks, reaching the Precambrian basement and forming the channels of Colorado River tributaries such as the Gunnison, Green, Dolores and Yampa rivers. During the Pleistocene, glaciers formed in the mountains, carving out valleys and straightening streams.

Her main body of work is historical fiction, and her most successful novel is Immortal Queen, a historical romance about Mary, Queen of Scots. Nine of her thirteen novels were published while she was living in Scotland.  Early life and education  Byrd was born Sarah Elizabeth Evelyn Byrd on December 8, 1912 in St. Louis, Missouri, to Joseph Hunter Byrd and his wife Emma Evangeline Byrd, née Howard. Shortly after she was born, the family moved to New York. Joseph Byrd was a mining prospector and promoter who eventually remarried and settled in Tucson, Arizona. The musician Joseph Hunter Byrd, Jr. is her half- brother, from her father's second marriage. Byrd claimed to be a descendant, through her father, of John Campbell, 1st Earl of Loudoun. During 1932–33, Byrd attended writing courses at New York University.  Early career  For nine years, between 1935 and 1944, Byrd was a radio news writer for CBS, then Columbia Broadcasting System. Starting in 1938, she was also a script writer and radio speaker for the New York City radio station WMCA, contributing to the \\"What's News\\" broadcasts and husband-and-wife breakfast table chats. In 1944, Byrd left radio and began a new career path, working until 1950 as an associate editor for New York literary agencies. She established her own literary agency, Betty Byrd Associates, in 1951. This venture appears to have only lasted until 1953, during which time she was also a critic for the A. L. Fierst Literary Agency in New York City. She was the editor for three years of Your Romance, a salacious confession magazine. Before settling down to her eventual career as a novelist, Byrd also wrote jacket copy for the publishing house Julian Messner, Inc. from 1952 to 1960. Sometime during her early career in New York City, she married Don Phares.  Writing career  Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots, became a figure of great interest to Byrd when she was 7 years old, and learned that her birthday was the same as Mary's, and her mother Emma's birthday was the same as Queen Elizabeth I's. She began collecting biographies on the life of Stuart and wrote a play about her when she was 12. Byrd travelled to Scotland in 1953 and researched Stuart's life further, leading to the writing of Immortal Queen, which was published in 1956 when she was 43 years old. Her first novel, it was also her most successful, being translated into seven languages, and was self-reported as a bestseller, though by which contemporary lists is unknown. Byrd moved to Scotland and lived there for the following 10 years, publishing nine more works, six of them Europe- based historical fiction. Her first accommodation in Scotland was Leith Hall in Aberdeenshire, where she rented 14 rooms with her second husband, Barrie Gaunt. In The Ghosts in My Life and A Strange and Seeing Time, Byrd describes the paranormal occurrences she and her husband experienced while living there, along with other spectral encounters. Having tired of the meticulous research she undertook for her historical fiction, Byrd wrote an autobiographical novel in 1975, titled I'll Get By, for which she won the Scottish Arts Council Book Award. She published a sequel to this, It Had to Be You, in 1982. Byrd returned to the United States in 1976, to Tucson where her family had previously settled. She felt homesick for Edinburgh, however, and returned to Scotland after five years. In total, although labelled an American author, only four of her thirteen novels were published while she lived in the US. Throughout her adult life, Byrd contributed articles to various serial publications, including Scottish Field, McCall's, Reader's Digest, Esquire, and Collier's. Byrd died in Tucson on May 11, 1989, at the age of 76.

It was probably constructed in the fourth millennium BCE, during Britain's Early Neolithic period. Built out of earth, the long barrow consists of a sub- trapezoidal tumulus flanked by side ditches. Archaeologists have established that the monument was built by a pastoralist community shortly after the introduction of agriculture to Britain from continental Europe. Although representing part of an architectural tradition of long-barrow building that was widespread across Neolithic Europe, Shrub's Wood Long Barrow belongs to a localised regional variant of barrows produced in the vicinity of the River Stour. Of these, it lies on the eastern side of the river with Julliberrie's Grave, while the third known example in this tumuli group, Jacket's Field Long Barrow, is located on the western side. Shrub's Wood Long Barrow was discovered in the late 1960s, although it has yet to undergo thorough archaeological investigation. Location Shrub's Wood Long Barrow is in an area of woodland, the eponymous Shrub's Wood, near the village of Elmsted. It can be inspected from an adjacent public path. The barrow stands on a sandy sub-soil that is part of the Lenham Beds. The North Downs trackway is around to the south-west of the barrow. Context The construction of long barrows and related funerary monuments took place in various parts of Europe during the Early Neolithic (distribution pictured) The Early Neolithic was a revolutionary period of British history. Between 4500 and 3800 BCE, it saw a widespread change in lifestyle as the communities living in the British Isles adopted agriculture as their primary form of subsistence, abandoning the hunter-gatherer lifestyle that had characterised the preceding Mesolithic period. This came about through contact with continental societies, although it is unclear to what extent this can be attributed to an influx of migrants or to indigenous Mesolithic Britons adopting agricultural technologies from the continent. The region of modern Kent would have been a key area for the arrival of continental European settlers and visitors because of its position on the estuary of the River Thames and its proximity to the continent. Britain was largely forested in this period; widespread forest clearance did not occur in Kent until the Late Bronze Age (c.1000 to 700 BCE). Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence of cereal agriculture or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the Early Neolithic economy on the island was largely pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi-nomadic life. It is apparent that although a common material culture was shared throughout most of the British Isles in this period, there was great regional variation regarding the nature and distribution of settlement, architectural styles, and the use of natural resources. =Stour Long Barrows= Across Western Europe, the Early Neolithic marked the first period in which humans built monumental structures in the landscape. These were tombs that held the physical remains of the dead, and, though sometimes constructed out of timber, many were built using large stones, now known as megaliths. Individuals were rarely buried alone in the Early Neolithic, instead being interred in collective burials with other members of their community. The construction of these collective burial monumental tombs, both wooden and megalithic, began in continental Europe before being adopted in Britain in the first half of the fourth millennium BCE. Many archaeologists have suggested that this is evidence for an Early Neolithic ancestor cult revolving around veneration of the spirits of the dead. Given that other rites may have taken place around these long barrows, historian Ronald Hutton termed them \\"tomb-shrines\\" to reflect their dual purpose. In Britain, these long barrows were typically built on prominent hills and slopes overlooking the surrounding landscape, perhaps at the junction between different territories. Archaeologist Caroline Malone noted that the tombs would have served as one of a variety of markers in the landscape that conveyed information on \\"territory, political allegiance, ownership, and ancestors\\". Many archaeologists have subscribed to the idea that these tomb-shrines served as territorial markers between different tribal groups, although others have argued that such markers would be of little use to a nomadic herding society. Instead, it has been suggested that they were markers along herding pathways. Many archaeologists have suggested that the construction of such monuments reflects an attempt to stamp control and ownership over the land, thus representing a change in mindset brought about by Neolithicisation. Others have suggested that these monuments were built on sites already deemed sacred by Mesolithic hunter-gatherers. Archaeologists are aware of around twelve Neolithic long barrows in Kent. The best-known are the Medway Megaliths found in the vicinity of the River Medway, each of which contains a stone burial chamber: the Coldrum Stones, Addington Long Barrow, Chestnuts Long Barrow, Kit's Coty House, Little Kit's Coty House, the destroyed Smythe's Megalith, and two other possible examples, the Coffin Stone and the White Horse Stone. About east of the Medway Megaliths are the Stour Long Barrows. This distinct regional grouping consists of three known mounds: Jacket's Field Long Barrow, Julliberrie's Grave, and Shrub's Wood Long Barrow. These are within of each other, high up on the North Downs between Canterbury and Ashford; Jacket's Field is on the western side of the River Stour and the other two on the eastern side. Unlike the Medway Megaliths, the Stour Long Barrows do not appear to have used stone as a building material. Their builders' decision against stone was likely deliberate, for sarsens are naturally present in the local area and could have been obtained had the builders wanted them. The presence of the long barrows suggests some sort of settlement nearby in the Early Neolithic period, and two polished flint axes from the period have been found at Soakham Farm, not far from Jacket's Field Long Barrow. The North Downs trackway may have been in use at the time and would have provided routes for local people to travel west. Elsewhere in southern Britain, long barrows were often erected close to causewayed enclosures, although none of the latter have yet been discovered near to the Stour Long Barrows. Elsewhere in the southeast, there are other long barrows of the period; over away from the Stour Long Barrows are another regional cluster in Sussex, while Badshot Lea Long Barrow, a solitary long barrow, is known at Badshot Farm in Farnham, Surrey. Description The surface of the Shrub's Wood Long Barrow Shrub's Wood Long Barrow is oval in shape and has a maximum width of . Aligned on an east-to-west axis, it is long. At its eastern end, the long barrow is 2 metres high, and a little less than that at its western end. There is evidence of side ditches flanking the mound, which are slightly curved in shape and measure between in width. According to its English Heritage listing, it is \\"amongst the finest surviving oval barrows in the South-East\\". Discovery While Julliberrie's Grave had been known to antiquarians since at least the 16th century, Shrub's Wood Long Barrow—as well as Jacket's Field Long Barrow—was only discovered by later archaeological investigation. Archaeologist Ronald Jessup, who excavated Julliberrie's Grave in the 1930s, suggested the likelihood that other long barrows would also be found in the area. In 1970, J. Bradshaw reported in Archaeologia Cantiana that Shrub's Wood Long Barrow had been \\"recently recorded\\". On discovery, it was made a Scheduled Ancient Monument. , neither Shrub's Wood Long Barrow nor Jacket's Field Long Barrow had undergone archaeological excavation.

Her politics were green. Her focus as a senator was on women's rights. She was also the first Berlin senator to \\"go public\\" about being a lesbian.  Life  Anne Klein was born in Bilsdorf, a small village in the hills above Saarlouis, in what at that time was still part of the Saar Protectorate, controlled under conditions of growing ambiguity by the French government. There have been suggestions that her subsequent approach to gender politics may have been influenced by the 1947 Saarland Constitution, a document based on French law which incorporated elements of gender equality before the law and the concept of equal pay for equal work. To the north and east of the region lay West Germany, which under Chancellor Adenauer would have been seen as a relatively conservative society in respect of such matters. After 1955 the Saarland was integrated into the German Federal Republic (West Germany). Klein passed her Abitur (school final exams) at the Realgymnasium (secondary school) in nearby Dillingen. She studied Jurisprudence and Psychology at Saarbrücken and, from 1972, as a referendary in Berlin. She became involved in West Berlin's rapidly evolving feminist movement and with fellow activists set up the city's first women's shelter and its first feminist legal advice centre in Berlin's Kreuzberg quarter. In 1978 she passed her state law exams and, in the teeth of opposition from the German Law Society (\\"Rechtsanwaltskammer\\") set up in Berlin the first law practice in the country specialising in women's law. Until shortly before she died she continued to work in Berlin as a lawyer and notary specialising in family law.  Politics and professional life  Between 1983 and 1984 Anne Klein worked as a research assistant for the Green Party group in the Bundestag (West German parliament). It was the first time the party's candidates had been elected to the assembly. She worked particularly closely with Waltraud Schoppe und Petra Kelly. The policy area on which she focused covered \\"women, antidiscrimintation and social affairs\\". With other women she worked on the party's first draft for an \\"anti- discrimination law\\", which some years later - albeit with further changes - was introduced in the Bundestag. Anne Klein's principal objectives with this work were to anchor feminist policies within the Green Party's strategy and to build up the role of women in framing party policy. The results of the Berlin city region elections on 29 January 1989 were inconclusive. Following lengthy coaliation negotiations Walter Momper of the SPD emerged as Governing Mayor of what at that stage was still West Berlin. Anne Klein accepted an invitation to join his ministerial team in the Senate of Berlin. Although she was not actually a senator, she was co-opted as a \\"non-party candidate for the Berlin Green Party\\". Her portfolio covered \\"Women, young people and the family\\" (\\"Frauen, Jugend und Familie\\"). Anne Klein, who was already known for her feminist views and whose own same-sex partnership was no secret, attracted mixed headlines when she set up in her department an office for same-sex lifestyles. She was able to provide a hitherto unprecendented degree of financial security for the \\"Wildwasser project\\" which supports women who have suffered sexual abuse as children. On her initiative sanctuaries were created for women and girls who found themselves in crisis and fell into prostitution. She also took steps to ensure that women seeking refuge in the city's women's shelters should not be required to pay for their accommodation there. One of the unforeseen consequences of the changes of 1989/90 and the reunification of Berlin was that the redevelopment of an area of what had been East Berlin, which had been cleared for rebuilding, was postponed. The area in question quickly became home to a very large number of squatters. In order to move matters on, in November 1990 the Berlin senate ordered one of Berlin's largest police operations of the postwar era in order to remove the squatters and seal the area off to prevent their return. The so-called Clearing of the Mainzer Street involved ten water canon trucks, helicopters, tear gas, guns and around 3,000 policemen. This belt and braces approach was widely seen as heavy handed. There was serious street fighting: there were complaints. It turned out that Erich Pätzold, the SPD senator whose portfolio covered the issue of squatter clearance, had neither alerted his three Green Party ministerial colleagues to his plans nor involved them in discussions about it once the exercise was under way.Gudrun Heinrich: Rot-Grün in Berlin 1989–1990. In: Joachim Raschke: Die Grünen. Wie sie wurden, was sie sind. Köln 1993, p. 813. The already uneasy coalition between SPD senators and their Green-facing colleagues broke apart. The three Green senators were persuaded not to pursue their motion of no-confidence, but after 23 months in office Anne Klein, along with her like-minded colleagues Michaele Schreyer and Sybille Volkholz, did resign. The Momper administration lost their majority: the political crisis resulting was less acute than might be thought, since new elections had already been scheduled to take place the next month.Eckhard Jesse: Die Wahl zum Abgeordnetenhaus von Berlin am 7. Dezember 1990. Die Korrektur der Korrektur von 1989. In: Zeitschrift für Parlamentsfragen 22 (1991), S. 392. Anne Klein's public profile had already been raised in an unwelcome manner in the summer of 1989 when it became known that back in 1987 she had won approximately 8,000 marks in the \\"Pilotenspiel\\", a new gambling game, fashionable among yuppies, that was based on a \\"Pyramid scheme\\" model. She had been persuaded by colleagues to join in, investing approximately 2,000 marks under the pseudonym \\"Zora\\". It was in the nature of the \\"game\\" that she had, in turn, recruited other players to it. When the facts emerged, hostile media delighted in describing her - almost certainly incorrectly - as a \\"passionate player\\" of the \\"game\\". She herself later condemned such schemes as \\"anti- social\\" (\\"...ein asoziales Spiel\\"). \\"I can only advise anyone [tempted to participate] not to touch it\\" (\\"\\"Ich kann nur jedem raten, die Finger davon zu lassen\\"\\"). She admitted that at the time she had \\"suppressed\\" (\\"verdrängt\\") her appreciation of the way that the defining principal of this game was that success was dependent on persuading other people to take part in it. Subsequently she shunned gambling, never participating in lotteries or visiting a casino. Besides her work as a lawyer and her contributions to the Green Party Bundestag group, Anne Klein involved herself in professional associations. She was a member of the executive board of the \\"Berlin bar association\\" (\\"Rechtsanwaltskammer Berlin\\") between 1995 and 1997. Between June 1999 and December 2006 she served as president of the \\"Berlin Lawyer's Benevolent Association\\" (\\"Versorgungswerke der Rechtsanwälte in Berlin\\") she was able to implement support measures for members' dependents left behind following the deaths of same-sex partners.Waltraud Schwab: „Ich habe meine Träume gelebt“. Anwältin, Politikerin und Kämpferin Anne Klein starb mit nur 61 Jahren – ein Nachruf. In: L-Mag, Juli/August 2011, p. 18. In the middle of 2006 Klein was elected vice-president of the \\"German Lawyers' Union\\" (\\"Anwaltunion Deutschland\\"), described by her former firm as a \\"nationally engaged coming together of high-profile professional lawyers in Germany\\" (\\"national agierenden Zusammenschluss renommierter Fachanwälte Deutschlands\\").  Celebration  In 2012 the Heinrich Böll Foundation introduced the \\"Anne Klein Women's Prize\\" in order to celebrate the memory of Anne Klein and \\"her fight to enforce women's rights to liberty\\". The foundation provides an annual prize to women committed to gender democracy.  Personal  Anne Klein's life partnership, for almost 27 years, was with Barbara Binek.

It was probably constructed in the fourth millennium BCE, during Britain's Early Neolithic period. Built out of earth, the long barrow consists of an sub- trapezoidal tumulus flanked by side ditches. Archaeologists have established that the monument was built by a pastoralist community shortly after the introduction of agriculture to Britain from continental Europe. Although representing part of an architectural tradition of long-barrow building that was widespread across Neolithic Europe, Jacket's Field Long Barrow belongs to a localised regional variant of barrows produced in the vicinity of the River Stour. Of these, it lies on the western side of the river, while Julliberrie's Grave and Shrub's Wood Long Barrow are found on the eastern side. The site was discovered in 1970, at which point it was concealed in dense woodland, although has yet to undergo thorough archaeological investigation. Location Jacket's Field Long Barrow is found within woodland in Jacket's Field, southeast of the village of Boughton Aluph. It is located within the Soakham Downs on a subsoil of Clay-with-Flints. The North Downs trackway is located around to the south-west of the barrow. It can be inspected from an adjacent public path. Context The construction of long barrows and related funerary monuments took place in various parts of Europe during the Early Neolithic (distribution pictured) The Early Neolithic was a revolutionary period of British prehistory. Between 4500 and 3800 BCE, there was a widespread change in lifestyle as the communities living on the British Isles adopted agriculture as their primary form of subsistence, abandoning the hunter-gatherer lifestyle that had characterised the preceding Mesolithic period. This came about through contact with continental societies, although it is unclear to what extent this can be attributed to an influx of migrants or to indigenous Mesolithic Britons adopting agricultural technologies from the continent. The region of modern Kent would have been a key area for the arrival of continental European settlers and visitors, because of its position on the estuary of the River Thames and its proximity to the continent. Britain was largely forested in this period; widespread forest clearance did not occur in the area around modern Kent until the Late Bronze Age (c.1000 to 700 BCE). Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the Early Neolithic economy on the island was largely pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi-nomadic life. It is apparent that although a common material culture was shared throughout most of the British Isles in this period, there was great regional variation regarding the nature and distribution of settlement, architectural styles, and the use of natural resources. =Stour Long Barrows= Across Western Europe, the Early Neolithic marked the first period in which humans built monumental structures in the landscape. These were tombs that held the physical remains of the dead, and though sometimes constructed out of timber, many were built using large stones, now known as \\"megaliths\\". Individuals were rarely buried alone in the Early Neolithic, instead being interned in collective burials with other members of their community. The construction of these collective burial monumental tombs, both wooden and megalithic, began in continental Europe before being adopted in Britain in the first half of the fourth millennium BCE. Many archaeologists have suggested that this is evidence for an Early Neolithic ancestor cult revolving around veneration of the spirits of the dead. Given that other rites may have taken place around these long barrows, the historian Ronald Hutton termed them \\"tomb-shrines\\" to reflect their dual purpose. In Britain, these long barrows were typically located on prominent hills and slopes overlooking the surrounding landscape, perhaps at the junction between different territories. The archaeologist Caroline Malone noted that the tombs would have served as one of a variety of markers in the landscape that conveyed information on \\"territory, political allegiance, ownership, and ancestors\\". Many archaeologists have subscribed to the idea that these tomb-shrines served as territorial markers between different tribal groups, although others have argued that such markers would be of little use to a nomadic herding society. Instead, it has been suggested that they were markers along herding pathways. Many archaeologists have suggested that the construction of such monuments reflects an attempt to stamp control and ownership over the land, thus representing a change in mindset brought about by Neolithicisation. Others have suggested that these monuments were built on sites already deemed sacred by Mesolithic hunter-gatherers. Juliberrie's Grave, one of the other two known Stour long barrows Archaeologists are aware of around twelve Neolithic long barrows located in Kent. The best known are the Medway Megaliths found in the vicinity of the River Medway, each of which contains a stone burial chamber: the Coldrum Stones, Addington Long Barrow, Chestnuts Long Barrow, Kit's Coty House, Little Kit's Coty House, (the destroyed) Smythe's Megalith, and two other possible examples, the Coffin Stone and the White Horse Stone. About east of the Medway Megaliths are the Stour long barrows. This distinct regional grouping consists of three known mounds: Jacket's Field Long Barrow, Julliberrie's Grave, and Shrub's Wood Long Barrow. These are located within of each other, high up on the North Downs between Canterbury and Ashford; Jacket's Field is on the western side of the River Stour and the other two on the eastern side. Unlike the Medway Megaliths, the Stour long barrows do not appear to have used stone as a building material. Their builders' decision not to do so was likely deliberate, for sarsens are naturally present in the local area and could have been obtained had they wanted them. The presence of the long barrows suggests some sort of settlement nearby in the Early Neolithic period, and two polished flint axes from the period have been found at Soakham Farm, not far from Jacket's Field Long Barrow. The North Downs trackway may have been in use at the time, and would have provided routes for local people to travel west. Elsewhere in southern Britain, long barrows were often erected close to causewayed enclosures, although none of the latter have yet been discovered near to the Stour long barrows. Elsewhere in the southeast, there are other long barrows of the period; over away from the Stour long barrows are another regional cluster in Sussex, while a solitary long barrow is known at Badshot Farm in Farnham, Surrey. Description Jacket's Field Long Barrow is \\"slightly trapezoidal\\" in shape. It aligns on an east/southeast to west/southwest axis. It measures approximately in length, with a width of at its eastern end and at the west. At its western end, it reaches in height, and at the eastern end almost . There is evidence of side ditches that once flanked the mound. Discovery Jacket's Field barrow While Julliberrie's Grave had been known to antiquarians since at least the 16th century, Jacket's Field Long Barrow—as well as Shrub's Wood Long Barrow—was only discovered by later archaeological investigation. The archaeologist Ronald Jessup, who excavated Julliberrie's Grave in the 1930s, suggested the likelihood that other long barrows would also be found in the area. In 1970, J. Bradshaw reported in the Archaeologia Cantiana, the journal of the Kent Archaeological Society, that Jacket's Field Long Barrow had been discovered within dense woodland and reported to the Ordnance Survey archaeological team, who investigated and confirmed its existence. It was subsequently made a Scheduled Ancient Monument. As of 2007, neither Jacket's Field nor Shrub's Wood had undergone archaeological excavation.

According to Baring-Gould: \\"(John Froude II) had been well educated, and was a graduate of Oxford University. It is said that he had met with great disappointment in love, and early in life retired into what was, in the beginning of the nineteenth century, the great retirement from the world of culture and intellectual activity, Knowstone-cum-Molland\\". Froude was appointed Rector of Molland-cum- Knowstone by his widowed mother in 1804, to replace his deceased father in that position, and remained there until his death in 1852. He spent most of his time hunting with his own pack of hounds, and shooting birds. According to Baring-Gould: \\"Froude's church preferment was at the time valuable, and he was, moreover, in possession of some considerable private fortune in addition to his professional income. He had few educated people residing in his neighbourhood. With the quiet, inoffensive clergy about he would not associate; with others he could not, as they held themselves aloof from him. He soon came to associate almost entirely with the rough farmers who inhabited the Exmoor district, and he grew to resemble them in mind, language, habits of life and dress. From them he was principally differentiated by his native wit, his superior education, and his exceeding wickedness\\". He had several run-ins with his nemesis Henry Phillpotts, Bishop of Exeter 1830 to 1869, which are recorded humorously in several near-contemporary sources. Phillpotts was a determined persecutor of clerics who were not wholly focussed on serving their parish as ministers of religion, and tried to abolish the country squire lifestyle followed by many clerics within his diocese of Devon and Cornwall. However Froude's position as rector was for life, his father having been the patron, and the bishop had little power over him. When the bishop at last decided to visit Froude in person to appeal to him to desist from his hunting lifestyle, Froude employed various ruses to foil him, from digging up the road to trap the bishop's carriage, to instructing his housekeeper to make him wait in a cold parlour and to frighten him away by reporting her master was suffering with a deadly infectious disease. He could not abide being crossed by his friends, acquaintances and neighbours, and took his revenge in cruel and vicious ways, including burning hayricks, sabotaging carriages to cause serious accidents, maiming or injuring horses and livestock, burning plantations, choking chimneys, and manipulating his victims into positions of public ridicule. \\"He had a nicely adjusted scale of punishments for all who offended him\\".Baring-Gould, Devonshire Characters and Strange Events Most of his dirty-work was performed by his admiring gang of thugs and vagabonds whom he protected and provided with food and basic lodgings. He was wise enough never to give them direct orders to commit crimes, but merely hinted at what his pleasure might be, which hints were treated as orders. Examples are quoted by Baring-Gould: \\"For instance, if a farmer had offended him, he would say to one of these men subject to his influence, \\"As I've been standing in the church porch, Harry, I thought what a terrible thing it would be if the rick over yonder of Farmer G  were to burn. 'Twould come home to him pretty sharp, I reckon.\\" Next night the rick would be on fire\\" and \\"A gentleman near had offended him. This person had a plantation of larch near his house. Froude said to Tom, \\"Bad job for Squire , if his larch lost their leaders!\\" Next morning every larch in the plantation had been mutilated\\". An example of a direct threat made by him to someone who had crossed him, a fellow parson from Hawkridge, was the following: \\"Do you not know that to-night on my return I have only to say at Knowstone, \\"Bones, bones at Hawkridge!\\" and, mind you, name no names, and your carcase will be stinking in a ditch within the week?\\". By these means he became feared by all who knew him, whether lowly or rich and powerful. When a man crossed Froude, as if by mystery within a couple of weeks he would suffer some calamity. If Froude's offer to buy a horse was refused, that horse would be blinded. If his parishioners did not pay their tithes to him promptly, their hay-rick would burned down one night, mysteriously. He did not hesitate to sell a blind horse, and when on discovering the fault the buyer demanded his money back, Froude refused, exclaiming: \\"Sir, you asked me for a hunter, and one that could jump, and I sold you a hunter that could jump. You saw the horse, and it was a bargain. You did not ask me if it could see\\". Despite all this criminal behaviour, he was a magistrate who wielded considerable local judicial power, as did many of his fellow country gentlemen, most of whom discharged their important duty in an honourable manner. Froude however was not averse to using his position to obtain search warrants from fellow magistrates on false pretences, and thus to have police ordered to search the residence of one of his enemies, destroying his home during the process. He was a close friend of another \\"hunting parson\\", namely the famous Parson Jack Russell, who also lived in North Devon, who recorded many personal anecdotes of Froude's character, mainly concerning his prowess on the hunting field and in breeding hounds. Russell was also a target of Bishop Phillpotts, and avoided his attentions in equally humorous ways as did Froude. The \\"Froude Arms\\" public house in East Anstey, opened before 1878,https://eastanstey.org.uk/history/ closed in 2012, now a private residence He lived for most of his life at Knowstone Rectory, in the middle of what was then wild and untamed moorland. Later he moved to nearby East Anstey Barton, a house he built in 1848 on the site of \\"the old mansion\\" in the village of East Anstey, next to the church. In 1850 he was the principal landowner in that parish. In 1866 a \\"Mrs Froude\\" (presumably his widow) was residing at Barton House. Until recently his family was commemorated by the \\"Froude Arms\\" public house at East Anstey, closed in about 2012. He appears to have been succeeded by his sister's descendant, John Froude Bellew, in 1866 living at Rhyll Manor, East Anstey, and in 1878 described as lord of the manor. Marriage He married late in life, before which time it was noted that he always employed good-looking housekeepers. Baring-Gould relates the circumstances of Froude's marriage as follows: \\"Froude married a Miss Halse, the pretty sister of two well-known yeomen of Anstey. She was quite young enough to have been his daughter, and they had no children perhaps fortunately. The circumstances of the marriage are said to have been these. Froude had paid Miss Halse some of his insolent attentions, that meant, if they meant anything, a certain contemptuous admiration. The brothers were angry. They invited him to their house, made him drunk, and when drunk sign a paper promising to marry their sister before three months were up or to forfeit £20,000. They took care to have this document well attested, and next morning presented it to Mr. Froude, who had forgotten all about it. He was very angry, blustered, cajoled, tried to laugh it off—all to no purpose. He was constrained to marry her. And he seems to have been really fond of her. Certain it is that she was warmly attached to him, and after his death would speak of him as her \\"dear departed saint,\\" which implies a singular misappropriation of terms, and confusion of ideas\\". Death In The Maid of Sker, Blackmore represents Chowne as torn to pieces by his hounds. Baring- Gould relates the actual circumstances of Froude's death as follows: > \\"Before his parlour window grew a peculiarly handsome trimmed box-tree. Now > Froude had done a mean and cruel act to a young farmer near, tricking him > out of a considerable sum of money. One night the box-tree was pulled up by > the roots and carried away, no one knew whither, or for certain by whom, > though the young farmer was suspected of the deed. Froude raged over the > insult; but as he was unable to bring it home, and as his powers were > failing, his rage was impotent. The uprooting of the box-tree apparently > precipitated his death. He felt that the awe of him was gone, his control > over the neighbourhood was lost. This thought, even more than mortification > at not being able to revenge the uprooting of his box-tree, broke him down, > and he rapidly sank, intellectually and physically, and died 9 December, > 1852\\". He was buried at Knowstone. According to Hoskins: \\"He left his two parishes, like himself, in a heathen and lawless condition\\". He appears to have been succeeded by the descendants of his sister Prestwood Love Froude who married William Bellew (1772–1826) of Stockleigh Court in Devon. Her son and heir was John Prestwood Bellew (born 1803) who married Mary Ann Hancock, eldest daughter of William Hancock of Wiveliscombe in Somerset, a wealthy brewer. His son and heir was John Froude Bellew (born 1829), of Rhyll Manor, East Anstey, who in 1866 was the major landowner in that parish and in 1878 was described as lord of the manor. A connection of this family was the rugby player Froude Hancock (1865–1933), whose monument is a large inscribed boulder on West Anstey Common. Sources *Davies, E.W., A Memoir of the Rev.

A sequel, Artificial Condition, was released on May 8, 2018, followed by Rogue Protocol on August 7, 2018. The next installment, Exit Strategy, was released on October 2, 2018. Wells noted in 2017 that the four novellas \\"do have an overarching story, with the fourth one bringing the arc to a conclusion.\\" A full Murderbot novel, Network Effect, was released on May 5, 2020. A Murderbot short story, \\"Compulsory\\", was published in Wired in 2018. =All Systems Red= A scientific expedition on an alien planet goes awry when one of its members is attacked by a giant native creature. She is saved by the expedition's SecUnit, a cyborg security agent which has secretly named itself \\"Murderbot\\". Though it has hacked the governor module that allows it to be controlled by humans, and would much rather be watching soap operas, the SecUnit has a vested interest in keeping its human clients safe and alive, since it has an especially grisly past expedition on its record. Murderbot soon discovers that information regarding hazardous fauna has been deleted from their survey packet of the planet. Further investigation reveals that some sections of their maps are missing as well. Meanwhile the PreservationAux survey team, led by Dr. Mensah, navigate their mixed feelings about the part machine, part human nature of their SecUnit. When they lose contact with the other known expedition, the DeltFall Group, Mensah leads a team to the opposite side of the planet to investigate. At the DeltFall habitat, Murderbot discovers that everyone there has been brutally murdered, and one of their three SecUnits destroyed. Murderbot disables the remaining two as they attack it, but is surprised when two others appear; it destroys one, and Mensah takes the other. Murderbot is seriously injured, and realizes that one of the rogue SecUnits has installed a combat override module into its neck. The Preservation scientists are able to remove it before it completes the data upload that would put Murderbot under the control of whoever has command over the other SecUnits. The team discovers that Murderbot is autonomous, and once malfunctioned and murdered 57 people. The Preservation scientists mostly agree that, based on its protective behavior thus far, the SecUnit can be trusted. Remembering small incidents that now appear to be attempted sabotage, Murderbot and the group determine that there must be a third expedition, whose members are trying to eliminate DeltFall and Preservation for some reason. The Preservation scientists confirm that their HubSystem has been hacked, and flee their habitat before the mystery expedition they have dubbed \\"EvilSurvey\\" comes to kill them. The EvilSurvey team—GrayCris—leaves a message in the Preservation habitat inviting its scientists to meet at a rendezvous point to negotiate terms for their survival. Murderbot knows that GrayCris will never let them live, but the SecUnit has a plan. It makes an overture to GrayCris to negotiate for its own freedom, but this is a distraction while the Preservation scientists access the GrayCris HubSystem to activate their emergency beacon. The plan works, but Murderbot is injured protecting Mensah from the explosion of the launch. Later the SecUnit finds itself repaired, and retaining its memories and disabled governor module. Mensah has bought its contract, and will bring it back to Preservation's home base where it can live autonomously. Though grateful, Murderbot is reluctant to have its decisions made for it, and slips away on a cargo ship. =Artificial Condition= The rogue SecUnit calling itself Murderbot hacks its way onto unmanned cargo ships to travel toward the mining facility where it once malfunctioned. It hopes to learn more about the incident, of which it has little memory and which resulted in its killing 57 people. Murderbot reluctantly befriends the powerful, intrusive bot that pilots the research transport in which the SecUnit is making the final leg of its journey to RaviHyral. Murderbot allows this artificial intelligence—which it has dubbed \\"ART\\", for \\"Asshole Research Transport\\"—to make physical modifications to the SecUnit's body that will better allow it to pass for an augmented human. To gain access to the RaviHyral facility, Murderbot takes a contract as a security consultant for three scientists who are meeting with their former employer, the head and namesake of Tlacey Excavations, to negotiate the return of their research, which they believe was illegally seized by the company. Their transport craft is sabotaged, but with ART's help, Murderbot is able to land it safely. Now aware that Tlacey is actively trying to kill the scientists rather than comply with their demands, Murderbot guides them through their meeting with Tlacey, and thwarts another assassination attempt. Murderbot learns that the massacre was the result of another mining operation's sabotage attempt using malware. Tlacey's ComfortUnit—a weaponless, anatomically correct form of robot primarily used as a \\"sexbot\\"—voices its desire for freedom and willingness to help Murderbot thwart Tlacey. While the SecUnit meets with a Tlacey employee to secretly retrieve a copy of the research, Tlacey abducts one of the scientists, Tapan. Murderbot goes after her, accepting a combat override module that is intended to control the SecUnit but actually has no effect. Once inside the shuttle, Murderbot neutralizes Tlacey's guards and retrieves a wounded Tapan, and Tlacey is killed. Tapan is healed by the MedSystem on ART's ship, and Murderbot hacks the governor module of the ComfortUnit to grant it its freedom. Murderbot sets off on its own. =Rogue Protocol= Murderbot makes its way to a recently abandoned GrayCris terraforming facility in orbit over the planet Milu to collect further evidence of the company's past crimes. Befriending a bot named Miki as a means to keep its presence hidden, the SecUnit secretly follows a team of humans sent to assess the facility before a new company takes possession of it. Murderbot is forced to reveal itself when the humans are attacked by a hostile combat robot, and one of the researchers is captured. Hiding its lack of a governor module and pretending to have been sent by \\"Security Consultant Rin\\", Murderbot attempts to guide the humans—most of whom have never worked with a SecUnit before—while still seeming to defer to them. The exceptions are the team's hired security detail, Wilken and Gerth, who know Murderbot's capabilities as a SecUnit and are wary of it. They divide the team, Gerth taking two of the researchers back to their fellows on the shuttle, and Wilken leading Murderbot, Miki, and Miki's mistress Don Abene to rescue the hostage, Hirune. Aware of the failings of human security professionals, Murderbot conceives its own plan to rescue Hirune, which succeeds. The injured Murderbot comes upon Wilken attempting to kill Abene, but manages to hack into Wilken's combat armor and seize control of it. Theorizing that Wilken and Gerth had been secretly hired by GrayCris to destroy the facility before anyone could discover the illegal mining activities going on there, Murderbot leads Miki and the researchers back to the shuttle. Meanwhile, Wilken and Gerth have set in motion the destruction of the tractor array that is keeping the facility from breaking up in the atmosphere. Murderbot neutralizes Gerth's combat armor and halts the destruction of the array, and the shuttle takes off just as more hostile combat robots arrive. One clings to the ship and forces its way in; Murderbot destroys it, but not before it destroys Miki. Murderbot decides to deliver the evidence to Dr. Mensah personally. =Exit Strategy= Murderbot is suspicious when the robot ship it has taken to HaveRatton Station is diverted to a dock near station security. Murderbot sneaks off the craft through a rear airlock, and soon confirms that an armed boarding team is waiting to storm the ship in search of a rogue SecUnit. Learning that Dr. Mensah has been accused of corporate espionage by GrayCris and is now missing, Murderbot determines that she has likely been abducted by the company and taken to the corporate hub at TranRollinHyfa. Murderbot realizes that its actions on Milu have put Mensah in danger, and notes the possibility that GrayCris is luring it to TranRollinHyfa, but goes anyway. Murderbot approaches the three members of Mensah's original expedition team—Ratthi, Pin-Lee, Gurathin—who are there trying to amass the funds to pay the ransom GrayCris has demanded for Mensah. They hatch a plan wherein they will pretend to have the money and arrange for an exchange, as a means to draw Mensah out of the impenetrable security zone. The ruse works, and the three researchers flee to their contracted gunship while Murderbot moves to retrieve Mensah. Murderbot dispatches Mensah's captors easily, but a station-wide alarm is triggered before they can reach a shuttle. Three hostile SecUnits arrive, and barriers close off all gates going in and out of the concourse. Murderbot convinces a human security supervisor to raise one of the barriers enough for Mensah to slip through, and seizes control of all nearby drones and hauler bots to create chaos. Murderbot puts down two adversaries, but realizes that the third is a Combat SecUnit: harder to destroy, with hacking and enhanced scanning abilities. Mensah and her team manage to manually open a gate for the critically injured Murderbot, who escapes through it. Fleeing on the gunship, they are pursued by a Palisade security ship that attacks the gunship with a computer virus intended to seize control of its systems, neutralize any augmented human crew, and open all the airlocks. Murderbot and the bot pilot hold off the worst effects of the malware, and manage to isolate the virus in a shuttle that they disengage from the gunship. With control of the gunship restored, the captain fires on the Palisade ship and the team makes their escape. Murderbot has a critical system failure, and collapses. Awakening in a med bay with Mensah and the team as they arrive at their home base, Preservation, Murderbot begins a lengthy self- repair process. Mensah and her team offer to shelter Murderbot until it is back up to 100% functionality and can decide what it wants to do next, even if it is just to watch media. The team invites Murderbot along on their upcoming expedition as their security detail, and Mensah later mentions that GoodNightLander—the contractor of Murderbot's Milu clients—also wants to hire \\"Security Consultant Rin\\". Murderbot is content to know that it has options. =Network Effect= Murderbot has been sent by Dr. Mensah on a research expedition that includes her daughter Amena, her brother-in-law Thiago, and Drs. Arada, Overse, and Ratthi. Their ship is set upon by a hostile transport vessel, which Murderbot and Amena are compelled to board as the others flee in an escape pod. As the transport moves into a nearly wormhole, Murderbot hunts the grey-skinned humanoids in control of the ship, isolates Amena and the human captives Ras and Eletra in a safe zone, and begins to realize that the transport is the same one once controlled by its robot pilot friend ART. Arada and the others, who have followed the ship into the wormhole, are able to board as Murderbot finishes off the hostiles and manages to reload a deleted ART with a code phrase left for it. As Murderbot guessed, after being invaded by the grey raiders, ART sent them after the SecUnit ostensibly for use as a weapon, but really because ART determined that Murderbot could overcome them. Murderbot is enraged that ART would endanger the SecUnit's humans this way, and is further annoyed when ART insists that Murderbot and its human crew help find and recover the transport vessel's missing crew. Murderbot and its team descend to the planetary colony that seems to be at the center of the situation, and find that the colonists have been exposed to alien remnant contamination. They have developed the grey skin condition to varying degrees, and have separated into warring factions representing the least contaminated versus the most, who seem controlled by an alien hive mind. The missing crew have effected their own escape, and while Arada and her people help them, Murderbot is captured. Art begins firing missiles at the colony, demanding its release. Murderbot is rescued with the help of another SecUnit whose governor module it disabled, as well as a software version of itself set loose on the colony's defenses. The group returns to Preservation, and Murderbot decides to accompany ART and its crew on their next mission. =Fugitive Telemetry= Fugitive Telemetry, a prequel to Network Effect, is due to be published in April 2021. Reception Publishers Weekly wrote that Wells \\"gives depth to a rousing but basically familiar action plot by turning it into the vehicle by which SecUnit engages with its own rigorously denied humanity\\". The Verge likewise felt it to be a \\"pretty basic story\\", but nonetheless \\"fun\\", and lauded Wells's worldbuilding. James Nicoll observed that the plot relies on \\"opportunistic corporate malevolence\\", and noted that only Murderbot's personality prevented the setting from being \\"unrelentingly grim\\". All Systems Red won the 2017 Nebula Award for Best Novella, the 2018 Hugo Award for Best Novella, and the American Library Association's Alex Award, and was nominated for the 2017 Philip K. Dick Award. The three remaining novellas had enough votes for the 2018 Hugo Award final ballot but Wells declined all nominations except for Artificial Condition, which won.

It will be hosted at Mosaic Stadium in Regina, Saskatchewan, marking the fourth time the game had been held in the city, and the first to be held at the new Mosaic Stadium as opposed to Taylor Field. The game was originally awarded to be played in the 2020 season as the 108th Grey Cup. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was announced in May 2020 that the festivities in Regina had been cancelled, and that the game's venue would have been decided by home advantage if played. Regina was tentatively awarded the 110th Grey Cup in 2022. Under a hub city model, the CFL had planned to play the entire 2020 season in Winnipeg. However, the CFL cancelled the 2020 season entirely in August 2020, effectively making the 2022 Grey Cup the 109th edition.  Background  = Host city selection = Mosaic Stadium, the host stadium of the game. As of August 2018, three teams were interested in submitting bids as the league met with representatives of those unnamed clubs in Hamilton. Based on the location of the meeting and their previously-stated desire to host, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats were speculated to be one of the teams. The previous obstacle of the lawsuit over the construction of Tim Hortons Field was settled on May 31, 2018, which had prevented the Tiger-Cats from bidding on a Grey Cup game. The Tiger-Cats had previously expressed interest in submitting a bid for the 107th Grey Cup and with litigation cleared, they can move forward with bidding to host their first championship game since the 84th Grey Cup in 1996. The first club to openly confirm their plans to bid were the Saskatchewan Roughriders, as stated by the club's president and CEO, Craig Reynolds, on October 1, 2018. The game would coincide with the 110th anniversary of the club and would be the fourth time the game would be hosted in Saskatchewan, if successful. The Roughriders' new facility, Mosaic Stadium, opened in 2017 and the Roughriders last hosted the Grey Cup in 2013. On November 4, 2018, it was reported that the Montreal Alouettes were preparing a bid to see Olympic Stadium host the 2020 championship game. The Alouettes confirmed that they had representatives in Toronto on November 6, 2018 to make their presentation at the league head office to host the game. It was confirmed on November 13, 2018 that the Tiger- Cats were indeed making a bid for the game as team representatives made their presentation to the league head office in Toronto the week prior. Their Grey Cup festival concept included a downtown-centred event at venues like the Hamilton Convention Centre and Art Gallery of Hamilton. The Tiger-Cats' president of business operations, Matt Afinec, confirmed that the club had support from Hamilton's mayor, Fred Eisenberger, and that three bids for the Grey Cup game had been made. The CFL's Grey Cup director, Céline Séguin, had previously stated that the league would like to announce hosts sooner. With the previous year's game being announced 19 months prior, this game could be declared much earlier. On February 21, 2019, it was officially announced that the 2020 and 2021 Grey Cup games had been respectively awarded to Regina and Hamilton. = Cancellation of the 2020 season = The 108th Grey Cup faced a possible postponement or cancellation due to the COVID-19 pandemic; on May 11, Premier Scott Moe stated that current public health orders would not allow events that constitute large gatherings, \\"including up to and potentially including even this fall's Grey Cup\\", for the foreseeable future. The 101st Grey Cup attracted $93 million in economic activity to the province. On May 20, the CFL announced that the 2020 season will not begin until at least September, and that the 108th Grey Cup and its festivities will not be hosted by Regina as a neutral site. Instead, the Grey Cup will be played at the home field of the participating team with the better regular season record (making it theoretically possible that the game may still be played in Regina, contingent on the Roughriders making it to the game and holding home advantage). Regina will host the 110th Grey Cup as a neutral site in 2022. On July 21, the CFL announced a tentative plan to play the entirety of the 2020 season in Winnipeg as a hub city. However, citing financial issues and other factors, the CFL announced on August 17 that the 2020 season had been cancelled, marking the first time the Grey Cup will not be awarded since 1919.

This has applications in both energy storage and in understanding the mechanisms of corrosion. The battery systems include combinations which include either sodium or lithium battery systems. The ion transportation has included systems using ionic liquids, polymer electrolytes and plastic crystals. Her group has created a new large rage of organic plastics that have ionic applications. In 2020 she and colleagues announced a breakthrough in Lithium batteries due to a novel salt based electrolyte. The resulting batteries were more efficient and they were not flammable. In fact their new batteries became more efficient as the temperature increases.

The village was a port on the Nizhnyaya Tunguska River.  History  The village was founded by Mikhail Sidorov in 1859 under the name of the Olga-Vasilievsky Mine, named in honour of the wife and friend of Sidorov. A graphite mine was opened in Noginsk in the same year and was supplied to pencil factories in St Petersburg and other cities. During the Soviet era, the settlement developed thanks to the extraction of graphite, and helped to encourage the settlement and development of the Far North of the former USSR. A village council was formed on 20 March 1950 and Noginsk was proclaimed as a working village on 16 March 1951. Noginsk had the third largest deposit of coal and graphite in the Soviet Union, amounting to around 9 million tons; however, due to the cost of extracting it, operations at the mine ceased shortly after the collapse of the USSR when the extraction company closed.  Elimination of the settlement  The population of the village, which had grown to more than 700 people during the Soviet era, quickly fell nearly as low as 100 after the closure of the graphite mine. As a result, a referendum was held in 2006 on the elimination of Noginsk. The majority of the residents voted in favour of its liquidation. By the end of 2006, the 52 families in the village had moved to other towns and cities in Krasnoyarsk Krai and elsewhere in Siberia, and Noginsk became a ghost town.

The film is directed by Adil & Bilall and written by Chris Bremner, Peter Craig and Joe Carnahan. It stars returning actors Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. The film's cast also includes Paola Núñez, Vanessa Hudgens, Alexander Ludwig, Charles Melton, Kate del Castillo, Nicky Jam, and Joe Pantoliano, who appear in supporting roles. It was produced by Smith, Jerry Bruckheimer, and Doug Belgrad. In Bad Boys for Life, Miami detectives Mike Lowrey (Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) investigate a string of murders tied to Lowrey's troubled past. A third Bad Boys film was discussed after the success of the second, with Michael Bay stating he would be interested in returning to direct, but budgetary constraints made going ahead difficult. The film went through several attempts to enter production over the course of a decade, with a variety of writers and directors attached. The project was eventually finalized and green-lit in October 2018, and filming began the following year, lasting from January to June 2019. Principal photography took place in Atlanta, Miami, and Mexico City. Bad Boys for Life was theatrically released in the United States on January 17, 2020, by Sony Pictures Releasing through Columbia Pictures. The film received generally positive reviews and was also a commercial success, grossing $424 million worldwide, which made it the second highest-grossing film of 2020. It is also both the highest-grossing and most well-received installment of the series and the biggest January release of all-time. Plot Isabel Aretas, widow of cartel kingpin Benito, escapes from a Mexican prison with the aid of her son Armando. Isabel sends Armando to Miami, tasking him with recovering a substantial stash of money his father Benito had hidden, as well as assassinating the people responsible for his father's arrest and eventual death in prison. Isabel demands that Armando kill Miami detective Mike Lowrey last. In Miami, Mike accompanies his partner Marcus Burnett to the birth of his first grandson. Desiring to spend more time with his family, the aging Marcus tells Mike he intends to retire, to Mike's chagrin. During a party celebrating Marcus' grandson, Mike is shot by Armando and left in a coma for months. Chastised by Isabel for targeting Mike first, Armando continues to assassinate other targets on his list during Mike's convalescence. Following Mike's recovery, he is determined to seek revenge and unsuccessfully attempts to recruit the now-retired Marcus, causing a fall out between them. Mike violently obtains the identity of arms dealer Booker Grassie from an informant. Realizing that Mike will not heed orders to stay away from the investigation, Captain Howard reluctantly allows him to work with the tech-driven team in charge, the Advanced Miami Metro Operations (AMMO), led by Mike's ex-girlfriend Rita. While the team surveils Grassie at an arms deal, Mike determines that the buyers intend to kill Grassie and intervenes, but fails to save him. Later, Marcus is called by Carver Remy, an old informant who believes the assassin is after him. Marcus contacts Mike and the pair travel to Carver, but are too late to save him. Armando escapes after a fistfight with Mike. Captain Howard later reveals his intentions to retire as well, offering advice to Mike that he needs to find a path forward in life. He is abruptly assassinated by Armando moments later. The captain's death pulls Marcus out of retirement, but he intends to work as a team with AMMO. They track down Grassie's accountant, who leads them to Lorenzo \\"Zway-Lo\\" Rodriguez. They infiltrate Zway-Lo's birthday party leading to a destructive car chase. Armando arrives in a helicopter to rescue Zway-Lo but kills him when he blocks Armando's ability to shoot the pursuing Mike. As he lines up a shot, Armando tells Mike \\"Hasta el fuego\\". Gunfire from Marcus creates cover for Mike, who lets go of the ladder and falls into the water below. AMMO is shut down because of the failed operation. In private, Mike reveals to Marcus that Armando may be his son. Before partnering with Marcus, Mike worked as an undercover officer in the Aretas cartel where he met Isabel. They fell in love and intended to run away together, using \\"Hasta el fuego\\" as a made-up secret catchphrase. Mike ultimately remained loyal to the police, realizing how dangerous Isabel had become. Despite Mike's opposition, Marcus and AMMO join him in Mexico City to confront her. At the Hidalgo Palace, Mike meets Isabel and scolds her for concealing the truth from him. A shootout quickly ensues between AMMO and Isabel's men. Marcus shoots the pilot of Isabel's support helicopter, causing it to crash into the central lobby and starting a fire. Marcus confronts Isabel, while Mike tries to explain the truth to Armando. Armando begins to beat up Mike, but he refuses to retaliate. Demanding the truth from his mother, Isabel confirms to Armando that Mike is his father. Realizing the task he spent a lifetime training for was a lie, Armando tries to protect his father, leading to Isabel inadvertently shooting Armando in the chest while aiming for Mike. Enraged, she attempts to finish Mike, but Rita intervenes and shoots Isabel, sending her falling into the flames below. Sometime later, Rita has been promoted to police Captain, while Mike and Marcus are placed in charge of AMMO. Mike visits a remorseful Armando in prison, offering him a chance to earn some redemption, which he accepts.

By August 2009, Columbia Pictures had hired Peter Craig to write a script for the sequel. In February 2011, Martin Lawrence stated that the film was in development. Following several delays, Jerry Bruckheimer announced in June 2014 that screenwriter David Guggenheim was working on the storyline for the sequel. Two months later, Lawrence said a script had been written and roles had been cast. The following year in June 2015, it was reported that director Joe Carnahan was in early talks to write and possibly direct the film. Sony Pictures Entertainment announced a short time later in August 2015 that there were plans for two sequels, with Bad Boys 3 scheduled for release on February 17, 2017, followed by Bad Boys 4 on July 3, 2019. In early 2016, Bad Boys 3 was pushed to June 2, 2017, with no update on the release date of Bad Boys 4. Producers had planned to begin production in early 2017. Another delay surfaced in August 2016, when, to avoid competition with the upcoming DC Comics film Wonder Woman, the studio pushed the film's release to January 12, 2018. It was also revealed that the film would be titled Bad Boys for Life. In an October 2016 interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Lawrence said filming might begin in March 2017. In December 2016, an updated release date for Bad Boys 4 was set for May 24, 2019. Sony announced in February 2017 that the film's release would be delayed for a third time to November 9, 2018. The following month, Carnahan left the movie due to scheduling conflicts. In August 2017, Sony removed the third film from their release schedule, and later in the month Lawrence said the film would not happen. Planning resumed in February 2018 as Belgian directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah were signed in place of Carnahan, and Smith and Lawrence were confirmed to reprise. Geek Worldwide reported that the third installment in the Bad Boys franchise would film from November 2018 to March 2019 in Miami and Atlanta, with the release date scheduled for January 17, 2020. =Casting= In October 2018, Variety revealed that Sony was close to green-lighting the film's production. It was reported in December 2018 that Joe Pantoliano would reprise his role as Captain Howard from the previous films. Kate del Castillo joined the cast in early 2019, and it reported soon after Theresa Randle would reprise her role as Marcus' wife, Theresa. =Filming= Principal photography began on January 14, 2019, in downtown Atlanta. Shooting also took place in Mexico City in April 2019, as well as in Miami, wrapping on June 7, 2019. Cinematographer Robrecht Heyvaert shot the film with Sony CineAlta VENICE digital cameras and Panavision Primo, G- and T-Series anamorphic lenses. =Music= The film was composed by Lorne Balfe, whose new music was integrated with Mark Mancina's themes from the first film. Both trailers for the film include a remix/mashup of \\"Bad Boys\\" by Inner Circle (the franchise's theme) and \\"Bad Boy for Life\\" by P. Diddy, Black Rob and Mark Curry. The official soundtrack album to the film, Bad Boys for Life: The Soundtrack was announced by its executive producer, DJ Khaled, and released on the same day as the film. Artists Black Eyed Peas and J Balvin recorded a song titled \\"Ritmo\\", released October 11, 2019, which served as a lead single for the film's soundtrack. The soundtrack also features tracks by Meek Mill, City Girls, Quavo, Rick Ross, Rich the Kid, Bryson Tiller, Nicky Jam, Daddy Yankee, Jaden Smith, Farruko, Pitbull, Lil Jon, Buju Banton, and DJ Durel. Marketing and release The first official trailer for Bad Boys for Life debuted on September 4, 2019, and its second trailer was released on November 5. Its world premiere was held at the TCL Chinese Theatre on January 14, 2020. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence arrived at the premiere driving a Porsche 911 Carrera 4S with the Bad Boys theme playing loudly from the car's audio system. Bad Boys for Life was theatrically released in the United States on January 17, 2020, by Sony Pictures Releasing. =Home media= Bad Boys for Life was released digitally in the United States and Canada through Premium VOD on March 31, 2020, before the end of the usual 90-day theatrical run. The film was released on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray, and DVD on April 21, 2020. Reception =Box office= Bad Boys for Life grossed $204.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $220.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $424.6 million, against a production budget of $90 million. It is both the highest-grossing film in the Bad Boys franchise and the highest-grossing film released in January. In the United States and Canada, the film opened opposite Dolittle, and was initially projected to gross $35–45 million from 3,740 theaters during its three-day opening weekend, for a total of around $48 million over the full four-day MLK weekend. After making $23.5 million on its first day (including $6.36 million from Thursday night previews), estimates were raised to $68 million for four days. The film went on to debut to $62.2 million in its first three days, and $73.4 million over four, the second-best opening for the holiday. It made $34 million in its second weekend and $17.7 million in its third, remaining in first place both times. The box office performance of this film was affected by movie theaters closures in mid-March because of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. After the easing of initial restrictions, the film was released in three Santikos Theatres locations in San Antonio, Texas on May 1, 2020. After a long delay, the film was released in China on August 14, and made $3.2 million in its first weekend. =Critical response= IndieWire described reviews for Bad Boys for Life as \\"mostly positive\\", while Screen Rant stated the critics were \\"generally positive\\". The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 77% based on 255 reviews, and an average rating of 6.22/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"Loaded up with action and a double helping of leading-man charisma, Bad Boys for Life reinvigorates this long-dormant franchise by playing squarely to its strengths.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 59 out of 100, based on 46 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A\\" on an A+ to F scale, equivalent to the first two films. PostTrak reported an average rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars, with 73% of their respondents saying they would definitely recommend it. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that \\"the third time really is the charm,\\" and added, \\"The two directors roll with ease between raucous comedy and raw drama, to considerable effect, just as they crank up the tension on any number of occasions, occasionally with palpably visceral impact.\\" David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a \\"B\\" grade, calling it a \\"fun, explosive, and even thoughtful action movie,\\" and wrote, \\"Bad Boys for Life doesn't aim to raise the bar on its genre or rewrite the blockbuster rulebook, but it's a blast watching Lawrence and Smith revisit these characters and find a sensible place for them in the current Hollywood landscape.\\" Sequel Following the opening weekend box office success of the film, Sony announced plans for a fourth installment, with Chris Bremner returning to write the script.

It was designed by A. L. & G. McCredie and built from 1888 to 1889. It is also known as Payne's Folly, St. Helen's School, Campbelltown-Camden Grammar School and Camden Co. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. On 22/11/2019 a concept development application was lodged covering Studley Park and part of the adjoining golf course for a staged development comprising demolition, restoration works to Studley Park House, construction of 2 story hotel and at-grade parking, construction of 4 residential flat buildings with 2-4 stories and basement parking as well as associated road access, vegetation removal, landscaping and civil infrastructure.  History  =Land grant(s)= Two early grants comprise the land today forming Camden Golf Course / Studley Park estate (what remains of it). These were made in 1810 and 1812. Prior to this John Macarthur received a grant on the southern side of the Nepean River of and this became known as Camden Park Estate. Governor Macquarie granted two of Macarthur's employees, John Condron and William Parrott (both convicts who subsequently obtained freedom) each in 1810 and 1812 respectively. These two grants, when later combined, made up the original enclosure of Studley Park. They were used for farming, the 1814 muster showing that Parrott (his land became known as 'Parrott's Farm') was a landowner with two convicts under his control whilst the 1822 muster records that Condron had cleared 26 of his 100 acres and owned three houses, twenty five cattle and ten pigs.GML, 2000, 7 William Parrot received the first grant on 1 January 1810. He arrived in the colony as a convict in 1791 and by 1807 was working as a shoemaker at Camden Park. The second grant was to John Condron on 25 August 1812. He was transported from Ireland arriving in 1800 and by 1806 was employed at Camden Park as a herdsman.Campbelltown City Council, undated. Both blocks changed hands a number of times in the 19th century. The only mention of any structures erected on either property (cited by Ray Herbert) is a carriage house that reportedly was erected on Condron's grant by Henry Ellison. The documents cited don't mention where this was situated and nothing remains of it today. The 1987 Conservation Plan (CP) includes this carriage house in a detailed chronology of the site, stating it was built and destroyed in a 1980s fire. It would appear that this is a confusion between the carriage house and the engine house/granary which burned down in 1982.GML, 2000, 7-8 The 1987 Conservation Plan goes on to state that the transfer of Condron's grant in 1878 from Henry Ellison to William Henry Thompson shows that there was a building on the original Condron grant. However it is unclear if this was the carriage house or not. The plan from 1840 shows that by this date Parrott's grant was mortgaged to a Mr Cooper and that three structures had been built on it. Two appear to be a cottage and outbuilding (possibly a stable belonging to a Mr Fitzpatrick and a single structure, most likely a cottage, belonging to a Dr Swayne), have been built on the grant facing the main road. A series of roads have been drawn on the block immediately to the east which represents the laying out of the town of Narellan. The closes one to Parrott's original grant appears to be the road which was later named Richardson Road. Also of interest is the church indicated east of Parrott's original grant which appears to be in the same position as the church which exists there currently. Ellison owned the Condron grant until 1878 when it was transferred to William Henry Thompson. In 1884 Thompson purchased the adjacent 100 acres originally granted to Parrott, thereby combining the two properties and establishing the original boundary of Studley Park.GML, 2000, 8 =1888-1902 Payne era - Studley Park= Advertising for a builder for Studley Park in the Sydney Morning Herald on 9 February 1889 On 2 October 1888 businessman William Charles Payne bought the combined property of 200 acres from Thompson for £1,400. He authorised A. L. & G. McCredie of Sydney to construct the house, stables and a granary/engine house. The engine house reportedly contained a steam traction engine and a dynamo which provided electricity to the house. A lengthy article in the Australasian Building and Contractors News edition dated 20 July 1889 described the project. It called the house a \\"picturesque looking villa-residence, in a light Italian style\\". A rendered drawing view of the house from the west incorporated the two floor plans produce by the McCredies at the time of construction. The original drawings are in the Mitchell Library as part of a collection of architectural drawings belonging originally to a William Keen. He was a Sydney architect born in England and trained at the Royal Academy School, London, before migrating to Australia in 1886. It has not been able to be ascertained if Keen was employed by A. L. & G. McCcredie. Payne named the property \\"Studley Park\\". Ray Herbert writes that Payne named it after a property near where his father-in-law lived at Ripon in England. He also writes that at the time of construction four workers' cottages were built near the main road. These were visible on an aerial photograph taken in 1947, three side by side fronting Camden Valley Way with the fourth a little further away to the west, in the north-eastern corner of the original Studley Park landholding. It seems unlikely that these were constructed for workers on Studley Park as the project seems too small to warrant separate workers' accommodation. The area where the cottages were was further subdivided during the 1970s, resulting in formation of Wilton Crescent and the surrounding modern residential development.GML, 2000, 8-9 There is no evidence Payne intended Studley Park to be a self-supporting farm. What is more likely is that it was established as a country retreat. Many such estates were established around the outskirts of Sydney during the latter half of the 19th century. Prosperity in the colony since the 1850s gold rushes had helped establish a class of wealthy merchants and business people who established such estates, thus imitating the behaviour of a similar class of people in England at the time. Within the Camden area a number of examples of gentlemen's country estates/residences were built in the 19th century. Structures such as Camelot at (nearby) Kirkham, Camden Park House, built for the Macarthur family, and Fernhill at Mulgoa to the north are examples. The main feature of these holdings was a grand house situated on a part of the landscape so as to be visible to neighbours and surrounding residences. The house at Studley Park is a good example of this, situated on a rise and equipped with a tower (Campanile) which enhances its visibility and makes it a prominent landmark in the area. The visibility and grandness emphasises the perceived importance of its owner and visually underlines their standing in society.GML, 2000, 9 Advertising for the school, 1908 Studley Park was built at the height of a housing boom. Due to its size, grandiosity and the cost incurred, it came to be known as Payne's Folly. At the back is a large block containing stables and coach house.https://www.walkabout.com.au/locations/NSWCamden.shtml Things to see Due to its elevation the house has clear views of (and its tower in particular can be viewed from) other colonial landmarks in the district such as the spire of St. John's Church, Camden, Camelot (formerly Kirkham), Harrington Park and Orielton estates.Read, S., pers.comm., 12 May 2008 The opulent mansion bankrupted Payne: he sold it in 1902 and it became Camden Grammar School. =Alternative history= Archibald Adolphus Gregory, circa 1935 Payne sold the house to its architect, Francis Buckle, in 1891 and Buckle sold it in 1902 to Dr Henry Oliver. Studley Park as a military facility, 1939 It became Camden Grammar School until 1933 when it was sold to Arthur Gregory, a Hollywood movie mogul. Gregory, a keen golfer, commissioned construction of a nine-hole golf course, later adding another nine holes. A few decades later it was transformed into an art deco playground for the sales manager of 20th Century Fox. During World War II it was resumed as the Eastern Command Training School for the army.Richardson, 2010 In 1951 the first intake of the newly-formed Women's Royal Australian Army Corps began training at Studley Park House. Today, Camden Golf Club owns and is restoring this lovely house. It is open to the public during the year on specially-planned open days and for functions to raise money for restoration. In 2009 the house was sold to a private owner and the golf course land was transferred to the care, control and management of Camden Council.Howard, pers.comm., 14 December 2010  Description  =Setting= The former Hume Highway (the main road south of Sydney once, now Camden Valley Way) was the original access to the site - an early set of gates are still visible on this road) abuts the grounds of the Studley Park / Camden Golf Club, to the west. Lodges Road (the current entry to Camden Golf Club) abuts the grounds to the east. The original Studley Park estate (1880s) was in the order of . The total remaining area today is , including golf course, land for flood mitigation works, house lot etc. Surrounding Studley Park House is Camden Golf Course. Behind the outbuildings are a range of Army era buildings (from WW2), the club house (adapted from and extending the coach/carriage house) of the Camden Golf Course, parking and landscaped areas of golf course. Two areas of woodland abut the Army era buildings east of the main house, and in the golf course's north-east corner towards Camden Valley Way. Including house, and former stables and carriage house block (Club House), located in the grounds of Camden Golf Course, Camden Valley Way and Lodges Road, Narellan.AHC, 1978 =Mansion - siting and composition= The Studley Park House is situated near the highest point of the ridge at the eastern section of allotment DP556856, Narellan. It could have been set further east, on the highest point, but to do so would have made it less visible from Camden Valley Way, formerly the Hume Highway, and from the neighbouring mansions Camelot and Kirkam, on the Cobbity Hills opposite. In order to impress those and other neighbours, it was set upon a mound at least 3m. high above ground level, was given an attenuated form, and topped with a tower with a peaked roof. The prominence and degree of visibility it achieved, which must have satisfied those who built it.Mayne-Wilson, 1999 At the golf course's centre is the house - a large towered mansion on the property built for W.C. Payne in 1889 at the height of a housing boom. Due to its size, grandiosity and the cost incurred, it came to be known as Payne's Folly. There is a wealth of iron lacework. The interior is as extravagant as the exterior with decorative joinery, elaborate ceilings and stained glass. At the back is a large block containing the stables and coach house. At the time of construction of Studley Park House, Camden Valley Way was the only road linking Camden to the city of Sydney, so that the access to the House had to be obtained via a carriage drive leading from it. The entry to the carriage drive was marked by a handsome gateway with white painted, decorated timber posts capped with finials and rails from which wire mesh was hung. The gateway was set in from the road, to allow adequate space for turning or to make way or stand by if another carriage was seeking to exit the property. The carriage drive, in the best 18th century practice, did not follow a straight line to the house but curved gently towards it, following the contours. As early photographs show, it was not originally planted with its present avenue of Cypress trees; these do not appear until some decades later - they appear in the historic photographs of 1935 as being about ten years old. That photograph also shows an attempt at infill planting at regular intervals, with protective posts and wire around young plants within, no doubt to keep them from being eaten by stock. The driveway curved gently at the gateway to the house yard, after which it curved again to the left of the house, before curving sharply to the right, giving visitors a close up view of the towering front. It then curved sharply again to the left, splitting to form a teardrop-shaped carriage loop in front of an elegant staircase. After depositing its passengers, the carriage could then proceed to the coachhouse at the back of the house, or return via the loop. Just after the entry gates to the House and before the Bunya Pine, a smaller road ran off the carriagedrive towards the north. This would have led not only to the engine house and shed, but also to Richardson Road behind St Thomas' cemetery, as mentioned in p. 24 of the Conservation Plan (CP). =Garden layout= Early photographs show very little planting in the House yard: just a few small trees plus a row of Pines to the south of it. The mature Bunya Pine at the front gateway may have been present in 1915 - the photograph is not easy to read - but most of the plantings were ornamentals from Britain. There were several of these about tall scattered randomly near the House, but it is not easy to determine the species. They appear to have comprised plants such as Cypresses, Laurels, Liquidambar and Citrus. Another of the mid 1930s photographs confirms this. The ground to the south of the House was largely clear, covered with a lawn, as it is today. The slopes of the mound on which the House sits appears to have been planted with sprawling shrubs such as Honeysuckle and Briar Roses, much as it is today. By 1933 the ground along the carriage drive within the homestead yard was planted with a deep border or shrubs. This pattern has been simplified today, but the essentials of the scheme have been retained. The 1935 photograph shows a couple of small trees along the \\"instep\\" of the carriageway curve, but it is doubtful that they were the same Crepe Myrtles present there today. One notable feature is that a side path led off the left of the carriageway towards the engine house and swimming pool, while a curved bed and path linked the tennis court to the point where the carriageway came closest to the house. The principal adornment to the House's garden during the 1930s, following its acquisition by Mr A. A. Gregory in 1933, was an elaborate pergola and lattice construction on a low earth platform in the southern sector of the garden, adjacent to the kitchen block and former dining room. The lattice screen walls were at least high and a doorway and a few steps gave access between the interior \\"garden room\\" and the lawn outside. We are fortunate to have a clear photograph of the interior of this garden room, which was itself divided into two linear spaces, one being defined by the pergola roof and lattice screen walls and intended for sitting within, and the other by screens in front of the kitchen block. The whole composition of lattice frames was held together by high, horizontal beams with a fringe of lattice below, a technique also used on the back garden. The ground was grassed, not paved, although a few large paving stones appear to be present in the centre of the seating area below the pergola. Some creepers grew up the screens, while most of the other planting were either in pots or herbaceous perennials of shade-tolerant species. Stag or elkhorn ferns were suspended from the screen walls at various places. An ornate Italianate fountain was located at the centre of a circular mound, which appears to been sited directly over, or close to, the original well (from which it no doubt drew its water). The inspiration appears to have been American, in keeping with the redecoration of the interior of the House in a \\"Hollywood\\" style. A somewhat similar, but lighter, pergola and screen structure was added to the front of the coachhouse and stables building, with a fringe of herbaceous plants around the bottom. A white post and rail fence also ran along the outside of the driveway in front of the pergola screen. Only remnant eucalypts were present in this part of the grounds. Few details exist of the garden to the north of the House, other than the post and lattice framework that defined what appears to have been a shrubbery (the plants are too substantial to be vegetables). A wide flight of steps leads up the mound or platform of the house into this area, which is defined on its outer boundary by a white post and rail fence. Another flight of steps leads from the front verandah down into that shrubbery.CP, p.17. A small tree, without leaves, appears in the roughly the location of the large Jacaranda present today, but it seems more like a dead eucalypt than a young Jacaranda. It is understood that a kitchen garden lay behind this shrubbery, and that an orchard once existed in the area now occupied by the Army buildings.CP, p. 16. However, according to the CP, this had been cleared by Dr Oliver between 1902-1919, possibly for use as a football field.CP, pp. 21-22. Contrary to the usual 19th century practice, the vegetation on the ridge to the north of the House was not cleared, and is visible in the 1915 and 1935 photographs. Those trees along the western boundary of the golf course had been thinned out and some appear to be regrowths after 19th century clearing. The land beyond the House grounds to the west and south was mostly covered with grass for grazing, with few trees left standing When that ceased, it was rough cut, being used as fairways for the golf course. The early dams were converted into water hazards for the golfers. Fencing As historical photographs show, the early fencing was post and rail, painted white, with wire mesh panels between. The tennis court fencing, although higher, was also treated in the same way. A white painted timber post and rail fence also ran along the outer edge of the carriageway, to ensure that vehicles did not stray over the fairly steep battered slope of the House's mound or platform. Tennis Courts A tennis court existed in the front yard/paddock to the south-west of the house from early on, although it is not clear whether this was built by the original owner, Mr. Payne, his successor Mr Buckle, or by Dr Oliver when the property was re-developed as a school after 1902.The CP indicates it was in existence by 1902 - see page 17, but it does not appear on its plan \\"The Original House, 1888-1902\\". This court, with its high fencing topped by white painted rails, would have been quite visible to visitors arriving along the carriage drive. However, being set sufficiently to one side of the house, on a distinctly lower level, and largely transparent, it did not actually detract from the presentation of the House itself. Subsequently, a second tennis court was constructed behind this, closer to the House and on a platform about higher than the first court. It is not clear from the CP when this was built, and by whom, but it does not appear in the photographs of 1935. However, the CP does refer to another tennis court, said to have been built opposite the coachhouse building and shown on the site plan \\"Private School 1902-1933\\". It is assumed that this would have been built during Dr. Oliver's tenure, but it also does not appear in photographs of this area in 1935. (One presumes that Mr Gregory was not much interested in tennis.) The Golf Course Insufficient evidence is available on the development of the golf course to say with certainty when it began. It would appear from early photographs, , that some golf was being played on the land to south and south-west of the House, and it seems likely that its evolution as a formal course was incremental. On page 37 of the CP, it states that a Mr K. C. Whyte acquired a grazing licence over of the site and planned to reconstruct the golf course (which confirms that it previously existed, although probably in an amateurish form). The CP then states that from 1948 \\"all but of the property were leased to the Camden Golf Club who, taking Whyte's idea, proposed to re-establish a golf course on the site\\". Renovations for the Golf Club began during 1949, but it was not until 1950, when Whyte's lease expired, that the Golf Club was granted a ten-year lease from the Army, with an option to renew for a further ten years. According to the CP, p. 38, \\"the lease of a large portion of the estate to the Camden Golf Club precipitated the destruction or alteration of large areas of the former landscaping\\". It is assumed that many of the plantings, especially of Jacarandas, Camphor Laurels and Eucalypts, as well as the shrubs along the carriage drive, were planted during this early period of \\"alteration\\". Perhaps taking its cue from the CP, p. 54, the same Club removed those Jacarandas between 1997 and 1999, in order to restore the visual prominence of the House and protect its foundations. However, while the Club also made some 'dramatic alterations\\"CP, p.54 to the landforms when redesigning the golf course, the continued existence of the extensive fairways has preserved the important vistas between the House and the main roads, in a broad arc from the south- west to the north-west. Statement of Significance The siting of the house on a platform on a prominent knoll towards the rear of the estate has a combination of historical, aesthetic and social significance, reflecting the practice of Victorian landowners of the boom period to display their wealth to all, to participate in a social rivalry with other major landowners in the district, and to enjoy the impressive visual catchments out to the south and around to the north-west. The carriagedrive and its entry gateways has a high degree of both historical and aesthetic significance, being the original access way to the House from 1889 and retaining its gently curving form and characteristic plantings throughout the last century (although some of the plantings are replacements from later periods). The curving form reflects 18th century landscape design, retained for use in providing different visual sequences to, and a final impressive display of, the grand House in the process of arrival. It also has a degree of social significance, being valued by the present community. The carriage loop has a moderate to high degree of historical and aesthetic significance, having essentially the same configuration as that of the original, although without the accompanying post and rail fence and associated plantings of Pine Trees. The grounds have a moderate degree of historical significance, generally retaining their original layout but having lost all the original plantings, pathways, and clearly defined functional areas (such as orchard, kitchen garden, and shrubbery). They have a minor degree of aesthetic significance in that they demonstrate the landscaping concepts of the early owners, even though the fabric and integrity has largely been lost. The pergola and lattice structures of the mid 1930s, though interesting and innovative, were not typical of either the overall landscaping concept of the House or of landscape design in New South Wales in that period. Although they reflected the taste and ideas of the American owner who redecorated the interior of the house in an art deco style, they were not a clear expression of that style with regard to landscape design. Rather, they gave the impression of an improvised Hollywood set. The post and rail fencing has mostly disappeared, but had historical and aesthetic significance as a clear example of a style favoured by wealthy Victorian and Edwardian landowners at the turn of the century, and as such, carried some social significance as well. They warrant reinstatement. The tennis courts (or at least their sites) have a moderate degree of historical and social significance, demonstrating a form of recreation favoured by landowners and schools for gentlefolk for the first three to four decades of the 20th century. They carry the potential to be restored to their former use. The trees on the site have varying degrees of significance, depending on their age and with which phase of ownership they were associated. Those of greater historical and aesthetic significance are the senescent Pine, old Camphor Laurel and a few old Pepper Trees originally planted () just beyond the south- west sector of the drive, and the mature Bunya Pine at the entrance to the House grounds. Some of the Cypresses along the carriagedrive also have a moderate degree of significance. The Jacaranda and the Liquidambar to the north and west of the House have a low degree of significance, being plantings by the Golf Club after 1950, as have the shrubs along the carriagedrive within the House grounds. The part regenerated, part remnant Eucalypt woodland to the north of the House has a moderate degree of historical, technical and aesthetic significance, demonstrating the original landcover of the property and its unusual retention despite its successive periods of quite different ownerships and land uses. Its existence as a rich textural backdrop and setting to the House gives it some aesthetic value, as does the screening it provides for the otherwise visually intrusive Army barracks. The golf course has historical and social significance as a valued recreation facility that has existed on the site in varying formats since the 1920s, and has high aesthetic value for continuing the role of the former grazing fields in providing a \\"forecourt\\" and setting to Studley Park House. =House= A fine example of a Boom style high Victorian mansion, set in a prominent location, with its outbuildings representing an important period in a series of large nineteenth-century houses in this region. Internally the house is important for its exuberant detailing, its central hall and staircase, and its stained glass window. Large towered Boom style mansion. External walls of heavily moulded cement render, encrusted with a profusion of debased architectural detail of vaguely Italianate character. Slate roof, imported Italian marble entrance stair. Large stained glass window in a tower with a moulded monogram. Victorian iron lace. Internally exuberant style of exterior is maintained, grand staircase with open first floor gallery, stained glass, fine woodwork. Due to its elevation the house has clear views of (and its tower in particular can be viewed from) other colonial landmarks in the district such as the spire of St. John's Church, Camden, Camelot (formerly Kirkham), Harrington Park and Orielton estates. = Stables = = Carriage House block = = War era barrack buildings =  Heritage listing  As at 24 March 2000, Studley Park is a place of State significance for its aesthetic and visual qualities associated with a very fine nineteenth-century country house and its setting and for its historic associations with important uses and historic themes of twentieth century development around Sydney. Studley Park House and associated historic lands that now form Camden Golf Club course are an important and comparatively rare cultural landscape that retains an open landscape character and setting for the House, typifying a grand, nineteenth-century country estate. This cultural landscape setting includes important views that physically connect Studley Park to other nearby historic \\"country estates\\" such as \\"Camelot\\" and \\"Kirkham Stables\\", and define a broader historic landscape in the areas surrounding Camden. Studley Park House is an excellent example of Victorian Italianate architecture, enhanced by its prominent location and open landscape setting. It is one of the last \\"country estate\\" dwellings to be built in the Camden/Campbelltown area and is representative of the work of the Sydney firm of architects A. L. & G. McCredie. It has fine internal spaces joinery and finishes. Subsequent phases of use of Studley Park provide evidence of important themes in Sydney's history, including school education, defense and recreation. Studley Park is associated with the development of school education at the end of the nineteenth century and of private school education in the Camden/Campbelltown area in particular. Studley Park was one of a number of places around Sydney associated with Australia's preparations for World War II and its activities and its preparedness after the War, including the establishment of the Women's Royal Australian Army Corps. The period of ownership of Studley Park House by Arthur Gregory in the 1930s is represented by its remaining \\"Hollywood\\" style internal finishes and is supported by high quality contemporary photographs. Gregory was the representative of the US film company Twentieth Century Fox in Australia. Gregory's use of Studley Park as a private residence, \\"golf-country club\\" and film theatre represent both connections to other uses of the place and some aspects unique to Gregory's ownership. The continued use of the place as a golf course since the 1930s is significant and has helped retain the landscape character of the place associated with its earlier country estate history. While compromised by modern additions, the former Stables building (current Golf Clubhouse) retains an historic and visual relationship with Studley park House and has the potential to be reconstructed in its original form. The archaeological resource of the site of Studley Park has the potential to contribute to an understanding of some aspects of the construction and maintenance of a substantial late-nineteenth century 'country estate'Godden Mackay Logan, 2000: 115 The site has natural heritage value in retaining two areas of regenerating remnant (endangered ecological community) Cumberland Plain Woodland including a population of the nationally endanaged shrub species, Pimelea spicata.Read, S., 2005 Studley Park was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Terranes accreted to the continent as a marine environment dominated the area through the Paleozoic and Mesozoic periods. Intense volcanism, the horst and graben landscape of the Basin and Range Province originating from the Farallon Plate, and both glaciers and valley lakes have played important roles in the region throughout the past 66 million years. Geologic History, Stratigraphy & Tectonics The oldest rocks in Nevada are in the East Humboldt Range in the northeast, with lead isotope data suggesting an age of 2.5 billion years, at the boundary of the Archean and Proterozoic. Metamorphic and igneous rocks formed 1.7 billion years ago underlie Clark County and the populous areas around Las Vegas. The region was part of the supercontinent Rodinia one billion years ago, situated at the equator. The continent rifted apart between 700 and 600 million years ago. No continental rocks exist in western Nevada from more than 700 million years ago, because the western part of the region was rifted away, becoming part of current day Siberia. =Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)= After the breakup of Rodinia, southern and eastern Nevada remained as a passive margin on the western edge of the proto-North American continent of Laurentia. Up to 20,000 feet of sediment accumulated along the new margin as it subsided, building up thick layers of sandstone, siltstone, limestone and dolomite. The Monitor, Egan, Schell Creek and Arrow Canyon ranges in the east are dominated by limestone and dolomite formed during 400 million years of marine conditions. Central Nevada by contrast, preserves shale, siltstone and chert formed under deep water conditions as fine ooze settled into deep water offshore. Continental collisions began to form the supercontinent Pangea leading to subduction along the western margin of Laurentia. As plates subducted, they spurred intense volcanic and tectonic activity, and volcanic island arcs and carbonate platforms accreted against the western shore. Dozens of terranes accumulated over 250 million year and many rock units were thrust on top of others as thrust sheets along thrust faults. Large granite bodies formed from magma. The Antler Orogeny, named by geologists in 1951 after Antler Peak on Battle Mountain, was an early orogeny mountain building event in the creation of the Basin and Range Province. The Antler highland, including the Roberts Mountains, formed as fractured deep ocean sediments were thrust upward. For the most part, the Antler Orogeny occurred in the Devonian and Mississippian, although it may have continued longer. One terrane that may have driven the orogeny is the Nolan Belt, an intensely folded mass of quartzite, schist and slate extending from Esmeralda County to the north, through central Nevada as far as the Mountain City and Bull Run Mountain area near Idaho. Hinterland and foreland basins filled with sediments as the Antler highland eroded. Sea levels rose over the eroded mountains in the late Paleozoic, although uneven rock surfaces remain as the Antler overlap sequence, which includes conglomerate, siltstone, limestone and sandstone deposited from the Pennsylvanian into the early Triassic. High concentrations of the rare element iridium and jumbled mega-breccia deposits in the Guilmette Formation, made up of shattered limestone that re-cemented in deep water, has led geologists to infer the Alamo meteorite impact even around 382 million years ago in the Devonian. Distinct gravel rubble is common in late Devonian rocks in the area, suggesting large tsunamis. Although an exact impact site has not been found, geologists have suggested a possible location in the Timpahute Range in southern Lincoln County, near Rachel, Nevada. Based on the distribution of debris, estimates suggest a crater one mile deep and 30 miles in diameter. Terranes continued to accrete, driving the Humboldt orogeny, first recognized in rocks in the Pinon Range in 1977, and Permian-Triassic Sonoma orogeny. During the Sonomo orogeny, the Golconda allochthon, a thick sequence of metamorphosed basalt, siltstone, shale, chert and limestone, was thrust on top of the Antler overlap sequence. It is named for the Golcondo Summit, where US Interstate 80 crosses Edna Mountain. Sonomia, the superterrane added to the region, includes several smaller terranes, including Walker Lake, Pine Nut and Paradise. =Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)= Plate convergence continued through the Mesozoic, with the addition of the Black Rock-Jackson terrane in the Jurassic and Cretaceous now present in northwest Nevada. The terrane rocks are volcanic or sedimentary and originated offshore in the Paleozoic and Triassic. By the end of the Mesozoic, dry land conditions prevailed across Nevada. The Farallon Plate transported the terranes and subducted under North America in the Cretaceous. Numerous thrust faults developed due to compressional strain, placing older rocks on top of younger units. In the northwest, the Luning-Fencemaker thrust fault developed in the Jurassic and thrust the Jungo terrane to the east, forming the undulating Nevadaplano. As the Farallon Plate subducted, the Sevier Orogeny generated large mountain ranges in the east. =Cenozoic (66 million years ago- present)= In the Mesozoic, the subducting Farallon Plate had produced magma and played a role in building the Sierra Nevada mountains, but by 60 million years ago in the Cenozoic, its downward angle decreased and it moved further eastward without producing magma. The plate produced shear stress at the base of the North American Plate, driving the Laramide orogeny, which created the Rocky Mountains. Due to conditions in the underlying crust, inferred to be a thinner section of the Farallon, intense volcanic activity began in the Eocene in northern Nevada around 43 million years ago, reaching the center of the state by the Oligocene and the south by the Miocene. The volcanism was some of the most intense in Earth history, ejecting 17,000 cubic miles of material in 250 major eruptions and layering the landscape in tuff ash falls thousands of feet thick. Extinct calderas up to 35 miles wide are preserved in the mountains of south-central Nevada, particularly near the Tonopah range, as well as in the Hot Creek, Monitor, Reveille and Kawich ranges. Welded ignimbrite formed as hot ash formed natural glass on rock surfaces. Violent volcanism continued in the southwest until seven million years ago, forming the ancestral Cascade arc, named for its similarity to the Cascade Range in the Pacific Northwest. Additionally, the Walker Lane—an area of northwest trending right-lateral strike-slip faults formed 12 million years ago—associated with some of the most intense eruptions, such as the 16 to 6.5 million year old Southwest Nevada volcanic field. During the last 10 million years, volcanic activity shifted to bimodal volcanism with basalt lava flows alternating with rhyolite domes. Dark gray to black basalt and pink or brown rhyolite are particularly common in Elko, Washoe and Humboldt counties. Some small cinder cones formed as recently as the Pleistocene and the Nye County Lunar Crater volcanic field was active only 15,000 years ago. In Nevada's recent geologic past, tectonic changes have created normal faults and creating the basin and range horst and graben terrain. Thinning of the upper crust caused deeper, highly metamorphosed rock masses to rise to the surface, where it is overlain by younger faulted and domed rocks. There are more than 24 metamorphic core complexes in the Basin and Range Province as a whole. In some cases, faulted blocks have shifted more than 50 miles from the apex of the dome. Along detachment surfaces, mylonite forms due to shear. The Ruby Mountains-East Humboldt, close to Elko, and the Snake Range, close to Utah, are the two most researched core complexes. At the time of the Pleistocene glaciations, Nevada experienced temperatures up to 15 degrees Fahrenheit lower, eight inches more of annual rainfall and lower evaporation. Although it was drier overall than many neighboring areas, glaciers did form in the Ruby Mountains and East Humboldt Range. Small areas of eastern Nevada in the White Pine, Grant Ranges, Snake and Schell Creek mountains were also glaciated, along with the Toquima, Toiyabe and Monitor Ranges in the center of the state. Geologists debate whether the 11,918 foot tall Charleston Peak was glaciated as well. Dozens of large lakes filled the valleys in the region, accumulating fine silt and developing alkaline chemical conditions that precipitated tufa calcium carbonate mounds. Lake Lahontan in the northwest was the largest lake overall and flooded up to 8600 square miles 14,000 years ago. The lake grew in three different phases, with volcanic ash and silt at its bottom. Today, Pyramid Lake is a remnant of Lahontan, where it was once over 900 feet deep. Elsewhere, Clover, Franklin and Waring lakes developed near the Ruby Mountains. Lake Railroad occupied Railroad Valley, while Lake Toiyabe and Lake Desatoya formed in Big Smoky Valley and Smith Creek Valley respectively. Natural resource geology Mining and mineral resources have played an important role in the state's past and present economy. Named the Silver State for silver deposits which spurred early settlement and statehood in the 1800s, Nevada is today the leading producer of gold in the US, mining five million ounces annually. In 2012, $10.5 billion of materials were mined, directly employing over 15,000 people. Gold-bearing skarn in the Battle Mountain region of northeast Nevada is an important target for mining. Up to 263 polymetallic veins contain sphalerite, galena, jamesonite and tetrahedrite. Polymetallic molybdenum, antimony, uranium, copper, gold zinc, lead and silver ores have been mined in the Reese River area since the 1800s. In 1961, Carlin-type gold deposits were discovered near Carlin, Nevada. Paleozoic limestone, formed at the ancient continental margin, contains nearly microscopic gold associated with pyrite and arsenic sulfides and particularly jasperoid in folds and faults. Over 200 million ounces of gold are known to be distributed in more than 100 Carlin-type deposits. The Carlin trend extends from the Pinon Range to the Tuscarora Mountains, an area 70 miles long and 10 miles wide. Epithermal, skarn, vein and Carlin-type deposits are also found in the neighboring Battle Mountain-Eureka trend to the southwest. Other sites of mining and mineralization include the Independence trend and Walker Lane trend. Nevada is the leading producer of barite in the US, particularly at the Greystone Mine in Lander County, where it is found in deep sea black shale and argillite.

By the mid-1930s, the family had returned to Fife, and Jarvie undertook an apprenticeship as a blacksmith in Dunfermline. As soon as he completed his apprenticeship, Jarvie was elected as secretary of his local branch of the Associated Blacksmiths', Forge and Smithy Workers' Society.

In addition, he was a delegate to Edinburgh Trades Council, and was chair of the council in 1954/55. Jarvie continued his rise to prominence by becoming the full-time East of Scotland District Secretary for the Blacksmiths, also spending time representing the shipyards on the River Clyde. In 1954, he was elected as assistant general secretary of the union, and then in 1960 he became the Blacksmiths' general secretary.

At the time of the September 11, 2001 attacks, David Emil was the president of the company that owned and operated the restaurant Windows on the World on the 106th and 107th floors of One World Trade Center, New York, New York. All the employees and guests at the restaurant during the attacks lost their lives, 79 of whom were Windows on the World employees. Soon after the attacks, David Emil co-founded, along with restaurateurs Waldy Malouf and Tom Valenti, Windows of Hope Family Relief Fund, a relief fund for families of victims in the hospitality business throughout the World Trade Center. Windows of Hope Family Relief Fund raised $25 million to provide on-going support for the children of victims. In 2002, David Emil opened Noche, a Latin-themed restaurant in the Times Square area of New York, with Michael Lomonaco as chef-director. Lomonaco had served as executive chef at Windows on the World at the time of the attacks. Education and public service David Emil, an alumnus of Yale College, graduated from Columbia Law School in 1977. In November 1978, David Emil and Anne Burley, a researcher from Amnesty International, visited Tehran as investigators on behalf of Amnesty International to interview political prisoners of the government of Mohammed Reza Pahlavi who asserted they had been tortured despite the regime's claims that torture had been discontinued. A report based on Emil's and Burley's investigation, published in January 1979, provided detailed accounts of torture endured by political prisoners. In the early 1980s, David Emil served as an assistant counsel to New York Governor Hugh Carey. From 1983 through 1988, Emil served as deputy commissioner and general counsel to the New York State Department of Social Services. In 1988, Emil was appointed president of the Battery Park City Authority on the recommendation of New York State Governor Mario Cuomo in October 1988. As Battery Park City Authority president, Emil oversaw the construction of Stuyvesant High School and North Cove marina on the 92-acre landfill site in Lower Manhattan. In 1994, Emil stepped down from the position at the Battery Park City Authority to enter the private sector. David Emil returned to public service in 2007 when Gov. Eliot Spitzer appointed him president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC), which had been formed in 2002 to support the revitalization of the downtown areas affected by the September 11th attacks and disburse Federal funds intended for the revitalization of the area. During his tenure as president, the LMDC and the Port Authority were in an ongoing dispute regarding 5 World Trade Center, ownership to which the LMDC had transferred to the Port Authority in 2006; the LMDC claims that the Port Authority owes the LMDC hundreds of millions of dollars in costs for preparing the site for development. The LMDC was also responsible for the demolition of the Deutsche Bank building at 130 Liberty Street, which had been damaged in the 9/11 attacks and acquired by LMDC in 2004 with the intention of demolishing it. Concerns about environmentally-safe methods of demolition were resolved in 2007. Bovis Lend Lease was contracted to demolish the building, and began doing so in 2007; however, a fatal fire that year caused the death of two firefighters and demolition was halted. OSHA determined Bovis Lend Lease had multiple safety violations including blocked and unmarked exits, a lack of fire extinguishers, and permitting smoking on the site, which investigators have determined to be the fire's probable cause. The Deutsche Bank building was finally demolished in 2011, and in January of that year, the LMDC sued Bovis Lend Lease for $100 million, seeking to retrieve funds it said were advanced to get the project started in 2006 as well as costs incurred with cost overruns. A resolution of a $50 million settlement from Bovis Lend Lease to Lower Manhattan Development Corporation was reached in March, 2015. David Emil took early retirement in 2010, but continued to lead the LMDC in an unpaid capacity to the present. Restaurant career In 1994, David Emil left his position at Battery Park City Authority to join legendary restaurateur Joe Baum as a partner in the Rainbow Room restaurant complex at Rockefeller Center as well as the renovation and reopening of Windows on the World on the 106th and 107th floors of the North Tower at the World Trade Center. Closed in 1993 after a terrorist bomb exploded in the World Trade Center garage, Windows on the World reopened in 1996 following a $30 million renovation under a 15-year lease with the Port Authority and a global-themed menu.https://ny.eater.com/2013/9/11/6547477/windows-on-the-world-new-yorks- sky-high-restaurant In 1997, under the culinary direction of new executive chef Michael Lomonaco, Windows on the World was awarded two stars by Ruth Reichl of The New York Times. A smaller restaurant in the complex, Wild Blue, was given one star by New York Times reviewer William Grimes in 1999. At the time of the 9/11 attacks, Windows on the World was operated solely by Night Sky Restaurants controlled by David Emil and his family. It was the highest- grossing independent restaurant in the country the year before the attacks, according to Restaurants and Institutions magazine, with $37.5 million in sales in 2000. In 1997, New York Times restaurant reviewer, Ruth Reichl, accorded three stars to the Rainbow Room under the new direction of chef Waldy Malouf. In 1999, Rainbow Room landlord, Tishman Speyer, did not renew its contract with the company led by Joe Baum and David Emil, and selected the Cipriani family to operate the Rainbow Room space. In 1999, Emil, Baum and former Rainbow Room chef, Waldy Malouf, opened Beacon Restaurant in mid-town Manhattan offering wood-fired cuisine. Beacon closed in 2012.

An urban historian, she focuses on changes to the built environment over time. Recently, her work has centered around the urban renewal period in the mid- twentieth century.  Background and education  Ammon began her studies in the fields of engineering and design, earning a B.S.E. in civil engineering from Princeton University and a Master of Environmental Design from Yale School of Architecture. She then went on to study history and American studies, earning a Master of Arts in history and a Master of Philosophy and Ph.D. in American studies, all from Yale.  Career  Prior to joining the faculty at Penn, Ammon was a visiting scholar at the American Academy of Arts & Sciences. She also held a number of fellowships, beginning while she was completing her PhD as a Whiting Fellow in the Humanities, Ambrose Monell Foundation Fellow in Technology and Democracy at the Miller Center of Public Affairs, and John E. Rovensky Fellow with the Business History Conference. More recently, she held the Sally Kress Tompkins Fellowship, which is jointly sponsored by the Society of Architectural Historians (SAH) and the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS). As a professor at Penn, she teaches a variety of courses in city planning and historic preservation. The courses range from introductory courses on planning history and historical documentation to leading advanced research courses to electives examining cities and sound and photography and the city. Ammon's involvement in her field extends beyond the classroom. She is an associated faculty member of the History Department and a member of the Gender Sexuality and Women's Studies (GSWS) Executive Board. She is a colloquium member of the Penn/Mellon Foundation Humanities + Urbanism + Design Initiative and a Faculty Fellow of the Penn Institute for Urban Research. Beyond Penn, she was an Andrew W. Mellon DH Fellow at the Price Lab for Digital Humanities, and from 2016 to 2017, she was a Mellon Researcher with the Canadian Centre for Architecture's \\"Architecture and/for Photography\\" initiative. Finally, Ammon serves on the board of the Society for American City & Regional Planning History (SACRPH). = Research = Ammon's research focuses on urban planning and the built environment since World War II, studying the changing landscape to reveal social, political, cultural, and economic patterns. Her work not only explores urban revitalization efforts in the twentieth century, but how carefully crafted narratives and images of the city, past and present, shape public perception. This interest connects with an additional interest in contemporary public history practice. Ammon's exploration of urban revitalization efforts led to her book Bulldozer: Demolition and Clearance of the Postwar Landscape, which explores the twentieth century idea that destruction would lead to progress. Connecting this work to historic preservation and public history, Ammon created the digital humanities project Preserving Society Hill. The project brings together sources such as public plans, historic photographs, oral histories, and memoirs to tell and make public the story of Society Hill in Philadelphia. She is pursuing similar research in Montreal. Ammon has presented her work at meetings of the Society for American City & Regional Planning History, Urban History Association, Association of Collegiate Schools of Planning, Policy History Conference, Business History Conference, and the American Studies Association. She has also contributed to radio programs, including WNYC's The Takeaway, WNPR's The Colin McEnroe Show, and KPFA's Against the Grain, as well as the PBS television documentary 10 Towns That Changed America. = Major Publications =  Books  *Bulldozer: Demolition and Clearance of the Postwar Landscape (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2016).Reviews:  *  Digital Public Humanities  *Preserving Society Hill: Sites and Stories of Urban Renewal in a Philadelphia Neighborhood, http://pennds.org/societyhill/ (launched 2018). *\\"Captioning Milton-Parc,\\" with photographs by Clara Gutsche and David Miller, in What You Can Do with the City (Canadian Centre for Architecture), October 20, 2017.

The aim of PheWAS studies (or PheWASs) is to examine the causal linkage between known sequence differences and any type of trait, including molecular, biochemical, cellular, and especially clinical diagnoses and outcomes. It is a complementary approach to the genome- wide association study, or GWAS, methodology. A fundamental difference between GWAS and PheWAS designs is the direction of inference: in a PheWAS it is from exposure (the DNA variant) to many possible outcomes, that is, from SNPs to differences in phenotypes and disease risk. In a GWAS, the polarity of analysis is from one or a few phenotypes to many possible DNA variants. The approach has proven useful in rediscovering previously reported genotype- phenotype associations, as well as in identifying new ones. The PheWAS approach was originally developed due to the widespread availability of both anonymized human clinical electronic health record (EHR) data and matched genotype data. At the same time massive genome and phenome data sets for model organisms were being assembled that also proved effective for PheWAS. PheWASs have also been conducted using data from existing epidemiological studies. In 2010, a proof-of-concept PheWAS study was published based on EHR billing codes from a single study site. Though this study was generally underpowered, its results suggested the potential existence of new associations between multiple phenotypes, possibly due to a common underlying cause. As of 2016, this study is the oldest PheWAS in the EHR-linked eMERGE database. This paper also coined the abbreviation \\"PheWAS\\". As of 2019, PheWAS in the EHR has been conducted using ICD-9-CM, ICD-10, and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes.

At least one family self evacuated due to the leak. At least 44 water wells nearby were contaminated from benzine in the gasoline, including a municipal well. A LF-ERW seam failure was suspected as the cause. Further testing revealed that at least 26 other areas on this pipeline needed repairs, with 22 within the Jackson Marsh Wildlife Area. * A 14-inch gas gathering pipeline exploded and burned on July 18 near Intracoastal City, Louisiana. There were no injuries or major property damage reported. * On July 23, a compressor station operated by Williams Companies in Windsor, New York was venting gas in a \\"routine procedure\\" — during a lightning storm — when the vent was ignited by lightning, causing a fireball \\"hundreds of feet into the air\\" * An Enbridge crude oil pipeline ruptured in Grand Marsh, Wisconsin, releasing an estimated 1,200 barrels of crude oil. The pipeline had been installed in 1998. Flaws in the longitudinal welds had been seen during X-ray checks of girth welds. * Four contract workers were injured during a flash fire at a Wyoming gas processing plant on August 22. * A jet fuel pipeline near Chicago began leaking on August 27. The burst pipeline spilled an estimated 42,000 gallons of jet fuel into a ditch that empties into the Calumet Sag Channel in Palos Heights, Illinois. External corrosion was the cause of the pipeline failure. * On August 28, an Atmos Energy repair crew struck an 8-inch gas main in McKinney, Texas, causing a fire. Four Atmos workers were treated for injuries. 1,000 Atmos gas customers lost gas service for a time. * On September 6, a 10-inch gas gathering pipeline exploded and burned near Alice, Texas. Flames reached 100 feet high, and caused a 10-acre brush fire. There were no injuries. * An explosion and fire hit a Crestwood Midstream Partners gas compressor station in Hood County, Texas on September 6. Heavy damage to a sheet metal building resulted, but there were no injuries reported to crew there. * A Colorado Interstate Gas gas compressor in Rio Blanco County, Colorado caught fire on September 11. There were no reported injuries. * On September 24, an excavator struck a 4-inch natural gas line on Route 416 in Montgomery, New York. Escaping gas ignited, and it took 90 minutes before the gas was shut off. There were no injuries. * On October 3, a Colonial Pipeline stubline leaked gasoline into in a marshy area of Moccasin Bend, about 1,000 feet from the Tennessee River, near Chattanooga, Tennessee. About 3,600 gallons of gasoline were spilled, with about 1000 gallons being lost. The cause was from previous excavation damage. * The operator of an excavator machine narrowly escaped serious injury in Lewiston, Idaho on November 19, when his machine hit a gas pipeline during road work. The resulting fire destroyed a railroad signal, along with several telephone poles, and road construction equipment. The depth of the pipeline has been misjudged at that location. * On November 20, about 38,000 gallons of crude oil spilled from an Enbridge pipeline at a tank farm in Mokena, Illinois. * Two men were injured in an explosion and fire at a natural gas production facility east of Price, Utah on November 20. * On November 23, a gas company worker looking for the source of a reported gas leak in a Springfield, Massachusetts strip club pierced a gas line. The gas later exploded, injuring 21, devastating the strip club, and damaging numerous nearby buildings. * On November 30, a heavy equipment operator punctured a 12-inch gas transmission pipeline, near the city of Madera, California. The adjacent highway, along with several rural roads, was shut down for hours, while houses and businesses in the area were evacuated. * A malfunction in a gas compressor caused a fire on December 4, north of Fort Worth, Texas. There were no injuries. * On December 5, a 16-inch gas pipeline at 500 psi of pressure exploded and burned near a natural gas plant in Goldsmith, Texas. A fireball 250 feet high was created after the explosion, destroying 12 to 15 utility poles, and caliche and rocks the size of bowling balls damaged a road. There were no injuries reported. * On December 11, at approximately 12:40pm, a 20-inch gas pipeline owned by NiSource Inc., parent of Columbia Gas, exploded along I-77 between Sissonville and Pocatalico, West Virginia. A piece of the pipe twenty feet long was blown out of the ground and had a longitudinal crack that ran the entire twenty feet. The escaping high-pressure natural gas ignited immediately. An area of fire damage about 820 feet wide extended nearly 1,100 feet along the pipeline right-of-way. Three houses were destroyed by the fire, and several other houses were damaged. There were no fatalities or serious injuries. The asphalt pavement of the northbound and southbound lanes of I-77 was heavily damaged by the intense fire. NTSB determined that the probable cause of the pipeline rupture was (1) external corrosion of the pipe wall due to deteriorated coating and ineffective cathodic protection and (2) the failure to detect the corrosion because the pipeline was not inspected or tested after 1988. Contributing to the poor condition of the corrosion protection systems was the rocky backfill used around the buried pipe.NTSB Pipeline Accident Reports, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation Pipeline Rupture, Sissonville, West Virginia, December 11, 2012, https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/pipeline.aspx, accessed 2018.01.09.

It lives in the western central and southwest Atlantic Ocean, from Nicaragua to Brazil. It grows to – long and is distinguished from other skates by its long, slender tail and absence of dorsal fins.  Description  The Atlantic pygmy skate has a width of and grows to a total length of about – , with the exact length varying slightly between different sources. In comparison to other skates, it is medium in size. The species' upperbody is pale brown in color, sometimes containing spots, and its underside is brownish pink. It has a darker tail, typically a dark shade of brown, and a black caudal fin. The species' tail is extremely long and slender for a skate and is completely absent of dorsal fins; these factors make the species easily distinguishable from other skate species in the area. It has a large number of denticles on its dorsal disc, completely covering it. Male specimens have thorns on their anterior disk as adults and females have them in the middle of their tail and disc. In addition, males adults have claspers, which are thin and long. It has a number of other notable characteristics as well, including a long caudal fin, long pelvic fines, large eyes, a short snout, and an arched mouth.  Behavior and habitat  The Atlantic pygmy skate exhibits oviparity, laying its eggs in pairs. Young obtain their nutrients through yolk as embryos. The shells on the species' eggs contain projections in the shape of horns. It is a demersal fish, living at the bottom of the sea floor. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) it is found in waters – in depth, although FishBase states that it has a much more restricted range of – .  Distribution  The Atlantic pygmy skate lives in the Atlantic Ocean, with its distribution ranging as far north as Nicaragua and as far south as northern Brazil. In total, it covers the countries of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Panama, and Venezuela. The species is bathydemersal and lives on the continental slope. Little is known about the species' population and threats; therefore, no conservation actions are currently taking place for the species and it is listed as data deficient by IUCN as of 2007.

The experiment studied magnetic plasma confinement to support controlled nuclear fusion experiments. Specifically, STX pioneered the possibility of forming a Field-reversed configuration (FRC) by using a Rotating Magnetic Field (RMF).  Background  FRCs are of interest to the plasma physics community because of their confinement properties and their small size. While most large fusion experiments in the world are tokamaks, FRCs are seen as a viable alternative because of their higher Beta, meaning the same power output could be produced from a smaller volume of plasma, and their good plasma stability.  History  The STX was built in 1998. The STX was motivated by a discovery from an unrelated experiment; a few years previously, the Large-S Experiment (LSX) had demonstrated the existence of a kinetically stabilized parameter regime which appeared advantageous for a fusion reactor. However, the LSX experiment formed FRCs in a power-hungry, violent way called a theta-pinch. The US Department of Energy funded the Translation Confinement Sustainment (TCS) program as a follow-on to the LSX program, but it had not yet begun when the STX started operation. The purpose of TCS was to see whether Rotating Magnetic Fields could sustain FRCs born of the theta-pinch method, but the question remained as to whether RMF alone could form FRCs. If so, this was expected to be a lighter, more efficient means of FRC formation. This was the question that the STX was meant to answer. The STX was contemporary with the following RMF-FRC experiments: The TCS, the PFRC, and the PV Rotamak.  Relevance to spacecraft propulsion  NASA funded the construction of the experiment. This is because FRC-based fusion reactors appear to be well-suited to deep-space fusion rockets, especially those formed by RMF. This concept is similar to the Direct Fusion Drive, a current research project to create a fusion rocket from an RMF-driven FRC fusion reactor.  Apparatus  The STX vacuum vessel was made of quartz, as it needed to be non-conductive to allow the RMF to pass through. It was 3 meters long and 40 centimeters in diameter. The axial magnetic field was created by electromagnetic coils and was 100 Gauss in strength. The RMF was created by a novel solid-state RF amplifier which was designed to be more powerful and more efficient than preceding Rotamak experiments. The RMF system as run operated at 350 kHz, at 2 MW of power, far below its design rating. To measure the plasma's behavior, the STX experiment was fitted with an insertable magnetic probe, an array of diamagnetic loops, an interferometer, visible-light spectroscopy diagnostics, and a triple Langmuir probe.  Contributions  The STX experiment was able to use RMF to achieve temperatures of 40 eV, which is hotter than the surface of the sun but still a factor of 500 from the temperatures necessary in a fusion reactor. The STX experiment was able to achieve plasma density of 5 \\\\times 10 ^ {12} particles per cubic centimeter, which is a factor of 200 from the temperatures necessary in a fusion reactor. While the STX was designed to demonstrate the formation of an FRC using RMF, it had more success in demonstrating the build-up and sustainment of FRCs created via the theta-pinch method.  Shortcomings  An FRC plasma is harder to heat at low temperature. Because of this, the RMF system on the STX was designed to produce dozens of MW at the beginning of the discharge to rapidly heat the plasma beyond this so-called \\"radiation barrier\\" to hundreds of eV of temperature, where the plasma could be more easily sustained. However, problems with the novel solid-state RF amplifier led to only a fraction of this power being available for heating. As a result, rather than the hundreds of eV hoped for, only 40 eV of temperature was achieved. Furthermore, it was initially hoped for that the plasma could be kept away from the walls of the vacuum vessel by using low-resistance loops of copper that fit snugly around the vessel called \\"flux conservers.\\" However the plasma was often observed to be in contact with the 40 cm inner diameter quartz vessel.  Legacy  The findings of STX were used to improve the TCS experiment, which eventually did demonstrate FRC formation solely from RMF. The TCS went on to heat the plasma to 350 eV. The idea of using an RMF-driven FRC to create a fusion rocket persists to this day. One example is the Direct Fusion Drive.

Pollock made his debut in first-class cricket in 1939, when Ireland played Scotland at Dublin. He resumed playing first-class cricket after World War II, touring England in 1947 when he played in both first-class matches on the tour against Derbyshire and Yorkshire. He featured in first-class cricket until 1958, playing a total of 23 matches; twenty of these came for Ireland, with Pollock also playing two matches for the Marylebone Cricket Club and one for the Free Foresters. Recognised as one of the best batsman in Ireland during this period, he scored 1,036 runs in first- class cricket at an average of 25.26, and a high score of 129, which was his only first-class century. He played his club cricket for the North of Ireland Cricket Club, who he played for into the 1960s, eventually retiring from playing due to a bad back. He remained active in Irish cricket following his retirement.

It was designed and built from 1820 to 1834; and was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 March 2010.  History  =The Cowpastures= When the first fleet arrived in Sydney Cove in 1788 they found the soil unsuitable for farming and soon looked towards the heavy clay and loam soils of the Cumberland Plain (to the west) to sustain the colony. Early agricultural settlements were located on the rich alluvial soils of the Nepean, Hawkesbury and Georges River areas, as well as South Creek near and at the head of the Parramatta River where the settlement of Rose Hill (later Parramatta) was established about six months after the fleet landed. A settlement at the Hawkesbury was established in 1794. By 1804 much of the Cumberland Plain had been settled and Governor King began to look for other regions in the colony for favourable arable land. The only suitable land within the Cumberland Plain was the area known as the Cowpastures, located in the southwestern corner. This area was named after the discovery in 1795 of cows from the first fleet which had wandered off into the bush. The Cowpastures had remained unoccupied due to the official decree that reserved the land for the wild cattle (to encourage their increase). In December 1803 Governor King and Mrs King visited the Cowpastures for themselves and the Sydney Gazette reported that Mrs King was the first \\"white lady\\" to have crossed the Nepean River. The track to the Cowpastures led from Prospect and on 17 September 1805 James Meehan, under instructions from Governor King, commenced a survey of the track from Prospect to the Nepean Crossing and a rough road followed the marked line. This became known as Cowpasture Road, later the Hume Highway, most of which is today part of the Camden Valley Way. Several visits to the area by the colonial gentry took place at this time, which resulted in their desire to acquire some of this rich land for themselves. They saw the area as containing very good grazing land. Captain Henry Waterhouse described the area in a letter to John Macarthur in 1804 as follows: \\" I am at a loss to describe the face of the country other than as a beautiful park, totally divested of underwood, interspersed with plains, with rich luxuriant grass\\". Earlier Europeans had described \\"large ponds covered with ducks and the black swan, the margins of which were fringed with shrubs of the most delightful tints\\". The Europeans thought the flats were perfect for cattle and the hills would carry sheep. They admired the absence of underbush - probably achieved through Aboriginal burning off - and felt comfortable with a landscape that reminded them of an English gentleman's park. John Macarthur received the first land grant in the Cowpastures region in 1805 for his role in the early wool industry in the colony. Lord Camden rewarded him with and Macarthur chose the highly coveted Cowpastures for his grant, though Governor King tried to prevent him from taking it. Macarthur also organised a grant for his friend Walter Davidson, who allowed Macarthur to use his land freely after Davidson returned to England. In this manner, Macarthur controlled of riverbank on the site where the wild cattle had first discovered the best pasture near Sydney. Later purchases and exchanges increased the Macarthur land there to over , an endowment that Governor Macquarie greatly resented. Other early grants were in the Parishes of Minto and in adjoining Evan, Bringelly, Narellan and Cook. These all lay west of Parramatta.Godden Mackay Logan, 2012, 20-21 Governor Macquarie drew up plans in 1820 for the establishment of a town in the area, to be named Campbelltown after his wife Elizabeth's maiden name. With their forced return to England in 1822 these plans never came to fruition and it was not until the arrival of Governor Darling in 1827 that plans were again reinstated and the first settlers were allowed to take possession of their townland in 1831. In the early 1850s the railway line from Sydney to Goulburn was completed, with a station opening at Campbelltown in 1858. When Leppington House was offered for lease in 1865, one of its selling points was that it was near a railway. Campbelltown now provided easy access to Sydney and its markets and grew as the centre of the district. Although Camden was established in 1836, with no railway line it remained a small town. The large estates that flanked Cowpasture Road (later Camden Valley Way) and the Northern Road were run largely as sheep and cattle farms, with wheat and other grain crops being grown as well until the 1850s. The houses were often built on surrounding ridges or hills, providing sweeping views of the countryside and ensuring that any passing traveller could appreciate the owner's status by viewing their impressive country mansions from the road. This land use pattern of large farm estates and small towns, established in the nineteenth century, remained largely the pattern of development of the area up until the late 1990s. Aerial photographs of the area in 1947 show a rural landscape with some limited urban development on either side of (then) Camden Valley Way.Godden Mackay Logan, 2012, 22-23 =Raby= Raby, consisting of of land, was granted to Alexander Riley in 1816, whose principal place of residence was at Burwood. Riley came to NSW in 1804 and, after serving as storekeeper and magistrate in Tasmania and Secretary to the colony in Sydney, he resigned. In addition to farming (particularly sheep farming), he became a prosperous trader, his Sydney partnership with Richard Jones aided by links with Alexander's brother Edward Riley in Calcutta and W. S. Davidson in Canton. In 1816 Edward Riley joined Alexander in NSW and the following year Alexander returned to England where he became an agent for colonial trade. Through his knowledge as a British agent for the colonial wool trade, Riley recognised the importance of the quality of wool and decided to invest in 200 Saxon merinos. His nephew, also named Edward, helped select the stock in Germany and accompanied them to the Colony in the George Osborne in 1825. Although the farm buildings at Raby had been neglected by his brother during the intervening period and there was a period of severe drought, Edward Riley jnr was able to foster the herd. In 1827 and for the following three years Raby's Saxons eclipsed all others at the Australian Agricultural Society's Annual Shows. In December 1817 Raby was leased to George Cribb of Sydney, butcher. There are two renditions of Raby from the 1820s - Joseph Lycett produced an idealised view of Raby for his \\"Views in Australia\\" (1824) and a pencil drawing by W. Mason. Both views show a house on the property - a single storey farmhouse set in a cleared paddock surrounded by eucalypt forest. It is thought that this was built in . Lycett's romanticised view of Raby mentions the farm upon the Cowpasture Road leading to the Nepean, at the distance of from Sydney. Helen Proudfoot quotes the following description:Proudfoot: 33 According to MurphyAugust 1990: 37 the house was one of the best and most substantial of the early houses in the district. It is thought to have been located in approximately the same position as the present house.Biosys, 2008 One hundred sheep were brought out from Germany by Alexander's son William Riley and by 1830 the family venture had proved successful. A further 4000 hectares was granted to them by the Colonial Secretary and they applied for land near Yass, naming the property Cavan. William Riley was an astute stud breeder and wrote a paper with W. H. Dutton. In 1834 Baron Von Hugel, while overlooking the success of the sheep- farming, referred to Raby in his New Holland Journal as \\"The large property of a young man named W. E. Riley Esq., whose father introduced Tibetan goats here which, as I hear, thrive well but have not been profitableClarke: 298 That same year, Dr Lhotsky referred to Raby as one of the most famous farms in the colony.Lhotsky: 72 By 1830, William Edward Riley, Alexander Riley's son, had taken over the management of the property.Kass, 2002: 10 In 1833 Alexander Riley died, leaving his property to his son. W. E. Riley married Honoria Rose Brooks, a daughter of Richard Brooks of Denham Court. The couple had two children. The family lived principally at Raby, but was also at times based at Cavan, the Riley property at Yass.Kass February 2002: 10 Notes in the Riley papers refer to the painting of a paling entrance at the White gate, and to spikes for the bridge rails at the white gate.Kass February 2002: 31-32 The location of the gate and the bridge is not specified. In 1836 William Riley was killed in a riding accident and it appears that his father Alexander Riley largely withdrew from his Australian interests, as indicated by the selling his sheep. However, the Riley family retained ownership of Raby until 1866. The farm was leased to a number of people over this time. Edward Moore and his descendants were the next owners of Raby. A. R. Riley had mortgaged the property, and in 1866 it was sold on behalf of the mortgagors. It was bought by William Moore, grazier, of Booligal on the Lachlan River.Kass February 2002: 14 It is possible that the Moore family was in occupation of the property before the purchase. Edward Moore was a weaver from Manchester,indicted as a convict for possessing one forged bank note. His wife Elizabeth (who he had married at St. George's church, Southwark, London, in 1814) was convicted at the Lancaster Assizes of possessing three forged bank notes. On 21 March 1818, she and husband were sentenced \\"to be transported to some parts beyond the seas for the term of 14 years\\". Moore arrived in NSW in 1818, leaving behind his wife and their two children. Elizabeth arrived as a convict on the Lord Wellington in January 1820, with the children. She was listed as a cook, aged 31, though she was really 37. She and 5 year old Joseph and Ellen, nearly 3 were in rude good health. In March 1820 Moore petitioned Governor Macquarie for a ticket-of-leave, given for good behaviour and to encourage convicts to earn their own living by working for an employer. His employer, Robert Lowe, said he worked soberly, honestly and diligently. By the 1828 census, he had added Robert, Edward Lomas, James and William to the family. He also cleared of land at Macquarie Fields, of them under crop. In 1830 a second daughter, Elizabeth was born and Edward bought a farm, Drummondville, about out of Liverpool, growing hay for the teamsters coming to and from Sydney. By about 1835, when he leased Raby from the Riley estate near Campbelltown (now Catherine Fields), Moore was doing very well. The Moore family entertained Governor FitzRoy on his hunting expeditions at Raby. The FitzRoys gave the Moore family a French ormolu mantle clock in the shape of a lyre, in black and gold. It is today at Ellensville, .Alexander, 2004, 8,10,20-33 Margaret Browne (née Riley) grew up at Denham Court, Ingleburn, which had a prominent colonial garden. Browne was the first woman to write a book on gardening in Australia, under the name Mrs Rolf Boldrewood. She wrote letters to the much older Ellen Foreman (née Moore), who lived with her parents at Raby, Catherine Field and later established Ellensville, Mount Hunter. These letters survive and have been published as a book by Pacita Alexander, showing the ties between the colonial properties of the Cumberland Plain and hints of the influence of those places on the shared joys of gardening.Morris, 2014, 27 A plan of Raby drawn up in 1866 shows that the property consisted of . A note on the plan mentions that \\"The fences on this property are evidently very old indeed some portions especially on the north- western boundary have been renewed but the stumps of the old posts are visible\\". A structure may be shown in the location of the house. A gate is indicated in roughly the same location as the present entrance. William Moore carried out improvements on the property, including clearing and fencing. It seems that he managed Raby as a mixed farm.Kass February 2002: 15 The present house dates from , with the original house being retained for a time for use as a kitchen. An alternate view places the construction of the present house in the 1860s. William Hardy Wilson illustrated the barn and wrote about the \\"ancient house of Raby, which stood beside the barn has been replaced by one ornamented with florid ironwork in the style of the 1880s\\".Wilson, 1920 Photographs from the 1880s and 1890s show an alteration to the spacing of the ground floor verandah iron posts around the front door (to not match the alignment of posts above), two frames for climbing roses flanking the front verandah, and extensive garden beds with roses in them.Stuart Read, pers.comm., 6/12/12 After the death of William Moore in 1905, the estate was subdivided and offered for sale (with part of it being retained by A. B. Moore). A. B. Moore retained ownership of the estate until 1935 when the property was transferred to Florence Mitchell. The Mitchell family restocked the property with Merino sheep and Hereford cattle. In 1957 Lot 1 was resubdivided; Lot F contained the main homestead farm, and comprised . The Mitchell family retained ownership of Raby until 2003, however, the property was not occupied during the 1990s. The extant Raby estate although much reduced from its original landholding, remains a notable pastoral landscape, with the homestead overlooking the creek, enclosed by surrounding hills and dales on part of the original 1816 land grant.  Description  View of Raby from Camden Valley Way =Farm= Raby retains farmland adjoining a tributary of South Creek and Camden Valley Way. The house is well set back from Camden Valley Way up a slight rise to the west, along a curving drive, across a small bridge and splayed entrance gates and fences to Camden Valley Way (the east). Farm elements that remain include a small burial ground/cemetery/grave on a small knoll visible from Camden Valley Way, the homestead, outbuildings, paddocks, entrance gate and layout and early fencing which defines part of the eastern boundary of the original grant. The original grant boundary (to the east/Cow Pasture Road/Camden Valley Way) is still identifiable and is marked with old post and rail fencing. The southern boundary appears to be largely intact from the original grant. Old fence lines / estate layout is discernible within the paddocks and the current farm layout. Tall she oak trees (Casuarina cunninghamiana) line Riley's Creek (a tributary of South Creek to its west) just north of the house. Pockets of remnant / regenerating Cumberland Plain Woodland (an endangered ecological community) are elsewhere on the farm, for instance along the southern boundary. Some large remnant trees are along the Camden Valley Way eastern boundary, and road reserve. There is a fine view of the estate and homestead group from the north (across Riley's Creek) similar to early (archival) view(s). Other views to the homestead group are available travelling south along Camden Valley Way from high up the next ridge to the north, and once Riley's Creek is crossed, travelling south, looking west. A fine view is available from the vicinity of the gates to Camden Valley Way where old gate posts and fencing remain. A century plant (Agave americana) clump is along Camden Valley Way south of the main Raby driveway entrance. Some mature forest red gums (Eucalyptus tereticornis) line Raby's (western) side of Camden Valley Way. Nearer the house mature honey locusts (Gleditsia triacanthos) and nettle trees (Celtis australis) may reflect earlier lines of shelter belts from the farm or specimen planting.Stuart Read, visit, 6/12/12 =Outbuildings= Outbuildings remain on the property, although some such as the watchman's bark hut, two storey barn (illustrated by William Hardy Wilson in 1920) and the original Raby homestead are gone (at least, above ground remains are gone). A brick cottage, extended at its rear (west) as a carport, dates to the original 1820s homestead complex and later served as the house's kitchen. Furthern north of it was a separate oven. Further west another cottage is clad in ripple iron. =Garden= Raby in its garden setting The garden surrounds the house and comprises a number of remnant plantings. In 1990 it was characterised by tall trees and some remnant garden beds. Significant trees some dating to the mid Victorian period included native cypress pine (Callitris sp., possibly C.columellaris), stone pine (Pinus pinea), Brazilian peppercorn (Schinus molle var areira), Canary Island palm (Phoenix canariensis), Monterey pines (Pinus radiata), hedges of privet (Ligustrum sp.) (one remains south-west of the house) and Chinese trumpet creeper (Campsis grandiflora), as well as Cape plumbago (P.capensis), kaffir lilies (Clivia sp.) and red hot pokers (Kniphofia uvaria). Colocasia sp. taro plants line the southern edge of the house along with Cape plumbago. On the south-eastern corner of the house lot where the drive enters a stone pine (Pinus pinea) and native cypress pine (Callitris sp., possibly C.columellaris) frame that entry. North of the house are some remnant hedges of Cape honeysuckle (Tecomaria capensis), oleander (Nerium oleander) a mature mulberry (Morus sp.), and more honey locust trees and suckers. A bulb patch contains what appears to be Crinum x powellii, with large fat bulbs. Evidence of glazed terracotta garden bed edging tiles and drainage tiles is still evident in the garden. A beehive well sunk into the lawn north of the house remains but has been rendered on its top. North-west of the house a trumpet creeper (Pandorea ricasoliana) grows near a gate leading to home paddocks and outbuildings. West of the house a belt of mature plantings comprise mainly Monterey pines (Pinus radiata), some Canary Island date palms (Phoenix canariensis), Brazilian pepper trees (Schinus molle var areira) and African boxthorn, possibly used as hedging in the past (Lycium ferocissimum). =House= Side view of the house The imposing two storeys mid Victorian painted brick house , is characterised by a low pitched hipped, slate roof with several prominent brick chimneys. It formerly possessed double verandahs with lacework balustrading, flat cast iron columns and concave corrugated iron roofing. Some of the original cast iron fabric survives on site. The homestead retains multi-paned double hung windows and an impressive front door. A two-storey service wing is attached to the south-west corner of the house. = Condition = As at December 2003 the house and other built structures were in a poor state of repair. Raby has archaeological potential in regards to the remains of the original Riley house . The immediate vicinity of the site may also contain domestic day to day relics and/or scatter deposits that may relate to the Riley period of occupation. The Superintendent's House mentioned by Joseph Lycett in 1824 is likely to be the original main house, which is thought to be on or very near the site of the existing house. Whilst much of the extant house structure remains sound, some sections do have major defects. Although the original land grant has been subdivided, the homestead group is sited on what remains of the original 1816 land grant. = Modifications and dates = *1816land grant of 3,000 acres to Alexander Riley. *{spaced endash}}original house built.

It is in the first generation of Facebook Technologies' virtual reality headsets, and the company's first device in the category of standalone VR headsets, which was a new category at the time of the Go's release. The Oculus Go was unveiled on October 11, 2017 during the Oculus Connect developer conference, and released on May 1, 2018. Xiaomi launched their own version of the headset in China as the Mi VR Standalone on May 31, 2018. The Go is an all-in-one headset, meaning it contains all the necessary components to provide virtual reality experiences and doesn't need to be tethered to an external device to use. It is equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset and a single 5.5-inch LCD display with a resolution of 1280 × 1440 pixels per eye and a refresh rate of 72 or 60 Hz, depending on the application. The headset uses Fresnel lenses that are improved over those used in the company's previous headset, the Oculus Rift, and provide a field of view of about 101 degrees, which gives the Go a display fidelity of pixels per degree. Input is provided with a wireless controller that functions much like a laser pointer. The headset and controller utilise non-positional 3-degrees-of-freedom tracking, making it capable of seated or static-standing activities but unsuitable for roomscale applications. The headset uses the Android mobile operating system and includes applications for watching both traditional and immersive video and other media from various sources, such as Facebook and the headset's internal storage, as well as streaming services such as Youtube, Netflix, and Hulu. Additional software is provided via the Oculus Store, a digital distribution platform created and maintained by Facebook Technologies. The headset was announced on October 11, 2017 and released on May 1, 2018 to generally positive reviews. By July 2019, the Go was estimated to have sold over two million units. On June 23, 2020, Facebook Technologies announced it would be ending the sales of the Oculus Go later that year and would not accept new Go apps or app updates into the Oculus Store after 4 December, 2020.  History  Facebook Technologies' involvement in creating a portable form factor headset dates back to the company's early days as Oculus VR. While in discussion with Samsung about displays for the Oculus Rift, Oculus's then-CEO, Brendan Iribe, was shown a mock-up phone holder headset that Samsung wanted help developing. Oculus agreed to a partnership with Samsung, and in 2014 the result was publicly revealed as the Gear VR Innovator Edition. While Samsung built the hardware, Oculus developed the necessary application software, the Oculus Mobile SDK, tracking sensor firmware, and optimized Android and the required GPU drivers for virtual reality. The application software developed by Oculus for Gear VR included Oculus Home, a portal for accessing virtual reality content, an app store called the Oculus Store, and Oculus Cinema, an application for watching movies in various virtual environments. The Oculus Store was later used as the app store for the Oculus Go. In 2015 Oculus Cinema was replaced by Oculus Video, an app with similar functionality that was also included with the Oculus Go at the headset's launch. The Oculus Mobile SDK was later utilised to also allow development of software for the Oculus Go and Xiaomi Mi VR. Rumors of an all-in-one Oculus headset first surfaced in July of 2017 when Bloomberg reported that later that year Oculus would announce an affordable virtual reality headset that didn't need to be tethered to a PC or a phone. Codenamed \\"Pacific\\", the device would be lighter and more powerful than the Samsung Gear VR and aimed at the use cases of gaming, social networking, and watching videos and movies. It was also reported that the device would be equipped with a mobile Snapdragon chip from Qualcomm, and that Oculus would be partnering with Chinese electronics manufacturer Xiaomi to produce the headset. The device would carry Oculus's branding worldwide with the exception of China, where a custom version of the headset would be Xiaomi- branded and run some Xiaomi software. Hugo Barra demonstrating the Oculus Go on stage at 2018's Facebook F8 conference The headset was officially announced under the name Oculus Go on October 11, 2017 at the Oculus Connect developer conference and was slated to ship in early 2018. Facebook Technologies introduced the device as its first entry into the at-the-time new product category it called \\"standalone\\", a class of virtual reality headsets that don't require an external computing device like a smartphone or a personal computer to function. Oculus's partnerships with Qualcomm and Xiaomi, as well as Xiaomi's version of the headset called the Mi VR Standalone, were revealed in January at CES 2018. The Go was officially released on May 1, 2018. Xiaomi released the Mi VR Standalone on May 31, 2018. On 3 May 2018, Facebook announced a business-oriented bundle of the Oculus Go with commercial warranty, a worldwide multi-prong charger, and two facial interfaces. The bundle began shipping in July 2018. In September 2018, Walmart announced the company would be using Oculus Go headsets to expand its employee VR training program across the U.S. The company would be sending four headsets to every Walmart supercenter and two units to every Neighborhood Market and discount store, with over 17,000 units in stores by the end of 2018. In January 2020, Facebook lowered the Go's price to US$149 and US$199 for the 32 GB and 64 GB models respectively, down from the launch pricing of US$199 and US$249. Similar price updates were rolled out to all countries where the Go was sold. In the same month, the company also dropped the Oculus Go from its upcoming Oculus for Business program, in which the headset had been available during the platform's closed beta stage. On June 23, 2020, Facebook Technologies announced it would be ending sales of the Oculus Go later that year and would not accept new Go apps or app updates into the Oculus Store after 4 December, 2020. While new features would no longer be introduced to the headset, the system software would continue to be maintained with fixes and security updates through 2022.  Features  = Software = A video from the user's point of view, showing the use of the Oculus Go's user interface and the purpose of the Oculus Gallery application For setting up the Oculus Go, the Oculus application must be downloaded on a mobile phone running Android or iOS. With the Oculus application, the headset is paired to the phone, connected to an account, and the controller is paired with the headset. Applications and content can be downloaded and purchased from the Oculus Store with both the Oculus phone application or from within the headset itself. While pictures and videos can be transferred to the Go from a PC via USB and applications can be sideloaded to the device, many applications require a Wi- Fi connection to function. Official applications provided with or available for download include Oculus Gallery, Oculus Video, Oculus TV, and Oculus Venues. The Oculus Gallery app can be used to access media stored on the Go's internal memory or from external websites or services such as Facebook, Instagram, Dropbox, or a Wi-Fi-connected media server such as Plex. Oculus Video allows the viewing of trailers, movies, or one's own videos in various virtual environments. The Oculus TV app is used to watch TV in a virtual living room environment via various apps such as Facebook Video, Pluto TV, Netflix, and Hulu. Oculus Venues allows the user to attend live events. The Go's Casting functionality allows the headset's view to be streamed to the phone paired with the Go. An application called Oculus Rooms was present at the headset's launch, but was discontinued on October 25, 2019. Oculus Rooms was a customizable personal and social space into which users could invite friends to play various board games, listen to music, watch videos, TV, and movies, and play multiplayer games together. = Hardware = Front view of the Oculus Go controller, showing the touchpad, two front-facing buttons, and a trigger Unlike mobile headsets like the Samsung Gear VR and Google Daydream that are powered by a smartphone, the Oculus Go is a standalone unit with all the components required to provide virtual reality experiences built into the headset. The headset uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 system on a chip, 3 GB of LPDDR4 RAM, and either 32 or 64 GB of internal storage. The integrated Adreno 530 GPU provides roughly 500 GFLOPS of graphics performance. The device is equipped with a 2600 mAh battery, which provides up to two hours of gaming or 2.5 hours of video playback according to Oculus. The Go has non-positional 3-degrees-of-freedom tracking, a proximity sensors for detecting when the headset is being worn, and a small controller that functions like a laser pointer in the virtual environment. The headset is outfitted with a fast- switching 5.5-inch LCD display with a 2560 x 1440 (1280 × 1440 pixels per eye) resolution in an RGB-stripe subpixel arrangement. The headset has a field of view of about 101 degrees, which gives it a horizontal pixel density of pixels per degree. The headset uses Fresnel lenses that are improved over those used in the Oculus Rift and according to Oculus, were the best lenses the company had produced at the time of the Go's release. The headset doesn't feature physical interpupillary distance (IPD) adjustment and has a fixed lens distance of 63.5 mm, which according to Oculus best accommodates users with an IPD between 61.5 and 65.5 mm. The Oculus Go controller is a wireless, orientation-tracked remote controller with pointer capabilities that is used to interact with applications and games. In addition to a touchpad, the controller has three buttons that can be used to select things, go back to a previous screen or menu, and return to the Go's home screen. The controller is powered by a single AA battery and allows for either hand to be chosen to function through the Oculus Go. The Go is available in two storage configurations: a model with 32 GB of internal storage for US$149 or 64 GB of internal storage for US$199. While the Go doesn't support external storage, support for USB flash drives via the device's microUSB port was initially planned to be released as an update. However, in November 2019, John Carmack stated the feature wouldn't be released due to a hardware issue Oculus was unable to fix. Oculus offers accessories and replacement parts through their website, including a carrying case and a fitted facial interface for people with low nose bridges and high or wide cheekbones. A replacement controller and facial interface are also available. In addition, Oculus promotes the online eyewear retailer FramesDirect.com as a source of prescription lenses for the Go. Oculus also offers a business-oriented bundle with additional accessories, warranty, and support.  Third-party variants and accessories  In January 2019, TPCast announced TPCAST Air for the Oculus Go, a wireless solution that allows VR content to be streamed to the headset from a PC using Wi-Fi. The Air is aimed for architecture, engineering, and construction industries as well as interior design and education, and is shipped together with an Oculus Go headset. In February 2019, virtual reality porn producer BaDoinkVR began selling Porn In-a-Box, a 32 GB Oculus Go model pre-loaded with adult content. The content is accessed via an app pre- installed to the device by BaDoinkVR.  Reception  The headset released to generally positive reviews. Critics praised the Go's design and feel, display, built-in speakers, and reasonable price, while criticising its lack of fast charging, limited motion tracking and lack of expandable storage. Software and content had reviewers divided, with some reacting positively to the amount of third-party apps and content available for the device at launch, while others saw the software selection as slim and criticised its quality and the lack of a killer app. CNET characterised the headset as \\"VR for the masses\\" – a view echoed by other publications – while The Verge stated it was \\"the best that simple mobile VR has ever been\\" and \\"good, but not great.\\" In May 2018, Andreas Hronopoulos, CEO of adult entertainment company Naughty America, described the Go as \\"a game changer\\" and said that the company had seen an increase in sales of VR content since the Oculus Go went on sale earlier that month. Xavi Clos, head of production at BaDoinkVR, expected the device to act as a major gateway to the company's content and described the Oculus Go as \\"the perfect porn device.\\" = Sales = While official sales numbers haven't been released, according to IDC the Oculus Go and Xiaomi Mi VR had sold nearly a quarter million units combined during the third quarter of 2018. During Facebook's Q4 2018 earnings call, the company's CFO revealed that the Oculus Go had contributed to the company's revenue during the quarter, but had also increased marketing costs. In January 2019, market analysis firm SuperData estimated that over a million Oculus Go units had been sold since the device's launch, and in July 2019 the firm estimated over two million units had been sold. In his keynote at 2018's Oculus Connect developer conference, John Carmack revealed that the Go's retention rate was as high as the Rift's, something that nobody at the company had predicted. Carmack also noted that the Go had done especially well in Japan despite the device's lacking internationalization support and the company not specifically catering to the Japanese market. During 2019's Oculus Connect, Carmack noted that the Go's retention rate had been measured to be more than twice that of the Samsung Gear VR.

Similarly to its predecessor, the Oculus Go, it can be used wirelessly as a standalone device with its own integrated hardware (based on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 system- on-chip, running games and software from the Oculus store using an Android- based operating system. It also utilizes Oculus Touch controllers, which are tracked via an array of cameras embedded in the front of the headset. The cameras are also used as part of the safety feature \\"Passthrough\\", which shows a view from the cameras when the user exits their designated boundary area. A later software update added \\"Oculus Link\\", a feature that allows the Quest to be connected to a computer via USB, enabling use with Oculus Rift-compatible software and games. The Oculus Quest has received positive reviews for its price and convenience, and for having improved fidelity over its precursor, Oculus Go, but was panned for its front-heavy build and downgraded graphics quality over PC-based VR games. At launch, it also faced criticism for being limited to software available on the Oculus Store, and not having backwards compatibility with Oculus Go software. The later addition of Oculus Link led to reappraisals of the Quest, with critics praising the device's increased flexibility.  History  At Oculus Connect 3 in 2016, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed that Oculus was working on a standalone virtual reality headset codenamed Santa Cruz. The following year, at Oculus Connect 4, Oculus said that they are aiming at sending out software development kits in 2018. They also revealed the accompanying controllers which would be similar to the Oculus Rift's touch controllers. In 2018, Oculus revealed at Connect 5 that the system would be priced at US$399 and that it would be called the Oculus Quest. At F8 2019 it was announced that the Quest would ship on May 21, 2019. At launch, the device was priced at US$399 for the 64 GB version, and US$499 for the 128 GB version. A successor model, the Oculus Quest 2, was announced on September 16, 2020. It was released on October 13 starting at $299 for the 64GB version and $399 for the 256 GB version.  Hardware  The Oculus Quest has a similar design to the Oculus Go, but it features a more powerful graphics chip, active cooling and six degrees of freedom tracking (compared to the Go's three). The headset weighs , compared to the original Oculus Rift, which weighed . The battery life is around 2–3 hours. = Screen and lenses = The Oculus Quest uses two diamond Pentile OLED displays, each with an individual resolution of 1440 × 1600 and a refresh rate of 72 Hz. The headset uses the \\"next generation\\" lens technology originally introduced in Oculus Go, which helps to enlarge the sweet spot of the lens. Visual artifacts such as god rays are less prominent but still visible in scenes with high contrast. It also features physical interpupillary distance (IPD) adjustment. = Tracking = The Oculus Quest features the same inside-out tracking system used in the Oculus Rift S, named Oculus Insight. On the Quest, the system relies on four wide angle cameras located on each corner of the headset to spatially track the headset. = Controllers = Oculus Touch right hand controller The Oculus Quest uses the same second generation Oculus Touch controllers used by the Oculus Rift S. To accommodate the new inside-out tracking system, the tracking ring in the new controllers has been moved to the top of the controller, whereas in the older Oculus Touch controllers it was located on the back. This serves the purpose of making the rings visible to the tracking cameras in the headset. = Audio= The Quest's headband features built-in headphones, with two 3.5 mm audio jacks embedded in the headset, allowing the user to use external headphones.  Accessories  Though the Oculus Quest has built-in audio, it is possible to purchase official in-ear headphones from Oculus. There is also an official travel case. Following the release of the Oculus Link feature, Oculus released an official -long fiber optic USB-C cable designed for use with the feature  Software  = Software compatibility = Oculus launched the headset with over 50 titles consisting of a mix between new and previously known games, including titles such as Beat Saber, VRChat, Superhot VR, Moss and Robo Recall. Some games such as Rec Room and VRChat allow for cross-platform multiplayer. Compatibility with 50+ popular Oculus Go games was announced during Oculus Connect 6, additionally users who had already owned paid Oculus Go apps would be upgraded to the Oculus Quest equivalent for free. Support for selected Oculus Go games was added in software version 9. = Passthrough = Oculus Passthrough is a feature of the Oculus Quest which allows the user to see the real world in monoscopic black and white through the built-in cameras. This is primarily used as a safety feature; when a user exits their defined playing area, the display will switch from virtual reality to Passthrough. At Oculus Connect 6, an update for the Quest was announced that would upgrade this Passthrough system to the same Passthrough+ as the Oculus Rift S, making it stereoscopic and stereo-correct. A \\"Passthrough on Demand\\" feature was added in version 15 of the Quest system software, allowing the user to quickly access Passthrough by tapping the left or right side of the headset twice. = Oculus Link= At Oculus Connect 6, Oculus announced Oculus Link, which allows the Quest to work tethered to a PC via a regular USB-C cable and run PC VR games, including both Oculus and Steam VR games. Oculus Link can be used with USB 3.0 or 2.0 cables (the latter without concurrent charging). Due to voltage drop, non-active conductive USB cables can only be a maximum of 3–4 meters long; to allow for a longer tether Oculus launched a 5-meter fiber optic cable of its own. The feature was rolled out with version 11 of the Quest software, on November 12, 2019 and the official cable went on sale on January 8, 2020 in all countries in which the Oculus Quest is sold. = Hand tracking = During Oculus Connect 6, it was announced that hand tracking would be added via software to the Quest in early 2020. However, on December 9, 2019, Oculus announced the release of full independent hand tracking demos, as well as an update to the SDK to utilize hand tracking, ultimately releasing the demos on the 11th of December with software version 12.0. This feature allows users to interact with the virtual world using just their hands. The system uses machine learning to analyze the inputs from the four cameras, which allows it to recognize the location and pose of the user's hands. Hand tracking was officially released for the Oculus Quest in software version 17, released on May 18, 2020. = Oculus Move = On September 16, 2020, while announcing the Oculus Quest 2, Facebook also announced the up-and-coming release of Oculus Move, a fitness tracking software to be included in the new model.  Reception  Scott Stein of CNET considered the Quest to be \\"improbably amazing for its size and $399 price tag\\", and compared it to Nintendo Switch in terms of convenience. Stein praised its camera system and motion controls, and its graphics quality for being nearer to PC-quality than Oculus Go (albeit still limited in detail due to its use of mobile computing hardware). The Quest was panned for being a closed platform at launch — with software limited to the Oculus Store, and not being backwards compatible with software released for Oculus Go. Adi Robertson of The Verge shared similar opinions, noting that the Quest was heavier and not as comfortable as Rift S, and that its launch titles were not at the same calibre as the PC Oculus Rift in terms of size or graphical fidelity, but that the Quest still included a physical IPD slider unlike the Rift S. In May 2020, The Verge acknowledged that the Quest had improved since its launch to become \\"the closest thing that exists to a sleek, almost mainstream VR headset\\", citing an expanding software library, and the ability to use the headset with a PC over USB via the Oculus Link feature (or over Wi-Fi using sideloaded third-party software, which was not \\"noticeably worse\\" than doing so over USB in their experience). It was argued that the Quest \\"works so well by itself that it's a great system in its own right\\", while Oculus Link allowed it to double as a \\"credible\\" PC VR headset as well. Again, it was noted that the Rift S was less front-heavy and that its display \\"trades contrast for slightly higher resolution and refresh rate\\" — but that neither it or the Valve Index \\"works as a perfectly good standalone wireless VR headset\\" like Oculus Quest. =Sales = Two weeks after launch, Oculus announced that it had sold $5 million worth of content for the Oculus Quest. At Oculus Connect 6, it was announced that the Quest had created over 20% of the generated revenue from all platforms at Oculus, totaling at $20 million. It was also reported during the same event that the Quest has by far the highest retention rate of all their headsets. 317,000 units were sold over the 4th quarter of 2019, and was sold out at times.

Embedding relational interval arithmetic in a logic programming language differs from other constraint logic programming (CLP) systems like CLP(R) or Prolog-III in that it does not perform any symbolic processing. BNR Prolog was the first such implementation of interval arithmetic in a logic programming language. Since the constraint propagation is performed on real interval values, it is possible to express and partially solve non-linear equations.
