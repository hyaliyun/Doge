Its early businesses were located at the bottom of the hill, near the railroad depot, but most of the houses were built higher up on the hillside. This elevation difference complicated movement between the two sections of the community, so in 1903 the Hillsdale Steps were built on the hillside to improve foot transportation.The Hillsdale Steps, Indiana Historical Bureau, n.d.

Life He was born in Dungarvan, County Waterford, Ireland on 19 January 1877 to Michael Power and Bridget Hannigan. Upon the death of his father, his mother married Dennis O'Malley and the family moved to Dublin, where he studied at the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art. He took the name O'Malley in honour of his much loved stepfather. Emigrating to New York at the turn of the 20th century, O'Malley did book illustrations and covers for Life, The Literary Digest, Harper's and Puck. He traveled to the west coast where he advised John Ford on film settings and reportedly painted sets for Cecil B DeMille's epic The King of Kings. In 1904 he married Ruth Yeaton Stuart, the daughter of an Alexandria, Virginia judge. The couple moved to France, where he continued his work and study in art. After twenty-three years, the marriage ended in divorce. The couple had two children, Theo, who died in infancy, and is buried in Bailey's Bay, Bermuda, and Ruth Power-O'Malley, born in 1906 in Bailey's Bay, Bermuda. Ruth Power-O'Malley was a well-known writer of short stories and screenplays during the 1940s. Her novel Mrs Cassatt's Children was published by Houghton Mifflin in 1943. It is based on the story of her Virginia family, who settled in Jamestown, Virginia in 1607. Ruth Power-O'Malley is buried near her brother in the Outerbridge family grave in Bailey's Bay. Power O'Malley made regular painting trips home to Ireland, most notably to Achill Island in County Mayo. His first exhibition was held in 1913 at the Gaelic League Hall on Rutland Square (now Parnell Square), Dublin. One of his paintings, the dreamy portrait The Fisherman's Daughter (Munster), was the frontispiece for the December 1912 issue of The Irish Review, then edited by Padraic Colum and Mary Colum. Exhibition locales included New York City, Fort Worth, Los Angeles, San Antonio, London (Beaux Arts Gallery) and the Crawford in Cork (1940). In 1924, he won first prize at the Aonach Tailteann exhibition in Dublin for his painting The Old Quarry. He was listed as a member of the advisory board of editors of a later version of The Irish Review published in 1934, which included George Lennon (1900-1991) of Dungarvan, former commanding officer of the West Waterford IRA Flying Column (1919-1921) as business manager. At this time, either in Taos, New Mexico or New York City, he most likely met republican guerrilla leader and author (On Another Man's Wound, The Singing Flame) Ernie O'Malley. The late 1930s also found him in Bermuda. He died in New York City in 1946, after an illness of two years. A 2002-2003 exhibition of his paintings was held at Iona College in New Rochelle, New York. A 2010 exhibit at St John Fisher College, Rochester, New York included Power O'Malley paintings from the collections of granddaughter Marietta Whittlesey and Ivan Lennon. In 2015 the Irish American Heritage Museum of Albany, NY presented the exhibition Visions of Ireland: The Artwork of Michael Augustine Power O'Malley. Additional paintings and other works are held by granddaughters Alexina de Koster and Ann Copeland. Peter Murray, Curator of the Crawford Municipal Art Gallery in Cork, remarked that \\"in many ways, Power O'Malley is one of the forgotten artists of Ireland in the twentieth century… The capacity of Ireland so easily to forget those who have emigrated is perhaps unsurprising in a country that saw millions emigrate to the United States in the nineteenth century, only to witness a similar, if less desperate, mass exodus in the twentieth…\\" References *Power O’Malley *Magazine Cover Artists Category:Irish artists Category:American artists Category:1870 births Category:1946 deaths ","title":"Power O'Malley"},{"id":"8862690","text":"The Spanish Maquis were Spanish guerrillas exiled in France after the Spanish Civil War who continued to fight against Francoist Spain until the early 1960s, carrying out sabotage, robberies (to help fund guerrilla activity), occupations of the Spanish embassy in France and assassinations of Francoists, as well as contributing to the fight against Nazi Germany and the Vichy regime in France during World War II.Marco, Jorge: Guerrilleros and Neighbours in Arms: Identities and Cultures of the Anti-fascist Resistance in Spain. Brighton, Sussex Academic Press, 2016 Overview Referring to the contribution of the Spanish Maquis to the French resistance movement, Martha Gellhorn wrote in The Undefeated (1945): Also during World War II, Spaniards assassinated the German generals von Schaumberg (commandant of the region around Paris) and von Ritter (a recruiter of forced labor). In October 1944 a group of 6,000 maquis including Antonio Téllez Solà invaded Spain via the Aran Valley but were driven back after ten days. Few details of the maquis' actions in Spain have been made public because of the secrecy of the Franco government, but guerrillas, including Francesc Sabaté Llopart, Jose Castro Veiga, and Ramon Vila Capdevila were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Guardia Civil (Civil Guard) officers, and uncountable acts of industrial sabotage. Between 1943 and 1952, 2,166 maquis were reported arrested by the Civil Guard, nearly wiping out the movement. Etymology Sallent, Barcelona, Spain, commemorating the actions of the maquis The term maquis comes from the French term maquis, which in turn comes from the Corsican term macchia, the maquis shrubland, a type of biome found in the Mediterranean basin, mostly associated with Corsica. In France, the term was first used to refer to a group of guerrillas of the French resistance against the German occupation of France during World War II. The resistance fighters in these encampments were referred to as maquisards. History The anti-Franco guerrilla resistance in Spain began before the 1939 end of the Spanish Civil War. The outbreak of World War II so soon after the civil war surprised a large part of the Spanish Republican exiles in France; many of them joined the French Resistance. By 1944, with the German forces in retreat, many of the guerrillas refocused their fight towards Spain. Despite the failure of the invasion of the Val d'Arán that year, some columns continued to progress into the Spanish interior and to connect with the groups that had remained in the mountains since 1939. The apogee of guerrilla action was between 1945 and 1947. After this, the repression from the Franco government intensified, and little by little the groups were destroyed. Many of their members died or were incarcerated. Others escaped to France or Morocco. In 1952, the last important contingents evacuated from Spain. After that, those who resisted in the mountainous regions refusing to choose either exile or surrender, fought only for their own survival. =Beginnings= The origins of the maquis in Spain lie with those who fled the advancing forces of Franco's Nationalists. The insecurity engendered by the repressive tactics of the Nationalist insurgency turned their political opponents—even many who were not politically active but simply known to sympathize with the republic—into fugitives. At first many hid in relatives' homes, but some sought refuge in the mountains. Their numbers were enhanced by deserters and by escapees from prisons and concentration camps. These constituted the nucleus of those who decided to keep fighting from the mountains. The political character of the guerrillas was as varied as that of the Popular Front, containing communists, socialists, and anarchists. Despite the diverse ideologies, due to the organizational persistence of the Communist Party of Spain until 1948, the Communists dominated the other currents. =XIV Cuerpo de Ejército= During the war, the idea of the possibility of a guerrilla war at the rearguard of Franco's Nationalists was proposed. The idea came to fruition at the initiative of Juan Negrín, at the time head of the Republican government and of the Ministry of Defense. He created the XIV Cuerpo de Ejército Guerrillero (Guerrilla Army Corps) in October 1937. This name was used for the Basque section of the Spanish Republican Army until the collapse of the front in the north. The short-term objectives of this Corps were the interruption of the communications and supply lines to the Nationalist troops, and the carrying out of special operations. In the long term, they were to continue the war against Franco in the case of defeat on the conventional fronts. At the end of the war, such activities had been set in motion on the fronts of Teruel, Andalusia, Extremadura, and Toledo. The action with the greatest significance was the liberation, on May 23, 1938, of 300 Asturian political prisoners in Granada. Throughout 1938 and 1939 the Corps brought together many of the exiles of Andalucía and Extremadura; however, the Republican defeat brought the dissolution of the Corps. =Retreat: the French camps= Hundreds of thousands of Republican soldiers and civilians crossed the French border ahead of the advancing Nationalist troops in Catalonia. Once on the other side, they were put in concentration camps by the authorities. There were 22 camps in total: Barcarès, Agde, Saint- Cyprien, Argelès-sur-Mer, Berck-Plage, Montpellier Chapallete, Fort Mahon Plage, Tour de Carol, Septfonds, Baste-les-Foages, Bram, Haros, Gurs, Vernet d'Ariège, Rivesaltes, Fort Colliure, and Rieucros in Metropolitan France and, in French North Africa, Camp Morand, Meridja, Djelfa, Hadjerat-OM'Guil, and Ain-el-Curak. In these camps, exiles began to reorganize themselves into guerrilla groups. In the camp of Argelès-sur-Mer a series of meetings were held. Members of the PCE and the Juventudes Socialistas Unificadas (Unified Socialist Youth) participated. In October 1940, the decision was made to organize anti-fascist actions in France, together with the French resistance, against the Vichy government. This was the beginning of the Spanish involvement on a grand scale in the fight against the occupation of France. =Resistance= On October 11, 1940 the Vichy regime started the Companies of Foreign Workers (Compagnies de Travailleurs Etrangers, CTE), which permitted prisoners to leave the concentration camps, if they would go to work in factories. This increased the possibilities of escape. Shortly after the Vichy regime established the Obligatory Work Service (Service du travail obligatoire, STO) for French citizens, with similar objectives: to provide manual labor to armament factories and the construction of the Atlantic Wall. Those French who were released through the STO began to escape to the mountains, where they came together with Spanish who escaped from the CTE. The French escapees were mainly civilians, rather than a remnant of the defeated French army. From this time, the French term \\"maquis\\" began to be used to refer to the camps, and \\"maquisards\\" for those that occupied them. =Formation of the AGE= Some of the Spanish refugees joined French resistance groups, while others formed autonomous groups. In April 1942 a meeting of several Spanish combat groups decided to take the name of the XIV Cuerpo del Ejército de Guerrilleros Españoles, considering themselves the Corps' successors. In May 1944 the XIV Corps re-formed as the Agrupación de Guerrilleros Españoles (AGE, roughly Spanish Guerrilla Group), because they consisted for the most part of Spanish combatants on French soil. This conveyed the group's distancing from the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans (FTP), the armed branch of the French Communist Party, with whom they had previously worked closely. By this time, the Spanish resistors had participated in numerous armed actions against the German army, even liberating various populations in the south of France. The numbers of Spanish combatants in the ranks of the Resistance vary quite a bit amongst sources, but in general they accept a number around 10,000.Secundino Serrano: Maquis. Historia de la guerrilla antifranquista. Editorial Temas de Hoy, Madrid, 2001. After the German army was driven from France, Spanish maquis returned their focus to Spain. =Invasion of Val d'Aran= One of the valleys used as an entry into Spain during Operation: Reconquest of Spain.

The invasion was named \\"Operation Reconquest of Spain\\". Operation Reconquest of Spain was planned by the AGE staff. To carry out the invasion they created the 204th Division, made up of 12 brigades. The division was commanded by Vicente López Tovar. The objective of the offensive was to retake the sector of Spanish territory comprising the land between the Cinca and Segre Rivers and the French border. Later, the zone was declared conquered by the Spanish Republican government in exile, with the intention of provoking a general uprising against Franco throughout Spain. It was hoped that it would force the Allies to \\"liberate\\" Spain the same way it was \\"liberating\\" the rest of Europe. The main attack in the valley was accompanied by operations in other valleys of the Pyrenees during the previous weeks, with the objective of distracting Franco's forces. These other attacks were intended also to evaluate the situation in the interior of Spain, and make contact with other groups of exiles. The most important points of penetration in the long chain of mountains were Roncesvalles, Roncal, Hecho, Canfranc, Val d'Aran, Andorra, and Cerdanya, though there were also operations at smaller points. The offensives were repelled by a great force that was moved into the area by Franco, made up of the Civil Guard, Armed Police Corps, battalions of the Spanish Army, and 40,000 Moroccan (Army of Africa) troops. The guerrilla army conquered various towns and villages, raising the Spanish Republican flag, carrying out anti-Franco meetings in the plazas, as well as controlling part of the French border for several days, through which they were able to bring in trucks, material and reinforcements from France. However, the invasion failed to take Vielha e Mijaran, its principal objective. Finally, overwhelmed by the Nationalists' numeric and material advantage, the guerrillas pulled back. The retreat ended October 28, when the last guerrillas re-crossed the border back into France, without the hoped-for uprising. The failure of the invasion was used by the Stalinist members of the PCE's Central Committee, recently arrived from the Soviet Union to France, to purge the heads of the party who had remained in France fighting the Germans. Most were either kidnapped and assassinated or summarily judged and shot.Mikel Rodríguez Álvarez. Maquis. La guerrilla vasca (1938-1962). Editorial Txalaparta. =\\"Agrupaciones Guerrilleras\\"= In spite of the setback of Arán in 1944, the expectations of the exiled Spanish Communist Party (PCE) remained high, given that all seemed still possible in an international context of general collapse of fascism. All throughout Spain, the level of guerrilla activity went up, precipitated by the incorporation of new contingents forced to cross the border from France and the reorganization of the groups with structures of a more military character. The exiled PCE promoted the creation of the Agrupaciones Guerrilleras (Guerrilla Groups) in several geographic zones, coordinating the actions between them. It was modeled after the Federación de Guerrillas de León-Galicia, the first guerrilla organization of the post-war era. The most active group from the AG was the Agrupación Guerrillera de Levante y Aragón (AGLA), which was active in the area between the southern part of Teruel, the interior of Castellón and the north of Cuenca. Also noteworthy was the Agrupación de Guerilleros \\"Stalingrado\\" (Stalingrad Group) headed up by Manolo el Rubio (Pablo Pérez Hidalgo), which operated in the Sierra de Bermeja near Cádiz, and at its peak boasted a force of 50 resistance fighters.Jesús Torbado & Manuel Leguineche Bollar. Los Topos. Editorial Argos Vergara, 1977. . Published in English as The Moles, tr. Nancy Festinger, Martin Secker & Warburg, 1981. All these groups were extremely sectarian in their aims and organization, following invariably the strategies dictated by the Central Committee (controlled by Moscow). The will to keep fighting was maintained by strict discipline imposed by the PCE kommisars. People in these groups who wanted to leave and rejoin a normal civilian life were most of the time treated as deserters and shot, even at the rearguard guerrilla camps in France. In 1948 the PCE changed its strategy, and at the behest of Stalin,Raymond Carr: España 1808-1975. Ariel Historia, Barcelona, 2003. renounced the guerrilla fight, preferring to try to change the state- sanctioned Spanish Syndical Organization from within. This began the decline of the agrupaciones, already quite beaten by government repression. The Agrupaciones Guerrilleras renamed themselves Comités de Resistencia. The new orientation, however, was not effective, and ultimately a general evacuation was decreed in 1952. =End of the maquis= There were several factors in the decline and disappearance of the Spanish maquis. On one side, the commencement of the Cold War made it evident that the Allies would not intervene in the maquis's fight against the Spanish State. This led the PCE to change strategy, ending its support for the guerrilla groups in the 1950s. The government had a policy of total silence on the actions of the maquis. For this reason, outside of the areas of maquis activity, the population had practically no knowledge of the maquis. On the rare occasion that an item appeared in the press, the maquis were always referred to as \\"bandoleros\\" (bandits), in order to strip the actions of all political context. Steadily, Francoist forces isolated the guerrillas. Most of their members were middle-aged or older by 1950, with the consequent detriment of their physical capacities accelerated by years of living exposed to the elements and the lack of proper medical and food supplies. In these last years, many attempted to escape to France. Of those who stayed in Spain, some were sentenced only to jail (some spent up to 20 years in prison), some were judged summarily and shot, and others died at the hands of the Guardia Civil through application of the Ley de Fugas (\\"law of fugitives\\"). Although the period of major guerrilla activity ranged from 1938 through to the early 1950s, some groups continued to fight. The end was marked by the shooting deaths of Francisco Sabate Llopart (El Quico) in 1960, and Ramon Vila \\"Caracremada\\" in 1963, both in Catalonia, and in Galicia in March 1965.Alfonso Domingo: El canto del búho. La vida en el monte de los guerrilleros antifranquistas. OberonMemoria, Grupo ANAYA, Madrid 2002. . Areas of activity Maquis were active mostly in mountainous areas throughout the peninsula, preferring forests or areas of dense vegetation that would provide shelter and cover. Another important factor in the location of maqui groups and their survival was the social situation. They had to choose areas in which they could count on the collaboration of at least part of the population, given that without support they could hardly sustain a guerrilla group. In areas of harsher weather, like in the mountains of León, the maquis would relatively often pass periods of time more or less \\"undercover\\", in small groups, in support houses in villages, especially during the winter months. Among the areas of major maquis activity were the Cornisa Cantábrica, from Galicia to Cantabria, especially the mountains of Asturias and the area north of León; the Iberian System, specifically the area between the provinces of Teruel, Castellón, Valencia, and Cuenca; Centro, which consists of Extremadura, the north of Cordova, Ciudad Real, Toledo and the mountains of the Sistema Central; and two independent areas in the south of Andalusia: Cádiz on one hand and Granada-Málaga on the other. There was also activity in other areas, such as La Mancha and High Aragon. Armed resistance groups were also active in cities, although only prominently in Madrid, Barcelona, Málaga and Granada.Marco, Jorge: Hijos de una guerra. Los hermanos Quero y la resistencia antifranquista. Granada, Comares, 2010 In Madrid, the maquis' character was predominantly communist, supported by the PCE. Their activities did not, however, last long. On the other hand, the maquis acting in Barcelona, were mainly anarchists. This city was the last urban place to see activity of maquis. Attempts to extend the fight to other capitals like Valencia and Bilbao were unsuccessful. The generally rural and isolated character of the areas of guerrilla activity constituted an obstacle to the maquis' objectives. In effect, given the silence of the press and government on the situation, very few and scattered inhabitants of areas of maqui activity were actually aware of the conflict. The greater part of the Spanish population was ignorant of the war going on in their mountains. \\"Enlaces\\" Sustaining guerrilla activity was dependent on sectors of the population known as \\"enlaces\\" (literally, \\"links\\" or \\"relationships\\"). There were others called \\"passive militias\\", and \\"guerrilleros del llano\\" (\\"guerrillas of the plains\\"), who supplied aid, from food to armaments when necessary, as well as information. They would also deliver mail or correspondence for the groups. The enlaces were much more exposed to the repressive actions of the government. However, they made up a source of combatants, since in the event of being discovered, their only chance to avoid being jailed was to flee to the mountains. Because of this, in the early 1950s when guerrilla activity was in its death throes, groups were still incorporating new men and women. The number of enlaces was much higher than that of actual combatants. During the years of guerrilla activity, 20,000 people were arrested for collaborating with the maquis.Alfonso Domingo: El canto del búho. La vida en el monte de los guerrilleros antifranquistas. OberonMemoria, Grupo ANAYA, Madrid 2002. . \\"Frente a unos 6.000 o 7.000 guerrilleros, el número de enlaces fue diez, veinte veces mayor. Según cifras oficiales hubo 20.000 enlaces detenidos.

The young adult suspense thriller, published in 1994, reunites L'Engle's most frequent protagonist, Vicky Austin, with Adam Eddington, both of whom become enmeshed in international intrigue as they travel separately to Antarctica. The story takes place several months after the end of A Ring of Endless Light, the novel in which Vicky and Adam first met. Like several previous books about Vicky Austin, Troubling a Star is told in the first person, with Vicky as the narrator. It begins with Vicky stranded alone on an iceberg off the coast of Antarctica. The novel proceeds to tell in memory flashbacks how Adam's Great Aunt Serena paid for Vicky to visit Adam at Eddington Point in Antarctica, and of the interesting people and unexpected dangers she meets along the way. Despite Vicky's concerns about an apparent cooling in Adam's affection for her, it is established that their everlasting romantic relationship is quite a strong and close one. New Characters =Protagonists= *Serena \\"Aunt Serena\\" Eddington - Adam's generous great- aunt who sends Vicky off to Antarctica to visit Adam at Lenoir Station and Eddington Point. *Adam \\"Cookie\\" Cook - Aunt Serena's chef who is going to visit his brother in The Falklands, who watches Vicky for a while until his ship arrives. *Siri Evensen - Vicky's new friend who plays the harp and who is a teacher. She eventually finds deep and close romantic love within Benjy. *Otto Zlatovitcx - The prince of the nation of Zlatovica, which was once part of the Soviet Union. *Benjy Stone - A penguin expert aboard the Argosy, the cruise ship which takes Vicky to Antarctica, who strongly falls romantically in love with Siri. *Dick and Angelique Hawkins - A couple going to Antarctica with Vicky and her friends. *Sam White - A generous elderly man who is the oldest passenger on the Argosy, with Vicky being the youngest. *Seth \\"Papageno\\" Cook - Cookie's brother who got maimed by a fur seal and almost died. He has a nasty scar over his eye from the experience. *Quimby \\"Quim\\" Forrest - One of the lecturers on the Argosy. *Leilia - A kind, elderly Alaskan woman who is a school teacher. She also is traveling on the ship, the Argosy. =Antagonists= *Jorge Maldonado - A cameraman who does secret illegal business with Jack Nessinger on the ship. *Jack Nessinger - A Texan who does secret business with Maldonado and who escapes to Vespugia in the end. *Esteban - Adam Eddington's guide when Adam visited the Vespugian pyramids. He is a young soldier and oboist and one of Vicky's persistent suitors. He dies in the end by a gunshot from Otto. *Captain Nausinio - A rather stupid commander of Esteban who leaves Esteban to die on an iceberg while he escapes in a motorboat. *Greta - One of Maldonado's stooges who comes from Germany. Setting Part of the story takes place in Vespugia, the fictional country first mentioned in A Swiftly Tilting Planet. The events of that book have a strong bearing on the dangers Vicky faces approximately thirteen years later.

In The New York Times, film critic Caryn James wrote, \\"It's not a good omen for 'The Innocent' that the prototypical Yank turns out to be Anthony Hopkins, the shy Englishman Leonard is played by the American Campbell Scott and the German woman who intrigues them is Isabella Rossellini... But The Innocent, which has been on the shelf for at least a year and was dumped in theaters yesterday without advance screenings, eventually overcomes its obstacles and almost lives up to its promising pedigree. You can trust Ian McEwan, who wrote the screenplay from his 1990 novel, to turn this fraught political situation into a dark, paranoid love story. And you can count on the director John Schlesinger (whose most famous film is Midnight Cowboy and most recent is the efficient thriller Pacific Heights) to bring it to life with a commanding sense of its increasingly complex elements. What begins as a low- key tale of espionage, with allies spying on each other and everybody's motives in doubt, becomes a tense and suspenseful love story with Hitchcockian overtones.\\" Rita Kempley in the Washington Post, on the other hand,Rita Kempley, \\"The Innocent,\\" The Washington Post, September 2, 1995. called the movie \\"baffling.\\" She continued, \\"The acting proves as inconsistent as Schlesinger's ability to build and release suspense. In full swagger, Hopkins seems to be doing Teddy Roosevelt in preparation for the title role in Nixon. Rossellini recalls her mother, Ingrid Bergman, in an airport farewell scene that echoes Casablanca. It doesn't detract from the actress's work, but it does invite negative comparisons. Talk about amounting to a hill of beans.\\" Upon its September 1995 USA release, Stephen Hunter wrote: \\"What an odd, chilly cup of tea is John Schlesinger's The Innocent. It slipped into the Greenspring with a great cast–Anthony Hopkins, Campbell Scott and Isabella Rossellini–but without benefit of a screening, a commercial decision that seemed foolish at the time but now seems the quintessence of marketing wisdom. The movie turns out to be a spy thriller set in the Berlin of the '50s. But just about every note is brightly, noisily false. In fact, the movie is so wrong from start to finish it's some kind of monument to human folly.... It becomes a lame, bad parody of Casablanca, complete with airport, twin-engine prop plane, raincoats and Ingrid Bergman, or at least a facsimile thereof in the shape of her daughter, Rossellini. Why Rossellini would agree to such a tasteless twist on her mother in such an otherwise undistinguished film is one of the great astonishments of our time; why the great director of Sunday, Bloody Sunday and Darling would consider it himself is another.\\" References External links  * Category:1993 films Category:Films directed by John Schlesinger Category:English-language films Category:1990s thriller films Category:Cold War spy films Category:British spy films Category:British films Category:American spy films Category:American films Category:Films about the Berlin Wall Category:Films based on British novels Category:Central Intelligence Agency in fiction Category:Films shot in Germany Category:Films set in Berlin ","title":"The Innocent (1993 film)"},{"id":"8862702","text":"Kansas Proposed Amendment 1, which was put before voters on April 5, 2005, is an amendment to the Kansas Constitution that makes it unconstitutional for the state to recognize or perform same-sex marriages or civil unions.

Its size can range from being small enough to fit in a closet to one hundred times that size. The multimachine can accurately perform all the functions of an entire machine shop by itself. The multimachine was first developed as a personal project by Pat Delaney, then grew into an open source project organized via a Yahoo! group. The 2,600 member support group that has grown up around its creation is made up of engineers, machinists, and experimenters who have proven that the machine works. As an open-source machine tool that can be built cheaply on-site, the Multimachine could have many uses in developing countries. The multimachine group is currently focused on the humanitarian aspects of the multimachine, and on promulgating the concept of the multimachine as a means to create jobs and economic growth in developing countries. The multimachine first became known to a wider audience as the result of the 2006 Open Source Gift Guide article on the Make magazine website, in which the multimachine was mentioned under the caption \\"Multimachine - Open Source machine tool\\".http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2006/10/multimachine-open-source.html Uses As a general-purpose machine tool that includes the functions of a milling machine, drill press, and lathe, the multimachine can be used for many projects important for humanitarian and economic development in developing countries: * Agriculture: Building and repairing irrigation pumps and farm implements * Water supplies: Making and repairing water pumps and water-well drilling rigs. * Food supplies: Building steel-rolling-and-bending machines for making fuel efficient cook stoves and other cooking equipment * Transportation: Anything from making cart axles to rebuilding vehicle clutch, brake, and other parts. * Education: Building simple pipe-and-bar-bending machines to make school furniture, providing \\"hands on\\" training on student- built multimachines that they take with them when they leave school. * Job creation: A group of specialized but easily built multimachines can be combined to form a small, very low cost, metal working factory which could also serve as a trade school. Students could be taught a single skill on a specialized machine and be paid as a worker while learning other skills that they could take elsewhere. Accuracy  The design goals of the multimachine were to create an easily built machine tool, made from \\"junk,\\" that is nonetheless all-purpose and accurate enough for production work. It has been reported to be able to make cuts within a tenth (one ten-thousandth of an inch), which means that in at least some setups it can equal commercial machine tool accuracy. In almost every kind of machining operation, either the work piece or the cutting tool turns. If enough flexibility is built into the parts of a machine tool involved in these functions, the resulting machine can do almost every kind of machining operation that will physically fit on it. The multimachine starts with the concept of 3-in-1 machine tools—basically a combination of metal lathe, mill and drill press—but adds many other functions. It can be a 10-in-1 (or even more) machine tool.  Construction  At a high-level, the multimachine is built using vehicle engine blocks combined in a LEGO-like fashion. It utilizes the cylinder bores and engine deck to provide accurate surfaces. Since cylinder bores are bored exactly parallel to each other and at exact right angles to the cylinder head surface, multimachine accuracy begins at the factory where the engine block was built. In the most common version of the multimachine, one that has a roller bearing spindle, this precision is maintained during construction with simple cylinder re-boring of the #3 cylinder to the size of the roller bearing outside diameter (OD) and re-boring the #1 cylinder to fit the overarm OD. These cylinder-boring operations can be done in almost any engine shop and at low cost. An engine machine shop provides the most inexpensive and accurate machine work commonly done anywhere and guarantees that the spindle and overarm will be perfectly aligned and at an exact right angle to the face (head surface) of the main engine block that serves as the base of the machine. Use a piece of pipe made to fit the inner diameter of the bearings as the spindle. A three-bearing spindle is used because the \\"main\\" spindle bearings just \\"float\\" in the cylinder bore so that the third bearing is needed to \\"locate\\" the spindle, act as a thrust bearing, and support the heavy pulley. The multimachine uses a unique way of clamping the engine blocks together that is easily built, easily adjusted, and very accurate. The multimachine makes use of a concrete and steel construction technique that was heavily used in industry during the First World War and resurrected for this project.

An aerotropolis is a metropolitan subregion whose infrastructure, land use, and economy are centered on an airport. It fuses the terms \\"aero-\\" (aviation) and \\"metropolis\\". Like the traditional metropolis made up of a central city core and its outlying commuter-linked suburbs, the aerotropolis consists of 1) the airport's aeronautical, logistics, and commercial infrastructure forming a multimodal, multifunctional airport city at its core and 2) outlying corridors and clusters of businesses and associated residential developments that feed off each other and their accessibility to the airport.Kasarda, John D., 3-D Aerotropolis Schematic with Airport City Center. http://www.aerotropolis.com/files/AerotropolisSchematicWithCore.jpg The word aerotropolis was first used by New York commercial artist Nicholas DeSantis, whose drawing of a skyscraper rooftop airport in the city was presented in the November 1939 issue of Popular Science.\\"Skyscraper Airport for City of Tomorrow\\". Popular Science (November 1939): pp. 70-71. https://books.google.com/books?id=QywDAAAAMBAJ&pg;=PA70 The term was repurposed by air commerce researcher John D. Kasarda in 2000 based on his prior research on airport-driven economic development.Kasarda, John D. \\"Logistics & the Rise of the Aerotropolis\\". Real Estate Issues, Vol. 25 (Winter 2000/2001): pp. 43–48. Airports, connectivity, and development According to Kasarda, airports have evolved as drivers of business location and urban development in the 21st century in the same way as highways did in the 20th century, railroads in the 19th century, and seaports in the 18th century. The engine of the aerotropolis is the airport and its air routes, which offer firms speedy connectivity to their suppliers, customers, and enterprise partners. Some aerotropolis businesses are more dependent on distant suppliers or customers halfway around the world than those located nearby. As economies become increasingly globalized, time-sensitive, and reliant on air commerce for trade in goods and services, the speed and agility aviation provides to long-distance movement of people and goods generate competitive advantages for firms and places. In the aerotropolis model, time and cost of connectivity replace space and distance as the primary metrics shaping development, with \\"economies of speed\\" becoming as salient for the competitiveness of firms and places as economies of scale and economies of scope. In this model, it is not how far but how fast widely separated firms and places can connect. The aerotropolis encompasses aviation-dependent businesses and the commercial services that support them and the multitude of air travelers who pass through the airport annually. These businesses include, among others, high-tech and advanced manufacturing, logistics, and e-commerce fulfillment; high-value perishables and biomeds; destination retail, sports, entertainment, and medical/wellness complexes; hotels; conference, trade, and exhibition centers; and offices for businesspeople who travel frequently by air or engage in global commerce. Business parks, logistics parks, R&D; parks, time-critical distribution centers, and information technology complexes as well as hotel, conference, and entertainment venues are most frequently visible around major new airports on metropolitan peripheries where there is sufficient land and along the transportation corridors radiating from them. As increasing numbers of aviation-oriented firms and commercial service providers cluster around and outward from airports, the aerotropolis is becoming a major urban destination where air travelers and locals alike work, shop, meet, exchange knowledge, conduct business, eat, sleep, and are entertained, often without going more than 15 minutes from the airport.\\"About the Aerotropolis,\\" http://www.aerotropolis.com/airportCities/about-the-aerotropolis The outcome is a new form of transit-oriented development centered on runways and along their connecting surface transportation arteries. The aerotropolis is more, though, than clusters and corridors of airport-linked commercial, industrial, and logistics facilities. It also consists of living urban places that must be planned and designed as appealing environmental and social realms. Some aerotropolises have arisen spontaneously, responding to organic market forces with a lack of planning, contributing to sprawl while creating highway congestion, pollution, and other negative externalities. Applying principles of smart urban growth and sustainability are essential to the formation of a successful aerotropolis,Freestone, R. (2009). Planning, Sustainability and Airport-Led Urban Development. International Planning Studies, 14(2), 161-176. as is stakeholder alignment. Governance entities aligning airport management, airport-surrounding communities, and city and regional officials with local business and economic development leaders should implement aerotropolis planning to achieve greater economic efficiencies along with more attractive and sustainable development. Criticisms of the concept A major criticism is the question of whether oil will stay relatively inexpensive and widely available in the future or whether a downturn in global oil production (\\"peak oil\\") will adversely affect aviation and thus the aerotropolis. Others have criticized the aerotropolis model for overstating the number and types of goods that travel by air. While many types of high-value goods like electronics tend to be shipped by air, larger, bulkier items like cars and grain do not. Those who point this out suggest that the relationship between seaports, airports, and rail facilities should be studied in more depth.Charles, M. B., Barnes, P., Ryan, N., & Clayton, J. (2007). Airport Futures: Towards a Critique of the Aerotropolis Model. Futures, 39 (9), 1009-1028. Further criticisms of the aerotropolis include loss of farmland and forests, eviction and/or the exclusion of local residents and communities from the economic benefits of the aerotropolis, and locking in high-carbon infrastructure for decades to come. Social critics argue that the aerotropolis favors the interests of business over that of people and that its mixed-use commercial/residential developments typically lack urban ambience. Some have questioned why people would ever want to live next to an airport, given aircraft noise. Still, others claim that while there are cases where the aerotropolis concept has worked well (e.g., Amsterdam Schiphol and Dallas-Fort Worth airport areas), it has often failed to live up to expectations when applied elsewhere.

He currently holds the title \\"Director Principal Invitado\\" of Madrid's Teatro Real. He was music director of San Francisco Opera from 2009 to 2018. Luisotti grew up in Bargecchia. He began studying music as a child, with lessons on the church organ. A seminary student until age 14, he was the director of his village church choir by age 11. He later trained as a pianist, with secondary degrees in composition, trumpet and voice. Upon completing his formal study, he traveled between Milan, where he was a rehearsal pianist for La Scala, and Florence, where he was a member of the chorus of the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino. Subsequent posts allowed him to assist such conductors as Lorin Maazel and Riccardo Muti at La Scala. His earliest full-time position was as chorus master for La Fenice in Venice. Luisotti's first professional opera conducting engagements were a 2000 production of Stiffelio in Trieste and a 2001 Staatstheater Stuttgart production of Il trovatore. Luisotti became Stuttgart's main conductor for the Italian repertory, conducting Tosca, Turandot, Madama Butterfly and Otello in 2006. His Stuttgart Il trovatore was met with critical acclaim,German online review: http://www.omm.de/veranstaltungen/musiktheater20012002/ST-il-trovatore.html and within weeks he was offered a debut engagement at Paris Opera. Other early invitations came from the Canadian Opera Company (Un ballo in maschera in 2003), Genoa's Teatro Carlo Felice (Il viaggio a Reims in 2003 and Simon Boccanegra in 2004), and Munich's Bavarian State Opera (Tosca in 2004). He made his debut in Japan with a staged production of Tosca at Suntory Hall. Marcello Giordani, Elisabete Matos, Nicola Luisotti - Curtain Call Luisotti made his San Francisco Opera debut in 2005 conducting La forza del destino. In January 2007, the company announced his appointment as its third music director, effective with the 2009-2010 season, with an initial contract of 5 years. His work at San Francisco Opera has included conducting the premiere of Marco Tutino's La Ciociara (Two Women). In May 2016, the company announced that Luisotti was to conclude his music directorship of San Francisco Opera after the 2017-2018 season. Luisotti led the 100th-anniversary performances of La fanciulla del West at the Metropolitan Opera and was presented with the Premio Puccini Prize by the Fondazione Festival Puccini. He served as music director of the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples from February 2012 to December 2014. He served as principal guest conductor of the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra from April 2009 to the spring of 2012. Luisotti's discography includes a complete recording of Stiffelio and Duets, featuring Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazón on the Deutsche Grammophon label. He is the conductor for a DVD recording of the Met's La bohème, starring Angela Gheorghiu and Ramón Vargas (EMI), and their centennial production of La fanciulla del West (Deutsche Grammophon).

Kasarda Ekurhuleni mayor Mondli Gungubel John D. Kasarda is an American academic and airport business consultant focused on aviation-driven economic development. He is currently Director for the Center for Air Commerce at the University of North Carolina's Kenan-Flagler Business School, the CEO of Aerotropolis Business Concepts LLC, an airport-economy consulting firm, and the President of the Aerotropolis Institute in China. He is also the editor- in-chief of Logistics, an open access journal published by MDPI.  Career  Kasarda has a background in economics, business, and urban sociology, and has conducted research on urban form, organizational structure, airport development, and regional economic growth. He has written 10 books and over 150 published articles, many of which synthesize two or more of these topics. From 1980 to 1990, he chaired UNC's Department of Sociology, where he held the position of Kenan Distinguished Professor. In 1990, Kasarda moved to UNC's Kenan-Flagler Business School as Kenan Distinguished Professor of Strategy and Entrepreneurship, and Director of the Frank Hawkins Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise. Over the following 22 years, he worked at the Institute for the study of entrepreneurship, regional economic development, and global competitiveness, and helped establish the Kenan Institute Asia in Bangkok, where he continues to serve on its board and executive committee. Kasarda stepped down from the Kenan Institute Directorship in 2012, but maintained his Kenan-Flagler faculty position and directorship of the Center for Air Commerce. Much of his research and applied work since 2000 has addressed how aviation and airports impact the competitiveness and growth of firms, cities, and regions. Kasarda developed what he has termed the \\"aerotropolis\\" model for the role of aviation and airports. His theories and applied work were elaborated upon in a 2012 book Aerotropolis: The Way We'll Live Next, co- authored with Greg Lindsay. Kasarda has consulted on various aerotropolis developments around the world, though his most extensive efforts have been in China. His model has its critics, including an organization called the Global Anti-Aerotropolis Movement. Nevertheless, its application has been expanding internationally, such as in Amsterdam, Dubai, and Johannesburg, Memphis, Paris, and Zhengzhou.

The cultural and linguistic heritage of the Syrian people is a blend of both indigenous elements and the foreign cultures that have come to rule the land and its people over the course of thousands of years. The mother tongue of most Syrians is Levantine Arabic, which came to replace the former mother tongue, Aramaic, in the aftermath of the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 7th century. The conquest led to the establishment of the Caliphate under successive Arab dynasties, who, during the period of the Abbasid Caliphate, promoted the use of the Arabic language. A minority of Syrians retained Aramaic which is still spoken in its Eastern and Western dialects. In 2018, the Syrian Arab Republic had an estimated population of 19.5 million, which includes, aside from the aforementioned majority, ethnic minorities such as Kurds, Armenians, Assyrians and others. Before the Syrian Civil War, the Syrian diaspora consisted of 15 million people of Syrian ancestry who immigrated to North America (United States and Canada), European Union member states (including Sweden, France and Germany), South America (mainly in Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela and Colombia), the West Indies, Africa, Australia and New Zealand. Six million refugees of the Syrian Civil War also live outside Syria now, mostly in Turkey. Etymology The name \\"Syrians\\" was employed by the Greeks and Romans to denote the inhabitants of Syria; however, they called themselves Arameans and Assyrians. The ethnic designation \\"Syrian\\" is derived from the word \\"Assyrian\\" and appeared in the Hellenistic and Roman periods. Some argue that the Çineköy inscription supports this theory. =Appellation of the name= The Greeks used the terms \\"Syrian\\" and \\"Assyrian\\" interchangeably to indicate the indigenous Arameans, Assyrians and other inhabitants of the Near East, Herodotus considered \\"Syria\\" west of the Euphrates. Starting from the 2nd century BC onwards, ancient writers referred to the Seleucid ruler as the King of Syria or King of the Syrians. The Seleucids designated the districts of Seleucis and Coele-Syria explicitly as Syria and ruled the Syrians as indigenous populations residing west of the Euphrates (Aramea) in contrast to Assyrians who had their native homeland in Mesopotamia east of the Euphrates. However, the interchangeability between Assyrians and Syrians persisted during the Hellenistic period. In one instance, the Ptolemies of Egypt reserved the term \\"Syrian Village\\" as the name of a settlement in Fayoum. The term \\"Syrians\\" is under debate whether it referred to Jews or to Arameans, as the Ptolemies referred to all peoples originating from Modern Syria and Palestine as Syrian. The term Syrian was imposed upon Arameans of modern Levant by the Romans. Pompey created the province of Syria, which included modern-day Lebanon and Syria west of the Euphrates, framing the province as a regional social category with civic implications. Plutarch described the indigenous people of this newly created Roman province as \\"Syrians\\", so did Strabo, who observed that Syrians resided west of the Euphrates in Roman Syria, and he explicitly mentions that those Syrians are the Arameans, whom he calls Aramaei, indicating an extant ethnicity. Posidonius noted that the people called Syrians by the Greeks refer to themselves as Arameans. In his book The Great Roman-Jewish War, Josephus, a Hebrew native to the Levant, mentioned the Syrians as the non-Hebrew, non- Greek indigenous inhabitants of Syria. The Arabs called Syria and the Levant Al-Sham. The national and ethnic designation \\"Syrian\\" is one that has been reused, accepted and espoused by the Syrian people since the advent of modern nationalism, which emanated from Europe and began with the culmination of the Napoleonic Wars of the early 1800s. History Syrians emerged from various origins; the main influence came from ancient Semitic peoples, populations from Arabia and Mesopotamia, while Greco-Roman influence is marginal.Commins et al. 2018. Quote:\\"The Syrian people evolved from several origins over a long period of time. The Greek and Roman ethnic influence was negligible in comparison with that of the Semitic peoples of Arabia and Mesopotamia—Aramaeans, Assyrians, Chaldeans, and Canaanites.\\" Ancient Syria of the first millennium BC was dominated by the Aramaeans; they originated in the Northern Levant as a continuum of the Bronze Age populations of Syria. The Seleucids ruled the Syrians as a conquered nation; Syrians were not assimilated into Greek communities, and many local peasants were exploited financially as they had to pay rent for Greek landlords. Outside Greek colonies, the Syrians lived in districts governed by local temples that did not use the Greek civic system of poleis and colonies. The situation changed after the Roman conquest in 64 BC; Syrians obtained the citizenship of Greek poleis, and the line separating between the colonists and the colonized blurred. The idioms Syrian and Greek were used by Rome to denote civic societies instead of separate ethnic groups. The Aramaeans assimilated the earlier populations through their language; combined with the common religion, Christianity, most of the inhabitants turned into Syrians (Aramaeans). Islam and the Arabic language had a similar effect where the Aramaeans themselves became Arabs regardless of their ethnic origin following the Muslim conquest of the Levant. The presence of Arabs in Syria is recorded since the 9th century BC, and Roman period historians, such as Strabo, Pliny the Elder, and Ptolemy, reported that Arabs inhabited many parts of Syria. What antiquity writers meant by the designation \\"Arab\\" is debated; the historian Michael Macdonald suggested that the term is an ethnic designation based on an \\"ill- defined complex of linguistic and cultural characteristics\\", while according to academic consensus, \\"Arab\\", in addition to it being an ethnic name, had a social meaning describing a nomadic way of life. The urheimat of the Arab ethnos is unclear; the traditional 19th century theory locates this in the Arabian Peninsula, while some modern scholars, such as David Frank Graf, note that the epigraphic and archaeological evidence render the traditional theory inadequate to explain the Arabs' appearance in Syria. The Arabs mentioned in Syria by Greco-Roman writers were assimilated into the \\"Greco–Aramaean culture\\" that dominated the region, and the texts they produced were written in Greek or Aramaic; Old Arabic, the precursor of Classical Arabic, was not a written language, and its speakers used Aramaic for writing purposes. =Arabization= On the eve of the Rashidun Caliphate conquest of the Levant, 634 AD, Syria's population mainly spoke Aramaic; Greek was the official language of administration. Arabization and Islamization of Syria began in the 7th century, and it took several centuries for Islam, the Arab identity, and language to spread; the Arabs of the Caliphate did not attempt to spread their language or religion in the early periods of the conquest, and formed an isolated aristocracy. The Arabs of the Claiphate accommodated many new tribes in isolated areas to avoid conflict with the locals; caliph Uthman ordered his governor, Muawiyah I, to settle the new tribes away from the original population. Syrians who belonged to Monophysitic denominations welcomed the peninsular Arabs as liberators. The Abbasids in the eighth and ninth century sought to integrate the peoples under their authority, and the arabization of the administration was one of the tools. Arabization gained momentum with the increasing numbers of Muslim converts; the ascendancy of Arabic as the formal language of the state prompted the cultural and linguistic assimilation of Syrian converts. Those who remained Christian also became arabized; it was probably during the Abbasid period in the ninth century that Christians adopted Arabic as their first language; the first translation of the gospels into Arabic took place in this century. Many historians, such as Claude Cahen and Bernard Hamilton, proposed that the arabization of Christians was completed before the First Crusade. By the thirteenth century, Arabic language achieved dominance in the region and its speakers became Arabs. Those who were able to avoid losing the Aramaic language are divided between two groups: Garshuni sample *The Eastern Aramaic Syriac-speaking group, followers of the Western-rite Syriac Orthodox Church and Syrian Catholic Church; they kept the pre-Islamic Syrian (Syriac) identity throughout the ages, asserting their culture in face of the Arabic language dominance. Linguists, such as Carl Brockelmann and François Lenormant, suggested that the rise of the Garshuni writing (using Syriac alphabet to write Arabic) was an attempt by the Syriac Orthodox to assert their identity. Syriac is still the liturgical language for most of the different Syriac churches in Syria. The Syriac Orthodox Church was known as the Syrian Orthodox Church until 2000, when the holy synod decided to rename it to avoid any nationalistic connotations; the Catholic Church still have \\"Syrian\\" in its official name. *The Western Neo-Aramaic-speaking group, that is, the inhabitants of Bakh'a, Jubb'adin and Ma'loula. The residents of Bakh'a and Jubb'adin converted to Islam in the eighteenth century, while in Ma'loula, the majority are Christians, mainly belonging to the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, but also to the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch, in addition to a Muslim minority, who speaks the same Aramaic dialect of the Christian residents. The people of those villages use Arabic intensively to communicate with each others and the rest of the country; this led to a noticeable Arabic influence on their Aramaic language where around 20% of its vocabulary is of Arabic roots. Bakh'a is steadily losing its dialect; by 1971, people aged younger than 40 could no longer use the Aramaic language properly, although they could understand it. The situation of Bakh'a will eventually lead to the extinction of its Aramaic dialect. Identity Besides religious identities, the Syrian people are split among three identities, the Arab, Syriac, and Syrian identities. Many Muslims and some Arabic-speaking Christians describe themselves as Arabs, while many Aramaic-speaking Christians and some Muslims prefer to describe themselves as Syriacs or Arameans. Also some people from Syria, mainly Syrian nationalists, describe themselves only as Syrians or ethnic Syrians. Most of the divisions in ethnic nomenclature are actually due to religious backgrounds. Genetics Arabian Peninsula/East African ancestral components Levantine ancestral component Other ancestral components Genetic tests on Syrians were included in many genetic studies. The genetic marker which identifies descendants of the ancient Levantines is found in Syrians in high proportion.Perry 2007. Quote:\\"The marker, known as the J2 haplogroup, was found in an unusually high proportion among Lebanese, Palestinians and Syrians tested by Zalloua during more than five years of research. He tested 1,000 people in the region.\\" Modern Syrians exhibit \\"high affinity to the Levant\\" based on studies comparing modern and ancient DNA samples.Marshall et al. 2016. Quote:\\"The mixed Near Eastern–Middle Eastern localisation of the Druze, shown using both modern and ancient DNA data, is distinct from that of neighbouring Syrians, Palestinians and most of the Lebanese, who exhibit a high affinity to the Levant.\\" Syrians cluster closely with ancient Levantine populations of the Neolithic and Bronze ages.Marshall et al. 2016. Quote:\\" Druze exhibited genetic similarity to Chalcolithic and Bronze Age Armenians and a Chalcolithic Anatolian. In that study, Druze clustered remotely from all Bronze Age and Neolithic Levantines, whereas Palestinians, Bedouins, Syrians and a few Lebanese clustered with Levantine populations.\\" A Levantine ancestral genetic component was identified; it is estimated that the Levantine and the Arabian Peninsula/East African ancestral components diverged 23,700-15,500 years ago, while the divergence between the Levantine and European components happened 15,900-9,100 years ago.Haber et al. 2013. Quote:\\"Our estimates show that the Levantine and the Arabian Peninsula/East African components diverged ∼23,700-15,500 y.a., while the Levantine and European components diverged ∼15,900-9,100 y.a.\\" The Levantine ancestral component is the most recurrent in Levantines (42–68%); the Arabian Peninsula/East African ancestral components represent around 25% of Syrian genetic make-up.Haber et al. 2013. Quote:1-\\"ADMIXTURE identifies at K = 10 an ancestral component (light green) with a geographically restricted distribution representing ∼50% of the individual component in Ethiopians, Yemenis, Saudis, and Bedouins, decreasing towards the Levant, with higher frequency (∼25%) in Syrians, Jordanians, and Palestinians, compared with other Levantines (4%–20%). The geographical distribution pattern of this component (Figure 4A, 4B) correlates with the pattern of the Islamic expansion, but its presence in Lebanese Christians, Sephardi and Ashkenazi Jews, Cypriots and Armenians might suggest that its spread to the Levant could also represent an earlier event.\\" 2-\\"Besides this component, the most frequent ancestral component (shown in dark blue) in the Levantines (42–68%) is also present, at lower frequencies, in Europe and Central Asia.\\"Fernandes et al. 2015. Quote:1-\\"In the Near East, we included Iraq, Jordan, Israel/Palestine, Turkey, Lebanon and Syria.\\" 2-\\"Here it is already possible to distinguish between a Southwest Asian/Caucasian and an Arabian/North African component; these two components have similar proportions of ∼30% each in Yemen and UAE, but the Arabian/North African proportion increases to 52–60% in Saudi and Bedouin. In Near Eastern populations, correspondingly, the Southwest Asian/Caucasian component rises to ∼50% and the Arabian/North African cluster decreases to ∼20–30%, even in Palestinians (similar to the Samaritans and some of the Druze), highlighting their primarily indigenous origin, with the most extreme values for the Druze, carrying the Southwest Asian/Caucasian component at ∼80%.\\" The paternal Y-DNA haplogroup J1, which reaches its highest frequencies in Yemen 72.6% and Qatar 58.3%, accounted for 33.6% of Syrians.El‐Sibai et al. 2009. Quote:\\"J1 frequencies in Syria, Akka and Jordan were more comparable to Lebanon than to the remaining Arabic countries (58.3% in Qatar and 72.5% in Yemen; Fig. 2G\\") The J2 group accounted for 20.8% of Syrians; other Y-DNA haplogroups include the E1B1B 12.0%, I 5.0%, R1a 10.0% and R1b 15.0%. The Syrians are closest to other Levantine populations: the Palestinians, Lebanese and Jordanians;Hajjej et al. 2018. Quote:\\"Using genetic distances, correspondence analysis and NJ trees, we showed earlier [61, 62] and in this study that Palestinians, Syrians, Lebanese and Jordanians are closely related to each other.\\" this closeness can be explained with the common Canaanite ancestry and geographical unity which was broken only in the twentieth century with the advent of British and French mandates.Hajjej et al. 2018. Quote:\\"The strong relatedness between Levant Arab populations is explained by their common ancestry, the ancient Canaanites, who came either from Africa or Arabian Peninsula via Egypt in 3300 BC [97], and settled in Levant lowlands after collapse of Ghassulian civilization in 3800–3350 BC [98]. The relatedness is also attributed to the close geographical proximity, which constituted one territory before 19th century British and French colonization.\\" Regarding the genetic relation between the Syrians and the Lebanese based on Y-DNA, Muslims from Lebanon show closer relation to Syrians than their Christian compatriots.Haber et al. 2013. Quote:\\"Lebanese Christians and all Druze cluster together, and Lebanese Muslims are extended towards Syrians, Palestinians, and Jordanians.\\" The people of Western Syria show close relation with the people of Northern Lebanon.Haber et al. 2011. Quote:\\"Syria is contained within the range of variation of the Lebanese samples. West Syrian samples lie closest to LN Sunnis, and not far from LN, LB, and LM Maronites.\\" Mitochondrial DNA shows the Syrians to have affinity with Europe; main haplogroups are H and R.Badro et al. 2013. Quote:\\"The haplogroups' geographical distribution shows affinity between the Northern Levant (modern day Lebanon and Syria) and Europe with clear distinctions between the Levant and the Arabian Peninsula with regards to Africa (Fig. 1, Table 1). The main mtDNA haplogroups for both Europe and the Northern Levant are H and R*.\\" Based on Mitochondrial DNA, the Syrians, Palestinian, Lebanese and Jordanians form a close cluster.Badro et al. 2013. Quote:\\"Yemenis and Saudis both associate strongly with Egyptians, whereas the Jordanian, Lebanese, Palestinian, and Syrian populations clustered together.\\" Compared to the Lebanese, Bedouins and Palestinians, the Syrians have noticeably more Northern European component, estimated at 7%.Marshall et al. 2016. Quote:\\"Druze and Syrians possess a significantly larger amount of the Northern European component (X = 7%) when compared with their neighbouring populations, such as Palestinians (X = 5%) and Lebanese and Bedouins (X = 2%).\\" Regarding the HLA alleles, Syrians, and other Levantine populations, exhibit \\"key differences\\" from other Arab populations;Hajjej et al. 2018. Quote:\\"On the contrary, key differences were noted between Levant Arabs (Lebanese, Palestinians, Syrians), and other Arab populations, highlighted by high frequencies of A*24, B*35, DRB1*11:01, DQB1*03:01, and DRB1*11:01-DQB1*03:01 haplotype in Levantine Arabs compared to other Arab populations.\\" based on HLA-DRB1 alleles, Syrians were close to eastern Mediterranean populations, such as the Cretans and Lebanese Armenians.Hajjej et al. 2018. Quote:\\"Syrians are genetically close to Eastern Mediterranean, as Cretans (-0.0001) and Lebanese Armenians (0.0050).\\" Studying the genetic relation between Jews and Syrians showed that the two populations share close affinity.Hammer et al. 2000. Quote:\\"This Jewish cluster was interspersed with the Palestinian and Syrian populations, whereas the other Middle Eastern non- Jewish populations (Saudi Arabians, Lebanese, and Druze) closely surrounded it.\\" Apparently, the cultural influence of Arab expansion in the Eastern Mediterranean in the seventh century was more prominent than the genetic influx.Hajjej et al. 2018. Quote:1-\\"The extent of gene Arab exchange with these autochthonous groups is undetermined but is thought to be lower than religious/cultural influence.\\" 2-\\"On the other hand, Levant Arabs are distant from Saudis, Kuwaitis, and Yeminis, an indication that the contribution of the Arabian Peninsula populations to Levantine gene pool is low, probably due to the absence of the demographic aspect of 7th century invasion.\\" However, the expansion of Islam did leave an impact on Levantine genes; religion drove Levantine Muslims to mix with other Muslim populations, who were close culturally despite the geographic distance, and this produced genetic similarities between Levantine Muslims and Moroccan and Yemeni populations. Christians and Druze became a genetic isolate in the predominantly Islamic world.Haber et al. 2013. Quote:1-\\"We show that religious affiliation had a strong impact on the genomes of the Levantines. In particular, conversion of the region's populations to Islam appears to have introduced major rearrangements in populations' relations through admixture with culturally similar but geographically remote populations, leading to genetic similarities between remarkably distant populations like Jordanians, Moroccans, and Yemenis. Conversely, other populations, like Christians and Druze, became genetically isolated in the new cultural environment. We reconstructed the genetic structure of the Levantines and found that a pre-Islamic expansion Levant was more genetically similar to Europeans than to Middle Easterners.\\" 2-\\"The predominantly Muslim populations of Syrians, Palestinians and Jordanians cluster on branches with other Muslim populations as distant as Morocco and Yemen.\\" 3-Lebanese Christians and all Druze cluster together, and Lebanese Muslims are extended towards Syrians, Palestinians, and Jordanians, which are close to Saudis and Bedouins.\\"  Language  Arabic is the mother tongue of the majority of Syrians as well as the official state language. The Syrian variety of Levantine Arabic differs from Modern Standard Arabic. Western Neo-Aramaic, the only surviving Western Aramaic language, is still spoken in three villages (Ma'loula, Al-Sarkha (Bakhah) and Jubb'adin) in the Anti-Lebanon Mountains by both Muslim and Christian residents. Syriac-Assyrians in the northeast of the country are mainly Surayt/Turoyo speakers but there are also some speakers of Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, especially in the Khabour Valley. Classical Syriac is also used as a liturgical language by Syriac Christians. English, and to a lesser extent French, is widely understood and used in interactions with tourists and other foreigners.  Religion and minority groups Clip - Interview with Paolo Dall'Oglio, The Syrian tradition of coexistence and the present scenario of confrontation Religious differences in Syria have historically been tolerated, and religious minorities tend to retain distinct cultural, and religious identities. Sunni Islam is the religion of 74% of Syrians. The Alawites, a variety of Shia Islam, make up 12% of the population and mostly live in and around Tartus and Latakia. Christians make up 10% of the country. Most Syrian Christians adhere to the Byzantine Rite; the two largest are the Antiochian Orthodox Church and the Melkite Greek Catholic Church. The Druze are a mountainous people who reside in Jabal al-Druze who helped spark the Great Syrian Revolt. The Ismailis are an even smaller sect that originated in Asia. Many Armenian and Assyrian Christians fled Turkey during the Armenian Genocide and the Assyrian genocide and settled in Syria. There are also roughly 500,000 Palestinians, who are mostly descendants of refugees from the 1948 Israeli-Arab War. The community of Syrian Jews inside Syria once numbered 30,000 in 1947, but has only 200 today. The Syrian people's beliefs and outlooks, similar to those of most Arabs and people of the wider Middle-East, are a mosaic of West and East. Conservative and liberally minded people will live right next to each other. Like the other countries in the region, religion permeates life; the government registers every Syrian's religious affiliation. However, the number of non-believers in Syria is increasing but there is no credible source or statistics to support this information.  Cuisine  Tabbouleh Syrian cuisine is dominated by ingredients native to the region. Olive oil, garlic, olives, spearmint, and sesame oil are some of the ingredients that are used in many traditional meals. Traditional Syrian dishes enjoyed by Syrians include, tabbouleh, labaneh, shanklish, wara' 'enab, makdous, kebab, Kibbeh, sfiha, moutabal, hummus, mana'eesh, bameh, and fattoush. A typical Syrian breakfast is a meze. It is an assortment platter of foods with cheeses, pickles, olives, and spreads. Meze is usually served with Arab-style tea - highly concentrated black tea, which is highly sweetened and served in small glass cups. Another popular drink, especially with Christians and non-practicing Muslims, is the arak, a liquor produced from grapes or dates and flavored with anise that can have an alcohol content of over 90% ABV (however, most commercial Syrian arak brands are about 40-60% ABV).

Early life James Godfrey MacManaway was born in County Tyrone in 1898, the youngest son of the Rt. Rev. James MacManaway, Church of Ireland Bishop of Clogher. He was educated at Campbell College, Belfast, and Trinity College, Dublin. He served in the Royal Flying Corps during the First World War, having enlisted at the age of 17. In 1925 MacManaway was ordained as a priest of the Church of Ireland by the Bishop of Armagh. He married Catherine Anne Swetenham Trench, née Lecky, in 1926. He was Rector of Christ Church, Derry from 1930 to 1947. He served as Chaplain to Forces during the Second World War. In 1945 he was awarded an MBE. Political career In June 1947 MacManaway was elected to the Parliament of Northern Ireland, as Unionist member for the City of Londonderry. He then set his sights on Westminster, although, as a man of the cloth, there was some doubt as to his eligibility, owing to various historical statutes debarring clergymen of both the Established Church and the Roman Catholic Church from sitting as MPs in the British House of Commons. MacManaway sought legal advice from the Attorney General for Northern Ireland, Edmund Warnock. Warnock advised him that since the Church of Ireland had been disestablished in 1869, the statutory bars would not apply to MacManaway. MacManaway was selected by the Unionist party to contest Belfast West in the 1950 General Election. As a precaution, he resigned from his offices in the Church of Ireland. He won the election, defeating the sitting Irish Labour Party MP Jack Beattie by 3,378 votes. Among the activists working on this campaign was a young Ian Paisley.Clifford Smyth, Ian Paisley: Voice of Protestant Ulster, p.4 Political career terminated As the first priest to take his seat in the House of Commons for 150 years, MacManaway was put under scrutiny by a Select committee of the House. They were unable to come to firm conclusions and, with some disquiet, recommended urgent legislation to clarify the law. The Home Secretary, James Chuter Ede, instead referred the matter to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Their judgement, in essence, identified a lacuna in the existing legislation, which would disqualify MacManaway. While the Irish Church Act 1869 did disestablish the Church of Ireland, since there was no express provision in that Act permitting its clergy to sit as MPs and MacManaway was still be subject to the strictures of the House of Commons (Clergy Disqualification) Act 1801, which debarred any person \\"ordained to the office of priest or deacon\\" from sitting or voting in the House of Commons. Modern scholars have questioned the rationale of this decision but, nonetheless, the House of Commons resolved on 19 October 1950 that MacManaway was disqualified from sitting. The House did, however, indemnify him (by the Reverend J. G. MacManaway's Indemnity Act 1951) from the £500-a-time fines that he had incurred for voting in parliamentary divisions while ineligible. MacManaway had voted on five occasions. MacManaway bitterly protested at what he perceived as an unjust anachronism bringing his career to an abrupt end, but did not contest the ensuing by-election, which was held for the Unionists by Thomas Teevan. His House of Commons career had lasted all of 238 days. Death Shortly after his leaving the Commons, MacManaway's wife died in January 1951. He resigned his seat at Stormont and died soon after, in November 1951, as the result of a fall.\\"Unholy muddle over an unlikely martyr\\", telegraph.co.uk, 12 March 2001. He was 53. Subsequent change in the law In the aftermath of the MacManaway case, in 1951 another Select committee examined the possibility of a change in the law. However, while acknowledging the anomalous and anachronistic nature of the ancient legislation, and taking soundings from various Christian denominations, the Committee recommended no specific change to the law. The law did not, however apply to churches such as the Presbyterian Church in Ireland and ministers such as Martin Smyth successfully served as MPs. There the matter lay for almost 50 years, until David Cairns was selected to fight the safe Labour seat of Greenock and Inverclyde. Cairns was a former Roman Catholic priest, and a re-run of the MacManaway imbroglio loomed. The Labour government introduced a bill removing almost all restrictions on clergy of whatever denomination from sitting in the House of Commons. The only exception would be Church of England bishops, because of their reserved status as members of the House of Lords. The bill came into law as the House of Commons (Removal of Clergy Disqualification) Act 2001 in time for David Cairns to take his seat in the Commons.

The center's goal is to raise the standard of coverage of international systemic crises, and to do so in a way that engages both the broad public and government policy-makers. The organization is based in Washington, D.C. The Center funds international travel costs associated with reporting projects on topics and regions of global importance. Grant amounts for journalists depend on the project and range from $3,000 to $20,000. All journalists, writers or filmmakers, both freelance and staff of any nationality, may apply. It also brings journalists to schools, colleges and universities around the United States to engage students with global issues. In 2015, it launched an online lesson builder that lets educators use Pulitzer Center journalism in original lessons. The Pulitzer Center is recognized as a tax-exempt organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. It is not affiliated with the Pulitzer Prizes. Pulitzer Center reporting projects The Pulitzer Center has sponsored reporting projects on a wide variety of under-reported stories across the globe. The projects incorporate blog posts, multimedia reporting, and multiple pieces that run in major mainstream news outlets such as the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, The Guardian, Financial Times, PBS Newshour, Seattle Times, The New Yorker, The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times. The Pulitzer Center treats the reporting projects as full-blown campaigns, designed to create maximum exposure for the reporting. This entails promoting the projects through social media, partnerships with other websites and organizations, and lectures by the journalists themselves at universities and schools. Pulitzer Center-funded projects have won nearly every journalism award available including the Pulitzer Prize, George C. Polk Award, Peabody Award, Emmy Award, Associated Press Media Editors, the National Academy of Sciences, CINE Golden Eagle Award, Loeb and Society of Professional Journalists. Documentaries funded by the Center have been screened at the Sundance Film Festival, at the United Nations, and at government office buildings and more. The film The Abominable Crime, about homosexuality in Jamaica, won Best Feature Length Documentary at the Belize International Film Festival. \\"No Fire Zone\\", a film by grantee Callum Macrae about government killing of Tamil citizens in the last days of the Sri Lankan civil war, has been garnering attention around the world—even from Prime Minister David Cameron. Starting in 2018, the Pulitzer Center began providing support for the Associated Press' ongoing coverage of the Yemen civil war. On April 15, 2019, the AP Yemen team—including Maggie Michael, Maad al-Zekri, and Nariman El- Mofty—was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting for \\"a revelatory yearlong series detailing the atrocities of the war in Yemen, including theft of food aid, deployment of child soldiers and torture of prisoners.\\" The Pulitzer Center received the 2009 National Press Foundation Excellence in Online Journalism Award. In September 2009 the Pulitzer Center's multimedia website LiveHopeLove.com won an Emmy Award for new approaches to news and documentary programming, in the arts, lifestyle and culture category. LiveHopeLove.com also won the 2009 Webby Award People's Voice Award for the Art category, was a finalist in the Best Use of Photography category, and was an Official Honoree in the Best Visual Design - Aesthetic category. The site incorporated the poetry of Kwame Dawes and photography of Joshua Cogan. People interviewed by Dawes for the website are inspirations for his poems, and the audience can meet them through photographs and videos on the LiveHopeLove.com. In 2009, Michael Kavanagh's Pulitzer Center project \\"War in Congo\\" for Worldfocus was nominated for a News and Documentary Emmy Award, and won an Edward R. Murrow Award for radio writing. Pulitzer Center coverage of post- earthquake Haiti won the 2011 National Press Club Joan Friedenberg Award for Online Journalism, along with msnbc.com.

Covering the elections as a freelance reporter for The Washington Times, Athanasiadis was commissioned to report on the elections as part of the Pulitzer Center's goal to \\"fill in large media gaps.\\" Following his release, Athanasiadis continued to report on the opposition movement in Iran and its activities, despite the risks that it entailed. In April 2010, the Pulitzer Center came under fire after a grantee and World Press Photo winner, Marco Vernaschi, was accused of requesting that a Ugandan mother exhume her recently deceased child, offering payment after the fact. The allegations were revealed publicly when Brazilian-Norwegian photographer André Liohn traveled to Uganda to report the same story and uncovered evidence to suggest, contrary to a vague photo caption written by Vernaschi, that he was not present at the time of burial and had in essence staged a photo and offered payment in return. After notifying the Pulitzer Center and the photojournalist Anne Holmes, who subsequently removed an interview with Vernaschi that had previously been on her blog,Anne Holmes, \\"Interview with Marco Vernaschi Retracted\\", Vigilante Journalism, n.d.

The species name 'akindynos' is Greek, meaning 'safe' or 'without danger' in reference to the safety afforded amongst the tentacles of its host anemone. Like all anemonefishes it forms a symbiotic mutualism with sea anemones and is unaffected by the stinging tentacles of the host anemone. It is a sequential hermaphrodite with a strict size-based dominance hierarchy: the female is largest, the breeding male is second largest, and the male non-breeders get progressively smaller as the hierarchy descends. They exhibit protandry, meaning the breeding male will change to female if the sole breeding female dies, with the largest non-breeder becomes the breeding male. The fish's natural diet includes zooplankton. Description Adults are an orange-brown colour with two white bars with black edging encircling the body. The first bar is located on the head behind the eyes and may be thin and broken. The second bar is on the body below the dorsal fin. The caudal peduncle and caudal fin are white. Juveniles are normally brown with three white stripes. In sub- adults the colouring changes to a dull yellow with two white stripes. They have 10 to 11 dorsal spines and 2 anal spines. They reach a maximum length of . =Colour variations= Some anemonefish species have colour variations based on geographic location, sex and host anemone. A. akindynos does not show any of these variations. =Similar species= The white bars on A. akindynos are generally narrower than A. clarkii and lacks the abrupt transition between the body colour and white caudal fin. A. clarkii may have a yellow caudal fin. Adult A. chrysopterus are darker while the head bar is broader and not constricted or discontinuous. Traditionally A. akindynos was included in the clarkii complex, however genetic analysis has shown that it is significantly different from any of the other species in the clarkii complex and instead is part of a clade with A. mccullochi. Further study suggested an evolutionary connectivity among between samples of A. akindynos and A. mccullochi. Historical hybridization and introgression in the evolutionary past resulted in a complex mitochondrial DNA structure. There were two evolutionary groups with individuals of both species detected in both, thus the species lacked reciprocal monophyly. There were no shared haplotypes between species.

A. akindynos has been thought to be limited to depths of less than 25 m, however surveys using autonomous underwater vehicles of mesophotic reefs at Viper Reef and Hydrographers Passage in the central Great Barrier Reef observed A. akindynos at depths between 50 and 65 m. =Host anemones= The relationship between anemonefish and their host sea anemones is not random and instead is highly nested in structure. A. akindynos is a generalist, being hosted by the following 6 out of the 10 host anemones: *Entacmaea quadricolor Bubble-tip anemone *Heteractis aurora beaded sea anemone *Heteractis crispa Sebae anemone *Heteractis magnifica magnificent sea anemone *Stichodactyla haddoni *Stichodactyla mertensii Mertens' carpet sea anemone Reproduction The Barrier Reef anemonefish is a nesting fish. A few days before mating, aggression from the dominant male towards the female increases, and at the same time he begins clearing a nest site, usually on a rock close to the host anemone. The rock is cleaned of algae, sometimes with the assistance of the female. When spawning takes place the female zig-zags over the nest site and the male follows fertilizing the eggs which have been deposited. Between 100 and 1000 elliptical eggs of between 3 and 4 mm in length may be laid. They are attached to the nest site by a mass of short filaments. The male guards and aerates the eggs for 6 to 7 days until they hatch. The larvae are then dispersed by currents and swimming. Larvae mortality is high, with most of the surviving larvae settling on the original reef. Diet The diet of the Barrier Reef anemonefish consists primarily of algae (seaweeds) and zooplankton. The dominant pair in the social hierarchy tend to travel farther from the host anemone in order to find food. The host anemone may benefit from small pieces of food which the anemonefish drop when feeding. Conservation status Anemonefish and their host anemones are found on coral reefs and face similar environmental issues. Like corals, anemone's contain intracellular endosymbionts, zooxanthellae, and can suffer from bleaching due to triggers such as increased water temperature or acidification. The other threat to anemonefish is collection for the marine aquarium trade. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority manages collection by zoning reefs as open or closed and normally a breeding pair of adults or sub-adults is removed, leaving at least one anemonefish behind. While bleaching was found to be a cause of anemone and anemonefish decline in the Keppel Islands, anemones and anemonefish were still present on bleached reefs in the closed zones however they were absent from bleached reefs in the open zones, suggesting that collection compounds the impact of bleaching. A survey published in 2014 found 58% of sites surveyed on the Great Barrier Reef did not have anemones or anemonefishes, and at sites where they were present, numbers were generally low and suggested that current regulations may not be sufficient to prevent localised extinctions nor to ensure that reproductive success is not adversely impacted. This species was not evaluated in the 2012 release of the IUCN Red List. Aquatic emblem The Barrier Reef anemonefish was officially named as the state aquatic emblem of Queensland in March, 2005.

There are many myths about how this concertino came about, but one of the most probable versions are that David rewrote one of his already mostly finished violin-pieces into this trombone concertino. Queisser initially asked Felix Mendelssohn to write him a Trombone Concerto, but as he did not have the time for it, David might have suggested Mendelssohn to use his composition for this purpose. (If one compares the composition to David's surrounding works (e.g. Op. 3 & 5) there are clearly some parts that are much better composed than otherwise, which leads to a suggestion that Mendelssohn might have \\"looked it over\\"). The piece was premiered at the Gewandhaus with Queisser playing the solo part and Mendelssohn conducting.Lindberg, Christian: \\"History of the Concertino\\" It was an immediate success.

Early life Boleslaw Cybis was born on July 23, 1895 in Vilnius in Lithuania. He received various athletic awards for gymnastic excellence during his school days in Warsaw. In 1915, he attended St. Petersburg Academy of Fine Arts while his father, a noted architect and engineer (said to have designed Peterhoff, the summer palace of the mother of Czarina Maria Feodorovna) was designing and building in Russia. In 1921, the White Russian cause collapsed and Cybis took refuge in Constantinople where he lived and worked with artists Constantin Alajalov and Pavel Tchelitchev. He supported himself by sketching portraits in cafes, painting sidewalk advertisements for theatres, painting murals in nightclubs and cafes, painting and designing stage backdrops for the ballet, and fashioning clay pipes in ornate designs from native clays. One of his first \\"paid jobs\\" was a gigantic billboard advertising Nestle's chocolate. By 1923 he had saved enough money for transportation home to Warsaw, where he entered the Academy of Fine Arts. Upon graduation, he was appointed a professor at the Academy and traveled extensively throughout Europe recording his experiences in his art while studying the Old Masters and emulating their techniques. In 1926 he married Marja Tym, a talented fellow artist and student at the Academy. Marja, also spelled Maria (as is shown on the tombstone at the Cybises grave site in the Princeton Cemetery, Princeton, NJ), was born in Poland on October 13, 1904. http://www.poles.org/db/C_names/Cybis_B/Cybis_B.html However the date on the tombstone is 1906. http://www.findagrave.com/cgi- bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSln;=cybis&GSiman;=1&GScid;=100174&GRid;=133673072& Painting career Cybis' paintings, sculptures, and murals won him recognition in Paris, Geneva, Munich, Frankfurt, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Bucharest and Vienna. From 1926-1930 he was fascinated by the peasants of the country side whom he likened to 15th century medieval portraits of the masters. Over the next four years he painted a series of peasant portraits now in various museum collections. During the 1930s his work first appeared by invitation in fine art exhibits and museums in the United States, where Studio Magazine (Contemporary... Masters,\\" April 1934) found his paintings \\"a striking example... reminiscent of Leonardo da Vinci.\\" In 1932 he lived in Tripoli, where some of his finest canvases were painted, and where he painted experimentally with cement. Over the next few years he exhibited paintings at the Brooklyn Museum of Art and at museums in Chicago and Dayton, Ohio as well as in the International Exhibition of Paintings at the Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh and the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, NY. His ceiling mural was awarded the Grand Prix at the International \\"Art and Technique\\" in Paris. In 1939 Cybis and his wife, Marja, an accomplished artist in her own right came to the United States to paint a series of murals commissioned by their government in the \\"Hall of Honor\\" at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Here he completed two frescos: \\"Poles Fighting for American Independence\\" and \\"Central Industrial District and Gdynia.\\" Also shown at the fair was a textured tapestry rug, \\"Walking through a Park\\", designed by Cybis and his wife. He then toured the U.S., sketching and painting Native American Indians. Sculpture career Unable to return to their homeland after the outbreak of World War II, the Cybises chose to become citizens of the United States. Although he had spent many years as a painter, Cybis was also fascinated with three-dimensional porcelain art, and the couple soon established Cybis Studio at the Steinway Mansion in Astoria, New York, in 1940. Here they created cold cast chalk ware sculptures known as Papka in the fashion of the great European Studios they had known during their youth. After relocating to Trenton, New Jersey, Cybis turned his attention fully to china and porcelain sculpture using techniques derived from his study of the Old Masters in Europe. \\"Concept,...training, direction and execution  Cybis knew that not one of these elements can be neglected in the complex process which ends as fine porcelain sculpture: for he was not a man to be tolerant of less than perfection. That his instincts were correct was quickly proven: in less than two years, Cybis achieved recognition as a leader in the field of porcelain art.\\" The Ceramic Industrial Journal, October 1948 In 1942 Cybis along with two investors, Harry Wilson and Harvey Greenburg, founded the Cordey China Company http://antiqueshoppefl.com/articles/july04/cordey.html and in 1953 Cybis founded the Cybis Studio. The studio produced porcelain works at 65 Norman Avenue in Trenton until closing it doors to the public in the early 2000s. A website was online for several years advertising items for sale by special order but that was removed mid 2019. The company is now closed. Cybis porcelains were given as gifts of state and found in the permanent collections of museums, embassies, government buildings and art galleries around the world.

Prominent features of Formosa include: * a hilltop church (named the Church of the Immaculate Conception) built from 1875-1883 * Lion and Lioness Park – a picnic stop * Formosa Springs Brewery (Brick Brewing Company) * site of the Saugeen Conservation's main administrative office * Formosa Inn and TNT General Store (1886) Neighbouring towns include Mildmay and Walkerton. The postal code for the hamlet is N0G 1W0. Origins Bird's Eye view of Formosa Rev. Gaspar Matoga, a Jesuit missionary, visited the area in January 1853, on one of many trips to minister to the new settlements of the region. Upon seeing the valley in which the present day hamlet is situated, he described it as formosa, the Latin word for beautiful. School The new community of Formosa had a school as early as 1854. There have been schools in one form or another on the present school grounds since 1868. The first school in Formosa was a log structure, erected in 1854. It doubled as a temporary church in the early days of the community for the visiting Jesuit missionaries. It was on the northwest corner of lot 30, Concession A, Carrick Township. With the growth of the community, a large stone school was completed in 1868, on land donated by local businessman F.X. Messner. He also donated land and a -story convent building in 1872, hoping to establish Formosa as a headquarters for the School Sisters of Notre Dame. This was situated on the northeast hill of the valley, near the church. A smaller one-story stone school was also constructed nearby. When the convent didn't grow as much as anticipated, the convent building was converted into a four-room school as well, and living quarters for a smaller number of nuns was added as a wing to the convent building. For a number of years in the late nineteenth century Formosa had three school buildings in use simultaneously. The convent school was used for girls grades one to eight. The large stone school accommodated the boys of grades five and up. The small, one-story stone school was used for boys grades one to four. Over time, the population lessened, and eventually the schools were consolidated in the convent building's four classrooms. The large stone school was used as community centre for some time. In 1926, a residence fire at the foot of the hill spread and gutted the convent school. Construction commenced on a new school and detached convent. In the interim, classes were once again held in the former 1868 large stone school and other locations. The new school and convent were completed in 1927. In 1966, a larger central school replacing a number of rural schools was planned. It was built directly behind the site of the 1926 school, and completed in 1968. It is called Immaculate Conception, part of the Bruce-Grey Catholic District School Board. It is a large modern school, in close proximity to the nearby convent. Currently, the school has a French Immersion program in addition to its regular program. The School Sisters of Notre Dame provided teachers for the Formosa schools nearly continuously from 1872 to 1976, working in concert with lay educators to provide a Catholic-based education. After 1976, a few stayed on volunteering at the school into the early 1990s. In 1996, the remaining sisters moved to a private residence in Walkerton and the convent was sold for private residential use. Formosa Church The Formosa church, situated at the top of the hill at the north end of the hamlet, was envisioned as a large permanent church for the new and growing Roman Catholic parish. At the time, a wooden church that had been completed in 1857 had required two expansions to handle the increasing number of German immigrants flowing into the area. The architect was charged with designing a stone church capable of seating 1200 to 1500 people. Rev. Archangelus Gstir arrived to lead the Formosa parish in 1861. Soon afterwards, he oversaw the expansion of the original 1857 wooden church, appealing on behalf of the parishioners to Ludwig I of Bavaria via the Ludwig Missions-Verin in Munich. He received 2000 Thalers from the King for this initial appeal. In April 1864, Father Gstir again wrote to Ludwig for funds to build a larger stone church, and subsequently received an additional 1000 Thalers. Father Gstir returned to his native Tyrol in 1865, and died in 1870. Church Interior After the foundation of the new stone church was laid in 1875, work proceeded at an uneven pace. The new pastor of the day (Father Louis Elena) and the parishioners did not want to go into debt, so work progressed as fast as contributions allowed. Much of the materials (limestone hand-cut from local rock, and timber) were obtained locally at no expense other than volunteer labour. Other materials had to be purchased and shipped to the area, including sandstone from Guelph quarries. The shell of the new church, completed in 1880, was constructed over the original wooden church. The old wooden building remained in use until the new roof was completed, after which it was dismantled and removed. Construction continued for a few more years, with the new church being consecrated on September 13, 1885. The total expenditure on church, not including free labour and materials, was $28,000. It is estimated that after exchange, the 3000 Thalers received from Ludwig (used partly for the older wooden church and partly for the new stone church) amounted to about $2000. The story of the church construction is used as a fictional backdrop in the Jane Urquhart novel The Stone Carvers. Formosa Spring Brewery The early German settlers quickly established a brewery in Formosa, in 1870. Over the years, the brewery has changed ownership and names many times, and the plant itself changed with renovations, expansions, and reconstructions. In 1922, the brewery's Buffalo-based owners closed the plant, due to prohibition. In 1924, it reopened as the Formosa Spring Brewery and a program of modernization was undertaken. Beer began to be produced again in 1927, and the brewery operated continually in Formosa from then on to the closure of the plant at the end of 1971. The summers of 1958 and 1968 were of special note in the history of the brewery; strikes by unionized beer workers shut down beer sales everywhere else in Ontario. Crowds of thirsty Ontario beer drinkers flocked to Formosa, where rationing of one case per customer had to be instituted at times. In the late 1960s, the plant had reached bottling capacity, and the Formosa site was deemed infeasible for expansion. The owners built a new plant in Barrie, Ontario, and moved operations there, still under the 'Formosa Spring Brewery' name. In 1974, Molson's purchased the Barrie-based Formosa Spring Brewery, renaming it Molson's Brewery. The Formosa plant was sold and used for a number of years for other industries such as water bottling and fish farming. With the rise of microbreweries in Ontario in the 1980s and 1990s, the Formosa plant was once again put to use brewing beer. The Algonquin Brewing Company purchased the plant in 1988, and restarted brewing operations in Formosa. They put out a few different varieties of beer, including some they labelled 'Formosa Springs'. The company was subsequently sold to the Brick Brewing Company in 1997, who retained the 'Formosa Springs' label on a few varieties. In January 2017, Brick put the small company up for sale; the sale may result in the closing of the 40 thousand square foot plant if the new owner is not interested in acquiring the facility. On September 7, 2017, Brick Brewing confirmed the completion of the Formosa sale. A definitive agreement for sale of Formosa was announced on September 1, and Brick confirms that the sale transaction closed on Wednesday, September 6, 2017 In the winter of 2017, the new owners quickly moved in, installing new equipment, hiring previous employees back, re-opening the brewery beer store and implementing a new commercial craft beer strategy.

Plot In 1624, shogun Tokugawa Hidetada of the Tokugawa shogunate dies at Edo Castle. Komuro Kihei, his taster, also kills himself, leading to suspicion that the shogun was poisoned. Hidetada's oldest son Iemitsu was to be heir, but his father disliked his appearance and stammer and preferred his second son Tadanaga, who is bright, handsome, and admired. Hidetada's wife Oeyo uses her influence on other ministers such as the lord of Owari, Chief Chamberlain Doi, and Councilor Sakai, who join her in backing Tadanaga as heir. The young Chamberlain Matsudaira and Lady Kasuga, leader of the harem, back Iemitsu. The scheming nobles Sanjo Saneeda and Karasuma Ayamaro hope for the downfall of the government altogether. Ninjas hired by Doi enter the shogun's tomb in Zojo Temple and cut out his heart, but it is stolen from them by Yagyu's daughter Akane. Yagyu, Iemitsu's fencing instructor, determines that Hidetada was poisoned and confronts Chamberlain Matsudaira and Lady Kasuga. Matudaira ends up admitting to Iemitsu that he poisoned Hidetada and Yagyu explains that Kihei put arsenic in his father's food for three days to poison him. The lovers Hayate and Mon become independent Negoro fighters attempting to reclaim their homeland in Yamato Province that was taken 20 years earlier. They receive a request, ostensibly from Tadanaga, to aid the young prince. Jubei returns just as they resolve to aid the prince and he helps them kill Koga ninja spies in the woods. Doi tells Tadanaga that his father was poisoned by Iemitsu's retainers and Tadanaga confronts Iemitsu about it but Matsudaira and Lady Kasuga deny it and Iemitsu refuses to allow the body to be examined. Tadanaga invites his mother to move with him to his large estate in Suruga. Akane and her brothers meet with their brother Jubei and the Negoro fighters at the Tama River on the outskirts of Edo. Yagyu asks Sagenta, leader of the Negoro, to let the new female fighter Mon work for him. Doi resigns his office, complaining that he is ill. Iemitsu assigns Matsudaira as Chief Chamberlain, Yagyu as Inspector General, and shuffles his cabinet to deal with his brother's potential attempt to seize the shogunate. The nobles in Kyoto will not appoint a new shogun and refuse to take a side, forcing the brothers to resolve the matter between themselves. Bekki Shōzaemon, commander of Suruga, cuts down the Negoro banners that the warriors have set up. Lord Date in Sendai offers to help Tadanaga and sends his daughter for him to marry. Doi helps Tadanaga gather the support of various powerful lords. Ogasawara Genshinsai, a fighter as famous as Yagyu, also agrees to help Tadanaga in exchange for being appointed his fencing instructor once Tadanaga becomes shogun. The Negoro warriors and the Yagyu siblings attack Doi at night but Karasuma Ayamaro stops them and kills one of Yagyu's sons. Yagyu sends Mon to work in Lady Kasuga's harem to guard Prince Iemitsu. Genshinsai visits and challenges Yagyu, who claims that he cannot fight because he is the prince's fencing instructor, then draws his sword and cuts through the wall behind him where Jubei is hiding, cutting his face and blinding him in his left eye. Jubei also manages to injure Genshinsai's hand before he flees. Genshinsai seeks out the help of his old apprentice Yukinojo, who is now working as a kabuki performer. Hayate dresses as a handmaiden and attacks Iemitsu. Mon jumps in front of the weapon and saves his life but sustains a moderate injury. Hayate sneaks into her room at night and brings her some medicine for her wound. The Yagyu siblings and Negoro warriors attack Tadanaga on Minobu Road. Sagenta, leader of the Negoro, and Akane are killed during the battle. Yagyu sends Jubei to Kyoto to eliminate the troublesome nobles. Jubei kills Lord Ayamaro. Sanjo Saneeda meets with Yagyu, who accuses him of orchestrating disputes in an attempt to fight Tokugawa and restore imperial control. Iemitsu plans to apologize to the emperor in Kyoto in exchange for being appointed as the new shogun, but Tadanaga learns of this and heads to Kyoto himself to reach the emperor first. Rifles are sent to the Negoro warrior with instructions to attack on Iemitsu at Kisei River on the morning of November 8, 1624, but they find the litter empty and realize that it is a trap, whereupon they are fired upon by waiting riflemen. Amano Gyobu kills the envoy Sanjo but is shot and left for dead. Tadanaga is informed of the attack and realizes that it was set up by Iemitsu, so he turns back. Following Yagyu's advice, Iemitsu sends letters to the lords denouncing Tadanaga for the attack in order to gain their aid in his attack on Tadanaga. All of the lords side with Iemitsu, even Lord Date, who refuses to send his daughter to marry Tadanaga. Iemitsu has Lord Ando occupy Sunpu Castle, Tadanaga's estate. Tadanaga decides to surrender in order to spare the lives of his men, but his retainer Bekki refuses to surrender and charges at Ando's men, only to be shot dead. Tadanaga surrenders and is exiled to Takasaki. Jubei becomes a wandering ronin. Okuni visits the lord of Owari at Nagoya Castle to dance for him. Sanza, who was blinded in the attack on Iemitsu, explains to the lord that the attack was a trick orchestrated on Iemitsu's behalf and the Negoro had never truly been working for Tadanaga. Yagyu brings orders from Iemitsu that Tadanaka is to perform seppuku, which he does. Most of the Negoro are slaughtered on their land by imperial soldiers. Sanza kills Okuni at her request. Genshinsai arrives and challenges Yagyu but is defeated and killed. Yubei finds the slaughtered Negoro, including his own children, and Hayate and Mon explain that the soldiers were led by the traitor Matajuro. Iemitsu is appointed shogun. He tells his dead father that he has no regrets and sends Yagyu a message that the Yagyu Shikage school shall continue. Jubei beheads Iemitsu and throws his head at Yagyu's feet, then chops off Yagyu's right hand. Yagyu wanders away holding the head in his remaining hand, insisting that it must be a dream.

The station broadcast covers Campbelltown, Camden and Wollondilly Shire. It is located at the Campbelltown RSL Club, Campbelltown, New South Wales.  History  MCR started operations on 22 August 1989, which was the date of MCR's first public meeting. Broadcasting on 89.9FM due to licensing issues, new stations were allowed to broadcast for a total of 28 days per year. MCR didn't have their own equipment and had to borrow the necessary equipment to broadcast for 28 days. MCR split these 28 days up into four seven-day broadcasts which took place in makeshift temporary studios located at: * St. Gregory's College, Campbelltown * Western Suburbs Leagues Club, Leumeah * Leumeah High School, Leumeah Eventually, MCR moved to a permanent location—a house in Ingleburn which was swiftly converted into MCR's headquarters. \\"Radio House\\" was officially opened on 7 November 1993. = Radio House = In 1993, Campbelltown City Council donated to the station \\"Radio House\\"—an old double brick house just off the main shopping street in Ingleburn NSW. \\"Radio House\\" became a landmark icon for the station for a few years as a fixture to the station staying put in one place. This encouraged support from local businesses as well as more of the general public signing up to the station to become members in either support or to have a programme on air. An Open Day at Radio House was held on 7 November 1993 in which several community groups attended, including the local Fire Brigade and the Campbelltown Spoon Club. This was during MCR's first broadcast at Radio House. For five years, MCR broadcast from Radio House until 1998, when MCR had to vacate the premises in order for the council to pull down the house to make way for a new shopping plaza carpark. After putting out the call for an urgent new location in the local papers, an appropriate place was found in a shopping fitout in the City Arcade, Campbelltown. This space was generously donated by the at-the-time owner(s) of the City Arcade. MCR moved into the new premises promptly within the same year they moved out of Ingleburn, and the City Arcade location became the \\"New Radio House\\". In 2002, the City Arcade was purchased by the Campbelltown RSL Club, which had just built new premises behind the Arcade. The station moved premises to inside the main doorway of the RSL Club. = Casual to full time broadcasting = MCR began broadcasting on 89.9FM as a casual basis for 28 days a year in 1989. After much discussion, the committee at the time split up the 28-day broadcasting limit to seven-day weeks, four weeks a year. In the mid 1990s, the station changed frequency to 100.5FM. This continued until 1998 when a temporary yearly license was issued to the station, enabling MCR to broadcast every day, 365 days a year. In 1999, MCR changed frequencies from 100.5FM to 100.3FM due to conflicting issues with other stations. In 2001 MCR was granted a permanent full-time license, which came with a name change to 2MCR. In 2013, 2MCR changed their logo and also changed the name of the station. THE HEART OF MACARTHUR was replaced with THE SOUNDS OF MACARTHUR. The station also changed their name to 100.3FM 2MCR, but still keeping 2mcr as its call sign. = World record attempt = From 1 to 5 June 2002, station member Matt Fulton set a new milestone in the world of radio, beating the Guinness World Record for Longest Radio DJ Marathon by just over an hour. The stunt saw Matt stay on air non-stop (with authorised breaks provided by Guinness) for a length of 4 days 7 hours 14 minutes and 36 seconds. The attempt attracted national attention, including various guests and celebrities. Channel 10's Rove Live conducted a live cross 81 hours into the attempt. A large crowd witnessed the final moment countdown outside and inside the studios.

Geography Panorama with the Ober Gabelhorn (left) and the Dent Blanche (right) The Ober Gabelhorn lies in the Swiss canton of Valais at the southern end of the Zinal valley (part of the Val d'Anniviers). It rises, together with the Dent Blanche (west) and the Zinalrothorn (north), above the Zinal Glacier. On the south side lies the Zmutt Glacier in the valley of Zmutt, which extends west of Zermatt. The Ober Gabelhorn has a pyramidal shape, similar to the nearby Matterhorn but on a smaller scale. Only the smooth north face is completely glaciated, the other faces being mostly rocky. The south-west ridge is called the Arbengrat while the north-north-west ridge is the Arête du Coeur. The south-east ridge looking over the Ober Gabeljoch (3,597 m) is the Gabelhorngrat. The Wellenkuppe is a lower prominence on the north-east ridge; it is usually climbed as part of the normal route. Huts serving the peak are the Rothorn Hut (3,198 m), the Grand Mountet Hut (2,886 m) and the Arben Bivouac (3,224 m). Climbing history The first ascent was by A. W. Moore, Horace Walker and Jakob Anderegg on 6 July 1865, via the east face. The second ascent of the peak, and the first by the north-north-west ridge, was made one day later by Lord Francis Douglas, Peter Taugwalder and Joseph Vianin on 7 July 1865. At the time of their ascent they were not aware of Moore and party's success on the previous day. The east side of the mountain with the Wellenkuppe (right) Douglas and Taugwalder made several attempts before they reached the summit. P. Inäbnit accompanied them on the first attempt from the south-east ridge. They didn't have enough time to go higher than the base of the mountain. On the second attempt they reached the Wellenkuppe (3,900 m) on the north-east ridge (the normal route today) but they considered that the ridge above was too difficult to continue. They finally reached the summit on their third attempt (Inäbnit having been replaced by Viennin).Helmut Dumler,Willi P. Burkhardt, Les 4000 des Alpes, They were disconcerted to see some footprints on the east face (made by Moore, Walker and Anderegg on the previous day), but were relieved that no traces were visible on the summit. Not aware of the dangers that might have made the previous expedition turn back, they sat down on the summit to have lunch. Suddenly an avalanche started and everything on the summit began to fall away from them. Douglas and Taugwalder were swept away, but they were roped to Viennin who was a little distance below the summit. Viennin was able to belay Taugwalder and Douglas with the rope, which didn't break. Francis Douglas returned to Zermatt, and was killed a week later on 14 July on the first ascent of the Matterhorn. The south side The Arbengrat was first climbed in 1874 by H. S. Hoare and E. Hulton with guides J. von Bergen, P. Rubi and J. Moser. The route on the Gabelhorngrat was opened three years later by J. Walker Hartley, W. E. Davidson, P. Rubi and J. Juan. The north face, similar to but 'rather steeper' than the north-east face of the Lenzspitze,Collomb, Robin G., Pennine Alps Central, London: Alpine Club, 1975, p. 92 was first climbed on 30 July 1930 by H. Kiener and R. Schwarzgruber. They started from Zermatt at midnight and made a direct 2,000-metre ascent to the Triftjoch. They reached the base of the north face after having traversed the crevasses of the Ober Gabelhorn Glacier and successfully climbed it. This route was repeated only once until 1951. Christian Klucker and L. Norman-Neruda made the first ascent of the east-north-east ridge on 1 August 1890. Nowadays most of the climbers use this route, starting at the Rothorn Hut (above Zermatt) and passing over the summit of the Wellenkuppe. The major obstacle, the Klucker tower, is equipped with ropes since 1918. See also *List of 4000 metre peaks of the Alps References * Dumler, Helmut and Willi P.

Enraged by insults from the court official Kira, Asano draws his sword but is prevented from killing him. Asano is sentenced to seppuku, his land and property are seized by the shogunate, and the Asano name is abolished. Several disciples of Asano, upset about the one- sided verdict, vow to return to Edo to take vengeance on Kira. They wait a year for an opportune time to make their move. Kira retires and Tsunayoshi's follower Lord Yanagisawa sends Kira to Yonezawa. Hashimoto and Horibe of the Asano clan hastily choose to ambush him en route against orders but are stopped by spies and other members of their clan and Hashimoto is injured. Yanagisawa dispatches three criminals to kill Oishi, the only perceived threat. Oishi divorces his wife and sends her and their younger children to her father's home but keeps his eldest son and heir Chikara with him. The three attackers enter Oishi's house and attack but the ronin Fuwa, who is living in the woods near his former master Oishi's home, intervenes and kills them, saving Oishi and Chikara. Lord Kira's attendant Kobayashi Heihachiro attempts to slay Oishi but kills a different man who happens to be sleeping in his room. Kobayashi visits Hashimoto, who is unable to work due to his leg injury, forcing his wife into prostitution. Kobayashi offers him 50 ryo to reveal the location of Oishi. Hashimoto refuses and attacks with his sword but is overpowered. Kobayashi leaves the money and says that he already knows that Oishi is in Edo. When Kira goes to Uesugi mansion in Sakurada, Oishi tells the clan that the raid will take place the following night. Jujiro delivers the message to Hashimoto, who is now unable to fight and angrily draws his sword on his fellow clan member delivering the message. His wife stabs him in an attempt to stop him and he kills her as well, proclaiming that it is Oishi's fault for waiting too long, then he kills himself. Jujiro brings their infant daughter to Oishi. The Ako warriors descend on an inn where Kira is sleeping following a tea ceremony. Fuwa defeats Kobayashi after a long battle, then they search the house for those who are hiding. Kira is found and they blow a whistle to summon Oishi, who kills him. Asano's wife is told of their success and she is overcome with regret that 47 ronin have now sacrificed themselves for one man. Yanagisawa views their act as an attack on the infallibility of the shogunate and sentences them all to seppuku but the shogunate also abolishes the name Kira.

Gordon herself wrote the screenplay. The film was directed by George Cukor and stars Jean Simmons, Spencer Tracy, Teresa Wright, and Anthony Perkins in his film debut. The film is basically a series of vignettes involving Ruth, her parents, her best friends, and the college boy romantically pursuing her. Although Gordon did in fact become an accomplished Academy Award-winning actress and a successful writer, the film ends without the audience seeing Gordon achieve her goals. The film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Costume Design, Black-and-White. Tracy won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture Actor in a Drama and was nominated for a BAFTA for Best Foreign Actor. Simmons was named Best Actress by the National Board of Review, and Gordon's screenplay was nominated Best Written American Comedy by the Writers Guild of America, despite being far more dramatic than comedic.IMDB Awards Plot In 1913, Wollaston, Massachusetts, teenage student Ruth Gordon Jones (Jean Simmons) dreams of a theatrical career after becoming mesmerized by a performance of The Pink Lady in a Boston theater. Encouraged to pursue her dream by real-life leading lady Hazel Dawn (Kay Williams) in response to a fan letter she sent her, Ruth schemes to drop out of school and move to New York City, unbeknownst to her father, Clinton Jones (Spencer Tracy), a former seaman now working at a menial factory job, who wants her to continue her education and become a physical education instructor instead. As a young man, Clinton's bad family situation forced him to drop out of school and run away to sea, so he is dismayed that his daughter rejects the educational opportunities he would have liked for himself. In addition to overcoming her father's objections, Ruth must also deal with her feelings for Fred Whitmarsh (Anthony Perkins), a handsome Harvard University student who falls in love with her and eventually proposes marriage. When Ruth gets the chance to audition for a leading producer, she disobeys her father and puts off Fred's serious romantic overtures to keep the appointment. However, her audition proves disastrous and crushes her confidence and enthusiasm. She confesses to her father what she has done, and after getting over his initial anger, he offers to support her during her first few months in New York if she will at least get her high school diploma. Despite his promise, Clinton is not sure where he will get the support money for Ruth, and is anxious about his job security. He counts on his annual bonus to provide the necessary funds, but his employer is slow in paying it. Her enthusiasm restored, Ruth makes the arrangements to go to New York after graduation. On the day she is scheduled to depart, Clinton suddenly loses his job after confronting his boss about his bonus, leaving him with no money to give to Ruth. When Clinton sees that Ruth is determined to go to New York even without his monetary support, he gives her his most prized possession, his treasured spyglass from his seafaring days, to sell in New York, where his old acquaintance will buy it from her for an even larger sum than the amount Clinton originally promised Ruth.

The documentary, depicting the American Midwestern city of Madison, Indiana was filmed by Josef von Sternberg in 1943 and released in 1945. Synopsis The Town is a 1943 American documentary film whose subject is the Midwestern town of Madison, Indiana. Endorsed by the United States Office of War Information (OWI), which oversaw propaganda during World War II, the 11-minute film presents Madison “as the model American town where citizens embodied American ideals and values.” Filmed by the acclaimed Hollywood director Josef von Sternberg, the camera showcases the people of Madison – many of whom were European immigrants – in their “public libraries, corner drugstores, schoolhouses and public swimming pools.” The Town was created as part of The American Scene series and “shown overseas to remind troops what they were fighting to preserve and to demonstrate American cultural values to foreigners. It was translated into 32 languages.”Sutpen, 2006National Park Service, no date The Academy Film Archive preserved The Town in 2012. The film is part of the Academy War Film Collection, one of the largest collections of World War II era short films held outside government archives. Theme Sternberg's portrait of Madison, Indiana in the sun-drenched summer of 1943 serves to artistically unite the Old World influences brought by European immigrants with the “progressive social and political ideas of the New World.”Baxter, 1971. P. 158 Sternberg opens the documentary show-casing “an Italian campanile, a palladian portico, a Renaissance fountain” as if these were features from a European travelogue. The audience is disabused of that impression when a narrator identifies the structures as the functional and egalitarian architecture of a small Mid-western community: “the fountain belongs to the local swimming pool, a courthouse, the portico to a courthouse and the campanile is the Madison Fire Brigade bell-tower.” The citizenry of Madison, some identifiable ethnically as Austrian, Greek, Swedish and French are all active in work and social life. Employing tracking and dissolve shots, Sternberg's camera explores the social institutions in town and country, urban and rural, as well as quiet and secure suburban streets and homes.Baxter, 1971.

Though the state appealed and successfully sought a stay of the ruling to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, the United States Supreme Court struck down same-sex marriage bans nationwide on identical grounds in the matter of Obergefell v.

Today, 31 October 1757, he was baptized by the vicar of this parish. He was born yesterday, the legitimate son of Pierre, a maker of wooden shoes, and Jeanne Moyné Cottereau, his wife. The godparents were Pierre Amy, a cousin of the child, and Marie Crouillebois, also a cousin of the child.\\" It was signed by the father, the godmother, a 'J. Le Bourdais', possibly the vicar, and a 'M. Gallot', another priest. and died 18 July 1794 in Olivet, Mayenne. He was a counter-revolutionary, an insurrectionist and a staunch royalist.George J. Hill, The Story of the War in La Vendée and the Little Chouannerie (New York: D. & J. Sadlier & Co. n.d.), pp. 179-180, 182-183. Of the four Cottereau brothers—Jean, Pierre, François, and René—Jean, the second-born, was the one called chouan (\\"the silent one\\") by their father. Others say his nickname came from an imitation of the call of the tawny owl (the chouette hulotte) he customarily used as a recognition signal.Albert Soboul (dir.), Dictionnaire historique de la Révolution française, Quadrige/PUF, 1989, p. 218, entry on \\"Chouans/Chouannerie\\" by Roger Dupuy Less flatteringly, Jean's young comrades nicknamed him \\"the boy liar\\" (le Gars mentoux or le garçon menteur).In the course of his activities as a smuggler, Jean Chouan often demonstrated his courage. Whenever he was intimidated or frightened, he had the habit of saying to his comrades: \\"Fear not; there is no danger.\\" These words, \\"there is no danger\\", became his motto, and he often repeated them, sometimes without reason. This explains his 'liar' nickname. The 1926 Luitz-Morat film Jean Chouan starred Maurice Lagrenée as Chouan. Reliability of sources Much of the biographical material on Jean Chouan is based on the work of Jacques Duchemin des Cépeaux, in a work written in 1825 at the request of the king, Charles X, who ruled France from 1824 until 1830. Cépeaux is unapologetically a royalist partisan, and he presents a number of claims that may be unfounded. The story of Jean Chouan is, therefore, almost certainly, in large part, legendary. The persistence of the legend can be explained by the fact it has been continuously nourished by a small faction of Catholics and royalist- legitimists who have remained active up to the present day. Chouan's role in history is, at best, questionable, and archives, even those belonging to aristocrats living in the region, indicate that he was completely unknown prior to the Bourbon restoration in 1814. One thing is certain: the republicans, in their effort to quell the insurgency, contributed to the birth of the legend. The name, Jean Chouan, may, in fact, have been invented by republican authorities who were unable to name the true leaders of the insurrection against their own 1789 revolution, the revolution that had unseated the royal house of Bourbon in the first place. There is, in much of the Jean Chouan material, a slight whiff of Robin Hood and his merry men. Chouan is a romantic hero who, with a small band of devoted followers living in the forest, stage courageous raids against a hated regime. How much of this is romantic legend and how much is historically factual will probably always be open to debate, but, in either case, the shoddiness of the history of this \\"hero\\" embarrasses many historians. The tales, true or not, have proved to be a rich source of literary inspiration. Most notably, Honoré de Balzac drew from this history in writing the last of his series of novels, La Comédie humaine—a work called \\"The Chouans\\". Nonetheless, it should be remembered that there is a history, indisputably true, associated with the figure of Jean Chouan; it is the history of a bloody and costly civil war in western France. Origins Pierre Cottereau, a lumberjack and maker of wooden shoes (sabots), lived with his wife, Jeanne Cottereau (born Jeanne Moyné), as a tenant at la Closerie des Poiriers (literally, the \\"pear orchard enclosure\\"), a farm halfway between the villages of Saint-Ouën-des-Toits and Bourgneuf-la-Forêt in Mayenne, France. (An 'enclosure' is, in fact, a small farm, usually less than twenty acres in extent, and the name comes from the need for farmers to enclose their properties with fences or hedges to prevent cattle, sheep, and other domesticated animals from running free.) Tenancy on this piece of property had been established by the Moyné family about 1750. The elder Cottereau, like his father before him, made his family's living by criss- crossing the wooded regions of western France, from the forest between Mondevert and Le Pertre to the forest of Concise, felling trees, stacking and seasoning the timber, and making wooden shoes, which he sold in the villages of Mayenne. From the local parish registers, particularly those of the parish of Olivet, where the Closerie des Poiriers was located, it is clear that this was a region deep in economic misery throughout the second half of the eighteenth century. For example, in several birth records, there is the notation, \\"né sur la lande\\" (born on the land), indicating that the child's parents were likely to have been casual workers sleeping rough. So great was the misery of the forge workers at Port-Brillet, owned by the prince of Talmont-Saint-Hilaire, Antoine Philippe de La Trémoille, that they took part in the French Revolution, joined the National Guard and became ardent Republican patriots. Workers in La Brûlatte behaved similarly. The Cottereau family came from a line of merchants, notaries, and priests, and, unlike most of his neighbors, Pierre was literate and respectable. His children, however, were violent, quarrelsome, lazy, and resolutely ignorant. Without doubt, their father's prolonged absences, cutting timber in distant forests, carving shoes, selling his sabots over a wide swath of Mayenne, deprived the Cottereau children of an authority figure. Further, since their mother was illiterate, as was common at that time, the Cottereau children were also largely unschooled. Their father died in 1778 when Jean Chouan was twenty-one years old. Pierre the younger, Jean's only elder brother, proclaimed himself a sabotier like his father, but he was neither so skillful nor so industrious as his father had been. To survive, all six Cottereaus, four brothers and two sisters, became involved in salt-smuggling. Before 1790, the gabelle was a very unpopular tax on salt. Traditionally, France has been composed of a collection of regions, former duchies, principalities, or independent kingdoms, most of which enjoyed long periods of sovereignty, periods when they were all-but-completely divorced, politically, from the rest of France. Well- known examples of the regions are Normandy, Burgundy, Brittany, and Aquitaine. As an accident of the historical development of an integrated France, these regions had different tax rates for commodities like salt. Whenever there is a disparity in prices or taxes between two neighboring jurisdictions, there will be smuggling. For example, La Croixille is a town in the department of Mayenne, which was (and is) a part of the region of Maine, in the eighteenth century, a high-salt-tax region. Across the River Vilaine, the neighboring town of Princé, was, with respect to salt, in a tax-exempt region, Brittany. The huge disparity between the price of salt in the two towns prompted active smuggling, with salt purchased cheaply in Brittany being moved across the river and sold for a high price in Mayenne. A perpetual guerrilla war between customs officers and salt-smugglers simmered in the valley of the Vilaine. Those who engaged in this tax-avoidance traffic were known as \\"false-salters\\". The term, \\"false-salter\\", referred to criminal attempts to falsely represent lightly taxed salt as salt that had already been heavily taxed. An unarmed person caught \\"false-salting\\" was subject to condemnation to the galleys and deportation; by law, an armed false-salter could be executed. Between 1730 and 1743, 585 salt-smugglers were deported to New France (Quebec). Jean Chouan and his brothers, François and René, were actively involved in this kind of commerce, and, although they knew the territory intimately, including all of the places in the forests of the borderlands where illicit salt might be hidden, they were stopped on several smuggling trips and narrowly avoided arrest. Aside from their smuggling activities, the Cottereaus conducted a number of shady enterprises in the Misedon woods that surrounded their house at the Closerie des Poiriers. Sometime before 1780, Jean Cottereau, in the company of his brother, René, and a few others, were in the forest drinking moonshine alcohol, in breach of the laws of Olivet, when they were surprised by two local constables, Pierre Bériteau and Jean Guitton. A brawl ensued. When it was over, a surgeon from Laval declared that one of the two was so badly injured that he could not stand to be transported to hospital. Instead, he was transported to an inn at Saint-Ouën-des-Toits, where he remained for several weeks. The Cottereaus, called before the bar of justice, were ordered to pay for the injured man's medical treatment, and for his room and board during the period of his confinement. This episode was just one of a large number of transgressions engaged in by Jean and his brothers. The thuggish Cottereaus, over a period of several years managed to injure or cripple almost all their neighbors, usually for nonsensical reasons, and, inevitably, one or more of them was brought to court and forced to pay compensation to their victims in order to avoid imprisonment or deportation. This ruined the family financially. Before the French Revolution In 1780, when he was twenty- three years old, Jean Chouan was a wanted man. He was being hunted down for having beaten a man named Marchais, who, he suspected, had informed the authorities about his salt-smuggling activities. He was also wanted for a more serious crime: with his friend, Jean Croissant, Chouan was alleged to have killed a customs agent, Olivier Jagu, with repeated blows of a billy-club, in a Saint-Germain-le-Fouilloux inn. Sentenced to death in absentia, his execution took place in effigy, along with that of his accomplice, Jean Croissant.The verdict read: \\"Et sera la présente sentence à l'encontre dudit Cottereau dit Chouan contumax exécutée par effigie en un tableau qui sera attachée à laditte potence par l'exécuteur de la haute justice.\\" He had gone into hiding by fleeing the area where he was well-known and enlisting, under a false name, in the 37th Infantry Regiment in Turenne in central France. Other sources indicate that his mother, suspecting that he had been abducted by the crown and summarily imprisoned (or executed), went to Versailles to ask for his pardon from the king. This is doubtful.Arrivée près du prince, elle oublia la leçon qu'on lui avait apprise, et demanda la vie pour son fils dans les termes que lui inspira sa tendresse. Le roi accorda la grâce... In fact, the possibility that Chouan was already in custody is contradicted by the fact that the proceedings initiated against him in 1780 were resumed in 1785. From family recollections and papers gathered by Jacques Duchemin Cépeaux, he concluded that Jean Chouan spent his time of absence in a distant garrison of the king's army.Qu'on ne retrouve à Lille ou ailleurs ni son nom de famille ni son nom de guerre sur les rôles, le fait est trop naturel pour qu'on s'en étonne. Jean Chouan was arrested on 18 May 1785 in Bourgneuf-la-Forêt. Under interrogation, he denied any participation in the murder of the customs agent, but he was sentenced to a year in prison anyway. He was more fortunate than his friend, Jean Croissant, who had been apprehended, tried, and convicted earlier. Chouan was not confronted by key witnesses; some were dead, others had recanted, and others were excused from testifying. Therefore, the prosecutor, Enjubault-Laroche, was unable to cobble together a strong case, and when it was heard on 9 September 1785, the result was a disappointing sentence, a single year in prison. Freed on 9 September 1786, Chouan was immediately rendered to the Dépôt de Mendicité in Rennes, under a decree postmarked 2 August 1786, and he stayed there three years.Cet établissement accueillait des individus originaires de Bretagne, du Maine, de Normandie et même de Touraine. Les pensionnaires n'y étaient détenus toutefois qu'en vertu d'un jugement prévôtal ou sur ordre du roi. Jean Chouan est donc bien condamné à une peine privative de liberté, mais qui ne peut être purgée dans une prison ordinaire, seulement dans un établissement de réinsertion sociale. À La lecture de la liste des détenus en 1787, et après consultation des archives municipales de Rennes, on peut aller jusqu'à dire qu'il s'agissait d'un asile d'aliénés. Upon his release, he took work as a servant in the household of Marie Le Bourdais, the widow of Alexis Ollivier, a cousin, then living in Chouan's home parish of Olivet. The widow's son was a priest, Alexis Ollivier, so Chouan took on an air of semi-respectability that helped to deflect any new suspicions about his criminal character.As for Jean Chouet's newfound respectability, Marie Le Bourdais, the daughter of a notary, was the wife of Alexis Ollivier, also the son of a notary. A woman of some considerable means, she bought nearly everything for sale in her parish. Her son, Father Alexis Ollivier, benefactor of Jean Chouan, owned several farms in Olivet and in Genest. Her brother, Jean Le Bourdais, who was the godfather of Pierre Cottereau, Jean's father, was a merchant. On his mother's, Jeanne Moyné's, side of the family, there was Pierre Anjuère, a priest-vicar of the parish of Saint-Pierre-la-Cour, and Nicolas Moyné, priest-vicar of Croixille, who had a good deal of land in that parish and in the parish of Bourgon, some of which was leased to Julien Pinçon and Pierre Huet, both of whom became notorious insurrectionists during the Chouannerie, q.v. Discontent The French Revolution broke out in 1789, and it soon became apparent that the victorious republicans intended not only to overturn the monarchy but to redefine relations between the State and the Roman Catholic Church as well. Laws were passed by the new National Constituent Assembly (Assemblée constituante) to reform the Church and, little by little, to erode its traditional powers and prerogatives. For example, on 11 August 1789, tithes were abolished. On 2 November 1789, Catholic Church property, chiefly farmland and other real estate, held for the purpose of generating church revenue, was nationalized. On 13 February 1790, monastic vows were forbidden, and all ecclesiastical orders and congregations were dissolved, excepting those devoted to teaching children and nursing the sick. On 19 April 1790, the administration of all remaining church property was transferred to the State. The final stroke was the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (Constitution civile du clergé), passed on 12 July 1790, which entirely subordinated the Roman Catholic Church in France to the French government. Going forward, bishops (known as constitutional bishops) and priests were to be elected locally, and those casting ballots, the 'electors', were required to sign an oath affirming their loyalty to the constitution. There was no requirement that the electors be Catholic, so this created the ironic situation that Protestants and Jews could elect nominally Catholic priests and bishops. Under the Civil Constitution, new bishops were required to swear their loyalty to the State in far stronger terms than they ever had under any prevailing religious doctrine. From the beginning of 1791, landowning priests were forced from their parishes, and they were replaced by elected priests, without property, who had sworn an oath to the Civil Constitution.De fait, les prêtres devenaient des fonctionnaires payés qui devaient consacrer la totalité de leur temps à leurs tâches sacerdotales, ce qui bouleversait totalement le mode de vie des ecclésiastiques habitués à vivre de leurs terres. More importantly, the possessions of the clergy, and other property which had been owned by the Church for centuries, were put up for sale in order to refill the coffers of the royal treasury, which, as had become painfully obvious during the crisis of the Estates-General, were virtually empty.Father Alexis Ollivier owned several small farms and homesteads, at Olivet and at Genest. With the confiscation of his property, the priest-benefactor was left without a means of supporting himself. (Clerical lands had usually been leased to tenants with the lease going to the highest bidder.) Jean Chouan found himself jobless as well. Naturally, reactions to these new laws were strong and varied. A substantial number of French citizens heartily approved, and even the reformist faction within the Church could not find fault with some of the measures, especially those that denied the Church the right to continue to operate like a business, rather than as a spiritual institution. Others were adamantly, even violently, opposed. Predictably, those who abhorred the ecclesiastical reforms were also those who, most doggedly, supported the monarchy. Reactions also varied geographically. An interesting indicator of local sentiment was the percentage of priests who were willing to swear allegiance to the new Constitution. In dioceses near Paris and in the southeast, more than nine of ten priests were willing to take the oath. On the other hand, the percentage of swearing priests was lowest in Brittany, in some small pockets in the northeast, and in Nîmes and Toulouse in the south, all between one-third and one-half. Jean Chouan, given his situation as a displaced employee of the abbé, Alexis Ollivier, could not remain passive.

In 1972, a wooden dome was erected to replace the tent and the capacity doubled to 3,200. The 70s drew in more concerts, as well as boxing and other sporting events. By the 1980s, the allure of the venue began to flicker. Despite its wooded dome, the venue continued to operate seasonally. With the theatre in the round buzz going out of style, the venue began to suffer financially. In 1989, Segal sold the venue to Robert Errato, who later created the Oakdale Development Limited Partnership. Initially, Errato wanted to take the property and convert it into condominiums with office/retail space. After the community protested the change, (stating the theatre was considered a landmark to its residents) Errato abandoned his plans. Later, he went to the city council and proposed an $80 million plan to improve the theatre, but also used the acreage to include an office park and retail shops. Once again, the community were against his plans, stating the changes would bring unnecessary traffic and the changes would ruin the \\"country\\" setting of the town. In 1994, Errato was eventually able to push forward with plans to renovate the theatre. The $21 million renovation included removing the central stage and giving the venue an auditorium-style seating. This meant the venue would erect a new building, while the wooded dome would be gutted and converted into a grand lobby. The new theater (and new name) debuted July 7, 1996, with a concert by Brooks & Dunn. In 1997, concerts began to take place in the former wooded dome, which gave birth to \\"The Dome at Oakdale\\". In 1998, SFX Entertainment purchased operating rights for $12 million. =Naming changes= *Oakdale Musical Theatre *Oakdale Theatre *SNET Oakdale Theatre *ctnow.com Oakdale Theatre *careerbuilder.com Oakdale Theatre *Chevrolet Theatre *Toyota Oakdale Theatre Legal disputes In 1998, the owners were served a cease-and-desist letter by the Town of Wallingford. In 1989, the venue was given a permit stating there could not be any double performances during the work-week. Famed illusionist David Copperfield was booked for a Wednesday and Thursday performance. The case was taken to the New Haven Superior Court and ruled in favor of Wallingford. In 2002, owner Robert Errato sued operator Clear Channel Entertainment. Errato claimed Clear Channel served him with a termination letter and was no longer allowed on the property. Clear Channel claimed Errato violated several contract terms, including planning building inspections without consulting Clear Channel. From the case, Clear Channel purchased the venue and the property. In December 2014, Town Planner Kacie Costello issued the venue another cease-and-desist letter, this time over noise ordinance. According to the letter, The Dome at Oakdale was listed as a lobby/reception area and not a performing arts venue. The noise from concerts in the Dome received several complaints from the neighboring homes. Many residents felt the \\"landmark\\" would close down. A Facebook campaign was created and many residents took to the streets to protest. Despite the letter, Live Nation stated they will continue to book concerts in the auditorium and dome. In May 2015, the Town of Wallingford decided to lift the order however the theatre still had to adhere to several ordinances regarding the noise issue. Jim Koplik, president of Live Nation Connecticut requested a state grant for $1.2 million to add soundproofing to the Dome. However, the State requested Koplik issues a 10-percent fee to all tickets sold. Koplik withdrew his request from funding stating it would be unfair to add the admissions tax.

In a senior career that started in 1969, he played for West Ham United, Cardiff City, Lincoln City and Grimsby Town, where he later became a coach and, briefly, caretaker manager. Career Born in Stratford, Grotier started playing as a goalkeeper at primary school but his early career was curtailed once he moved on to West Ham Tech, with the presence of the West Ham Schools goalkeeper restricting him to the role of understudy. He was spotted by Clapton and played in various Sunday leagues in the local area, before being approached by West Ham United chief scout Wally St Pier. After playing a game for the Hammers in the South East Counties League early in the 1966–67 season, he signed forms for a year-long apprenticeship on the day of his 16th birthday. After signing professional forms a year later, he was part of the West Ham A team which, as well as winning trophies in the Metropolitan League, won the Southern Junior Floodlit Cup in 1967 and again in 1969, when they also won the South East Counties League Cup. Grotier made his first team debut for West Ham on 19 April 1969, a First Division encounter against Tottenham Hotspur. The game was the culmination of an eight-day period in which he also played for the youth team and the 'A' team, as well as two reserve games. He played for the club until 1974, mostly as understudy to Bobby Ferguson. He went loan to Cardiff City in 1963, and then spent a month at Lincoln City at the start of the 1974–75 season. West Ham were asking for at least £20,000 for his transfer and his stay at Lincoln was only made permanent after fans raised money for the fee. Grotier made a total of 263 League and cup appearances for Lincoln, including a run of 134 consecutive appearances, and was an ever-present during the 1975–76 season. His first two seasons at the club earned him spots in the PFA Division Four Team of the Year in both seasons. He signed for Cardiff City for £25,000 in 1979, but made only 38 League appearances for the Welsh side before moving on to Grimsby Town in 1982. He later became reserve-team coach at the club, and had a spell as caretaker manager in 1985. He made an appearance for the Mariners in an FA Cup game against Watford in 1986, at the age of 36.

In 2007 the UTS-Balmain club formed a partnership with the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust and are now known as Sydney CC or Sydney Cricket Club or just simply Sydney Tigers. The Tigers play out of Drummoyne Oval. With over 100 years of history and tradition, Balmain have long been a mainstay of the competition. In season 2007/08 there were 14 different sides representing the black and gold, eight of these men's and six women's. After the merger with the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust, the club is often seen as the competition's glamour club.  History of Balmain At the turn of the 20th century, a club by the name of Sydney Cricket Club was in existence and playing regular fixtures. Based at Moore Park, players included Jack Marsh. From 1897–1900, a team known as the Balmain Electorate Cricket Club was included in the Sydney grade cricket competition. They joined teams known as East Sydney, Paddington, Waverley, Glebe, South Sydney, Burwood, North Sydney, Redfern, Central Cumberland and Leichhardt. Between 1900 and 1904, the team was renamed the Leichhardt-Balmain District Cricket Club and from 1904 it became known as the Balmain District Club. In 2001–2002, the Club entered into a partnership with the University of Technology, Sydney and was then known as UTS Balmain Cricket Club. In over 100 years of competition, the Club has won 7 Club Championships, 4 first grade premierships and a number of lower grade premierships but the history of cricket is liberally sprinkled with players from Balmain who represented their State and Country with distinction. Throughout the period from 1897 to 1946–47, Birchgrove Oval was the headquarters of the club and it was 1947–48 when the club moved to Drummoyne Oval. The most famous game ever played by Balmain was undoubtedly the one at Birchgrove on 18 and 25 March 1933 when around 10,000 people attended each day to watch St George with Don Bradman and Balmain with Arthur Mailey. For the record, the match ended in a draw – Balmain 394 – St George 7/358 (Bradman 134). Probably the most famous Balmain players are Archie Jackson and Arthur Mailey, but the list of international and state players who played with Balmain at one time or another is star studded. They hold claim to finding Tasmanian Tigers sensation Brendan Drew and were once the home of Graham Thorpe, Nathan Bracken and Ireland 2007 World Cup hero Jeremy Bray. The highest first grade run scorer of all time is, however, former opening batsman Greg Hayne, who retired at the end of the 2006/07 season, who also heads the list of those who have scored the most centuries for the club. Following the decision to merge with the SCG Trust the club has experienced a significant financial windfall, allowing them to assemble one of the better squads in the competition, including the purchase of recently de-listed players Dominic Thornley and Daniel Smith and English representatives Joe Denly and Sam Northeast. Due to this, they were successful in the First Grade Twenty20 competition in 2010/11, but were unable to make a significant challenge for the First Grade premiership.

Accusations of plagiarism of Bill Hicks  Although Leary had been friends with fellow comedian Bill Hicks for many years, when Hicks heard No Cure For Cancer, he felt that Leary had stolen his act. The friendship ended abruptly as a result, and was still unsettled when Hicks died of pancreatic cancer 13 months later, at the age of 32. Over the years, several comedians have publicly stated they believe Leary stole Hicks' persona and attitude, in addition to his material. Jokes on the album about Keith Richards, Judas Priest, smoking and \\"good men dying young\\" are frequently cited as bearing similarities to Hicks' routines. In the August 2006 Playboy, an interviewer told Leary, \\"Much has been written about you and comedian Bill Hicks...People have accused you of appropriating his persona and material.\\" Leary replied: According to Cynthia True's biography American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story, after listening to No Cure For Cancer, Hicks was furious. \\"All these years, aside from the occasional jibe, he had pretty much shrugged off Leary's lifting. Comedians borrowed, stole stuff and even bought bits from one another. Milton Berle and Robin Williams were famous for it. This was different.

He is best known within the hardcore genre for his distinctive vocals in the bands Shai Hulud, Culture, Morning Again, and As Friends Rust. He has contributed to over 15 bands, though only a few have released any recorded work. Musical history Moyal's first band was U.S. Decline. During his time in the band they never recorded but did play shows. He soon after moved on to short stints in Insist (in mid to late 1992, which included a demo tape), Reach and HandOverFist (both in 1993). In 1994 he joined Culture, who had previously recorded a demo tape and were looking for a vocalist. The band landed a release contract with Conquer the World Records and immediately started to record material for what would become the ground breaking success Born of You. Not long after the release of the LP, conflicts between Moyal and John Wylie led to his leaving of the band. He then went on to front in the very first line-up of Shai Hulud, recording their original demo, landing the record deal with Revelation Records. However, before the band got to record any further material, he was asked to leave the band. By late 1995, Wylie had also left Culture and was forming his new band, Morning Again (also with other ex-Culture members). Moyal was asked to join in hopes of reconciliation. This was the inspiration for the song \\"Turning Over\\" from their debut The Cleanest War. Moyal also participated on the band's sophomore release, a self-titled 7\\" vinyl released on Intention Records. Morning Again gained international popularity and became the first American band signed to Belgian record label Good Life Recordings; the record label released a compilation of the band's first two releases as Hand of Hope. During this time, he also joined up with Crestfallen's reincarnation as Bird of Ill Omen. After this he joined the band Wayside, who quickly changed its name to As Friends Rust (named after lyrics from a Bird of Ill Omen song). After being kicked out of Morning Again, he rejoined Culture, where he would remain until their breakup. Using his connections with Good Life Records, he focused the attention to Culture who gained popularity in Europe during the next two years. Steve Looker from Morning Again wanted desperately to get As Friends Rust back together, and so a new line up was formed. This became Moyal's sole band during the next two years until they went under a second hiatus. Bridgeburne R was then formed as a 1980s punk band, until As Friends Rust got back together. With a new line-up of AFR musicians, the band lasted two more years but Damien quit right before their final release on Equal Vision Records. Damien immediately started witting solo under his pseudonym Damien Done. In 2003 he was featured on the Pandabite song “Painkiller” which was a never officially released. He was also featured on albums by Loyal Frisby and Grey Goose. His last band effort was with Best Wishes in 2006 before he moved to Michigan. In 2008, As Friends Rust reunited for one week of shows (one in Florida, and 6 in Europe) to much fanfare. In 2011, Moyal announced that new As Friends Rust songs were being written,http://www.punknews.org/article/44013 and also formed a new hardcore project with former Culture founder Rich Thurston called On Bodies. Art history Damien Moyal is also a graphic artist, having done artwork for many of his past bands. Some of his released work include the artwork for The Fists of Time, Heteronome and Love Thongs, as well as logos for a multitude of bands he was in including Bird of Ill Omen's early logos and shirt designs, with a multitude of Culture shirt designs and unreleased artwork. Many of the unreleased material was to be included in a book to be pressed on Good Life Recordings in the late 1990s, but by 2000 had fallen through, as Moyal was displeased with the chosen content (short stories, drawings and lyrics).

The empire wanted to prevent the formation of another semi-autonomous Armenian region in the eastern vilayets after its defeat in the First Zeitun Rebellion. In Sason, the Armenian national liberation movement recruited young Armenians. Background The Social Democrat Hunchakian Party and the Armenian Revolutionary Federation were two elements of the Armenian national movement which were active in the region. The first Sasun resistance was led by the Armenian national movement's militia, which belonged to Hunchak. According to Cyrus Hamlin, the Armenians triggered hostilities. Conflicts continued between the Armenian fedayeen (Armenian irregular forces) and the Muslim Ottomans in Armenian villages. Many Armenians were compelled to accept Islam or Orthodoxy; the latter was protected by the Russian consulate. In spring 1902 a representative of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, Vahan Manvelyan, was sent to Sason to negotiate a ceasefire with the Turks, to occupy the area and concentrate forces for a larger revolt to be led by Manvelyan and local activist Hrayr Tjokhk. This consolidation continued during 1902 and 1903. In May 1903, a militia led by Gorgos \\"Marrik\\" arrived in Sasun. Vahan and Hrayr considered it too small, and sent a party east with a request for more troops. In September a group of 150 fedayeen, led by Khan and Onik, was sent. At the Persian-Turkish border, it was surrounded by Turkish artillery troops and almost completely destroyed. In February 1903 in Sofia, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) agreed to send troops to Sason. By this time, approaches to Sasun had been blocked by a division of the 4th Corps of the Ottoman army (eight battalions, later increased to fourteen). The total force comprised as many as 10,000 soldiers and policemen, in addition to 6,000–7,000 irregular Kurdish cavalry. Armenian forces consisted of 200 guerrillas under the command of Vahan, Hrayr and Andranik, along with Kevork Chavoush, Murad of Sebastia, Keri and others. Untrained peasants in 21 villages also took up arms, swelling the insurgency to 1,000. Andranik suggested inciting a general revolt in Armenia which would disperse the Turkish forces; Hrayr objected that an Armenian revolt, unsupported by other factions of the Ottoman Empire, would be doomed and suggested concentrating on the defense of Sasun. Armed conflicts The first military action was undertaken by Kevork Chavush against local Kurds (Kor Slo) to prevent an attack on five Armenian villages in Kurdish-occupied territory. On January 17, 1904, with groups of Murad Sebastatsi and Seyto he attacked the Kurds, who (with Turkish troops) retreated to Pasrur. The western ARF and the Catholicos tried to organize diplomatic pressure on Turkey. The Catholicos appealed to the great powers; English and French ambassadors in Constantinople had audiences with the sultan, but the Russian ambassador stood aside. The sultan agreed to send armies for the maintenance of law and order to Sasun. The ambassadors offered to negotiate on the sultan's behalf with the insurgents in Sasun. However, the Russian ambassador delayed; by the time they arrived in Sasun, military action was at fever pitch. Cathedral of the Forty Martyrs in Aleppo, Syria By March 20, 1904, the Turks had finished preparations for addressing the uprising, and armies had plundered a number of boundary villages (which, by order from Hrayr, did not resist). Local residents were imprisoned and tortured, but the Ottomans were unable to learn about the insurgents' plans. The Armenians plan of action was: Hrayr would defend Aliank and Shenik; Andranik, in Tapyk, would impede the Turks advance on Gelieguzan; Kevork Chavush would defend Ishkhanadzor, and Murad of Senastia, Akop Kotoian and Makar Spagantsi would defend Chaji Glukh. On April 2 the Turks began an unsuccessful attack with mountain guns. On April 10, the Wāli of Bitlis arrived with troops and the Armenian bishops of Bitlis and Muş. On April 11, the second battle began. About 7,000 Turkish horsemen rode into the village of Shenik; the Armenians closed in on them at the rear, trapping the Turks between Armenian positions in front and on the right and snow-capped mountains at the left. After a four- hour fight the Turks abandoned their horses and weapons and retreated into the mountains, pursued by the Armenians. On April 12, Surb Arakelots monastery prior Arakel presented a decree from the Catholicos recommending that the Armenians surrender in exchange for amnesty. The Armenian leaders, requesting a delay in responding, evacuated and burned several villages in Gelieguzan overnight. At dawn on April 13, the Turks began a new approach. The defense was split into two groups: one (under Sepukh and Murad of Sebastia) moved towards Brlik, and another (under Hrayr) moved into the mountains. Eight companies of Turks and 4,000 Kurdish horsemen attacked Gelieguzan, and Hrayr was killed at the beginning of the battle. Fierce hand-to-hand fighting began; from the eastern side of the village, Andranik and his troops struck in the Turkish rear. The Turks retreated, sustaining (according to press reports) as many as 136 deaths; the Armenians had seven killed and eight wounded. On April 14, the Turks unsuccessfully attacked again with reinforcements; by April 16, the residents of Ishkhanadzor had retreated to Talvorik. The Turks tried to cut off their path, but with the help of local troops they broke through. On April 17, a new attack (which also repulsed) was begun. On April 20, the Turks surrounded Gelieduzan with a mass artillery bombardment and fedayeen (led by Andranik) retreated to Talvorik by night. Up to 20,000 people (the population of five evacuated villages) fled—some to the mountains and others to the Mush plain—and were slaughtered. Talvorik held out until May 6, falling to Turkish reinforcements. Two hundred fedayeen between Таlvorik and Gelieguzan resisted until May 14 before retreating. The Turkish victory was accompanied by brutality: > Women have been stolen, their breasts cut off, their stomachs ripped, > children impaled, old men dismembered. Young girls withdrew in uncountable > set ... since May 5th, Turkish armies have wiped out one village after > another in Berdakh, Mkragom, Alikrpo, Avazakhiubr and Arnist.Correspondence > on events in Sasun. May 22, 1904//Sassoun et les atrocités hamidiennes, > interpellation. Les atrocités. Rapport officiel. Genéve, 1904, p. 27–32. According to estimates, from 3,000 to 8,000 people were killed and 45 villages destroyed. To hide traces of genocide from European observers, the Wāli of Bitlis gave orders to cut corpses into pieces and throw them into the Tigris. Aftermath The sultan decreed that Armenians were forbidden to return to Sasun; after diplomatic protests he relented, and 6,000 Armenians returned to the region.

The film stars the voices of John Mills and Peggy Ashcroft as the two main characters and was scored by Roger Waters. The film accounts a rural English couple's attempt to survive a nearby nuclear attack and maintain a sense of normality in the subsequent fallout. The film was Briggs' second collaboration with TVC, after their efforts with a special based on another work of his, The Snowman, in 1982. It was distributed by Recorded Releasing in the UK, and by Kings Road Entertainment in the United States. A subsequent graphic novel by Briggs, Ethel and Ernest (1998), makes it clear that Briggs based the protagonist couple in When the Wind Blows on his own parents. When the Wind Blows is a hybrid of traditional and stop-motion animation. The characters of Jim and Hilda Bloggs are hand-drawn, but their home and most of the objects in it are real objects that seldom move but are animated with stop motion when they do. The soundtrack album features music by David Bowie (who performed the title song), Roger Waters, Genesis, Squeeze, Hugh Cornwell and Paul Hardcastle. Plot  Jim and Hilda Bloggs are an elderly couple living in a tidy isolated cottage in rural Sussex, in southeast England. Jim frequently travels to the local town to read newspapers and keep abreast of the deteriorating international situation regarding the Soviet–Afghan War; while frequently misunderstanding some specifics of the conflict, he is fully aware of the growing risk of an all-out nuclear war with the Soviet Union. Jim is horrified at a radio news report stating that a war may be only three days away, and sets about preparing for the worst as instructed by his government-issued Protect and Survive pamphlets. As Hilda continues her daily routine, and their son Ron (living elsewhere), who is implied to have fallen into fatalistic despair, dismisses such preparations as pointless (referencing the song \\"We'll All Go Together When We Go\\" by Tom Lehrer), Jim builds a lean-to shelter out of several doors inside their home (which he consistently calls the \\"inner core or refuge\\" per the pamphlets) and prepares a stock of supplies. He also follows through seemingly strange instructions such as painting his windows with white paint and readying sacks to lie down in when a nuclear strike hits. Despite Jim's concerns, he and Hilda are confident they can survive the war, as they did World War II in their childhoods, and that a Soviet defeat will ensue. Hearing a warning on the radio of an imminent ICBM strike, Jim rushes himself and Hilda into their shelter, just escaping injury as distant shock waves batter their home. They remain in the shelter for a couple of nights, and when they emerge, they find all their utilities, services and communications have been destroyed by the nuclear blast. Over the following days, they gradually grow sick from exposure to the radioactive fallout, resulting in radiation poisoning. Ron and his wife Beryl are not heard from again, though their deaths are heavily implied. In spite of all this, Jim and Hilda stoically attempt to carry on, preparing tea and dinners on a camping stove, noting numerous errands they will have to run once the crisis passes, and trying to renew their evaporated water stock with (contaminated) rainwater. Jim keeps faith that a rescue operation will be launched to help civilians. Apparently oblivious to the dead animals, destroyed buildings and scorched, dead vegetation outside their cottage (aside from their own garden), they initially remain optimistic. However, as they take in the debris of their home, prolonged isolation, lack of food and water, growing radiation sickness, and confusion about the events that have taken place, the couple begins to fall into a state of despair. After a few days, the Bloggs are practically bedridden, and Hilda is despondent when her hair begins to fall out, after vomiting, developing painful sores and lesions and experiencing bleeding gums. Either in denial, unaware of the extent of the nuclear holocaust, unable to comprehend it, or trying to comfort Hilda, Jim is still confident that emergency services will eventually arrive, but they never do. The film ends with the dying Jim and Hilda getting into paper sacks, crawling back into the shelter, and praying. Jim begins with the Lord's Prayer, but, forgetting the lines, switches to \\"The Charge of the Light Brigade\\", whose militaristic and ironic undertones distress the dying Hilda, who weakly asks him not to continue. Finally, Jim's voice mumbles away into silence as he finishes the line, \\"...rode the Six Hundred...\\" Outside the shelter, the smoke and ash- filled sky begins to clear, revealing the sun rising through the gloom. At the very end of the credits, a Morse code signal taps out \\"MAD\\", which stands for mutual assured destruction. Cast * Peggy Ashcroft as Hilda Bloggs * John Mills as Jim Bloggs * Robin Houston as Radio 4 Announcer * James Russell as Additional Voice * David Dundas as Additional Voice * Matt Irving as Additional Voice Reception When the Wind Blows received positive reviews, currently having an 83% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 6 reviews. Critic Barry Lappin called it \\"Absolutely brilliant.... It was very subtly done but the message more than gets through well\\". He explained that the scenes are \\"more than touching\\" and encouraged people to watch it to the very end. Colin Greenland reviewed When the Wind Blows for White Dwarf #85, and stated that \\"The story of Jim and Hilda Bloggs preparing for the Bomb and trying to get back to normal afterwards is heavy-handed, especially at the end, and would have been better shorter; there are odd continuity problems between the pictures and the dialogue. But it is powerful, ludicrous and shocking. It gets to you. As it ought to.\\" Soundtrack Originally, David Bowie was slated to contribute several songs to the soundtrack for the film, but decided to pull out so he could focus on his upcoming album Never Let Me Down, and instead only submitted the title track. Roger Waters was brought in to complete the project instead. =Track listing= All tracks written by Roger Waters and performed by Waters and The Bleeding Heart Band except where noted.

Freedom of speech and the press are not guaranteed by law. Many colonial-era laws regulating the press and information continue to be used. Until August 2012 every publication (including newspaper articles, cartoons, advertisements, and illustrations) required pre-approval by the Press Scrutiny and Registration Division (PSRB) of the Ministry of Information. However, the 2011–2012 Burmese political reforms signalled significant relaxations of the country's censorship policies and in August 2012 the Ministry of Information lifted the requirement that print media organisations submit materials to the government prior to publication. Burma ranked 151st of 179 nations in the 2012–2013 worldwide Press Freedom Index from Reporters Without Borders.\\"Press Freedom Index 2013\\" , Reporters Without Borders  History  = Konbaung dynasty = During the reign of King Mindon Min of Burma's last dynasty, the Konbaung dynasty, the country had one of the freest presses in Asia. The Seventeen Articles, passed in 1873 safeguarded freedom of the press. = Colonial era = In 1878, after Lower Burma was annexed by the United Kingdom, the Vernacular Press Act was passed, which attempted to repress propaganda against the British government in local language newspapers. In 1898, the Criminal Procedure Code allowed the government to convict people for treason and sedition on grounds of disseminating false information against the state. Soon after, in 1908, the Unlawful Associations Act, was enacted to further stifle freedom of expression. The Official Secrets Act was passed in 1923, which makes it unlawful for any person to possess classified information from the state. A decade later, the Burma Wireless Telegraphy Act was passed, criminalising possession of telegraphs without government permission. However, there were numerous publications in circulation during the colonial era, with a steady increase. In 1911, there were 44 periodicals and newspapers in circulation, and 103 in 1921. By the end of the 1930s, there were over 200 newspapers and periodicals in circulation, double the amount in 1921. = Post-independence era = Burma gained independence in 1948. The Constitution of the Union of Burma (1947) guaranteed freedom of expression, guaranteeing the \\"liberties of thought and expression\\". Two years later, the Emergency Provisions Act, which criminalised the spreading of false news knowingly and the slandering of civil servants and military officials was enacted. Despite the law, in the 1950s, Burma had one of the freest presses in Asia, with 30 daily newspapers (in Burmese, Chinese, English, and Indian languages). After the military coup d'état by Ne Win in 1962, the Printers and Publishers Registration Law was enacted. This law, still in function, requires all printers and publishers to register and submit copies of their publications to the Press Scrutiny Board, under the Ministry of Home and Religious Affairs (now under the Ministry of Information). In 1975, the Constitution of the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma (1975), Article 157, ensured \\"freedom of speech, expression and publication to the extent that the enjoyment of such freedom is not contrary to the interests of the working people and of socialism.\\" The Memorandum to all Printers and Publishers Concerning the Submission of Manuscripts for Scrutiny was issued by the Printers and Publishers Central Registration Board. It gave explicit guidelines on materials that would be censored, including those whose contents were injurious to the Burmese socialist program, the state ideology, the socialist economy, national unity, security, peace and public order, pornographic in nature, libelous, slanderous, or critical of the national government. That same year, the State Protection Law was issued, allowing authorities to imprison any persons who have been suspected of being a threat to national peace. This law has been the basis for the arrests of many journalists and writers. = 1988 coup d'état = After a military coup d'état, led by the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), in 1988, martial law orders were quickly issued, banning public gatherings, banning activities, publications, and speeches aimed at dividing the Armed Forces, and criminalising the publication of documents without registration with the state. Martial law orders have since been repealed. = Military rule = In 1996, several laws were passed to control further dissemination of information in Burma. These include the Law Protecting the Peaceful and Systematic Transfer of State Responsibility and the Successful Performance of the Functions of the National Convention against Disturbances and Oppositions, which prohibits activities aimed at destroying peace, stability, law and order. In addition, it illegalised acts of demeaning the National Convention. Media laws including the Television and Video Act, which requires owners of media players (including televisions, satellites, and videocassette recorders) to obtain licenses from the Ministry of Communications, Posts, and Telegraphs and instituted Video Censorship Boards on domestic-produced videos, and the Motion Picture Law, which requires licenses issued by the Myanmar Motion Picture Enterprise in making films were passed. Films are subject to censorship by the Motion Picture Censor Board. In addition, The Computer Science Development Law was passed. Under this law, all computer equipment must be approved by the Ministry of Communications, Posts, and Telegraphs. In addition, the distribution, transfer, or acquisition of information that undermines state security, national solidarity and culture, is a criminal offence. SLORC, in 1997, renamed itself the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC). In 2000, the Internet Law, which prohibits posting of writings that are harmful to state interests, was issued by SPDC. Foreign news has also been censored by the government. British Broadcasting Corporation and Voice of America radio broadcasts were jammed, beginning in 1995. Foreign reporters are discouraged from reporting from Myanmar, and are regularly denied entry. The period saw a number of high-profile journalist arrests, such as Aung Pwint, who was jailed in 1999 for fax-machine ownership and \\"sending news\\" to banned papers. In 2008, Myanmar Nation editor Thet Zin was arrested for having a copy of a UN human rights report. In July 2014 five journalists were jailed for ten years after publishing a report accusing the government of planning to build a new chemical weapons plant. Journalists described the jailings as a blow to recently-won news media freedoms that had followed five decades of censorship and persecution. Internet Internet censorship in Burma is classified as selective in the political and Internet tools areas, as substantial in social, and as no evidence of filtering in conflict/security by the OpenNet Initiative in August 2012.OpenNet Initiative \\"Summarized global Internet filtering data spreadsheet\\", 29 October 2012 and \\"Country Profiles\\", the OpenNet Initiative is a collaborative partnership of the Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto; the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University; and the SecDev Group, Ottawa\\"Update on information controls in Burma\\", Irene Poetranto, OpenNet Initiative, 23 October 2012 Burma is listed as an Internet enemy by Reporters Without Borders in 2011.Internet Enemies , Reporters Without Borders, Paris, March 2011 According to a study conducted by OpenNet Initiative (ONI) in 2005, Internet censorship was mostly confined to websites related to pro-democracy groups and those on pornography. In addition, 85% of e-mail service provider sites were blocked. The Myanmar Information Communications Technology Development Corporation (MICTDC) licenses cybercafés. Users are required to register, and owners are required to save screen shots of user activity every five minutes, and upon request, deliver them to MICTDC for surveillance. However, cybercafé regulation is loose. ONI conducted testing in Burma during August 2012. The results of these tests showed that both the scope and depth of content found to be filtered were drastically reduced compared to all previous rounds of ONI testing dating back to 2005. Restrictions on content deemed harmful to state security, however, remained in place. Pornography is still widely blocked, as is content relating to alcohol and drugs, gambling websites, online dating sites, sex education, gay and lesbian content, and web censorship circumvention tools. In 2012 almost all of the previously blocked websites of opposition political parties, critical political content, and independent news sites were accessible, with only 5 of 541 tested URLs categorised as political content blocked. =Political reform= In November 2010, shortly after Aung San Suu Kyi's release from house arrest, 10 local publications were suspended for placing \\"too much importance\\" on her release in their articles. Since 10 June 2011, PSRB has allowed publications to self-censor publications dealing with entertainment, sports, technology, health and children's issues, allowing editors to circumvent the mandated practice of submitting report drafts to the PSRB prior to publication. This relaxation has occurred in a series of trials over a span of time. In July 2011, Group 1 publications, consisting of 178 journals and magazines, were no longer censored. In the new system, the first strike requires the publication to pay a K5,000,000 (about US$5,000) deposit. The second strike results in a fine that is withdrawn from that deposit. The depleted amount must be topped up by the publisher or the publication is banned. In December 2011, an additional 54 publications in the business and crime genres, were allowed to self-censor their work. Tint Swe, director of the Press Scrutiny and Registration Division, has publicly called for the abolition of media censorship in the country, stating that it is not in line with democratic practices. Tint Swe has also indicated that censorship for videos and films would be relaxed, without specifying a time frame. In September 2011, several banned websites including YouTube, Democratic Voice of Burma and Voice of America have been unblocked. Foreign journalists, including those from the British Broadcasting Corporation and the Voice of America, were issued visas to the country the following month. A presidential adviser indicated that press censorship would be abolished in 2012 under new media legislation. In January 2012, the Ministry of Information announced that it had forwarded a draft of a new media and press law to the Attorney General's Office for review. The draft law, which will need to be approved by the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (National Parliament), borrows some language from similar laws in Cambodia, Indonesia and Vietnam. The draft law, which is adapted from the 1962 Printers and Publishers Registration Law, will not be submitted during the second parliamentary session. In August 2012, the Ministry of Information lifted the requirement that print media organisations submit materials to the government before publication; films remained subject to prior censorship. The head of the PSRB, Tint Swe, told the Agence France- Presse that \\"censorship began on 6 August 1964 and ended 48 years and two weeks later\\". The Associated Press described the statement as \\"the most dramatic move yet toward allowing freedom of expression in the long-repressed nation\\". However, the ban on private ownership of daily newspapers remained, as did a law forbidding the publication of \\"information relating to secrets of the security of the state\\". Journalism organisations expressed cautious optimism at the change, but predicted that \\"a pervasive culture of self- censorship\\" would remain, as journalists feared long prison sentences associated with libel and state security charges. As publication legislation slowly ameliorates in Burma in the wake of last August's ban of pre- publication censorship, editorial independence is still hampered by a new requirement for publications to send in published works for post-publication analysis. The PSRB remains a threat to the nation's freedom of press, wielding the same power to audit and sanction publications deemed inflammatory to the Burmese government as it has for the previous five decades. Journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo of Reuters, were charged and jailed on December 12, 2017 by authorities near Rangoon for concealing 'secret papers' which violated a colonial era law.Eltagouri, Marwa. (13 December 2017). \\"Two journalists covering Rohingya crisis in Burma arrested for possessing ‘secret papers’\\". Washington Post website Retrieved 13 December 2017. The two Reuters journalists had been covering the predominantly Muslim Rohingyas' exodus from the country due to persecution. On September 3, 2018, the journalists were both sentenced to seven years in prison sparking outrage among the international community.

In 1995, the population was around 179,900. Its geographic coordinates are 7° 35' 60 N and 5° 5' 60 E. Locality Ilawe Ekiti is divided into 8 different Quarters: Okebedo, Okeemo, Adin, Aaye, Okepa, Okeloye, Iro, and Irorin.  Ruling Monarch  The current King of Ilawe is His Royal Majesty Oba Adebanji Ajibade Alabi (Afuntande 1). He ascended to the throne on 21 April 2012, taking over from Oba Joseph Ademileka.  Emergence of Christianity in Ilawe As far back as 1890, Missionaries has been founding their way into Yoruba Land which was the Western Part then. Back then, Ilawe people believed strongly in their traditional gods of the Yoruba religion. Sacrifices and obeisance were made to Ikereje, Ogun, Orunmila, Orinlase & other deities. The First contact with Christian Missionaries in Ilawe came through one Mr. Samuel Dada and Mr. Ajila both from the Okebedo Quarter in early 1903. Dada and Ajila, an Ilawean per excellence, came in contact with one Mr. Asefon who was then a Christian. Both Ilawe men was said to have been fascinated by Asefon's translation of some portions of the bible and they (Dada and Ajila) made a decision to learn how to write and how to read the bible. (Remember, there was no school in Ilawe as at this time.) A Catechist of Church Missionary Society (CMS) at Ado Ekiti then (Rev. Sowumi) got wind of the interest of some people in Ilawe to know about Christianity, he then immediately sent another missionary to go and teach Auru & Ajila the scripture. Soon, there were more adherents, some of the pioneer adherents of the Church Missionary Society (Now Known as Anglican Communion) were from various quarters of the town. From Oke Emo were Ajakaye, Oguntoye and John Afolalu; from Adin were Emmanuel Adegbolata; Afelumo came from Aaye and Apata came from Iro. Samuel Dada and Kolapo came from Okebedo Quarter. First CAC church in Ilawe Ekiti, Ekiti state The then Alawe, Oba Afinbiokin Ademileka granted and leased out a parcel of land in Okeloye Quarter to the Church Missionary Society (CMS) to build a church which is the present location of Holy Trinity Anglican Church. For twelve years, the CMS (Anglican Communion) was the only Christian Church in Ilawe. By 1913, the church had been well established and between 1913 and 1915, a Catechist (Rev. Aladekomo) was resident in Ilawe while Dada become the First Lay Leader (Baba Ẹgbẹ) of the Church and remained so between 1915 and 1953. Dada, who influenced Christianity to Ilawe, was later very influential with the Colonial Missionaries & Administrator. He ensured that Christianity became a free and legal religion in Ilawe in 1904. He was very popular with the White Missionaries who controlled the CMS in Ekiti. In fact, he later became the Lay President of the whole Ekiti State. Years Later, the Catholic Church also found its way to Ilawe Ekiti championed by Jacob Bello. Christ Apostolic Church followed suit, championed by Joseph Ojo Ajofoyinbo. With time and coupled with acceptance of Christianity in Ilawe, many other Pentecostal Churches started coming to Ilawe and they were all accepted and embraced joyfully. The Advent of Christianity in Ilawe bring many social amenities to the town. Education Ilawe-Ekiti is the location of Corpus Christi College secondary school. Along with 100 other secondary schools in Ekiti State, the college was scheduled for renovation in 2012.

History On June 28, 1935, the station first signed on at 1380 kilocycles as WMFE in New Britain, Connecticut, about 10 miles southwest of Hartford.Broadcasting Yearbook 1938 page 62 The station, owned by the State Broadcasting Company, began as a daytimer powered at only 250 watts, although its power increased to 1,000 watts, operating full-time, several years later. The station was an affiliate of the NBC Blue Network and changed its call sign to WNBC in 1936. (The station that would become better known as WNBC 660 AM in New York City carried the call letters WEAF at this time.) In 1941, with the enactment of North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA), the station switched to its present frequency of AM 1410. Power was boosted to the current 5,000 watts, and it moved its city of license to Hartford.Broadcasting Yearbook 1949 page 94 It changed its call letters to WHTD to reflect its move to HarTforD, and became affiliated with the Mutual Broadcasting System. In 1956, as network programming moved from radio to television, WHTD switched to a middle of the road format. It changed its call sign to WPOP, signifying that it played POPular music. WPOP was a highly rated Top 40 radio station during the 1960s and early 1970s. The station achieved its highest level of success during this era, as it vied with rival 1360 WDRC for youthful listeners in the Hartford radio market. WPOP was acquired by entertainer and TV talk show host Merv Griffin in 1973, who also owned 104.1 WIOF (now WMRQ). In June 1975, WPOP dropped its hit music format, switching to All-News, carrying NBC's News and Information Service, with a sizable local news staff covering Connecticut news stories. When the NIS network ended two years later, WPOP continued the All-News format using its own anchors supplemented by CBS Radio News and the Associated Press radio service.Broadcasting Yearbook 1979 page C-37 By the late 1980s, talk shows were added and the station cut back on its news segments. Affiliation switched from CBS Radio to ABC Radio's Information Network. In 1994, Merv Griffin sold the station to SFX Broadcasting, Inc., which also owned FM 105.9 WHCN. WPOP's last logo as \\"ESPN Radio 1410\\" On January 13, 1997, SFX Broadcasting switched WPOP's format to all-sports; most of its programming was provided by One-on- One Sports (now SB Nation Radio), but it also carried The Fabulous Sports Babe and weekend programming from the ESPN Radio Network, based in nearby Bristol, Connecticut. The station ended its One-on-One Sports affiliation on February 28, 1999, becoming a full-time ESPN Radio affiliate. In 2000, WPOP and WHCN were bought by Clear Channel Communications, the previous name of iHeartMedia, Inc. On January 27, 2012, WPOP's sports format began simulcasting on co-owned FM 97.9 WPKX, previously a country music outlet. The FM station eventually changed its call letters to WUCS, with the CS standing for Connecticut Sports. WPOP switched from ESPN Radio to Fox Sports Radio on March 5, 2012, with ESPN Radio remaining on WUCS. On August 17, 2015, WPOP changed its format from all sports to a mix of talk and sports, branded as \\"News Radio 1410\\".WPOP Hartford Makes Long Awaited Talk Flip In 2019, it added an FM translator, W265EB at 100.9 MHz, so listeners in Hartford and its adjacent suburbs could hear the station on FM as well as AM radio.

War and after During the First World War, he served in the Royal Naval Division, the Royal Naval Air Service, and then in the Royal Air Force. After the war, Metcalfe taught for five years at Highgate Junior School in London and began writing. His first book, The Smoking Leg and Other Stories, published in 1925, contains several noted stories, including the title story, \\"The Bad Lands\\", \\"Nightmare Jack\\" and \\"The Double Admiral\\". After its publication, he abandoned teaching for writing full-time. Emigration Metcalfe emigrated to the United States in 1928, where he wrote Arm's Length while serving as a barge captain on the East River. On 17 March 1930, Metcalfe married the American novelist Evelyn Scott. Metcalfe's second collection, Judas and Other Stories features several horror stories. They include \\"Mortmain\\", about a man who believes he is being haunted by the ghost of his wife's first husband. After service in World War II in the British Royal Air Force, Metcalfe taught in schools in Dorset and Hampstead before returning to the United States, where he was a teacher in Connecticut and New York. In the 1950s, Metcalfe discussed with August Derleth the possibility of having a third collection of his fiction published by Arkham House. This collection (to be entitled The Feasting Dead and other Stories) never appeared, but Arkham House did publish The Feasting Dead as a chapbook.

He has been described as one of the greatest Ukrainian boxers.  Early life Kaplan and his family emigrated to the United States from the Kiev when he was five years old and settled in Meriden, Connecticut. While selling fruit for five cents a day, he began boxing as a teenager at the Lenox Athletic Club in Meriden, and turned professional in 1919.  Professional career  Kaplan began his boxing career in the Connecticut State circuit. At the time, Meriden was an epicenter of boxing in the Northeastern United States. Early in his career, Kaplan fought the popular local favorite and former New York State champion Charlie Pilkington. Though they never boxed a professional match together, their early rivalry and Pilkington's role as a mentor and sparring partner had much to do with launching Kaplan's very successful boxing career. A busy fighter, he engaged in over 50 bouts in his first four years in the paid ranks. During one of his early fights in 1920, Kaplan knocked out opponent Sailor Cunningham within two minutes. After winning against Hughie Hutchinson and Earl Baird in 1922, Kaplan gained significant popularity. In 1923 he twice drew with rival Babe Herman before scoring a 10-round win over future world lightweight champ Jimmy Goodrich. = World featherweight champion, 1925 = By late 1924, World Featherweight champion Johnny Dundee vacated his title and a tournament was arranged to determine a successor. \\"Kid\\" kayoed Angel Diaz in three rounds, outpointed Bobby Garcia over 10-rounds, and then halted Joe Lombardo in four rounds to advance to the finals. On January 2, 1925 he knocked out Danny Kramer in nine rounds at Madison Square Garden to become the new champion. His first two defenses were against the familiar Babe Herman (D15 and W15) in late 1925. Kaplan next decisioned Hall of Famer Billy Petrolle over 12 rounds in a non-title bout. However, Kaplan's reign as champion was nearing its end. Despite standing 5 ft 4 in., he was experiencing difficulty making the featherweight limit and decided to relinquish the crown to campaign as a lightweight in 1927. As a 135-pounder, he scored wins over Jackie Fields, Johnny Jadick, Billy Wallace, Battling Battalino and Sammy Mandell among others. Amongst the wins were losses to Wallace and Hall of Famer Jimmy McLarnin. In 1933 he lost to Herbert \\"Cocoa Kid\\" Lewis Hardwick, and promptly retired from the ring with a 108-17-13D- 12 ND (26KOs) record.

The EU Treaty of Lisbon of 2007 legally includes solidarity in matters of energy supply and changes to the energy policy within the EU. Prior to the Treaty of Lisbon, EU energy legislation has been based on the EU authority in the area of the common market and environment. However, in practice many policy competencies in relation to energy remain at national member state level, and progress in policy at European level requires voluntary cooperation by members states. In 2007, the EU was importing 82% of its oil and 57% of its gas, which then made it the world's leading importer of these fuels. Only 3% of the uranium used in European nuclear reactors was mined in Europe. Russia, Canada, Australia, Niger and Kazakhstan were the five largest suppliers of nuclear materials to the EU, supplying more than 75% of the total needs in 2009. In 2015, the EU imports 53% of the energy it consumes. In January 2014, the EU agreed to a 40% emissions reduction by 2030, compared to 1990 levels, and a 27% renewable energy target, which is expected to provide 70,000 full-time jobs and cut €33bn in fossil fuel imports.Limiting climate change could have huge economic benefits, study finds Stopping global warming at two degrees would create nearly half a million jobs in Europe and save over a million lives in China, analysis of emissions pledges says, Guardian 31.3.2015 The target is ambitious compared to other advanced economies but insufficient to limit warming to well below 2 °C, let alone 1.5 °C, and align with the Paris Agreement. In 2015, the Framework Strategy for Energy Union is launched as one of the European Commission's 10 Priorities. Energy Union The Energy Union Strategy is a project of the European Commission to coordinate the transformation of European energy supply. It was launched in February 2015, with the aim of providing secure, sustainable, competitive, affordable energy.http://eur- lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:e27fdb4d-bdce-11e4-bbe1-01aa75ed71a1.0003.03/DOC_1&format;=PDF Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, introduced the idea of an energy union when he was Prime Minister of Poland. Eurocommissioner Vice President Maroš Šefčovič called the Energy Union the biggest energy project since the European Coal and Steel Community. The EU's reliance on Russia for its energy, and the annexation of Crimea by Russia have been cited as strong reasons for the importance of this policy. The European Council concluded on 19March 2015 that the EU is committed to building an Energy Union with a forward-looking climate policy on the basis of the Commission's framework strategy, with five priority dimensions: * Energy security, solidarity and trust * A fully integrated European energy market * Energy efficiency contributing to moderation of demand * Decarbonising the economy * Research, innovation and competitiveness. The strategy includes a minimum 10% electricity interconnection target for all member states by 2020, which the Commission hopes will put downward pressure onto energy prices, reduce the need to build new power plants, reduce the risk of black-outs or other forms of electrical grid instability, improve the reliability of renewable energy supply, and encourage market integration.http://eur- lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:a5bfdc21-bdd7-11e4-bbe1-01aa75ed71a1.0003.01/DOC_1&format;=PDF EU Member States agreed 25 January 2018 on the Commission's proposal to invest €873 million in clean energy infrastructure.

As a result of the decision to develop a common energy policy, the first proposals, Energy for a Changing World were published by the European Commission, following a consultation process, on 10 January 2007. It is claimed that they will lead to a 'post-industrial revolution', or a low-carbon economy, in the European Union, as well as increased competition in the energy markets, improved security of supply, and improved employment prospects. The Commission's proposals have been approved at a meeting of the European Council on 8 and 9 March 2007. Key proposals include: * A cut of at least 20% in greenhouse gas emissions from all primary energy sources by 2020 (compared to 1990 levels), while pushing for an international agreement to succeed the Kyoto Protocol aimed at achieving a 30% cut by all developed nations by 2020. * A cut of up to 95% in carbon emissions from primary energy sources by 2050, compared to 1990 levels. * A minimum target of 10% for the use of biofuels by 2020. * That the energy supply and generation activities of energy companies should be 'unbundled' from their distribution networks to further increase market competition. * Improving energy relations with the EU's neighbours, including Russia. * The development of a European Strategic Energy Technology Plan to develop technologies in areas including renewable energy, energy conservation, low-energy buildings, fourth generation nuclear reactor, coal pollution mitigation, and carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). * Developing an Africa-Europe Energy partnership, to help Africa 'leap-frog' to low-carbon technologies and to help develop the continent as a sustainable energy supplier. Many underlying proposals are designed to limit global temperature changes to no more than 2 °C above pre-industrial levels,New EU energy plan – more security, less pollution, press release by European Commission of which 0.8 °C has already taken place and another 0.5–0.7 °C is already committed.Oliver Geden (2010), What Comes After the Two-Degree Target?, SWP Comments 19 2 °C is usually seen as the upper temperature limit to avoid 'dangerous global warming'. Due to only minor efforts in global Climate change mitigation it is highly likely that the world will not be able to reach this particular target. The EU might then not only be forced to accept a less ambitious global target. Because the planned emissions reductions in the European energy sector (95% by 2050) are derived directly from the 2 °C target since 2007, the EU will have to revise its energy policy paradigm.Oliver Geden (2012), The End of Climate Policy as We Knew it, SWP Research Paper 2012/RP01Oliver Geden (2012), Impending Paradigm Shift.

A large part of FP7 energy funding is also devoted to fusion research, a technology that will not be able to help meet European climate and energy objectives until beyond 2050. The European Commission tried to redress this shortfall with the SET plan. The Steering Group on the implementation of the Strategic Energy Technologies Plan (SET Plan) on 26 June 2008 will set the agenda for an EU energy technology policy. It will enhance the coordination of national and European research and innovation efforts to position the EU in the forefront of the low-carbon technologies markets.A European strategic energy technology plan (SET-plan) – 'Towards a low carbon future', Communication from the Commission COM(2007) 723 final The SET plan initiatives: ; European Wind Initiative: focus on large turbines and large systems' validation and demonstration (relevant to on and off-shore applications).

Although there is significant variation in national targets, the average is that 22% of electricity should be generated by renewables by 2010 (compared to 13,9% in 1997). The European Commission has proposed in its Renewable Energy Roadmap21 a binding target of increasing the level of renewable energy in the EU's overall mix from less than 7% today to 20% by 2020. Europe spent €406 billion in 2011 and €545 billion in 2012 on importing fossil fuels. This is around three times more than the cost of the Greek bailout up to 2013. In 2012, wind energy avoided €9.6 billion of fossil fuel costs. EWEA recommends binding renewable energy target to support in replacing fossil fuels with wind energy in Europe by providing a stable regulatory framework. In addition, it recommends setting a minimum emission performance standard for all new-build power installations. Avoiding fossil fuel costs with wind energy EWEA March 2014 =Energy markets= The EU promotes electricity market liberalisation and security of supply through Directive 2009/72/EC. The 2004 Gas Security Directive has been intended to improve security of supply in the natural gas sector. = Energy efficiency = = Energy taxation = = IPEEC = At the Heiligendamm Summit in June 2007, the G8 acknowledged an EU proposal for an international initiative on energy efficiency tabled in March 2007, and agreed to explore, together with the International Energy Agency, the most effective means to promote energy efficiency internationally. A year later, on 8 June 2008, the G8 countries, China, India, South Korea and the European Community decided to establish the International Partnership for Energy Efficiency Cooperation, at the Energy Ministerial meeting hosted by Japan in the frame of the 2008 G8 Presidency, in Aomori. =Buildings= Buildings account for around 40% of EU energy requirements and have been the focus of several initiatives.Energy Efficiency in Buildings, European Commission, Directorate-General for Energy and Transport From 4 January 2006, the 2002 Directive on the energy performance of buildings requires member states to ensure that new buildings, as well as large existing buildings undergoing refurbishment, meet certain minimum energy requirements. It also requires that all buildings should undergo 'energy certification' prior to sale, and that boilers and air conditioning equipment should be regularly inspected. As part of the EU's SAVE Programme,For an Energy-Efficient Millennium: SAVE 2000, Directorate-General for Energy aimed at promoting energy efficiency and encouraging energy-saving behaviour, the Boiler Efficiency Directive specifies minimum levels of efficiency for boilers fired with liquid or gaseous fuels. Originally, from June 2007, all homes (and other buildings) in the UK would have to undergo Energy Performance Certification before they are sold or let, to meet the requirements of the European Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (Directive 2002/91/EC).European Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (Directive 2002/91/EC), Official Journal of the European Communities, published 02-12-16. Retrieved 2008-06-02. =Transport= Carbon dioxide emissions from transport have risen rapidly in recent years, from 21% of the total in 1990 to 28% in 2004. EU policies include the voluntary ACEA agreement, signed in 1998, to cut carbon dioxide emissions for new cars sold in Europe to an average of 140 grams of /km by 2008, a 25% cut from the 1995 level. Because the target was unlikely to be met, the European Commission published new proposals in February 2007, requiring a mandatory limit of 130 grams of /km for new cars by 2012, with 'complementary measures' being proposed to achieve the target of 120 grams of /km that had originally been expected. In the area of fuels, the 2001 Biofuels Directive requires that 5,75% of all transport fossil fuels (petrol and diesel) should be replaced by biofuels by 31 December 2010, with an intermediate target of 2% by the end of 2005. In February 2007 the European Commission proposed that, from 2011, suppliers will have to reduce carbon emissions per unit of energy by 1% a year from 2010 levels, to result in a cut of 10% by 2020 Stricter fuel standards to combat climate change and reduce air pollution.  Flights Airlines can be charged for their greenhouse gas emissions on flights to and from Europe according to a court ruling in October 2011. Historically, EU aviation fuel was tax free and applied no VAT. Fuel taxation in the EU has been permitted since 2003 under the Energy Taxation Directive for domestic flights and on intra-EU flights on the basis of bilateral agreements. In 2018 Germany applied 19 % VAT on domestic airline tickets. Many other member states had 0% VAT. Unlike air travel VAT is applied to bus and rail, which creates competitive distortions, artificially stimulate demand, drive uncontrolled growth in aviation emissions and constitute unjustifiable subsidies. Air fuel tax 33 cents/litre equal to road traffic would give €9.5 billion. Applying a 15 % VAT in all air traffics within and from Europe would be equal to €15 billion.Taxing aviation fuels in the EU Jasper Faber and Aoife O’Leary Delft November 2018 =Industry= The European Union Emission Trading Scheme, introduced in 2005 under the 2003 Emission Trading Directive, sets member state-level caps on greenhouse gas emissions for power plants and other large point sources. =Consumer goods= A further area of energy policy has been in the area of consumer goods, where energy labels were introduced to encourage consumers to purchase more energy-efficient appliances. =External energy relations= Many EU members import oil and gas from Russia. Beyond the bounds of the European Union, EU energy policy has included negotiating and developing wider international agreements, such as the Energy Charter Treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, the post-Kyoto regime and a framework agreement on energy efficiency; extension of the EC energy regulatory framework or principles to neighbours (Energy Community, Baku Initiative, Euro-Med energy cooperation) and the emission trading scheme to global partners; the promotion of research and the use of renewable energy.External energy relations – from principles to action. Communication from the Commission to the European Council COM(2006) 590 final The EU-Russia energy cooperation will be based on a new comprehensive framework agreement within the post-Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA), which will be negotiated in 2007. The energy cooperation with other third energy producer and transit countries is facilitated with different tools, such as the PCAs, the existing and foreseen Memorandums of Understanding on Energy Cooperation (with Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Algeria), the Association Agreements with Mediterranean countries, the European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plans; Euromed energy cooperation; the Baku initiative; and the EU-Norway energy dialogue. For the cooperation with African countries, a comprehensive Africa-Europe Energy partnership would be launched at the highest level, with the integration of Europe's Energy and Development Policies. For ensuring efficient follow-up and coherence in pursuing the initiatives and processes, for sharing information in case of an external energy crisis, and for assisting the EU's early response and reactions in case of energy security threats, the network of energy correspondents in the Member States was established in early 2007. After the Russian-Ukrainian Gas Crisis of 2009 the EU decided that the existing external measures regarding gas supply security should be supplemented by internal provisions for emergency prevention and response, such as enhancing gas storage and network capacity or the development of the technical prerequisites for reverse flow in transit pipelines.Effective Provisions for Emergency Prevention and Response in the Gas Sector. German Institute for International and Security Affairs, Comment 21/2009Oliver Geden/Jonas Graetz: The EU’s Policy to Secure Gas Supplies. Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich, CSS Analyses 159 (2014) = Just Transition Fund = Just Transition Fund was created in 2020 to boost investments in low-carbon energy. The fund was criticized for blanket ban on low-carbon nuclear power but also introduction of a loophole for fossil gas.  Policies under development  Documents leaked in late-2016 reveal that a confidential European Union impact assessment analyses four scenarios for paring back the 'priority dispatch' system afforded to renewable generation in many countries. Priority dispatch is mandated under the Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC which expires in 2020. The assessment concludes that removing priority dispatch could increase carbon emissions by 45million to 60million tonnes per annum or up to 10%, with the aim of making European energy generators more flexible and cost- competitive.  Solar anti-dumping levies  In 2013, a two-year investigation by the European Commission concluded that Chinese solar panel exporters were selling their products in the EU up to 88% below market prices, backed by state subsidies. In response, the European Council imposed tariffs on solar imported from China at an average rate of 47.6% beginning 6 June that year. The Commission reviewed these measures in December 2016 and proposed to extend them for two years until March 2019. However, in January 2017, 18 out of 28 EU member states voted in favour of shortening the extension period. In February 2017, the Commission announced its intention to extend its anti-dumping measures for a reduced period of 18 months. Research and development The European Union is active in the areas of energy research, development and promotion, via initiatives such as CEPHEUS (ultra-low energy housing), and programs under the umbrella titles of SAVE (energy saving) ALTENER (new and renewable energy sources), STEER (transport) and COOPENER (developing countries).Projects, European Commission, Directorate-General for Energy and Transport Through Fusion for Energy, the EU is participating in the ITER project. Public opinion nuclear waste disposal centre at Gorleben in northern Germany In a poll carried out for the European Commission in October and November 2005, 47% of the citizens questioned in the 27 countries of the EU (including the 2 states that joined in 2007) were in favour of taking decisions on key energy policy issues at a European level. 37% favoured national decisions and 8% that they be tackled locally.Special Eurobarometer 247. Attitudes towards Energy, January 2006 A similar survey of 29,220 people in March and May 2006 indicated that the balance had changed in favour of national decisions in these areas (42% in favour), with 39% backing EU policy making and 12% preferring local decisions. There was significant national variation with this, with 55% in favour of European level decision making in the Netherlands, but only 15% in Finland.Special Eurobarometer 258. Energy Issues, November 2006 A comprehensive public opinion survey was performed in May and June 2006.Special Eurobarometer 262: Energy Technologies: Knowledge, Perception, Measures, January 2007 The authors propose following conclusions: * Energy issues are considered to be important but not at first glance. * EU citizens perceive great future promise in the use of renewable energies. Despite majority opposition, nuclear energy also has its place in the future energy mix. * Citizens appear to opt for changing the energy structure, enhancing research and development and guaranteeing the stability of the energy field rather than saving energy as the way to meet energy challenges. * The possible future consequences of energy issues do not generate deep fears in Europeans’ minds. * Europeans appear to be fairly familiar with energy issues, although their knowledge seems somewhat vague. * Energy issues touch everybody and it is therefore hard to distinguish clear groups with differing perceptions. Nevertheless, rough distinction between groups of citizens is sketched.

While officially the war lasted from 1839 until 1851, it was a part of armed conflicts that started in 1832 and continued until the final military defeat of the Blancos faction in 1904. Out of supporters of presidents Rivera and Oribe grew the Colorado Party and the National Party, both of which received backing and support from foreign sources, including neighboring Empire of Brazil, the Argentine Confederation, Buenos Aires Province as well as European powers, primarily the British Empire and the Kingdom of France, but also a legion of Italian volunteers including Giuseppe Garibaldi. The great diversity of nationalities among the military forces supporting the Colorado Party posed a difficulty when coming to express their struggle in terms of a \\"national liberation\\", instead the National Party side put forward a rhethoric on them defending \\"humanity\\" and \\"civilization\\" against \\"tyranny\\". As the population of Uruguay at that time was about 60,000 out of which 15,000 lived in Montevideo, the various \\"armies\\" rarely rose to more than a couple of thousand soldiers and horsemen.Latin America’s Wars Rivera vs. Lavalleja The first Uruguayan president Fructuoso Rivera. Independence leader Juan Antonio Lavalleja After the proclamation of Uruguayan Independence in 1828 a conflict for primacy arose between the leader of the Thirty-Three Orientals Juan Lavalleja and veteran military commander Fructuoso Rivera, who on November 6, 1830 was chosen as the first President of Uruguay. In June 1832 Lavalleja's supporters attempted to kill Rivera and on July 3 the Montevideo garrison revolted, calling for Lavalleja to be made Commander-in- Chief. Rivera, with the help of Argentine Unitarians defeated Lavalleja on September 18, 1832 at Tupambaé, forcing Lavalleja to flee to the Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul. There Lavalleja organized a new force with the support of Buenos Aires strongman Juan Manuel de Rosas and in March 1834 invaded Uruguay, only to be defeated by Rivera once again. Rivera vs. Oribe Uruguayan president Manuel Oribe. On March 1, 1835 Manuel Oribe, another of the Thirty-Three Orientals, was elected as the second President of Uruguay while Rivera remained as the commander of Army. Oribe pursued his own policies and in January 1836 removed Rivera from the command and gave amnesty to his old comrade Lavalleja. =Blancos vs. Colorados= Historic armbands of the Whites and Colorados On July 16, 1836 Rivera rebelled against Oribe. To distinguish his soldiers, Oribe ordered them to wear a white armband. Rivera then ordered his supporters to wear blue, but as it quickly faded, they started using red armbands. Out of these military distinction marks quickly emerged the conservative Blancos (\\"Whites\\") and the liberal Colorados (\\"Reds\\"). The Colorados were led by Fructuoso Rivera and represented the business interests of Montevideo; the Blancos were headed by Manuel Oribe, who looked after the agricultural interests of the countryside and promoted protectionism. =Defeat of Oribe= In order to support Oribe, Lavalleja organized an army in Argentina and moved against Rivera, who was helped by Argentine Unitarians led by General Juan Lavalle. On September 19, 1836 Rivera was defeated at the Battle of Carpintería and fled to Brazil, where his troops joined the newly proclaimed Riograndense Republic. With the help of this republic Rivera invaded Uruguay in 1837 and on October 22 defeated Oribe's forces at the Battle of Yucutujá and completely crushed Oribe on June 15, 1838 Battle of Palmar. In 1838 France had started a naval blockade of Buenos Aires port in support of their allies the Peru–Bolivian Confederation who were involved in the War of the Confederation with the Argentine Confederation and Chile. Unable to deploy land troops, France looked for allied forces to fight Buenos Aires strongman Juan Manuel de Rosas on their behalf. For this purpose they supported Fructuoso Rivera and helped him to defeat Oribe, who was on good terms with Rosas.Garibaldi in Uruguay: A Reputation Reconsidered. On October 24, 1838 Oribe resigned and fled to Buenos Aires, and Rivera assumed power. Return of Oribe Rosas did not recognize Rivera as a legitimate President, and sought to restore Oribe to power. Rivera and Juan Lavalle prepared troops to attack Buenos Aires. At this point, both the British and French troops intervened, transforming the conflict into an international war. On December 6, 1842, the Blancos under Manuel Oribe and the Colorados under Fructuoso Rivera fought the Battle of Arroyo Grande. Rivera's forces were utterly defeated, and Oribe laid siege to Montevideo.George Bruce, Harbottle's Dictionary of Battles. Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1981. . Great Siege of Montevideo Giuseppe Garibaldi, leader of the Italian Legion and Uruguayan Navy With the destruction of the Uruguayan army at the battle of Arroyo Grande, it was assumed that the country's capital, Montevideo, would fall to the combined forces of the Buenos Aires governor Juan Manuel de Rosas and the former Uruguayan president Manuel Oribe. However, Oribe's siege of Montevideo lasted for nine years. The newly freed slaves, who formed a contingent 5,000 strong, and the community of foreign exiles were mostly responsible for the defense of the city. By 1843 Montevedio's population of thirty thousand inhabitants was highly cosmoplitan with Uruguayans making up only a third of it. The remaining were chiefly Italian (4205), Spanish (3406), Argentine (2.553), Portuguese (659), English (606) and Brazilians (492). During this time Uruguay had two parallel governments: *Gobierno de la Defensa in Montevideo, led by Joaquín Suárez (1843 - 1852) *Gobierno del Cerrito (with headquarters at the present neighbourhood Cerrito de la Victoria), ruling the rest of the country, led by Manuel Oribe (1843 - 1851) The British Empire eventually saved the city by allowing it to receive supplies. First, the British and French naval forces temporarily blockaded the port of Buenos Aires during December 1845. Then, the French and British fleets protected Montevideo from the sea. French, Spanish and Italian legionnaires, led by Giuseppe Garibaldi, teamed up with the Colorados in defending the city.Garibaldi in Uruguay: A Reputation Reconsidered David McLean, The English Historical Review, Vol. 113, No. 451 (April , 1998), pp. 351-366 Published by: Oxford University Press Also in 1846, the 73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot, sent by Britain, arrived in Montevideo and defended it for seven months against besieging Argentine troops.\\"In 1846 the 73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot sailed from Cork, and after a brief stop at Rio de Janeiro, moved to Montevideo, which it defended for seven months against the attacking Argentinian forces.\\" The Highland Regiments: Tigers in Tartan, William Pratt Paul, p. 19, Impulse Publications Limited, 1971 Historians believe that the French and British forces intervened in the region to ensure free navigation along the Rio Parana and Rio Uruguay. However, in 1850, both the French and British withdrew after signing a treaty which represented a triumph for Juan Manuel de Rosas and his Federal Party in Argentina.The Great War, 1843–52. After the withdrawal of British and French troops, it appeared that Montevideo would fall to Juan Manuel de Rosas and Oribe. However, an uprising against de Rosas led by fellow Federalist Justo José de Urquiza, governor of Argentina's Entre Ríos Province, with the assistance of a small Uruguayan force, changed the situation completely. Manuel Oribe was defeated in 1851, leaving the Colorados in full control of the country. Brazil followed up by intervening in Uruguay in May 1851, supporting the Colorados with financial and naval forces. This led to the Platine War with Rosas in August 1851. In February 1852, after being defeated at Caseros, Rosas resigned and Urquiza's pro-Colorado forces lifted the siege of Montevideo. Aftermath The government of Montevideo rewarded Brazil's financial and military support at the final stages of the war by signing five treaties in 1851 that provided for perpetual alliance between the two countries. Brazil was required to extradite runaway slaves and criminals from Uruguay. In fact, during the war, both the Blancos and the Colorados had abolished slavery in Uruguay to reinforce their respective military forces. The treaties also allowed joint navigation on the Rio Uruguay and its tributaries and exempted cattle and salted meat exports from taxes. The Uruguayan cattle industry was devastated by the war. The treaty also acknowledged Uruguay's debt to Brazil for its aid against the Blancos and Brazil's commitment for granting an additional loan. Uruguay renounced its territorial claims north of the Río Cuareim, thereby reducing its area to about 176,000 square kilometers, and recognized Brazil's exclusive right of navigation in the Laguna Merin and the Rio Yaguaron, the natural border between both countries. Later conflicts Both parties were weary of the chaos. In 1870, they came to an agreement to define spheres of influence: the Colorados would control Montevideo and the coastal region, the Blancos would rule the hinterland with its agricultural estates. In addition, the Blancos were paid half a million dollars to compensate them for the loss of their stake in Montevideo. But the caudillo mentality was difficult to erase from Uruguay and political feuding continued culminating in the Revolution of the Lances (Revolución de las Lanzas) (1870–1872), and later with the uprising of Aparicio Saravia. In popular culture The French author Alexandre Dumas described Oribe's siege of Montevideo as a new Trojan war. This comparison was made in the novel The new Troy.

M'Intosh in 1823. Chief Justice John Marshall explained and applied the way that colonial powers laid claim to lands belonging to foreign sovereign nations during the Age of Discovery. Under it, title to lands lay with the government whose subjects travelled to and occupied a territory whose inhabitants were not subjects of a European Christian monarch. The doctrine has been primarily used to support decisions invalidating or ignoring aboriginal possession of land in favor of modern colonial/imperial governments, such as in the 2005 case of Sherrill v. Oneida Nation. The 1823 case was the result of collusive lawsuits where land speculators worked together to make claims to achieve a desired result.How the Indians Lost Their Land: Law and Power on the Frontier Stuart Banner, 2005, pg 171–2The Dark Side of Efficiency: Johnson v. M'Intosh and the Expropriation of American Indian Lands, Eric Kades, 148 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1065 2000, pg 148 John Marshall explained the Court's reasoning. The decision has been the subject of a number of law review articles and has come under increased scrutiny by modern legal theorists.  History  The Doctrine of Discovery was promulgated by European monarchies in order to legitimize the colonization of lands outside of Europe. Between the mid-fifteenth century and the mid-twentieth century, this idea allowed European entities to seize lands inhabited by indigenous peoples under the guise of discovery. In 1494, the Treaty of Tordesillas declared that only non-Christian lands could be colonized under the Doctrine of Discovery. In 1792, U.S. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson claimed that this European Doctrine of Discovery was international law which would also apply equally to dealings the infant U.S. government would have with non-Christian lands.https://truthout.org/articles/the-united-states-is-founded-upon-the- model-of-european-conquest-dispose-of-the-disposable-people/ The Doctrine and its legacy continue to influence American imperialism and treatment of indigenous peoples. Johnson v. M'Intosh The plaintiff Johnson had inherited land, originally purchased from the Piankeshaw tribes. Defendant McIntosh claimed the same land, having purchased it under a grant from the United States. It appears that in 1775 members of the Piankeshaw tribe sold certain land in the Indiana Territory to Lord Dunmore, royal governor of Virginia and others. In 1805 the Piankeshaw conveyed much of the same land to William Henry Harrison, governor of the Indiana Territory, thus giving rise to conflicting claims of title. In reviewing whether the courts of the United States should recognize land titles obtained from Native Americans prior to American independence, the court decided that they should not. Chief Justice John Marshall had large real estate holdings that would have been affected if the case were decided in favor of Johnson. Rather than recuse himself from the case, however, the Chief Justice wrote the decision for a unanimous Supreme Court.Frichner, Tonya Gonnella. (2010). “Preliminary Study of the Impact on Indigenous Peoples of the International Legal Construct Known as the Doctrine of Discovery.” E/C.19/2010/13. Presented at the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, Ninth Session, United Nations Economic and Social Council, New York, 27 Apr 2010. =Decision= Marshall found that ownership of land comes into existence by virtue of discovery of that land, a rule that had been observed by all European countries with settlements in the New World. Legally, the United States was the true owner of the land because it inherited that ownership from Britain, the original discoverer. Marshall noted: > On the discovery of this immense continent, the great nations of Europe ... > as they were all in pursuit of nearly the same object, it was necessary, in > order to avoid conflicting settlements, and consequent war with each other, > to establish a principle which all should acknowledge as the law by which > the right of acquisition, which they all asserted, should be regulated as > between themselves. This principle was that discovery gave title to the > government by whose subjects, or by whose authority, it was made, against > all other European governments, which title might be consummated by > possession. ... The history of America, from its discovery to the present > day, proves, we think, the universal recognition of these principles. Chief Justice Marshall noted the 1455 papal bull Romanus Pontifex approved Portugal's claims to lands discovered along the coast of West Africa, and the 1493 Inter Caetera had ratified Spain's right to conquer newly found lands, after Christopher Columbus had already begun doing so, but stated: \\"Spain did not rest her title solely on the grant of the Pope. Her discussions respecting boundary, with France, with Great Britain, and with the United States, all show that she placed it on the rights given by discovery. Portugal sustained her claim to the by the same title.\\" United States law Marshall pointed to the exploration charters given to the explorer John Cabot as proof that other nations had accepted the doctrine. The tribes which occupied the land were, at the moment of discovery, no longer completely sovereign and had no property rights but rather merely held a right of occupancy. Further, only the discovering nation or its successor could take possession of the land from the natives by conquest or purchase. The doctrine was cited in other cases as well. With Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, it supported the concept that tribes were not independent states but \\"domestic dependent nations\\". The decisions in Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe and Duro v. Reina used the doctrine to prohibit tribes from criminally prosecuting first non-Indians, then Indians who were not a member of the prosecuting tribe. The doctrine has been cited by the US Supreme Court as recently as 2005, in City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York. Writing for the majority, Ruth Bader Ginsburg stated that \\"Under the 'doctrine of discovery...' fee title [ownership] to the lands occupied by Indians when the colonists arrived became vested in the sovereign—first the discovering European nation and later the original states and the United States.\\"  Legal critique  As the Piankeshaw were not party to the litigation, \\"no Indian voices were heard in a case which had, and continues to have, profound effects on Indian property rights.\\"Dussias, Allison M., \\"Squaw Drudges, Farm Wives, and the Dann Sisters' Last Stand: American Indian Women’s Resistance to Domestication and the Denial of Their Property Rights\\", 77 N.C. L. REV. 637, 645 (1999) Professor Blake A. Watson of the University of Dayton School of Law finds Marshall's claim of \\"universal recognition\\" of the \\"doctrine of discovery\\" historically inaccurate. In reviewing the history of European exploration Marshall did not take note of Spanish Dominican philosopher Francisco de Vitoria's 1532 De Indis nor De Jure belli Hispanorum in barbaros. Vitoria adopted from Thomas Aquinas the Roman law concept of ius gentium, and concluded that the Indians were rightful owners of their property and that their chiefs validly exercised jurisdiction over their tribes, a position held previously by Palacios Rubios. His defense of American Indians was based on a scholastic understanding of the intrinsic dignity of man, a dignity he found being violated by Spain's policies in the New World.Pagden, Anthony. Vitoria: Political Writings, Cambridge University Press, 1991 Marshall also overlooked more recent American experience, specifically Roger Williams's purchase of the Providence Plantation. In order to forestall Massachusetts and Plymouth designs on the land, Williams subsequently traveled to England to obtain a patent which referenced the purchase from the natives. The Royal Charter of Rhode Island issued by Charles II acknowledged the rights of the Indians to the land. Nor does Justice Marshall seem to have taken note of the policy of the Dutch West India Company which only conferred ownership rights in New Netherland after the grantee had acquired title by purchase from the Indian owners, a practice also followed by the Quakers in Pennsylvania. Watson and others, such as Robert Williams Jr. suggest that Marshall misinterpreted the \\"discovery doctrine\\" as giving exclusive right to lands discovered, rather than the exclusive right to treaty with the inhabitants thereof.  Contemporary advocacy efforts  Discovery doctrine has been severely condemned as socially unjust, racist, and in violation of basic and fundamental human rights. The United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) noted the Doctrine of Discovery \\"as the foundation of the violation of their (Indigenous people) human rights\\". The eleventh session of the UNPFII, held at the UN's New York headquarters from 7-18 May 2012, had the special theme of \\"“The Doctrine of Discovery: its enduring impact on indigenous peoples and the right to redress for past conquests (articles 28 and 37 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples),\\" UNPFII Eleventh Session, United Nations Economic and Social Council, New York.

The General Convention of the Episcopal Church, conducted on 8–17 August 2009, passed a resolution officially repudiating the discovery doctrine.Schjonberg, Mary Frances. \\"General Convention renounces Doctrine of Discovery\\", Episcopal Life Online, 27 August 2009. At the 2012 Unitarian Universalist Association General Assembly in Phoenix, AZ, delegates of the Unitarian Universalist Association passed a resolution repudiating the Doctrine of Discovery and calling on Unitarian Universalists to study the Doctrine and eliminate its presence from the current-day policies, programs, theologies, and structures of Unitarian Universalism. In 2013, at its 29th General Synod, the United Church of Christ followed suit in repudiating the doctrine in a near-unanimous vote. At the 2016 Synod, 10-17 June in Grand Rapids, MI, delegates to the annual general assembly of the Christian Reformed Church rejected the Doctrine of Discovery as heresy in response to a study report on the topic. At the 222nd General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) (2016), commissioners called on members of the church to confess the church's complicity and repudiate the Doctrine of Discovery. The commissioners directed that a report be written reviewing the history of the Doctrine of Discovery; that report was approved by the 223rd General Assembly (2018), along with recommendations for a variety of additional actions that could be taken by the church at all levels to acknowledge indigenous peoples and to confront racism against them PC(USA) \\"Doctrine of Discovery Report\\".

The township which developed in the mid-1860s was named after the noted Australian explorer, John Oxley. At the 2006 census, Oxley had a population of 159 people. History The Lachlan River at Oxley. =Aboriginal History= Oxley is part of the traditional lands of the Muthi Muthi Aboriginal tribe. In 1836 explorer Major Mitchell took Muthi Muthi woman Tourandury and her 4-year-old daughter Ballandella from Oxley as guides through the land. Tourandury was also part of a group of Aborigines who met with explorer Charles Sturt and helped him when his whale boat capsized on the nearby Murrumbidgee river. Ballandella was removed from her mother and taken to Sydney to be educated by Mitchell and his friend Dr Nicholson. Queen Caroline of Oxley and her sister Judy are apical ancestors of many surviving Muthi Muthi people today. =\\"Oxley\\" and \\"Tupra\\" stations= In about the mid-1840s Phelps and Chadwick took up a run on the lower Lachlan which they called \\"Thelangerin West\\". In 1848 the lease was purchased by Thomas D'Archy who renamed the run \\"Oxley\\", and called the station homestead \\"Oxley House\\".Feldtmann, Arthur, The Balranald Story, 1976 (a souvenir of the 'Back to Balranald' celebration - 28 September to 5 October 1976). Opposite the \\"Oxley\\" run on the north bank of the Lachlan River was the \\"Tupra\\" run, held by the Tyson brothers since the 1840s. By the 1860s it was held solely by James Tyson. =Oxley township= In the mid-1860s the squatter James Tyson saw a business opportunity and built a hotel at a new township which was developing at a crossing-place over the river on his \\"Tupra\\" run. A report in the Pastoral Times newspaper in November 1866 stated that \\"Mr. Tyson has built a brick hotel\\" which was to be opened shortly at the \\"new township of Oxley\\". The report added: \\"There is not much traffic past the house, and very few men in the neighborhood, so the prospects of doing a good trade are not very encouraging\\".Pastoral Times, 17 November 1866, p. 3. Bridge over the Lachlan River In December 1866 it was reported that a petition was to be sent to Government \\"to place a sum of money on the estimates to build a bridge at a point of the Lachlan River, about eight miles above the government township of Oxley, which is opposite Mr. D'Archy's station\\". The report added that \\"there is a boat there at present, which is a great convenience to persons travelling\\".Pastoral Times, 1 December 1866, p. 3. A Government land-sale, which included lots at Oxley township, was held at Hay on 9 March 1868.New South Wales Government Gazette, No. 35, Friday, 7 February 1868, p. 372-3. Tyson's brick hotel was called the Oxley Hotel; during 1869 Thomas Donahee was recorded as the licensee. In April 1870 at the Hay Police Court Daniel Murphy, \\"formerly of Maude\\", applied for a licence for the Oxley Hotel (which was subsequently granted). In December 1870 George Carter was successful in his application for a licence for a second public-house at Oxley, called the Stockman's Hotel.Hotel Publicans Licences, NSW Government Gazettes; Pastoral Times, 23 April 1870, p. 2; 3 December 1870, p. 2. George Carter remained publican of the Stockman's Hotel at Oxley until 1872 when he apparently closed his establishment to carry on the nearby Paika Creek Hotel at Paika Creek. The Oxley Hotel was once again the sole public-house at the township; Daniel Murphy remained publican until 1874.Hotel Publicans Licences, NSW Government Gazettes. In June 1874 the publican's licence for the Oxley Hotel was transferred from Daniel Murphy to John Murphy. The ownership of the Oxley Hotel apparently remained in the hands of James Tyson (with the various publicans leasing the hotel). In January 1875 advertisements were placed in the Riverine Grazier newspaper by Tyson's nephew, James Tyson Jnr., seeking a \\"respectable tenant\\" for the Oxley Hotel. A month later it was reported that John Murphy's licence for the Oxley Hotel was to be transferred to Mr. Robert Jackson. Jackson was the publican of the Oxley Hotel during 1875 to 1877.Riverine Grazier, 6 January 1875, p. 3 (and subsequent issues); Riverine Grazier, 17 February 1875, p. 2. In 1878 Michael Joseph Delandre took over the licence. Delandre had previously been a policeman, stationed at Maude. A traveller to Oxley in early 1879 reported that \\"Mr. Delandre… runs a hotel business with a little storekeeping combined\\". The Oxley Hotel was described as \\"one of the most comfortable and cleanly roadside houses I have met with; the building is substantial and commodious\\". The writer reported that Delandre \\"with an eye to business, is constructing a pontoon bridge, which he intends laying across the river in front of his house\\". He added: \\"In his undertaking [Delandre] deserves support and success, for the bridge will be a great boon to travelling stock, and also to the passengers from Hay to Balranald, as Messrs. Cobb and Co. will run coaches between those towns as soon as the bridge is completed, whereas at present the mails are carried on horseback\\".’A Tale of Many Towns’, by ‘the Waif’, Town and Country Journal, 15 February 1879, p. 306. St Barnabas Anglican Church, Oxley Just two years later another traveller who arrived at Oxley on the mail-coach described Delandre's pontoon-bridge as \\"a wretched apology for a bridge, in the shape of a pontoon, the condition of which seems to be verging upon the last stages of dissolution\\".’Hay to Balranald’, by ‘the Raven’, Town and Country Journal, 21 May 1881, p. 992. In 1881 Oxley township once again had two hotels when the Royal Hotel was opened with John Westhead as the publican. In 1882 there was a re-shuffle of publicans as Delandre left the Oxley Hotel to be replaced by William Westhead, and Daniel Murphy took over the licence of the Royal. Oxley Post Office opened on 1 November 1884 and closed in 1969. In about 1888 the Royal Hotel had ceased trading at Oxley. In 1889 a licence was granted to Thompson S. Page for a new public-house at the township, the Commercial Hotel (possibly a name-change of the old Royal Hotel premises). In 1889 the publican of the Oxley Hotel was John Parr. In 1890 \\"Oxley\\" station was purchased by the A.M.L.&F.; Company. R. P. McFarland purchased \\"Oxley\\" station in 1912.Feldtmann, op. cit.

Goodisson was born in Holyhead, Wales. She trained as a nurse and at age 19 married London physician Lawford David Evans. Soon after they moved to Auckland, New Zealand, where they started a family. The couple and their two children moved to Melbourne in 1895, and in 1897 established in Myrnong private hospital at St. Kilda. Her husband died in 1903 and thereafter she went to Western Australia where she met and married her second husband, Albert Elliot Goodisson in 1904. They lived in Geraldton until Albert Goodisson went to Batavia in September 1913 to receive treatment for an illness, he died in 1914 leaving little to his wife, she borrowed money from her friend Ivy Brookes and returned to Melbourne. She was involved in patriotic causes during World War I, however her finances did not improve, and she took another loan from Brookes to establish a library at Elwood in Melbourne. Debts and ill health forced its liquidation in 1924. Goodisson moved to Sydney to be with her daughter in 1926. She joined the Women's Reform League and with Ruby Rich, Marion Louisa Piddington and Anna Roberts founded the Racial Improvement Society, which later (1928) became the Racial Hygiene Association of New South Wales.FPA Health. 2 November 2006.80 years of Family Planning, Press ReleaseHorin, A. 20 November 2006.

Goodisson served as general secretary for the association. She advocated the selective breeding of future generations for the elimination of hereditary disease, and defects and campaigned unsuccessfully for the segregation and sterilization of the mentally deficient and for the introduction of pre-marital health examinations. Although Goodisson campaigned for her association's eugenics goals, her main interests were in contraception and politics. The likely catalyst for her campaign interests was her husband's death from general paralysis and derangement (general paralysis of the insane) a symptom of Tertiary Syphilis. In 1932 Goodisson unsuccessfully stood for the seat of Newcastle as the Social Reform Party’s candidate. In 1933 the association established a birth control clinic in Sydney which Goodisson described as the first in Australia; however, Piddington had established a birth control clinic in Melbourne two years earlier. The clinic served married women, providing diaphragms so that unwanted pregnancies would not be terminated by illegal abortions. The activities of the clinic were controversial; it received government subsidies only to have them withdrawn. Piddington's Melbourne clinic was forced to close in 1943 when the rubber used to make diaphragms was needed for war efforts; the Sydney clinic remained open. Goodisson remained active in the association until her death in 1947; however the organisation's activities were greatly reduced during the war and did not regain momentum until the 1960s. In 1960 the association was renamed the Family Planning Association of Australia.Stefania Siedlecky and Diana Wyndham (1990) \\"Populate and perish : Australian women's fight for birth control\\".

Coolidge was also a scholar in international affairs, a planner of the Widener Library, a member of the United States Foreign Service, and editor-in-chief of the policy journal Foreign Affairs. Early life  Archibald Coolidge was born in Boston, Massachusetts as the third of five boys. His parents were Harvard University Law School graduate Joseph Randolph Coolidge and Julia (née Gardner) Coolidge, both from prominent and wealthy Boston Brahmin families. His siblings included U.S. Minister to Nicaragua John Gardner Coolidge, noted lawyer Harold Jefferson Coolidge Sr. (the father of zoologist Harold Jefferson Coolidge Jr.), and mathematician and fellow Harvard professor Julian Lowell Coolidge. His paternal uncle was Thomas Jefferson Coolidge, the Boston businessman and U.S. Minister to France. His father, Joseph Randolph Coolidge, was a great-grandson of the 3rd United States President Thomas Jefferson, through his maternal grandparents, Thomas Mann Randolph Jr. and Martha Jefferson Randolph. Archibald's great-uncles were Thomas Jefferson Randolph, George Wythe Randolph, Andrew Jackson Donelson, and his grandfather, Joseph Coolidge, was a distant relative of President Calvin Coolidge.

Career From 1893 on, he taught various history courses at Harvard, first as an instructor, from 1899 on as Assistant Professor, and in 1908, he was made a full Professor of History. Coolidge today is recognized as having turned the Harvard College Library into a major research institution. Coolidge helped make the Harvard Library \\"one of the best organized libraries for scholars and students as well as one of the great libraries of the world.\\" He is further credited with bringing the study of History of Latin America, the Far East, and the Slavic Countries to the History Department of Harvard. In 1908, he was appointed to the Harvard Library Council and was chairman of this council in 1909. In 1910, he became the first Director of the Harvard University Library.

He kept before the University and its friends a broad and comprehensive idea of the Library and its possibilities, and had the satisfaction of seeing the Harvard Library under his administration reach an assured position among the great libraries of the world. This result was due in large to his own wisdom, vision, patient skill, and interest in every side of the Library's welfare. He encouraged equally the acquisition of unique special collections, the prompt and steady purchase of books asked for, and improved facilities for work by members of the University and by visiting scholars.\\" His own Department described his personal characteristics: \\"He gave himself to history; and it was characteristic of him that his gifts to the Department in his lifetime should take permanent form in his bequests... One prejudice he did not rise above- a prejudice for intellectual distinction; but to him this was a thing of many kinds... His attachments were of the heart. He was a man of strong feeling, quick to anger at injustice, profoundly stirred by sympathy. He hated the waste of useless friction and mis-directed strength... His mind was essentially political: he knew that he lived in a world of men, not of ideas.\\" Coolidge's time at Harvard shows his true dedication to Academia, with his emphasized focus on history and the improvement of the Harvard Library. He was an essential member of the Harvard Faculty and made improvements to the college that would prove to be long-lasting. =Diplomatic career= Between college terms and parallel to his post at Harvard, Coolidge also pursued a career in diplomacy, which fit his travel interests and his desire and aptitude for learning languages well. He held posts as secretary to the American legation in Saint Petersburg, Russia (1890–1891), as private secretary to the American minister in France (1892), and as secretary to the American legation in Vienna (1893). At the end of World War I, more important assignments followed. Coolidge joined the Inquiry study group established by Woodrow Wilson. The U.S. State Department sent him in 1918 to Russia to report on the situation there.

Publications *The United States as a World Power (1908) The United States as a World Power was originally published in 1908 and is based on a number of lectures that Coolidge delivered from 1906 to 1907 in Sorbonne. These lectures have been re-published numerous times in the creation of this book. Throughout Coolidge's upbringing and development as a scholar, his most heavily studied area was in the field of foreign relations. This can be seen through his time spent as editor of \\"'Foreign Affairs as well as the majority of his publications involving foreign relations. In this book, Coolidge chronicles America’s formation as a nation leading up to its increased involvement in foreign affairs in the 20th century. The book showcases Coolidge’s interpretations of the status of global affairs at the beginning of the 20th century with a focus on the United States. It represents an early 20th century scholar’s mindset. While Coolidge is quick to move past some of America’s obvious flaws of the time at moments, he delivers a clear, concise chronicle. The book is dense in its discussion of the overall growth of the United States, as Coolidge attempts to create a full narrative. Overall, this books shows that American scholars at the beginning of the 20th century were thinking critically about the United States’ positioning in the world. 1) Introduction: In the Introduction, Coolidge outlines the status of global politics at the beginning of the 20th century. He quickly states, “The idea that one people should control the known world is ancient enough, its most salient expression being found in imperial Rome and equally imperial China; and it is not extinct even now.\\" The tendency of states holding a considerably larger amount of power compared to others is a consistent trend throughout global history. Coolidge ranks the five great powers of the world in order: 1) Great Britain 2) Russia 3) France 4) United States 5) Germany. (9-12) Criteria included in these rankings are: size of landholdings, amount of resources, and birth rates. He includes these rankings to put the U.S’s placing in the global scale of power in perspective. In conclusion, Coolidge asserts that the United States will have a huge role to play in the upcoming century and that this can either be for the benefit or detriment of the world.(15) 2) Formation and Growth: In this chapter, Coolidge outlines America’s growth as a state from its founding. He describes the unique geography of the United States in order to differentiate the nation from other world powers. The U.S, located in the middle of the Western Hemisphere in a “wholly temperate zone”(19), is homogenous in its geographic makeup. There are no serious natural obstacles that block Americans from one another; other global examples include the Andes in South America, the Himalayas in Asia, and the Sahara in Africa. Coolidge then outlines America’s growth as a state, originally starting as a number of colonies and later transitioning to own all land from the Atlantic to the Pacific. (22-36). This growth was initially threatened with the Civil War, in which North-South divisions reached an all-time low, however Coolidge believed the abolition of slavery would eliminate the possibility of another conflict. (37) In slowly expanding throughout its history, from the Louisiana Purchase to the Gasden Purchase to the Alaska Purchase, the United States embarks upon a new wave of expansion in the years following the Civil War. This wave is spiked by the U.S’s involvement in the Spanish-American War. 3) Nationality and Immigration Coolidge takes time to comment on the evolving makeup of the American population in this chapter. While immigration to the United States greatly increased throughout the 19th century, bringing in peoples from all over Europe and even Asia, Coolidge states, “the United States of the future bids fair to be an English-speaking community, of mixed origin, but fused by common traditions, interests, aspirations, and language into one essentially homogenous people.”(Coolidge 60) The downfall to this creation of a homogenous community is that a major group is left out of this, colored people in America. Coolidge spends more time discussing this issue in the next chapter. 4) Race Questions Coolidge acknowledges that at the time of his writing there existed one of the most complicated issues within the United States, the problem of race relations. He acknowledges the existence of a white superiority complex, predominantly among the English-speaking peoples of the world. (64) These people are selective in which races they choose to welcome into their portion of society, as race-mixing is not socially acceptable. (65) Further, America’s treatment of the Native-American and African-American populations are a seriously troubling chapter in American history, according to Coolidge. In time-old fashion, Coolidge refers to Native Americans as the “red man” (68) and details their subjugation as “one of the many unsatisfactory chapters in the history of dealings between the stronger and weaker races of the world; but this chapter is neither so disgraceful nor so important as has been made out.”(68) He is quick to glance over this part of American history. With African-Americans, Coolidge foresees increased problems between white and black Americans, particularly in the South, most likely leading to further segregation. Coolidge's worries of the future race relations in the South later turn out to be true during the Jim Crow Era. Another issue of race involved the increased immigration of Japanese and Chinese immigrants, mainly moving to the West Coast. The presence of Asian migrants in America was met with great hostility; examples of anti-Asian sentiments include the passing of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 that attempted to stop Chinese further immigration. Coolidge examines the issue of Asian immigration not through a humanitarian lens but through the potential threat of retaliation from China and Japan. (78) He worries that both Japan and China would threaten the United States if its people were being persecuted. Altogether, Coolidge is neutral in his dealing of race relations within America. He notes the grave threat that poor race relations will bring to America but does not look to their causes in order to determine a solution. 5) Ideals and Shibboleths In this chapter Coolidge brings up a contradiction within the American conscious in the thirty-year period before the Spanish- American War. In this time frame, Americans were able to create a national ideal: “They believed their country to be the best, the freest, the richest, the happiest, in the world, and they gave due recognition to their own merits which had made it so.”(82) At the same time there existed so many internal struggles that challenged this ideal: race relations, political corruption, a growing wage gap, the Depression of 1893. However, Coolidge finds that what kept the American psyche afloat was a firm belief in the nation’s founding principles of liberty and equality.(91) This can be proved through American support for independence movements throughout the world and foreign policy based on cultivating mutually benefitting relationships with other nations. (93) 6) Monroe Doctrine The Monroe Doctrine attempted to differentiate the United States with the older powers in Europe. (Monroe Doctrine) The U.S formally opposed colonialism in the Americas while also promising to not interfere in the European colonies. Coolidge writes on three core characteristics of the Doctrine that were commonly misunderstood: 1) it was not an act of disrespect 2) it was not a part of international law 3) it was a doctrine of self-defense. (107) He finds that the basis of the Doctrine was crafted in order to distinguish between the New World and the Old World. (118) As discussed earlier, the history of the 19th century in the United States involves little to no dealings in foreign affairs. However, Coolidge asserts that the increased conflicts within European landholdings placed the U.S in a difficult position. He is afraid of America entering a role of an \\"international policeman\\", as that title brings countless responsibilities and potential conflicts with nations across the world. He asks, \\"if the United States is going to abandon that portion of the Monroe Doctrine which forbids interference in European affairs, how can it insist that Europe shall not meddle in those of America?\\" (120) Contrary to his fears of increased international activity, the United States eventually abandon the principles of the Monroe Doctrine. 7) The Spanish War To Coolidge, the Spanish-American War marks \\"the beginning of an epoch\\"(121). Breaking away from the Monroe Doctrine, the United States fully enter into global politics in engaging in military conflict with Spain. While the most notable causes for war include the sinking of the USS Maine and sensationalist news stories about the Cuban Revolution from Joseph Pulitzer's New York World and William Randolph Hearst's New York Journal, Coolidge finds a number of further reasons for the war with Spain. These include already poor relations between the countries and an American desire of spreading its influence in Spanish territories.(122-123) The war itself to Coolidge is not worth discussing in much detail, \\"The war was a short bloodless one between two nations of very unequal resources. There were but three battles worthy of the name, -two on water and one on the land.\\"(122) In this, he references the Battles at Manila Bay, El-Caney, and San Juan Hill. While he does praise the efforts of the American military, he notes that Spain's decreasing relevancy as a world power is a core reason for the American victory. Other historians even claim that U.S troops were ill- equipped, unprepared, and lacking in size. The war, although short in actual time spent fighting, brought about sweeping changes for both Cuba and the United States. These include greater American influence through naval access to the Pacific, Atlantic and Caribbean oceans, the liberation of Cuba, and an increased global reputation for America. Coolidge comments on this reputation,\\"The fame of the country's wealth and prosperity, of the ingenuity and practical abilities of its inhabitants, and especially of their eagerness to make money, was wide-spread.\\"(131) 8) The Acquisition of Colonies In this chapter Coolidge goes into the debates that occurred after the Spanish- American War involving America's role in the Spanish territories in Cuba, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii. There was growing anti-colonial sentiment in some sections of the United States, most notably lead by the Anti-Imperialist League. Anti-Imperialists, like Mark Twain, viewed America's efforts in expanding its global influence as contradictory to the United States' founding principles Coolidge, while not being as staunchly pro- imperialist as jingoes like Henry Cabot Lodge, states that the acquisition of colonies is simply an outcome of America's evolution. He even argues that the U.S, throughout its history, has \\"held lands which were virtually colonies,whose inhabitants did not enjoy the rights of self-government.\\" (137) He supports American growth and expansion, however he does acknowledge the struggles of colonization. While the territories America gained after the Spanish-American war were not as large as the landholdings of the British Empire, Coolidge fears the assimilation of American values with native peoples who speak different languages. (139) 9) The Philippine Problem Directly after the Spanish-American War, the American military began a long armed-conflict against Filipino revolutionaries. Revolutionaries The conflict resulted in 4,300 Americans killed compared to 20,000 Filipino soldiers killed and a staggering amount of around 200,000 civilians killed. In this chapter, Coolidge details the process of acquiring and the debates surrounding this acquisition. After defeating the Spanish forces in Manila, the U.S had three options in regards to the Philippines: 1) leave 2) give the islands to the insurgents 3) take the Philippines.(151) The U.S chose the third option, signing the Treaty of Paris in 1899. Throughout the American-Philippine War, a nationwide discussion revolved around the principality of the war. The Anti- Imperialists denounced American intervention in the islands. An example of their protests can be found in Mark Twain's essay, To the Person Sitting in Darkness. At the same time, expansionists viewed the bloodshed as a necessary byproduct of American growth. Coolidge finds flaws in both of these groups. For the Anti-Imperialists, he claims their desire to completely leave the Philippines and allow the inhabitants to govern themselves is impractical. (159) For the expansionists, Coolidge denounces expansionist claims that the United States will be able to establish a solid government because \\"The Filipinos belong to a race which has never shown any capacity for independent civilization, and which cannot reasonably be expected to do so at any time that can now be foreseen\\".(160) Coolidge's diminishes the Filipino people, but he does state that the Americans are the root problem in the handling of the Philippines.(169) He criticizes the U.S's inability to keep order and peace in the islands, the heavy taxation that the war caused, and the lack of communication between the Americans and Filipinos. (169) However, his overall conclusion is that the U.S \\"have accomplished a great deal in their task of transforming the islands. Improved means of communication, public works of all kinds, modern sanitation, justice, public security, works of all kinds, modern sanitation, justice, public security, honest and efficient government, popular participation in the government\\"(170). While Coolidge treats both expansionists and Anti-Imperialists equally in his criticisms, he overall leans toward the expansionists. The last 10 chapters of the book delve into the economic considerations in America's growth and the relationships between the United States and France, Germany, Russia, England, Canada, Latin America, the Pacific, China, and Japan. Coolidge goes into the historical associations that the United States has with each of these nations or regions. It is a further examination of the United States' placement in the world's global politics. *The Origins of the Triple Alliance (1917) *Ten Years of War and Peace (1927) * Editor-in-Chief, Foreign Affairs, a journal of the Council on Foreign Relations.

Taube commenced his undergraduate education at Stanford, relocating to Berkeley where he completed a B.A. in Anthropology in 1980. His graduate studies were undertaken in Anthropology at Yale, where he completed his Masters degree in 1983 and was awarded his Doctorate in 1988. At Yale, Taube studied under several notable Mayanist researchers, including Michael D. Coe, Floyd Lounsbury and the art historian Mary Miller.Coe (1992, p.244). Taube later co-authored with Miller a well-received encyclopaedic work, The Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico and the Maya.Miller and Taube (1993). Field research undertaken during the course of his career include a number of assignments on archaeological, linguistic and ethnological projects conducted in the Chiapas highlands, Yucatán Peninsula, central Mexico, Honduras and most recently, Guatemala. As of 2003, Taube has served as Project Iconographer for the Proyecto San Bartolo, co- directed by William Saturno and Monica Urquizu. His primary role is to interpret the murals of Pinturas Structure Sub-1, dating to the first century B.C. In 2004, Taube co-directed an archaeological project documenting previously unknown sources of \\"Olmec Blue\\" jadeite in eastern Guatemala. Taube has also investigated pre-Columbian sites in Ecuador and Peru. An early theme examined by Taube's papers and other publications concerned the agricultural development and symbolism of Mesoamerica, such as in his 1983 presentation to the Fifth Palenque Round Table on the Maya maize god.\\"The Classic Maya Maize God: A Reappraisal\\", published 1985 in Fifth Palenque Round Table, 1983 (Taube 1985). Taube has also written on the symbolism and deity associations of maize for other cultures, such as the Olmec. Another research theme explored by Taube is that of inter– and intra-regional exchanges and contacts for Mesoamerica, such as with those of Aridoamerica and the American Southwest. He has also researched the interactions between Teotihuacan, a dominant center in Mexico's plateau region during the Classic era of Mesoamerican chronology, and contemporary Maya polities. His father, Canadian-born Henry Taube (d. 2005), was the recipient of the 1983 Nobel Prize in chemistry.Shwartz (2005); see also Coe (1992, p.244).

It is the name of a noble Anglo- Norman family that originated in district of the Forest of Lyons, north of the town of Lyons-la-Forêt in Haute Normandie, where the family seat was the Castle of Lyons.Ministry of Culture: Château fort Judith A. Green Henry I: King of England and Duke of Normandy, Cambridge University Press, 2006. The introduction is online: \\"Introduction: A surfeit of lampreys\\"Office de Tourisme du Pays de Lyons-la-Forêt: Le pays de Lyons à travers l’histoire . This site also contains further historical detail concerning the castle and its royal connections. The original surname was \\"de Lyons\\" (\\"of [the Forest and Castle] of Lyons\\"): subsequently, the \\"de\\" was removed from the name, and some branches removed the \\"s\\" from the end of the word, producing \\"Lyon\\". The English progenitors of this family were Ingelram de Lyons, Lord of Lyons, who arrived in England with the Norman Conquest, and his relation, Nicholas de Lyons, who emigrated from Normandy to England in 1080 and was granted lands at Warkworth, Northamptonshire by William of Normandy. Descendants of this family emigrated to Scotland, during the 14th-century, to Ireland, during the 15th- century, to Antigua, during the 16th-century, and to New York, during the 17th century. However, there are other families with the surname that are not related to, or descendent from, the noble Anglo-Norman family. As was common amongst servants of gentry and noble dynasties during the Middle Ages, some of the servants of the noble Lyons family adopted the surname of their Lords to express their allegiance. There is also a Celtic Irish family whose name derives from the Celtic word for \\"grey\\".The Surnames of Ireland, Edward MacLysaght, sixth edition (1997), published by the Irish Academic Press, . This surname derives from the Irish noble names of Ó Laighin and 'Ó Liatháin. These Irish families are not related to the Norman noble family that originated in Normandy. However, confusingly, there are also descendants of the noble family, which had seats in County Offaly and County Westmeath, in Ireland.

The film is an adaptation of Victor Hugo's 1869 novel of the same name and stars Mary Philbin as the blind Dea and Conrad Veidt as Gwynplaine. The film is known for the grim carnival freak-like grin on the character Gwynplaine's face, which often leads it to be classified as a horror film. Film critic Roger Ebert stated, \\"The Man Who Laughs is a melodrama, at times even a swashbuckler, but so steeped in Expressionist gloom that it plays like a horror film.\\" The Man Who Laughs is a Romantic melodrama, similar to films such as The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923). The film was one of the early Universal Pictures productions that made the transition from silent films to sound films, using the Movietone sound system introduced by William Fox. The film was completed in April 1927 but was held for release in April 1928, with sound effects and a music score that included the song, \\"When Love Comes Stealing\\", by Walter Hirsch, Lew Pollack, and Ernö Rapée. Plot In 1680s England, King James II sentences his political enemy, Lord Clancharlie, to death in an iron maiden. Clancharlie's son, Gwynplaine, is disfigured with a permanent grin by comprachico Dr. Hardquannone, so that he will \\"laugh forever at his fool of a father\\". When the comprachicos are exiled, Gwynplaine is deserted in the snow. He discovers a blind baby girl, Dea, whose mother has died of hypothermia. Together, they are taken in by the mountebank Ursus. Years later, a now-adult Gwynplaine has become the Laughing Man, the freak show star of a traveling carnival. He and Dea have also fallen in love; he remains distant, believing himself unworthy of her affection due to his disfigurement, although she cannot see it. Meanwhile, the jester Barkilphedro, who had been involved in Lord Clancharlie's execution, is now attached to the court of Queen Anne. He discovers records that reveal Gwynplaine's lineage and rightful inheritance. That estate is currently possessed by sexually aggressive vamp Duchess Josiana. On an evening of Gwynplaine's show performance, Josiana attends, but does not laugh with the rest of the crowd, as she is attracted to Gwynplaine's disfigurement. After the show, she requests his presence to her room that night and attempts to seduce him, but he rejects her advances and flees. He returns to Dea and lets her touch his disfigured face. She accepts him by saying: \\"God closed my eyes so I could see the real Gwynplaine!\\", and the couple express their love for one another. Later the queen's guards arrest Gwynplaine and, to stop his friends from looking for him, they fake his death, leaving Dea, Ursus and his friends heartbroken. Then, the group are ordered to leave England by Barkilphedro. Queen Anne grants Gwynplaine his peerage and a seat in the House of Lords, and orders Josiana to marry him, in order to restore the proper ownership of the estate. Ultimately, Gwynplaine renounces his title, and refuses the Queen's order of marriage. He escapes, pursued by guards in a chase punctuated by swordplay. He arrives at the docks and is happily reunited with Dea and Ursus on their ship. Together, they all sail away from England. The film is thus given a more upbeat ending than that of Hugo's novel, in which both Dea and Gwynplaine die at the end. Cast * Mary Philbin as Dea * Conrad Veidt as Gwynplaine * Brandon Hurst as Barkilphedro * Julius Molnar Jr. as Gwynplaine (child) * Olga Vladimirovna Baklanova as Duchess Josiana * Cesare Gravina as Ursus * Stuart Holmes as Lord Dirry-Moir * Samuel de Grasse as King James II Stuart * George Siegmann as Dr. Hardquanonne * Josephine Crowell as Queen Anne Stuart Veidt plays a dual role as Gwynplaine's father, Lord Clancharlie. Many significant silent-era actors appeared in minor or uncredited roles, including D'Arcy Corrigan, Torben Meyer, Edgar Norton, Nick De Ruiz, Frank Puglia, and Charles Puffy. The animal actor used for the role of Homo the Wolf was a dog named Zimbo. Production Conrad Veidt as Gwynplaine, an inspiration for the Joker, the 1940 comic book nemesis of Batman Following the success of Universal Pictures's 1923 adaptation of Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre Dame, the company was eager to release another film starring Lon Chaney. A treatment adapting The Phantom of the Opera was prepared, but rejected by the Universal executives. In its place, Chaney was offered the lead in a film version of Hugo's The Man Who Laughs, to be produced under its French title (L'Homme Qui Rit) out of perceived similarity to Les Misérables. The Man Who Laughs, published in 1869, had been subject to significant criticism in both England and France, and was one of Hugo's least successful novels, but it had been filmed twice before. Pathé had produced L'Homme qui rit in France in 1908, and the Austrian film company Olympic-Film released a low-budget German version in 1921 as Das grinsende Gesicht. Despite Chaney's contract, production did not begin. Universal had failed to acquire film rights to the Hugo novel from the French studio Société Générale des Films. Chaney's contract was amended, releasing him from The Man Who Laughs, but permitting him to name the replacement film, ultimately resulting in the 1925 The Phantom of the Opera. After the success of Phantom, studio chief Carl Laemmle returned to The Man Who Laughs for Universal's next Gothic film \\"super-production\\". Laemmle selected two fellow expatriate Germans for the project. Director Paul Leni had been hired by Universal following his internationally acclaimed Waxworks, and had already proven himself to the company with The Cat and the Canary. Countryman Conrad Veidt was cast in the Gwynplaine role that was previously intended for Chaney. Veidt had worked with Leni for Waxworks and several other German films, and was well known for his role as Cesare in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. American actress Mary Philbin, who had played Christine Daaé opposite Chaney in Phantom, was cast as Dea. Leni was provided with a skilled crew. Charles D. Hall was chosen to design the sets. He had previously adapted Ben Carré's stage sets to film for Phantom and had worked with Leni for The Cat and the Canary. Jack Pierce became the head makeup artist at Universal in 1926, and was responsible for crafting Gwynplaine's appearance. During the sequence where Gwynplaine is presented to the House of Lords, the extras were so moved by Veidt's performance that they burst into applause.\\"Gossip of All the Studios\\". Photoplay. February 1928. Vol. XXXIII. No. 3. p. 88. Universal put over $1,000,000 into The Man Who Laughs, an extremely high budget for an American film of the time. =Style= =Music and sound= Films of the silent era were typically projected with musical accompaniment. Originally, the accompanying music varied not only by film but by venue, and often featured the performance of a live pianist or even, in larger theaters, a full orchestra. The first 30 years of the 20th century also saw the development of the photoplayer and the theatre organ, specialized instruments designed specifically for in-theater entertainment and to accompany silent film, which were installed in hundreds of theaters between 1900–1930, and which eventually usurped the solo pianist and orchestras in most places. But even up until the introduction of sound film, music was substandard or absent entirely in some locations. By the late 1920s, the major film studios had largely shifted to recorded music, synchronized with the film, and distributed along with it. The Man Who Laughs was initially released without music, but following the film's initial success, it was recalled and re-released with sound effects, a synchronized score, and a theme song, provided by the Movietone sound-on-film system. Leni did not employ the shrieking and creaking sound effects of horror theater (although he did in his following film, The Last Warning). Instead, the film's viewers are disconcerted by hearing the sounds of the crowds and audiences within the film (often laughing at or jeering Gwynplaine), while the main characters (including Gwynplaine himself) are left entirely silent. The film's theme song, \\"When Love Comes Stealing\\", was an Ernö Rapée instrumental piece previously used for some showings of the 1922 film Robin Hood, but with added lyrics by Walter Hirsch and Lew Pollack. The remainder of the score comprises music by William Axt, Sam Perry, and Rapée, and one piece by Gustav Borch, which was later reused in the 1932 zombie film White Zombie. Some of the score, such as the fast-paced melodramatic music used for the chase scene near the end of the film, contrasts sharply with the romantic \\"When Love Comes Stealing\\". This effect, although jarring, was probably intentional in order to make the theme song more memorable and encourage sheet music sales. Release =Theatrical release= The film premiered April 27, 1928, in New York, with two showings per day at the Central Theatre. Proceeds from opening night were donated to the American Friends of Blérancourt, a humanitarian aid organization. According to Universal's house organ, The Gold Mine, these limited showings continued at least into May. Also in May, the film had its London premiere, at a trade show at the London Pavilion Theatre on the 2nd. =Home media= For many years, the film was not publicly available. In the 1960s, The Man Who Laughs was among the films preserved by the Library of Congress following a donation from the American Film Institute; along with 22 other such films, it was shown at the New York Film Festival in 1969. It was again screened by Peter Bogdanovich at the Telluride Film Festival in 1998, but remained largely unavailable until Kino International and the Cineteca di Bologna produced a restored version of the film made from two American prints and an Italian print. This restoration was released on DVD by Kino on September 30, 2003. Slant Magazine gave this DVD 3.5 out of 5 stars, citing the overall quality of the restoration and the uniqueness of the included extras, including a home movie of Veidt. Kino included this DVD in their five-volume American Silent Horror Collection box set on October 9, 2007. Sunrise Silents also produced a DVD of the film, edited to a slightly longer runtime than the Kino restoration, released in October 2004. The Man Who Laughs was released on Blu-ray on June 4, 2019, sourced from a new 4K restoration, and features a score performed by the Berklee College of Music.Review. Blu-ray.com. June 20, 2019. Critical reception =Contemporary= Initially, the critical assessment of The Man Who Laughs was mediocre, with some critics disliking the morbidity of the subject matter and others complaining that the Germanic looking sets did not evoke 17th- century England. Paul Rotha was particularly critical. In his 1930 history of film, The Film Till Now, he called The Man Who Laughs a \\"travesty of cinematic methods\\", and declared that in directing it, Leni \\"became slack, drivelling, slovenly, and lost all sense of decoration, cinema, and artistry\\". The New York Times gave the film a slightly positive review, calling it \\"gruesome but interesting, and one of the few samples of pictorial work in which there is no handsome leading man\\". =Modern= As late as the 1970s, critical assessment of the film was largely negative. Writing for Film Quarterly after the New York Film Festival showing, Richard Koszarski described it as \\"overblown\\" and a \\"stylistic mishmash\\". In recent times, the assessment has been more positive. Critic Roger Ebert gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, declaring it \\"one of the final treasures of German silent Expressionism.\\" Film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film 3 out of a possible 4 stars, stating that the film was \\"visually dazzling\\". Kevin Thomas from The Los Angeles Times praised the film, declaring it to be director Leni's masterpiece, writing \\" In Leni it found its perfect director, for his bravura Expressionist style lifts this tempestuous tale above the level of tear-jerker to genuinely stirring experience.\\" Dennis Schwartz of Ozus' World Movie Reviews rated the film a grade A, praising Veidt's performance as \\"one of cinema's most sensitive and moving performances\\". Eric Henderson from Slant Magazine gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, offering similar praise towards Veidt's performance, as well as the film's cinematography. It is among the films with a 100% rating at review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 14 reviews. Legacy The Man Who Laughs had considerable influence on the later Universal Classic Monsters films. Pierce continued to provide the makeup for Universal's monsters; comparisons to Gwynplaine's grin was used to advertise The Raven. Hall's set design for The Man Who Laughs helped him develop the blend of Gothic and expressionist features he employed for some of the most important Universal horror films of the 1930s: Dracula, Frankenstein, The Old Dark House, The Invisible Man, The Black Cat, and Bride of Frankenstein. Decades later, the themes and style of The Man Who Laughs were influences on Brian De Palma's 2006 The Black Dahlia, which incorporates some footage from the 1928 film. The Joker's distinctive grin, seen here in art by alt=A green-haired man with a distended grin holds a joker playing card The Joker, nemesis to DC Comics's Batman, owes his appearance to Veidt's portrayal of Gwynplaine in The Man Who Laughs. Although Bill Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson disagreed as their respective roles in the 1940 creation of the Joker, they agreed that his exaggerated smile was influenced by a photograph of Veidt from the film. Heath Ledger's portrayal of the character in the 2008 film The Dark Knight (which was released 80 years later) makes this connection even more direct by depicting the Joker's smile as the result of disfiguring scarring rather than an expression of his insanity. A 2005 graphic novel exploring the first encounter between Batman and the Joker was also titled Batman: The Man Who Laughs in homage to the 1928 film. =Later adaptations= Although prominent actors, including Christopher Lee and Kirk Douglas, expressed interest in taking the role of Gwynplaine in a hypothetical remake, there has been no American film adaptation of The Man Who Laughs in the sound era; however, there have been three adaptations by European directors. Italian director Sergio Corbucci's 1966 version, L'Uomo che ride (released in the United States as The Man Who Laughs, but in France as L'Imposture des Borgia) substantially altered the plot and setting, placing the events in Italy and replacing the court of King James II with that of the House of Borgia. Jean Kerchbron directed a three-part French television film adaptation, L'Homme qui rit, in 1971. Philippe Bouclet and Delphine Desyeux star as Gwynplaine and Dea; Philippe Clay appeared as Barkilphedro. Jean-Pierre Améris directed another French-language version, also called L'Homme qui rit, which was released in 2012. It stars Marc-André Grondin and Christa Théret, with Gérard Depardieu as Ursus. Horror-film historian Wheeler Winston Dixon described the 1961 film Mr. Sardonicus, also featuring a character with a horrifying grin, as \\"The Man Who Laughs ... remade, after a fashion\\". However, its director, William Castle, has stated the film is an adaptation of \\"Sardonicus\\", an unrelated short story by Ray Russell originally appearing in Playboy.

Wenninger OSB (October 31, 1919Banchoff (2002)– February 17, 2017) was an American mathematician who worked on constructing polyhedron models, and wrote the first book on their construction. Early life and education Born to German immigrants in Park Falls, Wisconsin, Joseph Wenninger always knew he was going to be a priest. From an early age, it was understood that his brother Heinie would take after their father and become a baker, and that Joe, as he was then known, would go into the priesthood. When Wenninger was thirteen, after graduating from the parochial school in Park Falls, Wisconsin, his parents saw an advertisement in the German newspaper Der Wanderer that would help to shape the rest of his life. The ad was for a preparatory school in Collegeville, Minnesota, associated with the Benedictine St. John's University. While admitting to feeling homesick at first, Wenninger quickly made friends and, after a year, knew that this was where he needed to be. He was a student in a section of the prep school that functioned as a \\"minor seminary\\" – later moving on into St. John's where he studied philosophy and theology, which led into the priesthood. Career An artistic model created by Father Wenninger called Order in Chaos, representing a chiral subset of triangles of a 16-frequency icosahedral geodesic sphere When Fr. Wenninger became a Benedictine monk, he took on his monastic name Magnus, meaning \\"Great\\". At the start of his career, Wenninger did not set out on a path one might expect would lead to his becoming the great polyhedronist that he is known as today. Rather, a few chance happenings and seemingly minor decisions shaped a course for Wenninger that led to his groundbreaking studies. Shortly after becoming a priest, Wenninger's Abbot informed him that their order was starting up a school in the Bahamas. It was decided that Wenninger would be assigned to teach at that school. In order to do this, it was necessary that he get a master's degree. Wenninger was sent to the University of Ottawa, in Canada, to study educational psychology. There he studied symbolic logic under Thomas Greenwood of the philosophy department. His thesis title was \\"The Concept of Number According to Roger Bacon and Albert the Great\\". After completing his degree, Wenninger went to the school in the Bahamas, where he was asked by the headmaster to choose between teaching English or math. Wenninger chose math, since it seemed to be more in line with the topic of his MA thesis. However, not having taken many math courses in college, Wenninger admits to being able to teach by staying a few pages ahead of the students. He taught Algebra, Euclidean Geometry, Trigonometry and Analytic Geometry. After ten years of teaching, Wenninger felt he was becoming a bit stale. At the suggestion of his headmaster, Wenninger attended the Columbia Teachers College in summer sessions over a four-year period in the late fifties. It was here that his interest in the \\"New Math\\" was formed and his studies of the polyhedra began. Wenninger died at the age of 97, at St John's Abbey on Friday, February 17, 2017.Obituary for Fr. Magnus Wenninger, OSB Monk of Saint John's Abbey Collegeville, MinnesotaBenedictine monk known for his math contributions dies Saint Cloud Times, Feb. 20, 2017 Publications Wenninger's first publication on the topic of polyhedra was the booklet entitled, \\"Polyhedron Models for the Classroom\\", which he wrote in 1966. He wrote to H. S. M. Coxeter and received a copy of Uniform polyhedra which had a complete list of all 75 uniform polyhedra. After this, he spent a great deal of time building various polyhedra. He made 65 of them and had them on display in his classroom. At this point, Wenninger decided to contact a publisher to see if there was any interest in a book. He had the models photographed and wrote the accompanying text, which he sent off to Cambridge University Press in London. The publishers indicated an interest in the book only if Wenninger built all 75 of the uniform polyhedra. Wenninger did complete the models, with the help of R. Buckley of Oxford University who had done the calculations for the snub forms by computer. This allowed Wenninger to build these difficult polyhedra with the exact measurements for lengths of the edges and shapes of the faces. This was the first time that all of the uniform polyhedra had been made as paper models. This project took Wenninger nearly ten years, and the book, Polyhedron Models, was published by the Cambridge University Press in 1971, largely due to the exceptional photographs taken locally in Nassau. From 1971 onward, Wenninger focused his attention on the projection of the uniform polyhedra onto the surface of their circumscribing spheres. This led to the publication of his second book, Spherical Models in 1979, showing how regular and semiregular polyhedra can be used to build geodesic domes. He also exchanged ideas with other mathematicians, Hugo Verheyen and Gilbert Fleurent. In 1981, Wenninger left the Bahamas and returned to St. John's Abbey. His third book, Dual Models, appeared in 1983. The book is a sequel to Polyhedron Models, since it includes instructions on how to make paper models of the duals of all 75 uniform polyhedra.

This subfamily includes many species of moths that have a pointed and barbed proboscis adapted to piercing the skins of fruit to feed on juice, and in the case of the several Calyptra species of vampire moths, to piercing the skins of mammals to feed on blood. The subfamily contains some large moths with wingspans longer than 5 cm (2 in). Taxonomy Recent phylogenetic studies have greatly revised this subfamily. The subfamily was previously classified within the Noctuidae, but the redefinition of that family has reclassified many of that family's subfamilies, including Calpinae, into the family Erebidae. The Calpinae are most closely related to a clade including the subfamilies Eulepidotinae and Hypocalinae, which are also among the Erebidae. The tribes Anomini and Scoliopterygini, previously included in the Calpinae, were found to be distantly related and were reclassified into a separate subfamily as the Scoliopteryginae. =Tribes= The Calpinae consist of three monophyletic tribes. *Calpini *Ophiderini *Phyllodini =Previous taxonomy= The status of the former composition of the Calpinae was somewhat disputed; it was sometimes merged into the Catocalinae.

Note that the amoeba is actually 3-dimensional, and not a surface (this is not entirely evident from the image). In complex analysis, a branch of mathematics, an amoeba is a set associated with a polynomial in one or more complex variables. Amoebas have applications in algebraic geometry, especially tropical geometry. Definition Consider the function : \\\\operatorname{Log}: \\\\big({\\\\mathbb C} \\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}\\\\big)^n \\\\to \\\\mathbb R^n defined on the set of all n-tuples z = (z_1, z_2, \\\\dots, z_n) of non-zero complex numbers with values in the Euclidean space \\\\mathbb R^n, given by the formula : \\\\operatorname{Log}(z_1, z_2, \\\\dots, z_n) = \\\\big(\\\\logz_1, \\\\logz_2, \\\\dots, \\\\logz_n\\\\big). Here, log denotes the natural logarithm. If p(z) is a polynomial in n complex variables, its amoeba \\\\mathcal A_p is defined as the image of the set of zeros of p under Log, so : \\\\mathcal A_p = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\operatorname{Log}(z) : z \\\\in \\\\big(\\\\mathbb C \\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}\\\\big)^n, p(z) = 0\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. Amoebas were introduced in 1994 in a book by Gelfand, Kapranov, and Zelevinsky. Properties * Any amoeba is a closed set. * Any connected component of the complement \\\\mathbb R^n \\\\setminus \\\\mathcal A_p is convex.Itenberg et al (2007) p. 3. * The area of an amoeba of a not identically zero polynomial in two complex variables is finite. * A two-dimensional amoeba has a number of \\"tentacles\\", which are infinitely long and exponentially narrow towards infinity. Ronkin function A useful tool in studying amoebas is the Ronkin function. For p(z), a polynomial in n complex variables, one defines the Ronkin function : N_p : \\\\mathbb R^n \\\\to \\\\mathbb R by the formula : N_p(x) = \\\\frac{1}{(2\\\\pi i)^n} \\\\int_{\\\\operatorname{Log}^{-1}(x)} \\\\logp(z) \\\\,\\\\frac{dz_1}{z_1} \\\\wedge \\\\frac{dz_2}{z_2} \\\\wedge \\\\cdots \\\\wedge \\\\frac{dz_n}{z_n}, where x denotes x = (x_1, x_2, \\\\dots, x_n). Equivalently, N_p is given by the integral : N_p(x) = \\\\frac{1}{(2\\\\pi)^n} \\\\int_{[0, 2\\\\pi]^n} \\\\logp(z) \\\\,d\\\\theta_1 \\\\,d\\\\theta_2 \\\\cdots d\\\\theta_n, where : z = \\\\left(e^{x_1+i\\\\theta_1}, e^{x_2+i\\\\theta_2}, \\\\dots, e^{x_n+i\\\\theta_n}\\\\right). The Ronkin function is convex and affine on each connected component of the complement of the amoeba of p(z). As an example, the Ronkin function of a monomial : p(z) = a z_1^{k_1} z_2^{k_2} \\\\dots z_n^{k_n} with a e 0 is : N_p(x) = \\\\loga + k_1 x_1 + k_2 x_2 + \\\\cdots + k_n x_n. References  .

The Worimi's lands extended over according to Norman Tindale, who specified that the tribal area encompassed the Hunter River to the coastal town of Forster near Cape Hawke. It reached Port Stephens and ran inland as far as roughly Gresford and in proximity of Glendon Brook, Dungog, and the upper Myall Creek. To the south, their territory extended to Maitland. Social organization The Worimi were divided into 4 bands. * Garuagal. (the country adjoining Teleghery Creek and along the lower Hunter. * Maiangal. (sea-shore south of Port Stephens, inland to Teleghery Creek.) * Gamipingal. (northern side of Port Stephens, left bank of Karuah.) * Buraigal. (right bank of the Karuah up to Stroud) History of contact with British colonists The Australian Agricultural Company was established upon an act of the British Parliament in 1824. The aim of the legislation was to further the cultivation and improvement of what it termed 'waste land' in the colony of New South Wales. In January 1826, a company agent, Robert Dawson (1782–1866), set up camp near the shoreline at Port Stephens. He confined his settlement activities to the coast, with farms on Stroud creek, outposts on the Manning River, stock-mistering in Gloucester Vale. Despite good reports, according to a modern historian, Dawson's numerous improvements, were judged inadequate and the area around Port Stephen was seen as disappointing, with useless outskirts, the central zone rocky, steep and the Gloucester flats water- logged: sheep suffered from foot-rot. The Company wanted to push beyond the hills that hemmed the settlement in, and Dawson was dismissed for mismanagement and replaced by the Arctic explorer, William Parry. Dawson himself soon after published a vindication, and then a glowing account of the area, together with an account of the Worimi. He found the Worimi a 'mild and harmless race', and attributed any harm they might cause to the maltreatment they received from settlers, who elsewhere had been shooting them like dogs. Of the situation around Port Stephens, he wrote: > There has, perhaps, been more of this done near to this settlement, and on > the banks of the two rivers which empty themselves into this harbor, than in > any other part of the colony; and it has arisen from the speculators in > timber..The natives complained to me frequently, that 'white pellow' (white > fellows) shot their relations and friends; and showed me many orphans, whose > parents had fallen by the hands of white men, near this spot. The pointed > out one white man, on his coming to beg some provisions for his party up the > river Karuah, who, they said, had killed ten;: and the wretch did not deny > it, but said he would kill them whenever he could. It was well for him that > he had no white man to depose to the facts, or I would have had him off to > jail at once.' Lifestyle The Worimi fostered, cared for and lived on resources found within their country. Marine food, especially shell-fish were favoured by people living closest to the sea. Due to the reliability of this resource it may have been preferred over land animals and vegetables. The latter two were used as supplementary foods and added variety to their diet. Animals that were abundant included kangaroos and goannas, possums, snakes and flying foxes. Vegetables eaten included fern roots, stalks of the Gymea lily, and the bloom of the banksia. Modern period Today the Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council is working closely with Worimi descendants to provide opportunities that promote, foster and protect the culture and heritage. In July 2016, the New South Wales government recognized of the suburb of as a place of historical value for Aboriginal people, noting the particular importance in cultural and spiritual terms that it held for the Worimi.

It is an example of neoclassical architecture, a combination of Ionic and Corinthian styles. The Ripon Building is an all-white structure and is located near the Puratchi Thalaivar Dr. M.G. Ramachandran Central Railway Station. History Commissioned in the year 1913, Ripon Building was designed by G.T.S. Harris. It was built by Loganatha Mudaliar, and took four years to build at a cost of 750,000, including a sum of 550,000 paid to Mudaliar. The Ripon building was named after Lord Ripon, Governor-General of British India and the Father of local self-government. Earl of Minto, the then Viceroy and Governor General of India laid the foundation on 12 December 1909. The Municipal Corporation of Madras, after functioning from several other places including Errabalu Chetty Street, settled at Ripon building in 1913, with P. L. Moore as the President of the Municipal Corporation at the time of the inauguration. The inaugural function was attended by over 3,000 of the city's elite. Building details Panorama of the Ripon Building The building is rectangular, long and wide, with a high central tower containing a clock in diameter. The first of its three floors has approximately of space. The walls were constructed with stock bricks, set and plastered with lime mortar and the roof is supported with teak wood joists. The original flooring of the ground floor was Cuddapah Slate that has been replaced with marble. One of the main attractions of the building is the Westminster Quarter chiming clock. This was installed by Oakes and Co. in 1913. The clock has a mechanical key system, which is wound every day. There are four bells, which were cast by Gillet and Johnston in 1913. Annexe building To the rear of the main building is an annexe building (American English: \\"annex\\"), inaugurated in September 2015 under the name \\"Amma Maaligai\\". All departments of the Chennai Corporation, except the offices of the Mayor and Commissioner, function from the annexe building. The offices of the Mayor and the Commissioner offices are in the main building. The annexe building was constructed at a cost of 230 million and has a built-up area of 150,000 sq. ft. and a parking space for 50 cars and 150 motorcycles. The building, built with aspects of a green building, could accommodate about 1,000 officials. The building also features a 500-seat auditorium, a 100-seat conference hall and 70 toilets with facilities for disabled people. The building has been able to reduce energy consumption by 20 percent by means of a water-cooled air-conditioning system and heat-reflective tiles on the roof. The building has been designed in a post-modern style, with some elements of traditional architecture. Some design elements would suit the colonial-style architecture of the Ripon Buildings. Restoration In 2012, a massive renovation was initiated at a cost of 77 million under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), to preserve the building's original grandeur. Under this, an annexe building measuring 12,540 sq m will be constructed alongside the main structure to house all the departments of the Corporation, and all structures in the premises that do not blend in with the main structure aesthetically will be demolished in June 2013 when the annexe building is completed. The annexe building, with an auditorium to seat 500 persons, will be built in a contemporary and post-modern style, highlighting with elements of regional architecture, to blend with the Indo- Saracenic style of the main building. The main building is also being renovated under the process with the use of lime mortar for plastering. It is the first heritage building in the country to have received funds from JNNURM for renovation.

Episode #1 debuted on April 23, 2007 on G4techTV Canada and HOW TO Channel Australia. The program was produced by Greedy Productions in Vancouver, BC. Production was overseen by the show's producer(s), Matt Harris (ep.1-180) and Marc Lefebvre (ep. 181-195). The show also aired on Citytv after Rogers Media acquired control of the stations, and episode segments were also posted to Google Video several weeks after initial airing. History On November 25, 2006, Leo Laporte announced on his KFI radio show that production of Call for Help would move from Toronto to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Rogers Communications, the owner of G4techTV Canada, contracted with Greedy Productions to produce the show. Laporte also announced that the show would be renamed The Lab with Leo Laporte and would be recorded in 16:9 High Definition (HD). The Lab was titled as such due to Call for Help and its trademarks remaining the property of the American G4 network and their corporate owner, Comcast, which had broken off contract talks with Laporte acrimoniously when the May 2004 purchase of the network was announced. Laporte traveled to Vancouver from his home in Petaluma, California monthly to record 15 episodes of the show. Episodes were typically recorded from Tuesday through Friday of the four-day \\"shoot week.\\" Four shows were recorded live to XDCAM HD disc Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday; three episodes were recorded on Friday. One goal of recording in HD was to attract a U.S.-based distributor. The American G4 ran the series for a short four-month period in 2007, but intentionally hampered it by airing it in a mid-morning timeslot without any later runs, meaning most of the show's audience was at work. On March 6, 2008, Leo Laporte announced on net@Nite #46 and via Twitter.com that Rogers had canceled The Lab after 195 episodes. He announced that as a result, he would be \\"ramping up video production from TWiT\\", his Petaluma-based netcast network of programming.Leo Laporte's official Twitter.com account \\"Rogers just canceled The Lab - reruns will continue until the end of the decade. I'll be ramping up video production from TWiT now.\\" The last episode of The Lab aired on August 1, 2008. Despite the severe aging of the episodes and the content within which does not apply to technology past Windows Vista or the original iPhone, G4 Canada continued to run the series in repeats on weekday mornings until the channel's shutdown on August 31, 2017, as the Canadian-based production helped the network both meet Canadian content guidelines and the bare requirements of the technology remit required by their Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission operating agreement. The How-To Channel in Australia chose not to air the remaining episodes Lab with Leo off TV in Australia - Let us See the Remaining Episodes citing a lack of viewers, which is necessary to sustain airing the final episodes.Response from How-To Channel Australia Regarding The Lab with Leo In late April the following note was posted on their official site: *Please note that production on the show has ceased. We are no longer accepting tech question submissions or replying to general info emails.*Show production ceased message Segments The show focused on answering viewers' technology related questions that had been submitted via the show's website. During each show, as many as four callers asked Laporte for solutions, on-air, to their technology questions. Questions were chosen by Laporte in advance of show taping, and callers appeared on the show via telephone (audio) and via Skype (video) simultaneously. Kate Abraham, call coordinator (ep.1-180), scheduled the callers and introduced them to Laporte during the show; Abraham also appeared in several segments throughout the show's run. Briana McIvor replaced Abraham as the call coordinator for episodes 181-195. The Lab also featured guests who presented technology products and technology tips, demonstrated software, and discussed technology issues, such as Internet security, with Laporte. Among the regular guests on The Lab were tech personalities Steve Gibson, Alex Lindsay, Chris Pirillo, and Andy Walker. Walker, along with Amber MacArthur, was Laporte's co-host on the Toronto-based Call for Help; Pirillo was the show's host for part of its earlier U.S.-based run. Members of Vancouver's technology community, such as Rick Yaeger and Kris Krug, became regular guests on The Lab. Each show also included a number of regular features. Yewell's Jewels was a free-file segment presented by chase producer, Ryan Yewell. The featured files included utilities, productivity tools, and entertainment software. Yewell also scheduled the guests that appeared on the show. Another regular feature was What the Tech? which served as a transition into and out of one of the show's commercial breaks. What the Tech? invited viewers to identify the subject of a close-up photograph of technology. Content producer Sean Carruthers created the segment and took the photographs used. Carruthers was also an on-air presence whom Laporte queried for additional suggestions regarding caller questions. In addition, Carruthers developed a regular segment entitled Sean's Shinies during which he demonstrated an interesting/unique tech product. One feature that served as a commercial transition was the Quick Quiz Question, a multiple-choice technology trivia game that occasionally had errors that made it to air.

Porter, founded the online discount stock brokerage firm, E*TRADE. Newcomb is legally blind. Early life Newcomb grew up in Scio, Oregon. He is the middle child of Lyle and Agnes Newcomb. Born with congenital cataracts, Newcomb has always been legally blind. He attended the Oregon School for the Blind from kindergarten through second grade, having to board during the week and return home on weekends. He attended public schools in Scio through high school where he graduated as class valedictorian. Newcomb was the first in his family to attend college as a business major at Oregon State University and consistently made dean's list and graduated third in his class in the College of Business. Newcomb received his B.A. in Business Administration from Oregon State University in 1965. He is a member of the Delta Sigma Phi fraternity. Upon graduation, he found that accounting firms and banks did not consider him employable because of his blindness. His college counselor persuaded General Electric to hire Newcomb in their data processing department at the Hanford Project in Richland, Washington, where he was employed for three years. Creation of E*TRADE In 1980, in Palo Alto, California, Newcomb met Bill Porter who had recently purchased an Apple II computer with the idea that a personal computer could be used to buy and sell stock, but having no means of accessing the necessary information with his modem. During the conversation, Porter convinced Newcomb to become partners and create a company that would enable an individual with a personal computer to trade stocks from home—to disintermediate stock buying. Newcomb's role was to develop the programming for the project. In 1992, PC Magazine featured Trade*Plus on its cover. In 1992, The San Jose Business Journal named Trade*Plus the year's fastest-growing private company in Silicon Valley. In 1996, Trade*Plus was renamed E*TRADE Group and went public. Newcomb was incentivized to retire soon after and established a philanthropic foundation, the Bernard A. Newcomb Foundation. Later work and charities In 1997, Newcomb gave Oregon State University the largest stock gift in its history: $6.1 million in stock from the company he helped found and created four new endowments to directly benefit students and academic programs in the College of Business. Each year he meets with the winners of the scholarship that bears his name. Additionally, after Weatherford Hall underwent $20 million in renovations in 2004, the cyber cafe was named Bing's as a reference to his childhood nickname. Newcomb co-launched ITXS, an auction site for second-hand IT-related items, with Herb Swanson and Mike Symons in 2000. Newcomb was awarded with the Helen Keller Achievement Award by the American Foundation for the Blind in 2006 for his work to improve the quality of life of the blind. In 2005 Newcomb donated $5 million to the Peninsula Community Foundation. The Foundation later merged with Community Foundation Silicon Valley to become the Silicon Valley Community Foundation. Newcomb has also donated to Scio High School, Scio, Oregon, in support of its sport programs, specifically football. In 2000, he and his family donated $1.3 million to build a football field, track, stadium (including locker rooms, a weight room, and wrestling room), and parking lot. In 2013, Newcomb donated another $850,000 of the total $1.3 million project cost for the purchase and installation of new artificial turf at the stadium. Newcomb is also a supporter of the Castilleja School, most recently donating to the renovation of its Gunn Administration Building; the 2nd floor Newcomb Board/Conference Room is named in his honor. Personal life On September 11, 1999, Newcomb married Carol J. Kearney in Bend, Oregon. They later divorced on June 26, 2001. He has no children. Newcomb lives a quiet life, residing in Palo Alto with his girlfriend, Gerry.

(b. 22 August 1723 Geneva, Republic of Geneva - d. 4 May 1786 East Barnet, England) was a Genevan-born British soldier who served in the Seven Years' War and the American War of Independence. Prévost was born to a family that was originally from Bossy near Geneva and settled in Geneva in the 14th century.Prévost (Prevost) (GE), in the Historical Dictionary of Switzerland. Seven Years War Like his younger brother Mark Prevost, Prévost joined the 60th (Royal American) Regiment of Foot as a major on 9 January 1756 at the regiment's establishment. He fought in the French and Indian War, during which he suffered a wound. In 1763 he briefly acted as the interim military Governor of West Florida. American War of Independence By the summer of 1776, Prévost, then a colonel, was in charge of a contingent of the 60th stationed in St. Augustine, the capital of British East Florida. In the winter of 1778, following a proposal of Lord George Germain, Prévost, now a brigadier-general, was given orders by General Sir Henry Clinton to invade Georgia. Prévost dispatched two units north: one under the command of lieutenant-colonel Lewis V. Fuser and the other under his younger brother Mark. Prévost arrived at Savannah, Georgia, on 17 January 1779 which was protected by British Lieutenant-Colonel Archibald Campbell. Prévost assumed command but also sent the message to General Clinton that he wished to resign, believing that a younger man should take his place. His forces launched an unsuccessful raid against Charles Town, South Carolina, whose indiscriminate looting antagonized ally and enemy alike. The major engagement of the affair was the Battle of Stono Creek, a British victory. In September 1779 Brigadier General George Garth was sent to replace him, travelling from New York on HMS Experiment. Garth was, however, captured before he could reach Savannah and Prévost remained to defend the town from a combined French and Continental force in an action that came to be known as the Siege of Savannah.  Family  Augustine was married to Anette (Ann) Grand and father of Sir George Prévost, and of Major Augustine Prevost (b. 29 August 1744 Geneva – d. 17 January 1821 Greenville, NY). Major Prevost retired to manage his wife's family estate (Croghan Estates) and died as a citizen of the United States. Descendants of Prévost settled in the United States and Peru.

They are not-for-profit, mutual funds which are membership-based and do not have shareholders. The main difference between industry super funds and retail super funds (or wholesale master trusts), which are public offer funds managed by financial institutions, is what happens with the profits. Retail funds distribute profits to shareholders or investors (the trustees of the fund), while industry funds return profits to members. Industry Super Australia (ISA) is \\"a research and advocacy body for Industry SuperFunds\\", the peak body of the industry. From 1 July 2005, choice of fund rules came into effect, giving most Australian employees the option to choose the fund into which their employers paid their superannuation contributions. In practice, over 75% of workers remained with their employer’s default fund, which is usually an industry superannuation fund. From this time, industry super funds were also no longer required to be industry-specific, and most became open to membership by a majority of Australian workers. Such open funds are called public offer funds. Since 1 January 2014, employers must pay all default super guarantee contributions (minimum employer contributions) into approved MySuper accounts, unless an employee has chosen their own investment option. otherwise. The Fair Work Commission determines which superannuation funds are suitable to be industry super funds and adopted by employers as default funds. History of industry super funds Prior to 1992, superannuation was common, however there existed no national legislative requirement for employers to pay superannuation for their employees. Instead, industrial awards negotiated by the union movement provided for businesses to contribute to superannuation funds for and on behalf of their staff. This system was not uniform, and superannuation policies were tied to individual awards, which differed from industry to industry. In 1992, the Keating Labor government introduced a compulsory ‘Superannuation Guarantee’ system as part of a major reform package to help relieve the growing burden on the taxpayer-funded government pension scheme. The change came about through a tripartite agreement between the government, employers and the trade unions. The trade unions agreed to forgo a national 3% pay increase which would be put into the new superannuation system for all employees in Australia. This was matched by employers' contributions which were set to increase over time. Both union and employer organisations were keen to ensure that money invested into superannuation would be protected from high fees and commission products. This led to the establishment of trade union-based industry super funds, in competition to the established retail funds. Today Today, industry funds are non-profit mutual funds with over 13 million accounts. Industry super funds have policies designed for the benefit of members, and governed by trustees representing employers and employees within the industry. , ISA members are: * AustralianSuper * CareSuper * Cbus * Energy Super * FIRSTSuper * HESTA * HOSTPLUS * legalsuper * LUCRF Super * Media Super * MTAA Super * NGS Super * REISuper * TWUSUPER * Sunsuper Other well-known funds include: * First State Super * REST Industry Super * UniSuper ME Bank is owned by 26 industry super funds. ME Bank obtained an Australian banking licence in July 2001 and was approved by APRA to act as an authorised deposit-taking institution, authorised to accept deposits from the public. Industry Super Australia Industry Super Australia (ISA) is \\"a research and advocacy body for Industry SuperFunds\\", which aims to make the most of the retirement savings of the individual members of its member funds. It is a peak body for the industry superannuation sector. ISA has 15 members, including AustralianSuper, Hostplus and Cbus, all of which are not-for-profit industry super funds. The funds that are members of ISA hold about five million accounts. the Board of ISA comprises twelve members, including representatives from industry super funds, former state and federal ministers, ACTU Secretary Sally McManus, and others, under Chair Greg Combet.  Advertising campaigns  ISA manages collective projects on behalf of fifteen industry super funds, including research, policy development, government relations and advocacy, as well as coordinating the Industry SuperFunds Joint Marketing Campaign. The Campaign is responsible for a number of prominent advertising and marketing campaigns on behalf of its membership including the long-running “Compare the Pair” television and press campaign, which has run multiple iterations over many years, has achieved household recognition throughout Australia. The campaign is currently in its 3rd generation. The \\"From little things\\" campaign used Paul Kelly and Kev Carmody's song \\"From Little Things, Big Things Grow\\" from September 2009 until the end of 2014. After that, the Ben Lee song \\"We're All in This Together\\" would be used. =Consolidation of accounts= In September 2018 Industry Super Australia arranged a deal by 19 industry super funds to consolidate superannuation accounts of all of their members. Involving half a million inactive accounts containing few funds, it may save members its members around a year in what they would otherwise pay in fees and life insurance premiums. All members of ISA, as well as REST, Equipsuper and First State Super have signed up to the deal. All inactive accounts containing less than are now automatically rolled into a central pool, managed by a specialist fund called AUSFund. If any active accounts exist for the member in question with any of the funds, the money in the inactive account is automatically transferred into that fund. = Submissions and representations = Since ISA’s inception, it has made submissions to government on a number of superannuation-related topics including: * The Murray Inquiry (2014) into Australia’s financial systems, with particular reference to superannuation * The Cooper Review (2010) into the superannuation system and regulatory improvements Dead Link * The Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs covering the proposed tightening of pension eligibility Obfuscated by Age * The Trowbridge Review into potential conflicted remuneration and its effect on life insurance advice Dead Link * The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Systems Inquiry * The Senate Economics Legislation Committee (2013) review for streamlining the Future of Financial Advice Bill. Obfuscated by Age Retail super funds The four major banks in Australia and other financial institutions own the majority of for-profit retail super funds and have been lobbying governments for legislative changes to de-regulate the process traditionally used to nominate workplace default funds and make it easier for employers to adopt a bank-owned fund. The Federal Abbott government has committed to opening up the default fund section system suggesting that doing so will generate greater competition. As at July 2018, the major retail super funds were: *AMP Flexible Super *Bendigo Smart Start Super (Bendigo Bank) *BT Super For Life (Westpac) *ING DIRECT Living Super (ING Australia). In December 2015, ING had AU$1.6 billion in super funds under management, with 34,000 active superannuation accounts in 2014. *MLC Masterkey Super (National Australia Bank) * Colonial First State (Commonwealth Bank) *OnePath (ANZ Bank) *Suncorp Everyday Super (Suncorp) Testimony at the Hayne Royal Commission has spotlighted the actual and potential conflict of interest with bank-owned retail super funds, (for example, advisors being required to recommend bank financial products to members, which may not be in the best interest of the membersThe Age, 22 September 2018, Everything you need to know about the royal commission so far) and several banks have commenced processes to dispose of their wealth management divisions.

In 1947, as India gained independence from the British Empire, the level of agriculture mechanisation was low. The socialist oriented five-year plans of the 1950s and 1960s aggressively promoted rural mechanisation via joint ventures and tie-ups between local industrialists and international tractor manufacturers. Despite these efforts, the first three decades after independence local production of 4-wheel tractors grew slowly. By the late 1980s tractor production was nearly 140,000 units per year, and a prevalence rate of less than 2 per 1,000 farmers. After economic reforms of 1991, the pace of change increased and by late 1990s with production approached 270,000 per year. In early 2000s, India overtook the United States as the world's largest producer of four-wheel tractors. FAO estimated, in 1999, that of total agricultural area in India, less than 50% is under mechanised land preparation, indicating large opportunities still exist for agricultural mechanisation.The following annotated time line borrows exclusively from a presentation by Gajendra Singh's presentation at the Tropical Agricultural Association et al. November 1999 conference \\"The Tractor Factor - Ploughing a road out of poverty\\" and whose full presentation be found at In 2013, India produced 619,000 tractors accounting for 29% of world's output, as the world's largest producer and market for tractors. India currently has 16 domestic and 4 multinational corporations manufacturing tractors. History of tractors in India =1945 to 1960= War surplus tractors and bulldozers were imported for land reclamation and cultivation in mid-1940s. In 1947 central and state tractor organisations were set up to develop and promote the supply and use of tractors in agriculture and up to 1960, the demand was met entirely through imports. There were 8,500 tractors in use in 1951, 20,000 in 1955 and 37,000 by 1960. =1960 - 1970= By 1970 annual production had exceeded 20,000 units with over 146,000 units working in the country. =1971 to 1980= By late 60's the government of India initiated the Green Revolution in India program and the need for mechanisation created more demands for farm tractors.To meet the initial demand the Government allowed lot of imports mostly from USSR and its Eastern Bloc neighbours. In addition six new manufacturers were established during this period although three companies (Kirloskar Tractors, Harsha Tractors and Pittie Tractors) did not survive. HMT, a large public sector unit, began manufacturing Agricultural Tractors in 1972 under the HMT brand name with technology acquired from Zetor of the Czech Republic. Escorts Ltd. began local manufacture of Ford tractors in 1971 in collaboration with Ford, UK and total production climbed steadily to 33,000 in 1975-76 =1981 to 1990= A further five manufacturers(Auto Tractors, Haryana Tractors, United Auto Tractors, Asian Tractors, VST Tillers) began production during this period but only Last one survived in the increasingly competitive market place. Annual production exceeded 75,000 units by 1985 and reached 140,000 in 1990 when the total in use was about 1.2 million. Then India - a net importer up to the mid-seventies - became an exporter in the 1980s mainly to countries in Africa. =1991 to 1997= Since 1992, it has not been necessary to obtain an industrial license for tractor manufacture in India. By 1997 annual production exceeded 255,000 units and the national tractor population had passed the two million mark. India now emerged as one of the world leaders in wheeled tractor production. =1997 to 1999= Five new manufacturers started production in this period. In 1998 Bajaj Tempo, later renamed Force Motors, began tractor production in Pune. In April of the same year New Holland Tractor (India) Ltd launched production of 70 hp tractors with matching equipment by investing $US 75 million in a state-of- the-art plant at Greater Noida in Uttar Pradesh state with an initial capacity of 35000 units per year. Also during this time, Larsen and Toubro established a joint venture with John Deere, USA for the manufacture of 35-65 hp tractors at a plant in Pune, Maharashtra. And Greeves Ltd began producing tractors under similar arrangements with Deutz-Fahr of Italy. CASE now Case IH looking to develop a joint venture in India went into discussions with various Indian companies and in 1999 settled with New Holland Pvt Ltd. India for manufacturing CASE brand tractors and harvesting equipment at New Holland's facility. =1999 to present= Facing market saturation in the traditional markets of the north west (Punjab, Haryana, Western Uttar Pradesh) tractors sales began a slow and slight decline. By 2002 sales went below 200,000. Manufacturers expanded into eastern and southern India markets in an attempt to reverse the decline, and began exploring the potential for overseas markets. In 2013, India produced 619,000 tractors accounting for 29% of world's output. It is the world's largest producer and market for tractors. India currently has 16 domestic and 4 multinational corporations manufacturing tractors. In 2014 Zetor come back in India and linked with the local tractor manufacture companies to supply 40 to 75 hp tractors on zetor brand name to other countries. Prevalence and market share Mahindra tractor has the largest share of Indian tractor market. * Prevalence:  Tractors are getting widespread acceptance in India.  Kotaks and ICRA reports estimate that nearly 4.3 million tractors were in operation, and 1 in 20 rural households owned a tractor in 2011. They project that the market will grow at 7% to 8% per year, and only 19% of Indian rural farming households that can afford a tractor have as yet purchased a unit.  Designs that allow multi-functional use, adapted to local needs and rural constraints, are experiencing higher demands. * Market Share:  Five companies account for over 80% of the market share  Mahindra and Mahindra (largest at 42.5% share)  TAFE with 20%  Rest * Escorts, * ITL-Sonalika * John Deere.INDIAN TRACTOR INDUSTRY ICRA, India (2012)Tractor industry flourishes amidst slowdown Current manufacturers of tractors in India =ACE Tractors= Action Construction Equipment Limited (ACE) began manufacturing of Tractors in 2009 by launching two models in 35 / 45 HP categories.

In 1965, the Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute (CMERI), Durgapur initiated design and development of Swaraj Tractor based on indigenous know how. That is how the idea for development of what was to become Swaraj was initiated. The first prototype was ready in May 1967 and by April 1970, field experience of over 1,500 hours had been gained. At that point, it was decided to christen a name for the product – signifying Indian, easy to pronounce and signifying power and grace. The name \`Swaraj', was approved by the then Prime Minister, Mrs Indira Gandhi. In 1970, the Government of Punjab acquired the Swaraj tractor's design and established Punjab Tractors Limited (PTL). The tractors were produced and sold under the brand name of Swaraj.

Production began in September 1981, but with severe supply problems and an outmoded product they only produced 2,380 tractors in their nearly ten years of existence. This was less than the projected production for the first two years alone. The company and assets were sold to automaker Sipani in 1991, who focused on producing diesel tractor engines (at over five times the rate of ATL themselves) but built some tractors as well.Bajaj, p.

Pittie Tractors indigenously developed and manufactured tractors and was well set to capture a large share of the market in India. However, due to an unfortunate labour strike at one of its critical vendors, followed by a similar strike at its own plant, the company lost nearly a year of production. As a result, the company fell into financial difficulty and ultimately had to wind-up operations. =United Auto Tractors Ltd.= Began in 1986 in conjunction with Uzina Tractorul of Romania.

From 2004 to 2014, he appeared on various Canadian television shows, including the business news programmes SqueezePlay and The Lang and O'Leary Exchange, as well as the reality television shows Dragons' Den and Redemption Inc. In 2008, he appeared on Discovery Channel's Project Earth. Since 2009, he has appeared on Shark Tank, the American version of Dragons' Den. O'Leary co-founded SoftKey Software Products, a technology company that sold software geared toward family education and entertainment. During the late 1980s and 1990s, SoftKey acquired rival companies such as Compton's New Media, The Learning Company, and Brøderbund. SoftKey later changed its name to The Learning Company and was acquired by Mattel in 1999, with the sale making O'Leary a multimillionaire. O'Leary was soon fired by Mattel after the acquisition resulted in significant losses and multiple shareholder lawsuits. In 2017, he campaigned to be the leader of the Conservative Party of Canada. He was a frontrunner in the polls during much of that time, but dropped out in April 2017, one month before the election, citing a lack of support in Quebec. Early life and education O'Leary was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, one of two sons of Georgette (née Bukalam), a small-business owner and investor of Lebanese descent, and Terry O'Leary, a salesman of Irish descent. Kevin's brother is Shane O'Leary.Allemang, John. \\"Kevin O'Leary: The shark who swims alone\\", The Globe and Mail, 23 September 2011.Schlesinger, Joel. \\"The dragon's pen: Reality TV villain writes about life and money in new autobiography\\", Winnipeg FreePress, 1 October 2011. Due to his paternal heritage, O'Leary also holds Irish citizenship and carries an Irish passport. O’Leary grew up in the Town of Mount Royal. His parents divorced when he was a child, largely due to his father's alcoholism. His father died shortly thereafter. After his father's death, his mother ran the business as an executive. His mother later married an economist, George Kanawaty, who worked with the UN's International Labour Organization. His stepfather's international assignments caused the family to move frequently, and O'Leary lived in many places while growing up, including Cambodia, Tunisia, and Cyprus. O'Leary attended Stanstead College and St. George's School, both in Quebec. O'Leary's mother was a skilled investor, investing a third of her weekly paycheque in large-cap, dividend-paying stocks and interest-bearing bonds, ultimately achieving high returns in her investment portfolio. She kept her investment portfolio secret, so O'Leary only discovered his mother's skill as an investor after her death, when her will was executed. Many of his investment lessons came from his mother, including the admonition to save one-third of his money. O'Leary had aspired to become a photographer, but on the advice of his stepfather attended university, where he continued to develop his interest in business and investing. He received an honours bachelor's degree in environmental studies and psychology from the University of Waterloo in 1977O'Leary, Kevin. (2012) Cold Hard Truth on Men, Women & Money. Doubleday Canada, page 106 and an MBA in entrepreneurship from the Ivey Business School at the University of Western Ontario in 1980. Business career In 1979, between the first and second years of his MBA program, O'Leary was selected for an internship at Nabisco in Downtown Toronto, and then worked as an assistant brand manager for Nabisco's cat food brand. O'Leary credits his later success at The Learning Company to the skills he developed in marketing during his days at Nabisco. After leaving Nabisco, O'Leary began a brief career as a television producer. With two of his former MBA classmates, Scott Mackenzie and Dave Toms (both of whom had assisted on O'Leary's MBA documentary), O'Leary co-founded Special Event Television (SET). SET was an independent television production company that produced original sports programming such as The Original Six, Don Cherry's Grapevine and Bobby Orr and the Hockey Legends. The company achieved limited success with minor television shows, soccer films, sports documentaries, and short in-between-period commercials for local professional hockey games. One of his partners later bought out his share of the venture for $25,000. = Softkey = After selling his share of SET, O'Leary started Softkey in a Toronto basement in 1986, along with business partners John Freeman and Gary Babcock. The company was a publisher and distributor of CD-ROM-based personal computer software for Windows and Macintosh computers. A major financial backer who had committed $250,000 in development capital to the company backed out the day before signing the documents and delivering his cheque, which left O'Leary looking for funding to support the fledgling business. He used the proceeds from the sale of his share of SET and convinced his mother to lend him $10,000 in seed capital to establish SoftKey Software Products. The software and personal-computer industries were growing rapidly in the early 1980s, and O'Leary convinced printer manufacturers to bundle Softkey's program with their hardware. With distribution assured, the company developed a number of educational software products focused on mathematics and reading education. Softkey products typically consisted of software intended for home users, especially compilation discs containing various freeware or shareware games packaged in \\"jewel-case\\" CD-ROMs. Softkey weathered stiff competition from other software companies in the late 1980s and prospered throughout the 1990s. By 1993, Softkey had become a major consolidator in the educational software market, acquiring rivals such as WordStar and Spinnaker Software. In 1995, Softkey acquired The Learning Company (TLC) for $606 million, adopting its name, and moved its headquarters to Cambridge, Massachusetts. TLC lost $105 million (US) in 1998 on revenues $800 million and suffered losses over the previous two years. TLC bought its former rival Brøderbund in June 1998 for $416 million. In 1999, TLC was acquired by Mattel for US$4.2 billion. Sales and earnings for Mattel soon dropped, and O'Leary departed Mattel. The purchase by Mattel was later called one of the most disastrous acquisitions in recent history. Following the acquisition, Mattel experienced a US$105 million loss where management had projected a $50 million profit. Mattel's stock dropped, wiping out US$3 billion of shareholder value in a single day. Mattel's shareholders later filed a class-action lawsuit accusing Mattel executives, O'Leary, and former TLC CEO Michael Perik of misleading investors about the health of TLC and the benefits of its acquisition. The lawsuit alleged that TLC used accounting tricks to hide losses and inflate quarterly revenues. O'Leary and his defendants disputed all of the charges. Mattel paid $122 million to settle the lawsuit in 2003. O'Leary blamed the technology meltdown and a culture clash of management of the two companies for the failure of the acquisition. O'Leary and backers from Citigroup made an unsuccessful attempt to acquire the video game company Atari, and O'Leary made plans to start a video-gaming television channel that never came to fruition. = StorageNow Holdings = In 2003, O'Leary became a co-investor and director at StorageNow Holdings, a Canadian developer of climate-controlled storage facilities, a company controlled by Reza Satchu and Asif Satchu. StorageNow became the operator of storage services in Canada, with facilities in 11 cities, and was acquired by in Storage REIT in March 2007 for $110 million. He sold his shares, originally worth $500,000, for more than $4.5 million. In May 2005, Reza Satchu and O'Leary's operating partner, Wheeler, filed a $10-million wrongful-dismissal lawsuit, charging that they had altered an agreed-upon compensation deal and illegally reduced Wheeler's share of the profits. O'Leary and Satchu claimed Wheeler failed to reach performance targets. The case was settled out of court. =Other projects= In March 2007, O'Leary joined the advisory board of Genstar Capital, a private equity firm that focuses on investing in healthcare services, industrial technology, business services and software. Genstar Capital appointed O'Leary to its Strategic Advisory Board to seek new investment opportunities for its $1.2 billion fund. O'Leary Funds In 2008, O'Leary co-founded O'Leary Funds Inc., a mutual fund company focused on global yield investing. He is the company's chairman and lead investor, while his brother Shane O'Leary serves as the director. The fund's assets under management grew from $400 million in 2011 to $1.2-billion in 2012. The fund's primary manager was Stanton Asset Management, a firm controlled by the husband-and-wife team of Connor O'Brien and Louise Ann Poirier. According to research by Mark R. McQueen, the fund increased distribution yield from his funds by returning invested capital to shareholders. While this is not unusual, it was contrary to O'Leary's statements. Another analysis also found that one quarter of the distributions from one of O'Leary's funds were return of capital. In November 2014, O'Leary Funds Management agreed to pay penalties to the Autorité des marchés financiers for violating certain technical provisions of the Securities Act. At the time of the agreement, O'Leary Funds reported that it had taken steps to correct the violations. On 15 October 2015, O'Leary Funds was sold to Canoe Financial, a private investment-management company owned by Canadian businessman W. Brett Wilson, who once was an investor with O'Leary on CBC's Dragons' Den. O'Leary Ventures O'Leary founded O'Leary Ventures, a private early-stage venture capital investment company, O'Leary Mortgages, O'Leary books, and O'Leary Fine Wines. In April 2014, O'Leary Mortgages closed.McLister, Rob. \\"O'Leary Mortgages Is No More\\". CanadianMortgageTrends.com. 10 April 2014 O’Leary’s funds have a questionable history and are said to have declined over 20% in a year, which is often a big blow to fund managers. O’Leary no longer manages outside money.  ETF and investing  On 14 July 2015, O'Leary launched an ETF through O'Shares Investments, a division of his investment fund, O'Leary Funds Management LP, where O'Leary serves as chairman. A value investor, he has given advice on personal finance. He advocates portfolio diversification and suggests that investors have their age as the percentage of bonds in their portfolios (i.e., 30% in bonds and 70% in stocks for a 30-year old investor, with an increasing proportion of bonds and decreasing proportion of stocks as the investor ages). O'Leary has also \\"stated on many occasions that he won’t invest in a publicly traded stock unless it pays him a dividend.\\" O'Leary also ventured into gold investing, with five per cent of his financial portfolio invested in physical gold. However, he does not invest in stocks of gold-mining companies because he says cash flow is an important investment factor to him. O'Leary also advises diversification in multiple industry sectors so that no more than 20% of one's financial portfolio is held in one sector. Books In September 2011, O'Leary released his first book, Cold Hard Truth: On Business, Money & Life, in which he shares his views on entrepreneurship, business, finance, money and life. A sequel, The Cold Hard Truth on Men, Women, and Money: 50 Common Money Mistakes and How to Fix Them, was published in 2012. It focused on financial literacy and financial education as a foundation for achieving wealth. O'Leary released a followup in 2013 in which he covers subjects relating to important life choices: education, careers, marriage and family, and retirement. He discusses the obstacles of raising a family while working to provide financial security for them and gives advice for developing financial literacy in family members, saving and investing money, and managing debt and credit. Media =Dragons' Den and Shark Tank= In 2006, O'Leary appeared as one of the five venture capitalists on the then-new show Dragons' Den on CBC, the Canadian instalment of the international Dragons' Den format. On the show, O'Leary developed a persona as a blunt, abrasive investor, who at one point told a contestant who started crying, \\"Money doesn't care. Your tears don't add any value.\\" This television persona was encouraged by executive producer Stuart Coxe, who during the first two seasons occasionally asked O'Leary to be \\"more evil\\". Dragons' Den became one of the most-watched shows in CBC history, with around two million viewers per episode. Coxe attributed the show's success in large part to O'Leary's presence. In 2009, the American version of Dragons' Den, Shark Tank, began, and Shark Tank executive producer Mark Burnett invited two of the CBC Dragons' Den investors, O'Leary and Robert Herjavec, to appear on the show. Both have remained with Shark Tank since the beginning. For several years, they appeared on both shows, although Herjavec left Dragons' Den in 2012, and O'Leary left in 2014. Shark Tank became a ratings hit, averaging 9 million viewers per episode at its peak in the 2014-15 season. It has also been a critical favourite, winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Structured Reality Program three times. O'Leary's appearances on Dragons' Den and Shark Tank popularized the nickname \\"Mr. Wonderful\\" for him; he has said that he is often referred to by that name in public. O'Leary has said that the nickname serves both as a tongue-in-cheek reference to his reputation for being mean, as well as a reflection of his view that his blunt assessments are helpful to misguided entrepreneurs. In a 2013 interview, O'Leary implied that he could not remember how he got the nickname. He had already referred to himself as \\"Mr. Wonderful\\" in a 2006 casting video for Dragon's Den, predating either show. Besides his blunt persona, O'Leary also gained a reputation on both shows for preferring deals in which he loans the entrepreneurs money in exchange for a percentage of future revenue, rather than taking a share of the company. Notable deals in which O'Leary has been involved on Shark Tank include investments in Talbott Teas (later bought by Jamba Juice) and GrooveBook (later bought by Shutterfly), the latter with Mark Cuban. O'Leary has a holding company, called \\"Something Wonderful\\", for managing his Dragons' Den and Shark Tank investments. =Discovery Channel's Discovery Project Earth= In 2008, O'Leary worked as a co-host for the Discovery Channel's Discovery Project Earth, a show that explores innovative ways to reverse climate change. = The Lang and O'Leary Exchange = In 2009, O'Leary began appearing with journalist Amanda Lang on CBC News Network's The Lang and O'Leary Exchange. During a segment of The Lang & O'Leary Exchange on the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011, O'Leary criticized Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Chris Hedges for sounding \\"like a left-wing nutbar.\\" Hedges said afterwards that \\"it will be the last time\\" he would appear on the show and compared the CBC to Fox News.James Crugnale (12 October 2011). \\"Journalist Chris Hedges Argues With CBC's Kevin O'Leary: 'This Sounds Like Fox News And I Don't Go On Fox News!'\\", Mediaite; retrieved 24 January 2014. CBC's ombudsman found O'Leary's behaviour to be a violation of the public broadcaster's journalistic standards.Szklarski, Cassandra. \\"O'Leary's 'nutbar' remark breach of policy, CBC ombudsman says.\\" Globe & Mail, 14 October 2011; retrieved 23 March 2012. In January 2014, on The Lang and O'Leary Exchange, O'Leary remarked, O'Leary later clarified these statements, saying, =Other projects= O'Leary has produced and hosted his own reality show, Redemption Inc., in which he tries to help ex-convicts start and develop their own businesses. Having also been a co-host of SqueezePlay on Bell Media's Business News Network (BNN), he returned to the Discovery Channel on 1 September 2014 to join as a contributor for its radio and television stations such as CTV. On 5 May 2015, O'Leary made an appearance on the game show Celebrity Jeopardy and received $10,000 for his charity despite finishing 3rd and in negative points after both Double Jeopardy and Final Jeopardy rounds. In September of that year, O'Leary appeared as a celebrity judge in the 95th Miss America pageant. He is currently a member of ARHT Media's Board of Advisors, alongside Paul Anka and Carlos Slim. Politics In January 2016, O'Leary offered to invest $1 million in the economy of Alberta in exchange for the resignation of Premier Rachel Notley and appeared with four other prospective leadership candidates at a conference for federal Conservatives in late February 2016 where he gave a presentation titled \\"If I Run, This is How.\\" During his speech he predicted that the Liberal government would fall within four years from economic collapse. =2017 federal Conservative Party leadership race= O'Leary with Andrew Scheer in 2018 Campaign logo Following Stephen Harper's resignation as leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, O'Leary attended Conservative party gatherings in February and May 2016, leading to public speculation about whether he would run for 2017 leadership election. In February 2016, Maxime Bernier, a Conservative Quebecois politician, criticized O'Leary, calling him a \\"tourist\\" for wanting to be prime minister without being able to speak French. Bernier later explained that he wanted all leadership candidates to learn French and praised his fellow leadership contender Lisa Raitt, who was trying to improve her French. O'Leary stated that he was taking French lessons, and promised to learn French in time for the next federal election. On 18 January 2017, O'Leary officially entered the Conservative leadership race. That same day, his former Dragons' Den co-star Arlene Dickinson stated that she found O'Leary to be too \\"self-interested and opportunistic\\" to be qualified for the office of prime minister. In response, another former Dragons' Den co-star, W. Brett Wilson, endorsed O'Leary, highlighting differences between O'Leary as a businessman and his TV persona. On 1 February 2017, O'Leary posted a video of himself shooting in a Miami gun range. It was removed from Facebook out of respect for the funeral for three victims of the Quebec City mosque shooting on that day. It was also revealed that he was in New York promoting one of his business ventures when this occurred. O'Leary later apologized for the timing of this post. Throughout his run for the leadership of the Conservative Party of Canada, O'Leary was compared in the press to U.S. President Donald Trump. Commentators noted that both were wealthy businessmen who gained greater fame as a result of appearing on reality television, prior to running for office, on a platform that included lowering taxes and regulations. Some commentators also found similarities in what they called both men's brash, outspoken style, though various also stated that O'Leary's bluntness, unlike Trump's, was simply part of a \\"carefully- cultivated persona\\". O'Leary has praised Trump personally, calling him \\"smart as a fox\\", but tended to dismiss comparisons to him by noting that, in contrast to Trump's anti-immigration rhetoric and specifically his pledge to build a wall on the Mexico–United States border, \\"I'm of Lebanese-Irish descent, I don't build walls, I am very proud of the society we're building in Canada, I think it is the envy of the planet. There's no walls in my world. I wouldn't exist if Canada had walls.\\" Other commentators pointed out the differences between Trump and O'Leary on other issues, including free trade, abortion, marijuana legalization and the future of NATO. O'Leary was a frontrunner in the polls throughout most of his run. Nevertheless, he dropped out of the leadership race on 26 April 2017, stating that, though he still thought he could win the leadership election, a lack of support for him in Quebec meant that it would be difficult for him to beat Trudeau in 2019, and that it would thus be \\"selfish\\" of him to continue. On dropping out, he endorsed Bernier, considered the other main frontrunner for the position. (Andrew Scheer eventually won the leadership election, narrowly edging out Bernier.) =Political positions= Economy and trade O'Leary supports multi-lateral free trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement. He described hypothetical trade negotiations between Donald Trump and Justin Trudeau as \\"Godzilla versus Bambi\\". O'Leary believes corporate tax rates in Canada are too high, and has promised to eliminate the national carbon tax. O'Leary has threatened to punish provinces by withholding transfer payments if they do not eliminate their respective carbon taxes. O'Leary is a critic of deficit spending and supports eliminating the national debt. O'Leary opposes control of the CRTC over Canada's telecommunications system. Energy O'Leary supports building a pipeline from the Athabasca oil sands to Eastern Canada with the intentions of making Canada \\"energy independent\\". He has criticized Canada's reliance on Saudi Arabia for oil and gas. He has stated he would support a national referendum on the issue of pipelines. Social O'Leary describes his social policies as \\"very liberal\\". He supports same-sex marriage and transgender rights. O'Leary supports the legalization and regulation of marijuana. O'Leary supports assisted suicide and cited Switzerland as a model for Canada to follow. Foreign and military policy O'Leary supported ending Canadian airstrikes on ISIS and supports taking a peacekeeping role in the Syrian Civil War. O'Leary described Russia as \\"neither an ally or a foe\\" in an interview with the CBC. O'Leary has criticized Justin Trudeau's procurement plan. He supports purchasing aerial combat drones to defend Canadian airspace and supports phasing out use of the Lockheed CP-140 Aurora citing cost reasons. He has criticized the lack of funding of the Canadian Armed Forces and supports spending the NATO recommended 2% of GDP on military expenditures. Immigration O'Leary has proposed creating a \\"fast track\\" for citizenship for immigrants who graduate from college or university and find employment, as well as for their spouses and children. O'Leary has advocated for increased border security in order to tackle the issue of irregular border crossing. Senate In a 2017 interview with Evan Solomon, O'Leary suggested that Senators should pay money every year, instead of being paid, thus turning \\"a cost centre to Canada\\" into \\"a profit centre.\\" = Leadership debt and lawsuit = In November 2018, O'Leary hired lawyer Joseph Groia and sued Elections Canada and Canada's federal elections commissioner over campaign finance laws which limited candidates to spending only $25,000 of their own money for their leadership campaign. At the time of the lawsuit, O'Leary still owed $430,000 to creditors. O'Leary had proposed to Elections Canada that he pay off the debt now with his own money and fundraise the money later, but was rebuffed, since this would be illegal. O'Leary made public statements that the law promoted mediocrity since rich people would be discouraged from running and hurt the businesses who had pledged money for his failed leadership campaign. In O'Leary's legal submissions, he argued that the laws preventing the use of personal money over $25,000 were a restriction of his Section 2 Charter right to free expression and the threat of jail time in those laws violated his Section 7 right to security of the person. Personal life O'Leary and his wife, Linda, have been married since 1990. The couple separated in 2011, but resumed their marriage after two years. Linda now serves as the VP of Marketing for O'Leary Wines. They have two children. Trevor is a music producer and DJ while Savannah is a multimedia producer at the Huffington Post. In an interview with Inc. Magazine writer Brian D Evans O'Leary stated: \\"In a successful growing business, it eats your time alive. Then later in life, you can provide for your family things that many others can't have. But because you sacrificed, you're then given the reward of freedom.\\" O'Leary's primary residence and tax residency is in Toronto, Ontario. He also maintains a cottage in Muskoka as well as homes in Boston and Geneva, Switzerland. O'Leary is a fan of the football team the New England Patriots, and claims to watch all of their games, even when he is travelling around the world and the games occur during the middle of the night. He is a wine aficionado, and belongs to the Confrérie des Chevaliers du Tastevin, an international association of burgundy wine enthusiasts. He is also a lifelong photographer, and has exhibited and sold prints of his photographs, donating the proceeds to charity. On 24 August 2019, O'Leary was involved in a fatal crash on Lake Joseph in Muskoka, Ontario. A 64-year-old man and a 48-year-old woman died when a boat owned by O'Leary was involved in a collision with another boat. O'Leary said in a statement that he is cooperating with the police investigation, that he was a passenger in his boat, and that the other boat did not have its lights on and \\"fled the scene\\". The police stated that both boats left the scene to \\"attend a location and both parties called 911.\\" On 24 September, Linda O'Leary, the operator of the O'Leary's boat, was charged with \\"careless operation of a vessel\\" under the small vessel regulations of the Canada Shipping Act, a charge that carries a maximum 18 months imprisonment and a $1-million fine. The driver of the other boat, Richard Ruh of Orchard Park, New York, was charged with \\"failing to exhibit navigation light while underway.\\" On 11 October, the Public Prosecution Service of Canada ruled out any jail time for Linda.

Her obsession with film editing started in France, when Littleton became acquainted with French New Wave cinema. During the 1970s, Carol Littleton owned a production company that made commercials. She moved into working as a film editor with director Karen Arthur on Legacy (1975). Other films were to follow and Littleton received an Academy Award nomination for editing Steven Spielberg's E.T. the Extra- Terrestrial (1982). Commencing with Body Heat (1981), Littleton had an extended collaboration with the director Lawrence Kasdan.

History =Cary Village Mall= Originally planned in 1972, the mall was first proposed as the adjacent Cary Village Mall and Cary Village Square projects, part of a $25 million Village Center by local developers Seby Jones (who built Crabtree Valley Mall and J.W. York (who built Cameron Village). Village Center was to be a , 75 store project including 3 office buildings as well as a (never built) motel. Cary Village Center fills the intersection between Maynard Avenue (a loop around central Cary), Walnut Street, and Cary Towne Boulevard (originally Western Boulevard Extension), the latter two of which continue to nearby freeways. The enclosed mall was built on the eastern part of the site, with office buildings at the center and two open-air retail pavilions on the north, separated by Cary Towne Boulevard. The request to rezone the area to allow construction of the mall drew much controversy from nearby residents calling themselves \\"Citizens for the Better Direction of Cary\\" who worried about increased traffic as well as the property's proximity to Cary High School, Henry Adams School, and East Cary School. The group hired an attorney and pressured the town council to closely monitor the development causing York to complain that everything had to be approved \\"10 times\\". Cary Village Mall opened on February 21, 1979, with of retail space anchored by Ivey's (purchased by Dillard's in 1990) and Hudson Belk (now Belk) as well as outbuildings occupied by Big Star Markets (later Harris Teeter). The mall's design was a modified pinwheel with four wings, three either parallel to or facing the three streets around it, and a fourth facing to the rear of the mall where additional land remained for future expansion. At the center of the pinwheel was a sunken, triangular food court. A large Southern Red Oak tree on the expansion land became an unofficial mascot of the mall, and was retained on a raised terrace at the considerable expense even after the mall parking area grew around it. The tree died a few years later and its terrace was removed and the location added to the parking lot. =Expansion/Transition to Cary Towne Center= In 1988, the mall applied for a zoning change for a major expansion, perhaps spurred by proposals for a \\"mega-mall\\" at Crossroads Plaza emerged only a mile away. In 1991, the mall completed its expansion to 1.1 million square feet and was renamed Cary Towne Center by then-owners Richard E. Jacobs Group. Unusual for a mall of its size, the mall remained single-story. The new mall included a food court adjacent to the oak tree, a Center Court with palm trees, and three new anchors: Thalhimers, JC Penney, and Sears. In 1992, Dillard's opened a new, larger store adjacent to its original building, which became inline shops. In 2001, the mall was sold to CBL & Associates Properties as part of a portfolio of 21 properties in nine states. That same year, Thalhimer's became Hecht's in 1992, which became Macy's in 2006. =Changes in Retail Landscape= On November 6, 2013, Dave and Buster's opened in the mall. Harris Teeter moved across the street in October 2014 to a larger location, later replaced with Jumpstreet, an indoor trampoline, bounce house, and entertainment complex. Sears closed its Cary Towne location in January 2015, citing continual financial struggles on the corporate level. In 2015, TopGolf sought zoning approval from the town to open in what had been the Sears space, however plans were later withdrawn due to concerns over lighting and noise issues with a nearby neighborhood. Macy's closed its location in early 2016 due to disappointing sales and earnings performance. The Sears space was filled in May 2016 by a local furniture store, Cary Towne Furniture, which boasted itself to be the largest furniture retail store in the region. However, the store closed in December 2016. On January 31, 2019, JCPenney announced that they would close their Cary Towne Center location on May 3, 2019. It was included as part of a plan to close 27 stores by July 5, 2019, which the company announced in February 2019. On July 12, 2019, Dillard's announced it was closing its Cary Towne Center store by December, according to a notification filed with the State of North Carolina. This left Belk as the lone anchor remaining in the mall. =Decline and Transformation = Plans have been in the works to transform Cary Towne Center from a traditional mall to a mixed-used development for many years. Spurred on by an announcement made by IKEA to open a 350,000-square-foot store in 2020 where Sears and Macy's were once located, CBL began the rezoning process alongside the Town of Cary to redevelop the property. The submitted mixed use proposal included retail (352,000 SF), residential (800 dwelling units), office (600,000 SF), hotel (600 rooms) and community spaces. However, in late May 2018, IKEA reversed its earlier plans and publicly announced the retailer was no longer coming to Cary because of the retail apocalypse. As a result, CBL announced that it had defaulted on the mall's mortgage and was going to sell the mall. On January 31, 2019, Turnbridge Equities and Denali Properties announced they had purchased the mall. Turnbridge and Denali announced plans in October 2020 to close and demolish Cary Towne Mall following the 2020 holiday shopping season. The property will be transformed into a mixed-use project called Carolina Yards, which will include retail, hotel, residential, and office space, along with plenty of open outdoor space for gatherings, recreation, and events. Belk, along with Dave and Buster's, will be renovated and remain as part of the new complex.

H. Rummenigge's Player Manager) is a football (soccer) video game developed by British studio Anco Software and released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, featuring football manager Kevin Keegan. Gameplay The player takes a football team and manages them to win games and eventually the championship. The player does not control each individual team member directly. Instead, the player designs plays and acquires players from other teams in order to make the perfect team. Both teams are out on the soccer field and are ready to play a game. Kevin Keegan's Player Manager gave the player the option of having direct control of the team on the pitch like a regular football sim (but only if the player's personal character was still within playing age and currently representing the team on the pitch), as well as doing all the managerial side of the gameplay as in regular football management sims. The game was based on the Player Manager game developed by Dino Dini for the Amiga and Atari ST, but was not endorsed by the original creator. Players take the role of the player-coach, and begin the game as a 28-year-old. At the age of 35 years (corresponding to the end of the 2000 season), the player character automatically declares his retirement. Controlling the players during a match from that point becomes impossible from that point onwards. After a few more seasons, however the player could sign a nephew or other family member and again become able to control the players on the pitch again. There were only forty-eight teams in a three division structure, and the top tier was titled 'Division 1' as this was before the days of the Premier League. It also featured the FA Cup (titled the Misawa Cup), and Football League Cup (titled Premier Cup) competitions. Misawa Cup- Features all 48 teams that are in the game. The 16 Division 1 clubs get byes to the last 32, While the Division 2 & 3 teams battle out for the remaining 16 spaces, This is a knockout competition which also features replays and a Wembley Final Premier Cup- This only features all 32 teams in Division 1 & 2, Its a straight knockout but its over 2 legs (Apart from the final) and Away goals always count double, Again this features a wembley final. The game has features like training, scouting and newspaper reports; one-field positions associated are associated with unique colours. Reception Power Unlimited gave the game a rating of 80% in their January 1994 issue. Consoles Plus rated the game with a score of 71% back in May 1994 while German video game magazine Total! gave it a score of 4.25 out of 6.

Originally organized by the Kiwanis Club of Orleans (Ottawa), the event is now organized by the Children's Aid Foundation of Ottawa, which uses it to fund educational and life enrichment opportunities for children and youth who are supported by The Children's Aid Society of Ottawa. Each year, 1,500 people play in teams of up to 10 people. The event was originally held at the Aberdeen Pavilion before moving to the EY Centre in 2012. The questions are prepared by Paul Paquet of triviahalloffame.com and the Ottawa Trivia League. Many political and media luminaries attend. Former mayor Jacquelin Holzman once served as a judge, and in 2003, Ken Jennings read the first question via videotape. By tradition, the first answer is always Pierre Trudeau, as a tip of the hat to the long-running radio trivia contest in Stevens Point, WI, which always begins with a question about Robert Redford. Since 2006, the winners have been awarded the Trong Nguyen Memorial Trophy, named after a member of wirecrats.com who died earlier that year.

Biography Barham was born in Dowagiac, Michigan.August 27, 2000 He received a bachelor of music degree in woodwinds from the University of North Texas in 1982 and a master of music in woodwinds (saxophone) from the University of Michigan (where he studied with Donald Sinta) in 1983. He has previously served on the faculties of the California State University, Northridge, Andrews University, and Lake Michigan College. He has performed throughout the United States and Europe, and has concertized in Japan, as well. His former students include Andrew J. Allen and Lynzii O'Connor. Barham's phenomenal playing has literally taken him around the globe. 'An American master saxophonist...' declared a London critic after Phil Barham's debut there in 1990. That recital in the Purcell Room, London, was part of his first European tour of debut recitals that also took him to Oslo, Norway, where he played in the Universitetets Aula, and to Geneva Swiwtzerland, with two recitals, one at the Musee International de la Croix- Rouge and the other in the Palais de l'Athenee. Audiences and critics agreed with the opinion already offered by the New York TÏmes: '...ability to swing at a dancing rhythm or to blister through a swift rippling melody...' published after his New York debut at Carnegie Recital Hall in 1987. Barham has received critical acclaim across the country. At a recent concert in the Midwest, one critic was moved to write: '...world-class saxophonist... technical virtuosity...a dazzling performance that brought the audience to its feet in a standing ovation.' On March 2, 1991, Barham completed his 1990-1991 season with a solo recital at Merkin Concert Hall, New York City. Barham presented his Tokyo debut under the auspices of \\"Music 2000\\" on October 30, 1993. This concert was held in Sogetsu Hall and featured music by American composers. On September 28, 1994, Barham performed for the Dame Myra Hess Memorial Concert Series held at the Chicago Public Library Cultural Center. Recently, he was awarded a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to record the works for U.S. contemporary composer Rodney Waschka II. Barham has performed at the University of North Texas, Denton as guest artist. Barham was also a clinician under the Yamaha Musical Instruments Performing Artist program. Barham is presently a clinician for the Selmer Company and Assistant Professor of Saxophone at Tennessee Technological University. He has also been the Saxophone Instructor for Western Michigan University's Summer Seminar. In 1989, he received the honor of being among the 'Outstanding Young Men of America.' In constant demand as a clinician and performer, Barham has appeared regularly with the Southwest Michigan Symphony, the South Bend Symphony and the Kalamazoo Symphony. Barham has also appeared on Public Television's WNIT \\"Open Studio.\\" His recent performances include Alexander Glazunov's Concerto with the Holland Symphony Orchestra, Darius Milhaud's Scaramouche with the Bryan Symphony Orchestra and John Williams' Escapades with the South Bend Symphony Orchestra.

The BBC's Doctor Who is listed in the Guinness World Records as the longest-running science fiction television show in the world and as the \\"most successful\\" science fiction series of all time. Early years The first known science fiction television programme was produced by the BBC's prewar television service. On 11 February 1938, a thirty-five-minute adapted extract of the play R.U.R., written by the Czech playwright Karel Čapek, was broadcast live from the BBC's Alexandra Palace studios. Concerning a future world in which robots rise up against their human masters, it was the only piece of science fiction to be produced until the BBC television service resumed after the war. Only a few on-set publicity photographs survive. R.U.R. was produced a second time on 4 March 1948, this time in a full ninety-minute live production, adapted for television by the producer Jan Bussell, who had also been responsible for the screening in 1938. The BBC did begin producing more science fiction, with further literary adaptations such as The Time Machine (1949) and children's serials like Stranger from Space (1951-1952). In the summer of 1953, the six-part serial The Quatermass Experiment was broadcast live. An adult-themed science-fiction drama specially written for television by BBC staff writer Nigel Kneale, its budget consumed the majority of the finances reserved for drama that year. This successful serial ultimately led to three further Quatermass serials and three feature film adaptations from Hammer Film Productions. The Quatermass Experiment is also the first piece of British television science fiction to partially survive, albeit only in the form of poor quality telerecordings of its first two episodes. The second serial Quatermass II (1955) is the earliest BBC science fiction production to exist in its entirety. Kneale could not rely on sophisticated special effects to convey his narratives. Instead, he based his stories around characterisation and characters' reactions to the strange events unfolding around them, using science fiction themes to tell allegorical stories such as paralleling real life racial tensions with the Martian \\"infection\\" of Quatermass and the Pit (1958-59). On 12 December 1954, a live adaptation of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, produced by the Quatermass team of writer Nigel Kneale and director Rudolph Cartier, achieved the highest television ratings since the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II on 2 June 1953. It was so controversial that it was debated in Parliament, and campaigners tried to have the second performance the following Thursday banned. The BBC's Head of Drama Michael Barry refused to concede. Science fiction productions were rare and almost always one-offs. A for Andromeda (1961) (which starred a young Julie Christie) and its sequel (The Andromeda Breakthrough, 1962) were exceptions. Creation of Doctor Who and ITV Britain's first commercial television network ITV initially explored science fiction for programming purposes in the early 1960s. A proponent for such experimentation was Canadian-born producer Sydney Newman, who had become Head of Drama at ABC. At ABC, Newman produced the science-fiction serial Pathfinders in Space (1960) and its sequels Pathfinders to Mars (1960) and Pathfinders to Venus (1961) and oversaw the science-fiction anthology series Out of This World (1962), the first of its kind in the UK. ITV also made an attempt at children's science fiction, with its short-lived programme Emerald Soup (1963), which coincidentally aired the same night that Doctor Who premiered. Two important events for the future of the British television science fiction occurred in 1962. The first was that the BBC's Head of Light Entertainment, Eric Maschwitz, commissioned Head of the Script Department Donald Wilson to prepare a report on the viability of producing a new science-fiction series for television. The second was that Sydney Newman was tempted away from the ABC to take up the position of Head of Drama at the BBC, officially joining the Corporation at the beginning of 1963. The BBC developed an idea of Newman's into Britain's first durable science-fiction television series. Taking advantage of the research Wilson's department had completed, Newman initiated the creation and along with Wilson and BBC staff writer C. E. Webber oversaw the development of this new series, which Newman named \\"Doctor Who\\". After much development work, the series was launched on 23 November 1963. The importance of Doctor Who to British television science fiction cannot be overstated. It lasted for twenty-six seasons in its original form, through which first emerged many of the writers who until the 1980s would create most of the genre's successful British shows. One of the few science fiction series to have become part of the popular consciousness, its success led the BBC to produce other efforts in the genre. Of particular note being its own science fiction anthology series Out of the Unknown (1965-71), which ran for four seasons. Some of the ITV companies were imitating American styles of production, shooting some of their series on film rather than in the multi- camera electronic studio for lucrative sales in the 'international' market. One producer who was keen to make science fiction for the commercial network was Gerry Anderson, who initially used puppets for his shows. His science fiction shows in 'Supermarionation' such as Supercar (1961-62), Fireball XL5 (1962-63), Stingray (1964-65), Thunderbirds (1965-66), Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons (1967-68) and Joe 90 (1968-69) remain popular among followers of archive television. Their success led his backers ITC to finance the live- action shows he most wanted to develop. The first of these was UFO (1970-71), which featured American actor Ed Bishop as the head of an undercover military organisation with responsibility for combating aliens who came to Earth in the eponymous space craft. A planned second season was delayed and eventually reformatted as a new show, entitled \\"Space: 1999\\" (1975-77), which ran for two seasons and was a moderate success. Television science fiction in the '70s The 1970s is viewed by fans of the genre as a 'golden age'. Doctor Who was going through its strongest period with first Jon Pertwee (1970-1974) and later Tom Baker (1974-1981) in the leading role, already firmly entrenched in the public consciousness. Various former Doctor Who alumni had moved on to produce their own acclaimed genre programmes as well. The series' former scientific adviser Dr Kit Pedler and former script editor Gerry Davis collaborated to create Doomwatch (1970-72), a series which recounted the story of a governmental scientific group formed to investigate and combat ecological and scientific threats to humankind. In the Quatermass tradition of allegorical storytelling (Nigel Kneale was invited, but declined to contribute scripts to the programme), it used its science-fiction basis to try to convey real warnings about the state of the world, as well as telling tense, dramatic stories and not being afraid of shocking its audience, such as in the killing off of popular lead character Toby Wren (played by Robert Powell). Writer Terry Nation had created the Dalek race for Doctor Who in 1963, and thus assuring much of its early popularity. For the rest of the 1960s Nation had concentrated on writing for ITV film series, but in the early 1970s he returned to science fiction, contributing Dalek stories to Doctor Who again from 1973 to 1975 and in 1975 creating his own science-fiction show, Survivors (1975-77). Survivors was a post-apocalyptic tale of a small group of people who were the only humans left after a plague caused by biological warfare lab accident has wiped out most of humanity. It ran for three seasons and was generally well received. Nation followed it by creating Blake's 7 (1978-81). Pitched by Nation as \\"the Dirty Dozen in space\\", Blake's 7 originally revolved around righteous freedom fighter Roj Blake, his battle with a corrupt Galactic Federation and the rag-tag group of pirates, criminals and smugglers who are reluctantly forced to work with him after an escape from a prison ship. Running for four seasons, the early evening series had a hard edge. The moral ambiguity of the leading characters made them interesting, and as with Doomwatch it was not afraid of shocking the audience by killing off leading characters, climaxing by wiping out the entire crew in its final episode. ITV was continuing to produce science fiction in this era. Keen to catch some of the young audience who followed Doctor Who, some of the ITV companies sought to create their own youth-oriented genre programmes, such as the 1970's cult classic sci-fi drama series, Timeslip (1970), and the original The Tomorrow People (1973-79). Although it presented some intriguing (if bizarre) storylines, it never rivalled Doctor Who, possibly because unlike the BBC programme it attempted to identify with children by featuring children, thus making the crossover appeal to an adult audience much more difficult. A much more respected show, produced by ATV in a similar production manner to Doctor Who (i.e. on videotape using a serial form) was Sapphire & Steel (1979-82). The tale of two \\"time detectives\\" played by David McCallum and Joanna Lumley, Sapphire & Steel was a superbly atmospheric piece of television, although its production run was often hampered by the unavailability of its two leads. 1980s Longer-running science-fiction series became few and far between. Although Doctor Who was still running, in terms of audience it was struggling to compete with US imports in the genre which began to re-emerge following the box-office success of contemporary films like the Star Wars franchise. For the television channel controllers, these had the benefit of transmission rights having a lower cost than any domestic productions. Dr Who's place in the Saturday schedule was briefly lost when it was moved to a weekday slot. Nonetheless, in the early part of the decade there were several serials produced, albeit mainly by the BBC; the bought in series mainly aired on ITV. Adaptations of novels such as The Day of the Triffids (1981), The Invisible Man (1984) and The Nightmare Man (1981, from the novel Child of the Vodyanoi) were produced, and the BBC began an adaptation of The White Mountains novels, under the name The Tripods (1984–85). The Tripods had run for two of its planned three series when it was cancelled by the Controller of BBC1, Michael Grade. At the same time Grade abandoned a whole season of Doctor Who; the series was on hiatus for eighteen months. It appeared to be generally felt at the BBC that science fiction was more expensive to produce than other types of programme but did not return any higher audiences for the outlay or particular critical acclaim. Some BBC popular and critical successes such as Edge of Darkness (1985) had science-fiction as a secondary element. The industry's shift in drama productions being entirely mounted on film rather than using the old film/video 'hybrid' form, with increased costs edged out genre's thought marginal. Perhaps the very last original series of its kind in the multi-camera era of BBC science fiction was Star Cops (1987), which ran for only nine episodes to poor viewing figures on the corporation's second channel, BBC2. It was written by Chris Boucher, who had contributed scripts to Doctor Who and Blake's 7, and was script editor for the later series entire run. The 1980s also saw the arrival on the BBC of two science fiction comedy series both of which had their origins on radio. The first was The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (1981) by Douglas Adams which amalgamated aspects of the original radio series with that of the subsequent novel. The second was Red Dwarf (1988–99, 2009–present), created and originally written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor. It parodies most (if not all) of the subgenres of science fiction but is first and foremost an 'odd couple' type comedy (the couple in question being the characters of Rimmer and Lister). Running for more than eight series, the idea was originally developed from the Dave Hollins: Space Cadet sketches introduced on Grant and Naylor's 1984 BBC Radio 4 show Son of Cliché. Doctor Who revival and other developments The original version of Doctor Who lasted until 1989. Apart from a television movie in 1996, Doctor Who did not re-emerge in a bigger budget version until 2005. Affected by rights issues for some years, many of those behind the new series were fans of the show when they were younger. Doctor Who returned to television screens on 26 March 2005, gaining a profile reminiscent of the earlier series at its peak. Perhaps the most high-profile of those behind the movement to return Doctor Who to the screens is writer Russell T Davies, who initially worked in the BBC children's department earlier in his career, and contributed to British TV science fiction there. Davies' first sci-fi serial was the six-part Dark Season (1991), which co-starred a young Kate Winslet as well as former Blake's 7 star Jacqueline Pearce. Two years later Davies wrote a second, much more complex serial called Century Falls (1993). ITV contributed a new version of The Tomorrow People (1992-94) made as an international co-production with US and Australia companies, and there were various other child-oriented sci-fi type series such as ITV's Mike & Angelo (1989–99) and the BBC's Watt on Earth (1991), although these lacked the crossover adult appeal that Davies' shows had possessed. The interest in making British TV science fiction seemed to return to broadcasters towards the middle of the 1990s in that companies began to see the possibility of lucrative overseas sales and tie-in products that other genres could not match. In the mid-1990s the BBC screened four seasons of the glossy sci-fi action adventure series Bugs (1995-98) made by independent company Carnival. They co-produced the six-part serial Invasion: Earth (1998) with the US Sci Fi Channel, and ITV began attempting to market British sci-fi again with serials such as The Uninvited (1997) and The Last Train (1999). The BBC also produced several children's science fiction shows in the late 1990s to mid-2000s. The most known examples of which being Aquila (TV series) (1997–1998) based on the novel by Andrew Norriss and Jeopardy (BBC TV series) (2002–2004) which won the 2002 BAFTA for Best Children's Drama. A 'live' remake of The Quatermass Experiment was broadcast on BBC Four on 2 April 2005. Various series have followed the new success of Doctor Who, including two spin-offs entitled Torchwood (2006-2011) and The Sarah Jane Adventures (2007-2011), a new time travel drama Life on Mars (BBC 2006-2007), Eleventh Hour (ITV 2008-2009), Primeval (ITV 2007-2011) and in 2009 new story for Red Dwarf, now shown exclusively on Dave rather than the BBC, followed by Red Dwarf X in 2012. A short-lived but lively show Dirk Gently was made from the Douglas Adams' book Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency\\" in 2010.

After the death of his father, Rana Sanga,Mahajan V.D. (1991, reprint 2007) History of Medieval India, Part II, S. Chand, New Delhi, , p.11 Ratan Singh II was crowned King. Ratan Singh II was assassinated in 1531. He was succeeded by his brother Maharana Vikramaditya Singh. During the reign of Vikramaditya, when the Muzaffarid Sultan of Gujarat Bahadur Shah sacked Chittor in 1535, Udai Singh was sent to Bundi for safety. In 1537, Banbir killed Vikramaditya and usurped the throne. He tried to kill Udai Singh also, but Udai's nurse Panna Dai sacrificed her own son Chandan to save him from his uncle Banbir and took him to Kumbhalgarh. She did not ask for anything in return either. She started living in Bundi and did not allow Udai Singh to come and meet her. He lived secretly in Kumbhalgarh for two years, disguised as a nephew of the governor Asha Shah Depura (Maheshwari). In 1540, he was crowned in Kumbhalgarh by the nobles of Mewar. His eldest son Maharana Pratap from his first wife, Maharani Jaivantabai Songara (daughter of Akhey Raj Songara of Jalore), was born in the same year.Tod, James (1829, reprint 2002).

In September 1567, his son Shakti Singh came to him from Dhaulpur and told him of Akbar's plan to capture Chittor.Rana 2004, p.31 According to Kaviraj Shyamaldas, Udai Singh called a council of war. The nobles advised him to take refuge along with the princes in the hills, leaving a garrison at Chittor. On 23 October 1567 Akbar formed his camp near Chittor. Udai Singh retired to Gogunda (which later became his temporary capital) leaving Chittor in the hands of his loyal chieftains Rao Jaimal and Patta. Akbar captured Chittor after a four-month-long siege on 23 February 1568.persian.packhum.org/persian/main?url=pf%3Ffile%3D00701022%26ct%3D118 He later shifted his capital to Udaipur.

It is in the Magdalena Ranger District of the Cibola National Forest, about 9 mi (15 km) south of Magdalena and 18 mi (30 km) west-southwest of Socorro. It lies just north of the Langmuir Laboratory for Atmospheric Research of the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, and site of the Magdalena Ridge Observatory Interferometer. South Baldy can be accessed easily from the dirt road leading to Langmuir. Alternately, it can be accessed by trail from below. From a campground in Water Canyon (accessed from the northeast side of the range), a trail follows Forest Road 406 and then Trail 10 up Copper Canyon to the main crest of the range, where it joins Trail 8, the North Baldy Trail, which follows the crest. A short hike south on this trail and a little off-trail ascent leads to the summit of South Baldy. The peak is the site of an annual mountain bike ascent race up the Langmuir Road as part of the Tour of Socorro. While not of exceptional height for New Mexico mountains, South Baldy is surrounded by low terrain, and hence is a highly visible landmark and the sixth most topographically prominent peak in the state.

Computer programs that solve these problems have been used to research a broad range of scientific topics from ADP to breast cancer. Because protein function is determined by its shape and the physiochemical properties of its exposed surface, it is important to create an accurate model for protein/ligand interaction studies. The problem arises often in homology modeling, where the tertiary structure of an amino acid sequence is predicted based on a sequence alignment to a template, or a second sequence whose structure is known. Because loops have highly variable sequences even within a given structural motif or protein fold, they often correspond to unaligned regions in sequence alignments; they also tend to be located at the solvent-exposed surface of globular proteins and thus are more conformationally flexible. Consequently, they often cannot be modeled using standard homology modeling techniques. More constrained versions of loop modeling are also used in the data fitting stages of solving a protein structure by X-ray crystallography, because loops can correspond to regions of low electron density and are therefore difficult to resolve. Regions of a structural model that are predicted by non-template-based loop modeling tend to be much less accurate than regions that are predicted using template-based techniques. The extent of the inaccuracy increases with the number of amino acids in the loop. The loop amino acids' side chains dihedral angles are often approximated from a rotamer library, but can worsen the inaccuracy of side chain packing in the overall model. Andrej Sali's homology modeling suite MODELLER includes a facility explicitly designed for loop modeling by a satisfaction of spatial restraints method. All methods require an upload of the PDB file and some require the specification of the loop location. Short loops In general, the most accurate predictions are for loops of fewer than 8 amino acids. Extremely short loops of three residues can be determined from geometry alone, provided that the bond lengths and bond angles are specified. Slightly longer loops are often determined from a \\"spare parts\\" approach, in which loops of similar length are taken from known crystal structures and adapted to the geometry of the flanking segments. In some methods, the bond lengths and angles of the loop region are allowed to vary, in order to obtain a better fit; in other cases, the constraints of the flanking segments may be varied to find more \\"protein-like\\" loop conformations. The accuracy of such short loops may be almost as accurate as that of the homology model upon which it is based. It should also be considered that the loops in proteins may not be well-structured and therefore have no one conformation that could be predicted; NMR experiments indicate that solvent-exposed loops are \\"floppy\\" and adopt many conformations, while the loop conformations seen by X-ray crystallography may merely reflect crystal packing interactions, or the stabilizing influence of crystallization co-solvents. Template Based Techniques As mentioned above homology-based methods use a database to align the target protein gap with a known template protein. A database of known structures is searched for a loop that fits the gap of interest by similarity of sequence and stems (the edges of the gap created by the unknown loop structure). The success of this method largely depends on the quality of that alignment. Since the loop is the least conserved portion of a protein’s structure, the homology-based method cannot always find a known template that aligns with the target sequence. Fortunately, the template databases are always adding new templates so the problem of not being able to find an alignment is becoming less of an issue. Some programs that use this method are SuperLooper and FREAD. Non-Template Based Techniques Otherwise known as an ab initio method, non-template based approaches use a statistical model to fill in the gaps created by the unknown loop structure. Some of these programs include MODELLER, Loopy, and RAPPER; but each of these programs approaches the problem in a different manner. For example, Loopy uses samples of torsion angle pairs to generate the initial loop structure then it revises this structure to maintain a realistic shape and closure, while RAPPER builds from one end of the gap to the other by extending the stem with different sampled angles until the gap is closed. Yet another method is the “divide and conquer” approach. This involves subdividing the loop into 2 segments and then repeatedly dividing and transforming each segment until the loop is small enough to be solved. Even with all these methods non-template based approaches are most accurate up to 12 residues (amino acids within the loop). There are three problems that arise when using a non-template based technique. First, there are constraints that limit the possibilities for local region modeling. One such constraint is that loop termini are required to end at the correct anchor position. Also, the Ramachandran space cannot contain a backbone of dihedral angles. Second, a modeling program has to use a set procedure. Some programs use the “spare parts” approach as mentioned above. Other programs use a de novo approach that samples sterically feasible loop conformations and selects the best one. Third, determining the best model means that a scoring method must be created to compare the various conformations. See also * Chung SY, Subbiah S. (1996.)

Their sound has been described as an experimental mixing bowl, with ingredients including space rock, cinematic orchestral music, jazz, psychedelic rock, dark n' dusty westerns, future pop, spoken word, electro- indie, folk etc. They have toured the U.S and Canada with the likes of The Polyphonic Spree, Supergrass, Eisley, Midlake, and Guster as well as played shows with The Album Leaf, Jon Brion, Devotchka, Akron Family, Angels of Light, Dios (Malos) and more. They have also had their music featured in TV shows like TLC's Deadliest Catch and The Messengers. Background Pilotdrift consists of singer-songwriter Kelly Carr. Started in 2004 with his best friend singer-songwriter Micah Dorsey, the pair formed Pilotdrift with fellow friends Ben Rice, Jay Budzilowski, Eric Russell, and John David Blagg. They played their first show with the self-released album titled Iter Facere, which was a mix of Carr's songs and Dorsey's songs. A fan base quickly grew, and Pilotdrift began playing more shows to bigger crowds at further distances. Eventually they crossed paths with Eisley, Midlake, and the staff of GoodRecords, fusing close friendships of encouragement. Soon they would play an in-store show at GoodRecords where the owner and leading visionary of The Polyphonic Spree (Tim DeLaughter) would be. DeLaughter and his wife Julie Doyle were wanting to build an independent label called Good Records Recordings, and they wanted Pilotdrift to be the first signee. Although Pilotdrift agreed to sign, Dorsey started feeling that maybe life on the road wasn't all too compatible with him, and decided that before the band embarked on this new adventure, it would be a good time to step aside.

He is a long-serving councillor of the City of Port Phillip and its mayor from November 2018 till late 2019, having previously served from 1998-2000 and in 2004. He has also served as the President of the Municipal Association of Victoria. He is known for his enthusiastic style in highlighting important social and legal issues in the community. During this time he supported a proposal for Sex Tolerance Zones in St Kilda where street prostitutes would not be arrested in about 25 locations, including one near St Kilda Park Primary School. However, after wide community protests, including a march on St Kilda Town Hall, Gross and then Albert Park District parliamentarian, John Thwaites MLA, backed down. He backed the controversial failed redevelopment of the St Kilda Triangle site in 2008, which resulted in his defeat at that year's council elections after a fierce campaign. Gross was defeated at two later elections the last being in Junction Ward. On 26 January 2010, Gross was appointed as a Member of the Order of Australia, \\"for service to local government, particularly through the Municipal Association of Victoria, as a contributor to environmental reform initiatives in the area of waste management, and to the community of Port Phillip.\\" Gross was elected to council again in 2016, in Canal Ward.

According to Strabo, it was situated between Amathus (a false reading for Psamathus) and Gythium. It was often under Spartan control. Polybius relates that Philip V of Macedon, in his invasion of Laconia, suffered a repulse before Asine (218 BCE), which appears from his narrative to have been near Gythium. Pausanias, in describing the same event as Polybius, says that Philip was repulsed before \\"Las\\", which originally stood on the summit of \\"Mount Asia\\". There can therefore be no doubt that the \\"Las\\" of Pausanias and the \\"Asine\\" of Polybius are the same place; and the resemblance between the names \\"Asia\\" and \\"Asine\\" probably led Polybius into the error of calling Las by the latter name; an error which was the more likely to arise, because Herodotus and Thucydides speak of the Messenian Asine as a town in Laconia, since Messenia formed a part of Laconia at the time when they wrote. The error of Polybius was perpetuated by Strabo and Stephanus of Byzantium. During the Roman period Asine belonged to Sparta although most of the other towns in the area were part of the Union of Free Laconians. The site was resettled in 1451 as Skoutari. Its site is located near the modern Skoutari.

These days were celebrated as feast-days. Public mourning was forbidden on 14 of them, and public fasting on all.  History of the feast days  The events generally date to the Hasmonean era, though almost half of them cannot be conclusively identified. Only a few occurred earlier than the Hasmonean era, or after the destruction of the Second Temple. Many commemorate Hasmonean victories in battle.Megillat Taanit – The Scroll of Fasting by Vered Noam The days are enumerated, not in the chronological order of the events they commemorate, but in the sequence of the calendar. Megillat Ta'anit contains twelve chapters, each chapter contains the memorial days of a single month, beginning with Nisan (the first calendar month), and ending with Adar.Jewish Encyclopedia Article for Megillat Taanit, by Isidore Singer and Jacob Zallel Lauterbach. While J. Schmilg argued that these memorial days become festivals by being incorporated and recorded in Megillat Ta'anit,Ueber die Entstehung und den Historischen Werth des Siegeskalenders Megillat Ta'anit, pp. 11–20 later scholarship has concluded that the days had been known and celebrated by the people long before that time (as Schmilg himself was forced to admit in the case of some of them). The celebration of these festivals or semi-festivals evidently existed as early as the time of Judith.Book of Judith viii. 6 The compilers of Megillat Ta'anit merely listed the memorial days, and at the same time determined that the less important should be celebrated by a mere suspension of fasting, while public mourning was to be forbidden on the more important ones.  Structure  In most editions Megillat Taanit consists of two parts, which are distinct in language and in form, namely: * The text or Megillat Ta'anit proper, written in Aramaic and containing merely brief outlines in a concise style. It dates to the Tannaitic period. * The scholium or commentary on the text, written in Hebrew. This is written much later - in the seventh century or later, as shown by its author having before him the text of both the Talmuds as well as that of Bereshit Rabbah.Compare Brann, l.c. pp. 410-418, 445-451 The many quotations from Megillat Ta'anit in the Talmud are all taken from the Aramaic text and are introduced by the word \\"ketib\\" = \\"it is written\\".As in Hullin 129b; Megillah 5b; Ta'anit 12a and 18b This text, which had been committed to writing and was generally known,Eruvin 62 was explained and interpreted in the same way as the Bible.Yerushalmi Ta'anit 2 66a The Talmud does not include a single quotation from the scholium.In Ta'anit 12a, the single passage, \\"bi- Megillat Ta'anit,\\" from which Schmilg tries to prove that the Talmud quotes the scholium as well as Megillat, is a later addition (compare Brann, l.c. pp. 457 et seq.), and is not found in the Munich manuscript (compare Rabbinowitz, Ha-Meassef, iii. 63). Although the comments found in the scholium are mentioned in the Talmud, they are not credited to Megillat Ta'anit, but are quoted as independent baraitot, so that the scholium took them from the Talmud, and not vice versa. Schmilg provides references intended to prove an earlier origin for the scholium;l.c. pp. 36–41 however, these sources merely prove that the scholiast intended to make his work pass for a product of the tannaitic period. As the text and the scholium of Megillat Ta'anit are distinct in form and in language, so do they differ also in historical accuracy. The text is an actual historical source, whose statements may be regarded as authentic, while its dates are reliable if interpreted independently of the scholium. The scholium, on the other hand, is of very doubtful historical value and must be used with extreme caution. Although it contains some old baraitot which are reliable, the compiler has mixed them with other, unhistorical, accounts and legends, so that even those data whose legendary character has not been proved can be credited only when they are confirmed by internal and external evidence. In some editions, a third section appears: the \\"final discourse\\" (Hebrew ma'amar aharon) which lists days on which one should fast (in contrast to the rest of Megillat Ta'anit, which lists days on which fasting is forbidden). This section dates to the period of the Gaonim.  Authorship of the Aramaic text Opening page of Megilat Taanit The Talmud, and the scholium to Megillat Ta'anit itself, provide slightly different accounts of the authorship of Megillat Ta'anit: *According to an old baraita in the Talmud, \\"Hananiah ben Hezekiah of the Garon family, together with a number of others who had assembled for a synod at his house, compiled Megillat Ta'anit.\\"Shabbat 13b According to Halakot Gedolot, Hilkot Soferim, the members of this synod were the \\"Ziknei Bet Shammai\\" and \\"Ziknei Bet Hillel,\\"ed. Vienna, p. 104; ed. Zolkiev, p. 82c the eldest pupils of Shammai and Hillel. Megillat Ta'anit must have been composed, therefore, about the year 7 CE, when Judea was made a Roman province to the great indignation of the Jews.compare Schmilg, l.c. pp. 20–36 This calendar of victories was intended to fan the spark of liberty among the people and to fill them with confidence and courage by reminding them of the victories of the Maccabees and the divine aid granted to the Jewish nation against the heathen. * The scholium to Megillat Ta'anit says: \\"Eleazar ben Hanania of the family of Garon together with his followers compiled Megillat Ta'anit.\\"Megillat Ta'anit, 12, end, evidently quoting an old baraita This Eleazar took a noteworthy part in the beginning of the revolt against the Romans, vanquishing the garrison at Jerusalem, as well as Agrippa's troops, and Menahem's Sicarian bands. According to this account, therefore, Megillat Ta'anit was composed by the Zealots after the year 66 CE, during the revolution.H. Grätz, Gesch. iii., note 26; although it is not necessary to correct the Talmudic account to agree with the scholium, and to read, as does Grätz, in Shabbat 13b, \\"Eleazar b. Hananiah,\\" instead of \\"Hananiah.\\" Modern scholarship rejects Schmilg's view that the scholium is incorrect, since there is both internal and external evidence in favor of its authenticity. The account in the Talmud and that in the scholium may both be accepted, since not only Hananiah the father, but also Eleazar the son, contributed to the compilation of the work. Eleazar, one of the central figures in the war against the Romans, endeavored to strengthen the national consciousness of his people by continuing his father's work, and increased the number of memorial days in the collection, to remind the people how God had always helped them and had given them the victory over external and internal enemies. = Interpolations = Eleazar did not, however, complete the work, and several days were subsequently added to the list which was definitely closed in Usha, as is proved by the fact that the 12th of Adar is designated as \\"Trajan's Day,\\" and the 29th of that month as \\"the day on which the persecutions of Hadrian ceased\\".Compare Brann in Monatsschrift, 1876, p. 379 Furthermore, R. Simon ben Gamaliel, who was nasi at Usha, says that \\"If we should turn all the days on which we have been saved from some danger into holidays, and list them in Megillat Ta'anit, we could not satisfy ourselves; for we should be obliged to turn nearly every day into a festival.\\"Shabbat 13b; compare Rashi ad loc. This indicates that the work was definitely completed at Usha in the time of R. Simon, in order that no further memorial days might be added. The scholion The scholion is written in Mishnaic Hebrew combined with some more ancient terminology; there are also some influences from later Babylonian Aramaic. Some stories in the scholion are ancient and reliable, mentioning historical facts nowhere else appearing in Tannaic literature; while others are midrashim taken from a variety of sources. Vered Noam has shown that the scholion currently printed is a medieval hybrid of two independently written commentaries, nicknamed \\"Scholion O\\" and \\"Scholion P\\", after the Oxford and Parma manuscripts in which they are found. Often these two commentaries contradict each other, offering entirely different stories for the origin of a holiday. In general Scholion O has more overlap with Genesis Rabbah, the Talmud Yerushalmi, and other sources from Israel; while Scholion P is closer to Babylonian sources. The current Scholion, nicknamed the \\"Hybrid Version\\", was created in the 9th or 10th centuries by combining Scholia O and P. Scholia O and P may be just two examples of a genre of commentaries on Megillat Taanit, with a partial scholion in the Babylonian Talmud being a third example, and the other examples not surviving.  Editions and commentaries  Megillat Ta'anit is extant in many editions, and has had numerous commentaries. The best edition of the Aramaic and Hebrew text is that of Vered Noam, which has supplanted A. Neubauer's as the authoritative work in the field. In addition to meticulous philological scholarship, Noam's edition includes rich annotation and a groundbreaking interpretation of the stemmatic history. Of commentaries the following may be mentioned: Abraham ben Joseph ha-Levi, double commentary (Amsterdam, 1656); Judah ben Menahem, double commentary (Dyhernfurth, 1810); Johann Meyer, Latin language translation published in his Tractatus de Temporibus, etc. (Amsterdam, 1724). Derenbourg and Schwab have made French versions of the Aramaic text.

Born in Tønsberg, Norway, Rune went to Bolivia in 2004 to work with homeless children for a year. After returning to Norway, he decided he wanted to cycle all over the world, so he started in South America in December 2005, then cycled through Central America, Mexico and then across the United States. In November 2006, Rune started his trip to Canada and cycled across Canada (from west to east) in the winter, the first known person to do so. He was fully equipped with winter camping gear for sub-freezing temperatures. In May 2007, he left for Africa, cycling through Senegal, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, Congo, South Africa, Indonesia, Australia. He completed his trip in 2010, returning to live in Norway. In Africa, Rune was called \\"Paco\\", as it was too difficult for the locals to pronounce his name. Rune never paid for accommodation, and lived off $5–$10 per day USD. He carried a tent with him, but hardly had to use it, as many people offered him a place to stay in their homes. A few motels, lodges and hostels also offered him free accommodations as well as meals. Rune operated mostly on donations as cycling every day did not allow for time to work a regular job. He occasionally takes a few days off to see the local sights, attend special events and to meet with people in bicycle shops and cafes. Personal Life Rune is now married to Amelia Monstrad with two children, and lives in Canada. Canada Trip On February 3, 2007, while he was in Regina, Saskatchewan, he was invited to give a talk about winter cycling to a group of about 60 people with Regina EcoLiving Inc., a non-profit organization located in Regina. In areas where there is snow and/or ice in the winter, this is also called Icebiking. On February 15, 2007, Rune arrived just west of Winnipeg, Manitoba, battling 50 kilometer per hour side winds with near whiteout conditions. He was featured in the Winnipeg Sun and Winnipeg Free Press over the weekend. While in Winnipeg, he was also invited to several events including a local Icebike event on February 18, which was sponsored by Woodcock Cycle Works. On March 3, he was invited to the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra's Northern Landscape concert and was introduced on stage by the conductor of the symphony, Alexander Mickelthwate. The Norwegian Canadian Club of Winnipeg hosted a display in the lobby of the Centennial Concert Hall. The Norwegian Club promotes arts, crafts, foods and language of Norway as well as encouraging community among Norwegians. Rune's bicycle was placed on the Norwegian display that evening, and during the intermission and after the concert, he met many symphony patrons. Rune met several cyclists during his stay in Winnipeg and gave a brief talk about his trip. The Norwegian and Scandinavian Clubs held a luncheon for him, and he gave a talk to those groups as well. He also met the Ambassador of Norway to Canada, His Excellency Mr. Tor. B. Naess. On March 4, Rune left Winnipeg to continue his trip east. He arrived in Thunder Bay on March 13 and in Sault Ste. Marie on March 23. He arrived in Sudbury on March 27. CTV Northern Ontario and News 10 Persona in Sudbury filmed a story about him. On Thursday, March 29, he left Sudbury, arriving in North Bay on Friday, March 30. To view the photos from his Thunder Bay trip, visit the Thunder Bay cycling club web site at http://www.tbaycc.ca, then click on \\"The Viking Biker Visits Thunder Bay\\" on the left under \\"News at a Glance\\". On April 8, Rune arrived in Montreal and was featured on CBC TV. On May 5, he arrived in Halifax, Nova Scotia and on May 24, 2007, he arrived in Corner Brook, Newfoundland and Labrador. Rune's plan is to cycle to L'Anse aux Meadows, where the Vikings first settled in North America. Rune's twin brother will be picking him up in a sailboat, and they will then sail to Africa, where Rune will continue his cycling adventure. Rune has been interviewed on Conrad Schmidt's Pedal Revolutionary radio show in Vancouver, BC, KOMO-TV in Seattle, CBC Calgary and Global Winnipeg. Two television stations in Sudbury, Ontario also interviewed him. You can view these film clips on his web site. Several newspapers in the US, Canada and Norway have published stories about him.

It is about a flying cupid-like character who eats food and attacks enemies with hearts. The original Japanese version of the game is about a ghost named Q-tarō, a character from a Fujiko Fujio manga series titled Obake no Q-tarō. It was retitled and modified for its North American release since its source material was not familiar to Western audiences.\\"Obake no Q-Taro WanWan Panic .\\" IGN. Plot Chubby Cherub's friends are kidnapped by several burglars. Chubby Cherub has to save them, however many dogs are in the way. Chubby Cherub has to cross 12 levels, and at the end of each, the protagonist finds his friends. Eating food maintains Chubby Cherub's flight. If the flying meter goes all the way down, the character has to stay on the ground. The character must shoot hearts at the dogs before they bark at the character; if a bark hits the character, the character may die. There are hell and heaven stages. When Chubby Cherub goes down to the stage where it has open downsides, he goes to hell. It is a dark stage, so he cannot see any floors and cannot fly. When Chubby Cherub touched a dog, he reacts like a misfit but it repeats until he arrives to the exit. Heaven can be reached with a smoke ring when Chubby Cherub touches it by flying from below. Heaven has many cakes which are worth 500 points each. If Chubby Cherub eats foods every time from the right side since the beginning of the stage until he reaches heaven, the heaven stage scrolls and Chubby Cherub warps to beyond the stage according to the distance of the scrolled part of heaven. Characters =Chubby Cherub/Q-tarō the Ghost= Q-tarō the Ghost is the main character in the Japanese version of the game, and Chubby Cherub is the main character in the English version. They can both fly through the air or walk on the ground. Flying uses the power meter more quickly. If the power meter runs out, the player has to walk on foot. Lollipops give Chubby Cherub/Q-tarō the ability to fire four shots at the dogs. Other foods replenish the meter. =Beagles= Beagles are one of the main enemies in the game. Beagles can jump around onto ledges and fences. Some are assigned to one place and just jump in two spots. Others can bark at the player, releasing an icon that must be avoided. It is noted that the barks move with the screen. If coming from the back, they are very dangerous. =Bulldogs= Bulldogs are much bigger than beagles. They do not move as fast, and bark much more. Bulldogs are perched much higher off the ground. Bulldogs are just as dangerous when they bark from behind the player's character. =Cats= Cats are less of a threat than the other enemies, although they are impossible to get rid of. All Cats are immune to the player's attacks and come in a shade of brown and pink. Reception Sean Reiley reviewed Chubby Cherub and stated that, in his opinion, it was the fifteenth worst NES game of all time.

Comprising five percent of Hong Kong's population, about 98.5% of them are women. In 2019, there were 400,000 foreign domestic helpers in the territory; of these, 48 percent were from the Philippines, 49.4 percent from Indonesia and 1.3 percent from Thailand. Required by law to live in their employer's residence, they perform household tasks such as cooking, serving, cleaning, dishwashing and child care. Since October 2003 the employment of domestic workers has been subject to the unpopular Employees' Retraining Levy, totalling HK$9,600 for a two-year contract. It has not been applied since 16 July 2008, and has since been abolished. Whether foreign workers should be able to apply for Hong Kong residency is the subject of debate, and a high-profile court battle for residency by a foreign worker failed. The conditions of foreign domestic workers are being increasingly scrutinised by human-rights groups and are criticised as tantamount to modern slavery. Documented cases of worker abuse, including the successful prosecution of an employer for subjecting Erwiana Sulistyaningsih to grievous bodily harm, assault, criminal intimidation and unpaid wages, are increasing in number. In March 2016, an NGO, Justice Centre, reported its findings that one domestic worker in six in Hong Kong were deemed to have been forced into labour.  Terminology  Helpers meeting on Sunday at Statue Square in CentralIn Hong Kong Cantonese, 女傭 (maid) and 外傭 (foreign servant) are neutral, socially-acceptable words for foreign domestic helpers. Fei yung (菲傭, Filipino servant) referred to foreign domestic helpers, regardless of origin, at a time when most foreign domestic helpers were from the Philippines. The slang term bun mui (賓妹, Pinoy girl) is widely used by local residents. In Chinese-language government documentation, foreign domestic helpers are referred to as 家庭傭工 (domestic workers) \\"of foreign nationality\\" (外籍家庭傭工) or \\"recruited from abroad\\" (外地區聘用家庭傭工). Although the government uses words with the same meanings in English-language documentation, it substitutes the term \\"domestic helper\\" for \\"domestic worker\\". Director of the Bethune House shelter for domestic workers Edwina Antonio has criticised the term \\"helper\\", saying that the migrants do dirty jobs; calling them \\"helpers\\" strips them of the dignity accorded workers and implies that they can be mistreated, like slaves.  History  Faced with a poor economy in 1974, Filipino President, Ferdinand Marcos implemented a labour code which began his country's export of labour in the form of overseas workers. The Philippine government encouraged this labour export to reduce the unemployment rate and enrich its treasury with the workers' remittances. The economy of the Philippines became increasingly dependent on labour export; in 1978 labour-export recruiting agencies were privatised, and became a cornerstone of the economy. Increasing labour export from the Philippines coincided with the economic rise of Hong Kong during the late 1970s and early 1980s. When the People's Republic of China implemented wide-reaching economic reform in the late 1970s and initiated trade with other countries, Hong Kong became mainland China's biggest investor. Labour-intensive Hong Kong industries moved to the mainland, and high-profit service industries in the territory (such as design, marketing and finance) expanded dramatically. To deal with the resulting labour shortage and increase in labour costs, the female labour force was mobilised. Two-income families sought help to manage their households, creating a demand for domestic workers. Female participation in the workforce increased, from 47.5 percent in 1982 to 54.7 percent in 2013. Families began hiring foreign domestic workers from the Philippines, with the number of workers steadily increasing during the 1980s and 1990s.  Prevalence and demographics  Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan are considered attractive destinations by those seeking employment as domestic workers. According to Quartz, Hong Kong has one of the highest densities of foreign domestic workers in the world and its pay scale is a benchmark for other jurisdictions. Since the mid-1970s, when the foreign-domestic-helper policy was initiated, the number of workers has increased to around 300,000. At the end of 2013, there was an average of one foreign domestic worker for every eight households overall; in households with children, the average is one for every three. Foreign domestic helpers are about 10 percent of the working population. In December 2014 the number of migrant workers employed as helpers was over 330,000, 4.6 percent of the total population; the vast majority were female. Before the 1980s and increased prosperity on the mainland, Chinese domestic workers were dominant. Until the 1990s, workers then came primarily from the Philippines; the percentage is now shifting from Philippine workers to Indonesian and other nationalities. During the 1990s Indonesia and Thailand followed the Filipino model of labour export to deal with domestic economic crises, and Hong Kong families began hiring workers from those countries as well. The Indonesians provided competition, since those workers were often prepared to accept half the minimum wage. According to the Immigration Department, in 1998 there were 140,357 Filipino domestic workers in Hong Kong and 31,762 from Indonesia.Wan, Adrian (10 November 2010). \\"Push to lift ban on maids from Vietnam\\", South China Morning Post In 2005, official figures indicated 223,394 \\"foreign domestic helpers\\" in the territory; 53.11 percent were from the Philippines, 43.15 percent from Indonesia and 2.05 percent from Thailand. In 2010, the respective numbers were 136,723 from the Philippines (48 percent), 140,720 from Indonesia (49.4 percent), 3,744 from Thailand (1.3 percent), 893 Sri Lankans, 568 Nepalese and 2,253 of other nationalities. Vietnamese are not permitted to work in Hong Kong as domestic workers for what authorities call \\"security reasons\\" linked to (according to one lawmaker) historical problems with Vietnamese refugees. Attempts to import workers from Myanmar and Bangladesh have failed. Indonesian president Joko Widodo has reportedly said that he considers the export of domestic labour a national embarrassment, pledging that his government will end the practice. In February 2015 there were 331,989 foreign domestic workers in Hong Kong, of which 166,743 were from the Philippines – an increase of 7,000 from the previous year, with the number of Indonesians remaining static.  Recruitment  Foreign domestic workers are recruited primarily by a large number of specialised agencies, with local firms connected to correspondents in the workers' home countries. Agencies are paid by employers and workers, and are regulated according to the Employment Ordinance and Employment Agency Regulations. Local agencies dealing with workers from the Philippines are accredited by the Philippine consulate. To hire an Indonesian worker, an employer must use an agent, whereas there is no similar requirement for Filipino workers. Although agency fees are regulated by law to 10 percent of one month's salary, some agencies in the workers' countries charge commissions and \\"training\\" fees which take several months to pay off. The Philippine government outlawed commissions in 2006, and employment agencies may only charge fees.  Employment regulations  Sample of the first page of a standard employment contract for a foreign domestic helper The government of Hong Kong has drawn up rules and regulations concerning the employment, labour and conditions of stay of foreign domestic helpers. Since 2003, all foreign domestic helpers are required by law to be live-in. An employer and employee are required to enter into a standard, two-year contract specifically for the employment of foreign domestic helpers. Employer regulations include: *Household income of at least HK$15,000 (US$1,920) per month for each foreign domestic helper employed *A levy of HK$9,600 for employing a foreign domestic helper, for the duration of a 2-year contract (abolished 31 July 2013) *Free medical treatment for the foreign domestic helper *A monthly salary of no less than the minimum allowable wage set by the government Helpers' rights and obligations include: * To perform only the domestic duties outlined in the employment contract * To not accept other employment during the effective period of the contract * To work and live in the employer's place of residence, and to be provided with suitable living accommodation with reasonable privacy * One rest day (a continuous period of not less than 24 hours) every week * Minimum 7 days to maximum 14 days of paid annual leave based on length of service * 12 days of statutory holidays during an entire year = Minimum allowable wage = Foreign domestic workers' wages are subject to a statutory minimum, a breach of which is sanctionable under the Employment Ordinance. An employer convicted of paying less than the minimum allowable wage (MAW) is subject to a maximum fine of HK$350,000 and three years' imprisonment. Helpers' minimum wages are inflation-adjusted annually for contracts about to be signed, and apply for the duration of the contract. They were reduced by HK$190 (five percent) in 1999. In April 2003, another deflationary period, the government announced a HK$400 reduction in pay (to HK$3,270) \\"due to the steady drop in a basket of economic indicators since 1999.\\" The minimum allowable wage was raised by HK$80, to HK$3,480 per month, for contracts signed on or after 6 June 2007. Another HK$100 cost-of-living adjustment took effect for all employment contracts signed on or after 10 July 2008, increasing the minimum wage to HK$3,580 per month. The minimum allowable wage was reset to HK$3,740 per month on 2 June 2011, and raised to HK$3,920 per month for contracts signed from 20 September 2012 onwards.\\"Practical Guide For Employment of foreign domestic helpers – What foreign domestic helpers and their employers should know\\", Labour Department, Hong Kong, September 2012 The MAW has been criticised by workers' and welfare groups for making FDWs second- class citizens. The statutory minimum wage does not apply to them; although the MAW is HK$3,920, a local worker working a 48-hour week would earn HK$6,240 if paid at the minimum hourly wage of HK$30 (as of 30 March 2015). The International Domestic Workers Federation has complained that the MAW rose by only 3.9 percent (or HK$150) from 1998 to 2012, failing to keep pace with Hong Kong's median monthly income (which rose over 15 percent during the same period). Since Hong Kong is a benchmark market for Asian migrant workers, there is pressure to keep wages low. Wages were also held in check by competition from Indonesian workers, who began arriving in large numbers during the 1990s. Since then, workers from other Asian countries (such as Bangladesh and Nepal) may be willing to work for less than the MAW. = Employees' Retraining Levy = During a recession in October 2003, the Hong Kong government imposed a HK$400 monthly Employees' Retraining Levy for hiring a foreign domestic helper under the Employees Retraining Ordinance. The tax, proposed by the Liberal Party in 2002 to tackle a fiscal deficit, was introduced by Donald Tsang as part of the government's population policy when he was Chief Secretary for Administration. Although Tsang called foreign and local domestic workers two distinct labour markets, he said: \\"Employers of foreign domestic helpers should play a role in helping Hong Kong in ... upgrading the local workforce.\\" According to Government Policy Support and Strategic Planning, the levy would be used to retrain the local workforce and improve their employment opportunities. The government said that the extension of the levy to domestic helpers would remove the disparity between imported and local workers. According to The Standard, it was hoped that fewer foreign maids would be employed in Hong Kong. The Senate of the Philippines disagreed with the Hong Kong government, denounced the levy as \\"discriminatory\\" and hinted that it would take the issue to the International Labour Organization. Senate president Franklin Drilon said that a tax on domestic workers countered Hong Kong's free-market principles and would damage its reputation for openness to foreign trade, investment and services. Earlier that year the minimum wage for foreign domestic helpers was lowered by the same amount, although the government said the reduction in the minimum wage and imposition of the levy were \\"unrelated\\"; lawyers for the government called the moves an \\"unfortunate coincidence\\". The measure was expected to bring HK$150 million annually into government coffers. Thousands of workers, fearing that the financial burden would be passed to them, protested the measures. The government, defending the measures as necessary in Hong Kong's changing economy, said that foreign domestic workers were still better paid than their counterparts in other Asian countries; according to James Tien, the monthly wage of Filipina maids in Singapore was about HK$1,400 and $1,130 in Malaysia. In 2004 a legal challenge was mounted, asserting that the levy on employers was unlawful as a discriminatory tax. In January 2005 High Court Justice Michael Hartmann ruled that since the levy was instituted by law it was not a tax, but a fee for the privilege of employing non-local workers (who would not otherwise be permitted to work in Hong Kong). In 2007 the Liberal Party urged the government to abolish the Employees' Retraining Levy as a part of its District-Council election platform, saying that the HK$3.26 billion fund should be used as originally intended: to retrain employees. In an August 2008 South China Morning Post column, Chris Yeung called the case for retaining the levy increasingly morally and financially weak: \\"Middle class people feel a sense of injustice about the levy\\". According to Regina Ip, the levy had lost its raison d'être. In 2013 the government abolished the levy in the Chief Executive's policy address, effective 31 July.  Levy waiver controversy  As part of \\"extraordinary measures for extraordinary times\\" (totalling HK$11 billion) announced by Donald Tsang on 16 July 2008, the levy would be temporarily waived at an estimated cost of HK$2 billion. In the Chinese press, the measures were mockingly called 派糖 (handing out candy). The levy would be waived for a two-year period on all helpers' employment contracts signed on or after 1 September 2008, and would not apply to existing contracts. The Immigration Department said it would not reimburse levies, which are prepaid semiannually. The announcement resulted in confusion and uncertainty for workers. Before Tsang's October policy address, Chris Yeung called the waiver a \\"gimmick dressed up as an economic relief initiative, designed to boost the administration's popularity\\". Maids' representatives said that when the waiver was announced, the guidelines were unclear and had no implementation date. Employers deferred contracts or dismissed workers pending confirmation of the effective date, leaving them in limbo. They protested the uncertainty, demanding an increase in their minimum wage to HK$4,000. Employers reportedly began terminating their helpers' contracts, stoking fears of mass terminations. On 20 July Secretary for Labour and Welfare Matthew Cheung announced that the waiver commencement date would be moved up by one month, and the Immigration Department temporarily relaxed its 14-day re-employment requirement for helpers whose contracts had expired. On 30 July the Executive Council approved the suspension of the levy for two years, from 1 August 2008 to 31 July 2010. After widespread criticism, the government said that maids with advanced contract renewals would not be required to leave Hong Kong; employers would benefit from the waiver by renewing contracts within the two- year period. According to the government, some employers could benefit from the waiver for up to four years. The effect of turning a two-year moratorium into four-year suspension was denounced by newspapers across the political spectrum, and the levy itself was called \\"farcical\\" in a South China Morning Post editorial. Stephen Vines wrote: \\"The plan for a two-year suspension of the levy ... provides an almost perfect example of government dysfunction and arrogance\\", and Albert Cheng said that the controversy exposed the \\"worst side of our government bureaucracy\\". Columnist Frank Ching criticised senior officials for living in ivory towers, and said that there would have been no disruption if the government had suspended payment immediately and repaid those who had prepaid. Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor called for the levy's permanent abolition, saying that the temporary two-year waiver was discriminatory and criticising the confusion and inconvenience caused to employers by the Immigration Department because the policy had not been thought through. = Administrative crush = Foreign domestic workers queuing at counters at the Immigration Department in Wan Chai in late August 2008On the morning of 1 August the Immigration Department issued 2,180 passes to workers and agents to collect visas and submit applications to work in Hong Kong, promising to handle all applications submitted. Offices opened one hour earlier than usual, added staff and extended their hours to guarantee that all 2,180 cases would be processed. The Philippine consulate also expected a large workload as a result of the rehiring provisions. Chinese newspapers published articles calculating how households could maximise their benefits under the waiver rules. Street protests on 3 August decried the waiver's unfairness and its burden on the Immigration Department. According to one protester, the waiver would teach households how to use legal loopholes. The West Kowloon Immigration office in Yau Ma Tei processed 5,000 advance contract renewals and 7,400 regular renewals in August 2008. Despite the availability of online booking for slots at its five branch offices, the daily quota on the number of applications being processed resulted in overnight queues. Positions in the waiting line were illegally sold for up to HK$120.  Legislative Council debate  The government was required to move an amendment in the Legislative Council (LegCo) to suspend the levy in accordance with the Executive Council decision. Faced with calls to abolish the levy, the government was adamantly opposed; according to the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, the HK$5 billion fund would only support the Employment Retraining Board for four or five years if the levy was permanently waived. Regina Ip began a campaign to abolish the levy, and tabled an amendment at LegCo. The government said that it would attempt to rule it out of order on the grounds that it would breach rule 31(1) of the Rules of Procedures, which prohibit amendments impacting government revenue. Ip compared this stance with a 2005 High Court decision that the Employees' Retraining Levy was not a tax. According to the government, a bill to abolish the levy would breach Article 74 of Hong Kong Basic Law and it would take Article 74 to the central government for interpretation. Legislators and commentators called this proposal a \\"nuclear bomb\\", and a University of Hong Kong academic said that reinterpretation would be a \\"totally disproportionate ... route to resolve this dispute.\\" Under pressure from legislators, the government (through the Executive Council) agreed to extend the levy's suspension from two to five years. The amendment for the five-year suspension, one of several proposed amendments to the Employees Retraining Ordinance Notice 2008, was tabled by the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong and would apply to first-time and renewed contracts and visas issued between 1 August 2008 and 31 July 2013.  Grievances  Foreign domestic workers and their supporters, including activists and employers, have periodically staged rallies protesting what they perceive as discriminatory treatment on the part of the Hong Kong government. Grievances include discrimination, the minimum wage and the two-week stay limit at the end of a domestic worker's employment contract. According to the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor (HKHRM), foreign domestic helpers face discrimination from the Hong Kong government and their employers. A 2013 Amnesty International report on Indonesian migrant domestic workers, \\"Exploited For Profit, Failed By Governments – Indonesian Migrant Domestic Workers Trafficked To Hong Kong\\", suggested that they may be the victims of serious human- and labour-rights violations in Hong Kong and some regulations make the problem worse. Abuses noted by AI include confiscation of travel documents, lack of privacy, pay below the Minimum Allowable Wage and being \\"on call\\" at all hours. Many are subjected to physical and verbal abuse by their employers, and are forced to work seven days a week. = Systemic exploitation = Many migrant workers have little education, little knowledge of the law and their rights, and leave home to support their families. They fall victim to agents (official and unofficial), unscrupulous officials and a lack of legal protection at home and in their host countries. The debts they incur to secure employment overseas may lock them in a cycle of abuse and exploitation. There is criticism in the Philippines that the country is one of the biggest human traffickers in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. In the Manila Standard, Alejandro Del Rosario criticised the government for continuing its 1960s policy of labour export instead of focussing on domestic production and job creation (allowing the program to expand, contributing to the brain drain). Amnesty International suggests that a lack of oversight allows criminal syndicates to profit from foreign workers, who are often unaware of their legal rights in their host country. AI's 2013 report alleges that many Indonesians are victims of forced human trafficking, and criticises the Indonesian and Hong Kong governments for having \\"failed to take adequate action to enforce domestic legislation in their own territories which could have protected migrant workers from trafficking, exploitation and forced labour ... In particular, they have not properly monitored, regulated or punished recruitment and placement agencies who are not complying with the law.\\" In 2014 and 2015 several incidents involving worker mistreatment surfaced, indicating that employment agencies often neglect workers' rights or are complicit in the cycle of abuse; there have also been many instances of failure to provide service to employers. According to media reports, between 2009 and 2012 the Consumer Council in Hong Kong received nearly 800 complaints about agencies. Many complaints concerned workers who did not match the descriptions provided, to the extent that it was suspected that the agencies deliberately misrepresented the workers' experience. The 2015 death of Elis Kurniasih, awaiting her work visa before beginning employment, exposed grey areas and legal loopholes in the Employment Agency Regulations; Kurniasih was crushed to death by falling masonry at an agency boarding house in North Point.\\"Protest at agency over maid slab death\\" . The Standard, 18 March 2015. Worker protections against illegal fees, unsanitary accommodations and lack of insurance were criticised as inadequate. = Right of abode = Under the Immigration Ordinance a foreigner may be eligible to apply for permanent residency after having \\"ordinarily resided\\" in Hong Kong for seven continuous years, and thus enjoy the right of abode in Hong Kong. However, the definition of \\"ordinary residency\\" excludes (amongst other groups) those who lived in the territory as foreign domestic helpers; this effectively denied foreign workers the rights of permanent residents (including the right to vote), even if they had lived in Hong Kong for many years. Since 1997, section 2(4) of the Immigration Ordinance has stated that \\"a person shall not be treated as ordinarily resident in Hong Kong while employed as a domestic helper who is from outside Hong Kong\\".Chiu, Austin (22 August 2011). \\"Residency definition challenged\\" South China Morning Post In 2011, the issue of foreign workers applying for Hong Kong residency was debated; since one million families live under the poverty line in the territory, some political parties argued that Hong Kong has insufficient welfare funding to support 300,000 foreign workers if they can apply for public housing and social-welfare benefits. The Court of First Instance found in Vallejos v Commissioner of Registration that this definition of \\"ordinarily resident\\" contravenes Article 24 of the Basic Law. The latter stipulates, \\"Persons not of Chinese nationality who have entered Hong Kong with valid travel documents, have ordinarily resided in Hong Kong for a continuous period of not less than seven years and have taken Hong Kong as their place of permanent residence before or after the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\\", feeding speculation that domestic helpers could obtain the right of abode.Yau, Cannix (1 March 2003). \\"Fighting to stay\\" . The Standard Retrieved 10 October 2011 An appeal was made to the Court of Appeal of the High Court, which overturned the judgment of the Court of First Instance. The plaintiffs then appealed to the Court of Final Appeal, which ruled against them in a unanimous judgment. = Two-week rule = The government requires foreign domestic helpers to leave Hong Kong within two weeks of the termination of their employment contract, unless they find another employer (the two-week rule). According to Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor, this is a form of discrimination against foreign domestic helpers (who are almost all Southeast Asian); this limitation is not enforced for other foreign workers. The two-week rule has been condemned by two United Nations committees: the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. According to human-rights groups, the two-week rule may pressure workers to remain with abusive employers. In 2005, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights urged the government to \\"review the existing 'two-week rule' ... and to improv[e] the legal protection and benefits for foreign domestic workers so that they are in line with those afforded to local workers, particularly with regard to wages and retirement benefits.\\"Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Concluding observations on the People's Republic of China (including Hong Kong and Macao), UN Doc. E/C.12/1/Add.107, 13 May 2005, para95. The following year, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women called on the government to \\"repeal the 'two-week rule' and to implement a more flexible policy regarding foreign domestic workers. It also calls upon the state party to strengthen its control of employment agencies and to provide migrant workers with easily accessible avenues of redress against abuse by employers and permit them to stay in the country while seeking redress.\\"457 Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, Concluding comments on China, UN Doc. CEDAW/C/CHN/CO/6, 25 August 2006, para42. The two-week and live-in rules were criticised by the United Nations Human Rights Committee in 2013. = Abuse by employers = Although the Hong Kong government has enacted legislation which nominally protects migrant workers, recourse is time-consuming and the costs considerable. The legal process can take up to 15 months to reach the District Court or Labour Tribunal, during which workers have no income. Welfare groups have expressed concerns about the treatment of this segment of the Hong Kong workforce, and the 2014 Erwiana Sulistyaningsih abuse case (which attracted international news headlines) focused on the plight of foreign workers in the territory. Thousands took to the streets, demanding justice for Sulistyaningsih. Although the government calls her case an isolated one, welfare groups say that many workers are victims of \\"modern-day slavery\\" and abuse by employers. Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor reported that a substantial percentage of workers are mistreated by their employers; of 2,500 workers interviewed, at least 25 percent said they had experienced violations of their contract (including pay less than the MAW and being denied their mandatory weekly day of rest and statutory holidays). More than 25 percent had also experienced physical and verbal abuse, including a \\"significant incidence\\" of sexual abuse. According to Caritas Hong Kong, their Asian Migrant Worker Social Service Project helpline received over four thousand calls from workers and 53 workers received assistance to remain in Hong Kong and pursue their claims. According to Belthune House executive director Adwina Antonio, the shelter dealt with 7,000 cases of alleged abuse in the first three-quarters of 2013 (compared with 3,000 for all of 2012). Contributing factors include \\"artificially low wages\\" and the live-in requirement. Many workers accumulate six to twelve months' debt to intermediaries for commissions, although these commissions are limited by law to 10 percent of the first month's pay. The ease with which foreign workers may be deported and the difficulty of finding employment abroad deters them from reporting violations or discrimination.  Live-in requirement  Since workers are required to live with their employers, they are vulnerable to working long hours; according to Amnesty International and welfare groups, some workers routinely work 16 to 18 hours a day and have no escape from abuse. = Philippine government policy = Filipino workers have protested Philippine government targeting of overseas Filipino workers, and a 1982 protest opposed Executive Order No. 857 (EO-857) implemented by Ferdinand Marcos. According to the order, overseas contract workers were required to remit 50 to 70 percent of their total earnings through authorised government channels only. Migrant-worker groups say that overseas Filipino workers must pay up to PHP150,000 ($3,400) in government and recruiting-agency fees before they can leave the country. In 2007, the Philippine government proposed a law requiring workers to submit to a \\"competency training and assessment program\\" which would cost them PHP10,000 to P15,000 (US$215 to US$320) – about half their average monthly salary (typically US$450). According to the Philippine Department of Labor and Employment, the policy would help protect domestic overseas workers from abuse by employers. Government agencies receive a total of about PHP21 billion ($470 million) a year from foreign workers in police clearances, National Bureau of Investigation and passport fees, membership in the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration, local health insurance and Philippine Overseas Employment Agency and Home Development Mutual Fund fees. Although charges by Indonesian agencies for dormitory housing, lessons in Cantonese, housework and Chinese cuisine were capped at about HK$14,000 by the government in 2012, interest is excluded from the cap. In 2012, Bloomberg reporters suggested that many agencies contract with workers to convert sums owed before their arrival in Hong Kong into \\"advances\\" from moneylenders (bypassing Hong Kong law). Since Hong Kong remains one of the more democratic states that migrant workers go for employment, it is also a safeguard for political activism. Since the Filipino government's policies of remittance and services have been instituted there have been protests by those that have traveled to Hong Kong in hopes of catching the attention of the governments where these workers originate. In 2005, the Consulate Hopping Protest and the Hall of Shame Awards were some of the first events organized by domestic service workers. During these events, hundreds of domestic workers marched through the streets of Hong Kong up to several consulates, including the United States, China, the Philippines, and Indonesia, to give \\"awards\\" to the heads of office. These awards were fabricated with jokes and slanders of their grievances to the heads of state of the respected consulates. Constable, Nicole. “Migrant Workers and the Many States of Protest in Hong Kong.” Critical Asian Studies 41, no. 1 (March 1, 2009): 143–64 = Indonesian government policy = The Indonesian consulate requires Indonesian domestic workers to use the services of employment agencies. The consulate can do this because the Hong Kong Immigration Department will only accept applications for employment visas that have been endorsed by consulates. = Hong Kong government policy = According to Time, the two-week rule and live-in requirement protect Hong Kong employers of foreign workers. The government argues that the two-week rule is needed to maintain immigration control, preventing job-hopping and imported workers working illegally after their contracts end. \\"However, it does not preclude the workers concerned from working in Hong Kong again after returning to their place of domicile.\\"Legislative Council Panel on Manpower, \\"Intermediary Charges for Foreign Domestic Helpers\\", LC Paper No. CB(2)1356/12-13(03), 18 June 2013, para11.

The government implies that in the absence of these rules, workers can easily leave unsatisfactory employers (creating the disruption of having to find a new employee and incurring an additional fees for a new contract). In early 2014, the government further impeded labour mobility by no longer renewing the visas of workers who change employers more than three times in a year. Hong Kong regards the Erwiana Sulistyaningsih case as isolated, and its labour minister pledged to increase regulation, enforcement and employment-agency inspections. It has conducted several raids on migrant workers accused of not living at their employer's residence.\\"Hong Kong domestic helpers arrested in crackdown on 'live-out' maids\\". South China Morning Post, 28 January 2015 (subscription) However, Robert Godden of Amnesty Asia-Pacific said: \\"The specifics, many of the factors leading to the abuse [of Erwiana], can be applied to thousands of migrant domestic workers: underpayment, restrictions on movement; you can see that she was heavily indebted by the illegal recruitment fees charged by the agency, and you can see that she didn't know how to access justice.\\" In 2014, the Labour Department prosecuted an employer who allegedly abused Rowena Uychiat during her nine-month employment. In March 2016, an NGO, Justice Centre, reported its findings that deemed one domestic worker in six in Hong Kong to have been forced into labour. It criticised the government for being in denial that Hong Kong is a source, destination and transit area for human trafficking and forced labour, and said Hong Kong lags behind other countries in having a comprehensive set of laws and policies to tackle forced labour or trafficking.

It is named after Chief Kamiakin of the Yakama tribe. Most of the park's consist of timberland on the northern slopes of Kamiak Butte. The mountain itself is an \\"island,\\" consisting of Precambrian quartzite projecting approximately above the surrounding wheat fields. The reddish rocks once formed the bed of an ancient sea, and the grains of sand embedded in them can still be seen glittering in the sun. Later in its geological history, Kamiak Butte became part of a mountain range which was eventually nearly engulfed by the Cenozoic lava flows that covered most of Eastern Washington in a layer of basalt. The region's intensive wheat and lentil farming has made Kamiak Butte an important haven for indigenous plant and animal species. Over 170 plant species, 140 bird species, and 30 mammal species have been observed inside the park. For most visitors, the park's chief attraction is the Pine Ridge Trail, a loop which begins at a parking area and climbs through evergreen forestland to an exposed ridge. The trail continues along the ridge, affording views of the surrounding Palouse country before dropping back into the forest. A short \\"summit spur\\" leads to the mountain's highest point - a rocky promontory on the west side with an elevation of . Camping is available all year, except during periods of drought, when it is often prohibited due to fire danger. Interpretive programs are offered in the spring and summer months; other amenities include an amphitheater, picnic tables, outdoor grills, covered shelters, restrooms, and a playground. For ham/amateur radio operators, two linked repeaters are near the top of the mountain. The frequencies are 146.74 MHz, with a 600 kHz negative offset (the 2 meter repeater), and 53.75 MHz, with a 1.7 MHz negative offset, and a PL Tone of 100 Hz (the 6 meter repeater).

Named after Greek mythology figure Prometheus, she was originally laid down as a collier on 18 October 1907 at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California; launched on 5 December 1908; and commissioned 15 January 1910 as USS Ontario (Fleet Collier No. 2). Service history =1910-1924= Ontario served with a merchant complement until she decommissioned on 7 April 1913 to undergo conversion to a repair ship. After conversion, she recommissioned 23 December 1914 as USS Prometheus (Repair Ship No. 2). After a cruise to Alaskan waters in 1915, she was assigned to duty with the Atlantic Fleet, 16 May 1916 operating out of Norfolk, Virginia and bound for Bermuda, remaining there until 29 January 1918. While at Bermuda she was ordered to join the Naval forces at Brest, France to provide repair services, and she did a commendable job until she sailed on 16 January 1919 for New York City. Upon arrival at New York she was assigned to Battleship Force 1 for duty in conjunction with the upkeep of vessels engaged in overseas transportation of troops. She was classified as AR-3 on 17 July 1920. Prometheus sailed from New York on 1 September 1920 with orders to tow the , disabled at Cuba, to Philadelphia. For her performance in this assignment she was commended by the Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet. Prometheus made additional cruises to Cuba in 1921 and 1923 while operating with the Atlantic Fleet. Prometheus transferred to the west coast early in 1923, arriving at San Pedro, California on 17 April. She operated along the Pacific coast as far north as Washington, until she decommissioned on 4 October 1924 at Bremerton. =1942-1946= Prometheus repairs a battleship and two destroyers Prometheus recommissioned on 15 May 1942 at the Bremerton Navy Yard and following shakedown, she sailed from San Francisco, California on 9 August for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii where she took in tow the drydock ARD–2 and proceeded to Noumea, New Caledonia. She rendered repair services from the largest warship, the , to the smallest amphibious craft, which were beginning to figure so prominently in the island-hopping campaign towards the Japanese home islands. Her only breaks, from a steady demand of hard work from her crew, came on infrequent trips to Sydney, Australia. Following the push westward across the Pacific, Prometheus moved in the Spring of 1944 from San Francisco to Tulagi, and after a month’s stay there, where she catered primarily to escort carriers, she went to Florida Island and then in September to Manus. She received orders on 25 September to proceed to Kossol Passage, Palau Islands where she came under enemy fire for the first time from a Japanese midget sub. She opened fire with her 3\\"/50 caliber deck gun and sunk the sub. She and her crew suffered no damage. Prometheus departed Kossol on 21 January 1945 and moved to the now famous Ulithi anchorage to help ready the Fleet for the Iwo Jima campaign and the Okinawa strikes. By 19 February she had moved again to San Pedro Bay, Leyte to ready ships for the take-over invasion of Okinawa. Though her main responsibility was to repair ships and craft of the Amphibious Force, she gained wide acclaim for the excellence of repairs and alterations made to the and in the Philippines. War's end found the old repair ship at Guiuan, Samar in the process of commissioning the cargo ship Justin, formerly the SS Gus Darnell, which required bomb damage repair and alterations to fit her for Navy service during the occupation period ahead. Prometheus continued her rigorous schedule at Okinawa and Hong Kong during the Asian occupation, returning to San Francisco at the year’s end. At San Francisco she performed decommissioning work on vessels sent there for disposal until she, herself, decommissioned on 1 July 1946. =Decommissioning and sale= Prometheus was delivered to the WSA and simultaneously to the Maritime Commission Reserve Fleet for lay up on 16 July at Puget Sound, Washington. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 31 July. By 26 August 1949 she had been completely stripped, and she was sold on 29 August 1950 to Zidell Shipwrecking Company and subsequently scrapped. Prometheus earned one battle star for Pacific service in World War II.

The book concerns D'Amour's trip into Hell to rescue his friend from The Hell Priest, a character from Barker's previous works. Summary The world's last remaining magicians gather to resurrect Ragowski, a recently deceased member of their order who was killed by the Hell Priest. Ragowski informs them that the Priest is determined to obtain every source of magic known to man, and that their only hope of avoiding his fate is to give the Priest the location of all of their grimoires and talismans. The Hell Priest arrives, having been alerted by the spell that caused Ragowski's resurrection, and proceeds to degrade and massacre all of the magicians save for one, Felixson, whom he enslaves to use as a human servant. In New Orleans, paranormal detective Harry D'Amour travels to the home of a recently deceased magician who hired him via medium Norma Paine in order to destroy evidence of his occult activities before his family can discover them. Harry learns that the assignment was a trap set by the Hell Priest to kill him, in order to eliminate Harry as a potential obstacle to completing his mission. Harry is rescued by Dale, an elderly Southern man who experiences moments of precognition. Dale sends Harry back to New York City to attend to Norma, who tells Harry that a monumental event is about to occur in the spirit world. Harry enlists the help of his friend Caz to move Norma to a safehouse operated by their mutual acquaintance, Lana. Joined by Dale, they attempt to transport Norma, only to witness the opening of a portal to Hell in Manhattan. The Priest emerges and absconds with Norma, telling Harry that a momentous event in Hell's history is about to occur and that, after Harry's survival of the assassination attempt, he has decided that he will be the perfect individual to write the Priest's personal account of the events. Harry and his group - dubbed the Harrowers - discover that Lucifer has disappeared and that Hell has developed into a thriving civilization in his absence. They learn that the Priest has been using his accrued knowledge of magic to kill Hell's various ruling classes, in order to eliminate any obstacles on his pilgrimage into a forbidden region of Hell called the Wastelands. The Harrowers follow the Priest into the Wastelands, where they discover a tribe of inbred demons waiting to take them across a cursed lake to a tiny island in the center. The Priest and Norma have already secured passage to the island, where the Priest hopes to find a rumored cathedral - Lucifer's throne room - where he can experience a spiritual revelation by holding audience with the Devil. The Harrowers and the Priest discover that the cathedral is in fact Lucifer's tomb, erected after he had committed suicide due to being forced to live away from the presence of God. Enraged, the Priest strips Lucifer's body of its armor, dons it himself, and declares himself the new Lord of Hell. Armies led by the surviving generals of Hell raid the cathedral and attack the Priest, but, powered by Lucifer's armor, he easily defeats most of them. The removal of the armor inadvertently resurrects Lucifer, who, enraged that he must once more endure existence without God, engages the Priest in battle. Although the Priest seemingly defeats Lucifer, the angel's immortal body reconstitutes itself and he disembowels the Priest. Lucifer announces his intention to destroy Hell as the Harrowers and Norma, along with the surviving demons, flee the cathedral. The desiccated remnants of the Hell Priest confront the Harrowers on the shores of the lake, where the Priest blinds Harry and rapes Norma to death before fleeing. The Harrowers escape Hell after discovering a wormhole that leads them to a desert road in Arizona. Meanwhile, Lucifer crushes all of Hell and its inhabitants beneath its collapsing stone sky, before traveling to New York and resolving to make a name for himself. Angels from Heaven come to observe the ruins of Hell. Later, an unseen force eliminates Hell from existence, destroying the Hell Priest with it. In New York, Harry — permanently blind and sinking into alcoholism — is contacted by Norma's ghost, who tells him that she's gone on to Paradise and that she wants him to take her place as a medium who comforts the recently deceased. Taking up residence in her old office, Harry is overwhelmed by the sudden appearance of a throng of ghosts wanting his assistance, before seeing the ghost of a small child clinging to an older woman. Feeling compassion, Harry comforts the child and tells the pair that they can trust him to help. Development The novel had a long gestation period, with Barker talking as early as 1998 about wanting to write a story in which he killed the Pinhead character. Updates to the novel's progress appeared on Barker's website sporadically over the course of the next twelve years, mostly related to the book's progressively swelling length; at one point, Barker predicted that his completed manuscript would reach 1,000-2,000 pages.Publisher Found for Clive Barker's Scarlet Gospels Updates culminated in a June 18, 2010 Twitter announcement that \\"the 243,000 words of The Scarlet Gospels merely lacks a publisher\\". Due to the length of the completed work, the book underwent heavy editing between 2010 and 2013, with Barker announcing on Sept 9, 2013, that although no date had been set for release, \\"The Scarlet Gospels are finished.\\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=427743314001058&set;=a.426815940760462.1073741831.284756614966396&type;=1&theater; In 2014, Barker announced the book's publication on his official website with the message: “Clive is delighted to announce that St Martin's Press has acquired world English rights to publish The Scarlet Gospels, his upcoming novel featuring Pinhead and Harry D'Amour.\\" St Martin's Press released the book on 19 May 2015.https://www.amazon.com/The-Scarlet-Gospels-Clive- Barker/dp/1250055806/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1410876937&sr;=8-1&keywords;=the+scarlet+gospels Prequel Hellraiser: The Toll is a 2018 horror novella written by Mark Alan Miller and published by Subterranean Press, from a story by Clive Barker. It serves as a sequel to the 1986 novella The Hellbound Heart and a prequel to The Scarlet Gospels, both written by Barker, set thirty years after the events of the former. It focuses on the returning Kirsty Singer, as she once again comes face-to-face with the Hell Priest. Meanwhile, the Priest calls upon a first witness for his plan seen in The Scarlet Gospels. The Toll evolved from the partially written short story Heaven's Reply by Clive Barker that had been in development dating back to 2010. At one point, Heaven's Reply was integrated into a screenplay for a Hellraiser reboot, which would have featured the creator of the Lament Configuration–the Frenchman Lemarchand–and would have opened in the fictional location of Devil's Island. The script was turned in to Dimension Films, but did not move forward. According to Barker, \\"That was the last anyone heard until news of a sequel surfaced.\\" When Barker didn't know where to take the short story, it was suggested by his collaborators that the plot tie into the fictitious events of The Scarlet Gospels. After considering how to do it, Clive Barker's collaborator and author Mark Alan Miller backwards engineered the story into the novella Hellraiser: The Toll to be published by Subterranean Press. The novella received a limited release in February 2018, in two separate editions–a limited edition, with a quantity of 724 clothbound copies made available, and a lettered edition, with an availability of 26 leatherbound copies. It was released in audiobook format on 6 November 2018, narrated by horror film director Tom Holland.

PacINET is a regional conference for practitioners, developers, researchers and those interested in Information and Communications Technology (or ICT) from all sectors to exchange information on the system design, enabling technologies, and anecdotal experiences related to the use of Information and Communications Technology in the Pacific Islands. It has evolved to become the Pacific's largest regular Information and Communications Technology conference.  Structure  The PacINET conference is composed of several types of contributions including Paper Presentations, Demonstrations, Tutorials and Workshops, Panel Discussions and Invited Talks. Traditionally PacINET was a technical conference, but due to member requests (and to cater for the different member groups present at every conference), from the 2007 conference onwards, PacINET was split into dedicated technical and non-technical streams. This was deemed to better serve member needs and travel/work schedules. Typically, there are various sub-themes centred on the general conference theme and presentations are made on topics of interest to ICT in the Pacific including (but not limited to): *Client-Server Computing *Computer Applications *Database Systems *e-Government *eHealth *Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing *ICT for Development *ICT Policy *Internet Security *Open Source Systems *Networking and Routing *Protocols and technical standards *Risk Management *Rural/Remote Telecommunications *VoIP and Convergence  PacINET Forum  The PacINET Forum has been a regular feature since the 2005 conference and features guest panellists discussing issues of relevance to ICT in the Pacific. Past Forum topics include Natural Disasters and how can ICT help? (PacINET 2005) and Building the Digital Pacific (PacINET 2006). Past Panellists have included technology luminaries such as Vint Cerf and regional leaders such as Jimmie Rodgers.

It is commonly known as the triangle palm. It is indigenous to the Madagascan rainforest. Some specimens grow to a height of some in the wild. It is relatively new to cultivation however, so outside its native habitat it rarely achieves anything like that height. The leaves are about in length, growing almost upright from the trunk and arching gracefully outward about a metre from their tips. The leaf bases are arranged in three vertical columns set about 120 degrees apart on the main stem, forming a triangular shape in cross section. This shape has given rise to the palm's common name. The inflorescences branch out from the axils of the lower leaves. They produce yellow and green flowers that later produce round black fruit about in diameter. The palm is a fine ornamental plant and is most valuable as a specimen tree or accent plant when grown out in the open to display show its remarkable shape to best advantage. In suitable climates it blooms all year. What with its colourful flowers and fruit and shapely habit, it is unusually showy for a palm. It prefers full sun and regular watering, although it is not vulnerable to occasional dryness and partial shade. Over-watering and poor drainage are far greater hazards than drought. For example, the palm is best suited to well drained sandy soil. Dypsis decaryi does not transplant well, so it is a bad choice for commercial field growing. However, it is a fast grower once established, and its seed normally germinates within a month of being planted, so propagation by seed is a good option. Threatened status Although this species is now commonly cultivated in a variety of climates, there are only about 1,000 individuals left in its native habitat of a small area in Andohahela National Park, southern Madagascar. It is threatened both by fire and the harvesting of its seeds for export.

He began school at the age of 4, and started writing at 6.http://www.geocities.ws/ruti_v/biograph.htmhttp://www.banipal.co.uk/contributors/70/samir- naqqash/ When he was 13, he and his family moved to Israel, and had to live under comparatively harsh conditions in an absorption center. Several years later, his father died, and this had a strong effect on him. Determined to leave Israel to find himself, Naqqash lived in Turkey, Iran, Lebanon, Egypt, India, and the United Kingdom from 1958 to 1962, but faced difficulties and was forced to return to Israel, where he took various jobs.http://www.geocities.ws/ruti_v/biograph.htmhttp://www.banipal.co.uk/contributors/70/samir- naqqash/ In the 1970s, he studied at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and received his degree in Arabic literature. He was well known in the Arab world and among the Iraqi community in Israel, but only one of his works was translated into Hebrew. Naqqash won the Israeli Prime Ministerial Award for Arabic literature. Naqqash often called himself an Arab who believed in Judaism. In the documentary \\"Forget Baghdad\\" (2002), he said that he had not wanted to go to Israel but was taken there in handcuffs by the Jewish Agency. He never felt at home in Israel, and considered himself an Iraqi in exile. He continued to publish and write in Arabic. He saw himself as part of the great tradition of Arabic folklore and literature. He was often criticized for his Arabic sounding first name but he refused to change it. After his death, Iraqi expatriates declared their wish to have him buried in Iraq, reasoning that he has shown more dedication to Iraq than any other expatriate. Naqqash was married, and had one daughter and two sons.

It is also used in Sudan, and the coffee itself is called buna (جبنة in Arabic). Overview Jebena with various colorful designs for sale in Asmara, Eritrea An Eritrean jebena The jebena is most commonly used in the traditional coffee ceremony known as the buna, where women serve coffee to their guests in small clay pots or ceramic pots, alongside an assortment of small snacks such as popcorn, peanuts and the traditional himbasha. It is usually made of clay and has a neck and pouring spout, and a handle where the neck connects with the base. The jebenas used in Ethiopia commonly have a spout, whereas those utilized in Eritrea usually do not. It is of a medium size, with a neck, a spout and a handle, as well as some regional variants possessing straw lids, and an extra spout to pour the coffee out of, as well as different shaped bases. Typically, when the coffee boils up through the jebena's neck, it is poured in and out of another container to cool it. The liquid is then poured back into the jebena until it bubbles up. To pour the coffee from the jebena, a filter made from horsehair or other material is placed in the spout of the jebena to prevent the grounds from escaping. In Ethiopia, a small pottery cup called a sini or finjal is used to contain the coffee poured from the jebena. In Ethiopia they use a slightly different variation, theirs having a separate spout lower on the pot for pouring out the coffee. In Eritrea the jebena has only one spout at the top, used both for filling with water and grinds and for pouring out the coffee. It is considered a staple household object in Ethiopia, with decorations and designs being used to represent social status. It has a close association to the buna, and the rich history of coffee in Ethiopia. There is a small restaurant in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, made in an image of an Ethiopian jebena figure.  History  According to local mythology, the most commonly held belief on the origin of the coffee bean was that it was first discovered by a goat farmer in Ethiopia after noticing the effect it had on his goats after consuming the beans. Coffee has since been brewed and served alongside the jebena in Ethiopia since approximately 1100 A.D. The origin of the jebena and its use in the buna is unclear and there are conflicting myths and legends on the initial origin of the jebena in the buna. The buna and jebena are endemic in the Horn of Africa region, with different regions having different rituals surrounding both, specifically Eritrea and Ethiopia. The jebena holds a significant place in Ethiopian and Eritrean culture. Families will usually have only one, and it is normally passed down from generation to generation as a practical, ornate heirloom. The jebena can be described as an ‘artifact’, as opposed to a tool, as it represents significant shared cultural experience and status in Ethiopian and Eritrean culture.  Prevalence  = Ethiopia = Brewing coffee is tied closely to womanhood in Ethiopia and on the Horn of Africa. When brewing coffee with the jebena, the youngest woman of the family is always the one to initiate the process. Brewing coffee in the jebena is also a distinctly social event, where during the time it takes to prepare the beans and brew the coffee, families will socialise. The ornate nature of a jebena makes it a coveted item for a family, with potters in Ethiopia often not having access to tools such as pottery wheels. As a result, a highly decorated jebena is a sign of wealth and status amongst families in Ethiopia and Eritrea. In Ethiopian culture, when coffee is being made for the buna in the jebena, it is time for women to socialise and gather away from men. This has created a close association between woman-hood and coffee making. Women are expected to take great pride in their coffee ceremony and in taking care of their jebena, and great social expectation is placed upon the apparatus used in the ritual. Because of the ritualistic nature of the buna, if a jebena is not used to prepare and boil the coffee, by all accounts, a ‘buna’ is not taking place. It is considered rude for a guest to have any less than three cups of coffee from the jebena when a buna is taking place and it is considered good luck for a participant to consume all three cups of coffee in the buna. A household will usually participate in the buna three times a day, preparing a pot of coffee in the jebena each time. On each occasion, the woman preparing the buna will announce to all persons in the household that it is taking place, and will invite people to enjoy the ritual before beginning to roast the beans and starting the process of making coffee in the jebena. = Migrants of Ethiopia = Ethiopians displaced around the world by the military coups during the 70’s and 80’s still participate in making coffee in the jebena for the buna daily, despite no longer being in Ethiopia. It is suggested the jebena, despite not necessarily being an item that is worth a large sum of money, is of great sentimental value, as it represents a tangible connection they possess with their home nation. Ethiopian Families in western nations such as the United Kingdom and the United States will continue to make coffee in the jebena for buna, using western tools such as stainless steel pans to roast the beans, and mechanised bean grinders, because of this connection it brings with their home nation. The jebena is also tied closely to womanhood amongst migrant families. The jebena represents a delineated routine of the Ethiopian coffee ceremony, and despite families not being in their home nation, the ritual of the buna is negated by the absence of a jebena. Because of this, the long time it takes to brew coffee in the jebena allows migrant families time to connect and furthers the collective identity women and families have built with their home nation. In her book The Comforts of Coffee: The Role of the Coffee Ceremony in Ethiopians' Efforts to Cope with Social Upheaval during the Derg Regime (1974-1991), D. Daniel writes of the jebena: > Arguably the most important feature of the ceremony is the jebena, the > coffee pot. The jebena is made from clay and has a round bottom with a > narrow spout and a handle on the side. Its shape and design are reflective > of the ethnic identity of the host, whether it has a large bottom or an > additional spout to pour out the coffee. While certain elements of the > coffee ceremony can be tweaked, modernized or all together left out, the > jebena has remained the center piece throughout Ethiopia and abroad.  Appearance  The jebena has a long, neck-like spout, and a handle to pour with. The base of the jebena is normally large and circular, with a flat bottom so that it can balance on the surfaces without falling over. The top of the jebena is usually curved so that pouring in water and coffee grounds is easier. The neck of the spout in the jebena is intentionally very narrow, acting as a strainer so no grounds come out when pouring the coffee, so that the coffee requires less straining through a sieve. It is normally placed on a small decorative cloth throne or on hay to stop its base, which has usually just been exposed to flames, from burning anything. There is also normally a plug at the top, made of cloth, straw or clay, to stop any water from spilling out. More modern jebena's may be made of porcelain or metal, resembling a more traditional western coffee pot. The size of the jebena is usually approximately 20-45 centimetres tall. This is because it is normal to refill the jebena and brew more coffee multiple times in one coffee ceremony, so a large pot is not required. The appearance of the jebena differs depending on the region of Ethiopia and Africa it is found. Most commonly, it will be made of locally sourced clay by an elderly female. Villages often specialise in making specific types of jebena’s, as well as the cup used in the buna, known as the ‘sini’. After being formed into the desired shape, designs and patterns are drawn into the still wet clay. Once dry, it is normally painted black or brown. Ornate decorations, such as gold or silver plating, and decorative painting, are also common where the jebena is used as status or social symbol in Ethiopian society. These styles of decorations are usually reserved for the upper class and royalty. Other decorations consist of painting the outside different, bright, colours or traditional dot paintings. Regional variations also exist, with different main styles existing, the Ethiopian and the Eritrean: * The Ethiopian varian has a separate spout to pour the water into and a spout to pour the coffee out from. * Eritrean variants of the jebena are made in a similar fashion, but only possess one spout for water to be poured in from, and for coffee to be poured out from. The clay cups used to serve coffee are normally made of the same clay, and are decorated/presented in a similar manner to the jebena, and are known as ‘sini’. They are normally placed on a metal tray, and this metal tray is used to serve the coffee to participants in the buna.  Usage  Coffee is brewed in a jebena three times a day, in the morning, at noon and in the evening. When coffee is being prepared, it is normally time for men and women to mingle and converse separately. The matriarch or the youngest woman of a household is traditionally the person who initiates the buna and begins the process of preparing the coffee beans to be brewed in the jebena. Coffee beans are washed, roasted and then ground by women, and often mixed with spices before the coffee begins to be brewed. After the beans have been roasted and ground, which can take up to forty five minutes, the coffee is brewed in the jebena and served in three separate stages. While the beans are being roasted in preparation to be put in the jebena, popcorn or other small snacks are passed around. Of the three stages, the first is known as the awel, the second, the kale’i and the third, the baraka. The first of these stages, the coffee is strong and potent, with each preceding serving having slightly more dilute coffee. In total all three stages usually take two hours. The water in the jebena, along with the coffee grounds, is then boiled on a medium sized fire made with hot coals on a fire pit on the ground. When the coffee is finished brewing, it is poured into small clay or porcelain cups through a sieve to catch the fine coffee ground, and served with the small snacks that were consumed while the coffee was prepared. Small cups are used so that three small servings of coffee can be drunk, allowing participants to consume all three separate stages of brewing. While the coffee is being prepared in the jebena, a woman will often light incense to create a more relaxing atmosphere in the home, and to further complete the ritual of the buna. Usually, no sugar, butter or milk is added to the coffee both while it is brewing and once it has been served out of the jebena, and the coffee is served to persons sitting on the ground, with the host preparing a tray of cups to deliver to individuals. Westernised versions of this ceremony continue through the same steps, but instead use European tools to complete steps, such as roasting the beans on a stovetop, heating the jebena on a gas stove and serving in porcelain coffee cups, instead of the traditional sini.

He joined Coil in 1999 and remained with them until the band’s cessation following the death of singer John Balance in 2004. He worked on several albums and performed live with the group at The Royal Festival Hall, The Barbican in London, and numerous venues throughout Europe. Brown formed Cyclobe in 1996 with his partner Stephen Thrower (also a one-time member of Coil). They released their first album Luminous Darkness in 1999, named after a series of paintings by their friend, the filmmaker Derek Jarman. Cyclobe went on to release a number of albums, most notably Wounded Galaxies Tap at The Window (2010). The group seldom perform live: their first and only concert in the United Kingdom was held at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London in 2012, at the invitation of singer and artist Anohni, who performed with them for this occasion. They went on to play the CTM Festival in Berlin, Poland’s Unsound Festival, and the Punkt Festival in Norway, the latter curated by Brian Eno. Brown's first book Haunted Air was published in 2010 by Jonathan Cape, with an introduction by David Lynch and an afterword by Geoff Cox. In 2015, Brown contributed to the album Who Is the Sender? by singer songwriter Bill Fay, appearing on the opening track \\"The Geese Are Flying Westward\\". In 2016 he played hurdy-gurdy for the English folk singer Shirley Collins on her album Lodestar, released by Domino Records. The album, Collins’ first since For as Many as Will (1978), was recorded and pre-produced by Brown and Stephen Thrower in the singer’s cottage in Lewes, East Sussex. Among his contributions, Brown composed an original piece for the album, \\"The Split Ash Tree\\". In 2017 he performed a series of UK concerts with Shirley Collins as a member of her group. In collaboration with fellow Cyclobe member Michael J York, Brown contributed a soundtrack to the documentary film The Ballad of Shirley Collins (2017), directed by Rob Curry and Tim Plester.

It forms part of the Canadian Special Operations Forces Command. As a special forces unit, the regiment's roles include conducting complex or difficult raids, capturing strategic facilities and undertaking reconnaissance. It is also capable of working with the armed forces of other countries.  Unit history  Members of the regiment during a freefall jump out of a U.S. Air Force C-17 Globemaster III during Emerald Warrior 2013, Hurlburt Field, Florida. The unit traces its roots to the First Special Service Force (FSSF), the Canadian-American special forces unit that was stood up in 1942 and earned the \\"Devil's Brigade\\" moniker for daring night raids on German forces at the Anzio beachhead. CSOR perpetuates the battle honours of the FSSF. Recruiting for the new unit took place in early 2006, and the first CSOR selection course took place with approximately 175 candidates. On 13 August 2006, an official stand-up ceremony for the Canadian Special Operations Regiment took place at the unit's home station, Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Petawawa, with approximately 250 soldiers participating. The ceremony included a skills demonstration including rappelling from helicopters, and both static and freefall parachuting. It was also announced that the second training serial of CSOR recruits would take place in early 2007. The first Commanding Officer and Regimental Sergeant-Major of CSOR were Lieutenant Colonel (LCol) Jamie Hammond and Chief Warrant Officer (CWO) Gerald Scheidl. Subsequent command teams were LCol Greg Smith and CWO Daniel Brissette, LCol John Vass and CWO Daniel Brissette, LCol Hank Szelecz and CWO Tom Verner and LCol Steven Hunter and CWO L. Mike Gauley. The regiment suffered its first casualty on 24 June 2011: Master-Corporal Francis Roy died in a non-combat incident while deployed in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan. In 2013, the unit competed in an international Special Forces Competition held in Jordan, coming in 3rd place after Chinese Special Police teams took 1st and 2nd place. In March 2015, Sgt Andrew Joseph Doiron was killed by friendly fire while serving on Operation Impact in Iraq. Operations The regiment maintained a presence in Afghanistan from 2006 to 2014 in support of Canada's mission in Afghanistan. Under the auspices of the Anti-Crime Capacity Building Program of Global Affairs Canada, CSOR conducted training with both the Jamaican Defence Force and the Belizean Defence Force, culminating in Exercise Tropical Dagger. CSOR participates in Exercise Flintlock, a special operations Forces–focused exercise planned, coordinated and executed by African partner nations and sponsored by United States Africa Command. CSOR participates in the CANSOFCOM commitment to Operation Impact, the Canadian Armed Forces' support to the international military intervention against ISIL in Iraq and Syria. In the execution of its mandate, CSOR personnel have been recognized for their operational excellence, such as receipt of the Star and Medals of Military Valour, Chief of Defence Staff Commendations, mentions-in-dispatches, Meritorious Service Decorations, among other honours and awards. Organization Canadian special operations soldier descends in front of Mt. Rainier onto Fort Lewis, Wash., with U.S. 1st Special Forces While the regiment is composed of personnel from the Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Navy and Royal Canadian Air Force, it is part of CANSOFCOM, a joint command reporting directly to the Chief Defence Staff, responsible for providing agile, high-readiness Special Operations Forces capable of operating across the spectrum of conflict at home and abroad. CANSOFCOM is composed of CSOR, 427 Special Operations Aviation Squadron, and the Canadian Special Operations Training Centre in Petawawa, Joint Task Force 2 (JTF-2) in Ottawa, and the Canadian Joint Incident Response Unit in Trenton. The current CSOR command team is Commanding Officer (CO), Lieutenant Colonel (LCol) Michael Laplante and Regimental Sergeant Major (RSM), Chief Warrant Officer Jeff Chalmer. Battle honours  Regimental culture  The CSOR badge represents many aspects of the culture and history of the regiment. The V-42 stiletto is recognized as the fighting knife of the FSSF and links CSOR to allied American special forces organizations and is the main CANSOFCOM symbol. The crossed arrows signify friendship and are a direct link to the 1st Canadian Special Service Battalion, which is viewed as the founding Canadian special operation forces unit. The laurel wreath defines the knowledge of SF operators as educators and captures the unique role of CSOR as warrior diplomats and teachers of foreign forces. The wings signify swiftness, exemplified in the unit's readiness to undertake operations around the world. The motto, , translates to \\"Let us dare\\". It encapsulates that the regiment will accept any task and will step up to any challenge that comes its way. The Canadian Special Operations Regiment was authorized the regimental standard by the Governor General, David Johnston, on 15 April 2015. CSOR's regimental march is \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\", a traditional British folk song thought to date back to the 16th century and popularized during the Napoleonic Wars during the 1800s. The regimental drink is whisky and was chosen in recognition of the regiment's lineage to the FSSF. On 5 December 1943, while stationed in Italy and during the Battle for Monte la Difensa, the FSSF went into a defensive posture once Monte la Difensa was secured. Colonel Robert T. Fredrick, commander of the FSSF, directed his assistant commander, Colonel Paul Adams, to get 15 cases of whisky to bolster the spirits of his soldiers. The men's rations were supplemented that night with whisky which greatly improved morale. The regimental drink is used to welcome newly badged special forces operators to the regiment and during mess dinners in order to toast the regiment. The special forces badge is awarded to personnel once they complete the Special Forces Course and become badge special forces operators. The arrowhead is symbolic of the FSSF, the V-42 symbolizes both the connection to the FSSF and allegiance to CANSOFCOM. The lightweight combat utility tool, referred to in the regiment as \\"the tomahawk\\", is issued to each special forces operator. In addition to being an element of their operational equipment, the tomahawk represents the great contribution of Indigenous peoples in Canada to the development of irregular and special warfare. The origin of the steel tomahawk comes from the boarding axes used by marines during naval combat. The design of the head was a proven utility item and if needed a combat weapon. Its use flourished by both French and British frontiersman as well as a trade item to Indigenous peoples. The first European military uses in North America came from the original French Marine Militia dispatched to New France and later was an issued item among British colonial regiments, specifically the colonial-raised ranger regiments, one of the most famous of which was Captain Rogers' Rangers who conducted scout and special operations missions during the French and Indian War. During the War of American Independence Captain Rogers fought for Britain against the Continental Army.

The text reads from top to bottom: ignition chamber, horizontal tank, piston rod, and fierce-fire oil tank cabinet installed form. From the Sancai Tuhui, 1609. The Fierce-fire Oil Cabinet (Chinese: 猛火油櫃 měng huǒ yóu guì) was a double-piston pump naphtha flamethrower first recorded to have been used in 919 AD in China, during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Petroleum had been used in China since the late Zhou dynasty in 5th century BC, but the distilled fierce fire oil, otherwise known as petrol or Greek fire in the west, was not used until the 10th century AD. According to Wu Renchen's Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, in 917 AD, the king of Wuyue sent fierce fire oil to the Khitans as a gift. The envoy explained that it could be used to attack cities and the Khitan ruler was delighted. The History of Liao gives an extended version of the account: According to Lin Yu's Wu-Yue Beishi (吳越備史, \\"The History of Wu and Yue\\"), the next appearance of fierce fire oil occurred in 919 AD when the two fleets of Wuyue and Wu met in battle. In the Battle of Langshan Jiang (Wolf Mountain River), the Wuyue fleet under Qian Chuanguan brought with them more than 500 dragon-like battleships and used \\"fire oil\\" to burn the enemy fleet. It was a great victory and they destroyed more than 400 enemy ships as well as capturing more than 7,000 men. Lin Yu goes on to explain appearance of the new weapon and the device used to deploy it: Joseph Needham believes that If the flamethrower used in 919 AD was of the same design as the one described in the later Wujing Zongyao in 1044, then it is also by implication the earliest known use of the slow match. Therefore also one of the first military applications of gunpowder. The following is a description of the flamethrower as provided by the Wujing Zongyao: Flamethrowers were also recorded to have been used in 976 AD when Song naval forces confronted the Southern Tang fleet on the Changjiang. Southern Tang forces attempted to use flamethrowers against the Song navy, but were accidentally consumed by their own fire when violent winds swept in their direction. The flamethrower was a well known device by the 11th century when it was joked that Confucian scholars knew it better than the classics. Both gunpowder and the fierce fire oil were produced under the Arsenals Administration of the Song dynasty. In the early 12th century AD, Kang Yuzhi recorded his memories of military commanders testing out fierce oil fire on a small lakelet. They would spray it about on the opposite bank that represented the enemy camp. The flames would ignite into a sheet of flame, destroying the wooden fortifications, and even killing the water plants, fishes and turtles.In 1126 AD, Li Gang used flamethrowers in an attempt to prevent the Jurchens from crossing the Yellow River. Illustrations and descriptions of mobile flamethrowers on four-wheel push carts were documented in the Wujing Zongyao, written in 1044 AD (its illustration redrawn in 1601 as well).

The bit is not the metal ring. Horse skull showing the large gap between the front teeth and the back teeth. The bit sits in this gap, and extends beyond from side to side. The bit is an important item of a horse's tack. It usually refers to the assembly of components that contacts and controls the horses mouth, and includes the shanks, rings, cheekpads and mullen, all described here below, but it also sometimes simply refers to the mullen, the piece that fits inside the horses mouth. The mullen extends across the horses mouth and rests on the bars, the region between the incisors and molars where there are no teeth. The bit is located on the horse's head by the , and which has itself several components to allow the most comfortable adjustment of bit location and control. The bit, bridle and reins function together to give control of the horse's head to the rider. The bit applies pressure to the horse's mouth, and reinforces the other control signals from the rider's legs and weight distribution. A well schooled horse needs little pressure on the bit from a skilled rider. Studies have indicated that soft, consistent bit contact between the rider and horse causes the animal less stress than intermittent or unpredictable contact. Basic types Although there are hundreds of design variations, the basic families of bits are defined by the way in which they use or do not use leverage. They include: *Direct pressure bits without leverage: Snaffle bit: Uses a bit ring at the bit mouthpiece to apply direct pressure on the bars, tongue and corner of the mouth. *Leverage bits: Curb bit: A bit that uses a type of lever called a shank that puts pressure not only on the mouth, but also on the poll and chin groove. Pelham bit: A single curb bit with two sets of reins attached to rings at the mouthpiece and end of the shank. Partly combines snaffle and curb pressure. Kimblewick or Kimberwicke: A hybrid design that uses a slight amount of mild curb leverage on a bit ring by use of set rein placement on the ring. *Bit combinations A type of bridle that carries two bits, a bradoon and a curb, and is ridden with two sets of reins is called a Weymouth or double bridle, after the customary use of the Weymouth-style curb bit in a double bridle. *Non-curb leverage designs: Gag bit: A bit that, depending on design, may outwardly resemble a snaffle or a curb, but with added slots or rings that provide leverage by sliding the bit up in the horse's mouth, a very severe design. *In-hand bits are designed for leading horses only, and include: Chifney anti-rearing bit: This is a semi-circular- shaped bit with three rings and a port or straight mouth piece used when leading horses. The port or straight piece goes inside the mouth, and the circular part lies under the jaw. The bit is attached to separate head piece or the head collar and the lead is clipped onto the bit and headcollar to limit the severity.Thoroughbred Racing SA: Definition Tattersall ring bitEdwards, E. Hartley, Saddlery, Country Life Limited, England, 1966 Horse- shoe stallion bit Bits are further described by the style of mouthpiece that goes inside the horse's mouth as well as by the type of bit ring or bit shank that is outside the mouth, to which the reins are attached. Types of headgear for horses that exert control with a noseband rather than a bit are usually called hackamores,Price, Steven D. (ed.) The Whole Horse Catalog: Revised and Updated New York:Fireside 1998 p. 153 though the term \\"bitless bridle\\" has become a popular colloquialism in recent years. History A Luristan bronze horse bit The riders of early domesticated horses probably used some type of bitless headgear made of sinew, leather, or rope.Howling, Kelly. \\"Bitless Reveolution\\". Equine Wellness, 2007. Archived from the original on April 11, 2008. Accessed February 26, 2008. Components of the earliest headgear may be difficult to determine, as the materials would not have held up over time. For this reason, no one can say with certainty which came first, the bitted or the bitless bridle. There is evidence of the use of bits, located in two sites of the Botai culture in ancient Kazakhstan, dated about 3500–3000 BC.Anthony, David W. and Dorcas Brown, 2000, \\"Eneolithic horse exploitation in the Eurasian steppes: diet, ritual and riding\\", Antiquity 74: 75-86. Nose rings appear on the equids portrayed on the Standard of Ur, circa 2600–2400 BC. To date, the earliest known artistic evidence of use of some form of bitless bridle comes in illustrations of Synian horseman, dated approximately 1400 BC.Miller, Robert M. and Rick Lamb. (2005) Revolution in Horsemanship. Lyons Press, p. 222 The first bits were made of rope, bone, horn, or hard wood. Metal bits came into use between 1300 and 1200 BC, originally made of bronze.Edwards, p. 17 In modern times, nickel was a favored material until about 1940, when stainless steel largely replaced it.Henderson, p. 117 Copper, aurigan and sweet iron (cold rolled steel) are incorporated into some bits to encourage salivation in the mouth of the horse, which encourages a softer mouth and more relaxed jaw. Bits also can be made of other materials such as rubber or plastic, sometimes in combination with metals.Edwards, pp. 180–181 Throughout history, the need for control of horses in warfare drove extensive innovation in bit design, producing a variety of prototypes and styles over the centuries, from Ancient Greece into modern-day use.The Francis C. Shirbroun Bridle Bit Museum Design and terminology The bits of a double bridle, showing both a type of snaffle bit called a bradoon and a curb bit. A bit consists of two basic components, the bit mouthpiece that goes inside the horse's mouth, and the bit rings of a snaffle bit or shanks of a curb bit, to which the bridle and reins attach. All bits act with some combination of pressure and leverage, often in conjunction with pressure applied by other parts of the bridle such as the curb chain on the chin, noseband on the jaw and face, or pressure on the poll from the headstall.Price, Steven D. (ed.) The Whole Horse Catalog: Revised and Updated New York:Fireside 1998 p. 149 Particular mouthpieces do not define the type of bit. It is the sidepieces and the leverage these rings or shanks use to act on a horse's mouth that determines whether a bit is in the curb or snaffle family, and has a great impact on the severity of the mouthpiece. The mouthpiece of a horse's bit is the first factor most people think of when assessing the severity and action of the bit. Therefore, it is carefully considered when choosing a bit for a horse. Many mouthpieces are not allowed in certain competitions. Bit mouthpieces may be single jointed, double-jointed, \\"mullen\\" (a straight bar), or have an arched port in the center of varying height, with or without joints. Some have rollers, rings or small \\"keys\\" that the horse can move with its tongue. Mouthpieces may be smooth, wire-wrapped or otherwise roughened, or of twisted wire or metal. Various types of metal or synthetic substances are used for bit mouthpieces, which may determine how much a horse salivates or otherwise tolerates a bit; a horse having a moist mouth is considered more relaxed and responsive. Commonly used metals include stainless steel and nickel alloys, which generally do not rust and have a neutral effect on salivation; sweet iron, aurigan and copper, which generally tend to encourage salivation, and aluminum, which is considered drying and is discouraged as a mouthpiece metal. Synthetic mouthpieces may be made with or without internal metal cable or bar reinforcement. Rubber bits are generally thicker than metal bits, but other types of synthetics such as plastics are also used. Plastic- coated bits are often the same size as metal bits, and some are flavored. Often, bits with shanks that also have single- or double-jointed mouthpieces are incorrectly referred to as snaffles. Because of the presence of a shank, they are actually in the curb bit family. Effects Improper use of a bit can cause considerable pain to a horse The mouthpiece of the bit does not rest on the teeth of the horse, but rather rests on the gums or \\"bars\\" of the horse's mouth in an interdental space behind the front incisors and in front of the back molars. When a horse is said to \\"grab the bit in its teeth\\" they actually mean that the horse tenses its lips and mouth against the bit to avoid the rider's commands (although some horses may actually learn to get the bit between their molars). Depending on the style of bit, pressure can be brought to bear on the bars, tongue, and roof of the mouth, as well as the lips, chin groove and poll. Bits offer varying degrees of control and communication between rider and horse depending upon their design and on the skill of the rider. It is important that the style of bit is appropriate to the horse's needs and is fitted properly for it to function properly and be as comfortable as possible for the horse. Snaffle or direct pressure bits A direct pressure snaffle bit with single-jointed mouthpiece and stylized bit rings. All bits work with either direct pressure or leverage. Bits that act with direct pressure on the tongue and lips are in the general category of snaffle bits. Snaffle bits most commonly have a single jointed mouthpiece and act with a nutcracker effect on the bars, tongue and occasionally roof of the mouth. However, any bit that operates only on direct pressure is a \\"snaffle\\" bit, regardless of mouthpiece.Edwards, pp. 52-58 Curb or leverage bits A western style curb bit. Bits that have shanks coming off the bit mouthpiece to create leverage that applies pressure to the poll, chin groove and mouth of the horse are in the category of curb bits. Most curb bit mouthpieces are solid without joints, ranging from a straight bar with a slight arch, called a \\"mullen\\" mouthpiece, through a \\"ported\\" bit that is slightly arched in the middle to provide tongue relief, to the full spade bit of the Vaquero style of western riding which combines both a straight bar and a very high \\"spoon\\" or \\"spade\\" extension that contacts the roof of the mouth. The length of the shank determines the degree of leverage put on the horse's head and mouth. Again, a bit with shanks and leverage is always a \\"curb\\" type bit, even when it has a jointed mouthpiece more commonly seen on a snaffle (such bits are sometimes—incorrectly—called \\"cowboy snaffles\\"). All shanked bits require the use of a curb chain or curb strap for proper action and safe use. Combination designs thumbChifney anti-rearing bit for leading horses Some bits combine both direct pressure and leverage, the most common examples being the Pelham bit, which has shanks and rings allowing both direct and leverage pressure on a single bit and is ridden with four reins; the Kimblewick or Kimberwicke, a hybrid bit that uses minimal leverage on a modified snaffle- type ring combined with a mouthpiece that is usually seen more often on curb bits, ridden with two reins;Edwards, pp. 91-93 and the double bridle, which places a curb and a snaffle bit simultaneously in the horse's mouth so that each may act independently of the other, ridden with four reins. Another bit that combines direct pressure and leverage in a unique manner is the Gag bit, a bit derived from the snaffle that, instead of having a rein attached to the mouthpiece, runs the rein through a set of rings that attach directly to the headstall, creating extra pressure on the lips and poll when applied. Usually used for correction of specific problems, the gag bit is generally illegal in the show ringPrice, Steven D. (ed.) The Whole Horse Catalog: Revised and Updated New York:Fireside 1998 p. 151 and racecourse. Idiomatic usage Bits and the behavior of horses while wearing bits have made their way into popular culture outside of the horse world. *Took the bit in his teeth, a phrase that describes a horse that sets its jaw against the bit and cannot be controlled (rarely does the horse actually grab the bit with its molars), is used today to refer to a person who either is taking control of a situation or who is uncontrollable and casts off restraintTake the bit between your teethtake the bit in teeth - definition of take the bit in teeth by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia *Champing at the bit, also worded chomping at the bit or chafing at the bit, meaning to show impatience or burst with energy,Champ at the bitChamp at the bit Synonyms, Champ at the bit Antonyms  Thesaurus.comChamping at the bit, chomping at the bit - Grammaristchamping at the bit - definition of champing at the bit by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia refers to a tendency of some horses, when impatient or nervous, and especially if being held back by their riders, to chew on the bit, often salivating excessively. This behavior is sometimes accompanied by head-tossing or pawing at the ground. Because this behavior was most often seen by the general public in horses who were anxious to begin a horse race in the days before the invention of the starting gate, the term has become popular in everyday speech to refer to a person who is anxious to get started or to do something. Because some impatient horses, when held back, would also occasionally rear, a related phrase, \\"raring to go,\\" is also derived from observations of equine behavior.

Their use can prevent some cases of pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis. There are two types of pneumococcal vaccines: conjugate vaccines and polysaccharide vaccines. They are given by injection either into a muscle or just under the skin. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of the conjugate vaccine in the routine immunizations given to children. This includes those with HIV/AIDS. The recommended three or four doses are between 71 and 93% effective at preventing severe pneumococcal disease. The polysaccharide vaccines, while effective in healthy adults, are not effective in children less than two years old or those with poor immune function. These vaccines are generally safe. With the conjugate vaccine about 10% of babies develop redness at the site of injection, fever, or change in sleep. Severe allergies are very rare. The first pneumococcal vaccine was developed in the 1980s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Recommendations Prevenar13 =Worldwide= Pneumococcal vaccines Accelerated Development and Introduction Plan (PneumoADIP) is a program to accelerate the evaluation and access to new pneumococcal vaccines in the developing world. PneumoADIP is funded by the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI). Thirty GAVI countries have expressed interest in participating by 2010. PneumoADIP aims to save 5.4 million children by 2030.\\"PneumoADIP website\\" A pilot Advance Market Commitment (AMC) to develop a vaccine against pneumococcus was launched by GAVI in June 2009 as a strategy to address two of the major policy challenges to vaccine introduction: a lack of affordable vaccines on the market, and insufficient commercial incentives to develop vaccines for diseases concentrated in developing countries. Under the terms of an AMC, donors make a legally binding guarantee that, if a future vaccine is developed against a particular disease, they will purchase a predetermined amount at an agreed-upon price. The guarantee is linked to safety and efficacy standards that the vaccine must meet and is structured in a way to allow several firms to compete to develop and produce the best possible new product. AMCs reduce risk to donor governments by eliminating the need to fund individual research and development projects that may never produce a vaccine. If no company produces a vaccine that meets the predetermined standards, governments (and thus their taxpayers) spend nothing. For the bio-pharmaceutical industry, AMCs create a guaranteed market, with a promise of returns that would not normally exist. For developing countries, AMCs provide funding to ensure that those vaccines will be affordable once they have been developed. It is estimated that the pneumococcal AMC could prevent more than 1.5 million childhood deaths by 2020.\\"Pneumococcal AMC GAVI webpage\\" Doctors without borders has criticized GAVI's pneumococcal AMC for not encouraging innovation, discouraging competition from new market entrants, and raising vaccine costs. They said that it had allowed Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline to maintain a duopoly, while making it more difficult for the Serum Institute of India to sell their cheaper vaccine. The duopoly allowed price discrimination; somewhat higher prices for GAVI, and unaffordable prices (about ten time the GAVI price) for middle-income countries too rich for GAVI aid. The pneumoccocal program (unlike previous market-shaping programs from GAVI) did not include any mechanism for increasing competition. The Humanitarian Mechanism makes the pneumococcal vaccine available to humanitarian actors (but not governments) at a lower than normal price during humanitarian emergencies. =India= In May 2017, the Government of India decided to include pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in its Universal Immunization Programme. =United States= Diagram with visual representation of the current indications for both the Prevnar and the Pneumovax. In the United States, a heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV 7) (e.g. Prevnar, called Prevenar in some countries) was recommended for all children aged 2–23 months and for at-risk children aged 24–59 months in 2000. The normal four-dose series is given at 2, 4, 6 and 12–14 months of age. In February 2010, a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine which protects against an additional six serotypes was introduced (PCV 13/brand name: Prevnar 13) and can be given instead of the original Prevnar. Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV, Pneumovax is one brand) gives at least 85% protection in those under 55 years of age for five years or longer. Immunization is suggested for those at highest risk of infection, including those 65 years or older; generally the vaccine should be a single lifetime dose, as there is a high risk of side effects if repeated. The standard 23-valent vaccines are ineffective for children under two years old. The current guidelines of the American College of Physicians call for the administration of the immunization between ages two and 65 when indicated, or at age 65. If someone received the immunization before age 60, the guidelines call for one-time revaccination. Majority of pharmacists indicate that they recommend all adults 65 and older receive a pneumococcal vaccination. They are generally educated on ACIP/CDC recommendations and believe that all people, regardless of age, should also be caught up on them. Revaccination at periodic intervals is also indicated for those with other conditions such as asplenia or nephrotic syndrome. =UK= It was announced in February 2006, that the UK government would introduce vaccination with the conjugate vaccine in children aged 2, 4 and 13 months. This included changes to the immunisation programme in general. In 2009, the European Medicines Agency approved the use of a 10 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for use in Europe. The 13 valent pneumococcal vaccine was introduced in the routine immunization schedule of the UK in April 2010. =South Africa= The 7- and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV7 and PCV13) were introduced into the national Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) in South Africa in 2009 and 2011, respectively. South Africa became the first African country – and the first nation in the world with a high HIV prevalence – to introduce PCV7 into its routine immunization program. Rates of invasive pneumococcal disease – including cases caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria – have fallen substantially in South Africa following the introduction of PCV7. Among children under two years of age, the overall incidence of IPD declined nearly 70% after PCV introduction, and rates of IPD caused by bacteria specifically targeted by the vaccine decreased nearly 90%. Due to the indirect protection conferred by herd immunity, a significant decline in IPD in children and in unvaccinated adults has also been shown. Pneumovax 23 is used for all ages and, according to the enclosed patient information leaflet, has a reported 76% to 92% protective efficacy (pneumococcal types 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 17F, 18C, 19A, 19F, 20, 22F, 23F and 33F are included, where  indicates drug-resistant pneumococcal infections; these are the 23 most prevalent or invasive pneumococcal types of Streptococcus pneumoniae). =Canada= Health Canada's general recommendations are 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV 13) vaccine for children aged 2 months to 18 years and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV 23) vaccine for adults. Adverse reactions =Conjugate vaccine= Local reactions such as pain, swelling, or redness occur in up to 50% of those vaccinated with PCV13; of these, 8% are considered severe. Local reactions are more likely after the 4th dose than the earlier doses. In clinical trials, fever greater than 100.4 F (38 C) was reported at a rate of 24-35% following any dose in the primary series and nonspecific symptoms such as decreased appetite or irritability occur in up to 80% of recipients. In a vaccine safety datalink study, febrile seizures occurred in roughly 1 in 83,000 to 1 in 6,000 children given PCV 13, and 1 in 21,000 to 1 in 2,000 of those who were given PCV13 and trivalent influenza vaccine at the same time. Mechanism =Polysaccharide vaccine= The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine most commonly used today consists of purified polysaccharides from 23 serotypes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6b, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 17F, 18C, 19A, 19F, 20, 22F, 23F, and 33F). Immunity is induced primarily through stimulation of B-cells which release IgM without the assistance of T cells. This immune response is less robust than the response provoked by conjugated vaccines, which has several consequences. The vaccine is ineffective in children less than 2 years old, presumably due to their less mature immune systems. Non-response is also common amongst older adults. Immunity is not lifelong, so individuals must be re-vaccinated at age 65 if their initial vaccination was given at age 60 or younger. Since no mucosal immunity is provoked, the vaccine does not affect carrier rates, promote herd immunity, or protect against upper or lower respiratory tract infections. Finally, provoking immune responses using unconjugated polysaccharides from the capsules of other bacteria, such as H. influenzae, has proven significantly more difficult. =Conjugated vaccine= The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine consists of capsular polysaccharides covalently bound to the diphtheria toxoid CRM197, which is highly immunogenic but non- toxic. This combination provokes a significantly more robust immune response by recruiting CRM197-specific type 2 helper T cells, which allow for immunoglobulin type switching (to produce non-IgM immunoglobulin) and production of memory B cells. Among other things, this results in mucosal immunity and the eventual establishment of lifelong immunity after several exposures. The main drawbacks to conjugated vaccines are that they only provide protection against a subset of the serotypes covered by the polysaccharide vaccines. Research Due to the geographic distribution of pneumococcal serotypes, additional research is needed to find the most efficacious vaccine for developing-world populations. In a previous study, the most common pneumococcal serotypes or groups from developed countries were found to be, in descending order, 14, 6, 19, 18, 9, 23, 7, 4, 1 and 15. In developing countries, the order was 6, 14, 8, 5, 1, 19, 9, 23, 18, 15 and 7. In order to further pneumococcal vaccine research and reduce childhood mortality, five countries and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation established a pilot Advance Market Commitment for pneumococcal vaccines worth US$1.5 billion. Advance Market Commitments are a new approach to public health funding designed to stimulate the development and manufacture of vaccines for developing countries. There is currently research into producing vaccines than can be given into the nose rather than by injection. It is believed that this improves vaccine efficacy and also avoids the need for injection. The development of serotype-specific anticapsular monoclonal antibodies has also been researched in recent years. These antibodies have been shown to prolong survival in a mouse model of pneumococcal infection characterized by a reduction in bacterial loads and a suppression of the host inflammatory response. Additional pneumococcal vaccine research is taking place to find a vaccine that offers broad protection against pneumococcal disease. , pneumonia vaccines target up to 23 forms of the bacterium that cause pneumonia with a new version under development covering 72 strains of the bacterium.

She took over in Rajasthan from the Punjab governor, Shivraj Patil, who had been holding an additional charge of that state. Before being appointed governor, she was a senior figure in the Indian National Congress and was Joint Secretary of the All India Congress Committee. Her mother-in-law, Violet Alva, was a member of Rajya Sabha in 1960s.  Early life  Margaret Alva was born Margaret Nazareth on 14 April 1942 in a Christian family at Mangalore, Karnataka. She obtained a BA degree from Mount Carmel College, Bangalore and a law degree from Government Law College in the same city. She was a keen and appreciated debater during her time at college and had some involvement in students' movements. Alva combined her work as an advocate with involvement in welfare organisations, eventually becoming president of the Young Women's Christian Association. One of her early involvements was with the Karuna non- governmental organisation, which she founded and which was focused on issues relating to women and children. She married Niranjan Thomas Alva on 24 May 1964, with whom she has one daughter and three sons, including Niret Alva. The couple had met as students at Government Law College and her husband now operates a successful export business, which has given her financial security that has been beneficial to her later career.  Politics  = Beginnings = Alva's decision to enter politics in 1969 was strongly influenced by her husband and father-in-law, Joachim Alva, the latter and his wife, Violet Alva, being Members of Parliament representing the Indian National Congress. She has acknowledged this encouragement, saying that \\"I never had to face any family constraints on my political activities\\" and she has also said that the death of Violet in 1969 provided the impetus. She aligned herself with the Congress (Indira) faction led by Indira Gandhi and worked for its state unit in Karnataka. She served as Joint Secretary of the All India Congress Committee between 1975 and 1977 and as General Secretary of the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee between 1978 and 1980, = Rajya Sabha = In April 1974, Alva had been elected to the Raiya Sabha as a representative of Congress. She served a six-year term and was then re-elected for a further three six-year terms, in 1980, 1986 and 1992. During her time in the Rajya Sabha, she was its vice-chairman (1983–85) and also served terms as Union Minister of State in the ministries for Parliamentary Affairs (1984–85) and for Youth and Sports and Women and Child Development, an arm of the Ministry of Human Resource Development. She also served on various House committees, which garnered her a considerable degree of procedural expertise, and was briefly Minister for Science and Technology. In her HRD role, between 1985 and 1989, Alva oversaw the Rajiv Gandhi-led government's 28-point plan intended to improve the rights and involvement of women and children. In addition, she made proposals for various development corporations for women, only some of which materialised, and also campaigned for a greater prominence of women in government and in her party's official posts. Her 1989 proposal that 33 per cent of seats in panchayat raj (local government) elections should be reserved for women became law in 1993 and, according to Laura Jenkins, \\"marked a further shift from the former abhorrence of reservations as a nationally divisive policy\\". She continued her efforts to improve the lot of women during her period as Minister of State for Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions and Parliamentary Affairs (1991 and 1993-96), where she tried to increase the number of female officeholders in various ministries and government organisations, such as the Union Public Service Commission and the judiciary. Alva has also been involved with women's issues and related matters such as population growth on the international stage, notably through various United Nations bodies and in writings. = Lok Sabha = Alva was elected to the 13th Lok Sabha as a Member of Parliament in 1999, serving a five-year term. She lost a subsequent re- election attempt in the Uttara Kannada constituency. Between 2004 and 2009, she served as General Secretary of the All India Congress Committee and was an advisor to the Bureau of Parliamentary Studies & Training, a government body that works with newly elected parliamentary representatives at both national and state level. = Governorships = In November 2008, Alva said that Congress seats for the elections in Karnataka were open to bidders rather than subject to meritocratic appointment. Congress denied her claims and a meeting with the party president, Sonia Gandhi resulted in Alva resigning or being removed from her numerous official responsibilities in the party. Subsequently, Alva patched up her differences with Congress leadership. She has declined to go into details of the 2008 controversy even as her resignation letter continues to be a subject of media speculation. On 6 August 2009, Alva became the first female Governor of Uttarakhand. Although she said then that she was enthusiastic about the challenges facing the nascent state, she found herself sidelined outside national politics and frustrated by the Bharatiya Janata Party state government. She remained in the post until May 2012, at which time she was appointed Governor of Rajasthan, which was a more important region in political terms. Of her time in Uttarakhand, Alva said that \\"The quietude allowed me to recharge my batteries and even spare some time for working on my biography\\". The autobiography is not expected to appear until after her retirement. The move to Rajasthan relieved Shivraj Patil, the Governor of Punjab, of his temporary adjunct responsibility for that state which had arisen due to the death of the incumbent governor, Prabha Rau, in April 2010.

Playing career =Arsenal= Curtis played as a youth for Anglo (Purfleet) before signing for Arsenal in December 1936. He spent over a year at Arsenal's nursery club, Margate, before returning to Highbury in February 1938; he made his Arsenal debut in a 2–1 win at Highbury against Blackpool on 10 April 1939. He went on to make only one other first team appearance during that season. World War II intervened that September and he spent the war serving in the Royal Air Force stationed in India, but also played over 50 wartime matches for Arsenal. He also appeared as a guest player for West Ham United later in World War II. After hostilities ended he played 12 times in the 1946–47 season, but was sold to Southampton in part-exchange for Don Roper in summer 1947; in all he played 14 times for the Gunners, never scoring. =Southampton= Curtis had impressed Southampton manager Bill Dodgin who valued him at £10,000, in an exchange transfer that also saw Tom Rudkin arrive at The Dell, with Don Roper moving to Highbury. Nicknamed Twinkletoes by his teammates, Curtis was a clever, nimble player, whose feints and tricks were appreciated by the supporters, although they often frustrated his colleagues. 'Soccer Star' magazine described Curtis as an \\"inside-forward-cum-wing-half\\". During his five seasons at Southampton the club narrowly missed out on promotion to Division 1 for three seasons in a row; in 1947–48 they finished in third place, a feat repeated the following season (despite having an 8-point lead with 8 games to play) whilst in 1949–50 they were to be denied promotion by 0.06 of a goal, missing out on second place to Sheffield United. After five memorable seasons at The Dell, he moved to the French second division. In all he played 183 games for Southampton, scoring 12 goals. =Later career= He then joined French team Valenciennes for a fee of £1,500 staying for a year between 1952 and 1953, before returning to see out his playing days as player-coach at Chelmsford City. Curtis' move to Chelmsford City was somewhat hindered due to a strike in France, but he eventually joined the Southern League side for 'a four-figure fee'. He then embarked on a coaching course at Lilleshall working with Walter Winterbottom. His coaching skills were quickly in demand and between 1957 and 1961 he was a coach with Sunderland. Management career =Brighton and Hove Albion= His first managerial position came in June 1961 when he was appointed manager at Brighton & Hove Albion. At the end of his first season in charge, Brighton were relegated from the Second division in last place. He stayed at Brighton until February 1963, when he was replaced by Archie Macaulay. =Coaching= There followed spells as coach with Cambridge University and Hastings, before taking the managerial reins at Stevenage Town F.C. from January 1964 until 1967. He then had brief spells coaching at Hull City and with San Diego Toros. =Rosenborg= He was appointed as head coach at Norwegian side Rosenborg ahead of the 1969 season replacing Knut Næss. His first meeting with the Rosenborg players is legendary: > \\"This is a ball,\\" Curtis stated whilst pointing to the round leather ball. > \\"Don't go too fast, now!\\" Odd Iversen laughed. Curtis introduced modern defensive football to Norway, with a flat backline 4–4–2 formation, pressure on the ball carrier and tactical focus. The 1969 debut season ended with a premiership title for Rosenborg, with Odd Iversen scoring 26 of the team's 36 league goals. Despite this success, both the club leadership and the spectators disliked George Curtis's defensive style and pressure was put on Curtis to play a more attacking style. In September 1969, Rosenborg met Curtis's former club, Southampton, in the first round of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, with Southampton going through 2–1 on aggregate, the goals coming from Ron Davies and Terry Paine with Rosenborg's goal scored by Sunde. Curtis was allowed to continue for one more season. Despite coming second in the 1970 league season, it was an anti-climax. The dynamic duo of Iversen and Harald Sunde had been sold to Belgian Division 2 club Racing Mechelen before the start of the season and with them went all of Rosenborg's attacking play. 18 league games later, Rosenborg ended up with an almost unbelievable goal difference of 15–5! At the end of the season, George Curtis was dismissed and was replaced by Nils Arne Eggen. =Norway national team= Curtis returned to England, but in 1972 he returned to Norway to coach the national team. During the Euro 72 qualifying campaign, Norway picked up only one point in six games, and in a World Cup qualifier against the Netherlands on 1 November 1972, Norway lost 9–0. The next year, they suffered a perhaps even more humiliating result by losing 2–1 against Luxembourg. Under his management, Norway played 17 international matches (of which only 3 were won) before he was sacked in June 1974. Again, he was replaced by Eggen. =Rosenborg (again)= Before the 1976 season, he was once again appointed as head coach at Rosenborg. After a car accident in which his Norwegian wife died, Curtis's focus shifted elsewhere and Rosenborg quickly ended up struggling to avoid relegation. A 0–4 defeat against Division 3 side Røros in the 2nd round of the cup sealed his fate: Curtis was released from his contract on 27 August 1976. Again, his successor was Nils Arne Eggen. His final coaching job was spent in Qatar from 1979 to 1981. After football He retired to live on the Essex coast where he continued to coach youngsters as part of the FIFA coaching scheme, remaining as passionate about the game as ever. He died in 2004, reportedly spending the final years of his life living on his own in a caravan in Chelmsford.

This species takes its name from the prominent hump between the head and dorsal fin, which is thought to direct the flow of water over the body and help maintain body position in the swift currents of the Colorado. The body is almost entirely scaleless, retaining only about 80 mid-lateral scales along the lateral line. The fish is very streamlined, with a thin caudal peduncle and a deeply forked tail. The back is a light olive gray, the sides silver, and the belly white. The dorsal fin usually has nine rays, and the anal fin 10 or more. Maximum recorded length is 38 cm.William F. Sigler and John W. Sigler, Fishes of Utah (University of Utah Press, 1996), pp. 79-83 The humpback chub mostly consumes invertebrates and, to a lesser extent, other fish. They feed at all levels from the bottom to the surface. The species spawns from April through June, at water temperatures of 19-21 °C. The males develop nuptial tubercles on the head and paired fins. The fish spawn in slower-moving backwaters, typically over a substrate of cobbles or boulders. Young fish stay near shore and in quiet areas, preferring slightly more turbid water.Minckley, W.L. 1973. Fishes of Arizona. Arizona Game and Fish Department, Phoenix. pp. 98-99. The humpback chub's population in the Colorado has been reduced dramatically, primarily due to habitat loss, such as the construction of Glen Canyon Dam. The fish's status as an endangered species has inspired a number of costly and controversial management measures, such as altering the operation of Glen Canyon Dam and removal of non-native predators.Tobin, Mitch. Endangered: Biodiversity on the Brink. Golden, CO: Fulcrum, 2010. Description The humpback chub has a streamlined body, with a concave skull on its dorsum. The caudal peduncle is thin and somewhat pencil-like but not greatly elongated, where the length of the caudle peduncle divided by length of head is less than 1.0. The head length divided by the caudal peduncle is less than 5.0. The scales are embedded deeply across the surface of the fish, especially on hump. The fins are large and curved, and the origin of the dorsal are about equidistant between the snout and caudal fin base. The mouth is inferior, and overhung by the snout. The pharyngeal arch is small, with a short lower ramus. Range The humpback chub historically ranged from below present-day Hoover Dam in the Colorado River upstream into Colorado, and in the larger portions of Colorado River tributaries in Arizona, Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming. Presently the species is restricted to six population centers in: 1) the Colorado and Little Colorado rivers in Grand Canyon, Arizona; 2) the Colorado River in Cataract Canyon, Utah; 3) the Colorado River in Black Rocks, Colorado, and Westwater Canyon, Utah; 4) the Green River in Desolation and Gray canyons, Utah; 5) the Green River in Dinosaur National Monument, Colorado and Utah; 6) and the Yampa River in Dinosaur National Monument, Colorado.Arizona Game and Fish Department. 1988. Threatened Native Wildlife in Arizona. Arizona Game and Fish Department Publication. Phoenix, Arizona. p. 4. The Humpback Chub is found in Arizona at and around Coconino County, Colorado and Little Colorado rivers in the Grand Canyon.http://www.azgfd.gov/w_c/edits/documents/Gilacyph.fo_002.pdf Habitat In general, species persists only in turbulent, high gradient, canyon-bound reaches of large rivers in the Colorado River Basin. The young prefer shallow, low-velocity nearshore pools in the Little Colorado River, and progressively move to deeper, faster areas with increasing size and age.Gorman, O.T. 1994.

Arizona Game and Fish Department, Phoenix. pp. 155. Kaeding and Zimmermann also reported 13 species of bacteria, six protozoans, and the fungus Saprolegnia to infect humpback chub.  Population Trends  The historic range of the humpback chub is uncertain, but the distribution was presumably more contiguous than in the present. There were possible populations in and below the Flaming Gorge that were likely destroyed by the poisoning of the Green River associated with the construction of the Flaming Gorge Reservoir.Holden, P.B. 1991. Ghosts of the Green River: impacts of Green River poisoning on management of native fishes. Pages 43-54 in W.L. Minckley and J.E. Deacon, editors. Battle Against Extinction: Native Fish Management in the American West. University of Arizona Press, Tucson. pp. 517. The fish's distribution within the Grand Canyon has contracted since the construction of Glen Canyon Dam. For 2008 the total population of the humpback chub in the Grand Canyon is estimated at 6000 to 10.000.USGS Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center: Humpbck Chub, November 2011 This is a 50-percent increase over the estimation of 2001 and a reversal of the declining trend between 1989 and 2001. It seems that a combination of human- caused and natural events stabilized the population, particularly the experimental flooding of the canyon and the increase in water temperatures due to draught conditions over the last decade.  Management and Conservation  Threats: altered hydrology and cold tailwater releases from reservoirs; Predation by and competition with nonnative fishes; and, parasitism. Management Needs: ameliorate effects of reservoirs; ameliorate effects of nonnative fish and parasite sources in chub waters; monitor status of all populations. Also need to be concerned about genetic isolation of populations by dams. The humpback chub's status as an endangered species has prompted elaborate and expensive programs to restore its numbers, largely by modifying the releases from Glen Canyon Dam, creating artificial floods to replicate historic conditions in the Colorado, and removal of non-native predators, such as rainbow trout. Effective April 20, 1994, seven reaches of the Colorado River System (totaling 379 miles) were designated as Critical Habitat for Gila cypha. The Grand Canyon Protection Act of 1992 reduced stage fluctuation of water releases from Glen Canyon Dam.

Young Humpback chubs after release in Shinumo Creek After the Colorado had been extensively modified by dams, the Little Colorado River became the fish's stronghold in Grand Canyon region. A second population is currently established in Shinumo Creek, another tributary to the Colorado River inside Grand Canyon National Park. The first 300 fish were released in Shinumo Creek in June 2009. Over the following two years additional young chubs will be released there. Federal officials have tried a number of experimental releases from Glen Canyon Dam in an attempt to replicate historic conditions and restore sandbars, beaches, and backwaters downstream. The first flood began on March 26, 1996, when Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt stood before a large gathering of media and opened the first of four outlet tubes to begin the imitation inundation. The 1996 flood released nearly per second, enough to fill the Empire State Building or Sears Tower in 20 minutes, drained from Lake Powell, and dropped the reservoir level by more than three feet. Initially, it appeared that the flood was a success, with sandbars and backwaters created downstream, but as the dam's operations returned to normal, the Colorado ate away at the new habitat and reversed the gains. Several other fake floods have been tried since 1996, with the releases now timed to coincide with an input of sediment from tributaries, but the results have been disappointing. In recent years, the number of humpback chub in the Grand Canyon region has increased significantly, but the reasons are unclear. Removal of non-native fish near the confluence of the Little Colorado River and Colorado River may have helped the species, but at the same time, drought was lowering the level of Lake Powell and causing water released from Glen Canyon Dam to be much warmer than normal. Typically, water released from the dam is too cold for chub to reproduce. External links * List of Arizona Native Fishes * Arizona Desert Museum References * Tobin, Mitch.

At long, it is the largest purely terrestrial animal native to the continent, as well as its only insect. It also has the smallest known insect genome as of 2014, with only 99 million base pairs of nucleotides (and about 13,500 genes). It is the only insect that can survive year-round in Antarctica. Tolerance to extreme conditions The flightlessness of B. antarctica may be an adaptation to prevent wind from blowing it into inhospitable areas. It can survive freezing, but though local air temperatures may reach as low as −40 °C, this insect cannot survive temperatures below −15 °C. This is comparatively milder than other cold- adapted insects. The reason for this relatively low freezing tolerance is due to thermal buffering: just burrowing at a depth of 1 cm, temperature is stable between 0 and −2 °C for 10 months out of 12, and it seldom goes lower than −7 °C all year round. Ice and snow cover also helps keeping the temperature stable. Freezing tolerance is enhanced by cold hardening. To adapt to the cold temperatures, B. antarctica accumulates trehalose, glucose, and erythritol. These compounds help the insect survive freezing by reducing the amount of ice that forms within the body. They also stabilize proteins and membranes, binding to them by means of hydrogen bonds. Heat shock proteins also help the tolerance to both high and low temperatures. B. antarctica not only tolerates, but also requires a freezing climate to survive: exposure of larvae to such mild temperatures as 10 °C is enough to kill them within a week. Exposure to temperatures of 30 °C kills individuals in a few hours. It can, however, resist partial desiccation, surviving the loss of up to 70% of body water. Lifecycle B. antarctica spends most of its two-year lifecycle in four larval stages. Overwintering may occur in any instar. Terrestrial algae (particularly Prasiola crispa), moss, organic detritus, and microorganisms provide the food for the larval stage. The adults emerge in the spring and summer and live no more than 10 days; females mate in their first day of life and a few days later release eggs. Mating occurs in large groups of males, analogous to swarms of winged midges.

He played college football at Notre Dame. A depth player for the Oilers and former All-American, Alm made national headlines for his suicide following a car accident that killed his best friend, caused by driving under the influence. His death was one of several incidents in a turmoil-filled season for the Oilers franchise. Early life and college career Born in New York City, Alm grew up in Orland Park, Illinois, a wealthy suburb of Chicago. He had three siblings and was raised by his mother and stepfather after his biological parents divorced. Alm played for the Carl Sandburg High School football team, earning all-state honors. During his junior year, he met Sean P. Lynch, a transfer student, while playing on the football field together. Alm and Lynch eventually became best friends despite their differences in both personality and stature and were inseparable. As Alm's mother, Betty, described: \\"I always described them as Mutt and Jeff. Sean was so little. They looked so funny together.\\" Alm eventually earned a football scholarship to Notre Dame. Alm was described by his teammates and friends as introspective and intellectual, completing a degree in marketing. He was praised for his work ethic by teammates and was named a second-team All-American during his senior year. Professional career Alm was selected by the Houston Oilers with their second-round pick in the 1990 NFL Draft. Throughout his career, Alm felt lonely in Houston and kept in touch with a handful of close friends from home and college, including Lynch. His final year was marred by a contract holdout and injury. Car accident and subsequent suicide According to a witness, while Lynch was visiting Alm, the pair had dinner at a Houston-area steakhouse on December 13, 1993. At 2:45 a.m. on the following day, Alm, who was speeding, lost control of his 1993 Cadillac Eldorado heading south on Interstate 610 southbound at the 59 North exit ramp and Lynch was thrown out of the car because the convertible top was down. After the crash, Alm ran across the ramp and looked down an embankment towards the Southwest Freeway, discovering that his boyhood friend had been thrown to his death 30 feet below. Apparently distraught by his best friend's death, Alm took out a pistol-grip shotgun, fired two shots into the air, and then shot himself in the head. Alm had made a frantic 911 call to summon help after the car crash prior to his suicide. Alm shouted \\"Sean are you all right?\\" at the beginning of the call. In the ensuing moments, he tries to tell the operator the location of the accident.\\"Yes, I had an accident on, uh,\\" Alm said. \\"I had an accident on 59, uh, on 59 north. We're at . . . 59 north. Loop, uh, 610. I have a buddy dying!\\" Toxicology reports have stated that Alm had a blood alcohol-level of .14, over the .10 legal limit. Lynch's blood- alcohol level was .30. Alm was also taking the prescription barbiturate, Fiorinal, commonly prescribed for tension headaches. According to the report by Joseph A. Jachimczyk, Chief Medical Examiner for Harris County, the barbiturate level was within therapeutic range.\\"Officials Say Alm Was Intoxicated\\" The New York Times.

The case took over 62 years to resolve, and unlike many Southern school districts, the Cleveland School District never consolidated its white and black schools, which until then were actually segregated by law. In 1969 Cleveland High School, historically a White school, opened admission to black students. About 1,000 white people protested at the time Black students were legally allowed to enroll in White schools. Up to 2016 there were racial demographic differences remaining in the district's schools, with those west of the former railroad tracks having a whiter student body. The district had two sets of secondary schools: a middle school and a high school that were historically white, and a middle school and a high school that were all-black. Margaret Green Junior High School and Cleveland High were historically White,Gates, Jimmie E. \\"Cleveland schools must desegregate\\" (Archive). The Clarion-Ledger. May 16, 2016.

Sharon Lerner of The Atlantic wrote that \\"As a result, Cleveland has some of the most integrated —and some of the most segregated—public schools in the region.\\" Beginning in 1990 the district made many failed attempts, including a freedom of choice enrollment program allowing any student to enroll in any school with his/her grade level, International Baccalaureate programs, and magnet programs, to encourage White students to enroll in almost all-black schools, but these plans did not work. The U.S. Justice Department, in 2011, argued that the Cleveland School District had failed to properly integrate the system, reviving the discrimination suit from a dormant state.Amy, Jeff. \\"Feds seek to merge Cleveland schools\\" (Archive). The Clarion-Ledger. May 17, 2015. Retrieved on May 21, 2016. Until the conclusion of the desegregation case the school district had been proposing to continue operating the two sets of secondary schools with \\"Freedom of Choice\\" and magnet programs, although one of its two desegregation programs did advocate merging the middle schools. The U.S. Department of Justice advocated consolidating the schools, arguing that the voluntary programs were not effective and that the black schools were disadvantaged. Part of the resistance against consolidation stemmed from fear that the integrated schools would suffer from white flight if consolidation happened. Jim Tims, a former member of the Cleveland School Board, stated that by consolidating the schools the single high school would be about 30% white, and that since White people do not wish to be \\"a small minority\\" they would engage in white flight and enroll in nearby majority white private schools. The school district also argued that more spaces would be available for extracurricular activities if two high schools remained open in Cleveland. In May 2016 the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi ordered the school district to consolidate the schools in order to achieve racial integration.Brown, Emma. \\"Judge orders Mississippi school district to desegregate, 62 years after Brown v.

The historical legal principles governing the treatment of prisoners of war, in shar'iah, Islamic law, (in the traditional madhabs schools of Islamic jurisprudence), was then a significant improvement over the pre-existing norms of society during Muhammad's time (see Early reforms under Islam). Men, women, and children may all be taken as prisoners of war under traditional interpretations of Islamic law. Generally, a prisoner of war could be, at the discretion of the military leader, freed, ransomed, exchanged for Muslim prisoners, or kept in bondage.Tafsir of the Qur'an by Ibn Kathir Ahkaam al-Sijn wa’l-Sujana’ wa Mu’aamalat al-Sujana’ fi’l-Islam of the Hadith by Hasan Abi’l-Ghuddah In earlier times, the ransom sometimes took an educational dimension, where a literate prisoner of war could secure his or her freedom by teaching ten Muslims to read and write.Shirazi, Imam Muhammad. The Prophet Muhammad - A Mercy to the World. Createspace Independent Pub, 2013, p. 74. Some Muslim scholars hold that a prisoner may not be ransomed for gold or silver, but may be exchanged for Muslim prisoners.'Abu Yusuf Ya'qub Le Livre de l'impot foncier,' translated from Arabic and annotated by Edmond Fagnan, Paris, Paul Geuthner, 1991, pages 301-302) Abu Yusuf (d. 798 CE) History During his life, Muhammad made it the responsibility of the Islamic government to provide food and clothing, on a reasonable basis, to captives, regardless of their religion. If the prisoners were in the custody of a person, then the responsibility was on the individual.Maududi (1967), Introduction of Ad-Dahr, \\"Period of revelation\\", p. 159. Historically, Muslims routinely captured large number of prisoners. Aside from those who converted to Islam, most were ransomed or enslaved. Pasquier writes, According to accounts written by Muhammad's followers, after the Battle of Badr, some prisoners were executed for their earlier crimes in Mecca, but the rest were given options: They could convert to Islam and thus win their freedom; they could pay ransom and win their freedom; they could teach 10 Muslims to read and write and thus win their freedom. William Muir wrote of this period: During his rule, Caliph Umar made it illegal to separate related prisoners of war from each other, after a captive complained to him for being separated from her daughter.Naqvi (2000), pg. 456 These principles were also honoured during the Crusades, as exemplified by sultans such as Saladin and al-Kamil. For example, after al-Kamil defeated the Franks during the Crusades, Oliverus Scholasticus praised the Islamic laws of war, commenting on how al-Kamil supplied the defeated Frankish army with food: Treatment of prisoners Upon capture, the prisoners must be guarded and not ill-treated. Islamic law holds that the prisoners must be fed and clothed, either by the Islamic government or by the individual who has custody of the prisoner. This position is supported by the verse of the Quran. The prisoners must be fed in a dignified manner, and must not be forced to beg for their subsistence.Maududi (1967), introduction of Ad-Dahr, \\"Period of revelation\\", pg. 159 Muhammad's early followers also considered it a principle to not separate prisoners from their relatives. After the fighting is over, prisoners are to be released, with some prospect of survival, or ransomed. The freeing or ransoming of prisoners by Muslims themselves is highly recommended as a charitable act. The Qur'an also urges kindness to captives(, , ) and recommends, their liberation by purchase or manumission. The freeing of captives is recommended both for the expiation of sins(, , ) and as an act of simple benevolence.(, , )Lewis 1990, page 6. All Qur'anic citations are his. However, the Quran also permits certain forms of torture against certain captives, such as those who are deemed as waging war against Islam, disbelievers, adulterers and fornicators.( ) =Women and children= Some Muslim scholars claim that women and children prisoners of war cannot be killed under any circumstances, regardless of their faith, but that they may be enslaved, freed or ransomed. Women who are neither freed nor ransomed by their people were to be kept in bondage and referred to as ma malakat aymanukum (slaves). Some modern Islamic extremist groups have taken slaves, including women and children. Abubakar Shekau, the leader of Boko Haram, a Nigerian extremist group, said in an interview \\"I shall capture people and make them slaves\\" when claiming responsibility for the 2014 Chibok kidnapping. Shekau has justified his actions by appealing to the Quran saying \\"[w]hat we are doing is an order from Allah, and all that we are doing is in the Book of Allah that we follow\\". In October 2014, in its digital magazine Dabiq, ISIL explicitly claimed religious justification for enslaving Yazidi women. Specifically, ISIL argued that the Yazidi were idol worshipers and justified the sexual slavery of the captured non-muslim victims as a permissible practice of enjoying the spoils of war.

This opinion was also upheld by the Muslim judge, Sa'id bin Jubair (665-714 AD) and Abu Yusuf, a classical jurist from the Hanafi school of jurisprudence. El Fadl argues the reason Muslim jurists adopted this position was largely because it was consistent with the war practices of the Middle Ages. Muhammad Hamidullah, while reminding that execution in such cases was exceptional and depending on many factors, further precises that beheading was discouraged: \\"unanimity was reached among the Companions of the Prophet not to behead prisoners of war. In short, capital punishment for prisoners of war is only permissible in extreme cases of necessity and in the higher interests of the State.\\"Muhammad Hamidullah, Muslim Conduct of State, Muhammad Ashraf (1945), pp. 208-209 Most contemporary Muslim scholars prohibit altogether the killing of prisoners and hold that this was the policy practiced by Muhammad.Hashmi (2003), pg. 145 The 20th-century Muslim scholar, Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi states that no prisoner should be \\"put to the sword\\" in accordance with a saying of Muhammad.Maududi (1998), p. 34 Yusuf Ali, another 20th-century Muslim scholar, while commenting on verse , writes, Maududi further states that Islam forbids torturing, especially by fire, and quotes Muhammad as saying, \\"Punishment by fire does not behoove anyone except the Master of the Fire [God].\\" Quoting from the sources, Muhammad Munir, from the Department of Law of the International Islamic University, Pakistan, says that early religious authorities standing against the execution of POWs at all include 'Ali b. Abi Tãlib, Al-Hasan b. al-Hasan al-Basrl (d. 110/728), Hammãd b. Abi Sulaymän (d. 120/737), Muhammad b. Sirin (d. 110/728), Mujãhid b. Jabr (d. 103/721), 'Abd al-Mãlik b. 'Abd al-'Azïz b.

Ahmad al-Qurtubl (d. 671/1272), who shares to vindicate the sheer impossibility of execution if we follow the letter of the Qur'an.Muhammad Munir, \\"Debates on the Rights of Prisoners of War in Islamic Law\\" in Islamic Studies, Vol. 49, No. 4 (Winter 2010), p. 473 Ibn Rushd (d. 594/1198) is also quoted: \\"[A] number of jurists did not permit executing the prisoners of war. Al-Hasan b. Muhammad al-Tamïmï (d. 656/1258) stated consensus (ijma) of the Companions on this view.\\"Muhammad Munir, \\"Debates on the Rights of Prisoners of War in Islamic Law\\" in Islamic Studies, Vol. 49, No. 4 (Winter 2010), p. 470 He further shows that the rare executions were more due to the crimes they committed before the captivity than their status of POW itself. A famous case being 'Abd Allah b. Khatal. One of the few persons who weren't granted immunity at the conquest of Mecca. A group of people which \\"could have been punished by a tribunal should there have been one at the time”.

The chamber reamer is inserted into the bore of a barrel and held stationary while the barrel is turned around it (typically by means of a lathe). The reamer slowly cuts away material, leaving a chamber capable of accepting a specific cartridge.Chambering Rifles for Accuracy (Gunsmithing Student Handbook Series). Fred Zeglin Gordy Gritters (2018). 124 pag. Chamber reamers come in two general types - solid pilot reamers and floating pilot reamers. A solid pilot reamer has, as the name suggests, a solid steel pilot on the end to guide the reamer through the bore of the barrel. These reamers are generally more durable and less expensive than floating pilot reamers. Floating pilot reamers use interchangeable pilots that are positioned at the front of the reamer. The primary advantage of a floating pilot reamer is that it is self- centering and can be fitted with a pilot that is an exact match with the barrel it is passing through. Barrels tend to vary in diameter by minute amounts, and this variation can create a situation whereby the solid pilot reamer fits too loosely or too snugly in the bore. Another advantage of floating pilot reamers is that the pilot itself does not spin with the reamer, and therefore is less likely to damage the bore. The primary disadvantage of the floating point reamer is that the nose of the reamer must be cut down in diameter to accommodate the reamer pilot, resulting in a more delicate reamer.Chambering a Rifle Barrel by Bill Marr, March 2013, in RIFLESHOOTER.COM Chamber reamers are typically made of high speed steel and require lubrication during the cutting operation. A chamber reamer, regardless of pilot design, will operate most efficiently at speed of 200 to 300 RPM, and feed rate just fast enough to avoid chatter. Chamber reamers are designed with flutes to collect and extract the cut material, however these flutes must be periodically cleaned (typically after every .2\\" of cutting). Finally, reamers must be sharpened from time to time. Given proper care, a reamer can cut 10-15 chambers between sharpening. Manufacturers produce most chamber reamers to SAAMI specifications so that any factory ammunition can be safely used in any firearm chambered with their reamer, for a given cartridge. Most reamer manufacturers will, however, produce reamers to customer specifications. These are useful to benchrest shooter who are willing to trade off compatibility for accuracy, and by 'wildcatters' - individuals who are interested in designing completely new cartridges.

Also discussed are some of the differences regarding rights with respect to different schools of thought.  Muhammad  Muhammad established laws and examples (sunnah) in respect of which is obligatory for the Muslim community to follow. Muhammad had seven children, three boys and four girls. All of his sons, including Ibrahim ibn Muhammad, died in infancy. Because of this, his experience as a father is sometimes described as \\"sorrowful\\". Muhammad also had an adopted son, Zayd, who is said to be the object of Muhammad's parental affection. He also had two grandsons, Hassan and Hussein, and three granddaughters, Umm Kulthum, Zaynab, and Umamah.Stewart, p.113 In one Islamic tradition, Muhammad ran after Hussein in a game until he caught him. Muhammad used to let Umamah sit on his shoulders while he was praying. When someone expressed astonishment at the Prophet when the Prophet kissed his grandchild, he responded, \\"what can I do if God has deprived your heart of all human feeling?\\" Muhammad has been described as being very fond of children in general. Watt attributes this to Muhammad's yearning for children, as most of his own children died before him.Watt (1974), p. 230 He comforted a child whose pet nightingale had died.Phipps, p. 120 Muhammad played many games with children, joked with them and befriended them. Muhammad also showed love to children of other religions. Once he visited his Jewish neighbor's son when the child was sick.Yust, p.72-3 Once, Muhammad was sitting with a child in his lap, and the child urinated over Muhammad. Embarrassed, the father scolded the child. Muhammad restrained the father, and advised him: \\"This is not a big issue. My clothes can be washed. But be careful with how you treat the child. What can restore his self-esteem after you have dealt with him in public like this?\\"  Rights of children  A Muslim couple and their toddler at Masjid al-Haram, Makkah, Saudi Arabia. * Children have the right to be fed, clothed, and protected until they reach adulthood. * Children must have the respect, to enjoy love and affection from their parents. * Children have the right to be treated equally, vis-a-vis their siblings in terms of financial gifts.Reported by Imam Bayhaqi Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal said that preferential treatment of a child is permitted if he or she is handicapped while others are not. (In Al-Mughni, vol. 5, p. 605, it is stated that special treatment of a child is permissible due to a need, a handicap, blindness, his or her being from a large family, being engaged in studies, or something of the sort, as it is also permitted to withhold from a child who would spend what he is given on sinful or wicked things.) * The child has the right to be not forced by its step parents or its birth parents. * Children have the right to education. * Parents are recommended to provide adequately for children in inheritance. A Hadith says, “It is better for parents to leave their children well provided (financially) than to leave them in poverty”. Parents demonstrating an unearned preference for one child over the other is considered an act of injustice, as it could lead to an atmosphere of hatred, anger and dismay amongst the children in a household. But if a parent granted one of his children financial help to fulfill a necessity, such as a medical treatment coverage, then such a grant would not be categorized an act of injustice and unfairness. Such a gift will fall under the right to spend in the essential needs of the children, which is a requirement that a parent must fulfill. * A father is responsible for teaching his children according to Islam as follows: #Basic information about belief and worship #Basic information about high moral qualities #Information on what to be careful about in relations with other people #Vocational education Muhammad said: \\"Every one of you is a protector and guardian and responsible for your wards and things under your care and a man is a guardian of his family members, and is accountable for those placed under his charge.\\" (Bukhari and Muslim) * Marrying children when they are old enough to get married One of the rights that children have over their parents is to be provided with marriage when they are old enough, without delaying it. Both the Quran and Muhammed orders that young people and orphans be married when they are old enough.  Rights of parents  * The first and foremost right of the parents is to be obeyed and respected by their children. A hadith records that Muhammad defined \\"the greatest of great sins\\" as polytheism and refusing to obey one's parents. * The mother has the right to receive the best treatment than accorded to any other person, in addition the mother has the right of custody of the child in general circumstances, at least until she remarries. * Parents have the right to be looked after by their children, and to receive physical or financial help as necessary, especially in their old age but also parents must not force its children/child as it is sharia.  Marriage  =Consent= All Sunni/Shia schools of thought agree that forced marriages are strictly forbidden in Islam, as Islamic marriages are contracts between two consenting parties referred to as mithaq. A hadith attributed to Muhammad states that a woman cannot be given to a man in marriage without consulting her first, and her consent is obtained either by her agreeing to the marriage or by her remaining silent. In addition, Muhammad gave women the power to annul their marriages if it was found that they had been married against their consent. In Islam, marriage is essentially a contract. However, the distinction between sacred and secular was never explicit in Islam, so it is not only a secular contract. For a valid marriage, the following conditions must be satisfied, according to the major Islamic schools of jurisprudence: * There must be a clear proposal. * There must be a clear acceptance, but silence is taken as acceptance as well. * In Sunni Islam only, there must be at least two competent witnesses. This is necessary to exclude illicit sex and to safeguard legitimacy of progeny. It is recommended that marriage should be widely publicized. * There must be a marriage gift, little or more, by the bridegroom to the bride. The Maliki school of thought gives the right of ijbar to the guardian. Ijbar is defined as the annulment of marriage due to objection by male guardian. According to Malik ibn Anas, children due to their immaturity may choose an unsuitable partner for themselves, hence, the power of ijbar has been given to the guardian so that he may overrule the child to marry someone he thinks is unsuitable for her. This is the legal right given to the guardian for girls by Maliki school of thought. In addition, Islam requires that parents be followed in almost every circumstances, hence parents may ask their children to divorce a certain person, but this cannot be upheld in an Islamic court of law and is not a legal right of the parent. =Age of marriage= No age limits have been fixed by Islam for marriage according to Reuben Levy,Levy, p.106 and \\"quite young children may be legally married\\". The girl may not live with the husband however until she is fit for marital sexual relations. The Hanafi madhhab of Islamic fiqh maintains that a wife must not be taken to her husband's house until she reaches the condition of fitness for sexual relations. Levy adds: In Islamic legal terminology, Baligh refers to a person who has reached maturity, puberty or adulthood and has full responsibility under Islamic law. Legal theorists assign different ages and criteria for reaching this state for both males and females.John Esposito, Islam, Oxford University Press 2003 In marriage baligh is related to the Arabic legal expression, hatta tutiqa'l-rijal, which means that the wedding may not take place until the girl is physically fit to engage in sexual intercourse. Some Hanafi scholars hold the opinion that sexual intercourse may take place before puberty, as long as it's not injurious to one's health. In comparison, baligh or balaghat concerns the reaching of sexual maturity which becomes manifest by the menses. The age related to these two concepts can, but need not necessarily, coincide. Only after a separate condition called rushd, or intellectual maturity to handle one's own property, is reached can a girl receive her bridewealth.Masud, Islamic Legal Interpretation, Muftis and Their Fatwas, Harvard University Press, 1996  Adoption and fostering  Islam highly recommends the \\"fostering\\" of children, defined as \\"assuming partial or complete responsibility of a child in lieu of the biological parents\\". However, Islam forbids naming the child as one's own, or creating any \\"fictive relationships\\". Islamic adoption is sometimes called \\"fostering\\" or \\"partial adoption\\" and is similar to \\"open adoption\\".Ingrid Matison, \\"Adoption and Fostering\\", Encyclopedia of Women & Islamic Cultures Traditionally Islam has viewed legal adoption as a source of potential problems, such as accidentally marrying one's sibling or when distributing inheritance.A. Giladi, saqir, Encyclopedia of Islam, Brill If a child is adopted he or she does not become a son or daughter, but rather a ward of the adopting caretaker(s). The child's family name is not changed to that of the adopting parent(s) and his or her guardians are publicly known as such. Legally, this is close to other nations' systems for foster care. Other common rules governing adoption in Islamic culture address inheritance, marriage regulations, and the fact that adoptive parents are considered trustees of another individual's child rather than the child's new parents. Usually an adopted child inherits from his or her biological parents, not automatically from the adoptive parents. If the child is below the age of consent at the time of inheritance (from the biological family), his or her adoptive parents serve as trustees over the child's wealth, but may not intermingle with it. Adoption was a common practice in pre-Islamic Arabia. According to this custom, the adopted son would take the name of his adoptive parent, and would be assimilated into the family in a \\"legal sense\\". Islam viewed this practice as \\"erasure of natal identity\\". This practice was sometimes done for emotional reasons, such as pity, but adoption was also a means through which slaves were stripped of their identities and given the name of their slavemaster. The Quran replaced the pre-Islamic custom of adoption by the recommendation that \\"believers treat children of unknown origin as their brothers in the faith\\".Quran , From verses 4 and 5 in sura 33 (Al-Ahzab) in the Quran, Allah instructed adoptive parents to refer to their adoptive children by the names of their biological parents, if known:  See also  *Islam and humanity * Child marriage *Islamic views on slavery *Women in Islam *Religion and children *Muhammad's children  Notes   References   Phipps, William E (1999).Muhammad and Jesus: A Comparison of the Prophets and Their Teachings.

Life Exner came from one of the most important university families of the Austrian-Hungarian empire. The same Exner family included , , Sigmund Exner, and . Exner was the youngest of five children of parents Franz Serafin Exner and Charlotte Dusensy. His father Franz Serafin was, from 1831 to 1848, a professor of philosophy in Prague and from 1848 onwards was on the Board of Education in Vienna and an influential reformer of Austrian university education. He began his physics studies in Vienna in 1867 and attained a doctorate after an academic year in Zurich under August Kundt, also working with Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, in the year 1871 in Vienna. The largest influence on his training was Viktor von Lang for his 1872 habilitation with a work entitled \\"On the Diffusion through Liquid Lamellas\\" (\\"Über die Diffusion durch Flüssigkeitslamellen\\"). In 1879 he took up an appointment as extraordinary professor and in 1891 he was re-titled as full professor of the chemico-physical institute, 1902 to \\"second physical Institut\\", as a successor to Johann Josef Loschmidt, who had always worried about the \\"Exner children\\" as a close friend of family after the early death of his parents. When Exner was appointed 1908 as chancellor of the University of Vienna, he was at the pinnacle of his scientific activities. Achievements Franz Serafin Exner can be described as a physicist with a strong vision, cultivating versatile and highly educated pupils. He was a pioneer in numerous areas of modern physics. The early introduction of topics such as radioactivity, spectroscopy, electrochemistry (galvanic element), electricity in the atmosphere, and color theory in Austria can all be owed to Exner's doing. His most famous pupils included Marian Smoluchowski, a Viennese physicist of Polish descent, who discovered a theory independently of Albert Einstein and Friedrich Hasenöhrl for Brownian motion, and Victor Hess, whose attention for the exciting and extensive topic of atmospheric electricity and associated radioactivity was influenced by Franz Exner, together with Egon Schweidler, a pioneer in the study of the atmospheric electricity, and with Hess' discovery of \\"cosmic radiation\\" receiving the Nobel prize later, and the later Nobel prize winner Erwin Schroedinger, who began in 1911 as Exner's assistant, with \\"studies on the kinetics of dielectrics, melting point, pyro- and piezoelectricity\\" and finally Stefan Meyer. In the 1920s and 1930s most physics chairs were occupied by pupils of Exner: , Brno, later full professor in Prague; , Prague; Hans Benndorf, Graz; Marian Smoluchowski, Czernowitz, Krakau; Stefan Meyer, Vienna; Egon Schweidler, Innsbruck, Vienna; , extra full professor Vienna; Friedrich Hasenöhrl, Vienna; , Heinrich Mache, Vienna; Victor Conrad, Brünn, later USA; Felix Maria von Exner-Ewarten, Vienna; , Innsbruck; , Vienna; Felix Ehrenhaft, Vienna; , Brünn; Wilhelm Schmidt, Vienna; , Vienna; Victor Francis Hess, Graz, Innsbruck, New York; , Graz; Ludwig Flamm, Vienna; Erwin Schrödinger, Jena, Leipzig, Zurich, Berlin, Graz, Dublin, Vienna; and Hans Thirring, Vienna.

He began his career at The New Republic and wrote for Wired magazine's national security blog, Danger Room. From 2013 to 2017, Ackerman held the role of national security editor at the Guardian US. In 2017, Ackerman became the senior national security correspondent for The Daily Beast. In 2019, he is co- hosting, with Laura Hudson, the “Citadel Dropouts,” a Wired podcast about the final season of Game of Thrones. Life and career Ackerman was born to a Jewish family and graduated from Rutgers University where he was an editor for the Daily Targum student paper. In 2002, he moved to Washington, D.C. to become an intern and later an associate editor at The New Republic magazine. He initially supported the Iraq War, but became disillusioned. In 2004 he started Iraq'd, a blog on The New Republic website, which chronicled the dilemma of pro-war liberals. He also wrote, with John B. Judis, what many considered the definitive article that chronicled the chain of events that led to the Plame affair. In 2006 Ackerman was fired from TNR for \\"insubordination\\" (in TNR editor Franklin Foer's account) or \\"irreconcilable ideological differences\\" (in Ackerman's). He next wrote for The American Prospect (which offered him a job within a day of his firing) and Talking Points Memo. Ackerman blogged and reported on national security issues at The Washington Independent from the paper's creation in 2008 until 2010, when he left for Wired. Ackerman next maintained a personal blog, Attackerman, which was hosted at Firedoglake from June 2008 through December 2010. On December 29, 2010, he reported that he had to move his blog, saying, \\"the congressional press galleries are wary of giving me permanent credentials while I’m affiliated here.\\" In September 2011, Ackerman reported a series of articles for Wired, alleging anti-Islamic bias in FBI training materials. As a result, the FBI launched \\"a comprehensive review of all training and reference materials that relate in any way to religion or culture.\\" Ackerman has subsequently worked for The Guardian and The Daily Beast. At The Guardian, Ackerman was part of a team of editors and reporters awarded the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for public service journalism, for reporting on Edward Snowden and the National Security Agency's warrantless surveillance programs. In May 2017, he left his position as national security editor of The Guardian to join The Daily Beast. =JournoList= Ackerman was a member of the private Google Groups forum JournoList. Several JournoList comments by Ackerman on topics such as the Jeremiah Wright controversy were revealed by the Daily Caller. Ackerman, then of the Washington Independent, wrote, \\"I do not endorse a Popular Front, nor do I think you need to. It’s not necessary to jump to Wright-qua-Wright’s defense. What is necessary is to raise the cost on the right of going after the left. In other words, find a rightwinger’s [sic] and smash it through a plate-glass window. Take a snapshot of the bleeding mess and send it out in a Christmas card to let the right know that it needs to live in a state of constant fear. Obviously I mean this rhetorically.\\" James Taranto of the Wall Street Journal took issue with a particularly controversial e-mail from Ackerman: \\"If the right forces us all to either defend Wright or tear him down, no matter what we choose, we lose the game they've put upon us. Instead, take one of them — Fred Barnes, Karl Rove, who cares – and call them racists\\". A spokesman for Wired said that Ackerman would keep his job, saying \\"We hired Spencer Ackerman for his well-informed national security reporting and fully support it. Anyone with access to Google can discover his political leanings.\\" =CIA keeps photos of abused detainees= On March 28, 2016, writing in The Guardian, Ackerman reported that during the early 2000s, the CIA had taken photos of captives and detainees who were naked, before transporting them through extraordinary rendition to foreign countries for interrogation, often under torture. These photos are classified and are retained by the CIA. The CIA had illegally destroyed its extensive library of video tapes documenting the torture of the men and boys it had apprehended and detained through its covert \\"snatch teams\\". But it has retained these photos of naked, bruised and beaten detainees. Observers have seen some, which they describe as \\"gruesome\\". One commentator suggested it was part of a pattern of sexual abuse of prisoners. Another said that the photos were taken to show the condition of the prisoners before rendition.

Its last assignment was with Air Defense Command (ADC)'s Tenth Air Force, at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona. It was inactivated on 19 November 1969. Area of the 27th Air Division (1950–9) and subsequent 1959 Los Angeles Air Defense Sector Norton AFB Activated as the 27 Air Division (Defense) on 7 September 1950, the unit was assigned to ADC for most of its existence,until 1 December 1950, its parent Western Air Defense Force was part of Continental Air Command the division's initial air defense area was southern California and later southern Nevada (and a small portion of Arizona by 1953). The 4705th Defense Wing was a temporary unit that absorbed the 1st Fighter-Interceptor Wing's personnel and equipment five days after it was organized in early 1952 at Norton Air Force Base.Ravenstein, p. 6 These units included, for example, the 94th Fighter- Interceptor Squadron at George Air Force Base).Maurer, pp. 138, 262 The wing was discontinued and the 94th FIS reassigned directly to 27th Air Division, which had reorganized at Norton in February, one month later.Cornett & Johnson, p. 66 In May 1958, the 27th AD directed a hostile intercept of a \\"declared unknown\\" aircraft (without proper IFF), but the \\"interceptor pilot remembered...that opening bomb bay doors was to be considered a hostile act _only after_ declaration of an Air Defense Emergency or Warning Yellow or Red\\" (the SAC B-47 was on a Radar Bomb Scoring bomb run near the Los Angeles Bomb Plot.) The 27th AD was designated 1 of 23 NORAD divisions effective 10 June 1958 by NORAD General Order 6. \\"In May 1958, Western CONAD Region pointed out a weak area in the definitions of a hostile act uncovered in an incident in the 27th Air Division. A B-47 was declared unknown and intercepted, and then was observed opening its bomb bay doors prior to crossing Los Angeles. By the provisions of 55–6, the B-47 should have been declared hostile and destroyed. Fortunately, however, the interceptor pilot remembered the provisions of CONAD 55-3 which provided that opening bomb bay doors was to be considered a hostile act _only after_ declaration of an Air Defense Emergency or Warning Yellow or Red. The actions of the bomber, CFWCR continued, were standard practice for SAC aircraft on radar bomb scoring runs. And when the aircraft was known to be friendly, the practice was not dangerous. However, in cases such as the one in the 27th, the aircraft could possibly be declared hostile and shot down.\\" Planned 27th Air Division (Rocky Mountain) with Super Combat Center at Denver Rocky Mountain Division The \\"27th Air Division (Rocky Mountain)\\" was to transfer to the midwest with command of 2 NORAD sectors (Reno and Denver Air Defense Sectors) during deployment of SAGE. In addition to a hardened Air Defense Direction Center at Stead Air Force Base for the Reno sector; NORAD's 25 July 1958 SAGE Geographic Reorganization Plan identified the Super Combat Center/Direction Center (SCC/DC) nuclear bunker for the division was to be at Denver, Colorado (cf. the bunkers later planned for the Cheyenne Mountain Complex and in a Cripple Creek mine). The division's general area was west-to- east from the western Nevada state meridian (near the Sierra Escarpment) to the Great Plains near Oakley, Kansas; and north-south from mid-Wyoming to just south of the Four Corners latitude. Existing Permanent System radar stations in the planned Rocky Mountain Division included the Fallon, Tonopah, and Winnemucca Air Force Stations (the atomic-powered \\"SAGE feeder station\\" in the Black Hills NF became operational in 1962); and facilities and cities to be protected by the division included the Salt Lake City military installations west of the Rockies and planned Titan missile launch complexes and an Air Force Plant at the Colorado Front Range. The Reno sector was activated 15 February 1959 and the AN/FSQ-7 at Stead Air Force Base was replaced by Backup Interceptor Control (BUIC) at Fallon Naval Air Station by 1970. In February 1959, the Los Angeles Air Defense Sector was activated during the deployment of the Semi Automatic Ground Environment#Deployment (SAGE) as a subordinate unit of the 27th AD. However, the Denver SCC/CC was cancelled in March 1959; so instead of moving from the Southwest United States to the interior (and the 28th Air Division then taking over as the Southwestern Air Division), the 27th Air Division was inactivated on 1 October 1959 (command transferred to the subordinate Los Angeles Air Defense Sector). Luke AFB Reactivated in January 1966 at Luke Air Force Base, the 27th Air Division consolidation the Los Angeles and Phoenix Air Defense Sectors, and the division assumed the additional designation of 27th NORAD Region after activation of the NORAD Combat Operations Center at the Cheyenne Mountain Complex, Colorado. The Norton SAGE Direction Center closed in June 1966 (the Luke Direction Center was 1 of 6 still open in 1970). When the 27th AD was inactivated in 1969, its mission, personnel and operations center at Luke were transferred to the 26th Air Division.

Hōjō Takatoki (北条 高時) (1303 – 23 May 1333) was the last Tokusō and ruling Shikken (regent) of Japan's Kamakura shogunate; the rulers that followed were his puppets. A member of the Hōjō clan, he was the son of Hōjō Sadatoki, and was preceded as shikken by Hōjō Morotoki. Biography Takatoki became regent at the age of eight, and thus actual power was held for a time by Adachi Tokiaki, his grandmother, and Nagasaki Takasuke, a minister assigned to him. Takatoki fell ill in 1326, at the age of twenty-three, some time after having taken power himself; the shogunate was under attack at this time, and would fall within a few years. Takatoki retired and became a Buddhist monk, though he still held some influence at court. That same year, the shogunal government asked Emperor Go-Daigo to abdicate in favor of his successor, in order to continue the tradition of cloistered rule and the alternation of branches of the Imperial family within the line of succession; Go-Daigo chose to maintain rule, and the ensuing controversy would lead to the Nanboku-chō Wars in which agents of the two Imperial branch families would come to outright war. George Sansom thus describes this move on the part of the shogunate a \\"fatal blunder\\" and describes Takatoki as \\"scarcely sane. His judgement was poor, his conduct erratic. He indulged in extremes of luxury and debauch\\". Upon retirement, he handed over his duties to \\"certain unworthy deputies\\".Sansom, George (1958). A History of Japan to 1334. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press. p465. In 1331, as events began to come to a boil, Takatoki argued with his advisor Nagasaki over how to react to the Burei-kō plot, in which members of the Hino clan, loyal to Go-Daigo, conspired against the shogunate. This was but one of many events leading up to the outbreak of war, and the conflicts within the shogunal administration, between Takatoki and others, meant slow reactions and inadequate handling of such situations. Ashikaga Takauji would soon be placed in command of the shogunate's armies, to be mobilized against Go-Daigo's supporters; strongly supported by Takatoki, this support and trust was misplaced, for Takauji would soon use these same armies against Kamakura, tearing down the Minamoto/Hōjō government and establishing his own Ashikaga shogunate. Takatoki committed suicide alongside his family during the 1333 Siege of Kamakura, one of the most dramatic events of that war, when forces of Nitta Yoshisada set fire to Kamakura, putting an end to the Kamakura shogunate.Sansom, George (1963). \\"A history of Japan 1334–1615.\\" Eight Printing (1993).

Founded in 1962, it is Canada's oldest civil liberties association. It is based in Vancouver and is jointly funded by the Law Foundation of British Columbia and by private citizens through donations and memberships. The BCCLA, through its staff lawyers and pro bono counsel, litigates constitutional issues and commonly appears as an intervenor, applicant, or plaintiff at all levels of Canadian courts, including the Supreme Court of Canada. The association's work is guided by the rights and liberties embodied in such documents as Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms, France's Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the bills of rights in the United States, Britain, and Canada. The association is unaffiliated with any other organization or political group; however, the association often works cooperatively with other organizations, such as Pivot Legal Society, the John Howard Society, and the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, on common causes. The BCCLA has been consulted by both the governments of Canada and British Columbia on proposed actions or policies that may give rise to civil liberties or human rights concerns. In the early 1980s, the association was invited to appear before the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and the House of Commons on the Constitution to participate in the public consultations on the proposed Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The association was consulted by the federal government in its creation of the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA, 2000) and by British Columbia's government in its creation of the Personal Information Privacy Act (PIPA, 2003).

History =1960s=  Events preceding the association: trial of the Fraternal Council of the Sons of Freedom  The events preceding the formation of the BCCLA involved a Kootenays, British Columbia sect of the Doukhobors known as the Fraternal Council of the Sons of Freedom. On March 6, 1962, members of the sect used explosives to bring down a 100-meter tower supporting power transmission lines crossing Kootenay Lake to a lead and zinc mine in Kimberly, British Columbia. As a result, over one thousand mine workers were laid off until power to the mining operations could be restored. Civic leaders called on the federal government to respond to the bombing with \\"drastic action\\" and the government of British Columbia offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of those responsible. Fearing vigilantism on the part of the miners or others affected by the sect's actions, the RCMP brought in one hundred officers from the prairies to watch over the tensions. On March 24, 1962, RCMP officers, on the strength of two confessions of sect members implicating the Sons of Freedom, arrested fifty-seven members of the sect. The members were charged, along with ten other members that were already in custody, with conspiracy to intimidate the Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of British Columbia. Due to tensions in the Kootenays, the venue for the trial was moved approximately 500 kilometers, from Nelson, British Columbia to New Westminster, British Columbia. The preliminary trial began on June 11, 1962 with Nelson Magistrate William Evans presiding. In court, the two confessions were withdrawn with the members claiming duress. Despite over 98 witness testimonies and the Crown presenting over 500 pages of seized documents as evidence, on August 7, 1962 Magistrate Evans dismissed the Crown's case on the basis that there was insufficient evidence to proceed to trial. Meanwhile, 104 members of the sect, including children, continued to be detained on remand at Mountain Institution in Agassiz, British Columbia. Birth of the association  On December 9, 1962, a meeting of 80 people was held in Vancouver at the University of British Columbia in response to the ongoing detention of Doukhobors at Mountain Institution. This would mark the first official meeting of the BCCLA. The association was incorporated under the Societies Act on February 27, 1963. Under the leadership of Phillip Hewett, an Anglican minister, a board of directors formed and a committee was struck and a \\"Doukhobour defence fund\\" was created to fund litigation and investigation into the Mountain Institution issue. Subsequent to its formation, the BCCLA successfully fought for release of the detainees.  Other activities  The BCCLA's other activities in the 1960s included: * Aiding in the defence of The Georgia Straight, a Vancouver-based publication, against criminal obscenity charges =1970s=  The Gallimaufry Players' obscenity trial  On October 27, 1969, a small group of professional actors, directors, and designers known as the Gallimaufry Players began a two- week run of Michael McClure's The Beard at Davie Street's Riverqueen theatre. The play, about an imaginary encounter between Billy the Kid and Jean Harlow, was replete with expletives and ended with a scene of simulated cunnilingus. On November 5, plainclothes members of the Vancouver City Police morality squad attended the performance. The following day, three members of the Gallimaufry Players and the two proprietors of the Riverqueen were criminally charged with presenting an obscene performance. All five defendants were convicted at trial on May 28, 1971 in the Provincial Court of Vancouver and fined a total of $1,250. The BCCLA launched an immediate appeal at the British Columbia County Court of Vancouver. The appeal was heard over four days in November 1971 by Judge Ladner. The police officers that witnessed the performance testified that expletives were uttered on stage, and that it was impossible to know if the actress was wearing an undergarment during the simulated cunnilingus. The defence presented a series of witnesses, including drama critics from the Vancouver Sun and Vancouver Province newspapers, a drama teacher, a television critic, and an Anglican minister who testified that the words and scenes described by the police officers could not be isolated from the overall context of the play.R. v. Small, [1973] B.C.J. No. 783 The judge found the defence witnesses to be \\"of a certain segment of the community and, while due consideration must and has been given to their evidence, their opinions cannot be accepted as representative of community standards\\" and that \\"the standards of decency and measure of tolerance in the Canadian community at this time could not but be offended by the realistic simulation of cunnilingus on the stage.\\" The judge found the evidence insufficient to prove that one of the five defendants, Henry Yeagher, the Gallimaufry's stage manager, was in charge of the production at the time and dismissed the charge against him. The four remaining defendants had their fines set aside in favour of suspended sentences. The BCCLA launched a further appeal to the British Columbia Court of Appeal. The appeal was heard by Chief Justice Nathaniel Nemetz and Associate Justices Robertson and Branca. Justice Robertson referred to the play as \\"unsavoury\\" and noted that \\"among its 9,000 words it uses 4 'four-letter words' a total of 132 times.\\" Chief Justice Nemetz stated that he \\"would agree that the last scene would offend many people.\\" Despite their personal views of the play, all three judges ruled in favour of the defendants, quashed the convictions, and ordered a new trial. In his reasons, Chief Justice Nemetz stated that \\"it is not the personal taste of a judge that determines whether a work is obscene or not\\" and concluded that Judge Ladner had \\"misdirected himself\\" when he \\"rejected the uncontradicted evidence of all the witnesses for the defence in their totality [and] in doing so he substituted a finding of fact which was unsupported by the evidence.\\" Chief Justice Nemetz ultimately concluded that Judge Ladner should have tested the play against \\"contemporary standards and to the time, place and circumstances of this performance.\\"  Other activities  The BCCLA's other activities in the 1970s included: * The first publication of the Democratic Commitment, the association's biannual newsletter * Advocating for removal of homosexuality as a grounds of exclusion from Canada from the Immigration Act * Advocating for the repeal of provisions of the Factories Act that allowed discrimination against women =1980s=  Submissions on the Charter of Rights and Freedoms  The BCCLA provided written submissions and appeared before the Joint Committee of the Senate and the House of Commons on the Constitution to advocate for several changes before the finalized Charter of Rights and Freedoms was signed into law by Queen Elizabeth II on April 17, 1982. When the BCCLA learned in 1980 that Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau's government was planning a series of constitutional reforms that would include the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the association began submitting comments and recommendations to the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and the House of Commons on the Constitution. On November 13, 1980, then president Reg Robson submitted an 18-page brief to the joint committee. The letter outlined the association's eagerness to support \\"entrenchment of a Charter of Rights which would affirm the rights and freedoms that we believe are fundamental for the Canadian people, and which would guide the legislatures and direct the courts of this country to protect and uphold those rights.\\" Subsequent to submitting its written brief, the association was invited to appear before the joint committee. Despite the association's eagerness for Canadians to have entrenched constitutional rights and freedoms, the association was concerned that the government's public claims about the Charter were misleading and unsupported by the actual wording contained in the government's proposal. The association urged the government to extend the time for public and Parliamentary consideration, and suggested revisions in several areas of the proposed Charter to address these concerns: * \\"Illusory protection of fundamental freedoms\\": The association argued that having a limitation clause in Section 1 that \\"'guarantees' the rights and freedoms set out in the Charter 'subject to only such reasonable limits as are generally accepted in a free and democratic society'\\" undermines the very purpose of having entrenched rights and freedoms. The association was particularly concerned with the potential implications that Section 1 could have for minorities, as their rights could be limited to \\"what is 'reasonable' [and that] is what is 'generally accepted' by the majority\\". While advocating for the deletion of Section 1, the association acknowledged that emergency powers may be warranted to justify temporary infringements on citizen's rights; however, the association requested further consultation in that regard. * \\"Inadequate protection of legal rights\\": The association was concerned with the wording of the legal rights in sections 7–14 of the draft Charter involving search, seizure, detention, imprisonment, and bail. Each of these rights was worded in a manner that allow it to be limited \\"on grounds, and in accordance with procedures, established by law.\\" The association's concern was courts would be limited to determining whether the challenged activities, such as a police search, were \\"established by law\\" and could not look beyond this to determine whether the law itself was just or constitutional. In addition to these recommended changes, the association proposed several additions: * \\"Search and seizure on reasonable grounds and by warrant only\\": The association argued against the continued use of writs of assistance — documents that provide police and others with broad powers of entry, search, and seizure, including the power to search any person or place at any time for any reason related to the legislation under which the writ was issued. For example, writs were available under the Narcotics Control Act and the Food and Drug Act. The association argued that writs allowed for the \\"gross invasion of privacy... on the flimsiest of excuses and the wide potential for their abuse makes them an unjustifiable anachronism in a 'free and democratic society'\\". Apart from exceptional circumstances, the entry, search, and seizure powers of Section 8, argued the association, should not be exercised without prior judicial authorization in the form of a warrant specifying the person or place, time, and items in question. * \\"Arrest on reasonable and probable grounds only\\": Although the association recognized that Section 7 of the draft Charter, which provided that no one can be deprived of his or her liberty \\"except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice\\" may cover arrest, the association argued that Section 9 of the draft Charter should \\"include an unambiguous statement that no citizen can be arrested except on reasonable and probable grounds.\\" The association's concern was that without this addition, powers of arrest would rely on judicial interpretation of Section 7 alone, which may lead to different results. * \\"The right to remain silent\\": The association was concerned with the absence of an explicit right of silence in Section 10 (rights of a person upon detention or arrest), Section 11 (rights of a person upon being charged with an offence), or Section 13 (right against self-incrimination for a compelled witness) and argued for its inclusion. The association stated that a right to silence is a cornerstone of a criminal justice system in a society that truly respects the dignity and integrity of citizens: \\"in order to maintain a fair balance when the might of the state is focused on prosecuting a single individual, the justice system in democratic societies has demanded that the government seeking to punish the individual must produce the evidence against him by its own independent labours, rather than by the simpler, and often cruel expedient of compelling it from his own mouth.\\" * \\"The right to counsel\\": The association argued that Section 10's wording was ambiguous and should be clarified to explicitly recognize a right to counsel for anyone detained or arrested, regardless of whether or not that person has money available to \\"retain\\" such counsel. * \\"The exclusionary rule\\": The association argued against Section 26 of the draft Charter that stated \\"[no] provision of this Charter [except for Section 13] affects the laws respecting the admissibility of evidence in any proceedings or the authority of Parliament of a legislature to make laws in relation thereto.\\" The association argued that rights dealing with search and seizure, the right to silence and right to counsel were not fully meaningful unless the Charter contained a provision to exclude illegally obtained evidence: \\"prosecutions and convictions for illegal acts should not rest on grounds which are themselves tainted by illegality.\\" * \\"Right to a fair hearing\\": The association pointed out the absence in the draft Charter of \\"the right of a person to a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice for the determination of his rights and obligations\\" as was included in prime minister Trudeau's earlier 1969 proposal and in the Canadian Bill of Rights. The association argued for inclusion of such a provision, but with its language changed to explicitly include all instances of decision-making determining rights and obligations, including administrative tribunals, and not just criminal proceedings. The association identified additional areas of concern with the draft Charter: * Aboriginal rights: The associated was concerned that the current and future rights of Aboriginals were not adequately protected by the draft Charter. The association pointed to Section 24 which would preserve rights \\"presently established by law\\" and noted that it would not protect future rights. The association was also concerned that the draft Charter would preclude the federal government from exercising its powers under section 91(24) of the British North American Act to protect the rights of Aboriginal people, and that the draft Charter may invalidate rights contained in the Indian Act and return jurisdiction of several Aboriginal matters from the federal government to the provinces. The association urged the government to give their submissions, and those made separately by Aboriginal peoples, careful consideration. * Enforcement and remedies: The association was concerned with how the Charter would be enforced. It noted that the only remedy provided in Section 25 of the draft Charter for violations of the Charter was to declare a law inoperative. The association noted that violations will not only be limited to laws that are inconsistent with the Charter but with the actions of public officers and agencies that are in violation of constitutional rights. The association urged the committee to provide the courts with inherent jurisdiction to provide an adequate remedy for such violations. * Equality: The association argued that Section 15 of the Charter should not be limited to the traditional grounds of discrimination covered in the draft, and that the section should be expanded to include protect against discrimination based on physical disability, former criminal conviction, and sexual orientation. * Official languages in courts: The association argued that Section 19 of the draft Charter, which provided for the availability of official languages (i.e. French and English) in courts \\"established by Parliament\\" should be extended to \\"all provincial courts having the same jurisdiction as the B.C. Supreme Court and the B.C. Court of Appeal.\\" * Right to trial by jury: The association observed that a right to trial by a jury was absent from the draft Charter and argued for its inclusion. * Amendment procedure: The association noted that the Charter could be amended by referendum pursuant to sections 42 and 50 of the draft proposal and argued against inclusion of these sections stating that \\"'protecting' minority rights by allowing them to be changed, limited or eliminated by majority in a referendum is no protection whatsoever.\\" Other activities The BCCLA's other activities in the 1980s included: * Challenging the use of writs of assistance under the Narcotic Control Act which allowed police to enter any dwelling to search for drugs without a warrant * Challenging the provincial government's attempt to remove abortion from government provided health coverage * Challenging the provincial Schools Act which required mandatory reading of the Lord's Prayer * Challenging the British Columbia's provincial electoral boundaries =1990s= The BCCLA's activities in the 1990s included: * Providing the federal government with a legal brief detailing the legislative options regarding assisted suicide * Publication of \\"The Privacy Handbook: A Practical Guide to Your Privacy Rights in BC and How to Protect Them\\" and \\"The Citizenship Handbook: A Guide to Rights and Responsibilities for New Canadians\\" * Challenging the required teaching of the \\"theory of divine creation\\" in Abbotsford, British Columbia schools * Intervening in the BC College of Teachers refusal to recognize Trinity Western University's teaching certification based on the university's views of homosexuality * The BCCLA also intervened in several criminal trials, including:  R v Cuerrier – a case involving man charged with aggravated assault for having unprotected sex with women while knowing he was HIV- positive  R v Sharpe - a case involving child pornography charges for, among other things, possessing private stories and pictures the accused had drawn =2000s= The BCCLA's activities in the 2000s included: * Challenging a New Westminster by-law that banned those convicted of street drug trafficking from sections of the city * Intervening in Chamberlin et al. v The Board of Trustees of Surrey regarding a school board's refusal to approve three books that portrayed families parented by same-sex couples * Helping to create the provincial Personal Information and Protection Act (PIPA) to help regulate the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information in the private sector * Intervening in a Supreme Court of Canada reference regarding same-sex marriage * Participating in a provincial inquiry into the death of Frank Paul, who died of hypothermia after being left in an alley by police * Intervening in a US Supreme Court case challenging the continued detention of Canadian child soldier Omar Khadr at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba =2010s=  2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics legal observer program  BC Civil Liberties Association legal observers outside Vancouver Art Gallery on February 12, 2010In September 2009, the BCCLA, in partnership with Pivot Legal Society, announced the creation of its Olympic legal observer program, the first of its kind in Olympic history. The program trained 250 volunteers to observe and record security and police actions at the opening ceremonies and at major demonstrations outside sporting events and in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside during the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics. The impetus for the program was a concern that hosting the Olympics would cause Vancouver's homeless citizens to be displaced and free speech and protest rights to be interfered with. Volunteers were instructed to observe police and other security actions in a \\"neutral and professional manner\\" and to report possible right violations back to the BCCLA's volunteer lawyers who would then attempt, informally or through court action, to resolve matters. In an effort to familiarize officers with program, the Vancouver Police Department and RCMP Integrated Security Unit agreed to provide legal observer training to senior officers. After the Opening Ceremonies on February 12, 2010 the BCCLA stated that they were \\"very pleased with the effective and restrained policing of the demonstrations that [its legal observers] observed prior to and during the Opening Ceremonies\\" and recorded \\"very few incidents involving police.\\" On February 23, midway through the games, then BCCLA executive director David Eby stated that \\"we haven't seen the excesses we worried about.\\" Vancouver Police Department spokesperson Constable Lindsey Houghton commented that the legal observer program helped police maintain public transparency throughout the games.  Trinity Western University law school  Trinity Western University (TWU), a private religious university, sought the Law Society of British Columbia's permission to start a law school to offer a legal education program prerequisite to bar admission. The Law Society denied permission to the proposed law school based on the TWU's Community Covenant that was mandatory for students to sign as a condition of admission to the school and that among other things, discriminated against LGBTQI+ persons by prohibiting sexual intimacy outside the confines of a marriage between a man and a woman. Initially, BCCLA took the position based on arguments of religious freedom that TWU’s proposed law school should not be barred from accreditation. On January 22, 2018, after full and vigorous debate of the issues and principles that extended over a period of months, the BCCLA Board of Directors voted, by a substantial margin, to adopt the position that \\"the Law Society should not accredit a prerequisite legal education program whose admission and conduct policies discriminate against people based on prohibited grounds, thereby creating a discriminatory barrier around part of the stream of access to the legal profession.\\" On June 15, 2018, The Supreme Court of Canada upheld the decision of the Law Society to deny permission to TWU.Law Society of British Columbia v. Trinity Western University, 2018 SCC 32. The BCCLA's other activities in the 2010s include: * Participating in the Braidwood inquiry into the death of Robert Dziekanski, who died after being tasered five times by RCMP officers at Vancouver International Airport * Challenging the constitutionality of solitary confinement practices in Canada's federal prisons on the basis that the practices are cruel and unusual punishment and discriminatory towards Aboriginal people and those with mental health issues * Challenging Canada's medically assisted dying laws in Carter v Canada (Attorney General) and opposing the federal government's post-Carter restrictions on assisted dying. * Challenging current solitary confinement practices in Canadian prisons * Challenging the legality of the Communications Security Establishment Canada's (CSEC) spying activities against Canadians * Lobbying for legislation to protect individuals and non-profit organizations from meritless lawsuits by large organizations that are intended to silence freedom of expression Publications The BCCLA is an active publisher. It has published its biannual newsletter, The Democratic Commitment, since 1972. The association publishes several handbooks, including: HIV Testing Handbook: A Guide To Your Rights (2014; English); Rights Talk: Students and Civil Liberties at School (2013; English); Electronic Devices: A Guide To Your Rights (2012; English); The Arrest Handbook: A Guide to Your Rights (2002; English, Spanish, Arabic, and Vietnamese); and, The Citizenship Handbook: A Guide to Democratic Rights and Responsibilities (2008; English, Chinese, Punjabi, Vietnamese, and Farsi). In 2015, the association marked the passing of its 50th anniversary with the publication of 50 Years of Freedom: A Festschrift Celebration for the Golden Anniversary of the BCCLA, a collection of essays and other writings. It has developed over 200 policy briefs which serve as the cornerstones for its work. =Other publications= *(2002) The Teaching and Workshop Guide for ESL Teachers and Settlement Counselors *(2001) Kiddie Porn: Sexual Representation and the Robin Sharpe Case *(1995) Restricted Entry: Censorship on Trial *(1994) The Privacy Handbook: A Practical Guide to Your Privacy Rights and How to Protect Them *(1994) Protecting Rights and Freedoms: Essays on the Charter's Place in Canada's Political, Legal and Intellectual Life *(1992) Proceedings of the 1992 conference: The Charter: Ten Years After *(1990) Catastrophic Rights: Experimental Drugs and AIDS *(1989) The Burden of Office: Agamemnon and Other Losers *(1989) Liberties =Brochures= *The Facts About Drug Testing in the Workplace *Suggestions for Writing a Letter of Complaint to the Police See also * List of court cases involving the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association * Canadian Civil Liberties Association * Pivot Legal Society * Egale Canada * American Civil Liberties Union * American Civil Rights Union * Canadian Civil Liberties Association References External links * Category:Government watchdog groups in Canada Category:Human rights organizations based in Canada Category:Civil liberties advocacy groups Category:Legal advocacy organizations based in Canada Category:Political advocacy groups in Canada Category:Organizations based in Vancouver Category:Organizations established in 1962 Category:1962 establishments in British Columbia Category:Civil rights organizations in Canada ","title":"British Columbia Civil Liberties Association"},{"id":"8867567","text":"Prostitution in Myanmar (also known as Burma) is illegal, but widespread. Prostitution is a major social issue that particularly affects women and children. UNAIDS estimate there to be 66,000 prostitutes in the country. Women are often lured into prostitution with the promise of legitimate jobs, substantially higher pay, and because their low educational levels makes it difficult for them to find jobs elsewhere. In many instances, such women come from remote regions. Current situation In Yangon (Rangoon), prostitution often occurs in hotels that also operate as brothels. The recent appearance of massage parlours began in 1995, with ethnic minority groups such as the Wa running such businesses in particular. Nightclubs in Yangon are also frequented by prostitutes who work independently. Throughout the country, the sex industry generally operates out of restaurants, brothels posing as guesthouses, and nightclubs. Since Cyclone Nargis hit in May 2008, the number of prostitutes in Yangon has increased significantly, thus lowering prices for sexual services. Mandalay has many prostitutes working in massage parlours, KTV lounges, stage shows and on the streets. A red-light district has also emerged in Naypyidaw, Burma's new national capital, with brothels primarily disguised as beauty parlors and massage salons that attract mainly businessmen and military personnel. Approximately 70 brothels, mostly in the form of tents and bamboo huts, operate a cheap red light zone on a 30-mile stretch of highway to Naypyidaw. In all of Southeast Asia Burma is by far the cheapest when securing the services of a prostitute eclipsing even the choice and price in Laos. Sex workers and NGOs report law enforcement to be abusive, violent and corrupt. Names Prostitutes in Burma are called by a number of different terms. They are called (lit. \\"fulfilling the rod's hunger\\") and (lit. \\"blue mistress,\\" with \\"blue\\" being a reference to pornography). In slang usage, (\\"chicken\\"), (\\"female pimp\\"), (\\"female nat\\"), and (\\"fragrant flowers of the night\\") are also used. Legal situation Prostitution is illegal. Under the Suppression of Prostitution Act, enacted in 1949, the act of soliciting or seducing in public is illegal, as is forcing or enticing women into prostitution or owning brothels. The Act also criminalises making financial gain from prostitution, including the sex worker's own earnings. Condoms were previously used as evidence of prostitution but an administrative order was issued in 2011 to prevent condoms being used as evidence. This was subsequently incorporated in section 271 of the Penal Code. The Penal Code guarantees protection of female children from sexual abuse, with any persons found having sexual intercourse with a girl of under 14 years (with or without consent) charged with rape. The Child Law, enacted in 1993, raised the age of consensual sex to 16 and made prostitution of children illegal. It is an offence to knowingly allow a girl younger than sixteen years of age under one's guardianship to engage in prostitution. There is no obvious corresponding offence for boys. The Child Law also makes it a punishable offence to use children in the creation of pornographic materials. Sex workers are often placed in detention centres prior to being charged. Work, such as sewing clothes, is compulsory in the compulsory. Some are subsequently released without charge. In 2013, MP Daw Sandar Min called for prostitution to be decriminalised but this was rejected by the government. Currently (2018), the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement are working on amendments to the law in order to protect sex workers. History =Konbaung dynasty= Prostitution was banned in 1785, during the reign of King Bodawpaya in the early Konbaung dynasty period. When King Mindon Min founded Mandalay in the 1850s, a separate administrative quarter for prostitutes was included. =British rule= From the British occupation until 1937, Burma was part of colonial India.Imperial Gazetteer of India vol. IV (1908) pp. 104–125 The British sought to regulate prostitution as a matter of accepting a necessary evil. The Cantonment Acts regulated and structured prostitution in the British military bases. The structuring features of the Cantonment Acts provided for about twelve to fifteen Indian women for each regiment of British soldiers. Each regiment contained about a thousand soldiers. These women were kept in brothels called chaklas. They were licensed by military officials and were allowed to consort with soldiers only. Most of the women came from poor families and had no other opportunities for social or economic independence. The structural inequalities that pushed women into prostitution were often enforced by the colonial governments. Furthermore, the Cantonment Act of 1864 provided for the establishment and extension of hospitals in cantonments. Women working in chaklas were often required to undergo medical examinations once a week, in order to examine them for traces of venereal diseases. Prostitutes were often confined against their wills in these prison hospitals, especially if they were found to have a venereal disease. The Cantonment Act of 1864, originally meant for military bases, was eventually extended to the Presidencies and Provinces of British India. However, when military personnel were increasingly struck down by venereal diseases, more regulations were demanded. This eventually led to the Indian Contagious Disease Acts. The Contagious Disease Acts sought to prevent venereal diseases in military personnel through several regulations. The Acts required the registration of women engaged in prostitution. These women were often required to carry a license in the form of a card. Furthermore, it mandated the regular medical examination of female prostitutes. If any of these women were found to be infected during an examination, they were required to undergo in-patient treatment. If they refused such treatment, they could be penalized by imprisonment. Once cured of their diseases, they were released. None of these measures was applied to infected men. The Acts only targeted female prostitutes, as they were the only people subject to licensing and medical examinations. The Great Depression in the 1930s caused unprecedented unemployment and displacement in British Burma, forcing many women to serve clients, mainly British troops and Indian sepoys. According to some accounts, Burma had the largest thriving prostitution industry in British India because of the economic crisis. HIV/AIDS Burma has the second highest HIV prevalence rate in Asia, after Thailand. Sex workers are particularly at risk. The criminal nature of sex work in Burma, as it is prohibited by the 1949 Suppression of Prostitution Act, also contributes to the ineffectiveness of reaching out to sex workers in Myanmar with regard to HIV/AIDS awareness and condom usage. In 2005 in Yangon, there were over 100 brothels and up to 10,000 sex workers, mostly of the Bamar ethnic group, with between 70-90 percent having a history of sexually transmitted infections and less than 25 percent having been tested for HIV. An anecdotal study at that time found that nearly half of sex workers in Yangon had HIV/AIDS. Various campaigns have taken place by the government, NGO and international organisation to raise awareness of HIV, to give greater access to healthcare and improve treatment of those infected. As a result, the national adult prevalence rate has fallen to 0.4% The prevalence rate amongst sex workers has also fallen; 18.4% in 2008, 7.1% in 2012 and 5.4% in 2016. Condom use amongst sex worker has increased to over 80% Sex trafficking Myanmar is a source country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking, both in Myanmar and abroad. It is also increasingly a destination and transit country for foreign victims, including women and girls from India. Some Myanma women, and children who migrate for work abroad, particularly to Thailand and China, as well as other countries in Asia, the Middle East, and the United States, are subjected sex trafficking. Myanma women are increasingly transported to China and subjected to sex trafficking; Myanma government officials are occasionally complicit in this form of trafficking, as well as in the facilitation of the smuggling and exploitation of Rohingya migrants. Myanmar is a major source of prostitutes (an estimate of 25,000–30,000) in Thailand, with the majority of women trafficked taken to Ranong, bordering south Myanmar, and Mae Sai, at the eastern tip of Myanmar. Myanma sex workers also operate in Yunnan, China, particularly the border town of Ruili. The majority of Burmese prostitutes in Thailand are from ethnic minorities. Sixty percent of Burmese prostitutes are under 18 years of age. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Myanmar as a 'Tier 3' country.

His birth name was Sathyanarayana Raju. Sathya (as Sai Baba referred to himself in those days) \\"was known to be very lively,\\" and composed many plays, poems and songs for school and friends. He also taught the local children and villagers how to read and write. \\"He was called by the neighbors Brahmajnani, a \\"Realized Soul.\\"\\" In sixth standard, Sathya left Puttaparthi to live with his elder brother, Seshama and his wife in Kamalapuram. About a year later, \\"holidays came and Seshama Raju took Sathya to Hampi.\\" A municipal chairman witnessed Sathya being both inside a Siva temple and outside (looking after his brothers luggage) simultaneously. Afterwards, he presented the boy with \\"a collar pin made of gold.\\" During a discourse in 2000, Sathya Sai Baba related the events that transpired a few days after, \\"He (Sathya) left the house and went about ten feet when the collar pin fell and could not be found... The collar pin symbolised worldly attachment, and when it was lost, it was symbolic of the end of the ‘Raju phase’ and attachments implied by it. Declaring that He had no worldly relationship with anyone, he ran to the house of one Anjaneyulu... In front of his house there was a small rock. Swami (Sathya Sai Baba) went and sat on that stone.\\" Narayana Kasturi's biography states Sathya Sai Baba performed many miracles (healings, levitation, materialization of fruit, sweets, pencils, pictures etc. and clairvoyance). At approximately age 14, Sathya Sai Baba made a claim that he was the reincarnation of the fakir, Sai Baba of Shirdi. To validate his claim it is alleged that jasmine flowers were dropped onto the ground and that they miraculously arranged themselves into the words \\"Sai Baba\\" in Telugu.Schulman, Arnold (1971). Baba. Viking Press. pp. 122–124. . At that time, he began his spiritual mission. The first volume of Sathya Sai Speaks Sathya Sai Speaks volume 01 covers discourses given during the years 1953 to 1960. In this volume can be read the many early claims of divinity made by Sathya Sai Baba, including those of omnipotence and omniscience. During the month of June 1963, Sathya Sai Baba suffered a stroke and 4 heart attacks. His left side was paralysed, and the sight in his left eye and speech were badly affected. After sprinkling water on his left hand and leg, he made a full recovery and delivered a Guru Poornima discourse. During the discourse he said, \\"Shiva said that they (Shiva and Shakti) would take human form and be born in the Bharadwaja lineage, thrice: Shiva alone as Shirdi Sai Baba, Shiva and Shakthi together at Puttaparthi as Sathya Sai Baba, and Shakthi alone as Prema Sai, later.\\" In a 1976 interview he repeated his claim to be a full divine Avatar, saying \\"I have come armed with the fullness of the power of formless God to correct mankind, raise human consciousness and put people back on the right path of truth, righteousness, peace and love to divinity.\\" Between 1988 and 2006, Sathya Sai Baba suffered three accidents,http://www.sssbpt.info/ssspeaks/volume21/sss21-23.pdfDivine Discourse By Sai Baba - Sai Baba Of India the second of which left him with a fractured hip and a broken femur.5 July 2003, Doctors' Day Discourse He later moved among devotees in his car or Porte Chair.Sai Global Harmony - Prasanthi Bulletin It is claimed that he performed a number of miracles including: levitation (both indoors and outdoors), bilocation, physical disappearances, changing granite into sugar candy, changing water into another drink, changing water into gasoline, producing objects on demand, changing the color of his gown while wearing it, multiplying food, healing acute and chronic diseases, appearing in visions and dreams, making different fruits appear on any tree hanging from actual stems, controlling the weather, physically transforming into various deities and physically emitting brilliant light. Sathya Sai Baba gained followers in India from the 1930s.Kent, 71 Outside of India, he became popular from the 1960s and 1970s. During the period from 1970 to 1983, the number of Sathya Sai Baba centres in the United Kingdom grew from 2 to 51.Bowen, 51 Beliefs and practices of devotees Sathya Sai Baba gave discourses on religious topics to devotees in his native language Telugu.

Mother's words are always sweet.\\" Additionally, Sai Baba has repeatedly stated \\"Rama, Krishna, Shivaji and Gandhi became what they were because of their mothers.

Sathya Sai Baba's discourses are presented in the Sathya Sai Speaks series. Sathya Sai Baba recommends meditation (dhyan) for acquiring one-pointed attention on the Lord.http://www.sssbpt.info/vahinis/dhyana/dhyana02.pdf Having written a vahini on the subject of meditation (dhyan),http://www.sssbpt.info/vahinis/dhyana/dhyanafront.pdf Baba suggests four techniques: repetition of one's own favourite 'name of God'http://www.sssbpt.info/vahinis/dhyana/dhyana01.pdf (Rama, Sai, Allah, Aum etc. ...), http://www.sssbpt.info/ssspeaks/volume31/sss31-09.pdfhttp://www.sssbpt.info/summershowers/ss1979/ss1979-23.pdf visualizing the form of God (i.e. Guru, Buddha, Jesus, Sai Baba, etc. ...), sitting in silence,http://www.sssbpt.info/ssspeaks/volume05/sss05-41.pdf and jyoti (Flame/Light meditation).

He seeks Love, to give it and share it, for his nature is God and God is Love.Thought For the Day, 5 December 2009 Practices in the ashrams and the person of Sathya Sai Baba The popularity and the donations by followers enabled Sathya Sai Baba and his organizations to build an ever-increasing ashram called Prashanthi Nilayam near the once poor and isolated village of Puttaparthi. Entrance to Puttaparthi, with the old symbol of the Sathya Sai Organization above it An important practice in his ashram in Puttaparthi was the darshan (spiritual sight) that Sathya Sai Baba gave.Kent, 45 During darshan Sathya Sai Baba walked among his followers. He may have listened to a few chosen persons, accepted letters, or materialized and distributed vibhuti (sacred ash). He said that his darshan has spiritual benefits for those who attended it. Usually people waited hours to get a good place for darshan. Sathya Sai Baba sometimes invited people for a group interview with him in a room in the ashram 's mandir (Hindu temple). Followers considered it a great privilege to get such an interview. Sometimes a person from this group was invited for a private interview. Sathya Sai Baba's manifestations of vibuthi emphasized his claim to be a reincarnation of Shirdi Sai Baba who used to take ash, called udhi, from an ever-burning fire, called a dhuni.Bowen, 194Nagel, Alexandra De Sai Paradox: Tegenstrijdigheden van en rondom Sathya Sai Baba from the series Religieuze Bewegingen in Nederland, 'Sekten', 1994, nr. 29. published by the Free University of Amsterdam press . English translation:\\"Day and night he kept an ever-burning fire in a mosque, a so called dhuni. The ash from the dhuni served as sacrament (followers used it to make stripes on their forehead or swallowed it), sometimes it functioned as a medicine.\\" Dutch original: \\"Dag en nacht hield hij in de moskee een vuur brandend, een zgn. dhuni. Het as uit de dhuni diende als sacrament (volgelingen trokken er strepen mee op hun voorhoofd of slikten het in), soms werkte het als geneesmiddel.\\" Vibuthi is an ancient Hindu symbol, among others associated with Shiva.Bowen, 193, 194 Sathya Sai Baba resided much of the time in his main ashram Prashanthi Nilayam (\\"Abode of Highest Peace\\") at Puttaparthi. During the hot summer the guru left for his other ashram called Brindavan in Whitefield, India (sometimes called Kadugodi), a town on the outskirts of Bangalore. He has left India only once for a visit to Eastern Africa in 1968. He was a prolific orator in his native language of Telugu,Babb, 1986 pages 171 \\"Sathya Sai Baba was, among other things, a teacher. He taught how to achieve kaivalyam i.e.salvation. He was a frequent giver of discourses, now compiled in several volumes. He usually spoke in Telugu, and before a Hindi-speaking audience an interpreter was required. One of his most characteristic rhetorical devices is his ad hoc etymology. For example, he has stated that Hindu means \`one who is nonviolent' by the combination of hinsa (violence) and dur (distant).\\" and also spoke Tamil. He claimed to be the Kali Yuga purna Avatar (full divine incarnation of this era) of Lord Shiva and Shakti. He said that he is omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent and could create matter from mere thought.Interview given by Sathya Sai Baba to R. K. Karanjia of Blitz News Magazine in September 1976 Available onlineHummel, Reinhart Guru, Miracle Worker, Religious Founder: Sathya Sai Baba article in Update IX 3, September 1985, originally published in German in Materialdienst der EZW, 47 Jahrgang, 1 February 1984 \\"The answer to that question has been answered by Sai Baba himself: »I am the omnipresent, almighty, and omniscient.«\\" He also stressed he was free from desires, and that this was the state that one should aim to attain, consistent with the Vedic teachings. He played down his claims about being an incarnation of God by saying that everybody is God but that only he realizes and experiences this fully. In correspondence with his perceived divinity, followers often capitalize references to him in their writings (\\"He\\", \\"Him\\", etc.). Sathya Sai Baba prophesied that he would reincarnate again in the 21st century as Prema Sai Baba to finish the spiritual transformation of the world, starting with India, where his previous and current incarnations have begun.Taylor, pages 130-131 \\"In 1963 he announced that he was the second incarnation in a series of three. The first had occurred in the human form of the Shirdi Sai Baba who was the incarnation of Shiva. The second, himself, was the incarnation of Shiva- Shakti; and the third would be the incarnation of Shakti as someone called Prema Sai to be born in Mysore State eight years after his own death.\\" Sathya Sai Baba has stated that his three incarnations will help to usher in the Golden Age of mankind that will come soon.Steel, pages 206-207 He said he would die at the age of 96. After he died, some devotees suggested that he might have been referring to that many lunar years, rather than solar years,Mohammed Shafeeq. Post. Durban: 27 Apr 2011. pg. 4 and using the Indian way of accounting for age, which counts the year to come as part of the person's life.Sri Philip M. Prasad, Malayalam Daily. Kerala, India: 25 April 2011. \\"What Baba has foretold was indeed correct. According to the Roman calendar he has completed 85 years. But one can note that generally in all of Baba’s discourses Baba had been referring to the star (lunar) basis in calculations. In Indian astrology there are 27 stars in a month starting with Aswathy and ending with Revathy. Accordingly, a year of 12 months is composed of 324 days. Sai Baba was born on 23 November 1925. From that day till his death day 24 April 2011 there were a total of 33,899 days. If this is divided with 324, we get 95 years and 54 days. Accordingly, under the star basis of calculation he was in his 96th year having completed 54 days when he left his physical body.\\" Sathya Sai Baba has said that he performs miracles to attract people and then to transform them spiritually, telling his followers not to focus on his miracles. He could be seen in person to perform these miracles in the form of materializations of small objects, for example jewelry such as bracelets, rings, watches and especially vibhuti (holy ash).Kent, page ?? He said in a 1976 interview that these trinkets have symbolic value, and offer the owners protection by reminding them of his protecting powers when in danger.Interview given by Sathya Sai Baba to R.K. Karanjia of Blitz News Magazine in September 1976 Occasionally, at Maha Shivaratri, he publicly produced lingams that came out of his mouth that devotees claim materialize in his body.Bowen, 188 He said that he can heal the diseases of his devotees by either his spiritual power or by taking on the disease himself. There is anecdotal evidence that supports this claim. Babb wrote in a 1983 article that \\"the miraculous are absolutely central to this religious movement\\" and that the plausibility of these miracles \\"seems to pull people into convictions ostensibly at odds with what their own subculture deems to be common sense and considered judgment\\". He wrote in that article that his observations are based on his contact with the local following of Sathya Sai Baba in Delhi that according to Babb included a sophisticated and cosmopolitan elite. Babb further wrote in that article that the energy of Sathya Sai Baba’s \\"magic\\" can have \\"life-transforming effects on devotees.\\"Babb, Lawrence A. Sathya Sai Baba's Magic in Anthropological Quarterly, Vol. 56, No. 3 (Jul., 1983), pp. 116-124 Sathya Sai Baba has said that all of his acts have meaning and significance. So many followers interpret the acts and sayings of the guru as teachings, sometimes even as personal teachings. Some followers, especially in the ashram, attribute coincidences to Baba’s will and try to find a sometimes hidden meaning in them. Babb wrote in a 1986 book that some devotees tend attribute every event to Sathya Sai Baba's will and tend to see the world as an enchanted garden.Babb 1986, pages 198-199 \\"[..]for Sathya Sai Baba's followers everything that occurs does so by his ordainment. They speak of this constantly, even in connection with what may seem to be the most trivial events; nothing happens that he does not will....Their world is something like an enchanted garden. This is a point on which it is difficult to be ethnographically precise, but it is real enough. It emerges mainly in the tone ... An informant reported an altercation with someone while staying at Baba's ashram; immediately upon leaving the room his eye lighted on a sign with some slogan about the evils of anger. Another informant reports longing for a guava, having seen a few unimpressive specimens for sale while on a motor trip. When her car halted, a man suddenly appeared by its side with two plump and juicy ones, which he sold her for eight annas. This, of course, was Baba himself. Another informant tells of how she was frightened by the dark clouds surrounding an aircraft in which she was descending for a landing at Nagpur. But then, just as the thought of Baba flashed through her mind, the plane passed through a momentary shaft of sunlight.\\" He says that when a person dreams about him then this is because of his will and this is a form of his communication with people. Followers report dreams that contain messages from the guru to them. Some people became devotees after having such a dream.Babb, Lawrence. Sathya Sai Baba's Magic in Anthropological Quarterly, 1983 \\"It is believed, indeed, that he appears in dreams only when he wills it; thus, every dream of him is a kind of miraculous communication.\\"Babb, Lawrence Redemptive Encounters page 179 \\"frequently appears in devotee's dreams, and because he is believed to appear in dreams only when he wills it, every dream of him is a kind of miraculous communication\\"Kasturi, Narayana Sathyam Shivam Sundaram: The Life of Bhagavan Sri Sathya Sai Baba Volume III available online \\"Appearing to devotees in dreams, Baba has taught them new Bhajan songs, sitting in front of them as music teachers do, with instructions to sing them during the Dasara festival at Puttaparthi. Later, when they arrived at Puttaparthi they were prompted by him to sing them! A devotee was once so involved in civil suits at court that he was nearly bankrupt. Appearing to him while he was asleep Baba told him plainly, \\"Properties, my dear fellow, are not proper ties!\\" Baba as an educator and as the incarnation that has come in order to educate, is engaged in that task, all over the world at all times.\\" Teachings The Sathya Sai Baba movement advocates the unity of all religions. Sathya Sai Baba says that all religions lead to God and that followers should continue to follow their original religions. He says that those who follow his teachings will find themselves exampling their own original faith more fully, i.e. that will make Christians become better Christians and Hindus better Hindus, et cetera. The five basic human values that he advocates are: Truth (Satya), Right Conduct (Dharma), Peace (Shanti), Love for God and all creatures (Prema), and Non-violence (Ahimsa). He teaches a rather traditional but eclectic form of Hinduism that come from many sects and movements including advaita, occasionally drawing from other religions like Buddhism, Sikhism, and Christianity. He says that he has come to restore faith in, and the practice of, the Vedas. He says that a very important way a person can emancipate oneself is through self-less service to one's fellow man (seva). Sathya Sai Baba has repeatedly stressed the importance of sadhana (Hindu spiritual exercises) for example by meditation.Steel, 125-128 He asserts that sadhana is important for achieving moksha or kaivalyam (liberation from ignorance and from the endless re-births due to karmic consequences). Sathya Sai Baba teaches the importance of Bhakti yoga (Hindu devotion to God). He preaches a strict morality with regards to sensual desires (including food, sex, meat, alcohol). Some of his exhortations are to put a ceiling on desires. By this, he seems to mean that followers should not waste time and money. He teaches that the world is just maya , that only God is real and that the seeming diversity of all life is another illusion. All life is one, he says. The meaning of life is to experience this oneness with God and other living beings. Followers attribute many miracles to him which they witness in his presence and in their own countries, like spontaneous vibhuti manifestations on the pictures of the guru in their homes, and bilocation, the appearance of Sai Baba in their own presence while he is also in another place. They also report that he has materialized out-of-season fruit several times. He says he performs these miracles to attract people and then to transform them spiritually. Sathya Sai Baba said that he does not speak through other people in a discourse in 1962.Sathya Sai Baba on 4 March 1962 Spend your Days with Shiva (also copied in the book by Samuel Sandweis Sai Baba The Holy Man ... and the Psychiatrist chapter 17) \\"There are again some others who are swept off their feet by hysterical demonstrations by certain weak-minded individuals, which are described as My speaking through them or acting through them! Take it from Me, I am not given to such absurdities! I do not use others as My media; I have no need to. I do not swing from side to side and prattle! Why, even those who torture their bodies and suffer the pains of asceticism for years, until anthills overwhelm them and they become as stiff as tree-stumps, find it difficult to realise the Lord. How then can these idlers, who eat their fill and wander about as slaves of their senses, earn that status so cheap? Their gestures, words and actions are hollow and vain; those who burn incense before them and revere them are turning away from Me and running after falsehood.\\" In spite of this, the British author Lucas Ralli claimed that he received messages from Sathya Sai Baba and wrote in his books that his claim was endorsed by Sathya Sai Baba in an interview. His books with messages from Sathya Sai Baba are sold by the Sathya Sai Book Center of America. website of the American book center retrieved March 2006 \\"Sai Messages for You and Me, Vol. 1, by Lucas Ralli.\\" The anthropologist Lawrence Babb wrote that he considered the teachings of secondary importance in the cult when compared to the emphasis on the miraculous. Babb further wrote about the Sai doctrine that \\"[...] there is little relatively to dwell upon, or at least nothing very distinctive. His philosophical views are simplistic, eclectic, and essentially unoriginal.\\" The anthropologist Alexandra Kent notes that this lack of originality is in correspondence with Sathya Sai Baba's claim to revive old truths.Kent (2005), page 57 The main objective of the Sathya Sai Organization, as Sathya Sai Baba himself says, \\"is to help you recognize the divinity inherent in you. So, your duty is to emphasize the One, to experience the One in all you do or speak. Do not give importance to differences of religion, sect, status, or color. Have the feeling of one-ness permeate all your acts. Only those who do so have a place in this Organization; the rest can withdraw.\\"Sri Sathya Sai Baba Organization in Canada - Home Page Activities in local Sathya Sai Baba groups Globally, local Sathya Sai Baba groups assemble to sing bhajans (devotional songs). Baba says that concentration on the name of God with the help of bhajans will easily lead to concentration on God and to higher devotion. Bhajans are sung at nearly every meeting. Bhajans are simple verses.Kent, 48 One line is sung by a lead singer and is then repeated by the rest of the group. In those bhajans the name of traditional Hindu deities have sometimes been replaced by the names of Sathya Sai Baba.Patel, Niranjan, Madhu Patel, Claire S. Scott, Ajay N.

As of 2007, the chairman of the organization is the American Michael Goldstein. The logo of the Sathya Sai organization is a stylized lotus flower with the text of the five human values written in each petal. These are Love, Truth, Peace, Righteousness and Non-violence. This text version has replaced the old logo with the symbols of the main 5 or 6 world religions in the petals.

Het enig echt herkenbare wat hij van Shirdi Baba nog heeft, is het veelvuldig gebruik van as, – wat hij dan niet uit een dhuni haalt zoals Shirdi Baba deed, maar materialiseert (of tevoorschijn goochelt)\\" Sai Baba's followers considered him to be the avatar of Shiva and Kalki, while he himself claimed to be a reincarnation of Sai Baba of Shirdhi. Charles S. J. White, of The American University at Washington D.C., said, \\"Apart from his name, there is no discernible Muslim influence in the Sathya Sai Baba cult.\\" He said that Sai Baba's style is mostly similar to Medieval Hindu practice called nathpanthis. Lawrence A. Babb, of the Amherst College in Massachusetts, also labelled Sai Baba movement as a cult, which is \\"deeply and authentically Hindu.\\" He states that the devotees \\"rarely dwell on matters of doctrine, which is not surprising, for in fact there is relatively little to dwell upon, or at least nothing very distinctive. His philosophical views are simplistic, eclectic, and essentially unorigin... The most striking feature of this cult, however, is the extremely strong emphasis given to the miraculous.\\" Babb sees as its highly individualized focus on miracles instead of a focus on a world view.Handoo, Jawaharlal in Asian Folklore Studies, Vol. 48, No. 2 (1989), pp. 326-32 reviewing Lawrence A. Babb's book Redemptive Encounters. Three Modern Styles in the Hindu Tradition page 1 Deborah A. Swallow, of the University of Cambridge, also agreed to the cult description. She compared Sathya Sai Baba with his (alleged) predecessor Sai Baba of Shirdi, who was associated with both Hindu and Islam. She concluded that Sathya Sai Baba's connection to Islam was vague, and that his \\"ritual and theology, then, unlike Sai Baba [of Shirdi]'s, is distinctly Hindu in form and content.\\" The wide range of devotees including Muslims, Sikhs, Parsees, Jews and Christians is \\"the composite symbol of his cult.\\" According to Alexandra Kent, at the Gothenburg University in Sweden, Sai Baba movement \\"differs from the other movements in its concerted efforts to transcend ethnic and religious divisions\\" in order to promote universal religion. But at its core it teaches \\"the eternal Hindu truth.\\" She called it the \\"Hindu Revitalization movement.\\" This is essential for Indian people living in different countries to maintain their inherently Hindu culture. Knott tagged in a table the \\"Sathya Sai Baba Fellowship\\" as devotional, charismatic authority, reformist, and including non-Asian membership. Untagged were revivalist, missionary, and caste-related. Kelly wrote that the Sathya Sai Organizations reject the label Hindu although they were clearly Hindu mission. According to Kelly, they saw its founder as the \\"living synthesis of the world's religious traditions\\" and prefers to be classified as an interfaith movement. He noted that \\"They instruct their children to fill out methodically the prayer, school, and chore daily schedules that rival the ones devised by Benjamin Franklin, the ones that so impressed Max Webber.\\" Kelly further wrote when comparing ISKCON with the Sai Baba mission (he does not write which Sai Baba mission he means) that the Sai Baba efforts in Fiji are ambiguous where ISKCON is dogmatic and structured, proliferating where ISKCON is planned and controlled, self-contradictory where ISKCON is clear, gentle where ISKCON is stern, and to put it most broadly, open where ISKCON is closed. Kelly further stated that the Sai organization in Fiji does not ask its members to undergo initiation or to commit themselves to obey particular leaders.Kelly, page 45 Former followers Nagel asserts that the atmosphere surrounding Sathya Sai Baba is clearly Hindu, in spite of Sathya Sai Baba's claim to foster and unite a number of different religions and that he dropped all Muslim elements that Shirdi Sai Baba practiced.Nagel, Alexandra (note: Nagel is a critical former follower) \\"De Sai Paradox: Tegenstrijdigheden van en rondom Sathya Sai Baba\\"/\\"The Sai Paradox contradictions of and surrounding Sathya Sai Baba\\" from the magazine \\"Religieuze Bewegingen in Nederland, 'Sekten' \\"/\\"Religious movements in the Netherlands, 'Cults/Sects' \\", 1994, nr. 29. published by the Free University of Amsterdam press, (1994) Dutch original: \\"Ofschoon Sai Baba gezegd heeft mensen van allerlei religieuze gezindten te helpen terug te gaan naar oude waarden en normen, en ofschoon zijn logo de symbolen van de andere grote godsdiensten bevat, is de sfeer rondom Sai Baba duidelijk hindoeïstisch gekleurd.

History 28th Air Division ADC AOR 1949–1960 Established in December 1949, the Air Defense Command 28th Air Division \\"assumed responsibility for conducting the air defense of an area that embraced California, Utah, Nevada, Colorado, and Arizona. It became part of the Western Air Defense Force in 1950. With no fighter interceptor squadrons directly assigned, the division used interceptors of the 78th Fighter Wing, based at Hamilton Air Force Base, California, as well as Air National Guard interceptors based within its geographical area.\\" \\"By November 1954 its geographical boundaries included northern California, southern Oregon, and parts of Nevada and Utah. The division participated frequently in air defense exercises with U.S. Army artillery, U.S. Navy interceptors, and Strategic Air Command bombers.\\" \\"On 15 February 1959, it added the San Francisco Air Defense Sector to its components, and the geographical area expanded to include California and Arizona, and parts of Oregon, Idaho, Nevada, and New Mexico.\\" \\"The division gained the Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Reno Air Defense Sectors and also the 552d Airborne Early Warning and Control Wing, whose Lockheed C-121 Constellation AWACS aircraft augmented naval picket ships in providing radar coverage seaward from the west coast of the United States. During 1961, it transitioned to a Semi Automatic Ground Environment system in all four of its sectors. Reorganization in 1963 altered the 28th's boundaries to include the states of Nevada, Arizona, Utah, and parts of California, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico.\\" 28th Air Division ADC AOR 1960–1969 \\"On 1 April 1966, the 28th was reassigned, in name only, to Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana, and replaced the Great Falls Air Defense Sector.

Became part of ADTAC on 1 October 1979 with the inactivation of ADC and the incorporation of the CONUS air defense mission into Tactical Air Command. Beginning in April 1985, the 28th provided theater and Air Force commands with airborne forces for surveillance, warning, command and control, communications, and electronic combat operations. It was the Tactical Air Command single manager for the E-3 Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS), EC-130H Compass Call, EC-130E Airborne Battlefield Command and Control Center (ABCCC), and EC-135K Tactical Deployment Control Squadron (TDCS) in support of unified and specified commands.

Early years Doleib Hill was established during the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan condominium period, in the early part of the 20th century, and developed into an important educational and religious center among the Shilluk people of the region. The Reverend J. Alfred Heasty lived at Doleib Hill from 1921 and became an expert on the local Shulla people and their language. The Shilluk (Shulla) were primarily herdsmen rather than farmers, measuring their wealth and social standing in cattle. They felt it was wrong to kill a cow, but would eat one that had died. The Shulla also hunted and fished and foraged for wild edible plants. Civil wars During the First Sudanese Civil War (1955-1972) the school was forcibly closed by government forces. The Government of Sudan targeted the Christianized-Westernized educated elite, treating them as rebels. In July 1965 the headmaster of the girls' schools at Doleib Hill was one of the first to be tortured and then killed. The school was reopened after the Addis Ababa peace accord of 1972. The school was subsequently forced to close for a second time after the outbreak of the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983-2005). The school buildings were occupied as a Sudanese government garrison in 1983. In late 1986 and early 1987 rebel Anyanya-2 forces attacked Shilluk villages near Doleib Hill and Taufikia several times. Possibly as many as 600 civilians were killed. In 1991 the Lou Nuer Anyanya-2 militia was based near Doleib Hill under Yohannes Yual when it declared for Riek Machar's breakaway SPLA-Nasir. In 1995 Riek Machar granted an amnesty to Commander Gordon Kong Banypiny, who had been convicted for using his troops in an ethnically motivated attack on Nasir, held by a different section of Nuer within the SSIA command. After trying to raise support in the Waat region, Gordon Kong fled to Doleib Hill, which was held by a government militia commanded by Mabur Dhol, a former Anyana soldier. He went on from there to Malakak where he obtained arms from the government. Since 2011 Doleib Hill has been in the northern region of the new country of South Sudan, in the Upper Nile state.

Life and career Bechi studied in his native Florence with Raul Frazzi and di Giorgio, and made his debut at Empoli, in 1936, as Germont in La traviata. He sang widely in Italy, appearing frequently at the Rome Opera from 1938 to 1952, and at La Scala from 1939 to 1953, where he sang the title role in Nabucco for its reopening in 1946. He quickly established himself as the leading dramatic baritone of his time, in roles such as Rigoletto, Count de Luna, Renato, Carlo, Amonasro, Alfio, Gérard, but was also admired as Figaro and Hamlet. Bechi sang relatively little outside Italy, but did appear in England and North and South America in the late 1950s, but by then he was past his best. In his prime, Bechi possessed a dark and incisive voice and was a fine singing actor. He can be heard in a number of early recordings, opposite Beniamino Gigli, such as Un ballo in maschera, Aida, Andrea Chénier, and Cavalleria rusticana, conducted by Pietro Mascagni himself. He also recorded Il barbiere di Siviglia. Also available is an unauthorized recording of Nabucco, with Maria Callas, from 1949, and the Prologue from Pagliacci. Bechi retired from the stage in 1965, and taught in Siena. He died in Florence in 1993.

Directed by James Wan, the film stars Kevin Bacon as Nick Hume, a man who takes the law into his own hands after his son is murdered by a gang as an initiation ritual. Hume must protect his family from the gang's resulting vengeance. The film premiered on August 31, 2007, and was released on DVD on January 8, 2008. Plot Nick Hume is a businessman living in Columbia, South Carolina with his family. He goes to watch his son, Brendan's hockey game. While Nick and Brendan are driving home, they talk about the latter's potential future as a professional hockey player. They stop at a gas station in a bad part of town and during an apparent robbery of the gas station, Joe Darley, a new gang member, slices Brendan's throat with a machete. Nick ambushes the thugs, pulls off Joe's mask and sees his face, but Joe escapes, only to get hit by a car. Nick rushes Brendan to the hospital, but Brendan dies. Nick identifies Joe in a line-up, but while meeting with the district attorney, he becomes angry when the DA presents a case that the defense will cut a deal for three to five years of jail time. The DA explains that Nick is the only witness, there were no surveillance cameras, and the defense could gain sympathy for Darley. At a pre-trial hearing, Nick recants his identification so Joe will go free. He follows the gang to their hideout, returning later and stabbing Joe while he is alone. The gang leader, Billy, wants revenge. One of the gang members says his sister saw a man in a suit on the night when Joe was killed. Confirming it was Nick from a newspaper picture, they ambush him on the street. After chasing him, they stop at the top of a multi-story parking garage, where Nick gets into a fight with one of the gang members, trapping him in a car and sending him over the edge of the lot. Another of the gang members arrives at the office where Nick works to deliver his suitcase that he dropped during the chase. Nick calls a phone number found in the case, which belongs to Billy. Billy warns that Nick has bought a \\"death sentence\\" for his family, and reveals that Joe Darley was his brother. Nick immediately calls the police detective assigned to Brendan's case, Jessica Wallis, who is already aware of what Nick started. She grants Nick's family police protection, and issues APBs on Billy and his gang. That night, the officers at Nick's house are stealthily killed, but by the time Nick realizes, he finds the gang members are in the house. They attack and subdue Nick, then drag Helen and Lucas downstairs to shoot them and Helen dies. After Detective Wallis gives a speech that wars are never settled, she lets Nick pay a visit to a comatose Lucas, where he apologizes for not being a better father. Nick escapes from the hospital to go after the remaining gang members, obtaining guns from a black market gun dealer Bones, who, at the conclusion of their transaction reveals himself to Nick as Billy's father. Nick tracks down Heco, a member of the gang, and interrogates him about where the other members are, learning their lair is an abandoned mental hospital that they call \\"The Office\\". He forces Heco at gunpoint to call Billy's cell phone, and executes Heco while Billy is listening. Bones confronts Billy and criticizes him, but Billy kills him. Nick heads to \\"The Office\\" to kill the remainder of the gang. After a shootout, he and Billy encounter and seriously wound each other in the hospital chapel. Sitting on the same pew, Billy claims that he turned Nick into a vicious cold- blooded killer, just like him. Nick pulls out his revolver and asks Billy if he's ready to meet his maker, as Billy sheds a tear for his doomed fate before Nick ends his life. With his family now avenged, Nick returns home, watches his own family's movies and awaits his inevitable arrest. When she arrives, Detective Wallis informs him that Lucas has improved and will now live. Nick becomes relieved and sees his family happily singing on the couch. = Alternative ending = In the extended version of the film, Nick succumbs to his injuries.

Reception Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 21% of 112 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 4.1 out of 10. The critical consensus states: \\"A nonsensical plot and an absurd amount of violence make this revenge pic gratuitous and overwrought.\\" The film has a score of 36 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 24 critics, indicating \\"Generally unfavorable reviews\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film stars out of 4. He compared Death Sentence to the Death Wish films starring Charles Bronson, saying: \\"In the Bronson movies, the hero just looked more and more determined until you felt if you tapped his face, it would explode. In Death Sentence, Bacon acts out a lot more.\\" Ebert called Death Sentence \\"very efficient\\", praising \\"a courtroom scene of true surprise and suspense, and some other effective moments\\", but concluded that \\"basically this is a movie about a lot of people shooting at each other\\". Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club contends the film is \\"certainly never boring\\"; he felt that director James Wan was \\"too busy jamming the accelerator to realize that his movie's spinning out of control.\\"Death Sentence – Film Scott Tobias, The A.V. Club, August 30, 2007 Matt Zoller Seitz of The New York Times said, \\"Aside from a stunning three-minute tracking shot as the gang pursues Nick through a parking garage, and Mr. Bacon's hauntingly pale, dark-eyed visage, Mr. Wan's film is a tedious, pandering time-waster.\\"Movie Review – Death Sentence Matt Zoller Seitz, The New York Times, August 30, 2007 Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly felt that \\"[t]he morality of revenge is barely at issue in a movie that pushes the plausibility of revenge right over a cliff.\\"Death Sentence – Movie Review Owen Gleiberman, Entertainment Weekly, September 5, 2007 Conversely, Justin Chang of Variety called the film \\"well- made, often intensely gripping\\".Death Sentence Review Justin Chang, Variety, August 30, 2007 Similarly, Bill Gibron of PopMatters felt the film was \\"a significant movie\\" and \\"a wonderfully tight little thriller\\".Short Cuts – In Theaters: Death Sentence (2007) – Short Ends and Leader Bill Gibron, PopMatters, 2007 Darren Amner of Eye for Film also gave the film a positive review, praising Bacon's performance in particular: \\"[H]is portrayal is emotional, sympathetic and highly aggressive. As a father he is touching and as a stone-cold killing machine he is even more convincing.\\"Death Sentence Movie Review (2007) Darren Amner, Eye for Film, 2007 Author Brian Garfield, who wrote the novel the film is loosely based on, said of the film: \\"While I could have done with a bit less blood-and-thunder, I think it's a stunningly good movie. In the details of its story it's quite different from the novel, but it's a movie, not a novel. In its cinematic way it connects with its audience and it makes the same point the book makes, and those are the things that count.\\" He also liked that, like his novels, but unlike the Death Wish film series, it does not advocate vigilantism.Briangarfield.net Retrieved 2007-09-14 Garfield further explained in an interview: \\"I think that, except for its ludicrous violence toward the end, the Death Sentence movie does depict its character's decline and the stupidity of vengeful vigilantism,\\" adding, \\"As a story it made the point I wanted it to make.\\"Historian: Interview with Brian Garfield Nikki Tranter, PopMatters, March 5, 2008 References External links   * Category:2007 films Category:2007 action thriller films Category:2007 crime thriller films Category:2007 crime drama films Category:2000s gang films Category:2007 thriller drama films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:2000s action drama films Category:American films Category:American crime drama films Category:American action thriller films Category:American gang films Category:American thriller drama films Category:Films scored by Charlie Clouser Category:Films about murderers Category:Films about dysfunctional families Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films based on crime novels Category:Films directed by James Wan Category:American neo-noir films Category:American vigilante films Category:American films about revenge Category:Films based on works by Brian Garfield Category:Death Wish (film series) Category:2000s vigilante films Category:2007 drama films ","title":"Death Sentence (2007 film)"},{"id":"8867688","text":"The 29th Air Division (29th AD) is an inactive United States Air Force organization.

Arturo Frei studied at the Colegio de los Sagrados Corazones in Concepción and Santiago. Later he studied law at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, graduating as a lawyer. As a student, he joined the Christian Democrat Party in 1957. Frei married María Beatriz Ruitort Barrenechea, and they have a son: Arturo Eduardo. For a few years he was assistant professor of tax law, while also working as a lawyer at the Minister of Finance. At the same time he was in participated of the 1964 election that was won by his uncle. After the 1973 Chilean coup d'état, he retired from politics and dedicated himself to private practice, and also to running the Irene Frei Montalva foundation, which provided free daycare for children of poor families. In 1969, he was elected deputy for Concepción, being reelected in 1973, with one of the highest majorities at the national level. After the return of the democracy, Frei was elected senator in 1989 and served as chairman of the Armed Forces Committee where he developed strong links with the military. After Pinochet's arrest, Frei visited the general in London and his independent presidential campaign to succeed his cousin Eduardo Frei Ruiz- Tagle was seen as a maneuver by the general to prevent Ricardo Lagos from winning the election. The Progressive Union of the Centrist Center presented Frei as their candidate for the 1999 presidential elections, where Frei fared disastrously, gaining only 0.35% of the vote, the lowest percentage of any candidate since the end of the military régime.

Mars as seen by the Hubble Space Telescope The geology of Mars is the scientific study of the surface, crust, and interior of the planet Mars. It emphasizes the composition, structure, history, and physical processes that shape the planet. It is analogous to the field of terrestrial geology. In planetary science, the term geology is used in its broadest sense to mean the study of the solid parts of planets and moons. The term incorporates aspects of geophysics, geochemistry, mineralogy, geodesy, and cartography. A neologism, areology, from the Greek word Arēs (Mars), sometimes appears as a synonym for Mars's geology in the popular media and works of science fiction (e.g. Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy). Geological map of Mars (2014) File:Geologic Map of Mars figure2.pdfFigure 2 for the geologic map of Mars Global Martian topography and large-scale features  Composition of Mars  Mars is a differentiated, terrestrial planet. The InSight lander mission is designed to study the deep interior of Mars. The mission landed on 26 November 2018, and will deploy a sensitive seismometer that will enable 3D structure maps of the deep interior.  Global physiography  Most of our current knowledge about the geology of Mars comes from studying landforms and relief features (terrain) seen in images taken by orbiting spacecraft. Mars has a number of distinct, large- scale surface features that indicate the types of geological processes that have operated on the planet over time. This section introduces several of the larger physiographic regions of Mars. Together, these regions illustrate how geologic processes involving volcanism, tectonism, water, ice, and impacts have shaped the planet on a global scale. = Hemispheric dichotomy = Mars Orbital Laser Altimeter (MOLA) colorized shaded-relief maps showing elevations in the western and eastern hemispheres of Mars. (Left): The western hemisphere is dominated by the Tharsis region (red and brown). Tall volcanoes appear white. Valles Marineris (blue) is the long gash-like feature to the right. (Right): Eastern hemisphere shows the cratered highlands (yellow to red) with the Hellas basin (deep blue/purple) at lower left. The Elysium province is at the upper right edge. Areas north of the dichotomy boundary appear as shades of blue on both maps. The northern and southern hemispheres of Mars are strikingly different from each other in topography and physiography. This dichotomy is a fundamental global geologic feature of the planet. Simply stated, the northern part of the planet is an enormous topographic depression. About one-third of the planet's surface (mostly in the northern hemisphere) lies 3–6 km lower in elevation than the southern two-thirds. This is a first- order relief feature on par with the elevation difference between Earth's continents and ocean basins. The dichotomy is also expressed in two other ways: as a difference in impact crater density and crustal thickness between the two hemispheres. The hemisphere south of the dichotomy boundary (often called the southern highlands or uplands) is very heavily cratered and ancient, characterized by rugged surfaces that date back to the period of heavy bombardment. In contrast, the lowlands north of the dichotomy boundary have few large craters, are very smooth and flat, and have other features indicating that extensive resurfacing has occurred since the southern highlands formed. The third distinction between the two hemispheres is in crustal thickness. Topographic and geophysical gravity data indicate that the crust in the southern highlands has a maximum thickness of about , whereas crust in the northern lowlands \\"peaks\\" at around in thickness. The location of the dichotomy boundary varies in latitude across Mars and depends on which of the three physical expressions of the dichotomy is being considered. The origin and age of the hemispheric dichotomy are still debated. Hypotheses of origin generally fall into two categories: one, the dichotomy was produced by a mega-impact event or several large impacts early in the planet's history (exogenic theories) or two, the dichotomy was produced by crustal thinning in the northern hemisphere by mantle convection, overturning, or other chemical and thermal processes in the planet's interior (endogenic theories). One endogenic model proposes an early episode of plate tectonics producing a thinner crust in the north, similar to what is occurring at spreading plate boundaries on Earth. Whatever its origin, the Martian dichotomy appears to be extremely old. A new theory based on the Southern Polar Giant Impact and validated by the discovery of twelve hemispherical alignments shows that exogenic theories appear to be stronger than endogenic theories and that Mars never had plate tectonics that could modify the dichotomy. Laser altimeter and radar sounding data from orbiting spacecraft have identified a large number of basin-sized structures previously hidden in visual images. Called quasi- circular depressions (QCDs), these features likely represent derelict impact craters from the period of heavy bombardment that are now covered by a veneer of younger deposits. Crater counting studies of QCDs suggest that the underlying surface in the northern hemisphere is at least as old as the oldest exposed crust in the southern highlands. The ancient age of the dichotomy places a significant constraint on theories of its origin. = Tharsis and Elysium volcanic provinces = Straddling the dichotomy boundary in Mars's western hemisphere is a massive volcano-tectonic province known as the Tharsis region or the Tharsis bulge. This immense, elevated structure is thousands of kilometers in diameter and covers up to 25% of the planet's surface. Averaging 7–10 km above datum (Martian \\"sea\\" level), Tharsis contains the highest elevations on the planet and the largest known volcanoes in the Solar System. Three enormous volcanoes, Ascraeus Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Arsia Mons (collectively known as the Tharsis Montes), sit aligned NE-SW along the crest of the bulge. The vast Alba Mons (formerly Alba Patera) occupies the northern part of the region. The huge shield volcano Olympus Mons lies off the main bulge, at the western edge of the province. The extreme massiveness of Tharsis has placed tremendous stresses on the planet's lithosphere. As a result, immense extensional fractures (grabens and rift valleys) radiate outward from Tharsis, extending halfway around the planet.Carr, M.H (2007). Mars: Surface and Interior in Encyclopedia of the Solar System, 2nd ed., McFadden, L.-A. et al. Eds. Elsevier: San Diego, CA, p.319 A smaller volcanic center lies several thousand kilometers west of Tharsis in Elysium. The Elysium volcanic complex is about 2,000 kilometers in diameter and consists of three main volcanoes, Elysium Mons, Hecates Tholus, and Albor Tholus. The Elysium group of volcanoes is thought to be somewhat different from the Tharsis Montes, in that development of the former involved both lavas and pyroclastics. = Large impact basins = Several enormous, circular impact basins are present on Mars. The largest one that is readily visible is the Hellas basin located in the southern hemisphere. It is the second largest confirmed impact structure on the planet, centered at about 64°E longitude and 40°S latitude. The central part of the basin (Hellas Planitia) is 1,800 km in diameterBoyce, J.M. (2008) The Smithsonian Book of Mars; Konecky&Konecky;: Old Saybrook, CT, p. 13. and surrounded by a broad, heavily eroded annular rim structure characterized by closely spaced rugged irregular mountains (massifs), which probably represent uplifted, jostled blocks of old pre-basin crust.Carr, M.H.; Saunders, R.S.; Strom R.G. (1984). Geology of the Terrestrial Planets; NASA Scientific and Technical Information Branch: Washington DC, 1984, p. 223. http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/books/geologyTerraPlanets/ (See Anseris Mons, for example.) Ancient, low-relief volcanic constructs (highland paterae) are located on the northeastern and southwestern portions of the rim. The basin floor contains thick, structurally complex sedimentary deposits that have a long geologic history of deposition, erosion, and internal deformation. The lowest elevations on the planet are located within the Hellas basin, with some areas of the basin floor lying over 8 km below datum. The two other large impact structures on the planet are the Argyre and Isidis basins. Like Hellas, Argyre (800 km in diameter) is located in the southern highlands and is surrounded by a broad ring of mountains. The mountains in the southern portion of the rim, Charitum Montes, may have been eroded by valley glaciers and ice sheets at some point in Mars's history. The Isidis basin (roughly 1,000 km in diameter) lies on the dichotomy boundary at about 87°E longitude. The northeastern portion of the basin rim has been eroded and is now buried by northern plains deposits, giving the basin a semicircular outline. The northwestern rim of the basin is characterized by arcuate grabens (Nili Fossae) that are circumferential to the basin. One additional large basin, Utopia, is completely buried by northern plains deposits. Its outline is clearly discernable only from altimetry data. All of the large basins on Mars are extremely old, dating back to the late heavy bombardment. They are thought to be comparable in age to the Imbrium and Orientale basins on the Moon. = Equatorial canyon system = Viking Orbiter 1 view image of Valles Marineris. Near the equator in the western hemisphere lies an immense system of deep, interconnected canyons and troughs collectively known as the Valles Marineris. The canyon system extends eastward from Tharsis for a length of over 4,000 km, nearly a quarter of the planet's circumference. If placed on Earth, Valles Marineris would span the width of North America.Kargel, J.S. (2004) Mars: A Warmer Wetter Planet; Springer-Praxis: London, p. 52. In places, the canyons are up to 300 km wide and 10 km deep. Often compared to Earth's Grand Canyon, the Valles Marineris has a very different origin than its tinier, so-called counterpart on Earth. The Grand Canyon is largely a product of water erosion. The Martian equatorial canyons were of tectonic origin, i.e. they were formed mostly by faulting. They could be similar to the East African Rift valleys. The canyons represent the surface expression of powerful extensional strain in the Martian crust, probably due to loading from the Tharsis bulge. = Chaotic terrain and outflow channels = The terrain at the eastern end of the Valles Marineris grades into dense jumbles of low rounded hills that seem to have formed by the collapse of upland surfaces to form broad, rubble-filled hollows. Called chaotic terrain, these areas mark the heads of huge outflow channels that emerge full size from the chaotic terrain and empty (debouch) northward into Chryse Planitia. The presence of streamlined islands and other geomorphic features indicate that the channels were most likely formed by catastrophic releases of water from aquifers or the melting of subsurface ice. However, these features could also be formed by abundant volcanic lava flows coming from Tharsis. The channels, which include Ares, Shalbatana, Simud, and Tiu Valles, are enormous by terrestrial standards, and the flows that formed them correspondingly immense. For example, the peak discharge required to carve the 28-km-wide Ares Vallis is estimated to have been 14 million cubic metres (500 million cu ft) per second, over ten thousand times the average discharge of the Mississippi River. Mars Orbital Laser Altimeter (MOLA) derived image of Planum Boreum. Vertical exaggeration is extreme. Note that residual ice cap is only the thin veneer (shown in white) on top of the plateau. = Ice caps = The polar ice caps are well-known telescopic features of Mars, first identified by Christiaan Huygens in 1672.Sheehan, W. (1996). The Planet Mars: A History of Observation & Discovery; University of Arizona Press: Tucson, p. 25. http://www.uapress.arizona.edu/onlinebks/mars/contents.htm. Since the 1960s, we have known that the seasonal caps (those seen in the telescope to grow and wane seasonally) are composed of carbon dioxide (CO2) ice that condenses out of the atmosphere as temperatures fall to 148 K, the frost point of CO2, during the polar wintertime. In the north, the CO2 ice completely dissipates (sublimes) in summer, leaving behind a residual cap of water (H2O) ice. At the south pole, a small residual cap of CO2 ice remains in summer. Both residual ice caps overlie thick layered deposits of interbedded ice and dust. In the north, the layered deposits form a 3 km-high, 1,000 km-diameter plateau called Planum Boreum. A similar kilometers-thick plateau, Planum Australe, lies in the south. Both plana (the Latin plural of planum) are sometimes treated as synonymous with the polar ice caps, but the permanent ice (seen as the high albedo, white surfaces in images) forms only a relatively thin mantle on top of the layered deposits. The layered deposits probably represent alternating cycles of dust and ice deposition caused by climate changes related to variations in the planet's orbital parameters over time (see also Milankovitch cycles). The polar layered deposits are some of the youngest geologic units on Mars.  Geological history   Albedo features  orographic clouds over Olympus and Elysium Montes (left and right, respectively). No topography is visible on Mars from Earth. The bright areas and dark markings seen through a telescope are albedo features. The bright, red-ochre areas are locations where fine dust covers the surface. Bright areas (excluding the polar caps and clouds) include Hellas, Tharsis, and Arabia Terra. The dark gray markings represent areas that the wind has swept clean of dust, leaving behind the lower layer of dark, rocky material. Dark markings are most distinct in a broad belt from 0° to 40° S latitude. However, the most prominent dark marking, Syrtis Major Planum, is in the northern hemisphere. The classical albedo feature, Mare Acidalium (Acidalia Planitia), is another prominent dark area in the northern hemisphere. A third type of area, intermediate in color and albedo, is also present and thought to represent regions containing a mixture of the material from the bright and dark areas.  Impact craters  Impact craters were first identified on Mars by the Mariner 4 spacecraft in 1965. Early observations showed that Martian craters were generally shallower and smoother than lunar craters, indicating that Mars has a more active history of erosion and deposition than the Moon. In other aspects, Martian craters resemble lunar craters. Both are products of hypervelocity impacts and show a progression of morphology types with increasing size. Martian craters below about 7 km in diameter are called simple craters; they are bowl-shaped with sharp raised rims and have depth/diameter ratios of about 1/5. Martian craters change from simple to more complex types at diameters of roughly 5 to 8 km. Complex craters have central peaks (or peak complexes), relatively flat floors, and terracing or slumping along the inner walls. Complex craters are shallower than simple craters in proportion to their widths, with depth/diameter ratios ranging from 1/5 at the simple-to-complex transition diameter (~7 km) to about 1/30 for a 100-km diameter crater. Another transition occurs at crater diameters of around 130 km as central peaks turn into concentric rings of hills to form multi-ring basins. Mars has the greatest diversity of impact crater types of any planet in the Solar System. This is partly because the presence of both rocky and volatile-rich layers in the subsurface produces a range of morphologies even among craters within the same size classes. Mars also has an atmosphere that plays a role in ejecta emplacement and subsequent erosion. Moreover, Mars has a rate of volcanic and tectonic activity low enough that ancient, eroded craters are still preserved, yet high enough to have resurfaced large areas of the planet, producing a diverse range of crater populations of widely differing ages. Over 42,000 impact craters greater than 5 km in diameter have been catalogued on Mars, and the number of smaller craters is probably innumerable. The density of craters on Mars is highest in the southern hemisphere, south of the dichotomy boundary. This is where most of the large craters and basins are located. Crater morphology provides information about the physical structure and composition of the surface and subsurface at the time of impact. For example, the size of central peaks in Martian craters is larger than comparable craters on Mercury or the Moon.Hale, W.S.; Head, J.W. (1981). Lunar Planet. Sci. XII, pp. 386-388. (abstract 1135). http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc1981/pdf/1135.pdf In addition, the central peaks of many large craters on Mars have pit craters at their summits. Central pit craters are rare on the Moon but are very common on Mars and the icy satellites of the outer Solar System. Large central peaks and the abundance of pit craters probably indicate the presence of near-surface ice at the time of impact. Polewards of 30 degrees of latitude, the form of older impact craters is rounded out (\\"softened\\") by acceleration of soil creep by ground ice. The most notable difference between Martian craters and other craters in the Solar System is the presence of lobate (fludized) ejecta blankets. Many craters at equatorial and mid-latitudes on Mars have this form of ejecta morphology, which is thought to arise when the impacting object melts ice in the subsurface. Liquid water in the ejected material forms a muddy slurry that flows along the surface, producing the characteristic lobe shapes. The crater Yuty is a good example of a rampart crater, which is so called because of the rampart-like edge to its ejecta blanket.

Note prominent rampart. Martian craters are commonly classified by their ejecta. Craters with one ejecta layer are called single-layer ejecta (SLE) craters. Craters with two superposed ejecta blankets are called double-layer ejecta (DLE) craters, and craters with more than two ejecta layers are called multiple-layered ejecta (MLE) craters. These morphological differences are thought to reflect compositional differences (i.e. interlayered ice, rock, or water) in the subsurface at the time of impact.Boyce, J.M. The Smithsonian Book of Mars; Konecky&Konecky;: Old Saybrook, CT, 2008, p. 203. Pedestal crater in Amazonis quadrangle as seen by HiRISE. Martian craters show a large diversity of preservational states, from extremely fresh to old and eroded. Degraded and infilled impact craters record variations in volcanic, fluvial, and eolian activity over geologic time. Pedestal craters are craters with their ejecta sitting above the surrounding terrain to form raised platforms. They occur because the crater's ejecta forms a resistant layer so that the area nearest the crater erodes more slowly than the rest of the region. Some pedestals are hundreds of meters above the surrounding area, meaning that hundreds of meters of material were eroded away. Pedestal craters were first observed during the Mariner 9 mission in 1972.http://hirise.lpl.eduPSP_008508_1870Bleacher, J. and S. Sakimoto.

LPSC  Volcanism  X-ray diffraction view of Martian soil - CheMin analysis reveals feldspar, pyroxenes, olivine and more (Curiosity rover at \\"Rocknest\\", October 17, 2012). Volcanic structures and landforms cover large portions of the Martian surface. The most conspicuous volcanoes on Mars are located in Tharsis and Elysium. Geologists think one of the reasons volcanoes on Mars were able to grow so large is that Mars has fewer tectonic boundaries in comparison to Earth. Lava from a stationary hot spot was able to accumulate at one location on the surface for many hundreds of millions of years. Scientists have never recorded an active volcano eruption on the surface of Mars. Searches for thermal signatures and surface changes within the last decade have not yielded evidence for active volcanism. On October 17, 2012, the Curiosity rover on the planet Mars at \\"Rocknest\\" performed the first X-ray diffraction analysis of Martian soil. The results from the rover's CheMin analyzer revealed the presence of several minerals, including feldspar, pyroxenes and olivine, and suggested that the Martian soil in the sample was similar to the \\"weathered basaltic soils\\" of Hawaiian volcanoes. In July 2015, the same rover identified tridymite in a rock sample from Gale Crater, leading scientists to conclude that silicic volcanism might have played a much more prevalent role in the planet's volcanic history than previously thought. Sedimentology Collection of spheres, each about 3 mm in diameter as seen by Opportunity rover Flowing water appears to have been common on the surface of Mars at various points in its history, and especially on ancient Mars. Many of these flows carved the surface, forming valley networks and producing sediment. This sediment has been redeposited in a wide variety of wet environments, including in alluvial fans, meandering channels, deltas, lakes, and perhaps even oceans.Carr, M. 2006. The Surface of Mars. Cambridge University Press. Grotzinger, J. and R. Milliken (eds.) 2012. Sedimentary Geology of Mars. SEPM The processes of deposition and transportation are associated with gravity. Due to gravity, related differences in water fluxes and flow speeds, inferred from grain size distributions, Martian landscapes were created by different environmental conditions.Patrick Zasada (2013/14): Gradation of extraterrestrial fluvial sediments – related to the gravity. - Z. geol. Wiss. 41/42 (3): 167-183. Abstract Nevertheless, there are other ways of estimating the amount of water on ancient Mars (see: Water on Mars). Groundwater has been implicated in the cementation of aeolian sediments and the formation and transport of a wide variety of sedimentary minerals including clays, sulphates and hematite. When the surface has been dry, wind has been a major geomorphic agent. Wind driven sand bodies like megaripples and dunes are extremely common on the modern Martian surface, and Opportunity has documented abundant aeolian sandstones on its traverse.S. W. Squyres and A. H. Knoll, Sedimentary Geology at Meridiani Planum, Mars, Elsevier, Amsterdam, (2005); reprinted from Earth and Planetary Science Letters, Vol. 240, No. 1 (2005). Ventifacts, like Jake Matijevic (rock), are another aeolian landform on the Martian Surface.Zasada, P., 2013: Entstehung des Marsgesteins \\"Jake Matijevic\\". – Sternzeit, issue 2/2013: 98 ff. (in German language). A wide variety of other sedimentological facies are also present locally on Mars, including glacial deposits, hot springs, dry mass movement deposits (especially landslides), and cryogenic and periglacial material, amongst many others. Evidence for ancient rivers, a lake, and dune fields have all been observed in the preserved strata by rovers at Meridiani Planum and Gale crater.  Common surface features   Groundwater on Mars  One group of researchers proposed that some of the layers on Mars were caused by groundwater rising to the surface in many places, especially inside of craters. According to the theory, groundwater with dissolved minerals came to the surface, in and later around craters, and helped to form layers by adding minerals (especially sulfate) and cementing sediments. This hypothesis is supported by a groundwater model and by sulfates discovered in a wide area. At first, by examining surface materials with Opportunity Rover, scientists discovered that groundwater had repeatedly risen and deposited sulfates. Later studies with instruments on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter showed that the same kinds of materials exist in a large area that included Arabia.M. Wiseman, J. C. Andrews-Hanna, R. E. Arvidson3, J. F. Mustard, K. J. Zabrusky DISTRIBUTION OF HYDRATED SULFATES ACROSS ARABIA TERRA USING CRISM DATA: IMPLICATIONS FOR MARTIAN HYDROLOGY. 42nd Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2011) 2133.pdf  Interesting geomorphological features  = Avalanches = On February 19, 2008, images obtained by the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter showed a spectacular avalanche, in which debris thought to be fine-grained ice, dust, and large blocks fell from a high cliff. Evidence of the avalanche included dust clouds rising from the cliff afterwards.DiscoveryChannel.ca - Mars avalanche caught on camera Such geological events are theorized to be the cause of geologic patterns known as slope streaks.

Image:Mars Avalanche Dust Clouds.jpgDust clouds rise above the deep cliff. Image:Mars Avalanche with Scale.jpgA photo with scale demonstrates the size of the avalanche. = Possible caves = NASA scientists studying pictures from the Odyssey spacecraft have spotted what might be seven caves on the flanks of the Arsia Mons volcano on Mars. The pit entrances measure from wide and they are thought to be at least deep. See image below: the pits have been informally named (A) Dena, (B) Chloe, (C) Wendy, (D) Annie, (E) Abby (left) and Nikki, and (F) Jeanne. Dena's floor was observed and found to be 130 m deep. Further investigation suggested that these were not necessarily lava tube \\"skylights\\". Review of the images has resulted in yet more discoveries of deep pits. It has been suggested that human explorers on Mars could use lava tubes as shelters. The caves may be the only natural structures offering protection from the micrometeoroids, UV radiation, solar flares, and high energy particles that bombard the planet's surface. These features may enhance preservation of biosignatures over long periods of time and make caves an attractive astrobiology target in the search for evidence of life beyond Earth.Preparing for Robotic Astrobiology Missions to Lava Caves on Mars: The BRAILLE Project at Lava Beds National Monument. 42nd COSPAR Scientific Assembly.

It is believed that materials like large rocks were deposited in low-lying areas. Later, wind erosion removed much of the surface layers, but left behind the more resistant deposits. Other ways of making inverted relief might be lava flowing down a stream bed or materials being cemented by minerals dissolved in water. On Earth, materials cemented by silica are highly resistant to all kinds of erosional forces. Examples of inverted channels on Earth are found in the Cedar Mountain Formation near Green River, Utah. Inverted relief in the shape of streams are further evidence of water flowing on the Martian surface in past times. Inverted relief in the form of stream channels suggest that the climate was different—much wetter—when the inverted channels were formed. In an article published in January 2010, a large group of scientists endorsed the idea of searching for life in Miyamoto Crater because of inverted stream channels and minerals that indicated the past presence of water. Images of other examples of inverted terrain are shown below from various parts of Mars.

Objectives The primary objective of the CSPA is to promote safe, enjoyable sport parachuting through cooperation and adherence to self-imposed rules and recommendations. This means skydivers and skydiving companies that wish to be members of the CSPA have to adhere to established Basic Safety Rules throughout their parachuting career. Such Rules include minimum opening altitudes for certain levels of experience; mandatory equipment; clear weather conditions for jumping, reserve repack due dates, general operational requirements and so on. These Basic Safety Rules greatly reduce the risk of accidents for individual skydivers, skydiving companies, and the sport as a whole. A Canadian Drop Zone must adhere to all of these safety rules if it wants to be a member of the CSPA. The CSPA has other initiatives to promote overall safety such as recommended procedures and instructor qualification requirements. A Canadian skydiver starts off with a solo license, then progresses onward to their A, B, C, and D license. The CSPA requires that each skydiver keep a log of every jump signed by another jumper and submit that log book to acquire these qualifications. For example, to get a B License you have to be able to perform certain maneuvers and have 50 skydives which are all documented in the submitted logbook. Without this sort of basic proof skydivers would have no idea how many jumps they have done and could embellish experience levels. This was a very big risk before but through the proper establishment of documentation procedures, proof of a skydivers experience is easily attainable preventing inexperienced instructors to take the lead. The CSPA continually updates all programs and initiatives to adapt to increasing incidents and changes in technology. Each skydiver and skydiving company who are members must implement all changes to remain members. CanPara CSPA publishes CanPara, a bimonthly bilingual publication devoted to informing the Canadian skydiving community of important activities and events in Canadian and worldwide skydiving.

Saltman was perhaps best known to the public as the man that Evel Knievel tried to beat to death with a baseball bat in 1977. Saltman created, wrote, and produced shows for television such as Pro-Fan, Challenge of the NFL Cheerleaders (an early \\"reality\\" show), and the film Ring of Passion about the fights between American boxer Joe Louis and German champion Max Schmeling in the years leading up to World War II. He was also the author of various books including Evel Knievel on Tour, with Maury Green, and FEAR NO EVEL: An Insider's Look At Hollywood with Thomas Lyons. Early years Shelly Saltman grew up during the Great Depression years as the child of Russian and Ukrainian Orthodox Jewish parents in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His father, Nate Saltman, was involved in Boston area politics. Sports Saltman's father and an uncle, Louie, both played football for the Boston Braves (today, the Washington Redskins); another uncle, Eddie, pitched for the Boston Braves baseball team; and his uncle Miltie played for the Philadelphia Athletics (today, the Oakland Athletics). Saltman spent much of his childhood playing sports, attending Boston Red Sox and Boston Braves baseball games, and attempted to play professional basketball. Saltman became a professional sportscaster and play-by-play announcer under the name of \\"Art Sheldon\\" with a career that included stints as a basketball coach, a baseball umpire, and a boxing ring announcer. He was among the founders of several professional and amateur sports organizations including the Phoenix Suns and the New Orleans Jazz basketball teams, and he was the first President of Fox Sports. Saltman handled the worldwide promotion of the Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier boxing championships, was co-creator of the 1970s \\"Challenge of the Sexes\\" TV shows, a key promoter and business partner in the failed Snake River Canyon rocket-cycle jump by motorcycle daredevil Evel Knievel, and for a time managed the careers of such sports stars as Canadian NHL hockey player Wayne Gretzky and American boxing champion Thomas Hearns. Entertainment After serving in Japan as a sports announcer and radio broadcaster for the Far East Network of the U.S. Army during the Korean War, Saltman came home to the U.S. and began a television career in NBC working for the Gillette Cavalcade of Sports. He went on work as an executive for WBZ-TV in Boston and WJW-TV in Cleveland, making his mark as a promoter by doing such things as holding a press conference in a submarine underneath Boston Harbor for the TV show The Silent Service. From Cleveland he moved on to a position as a Vice President for MCA in New York, working for what was then the largest and most influential talent agency in America. Saltman left MCA and New York after several years, accepting an offer from the Los Angeles talent agency of Bernard, Williams, and Price to focus his talents on promoting the international career of singing and recording star Andy Williams. While in Los Angeles, he worked as a public relations consultant, promoter, and/or manager for numerous performers including actor Jack Albertson, Wilt Chamberlain, and Roger Miller, and worked as the first national publicist for The Osmonds. Evel Knievel attack In the mid-1970s, Saltman was one of the principals in a company called Invest West Sports. His company was contacted by boxing and sports promoter Bob Arum to invest the money necessary to fund and promote the Snake River Canyon rocket-cycle jump by motorcycle stuntman Evel Knievel. Saltman's company agreed with the condition that Saltman would head up the media promotion. During the months of promotion, Saltman carried a cassette- tape recorder with him in order to record the elements of the promotion for an upcoming book. Knievel, Arum, and many others involved in the promotion were daily featured on the recordings and Saltman claimed they were aware of his intention to write about his experience. Three years later in 1977, Dell Publishing released Saltman's book under the title Evel Knievel on Tour, which included information about Knievel, information that Knievel claimed damaged his image and was misleading to the public. Knievel was outraged because he claimed the book misled the public about not only himself, but his family as well. A few weeks after publication, Knievel went onto the lot of 20th Century Fox Studios, where Saltman was a Vice President. One of Knievel's friends grabbed Saltman and held him, while Knievel attacked him with an aluminum baseball bat, declaring, \\"I'm going to kill you!\\" According to a witness to the attack, Knievel struck repeated blows at Saltman's head, with Saltman blocking the blows with his left arm. Saltman's arm and wrist were shattered in several places before he fell to the ground unconscious. When the news of Knievel's assault on Saltman was broadcast on national television, Saltman's elderly mother had a heart attack. She died three months later. Knievel received a sentence of six months in work furlough for his assault on Saltman. A civil lawsuit was then filed; the civil court judge called Knievel's acts \\"cowardly\\" and awarded Saltman $12.75 million in damages. Knievel declared himself to be bankrupt and none of the civil award was paid. In 2007, Saltman released a second book entitled Fear No Evel: An Insider's Look at Hollywood in which he told his side of the Knievel attack, as well as his involvement in American sports and media. After Knievel's death in late 2007, Saltman announced he would be suing the estate for the unpaid award from the civil suit, which he said amounted to over $100 million US dollars with interest, which remained uncollected throughout Saltman’s life. Family Saltman was married for almost 51 years to Mollie Heifetz, who died on July 1, 2007 after suffering from cancer and kidney disease. The couple had two children. He went on to spend his remaining years with his partner Susan Nober. Death Saltman died on February 16, 2019 at the age of 87.

PORV are also called pilot-operated safety valve (POSV), pilot-operated pressure relief valve (POPRV), or pilot-operated safety relief valve (POSRV), depending on the manufacturer and the application. Technically POPRV is the most generic term, but PORV is often used generically (as in this article) even though it should refer to valves in liquid service. In conventional PRVs, the valve is normally held closed by a spring or similar mechanism that presses a disk or piston on a seat, which is forced open if the pressure is greater than the mechanical value of the spring. In the PORV, the valve is held shut by piping a small amount of the fluid to the rear of the sealing disk, with the pressure balanced on either side. A separate actuator on the piping releases pressure in the line if it crosses a threshold. This releases the pressure on the back of the seal, causing the valve to open. The essential parts of a PORV are a pilot valve (or control pilot), a main valve, a pilot tube, the dome, a disc or piston, and a seat. The volume above the piston is called the dome.  Mode of functioning  The pressure is supplied from the upstream side (the system being protected) to the dome often by a small pilot tube. The downstream side is the pipe or open air where the PORV directs its exhaust. The outlet pipe is typically larger than the inlet. , , , , are some common sizes. The upstream pressure tries to push the piston open but it is opposed by that same pressure because the pressure is routed around to the dome above the piston. The area of the piston on which fluid force is acting is larger in the dome than it is on the upstream side; the result is a larger force on the dome side than the upstream side. This produces a net sealing force. The pressure from the pilot tube to the dome is routed through the actual control pilot valve. There are many designs but the control pilot is essentially a conventional PRV with the special job of controlling pressure to the main valve dome. The pressure at which the control pilot relieves is the functional set pressure of the PORV. When the pilot valve reaches set pressure it opens and releases the pressure from the dome. The piston is then free to open and the main valve exhausts the system fluid. The control pilot opens either to the main valve exhaust pipe or to atmosphere. ;Snap acting: At set pressure the valve snaps to full lift. This can be quite violent on large pipes with significant pressure. The pressure has to drop below the set pressure in order for the piston to reseat (see blowdown in relief valve article). ;Modulating: The pilot is designed to open gradually, so that less of the system fluid is lost during each relief event. The piston lifts in proportion to the overpressure. Blowdown is typically short.  Comparison to Conventional Pressure Relief Valves  =Advantages= * Smaller package on the larger pipe sizes. * More options for control. * Seals more tightly as the system pressure approaches but does not reach set pressure. * Control pilot can be mounted remotely. * Some designs allow for changes in orifice size within the main valve. * Can be used in engines. * Higher Operating-to-Set Pressure ratio. =Disadvantages= * More complex, resulting in various fail- open failure modes. * More expensive at smaller sizes (starts to even out as pipe size increases). * Small parts in pilot valve are sensitive to contaminant particles. * Soft goods typically installed in pilot valves cannot withstand higher temperature fluids.

Its last assignment was with Air Defense Command, assigned to Tenth Air Force, being stationed at Sioux City Municipal Airport, Iowa. It was inactivated on 18 September 1968. History Assigned to Air Defense Command (ADC) for most of its existence, the division's initial mission was the air defense of the upper Great Lakes region of the United States. The 30th equipped, administered, trained, and provided operationally ready forces to the appropriate commanders for air defense. The division trained attached and assigned units and supervised and participated in numerous exercises such as Kiowa Knife and Mandan Indian. Moved to Sioux City Municipal Airport in 1966 as part of an ADC reorganization and became responsible for air defense a large area of the upper Midwest after the inactivation of the Sioux City Air Defense Sector. Assumed additional designation of 30th NORAD Region after activation of the NORAD Combat Operations Center at the Cheyenne Mountain Complex, Colorado and reporting was transferred to NORAD from ADC at Ent Air Force Base in April 1966. The 30th administered and trained subordinate units, and participated in numerous air defense training exercises. In addition, during the 1960s it supervised training of Air National Guard units with a pertinent mobilization assignment. Inactivated in September 1968 as ADC phased down its interceptor mission as the chances of a Soviet bomber attack on the United States seemed remote, its mission being consolidated into North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and its assets transferred to 24th NORAD Region/Air Division.

Kozameh has published seven novels, a collection of short stories and three books of poetry. She has also edited two anthologies and wrote a book in collaboration with other authors, former political prisoners from the last Argentine military dictatorship in her country. Life Alicia Kozameh was born in Rosario, Santa Fe to a father of Lebanese Christian background and a mother of Syrian Jewish origin. She studied philosophy and literature at the University of Rosario from 1973 to 1975, and at the University of Buenos Aires from 1985 to 1987. Her studies were interrupted from September 1975 until December 1978 while she was detained as a political prisoner during Argentina's most recent military dictatorship. After her release, she continued to suffer constant repression and persecution, and was forced to go into exile in 1980, first in California, and later in Mexico. During her exile, she published works in Mexico and California and wrote her first novel, El séptimo sueño (The Seventh Dream), a manuscript she decided not to publish. She returned to Argentina in 1984, after the Falklands War and the return of democratic elections to her country. In 1987, the Editorial Contrapunto, in Buenos Aires, published her second novel, Pasos bajo el agua (Steps Under Water), a fictionalized account of her experiences as a political prisoner and an exile. Many other articles and stories were published in newspapers and cultural magazines in Buenos Aires during that period, as well as reviews of Pasos bajo el agua, which sold out in six months. In Buenos Aires, she completed a screenplay based on her novel Steps Under Water. The English translation of Pasos bajo el agua (Steps Under Water) was published by University of California Press in 1996. The novel has been included in course syllabi of numerous university classes in the United States. The German version of this novel, Schritte unter Wasser, was published by Milena Verlag Editions, Vienna, in 1999. As a consequence of the publication of Pasos bajo el agua in 1987, Kozameh was threatened by members of the Argentine political police. She returned to California for her family's safety in 1988. Since then, she has been invited by Amnesty International to participate in panel discussions and speak at conferences about her literary works and experiences as a political prisoner. Her third novel is Patas de Avestruz (Ostrich Legs), from which several chapters have been published in different literary magazines and anthologies. Straussenbeine, a German translation of the novel, was published by Milena Verlag in 1997, and the English translation was published by WingsPress, Texas, in 2013. Her novel 259 saltos, uno inmortal, a reflection about exile, was published by Narvaja Publishers, Argentina, in November 2001, and a second edition was published by Alción Editora in 2012. Its English version, 259 Leaps, the Last Immortal, has come out in the fall of 2006 by WingsPress, Texas. Alción Editora, Córdoba, Argentina, published a new edition of Pasos bajo el agua in November 2002. In 2003 Alción also published the Spanish version of Patas de avestruz, and in July 2004 Ofrenda de propia piel, a collection of short stories, came out by the same publishing house. In 2009 Alción published her book of poetry Mano en vuelo. In August 2005 and 2006 the anthologies Caleidoscopio: la mujer en la mira and Caleidoscopio 2: inmigrantes en la mira were published by the Instituto Movilizador de Fondos Cooperativos, Buenos Aires. Her most recent works include the novels Basse danse (2007), Natatio aeterna (2011), Eni Furtado no ha dejado de correr (2013) and Bruno regresa descalzo (2016). Kozameh's works have been widely anthologized. She is frequently invited to give readings and lectures at literary conferences and at special presentations organized by Departments of Languages and Literature throughout the United States, Latin America, and Europe. She is an active participant of such organizations as Latin American Studies Association (LASA). Alicia Kozameh lives in Los Angeles, where she continues writing, while teaching creative writing at Chapman University. Awards One of the chapters from the book, \\"Carta a Aubervillieres,\\" (\\"Letter to Aubervillieres\\"), received the \\"CRISIS\\" award for best short story in 1986.

The station was owned by Bahakel Communications out of Charlotte, North Carolina, and last offered a sports talk format. WDOD was the oldest radio station in Chattanooga, having gone on the air on April 13, 1925 at 1280 on the AM dial. The frequency was changed to 1310 in the early 1940s. Bahakel acquired the station in 1963; previous owners of the station include Norman Thomas and Earl Winger (who owned a crystal radio company, and started WDOD to give people who bought their radios a station to listen to), as well as H. Clay Evans and Interstate Insurance. From 1948 to 1997 it was Chattanooga's original country radio station, and added a FM simulcast on WDOD-FM in 1960. The simulcast continued until WDOD-FM changed its format to AAA. WDOD was briefly an affiliate of Air America Radio in 2005–2006. Prior to that the station had an adult standards format. Until 2009, the station derived a portion of its programming from Scott Shannon's The True Oldies Channel from Citadel Media. After dropping The True Oldies Channel, WDOD simulcast its sister station WDEF (1370 AM), a Fox Sports Radio affiliate, from 7 p.m. to 10 a.m. From 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. the station aired Sporting News Radio's Tim Brando and 2 Live Stews, and the regionally syndicated Paul Finebaum show. 2 Live Stews was subsequently replaced with a local show hosted by Chris Goforth. WDOD was the local radio affiliate of the Chattanooga Lookouts, a minor league baseball team that was the Double-A affiliate of the Los Angeles Dodgers when the station signed off and currently serve as the Double-A affiliate of the Minnesota Twins. WDOD signed off permanently on May 31, 2011. The transmitter property was sold to the Baylor School (which will use the land for an expansion) the following day, while the license was returned to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

Immediately after graduation he stayed two years at the University of Bologna as an assistant of Federigo Enriques, but he renounced in 1911 convinced that, as he had produced little, it was better to start teaching. In 1911 he won the Chair at school and became a professor at the Teaching Institute of Aosta. In 1914 he married Amalia Artom (also a mathematician) and they had two children: historian and partisan Emanuele (1915–1944) and Ennio (1920–1940), who died doing mountain trekking. In 1920 he taught at a technical institute in Turin and subsequently at the Scientific High School \\"Galileo Ferraris\\", also in Turin. Immediately after World War I, Artom produced the scientific publications which would gain him the 1930 Mathesis award for a history of conic sections in elementary mathematics. Almost resolved to a more sustained effort in scientific research, he could not however obtain a professorship due to political reasons, as he was not willing to join the National Fascist Party. Artom hence committed himself to linguistic studies. The tragic events of the family and the entire Italian Jewish community after the 1938 Italian Racial Laws kept him permanently away from the study of mathematics. He died in Turin in 1952.

In the 1970s, CTV produced The Starlost. In the 1980s, Canadian animation studios including Nelvana, began producing a growing proportion of the world market in animation. In the 1990s, Canada became an important player in live action speculative fiction on television, with dozens of series like Forever Knight, Robocop, and most notably The X-Files and Stargate SG-1. Many series have been produced for youth and children's markets, including Deepwater Black and MythQuest. In the first decade of the 21st century, changes in provincial tax legislation prompted many production companies to move from Toronto to Vancouver. Recent series produced in Vancouver include The Dead Zone, Smallville, Andromeda, Stargate Atlantis, Stargate Universe, The 4400, Sanctuary and the reimagined Battlestar Galactica. Because of the small size of the domestic television market, most Canadian productions involve partnerships with production studios based in the United States and Europe. However, in recent years, new partnership arrangements are allowing Canadian investors a growing share of control of projects produced in Canada and elsewhere. History of science fiction television in Canada Science fiction in Canada was produced by the CBC in its early years, notably the series Space Command (1953–1954). Actors such as James Doohan and William Shatner first appeared on Canadian television, before finding success in the United States. In the 1970s, CTV produced The Starlost in its Scarborough studios. In the 1980s, many animation houses, most notably Nelvana, began producing a growing proportion of the world market in animation; Canada has become the world leader in 3D animation with shows like ReBoot and Tripping the Rift. Only in the 1990s, with changes in exchange rates and tax legislation, plus a growing skills set among local production companies which had had success in local production and in producing films for American and international markets, that Canada became an important player in live action speculative fiction on television, with shows like Forever Knight, RoboCop, and most notably The X-Files and Stargate SG-1. The merger that produced Alliance Atlantis found itself with a large stable of science fiction shows, while Lions Gate Television, Fireworks Entertainment, CanWest Global, and CHUM Television produced shows of their own. American-based companies like Fox, Warner Bros., Paramount, and Universal also built substantial operations in Canada for their productions. During the 1990s and early 2000s, dozens of science fiction shows were produced in Canada, taking large market shares in American and international markets. A large body of shows have been produced for youth and children's markets, including Deepwater Black, 2030 CE, and MythQuest; many of these are mainly distributed outside North America. Actors and creative staff Famous Canadian actors who played popular science fiction roles include Dan Aykroyd, John Candy, Jim Carrey, James Doohan, Nathan Fillion, Michael J. Fox, Lorne Greene, Michael Ironside, Leslie Nielsen, Walter Pidgeon, Christopher Plummer, Michael Shanks, William Shatner, Martin Short, Marc Singer, Donald Sutherland, Kiefer Sutherland, Amanda Tapping, Lexa Doig, Laura Bertram, Keanu Reeves, Kristin Kreuk and Carrie-Anne Moss. Well-known Canadian filmmakers who have produced science fiction include James Cameron, David Cronenberg, Lex Gigeroff and Norman Jewison. Canada's science fiction television industry is closely related to the United States. Many Canadian-born actors like Nicole de Boer, Amanda Tapping, Tricia Helfer, and Anthony Michael Hall are immediately recognizable to American SF fans, while some American-born actors and producers like Christopher Judge and Peter DeLuise have spent most of their working lives in Canada. The Constellation Awards are awarded annually in Canada to honour the best science fiction or fantasy television or film works of the previous year. After coming to Canada as a guest at Toronto Trek in 1994 and 1995, Majel Barrett Roddenberry chose Toronto as a base for producing Earth: Final Conflict, based on a concept created by her late husband, Gene Roddenberry; her son Rod became a Canadian resident for three years to work with the production team. Toronto to Vancouver In the early 2000s, changes in provincial tax legislation prompted many production companies to move from Toronto to Vancouver, which already had a strong television production industry. Recent popular shows produced in Vancouver include The Dead Zone, The 4400, Andromeda, Stargate Atlantis, and the remake of Battlestar Galactica. Since 1995, more than half a billion dollars a year is spent on media production in Vancouver, with $1.4 billion in 2003 alone. Production also began growing in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and elsewhere, such as the production of Lexx in Halifax. However, Toronto continued to be a base for shows like Odyssey 5, Jake 2.0, and Mutant X. Foreign control and co-production Because of the small size of the domestic television market, most Canadian productions involve partnerships with production studios based in the United States and Europe. This sometimes create long preparation cycles for many shows, with years of delay between initial creative development and actual production. Although American management was a common model for Canadian production in the 1990s, more complex partnership arrangements are allowing Canadian investors a growing share of control of projects produced in Canada.

Focusing on the saloon halls, gambling dens, and winding alleys of the Bowery and the Five Points district of Lower Manhattan, the book evokes the destitution and violence of a turbulent era, when colorfully named criminals like \\"Dandy\\" Johnny Dolan, William Poole (also known as Bill the Butcher), and Hell-Cat Maggie lurked in the shadows, and infamous gangs including the Plug Uglies, Dead Rabbits, and Bowery Boys ruled the streets. It includes a rogues' gallery of prostitutes, pimps, poisoners, pickpockets, murderers, and thieves. The book contains detailed accounts of the New York City draft riots in 1863. It also elaborates on numerous other criminal influences of the time, including river pirates and the corrupt political establishment such as Tammany Hall.

It is placed in the cavity wall during construction and spans the cavity. The ends of the tie are designed to lock into the mortar. Also incorporated into the design of the tie is means of preventing water transfer from the outer to the inner leaves. In flat ties, this can be a twist. In wire ties, this can be corrugations formed in the wire or again a twist.  Background  Cavity walls often have insulation in the cavity which may either partially or fully fill the cavity. Partial fill insulation systems require specialized ties or clips to keep the insulation in position. A vapour barrier may be necessary on the inner wall to prevent interstitial condensation. This is often incorporated into the cavity wall insulation system. The spacing of ties is laid down in building regulations, though there may be variations with specialised blocks. Additional ties are used around window and door openings. Improper installation may lead to water damage or fungus formation within the cavity, leading to structural and health hazards. Ties are exposed to water and chemical attack from cement. They were traditionally made of galvanized steel, the fishtail tie being the most common. On high quality work, ties were occasionally made of bronze. In the mid-twentieth century, wire ties were widely used, again made from galvanized steel wire. As time has passed, many galvanized steel ties have deteriorated due to moisture in the outer leaf of brickwork. The corrosion may force apart the cement joints and even result in the collapse of walls if no remedial action is taken. Any cracks appearing in cavity walls dating from the twentieth century need to be investigated before irremediable damage ensues. Horizontal cracking is especially suspect. Failed ties have to be isolated and substitute specialist ties installed by drilling through inner and outer leaves from outside the building. The replacement ties may be fixed mechanically or with special adhesives. Galvanized steel ties are no longer in use for this reason. For a brief period, plastic ties were used but were not satisfactory. Modern practice is to use stainless steel ties. Cavity walls were traditionally spaced 2\\"(50mm) apart. Due to the need for thicker insulation in exterior walls these days, a range of longer ties are now available so that cavities of up to 6\\"(150mm) can be constructed.  Types of ties  Ties in a cavity wall are typically made of iron, steel, or plastic; though figures are various. Basically, a tie has ring to fasten with mortar on both end like a bow. Ties would be selected by type of masonry, the cavity width, and so on. Typically, ties in a cavity wall are double triangular shape (like a bow), though, depending on the existence of another layer (e.g. insulation sheet) at the cavity, which fills the cavity partially, ties include retaining discs or rods.Cavity Wall Tie  Tie failure  Failure of ties is an increasing problem with cavity wall ties made from galvanized steel. It arises when the galvanizing is not of sufficient quality and the outer leaf of the cavity wall allows water penetration, usually due to porous brick/blockwork. If the tie rusts, the swelling effect may cause horizontal, external cracks to appear in the wall. Frost action can swiftly enlarge these cracks to cause damage. = Tie corrosion = Since ties in a cavity wall are typically made of metal (iron or steel), they are prone to corrode over time. When metal corrodes, it expands its size, causing ties to lift up from the brickwork. Cracks caused by vertical loads leave parts of buildings vulnerable to corrosion, such as eaves and gable walls above purlin positions, or placed directly beneath openings, where the weight on brickwork is light. Over the time, cracks appear from the top of the wall and extend downward. Cracks due to tie corrosion at the cavity wall are horizontal and tend to occur at the location of wall ties, normally 6 courses apart. The corrosion causes the walls to detach and tilt, resulting in the outer wall snapping outward. The inner wall is held in place by the added support of floor joists. At the gable wall, inner walls without these supporting joists, bow inwards. By avoiding several factors accelerating corrosion, it will last more than 60 years.  Acceleration factors of tie corrosion  partially-filled Cavity wall tiesDue to its materiality of the tie, its corrosion is related to the extent of the exposure at acidic substances. The major factors of the corrosion are: * Acidic black ash mortar * Exposure (coastal or general) * Coastal areas (salt in the atmosphere) * Industrial areas (acid rain) * Cavity wall insulation Cement-based mortar, giving an alkaline environment for cavity wall ties, has been used since the Second World War. Alkaline environment is beneficial for ties protecting from acid and procrastinating the corrosion process. Before cement-based mortar, lime-based one was used, which does not present an alkaline environment. Therefore, the majority buildings with wall tie corrosion are built before the Second World War. An alkaline degree gets weaker while exposed at acidic rain over the time. Moreover, metal corrosion is a chemical reaction that the reaction rate is triggered by water and heat. Thus, some say that cavity wall insulation enhance the ability to grab water longer, so that the environment of the ties damper. Accordingly, the South or South West elevations warmed by the sunlight are warmer, letting ties more at risk for this type of corrosion.

Paracaspases are proteins related to caspases present in animals and slime mold, in contrast to metacaspases, which are present in plants, fungi, and \\"protists\\". The phylogenetic distribution is a bit confusing, since slime mold diverged earlier than the animal/fungal split. Paracaspase has been first identified in a recurrent t(11;18)(q21;q21) chromosomal translocation associated with a subset of MALT lymphoma. This leads to a fusion oncoprotein consisting of the carboxyl terminus of MALT1 and the amino terminus of c-IAP2. Paracaspases are more similar to caspases than metacaspases are, indicating that this group of proteases diverged from caspases from a common metacaspase ancestor. Structure and Evolution Most non-metazoan paracaspases found in amoebas or bacteria are \\"type 2\\" paracaspases with only a caspase-like domain. The animal paracaspases are most likely not directly related to the amoeba paracaspase. It is currently unclear whether the paracaspases (and caspases) found in eukaryotes are a result from several (at least 2) independent horizontal gene transfer events from prokaryotes or if there has been a convergent evolution of (para)caspases evolved from the metacaspases in several different organisms within the eukaryotes. =Animals= \\"Type 2\\" The \\"type 2\\" paracaspases in animals represent the ancestral form which only consists of a caspase-like domain. This form of paracaspase can be found in ctenophora, trichoplax, sponges and cnidarians. Cnidarians also have \\"type 1\\" paracaspases. \\"Type 1\\" Species key: Hs= Human, Gg = Chicken, Xt = African clawed frog, Dr = Zebrafish, Cm = Elephant Shark, Pm = Lamprey, Bf = Lancelet, Sk = Acorn worm, Cg = Pacific oyster, Ob = Octopus, Dp = Daphnia, Am = Honey bee, Ce = nematode, Nv = Nematostella, Hv = Hydra. The \\"type 1\\" paracaspases are characterized by a MALT1-like domain composition with a death domain, immunoglobulin-like domains and a caspase-like domain. The \\"type 1\\" paracaspases first originated sometime before the last common ancestor of the bilaterans and cnidaria, indicating that \\"type 1\\" paracaspases originated during the ediacaran period. The jawed vertebrates (starting from sharks) have 3 paralogs: PCASP1, PCASP2 and PCASP3. PCASP3 is the ancestral copy and can be found in all deuterostomes, like sea urchin, lancelets, tunicates and lampreys (a non-jawed vertebrate). Notably, mammals have lost PCASP2 and PCASP3 and only have PCASP1 (MALT1). The non-deuterostome invertebrate type 1 paracaspase closest related to PCASP3 can surprisingly be found in molluscs, which could indicate that there were 2 paralog type 1 paracaspases present in the first bilaterans (like in cnidarians), and that different bilateran lineages have kept one or the other paralog. Known functions =Amoebas= The paracaspase in Dictyostelium seems to regulate osmotic stress tolerance by vacuolar expansion. =Animals= Paracaspase in animals has mostly been studied in humans and mice (see: MALT1), where it plays a major role in several pro-inflammatory pathways in innate- and adaptive- immunity. The distantly related zebrafish PCASP3 show conserved MALT1-like activity in NF- kappaB activation and protease substrate specificity, indicating that these functions were present in the last common ancestor of the three vertebrate paracaspase paralogs.

Structure and Phylogenetic distribution =Prokaryotes= In archea and bacteria, there are several metacaspases with a wide range of domain organizations. Based on the prokaryote metacaspase diversity, paracaspases and orthocaspases can be considered sub-classes among the metacaspases.

Type I Type I metacaspases are characterized by an amino-terminal proline or glutamine rich LSD zinc finger-like domain. This class can almost exclusively be found in plants, with one recent exception where both type I and type II metacaspases were found in the genome of Monosiga brevicollis (Choanoflagellate), possibly as a result of an unusual horizontal gene transfer between two eukaryotes. Type II Type II has a wider phylogenetic distribution among all eukaryotes except those where paracaspases have been found (animals and slime mold). This group is characterized by lacking an amino-terminal domain. Known functions In an analogous manner to caspases, metacaspases induce programmed cell death in both plants and fungi (yeast).

More specifically, ADs install, maintain, and service various aircraft engine types as well as various accessories, gear boxes, related fuel systems, and lubrication systems; determine reasons for engine degradation using various test equipment; perform propeller repairs; handle and service aircraft ashore or aboard ship; and can also serve as aircrewman in various types of aircraft.AD – Aviation Machinist’s Mate, U.S. Navy, last accessed 31 March 2018 History In the early stages of Naval Aviation, this occupation was performed by Machinist's Mates with an aviation specialty, but qualifying for the aviation specialty required meeting the standards for the general rating as well as those required for the aviation specialty. The Aviation Machinist's Mate rating was established on July 1, 1921, along with Aviation Metalsmith, Aviation Carpenter's Mate, and Aviation Rigger. These were the first ratings used specifically for aviation and based solely on aviation requirements. Aviation Machinist's Mate is the only one of the four that is still in use today, making it the oldest U.S. Naval Aviation Rating still in service. In April, 1948, the rating's abbreviation was changed from AMM to AD, but the insignia has not changed since 1921. Aviation Machinist’s Mate functional areas * General power plant maintenance * Engine component inspection and maintenance * Electro/Mechanical maintenance * Engine linkage maintenance * Auxiliary power * Helicopter maintenance * General maintenance * Aviation support * Corrosion control * Hazardous material control and handling * Maintenance administration * Aircraft fuel systems maintenance * Propeller systems ADs may be assigned to sea or shore duty any place in the world, so their working environment varies considerably. They may work in hangars or hangar decks, outside on flight decks or flight lines at air stations. About 6,100 men and women work in this rating. Sailors in this rating are required to express themselves clearly in speech and writing, must have no speech impediment, and must pass hearing and color perception tests. ADs must have good memories and the ability to do repetitive tasks, perform detailed work, and keep accurate records. Advanced technical and operational training is available in this U.S. Navy rating during later stages of an AD's career development.

She joined that community in 1817 at the age 29. During a time of revival known as the Era of Manifestations, she produced several drawings known as \\"gift drawings\\" - artistic works made through religious inspiration. Her works have become iconic of Shaker religious expression. She died in 1864 and was buried in the cemetery of the Hancock Church Family. Background Cohoon became a member of the Hancock Shaker Village and made \\"gift drawings\\" that recounted spiritual visitations received during the Era of Manifestations encountered by Shakers in the mid 19th century. Uncommonly for Shaker gift drawings, she signed her drawings, so that the works have been attributed to her. Cohoon had a unique style that was more abstract, simple and personal. She used impasto techniques to create texture within the drawings. Early life Hannah Harrison was one of three girls born to Noah B. Harrison (1759–1789) and Huldah Bacon Harrison (1763–1809). She was born in Williamstown, Massachusetts on February 1, 1788. Noah Harrison had been an 18-year-old drummer boy during the Revolutionary War in June and July 1777. In 1780 he was a private for a Berkshire, Massachusetts company during the war. He died the year after Hannah was born.June Sprigg. Shaker Design.

Massachusetts Vital and Town Records. Provo, UT: Holbrook Research Institute (Jay and Delene Holbrook). Note: Lois was born March 18, 1784, Polly on November 16, 1785, and Hannah on February 1, 1788. Hannah had a son named Harrison and a daughter named Mariah. She became a member of the Hancock Shaker community on March 15, 1817 when she was 29, Harrison was 5 and Mariah was 3 years of age. She signed the covenant there in 1823. In 1843 she signed the Sacred Roll. Her surname for the works of art in the mid 1800s was Cohoon. Works =Background= A period called the Era of Manifestations between 1837 and the 1850s represented a major spiritual shift within the Shaker community where \\"believers\\" regularly received spiritual visions which were revealed in song, drawings and dances. The people who received the visions were called \\"instruments\\". The profound experience resulted in Shakers expressing the \\"gifts\\" received from Spirit in drawings, messages and songs. Of about 200 surviving gift drawings, most were made by women who lived in Hancock Shaker Village, Massachusetts or Lebanon, New York. One example is Gift Drawing: A Reward of True Faithfulness from Mother Lucy to Eleanor Potter by Polly Ann (Jane) Reed (1818-1881).Gift Drawing: A Reward of True Faithfulness from Mother Lucy to Eleanor Potter. American Folk Art Museum. Retrieved March 22, 2014. Called \\"gift drawings\\", the works were based upon wondrous messages that they received during Spiritual visitations.Stephen J. Paterwic.

Generally, works would not be signed by the artist.Stuart Bailey; Peter Bilak. Dot Dot Dot 13. Princeton Architectural Press; 19 April 2007. . p. 170. Key artists from the Shaker community were Cohoon, Polly Collins and Joseph Wicker. The Era of Manifestations ended when Shaker community members became embarrassed by the \\"emotional excesses and mystical expressions of this period.\\" =Known works= Cohoon began creating her drawings and art in the year of 1845. She adopted a unique approach for her drawings as compared to other Shaker works. She used thick paint in primary or secondary colors that created an impasto texture, using bold, expressive brushstrokes. Her compositions were dedicated to a single object or scene with geometric patterns. Rather than messages intended for others, she wrote directly of visionary experiences, and she signed her works. Cohoon is primarily known for her spirit drawings with trees: * The Tree of Life or Blazing Tree, 1845 * The Tree of Life, 1854 * A Bower of Mulberry Trees, 1854 was made as a result of Cohoon's vision of a feast of cakes by Shaker elders under mulberry trees. The depiction of the long table in the drawing represents holy feasts held in biennial meetings and the presence of the doves overhead represents the bounties that the believer would experience in heaven.Sally M. Promey. Spiritual Spectacles: Vision and Image in Mid-Nineteenth-Century Shakerism. Indiana University Press; 22 March 1993. . p. 86. Germaine Greer, author of The Obstacle Race: The Fortunes of Women Painters and Their Work, likened Cohoon's drawing to primitive art by Catholic artists of \\"an earthly paradise with trees in flower and fruit. A \\"leading figure in the era of spirit manifestations\\", Joseph Wicker (1789–1852), an elder in the Shaker community, created a gift drawing of a tree in 1844 which may have been inspiration of Hannah's pictures of trees. Cohoon described how the vision came to her to create the Tree of Life drawing: The tree of life has become an icon to represent Shakers.Sally M. Promey.

In 1975 it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, and is now a historic house museum, offering tours to the public.  History  In 1848, as a 12-year-old boy, Frederick Pabst immigrated with his family from Thuringia, Germany to Milwaukee. Frederick joined the Goodrich Line steamships, working his way up from cabin boy on ships sailing Lake Michigan, eventually to captain in 1857. In 1862 the young steamship captain married Maria Best, whose father owned Best and Company, one of the largest breweries in Milwaukee. In 1864 Pabst joined the family business and within a few years was leading it. By 1874 Best & Co. was the largest brewery in the U.S., and in 1889 was renamed the Pabst Brewing Company. Around 1890 Captain Pabst commissioned Milwaukee architect George Bowman Ferry to design a mansion in the Flemish Renaissance Revival style. With On June 27, 1890, a building permit was issued for the construction of the home that would take two years to build. Ferry had designed a three-story house, dignified, with a pressed brick exterior, corner quoins, decorated with carved stone and terra cotta ornament. Hallmarks of the Flemish Renaissance Revival style are the symmetry and the shaped parapets that front the gable ends. Inside was originally a men's parlor decorated in mahogany on one side and a ladies' parlor on the other, decorated in white enamel. The Pabst family lived at the mansion from 1892 until 1908, when the Archdiocese of Milwaukee purchased the mansion. The archdiocese moved the Baroque-styled conservatory to the east side of the Pabst house, using it as the archbishop's chapel. For the next 67 years, five Archbishops as well as many priests and sisters lived at the Pabst mansion. In 1975 the Archdiocese put the mansion up for sale, with the hope that a historic preservation group would purchase it and restore it to its former glory. In 1978, Wisconsin Heritages, Inc., purchased the mansion, opening it to the public in May of that year. Until the purchase, the mansion had been slated to be demolished to make way for a parking structure. In 1998, Wisconsin Heritages, Inc., was renamed Captain Frederick Pabst Mansion, Inc. The mansion is open to the public, with daily tours. The mansion was the set for a series of 1980 Boston Store holiday commercials.http://midlandvideo.com/blog/?p=556 The mansion was also briefly pictured during season 4 of the television sitcom How I Met Your Mother as the childhood home of the character Robin Scherbatsky in the 2008 episode \\"Happily Ever After\\". =Historic preservation= The first restored room of the Pabst Mansion was the main Dining Room. The ceiling, cove, walls, and paintings above the doors were all painted white by the archdiocese. In order to find the original paint color, restorers took down three large mirrors on the eastern wall that had hung there since the Captain's residence. The archdiocese had painted around the mirrors, but not underneath. A perfect color palette was preserved from which the restorers used to repaint the other walls. Recent historic preservation efforts are focusing on the Master Suite. In February and March 2011 paint analysis was performed on the ceilings of the Master Bedroom and Sitting Room. Found under layers of paint were palm fronds painted directly onto the ceiling in the four corners of the Sitting Room. Experts used pictures taken around 1900 to find the location of items painted on the ceiling that otherwise would have been lost. The most recent restoration work in Emma's Room/the Regency Room is almost completed.

They are responsible for the maintenance of guns, bombs, torpedoes, rockets, and missiles. Their duties include the stowing, issuing, and loading of munitions and small arms. There are three different types of ordnanceman; \\"O\\" (organizational) level, \\"I\\" (intermediate) level, and \\"D\\" (depot) level. O-level ordnanceman are attached to squadrons ashore and afloat. They perform loading/downloading operations on aircraft. I-level perform maintenance on bomb racks, missile launchers, and all other aircraft armament components. As well as store, inventory, issue, and assemble all ordnance. Aviation ordnanceman \\"A\\" School is currently held at Pensacola Naval Air Station, in Florida, by the Naval Air Technical Training Center. Aviation ordnanceman training is approximately 5 weeks long. At aviation ordnanceman \\"A\\" School, subjects are taught basic aviation theory and skills, along with electronic troubleshooting. To become an aviation ordnanceman, one must have color perception and 20/20 vision or have their vision correctable to 20/20. One must also have an ASVAB score of VE+AR+MK+AS=185 or MK+AS+AO=140.

They perform such tasks as preventive maintenance, testing of bomb racks, missile launchers, rocket launchers, handling equipment, loading equipment, aircraft guns for issue to squadrons, and perform any repairs needed. Depot \\"D\\" level is for equipment that needs to be completely overhauled and is beyond the capabilities of \\"I\\" level maintenance. In a 20-year period, an average aviation ordnanceman spends about 60 percent assigned to fleet units and 40 percent to shore stations. Aviation Ordnancemen are a close-knit community and one of the few ratings in the U.S. Navy to have their own association, the Association of Aviation Ordnancemen. In addition, aviation ordnanceman had come up with an acronym \\"IYAOYAS\\" meaning, \\"If you ain't ordnance, you ain't shit.\\" One of the most notable aviation ordnancemen was Lieutenant John William Finn, who came up as an enlisted sailor making it to the rank of chief petty officer. He was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.

With the changed rules, being a good athlete is no longer enough to guarantee a win in any of the competitions in the Olympic Games, and actors become the new Olympic champions.

It was previously designated as aviation anti-submarine warfare operator. However, under the CNO-directed \\"Helicopter Master Plan\\", all 78XX and 94XX aircrewmen were re- designated as \\"aviation warfare systems operators\\". The description of the Naval Aircrew Rate (AW) on this page define only the \\"Active Duty\\" aspects of the AW rate, fleets (aircraft), positions, and duties that are manned by aircrew in today's Navy. The Full Time Support (FTS) and Selected Reserves (SELRES) components of the U.S. Naval Reserves make up the largest number of Aircrew in today's Navy. Many technologically advanced navies have a similar trade. Naval aircrew wings, typically earned by AWs upon completion of on-the- job training. Training All AWs must attain a minimum amount of education and training in several fields of science, technology, and aviation at several different schools. The educational \\"pipeline\\" averages 18 months to 2 years in length. The following list describes most of those schools: =Schools= Naval Aircrew Candidate School (NACCS) Naval Aircrew Candidate School (NACCS), at NAS Pensacola, Florida, trains and evaluates AW students in basic flight physiology and water survival. The course includes low-pressure hypobaric chamber training, night-vision evaluations, multi-station spatial- disorientation device (also known as the \\"spin and puke\\") training, and aircraft-emergency-water-egress device. The curriculum also includes advanced first aid and CPR and physical training with road runs up to 2–4 miles and one-mile swims. AW “A” School Naval Air Technical Training Center (NATTC) provides accession students a basic introduction to the fundamentals the student must be well versed in to operate on their prospective platform. Active and passive electronic warfare, active and passive sonar. Reading sonograms, magnetic anomaly detection equipment, physics, wave propagation, oceanography, meteorology and working with classified information are included in this phase of training. Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) The Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) course is designed to provide Level \\"C\\" Code of Conduct training to pilots, flight officers, intelligence officers, aircrew, and other designated high-risk-of- capture personnel, as directed by respective TYCOMs/MCCDC in accordance with DOD Instruction 1300.21 and the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency (JPRA) executive agent instruction. Training encompasses those basic skills necessary for worldwide survival, facilitating search-and-rescue efforts, evading capture by hostile forces, resistance to interrogation, exploitation, and indoctrination, and escape from detention by enemy forces, in accordance with DOD Instruction 1300.21. It is based on and reinforces the values expressed in the code of conduct while maintaining an appropriate balance of sound educational methodology and realistic/stressful training scenarios. Participation in SERE training requires certification of a current physical examination (within 1 year for aircrew) and completion of a medical-screening form within 14 days of training by competent medical authority (i.e., flight surgeon, IDC). If students report for training without medical and dental records, they are dis-enrolled from the course. Because SERE training is physically demanding, students must comply with their own service's body fat standards and have successfully passed their most recent physical-readiness test. Fleet Replacement Aircrew Training (FRAC) This phase of training immerses the student much further into training for their specific platform and specialty. Typically, the student will report to an East Coast or West Coast Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS) to conduct training. Naval Air Training and Operating Procedures Standardization (NATOPS) and tactics are also introduced. After completion of training and reporting for duty in the fleet, they are required to complete “on the job training” lasting around six months before being recognized as fully qualified. Position summaries There are several platforms (fixed wing P-3 Orion and rotary wing SH-60 Seahawk aircraft, aircraft carriers, etc.) specialties and special certifications available within the rating. Additional training can be acquired to qualify rotary wing AWs as combat search and rescue swimmers. Below is a list of specialties within the rating. =Aviation Rescue Swimmer (AIRR)= AIRR getting ready to splash (abbreviated as AWS/AWR) These Aircrewmen have successfully completed Rescue Swimmer School (RSS) along with the multiple schools in the training pipeline. According to multiple sources, the average pipeline graduation rate is 22%. Sailors who choose this career path need to possess above-average maturity and the ability to stay calm in high-stress situations. AIRR's are trained in basic emergency medicine, rappelling, and various other skills other AW's will not receive. They share many similarities to Coast Guard Aviation Survival Technicians. They are often utilized in humanitarian, combat, and peacetime missions. On average, with both the pipeline and required on-the-job training, it takes about two years to become a qualified AIRR. The Training Pipeline is as follows: AIRR performing a mountain rescue # Aircrew Candidate School (3 weeks) # Rescue Swimmer School (5 weeks) # \\"A\\" School (7 weeks for AWS, 14 weeks for AWR) # S.E.R.E. (2 weeks) # Fleet Replacement Squadrons (6-12 months at assigned Air Station) =AIRR Tactical Helicopter= (abbreviated as AWR) AWRs go through NACCS and Rescue Swimmer Schools as well, then split off into their own pipeline from there. Going to A-School (13 weeks), FRAC(about 1 year long), SERE (2 weeks). AWRs perform the same jobs as regular AIRR crewman (AWS) as well as locating submarines using acoustics sensors, which has earned them the nickname \\"Subhunters\\". They also perform various Surface Warfare missions using Radar and other sensors on board the aircraft. =C-2A Loadmaster= These AWFs fly on the C-2A Greyhound, a carrier-based fixed-wing aircraft. They fly high priority passengers, cargo, and mail to and from aircraft carriers. Their designations as loadmasters start from FRAC school at VAW-120 in Norfolk, Virginia where they become transport second crewman. From there these AWs complete on the job training, their NAWS package, and a second crewman board to become carrier transport second crewman. And then finally completing more job specific qualifications to become a carrier transport crew chief. These AWF's are also highly skilled and qualified in the maintenance program and work hand in hand with their maintenance work centers to better improve their knowledge of the aircraft. An AW performs maintenance on a .50-caliber crew- served weapon aboard the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower =Naval Aircrewman (operator)= ; Aboard aircraft :Note: abbreviated as AWO, SS1, & SS2 These AWs fly in a fixed wing, long range patrol aircraft. Currently the P-3 Orion is fulfilling this role, with the P-8 Poseidon planned to take over this mission starting in 2013. Acoustic sensor operators begin their career in the fleet after attending specialized training. They start as sensor operator 2, and after sufficient flight and related experience is acquired, advance to sensor operator 1 with their own crew. The job can be related to the civilian fields of machine condition monitoring, or predictive maintenance. The AW is responsible for the analysis of all sensor data and must interpret this data in order to search for, localize and track, determine spatial orientation and vector, identify, assess condition of, establish attack parameters on a single, or multiple surface or subsurface contacts. These systems include but are not limited to passive sonar used to listen to underwater sounds, active sonar systems which can be used to pinpoint targets. They control the type and settings for the sonobuoys, underwater communication equipment for platform to platform communication, sensor system to fire control system data transfer and recording. ; Aboard aircraft :Note: abbreviated as AWO, SS3 Aviation warfare systems operators monitor the acoustic station during the flight of a P-3C Orion Non-acoustic AWs, also known as \\"sensor 3s\\" or electronic warfare operators, (EWO's), currently fly in P-3 Orion aircraft, they will be transitioning to the P-8A Poseidon beginning in 2013. Non-acoustic AWs are responsible for operating the radar, electronic support measures system, electro-optical/infrared imaging devices and magnetic anomaly detection device aboard variants of the P-3 Orion. They acquire data necessary to identify surface or air contacts, and can also provide data to help search, localize, and track contacts of interest. SS3s aid in establishing attack parameters on a single, or multiple surface contact. Non-acoustic operators also work with the flight station and navigator to ensure safety-of-flight conditions are maintained. ; Aboard ship or on land :Note: abbreviated as ASWMOD/ASWOC These AWs brief and debrief aircrews, filter through, organize, and relay intelligence collected during the mission in an aircraft carrier ASW module (ASMOD) or in a land-based ASW operations center (ASWOC). They coordinate ASW information-gathering throughout the battle group, operate various under-sea warfare and non-under-sea warfare related sensor systems to extract, analyze and classify data obtained; perform specified pre-flight, in-flight and post- flight operations in a multitude of naval aircraft serving anti-surface, USW, mine countermeasures, electronic, counter-narcotics, and land and sea rescue missions performance; operate tactical support center systems to analyze and classify USW and non-USW data; assist in aircrew briefing and debriefing; and provide data base information to the tactical commander for use in prescribing mission objectives and tactics. =Previous platforms= Past AW-crewed aircraft include aircraft carrier-based S-3 Viking and S-2 Tracker aircraft. They also flew in SH-3 Sea King and SH-2 Seasprite helicopters and P-2 Neptune patrol aircraft. Roots of the rating The \\"naval aircrewman\\" rating was originally called the \\"Aviation Antisubmarine Warfare Operator\\" rating (AW) and was established on 1 Sep 1968 by BuPers Note 1440 of 29 Feb 1968 and was redesignated Aviation Warfare Systems Operator by BuPers Note 1440 of 16 Nov 1993, without change of abbreviation. NavAdmin 092/05 of 2 May 2005 directed the consolidation of Enlisted Naval Aircrew (NAC) ratings into Naval Aircrewman (AW) with five subspecialities and eliminated the Aviation Warfare Systems Operator designation.

Among the victims were women and children. The Yugoslav Army had been deployed in the area for several months in a major offensive against the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), which had assumed loose control of an estimated one-third of the province. There was serious combat in the areas of Suva Reka and Drenica. At least 14 policemen had been killed by the KLA earlier that month. On 25 September, a Serbian police vehicle was blown up by a detonation on the road between Likovac and Gornje Obrinje, with five dead. The KLA sometimes retreated through villages after their frequent attacks on Serbian police, moving in proximity to civilians. According to HRW, the Serbian special police retaliated by killing 21 civilians, belonging to the family of Deliaj from Donje Obrinje, on 26 September. Among these were 9 women and 5 children. They had been executed in a nearby forest. Later that same day, 14 men were randomly selected some kilometres from Gornje Obrinje, abused for several hours, then eventually 13 were executed in Golubovac. On 27 September HRW researchers and journalists arrived at the village and documented the massacre, garnering major Western media coverage. International political pressure on the FR Yugoslav government to end its crackdown in Kosovo was accelerated by the news of these killings, leading to a new resolution issued by the United Nations Security Council on 24 October 1998, calling for the deployment of the Diplomatic Verification Mission and an end to hostilities.

He was the Charles F. Grey Distinguished Service Professor of anthropology, linguistics, and psychology at the University of Chicago. He was a theoretician of semiotics and linguistic anthropology. Over the course of his career he created an original synthesis of research on the semiotics of communication, the sociology of interaction, Russian formalist literary theory, linguistic pragmatics, sociolinguistics, early anthropological linguistics and structuralist grammatical theory, together with his own theoretical contributions, yielding a comprehensive account of the semiotics of human communication and its relation to culture. He presented the developing results of this project annually from 1970 until his death in a course entitled \\"Language in Culture.\\" Among other achievements, he was instrumental in introducing the semiotic terminology of Charles Sanders Peirce, including especially the notion of indexicality, into the linguistic and anthropological literature; with coining the terms metapragmatics and metasemanticsJonathan Yovel and Elizabeth E.

In 1982 he was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in the second year of the prize's existence, and was the youngest person, at the time, to be awarded the grant. He was also a Junior Fellow of the Harvard Society of Fellows, in Anthropology. He was a prime influence in defining 'language ideologies' as a field of study. Language ideologies are socially grounded beliefs and conceptualisations of language, its functions and its users.Jonathan Yovel and Elizabeth E. Mertz. \\"Metalinguistic Awareness\\" HANDBOOK OF PRAGMATICS HIGHLIGHTS. Ed. an-Ola Östman, Jef Verschueren, Jan Blommaert, Chris Bulcaen,. 2010. p. 262 Based on work of Benjamin Lee Whorf and Charles Sanders Peirce, and incorporating insights from structuralism, philology, history and social theory, he saw 'language ideologies' as patterns that guide speakers' use of language and so, eventually, change that language. We talk on the basis of what we believe we can do with and in language, and by doing that we shape our language. Thus, language ideologies form the bridge between language patterns and social and cultural structure, as the socially grounded beliefs in what language is and does convert into particular patterns of use that are understandable, precisely because they fit these beliefs and the expectations they generate. The connections between usage and beliefs are empirically identifiable as 'metapragmatics' - the articulation of beliefs about language use in language use (as when we use polite formulae in addressing someone in a superior position).Woolard, Kathryn A. 1998. Introduction: Language Ideology as A Field of Inquiry. in Language Ideology: Practice and Theory. Schiffelin, Bambi B., Kathryn Woolard and Paul V. Kroskrity (eds.) Oxford University Press. Silverstein's work caused a theoretical and conceptual shift in anthropology, linguistics and sociolinguistics. It led to a renewed interest in the study of linguistic relativity. It also added another perspective of critique of 'Chomskyan' conceptions of language and it has boosted a critical and politically sensitive trend in the study of language in society, influencing notably the study of language policy, language planning, and language in education.

According to Rudolf Höss, Fritzsch first suggested using poisonous gas Zyklon B for the purpose of mass murder.  Background  Karl Fritzsch was born in Bohemia into the family of a stove builder. His father moved constantly on work assignments, and therefore Fritzsch never received formal education. For some years he worked as a labourer on river ships along the River Danube. His marriage in 1928 to Franziska Stich produced three children, but ended in divorce in 1942. Fritzsch joined the Nazi Party and the SS (NSDAP # 261135 SS # 7287) in 1930 at the age of 27. He became a career SS man. Almost as soon as it opened, he acquired a position at the Dachau concentration camp in 1934. Due to his camp experience, several months after the German invasion of Poland, in May 1940 he became deputy to Rudolf Höss and the head of the economic operation of Auschwitz (Schutzhaftlagerführer). Fritzsch quickly obtained a reputation as the Auschwitz horror. He used to select prisoners to die of starvation in reprisal for the escape attempts among prisoners. Together with Höss, he was responsible for the torture death of victims locked inside standing cells in the basement of the Bunker, i.e. the Block 11 or 13 prison until they died. On 29 July 1941, a camp count found that three prisoners were missing and Fritzsch sentenced 10 remaining prisoners to immurement. One of the condemned, Franciszek Gajowniczek, was reprieved when a fellow prisoner, the Franciscan priest Maximilian Kolbe, offered to take his place. After over 2 weeks starvation, only Kolbe remained alive and the priest was killed in the underground bunker by lethal injection. Kolbe was later canonized by Pope John Paul II. Fritzsch was also fond of psychological torture. Former Auschwitz prisoner Karol Świętorzecki recalled the first Christmas Eve behind the camp barbed wire, on 24 December 1940, was also one of the most tragic. \\"The Nazis set up a Christmas tree, with electric lights, on the roll-call square. Beneath it, they placed the bodies of prisoners who had died while working or frozen to death at roll call. Lagerführer Karl Fritzsch referred to the corpses beneath the tree as “a present” for the living, and forbade the singing of Polish Christmas carols.\\" Empty poison gas canisters found by the Soviet Army in Auschwitz-Birkenau at the end of World War II According to testimony of his superior Rudolf Höss, it was also Fritzsch who first came up with the idea of using poison gas Zyklon B for the purpose of mass murder. Fritzsch ordered the killing of Soviet POWs locked in cells in the basement of the Bunker while Höss went away on an official trip in late August 1941. Fritzsch tried out the effect of Zyklon B inside cells which were not air- tight, subjecting the victims to even more torturous death. Fritzsch repeated the test-killing of additional victims using Zyklon B soon thereafter in the presence of Höss. According to Höss the preferred method for the mass murders in Auschwitz using Zyklon B was devised on site. On 15 January 1942, Fritzsch was transferred to KZ Flossenbürg as Schutzhaftlagerführer. From early August until October 1942 he was temporary substitute commander of the camp. In October 1943, he was arrested as a part of an internal SS investigation into corruption. An SS court charged him with murder. As a punishment he was transferred to front line duty (SS-Panzergrenadier-Ersatzbatallion 18). It is assumed that he fell during the battle of Berlin in May 1945.  Disappearance  It is commonly believed that Fritzsch perished in the Battle for Berlin but his final fate remained long unknown. Soviet sources claimed that MI-6 caught him in Norway. In his 2007 memoirs, For He Is an Englishman, Memoirs of a Prussian Nobleman, Captain Charles Arnold-Baker recorded that as an MI6 officer in Oslo he arrested Fritzsch: \\"We picked up, for example, the deputy commandant of Auschwitz, a little runt of a man called Fritzsch whom we naturally put in the custody of a Jewish guard – with strict instructions not to damage him, of course.\\" On 4 May 2015 Dutch journalist published an article on his investigation of Fritzsch's disappearance. In it he cites a report from 1966 by the Central Office of the State Justice Administrations for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes in which Berlin inhabitant Gertrud Berendes claims that Fritzsch had shot himself on 2 May 1945 in the basement of a house at Sächsische Strasse 42 in Berlin. She mentioned that her father and a neighbour had buried Fritzsch in the Preussenpark and she had sent his personal belongings to his wife. In a separate report from 1966 by the Kriminalpolizei Regensburg, Fritzsch's wife states that she had no reason to doubt her husband's death and that she had received his wedding ring and personal letters. However, Duk's book \\"De Beul en de Heilige\\" on Fritzsch that was supposed to be launched first at the end of 2015 and then in 2016 at publisher Prometheus, was postponed indefinitely and has since been removed from the publishers' list of forthcoming books.

Laziness is a remote question for him. Once he opts to undertake a job he cannot turn back till that job is completed. Even in the case of utter failure he is not desperate. If he is employed he will reach to the top. In most of the cases it has been noticed that even if this Nakshatra born persons are employed initially in the lower or middle level positions, they later on reach to a good position and they always receive reward and praise from others.

His children also will be an asset, most obedient, understanding and respecting children. He will be blessed with grandchildren also. He is an ornament in his family.

It is listed as \\"Vulnerable\\" by the IUCN and the New Zealand subspecies is \\"Critically Endangered\\". There are three subspecies: * Australian fairy tern, Sternula nereis nereis (Gould, 1843) – breeds in Australia * New Caledonian fairy tern, Sternula nereis exsul (Mathews, 1912) – breeds in New Caledonia * New Zealand fairy tern, Sternula nereis davisae (Mathews & Iredale, 1913) – breeds in northern New Zealand Description The fairy tern is a small tern with a white body and light bluish-grey wings. The crown and nape is black. It can be distinguished from the little tern in that a black band extends no further than the eye and not as far as the bill. In the breeding plumage both the beak and the legs are yellowish-orange. During the rest of the year the black crown is lost, being mostly replaced by white feathers, and the beak becomes black at the tip and the base. The sexes look alike and the plumage of immature birds is similar to the non-breeding plumage. The total length of the fairy tern is about . Behaviour The fairy tern mainly feeds on fish which it catches by hovering over the sea before plunging beak first into the water to grab its prey. It seldom goes far out to sea but is often to be seen where predatory fish are feeding on shoals of small fish. It also consumes crustaceans, molluscs and some plant material. Breeding takes place in the spring in colonies on sheltered beaches on the mainland or on offshore islands. The nest is just above high-water mark and is a scrape in the sand. One or two eggs are laid and both parents share the incubation and care of the chicks and have occasionally been seen providing post-fledging parental care. Status Formerly classified as a Species of Least Concern by the IUCN, recent research shows that its numbers have been decreasing rapidly throughout its range; the New Zealand subspecies has been on the brink of extinction for decades. The fairy tern was consequently uplisted to Vulnerable status in 2008. The New Zealand fairy tern has numerous breeding areas, largely incorporating the upper-north region of the North Island. In 2011, there were only about 42 known individuals. With a breeding program in place by the New Zealand Department of Conservation, the population was estimated in 2018 at 43.https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/364728/rarest-bird-in-the-country- gets-a-helping-hand References * Douglas Adams & Mark Carwardine, Last Chance to See (Ballantine Books, 1992, ) External links * BirdLife Species Factsheet fairy tern Category:Birds of New Caledonia Category:Birds of South Australia Category:Birds of Tasmania Category:Birds of Victoria (Australia) Category:Birds of Western Australia fairy tern fairy tern ","title":"Fairy tern"},{"id":"8868277","text":"A culinary specialist buttering loaves of bread aboard the aircraft carrier Culinary specialist (abbreviated CS) is a United States Navy occupational rating. It was formerly the mess management specialist (MS) rating until January 15, 2004, and commissaryman (CS) and steward (SD) prior to 1975. History Food service ratings in the U.S. Navy were historically divided into two broad groupings until the merger of commissaryman and steward ratings to mess management specialist on January 1, 1975. Before 1975, stewards prepared and served meals to the officers, maintained their quarters and took care of their uniforms. They served officers in the flag mess for admirals, the cabin mess for the ship's captain and the wardroom mess for all other officers. Until the merger, the steward rating, and its predecessor ratings were largely segregated. Sailors of African, Filipino and Asian descent largely performed these functions. Commissarymen prepared meals for enlisted sailors in galleys on the ship and shore bases in the general mess. They purchased food from approved sources, stored food stuffs and distributed to the galleys for preparation and kept accountability records. With the consolidation, sailors in new rating became “responsible for food preparation and food service for both enlisted and officer messes.” To accommodate the change, officers were now required to assume some of the upkeep of their staterooms and personal uniforms. Other cleaning duties became the responsibility of rotational pool of enlisted personnel from the ship. This arrangement continues with the current culinary specialist rating. Duties Culinary specialists operate and manage U.S. Navy messes and living quarters in addition to many other duties as follows: * Estimate quantities and kinds of foodstuffs required. * Assist supply officers in ordering and storage of subsistence items and procurement of equipment and mess gear. * Check delivery for quantity and assist medical personnel in inspection for quality. * Prepare menus and plan, prepare, and serve meals. * Maintain food service spaces and associated equipment in a clean and sanitary condition, including storerooms and refrigerated spaces. * Maintain records of financial transactions and submit required reports. * Maintain, oversee, and manage quarters afloat and ashore.

Fire controlmen provide system employment recommendations; perform organizational and intermediate maintenance on digital computer equipment, subsystems, and systems; operate and maintain combat and weapons direction systems, surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missile systems, and gun fire control systems at the organizational and intermediate level; inspect, test, align, and repair micro/minicomputers and associated peripheral equipment, data conversion units, data display equipment, data link terminal equipment, print devices, and system related equipment; make analysis for detailed systems, computer programs, electronics, and electronic casualty control; and operate associated built-in and external test equipment; load, initialize, and run preprogrammed diagnostic, performance and testing routines for digital computer equipment, digital subsystems, digital systems, and overall combat systems. Fire controlmen attend apprentice technical training and \\"A\\"-School at Naval Station Great Lakes; this course is roughly 8 months long followed then by a \\"C\\"-school, based on one of the systems described below, which vary in length from 4 months to 8 months. FCs typically operate weapon systems on- board surface combatant ships. They are trained in the repair, maintenance, operation and employment of weapons such as the Tomahawk missile system, the close-in weapons system, the 5\\"/54 caliber Mark 45 gun weapon system and its associated MK86 or MK160 gun fire control system, the MK92 gun fire control system (on frigates) the Sea Sparrow missile system, and the Harpoon missile systems. These include their associated computer and sensor packages. Their job is somewhat unusual in that they are trained to troubleshoot and repair their systems, as well as operate them. These responsibilities are typically split up between different ratings for various types of electronic equipment. In essence, they operate the weapons sensors and tracking devices, from first detection through firing the weapons, to defend the ship against tactical threats or to make offensive strikes against hostile targets. Another area of responsibility for FCs is the Aegis weapon system, which includes one of the most powerful air-search sea-based radars, the SPY-1, as well the MK99 fire control system, used for terminal guidance of Standard missiles, and the Aegis computer suite. History Fire Controlman 2nd Class Anthony Ferretti performs maintenance on a close-in weapon system for a live-fire exercise aboard the guided-missile destroyer According to the official history documented by the U.S. Navy, the fire controlman rating was established in 1941, when it was split off from the gunner's mate rating. It was actually created much earlier than this, as US Navy Muster Reports account for FCs well before then. It is commonly believed that the rate came into existence at some point in the 1930s. Fire controlmen were highly skilled technicians responsible for the operation of various forms of range finding gear, as well as the solving of ballistics calculations to control the firing of the ship's guns. These skills were employed initially for naval gunfire support and surface combat, but during World War II, their responsibilities expanded into anti-aircraft warfare as well. In 1957, as various electronics such as tracking radars and computers became more widespread, the fire controlman rating was merged into the fire control technician (FT) rating which had been created in 1948, with specific sub-specialties for gunnery (FTG), missiles (FTM), and submarines (FTU). Later, the FTU designation was split into two specific sub-specialties for torpedoes (FTG) and ballistic missiles (FTB). In 1985, the Navy re-established the fire controlman rating to separate those sailors in the surface FTG and FTM sub-specialties from those assigned to submarines, with the latter retaining the fire control technician rating. In 1998, the Navy merged certain sailors from the data systems technician (DS) rating into the fire controlman rating. In 2017, the Navy established a new sub-specialty, Fire Controlman Aegis (FCA) for sailors who operated and maintained aegis equipment, with an advancement exam separate from the general Fire Controlman rating. The fire controlman rating insignia is a coincidence or stereoscopic rangefinder, with two lightning bolts (called \\"sparks\\") signifying the technical skills required. The lightning bolts were introduced when the rate was re-established in 1985. FCs maintain the control systems used in aiming and firing weapons on all equipped ships. Complex computers, electronics, and electrical and hydraulic equipment are required to ensure the accuracy of guided missile, surface, and anti-aircraft fire control systems. FCs are responsible for the operation, routine care, and repair of this equipment, which includes radars, computers, weapons-direction equipment, target-designation systems, gyroscopes, and rangefinders.

The paper was founded just three days after press censorship was abolished. The newspaper is mainly written in German, but includes small sections in both Luxembourgish and French. The paper is part of the Saint-Paul Luxembourg S.A. The paper is owned by the archbishopric and has a strong Catholic leaning. From its very foundation, the newspaper opposed the Volksfreund, founded by Samuel Hirsch, and the Judenrabbiner, as well as the subsidy for the Jewish congregation. In the period from 1849 to 1880, on average it published two anti-Semitic articles per week.Tanja Muller: „Nichts gegen die Juden als solche …“ (PDF; 1,1 MB) Forum für Politik, Gesellschaft und Kultur, No. 312, November 2011. p. 54ff. From 1938, the newspaper opposed Nazi Germany. In 1940, after the German invasion of Luxembourg, the Luxemburger Wort was co-opted as part of the occupation. The director Jean Origer and the editors Batty Esch and Pierre Grégoire were arrested by the Nazis and sent to a concentration camp. Pierre Grégoire was the only one of them to survive imprisonment.Edda Humprecht: Luxemburger Wort für Wahrheit und Recht. Institut für Medien- und Kommunikationspolitik. After the liberation of Luxembourg, the paper produced the headline: Lëtzebuerg as fräi! (\\"Luxembourg is free!\\"). At the same time this was one of few editions that appeared entirely in Luxembourgish; the publishing house also changed its name from German into French as a symbolic act. After André Heiderscheid's replacement as editor-in-chief by Leon Zeches, the latter sought to 'de-ideologise' the newspaper and to distance it more strongly from the Christian Social People's Party. For example, the paper increasingly started to report on initiatives, debates and congresses of other political parties as well.

Life Born to a Greek father and a French mother, he was orphaned in 1944 and had to interrupt his studies and support himself with various jobs. He served in the airborne troops, from 1946 to 1949. From 1950 to 1957, he was employed by Mobil Oil, and was a delegate of the CGT trade union. He took up writing at an early age but did not consider his works fit for publishing until the late 1950s. In 1959, he published his autobiography, Pierrot-la-lune, which was a critical success. He gained notoriety with his 1962 play Lieutenant Tenant, but his later works were commercially unsuccessful. Pierre Gripari kept publishing his books thanks to the support of publisher L'Age d'Homme, but only gained real fame and success in the late 1970s, thanks to the publishing of his children's book Contes de la rue Broca. Until his death, he was more known to French audiences as a children's author. He was also theatre critic for the newspaper Écrits de Paris. A member of the French communist party in the 1950s, Gripari strongly distanced himself from communism after the 1956 Khrushchev report and gradually evolved towards unconventional political ideas which could be considered far right. He was often critical of the political and religious influence of the Jews, and was branded by some critics as anti-Semitic. Gripari was openly gay and often wrote on gay themes, but his work often borders on the surreal and includes several parodies of literary genres. He died at St. Joseph hospital in Paris, following surgery, he was cremated at the cemetery of Pere-Lachaise 4 January 1991.

It is a sea duty-intensive rating in the Navy while the majority of Coast Guard OS's are at ashore Command Centers. Brief history The rating started from the radarman (RD) rating. In the U.S. Coast Guard the Operations specialist rate was formed by combining the radarman (RD) and telecommunications specialist rate (TC). When the radarman rating was split up into OS, electronics technician (ET), and electronic warfare technician (EW) ratings, the original RD rating badge continued to be used by the operations specialist. It symbolizes the radar scope (circle portion of symbol) oscilloscope radar (O-scope) used to determine a targets range from the radar antenna (the two spikes in the line drawn across the scope), and the arrow represents the ability to detect the azimuth or direction of the target. Description Operations specialists at work Operations specialists aboard U.S. Navy combat vessels work in the combat information center (CIC) or combat direction center (CDC), aka: \\"combat\\", the tactical nerve center of the ship. Using a wide variety of assets available to them, Operations Specialists are responsible for the organized collection, processing, display, competent evaluation and rapid dissemination of pertinent tactical combat information to command and control stations, upon which sound tactical decisions may be made. Beginning training (called \\"A\\" school) for operations specialist's was originally located at the Naval Training Center (NTC) in Great Lakes Illinois. In 1979 it was moved to Dam Neck in Virginia Beach, Virginia; the school has since moved back to Training Support Center (TSC) of NAVSTA Great Lakes in Illinois. Intermediate and advanced training are in locations like California, Virginia, and various locations throughout the United States Navy. An RDA school was also located on Treasure Island at San Francisco, Calif. They maintain combat information center displays of strategic and tactical information, including various plotting boards and tables depicting position and movement of submarines, ships and aircraft as well as tote boards containing data relevant to the tactical picture. They operate surveillance, tracking and height-finding radars, identification friend or foe (IFF) equipment, HF, VHF and UHF radios, tactical data link (TADIL-A/Link 11, TADIL-J/Link 16, etc.) systems and displays, and computerized consoles and peripheral equipment that allows them interface with the Aegis combat system. The tactical data links exchange data between other units in the force; i.e., ships, aircraft and other military units such as deployed Army, Air Force, Marine and Coast Guard commands. They operate encrypted and non-encrypted long and short range radio-telephone equipment as well as intra-ship communication systems. With specialized training, they also may serve as combat air controllers for helicopters, anti-submarine patrol aircraft, and jet strike fighter aircraft in anti-submarine tactical air controller (ASTAC), sea combat air controller (SCAC), and air intercept controller (AIC) roles. They also serve as watch supervisors, watch officers, and section leaders underway and in port aboard ship and at commands ashore. Operations specialists assist in shipboard navigation through plotting and monitoring the ship's position using satellite and other electronic navigation resources, as well as fixing the ship's position near landfall using radar imaging. They interpret and evaluate presentations and tactical situations and make recommendations to the commanding officer, CIC watch officer (CICWO), tactical action officer (TAO), officer of the deck (OOD), or any of their commissioned officer surrogates during various watch or combat/general quarters conditions. They apply a thorough knowledge of doctrine and procedures applicable to CIC operations contained in U.S. Navy instructions and allied tactical or U.S. Navy tactical publications. Operations Specialists are responsible for maintaining the physical space of CIC as well as performing minor planned maintenance care of the equipment they operate. A minimum of a secret security clearance is required for this rating, with more senior personnel holding a top secret clearance. Operations specialists provide to their shipboard or shore-based command a wide range of technical information and assistance related to anti-surface warfare, anti-air warfare, anti-submarine warfare, amphibious warfare, mine warfare, naval gunfire support, search and rescue operations, radar and dead reckoning navigation, overt intelligence gathering and transmittal, and other matters pertaining to the operations specialist's area. They also have a working knowledge of protocols and procedures in electronic warfare, though this area is normally covered by its own occupational rating, such as cryptologic technician (CT) aboard ship or ashore, or naval aircrewman (AW) aboard specific naval electronic warfare and reconnaissance aircraft. Duties The duties performed by Navy operations specialists include: *Operate a variety of computer-interfaced detection, tracking and height-finding radars * Plot a ship's position, heading, and speed, using computerized or manual trigonometric methods using a Maneuvering Board (MOE Board) *Maintain a tactical picture of the surrounding seas by plotting and maintaining a visual representation of ships, submarines and aircraft in the area, including friendly, neutral, hostile and civilian contacts *Use secure and non-secure radio in communicating, in plain voice or coded signals, with other air, sea or land units to coordinate tactical and combat evolution's * Operate common marine electronic navigation instruments including radar and satellite systems, plot own ship's position and movement on charts and make recommendations in navigation to the officer of the deck * Provide target plotting data to the command and control based on information received from target tracking devices *Make recommendations to command and control regarding tactical and combat procedures *Assist in the coordination and control of landing craft during amphibious assaults *Communicate with spotters, plot and make calculations to adjust fire during naval gunfire support missions *Coordinate and assist in plotting and ship maneuvers for emergency evolution's such as man overboard and other search and rescue activities *Provide assisted and direct air control of combat aircraft in anti-air, anti- surface and anti-submarine warfare The job of an operations specialist can be very intense and stressful while the ship is underway. Operational tempos go from next to no contacts in the middle of an ocean to dozens, if not more in congested waters. They are required to be able to think quickly, drawing on a large reserve of tactical and procedural knowledge and make calculations on the fly in the fast-paced and information-saturated environment of naval combat operations at sea.

The earliest axenic cultures were of bacteria or unicellular eukaryotes, but axenic cultures of many multicellular organisms are also possible. Axenic culture is an important tool for the study of symbiotic and parasitic organisms in a controlled environment. Preparation Axenic cultures of microorganisms are typically prepared by subculture of an existing mixed culture. This may involve use of a dilution series, in which a culture is successively diluted to the point where subsamples of it contain only a few individual organisms, ideally only a single individual (in the case of an asexual species). These subcultures are allowed to grow until the identity of their constituent organisms can be ascertained. Selection of those cultures consisting solely of the desired organism produces the axenic culture. Subculture selection may also involve manually sampling the target organism from an uncontaminated growth front in an otherwise mixed culture, and using this as an inoculum source for the subculture. Axenic cultures are usually checked routinely to ensure that they remain axenic. One standard approach with microorganisms is to spread a sample of the culture onto an agar plate, and to incubate this for a fixed period of time. The agar should be an enriched medium that will support the growth of common \\"contaminating\\" organisms. Such \\"contaminating\\" organisms will grow on the plate during this period, identifying cultures that are no longer axenic. Experimental use As axenic cultures are derived from very few organisms, or even a single individual, they are useful because the organisms present within them share a relatively narrow gene pool. In the case of an asexual species derived from a single individual, the resulting culture should consist of identical organisms (though processes such as mutation and horizontal gene transfer may introduce a degree of variability). Consequently, they will generally respond in a more uniform and reproducible fashion, simplifying the interpretation of experiments. =Problems= The axenic culture of some pathogens is complicated because they normally thrive within host tissues which exhibit properties that are difficult to replicate in vitro. This is especially true in the case of intracellular pathogens. However, careful replication of key features of the host environment can resolve these difficulties (e.g. host metabolites, dissolved oxygen), such as with the Q fever pathogen, Coxiella burnetii.

He is currently working as goalkeeping coach for Empoli. Playing career Unlike other footballers from Naples which start their career at S.S.C. Napoli, he started his career at the Sicilian club Palermo. He left Palermo to join Parma in summer 2003. He made his debut for Parma replacing Sébastien Frey at half-time against Salzburg on 6 November 2003. He made his Serie A debut in the 0–0 draw against A.C. Milan three days later. He also started the return leg against Salzburg, which Parma won 5–0 at home. After his only Serie A appearance, and two more in the 2003–04 UEFA Cup, Sicignano joined Lecce on loan on 16 January 2004, which became a permanent deal. After Lecce were relegated from Serie A, Sicignano joined ChievoVerona in the summer of 2006. He played 2 out of 2 qualifying matches in the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League, and 1 out of 2 in the 2006–07 UEFA Cup, but later in the season he lost his place in the starting lineup to Lorenzo Squizzi. He played the 2007-08 season with Frosinone, being transferred from Chievo in a loan (exchange with Massimo Zappino) deal. In summer 2008, he was signed outright, but he just played 20 games, being challenged by Pierluigi Frattali for first choice. He became more of a regular in 2009, when he was featured in 33 league games (out of 42). In 2010, he played only 22 games. He left Frosinone in 2011, after the club suffered relegation from Serie B, to join Barletta in the Lega Pro Prima Divisione league. Post-playing and coaching career After retiring in 2012, Sicignano accepted to return at his former club Palermo as goalkeeping coach of the Under-19 Primavera youth team. He was successively promoted to first team goalkeeping coach on June 2015.

Religious program specialists assist naval chaplains in their duties as well as provide support to naval chaplains in developing programs to meet the needs of U.S. Navy sailors, U.S. Marines, and their families. They also act as armed bodyguards for the chaplains (who are largely unarmed). RPs perform functions that do not require ordination and do no pastoral counseling; adherence to a religion is not a requirement or prerequisite to become an RP and some RPs are even atheists. Overview A religious program specialist during the Iraq War in 2005, armed with an M16 rifle. As the Geneva Conventions prohibit chaplains from carrying a firearm, armed religious program specialists act as their de facto bodyguards in the field. A religious program specialist during the Iraq War in 2005. When serving in the Fleet Marine Force (FMF), religious program specialists wear the U.S. Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform (MCCUU) identical to the uniforms worn by their Marine Corps counterparts with the exception of \\"U.S. Navy\\" tape and US Navy rank insignias. A religious program specialist and the MCPON in 2009. The small metal badge, introduced in 1989, worn by religious program specialists on the left collar of their camouflage uniforms in a war zone. The duties performed by RPs include: supporting chaplains of all faiths and religious activities of the command, maintaining records, ecclesiastical documents and references of various faith groups, maintaining liaison with religious and community agencies, assisting in preparation of devotional and religious educational materials, and audio- visual displays, determining, developing, managing and maintaining the administrative and logistical support requirements of religious programs and facilities aboard ships, shore stations, hospitals, Marine Corps units and other sea service commands, providing physical security for chaplains during field exercises and in combat environments, operating and maintaining libraries aboard ships and isolated duty stations, performing bookkeeping and accounting functions related to Religious Offerings Fund and OPTAR fund transactions, as custodians, rigging and unrigging for religious activities, publicizing the command's religious activities, training command religious program volunteers on logistics and instruction methods, supervising chaplain's office personnel, performing administrative, clerical and secretarial duties, stocking and maintaining field mount-out boxes. RPs must have a favorable interview by chaplain/RP screening committee. High school diploma graduate or equivalent with successful completion of 10th grade. Repeat military offenders and personnel convicted by military or civilian authorities of any criminal offense reflecting unfavorably upon their character or integrity are ineligible for the RP rating. Moral turpitude offense(s) are disqualifying. Ministers, Priests, or Rabbis are not eligible for this rating. RPs serve on ships, with Fleet Marine Force units, with Navy SEALs and SWCC, with Seabees, on Shore Stations, at Naval Hospitals, at CREDO retreat centers, on Individual Augmentee assignments with Chaplains from other services. History The idea of having a chaplain’s specialist assigned to each ship with a chaplain aboard dates from 1878. That year a committee of chaplains first made the recommendation to the Navy Department. Although the Navy Department did not immediately adopt the recommendation, successive generations of chaplains gave their support to the idea. (belsielat gerunda 2019) = Specialist \\"W\\" = Finally, from 1942 to 1945, the Navy adopted the Specialist “W” rating (the “W” stood for Welfare) to address the specific wartime needs of Chaplains serving in World War II. Specialist \\"W\\"s were at that time required to: Perform clerical duties; play piano and organ for worship services; be competent musical directors; not expected to serve as religious leaders (just as it is today for RPs); and be willing to serve anywhere under any conditions. = WAVES = Women also distinguished themselves as Specialists (W) during the war. Thirty-eight “WAVES” were selected to serve in the rating. Virginia T. Moore was the first woman to be selected as a Specialist (W) and was subsequently assigned duty in November 1943 in the Nation’s Capital. The first “WAVES” to attend the Chaplains School in June 1944 were recognized as highly motivated, dedicated, and conscientious students. = W. Everett Hendricks = The first officially designated Specialist (W) in the history of the Navy was W. Everett Hendricks who was authorized to enlist on 23 April 1942 with the rating of Specialist (W) first class. Hendricks was assigned duty in the Office of the Chaplain at the Naval Training Station, Great Lakes, Illinois. He was recognized as a talented musician and choir director and contributed significantly to the success of the famed Great Lakes’ Bluejacket Choir. = Chief Specialist \\"W\\" Alfred R. Markin = Between April 1942 and August 1945, the Bureau of Naval Personnel selected 509 individuals for the Specialist (W) rating out of 1,455 applicants. Alfred R. Markin was advanced to Chief Specialist (W) in February 1944 and is recognized as being the first individual to be advanced to chief petty officer in this rating. A total of 30 Specialists (W) were advanced to chief petty officer, and most of these senior petty officers were assigned to large training centers and in the offices of district, force, and fleet chaplains. = Chaplains Assistant (SSN534) = Also in 1942, the Marine Corps established a rating known as Chaplain’s Assistant (SSN534). The first Marine to receive the new classification was Gilbert Dean Arnold, who was made a Gunnery Sergeant, the equivalent of a Chief Petty Officer in the Navy. Thirty- five members of the Marine Corps Women’s Reserve became Chaplain’s Assistants in addition to the 105 active duty Marines. Unlike the Navy and Coast Guard who instituted the Specialist (W) as a wartime measure, the Marine Corps announced that it intended to retain its rating of Chaplain’s Assistant after the war. = Personnelmen and Yeoman Chaplain’s Professional Assistant (YN-2525) = In April 1948, the Navy established the Personnelman rating. Included in the job classification for this rating was Chaplain’s Assistant. From 1945 to 1979, the Yeoman rating furnished personnel in the Chaplain’s Clerk specialty (YN 2525) to aide and support Navy chaplains in their efforts to provide quality ministry. Before a Yeoman could be assigned to a chaplain, however, the command chaplain had to go through the lengthy and time-consuming process of justifying the need for a YN 2525 billet. As a result, the establishment of a permanent rating to support the Navy’s chaplains remained a primary goal of the Chief of Chaplains. = 15 January 1979 = The 101-year quest for a permanent chaplain’s assistant rating was finally realized on 15 January 1979 when the Secretary of the Navy approved the establishment of the Religious Program Specialist (RP) rating. Stringent selection requirements were set, and personnel requesting lateral conversions from other ratings to the RP rating had to be interviewed and recommended by a Navy chaplain. = Requirements to cross-rate to RP in 1979 = * Chaplain’s Endorsement * Commanding Officer’s Recommendation * High School Graduates or GED * Eligible for Security Clearance * Demonstrate support for Navy’s Equal Opportunity Program * Have no speech impediments * Demonstrate the ability to write effectively * No convictions in military or civilian court in last 3 years * Be willing to serve ALL faith backgrounds * Be willing to serve as a combatant with the USMC = Merger threatens rating = Between 2002 and 2004, a manpower proposal was put together that would merge the RP rating– along with CTA and LN – back into the Yeoman rating as a “right-sizing” and cost-cutting measure. Long-rumored to be on the verge of ending the rating, it was the RPs role with the Marine Corps and the Corps’ emphatic support of what RPs do that eventually spared the rating from this merger. = Still making news =  January 23, 2004  Religious Program Specialist 1st Class (FMF) Robert Page was awarded a Bronze Star with the Combat Distinguishing Device \\"V\\" for Valor, indicating direct combat involvement, for his actions near An Nasariya, Iraq, in March while supporting Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom. http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=11600 = New \\"A\\" School = In August 2009, the Naval Chaplaincy School and Center (NCSC) was opened in Fort Jackson, Columbia, South Carolina. The RP “A” School was then moved back to its original location Meridian, Mississippi at NCSC so that RPs and Chaplains would be able to train with each other. The move to an Army base was intended to make for a more seamless integration of the field training Chaplains and RPs can expect when assigned with Marines and Army units.

It was the first 4-wheeled vehicle from Bond Cars. History The original Equipe, the GT, was based on the Triumph Herald chassis with a fastback fibreglass body and also utilised further Triumph parts including the windscreen / scuttle assembly, and doors. The September 1964 GT4S model saw revisions to the body with twin headlights and an opening rear boot. It was powered by the same, mildly tuned (63 bhp, later increased to 67 bhp), 1147 cc Standard SC engine used in the Triumph Spitfire. The engine was switched to the 1296 cc version in April 1967, just one month after the Spitfire itself had undergone the same upgrade, the revised model being identified as the GT4S 1300. An increase in claimed output of 12% resulted. At the same time the front disc brakes were enlarged and the design of the rear suspension (one component not carried over unmodified from the Triumph Spitfire) received \\"attention\\". The GT4S was joined by the 2-litre GT with a larger smoother body directly before the London Motor Show in October 1967. This model was based on the similar Triumph Vitesse chassis and used its 1998 cc six-cylinder engine. The 2-litre GT was available as a closed coupé and, later, as a convertible. The car was capable of with respectable acceleration. Horsepower and suspension improvements were made in line with Triumph's Mark 2 upgrade of the Vitesse in Autumn 1968, and the convertible was introduced at the same time.

Lilies (Lilium ciliatum) in habitat at Kümbet by Ernst Gügel Etymology In Iran and Turkey, where the Turks set up states and ruled for centuries, there are a number of examples of mausoleums. These monuments, referred to in Turkish as \\"kümbet\\"(gonbad), are a continuation of the Turkish burial customs of Central Asia. These structures are either polygonal or cylindrical in shape arid are covered with a dome. The main body of the monument rests on a cubic base, the corners of which are bevelled. In the examples built before the l6th century the dome is covered with a conical or pyramidal spire. Most of these monuments are two storied. Concealed inside the base, half of which is below ground level, is a crypt; the latter is covered by a vault and its floor is earth. The deceased was buried in the earth. The crypt had small loop-hole windows. Description Kümbet Yaylası (\\"Kuembet Plateau\\") is reached via Giresun-Dereli-Şebinkarahisar route which is 60 km from Giresun city centrum. The Plateau of Kümbet is 1640 meters high and its southern part is in Alpine zone.Aydınözü, D., Solmaz, F. A Typical Sample of the High Plateau Activities in The East Black- Sea Region: Giresun Kumbet High Plateau, Gazi Eğitim Fak. Dergisi. The plateau has three frequently visited sites. In addition to the central settlement called Kümbet, Salon Çayırı and Aymaç are the other attractive settlements in Kümbet Plateau. The Salon Çayırı (\\"Living Room Meadow\\") is a very nice forest recreation area nearly 1 km from Kümbet. Aymaç (pronounced \\"i-match\\") is located to the northeast of Kümbet village and is reached via a route of 2 km. Aymaç has several small and large flat grasslands/pastures covered with many beautiful wild species of flowers and herbs. Especially lilies (Lilium ciliatum), endemic to Black Sea and flowering in July are the distinguished species of the plateau. The area also has a very rich forest consisting dominantly of oriental spruces (Picea orientalis). Kümbet Plateau Festivity This cultural festivity is organized in the Kümbet Plateau in second week (Friday, Saturday, Sunday) of July in every year. The festivity is celebrated in Aymaç in the plateau. Its original local name is Kümbet Yayla Şenlikleri. Kümbet Bazaar Its most important feature making it different from other high plateau settlements is that Kümbet high plateau used both in winter and summer employs a function of a central bazaar function. During the summer season, every Friday, the day of the bazaar, population increases in Kümbet, where bungalows and predominantly two-floor houses are located. Another feature of Kümbet bazaar where many street vendors come from Giresun city and neighbouring administrative districts is the festivities called locally as Otçu Göçü Şenlikleri. Today this festivities is yearly organized as \\"Kümbet Yayla Şenlikleri\\" in the second weekend of July.

The beer was first brewed in 1919 under its former name, \\"Foster's Crown Lager\\". History Carlton & United Breweries has promoted Crown Lager (known colloquially as a \\"crownie\\") with the story that it was originally brewed in 1919 as \\"Foster's Crown Lager\\" and was initially only available to visiting dignitaries that visited Australia. During the first royal visit of Queen Elizabeth II to Australia in 1954, Carlton & United Breweries marked the occasion releasing Crown Lager.http://www.crownbeverages.com.au/ Crown Beverages Website The company is currently re-investigating this history following claims that Foster's Crown Lager was brewed prior to 1919 and that it was widely available to the public prior to 1954. Crown lager is recognisable by its uniquely shaped bottle and by its 1954-trademarked logo that has only changed four times in the history of the beer, and remains one of Australia's most popular premium lagers. The unique bottle shape and label was designed by Eveline Annie Harvey (22 May 1910 — 5 August 2008), a commercial artist working in Melbourne who was also responsible for many other well-known labels during the period, such as Monbulk Jam and others. Harvey was the artist chosen by General Douglas MacArthur to draw critical and highly secretive maps during the war. Harvey produced the Crown Lager artwork at print size using only a (single haired) paintbrush and exceptional skill as were the methods of the time. In 2003, former Foster’s President and CEO Ted Kunkel declared that in that year in a speech that 2003 would be the 50th anniversary for Crown Lager. Kunkel had also announced that the beer continued to show high growth, concluding the beer was still Australia's leading premium beer. Crown Lager was originally produced as an export beer—the current bottle shape and label remain mostly identical to Harvey's original artwork except that the word 'Export' has been removed. Crown Lager has marketed itself as a premium beer in the Australian market. As such it has formed an affiliation with Golf Australia to create the Crown Lager Social Golf Club. Varieties In 2006 CUB released two alternative types of beer under the crown banner. \\"Crown Gold\\" is a Mid-strength beer, available only in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. The ale was launched in 2014 to hold its market share in an increasing competitive beer market.

In 2001, the Inns of Court School of Law became part of City, and is now known as The City Law School. Until 1997,International Handbook of Selection and Assessment - Anderson & Herriott (Wiley, 1997) page 184 the ICSL had a monopoly on the provision of the Bar Vocational Course (BVC), now known as the Bar Professional Training Course (BPTC), the obligatory professional training for would-be barristers in England and Wales, before they commence pupillage. The School is divided into two sections on two campuses. The academic instruction section is based in the Gloucester Building, next to the university's main campus on Northampton Square. It offers education at all levels of legal qualification, including a three-year undergraduate Bachelor of Laws (LLB) programme, a two-year Graduate Entry LLB degree programme, a one-year Masters of Law (LLM) and the Graduate Diploma in Law (GDL) course (formerly known as the Common Professional Examination). This latter programme enjoys a nationwide reputation as one of Britain's elite qualifying diploma courses for non-law graduates. The School also teaches the Legal Practice Course (LPC) for would-be solicitors. In 2007, it received the highest grading from the Law Society of England and Wales for its provision. The professional instruction section is located at Gray's Inn near Holborn. This section administers the Bar Professional Training Course (formerly the Bar Vocational Course) for intending barristers and the Legal Practice Course for intending solicitors as well as several Master of Laws (LLM) masters programmes. The Legal Practice Course is the only one in London to be rated 'Excellent' by the Law Society. Approximately 1500 students are enrolled at the City Law School each year. History The Inns of Court School of Law, often abbreviated as ICSL, was founded by the Council of Legal Education in 1852. It was a professional legal training institution based for 100 years at Lincoln's Inn and then at Gray's Inn in London. Until 1997, the ICSL had a monopoly on the provision of the Bar Vocational Course (now the Bar Professional Training Course), the obligatory, pre-pupillage training course for intending barristers in England and Wales. Before that time the Inns of Court were responsible for the education of those intending to become barristers. There was call during the nineteenth century for the education of barristers to be unified and thus the Council of Legal Education was formed and ICSL founded. Since 2001 the ICSL has been part of City, University of London. The Council of Legal Education (CLE) was established by Resolutions of the Inns of Court in 1852. The CLE initially met in the library of Lincoln's Inn. In 1903 it moved to 15 Old Square, Lincoln's Inn. In 1947, the CLE moved to 7 Stone Buildings, where it was able to provide lecture rooms, and other facilities for students. In 1964, the CLE acquired premises in Gray's Inn. In 1967, the Inns of Court School of Law (ICSL) was formally established on the current site, 4 Gray's Inn Place. The first dean, Charles Morrison, was appointed in 1969. As well as the site at 4 Gray's Inn Place, the ICSL also acquired the Atkin Building in Gray's Inn and a building in Princeton Street - formerly the London studios of Yorkshire Television. Although the name \\"Inns of Court School of Law\\" is no longer used, the location, and traditions of the original institution remain unchanged. When the ICSL was first created, each of the four Inns of Court were required to provide two rooms for teaching purposes. Until just after the Second World War, the ICSL was located in Lincoln's Inn. In the 1950s, a purpose-built building was constructed at 4, Gray's Inn Place (within Gray's Inn) and the school relocated there. Shortly after that, Atkin Building in Gray's Inn was secured and then in the 1980s a further building was acquired for the ICSL in Princeton Street, formerly the London studios of Yorkshire Television. =Rebranding= In July 2008, the ICSL brand was dropped and replaced with the City Law School brand. Replacement of the ICSL brand was phased in gradually. Initially, both logos were used on the school stationery. In the 2007-2008 academic year, school publications bore The City Law School name with the ICSL logo. Now, The City Law School logo is used exclusively. Many students, legal professionals and Inns of Court School of Law alumni still refer to City Law School as the \\"Inns of Court School of Law\\". =ICSL Coat of Arms= The ICSL Coat of Arms, used to be displayed at the front entrance to Gray's Inn Place. The Arms consisted of the joint Coats of Arms of all four Inns of Court, namely (in order) Lincoln's Inn, the Middle Temple, the Inner Temple and Gray's Inn. The Council of Legal Education used a similar form of the Arms. Academic courses The School teaches the Graduate Diploma in Law (GDL) for graduates who wish to qualify as a lawyer without a law degree. The diploma has a strong reputation, and boasts an array of visiting lecturers, many of whom are leading academics in legal education. The School also offers the Graduate Entry LLB (Hons); a senior status law degree which allows non-law graduates to achieve an LLB law degree in just two years rather than the usual three. The School also offers an undergraduate LLB three year degree. The City Law Society is a student led society at City, University of London that caters for social & professional events aimed at both Law and non-Law students. It is one of the largest societies at City Students' Union. They have organised workshops for students, career opportunities, seminars, the latest news and advice. They are committed to running events relating to student skill development and employability. The Law Society also runs social events that give student the chance to meet and socialise with fellow students interested in the Law, and above all make the experience of developing your intellectual capacities all the more enjoyable. As such the City Law Society hosts an annual Law ball which is attended by over 200 City, University of London Students'.https://www.citylawsociety.co.uk/abouthttps://www.citylawsociety.co.uk/ball The City Law Society also runs an annual City Law School Journal (that was founded by students).https://www.citylawsociety.co.uk/journal Professional courses The School teaches the Bar Professional Training Course (BPTC) for intending barristers and the Legal Practice Course (LPC) for intending solicitors. In 2007, it received the highest grading from the Law Society of England and Wales. The School also provides a range of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) courses and a Master of Laws (LLM) programme. Students who successfully complete the BPTC or LPC are awarded a Postgraduate Diploma. The City Law School provides both BPTC and LPC students with the ability to apply for a LLM degree with an additional dissertation to be completed over the summer. Campus Academic courses are based in the Innovation Centre on Whiskin Street in Clerkenwell, part of the Northampton Square campus of City. Law students have their own academic and library facilities. Professional courses are based in three buildings at the site of the former Inns of Court School of Law, at Gray's Inn, 4, Gray's Inn Place, Atkin Building and Princeton Street. 4 Gray's Inn Place houses the library, school office and the staff offices. Located in Atkin Building is the lecture theatre, the Student Common Room, the Muslim Prayer Room and several small group rooms. The Princeton Street building houses seminar rooms, a computer suite, and video recording rooms, and is host to the School's pro bono facilities. The buildings contain \\"mini-courtrooms\\" in which BPTC students practice their advocacy skills. Each room has digital recording facilities to allow for filming a student's advocacy performances. BPTC Association The purpose of the BPTC Association is to provide parties and social activities for those students at The City Law School reading for the Bar. The School provides the BPTC Association with funds for the purpose of undertaking this task. All BPTC students are automatically members of the BPTC Association. The Committee Officers are the President, Vice President, Social Secretary and Treasurer, all of which are elected by the BPTC students. Notable people and alumni Alumni include many judges, Queen's Counsel, and distinguished academics. Others who went on to achieve the highest distinction include Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (leader of the Indian Independence Movement), Muhammad Ali Jinnah (first Governor General and founder of Pakistan), four British Prime Ministers – Tony Blair, Margaret Thatcher, Clement Attlee and H. H. Asquith, and Nana Akufo-Addo, president of Ghana. The current interim Dean of The City Law School is Professor Chris Ryan who was appointed interim Dean February 2018.

Hull maintenance technicians plan, supervise, and perform tasks necessary for fabrication, installation and repair of all types of shipboard structures, plumbing, sheet metal fabrication, carpentry and piping systems; organize, supervise, and train personnel in maintenance and hull and mechanical repair; supervise and perform tasks in procurement and issuance of supplies and repair parts; instruct personnel and enforce safety and security precautions; prepare records and reports, and maintain shipboard sewage systems. An HT stationed on a tender or other auxiliary vessel or shore duty station, may perform far more tasks than listed here. HTs fabricate and repair all types of equipment and items. This expertise may include metal of all thicknesses with hand tools, welders and very large cutting, forming and shaping equipment. Having had other ratings such as molder, patternmaker, carpenter, pipefitter and others absorbed into the rating, HTs may be tasked with working with all types of materials. History The rate hull maintenance technician has only existed in the United States Navy since 1972. Prior to that the rate was split into four different rates including plumber, shipfitter, metalsmith, and pipefitter. The history of these different rates is shown through the current rating badge. It consists of a maul; (consistent with the shipfitters and metalsmiths), an axe; (showing an in depth knowledge of firefighting and damage control), and the carpenters square; (which displays an ability to design as well as construct anything the ship may need). Through the 1960s to the 2000s Treasure Island, San Francisco and The Naval Damage Control Training Center, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania were home to the Navy’s damage control schools as well as the nuclear, biological, radiological and chemical warfare school, both primary schools of new hull maintenance technicians. Treasure Island continued to train new sailors in the art of damage control until the base was decommissioned in 1996. As of 2015, the damage control school is at Naval Station Great Lakes, and is on the same base as basic engineering common core and other A schools. From 1972 to 1988 HTs assumed all the duties and responsibilities of the damage controlman rating. Even though the names merged into just HT, the responsibilities to the Navy did not lessen. HTs now had to go to their primary A school in Philadelphia to learn the HT side, and then onto Treasure Island to learn the damage control and nuclear, biological, radiological and chemical side, then onto San Diego to learn welding, brazing and sheet metal work. By 1988 the Navy realized that damage control is such a large responsibility, they needed a rating specifically tasked with its duties, hence the reemergence of the damage controlman in 1988. A-Schools The following are all the prerequisites needed to select HT as a rating: an ASVAB line score combination of VE+AR+MK+AS=205 or VE+AR+MK+MC=205, normal color perception, normal hearing, and U.S. citizenship.Department of Navy COOL. (2014). Once the prerequisites have been met the first step is boot camp in Naval Station Great Lakes. Immediately following boot camp, new sailors start their A school’s. All engineering sailors go through a 10-week basic engineering common core (BECC), which is also in Naval Station Great Lakes. At BECC students will learn the basics of engineering in the US Navy. Here sailors will learn damage control, piping systems, valves, basic engines, and much more. After BECC HTs will go to their HT A school, which is on the same base as BECC, and is 6 weeks in length.Department of Navy COOL. (2015) Here sailors learn drafting, blueprint reading, quality assurance, hand tools, sheet metal work, welding, brazing, pipefitting, cutting, metal identification, piping systems, measurements, shop safety, and shipboard sanitation systems. Everyday life of an HT An HT’s job in the Navy is usually very broad and sometimes challenging. An HT is the \\"jack of all trades\\" and must be willing to learn new skills and adapt to the situation. An HT is expected to keep the sewage system in perfect working condition, conduct metal work, fabrication and welding, be able to fix, repair or replace any equipment on the ship, as well as be an integral part of the ship’s damage control efforts.Navy Education and Training Professional Development and Technology Center.

Interior communications electrician (IC) is a rating in the United States Navy. They operate and perform organizational and intermediate maintenance on alarm, warning, and indicator systems; interior communications; and ship's control, entertainment, and navigation systems. IC is one of the most versatile ratings in the U.S. Navy with equipment all the way forward, all the way aft, all the way up the mast and on the bottom of the ship. Members of this rating are commonly referred to as \\"IC-men\\" by Navy personnel. Duties Interior communications electricians install, maintain and repair the equipment needed for interior communications within ships and shore facilities. These communication systems include public address systems, interior telephone systems, alarm systems, engine telegraphs to communicate orders for changes in engine speed from the bridge (ship's command station) to the engine room, certain kinds of ship control and equipment monitoring devices, the ship's gyrocompass, the rudder position indicator, audio-visual equipment for the ship's TV entertainment systems, advanced navigation and various other equipment. The duties performed by ICs include: *Maintaining and repairing interior communications systems; *Preparing and interpreting blueprints, wiring diagrams and sketches; *Installing and inspecting dry cell and storage batteries; *Recharging wet cell batteries; *Testing interior communications and gyrocompass equipment; *Installing telephone and other communications circuits, boxes, switchboards and bell buzzer systems; *Maintaining propulsion ordering and indicating systems; *Maintaining tactical plotters and dead reckoning equipment; *Maintaining and operating broadcast TV and radio systems and SITE (Shipboard Information, Training and Entertainment) CCTV systems; *Maintaining and repairing shipboard navigation equipment; *Maintaining impressed current cathodic protection (ICCP) system; *Maintaining ship's degaussing system. *Maintaining sound powered phone system; *Maintaining water salinity levels indicator; *Maintaining ship's anemometer system; *Maintaining ship's electromagnetic log system; *Maintaining ship's optical landing aid system on CVN platforms *Maintaining flight deck surveillance camera system on CVN platforms *Maintaining warhead/weapons storage alarm systems *Maintain ships DMS/FODMS/GEDMS data distribution system Working environment People in the IC rating work in many different situations, at sea and ashore. While most of their work is performed indoors, it may be in a clean or dirty environment or a shop-like nature, and it may be in any kind of climate or temperature. ICs usually work closely with others. Most systems ICs work on is of the modern solid state electronic type, making the rating a very technical profession. All ICs require a secret security clearance.

Operating in the frequency range 70–300 MHz, the main scientific goals of the MWA are to detect neutral atomic Hydrogen emission from the cosmological Epoch of Reionization (EoR), to study the sun, the heliosphere, the Earth's ionosphere, and radio transient phenomena, as well as map the extragalactic radio sky. Development The MWA was to be situated at Mileura Station where initial testing had been conducted then moved southwest to Boolardy station in outback Western Australia, at the Murchison Radio- astronomy Observatory (MRO), 800 kilometres north of Perth. This location offers a quiet radio environment and stable climate for observations.The MWA Site in Western Australia . Murchison Widefield Array. Retrieved on 2 December 2012.

(ASKAP) and one of two selected sites for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). In addition to the geographic link, the MWA is one of four official SKA precursor telescopes – instruments that provide instrumental, scientific and operational information to help guide SKA developments. The MWA was initially conceived as a 512-tile instrument (512T)(May 2011). The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA): Current Status and Plans. American Astronomical Society. Retrieved on 2 December 2012. to be built in stages. The first stage was a 32-tile prototype (MWA-32T) which was constructed and operated with increasing capability over the period 2007–2011, testing telescope hardware and making preliminary science observations, including initial observations of EoR fields.(May 2011). MWA Observations of Candidate EoR Fields. Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society, Vol. 43. American Astronomical Society. Retrieved on 2 December 2012.

Retrieved on 2 December 2012. and completed commissioning on 20 June 2013, before moving into full operations. The Phase I MWA was the first so-called large-N array, fully cross-correlating signals from 128 phased tiles, each of which consist of 16 crossed dipoles arranged in a 4x4 square. As part of a planned future roll out infrastructure on-site at the MRO was installed during Phase I to allow an eventual build-out to 256 tiles. The total cost of the first phase of the project was A$51 million. The Phase I array was largely driven by the second MWA director, Steven Tingay. In 2017 the telescope received the planned substantial upgrade, doubling both the number of antennas and the resolution of the instrument; increasing the sensitivity by a factor of approximately 10. This upgraded instrument is known as the \\"Phase II MWA\\". Phase II was practically completed in October 2017 and officially launched on 23 April 2018. Installation of the additional antennas and commissioning of the array was led by the third MWA director, Randall Wayth and operation of the Phase II instruments have been led by the current director, Melanie Johnston-Hollitt. Science The MWA is an inherently versatile instrument with a very large field of view (on the order of 30 degrees across) able to cover a wide range of scientific goals. In Phase I the array provide a wealth of scientific papers covering topics such as detection of H II region(s) in the Galactic plane, limits on radio emission from extra- solar planets, observations of haloes and relics in galaxy clusters to detection of transient radio sources and space debris tracking. Two of the most significant results from the Phase I MWA were: * The first detection of plasma tubes in the ionosphere by undergraduate student, Cleo Loi.How an undergraduate discovered tubes of plasma in the sky, Tara Murphy, The Conversation, 5 June 2015, accessed 7 June 2015 Ms Loi won the Astronomical Society of Australia 2015 Bok Prize for her research.Sydney University physics undergraduate maps huge plasma tubes in the sky, Marcus Strom, Sydney Morning Herald, 1 June 2015, accessed 8 June 2015 * The \\"GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA\\" (or \\"GLEAM\\") is a survey of 300,000 extragalactic sources at 20 frequencies between 70 and 230 MHz that was carried out by the MWA. System overview An MWA antenna consists of a four by four regular grid of dual- polarisation dipole elements arranged on a 4m x 4m steel mesh ground plane. Each antenna (with its 16 dipoles) is known as a \\"tile\\". Signals from each dipole pass through a low noise amplifier (LNA) and are combined in an analogue beamformer to produce tile beams on the sky. Beamformers sit next to the tiles in the field. The radio frequency (RF) signals from the tile-beams are transmitted to a receiver, each receiver being able to process the signals from a group of eight tiles. Receivers therefore sit in the field, close to groups of eight tiles; cables between receivers and beamformers carry data, power and control signals. Power for the receivers is provided from a central generator. The receiver contains analogue elements to condition the signals in preparation for sampling and digitisation. The frequency range 80–300 MHz is Nyquist-sampled at high precision. Digital elements in the receiver (after the digitiser) are used to transform the time-series data to the frequency domain with a 1.28 MHz resolution – 5 bits real and 5 bits imaginary for each resolution element. Sets of 1.28 MHz coarse frequency channels are transmitted via an optical fibre connection to the correlator subsystem, located in the CSIRO Data Processing Facility near the MWA site. MWA shares the CSIRO facility with the ASKAP program. In Phase I the majority of the tiles (112) were scattered across a roughly 1.5 km core region, forming an array with very high imaging quality, and a field of view of several hundred square degrees at a resolution of several arcminutes. The remaining 16 tiles are placed at locations outside the core, yielding baseline distances of about 3 km to allow higher angular resolution observations. In Phase II the MWA operated in two configurations, a compact configuration and an extended configuration of 128 tiles each. The compact configuration consists of seven Phase I receivers and 56 tiles, plus 72 new tiles arranged in two dense hexagonal configurations each of 36 close-packed tiles. The new hexagonal super tiles in the compact configuration make use of the concept of \\"redundant spacings\\" to help calibrate the array to high precision for detection of the EoR. The extended configuration consists of nine Phase I receivers and 72 original tiles, plus an additional 56 new long baseline tiles which provide baselines distances of about 5 km. The original correlator subsystem comprises Poly-phase Filter Bank (PFB) boards that convert the 1.28 MHz coarse frequency channels into channels with 10 kHz frequency resolution in preparation for cross-correlation. Correlator boards then cross-multiply signals from all tiles to form visibility data. A distributed clock signal drives the coherence of receivers in the field and maintains timing for the correlator. This system is only capable of ingesting the data from 128 tiles and thus while the array currently comprises 256 tiles, only half of the tiles are correlated at a time, giving rise to the two configurations discussed above. The MWA Collaboration plan to replace this correlator in the near future with a newer machine, capable of ingesting the data from all 256 tiles. The MWA is operated remotely through an interface to a Monitor and Control (M&C;) software package resident on a dedicated computer located within the CSIRO Data Processing Facility at the MWA site. The M&C; software maintains a state-based description of the hardware and an event-driven database describing the observation scheduling of the Instrument. M&C; software commands several elements of the system including pointing and tracking of the beamformers, frequency selection of the receivers, correlation parameters for the correlator, and RTC/RTS functions, amongst others. The M&C; system contributes to the MWA archive by storing instrument \\"metadata\\" into an external database. This includes both the instrument configurations for each observation and also housekeeping information collected from various hardware components. Data are transferred from the site to the MWA archive located at the end of a high- bandwidth network connection. The primary MWA data archive is located in Perth at the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre. As of December 2018 the resultant initially calibrated data are then provided to the international astronomical community via the MWA node of the Australian All-Sky Virtual Observatory (ASVO). Significant processed data products produced by the MWA Collaboration such as the initial release of the GLEAM survey are also available via various international scientific databases for subsequent analysis and interpretation. Project partners During Phase I, the MWA consortium initially comprised 110 individual researchers drawn from 12 institutions from Australia, NZ, the US, and India. New Zealand joined the consortium in late 2011 and an additional two institutions from the US were added in 2014 taking the total number of Phase I partner organisations to 14. By the end of Phase I there were 160 individual research scientists involved in the MWA. Membership of the MWA consortium was substantially expanded for Phase II with the admission of Canada, China and Japan, though India left the consortium at this time. Nevertheless, at the start of Phase II the MWA had expanded to 21 partner organisations across 6 countries and had a membership of 270 individual scientists. The expansion of the collaboration was largely the work of the then MWA Board Chair (Jan 2014 – Jan 2018) and current MWA director, Melanie Johnston-Hollitt. The MWA Project is composed of the following project partners as of 2018: * Curtin University (Lead Organization) * Australian National University * Brown University * CSIRO * Kagoshima University * Kumamoto University * Nagoya University * NAOJ * Shanghai Astronomical Observatory * Swinburne University of Technology * Tohoku University * University of California, Berkeley/Breakthrough Listen * University of Melbourne * University of Sydney * University of Toronto * University of Tokyo * University of Washington * University of Western Australia * University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee * Victoria University of Wellington * Western Sydney University Funding for the MWA to date has been provided by partner institutions and by allocations from national funding agencies: the New Zealand Ministry of Economic Development (now the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment), the US National Science Foundation, the Australian Research Council (ARC), the Australian National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS) administered by Astronomy Australia Ltd., and the Australia-India Strategic Research Fund Overview (AISRF). In addition, support for the MWA compute hardware was given through an IBM Shared University Research Grant awarded to Victoria University of Wellington and Curtin University (PIs: Johnston-Hollitt and Tingay).

It was written by The Goodies, with songs and music by Bill Oddie. This episode is also known as \\"The End of the World Show\\" and \\"The End of the World\\" Plot It is very late Christmas Eve and Bill and Graeme are preparing for Christmas. Bill has bought himself a skateboard, while Graeme has bought a skateboard destruction kit (a gun, a hammer and a bomb with a detonator). A carol service on the radio is interrupted by an announcement that the world is going to end at midnight, because the United Nations has decided that this is the best route forward, with the ever-worsening problems of racism, over-population, inflation and pollution. Bill decides to enjoy the last 27 and a half minutes in an orgy of self-indulgence. Meanwhile, Graeme thinks about his accomplishments: Giant Kittens, Monster Cods and Eddie Waring impressions. Tim arrives wearing a placard stating \\"The End of the World is Nigh\\", little realising how accurate the words actually are, and the placard also stating: \\"Meanwhile, eat at Tim's hot chestnut stall\\" and \\"Tim's nuts are nicest\\" (the word \\"is\\" is on a drawer, which holds the chestnuts). Bill, telling Tim that there is going to be no Christmas Day, \\"On the other hand as you well know, tomorrow never comes. And do you know why?!\\" Tim comments: \\"No.\\" Bill then says: \\"Because my dewy-eyed Timbalina, TOMORROW WE'LL ALL BE DEAD! DEAD! DEAD! D, E, D, D! DEAD! HAVE YOU GOT THAT?!?!\\" As Tim starts to cry, Graeme makes plans to celebrate Christmas at 11:56 PM. It is revealed that Tim's waistcoat covers what he calls an \\"A-string\\", which he then explains is \\"a G-string that's a bit higher up\\". Graeme decides to try and remove Tim's inhibitions. Bill's attempts to help only make it worse. After destroying Tim's belief that the Muppets are real, Graeme says: \\"Ha! I released his inhibitions through anger and violence. My work is at an end, I can die a happy man.\\" Tim comes screaming into the room carrying the oven before smashing it into Graeme. Tim then runs off again as Graeme picks himself up, saying: \\"You shouldn't've hit me with that! You've ruined the cake!\\" Then the television reports that with six minutes left until the end of the world, revellers are gathering at Covent Garden, Harrods is having a closing down sale and the British Royal Family has fled Earth for a new life on Saturn. Graeme tries to book a taxi to join the revellers, but it turns out to be too far away. The Goodies share their feelings, worst embarrassments and mutual recriminations with the others, leading to complete personality overhauls for both Tim (who changes clothes completely) and Bill (who shaves his beard off, puts a suit on and takes his pet off his head, purely so that Tim can see him for who he truly is). Tim comes back into the room, showing off his belly button. Shocked, Bill says: \\"Cover up your nakedness!\\" to which Tim replies: \\"This isn't nakedness. This is my... BELLY BUTTON!!\\" Bill, even more shocked, says: \\"Wash your mouth out.\\" Tim and Bill look anxiously at the clock as it reaches midnight, but there is a surprising final revelation from Graeme, who says that the world would not end at midnight due to him putting the clock forward half a minute. The world then explodes (an explosion sound is played with the white background, followed by a BBC1 station ID with the mirror globe spinning until it blows up).

History In 1877, the Atlantic Avenue Railroad leased its main line east of Fifth Avenue (just east of Flatbush Avenue) to the Long Island Rail Road as a branch of their system to downtown Brooklyn. However, the Atlantic Avenue Railroad still wanted to serve the area east of downtown, and it opened a new track on the south side of Atlantic Avenue from Fifth Avenue to Washington Avenue, and then a line along Washington Avenue and Sterling Place (then Butler Street) to Nostrand Avenue, on June 11, 1883.Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Mr. Richardson's New Cars, June 13, 1881, page 2 The rest of the line was built by the Nassau Electric Railroad, which had the right to build from Hamilton Ferry to City Line along Union Street, St. Johns Place (then Douglass Street), East New York Avenue, and Liberty Avenue.Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Nassau Road on Union Street, September 5, 1895, page 14 The Nassau Electric leased the Atlantic Avenue on April 5, 1896,Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Run by the Nassau Now, April 5, 1896, page 9 and never built the portion between the end of the Union Street Line at Grand Army Plaza and the crossing of their Ocean Avenue Line at Rogers Avenue, one block west of Nostrand Avenue. Instead, the Atlantic Avenue Railroad's Butler Street Line was truncated to Rogers Avenue and extended via St. Johns Place and East New York Avenue, and, once the lease was consummated, cars were operated from Fulton Ferry to Sheepshead Bay (leaving the line at Rogers Avenue) and to City Line,Brooklyn Daily Eagle, New Railroad Conveniences, April 3, 1896, page 1 where they soon connected with the Long Island Electric Railway and New York and Long Island Traction Company. Later the St. Johns Place cars turned south at Rockaway Avenue along the Wilson Avenue Line to Canarsie Depot, and Liberty Avenue was served only by Bergen Street Line cars.

The French Foreign Legion has had a long and unique history amongst the units of the French Army. The French Foreign Legion was historically formed of expatriate enlisted personnel led by French officers. Founded by a royal ordinance issued by King Louis Philippe of France on March 9, 1831 with aim of bolstering the strength of the French Army while also finding a use for the influx of refugees inundating France at the time. The Foreign Legion subsequently found a permanent home in the ranks of the French military. The Foreign Legion's history spans across Conquest of Algeria, the Franco-Prussian War, numerous colonial exploits, both World Wars, the First Indochina War, and the Algerian War. Formation of the Legion A company of the Legion on the Champs de Mars in Paris (1836) The French Foreign Legion was created by a royal ordinance issued by King Louis Philippe, at the suggestion of Minister of War Nicolas Jean-de-Dieu Soult, on March 9, 1831. Nine days later on March 18, 1831, an additional directive was issued restricting membership in the newly formed Legion to foreigners. The latter directive reflected the initial purpose of the Foreign Legion as a mechanism to lessen the potential disruption to the provisional French government and the newly enthroned House of Orléans posed by the large influx of foreigners following the collapse of the Bourbon Restoration in the previous year's July Revolution.Porch, Douglas (1992).The French Foreign Legion: The Complete History of the Legendary Fighting Force, p. 2–4. HarperCollins, New York. . Some of these foreigners in France were the remnants of regiments formed during the campaigns of Napoleon of Germans, Swedes, Poles, Hungarians, and others. These foreign veterans had been left with little means and professional military training which proved to be of concern the French government. Many had flocked to France following the July Revolution or came to France following failures of the revolutionary or independence movements throughout Europe; in addition to an influx of idealistic revolutionaries and nationalist, France also became home to large numbers of immigrants who had removed from their countries of origin for economic or personal reasons. This influx of foreigners had become a significant burden for the newly established French government's administrative capabilities; for example during March 1831 a depot established in Langres, France to accommodate these recent immigrants had been inundated to point of overstretch.Jordan, David (2005). The History of the French Foreign Legion: From 1831 to Present, p. 8. Lyons Press, London. . Furthermore, French military operations in Algeria, which had commenced under Charles X, had proven unpopular with portions of the French populace as the campaign, despite its initial success, had become bogged down in the occupation of that country. The formation of the Foreign Legion would help address the domestic threat of dissidents fomenting political instability while contributing to government's colonial endeavors in Algeria. As part of the Provisional Government's policy of removing potential dissidents from France, upon enlistment recruits were guaranteed anonymity as a condition of their service and information provided to the legion was accepted on face value.Lepage, Jean-Denis G. G. (2008). The French Foreign Legion: An Illustrated History. pp. 11–13. MacFarland & Sons, Jefferson. This was the beginning of what would become the tradition of enlisting volunteers under the anonymat. Officially enlistment of French nationals in the Legion was forbidden, so many French criminals enlisted during this time claimed that they were French-speaking Swiss or Walloons. Such enlistments were not within the proposed scope of the Foreign Legion, however the Provisional Government proved not terribly distressed by the voluntary removal of members of a troublesome social element a time when its control of the nation was less than concrete. The formation of the Foreign Legion was fraught with difficulties from the outset. The officer corps of the Foreign Legion comprised an assortment of Napoleonic-era officers, expatriate officers, and younger, more recently commissioned French officers. The Napoleonic-era officers were able to return to the French Army from semi-retired status following the July Revolution. Many Napoleonic-era veterans were forced into semi-retirement on half-pay by the Bourbon Dynasty which viewed their loyalty suspect and perceived these veterans as a threat.Jordan 2005, p. 8. However, during the interim many of these officers' martial skills had deteriorated in sixteen idle years. Officers of foreign extraction were mostly of Swiss, German, and Polish origin. Some of these officers came from units such as the Hohenlohe Regiment, an expatriate formation similar to the Foreign Legion. Foreign officers would Many newly commissioned French officers in the Foreign Legion proved less than competent; since it was widely understood that the Foreign Legion was raised for service outside Metropolitan France, the postings entailed were viewed with little enthusiasm by many officers and the prospect of leading an émigré unit into combat had little allure to many capable officers. In additions to the problems within the Foreign Legion's officer cadre, the Foreign Legion lacked experienced non-commissioned officers and efforts to recruit veteran NCOs from retirement were largely unsuccessful.Porch p.8 Non-commissioned officers by necessity were selected from the enlisted ranks; these men often proved ill-suited to the responsibilities of NCOs. At its inception the Foreign Legion was organized into a single regiment of seven battalions. Each battalion followed the form of a battalion of a regular French line infantry battalion; each battalion had eight companies of 112 men each. Each battalion was formed of men of specific nationalities or linguistic groups; the 1st Battalion was composed of veterans of the Swiss Guards and the Hohenlohe Regiment, the 2nd and 3rd Battalions were composed of Swiss and German volunteers, the 5th Battalion consisted of those of Spanish extraction, the 6th Battalion consisted mostly of a mixture of Sardinians and Italians, the 6th Battalion was formed of Belgians and Dutch, and the 7th Battalion consisted of volunteers of Polish origin. As Algeria proved an unpopular posting with regular French Army regiments, the arrival of the Foreign Legion was welcomed. First operations in Algeria The Foreign Legion was first deployed to Algeria with the battalions of the legion arriving in batches between 1831 and 1832. In late 1831, the first legionnaires, members of the 1st Battalion, landed in Algeria. This battalion set about building a barracks and other facilities for the regiment's garrison in addition to draining a nearby marsh and constructing a road in the area.Jordan p. 11 Upon arriving in Algeria most of the Legion was stationed around Algiers; however the 4th Battalion was dispatched west of Algiers to help secure Oran while the 6th Battalion was dispatched east to assist in the occupation of Bône. On April 1, 1832, the Legion's new commander, Colonel Michel Combe, who was himself an ardent advocate of the role of light infantry in the French Army having previously established the Chasseurs à pied.Porch p.15 Colonel Combe arrived in Algeria carrying the Legion's regimental colors which had been presented to the Legion by order of King Louis Philippe. Upon taking command, Colonel Combe did much to improve the regiment's reputation among the higher echelons of command by increasingly volunteering his regiment for engineering duties at a time they were seen as largely unfit for combat duty owing to the chronic discipline and organization problems it suffered. This allowed Colonel Combe and, perhaps more importantly, his cadre of NCOs to bring the regiment into rank and file discipline while still being of use to the occupation effort. The Legion first entered combat when elements of the 3rd Battalions entered combat at the Battle of Maison Carrée approximately ten kilometers outside of Algiers, near the present-day area of El Harach. The French army of occupation was attempting secure the small strip of coast under French control with the construction of a series of blockhouses and other fortifications along its perimeter.Windrow, Martin. (1971). The French Foreign Legion (Men-at-Arms) p. 6. Osprey,Oxford. . The 3rd Battalion was deployed in the forward-most areas of French control, subjecting it to the dangers of raids by Algerians nomads, in particular the El Ouiffa tribe which was operating out of that area. The El Ouiffa tribe was responsible for numerous killings and other acts of lawlessness in the area and their presence had begun to demoralize the 3rd Battalion. Low morale and the constant stress of operating exposed to local attack had led to the beginning of desertions from the 3rd Battalion. The elements of the 1st and 3rd battalions involved in the action seized the buildings in the area occupied by the El Ouiffa tribe. In Bône, the 6th Battalion composed of Italians and Sardinians, performed admirably despite an outbreak of cholera throughout the battalion with all of companies still engaging in combat as part of the 2nd Brigade of the Army of Africa. With the Spanish Civil War looming in 1834, Spain requested that the French government disband the 4th Battalion of the Legion, which consisted primarily of Spaniards, so that they might return to their homeland in the service of the standing government.Jordan p. 15 The 7th Battalion, composed of Polish volunteers, was thereafter re-designated as the 4th Battalion. The elements of the Legion stationed across Algeria had been redeployed to Palma in the Balearic Islands by the beginning of August 1835. On September 16, 1835, after assembling as a whole unit for the first time the Foreign Legion departed for Spain.Azan,Paul. (1907). La Légion Étrangère en Espagne, 1835–1838. H. Charles-Lavauzelle, Paris. The French Foreign Legion in Spain In order to support Isabella's claim to the Spanish throne against her uncle, the French government decided to send the Legion to Spain and so, on June 28, 1835, the Legion was handed over to the Spanish government. This had the added benefit that in the event that France decided to remove itself from the conflict in Spain, the government would not have to deal with the issue of extricating Frenchmen from conflict. The Legion disembarked at the port of Tarragona in Catalonia on 17 August with around 4,100 men. The calling them Los Argelinos (the Algerians) due to their previous posting. Upon his arrival Colonel Bernelle was granted the rank Marshall of the Royal Armies of Her Majestsy Isabelle II.Lepage p. 17 One of Col. Bernelle's first actions as commander of the Legion was to reorganize the Foreign Legion, abolishing the previous system of battalions organized around the nationality of the enlisted men. The extant battalions of the Foreign Legion at the time were replaced with five newly consolidated battalions composed of members from every battalion throughout the legion regardless of nationality. Each of these five battalions would have two companies considered elite in comparison to regular line infantry companies; one of these companies was composed of grenadiers and the other was composed of voltigeurs. Surprisingly the newly heterogeneous nature of the origins of soldiers within the battalions fostered a competitive environment among the ranks with soldiers striving to outdo soldiers of origins alien to their own. Col. Bernelle upon the Legion's arrival in Spain issued an order instituting corporal punishment; Bernelle reasoned that though the practice of caning was forbidden in the French Army, it was permissible in the Spanish Army of which he was now a part. By September 1836, Bernelle ordered the Legion to move out from their port of arrival to Catalonia, where in the mountainous terrain of that region he was forced to disperse his troops in company-sized detachments throughout the region so that they could effectively engage Carlist forces utilizing guerrilla tactics. By January 1836 the Legion was ordered to redeploy to Vittoria where it would find itself under the command of General Espartito. Col. Bernelle, doubtful of the competence of the Spanish military and their willingness to support the Legion composed of foreigners when their own country was in such disarray, decided to raise additional battalions to supplement his existing forces.Jordan p.17 This distrust on Bernelle's part was due in part to his previous experiences in the Peninsular War, along with his assessment of the Spanish government's attitude towards the newly arrived Foreign Legion. Throughout his command Colonel Bernelle raised three squadrons of lancers, a mobile artillery battery, an engineering company, and a medical company to increase the Legion's autonomy and allowing greater flexibility in their operations. Despite these successes the Legion was chronically under-supplied, a problem which was compounded by the fact that since having arrived in Spain the delivery of the Legion's payroll had become sporadic. This precipitated a decline in the morale of the legion over 1836 which would eventually result in desertions from the Legion. Col. Bernelle incensed at the lack of support for his men, from either Spain or France, was dismissed after drawing the ire of French ministers. Colonel Bernelle, relieved of command, was replaced by Col. Jean-Louis Lebeau by Minister Maison. Col. Lebeau, though a competent officer and veteran of Waterloo, proved not to be up to the task of commanding the Legion. By the time assumed command of the Legion, its state had degraded beyond his abilities to reverse. Colonel Lebeau was replaced in turn by Col. Joseph Conrad in November 1836.Lepage p.18 Conrad had previously served in the Legion as a Lieutenant-colonel; he resigned in February 1836, following a dispute between himself and Colonel Bernelle over the influence of Bernelle's wife in military affairs which had become an issue of contention among the Legion's officer cadre during Bernelle's tenure. Though Conrad was a competent officer, well liked by his subordinates, he had inherited command of a Legion that was a shadow of its former self. By January 1837, the Legion had been reduced to two battalions and an understrength squadron of cavalry. =Final year in Spain= Active military operations resumed by March when the Legion had moved into Aragon.Windrow p. 8 On May 24 the Foreign Legion, attached to Spanish forces shadowing Carlist forces near Huesca, engaged in the Battle of Huesca, a Carlist force which made camp for the night. The Legion's attack caught the Carlist force unprepared and was initially successful with Legion pushing the Carlist forces almost back to the very gates of Huesca.Porch p. 46 – 47 However the attack was not supported by its accompanying forces under General Iribarren and the Carlist forces had very strong defensive positions. The Legion soon came under the defensive fire from Carlists who had taken up positions behind walls on either flank of the Legion. Despite General Iribarren ordering a battalion to the Legion's support, Colonel Conrad determined that the attack had little chance of success and ordered a retreat. The Legion was able to take about one third of their wounded in the retreat. However the Battle of Huesca proved to have had a substantial toll on the Legion's strength: 350 legionaries and 28 officers died in the battle.Jordan p.19 The timing of the Battle of Huesca was unfortunate as shortly thereafter the enlistments of nearly 1,000 men ran out. This departure of so many men combined with the casualties from Huesca reduced the Legion's strength to a single battalion. The Legion was positioned on the right flank of the Spanish army's line of battle and in a coincidence, the Legion fought a force of foreign volunteers and mercenaries in Carlist employ. The Spanish forces to the Legion's left broke rank and retreated under the Carlist onslaught, leaving the Legion encircled as it fought on.Porch p. 47-48 Colonel Conrad, attempting to rally his men to attack, proceeded out in front of his skirmish line inciting his men to march forward, however he was struck and killed by a bullet, becoming the first commander of the Foreign Legion to die in battle. Without a leader and demoralized, the Legion withdrew from the field. Following the death of Colonel Conrad, command of the Foreign Legion was assumed by Lieutenant-colonel Andrè Camille Ferray.Porch p. 48-49 The Legion finally returned to France in January 1839 with only 63 officers and 159 enlisted remaining of the original 4,000 men who were deployed to Spain. Second Deployment to Algeria A Foreign Legionnaire in Algeria In 1836 the French government decided that instead of deploying the reinforcements intended for the Foreign Legion to Spain, as the issue had become politically volatile, the intended reinforcements would be formed into a second Foreign Legion and deployed to Algeria.Jordan p. 19 By December 15, 1836, the first elements of the Foreign Legion, a battalion numbering around 1,600 men, had reached Algeria led by Major Bedeau.Porch p. 49 In 1839 many of the defeated Carlist forces sought refuge in France from retribution of the Spanish government.Porch p. 62-63 The French government resorted to a familiar method of unburdening itself of unwanted refugees, offering Carlist refugees enlistment in the Foreign Legion. On October 1, 1839, the 4th Battalion of the Foreign Legion was officially established at its depot at Pau from many of these refugees. By March 1840, three of its companies had arrived in Algiers with another five companies being organized in Algeria. On August 28, 1840, a 5th Battalion of the Foreign Legion was established by royal decree. The 5th Battalion began organizing near Perpignan; on October 3, the battalion staff and two companies of the 5th Battalion arrived at Algiers with the rest of the battalion arrived the next day. By December 30, 1840, there were five battalions in Algeria, leading the French government to reorganize the Legion's forces into two regiments with the 1st Regiment of the Foreign Legion stationed in Algiers and the 2nd Regiment of the Foreign Legion stationed in Constantine.Porch p. 75-77 The two regiments of the Legion operated largely independent of one another. When General Bugeaud assumed command of the Army of Africa and shifted the emphasis of operations in the theater to fast, mobile columns used to pursue the native insurgents through the Algerian countryside, the Foreign Legion responded positively to this new strategy and its overall quality began to improve. This improvement in quality was in part an effect of these mobile columns allowing the various battalions and companies of the Foreign Legion to be united under a single command as opposed to being dispersed throughout a multitude of defensive blockhouses and garrisons.Porch p. 87-88 This emphasis on mobility also required the Legion's officers to cover the same distances as their men, in effect causing them to lead by example, which served to raise the enlisted ranks' opinions of these officers. On March 15, 1844, the duc d'Aumale led a charge of men from the best companies of the 2nd Regiment at the village of M'chouneche in the Aures Mountains.Porch p. 86. The duc d'Aumale was sufficiently impressed by the performance of the Legionaries under his command that he requested that King Louis Philippe grant the regiment its own standard. The Revolutions of 1848 had little impact on the most of the Legion; however, the 2nd Regiment lost 618 men of Italian origin following a request of the Piedmontese ambassador to release nationals of his nation during the political turmoil.Porch p. 97 Crimean War The Foreign Legion received orders to prepare five battalions—three from the 1st Regiment and two from the 2nd Regiment—for service in the Crimean campaign.Porch p. 124-125 Two battalions would be drawn from each regiment to form an infantry brigade, while the third remaining battalion would be used as to establish and garrison depot for receiving supplies and reinforcements. The depot was established on the Gallipoli peninsula. Shortly after arriving at Gallipoli, a cholera epidemic broke out and killed over 200 legionnaires. For a while the Legion's brigade was held on station at the Gallipoli depot until eight companies were organized into a battalion de marche and assigned to General François Certain Canrobert's division which had also been afflicted by cholera. On September 14, 1854, the battalion de marche arrived at Calamita Bay. On September 20, the Legion's battalion de marche participated in the Battle of Alma. The battalion de marche acting as skirmishers engaged Russian forces for three hours before the Russians retired from the field. The battalion de marche was later disbanded and the reincorporated into their respective parent units in October as the rest of the Legion's forces arrived from Gallipoli. The reunited brigade was under the command of Brigadier Achille Bazaine. The brigade encamped in the heights near Strelitska Bay, which the French forces were using to land provision for the French forces in the region.W. Gordon. (1855) Balaclava and the Sevastopol Inquiry The Legionnaires there used to expand the allied entrenchments towards the Russian defensive lines.Porch p. 126-27 The Legion spent much of the ensuing months repelling harassing Russian raids against their positions. On May 1, 1855, Legion forces conducted a daring nighttime assault on a crucial heavy mortar battery in Russian lines. Following this and a few subsequent actions, the Foreign Legion largely spent its time engaged in engineering duties such as the construction of entrenchments and other defensive works. Once the Russians evacuated their forces from Sevastopol, the Legion was given the task of occupying the city's port.Lepage p.37 On March 3, 1856, the sound of a single cannon's solitary fire signaled an end to the war. By July the elements of the Legion which had deployed to the conflict in Crimea had returned to the headquarters of the Foreign Legion in Sidi Bel Abbès. Reorganization and return to Algeria =The Second Foreign Legion= In January 1855, Napoleon III decided to reorganize the structure of the foreign regiments in the service of France by raising an additional legion (2me Legion etrangére) of the foreign emigres.Lepage p37-38 This second Foreign Legion was to be entirely formed of Swiss volunteers. The regiment was planned to consist of five battalions with two regiments of infantry, each consisting of two battalions, and a battalion of riflemen (tirailleurs). However enthusiasm for enlistment in this new legion was below expectations and it soon was clear there would not be enough volunteers to fill the ranks of this Swiss legion as conceived. This lack of manpower stemmed from the fact that both France and Britain, in need of recruits, were competing for the Swiss volunteers.Porch, pp. 132–132 However, the French enlistment bonus offered to Swiss volunteers was twenty francs, which paled in comparison to the British 150 franc bonus. Ultimately France was able to recruit 1,600 men for the 2nd Foreign Legion, near a fifth of the number of men necessary for Napoleon III's plan. This led the French government to decide to disband the 1st Regiment of the Foreign Legion after the conclusion of the Crimean War, folding its battalions into the 2nd Foreign Regiment (2eme Régiment etrangère); the Swiss volunteers were then organized into a new 1st Foreign Regiment.Jordan pp. 21-22 As originally organized the 1st Foreign Regiment consisted of two infantry battalions and two companies of tirailleurs. =Return to Algeria= Following the Crimean War, the Foreign Legion returned to Algeria. Second Italian War of Independence The two Foreign Legion regiments took part in the war in Italy against the Austrians as a part of MacMahon's II Corps. When the Austrians declared war on Piedmont in April 1859, the 1st Foreign Regiment had been transferred to Corsica in hopes of bolstering its ranks with Corsican volunteers; by May the 1st Foreign Regiment arrived in Genoa.Porch p. 128 The 2nd Foreign Regiment arrived at Genoa in May as well having departed from Oran. A brigade was formed from the two regiments as the 1st Foreign Regiment was under-strength with only slight more than 600 men in its ranks. The Legion took part in the Battle of Magenta where the II Corps played an important part in the French victory and the Foreign Legion performed well. On June 7, 1859, the Legion forces in Italy entered the city of Milan to the delight of the Milanese. After the battle the under-strength 1st Foreign Regiment remained in Milan to recruit. Meanwhile, the 2nd Foreign Regiment took part in the French Army's two-week pursuit of the Austrians which culminated in a bloody French victory at Solferino. Mexico Battle of Camarón The creation of the Second Mexican Empire was the impetus for an expansion of the French Foreign Legion. One of Maximilian I's conditions for the acceptance of the Mexican throne was the provision of a corps of 10,000 European soldiers. The Foreign Legion was loaned by Napoleon III to the Crown of Mexico for this purpose. The Legion departed Sidi-bel-Abbes, crossing the Atlantic Ocean uneventfully, and made landfall at Veracruz, Veracruz, Mexico. The Foreign Legion was assigned to escort supply convoys in the Vera Cruz highlands. The strength of the Foreign Legion was depleted by yellow fever endemic to the region. It became necessary to quickly move the Legion elements inland to the healthier clime of Córdoba, Veracruz, however this was complicated by Mexican guerrillas harassing their movement. It was in Mexico on 30 April 1863 that the Legion earned its legendary status. A small infantry patrol led by Captain Jean Danjou, numbering 62 soldiers and 3 officers, was attacked and besieged by over a thousand Mexicans , organized in three battalions of infantry and cavalry, and was forced to make a defense in Hacienda Camarón. Despite the hopelessness of the situation, they fought nearly to the last man, with just three survivors and no ammunition and only the option to surrender, they fixed bayonets and attacked. The Mexican General was so impressed he assigned an honor guard to escort the body of Capitaine Danjou back to his battalion. Franco-Prussian War According to French law the Legion was not to be used within Metropolitan France, and thus, it was not a part of Napoleon III's Imperial Army that capitulated at Sedan. With the defeat of the Imperial Army, the Second French Empire fell and the Third Republic was created. The problem was that the new Third Republic was desperately short of trained soldiers, so the Legion was ordered to provide a contingent. On October 11, two provisional battalions disembarked at Toulon, the first time the Legion had been deployed in France itself. They attempted to lift the Siege of Paris by breaking through the German lines. They succeeded in re-taking Orléans, but failed to break the siege. Following the war the Legion assisted in suppressing the Paris Commune uprising.https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/12/french-foreign-legion- expendables Colonial warfare During the Third Republic, the Legion played a major role in French colonial expansion. They fought in North Africa (where they established their headquarters at Sidi-Bel-Abbès in Algeria), Madagascar, and Indochina, where they participated in the celebrated Siege of Tuyên Quang in 1885. Following the close of the Franco-Prussian War, the Ministry of War ordered the Foreign Legion be reduced to four battalions from its war strength of six battalions.Porch, p. 171 =Dahomey= Sino-French War A Foreign Legionnaire resting during the Siege of Tuyên Quang In December 1883, the 1st Battalion of the Foreign Legion participated in the capture of Sơn Tây. In May 1884 after a short French offensive campaign, France and China agreed that Chinese forces would be withdrawn from Tonkin. However, in June 1884, hostilities between France and China resumed at Lạng Sơn after a French force attempted to dislodge a Chinese garrison which had not withdrawn from the Tonkin region. Following the Chinese renewal of hostilities, French Prime Minister Jules Ferry began preparations for an invasion. In 1884 two battalions of the Foreign Legion were attached to the 4th Marching Regiment of the 2nd Brigade of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps during the Bắc Ninh Campaign. In November 1884, a column of 700 legionnaires under command of Lieutenant-colonel Jacques Duchesne, commanding officer of the 4th Marching Regiment, proceeded up the Lô River valley.Porch pp.207-13 The column assaulted a Chinese fortified position along a ridge south of Tuyên Quang. Then when the column reached Tuyên Quang and a garrison was established in the town; the garrison was composed primarily of Legion forces. The column departed Tuyên Quang on November 23, 1884 and the Tuyên Quang garrison was subsequently surrounded by Black Flag forces, marking the commencement of the Siege of Tuyên Quang. French military operations elsewhere in Indochina had been restricted by order of the French Minister of War Jean-Baptiste Campenon to the confines of the Red River Delta, however on January 3, 1885 Jules Louis Lewal succeeded Campenon as Minister of War.Porch pp. 214-15 This permitted General Louis Brière de l'Isle to organize the Lạng Sơn expeditionary column to clear resistance along the Mandarin Road, a route from Hanoi through Lạng Sơn up to the Chinese border. Elements of the Foreign Legion were part of the Lạng Sơn Expeditionary column, again as part of the 4th Marching Regiment. This relief column set north on campaign on February 3, 1884 and began encountering resistance by February 5. The French column assaulted Chinese defensive fortifications along the Mandarin Road, however this strategy proved imprudent as these fortifications proved costly to assault directly. During these assaults, one company of the Foreign Legion lost a third of its strength including its entire officer cadre and subsequent command of the company fell to its sergeant major. At the Battle of Đồng Đăng, a Foreign Legion battalion lead the vanguard of the French advance. =Siege of Tuyên Quang= The garrison at Tuyên Quang consisted of two Legion companies, a company of Tirailleurs Tonkinois, a detachment of engineers, and a detachment of artillery in the town totaling 619 men of which 390 were Foreign Legionnaires. The garrison at Tuyên Quang was commanded by Chef de Battalion Marc-Edmond Dominé of the Bataillon d'Afrique. The garrison at Tuyên Quang had been surrounded by Black Flag trench works by January 20.Porch pp.215- A failed Chinese night assault on the French position on January 26 led to the Chinese beginning of tunneling operations commencing on February 8 to mine the French positions. On February 8 the Chinese force was reinforced by an artillery battery. First World War United States nationals serving in the Foreign Legion in 1916 In World War I the Foreign Legion fought in many critical battles of the war, including the Battle of Verdun. The Foreign Legion was highly decorated for its efforts in the war. Many young Americans like Fred Zinn volunteered for the Legion when the war broke out in 1914. =Outbreak of the war= At the outbreak of World War I, the French Foreign Legion consisted of the 1st Foreign Regiment and the 2nd Foreign Regiment which were headquartered in Algeria at Sidi-bel-Abbès and Saida respectively.Windrow, Martin. (1999). French Foreign Legion 1914–1945.p3-. Osprey, Oxford. p.9. Each regiment consisted of six battalions of a 1000 men each; each regiment also had one or two Mounted Companies which, though attached to a regiment, effectively operated independently. Two companies from these regiments were garrisoned in French Indochina at the time. Also at the beginning of the war much of the Foreign Legion's strength was in Morocco as part of the French military activities there. The French military establishment did not predict the great numbers of volunteers for French military service which began arriving at French ports following the commencement of hostilities; this presented problem for the French army on both a legal and military level. At the time French law proscribed the enlistment of aliens in any part of the French armed forces other than as a standard five-year enlistment in the Foreign Legion, however that restriction was lifted on August 3, 1914, the Ministry of War issued a decree allowing foreign volunteers to enlist in the French Army for the duration of the war.Porch. p. 336- . Despite the French government's swift action to accommodate the influx of expatriate volunteers from a legal viewpoint, there still remained the matter of furnishing military training to the new recruits and organizing; Minister of War Adolphe Messimy determined that these men would be formed into provisional units dubbed marching regiments (régiments de marche) to be trained and led by a seasoned officer and NCO cadre drawn from the regiments in North Africa. It was decreed that the induction of foreign volunteers was to be delayed until twenty days after France had begun to mobilize its forces to avoid impeding the deployment of combat-ready units. Following the outbreak of the war, the French Foreign Legion found itself in a difficult predicament as approximately two-thirds of the Foreign Legion's strength consisted of German and Austrian volunteers.Mercer p. 209-212 The French High Command, uncertain of these Legionnaires' loyalty, ordered them to remain garrisoned in Algeria and Morocco. =Gallipoli Campaign = Legionnaires and Zouaves in camp at Sedd el Bahr in May 1915 during the Gallipoli Campaign In February 1915, a battalion of 600 Legionnaires designate, consisting mostly of veterans of North Africa, was organized to participate in the Gallipoli Campaign as part of the 1st Marching Regiment of Africa (1st Régiment de march d'Afrique or 1st RMdA) under the command of Lt. Col. Nigier which was in turn assigned to the 1st Infantry Division of the Eastern Expeditionary Corps.Lepage p.112 The newly organized battalion of Legionnaires was designated as the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Marching Regiment of Africa (III/RMdA) and consisted of four companies drawn from the 1st Foreign Regiment and the 2nd Foreign Regiment. On April 25, 1915 this battalion participated in the French landings at Kum Kale on the Asiatic shore of the Dardanelles as a diversionary attack to support the Allied Landing at Cape Helles.Mercer p215-16 Shortly after fighting to establish the French beachhead for the diversionary force, the 3rd Battalion was cut off in a valley facing the sea from the rest of the French forces until the Legionnaires could be relieved. The French forces at Kum Kale shortly thereafter withdrew from the Asiatic Shore and were redeployed in support of the British forces at Cape Helles. The French Forces were redeployed to the right flank of the Allied lines on the Gallipoli peninsula on April 27, 1915. This area had been designated as S Beach and since the initial landing combat in the vicinity had been extremely light. On April 28, the French forces participated in the First Battle of Krithia, acting as the Allied anchor on their right flank. In the Second Battle of Krithia the French advanced on the Turkish positions reaching their lines at Kereves Dere. By the end of June, the 3rd Battalion had been reduced to approximately 100 men under the command of the Adjutant-Chef Léon, a non- commissioned officer.Windrow. French Foreign Legion 1914–1945. p.9. In August 1915 a detachment of 700 reinforcements from French Indochina arrived on the peninsula to rebuild the rank and file of the battalion. By October 1915 the remains of the III/RMdA were withdrawn from the Gallipoli Peninsula to Salonika. =Balkan Campaign= At Salonika the 3rd Battalion and its parent regiment were assigned to the 156th Infantry Division which was preparing to participate in the upcoming Allied operations in Serbia. The 156th Infantry Division proceeded north to the Greek-Serbian border. The Legion forces in the III/RMdA saw action during the Monastir Offensive from September to November 1916. However the Legion forces in the Balkans spent the winter of 1915–16 waging a fighting retreat in the face of a Bulgarian advance. The 3rd Battalion also engaged in delaying actions at Dent de Scie and Trana Stena. The 3rd Battalion of the 1st Marching Regiment of Africa was disbanded on 1 October 1917. Rif War Legionnaires in Morocco, c. 1920 At the close of the First World War, the Foreign Legion's prestige was at a high; however, the Foreign Legion itself had suffered greatly in the trenches of the First World War.Porch p.382-3 In 1919, the government of Spain raised the Spanish Foreign Legion and modeled it after the French Foreign Legion. General Henri Mordacq intended to rebuild the Foreign Legion as a larger military formation, doing away with the Legion's traditional role as a solely infantry formation. General Mordacq envisioned a Foreign Legion consisting not of regiments, but of divisions with cavalry, engineer, and artillery regiments in addition to the Legion's infantry mainstay. In 1920, decrees ordained the establishment of regiments of cavalry and artillery regiments. Immediately following the armistice, the Foreign Legion experienced increased enlistment which continued for the next few years.Windrow Many of the new volunteers for the Foreign Legion were of German and Russian extraction: the former being mostly veterans of World War I and the latter consisting of veterans of the White Russian movement. The Foreign Legion began the process of reorganizing and redeploying to Algeria. Second World War =Influx of recruits= The Foreign Legion was heavily involved in World War II, playing a large role in the Middle East and the North African campaign. The 6th Foreign Infantry Regiment was established by consolidating battalions stationed in Syria into a single battalion on October 15, 1939.Porch p. 446-456 Around the beginning of the war the primary training camp of the Legion was located at Saïda, however by October 1939, another training camp was established at Bacarès near the Spanish border. The facility at Bacarès was re-purposed as training facility from an internment camp for Spanish refugees from the Spanish Civil War. Foreign Legion Forces being trained at these locations were provided inadequate arms and equipment – mostly surplus World War I-era equipment – which demonstrates the degree of low regard which the Foreign Legion by French military authorities. The 13th Foreign Legion Demi-Brigade was raised in February 1940 for the purpose of deploying to Finland. By February 1940, over 84,000 foreigners had volunteered to serve France which led to great organizational difficulties for the French Foreign Legion. During this time a large number of recruits in the Foreign Legion were Spanish Republicans and East European Jews, many of whom held their personal ideologies very close to their hearts causing difficulty in their assimilation into the Foreign Legion. Not only did political refugees from Spain and East Europe prove difficult to assimilate into the Legion, but so did many of the reservist, former Legionnaires who returned to the Legion when called up as they were no longer young men and had families to look after. Most of Foreign Legion remained in training until the Germans launched their offensive against France on May 10, 1940. =Battle of France= Six units of the French Foreign Legion participated in the Battle of France: the 11th Foreign Infantry Regiment, the 12th Foreign Infantry Regiment, the Reconnaissance Group of the 97th Infantry Division, the 21st Marching Regiment of Foreign Volunteers (21st RMVE), the 22nd Marching Regiment of Foreign Volunteers, and the 23rd Marching Regiment of Foreign Volunteers.Porch p. 458-464 The 11th REI defended the northern Inor Wood near Verdun from the German offensive early on in the battle until June 11, 1940 when the regiment began a fighting retreat to the south. By June 18, the 11th REI had lost three-fourths of its strength and the regiment withdrew to the south near Toul. The 12th REI was redeployed from its training center in Valbonne on May 11 to defend the Soissons where it arrived on May 24 and eventually began to fortify their positions. The 12 REI first experienced a form of combat for which they were unprepared when on June 5, the town of Soissons was the subject of German strafing from Stukas. By June 8, the 12th REI, in danger of being encircled, received orders to retreat to the south, however the orders did not come soon enough and parts of the 12th REI were surrounded at Soissons; the rest of the 12th REI made their way to Limoges by the signing of Second Armistice at Compiègne on June 25, 1940. By the surrender of France the 12th REI had lost 2,500 of its number. The 21st Marching Regiment of Foreign Volunteers was deployed to the Maginot Line when the German offensive began, but was shifted to the north of Verdun by the end of May. The 21st RMVE took heavy losses during an engagement with the Germans on June 8 and 9; the 21st RMVE joined the rest of the French Army in that sector in retreat when the order to retreat was given. At the time of the armistice the 21st RMVE was at Nancy where it was disarmed by German forces. The 22nd Marching Regiment of the Foreign Volunteers left its training depot at Bacarès on May 6 when it was deployed around Alsace. The German offensive forced the 22nd RMVE to be quickly redeployed on the Somme near the village of Marchélepot where it fought a defensive action from May 22 to May 26. On June 5, the 22nd RMVE was preparing to counterattack the Germans at Villers- Carbonnel alongside the 112th Infantry Division when it came under a heavy preemptive attack launched by German forces in the area. The French Forces were able to initially repulse the attack, but later succumbed to the German onslaught; the force of the Foreign Legion acquitted themselves admirably in that engagement. =The Narvik Expedition= In January 1940, French high command made the decision to deploy a brigade to assist Finland in its defense against the forces of the Soviet Union in the Winter War.Porch p.466 This new force, drawn from the ranks of the Foreign Legion's North African regiments, began the process of formation in February 1940 and was complete by March 27 when it took its new name as the 13th Demi-Brigade of the Foreign Legion. Despite the efficient establishment of the 13th Demi-Brigade of the Foreign Legion, the planned deployment of the unit was set back by the capitulation of Finland on March 12; absent the option to deploy to Finland, the Allies elected to deploy the expeditionary force they were forming for Finland to Norway. The 13th Demi-Brigade trained in Larzac until it shipped out to Scotland where it would deploy with a force assembled by the rest of the Allies. The expeditionary force deployed to northern Norway where it planned to engage the German forces holding Narvik. On May 13, 1940, the 13th Demi- Brigade participated in an amphibious assault on the shores of the Herjangs Fjord near Narvik. The amphibious assault was conducted on torpedo boats under strafing by German fighters. Once on the shore, Foreign Legion forces moved to secure the high ground around the landing zone. =The North African Campaign= Free French Foreign Legionnaires rush an enemy strong point during the Battle of Bir Hakeim in June 1942. The 13th Demi-Brigade was deployed in the Battle of Bir Hakeim. Part of the Legion was loyal to the Free French movement, yet another part was loyal to the Vichy government. A battle in Syria saw two opposing sides fight against each other in a short engagement, and later on the Vichy Legion joined its Free French brethren. First Indochina War Units of the Legion were involved in the defense of Dien Bien Phu during the First Indochina War and lost a large number of men in the battle. Towards the desperate end of the battle, Legionnaires formed the bulk of the volunteer relief force which were delivered by parachute to the base.

Post-colonial Sub-Saharan Africa French legionnaires outside of Kismaayo When the Front for the National Liberation of the Congo (Front de Libération Nationale Congolaise) took hostage approximately 3,000 European civilians at the village of Kolwezi, Zaire in May 1978, the French government deployed six hundreds legionnaires of the 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment to the region in conjunction with a force of Belgian paratroopers. Gulf War An honour guard from the French Foreign Legion's 6th Battalion In September 1990 the 2e REI, 6e REG and 1e REC were sent to the Persian Gulf as a part of Opération Daguet. The Legion force, comprising 27 different nationalities, was attached to the French 6th Light Armoured Brigade, whose mission was to protect the Coalition's left flank. After the four-week air campaign, coalition forces launched the ground war. They quickly penetrated deep into Iraq, with the Legion taking the Al Salman Airport, meeting little resistance. The war ended after a hundred hours of fighting on the ground, which resulted in very light casualties for the Legion. Afghanistan War Elements of the Foreign Legion have been deployed to Afghanistan in support of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force. Foreign Legion units have participated in ISAF operations in the Kapisa Province and Surobi District.  Number of soldiers served  The Foreign Legion, unlike other bodies of the French military recruitment which are exclusively male (e.g. submariners), receives no statutory provision prohibiting the recruitment of women. Nevertheless, and given the high selection rate commitment (the recruits are selected after three weeks of testing and about one in six candidate was hired in 2006), it does not recruit as legionnaire, than men. In contrast, a variable number of female officers and NCOs serve within it, as \\"frameworks of the general assigned to the Legion.\\" If these women wear the beret of the Institution, it does not carry the attributes of traditional (white cap, red epaulettes and green and blue belt). The status of military personnel serving abroad as is governed by the Decree of 12 September 2008. The latter has the repeal previous Order (No. 77-789 of July 1, 1977). At right is a plan of the Legion conducted in 1963 and establishing the national origin of more than 600,000 Legionnaires who served 1831 to 1961 . At one point, the main countries of origin of the foreign legion are highly correlated with current events at this time, allowing the Legion to escape a lot of hassle for those left behind in a war or a regime in trouble. There was a very large majority of Germans, esp. after World War II, Poles from the beginning and during wars, after etc. Moreover, the French have committed in another French nationality, which increases the figures for Belgium and Switzerland. An official site of recruitment has been established and specifies the conditions for recruitment into the Foreign Legion. As regards age limits, they range from age 17 (with parental consent) to 40 years.

The song is credited to singer Mick Jagger and guitarist Keith Richards (named Richard at the time). It's one of the few which feature both members sharing lead vocals. The song is more than seven minutes long, one of the longest by the Rolling Stones.Janovitz, Bill. [ The Rolling Stones \\"Memory Motel\\"]. allmusic. 2007 (accessed 24 April 2007). Memory Motel in Montauk that was said to be the inspiration for the song. Andy Warhol's Eothen complex in Montauk where the Stones were staying. Jagger began writing the song before beginning the Stones' Tour of the Americas '75 while staying with Richards at Andy Warhol's house in Montauk, New York and finished it while on tour. This is reflected in the song's lyrics where Jagger describes having to leave for Baton Rouge, where the Stones played two warm up shows at Louisiana State University, and where he describes subsequent experiences on the road. The title comes from an actual motel in Montauk, on Long Island. The lyrics to the song have long drawn speculation as to who the \\"Hannah baby\\" in the lyrics refer to. Carly Simon is often a name considered, due to Jagger's descriptions of the woman throughout the song. Jagger describes her thus: The lyrics talk of the fading love brought on by a one-night stand at said motel. The song describes the female subject as a strong, independent woman, comparable in many ways to the female subject of \\"Ruby Tuesday\\", with Richards repeated refrain: Richards did not play guitar on the track, but contributed co-lead vocals alongside Jagger; Black and Blue has long been known as the album used to find a replacement for lead guitarist Mick Taylor, who left right before work was to begin on it. Harvey Mandel plays electric guitar while Wayne Perkins performs acoustic. Jagger, Richards, and Billy Preston play acoustic piano, electric piano, and string synthesizer on the song, respectively. Preston also contributes backing vocals along with Ron Wood, who would eventually become the Stones' lead guitarist. The song was recorded in Munich, Germany at Musicland Studios in March and April 1975. Overdubs and re- recordings were performed later in the year. A live version appeared on the Stones' 1998 live album No Security, where Dave Matthews took up lead vocals with Jagger and Richards.

The concept was first proposed around 1992 by Stan Shih, the founder of Acer Inc., an IT company headquartered in Taiwan. According to Shih's observation, in the personal computer industry, the two ends of the value chain - conception and marketing - command higher values added to the product than the middle part of the value chain - manufacturing. If this phenomenon is presented in a graph with a Y-axis for value-added and an X-axis for value chain (stage of production), the resulting curve appears like a \\"smile\\". Based on this model, the Acer company adopted a business strategy to reorient itself from manufacturing into global marketing of brand-name PC-related products and services. Acer accordingly invested heavily in R&D; to develop innovative technology. The concept later became widely cited to describe the distribution of value-adding potentials in other types of industry to justify business strategies aimed at higher value-adding activities. Theory origins =Pursuing the new trend= Although the smile curve theory is very simple but it points out the future direction of Taiwan’s industrial efforts, the only way is moving and positioning towards high value-adding block through the guidance of value- adding concept, therefore, the industry can continue the development and sustainable management. Although the construction is one of the locomotive industry, but under a mature industrial trend, market saturation and traditional manufacturing which only concerned low value-adding area, has experienced a decade of economic downturn. Smiling curve theory can provide a new thinking direction. =Diagram illustration= Smiling Curve The most lucrative value area focus on both ends of the value chain – R&D; and marketing. The only thing can do is just agency or OEM without R&D; capability, which earn a little money; Without marketing ability, the product will only be treated as rubbish over disposal period. =Realizing the fact= BYD's Wang once lamented that Chinese companies had only learned how to organize workers, but have not learned how to organize engineers, it can only make a living in the most inhospitable terrain area of the manufacturing. If it can use advanced methods to organize a large number of Chinese Engineers, then China is the entrepreneur's treasure. Typically, knowledge- intensive organizations can find ways to organize engineers. Management master Peter Drucker said: \\"The most important management in the 21st century is to manage those intelligent workers.\\" Which is the most successful aspect that Huawei has done among the Chinese companies. Among those employees, technology research and developing staff accounted for 46%, marketing and service staff accounted for 33%, management and other personnel accounted for 9%, and the remaining 12% is workers. For 20 years, Huawei has maintained this ratio, human resource allocation shows “high developing and marketing on both sides\\" of the \\"smile curve.\\" Theory pressure Stan Shih ‘s smiling curve is promoted in order to reproducing Acer. However, there must be some breed factors. Some of the factors behind the birth may exist as follows: =Competitive pressure of globalization= Under the trend of globalization of high-tech product markets, we can use the \\"chase, catch, run, jump, touch\\" five words to describe the competitive pressures of the industry. Competitive enterprises continue to catch up, ready to catch up with the leaders, and those leading companies continue to run forward in order to stay ahead of the distance, and finding methods to jump over the barriers. Therefore, the market becomes saturated, only head-on, make price competition, even bloody competition exist. This is the fate of global competition, only the fittest survive. =Pressure of product life period= High-tech products, unless mastering the key technologies or components, among the finished product market, because the fast speed of technology development, fashion also changes quickly, product life periods are changing rapidly, so-called niche products, sometimes become a few % of the profit gross during a few years, therefore generating tremendous pressure on enterprises. =Survival Pressure of enterprises= Under the pressure of the foregoing, if technology cannot always be upgraded, strategy cannot leading the market, then under the less profit situation, may turn into a loss, more seriously, even gradually affecting the survival of the enterprise. =Pressure of value-added= The value-added of an enterprise can be said that the potential for profit. Mature technology, low requirement to entry, and universalization of technology is easy to become so-called \\"low-profit\\" enterprise, also known as low-value- added industries. Normal manufacturing, assembly enterprise is called low- value-added industries, in order to survive, only to keep expanding production capacity to maintain profits. But as long as the market is shrinking, product prices is decreasing, product sales will no longer growing. Enterprise will face to risk immediately. Theory factors =Trend of industries development= In order to overcome the pressure of low added value, enterprises only thinking is to move toward the block which high-value added industry trends. In the industry, mastering the key technology and key components is high added value; general manufacturing or OEM is low added value; product integration services, due to combine a lot of added value, therefore becoming another high-value-added block. =Needs of industrial developing environment= Among the blocks of high value-added, the key technologies and key components, may sold to various needs of world market; but integrated services, need to have an appropriate area, and entire industry in this region also has reached considerable development. =Conclusion= Enterprises Enterprise’s products and services need to have sustained value-added (earnings), so that can be able to survive. Products The direction and services of high value-added products is only way to have a high potential for profit, therefore to ensure business continuity. Applications Inspiration =The success of products= Smile curve theory has basically proved that the success of products is inextricably related to concept, research, brand spreading and marketing. Those factors require the company hire and retain highly skilled, intelligent, professionals. Typically, those professionals will be highly paid, so that countries with high smile curve slope will get more profits, therefore generating growing gaps between countries. =Compare with developing and development countries = Like United States and other developed countries, they have maintained highly slope of the smile curve, however, developing countries such as India and China confined to low-level employing and manufacturing. Therefore, if developing countries want to achieve to highly slope of the smile curve, they need more professional analysts, researchers and brand developers to reach higher levels of economic growth. In other words, if developing countries want to compete with developed countries equally, they must require a highly skilled and knowledge team in order to achieve these, government needs to invest heavily and support on basic education and higher education. In the long-term development, manufacturing country in the world will hardly to sustain the level of economic growth. Developing countries need to let the smiling curve more smile, therefore there will be a fair competition with developed countries. Related to industry =Developing countries= Some developing countries have begun the development of trade and investment liberalization, and the company's internal production network has become globalized. Depending on the strengths of each country, manufacturing form of the developing countries are generally labor-intensive, which means that they only provided low-wage to workers, but those high-tech jobs, such as research and development, are to be borne by the developed countries. = Horizontal division of labor= The current situation is that between developed and developing countries, there are many flowing products and intermediate goods. This phenomenon which cooperating among the same industry is known as horizontal division of labor. However, the more accurate name is called vertical division of labor. However, because there are various ways of processes between developed and developing countries, developed countries always focus on high-value process while developing countries always focus on low-value-added processes. = Traditional manufacturing= Fareed Zakaria's writings mentioned, the significance of China and their traditional manufacturing dominance, China's manufacturing industry is in the middle stages, so that means production, plus some spare parts supply and engineering design. However, developed countries such as the United States has two complete form, so that is generated smiley curve, the curve shows the value added profits at every stage, and brand and product concepts at high point, the manufacturing industry is located below, values in the retail and service phases rise again. With the end of the Cold War and the former socialist countries into the global economy, there was more and more cheap labor, while developing countries have been watching their profits decline, then resulting in fierce competition. Therefore, increasing the slope of the smile curve. Theory phenomenon Smile curve assumes a phenomenon, in the middle of the process of value-added profits or assembly-type manufacturing value chain is assembled, these processes have a downward trend, which increases at both ends of these processes of the value chain, are the raw material at one end of chain and at the other sales service. This assumption has caused an intense global competition which increasing in the assembly of standardized and modular components. =Use of report= Report examines the assembly-type manufacturing value chain and the formation of the smile curve. Because it use the ratio of the profit as a performance indicator. All the sources of products produced broader concept in industrial processes. Input-output tables and each firm's annual financial statements were used to calculate total assets and operating surplus. =Analyze six sectors= The assembly-type manufacturing industry also can be analyzed from: #household electronic appliances, #household electric appliances, #electronic computing equipment and accessory devices, #communications equipment, #passenger motor cars, #trucks, buses and other vehicles. In this research, the smile curve explained the household electronic appliances, computer equipment and ancillary equipment, as well as the three sectors trucks, buses and other vehicles. However, the smile curve cannot explain the other three sectors, and assembly- type manufacturing industry as a whole. Successful example  ‘Clockwise’ company is one of the smiling curve practitioners, founded in 1991. Turning occurred in 2004, this year, the ‘Clockwise’ pay all attention on cotton underwear industry, formed a strategic alliance with Colored Cotton Group, controlled famous brand cotton \\"Choi days” upstream resources, meanwhile use media to publish brand. ‘Clockwise’ business total sales breakthrough billion yuan, became the industry leader.

Copper was discovered on Virgin Gorda. Local legends also suggest the shafts were dug by Spanish adventurers to mine silver in the late fifteenth century, but no documentary evidence can be found to support this theory, and no firm evidence of Spanish occupation of the islands prior to the Dutch settlement exists, much less the size of settlement which would be needed to sink shafts. After the islands came under British control, the Copper Mine was constructed in 1837 and its first shaft was sunk in 1838. In two separate periods over the next 24 years, 36 Cornish miners extracted ore from this site with the aid of some 140 British Virgin Islands workmen. The ore which was extracted was sent by road to Spanish Town (the largest settlement and harbour on Virgin Gorda) along coppermine road (originally built by the miners), and then by ship to Wales and; on the return trip the ships would carry provisions, wood for construction, wages for the workers, and coal with which to power their steam engine. The mine was abandoned in 1862 and was never reopened. Parts of the original stack, the engine house, and the main building are all that remain. Several of the Cornish miners started families with native women and there are descendants living in the Virgin Islands to this day. No plans are known to exist of the workings, however, it was recorded that by 1869 they were at a depth of 40 fathoms (240 ft) and that the levels extended under the sea. Beam engine The beam engine at the Virgin Gorda copper mine is the oldest surviving Cornish beam engine in the world. The engine and beam were manufactured by the Perran Foundry, Cornwall, in 1836 and brought to the site in 1840 having previously worked at a mine in Cornwall. The beam is now located on the beach in Handsome Bay, Virgin Gorda. The engine was of typical Cornish construction with a cylinder of 40 inches. It was the workhorse of the mine, being used to pump water from the mine, raise the copper ore up the shafts and to power the ore-dressing machinery. A Cornish boiler produced steam to drive the engine. These boilers were the first to use high-pressure steam and were invented in 1815 by the Cornish engineer Richard Trevithick (who also invented the first steamroad locomotive). Today The Copper Mine is a protected site and tourist attraction. However, it is in a perilous state, and sits in a position which is particularly exposed to hurricanes. The Copper Mine Committee, in cooperation with the National Parks Trust of the British Virgin Islands, has undertaken to reconstruct the site using the footprint of the buildings and plans developed by archaeologists familiar with the work of these Cornish miners and their engineers. However, such plans have not been implemented. Minerals Notwithstanding the abandoning of the mine, rich veins of copper are still visible on the point today, although not remotely in the quantities which would make modern commercial mining economic. Also, lying loosely around the site are various other rock specimens, including malachite, carbonate of copper; quartz containing copper-iron sulfide; and molybdenite. It has been suggested that a local cottage industry could have started making semiprecious jewellery.

The mujahideen were also supported by Britain's MI6, who conducted separate covert actions. The program leaned heavily towards supporting militant Islamic groups, including groups with jihadist ties, that were favored by the regime of Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq in neighboring Pakistan, rather than other, less ideological Afghan resistance groups that had also been fighting the Marxist-oriented Democratic Republic of Afghanistan regime since before the Soviet intervention.Bergen, Peter, Holy War Inc., Free Press, (2001), p.68 Operation Cyclone was one of the longest and most expensive covert CIA operations ever undertaken. Funding officially began with $695,000 in 1979, was increased dramatically to $20–$30 million per year in 1980, and rose to $630 million per year in 1987, described as the \\"biggest bequest to any Third World insurgency.\\"https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1081&context;=psilr Funding continued (albeit reduced) after the 1989 Soviet withdrawal as the mujahideen continued to battle the forces of President Mohammad Najibullah's army during the Afghan Civil War (1989–1992).Crile, p 519 & elsewhere Background Communists under the leadership of Nur Muhammad Taraki seized power in Afghanistan on 27 April 1978. The new regime—which was divided between Taraki's extremist Khalq faction and the more moderate Parcham—signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union in December of that year. Taraki's efforts to improve secular education and redistribute land were accompanied by mass executions (including many conservative religious leaders) and political oppression unprecedented in Afghan history, igniting a revolt by mujahideen rebels. Following a general uprising in April 1979, Taraki was deposed by Khalq rival Hafizullah Amin in September. Amin was considered a \\"brutal psychopath\\" by foreign observers; the Soviets were particularly alarmed by the brutality of the late Khalq regime, and suspected Amin of being an agent of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), although that was not the case. In the mid-1970s, Pakistani intelligence officials began privately lobbying the U.S. and its allies to send material assistance to the Islamist insurgents. Pakistani President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's ties with the U.S. had been strained during Jimmy Carter's presidency due to Pakistan's nuclear program and the execution of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in April 1979, but Carter told National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski and Secretary of State Cyrus Vance as early as January 1979 that it was vital to \\"repair our relationships with Pakistan\\" in light of the unrest in Iran. According to former CIA official Robert Gates, \\"the Carter administration turned to CIA ... to counter Soviet and Cuban aggression in the Third World, particularly beginning in mid-1979.\\" In March 1979, \\"CIA sent several covert action options relating to Afghanistan to the SCC [Special Coordination Committee]\\" of the United States National Security Council. At a 30 March meeting, U.S. Department of Defense representative Walter B. Slocombe \\"asked if there was value in keeping the Afghan insurgency going, 'sucking the Soviets into a Vietnamese quagmire?'\\" When asked to clarify this remark, Slocombe explained: \\"Well, the whole idea was that if the Soviets decided to strike at this tar baby [Afghanistan] we had every interest in making sure that they got stuck.\\" But a 5 April memo from National Intelligence Officer Arnold Horelick warned: \\"Covert action would raise the costs to the Soviets and inflame Moslem opinion against them in many countries. The risk was that a substantial U.S. covert aid program could raise the stakes and induce the Soviets to intervene more directly and vigorously than otherwise intended.\\" In May 1979, U.S. officials secretly began meeting with rebel leaders through Pakistani government contacts. A former Pakistani military official claimed that he personally introduced a CIA official to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar that month (Freedom of Information Act requests for records describing these meetings have been denied). Additional meetings were held on 6 April and 3 July, and on the same day as the second meeting, Carter signed a \\"presidential 'finding'\\" that \\"authorized the CIA to spend just over $500,000\\" on non-lethal aid to the mujahideen, which \\"seemed at the time a small beginning.\\" By December 1979, Amin's government had lost control of much of the Afghanistan, prompting the Soviet Union to invade the country, execute Amin, and install Parcham leader Babrak Karmal as president. Brzezinski later claimed that \\"We didn't push the Russians to intervene, but we knowingly increased the probability that they would.\\"David N. Gibbs, \\"Afghanistan: The Soviet Invasion in Retrospect\\" International Politics 37:233 - 246, June 2000cf. According to Brzezinski, he became convinced by mid-1979 that the Soviets were going to invade Afghanistan regardless of U.S. policy due to the Carter administration's failure to respond aggressively to Soviet activity in Africa, but—despite the risk of unintended consequences—support for the mujahideen could be an effective way to prevent Soviet aggression beyond Afghanistan (particularly in Brzezinski's native Poland). The full significance of the U.S. sending aid to the mujahideen prior to the invasion is debated among scholars. Some assert that it directly, and even deliberately, provoked the Soviets to send in troops. Bruce Riedel, however, believes that the U.S. aid was intended primarily to improve U.S. relations with Pakistan, while Steve Coll asserts: \\"Contemporary memos—particularly those written in the first days after the Soviet invasion—make clear that while Brzezinski was determined to confront the Soviets in Afghanistan through covert action, he was also very worried the Soviets would prevail. ... Given this evidence and the enormous political and security costs that the invasion imposed on the Carter administration, any claim that Brzezinski lured the Soviets into Afghanistan warrants deep skepticism.\\" cf. Carter himself has stated that encouraging a Soviet invasion was \\"not my intention.\\" Gates recounted: \\"No one in the Carter Administration wanted the Soviets to invade Afghanistan and no one, as I can recall at least, ever advocated attempting to induce them to invade ... Only after the Soviet invasion did some advocate making the Soviets 'bleed' in their own Vietnam.\\" Carter expressed surprise at the December 1979 invasion. According to Riedel, the consensus of the U.S. intelligence community during 1978 and 1979—reiterated as late as 29 September 1979—was that \\"Moscow would not intervene in force even if it appeared likely that the Khalq government was about to collapse.\\" Indeed, Carter's diary entries from November 1979 until the Soviet invasion in late December contain only two short references to Afghanistan, and are instead preoccupied with the ongoing hostage crisis in Iran. In the West, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was considered a threat to global security and the oil supplies of the Persian Gulf. Moreover, the failure to accurately predict Soviet intentions caused American officials to reappraise the Soviet threat to both Iran and Pakistan, although it is now known that those fears were overblown. For example, U.S. intelligence closely followed Soviet exercises for an invasion of Iran throughout 1980, while an earlier warning from Brzezinski that \\"if the Soviets came to dominate Afghanistan, they could promote a separate Baluchistan ... [thus] dismembering Pakistan and Iran\\" took on new urgency. In the aftermath of the invasion, Carter was determined to respond vigorously. In a televised speech, he announced sanctions on the Soviet Union, promised renewed aid to Pakistan, and committed the U.S. to the Persian Gulf's defense. Carter also called for a boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, which raised a bitter controversy. British prime minister Margaret Thatcher enthusiastically backed Carter's tough stance, although British intelligence believed \\"the CIA was being too alarmist about the Soviet threat to Pakistan.\\" Although Gates described Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) Stansfield Turner and the CIA's Directorate of Operations (DO) as contemplating \\"several enhancement options\\"—up to and including the direct provision of arms from the U.S. to the mujahideen through the ISI—as early as late August 1979, and an unnamed Brzezinski aide acknowledged in conversation with Selig S. Harrison that the U.S.'s nominally \\"non-lethal\\" assistance to the mujahideen included facilitating arms shipments by third-parties, Coll, Harrison, Riedel, and the head of the DO's Near East–South Asia Division at the time—Charles Cogan—all state that no U.S.-supplied arms intended for the mujahideen reached Pakistan until January 1980, after Carter amended his presidential finding to include lethal provisions in late December 1979. The thrust of U.S. policy for the duration of the war was determined by Carter in early 1980: Carter initiated a program to arm the mujahideen through Pakistan's ISI and secured a pledge from Saudi Arabia to match U.S. funding for this purpose. U.S. support for the mujahideen accelerated under Carter's successor, Ronald Reagan, at a final cost to U.S. taxpayers of some $3 billion. The decision to route U.S. aid through Pakistan led to massive fraud, as weapons sent to Karachi were frequently sold on the local market rather than delivered to the Afghan rebels; Karachi soon \\"became one of the most violent cities in the world.\\" Pakistan also controlled which rebels received assistance: Of the seven mujahideen groups supported by Zia's government, four espoused Islamic fundamentalist beliefs—and these fundamentalists received most of the funding. Despite this, Carter has expressed no regrets over his decision to support what he still considers the \\"freedom fighters\\" in Afghanistan. Program A mujahideen resistance fighter shoots an SA-7, 1988. Key proponents of the initial program were Texas Congressman Charlie Wilson; Michael G. Vickers, a young CIA paramilitary officer; and Gust Avrakotos, the CIA's regional head, who developed a close relationship with Wilson. Their strategy was to provide a broad mix of weapons, tactics, and logistics, along with training programs, to enhance the rebels' ability to fight a guerilla war against the Soviets. Initially, to avoid detection of U.S. involvement, the program supplied the rebels only with Soviet-made weaponry. This plan was enabled by the tacit support of Israel, which had captured large stockpiles of Soviet-made weaponry during the Yom Kippur War and agreed to sell them to the CIA clandestinely, as well as Egypt, which had recently modernized its army with weapons purchased from Western nations, funneling the older Soviet-made arms to the mujahideen.

Atlantic Monthly Press, page 246, 285 and 302\\"Sorry Charlie this is Michael Vickers's War\\", Washington Post, 27 December 2007 After 1985, as the Reagan administration announced that it would support anti-Soviet resistance movements globally (in what is now known as the Reagan doctrine), there was no longer a need to obfuscate the origin of the weaponry; Pentagon senior official, Michael Pillsbury, successfully advocated providing U.S.-made weaponry, including large numbers of Stinger missiles, to the Afghan resistance. The distribution of the weaponry relied heavily on the Pakistani President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, who had a personal relationship to Congressman Wilson. His Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) was an intermediary for funds distribution, passing of weapons, military training and financial support to Afghan resistance groups.Pakistan's Foreign Policy: an Overview 1974-2004.

Good Guys, Bad Guys. 13 June 1997. the ISI armed and trained over 100,000 insurgents between 1978 and 1992 . They encouraged the volunteers from the Arab states to join the Afghan resistance in its struggle against the Soviet troops based in Afghanistan. MI6 supported one of the hardline Islamic groups commanded by Ahmad Shah Massoud, who they saw as an effective fighter. Despite the CIA's doubts on Massoud, he became a key MI6 ally; MI6 sent an annual mission of two of their officers as well as military instructors to Massoud and his fighters. Of the weapons given covertly - most were old British army Lee Enfields, some of which were purchased from Indian Army stocks, which proved popular amongst the Afghan resistance groups. Limpet mines, explosives, radios, intelligence, and around fifty Blowpipe Missile launchers with 300 Missiles were sent to the Afghan resistance. The Special Air Service meanwhile gave the resistance vital training inside and outside of Afghanistan. All support to the Sunni Mujahideen was funneled through the government of Pakistan, given that the Shiite Mujahideen had close ties to Iran at the time. Given American-Iranian tensions during the period, the US government aided solely the Sunni Mujahideen in Afghanistan. Reports show civilian personnel from the U.S. Department of State and the CIA frequently visited the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area during this time, and the US contributed generously to aiding Afghan refugees. CIA director William Casey secretly visited Pakistan numerous times to meet with the ISI officers managing the mujahideen, and personally observed the guerrillas training on at least one occasion. Coll reports that > Casey startled his Pakistani hosts by proposing that they take the Afghan > war into enemy territory  into the Soviet Union itself. Casey wanted to > ship subversive propaganda through Afghanistan to the Soviet Union's > predominantly Muslim southern republics. The Pakistanis agreed, and the CIA > soon supplied thousands of Korans, as well as books on Soviet atrocities in > Uzbekistan and tracts on historical heroes of Uzbek nationalism, according > to Pakistani and Western officials. Other direct points of contact between the US government and mujahideen include the CIA flying Hekmatyar to the United States,Anna Mulrine, \\"Afghan Warlords, Formerly Backed By the CIA, Now Turn Their Guns On U.S. Troops\\" US World and News Report, July 11, 2008 where he was hosted by State Department official Zalmay Khalizad. Hekmatyar was invited to meet with President Reagan but refused, and was replaced at the White House's October 1985 conference with mujahideen by Younis Khalis, who publicly invited Reagan to convert to Islam. CIA agent Howard Hart developed a personal relationship with Abdul Haq which led to the Afghan meeting both Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Armitage regularly met with mujahideen, particularly Burhanuddin Rabbani. CIA agents are also known to have given direct cash payments to Jalaluddin Haqqani. The U.S.-built Stinger antiaircraft missile, supplied to the mujahideen in very large numbers beginning in 1986, struck a decisive blow to the Soviet war effort as it allowed the lightly armed Afghans to effectively defend against Soviet helicopter landings in strategic areas. The Stingers were so renowned and deadly that, in the 1990s, the U.S. conducted a \\"buy-back\\" program to keep unused missiles from falling into the hands of anti-American terrorists. This program may have been covertly renewed following the U.S. intervention in Afghanistan in late 2001, out of fear that remaining Stingers could be used against U.S. forces in the country. Reagan's program assisted in ending the Soviet occupation in Afghanistan,Victory: The Reagan Administration's Secret Strategy That Hastened the Collapse of the Soviet Union (Paperback) by Peter Schweizer, Atlantic Monthly Press, 1994 page 213 with the Soviets unable to quell the insurgency. On 20 July 1987, the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the country was announced pursuant to the negotiations that led to the Geneva Accords of 1988, with the last Soviets leaving on 15 February 1989. Soviet forces suffered over 14,000 killed and missing, and over 50,000 wounded. The withdrawal helped precipitate the dissolution of the Soviet Union itself. =Funding= President Reagan meeting with Afghan Mujahideen leaders in the Oval Office in 1983 The U.S. offered two packages of economic assistance and military sales to support Pakistan's role in the war against the Soviet troops in Afghanistan. The first six-year assistance package (1981–87) amounted to US$3.2 billion, equally divided between economic assistance and military sales. The U.S. also sold 40 F-16 aircraft to Pakistan during 1983–87 at a cost of $1.2 billion outside the assistance package. The second six-year assistance package (1987–93) amounted to $4.2 billion. Out of this, $2.28 billion were allocated for economic assistance in the form of grants or loan that carried the interest rate of 2–3 per cent. The rest of the allocation ($1.74 billion) was in the form of credit for military purchases. More than $20 billion in U.S. funds were funneled into the country to train and arm the Afghan resistance groups. The program funding was increased yearly due to lobbying by prominent U.S. politicians and government officials, such as Charles Wilson, Gordon Humphrey, Fred Ikle, and William Casey. Under the Reagan administration, U.S. support for the Afghan mujahideen evolved into a centerpiece of U.S. foreign policy, called the Reagan Doctrine, in which the U.S. provided military and other support to anti-communist resistance movements in Afghanistan, Angola, and Nicaragua. The mujahideen benefited from expanded foreign military support from the United States, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, United Kingdom and other Muslim nations. Saudi Arabia in particular agreed to match dollar for dollar the money the CIA was sending to the Mujahideen. When Saudi payments were late, Wilson and Avrakotos would fly to Saudi Arabia to persuade the monarchy to fulfil its commitments.Crile, see index Levels of support to the various Afghan factions varied. The ISI tended to favor vigorous Islamists like Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami and Haqqani. Some Americans agreed.Edward Girardet, Killing the Cranes, 2010, Chelsea Green However others favored the relative moderates like Ahmed Shah Massoud. These included two Heritage Foundation foreign policy analysts, Michael Johns and James A. Phillips, both of whom championed Massoud as the Afghan resistance leader most worthy of US support under the Reagan Doctrine. Aftermath After the withdrawal of Soviet troops, the U.S. shifted its interest from Afghanistan. American funding of Hekmatyar and his Hezb-i-Islami party was cut off immediately.Kepel, Jihad, (2002) The U.S. also reduced its assistance for Afghan refugees in Pakistan. In October 1990, U.S. President George H. W. Bush refused to certify that Pakistan did not possess a nuclear explosive device, triggering the imposition of sanctions against Pakistan under the Pressler Amendment (1985) to the Foreign Assistance Act (1961). This disrupted the second assistance package offered in 1987 and discontinued economic assistance and military sales to Pakistan with the exception of the economic assistance already on its way to Pakistan. Military sales and training programs were abandoned as well and some of the Pakistani military officers under training in the U.S. were asked to return home. As late as 1991 Charlie Wilson persuaded the House Intelligence Committee to continue the funding of the Mujahideen, providing them with $200 million for fiscal year 1992. With the matching funds from Saudi Arabia, this amounted to $400 million for that year. Afghan tribes were also delivered weapons which the US captured from Iraq in the Gulf War. Criticism Critics assert that funding the mujahideen played a role in causing the 11 September attacks. The U.S. government has been criticized for allowing Pakistan to channel a disproportionate amount of its funding to the controversial Hekmatyar,Bergen, Peter, Holy War Inc., Free Press, (2001), p.67 whom Pakistani officials believed was \\"their man\\".Graham Fuller in interview with Peter Bergen, Bergen, Peter, Holy War Inc., Free Press, (2001), p.68 Hekmatyar has been criticized for killing other mujahideen and attacking civilian populations, including shelling Kabul with American- supplied weapons, causing 2,000 casualties. Hekmatyar was said to be friendly with Osama bin Laden, founder of al-Qaeda, who was running an operation for assisting \\"Afghan Arab\\" volunteers fighting in Afghanistan, called Maktab al- Khadamat. Alarmed by his behavior, Pakistan leader General Zia warned Hekmatyar, \\"It was Pakistan that made him an Afghan leader and it is Pakistan who can equally destroy him if he continues to misbehave.\\"Henry S. Bradsher, Afghan Communism and Soviet Interventions, Oxford University Press, 1999, p.185 The CIA and State Department have been criticized for publishing textbooks intended to indoctrinate children with racism and hatred towards foreigners and towards non-muslim Afghans. The CIA and State Department have been criticized for their direct relationship with Hekmatyar, beyond ISI contact, in spite of his being one of the leading heroin smugglers in the region. In the late 1980s, Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto, concerned about the growing strength of the Islamist movement, told President George H. W. Bush, \\"You are creating a Frankenstein.\\"\\"The Road to September 11\\". Evan Thomas. Newsweek. 1 October 2001. Critics assert that funding the mujahideen played a role in causing the September 11 attacks and a number of political commentators have described Al-Qaeda attacks as \\"blowback\\" or an unintended consequence of American aid to the mujahideen. Alleged connections of CIA assistance to Bin Laden Some have alleged that bin Laden and al Qaeda were beneficiaries of CIA assistance. This is challenged by experts such as Coll—who notes that declassified CIA records and interviews with CIA officers do not support such claims—and Peter Bergen, who argues: \\"The theory that bin Laden was created by the CIA is invariably advanced as an axiom with no supporting evidence.\\" Bergen insists that U.S. funding went to the Afghan mujahideen, not the Arab volunteers who arrived to assist them. However, Sir Martin Ewans noted that the Afghan Arabs \\"benefited indirectly from the CIA's funding, through the ISI and resistance organizations,\\" and that \\"it has been reckoned that as many as 35,000 'Arab-Afghans' may have received military training in Pakistan at an estimated cost of $800 million in the years up to and including 1988.\\" Some of the CIA's greatest Afghan beneficiaries were Arabist commanders such as Haqqani and Hekmatyar who were key allies of bin Laden over many years. Haqqani—one of bin Laden's closest associates in the 1980s—received direct cash payments from CIA agents, without the mediation of the ISI. This independent source of funding gave Haqqani disproportionate influence over the mujahideen. Haqqani and his network played an important role in the formation and growth of al Qaeda, with Jalalhuddin Haqqani allowing bin Laden to train mujahideen volunteers in Haqqani territory and build extensive infrastructure there.

There are numerous versions of this tale. Some versions say Bernardo Carpio is a giant, as supported by the enormous footsteps he has reputedly left behind in the mountains of Montalban. Others say he was the size of an ordinary man. Accounts of the stories have pre- colonial origins, but the name of the hero was Hispanized during the Spanish colonization. The original name of the hero has been lost in time. All versions of the story agree that Bernardo Carpio had a strength that was similar to that of many strong men-heroes in Asian epics, such as Lam-ang. Basic legend The basic form of the legend is that Bernardo Carpio, a being of great strength, is trapped in between two great rocks in the Mountains of Montalban. Some versions say he is keeping the mountains from crashing into each other (similar to the Greek titan Atlas holding up the sky), and some versions say he is trapped and trying to break free. When Bernardo Carpio shrugs his shoulder, an earthquake occurs. As a revolutionary against Spanish occupation According to one version of the tale, Bernardo Carpio was a son of Infante Jimena and Don Sancho Díaz of Cerdenia. The Infante was cloistered by her brother King Alfonso, who at that time was very powerful, because of her forbidden love with Don Sancho. Don Sancho was incarcerated, and his eyes were to be plucked out. Bernardo was left to the care of Don Rubio, who divulged the love affair. The Spanish hired a local engkantado (shaman) and conspired to trap Carpio through supernatural means. Calling for a parley, they lured him towards a cave in the mountains of Montalban. The engkantado used his agimat (talisman), and Bernardo Carpio was caught between two boulders which the shaman had caused to grind each other. The legend says he was not killed, but was trapped between these two boulders, unable to escape because the talisman's power was as great as his own strength. When Carpio's allies arrived at the cave to rescue him, they were blocked from the cave by a series of cave ins that killed several of them. People soon surmised that whenever an earthquake happens, it is caused by Bernardo Carpio trying to free himself from the mountain.Ang Alamat ni Bernardo Carpio (A Philippine legend) by Katig.Com =Etymology= The same version says that Bernardo Carpio demonstrated unusual strength, even as a child. As a result, the parish priest who baptised him suggested that his parents name him after the Spanish legendary hero Bernardo del Carpio. This became a foreshadowing of the legendary life Carpio himself would lead. As symbolism of freedom from the U.S. and Japan Damiana Eugenio was able to find and document a 1940 compilation of tales detailing the legend of Bernardo Carpio.Eugenio, 2002, pp.3-4 It specifically says that: > \\"Bernardo Carpio is considered the savior of the Filipinos against national > oppression and enslavement\\". According to that particular telling of the tale, when the last link on the chains binding Carpio is broken, \\"the enslavement and oppression of the Filipino race will be replaced with freedom and happiness.\\" While this belief apparently referred to the Spanish Occupation of the Philippines and the later occupation by the Philippines by the U.S. and by Japan in World War II, the legend has continued to be told this way, an apparent reference to freedom from poverty rather than foreign domination. Filipino revolutionary heroes Jose Rizal and Andres Bonifacio are said to have paid homage to the Bernardo Carpio legend - the former by making a pilgrimage to Montalban, and the latter making the caves of Montalban the secret meeting place for the Katipunan movement.Ocampo,2007 As an etiological myth The tale of Bernardo Carpio can be considered an etiological myth which explains the occurrence of earthquakes.Eugenio, 2002 The area which hosts the legend of Bernardo Carpio is also home to the West Valley Fault System (formerly called the Marikina Valley Fault System).The Valley Fault System  In popular literature  * Lav Diaz's 2016 film A Lullaby to the Sorrowful Mystery () prominently features a tikbalang (played as a triune being played by Bernardo Barnardo, Cherie Gil, and Angel Aquino) which is revealed to be the engkanto who made a deal with the Spanish rulers to bind Bernardo Carpio, effectively allowing the Spanish to rule over the leaderless people. Towards the end of the film, however, the Tikbalang reveals that it/they never chained up Bernardo Carpio because he is just a myth, noting that it is foolish to hope for salvation from a figment of the imagination.

The original story was serialized for about a year from 1970 in . It was available online in English through JManga, but is now on Crunchyroll. In 1972, the manga was adapted into a TV tokusatsu series titled by Toei, and broadcast by Yomiuri TV every Sunday 19:30–20:00 from April 2 to November 26. In this TV series, the original story and character designs by Saito were widely changed. During the airing seasons of the tokusatsu series; due to the naming of the villain character , a German child studying in Japan with a similarly sounding surname was bullied by native schoolmates - which was led to be mentioned in the newspaper in 25 August (four months later from the airing of the first episode) and also led the series to be aired further with the notice; \\"The fictional character Doruge has no relation with living people.\\" An anime version was created and broadcast from December 2002 to March 2003 by AT-X. In this version the plot and story were also changed from its original version. Plot One night, a monster comes out from a lake and starts attacking Takeshi Kido and Kentaro Shiratori, childhood friends who were born on the same day. When the monster is about to kill both of them, a being called Kopu calls and tells them that they are the chosen ones to protect the world from the evil creature Doruge. Kopu gives a radar to Kentaro and Takeshi and the ability to transform into the powerful monster Barom-1 by joining their hands. Now both boys must destroy the monsters possessed by Doruge.

Sexual bias  Sexual orientation discrimination is discrimination against a person or group on the basis of their sexual orientation or sexual behavior. Sexual orientation discrimination often comes up in the context of employment actions.Berry, John, \\"Sexual Orientation Discrimination in the Current State of the Law (2017)\\" It usually refers to a predisposition towards heterosexual people, which is biased against lesbian, gay, and bisexual people, among others. It can, however, also be against heterosexual people. A related term is sexual prejudice, a negative attitude toward someone because of their sexual orientation.Matlin, Margaret W., Ph.D., \\"The Psychology of Women\\", (2004) This bias is not the same as homophobia, but rather is the discrimination towards or against certain sexual orientations. The concept of Heterosexism suggests that the basis for this bias is not found in the individual per se but rather has a broader cultural or biological basis that results in attitudes weighted in favour of heterosexuality over other sexual orientations. Heterosexism is one form of structural violence. An earlier definition of this term is: Sexual orientation discrimination is a belief or argument that one sexual orientation or sexual behaviour is inherently superior to some or all others. Usually it comes in the form of heterosexuality being considered the only natural, normal, or moral mode of sexual behavior, and is also used to refer to the effects of that instinct. The word heterosexism has also been proposed to mean essentially the same thing as this form of sexual orientation discrimination.Corsini, Raymond J., The Dictionary of Psychology (2001), This word has been suggested as an alternative to homophobia,Herek, Gregory M., Ph.D., \\"Beyond 'Homophobia': Thinking About Sexual Prejudice and Stigma in the Twenty-First Century.\\" Sexuality Research & Social Policy (April, 2004) in part because it uses a parallel structure to sexism or racism. The intent of the concept of heterosexism is the examination of the cultural bias against non-heterosexuals rather than individual bias, which is the focus of homophobia, as well as the adverse effects of normative heterosexuality on heterosexual identifying people.Jackson, S.

History =Tony and The Telstars= The origins of the group stretch back to early '60s Belfast band Tony & The Telstars,Tony & The Telstars at Irish Showbands.net which featured lead guitarist Rod Demick (born Roderick Demick, 1947, Prestatyn, Flintshire, North Wales), drummer Davy Lutton (born William David Lutton, 1946, Belfast), lead vocalist and guitarist George O'Hara and bassist Chris Stewart (born Eric Christopher Stewart, 1946, Belfast, Co Antrim). During 1965, Demick departed to join local R'n'B group The Wheels and Stewart joined German-based Irish band The Stellas. Their replacements included guitarist David \\"Tiger\\" Taylor, bassist Mike Niblett (from The Stellas) and apprentice auto mechanic Ernie Graham (born Ernest Harold Graham, 14 June 1946, Belfast) on rhythm guitar and backing vocals.Apparent Eire Apparent biography at 'The Famous Kinema Ballroom Dunfermline'Eire Apparent biography at the Irish Rock Discography =The People= In late 1965 Lutton, O'Hara, Niblett and Graham formed pop outfit The People along with former Them keyboard player Eric Wrixon. They contributed two songs to the February 1966 compilation album Ireland's Greatest Sounds: Five Top Groups From Belfast's Maritime Club. In mid-1966 a \\"browned-off\\" Eric Wrixon announced the band were moving to England: \\"We hope it's forever... Nowhere, but nowhere, could be worse than Belfast.\\" At the time they were using a stand-in guitarist in place of O'Hara and hoping to recruit Billy Harrison (ex-Them).The People at Irish Showbands.net Very soon afterwards Wrixon defected to another Belfast group resident on the Blackpool scene, The Wheels. Meanwhile, Mike Niblett and Chris Stewart had each swapped places and returned to their original bands. Guitarist Henry McCullough (formerly of The Sky Rockets Showband and Gene and The Gents) from Portstewart in Northern Ireland teamed up with The People in early 1967 and they quickly developed a strong reputation on the Blackpool and then (briefly) the Dublin music scenes. =Eire Apparent= In 1967 the band moved to London and were signed by ex-Animal Chas Chandler and Mike Jeffery, who changed the band's name to 'Eire Apparent' – Jeffery wanted to exploit the Irish dimension and his wife came up with the new name. Eire Apparent were briefly signed to Track Records, who also handled Chandler and Jeffery's protégé Jimi Hendrix, and recorded one single, \\"Follow Me\\" / \\"Here I Go Again,\\" released in January 1968, before they left Track. Despite only having released the one single, Chandler and Jeffery sent them on tour to North America with headliners The Animals during February and March 1968. Things went well until, in Vancouver, Canada in mid February, McCullough was busted for possession of marijuana and sent back to Ireland, so guitarist Mick Cox (born Michael Charles Cox, 1943, Gillingham, Kent, died August 2008; formerly of The Alleykatz and The End) flew out to take his place in the band.Eric Burdon and The Animals, by Ross Hannan and Corry Arnold By May McCullough had joined Sweeney's Men in Ireland.Green Beat: The Forgotten Era Of Irish Rock, by Daragh O'Halloran (Brehon Press 2006) The new line-up continued to tour North America with the Jimi Hendrix Experience and Soft Machine, and held recording sessions in New York's Record Plant studio with Hendrix in May (probably taping their next single \\"Let Me Stay\\" / \\"Yes I Need Someone\\").Electric Ladyland Sessions at the Forum Jimi Hendrix The album Sunrise was mostly cut in late October 1968 in Los Angeles, with Jimi Hendrix producing. Hendrix also played on a number of tracks (including \\"Yes I Need Someone\\" and \\"The Clown\\"), whilst Noel Redding, Mitch Mitchell and Robert Wyatt are also credited (Redding and Wyatt singing on \\"1026\\" and/or \\"The Clown\\"). The album was released on Buddah Records in the US and the UK in May 1969. Cox was replaced by guitarist David \\"Tiger\\" Taylor in November 1968, shortly after the album was recorded. Taylor had already been a member of The People during 1965, and he co-wrote their \\"Rock 'N' Roll Band\\" single recorded in London in January 1969, again featuring Jimi Hendrix. This line up of Taylor, Graham, Stewart and Lutton then toured Europe with Hendrix and in April 1969 recorded the band's only Peel Session. Guitarist Peter Tolson, who later joined the Pretty Things, is also cited as having replaced Taylor on this session.The Forgotten Beebs Guitarist Steve Jolly formerly of Sam Apple Pie later joined the band. In May 1969, Beat Instrumental reported that they were recording tracks for a second Eire Apparent album (reportedly produced by Soft Machine drummer Robert Wyatt) but it never saw the light of day. In May 1970, hardly noticed by the public, the band broke up. Subsequent careers *Ernie Graham recorded one solo album in 1971, was briefly a member of Help Yourself in 1972 and then co-founded pub rock combo Clancy.

This episode is also known as \\"Automation\\". This episode was made by LWT for ITV. Written by The Goodies, with songs and music by Bill Oddie. Plot Tim and Graeme are studying a readout of their end of year profits and expenses, and deduce that they must fire Bill in order to keep the business running at a profit. Graeme suggests that they introduce automation now that Bill is gone, while Bill announces that he's going to picket. Unfortunately, the lettering on his picket sign, which reads \\"Support your striking mate!\\" starts to run after it starts raining, leading the sign to now read \\"up yours mate!\\", which causes Bill to get knocked out by an offended passerby. Back at the Goodies office, Bill is packing up his things, while Tim nervously paces around the living room. Bill says it must be because of the guilt they are feeling for firing him, but Tim explains that they are expecting a little visitor and will soon be hearing the patter of tiny feet. Suddenly, they hear the sound of a baby crying and Graeme bursts in and announces that they are now the proud parents of a baby robot. Bill is aghast at being replaced with such a thing, but Graeme explains that when it grows up it will be able to do everything that he does. Convinced that Graeme has lost his mind, Bill exits. Later that night, Tim and Graeme are woken up by the wailing of the robot. They get into an argument over who should get up to look after him and decide that they need an Au pair to look after the robot. The next morning, a group of attractive would-be Au pairs arrive at the house, and a randy Tim is suddenly excited about the prospect of getting some hired help. However, one final applicant arrives - a still bearded Bill, in a pink sweater, mini-skirt, blonde wig and with an outrageously large bust, wanders in and introduces himself as Helga from Sweden. Tim is disgusted by \\"Helga\\", but Graeme insists they hire her, citing a well-known rule of life about never to hire a pretty Au pair as it always causes trouble. Tim and Graeme explain to \\"Helga\\" what is expected of \\"her\\" and suggest \\"she\\" take the robot out for a walk. \\"Helga\\" immediately tries to do away with the defenceless robot while out on their walk - using a variety of methods to dispose of him. None of these work and the robot turns the tables on his carer and eventually gets \\"Helga\\" encased in a concrete block. Fed up, \\"Helga\\" dumps the robot at the steps of a homeless shelter and runs away. Later, Tim spanks \\"Helga\\" as punishment for losing the robot when they go on walks. Graeme enters and tells off \\"Helga\\". Tim and Graeme demand an explanation from \\"Helga\\" as to why the robot keeps going missing. Bill, who's now dropped the accent and speaks in his normal voice, comments that the robot is growing up and they can't rule his life. A nostalgic Graeme goes to his computer to play their home movies featuring his robot son. These movies include such moments of Graeme shoving dozens of ice creams into the mouth of the robot and \\"Helga\\" subsequently being vomited on by the robot. The film ends with secret video that Graeme recorded of \\"Helga\\" dumping the robot at the shelter. Graeme then proudly announces that \\"Helga's\\" efforts to get rid of the robot were useless, as it is always programmed to come home. Bill inquires where the robot is now, and Graeme admits that he has no idea. Tim and Graeme then get into a debate over the gender of their cybernetic offspring when their \\"son\\" rather a daughter bursts in (now much larger than the last time he appeared) accompanied by a pink female robot (which Graeme refers to as a \\"tin trollop). Tim demands that the robot get up to his room immediately, to which the robot replies \\"You said it, baldy\\". The sounds of them engaging in hanky panky are heard as Graeme and Tim lament over where they went wrong as parents. The robot comes back down and Tim decides he needs to lay down the law. The robot treats Tim's dressing down with contempt, his interest only raising when Graeme walks in dressed up in kitchen utensils and cooking pans pretending to be a robot, in order to set a good example for his son. But this backfires when the robot becomes amorous with Graeme and advances on him. Tim admits that their son is beyond saving, saying he's only interested in sex and playing loud music. Tim then makes an offhand comment about how \\"next thing you know, he'll probably grow long hair and a beard\\", and almost instantly, a beard and Oddie-esque long hair appears on the robot. Graeme is aghast, declaring that they've turned the robot into Bill and talk about how much they loathed him. \\"Helga\\" wanders in and jumps to Bill's defence - saying he thought Bill was a fine human being. \\"Obviously you didn't know him\\" Graeme responds. Bill replies \\"Know him ... I am him!\\", taking off his Helga wig. Tim and Graeme then realise they want him back, saying they don't need a robot. The robot then warns them to be careful, to which Bill launches into an agitated rant about how robots are taking over. He mentions C-3PO, K-9, R2-D2, Twiki and Metal Mickey as he launches into an impassioned speech about the greatness of the human race. Graeme is worried about agitating the robot, and sure enough, he responds by storming out of the Goodies' apartment, leading his \\"comrades\\" - i.e. the kitchen appliances (oven, fridge) out of the home in protest. Tim vainly asks them to \\"Come back\\", but they leave. To the strains of Bill's song \\"Come Back\\", the Goodies set off in pursuit of their whitegoods and the robot, with the help of a giant magnet. Eventually, it's left to Tim to defeat the angry appliances, and after being cornered and advanced upon by the robot and his allies, he uses the giant magnet to lift himself up to a lightpost, thereby causing the robot and the appliances to crash into each other and explode. Tim then returns to the Goodies' home saying that the robot has learnt his lesson, to which a barely recognisable, severely damaged robot appears and says \\"Sorry, mummy\\". Graeme says that he doesn't need the robot anymore, as Bill is doing all of the housework now. Tim follows Graeme into the kitchen, where he sees Bill sitting at the table. With robotic movements, Bill puts his hand into a bowl of mixture and mixes it at high speed. Tim says that there is only one of him - to which Graeme responds that he's mass-produced Bill. He then leads Tim into the living room, where a room full of \\"Bill clones\\" are performing a variety of household chores (e.g. one acts as a TV set, another acts as an oven, another is doing the washing). Notes Bill Oddie refers to Metal Mickey, a robot which originally appeared on the children's television show Saturday Banana hosted by Oddie.

The commune gets its name from the fact that it is situated between the two main tributaries of the Saint-Étienne River: the Bras de Cilaos to the west and the Bras de la Plaine to the east. Its location also explains the commune's motto: Deux bras, un cœur (Two arms, one heart). L'Entre-Deux is bordered by the communes of Cilaos, Saint-Benoît, Saint-Louis, Saint-Pierre and Le Tampon. History L'Entre-Deux became the 5th section of the commune of Saint-Pierre in 1839, and became a commune in its own right in 1882. Economy The village of l’Entre-Deux flourished thanks to the coffee trade introduced to the island in 1715, but the sugar cane has also had a significant success in the town. After the 1950s, l’Entre-Deux underwent a series of changes to stop the economy from stagnating, with roads, buildings, reservoirs and electronic networks being set up in the town, as with much of the island, thanks in part to the French state. By the 1980s however, this effort was complete. The village got a cosmetic overhaul, while such industries as tobacco and Pelargonium geranium farming ceased to be. Other trades, such as chicken farming, started up with moderate success, and now L'Entre-Deux is, along with Salazie, one of the main poultry centres of the island. This dynamism since the 80s is shown by the population increase: From 3624 residents in 1961, to 4259 in 1990 and 5585 in 2004. These days, there only about 60% of the population is actively working, which is put down to the fact that businesses are reducing in number, seeing a recent rise in self- employment. There has also been a steady rise in tourism to the village.

Davenport was fourth son of George Davenport, a wealthy English banker, and his wife Jane Devereux, née Davies, and was educated at Mill Hill School in North London. His father, had become an agent of the South Australia Company in England and together with partners Frederick Luck (quarter share) and Roger Cunliffe (one-eighth share) paid £4416 for a special survey of in South Australia, and sent his eldest son (George) Francis Davenport to select the land. Francis and his second wife Sarah Davenport (née Fincher) arrived in Adelaide in February 1840 aboard Rajasthan. After initially considering land near Port Lincoln, he selected land on the upper reaches of the River Angas, including what is now the town of Macclesfield. Francis returned to England in 1841, leaving Henry Giles to manage his affairs. Davenport married Margaret Fraser Cleland (1821 – 6 February 1902) on 1 June 1842. She would become known for her charitable work, closely associated with Emily Clark, Lady Colton and Catherine Helen Spence. Samuel, his wife and brother Robert (1816–1896) arrived in Adelaide from Hobart aboard Adelaide in February 1843. Francis and Sarah returned to Adelaide aboard Rajusthan in February 1843. He died at the Rundle Street home of William Giles on 8 April 1843. The remaining brothers lived at Macclesfield and managed the survey. Samuel continued to receive an annual allowance from his father. Davenport's first ventures in Australia were in mixed farming, almonds and vines, which had sparked his interest when he was in the south of France as a youth. He then tried sheep-farming with approximately 6000 sheep, but disease killed half of them. In 1860 he bought land near Port Augusta, and turned to ranching horses and cattle. He realised from his success that large-stock holdings made healthy profits in South Australia. Davenport at Beaumont House during 1880. From 1849 he lived mostly at his home in Beaumont, in his residence of Beaumont House, which he owned from 1851 onwards. He continued to care for the welfare of tenants at Macclesfield, providing attractive rental terms. Between 5 May 1846 and 1 July 1848, Davenport was a non-official nominated member of the South Australian Legislative Council. Between 1849 and 1852 he served as a city commissioner. He contested the Legislative Council seat of Hindmarsh without success in a by-election during 1854, but on 25 October 1855 was nominated to the part- elective Legislative Council. He was eventually elected to the first Legislative Council under responsible government in 1857 and administered the oath of allegiance to the councillors on 22 April 1857. He served a number of ministries; however he resigned from the council on 25 September 1866. Davenport strongly promoted agriculture and other new industries in South Australia. Between 1864 and 1872 he published a number of pamphlets, three of them dealing with the cultivation of olives and manufacture of olive oil, silk and tobacco. Davenport grew both olives and silk on his Beaumont House estate. He was a member of the Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society and its president from 1873 to 1879 and 1890 to 1891. He was a member of the South Australian Institute's Board of Governors. He was elected to a number of positions in the agricultural, horticultural and geographical societies. He was also a successful banker like his English father. Davenport was knighted during 1884 and in 1886 appointed KCMG and given an honorary doctorate by the University of Cambridge. After his death in 1906, obituarists praised his 'honourable record both in public and private life' and both Houses of Parliament were adjourned for his funeral. The South Australian Assembly seat of Davenport was later named after him. - References    Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Knights Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George Category:Settlers of South Australia Category:1818 births Category:1906 deaths Category:People educated at Mill Hill School Category:Members of the South Australian Legislative Council Category:19th- century Australian politicians ","title":"Samuel Davenport"},{"id":"8868979","text":"The Siege of Dubrovnik (, Опсада Дубровника) was a military engagement fought between the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) and Croatian forces defending the city of Dubrovnik and its surroundings during the Croatian War of Independence. The JNA started its advance on 1 October 1991, and by late October, it had captured virtually all the land between the Pelješac and Prevlaka peninsulas on the coast of the Adriatic Sea, with the exception of Dubrovnik itself. The siege was accompanied by a Yugoslav Navy blockade. The JNA's bombardment of Dubrovnik, including that of the Old Town—a UNESCO World Heritage Site—culminated on 6 December 1991. The bombardment provoked international condemnation, and became a public relations disaster for Serbia and Montenegro, contributing to their diplomatic and economic isolation, as well as the international recognition of Croatia's independence. In May 1992, the JNA retreated to Bosnia and Herzegovina, less than from the coast in some places, and handed over its equipment to the newly formed Army of Republika Srpska (VRS). During this time, the Croatian Army (HV) attacked from the west and pushed back the JNA/VRS from the areas east of Dubrovnik, both in Croatia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and by the end of May linked up with the HV unit defending the city. Fighting between the HV and Yugoslav troops east of Dubrovnik gradually died down. The siege resulted in the deaths of 194 Croatian military personnel, as well as 82–88 Croatian civilians. The JNA suffered 165 fatalities. The entire region was recaptured by the HV in Operation Tiger and the Battle of Konavle by the end of 1992. The offensive resulted in the displacement of 15,000 people, mainly from Konavle, who fled to Dubrovnik. Approximately 16,000 refugees were evacuated from Dubrovnik by sea, and the city was resupplied by blockade-evading runabouts and a convoy of civilian vessels. More than 11,000 buildings were damaged and numerous homes, businesses, and public buildings were looted or torched. The operation was part of a plan drawn up by the JNA aimed at securing the Dubrovnik area and then proceeding north-west to link up with the JNA troops in northern Dalmatia via western Herzegovina. The offensive was accompanied by a significant amount of war propaganda. In 2000, Montenegrin president Milo Đukanović apologized for the siege, eliciting an angry response from his political opponents and from Serbia. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) convicted two Yugoslav officers for their involvement in the siege and handed a third over to Serbia for prosecution. The ICTY indictment stated that the offensive was designed to detach the Dubrovnik region from Croatia and integrate it into a Serb-dominated state through an unsuccessful proclamation of the Dubrovnik Republic on 24 November 1991. In addition, Montenegro convicted four former JNA soldiers of prisoner abuse at the Morinj camp. Croatia also charged several former JNA or Yugoslav Navy officers and a former Bosnian Serb leader with war crimes, but no trials have yet resulted from these indictments. Background In August 1990, an insurrection took place in Croatia, centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around the city of Knin, parts of the Lika, Kordun, and Banovina regions, and settlements in eastern Croatia with significant Serb populations. These areas were subsequently named the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) and after declaring its intention to integrate with Serbia, the Government of Croatia declared the RSK a rebellion. By March 1991, the conflict had escalated and the Croatian War of Independence erupted. In June 1991, Croatia declared its independence as Yugoslavia disintegrated. A three-month moratorium followed, after which the decision came into effect on 8 October. The RSK then initiated a campaign of ethnic cleansing against Croat civilians, expelling most non-Serbs by early 1993. By November 1993, fewer than 400 ethnic Croats remained in the United Nations (UN) protected area known as Sector South, and a further 1,500 - 2,000 remained in Sector North. As the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) increasingly supported the RSK, and the Croatian Police were unable to cope with the situation, the Croatian National Guard (ZNG) was formed in May 1991. In November, the ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army (HV). The development of the military of Croatia was hampered by a UN arms embargo introduced in September, while the military conflict in Croatia continued to escalate with the Battle of Vukovar, which started on 26 August. Dubrovnik is the southernmost major Croatian city. It is located on the Adriatic Sea coast. The walled city centre, known as the Old Town, is a site of historical monuments and heritage buildings largely dating to the Republic of Ragusa; the city has been placed on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. In 1991, the city had a population of approximately 50,000, of whom 82.4% were Croats and 6.8% were Serbs. Croatian territory surrounding the city stretches from the Pelješac peninsula to the west and the Prevlaka peninsula in the east at the entrance to the Bay of Kotor on the border with Montenegro. This territory is very narrow, especially near Dubrovnik itself, and consists of a wide coastal strip of land. Prelude Panoramic view of Dubrovnik In mid-1991, top JNA commandersincluding Yugoslav Federal Defence Minister General Veljko Kadijević, JNA Chief of the General Staff General Blagoje Adžić and deputy defence minister Vice Admiral Stane Brovetplanned a military offensive entailing an attack on the Dubrovnik area followed by a westward JNA advance towards western Herzegovina to link up with the JNA 9th Knin Corps in northern Dalmatia once the area was secured. General Jevrem Cokić submitted the plan of the Dubrovnik offensive to Adžić for his approval. In September 1991, the JNA and the leaders of Montenegro said that Dubrovnik should be attacked and neutralized to ensure Montenegro's territorial integrity, to prevent ethnic clashes and to preserve the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Đukanović stated that Croatian borders needed be revised, attributing the existing border line to \\"poorly educated Bolshevik cartographers\\". The propaganda, compounded by JNA Colonel General Pavle Strugar's allegations that 30,000 Croatian troops and 7,000 terrorists and Kurdish mercenaries were about to attack Montenegro and seize the Bay of Kotor led many in Montenegro to believe that Croatia had actually started an invasion. The newspaper Pobjeda was the most significant media source that contributed to the spread of the propaganda. In July 1991, high- ranking Serbian official Mihalj Kertes said at a political rally in Nikšić that a Serbian state was to be established west of Montenegro extending to the Neretva River with Dubrovnikrenamed Nikšić-at-Seaas its capital. On 16 September 1991, the JNA mobilized in Montenegro citing the deteriorating situation in Croatia. Despite a radio broadcast appeal by the JNA 2nd Titograd Corps on 17 September, considerable numbers of reservists refused to respond to the call-up. On 18 September, Đukanović threatened harsh punishment of deserters and those refusing to respond to the mobilization. The mobilization and the propaganda were in contrast with assurances from Yugoslav federal authorities in Belgrade that there would be no attack against Dubrovnik. The JNA's strategic plan to defeat Croatia included an offensive to cut off the southernmost parts of Croatia, including Dubrovnik, from the rest of the country. On 23 September, JNA artillery attacked the village of Vitaljina in the eastern part of Konavle and Brgat to the east of Dubrovnik. Two days later, the Yugoslav Navy blockaded maritime routes to the city. On 26 September, the JNA renamed its Eastern Herzegovina Operational Group the 2nd Operational Group and subordinated it directly to the Federal Ministry of Defence and the JNA General Staff. Cokić was appointed the first commanding officer of the 2nd Operational Group but was replaced by General Mile Ružinovski on 5 October following the shooting down of Cokić's helicopter. Strugar replaced Ružinovski on 12 October. Order of battle JNA positions overlooking Dubrovnik, 9 December 1991. Three 9K11 Malyutka anti-tank guided missiles in a firing position are visible. The JNA tasked the 2nd Titograd Corps and the 9th Boka Kotorska Military-Maritime Sector (VPS)both of which were elements of the 2nd Operational Groupwith cutting off and capturing the Dubrovnik area. The 2nd Titograd Corps deployed the 1st Nikšić Brigade while the 9th Boka Kotorska VPS employed the 5th and the 472nd Motorized Brigades. The Corps boundary running north-to-south near Dubrovnik was set. The 2nd Operational Group also commanded the 16th Border Patrol Detachment and 107th Coastal Artillery Group, and mobilised Territorial Defence units from Herceg- Novi, Kotor, Tivat, Budva, Bar, Mojkovac, Bijelo Polje and Trebinje. Strugar was in overall command of the 2nd Operative Group while the 9th Boka Kotorska VPS was commanded by Vice Admiral Miodrag Jokić. Jokić replaced Admiral Krsto Đurović, who had died in uncertain circumstances hours before the offensive began. Major General Nojko Marinović, once commanding the 472nd Motorized Brigade and subordinate of Đurović, said that the JNA had killed the admiral because he opposed the offensive. Marinović resigned his post on 17 September and joined the Croatian ZNG. The JNA 2nd Operational Group initially deployed 7,000 troops and maintained similar troop levels throughout the offensive. The defences of Dubrovnik were almost non-existentat the outset of hostilities there were 480 troops in the city area, out of which only 50 had some training. The only regular military unit was a platoon armed with light infantry weapons that was stationed in the Napoleonic era Fort Imperial atop the Srđ Hill overlooking Dubrovnik. The rest of the troops in the area were poorly armed because the Croatian Territorial Defence had been disarmed by the JNA in 1989. Unlike elsewhere in Croatia, there had been no JNA garrisons or storage depots in Dubrovnik since 1972 and thus very few arms and munitions captured during the September Battle of the Barracks were available to defend Dubrovnik. On 26 September 200 rifles and four artillery pieces captured from the JNA on the island of Korčula were sent to reinforce the city. The guns were a mix of 76 mm and 85 mm Soviet World War II-era divisional guns. In addition, an improvised armoured vehicle was supplied to the city. Dubrovnik also received additional HV, Croatian Police and Croatian Defence Forces troops from other parts of Croatia. This brought the number of Croatian troops in Dubrovnik to 600. By November, about 1,000 Croatian troops were defending the city. On 19 September, Marinović was appointed commanding officer of the defences in Dubrovnik, at which time he assessed them as inadequate. The troops, initially organized as the Territorial Defence of Dubrovnik, were reorganized into the HV 75th Independent Battalion on 28 December 1991 and were later reinforced with elements of the 116th Infantry Brigade to form the 163rd Infantry Brigade on 13 February 1992. The Armed Boats Squadron Dubrovnik, a volunteer military unit of the Croatian Navy consisting of 23 vessels of various sizes and 117 volunteers, was established on 23 September to counter the Yugoslav Navy blockade. Timeline =JNA advance= Map of the JNA advance to Dubrovnik in 1991 On 1 October, the JNA started its offensive towards Dubrovnik, moving the 2nd Titograd Corps west through the Popovo field north of the city. The JNA 2nd Corps destroyed the village of Ravno before turning south towards Dubrovačko Primorje area, aiming to envelop Dubrovnik from the west. The second axis of the JNA advance was assigned to the 9th Boka Kotorska VPS. It originated in the Bay of Kotor about south-east of Dubrovnik and was directed through Konavle. The advance started at 5 am after preparatory artillery fire against Vitaljina and other targets in Konavle. The advance, using several roads in the region, was supported by the Yugoslav Navy and the Air Force. Croatian defences were nonexistent in Konavle and light in Dubrovačko Primorje—the only JNA casualties of the day occurred during a successful ZNG ambush in Čepikuće village. On the first day of the offensive, JNA artillery attacked Srđ Hill and the Žarkovica promontory just to the north and east of Dubrovnik, while Yugoslav Air Force MiG-21s raided Komolac in Rijeka Dubrovačka to the west, destroying supplies of electricity and water to Dubrovnik. Until the end of December, Dubrovnik relied on fresh water supplied by boats and electricity from a few electric generators. Over the next three days, the JNA made slow progress. Its artillery attacked Srđ Hill, the Fort Imperial and Žarkovica on 2 October. The next day, the JNA shelled Dubrovnik's Belvedere Hotel, where a ZNG defence post was located, and the Yugoslav Air Force bombarded the city's Argentina Hotel. On 4 October, the JNA 2nd Corps captured Slano in Dubrovačko Primorje, interdicting the Adriatic Highway there and isolating Dubrovnik from the rest of Croatia. On 5 October, the Ploče district of Dubrovnik was shelled, followed by a Yugoslav Air Force strike on the Fort Imperial the next day. On 15 October, Croatia offered peace talks to Montenegro, but the President of Serbia Slobodan Milošević dismissed the offer. The offer was made to the Montenegrin officials because the offensive was first officially endorsed by the Montenegrin government on 1 October. Three days later, Serbia publicly distanced itself from the move, blaming Croatia for provoking the JNA. On the seventh day of the offensive, the Montenegrin parliament blamed the JNA for the attack. On 16 Octobera day after Milošević declined the Croatian offerthe JNA 9th Boka Kotorska VPS force captured Cavtat. The capture of Cavtat was supported by an amphibious landing operation approximately east of Dubrovnik and an airstrike on Ploče district of Dubrovnik on 18 October. The following day, a ceasefire was agreed but it was violated as soon as it came into effect. On 20 October, the Yugoslav Air Force attacked Dubrovnik and on 22 October, the Yugoslav Navy bombarded hotels housing refugees in the Lapad area of the city. On 23 October, the JNA started a sustained artillery bombardment of Dubrovnik, including the Old Town within the city walls, drawing a protest from the United States Department of State the next day. The JNA 9th VPS captured Župa Dubrovačka and Brgat on 24 October, while the Yugoslav Navy bombarded Lokrum Island. The next day, the JNA issued an ultimatum to the city, demanding its surrender and the removal of elected officials from Dubrovnik. On 26 October, the JNA captured the Žarkovica promontory south-east from the city centre, and took most of the high ground overlooking Dubrovnik by 27 October. The JNA 2nd Corps south- western drive towards Dubrovnik was slower. It destroyed a large portion of the Trsteno Arboretum. The JNA advance displaced about 15,000 refugees from the areas it captured. About 7,000 people were evacuated from Dubrovnik by sea in October; the rest took refuge in hotels and elsewhere in the city. =Defence of Dubrovnik= Stradun Street during the siege The JNA continued its artillery strikes against Dubrovnik on 30 October and the bombardment continued until 4 November, targeting the western areas of DubrovnikGruž and Lapad—as well as the Babin Kuk and Argentina hotels, which were housing refugees. On 3-4 November, JNA troops attacked the Old Town and the Argentina Hotel using small arms and sniper fire from positions held by the 3rd Battalion of the JNA 472th Motorized Brigade, which occupied the positions closest to the city centre. The next day, Fort Imperial was bombarded once again. On 7 November, the JNA issued a new ultimatum demanding the surrender of Dubrovnik by noon. The demand was rejected and Jokić announced that the JNA would only spare the Old Town from destruction. The same day, fighting resumed near Slano. JNA artillery and the Yugoslav Navy resumed the bombardment of Dubrovnik between 9 and 12 November, targeting the Old Town, Gruž, Lapad and Ploče, as well as the Belvedere, Excelsior, Babin Kuk, Tirena, Imperial and Argentina hotels. Wire-guided missiles were used to attack boats in the Old Town harbour, while some larger ships at the port of Gružincluding the ferryboat Adriatic and the American-owned sailing ship Pelagic, were set ablaze and destroyed by gunfire. Fort Imperial was attacked by the JNA on 9, 10 and 13 November. These attacks were followed by a lull which lasted until the end of November when the European Union Monitoring Mission (ECMM) mediated in negotiations between the JNA and Croatian authorities in Dubrovnik. The ECMM was withdrawn in mid-November after its personnel were attacked by the JNA, and the mediation was taken over by French State Secretary for Humanitarian Affairs Bernard Kouchner and UNICEF Mission Chief Stephan Di Mistura. The negotiations produced ceasefire agreements on 19 November and 5 December, but neither yielded any specific results on the ground. Instead, the JNA 2nd Corps units located in Dubrovačko Primorje, north-west of Dubrovnik, closed in on the city, reaching the farthest point of their advance on 24 November, as the city defences were pushed back to Sustjepan-Srđ-Belvedere Hotel line. That day, the JNA tried to establish the Dubrovnik Republic in the area it occupied, but the attempt ultimately failed. People queue at a water pipe during the siege In November, Dubrovnik began receiving the largest deliveries of humanitarian aid since the beginning of the siege. The first successful attempt to sustain the city was the Libertas convoy—a fleet of civilian vessels, the largest being Jadrolinija's Slavija—which arrived in Dubrovnik on 31 October. The convoy sailed from Rijeka and made several port calls, growing to 29 vessels as it approached Dubrovnik. The convoywhich also carried the ECMM observers, at least 1,000 protesters, the President of the Presidency of Yugoslavia Stjepan Mesić and the former Prime Minister of Croatia Franjo Gregurićwas initially stopped by the Yugoslav frigate JRM Split between the islands of Brač and Šolta, and the next day by Yugoslav patrol boats off Korčula before the Armed Boats Squadron linked up with the fleet and escorted it to the Port of Dubrovnik in Gruž. On its return, the 700-capacity Slavija evacuated 2,000 refugees from Dubrovnik, although she had to sail to the Bay of Kotor first for inspection by the Yugoslav Navy. The Hotel Grand in Kupari was destroyed during the siege On 2-3 December, the JNA resumed infantry weapons fire against the Old Town, followed by mortar fire against Fort Imperial on 4 December. The heaviest bombardment of the Old Town started at 5:48 am on 6 December. The Old Town was struck by 48 missiles, 232 and 364 mortar shells, as well as 22 wire-guided missiles. Two impact craters indicated the use of heavier weapons. The bombardment was concentrated on Stradun—the central promenade of the Old Town—and areas north-east of Stradun, while other parts of the Old Town sustained relatively few impacts. The attack subsided at 11:30 am. It killed 13 civiliansthe heaviest loss of civilian life during the siege. The Dubrovnik Inter-University Centre library containing 20,000 volumes was also destroyed in the attack and the Libertas Hotel was bombarded by JNA artillery aiming to kill firefighters putting out fires caused by an attack earlier that day. The 6 December attack of the Old Town was met with strong protests from the international media, UNESCO Director- General Federico Mayor Zaragoza, Special Envoy of the Secretary-General of the United Nations Cyrus Vance and the ECMM on the day of the bombardment. Later that day, the JNA issued a statement of regret and promised an inquiry. On 7 December, representatives of the JNA visited the Old Town to inspect the damage but no further actions were noted. All of the Croatian defences were away from the Old Town, except for Fort Imperial about to the north. The fortress was attacked at 5:50 amminutes after the bombardment of the Old Town began. The attack was executed by the 3rd Battalion of the JNA 472nd Motorized Brigade, advancing simultaneously from two directions. The primary attack consisted of a company-sized force, and the secondary of a platoon of infantrymenboth supported by T-55 tanks and artillery. By 8 am, the infantry reached Fort Imperial, forcing the defending force to retreat into the fortification and request help. Marinović ordered HV artillery to fire directly onto the fortress and dispatched a special police unit to reinforce the Fort Imperial garrison. By 2 pm, the JNA called off the attack. That day, Sveti Vlaho—the first vessel commissioned by the Armed Boats Squadron Dubrovnik and named after the patron saint of the city Saint Blaise—was sunk by a wire-guided missile. =Croatian counterattack= Map of the HV advance to Dubrovnik in May 1992 and the subsequent Operation Jackal On 7 December 1991, another ceasefire was agreed and the JNA force besieging Dubrovnik became largely inactive. In January 1992, the Sarajevo Agreement was signed by representatives of Croatia, the JNA and the UN, and fighting was paused. The United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was deployed to Croatia to supervise and maintain the agreement. Serbia continued to support the RSK. The conflict largely passed onto entrenched positions and the JNA soon retreated from Croatia into Bosnia and Herzegovina, where a new conflict was anticipated. The only exception was the Dubrovnik area, where the JNA attacked westward from Dubrovačko Primorje, pushing back elements of the HV's 114th and 116th Infantry Brigades and reaching the outskirts of Ston by the beginning of 1992. The capabilities of the HV increased dramatically in the first few months of 1992 because it acquired large stockpiles of JNA's weapons in the Battle of the Barracks. After the JNA disengaged in Croatia, its personnel prepared to set up a new Bosnian Serb army, later renamed the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS). The move followed the Bosnian Serb declaration of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992, ahead of the 29 February-1 March 1992 referendum on Bosnia and Herzegovina's independence. The referendum would later be cited as a pretext for the Bosnian War, which commenced in early April 1992, when the VRS's artillery began shelling Sarajevo. The JNA and the VRS in Bosnia and Herzegovina were confronted by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), reporting to the Bosniak-dominated central government and the Bosnian Croat leadership respectively. The HV sometimes deployed to Bosnia and Herzegovina to support the HVO. In April 1992, the JNA began offensive operations against the HV and the HVO in areas of western and southern Herzegovina near Kupres and Stolac. The 4th Military District of the JNA, commanded by Strugar, aimed to capture Stolac and most of the eastern bank of the Neretva River south of Mostar. The fighting around Mostar and JNA artillery attacks on the city started on 6 April. The JNA pushed the HV/HVO force from Stolac on 11 April and Čapljina came under JNA fire. A ceasefire was arranged on 7 May but the JNA and the Bosnian Serb forces resumed the attack the next day. The attack succeeded in capturing a large part of Mostar and some territory on the western bank of the Neretva River. On 12 May, the JNA forces based in Bosnia and Herzegovina became part of the VRS, and the JNA 2nd Operational Group was renamed as the 4th VRS Herzegovina Corps. Croatia saw the JNA moves as a prelude to attacks on southern Croatia specifically aimed at the Port of Ploče and possibly Split. To counter the threat, the HV appointed General Janko Bobetko to command the Southern Front, encompassing the Herzegovina and Dubrovnik areas. Bobetko reorganized the HVO command structure and assumed command of the HVO in the region and newly deployed HV units, the 1st Guards and the 4th Guards Brigades. alt=A child wearing winter clothes and holding a large teddy bear looks at the camera, with other similarly dressed adults busy in the background The VRS and JNA attacked north of Ston on 11 April, pushing back elements of the HV 115th Infantry Brigade and elements of the arriving HV Guards Brigades for only modest territorial gain. The frontline stabilized by 23 April and the HV counterattacked and reclaimed some ground after 27 April. On 17 May, Bobetko ordered a major attack of the two full guards brigades. The 1st Guards Brigade was tasked with advancing to link up with the Ston Company guarding access to the Pelješac Peninsula and advance to Slano. The 4th Guards Brigade was ordered to secure the hinterland of the Dubrovačko Primorje by advancing along the rim of the Popovo field. At the same time, the JNA was pressured by the international community to pull back east of Dubrovnik to Konavle. The 1st Guards Brigade, supported by elements of the 115th Infantry Brigade, captured Čepikuće on 21 May and Slano on 22-23 May. The Armed Boats Squadron Dubrovnik landed troops in Slano the previous night, but they were repulsed by the JNA. On the night of 23-24 May, the JNA attacked Sustjepan and the northern outskirts of Dubrovnik. On 26 May, the JNA started to pull out of Mokošica and Žarkovica. The 163rd Infantry Brigade advanced from Dubrovnik; its 1st Battalion took positions in Brgat and Župa Dubrovačka, and the 2nd Battalion deployed to Osojnik. On 29 May, the 4th Guards Brigade recaptured Ravno. On 31 May, the 2nd Battalion of the 163rd Brigade pushed the JNA to the Golubov Kamen massif overlooking the Adriatic Highway section tracing around the Rijeka Dubrovačka embayment, but failed to capture the massif. The brigade was relieved by the 145th Infantry Brigade on 15 June. Dubrovnik was targeted by the JNA artillery continuously until 16 June, and then intermittently until 30 June. On 7 June, the 1st Guards and the 4th Guards Brigades ceased their advance in Dubrovačko Primorje in the vicinity of Orahov Do, a village to the north of Slano. Aftermath Damage after the shelling of a Dubrovnik building Regardless of its military outcome, the Siege of Dubrovnik is primarily remembered for the large-scale looting by JNA troops and the artillery bombardment of Dubrovnik, especially its Old Town. The reaction of the international media and media coverage of the siege reinforced an opinion, already taking shape since the fall of Vukovar, that the conduct of the JNA and the Serbs was barbaric and intent on dominating Croatia, regardless of the destruction of priceless cultural heritage that occurred in the process. Serbian authorities thought the international community had no moral grounds to judge because they did not interfere when hundreds of thousands of Serbs were killed in Croatian concentration camps during World War II. Besides the protests made by Mayor Zaragoza, Vance and the ECMM, 104 Nobel Prize laureates published a full-page advertisement in The New York Times on 14 January 1992 at the incentive of Linus Pauling, urging governments throughout the world to stop the unrestrained destruction by the JNA. During the siege, UNESCO placed Dubrovnik on its list of World Heritage in Danger. Because the siege shaped international opinion of the Croatian War of Independence, it became a major contributor to a shift in the international diplomatic and economic isolation of Serbia and rump Yugoslavia, which came to be viewed as an aggressor-state in the West. On 17 December 1991, the European Economic Community agreed to recognize the independence of Croatia on 15 January 1992. Between October and December 1991, the JNA captured approximately of territory around Dubrovnikall of which the HV recaptured in its May 1992 counterattack as the JNA pulled back east of Dubrovnik, and in subsequent HV offensivesOperation Tiger and the Battle of Konavle between July and October 1992. Between 82 and 88 Croatian civilians were killed in the siege, as were 194 Croatian military personnel. Ninety-four Croatian soldiers were killed between October and December 1991. A total of 417 were killed in all military operations around Dubrovnik by the end of October 1992. The JNA suffered 165 fatalities. Approximately 15,000 refugees from Konavle and other areas around Dubrovnik fled to the city, and about 16,000 refugees were evacuated by sea from Dubrovnik to other parts of Croatia. The JNA set up two prisoner-of-war camps to detain those it had captured, one at Bileća and the other at Morinj. During and after the offensive, 432 people, mainly civilians from Konavle, were imprisoned—292 in Morinj and 140 in Bileća—and subjected to physical and psychological abuse. The abuse was perpetrated by JNA personnel and paramilitaries, as well as civilians, and included beatings and mock executions. Many of the detainees were exchanged for prisoners of war held by Croatia on 12 December 1991. The two camps remained in operation until August 1992. Sveti Vlaho, the first vessel of the Armed Boats Squadron Dubrovnik, is on permanent display in Dubrovnik 11,425 buildings in the region sustained damage; 886 were totally destroyed and 1,675 sustained damage. The cost of the damage was estimated at 480 million Deutsche Marks. Damage to the Old Town of Dubrovnik was observed by a UNESCO team which stayed in the city from 27 November until 20 December 1991. It was estimated that 55.9 percent of buildings were damaged, that 11.1 percent were heavily damaged and one percent were burned down. Seven burnt Baroque palaces were the greatest losses. Additional damage was caused by the JNA troops looting museums, businesses and private homes. All exhibits held by Vlaho Bukovac Memorial Museum in Cavtat were taken away by the JNA, as were contents of hotels in Kupari. The Franciscan monastery of St. Jerome in Slano was also targeted. The JNA admitted that looting took place, but Jokić said the property would be distributed to Serbian refugees by a special JNA administration set up on 15 December 1991. It is probable, however, that the looted property ended up in private homes or was sold on the black market. Dubrovnik's Čilipi Airport was also targeted and its equipment taken to Podgorica and Tivat Airports. Following attempts to justify the JNA offensive, authorities in Serbia and Montenegro tried to deny damage to the Old Town. Radio Television of Serbia said that smoke rising from the Old Town was the result of automobile tyres set on fire by the population of Dubrovnik, echoing Kadijević. Officials and media in Montenegro referred to the offensive as the \\"war for peace\\", or a blockade—applying the term to land operations and the naval blockade. According to a 2010 survey of public opinion in Serbia, 40 percent of those polled did not know who bombarded Dubrovnik, while 14 percent believed that no shelling occurred. In a June 2000 meeting with Croatian President Mesić, the President of Montenegro Milo Đukanović apologized to Croatia for the attack. The gesture was welcomed in Croatia, but it was condemned by Đukanović's political opponents in Montenegro and by authorities in Serbia. In 2007, Montenegrin filmmaker Koča Pavlović released a documentary entitled Rat za mir (War for peace), covering the role of propaganda in the siege, testimonies of Morinj camp prisoners and interviews with JNA soldiers. In 2011, Radio Television of Montenegro broadcast a documentary series using archive footage titled Rat za Dubrovnik (War for Dubrovnik), although an attempt to destroy records of warmongering television and Pobjeda newspaper reports had been made. In 2012, Aleksandar Črček and Marin Marušić produced a feature documentary titled Konvoj Libertas (Libertas Convoy), which was about the delivery of humanitarian aid to Dubrovnik through the naval blockade. War crime charges Map of the Old Town indicating JNA bombardment damage Prosecutors of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), set up in 1993 and based on UN Security Council Resolution 827, indicted Milošević, Strugar, Jokić, the JNA 9th VPS chief of staff Captain Milan Zec and the commanding officer of the 3rd Battalion of the JNA 472nd Motorized Brigade Captain 1st Class Vladimir Kovačević. The charges included allegations that the offensive against Dubrovnik aimed to detach the area from Croatia and annex it to Serbia or Montenegro. Jokić said that the offensive only aimed to blockade Dubrovnik, but that claim was later refuted by Cokić. Mihailo Crnobrnja, a former Yugoslav ambassador to the European Union, speculated that the siege was intended to force an end to blockades of JNA barracks in Croatia and to claim the Prevlaka Peninsula for Montenegro. The trial of Slobodan Milošević was never completed because Milošević died on 11 March 2006 while in ICTY custody. Strugar was transferred to ICTY custody on 21 October 2001. The trial and appeals process was completed in 2008, with a final verdict of conviction of crimesincluding attacks on civilians, devastation not required by military necessity and violation of the laws and customs of war. He was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison. Strugar was granted an early release in 2009, seven years and four months after his transfer to the ICTY. Jokić was turned over to the ICTY on 12 November 2001. He pleaded guilty and was convicted of crimes including murder, cruel treatment, attacks on civilians and violations of laws of war. In 2004, he was sentenced to seven years in prison. The verdict was confirmed and became final in 2005. Jokić was transferred to Denmark to serve his sentence and was released on 1 September 2008. The ICTY withdrew charges against Zec on 26 July 2002. Kovačević was arrested in 2003 in Serbia and transferred to the ICTY. Following an insanity defence, he was provisionally released on 2 June 2004 and the proceedings were transferred to the judiciary in Serbia in 2007 and he underwent psychiatric treatment at the Military Medical Academy in Belgrade. , Kovačević was considered unfit to stand trial by authorities in Serbia. The charges against him include murder, cruel treatment, devastation not required by military necessity and violations of laws of war. In 2008, authorities in Montenegro charged six former JNA soldiers with prisoner abuse committed in Morinj in 1991 and 1992. Four of the six were convicted of war crimes in July 2013. Ivo Menzalin was given a four-year sentence, Špiro Lučić and Boro Gligić were sentenced to three years while Ivo Gonjić was sentenced to two. The four appealed the decision, and in April 2014, the Montenegrin Supreme Court rejected their appeal. A number of former prisoners of the Morinj camp sued Montenegro and were paid compensation. In October 2008, Croatia indicted Božidar Vučurevićthe mayor of Trebinje and Bosnian Serb leader in eastern Herzegovina at the time of the offensivefor attacks against the civilian population of Dubrovnik. Jokić confirmed that he received orders from both Strugar and Vučurević. On 4 April 2011, Vučurević was arrested in Serbia and Croatia requested his extradition. He was released on bail on 17 June. In September, the extradition request was approved but Vučurević left Serbia and returned to Trebinje, avoiding extradition. In 2009, Croatian authorities filed charges against ten JNA officers, including Cokić, Ružinovski, Strugar, Jokić, Zec and Kovačević. They were charged with war crimes committed in the area of Dubrovnik prior to or after 6 December 1991, which were not covered by the ICTY indictments. The charges were made after the ICTY supplied documents collected during its investigation. In 2012, Croatia indicted the commanding officer of the 3rd Battalion of the JNA 5th Motorized Brigade and charged him with arson for burning 90 houses, businesses and public buildings in Čilipi from 5 to 7 October 1991. The siege of Dubrovnik was also a subject in Croatia's genocide case against Serbia, before the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Croatia claimed 123 civilians from Dubrovnik were killed during the siege. Croatia presented letters from the Croatian police to support these claims, however, in its 2015 judgment the Court noted that all these letters were prepared much later, specifically for the case, were unsigned, and failed to indicate the circumstances under which the 123 were supposedly killed. Citing the Strugar and Jokić ICTY judgments on Dubrovnik, the ICJ in its own judgment recognized that at least two civilian deaths were caused by the unlawful shelling of Dubrovnik on 6 December and one further on 5 October 1991. However, these verdicts were incomplete, did not encompass the entire period of the siege save for these two days, and were restricted only to the old town, and not to the city of Dubrovnik as a whole. The judgement stated that the Court \\"concludes from the foregoing that it has been established that some killings were perpetrated by the JNA against the Croats of Dubrovnik between October and December 1991, although not on the scale alleged by Croatia\\".

He had a number of brushes with the authorities: imprisonment (wrongful) at the time of the Popish Plot and suspicion later of plotting against William III of England; also trouble for omitting Guy Fawkes Day from his almanacs.

Since the 80s, it has undergone significant urbanization. It is larger than most of the other districts. A high urbanization rate has made Gò Vấp become one of the three districts that has high population growth in the city. Specifically, Gò Vấp had 144,000 people in 1976, and the population increased to 223,000 people in 1995, 231,000 people in 2000, 413,000 people in 2003, and 455,000 people in 2004. From 1980 to 2003, the population of Gò Vấp increased to nearly 3 times its population, and on average, increased 13.66% annually. According to the population census in 2017, the population of Gò Vấp was 663,313 people.  Geography and administration  Nguyen Van Nghi street Gò Vấp is an urban district located in the north and northwest of Hồ Chí Minh City, Vietnam. Gò Vấp borders District 12 in the north and west, Phú Nhuận District in the south, Tân Bình District in the west, and Bình Thạnh District in the east. The total land area is . In July 1976, two wards (Bình Hòa and Thạnh Mỹ Tây) split from Gò Vấp District to create Bình Thạnh District. Later, the ward of Mỹ Bình joined Củ Chi District, and Nha Binh, Thành Lộc, An Phú Đông and Tân Thới Hiệp joined Hóc Môn District. Gò Vấp District now consists of 16 wards—1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17—and is mostly residential. Historically, Gò Vấp was part of Gia Định Province until 1976, when the province was renamed Hồ Chí Minh City.  Population  According to the population census in 2017 of Ho Chi Minh City's Census Bureau, the district's population was 663,313 people, and the population density was 33,602 people per square kilometer. There are 8 ethnic groups in Gò Vấp, which are the Kinh people (98%), the Hoa people (1.8%), and the other 6 minor ethnic groups (0.2%).

Tinling was born in Eastbourne, the son of James Alexander Tinling, a chartered accountant. He was educated at St Cyprian's School and Radley College. Tinling joined the Royal Air Force, but was invalided out following a flying accident in the early 1930s. He joined Dudley-Williams and Whittle in 1936 to develop Whittle's expired patent for a jet engine. Tinling, Whittle and Dudley- Williams shared 49% of the new company, with 51% held by the investment bankers OT Falk and Partners, which also provided loan finance. The company, Power Jets, was based at a factory in Rugby, Warwickshire belonging to British Thomson-Houston, a steam turbine company. The prototype jet engine was first run on 12 April 1937. Tinling married Eileen Nancy Edols on 22 December 1939, at St George's, Hanover Square. He became chairman of Power Jets in 1941, replacing Lance Whyte, and its prototype Gloster E28/39 first flew on 15 May 1941. Power Jets Ltd. was later bought by the British government, and Tinling remained on the board. Tinling died in late 1983 in Kent, survived by his wife. They are both buried in Benenden. He was the brother of Ted Tinling the sports fashion designer.

A 1944 illustration by Thomas C. Lea III of World War II: \\"The 2000 Yard Stare\\". The use of war as metaphor is a longstanding literary and rhetorical trope. In political usage, war metaphors are used to manage a perceived societal problem, with the concept taking the place of an individual or state enemy in true war. Philosopher James Childress describes the use of war as a metaphor as a dilemma: \\"In debating social policy through the language of war, we often forget the moral reality of war.\\" One fundamental problem is that it is often unclear when the \\"war\\" is over.

This episode is also known as \\"Bill's 75th Birthday\\". This episode was made by LWT for ITV. Written by The Goodies, with songs and music by Bill Oddie. Plot It is Bill's 40th birthday, and Tim and Graeme intend to celebrate it in grand style. An angry Bill, annoyed that he's getting older, arrives at the office and screams at his fellow Goodies to stop reminding him of his birthday. After Tim and Graeme ignore him and present him with a card and a cake (with no fewer than 75 candles), Bill flies into a rage, and accidentally ends up dumping the cake onto himself. A miserable Bill cheers up a little bit after catching a glimpse of his out-of-shape body in front of the mirror, and Graeme (assuming his doctor alter-ego \\"Dr Grayboots\\") offers to give Bill a makeover. Tim models the wildly over-the-top new looks available for Bill to choose, and after Bill decides on Graeme's Barbara Cartland look- alike option, he's told he will have to settle with what he's given. Graeme then decides that they all could use a makeover and enters their details into the computer, which also organises dates for the trio for the night. The Goodies hit the town to show off their new looks. Tim is sporting a curly blonde wig, beauty spot and false teeth. Graeme is given curly mop hair, a hairy chest and Groucho Marx-style glasses, nose and moustache. Bill sports a bouffant hairdo, platform shoes and ridiculous false chin. The Goodies wait to meet up with their dates, and soon discover that the computer organised three elderly ladies to be their companions for the night. The Goodies are led on a night of fun by the ladies - firstly to a pub, then a screening of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, then a disco. The weary Goodies eventually stagger from the disco, only to see the old ladies leave them and head off with a group of motorcyclists. The trio decide to close down their business due to old age, and Graeme stands on the office balcony threatening to commit suicide. Tim and Bill demand he make a last will and testament before he goes, and with all of his possessions given away, Graeme jumps. Tim is horrified and runs over to the ledge. As he's leaning over the ledge lamenting on \\"that little face stone dead looking up at me\\", Graeme emerges, revealing that he only jumped a couple of feet, and right onto Tim's dead tortoise Gilbert. Stating that it was just a test run, Graeme reveals his elaborate \\"doomsday machine\\", a Rube Goldberg- style execution machine, replete with a giant blade, a 200,000 volt trap, spears, a shotgun and tripwire, a noose and a 1-ton weight, designed to end it all. Graeme blindfolds himself and prepares to end it all, but as he's about to enter the machine, the telephone rings, but the call is for the Goodies' resident Robot. The Robot states that the Goodies is under new management and he's taken over. He accepts the job on offer, which makes the Goodies realise that they still want to carry on. The Robot states that they are not what they used to be, and Graeme says they can prove it by undertaking the \\"Goodies Standard Test\\", designed to see if they are still capable of carrying on as Goodies. The Robot will take over if they fail, but must do the test as well. Arriving at the testing centre, the Goodies and the Robot must jump hurdles and then change into their trademark Goodies costumes. Their first task is to make a patriotic speech, Tim does nothing but faint. The Robot fires off fireworks from the top of his head and plays a recording of Land of Hope and Glory, winning the task. The next task is to make a hit record. The Goodies are fruitless as they try to think of a hit record but the machine tells them \\"No conferring\\" and the Robot wins by doing his version of Funky Gibbon. The \\"Giant Kitten\\" from the Kitten Kong episode makes an appearance and chases after the Goodies, but as they are chased by the cat, the wires and crew members pulling it along are revealed, with the Goodies computer admonishing the lads for revealing how the special effects were achieved. The next task is Ecky Thump from the Kung Fu Kapers episode, Tim and Graeme prove no challenge for the Robot. Bill decides to blow up his black pudding to ridiculous size, but it soon explodes all over him, meaning the Goodies lose another task. The Goodies then flee the Golden Goose from The Goodies and the Beanstalk episode. The Goose drops a golden egg bomb, and the computer tells the crew to bring in the Goodies stunt dummies and to get the real Goodies out of the shot. The egg bomb hits the ground and blows the dummies into the air. Trademark jump cuts see the Goodies' dummy selves being replaced by their real selves, but the effect is ruined when Bill appears on the opposite side of the screen to his dummy. The computer orders \\"get the dummy out\\" and Bill promptly walks off screen. A crew member brings him back, with the computer saying \\"No, the other dummy!\\". The Goose appears again, and it's revealed the phony goose is attached to a crane and being driven along. The Robot blows up the goose, and then the Goodies are attacked by a cardboard cutout Nicholas Parsons. Making their escape on their trademark trandem bike, the Robot blows up Parsons. The Goodies crash their bike into a brick wall and a group of autograph hunters descend upon the Robot. The final scores are revealed. The Robot scored 53 points. Tim scored 24 points, Graeme scored 28. Bill scored just two, but their combined tally of 54 is enough to beat the Robot. Conceding defeat, the Robot gives the job he received to his rivals. It is then revealed the job is a BBC vacancy looking for \\"Three Goodies\\". Suddenly a job taken notice is placed over the job advert and the Goodies notice a trandem bike go past with their replacements - a trio of robots who have become the newest incarnations of the Goodies. Cultural references * The \\"Glasgow Messiah Fu Manchu\\" look, briefly modelled by Tim, is a reference to Billy Connolly. * Tim's other impersonations include Denis Healey and Barbara Cartland, as well as a 'cuddly toy' in reference to The Generation Game. * The grannies drag the Goodies to the cinema to see The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, a film refused a British certificate by the BBFC until 1999, but which was widely released to cinemas anyway after local town and city councils (including the Greater London Council) awarded it an X-certificate (the equivalent to today's 18 certificate). * The 'Goodies Standard Test' references several other episodes of The Goodies, including Kitten Kong, The Goodies and the Beanstalk, Kung Fu Kapers and The Goodies - Almost Live. * The final shot was originally intended to have been the Not the Nine O'Clock News team cycling into the BBC headquarters on a four-seater bike.

By adding this type qualifier, a programmer hints to the compiler that for the lifetime of the pointer, only the pointer itself or a value directly derived from it (such as ) will be used to access the object to which it points. \`restrict\` limits the effects of pointer aliasing, aiding optimizations. If the declaration of intent is not followed and the object is accessed by an independent pointer, this will result in undefined behavior. The use of this type qualifier allows C code to achieve the same performance as the same program written in Fortran. It was introduced in the C99 standard. C++ does not have standard support for \`restrict\`, but many compilers have equivalents that usually work in both C++ and C, such as the GCC's and Clang's \`__restrict__\`, and Visual C++'s \`__declspec(restrict)\`. In addition, \`__restrict\` is supported by those three compilers. The exact interpretation of these alternative keywords vary by the compiler: * In Unix-style compilers such as GCC and Clang, and means exactly the same as their C counterpart. Extensions include allowing it to be applied to reference types and . * In Visual C++, multiple no-alias qualifiers are provided: *# applies to the function declaraction and hints that the returned pointer is not aliased. *# is used in the same place as , but the no-alias hint does not propagate as in . It is also extended for union types.  Optimization  If the compiler knows that there is only one pointer to a memory block, it can produce better optimized code. For instance: void updatePtrs(size_t *ptrA, size_t *ptrB, size_t *val) { *ptrA += *val; *ptrB += *val; } In the above code, the pointers \`ptrA\`, \`ptrB\`, and \`val\` might refer to the same memory location, so the compiler may generate less optimal code: ; Hypothetical RISC Machine. ldr r12, [val] ; Load memory at val to r12. ldr r3, [ptrA] ; Load memory at ptrA to r3. add r3, r3, r12 ; Perform addition: r3 = r3 + r12. str r3, [ptrA] ; Store r3 to memory location ptrA, updating the value. ldr r3, [ptrB] ; 'load' may have to wait until preceding 'store' completes ldr r12, [val] ; Have to load a second time to ensure consistency add r3, r3, r12 str r3, [ptrB] However, if the \`restrict\` keyword is used and the above function is declared as void updatePtrs(size_t *restrict ptrA, size_t *restrict ptrB, size_t *restrict val); then the compiler is allowed to assume that \`ptrA\`, \`ptrB\`, and \`val\` point to different locations and updating the memory location referenced by one pointer will not affect the memory locations referenced by the other pointers. The programmer, not the compiler, is responsible for ensuring that the pointers do not point to identical locations. The compiler can e.g. rearrange the code, first loading all memory locations, then performing the operations before committing the results back to memory. ldr r12, [val] ; Note that val is now only loaded once ldr r3, [ptrA] ; Also, all 'load's in the beginning ..-. ldr r4, [ptrB] add r3, r3, r12 add r4, r4, r12 str r3, [ptrA] ; ... all 'store's in the end. str r4, [ptrB] The above assembly code is shorter because \`val\` is loaded only once. Also, since the compiler can rearrange the code more freely, the compiler can generate code that executes faster. In the second version of the above example, the \`store\` operations are all taking place after the \`load\` operations, ensuring that the processor won't have to block in the middle of the code to wait until the \`store\` operations are complete. Note that the real generated code may have different behaviors. Benefit with the above mini-example tends to be small, and in real-life cases large loops doing heavy memory access tends to be what is really helped by restrict. As mentioned above, how incorrect code behaves is undefined, the compiler only ensures the generated code works properly if the code follows the declaration of intent. Compiler warnings To help prevent incorrect code, some compilers and other tools try to detect when overlapping arguments have been passed to functions with parameters marked . The CERT C Coding Standard considers misuse of and library functions marked with it (EXP43-C) a probable source of software bugs, although as of November 2019 no vulnerabilities are known to have been caused by this.

Biography Bašičević was born in Šid, which was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and is now in Serbia and died in 1972 in Šid. His parents were peasant farmersIlija Bosilj Basicevic at Galerie St. Etienne and he only received about four years of school before starting work on the farm. He left the country during both World War I to escape conscription and during World War II to avoid the Ustaše. He resisted collective farming and was periodically jailed on dubious charges by the political police. He began doing painting in 1957. His first major showing was at a Belgrade gallery in 1963, and was very controversial because of Bašičeviċ's political stance. The painter took the surname \\"Bosilj\\" as a pseudonym for the showings. From the 1960s to the 1980s, his work was popular in Europe, often showcased in Zagreb and Belgrade but also Amsterdam and Paris. He donated his collection of paintings as the legacy to his native town. He died in Šid in 1972. Ilija Bašičeviċ's son Dimitrije Bašičević was an art critic and became involved in a \\"naïve art\\" movement started by the USSR which rejected \\"decadent\\" modernism, and the father was inspired to paint. His son disapproved at first, because Ilija's work was not as precise or refined as the official Hlebene School's Reverse painting on glass techniques. Bašičeviċ's work is partially art brut and partially naïve art and most of his work is oil on canvas. Much of his work dealt with religion and folk legends and two-headed and two-faced creatures are a common theme. Unlike the traditional peasant style of his region, Bosilj created a flat two-dimensional world often inhabited by men and demons, snakes, fish, anthropomorphic creatures and spacemen.Outsider Art Sourcebook, ed. John Maizels, Raw Vision, Watford, 2009, p.51 He gave many of his paintings to found an art museum in his home town in 1970.Ilija Basicevic - Bosilj  Ilijanum  Artistic Style  Ilija’s oeuvre can be classified into a few thematic units. Most numerous are the presentations of the Biblical, especially Old Testament motifs. Then the motifs inspired by epics, legends and myths followed. In the Iliad Cycle, which has nothing in common with the famous Homer’s epic but is related to the painter’s name, the artistic allusions to the real world and his fights against human foolishness, duplicity and hypocrisy are often. Then, he portrays the cycle with figures of real and imaginary animals. A significant part of his oeuvre includes the flying astrological beings. Ilija’s works are not descriptive, but are allegorical with multi-layered and symbolical context. He does not make difference between the presentation of an apocalyptic angel or modern astronaut, kings of Apocalypse and kings of Iliad, between a simple and an apocalyptic bird etc. Ilija creates the anti-illusionistic, the abstract. He does not use perspective; he eliminates reminiscences; he generalizes and prefigures by using symbols. Two-headed beings denote the duplicity of everything presented. In Biblical scenes or Serbian myths, legends and epics, the dynamics and morale prevail, while in scenes from Iliad we find humor, irony and grotesque. In these presentations, the artist tried to demythologize Biblical heroes and historical characters. His works are not descriptive, since they are the product of a self-taught visionary and instinctive neo- primitive. He most often used allegory with a multi-layered connotation. The mere names of his paintings, like in Sekulić and Jakić, help us to get acquainted with his world full of personal symbolism. He created in anti- illusionist and abstract manner, eliminated reminiscences and generalized due to his purely authentic understanding of the realistic. Ilija’s dynamic treatment of the colored structure points to outstandingly modern dimension of his pictorial expression. The backgrounds in his paintings are often empty and flat, while rhythmically sequenced figures are floating, animated with wavy lines. The colour is raw, of visible ductus. Golden background is characteristic in the paintings of the special cycle.N. Krstić, Outsider Art in Serbia, MNMA, Јагодина, 2014, pp. 56-63  Exhibitions and awards  He had exhibitions in the country and abroad and was awarded many times. He is the greatest representative of art brut in Serbia. On the Third Triennial of Naive Art in Bratislava in 1972, Ilija was posthumously awarded special recognition by an international Jury for his achievements in the domain of naïve and marginal art. The greatest collection of his paintings is in the Museum Ilijanum, in Šid (Serbia). He is a worldly classic.

His work and research contributed greatly to the development of abstract art in Croatia. He was a national of Yugoslavia. Life and work Dimitrije Bašičević, later to assume the pseudonym Mangelos in his artistic practice, was born into a farming family in Šid, Serbia on April 21, 1921. His father was the Serbian artist, Ilja Bašičević, known as a practitioner of Naive Art or Outsider Art. Bašičević studied art history and philosophy in Vienna (1942–44) and Zagreb (1945–49). In 1957 he completed a PhD on the topic of the work of artist Sava Šumanović. He worked for a time as a curator and assistant in the Yugoslavian academy of art and science. In 1952, he founded the Peasant Art Gallery, which he would develop into the Gallery of Primitive Art and act as curator for until 1964. This institution endures today as the Croatian Museum of Naive Art. In 1971, Bašičević became the chairman of the Center for Film Photography and Television, part of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Zagreb. He organized numerous exhibitions both within and outside Croatia which contributed to the growth of abstract art in eastern Europe. His writings on photography and art were frequently published. In 1982, he went into retirement and died on December 18, 1987. As early as primary school Mangelos authored short prose pieces and poems, and began producing his first artistic works in 1941. He adopted the pseudonym Mangelos is 1959; it derives from the name of a small city near where he was born. He was a founding member of the avant-garde Gorgona Group and from 1975 became involved in the Group of Six Artists. Mangelos kept his artistic practice private, releasing works sometimes through the group-authorship of Gorgona or not at all. His first exhibition took place in 1968 in Belgrade, motivated as he was by the new generation of conceptual artists and critics. His theoretical and artistic practice engaged with the use of language, letters and texts. Originating from a desire to create Anti-Art, he used words and letter-forms as elements in paintings, in an attempt to negate the irrationality of the act of painting through the rational act of writing. Conversely, his painted text-works, which often combined languages and ripped letters or words from their life-giving context, negated the rationality of writing through the conversion of text to pure shape and form.http://www.peterfreemaninc.com/exhibitions/mangelos-les-lettres-et-les- mots/pressrelease/ \\"negating a picture creating it from words, negating a word by painting it to make its meaning different from the one when it was written; I was convinced that the meaning of the word or the painting elapses…\\" \\\\- Mangelos http://www.mbasicevic.net/mangelos_others.html Is his manifestos he discussed the possibility of progress within society during a simultaneous standstill in art. He argues that the ancient, while ingenious, mind cannot follow the rapid development of the 'Machine Civilization'. In his 1978 manifesto, 'Shid Theory' he develops the 'psycho- biological' hypothesis that as the human organism, and therefore also the personality, renews itself every seven years, his life can be subdivided into the existence of 9 1/2 Mangelos'. In addition to spiritual tendencies, Mangelos' work is characterized by irony, intermediality, expressionistic nihilism and his unique experiment of „No-Art“.http://archiv.fridericianum- kassel.de/ausst/bilder2003/mangelos_lepo01.pdf He died in Zagreb, Croatia, aged 66.

Work on the sinking of Treeton Colliery commenced, with all due ceremony, in October 1875. Trade, at the time, was in a poor state and the company was short of capital so work was suspended three years later not being resumed until March, 1882. The colliery was owned by the Rother Vale Collieries Limited which was founded in the same year, bringing together the new workings with collieries at Fence and Orgreave. This became part of the United Steel Companies Limited following the end of World War I. From its beginnings until 1965 Treeton worked the Barnsley seam and the High Hazels seam until the following year. After nationalisation it was decided to increase the output of the Wathwood seam and to reopen the Swallow Wood seam which had fallen into disuse in 1947. This came on stream in 1972 and lasted until the colliery closed on 7 December 1990. These two seams produced house coal. Rail connections The colliery was situated adjacent to the North Midland Railway line at Treeton and connected with this. It was also connected to the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway by a branch line which passed via Orgreave Colliery. Until May 1932 when storms caused parts of three bridges on the branch to be washed away the colliery was served by a Paddy Mail which operated at shift change times from Sheffield Victoria and Darnall to serve both Orgreave and Treeton.

Date and sources The play is usually dated to c. 1619–23. It could not have been written earlier than 1619, when one of its primary sources, Los Trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda by Cervantes, was translated into English.Terence P. Logan and Denzell S. Smith, eds., The Later Jacobean and Caroline Dramatists: A Survey and Bibliography of Recent Studies in English Renaissance Drama, Lincoln, NE, University of Nebraska Press, 1978; p. 37. Cinthio's Hecatommithi also provided material for the play. Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, describes The Custom of the Country as an \\"old play\\" in an entry in his record book dated 22 November 1629. Performance The play was performed by the King's Men. The 1647 text provides this cast list: Joseph Taylor, John Lowin, John Underwood, Robert Benfield, Nicholas Tooley, William Ecclestone, Richard Sharpe, and Thomas Holcombe. (The folio provides the same cast list for two roughly contemporaneous plays in the canon, Fletcher's Women Pleased and Fletcher and Massinger's The Little French Lawyer.)E. H. C. Oliphant, The Plays of Beaumont and Fletcher: An Attempt to Determine Their Respective Shares and the Shares of Others. New Haven, Yale University Press, 1927; pp. 156 and 224. The cast list indicates a date of first performance after Taylor joined the company in the Spring of 1619, and before Tooley's death in June 1623. Authorship Critics and scholars since the nineteenth century have recognised that the play is a Fletcher/Massinger collaboration. Cyrus Hoy, in his wide-ranging survey of authorship problems in the Fletcher canon, arrives at a division of authorship that is essentially the same as those of earlier commentators like E. H. C. Oliphant:Oliphant, p. 225. :Fletcher — Act I; Act III, scenes 1–3; Act IV, 3–5; Act V, 5 (middle portion); :Massinger — Act II; Act III, scenes 4–5; Act IV, 1–2; Act V, 1–4, and 5 (beginning and ending). The play was revived in adapted forms after the theatres re-opened with the Restoration. Colley Cibber's version, Love Makes a Man, dates to 1700, while Charles Johnson's The Country Lasses appeared in 1715. The play belongs to a sub- category of Fletcher works sometimes called \\"chastity plays\\" for their concern with that subject. This sexual emphasis disturbed many traditional critics, though The Custom of the Country has been cited as \\"one of the most lively and amusing\\" of Fletcher's chastity plays.Logan and Smith, p. 38. Synopsis Count Clodio is an Italian governor who claims the traditional right of droit du seigneur; he is also the suitor of Zenocia. Against her father Charino's advice, Zenocia prefers Arnoldo, a young man travelling with his older brother Rutilio. Arnoldo and Zenocia marry, and resist Clodio's attempt to claim his \\"right\\" with Zenocia; they escape with Clodio in hot pursuit. Reaching the seacoast, the three young people are waylaid by Leopold, the captain of a Portuguese vessel. The two young men escape by swimming to shore, but Zenocia falls into Leopold's clutches. Leopold takes Zenocia to Lisbon, and places her in the service of Hippolita, with the understanding that Zenocia will advance his suit to Hippolita. Hippolita, however, has fallen in love with a young man just arrived in town...who is Arnoldo, chasing after his lost wife. When Arnoldo resists Hippolita, she has him arrested under a false accusation of theft; but she relents, and intervenes to save him from the death sentence he receives. But when Hippolita realises that Arnoldo loves Zenocia, she tries to have the girl strangled. The murder attempt is interrupted by the arrival of Manuel the Lisbon governor, with Clodio in tow; Zenocia is released. The frustrated Hippolita has recourse to witchcraft: the witch Sulpitia causes Zenocia to sicken by melting a wax image of her. Arnoldo, however, sickens in sympathy with his wife, and Hippolita, still in love with him, is forced to relent. Clodio too gives up on his quest for Zenocia, and also renounces his commitment to droit du seigneur. The related subplot concerns the adventures of Rutilio, who fights a duel with Manuel's arrogant young nephew Duarte and apparently kills him. Rutilio is unknowingly sheltered by his opponent's mother Guidomar, the arrested by the watch, then ransomed by Sulpitia for her sexual service. Rutilio is redeemed from this servitude by a recovered and repentant Duarte, and eventually marries Guidomar. Reception and history John Dryden referred to the play in his Essay of Dramatick Poesie; he is concerned to defend Restoration plays from the charge of lewdness, and claims that there is more \\"bawdry\\" in this play than in all later plays combined. The play was rarely staged even during the century after Fletcher's death, when his plays remained current on the stage. In 1998, it received a staged reading at the new Globe Theatre in London. It forms part of the 2013 Actors' Renaissance Season at the American Shakespeare Center's Blackfriars Playhouse. Edith Wharton entitled her 1913 novel The Custom of the Country after this play.

The US government's position is that the office was used by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards as a local headquarters. However, both Iranian and Kurdish officials state that it was a diplomatic mission in the city of Erbil in Kurdistan Region. Iraqi Kurdistan condemned the raid. Iran argued the act is illegal. The US said this action was required under the U.S.–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement. Iran retaliated with similar raids. On July 9, 2009, US authorities released the five diplomats (Mohsen Bagheri, Mahmoud Farhadi, Majid Ghaemi, Majid Dagheri and Abbas Jami), after more than two and a half years imprisonment. The raid According to Iranian officials, five U.S. helicopters landed on the roof of the liaison office in Erbil. U.S. soldiers entered the building, detained five people and took away materials. The raid occurred between 3 and 5 a.m., when the U.S. troops entered the liaison office after disarming the guards. Two senior local Kurdish officials said the forces confiscated computers and documents. In a report which was later confirmed by Massoud Barzani, the President of the Kurdistan Regional Government,Kurd: U.S. Sought Other Iranians in Raid, The Guardian, April 7, 2007 The Independent noted that instead of the current captives, the U.S. had hoped to capture the deputy head of the Iranian Supreme National Security Council, Mohammed Jafari, and chief of intelligence of the IRGC, General Manuchehr Frouzandeh, who were on an official visit to Iraq ostensibly to improve co-operation in the area of bilateral security, during which they met the Iraqi President Jalal Talabani. Barzani stated: \\"They (the commanders) came here and they came openly. Their meetings with the president and myself were reported on television. The Americans came to detain this delegation, not the people in the office. They came to the wrong place at the wrong time.\\" It was also reported that U.S. troops attempted to detain people at the Erbil airport that same day, but Kurdish forces intervened. Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said that there was almost a confrontation between U.S. and Kurdish troops at the airport but that \\"a massacre was avoided at the last minute.\\" The raid took place within hours of U.S. President George W. Bush claiming \\"Iran is providing material support for attacks on American troops\\" in an address to the nation. This was not the first time the United States had arrested alleged IRGC members in Iraq. A few weeks before, on 29 December, U.S. forces in Iraq released alleged Iranian IRGC members who were detained for alleged weapons smuggling after a raid conducted 21 December in Baghdad.IndiaDaily Status of office The Iranian liaison office in Erbil has been active and operating since 1992. The various governments dispute the exact status of the office. According to Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari, the detained Iranians had been working in Erbil with official sanction, and the liaison office was in the process of becoming a full consulate; however the office was yet to be classified as a consulate with diplomatic protection. Iran states that based on an agreement between the Governments of Iran and Iraq its status was officially changed to a Consulate General, and official note verbale (diplomatic notes) were exchanged between the two countries accordingly. According to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations consulates enjoy immunity and all members of the U.N. have to respect such immunity. Officials of the Kurdistan Regional Government said that consular activities, such as the issuance of visas, had been carried out by the office staff since 1992, and they were treated as if they were accredited diplomats.US silent on detained Iranians, Asia Times, 31 March 2007 The U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the detainees were not diplomats. Reactions Masoud Barzani condemned the capture and demanded the quick release of Iranians. Kurdistani government was reportedly unaware of the US plans to raid the Iranian liaison office and did not know the purpose of the operation. After raiding the office, the US forces headed for Eikawa district, which hosts foreign companies and countries' representatives. Security forces of the Democratic Party of Kurdistan (KDP) reportedly surrounded three US military vehicles to prevent them from further action. Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini told state-run radio the raid was against a diplomatic mission since the presence of Iranian staffers in Erbil was legal. Hosseini said the action by coalition forces reflected a continuation of pressure on Iran, aiming to \\"create tension\\" between Iraq and its neighbors. In Tehran, Iran summoned the ambassadors of Iraq and Switzerland (which represents US interests in Iran) over the consulate raid. The UN Secretary General's described the incident as \\"disputes between individual states\\". A UN spokesman said \\"We've left it to the respective countries to work it out among themselves ... Ultimately it's up to Security Council members themselves to determine how its resolutions get implemented.\\" On March 10 at a meeting of envoys in Baghdad the Iranian delegation raised the issue of the five detained Iranians. A US spokesman said that Iraq had asked the US side to investigate the circumstances involving the detention. Iran says it was assured by Iraq that the five would be released by March 21, the Iranian new year.Mideast security talks face delay, Financial Times, 28 March 2007 Some claim that the increased diplomatic tension created by this incident lead to the Iranian seizure of 15 Royal Navy personnel in a border dispute two months later. =Alleged retaliation= According to American journalist Robin Wright, the 2007 seizure of fifteen British sailors in the Persian Gulf was likely connected to the holding of the five Iranian officials. The seizure of the British came three days after Nowruz, a date that the Iranian government had announced that it expected the five officials to be freed by, and which passed without their release. \\"The common denominator was the Revolutionary Guards.\\" Iranians being held by the US were \\"Quds Force operatives\\" (the foreign operation branch of the Revolutionary Guards), while the Iranian naval unit that had taken the British hostage were also Revolutionary Guards.Wright, Robin, Dreams and Shadows : the Future of the Middle East, Penguin Press, 2008 p.335 When the Sailors were released twelve days later and the five Iranians remained in detained, \\"Tehran shifted its focus\\", according to Wright. One month later four Iranian Americans with dual nationalities—Ali Shakeri, Haleh Esfandiari, Kian Tajbakhsh, Parnaz Azima—were detained for unspecified \`crimes against national security.\`Wright, Robin, Dreams and Shadows : the Future of the Middle East, Penguin Press, 2008 p.335-6 In custody The Iranian consular officers were: Naser Bagheri, Mousa Chegini, Abbas Hatami Kakavand, Hamid Askari Shokouh and Majid Ghaemi. Under Iraqi law, detainees identified as insurgents should be charged in civilian courts. They may be held up to 14 days before being brought before a magistrate. These requirements appear to be systematically ignored in practice. In this incident, the Iraqi government denies that the detainees were helping insurgents. In 2008 three of the five Iranian detainees were being held at a U.S. prison camp in Iraq. According to the United States Defense Department they were under interrogation and the U.S. had \\"no plans to free them while they are seen as a security risk in Iraq\\". An International Committee of the Red Cross representative met the five Iranian employees in March 2008 and reported \\"they were in good health.\\" However, this claim has been doubted by the families of the captured workers, stating they worry about the circumstances they were in, and whether they might be under prolonged torture by Americans to acquire false confessions.mms://217.218.67.244/presstv/070517/diplomats.wmv After its first consular meeting with the captives, Iran announced that the \\"[detainees] have complained about their kidnapping, the US attitude and non-observance of international regulations.\\" =Release of some Iranians= On November 9, 2007, United States released two of the detainees (after 305 days) as well as 7 other Iranian citizens. The other seven Iranians being freed had been picked up in different parts of the country and held for periods ranging between three months and three years.

AJOYA should not be confused with the Australia's \\"Aviation Journalist of the Year\\" Awards, issued by that country's National Aviation Press Club (at least during 2010, in Sydney, Australia). Those awards were restricted to writers from Australia and New Zealand. For more on those awards in 2010, see: \\"Australian Aviation’s McLaughlin ‘Aviation Journalist of the Year’\\", on australianaviation.com.au December 6, 2010. Overview The international Aerospace Journalist of the Year Awards (abbreviated \\"AJOYA\\") were awards for writers and broadcasters working in the aerospace and aviation field, including specialists and those working for non-specialist titles. The awards dinner took place in mid-July (timed to coincide with the Farnborough Air Show and the Paris Air Show), and brought together aviation media and industry representatives. The awards were organised between 1996\\"Air Safety Week's David Evans Wins International Aerospace Journalist of the Year Award\\" (POTOMAC, MD, July 22, 2004), posted July 23 2004 on swissair111.org and 2010 by Malcolm Turner and his company (the \\"World Leadership Forum, Ltd,\\" of the UK) under the auspices of the Royal Aeronautical Society of the U.K. and the Aero Club of France (Aéro-Club de France).\\"The World Leadership Forum Limited\\" page, in the business-information database-website Duedil.com The Awards, given annually, were typically organized in a hierarchy: * 1.)

The \\"DECADE OF EXCELLENCE\\" Award was also awarded each year (based on judges' scores), for the most outstanding aerospace journalist of the previous ten years. Trophies The AJOYA awards were originally trophies in the form of a bronze eagle - leading the awards to become known colloquially as 'budgies', and for the competition to become known as the 'Budgie Awards'. The design of the Trophy changed several times, becoming a representation of the Aerospace Journalist of the Year logo, and then a simple engraved glass 'spike'. History The aerospace industry's writing awards, previously for many years (1960s to mid/late-1990s), had been awarded annually by the U.S.-based Aviation & Space Writers' Association, at a grand banquet gathering aviation industry leaders and luminaries. That organization and its awards program dissolved, leaving a vacuum in the aviation media world. Starting in the late 1990s, until 2009-2010, that void was filled by a British enterprise—the World Leadership Forum, Ltd.  in collaboration with the world's two oldest aviation organizations: the Aero Club of France (Aéro-Club de France), and the Royal Aeronautical Society (of the United Kingdom).\\"Craig Covault Wins 2009 Aerospace Journalist of the Year Award\\", Chuck Oldham (Editor) on July 16, 2009, DefenseMediaNetwork.com Awards were issued in several \\"Category\\" topic areas (see lists below). Contest entries (copies of published articles or broadcasts) were received from publications and authors, then copied and redistributed to judges in each category, who then narrowed the submissions down to a few finalists (the prestigious \\"Shortlist\\") in each category, which was then published on the organization website during the months leading up to the Banquet. The \\"Shortlist\\" candidates were invited to the Awards Banquet, where they would then discover who, among them, would be awarded the \\"Aerospace Journalist of the Year Award\\" in that respective category. Then from the category winners, a tally of judges' scores determined the one overall \\"Aerospace Journalist of the Year,\\" and one Honoree for a \\"Decade of Excellence\\" Award. The awards were first presented in London in 1996, and throughout the years, the presentation ceremonies have alternated between Paris and London—roughly coinciding with the world's two main airshows: the Paris Air Show and Farnborough Air Show (England), held on alternate years. In London, the AJOYA ceremonies have taken place at the Ballroom of the Park Lane Hotel, Piccadilly,\\"Vayu nominated again for The 2010 Aerospace Journalist of the Year Awards\\" , Vayu Aerospace and Defence Review, posted in 2010 and at the Royal Courts of Justice and they directly preceded the biennial Farnborough Airshow. The organization depended upon aerospace industry companies to sponsor the awards, and reciprocated their generosity by offering them seating with the AJOYA finalists at the awards banquet—a public-relations opportunity for aerospace industry leaders and P.R. execs to charm their industry's leading writers and opinion-shapers. However, remotely located from most of the world's aviation media (in London or Paris, far removed from the Americas, Africa and Asia), many aerospace writers who made the awards-finalist \\"Shortlists\\" (and were thus invited to the banquet), were unable to attend—undermining the value of the banquet, and sponsorships, to AJOYA's commercial sponsors. The awards then began to be limited to only those writers who would make the trip to the banquet, sharply reducing eligibility for the awards. Initially, relatively few of the world's aerospace journalists competed, and the awards were almost exclusively from the U.S. and Britain, with a few contestants from Western Europe and British Commonwealth nations. But as the years went by, many more entered the contests, and additional categories of judging were added, and non-English entries were admitted (and translated into English for the judges), drawing contest entries from throughout the world—Russia and Eastern Europe, China and East Asia, South Asia, Latin America and Africa. The volume of entries began to overwhelm the limited number of AJOYA judges, creating difficuties. The global economic \\"Great Recession\\" that started in 2007 soon collapsed the aerospace industry, and forced drastic budget-tightening on nearly all aerospace companies. \\"Extras\\"—such as support of aviation organizations and programs—were cut out of many companies' budgets. The awards ended amid rumours that they folded due to a lack of sponsorship. The World Leadership Forum, Ltd. organization dissolved in 2009, according to the business-info website Duedil.com. The AJOYA.com website is now off-line and the domain name is for sale. There were no awards in 2011, and in 2012 a different organiser held a new Aerospace Media Awards dinner at the Royal Aeronautical Society in London. Judges Judges were chiefly leading aerospace industry editors & writers, and business/technical leaders & experts—largely chosen from the ranks of former AJOYA Winners or \\"Shortlist\\" finalists—from around the world. The judges came from aerospace industry publications such as: * Aero Revue * Aviation International News * Aviation Week & Space Technology * Business & Commercial Aviation * Flight International * Jane's Defence Weekly To ensure fair judging, judges were recused from voting on their own submissions, and from voting on any other submissions from any publication for whom they wrote, or any \\"sister\\" publication (owned by the same, or a related, company). The final list of AJOYA judges (see below) finished with the note: \\"The judges have not marked any entry from their own publication/company, or any sister publication/company\\" This is the last list of Judges, which remained on the AJOYA.COM website until 2010: 2009 Judges: * Charles Alcock, Editorial Director, Aviation International News * Guy Anderson, Editor, Jane's Defence Industry * Patricia Andrighetto, Editor, Aero Revue * James Asker, Managing Editor, Aviation Week & Space Technology * Tom Ballantyne, Chief Correspondent, Orient Aviation * Douglas Barrie, London Bureau Chief, Aviation Week & Space Technology * Elaine Camhi, Editor-in-Chief, Aerospace America * James Careless, Freelance journalist, TJT Design & Communication * Bill Carey, Editor in Chief, Avionics Magazine * Rob Coppinger, Technical Editor, Flight International * Nick Fadugba, Publisher & Editor, African Aviation * Bernard Fitzsimons, Freelance Journalist * William Garvey, Editor-in-Chief, Business & Commercial Aviation magazine * Ian Goold, Aviation Journalist * Bruce Hales- Dutton, Freelance Journalist, Editor & Consultant * Richard Harris, Aviation Writer * Ed Hazelwood, Editor-In-Chief, Aviation Week & Space Technology * Hans Heerkens, Aviation Analyst & Assistant Professor, University of Twente * Johnny Keggler, Editor, Armada International * Paul Lewis, Director of International Communications, Boeing IDS * Alexander Mladenov, Consulting Editor, Klub Krile * Julian Nott, Aviation Consultant * Don Peterson, President, Universal Analyzers Inc * Elliot Pulham, President & CEO, The Space Foundation * David Rimmer, Executive Vice President, ExcelAire Service LLC * John Sharman, Executive Director, Spectrum Capital London Limited * Rod Simpson, Editor, Aviation World * Michael Simpson, President, International Space University * Vikramjit Singh Chopra, Editor-in-Chief, Vayu Aerospace Review * Pierre Sparaco, Freelance journalist (former European Bureau Chief, Aviation Week & Space Technology) * Lee Ann Tegtmeier, Managing Editor, Overhaul & Maintenance * Aimee Turner, Senior Editor, Flight International * Tony Velocci, Editor-in-Chief, Aviation Week & Space Technology * Brian Walters, Freelance Journalist * Howard Wheeldon, Senior Strategist, BGC Partners * Mark Williamson, Space Technology Consultant Categories The categories for the awards include: * Air Show Daily * Air Show Submission * Air Transport * Avionics * Breaking News * Business Aircraft * Business or Financial * Defence * General Aviation * Maintenance * Propulsion * Regional Aircraft * Safety * Space * Systems or Technology * Decade of Excellence Winners Winners are grouped below into: * THE DECADE OF EXCELLENCE Winner (one per year) * THE AEROSPACE JOURNALIST OF THE YEAR (overall) Winner (one per year) * The CATEGORY WINNERS (one in EACH CATEGORY, each year) * (NOTE: The Shortlist Finalists in each category are NOT listed below).

The development is located in the Colegate area at the centre of Norwich, Norfolk, bounded on one side by the River Wensum and by a park and two notable bridges to the east and west. Several historic churches surround the site creating an attractive and varied landscape. The population is included in the Mancroft ward of Norwich City. The original design consists of an arrangement of terraces that include a series of open spaces winding through the scheme culminating in a principal space facing water stairs and a ramp to the Wensum. Elevations are economical in conception with a richness in variety and spacing. There is simple paving and the use of rolled gravel in the surfaces to the highways and communal areas. The development was the subject of an article in the Architectural Review in 1975. In recognition of the quality of the design Norwich City Council proposed in early 2004 to apply for Article 4 (2) Direction in order to reinforce the covenants that exist on the development. In April 2007 the City Council indicated that it would not proceed with Article 4 Direction but would instead place the development on its list of buildings of architectural importance. Friars Quay forms part of the City Centre Conservation area. In the 1970s Norwich City Council was seeking ways to encourage people to live in the centre of historic Norwich. Friars Quay was built on the former Jewsons Timber Yard. City of Norwich formed a partnership with local developer RG Carter Ltd., to redevelop this prominent city centre industrial site. The scheme consists of 40 four and five bedroom townhouses and 9 ground floor flats. On 3 May 1972 planning permission was given for \\"the development of a builders' merchants premises by the construction of roads, footpaths and 24 parking spaces and the erection of forty houses (22 with integral garages) at Colegate\\". Included in the reasons for granting planning permission was \\"to protect and improve the amenity of the area, and ensure the maximum public use of the riverside\\". The architect responsible for the design was David Luckhurst of Feilden & Mawson. Friars Quay has a very active Residents Association which has been involved in discussions regarding conservation. History The history of the site must reflect the history of the River Wensum itself. The immediate history however relates to the use of the site as a timber yard until it was made available for development. Jewsons Timber Yard was established by John Wilson Jewson who shipped in timbers by wherries from Great Yarmouth. In 1868 George Jewson purchased a 17th-century house in Colegate which was used as the headquarters of the business. His son Richard (1867 to 1949) established Jewsons as the largest timber merchants between the Thames and the Humber. Richard became Lord Mayor of Norwich in 1917. The land was purchased by Norwich City Council in 1970. References External links *Friars Quay Norwich - A Framework For Change.

Felsztyn, as the settlement is called in Polish, was founded in 1374 by King Ludwik Węgierski. In 1488, Kazimierz Jagiellończyk brought in German burghers (the Herburt :pl:Herburtowie family from Silesia and Moravia) and granted the Magdeburg rights. Skelivka was in previous times variously known as Fulsztyn, Folsteyn, Felstin, Fullensteyn, Fulsthine and Fulstin (1593). It is located a few kilometres from the border with Poland, in the eastern part of Bieszczady. During 966 - 1018, 1340 - 1772 (Ruthenian Voivodeship, Przemysl County) and during 1918 - 1939 Felsztyn was part of Poland (Województwo lwowskie). From 1772 to 1918 it belonged to the Austrian Empire (later the Austro-Hungarian Empire when the double monarchy was introduced in Austria). Jan Herburt, Starost of Sanok, owner of Felsztyn On September 17, 1939, Felsztyn was incorporated into the Soviet Union, and since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, is part of independent Ukraine. Skelivka is located near the towns of Przemyśl (in southeastern Poland) and Dobromil and Stryj (in western Ukraine). It is situated below the main watershed at the foot of the Carpathian Mountains, and has an elevation of 250 metres. In the interwar years, Felsztyn had a mixed population of Poles, Ukrainians and Jews. The Jews were killed in World War II, while the area's Poles were deported to Siberia in cattle trucks after the Soviet invasion. Many of these Poles died in Siberia, some were able to leave Siberia with General Anders Army, while others eventually returned to Felsztyn in 1956 only to find their homes occupied by strangers or demolished. Most surviving Poles were moved to western Poland (mainly Lower Silesia) in the late 1940s and 1950s. After World War II, some Lemkos from Poland were moved to the renamed Skelivka. Today Skelivka is inhabited by Ukrainians and Lemkos. Until World War II, the town had a Roman Catholic church (and adjacent cemetery) which catered to the Polish population. During Soviet times the church was used as a barn and shed. It is now being restored as a Greek Catholic church. A railway station of the Zagórz-Khyriv-Dobromyl railroad is located in Skelivka.

He was born Charles-Baptiste Bouc in Terrebonne, the son of a merchant, and was involved in the trade of grain and furs, as well as lending money. In 1785, he married Archange Lepage. He inherited some livestock and property from his father. In 1796, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada for Effingham. He was found guilty of defrauding a local wheat farmer in 1799 and he was jailed and then expelled from his seat in the house. In 1800, Bouc was elected again but was again expelled. Bouc was elected in subsequent by-elections and expelled two more times. Alexis Caron, a lawyer who later was elected to the legislative assembly for Surrey, represented Bouc. In April 1802, the assembly passed a bill with the explicit stated purpose of preventing Bouc from ever sitting in the assembly. Pierre-Amable de Bonne and members of the Bureaucrat party supported the expulsion of Bouc; many of the members of the parti canadien opposed these actions. Angus Shaw was elected for Effingham after Bouc had been expelled for the last time. Bouc continued to be a leading figure in the community until he was convicted of treasonable practices in 1807 and then for fraud and theft in 1811. He was forced to retire from business and sell some of his property to cover his debts. He died at Terrebonne in 1832.

The Kaisariani Monastery () is an Eastern Orthodox monastery built on the north side of Mount Hymettus, near Athens, Greece. History The monastery was probably established in Byzantine times in ca. 1100, which is the date of construction of the surviving church (the monastery's katholikon). Nevertheless, the site has a far longer history as a cult center: in Antiquity, it was probably a site dedicated to Aphrodite, before being taken over by Christians in the 5th/6th centuries. Remains of a large early Christian basilica lie to the west, over which a smaller church was built in the 10th/11th centuries. The monastery is mentioned by Pope Innocent III after the Fourth Crusade, but seems to have remained in Greek Orthodox hands, unlike other churches and monasteries that were taken over by Latin (Roman Catholic) clergy. A further, now ruined single-aisled church, was built to the southwest during the Frankish period. When, in 1458, the Turks occupied Attica, Sultan Mehmed II went to the monastery and, according to Jacob Spon (1675), a French doctor from Lyon, that is where he was given the key to the city. In 1678, Patriarch Dionysius IV of Constantinople defined the monastery as Stauropegic, that is to say, free and independent of the metropolitan bishop: its only obligation was to perform funeral rites. Later on, in 1792, Patriarch Neophytos VII of Constantinople retracted the monastery's privileges; it once again came under the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan of Athens. From 1824 onwards, the monastery was \\"submitted to abject treatment. What had previously been instrumental in enlightening mankind and saving souls, was now being used as a palace for cows, fowl and horses\\". During its apogee, it had hosted many significant spiritual figures of the time, such as Theophanis in 1566 and Ioannis Doriano in 1675, the Abbot Izekel Stephanaki, who was knowledgeable in Greek literature and history, and more particularly, Platonic philosophy. From 1722 until 1728, Theophanis Kavallaris taught courses in grammar and sciences there. Kaisariani Monastery's library was renowned and most probably owned documents from antiquity's libraries. According to the demogerontes (the council of elders) of the time, \\"the manuscripts were sold to the English as membranes whereas the rest of the documents were used in the metropolis\` kitchens.\\" During the Turkish siege of the Acropolis (1826–1827), the manuscripts were transported to the Acropolis of Athens and were used to ignite fuses. The fertile surrounding lands belonged to the monastery, as did various other holdings, such as St. John the Baptist, next to the Kaisariani road or those in Anavyssos. The monks' income was substantiated by the produce from their olive groves, grape vines and beehives. In a letter, dated 1209, Michael Hionati reports that \\"the produce from the beehives was given to the Hegumen of Kaisariani Monastery. However, four years later, he complains about not having received any income from the monastery: the Abbot gave, as an excuse that the beehives had been destroyed. The monks were also renowned for concocting medicine from various herbs. The monuments Drawing of the monastery in 1745 A high wall surrounds the buildings, the catholicon (main church), the refectory, the bathhouse and the cells, so that, even today, they seem quite well protected. In its original design, there were two entrances, the main entrance on the eastern side and a larger one on the other side. The monastery was built on the ruins of a lay building. The drawing of Kaisariani Monastery, done in 1745 by a Russian pilgrim named Barski, depicts the following buildings: the catholicon on the eastern side of the wall around the abbey, the bathhouse on the south side and, bordering it, the monks' cells with the Benizelou tower and the refectory in the western wing. Beside the vegetable garden on the southwestern side of the monastery, you can see the monks' cemetery and a newer church. Kaisariani Monastery, exterior wall of church. The katholikon is of the usual Byzantine cross-in-square type, with half-hexagonal apses. The narthex and frescoes of the katholikon, however, date to Ottoman times, as do most of the other buildings of the monastery, with the exception of the olive oil press, originally a bath, which appears to be contemporary with the katholikon. The buildings are all disposed around a courtyard. The catholicon was on the eastern side, the refectory and the kitchen, on the western side and the bathhouse, which was transformed into the monastery's olive oil extractor during the Turkish rule, and, finally, the monks' cells in front of which there was an open arcade. The catholicon is dedicated to the Presentation of the Theotokos in the Temple and had the basic cross shape, faithful to Greek tradition, according to M. Sotiriou, or the semicircular quadripartite according to Anastassios Orlandos. The entrance of the temple was located on its western side without being separated by a narthex. There was another entrance on the northern side: with a marble doorstep and a Roman architrave. The narthex, which was surely built before 1602, is a vaulted ceiling with a cupola and lunette in the middle. The frescoes The oldest fresco is located on the external southern wall of the catholicon that now includes St. Anthony's chapel. It is of the Theotokos, turned to the left in prayer. Its sweeping brushstrokes suggest a 14th-century rural technique. The church and its narthex are decorated with frescoes, dating from the Ottoman period. The wealthy Benizelos family subsidized the frescoes, painted in 1682 by Ioannis Ypatos, from the Peloponnese, according to the inscription on the western wall. The cupola represents Christ Pantokrator. On the bi-partite rosette, are depicted: the Preparation of the Throne, the Virgin, John the Forerunner, the angels and a composite fresco of the Four Evangelists are represented. On the chapel's lunette, the Virgin Platytera enthroned, with angels seated on either side. Although the frescoes do not distinguish themselves with any innovations in fresco technique, they nonetheless remain prototypes of the 16th-century frescoes found in the Mount Athos. During the 17th century, frescoes became more and more popular in style and technique. Kaisariani Monastery, polychrome fresco on ceiling of church. Kaisariani Monastery, fresco on ceiling of church. Kaisariani Monastery, polychrome fresco on ceiling of church.  The bath house  Kaisariani's bath house, along with those that have been salvaged in Daphni Monastery and Dervenosalesi of Cithaeron, are examples of 11th-century architecture which confirm the belief that monks often used bath houses. Warm water was used for heating the cells, the refectory, etc. The buildings located on the left of the eastern entrance, across from the south side of the catholicon encircle a natural source. It is covered by a semi-spherical unvaulted cupola, which is supported by four pendentives. These small pendentives, which support the protective roof, have been destroyed because, as we have previously mentioned, it was transformed into an olive press. The jars, which have been preserved, testify to this transformation. The great earthquake of 1981 caused serious damage to parts of the monastery complex, particularly to the bath house and refectory. Eleven years later, the Minister of Cultural Affairs appointed the Philodasiki Enosi Athinon, a Greek NGO, to administer the restoration of the bath house under the supervision of the First Byzantine and Meta-Byzantine Archeological Service. Before the restoration could be completed, the 1999 earthquake once again interrupted the works, this time for many years. A later Minister of Cultural Affairs assigned the implementation of a new study, drafted by the Directory of Byzantine and Post-Byzantine Monuments of the Ministry of Cultural Affairs to the Philodasiki inasmuch as they would also assume complete financial responsibility for the works. The works were nonetheless resumed, to be again interrupted, indefinitely this time, for technical reasons that had nothing to do with the Philodassiki itself.  The refectory  The refectory and the kitchen are located in an independent building on the western side of the wall, across from the catholicon. The refectory is a long rectangular shaped vaulted room, which is subdivided into two spaces. The kitchen on the south side of the refectory is square shaped with a vaulted roof in which there is a chimney. The hearth is in the middle of the room, surrounded by a step, built at the foot of its four walls. The building probably dates from the 16th or 17th century. The monks' cells, along with Benizelou's tower, occupy nearly the whole southern length of the garden. In cooperation with the Archeological Service, the Philodasiki restored the complex of the Holy Monastery of Kaisariani between 1952-1955; the association supervised and funded all of the works. Tassos Margaritof restored the post- Byzantine icons it contained.

Publication history The books are a combination of origin stories (similar to the earlier Secret Origins series produced by DC), profile pages (like DC's Who's Who series from the 1980s), and short stories which sometimes serve as prologues to upcoming DC Comics storylines. Many early issues also featured timelines of significant events in the characters' histories, but this stopped after the release of Guide to the DC Universe 2000 Secret Files and Origins #1 (with the exception of the two Vertigo Secret Files and Origins issues). Some of these one-shots are released to coincide with a new series (such as the first JSA issue), or with a special event (such as the Infinite Crisis issue). Originally the books featured sequential numbering, but from 2003-2006 this was dropped in favor of putting the year of publication in the title (so for example, Aquaman Secret Files and Origins 2003 is the equivalent of Aquaman Secret Files and Origins #2); sequential numbering returned with the release of Green Lantern/Sinestro Corps: Secret Files and Origins #1 in 2007.

It functioned as a legal organ of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. Lenin had argued in the summer of 1912 that an initiative to start a legal workers’ newspaper in Moscow should have been undertaken. However, the fundraising campaign for the new publication did not start until November that year. In call titled a 'Letter from a Group of Moscow Workers' appeared in Pravda no. 176 that month. The Pravda article called for collections of fund to start the new publication. 395 workers groups made contributions to the campaign. However, the launching of the publication was stalled for some time, as the Bolshevik nucleus organizing the effort were arrested. The first issue of Nash Put appeared on September 7. The paper became widely spread amongst Moscow workers, and had a daily edition of 17-20 000. Lenin took an active part in the Nash Put. Among the articles by Lenin published in Nash Put were: *The Russian Bourgeoisie and Russian Reformism *The Role of Social Estates and Glasses in the Liberation Movement *Class War in Dublin *A Week after the Dublin Massacre *Questions of Principle in Politics *Harry Quelch Amongst the other contributors to Nash Put were Maxim Gorky, Demyan Bedny, M. S. Olminsky, I. I. Skvortsov-Stepanov, Joseph Stalin and the Bolshevik deputies to the Fourth Duma, A. Y. Badayev, F. N. Samoilov and N. R. Shagov. Nash Put was banned on September 25. In protest of the closure of the publication a strike was launched by workers groups in the city, calling for a lifting of the ban. The ban was, however, not lifted. Sources *V. I. Lenin.

He was born in Birmingham and has three older brothers; the eldest John, Dave, who was also a goalkeeper and played over 200 games for Birmingham City, and more famously the Everton and England striker, Bob Latchford who also started his career at Birmingham City. Latchford spent most of his career in Scotland with Celtic, where he was known affectionately by the fans as 'Gas Meter' (rhyming slang for Peter) and 'The Cat'.http://celticunderground.net/the-bhoy-in-the-picture-peter-latchford/ Club career Whilst his two elder brothers both began their careers at Birmingham City, Peter Latchford started his career at local rivals, West Bromwich Albion. By early 1975 Latchford had played over 80 league games, however at this time he had been dropped from the first-team and was playing with the youth side. Having expressed his frustration at lack of first-team football to manager Don Howe, a loan deal with Celtic was arranged and Latchford made his debut for The Bhoys on 22 February 1975 in a 2–1 league defeat against Hibernian at Easter Road. Latchford played 13 more league and Scottish Cup games that season for Celtic,http://www.fitbastats.com/celtic/player_games.php?playerid=2709&page;=13 culminating in his first winner's medal as Celtic defeated Airdrie 3–1 in the 1975 Scottish Cup Final. Latchford had impressed sufficiently at Celtic for the loan deal to be made permanent, and on 14 July 1975 Celtic paid a transfer fee of £25,000 to West Brom. He made over 270 appearances for Celtic in the late 1970s and early 1980s, winning 2 League Championships and 3 Scottish Cups. These successes included a league and cup double in 1976–77, the 4–2 win over Rangers in the famous '10 men win the league' game in 1979 and the infamous 1980 Cup Final riot (Celtic beat Rangers 1–0 after Extra Time) the following season. Latchford also played in several European ties for Celtic. On 22 October 1975, he starred in a 0–0 draw in the away leg of a European Cup Winners Cup tie against Boavista. He pulled off several saves to deny the Portuguese side, and capped off an outstanding performance with a penalty save from João Alves in the 85th minute. Celtic won the return leg 3–1 at Parkhead to progress to the quarter finals. Latchford's most memorable European game though was on 5 March 1980 when Celtic played Real Madrid at Parkhead in the first leg of a European Cup quarter-final tie. His saves from England striker Laurie Cunningham and Spanish star Santillana helped Celtic to a 2–0 win on the night, although Celtic lost the return leg in Spain 0–3 to go out on aggregate. Latchford sustained a hand injury in the summer of 1980 and lost his place in the team to Pat Bonner. From then on Latchford featured rarely for Celtic, but he remained loyal to the club – to the probable detriment of his career. He did, however, get a brief run of first-team action during early 1986 when Bonner was out injured.http://www.fitbastats.com/celtic/player_games.php?playerid=2709&page;=2 He finally left in Celtic in the summer of 1987 after having made 272 competitive appearances for the club. Latchford joined Clyde on a one-year deal, where after a season he finally retired. He is now a goalkeeping coach and has worked in this capacity for Forfar Athletic, Clyde, Hearts and Motherwell. For a few years he combined goalkeeping coach duties at Dumfries club Queen of the South with coaching the youth goalkeepers at Celtic. Latchford's spell at Queens included the 2007–08 season run to the final of the Scottish Cup, where they lost narrowly (3–2) to Rangers. International career Whilst at West Bromwich Albion, Latchford was capped twice for the England U23 side. He played against Poland in October 1973 (0–0) and Wales in January 1974 (0–0). Latchford was never capped at senior level.

The following is a list of doughnut varieties. Variations and specialties by region The terms below constitute either names for different doughnut types created using local recipes, or for the local language translation of the term for an imported doughnut product. * Argentina – Kreppel, also called tortas fritas (fried pastries), is a fried pastry or quick bread that was introduced by German immigrants, and is similar to the Berliner. Facturas are a popular baked doughnut found in every corner bakery. Other names that may be seen in bakeries are berlinesas and bolas de fraile (\\"friar's balls\\"). * Armenia – Ponchik, borrowed from Russian, is a deep-fried piece of dough shaped into a flattened sphere and filled with confiture or other sweet filling.

Besides traditional ring doughnuts, jam doughnuts are common in most bakeries, often sold warm. * Austria – Austrian doughnut equivalents are called Krapfen and resemble the Berliner. Especially popular during carnival season (Fasching), they are solid and usually filled with apricot jam (traditional) or vanilla cream (vanillekrapfen). They are made from sweet yeast dough fried in fat or oil, usually with a filling of marmalade, jam, chocolate, champagne, custard, mocha, or with no filling at all. They are usually topped with icing, powdered sugar, or conventional sugar. * Azores – filhós, malassadas Oliebollen from Belgium and the Netherlands * Belgium – Smoutebollen or croustillons are similar to Dutch Oliebollen but usually do not contain any fruit, except sometimes for apple chunks.

A Shanghai dessert named 高力豆沙 is a variant of this, with oilier dough (originally made with egg white) and filled with red bean paste. Another variant uses thickened, lightly sweetened black sesame paste for filling and is sprinkled with sesame seeds. Other types are tikoy, zha gao, jin doi, chien doi, and zhá miàn quān. A salty variation are deep- fried doughnut sticks that are often quite oily, hence their Mandarin name, yóutiáo (油條, literally \\"oil strips\\"); in Cantonese, this doughnut–style pastry is called yàuhjagwái (油炸鬼); it is often served with congee, a traditional rice porridge.

Life He was probably born in Scotland and came to North America some time before 1786, when he is found at Montreal. With the help of the Indian agent Colonel John Campbell of Glendaruel, he entered a partnership with an experienced fur trader, Donald Mackay. This partnership traded in opposition to the North West Company and other companies on the Saskatchewan and Assiniboine Rivers of western Canada till 1788. The next year, Shaw became a clerk for the North West Company. He established a trading post near Moose Lake, Alberta and then at Fort George and Fort Augustus on the North Saskatchewan River. He established other posts on Lac la Biche and the Slave River. Shaw was made a wintering partner, with shares in the company, in 1791 or 1792. During this time, he married a native woman. In 1796, he became a member of the Beaver Club at Montreal. In 1802, he was put in charge of the King's Posts in Lower Canada on the lower north shore of the Saint Lawrence River. Later that year, he was elected to represent Effingham in the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada in a by-election held after Charles-Jean- Baptiste Bouc's expulsion. Also in 1802, he married Marjory McGillivray, the sister of William McGillivray. In 1803, Shaw led an expedition to James Bay, which established posts on the Moose and Eastmain Rivers. In 1806, he became a partner in McTavish, McGillivrays and Company, affiliated with the North West Company, and travelled to Fort William (now Thunder Bay, Ontario) several times. Shaw was named a justice of the peace for the Indian territory in 1810. He was a major in the Corps of Canadian Voyageurs during the War of 1812. In 1815, he took part in the destruction of the Hudson's Bay Company's Red River Colony. He was arrested by the HBC in 1816 and 1819 and later sent to London, where he was released. After 1821, Shaw retired to the United States, where he married Julia Agnes Rickman; his second wife had died in 1820. He died of a lung infection at New Brunswick, New Jersey in 1832.

The term is most commonly used to describe topological spaces on which every continuous mapping has a fixed point. But another use is in order theory, where a partially ordered set P is said to have the fixed point property if every increasing function on P has a fixed point. Definition Let A be an object in the concrete category C. Then A has the fixed-point property if every morphism (i.e., every function) f: A \\\\to A has a fixed point. The most common usage is when C = Top is the category of topological spaces. Then a topological space X has the fixed-point property if every continuous map f: X \\\\to X has a fixed point. Examples =Singletons= In the category of sets, the objects with the fixed-point property are precisely the singletons. =The closed interval= The closed interval [0,1] has the fixed point property: Let f: [0,1] → [0,1] be a continuous mapping. If f(0) = 0 or f(1) = 1, then our mapping has a fixed point at 0 or 1. If not, then f(0) > 0 and f(1) − 1 < 0\\\\. Thus the function g(x) = f(x) − x is a continuous real valued function which is positive at x = 0 and negative at x = 1. By the intermediate value theorem, there is some point x0 with g(x0) = 0, which is to say that f(x0) − x0 = 0, and so x0 is a fixed point. The open interval does not have the fixed-point property. The mapping f(x) = x2 has no fixed point on the interval (0,1). =The closed disc= The closed interval is a special case of the closed disc, which in any finite dimension has the fixed-point property by the Brouwer fixed-point theorem. Topology A retract A of a space X with the fixed-point property also has the fixed-point property. This is because if r: X \\\\to A is a retraction and f: A \\\\to A is any continuous function, then the composition i \\\\circ f \\\\circ r: X \\\\to X (where i: A \\\\to X is inclusion) has a fixed point. That is, there is x \\\\in A such that f \\\\circ r(x) = x. Since x \\\\in A we have that r(x) = x and therefore f(x) = x. A topological space has the fixed-point property if and only if its identity map is universal. A product of spaces with the fixed-point property in general fails to have the fixed-point property even if one of the spaces is the closed real interval. The FPP is a topological invariant, i.e. is preserved by any homeomorphism. The FPP is also preserved by any retraction. According to Brouwer fixed point theorem every compact and convex subset of a Euclidean space has the FPP. More generally, according to the Schauder-Tychonoff fixed point theorem every compact and convex subset of a locally convex topological vector space has the FPP. Compactness alone does not imply the FPP and convexity is not even a topological property so it makes sense to ask how to topologically characterize the FPP. In 1932 Borsuk asked whether compactness together with contractibility could be a sufficient condition for the FPP to hold. The problem was open for 20 years until the conjecture was disproved by Kinoshita who found an example of a compact contractible space without the FPP.Kinoshita, S.

Webber (Hartford, Connecticut, May 6, 1920 – Berkeley, November 25, 2006)Melvin Webber was an urban designer and theorist associated for most of his career with the University of California at Berkeley but whose work was internationally important. He was a director of the university’s Transportation Center, an author of classic theoretical papers and of major consulting reports, and an active contributor to debates on transportation policy, regional development and planning theory. His most important work was in the 1960s & 1970s when he pioneered thinking about cities of the future, adapted for the age of telecommunications and mass automotive mobility. These would not be concentric clusters as in the past but urban-associational areas. Webber's 1964 paper Urban Place and the Non-Place Urban RealmThe Urban Place and the Non-Place Urban Realm in 'Explorations into Urban Structure' ed Webber et al., Pennsylvania, 1964 set the terms for much of his later work and introduced the idea of 'community without propinquity': cities that were clusters of settlements with the urban realm of its occupants being determined by social links and economic networks in a 'Non-Place Urban Realm'. His 1974 article Permissive PlanningPermissive Planning, reprinted in 'The Future of Cities', London 1974 Hutchinson Educational developed the idea that urbanists should be enablers not designers or controllers, using an engineering approach to solving urban planning issues. In that paper he criticised urban designers for internalising 'the concepts and methods of design from civil engineering and architecture'. Webber was also well known for his collaboration with Berkeley colleague, Horst Rittel in their seminal paper in 1973 on wicked problems, ones that defied ready solution by the straightforward application of scientific rationality. He was later involved in the development of public transport, apparently regretting the car-focussed implications of his early work, though his theories are as applicable to transport planning as a car based approach to urbanism. One of the most developed examples of his ideas is the design for Milton Keynes, a new city in England, built on a devolved and radical grid plan from 1967, where the Chief Architect (Derek Walker) described Webber as \\"the father of the city\\".The Architecture and Planning of Milton Keynes, Walker, D, The Architectural Press, London, 1982 Publications * Rittel, H.W.J. & M.M.

She was also known as an animal trainer, providing numerous animals for various BBC productions and the 1967 movie Doctor Dolittle.Mary Chipperfield, Lions on the Lawn (1971) Heritage She was born in a circus caravan in Kentish Town, London. Her father was Jimmy Chipperfield and his wife Rose (née Purchase; 1912–2006). The Purchase family had a long history of travelling menageries, and Rose had a lion act herself. The two shows amalgamated about two years after the couple married (around 1930). Chipperfield's Circus was managed by Jimmy's father at the time and control later passed to his older brother. Early career In 1955 her father broke away from the family circus and, after a brief spell at farming and managing other shows, he and Mary began providing animals for film work. Southampton Zoo In 1961 Jimmy founded Southampton Zoological Gardens on Southampton Common and Mary used this as a base for taming a variety of wild animals for roles in films and Chipperfield's Circus.Helen Kitley.

Mary wrote about its creation and first year of public operation in Lions on the Lawn (1971).Mary Chipperfield. Lions on the Lawn. London: Fontana, 1971. Christmas shows in the 1970s Just as the BBC showed Billy Smart's Circus shows on Christmas Day for several years during the 1970s, ITV would show Chipperfield's Circus in competition. This brought Mary even more into the public eye and she was featured in magazine articles and features such as a photospread in Princess Tina Annual 1971.'A swimming lesson for Suki'. Princess Tina Annual 1971. London: IPC Magazines, 1970. Conviction for animal cruelty In 1999, Mary Chipperfield was accused of cruel treatment of some animals in her circus. In April 1998 a infant chimpanzee named Trudy had been seized by police and taken to the 'Monkey World' sanctuary after being repeatedly kicked, beaten and made to sleep in a tiny box. Chipperfield was found guilty of twelve counts of cruelty to animals and fined £8,500.

History =Formation= Mimi Secue started to make music in the spring of 1999. The crystallisation point of the early musical work was the Cselley Mill, a long time point of culture and music in the east of Austria. Mimi Secue see themselves as a classically rock-orchestrated band with guitars, bass guitar, drums and voice, extended by strings, vibraphone, glockenspiel and metallophone bound to the slowed-down guitar music. =Debut album= In September 1999 the debut album Amazonas was developed and published by the label P.A.M. Records / Edel, which does not exist any more. The album contained seven calm and rather introverted and reserved songs, which defined the band's future musical adjustments and aesthetic. =Second album= In August 2001 the band returned to the Cselley Mill to record ten songs for the second self-titled LP. This second studio- album was published on the new independent label Karate Joe with the catalogue number KJ001 in April 2002. The track \\"Sunchild\\" instantly became the audio signature of the radioshow \\"Im Sumpf\\" on Austria's Public Radio Station FM4 (ORF) in 2002. During the recordings of s/t and the following concerts, some guest musicians were associated to the band. Together with the groups of artists WR, MFU and David Kleinl, the band created a visual concept for their live-appearances. Videos, which accompany with the music figuratively, should underline the different possibilities of association of Mimi Secue's music. =Third album= In February 2003 Mimi Secue retired themselves to the west Hungarian outback to record their third album Forst in self-direction, which was on Karate Joe again. It took the band 12 months to record the material for seven new songs, so that it was possible to start the post-production in February 2004. Martin Siewert (Trapist/ Thrill Jockey-artist) did the mix and master of the new songs to give them the last cut. A self-contained album was the final result. As Mimi Secue did the mix and master of the Forst album, they also started to work on some new songs. At the end of this process they went back again to Hungary once, were they recorded these new songs in the summer of 2005. At the end of the year the new album was ready for the mix down. Once again Martin Siewert did the post-production. He also played all lap steel and pedal steel guitars for the new album called Naila. Since then the band has played several live-performances at festivals, like moving patterns (New York City), Konfrontationen Nickelsdorf, ModernistMozart (Vienna).
