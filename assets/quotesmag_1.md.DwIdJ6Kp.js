He was born in Spain, perhaps of Italian origin.Cicero, Philippica 11.12; 13.27; the Italian origin is a suggestion of Ronald Syme (see references). In 49 BC he fought as a supporter of Julius Caesar in Spain against an army allied with Pompey.Julius Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Gallico 1.66.3 In 44 BC he was tribune of the people and after the assassination of Caesar he was allied to Mark Antony. At the beginning of 43 BC Antony was besieged in Mutina and was supported by Decidius Saxa.Cicero, Philippica 11.12; 13.27.

He was heavily defeated near Antioch, when Quintus Labienus led a Parthian intervention in Syria in 40 BC. He fled to Cilicia where he was captured and executed by the Parthians.Cassius Dio, Roman History 48.25; Marcus Velleius Paterculus, Roman History 2.78.1 His legions reportedly suffered heavy defeats and several of his aquilae were seized, being returned to Rome first after a brief Roman war against Parthia and negotiations by then Roman emperor Augustus in 20 BC. The eagle standards were returned together with those captured in 53 BC from Marcus Licinius Crassus, a great propaganda victory for Rome. A brother of Decidius Saxa was his Quaestor in Syria in 40 BC and fought with him against the Parthians, but his soldiers deserted to the enemy so that he had to surrender to Quintus Labienus.Cassius Dio, Roman History 48.25.2  Notes  1st-century BC Roman governors of Syria Ancient Roman generals 1st-century BC Romans Year of birth unknown 40 BC deaths People of the Roman–Parthian Wars Prisoners and detainees of the Parthian Empire ","title":"Lucius Decidius Saxa"},{"id":"19700142","text":"Marie Weibull Kornias (born 1954) is a Swedish Moderate Party politician.

A Classical Revival building built in 1926, it is the only unaltered pre-World War II theater left in the city, and one of only three from that era in the Hudson Valley. It is also the largest proscenium theater between Manhattan and Albany. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, two years after it was closed due to declining business. It remained vacant until an extensive renovation effort late in the 20th century allowed it to reopen in 2002. Today it is operated by the Bardavon Theater in nearby Poughkeepsie. While it served primarily as a movie palace in its earlier incarnation, today it primarily hosts musical performances. The Hudson Valley Philharmonic calls it home due to its superior acoustics, and many popular recording artists have made UPAC a stop on their concert tours. Building The theater is on a half-acre (2,000 m²) lot on the south side of Broadway in the center of the city, midway between its uptown and downtown sections. Broadway is mainly commercial; the neighborhoods behind the theater are residential. =Exterior= At the street, its northeast (main) facade is two stories high by 11 bays wide. The rear, theater portion rises three to four stories, dominating the block. The entire building is made of brick, with a granite-capped parapet with Aztec designs along the front roofline. Plain granite pilasters mark the corners. The portico features four Corinthian columns and a classical entablature. Other decoration includes projecting stone belt-courses, granite rectangles between the windows, vertical stretchers above windows and granite aprons below. =Interior= The interior is built around the auditorium. It is semicircular, with an orchestra pit below the stage. The main seats and balcony provide 1,500 seats. The stage itself is wide and deep. The proscenium arch, rising to above the stage floor, is decorated with alternating octagons, foliated candelabras and other foliate motifs. On either side it has fluted Corinthian pilasters and engaged columns with Adamesque carvings in the surrounding walls. It is topped by a highly detailed entablature, its cornice decorated with lions' heads, anthemion leaves, dentils and egg-and-dart molding. The frieze features steer skulls, candelabras, shields and swag. Similar decoration continues on the shallow ceiling dome. It is coffered, with plain and decorated grillwork and solid recessed panels with dentils, anthemion leaves and other foliate molding. Rosettes mark the interstices. Around the central recess is a wide band with urns, rosettes and cartouches bordered by rinceau and foliate triangles. The rim has lions' heads and anthemion. The plaster walls are less decorated, using only simple rectangles. The inner lobby has decoration incorporating both the same themes as the auditorium and the Aztec motifs outside. The second-floor lounge continues this mix, with a fireplace surrounded by carved stone. Other areas, such as the outer lobby, restrooms, and dressing rooms, are plain. History The theater's history begins in 1925, when a Kingston couple and an Albany man incorporated with $5,300 ($ in contemporary dollars). The next year they acquired the land and began selling bonds to raise more money. They hired prominent New York City architect Douglas P. Hall. That October, construction began with Sinner and Cook, also of New York, as general contractor. Construction continued through the winter. The largest derrick in the state at that time was used to put the steel framing in place for the auditorium and proscenium arch. Upon its grand opening in June 1927 as the Broadway Theatre the Daily Freeman called it \\"one of the finest theatres in the Hudson River Valley\\". The program shown to the capacity crowd of 1,703 included five vaudeville acts and Howard Hawks' comedy The Cradle Snatchers. The ushers wore Spanish costumes to complement the decor. A schedule of three daily performances began the next day. By 1947 it had changed owners three times. The Walter Reade organization bought it that year and renamed it the Community Theatre. Six years later, in 1953, the front portico was added. Inside, the original floor seats were replaced and a party box added, reducing the capacity to 1,560. The theater continued to be a major part of the city's cultural life. Bette Davis and Lillian Gish were among the actors who performed on stage. Musical greats included Isaac Stern and Victor Borge, who praised the theater's acoustics. Kingston's downtown began to decline with growing suburbanization in the 1970s. In 1977 the Reade organization closed the theater, citing competition for moviegoers from suburban shopping malls with multiple screens. To avert the building's possible demolition, a nonprofit organization, the Ulster Performing Arts Center, was formed and bought the theater. In 1995, the nonprofit raised the money for a $1.7 million renovation, completed in time for the building's 75th anniversary in 2002. The Bardavon began managing UPAC in 2006 and the two organizations merged the following year.

The Act was patterned after the Securities Act of 1933 and required land developers to register subdivisions of (currently 100 or more) non-exempt lots or condominium units. Originally, the filings were to be with the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. Currently, the responsibility for administering the Act 15 U.S.C. 1701 et seq. and its regulations 12 CFR Parts 1010, 1011, and 1012 is with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). A regulated developer is to provide each purchaser with a disclosure document called a Property Report. The Property Report contains relevant information about the subdivision and must be delivered to each purchaser before the signing of the contract or agreement and gives the purchaser at a minimum a 7-day period to cancel the purchase agreement. In 2014, the Act was amended to additionally apply to condominiums.Act to amend the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act to clarify how the Act applies to condominiums, . When the financial crisis of 2008 severely limited the ability for purchasers of newly constructed units to purchase homes they could no longer afford, these contract vendees found attorneys wielding this statute as a weapon to rescind contract for buildings with more than 100 units. Real estate attorney Adam Leitman Bailey pioneered the use of the ILSA provision to get buyers out of contracts by either causing developers to discount prices allowing purchasers to close or if purchasers could not longer afford the home they would be able to terminate the contract.https://therealdeal.com/2014/09/19/senate-votes-to-strike-down-ilsa- requirements-for-condos/ Builders argued that the statute was not meant for sophisticated wealthy buyers and the purchaser's attorneys apologetically, used it to successfully get clients out of contracts and to obtain a refund of the down payment. In other cases using the statute the attorneys for the purchasers received large discounts off the purchase price. On September 19, 2014, a bill unanimously passed the House of Representatives and United States Senate repealing the law for condominiums. On October 6, 2014, President Barack Obama signed the bill into law. References External linksArticle about ILSA by Carmel & Carmel Law Firm *Article about ILSA by Miami lawyer Jared H.

Cobb was a three-masted schooner named after the shipbuilder and founder of Cobb's Salvaging Company whose many rescues of stranded ships help lead to the formation of the United States Life-Saving Service. Despite its namesake's history of shipwreck rescues, the Nathan F. Cobb capsized in heavy seas on 1 December 1896 en route from Brunswick, Georgia to New York with a cargo of timber and cross ties. The cook and a shipmate drowned when they were swept overboard in violent seas. The crew righted the vessel by removing the three masts and they drifted for four days until they became grounded on a sandbar off Ormond Beach, Florida. Rescue attempts led to the drowning of volunteer Fred Waterhouse, whose body was never recovered, but no other crew members were lost. A plaque commemorates Fred Waterhouse's rescue efforts. The Cobb Cottage, a structure built using materials salvaged from the ship, is part of Ormond Beach's Historic Trail. History Nathan F. Cobb of Rockland, Maine was a three-masted, square rigged schooner constructed in 1890. Information related to many ships built in Rockland between the years of 1837 and 1920 is generally sparse. In his six volume set titled Merchant Sail, William Armstrong Fairburn describes the landscape regarding construction and registration information for ships built in Rockland during the aforementioned era: Fairburn cites Customhouse Records with recording information about 275 vessels registered as built in Rockland between 1837 and 1920. Among the vessels listed is the Nathan F. Cobb, which ranged in length, weighed 656 tons, drafted of water and had a beam width of . Final voyage The origin and endpoint of Nathan F. Cobb's final voyage On its last voyage the Cobb was scheduled to transport a cargo of timber and cross ties from Brunswick, Georgia to New York. On Tuesday, 1 December 1896, after leaving port from Brunswick, the schooner fell victim to the strong winds and high seas associated with Nor'easters. Gale force winds ripped the vessel's sails from their masts and rough seas capsized the ship to its beam ends. The crew was able to right the distressed vessel by removing the main and mizzen masts, but this left the Cobb vulnerable since it was powerless and waterlogged. Despite the cabin being swept away by the sea, the ship's hull was kept relatively intact during this sequence of events.Annual Report of the Operations of the United States Life-Saving Services for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1897. Washington: Government Printing Office 1898. Unfortunately, both a cook and a shipmate drowned in the violent seas. On the morning of 5 December 1896 the Nathan F. Cobb ran aground on a near shore sandbar roughly 1000 feet off the coast of Ormond Beach, Florida.Price, J.D.. \\"Copy of letter from J.D. Price to John Anderson.\\" 6 December 1896. Rescue efforts J.D. Price and John Anderson built the Ormond Hotel in 1888 and sold it to Henry Flagler in 1891. While Flagler took over ownership responsibilities, he retained Price as the hotel's manager. On the morning of 5 December 1896, then Ormond Hotel manager J.D. Price, noticed the stranded vessel in the surf and gathered a group of people to assist in the rescue efforts.\\"Services - Division of Historical Resources\\" Great Floridians of Ormond Beach Accessed 23 Feb 2009 After learning of the disaster, Superintendent Hiram B. Shaw of the United States Life-Saving Service's Seventh Life-Saving District, hastened to the scene to assess the situation. Shaw quickly telegraphed for permission to have a life saving beach apparatus sent to him by train from Jupiter, Florida where the Jupiter Inlet Life Saving Station was located, approximately 180 miles south of Ormond Beach. This was quickly granted by General Superintendent Sumner Increase Kimball. Because of the proximity and travel time from the Jupiter Inlet Station to Ormond Beach, Shaw had his small surf boat wheeled down to the beach on a man-drawn wagon. He then went into town to procure necessary equipment and rope lines for the rescue. In total, about fifty people came together on the beach. Due to the tumultuous conditions, it was decided that no rescue attempts would be made until low tide at 11:00 a.m. The first rescue boat set out at nearly low tide. With a rope attached to its stern from shore, hotel painter Edward DeCourcy and another hotel staff member manned Shaw's small rowboat. Although they successfully made it beyond the breakers, the rowboat succumbed to the strong southerly current; missing the float line thrown from the schooner by five feet. They were forced to come in. Five more unsuccessful attempts were made to reach the grounded vessel. Next, a small metallic dingy, known as an iron yawl, was carried down to the beach. Tom Fagen and Fred Waterhouse manned the yawl, in another attempt to reach the grounded schooner. Through skilled seamanship, they made it to the second set of breakers, only a short distance from the vessel. When they tried to reach the float line, a large wave struck them leaving their boat filled with water. The two men abandoned their yawl. Fagen managed to swim ashore and was met by volunteers close to the beach half-drowned. Waterhouse decided against swimming to shore. When he saw that the yawl had flipped, he swam back to it and straddled the hull. The men on the shore began pulling the flipped boat in, but another wave broke on top of it throwing Waterhouse into the water and righting the yawl. Waterhouse climbed back into the boat and began getting pulled in again, only to be capsized shortly thereafter. This time Waterhouse surfaced, appearing dazed and grasping onto an oar. Shaw's rescue boat was put back in the water, but Waterhouse had already gone under and presumably drowned to death a short time later. Fred Waterhouse's body was never recovered, despite several searches. Hiram B. Shaw had just returned to the beach when this casualty occurred. After supplying his small rescue boat with more rope lines, he and Edward DeCourcy removed their outer clothing and prepared to embark. The men on the Cobb, who had just witnessed Waterhouse's drowning, prompted the captain of the schooner to give an impassioned address in which he said, \\"They have sacrificed one man in their efforts to save us; now I'll risk my life in an attempt to get ashore.\\" The captain tied a rope around his waist and jumped into the water, just as the rescue boat had set out from shore. After battling against the current and waves, he was met by Shaw's rescue boat and clung to its stern until they reached land. Making use of the captain's line, the men on shore tied a life preserver to it. One at a time, the five stranded crewmen pulled the flotation device out to the schooner, fastened it to their bodies and were pulled to safety by the people on the shore. After receiving a cup of hot coffee, a drink of whiskey and a blanket, the Cobb's crew were taken to Coquina, Ormond Beach's area hospital. Upon hearing the story, General Superintendent Sumner Increase Kimball of the United States Life-Saving Service wrote a letter of praise to Edward DeCourcy for his selflessness and bravery; also acknowledging the many others involved.

After the plaque was reattached to the boulder, it was relocated to the Fire station north of the Casa Del Mar on A1A, where it currently sits. Newspaper coverage Despite limited information about its service routes and construction, the Nathan F. Cobb was the subject of two separate New York Times articles during its short career. One article reported the wreck the day after it occurred, the other article came from 20 June 1892 and chronicled a disturbance between mates. The Cobb was still in tow only three miles outside Mobile Bay, beginning its route from Mobile, Alabama to New York, when mate Henry Shaffer jumped over board to avoid a beating. Another mate, J. Trott had already used a belaying pin to half kill another seaman on the schooner and Shaffer was fearful for his life. Shaffer began swimming towards a nearby light house and was picked up nearly five miles from where he jumped over board. The captain of the towboat reported that Captain Cookson of the Cobb, mentioned incidentally they had lost a crewman. Both Cookson and Trott already had pending charges against them for cruelty and marooning of sailors, stemming from an incident in May 1891 at Calcasieu Pass, Louisiana.\\"Jumped Overboard to Avoid a Beating\\" New York Times. 20 June 1892. Accessed 15 February 2009 Forerunner of the United States Life-Saving Service Nathan F. Cobb was named after a ship builder, born in 1797 from Eastham, Massachusetts on Cape Cod. Cobb and his family moved from Eastham to Northampton County, Virginia before purchasing Sand Shoal Island, which later became Cobb Island. It was on Cobb Island, in 1839, that Nathan founded Cobb's Salvaging Company with his sons. They specialized in wrecking and salvaging stranded vessels along the shallow Mid-Atlantic coastline. The Cobbs had a remarkable record; not one person drowned in any of the rescue efforts for the 37 or more ships stranded off their island. The success of the salvaging company earned them the sobriquet \\"Rothschilds among the toilers of the sea\\".Shomette, Donald G.

Accessed 16 October 2008 Despite the company's notable prosperity, the Cobbs were often praised for their humanity and general regard for human life, \\"Often a crew of ten or twenty would be landed on the island from stranded vessels without a penny, and they were tenderly cared for as though they were millionaires.\\" This practice was a rare creed among wreckers in the 19th century. The Cobbs and others like them transformed the act of salvaging which led way to the forming of the United States Life-Saving Service; this later merged into what is now the United States Coast Guard.\\"Cobb's Island Story.\\" The Countryside Transformed: The Railroad and the Eastern Shore of Virginia, 1870-1935. 2008.

It is the only species in the genus Bertella, in the family Oneirodidae, and can be distinguished from other members of the family by the structure of its hyomandibular bone. Distribution and habitat Specimens of B. idiomorpha have only been collected in the northern Pacific Ocean, including off Japan, in the Bering Sea, and in the Gulf of California. The depths ranged from 580 m to 3475 m. Description Like other oneirodids, B. idiomorpha is a small, globular-bodied fish with a large head and jaws, and a bioluminescent lure (esca) on a stalk (illicium) attached to the head. The skin is scaleless and covers the base of the caudal fin. There are numerous small, rounded, darkly pigmented papillae on the head, body, and tail, associated with the lateral line system. The fish is dark brown to black in color, except for the clear tips of the papillae and the end of the esca. The jaws are filled with slender, straight teeth. The females measure up to 8.4 cm in length. Only one male is known, an 11-mm specimen attached to a 77-mm female. B. idiomorpha is unique amongst the oneirodids in having a hyomandibular bone (the bone that attaches the lower jaw to the cranium) with a single head. In its family, B. idiomorpha most resembles the genus Dolopichthys, differing in having a wider and deeper skull, shorter and fewer jaw teeth, and in details of the mandibular spines and the esca. Biology and ecology In contrast to the closely related Dolopichthys, which feeds on fish and squid, B. idiomorpha feeds on amphipods, krill, and small decapods. This difference in prey items is reflected in the body shape of B. idiomorpha, which is shorter and deeper, suggesting that it is a more sluggish swimmer than Dolopichthys. B. idiomorpha also has smaller and fewer teeth, and its single-headed hyomandibular bone reduces the strength of its bite, again consistent with preying on smaller, slower prey items. B. idiomorpha and Leptacanthichthys gracilispinis are the only oneirodids known to have parasitic males. Both the tips of the upper and lower jaws of the male B. idiomorpha become fused to the female. Small openings to the mouth and opercular cavities of the male are maintained on both sides. Mature female B. idiomorpha contain around 7500 eggs per ovary, and have some of the largest eggs amongst the deep-sea anglerfish.

It was released on January 26, 2009. Gameplay Batter-pitcher interface. MLB Front Office Manager allows a player to take the role of a baseball general manager over the course of a thirty-year career; the goal is to perform well enough to become inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. The player's GM is rated on eight disciplines including North American scouting, international scouting, pro-league scouting, player development, trades, contract negotiation, owner confidence and leadership. GMs also have former career backgrounds (e.g. ex-manager, lawyer, business person, former player, or talent scout) that affect the GM's disciplines. A GM's ratings improve or regress over his career depending on their performance. A GM will also have seasonal goals depending on the club they're hired by. The player will be faced with decisions such as spring training evaluation, initiate and respond to trades, develop rookies, and even bid for Japanese baseball players. The game also promises advanced AI- controlled GMs who have unique motivations. During the game, the player may opt to manage, and can issue instructions such as intentionally walk batters, make a bullpen changes, call for steals and bunts, and pitch; the user cannot call individual pitches. The game features a full 3D engine for single game gameplay. Full nine inning games take roughly 10–15 minutes to play. =Statistical depth= The game features a full 3D engine for play resolution. The game utilizes official SABR stats compiled over the player's career, even factoring such situational stats as batter vs. pitcher historical stats, pitcher's performance at specific pitch counts, and success with runners in scoring position, in addition to the usual situational stats. These stats extend to actual minor league players from Class AAA to A-Short Season minor league systems; due to MLBPA agreements, the players are not identified by name. Players also have personality ratings as well. =Multiplayer= The game features Online Fantasy Mode, which allows up to thirty managers in an online league to compete against one other to develop the best team. Gamers can use modified rules, enter a fantasy draft, and optionally utilize fantasy baseball scoring systems like rotisserie, head-to-head or traditional scoring. Development Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane served as expert consultant on the GM experience and environment. Beane also appears in-game as an advisor to the player. New York Yankees general manager Brian Cashman was also involved in the project.

Russian sources (e.g. Massa, 1997 p. 467) state it as 1635 was a Dutch grain trader, traveller and diplomat, the envoy to Muscovy. He wrote memoirs related to the Time of Troubles and created some of the earliest maps of Eastern Europe and Siberia. Due to Massa's experience in and knowledge of Muscovy, he was valued by the Dutch States- General as a counterweight to growing English influence in Muscovy in the early seventeenth century.Death of the first false Dmitrii The Isaac Massa Foundation was established in his honor in Groningen. It aims to stimulate scientific and cultural contacts between the Russian Federation and the Netherlands. Biography Isaac Massa was born into a wealthy silk merchant's family; his father Abraham Massa had relocated the family from Liège to Haarlem before Isaac was born. His ancestors could have been French Huguenots who fled their homeland in the beginning of the Reformation.Massa, 1997 p. 466 The family surname was also known as Massart, Massaert, suggesting French origins, which is where most Huguenots started. Under religious persecution, they generally relocated to Protestant countries, such as England and those of northern Europe. In 1601 Massa left Haarlem for Moscow to assist the family trade.Russian sources (Massa, 1997 p. 467) state that he was sent by his father, but Keuning suggests that Abraham Massa may have died as early as 1598. Massa was witness to the second half of Boris Godunov's reign, during which a civil war broke out, now known as the Time of Troubles. He survived the capture of Moscow by False Dmitriy I and left Russia in 1609, before the fall of Tsar Vasily Shuysky. Massa compiled an account of the 1601–1609 events (), which he presented to Stadtholder Maurice. It was reproduced in print in the nineteenth century. In 1612–1613 Massa published two articles on Russian events and the geography of the Land of Samoyeds,Fragments reprinted in Schilder, p. 500 accompanied by a map of Russia, which were published in an almanac edited by Hessel Gerritsz. His notes on his various travels have been published in conjunction with maps made by the explorer Henry Hudson.Asher, G.M. (2001) Henry Hudson the Navigator, p. 269 These articles were translated and reproduced anonymously in European languages, because the author's name was removed in early Dutch reissues. The most complete translations were published in Russian in 1937 (reissued in 1997) and in English in 1982. Massa's writing was based on an underlying religious concept of punishment for sins being indispensable. He believed that Godunov, False Dimitri, and the nation itself paid for their mortal sins. (Massa believed that Godunov killed Feodor I and the real Tsarevich Dimitri). Russian sources consider him the least biased of contemporary Western witnesses, and very well informed. (His contemporary, Jacob De la Gardie, characterized Massa as \\"extremely artful in learning other people's secrets\\").Massa, 1997 p. 468 Massa is credited with five published maps of Russia and its provinces, the last ones compiled around 1633, and two maps of Moscow city, including the schematic account of the 1606 battle between Vasily Shuysky and Ivan Bolotnikov's armies.Massa, 1997 p. 467 Retrieving original maps of the city could have been dangerous for Massa himself and fatal for his Russian sources.Woodward, p. 67 Massa's rendition of the Siberian coast represented an advance in geography; for decades it was the only map of this region. It was subsequently copied by Gerardus Mercator and Jodocus Hondius, Jan Janssonius and Willem Blaeu.Schilder, p. 501 Samoyedic and Tunguz; with the Taz Estuary, Vaygach Island, Yamal and Gydan Peninsula In 1614 Massa returned to Moscow, this time accompanied by his brothers, as an envoy of States-General of the Netherlands to obtain an exclusive trade agreement similar to the recent Dutch-Ottoman treaty, and to investigate the trade routes into Persia. Not only had the Dutch been keen to purchase grains but also Persian silks. These had, equally so, been exported via Archangelsk. At the time Russian people showed great interest in artillery compounds such as lead and gunpowder. An average of thirty ships sailed each year to Archangelsk, a harbour near the White Sea – unfortunately during 1619 a fire broke out and destroyed the city completely, thereby ruining Massa's inventory. Additionally, upon his return Massa's ship encountered a heavy storm near Lapland.Wijnroks, E. (2000) Handel tussen Rusland en de Nederlanden, 1560–1640: een netwerkanalyse van de Antwerpse en Amsterdamse kooplieden, handelend op Rusland, p. 236. In April 1622 he married Beatrix van der Laen, the daughter of a Remonstrant burgomaster. When Hals had a child baptized, Massa was a witness. In 1623/24 Massa was called upon by the Dutch Parliament (Staten-Generaal) to become an agent for Moscovia. However, his appointment proved to be a controversial one and drew serious opposition. He then made successful efforts to gain the interest of Gustaf II Adolf of Sweden to pursue trading grains with Russia.Klein, P.W. (1974) De Trippen in de 17e eeuw, p. 159. While nourishing the relationships between Russia and Sweden, he was knighted by the Swedish King in 1625 for his arduous efforts. One year later, in 1626, he attempted to gain exclusive rights on the trading of grains out of Russia. Massa promoted the idea of setting up a trading cartel similar to the English Muscovy Company, but internal problems in the Netherlands delayed consolidation of traders into 1628.Engels, pp. 161, 165 During his next voyage, in 1629, he travelled to Moscow to pave the way for his friend Elias Trip who by then had initiated a consortium. Massa indiscreetly advised Michael I of Russia and Michael's father, Filaret (the Patriarch of Moscow) of the internal affairs of the Dutch Republic. By doing so he attempted to tarnish the reputation of his competitors and personal opponents.Raptschinsky, B. (1937) Uit de geschiedenis van den Amsterdamschen handel op Rusland in de XVIIe eeuw. Georg Everhard Kleinck. In: Jaarboek , p. 78. Portrait of Isaac Massa and his wife, Beatrix van der Laen by Frans Hals. Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. Because of the ongoing war between Sweden and Poland no grain could be exported through the city of Dantzig.Dillen, J.G. van (1970) Van Rijkdom en Regenten, p. 65. One of his opponents, Klenck, himself a wealthy merchant trading in caviar, was given Russia's permission to export ten or twelve cargo loads of rye meal. Meanwhile Trip feigned to act on behalf of the Swedish Monarchy.Klein, P.W. (1974) De Trippen in de 17e eeuw, p. 160. In 1630 the price of grain remained extremely high due to increasing competition. Albert Burgh tried to ensure a monopoly for the City of Amsterdam. At the same time, countries such as Sweden and England endeavoured to do the same. Russian merchants tried to curtail trading by limiting import and export exclusively via Archangelsk. For the next two decades Massa combined diplomatic service with his own business.

He would call Patrick at all hours of the night asking if we sounded okay. I had long talks with the techs. I begged someone to give me anything tangible that I could work on or fix.

The route is unsigned, like most of Onondaga County's routes, serving as a connector between the villages. The route begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 20 (US 20) in Skaneateles and heads northeast for most of its length. Route 41 does not intersect with another state-maintained highway, but does follow the former alignment of two. The highway ends at an intersection with CR 83 (South Street) and CR 150 (Platt Road). Route 41 was once part of a realignment of a 19th-century turnpike, the Seneca Turnpike. Being a newer alignment, the signs along the highway read \\"New Seneca Turnpike\\". The route, when the 1930 New York State Route renumbering occurred, was designated as part of New York State Route 175 (NY 175) from US 20 to NY 174, which is now part of CR 41\\\\. The highway then followed an older alignment of Route 174 southward, out of Marcellus. Route 175 was decommissioned and realigned several times along that alignment, and the Route 174 alignment came in the 1970s. By 1989, Route 41 was assigned along its entire alignment.  Route description  CR 41 begins at an intersection with US 20 (East Genesee Street) in the village of Skaneateles. Route 41 heads to the northeast through the densely populated community, passing homes and trees. The highway then intersects with the northern terminus of East Lake Street, the continuation of NY 41\\\\. The county route, however, continues to the northeast, leaving the village portion of Skaneateles at an intersection with Highland Avenue, losing its Onondaga Street moniker. The highway, now known as the New Seneca Turnpike, parallels US 20 in a less dense area of Skaneateles. The highway continues, leaving Skaneateles for the town of Marcellus. After a while, the dense housing becomes farmland and fields, with the highway continuing towards downtown Marcellus. However, as the route progresses farther, this reverts itself, and houses follow along the highway once again. Route 41 then intersects with Gully Road and the Old Seneca Turnpike, a realignment of itself. The real \\"Old Seneca Turnpike\\" is intersected farther north. After passing a large farm, Route 41 intersects with the northern terminus of CR 259A (Richard Road). Route 41 passes to the south of a pond, making a swing to the north. The route then makes a swing to the east, and soon after a straight path to the northeast. The highway intersects with CR 211A (Lawrence Road), which heads eastward towards NY 174\\\\. After the county route, the population around Route 41 quickly dips, and fields surround the highway. A local road, CR 202 (Murphy Road), starts to the west after a short distance. The northeast curving begins to straighten into a northward track, until intersecting with the southern terminus of CR 236 (Gypsy Road). A short distance after, Route 41 intersects with CR 133, the old alignment of the Seneca Turnpike, and the two highways merge. The county highway then follows the Old Seneca Turnpike along East Main Street, entering the village of Marcellus. Route 41 then makes a turn to the south along an old alignment of NY 174. The population becomes dense once again, as Route 41 follows South Street towards its eastern terminus. Paralleling Marcellus County Park, the highway continues southward. Route 41 finally terminates at an intersection with CR 83 (South Street) and CR 150 (Platt Road). South Street continues towards an intersection with NY 174 and NY 175.  History  = Old roads = Route 41 from US 20 to South Street, is a realignment of the Seneca Turnpike, which was assigned in 1800. Originally chartered as Genesee Road, the Seneca Turnpike consisted of a highway from Canandaigua to Utica. The turnpike had a long track in Onondaga County, running along CR 133, NY 174, NY 175, NY 173, and NY 92\\\\. The turnpike was realigned in 1806 onto CR 41 instead of CR 133\\\\. After CR 41, it continued along the same track. The Seneca Turnpike Corporation, which maintained the turnpike, closed its doors in 1852. As of 2008, County Routes 41 and 133 still retain the Seneca Turnpike moniker. = Designation = In 1930, during a massive State Route renumbering, the Skaneateles – South Street alignment of CR 41 was assigned as NY 175\\\\. The rest was portioned as an alignment of NY 174. The NY 174 alignment remained intact for many years, while NY 175 went through several different alignments. NY 175 was truncated off the CR 41 alignment by 1936, until being realigned back onto the highway in the 1960s. However, this time, the highway was maintained by the Onondaga County Department of Transportation. NY 175 was realigned by 1989 onto CR 73 (the Lee Mulroy Highway) south of CR 41. The alignment of CR 41 in Marcellus was established as a county highway in the 1970s and 1980s, when NY 174 was realigned onto a different highway.

He is Distinguished Professor of History at Baruch College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and is widely regarded as one of the leading historians of modern Iran. Early life Ervand Vahan Abrahamian was born in 1940 in Tehran, Iran to Armenian parents. He attended three grades at the Mehr School in Tehran and was later sent off to a boarding school in England. He received his BA from Oxford University in 1963. He mainly studied European history with Keith Thomas. He then moved to New York City, where he studied at Columbia University and received his first MA in 1966. He received a second MA from Oxford in 1968. Abrahamian obtained a PhD from Columbia in 1969. His thesis was titled \\"Social Bases of Iranian Politics: The Tudeh Party, 1941-53.\\" Abrahamian has stated that his \\"understanding of Iran [was] ... most shaped [by] the oil crisis of 1951-53 culminating in the coup.\\" Abrahamian was an activist and a member of the Confederation of Iranian Students — National Union (CISNU) that opposed the rule of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in the 1960s and 1970s. As of 1976, he was one of the vice chairpersons of the Committee for Artistic and Intellectual Freedom in Iran (CAIFI), a \\"minor front\\" of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP). Abrahamian is a naturalized American citizen. He is known to his friends as \\"Jed\\". In 1967 Abrahamian was engaged to Helen Mary Harbison, the daughter of late historian E. Harris Harbison. Career Abrahamian has formerly taught at Princeton University, New York University and Oxford University. However, he has spent most of his career at the City University of New York (CUNY). He is currently Distinguished Professor of History at Baruch College and the Graduate Center of CUNY. His research interests include the history and politics of the Middle East, primarily Iran. He regularly comments on Iran's politics and economy, foreign relations of Iran, including Iran–United States relations. Abrahamian is considered an authority on Iranian opposition movements, including the People's Mujahedin of Iran (MEK). He has appeared as a guest on BBC Persian, Charlie Rose, Worldfocus, Amanpour & Company, Democracy Now! and other series and channels. Views In a preface to his 1989 book, Abrahamian wrote the following about his views: \\"a sceptic by intellectual training; a democratic socialist by political preference; and, as far as religious conviction is concerned, an agnostic on most days — on other days, an atheist.\\"Also cited in In 1983 he said he has an \\"independent Marxist point of view.\\" Christoph Marcinkowski wrote that Abrahamian's publications \\"feature more or less the left-wing political perspective of their author – especially in terms of socio-political and socio-economic analysis.\\" He has been influenced by Marxist historians Christopher Hill, Eric Hobsbawm, E. P. Thompson and others. He has called Thompson a \\"towering figure for a number of reasons — not just for historians of Iran, but also for Marxist historians throughout the world.\\" He is generally sympathetic towards the Tudeh Party. Werner has described Abrahamian as a \\"vivid chronicler of the history of the Iranian Left, defying any attempt to view twentieth-century Iran exclusively through an Islamicate lens.\\" In 2006 he described Iran as a \\"third world power.\\" In 2017 he noted that the \\"gradual but consistent shift to the right in recent years naturally erodes this welfare state and thereby undermines the social basis of the regime.\\" He has described the People's Mujahedin of Iran (MEK) as a \\"mystical cult.\\" In a 1986 he objected that the New York Times obituary of Loy W. Henderson did not mention his role in the 1953 Iranian coup d'état, which he described as \\"probably his most important contribution.\\" He wrote to the Times: \\"Few ambassadors have so decisively changed the course of a country's history. What is more, he set a State Department precedent by permitting secret agents to use the embassy compound to carry out the coup. Your oversight would have amused George Orwell; it certainly would not have surprised him.\\" Abrahamian has said that \\"heroes are to be avoided.\\" He has described Donald Trump as \\"at heart a con man spouting out verbiage to sell a particular product.\\" He called the Trump presidency a \\"nightmare.\\" Publications Abrahamian has authored or coauthored the following books: *Iran Between Two Revolutions (Princeton University Press, 1982) *Radical Islam: the Iranian Mojahedin (I.B. Tauris, 1989) *The Iranian Revolution (Yale University Press, 1989) *Khomeinism: Essays on the Islamic Republic (University of California Press, 1993) *Tortured Confessions: Prisons and Public Recantations in Modern Iran (University of California Press, 1999) *Inventing the Axis of Evil: The Truth about North Korea, Iran, and Syria with Bruce Cumings and Moshe Ma'oz (The New Press, 2004) *Targeting Iran with David Barsamian, Noam Chomsky, and Nahid Mozaffari (City Lights Books, 2007) *A History of Modern Iran (Cambridge University Press, 2008) *The Coup: 1953, the CIA, and the Roots of Modern U.S.-Iranian Relations (The New Press, 2013) =Iran Between Two Revolutions= Abrahamian's' best known and most cited book is Iran Between Two Revolutions (1982), published by Princeton University Press. It is an account of the history of Iran from the Constitutional Revolution of 1905–06 to the Islamic Revolution of 1978–79. Initial reviews were largely positive. Criticisms included disproportional focus on the Communist movement and the Tudeh Party, and reliance on British archives. Sepehr Zabih wrote that it is constrained by the ideological bias of neo- Marxist approach of E. P. Thompson. M. E. Yapp wrote: \\"with all its imperfections, Abrahamian's book is the most interesting and exciting book on the recent history of Iran which has appeared for many years.\\" Zabih was more reserved: \\"this work is a significant addition to the literature on some aspects of the Iranian communist movement. The author is well versed in the selected periods of recent Iranian history. No one with sustained interest in Iranian politics, especially those of the left, could afford to ignore this volume.\\" Gene R. Garthwaite wrote that the book made three significant contributions: \\"its class analysis will force all of us-Marxist and non- Marxist alike-to re-examine our ideas about Iran's twentieth-century history and will provide the basis for discussion for some time to come; it gives the best account of the development of the Tudeh party and its social, intellectual, and political bases; and it presents the most detailed account of the Pahlavi period (ca. 1921-78) and its political history.\\" Mazzaoui described it as \\"the best and most balanced account of the social and political developments in contemporary Persian history.\\" =Radical Islam: The Iranian Mojahedin= In Radical Islam: The Iranian Mojahedin (1989) Abrahamian investigated the origins and history of the People's Mujahedin of Iran (MEK). He concludes that the MEK has become a \\"religio-political sect\\" and a cult of personality, \\"at its most extreme,\\" has been formed around its leader, Massoud Rajavi. It was well-received by reviewers. Eric Hooglund called it a \\"very important book\\" that provides \\"detailed, objective, and erudite analysis\\" of the MEK. He also argued that its most important contribution is the exposition of the party's ideology. Mazzaoui wrote: \\"There is very little to criticize in this masterfully written piece of current research. Dr. Abrahamian writes sympathetically and at times dramatically-but always as an accomplished scholar.\\" =Khomeinism= Abrahamian's 1993 book on Iran's first Supreme Leader, Ruhollah Khomeini and his ideology, is entitled Khomeinism. The book consisted of five essays. He argued that Khomeinism is \\"best understood as a populist movement, not a religious resurgence.\\" He described Khomeini's movement as a form of Third World populism. Fred Halliday called it a \\"superb study of political ideology in general and of the ideological evolution of the founder of the Islamic Republic in particular.\\" Baktiari had a mixed review. He noted that it is well written, but \\"far from well documented.\\" However, he called it a \\"stimulating book that deserves wide readership.\\" Fakhreddin Azimi described it as a \\"lucid and provocative book.\\" =Tortured Confessions= Abrahamian's 1999 book Tortured Confessions: Prisons and Public Recantations in Modern Iran coverts political repressions against opposition movements both before and after the Islamic Revolution, ending with the mass executions of 1988. It reviews interrogation tactics and prison facilities used in 20th century Iran. It was well-received by critics. Mahdi praised it as a significant and timely book. =A History of Modern Iran= A History of Modern Iran, published in 2008, was widely praised. The book narrates state building of modern Iran. John Limbert called it a \\"scholarly, readable, and engaging study of the last century of Iranian history.\\" Philip S. Khoury went as far as to describe it as \\"the most intelligent and perceptive history of modern Iran available in the English language.\\" =The Coup= Abrahamian's 2013 book The Coup: 1953, the CIA, and the Roots of Modern U.S.-Iranian Relations was met with mixed to favorable reviews. David S. Painter opined that \\"Despite some problems, The Coup is a valuable corrective to previous work and an important contribution to Iranian history.\\" Mark Gasiorowski was more critical. He argued that the book does not provide any \\"major new revelations or insights and is misleading in several ways.\\" =Academic articles=\\"The Crowd in Iranian Politics 1905-1953.\\" Past & Present, no. 41 (1968): 184-210. *\\"The Crowd in the Persian Revolution.\\" Iranian Studies 2, no. 4 (1969): 128-50. *\\"Communism and Communalism in Iran: The Tudah and the Firqah-I Dimukrat.\\" International Journal of Middle East Studies 1, no. 4 (1970): 291-316. *\\"Kasravi: The Integrative Nationalist of Iran.\\" Middle Eastern Studies 9, no. 3 (1973): 271-95. *\\"Oriental Despotism: The Case of Qajar Iran.\\" International Journal of Middle East Studies 5, no. 1 (1974): 3-31. *\\"European Feudalism and Middle Eastern Despotisms.\\" Science & Society 39, no. 2 (1975): 129-56. *\\"The Political Crisis Intensifies.\\" MERIP Reports, no. 71 (1978): 3-6. *\\"Factionalism in Iran: Political Groups in the 14th Parliament (1944-46).\\" Middle Eastern Studies 14, no. 1 (1978): 22-55. *\\"The Nonrevolutionary Peasantry of Modern Iran.\\" Iranian Studies 11, no. 1/4 (1978): 259-304. *\\"The Causes of the Constitutional Revolution in Iran.\\" International Journal of Middle East Studies 10, no. 3 (1979): 381-414. *\\"Iran in Revolution: The Opposition Forces.\\" MERIP Reports, no. 75/76 (1979): 3-8. *\\"Structural Causes of the Iranian Revolution.\\" MERIP Reports, no. 87 (1980): 21-26 *\\"The Guerrilla Movement in Iran, 1963-1977.\\" MERIP Reports, no. 86 (1980): 3-15. *\\"'Ali Shari'ati: Ideologue of the Iranian Revolution.\\" MERIP Reports, no. 102 (1982): 24-28. *\\"Ahmad Ashraf: Bazaar and Mosque in Iran's Revolution.\\" MERIP Reports, no. 113 (1983): 16-18. *\\"Khomeini: fundamentalist or populist?

Recognition In 1995 Fred Halliday opined in Iranian Studies that Ervand Abrahamian \\"has already established himself as one of the finest writers on twentieth-century Iran.\\" Eric Hooglund wrote in 2000 that Abrahamian's books have \\"established his reputation as the leading scholar of Iran's twentieth- century social history.\\" Reza Afshari wrote in 2002 that since the publication of the seminal Iran Between Two Revolutions (1982), Abrahamian has \\"become one of the most influential historians of modern Iran.\\" He is widely recognized a leading historian of modern Iran, and, by some, as the \\"preeminent historian of modern Iran.\\" He has also been described as \\"one of the preeminent Iranian historians of his generation.\\" Mansour Farhang noted that his books are \\"indispensable source of information, insight and analysis for scholars and general readers as well.\\" He was elected Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2010. He is a member of the Middle East Studies Association of North America and the American Historical Association.

As LGBTQ people have become more accepted in the mainstream culture more studies have confirmed that they are one of the most targeted groups for harassment and bullying. An \\"analysis of 14 years of hate crime data\\" by the FBI found that gays and lesbians, or those perceived to be gay, \\"are far more likely to be victims of a violent hate crime than any other minority group in the United States\\".SPLC’s Intelligence Report: Gays Targeted for Hate Crimes Far More Than Any Other Minority in America, November 22, 2010.Mark Potok, \\"Gays Remain Minority Most Targeted by Hate Crimes\\", Intelligence Report, Winter 2010, Issue Number: 140. “As Americans become more accepting of LGBT people, the most extreme elements of the anti-gay movement are digging in their heels and continuing to defame gays and lesbians with falsehoods that grow more incendiary by the day,” said Mark Potok, editor of the Intelligence Report. “The leaders of this movement may deny it, but it seems clear that their demonization of gays and lesbians plays a role in fomenting the violence, hatred and bullying we’re seeing.” Because of their sexual orientation or gender identity/expression, nearly half of LGBTQ students have been physically assaulted at school.Jeremy Biglow, \\"LGBT activists say: 'That's so gay' is so very passe\\", The Corsair, May 28, 2010. The campaign takes positive steps to counteract hateful and anti-gay speech that LGBTQ students experience in their daily lives in hopes to de-escalate the cycle of hate speech/harassment/bullying/physical threats and violence.Ellen Greenblatt, Serving LGBTIQ Library and Archives Users: Essays on Outreach, Service, Collections and Access, McFarland, 2010, , , pages 71-6. The campaign was created by the New York office of Arnold Worldwide, part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners unit of Havas, and the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN). The campaign is the Advertising Council's first LGBT awareness campaign and is trying to achieve an ending to the use of what they consider offensive phrases such as \\"that's so gay\\". Television commercials for the campaign include singer Hilary Duff as well as comedian Wanda Sykes. In 2008 the campaign won the Ad Council's Gold Bell award for \\"Best Public Service Advertising Campaign\\" from the Ad Council.  Background  A U.S. government study, titled Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide, published in 1989, found that LGBT youth are four times more likely to attempt suicide than other young people.Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide This higher prevalence of suicidal ideation and overall mental health problems among gay teenagers compared to their heterosexual peers has been attributed to Minority Stress. Depression and drug use among LGBT people have both been shown to increase significantly after new laws that discriminate against gay people are passed. Institutionalized and internalized homophobia may also lead LGBTQ youth to not accept themselves and have deep internal conflicts about their sexual orientation.Gibson, P. (1989), “Gay and Lesbian Youth Suicide”, in Fenleib, Marcia R. (ed.), Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide, United States Government Printing Office, \\"Approximately 25 percent of lesbian, gay and bisexual students and university employees have been harassed due to their sexual orientation, as well as a third of those who identify as transgender, according to the study and reported by the Chronicle of Higher Education.\\" \\"LGBT students are three times as likely as non-LGBT students to say that they do not feel safe at school (22% vs. 7%) and 90% of LGBT students (vs. 62% of non-LGBT teens) have been harassed or assaulted during the past year.\\" In addition, \\"LGBQ students were more likely than heterosexual students to have seriously considered leaving their institution as a result of harassment and discrimination.\\" Susan Rankin, a contributing author to the report in Miami, found that “Unequivocally, The 2010 State of Higher Education for LGBT People demonstrates that LGBTQ students, faculty and staff experience a ‘chilly’ campus climate of harassment and far less than welcoming campus communities.\\" Homophobia arrived at by any means can be a gateway to bullying. As seen in the nine LGBTQ youth suicides in September 2010, severe bullying can lead to extremities such as suicide. It does not always have to be physical, but it can be emotional, viral, sexual, and racial, too. Physical bullying is kicking, punching, while emotional bullying is name calling, spreading rumors and other verbal abuse. Viral, or cyber bullying, involves abusive text messages or messages of the same nature on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media networks. Sexual bullying is unwanted touching, lewd gestures or jokes, and racial bullying has to do with stereotypes and discrimination. Bullying is often dismissed as a \\"rite of passage\\", but studies have shown it has negative physical and psychological effects. \\"Sexual minority youth, or teens that identify themselves as gay, lesbian or bisexual, are bullied two to three times more than heterosexuals\\", and \\"almost all transgender students have been verbally harassed (e.g., called names or threatened in the past year at school because of their sexual orientation (89%) and gender expression (89%)\\", according to GLSEN's Harsh Realities, The Experiences of Transgender Youth In Our Nation’s Schools. These issues have become more mainstream in the 2000s (decade), and even more so in the months of September and October 2010 when a series of suicides got national attention. In August 2010 the US Department of Education (DOE) hosted the first-ever National Bullying Summit. President Barack Obama has posted an \\"It Gets Better\\" video on The White House website as part of the It Gets Better Project, it became the second most-viewed video on the White House YouTube channel. \\"More than 34,000 people die by suicide each year,\\" making it \\"the third leading cause of death among 15 to 24 year olds with lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth attempting suicide up to four times more than their heterosexual peers.\\" In 2004, 1,985 American adolescents under the age of twenty committed suicide, an increase of 18% from the previous year. Though it is impossible to know the exact suicide rate of LGBT youth because sexuality and gender minorities are often hidden and even unknown, particularly in this age group. Further research is currently being done to explain the prevalence of suicide among LGBT youths.\\"Sexual Orientation and Youth Suicide\\" by Dr. Gary Remafedi, October 6, 1999, retrieved 2 May 2006.\\"Youth suicide risk and sexual orientation - Statistical Data Included\\" by Rutter, Philip A & Soucar, Emil, Summer 2002, retrieved 2 May 2006.Articles Relating to Suicide by GLB Youth, retrieved 3 May 2006.  The Campaign  Kevin Jennings, who is openly gay and is the Assistant Deputy Secretary for the Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools at the U.S. Department of Education, has experienced bullying himself at school and has hoped for this campaign for over ten years.SPECIAL REPORT: Growing Up Gay , WJBF-TV News, November 15, 2010. The campaign aims to reduce homophobic slang among youth, and educate parents and teachers on how to create a safe space for LGBT teens. GLSEN and the Ad Council have reported that over half of all students have heard homophobic remarks being made often at school, and 9 out of 10 LGBT students have been harassed at school over the last year. The campaign encourages students to get involved by starting a Gay-Straight Alliance, educating their peers, and working to create a safer environment for LGBT students. This is the first campaign on GLBT issues since the Ad Council was founded in 1942.Stuart elliot, Accounts, People, Miscellany, New York Times, November 23, 2008.San Jones, \\"Ad Council, GLSEN team up to stop negative gay speak\\", Out & About Newspaper, November 1, 2008. The campaign uses the slogan \\"When you say ‘That’s so gay,’ do you realize what you say? Knock it off.\\" Previously the council has run other anti-discrimination campaigns like \\"A mind is a terrible thing to waste,” for the United Negro College Fund, and \\"Expect the best from a girl and that’s what you’ll get\\" to promote gender equality. GLSEN spent approximately $2 million dollars to produce the campaign, which was released along with GLSEN's 2007 School Climate Survey. It includes three television public service announcements (PSAs), six print PSAs and three radio PSAs.Joseph M. Zappala, Ann R. Carden, Public Relations Writing Worktext: A Practical Guide for the Profession, Taylor & Francis, 2009, , , p. 203. The ad was the first ever campaign by the Ad Council, \\"which directs and coordinates public service campaigns on behalf of Madison Avenue and the media industry\\", to address any GLBTQ issues.Stuart Elliot, \\"A Push to Curb the Casual Use of Ugly Phrases\\", New York Times, October 7, 2008. The campaign was done pro bono by the New York office of Arnold Worldwide. In researching the possibility that public service directors, who decide which pro bono campaigns their media outlet will run, they found only a \\"very small percentage\\" who would not run the campaign but mainly due to their audience was much older. They also tested how to deliver the messages to \\"tough and media savvy\\" kids \\"that speaks to young people in a tone they do not deem patronizing or condescending.\\" Their goal became \\"to show the situation in a new light [...] to point out this language can be hurtful and let the kids make their own decisions.\\" After the first year of the campaign had been reached, the second harder-hitting phase addressing the consequences, \\"sometimes life-or-death\\", of anti-gay language was launched.\\"Significantly more teens think 'That's so gay' is an inappropriate phase\\", GLSEN Newswire, December 15, 2009.GLSEN Ramps Up 'ThinkB4YouSpeak' Campaign Against Anti-Gay Language in Schools, School Library Journal, December 14, 2009. The first phase focussed on showing the television PSAs to get young people to see how their language can be hurtful, the ads combined for \\"more than $9 million worth of media exposure for the campaign's message since its launch in October 2008.\\" The second phase will be more viral and enable people to embed banners and materials on websites and in their social media use. All the materials are downloadable from the campaign site. The Ad Council reports a high recognition of the television spots among teens (41% of teens aged 13–16 nationwide reporting that they have seen or heard at least one PSA) and a recent survey conducted by the Council shows \\"significant shifts in key attitudes and behaviors regarding the use of anti- LGBTQ slurs.\\" Another downloadable feature is a meter that tracks the occurrence of common LGBTQ slurs such as \\"fag\\" and \\"dyke\\" \\"in real time—on the popular micro-blogging site Twitter.\\"  See also  Day of Silence * Bullying * Hate speech * Social stigma * Verbal abuse * Minority stress  References   External links  Think B4 You Speak Official Website * GLSEN Official Website * GLSEN Student Organizing 2008 establishments in New York (state) 2000s in the United States 2010s in the United States Anti-bullying campaigns Homophobia LGBT and education LGBT youth Public awareness campaigns Public service announcements of the United States Havas Words and phrases introduced in 2008 ","title":"Think Before You Speak (campaign)"},{"id":"19701439","text":"Liardet may refer to: *Claude Liardet, Major General in the British Army *Frances Liardet, writer and translator of Arabic literature *Henry Maughan Liardet, Major General in the British Army, son of Claude Liardet *Tim Liardet, English poet and critic *Wilbraham Liardet, Australian hotelier, water-colour artist and historian ","title":"Liardet"},{"id":"19701487","text":"Abuná can refer to: * Abuna River, river between Bolivia and Brazil * Abuná Province, Bolivia See also Abuna, title of bishop in Ethiopian Orthodox Church ","title":"Abuná"},{"id":"19701511","text":"All Saints Chapel and Morris Family Burial Ground is a historic Episcopal church located at Morris in Otsego County, New York.

Twenty-five-year-old right back, Andrew Hannah was brought from Renton to replace the retired George Dobson. A disappointed Nick Ross returned to Preston having missed their double winning season and was replaced by the Bolton veteran left back, Dan Doyle. Charlie Parry arrived from Chester St Oswalds, pushing James Weir out of the side and striker Frank Sugg was also pushed out as Fred Geary was brought in from Notts County. Joe Davies returned to his hometown club Chirk to be replaced by Alex Latta from Dumbarton meaning that no less than five new signings made their debut on the opening day of the season with two of them, Geary and Parry both becoming instant heroes by scoring the goals in a 3–2 victory over Blackburn. The loss of inside right Robert Watson to Gorton Villa during the summer left a gap that wasn't properly filled until November when Alec Brady arrived from Sunderland and also scored on his debut in the 8–0 mauling of Stoke. His arrival completed what became the first choice eleven for the season but they only actually played as a team on one occasion when, in the formation listed above, they slumped to their worst result of the entire season, losing 1–5 at home to Preston on 16 November, despite leading at half time. Their second half display that day would ultimately cost Everton the title as the two points won by Preston proved to be the margin between the two sides at the end of the season. Centre Half, George Farmer was heavily criticised for the defeat and was the only change for the next game, which Everton won 4–2 at Blackburn Rovers. He never regained his place in the side and was released at the end of the season. Farmer's and Brady's Everton careers overlapped only three games, hence the solitary appearance of the first eleven, although the other nine, along with Farmer during the first half of the season and Brady during the latter half were almost a constant, with the result that five played all twenty-two games while Holt and Latta each missed just one. Other players used in the Football League Bob Cain (4 appearances at centre back), Walter Cox (4 apps in goal), Harry Hammond (1 app at left back), R Jamieson (1 app at centre forward), Charles Jolliffe (1 app in goal), Robert Jones (1 app at inside right), Daniel Kirkwood (11 apps at inside right), W Orr (1 app at centre forward), Frank Sugg (1 app at centre back), James Weir (3 apps at left back) Sugg and Weir had both been first team regulars the previous season but were edged out by new faces, the former going on to achieve greater fame as a cricketer of the highest calibre.

Administratively, the dictionary belongs to the Institute of the Polish Language, Cracow, which is incorporated in the Polish Academy of Sciences. History As with similar dictionaries in other European countries, the origins of the Lexicon Mediae et Infimae Latinitatis Polonorum date from a project launched through the Union Académique Internationale in 1920, which aimed to compile a great common dictionary of Medieval Latin based on excerpts from the different national sources. Since the initiative at that time was not fully possible to be accomplished and caused many technical problems, it eventually resulted in the establishment of a number of separate, national dictionaries after suggestions given by Dr Plezia.Marian Plezia — Scripta minora. Łacina średniowieczna i Wincenty Kadłubek, pp. 133 Kraków 2001, DWN In Poland, preparatory work started immediately (under the auspices of the Polish Academy of Learning), and the majority of the excerpts were collected in the years 1924–1939. Subsequently, due to the outbreak of the Second World War, progress on the dictionary was impeded for some years.

The two held joint control over the street gang following the death of Mike McGloin in 1883; however, both men were executed for separate murders only months apart from each other. They were the last powerful leaders of the organization and, following their downfall, the Whyos were eventually replaced by the Eastman and Five Points Gangs. His arrest for the murder of well-known Five Points debutante Bridget \\"Beezy\\" Garrity during 1886 was followed by one of the most publicized trials of New York's history.Asbury, Herbert. The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the New York Underworld. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928. (211-212) English, T.J. Paddy Whacked: The Untold Story of the Irish American Gangster. New York: HarperCollins, 2005. (pg. 33, 36-38) Early life Growing up in a Five Points tenement district, Daniel Driscoll amassed a considerable criminal record by the time he had become a young adult. He was arrested 25 times for transgressions that frequently involved stabbings and shootings, and he served a combined 16 years in both the New York State Penitentiary and New York State Prison. He also acted as a fagin training local youths to pickpocket.\\"A Struggle in the Dark; Firing at an Enemy and Killing a Friend, How Lizzie Garrity was Shot and Killed by Daniel Driscoll During an Early Morning Quarrel\\" _New York Times._ 27 Jun 1886. In 1882, Driscoll was arrested for grand larceny but escaped from The Tombs when, while being transported in a Black Maria, he switched names with a man arrested for public drunkenness. Upon their arrival, Driscoll simply paid a $10 fine and walked out of the prison.\\"Driscoll Plans An Escape.; He Is Detected And Removed To Another Cell\\". _New York Times._ 29 Sep 1886 Whyos Gang Prominent members of the Whyos Gang during its heyday in the late 1870s-early 1880s Top row left to right: Baboon Connolly, Josh Hines, Bull Hurley Middle row left to right: Clops Connelly, Dorsey Doyle, Googy Corcaran Bottom row left to right: Mike Lloyd, Piker Ryan, Red Rocks Farrell He had become a prominent member of the Whyos by the early 1880s, at the time the most dominant street gang in the city, and became leader of the organization with Danny Lyons following the execution of longtime leader Mike McGloin in 1883. In 1885, he was forced to leave the city and spent some time on the West Coast before returning to New York in May 1886. Murder of Beezy Garrity On June 26, 1886, Driscoll rode by coach to a three-story brick house on the north side of Hester Street. According to traditional accounts, Driscoll had been approached by Bridget \\"Beezy\\" Garrity, who claimed she had been cheated by the owner of a panel house operating within the Whyos territory. Although he had been barred from the property of the resident \\"bouncer\\" John McCarty (or McCarthy), with whom he had been involved in a long-standing feud, he arrived at the house with Garrity at around 4:00 am. He sent Garrity ahead of him so that she could be let in by McCarty and then let Driscoll in afterwards. However, after Garrity was let in to the front parlor, McCarty spotted Driscoll and attempted to close the door. Driscoll was able to block the door open with his arm and, during the struggle, McCarty drew his revolver. What happened after this point is unclear. According to news accounts, Garrity attempted to stop McCarty from using his weapon. Alerted by her cries, Driscoll took his own revolver out and attempted to shoot McCarty by aiming at him from between the edge of the door and the doorjamb. His first shot hit the wall opposite McCarty. He then tried, unsuccessfully, to fire between the inner door and the doorjamb. Both McCarty and Garrity ran from the area at this point, with Garrity going to the back room. As Driscoll entered the darkened hallway, Garrity ran out from a door leading from the back room. Driscoll apparently thought that this was McCarty and fired into the dark, hitting Garrity in the abdomen. He then attempted to flee the area. Driscoll was pursued by police officers then arriving at the house. Several warning shots were fired, but he did not stop. Driscoll was chased by police before disappearing into the open door of a Baxter Street tenement where his mother lived. An extensive search of the area was conducted and he was eventually found by police hiding behind the door of an unoccupied apartment in the next building. He denied shooting Garrity and had no weapon on him but was taken into custody and held at the Mulberry Street police station. Garrity was taken to St. Vincent's Hospital, where she died that afternoon. Before she died, she identified McCarty as her attacker. McCarty was initially arrested; however he denied he had fired a shot and showed his revolver which was still loaded and not fired. This claim was later dismissed believing that she was attempting to protect her supposed lover. Murder trial Fifty members of the Whyos were in the courtroom at the time of his arraignment, however they were forced to leave by the presiding judge Justice Patterson. On the morning of June 28, Driscoll and McCarty were taken to the Tombs Police Court. They appeared friendly and were talking for some time prior to the proceedings. Once court was in session however, both men blamed each other for Garrity's death. When McCarty testified, he claimed that he had been sitting in his room when Garrity, a woman he claimed had never seen before, entered his home with Driscoll following closely behind her. He closed the door behind her and then Driscoll firing his pistol through an opening just below the upper hinge. Believing that Driscoll might enter the house another way and shoot him from behind, McCarty then jumped from a window in an adjoining room into the yard. He had heard a second shot, but did not return to the house until he had seen Driscoll being arrested by police who had arrived by that time. Entering his room, he discovered Garrity lying on his bed and who accused him of having shot her. Upon hearing this, he immediately handed his pistol to an officer, Peter Monahan, who found that the gun was fully loaded and no shots had been fired. Monahan would corroborate this story during the trial. Driscoll interrupted court proceedings claiming that he himself was unarmed at the time of the incident and that McCarty was the only one who could have shot Garrity. Driscoll then addressed the court. Carrie Wilson, a local Chrystie Street resident, testified that she was in the building at the time of the shooting and that she had seen Driscoll and Garrity arrive in a coach with another man and woman. She further claimed that she had seen Driscoll fire two shots through the door and, after the second shot, a woman fell. John Green and Emmanuel Devoss, both local residents, said they were in the back room when they also heard shots fired.\\"Lizzie Garrity's Death; Daniel Driscoll and John McCarty Held For Examination\\" _New York Times._ 28 Jun 1886. On the last day of the trial, a doctor from St. Vincent's Hospital made a surprise appearance and testified that Garrity told him McCarthy was the man who shot her. Driscoll's lawyer, Bill Howe, was also able to weaken the credibility of the witnesses testimony; however, Driscoll was found guilty of first degree murder on September 30, 1886.\\"Driscoll Found Guilty.; The Jury Reaches A Decision In A Short Half Hour\\". _New York Times._ 01 Oct 1886 Danny Driscoll's criminal life depicted in an illustration from the New York World newspaper, January 23, 1888 Danny Driscoll was held in the Tombs Prison during the murder trial of Beezy Garrity and was later executed there. Imprisonment and execution Days before his conviction, Driscoll was moved to \\"Murderer's Row\\" after it was discovered by the warden that Driscoll had been attempting to tunnel out of his cell. He was guarded by Inspector Williams and 75 police officers for the remainder of his time in The Tombs. He was allowed to see his relatives the day before his execution and, in his last words to his wife, Driscoll said \\"I die happy. Take good care of yourself, Mary. I'll pray for you in heaven.\\" Maintaining his innocence, he continued to make criminal charges against Warden Walsh. These charges were disputed among a number of prison guards who signed a petition in his defense.\\"Driscoll's Last Day\\". _New York Times._ 23 Jan 1888. On the morning of January 23, 1888, Driscoll was brought to the yard of The Tombs Prison, where he was publicly hanged. His execution was witnessed by Sheriff Grant and his deputy, Fathers Pendergrast and Gilenas, and fourteen reporters. Also present was Commodore Elbridge T. Gerry, who attended the execution to report that the execution had been conducted in a humane and just manner.\\"Daniel Driscoll Hanged\\". _New York Times._ 24 Jan 1888.

Longtime rivals of the Gas House Gang, Cariggio shot and killed their leader Tommy Lynch in a gunfight in early-1914.Asbury, Herbert. The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the New York Underworld. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928. (pg. 335) On March 3, Cariggio left his mother's home on Second Avenue. He was found shot to death outside a bookstore on East Thirteenth Street around 7:30 that evening. Although no eyewitnesses were found, nearby residents reported hearing four gunshots. Reverend Frances Edwards of Grace Chapel was having his supper in the rectory when he heard the disturbance and telephoned police. John Morelli, the bookstore owner, and three other men were attending to Cariggo when police arrived minutes later. Questioned by Lieutenant Hennessy and detectives Bonano and Grotano, the men said they hid in doorways when the shooting started and did not see anything. Nine members of Cariggio's gang were taken to the Fifth Street police station for questioning. Papers discovered in Cariggio's pockets were suspected to have been possible clues to his murder, but the case remained unsolved.\\"Noted Gangster Killed; Police Can't Find Witnesses to Shooting of \\"Gold Mine Jimmy\\".\\" _New York Times._ 04 March 1914.

They are blood-feeding parasites of the white-tailed deer - Odocoileus virginianus in the southeastern United States and Central America, the red brocket deer - Mazama americana in Mexico to northern Argentina, and also an incidental parasite of domestic cattle, Cougars - Puma concolor, and man. Deer keds are small brown, flattened flies . Females are slightly larger than males, with a body length of 3.5-4.5 mm for females 3 mm for males. They have a tough protective exoskeleton to prevent them from being crushed. They shed their wings upon finding a suitable host. As in all Hippoboscidae, both males and females are blood feeders. They are often misidentified as ticks. The female fly will produce a single larva at a time, retaining the larva internally until it is ready to pupate. The larva feeds on the secretions of a milk gland in the uterus of the female. After three larval instars, a white pre-pupa which immediately forms a hard dark puparium. The pupa is usually deposited where the deer slept overnight. When the pupa has completed its pupation, a winged adult emerges and flies in search of a suitable host. On finding one, the fly sheds its wings and is permanently associated with the same host. This is typical of most members of the family Hippoboscidae. L. mazamae are known to carry several species of the Bartonella bacterium, but it has not yet been positively proved whether they are active vectors of Bartonella infections, or just carry the bacterium as a by product of their blood feeding habits.

It is the sole species in the family Centrophrynidae, distinguished from other deep-sea anglerfishes by various characters including four pectoral radials, an anterior spine on the subopercular bone, and a short hyoid (chin) barbel in both sexes. Distribution The horned lantern fish occurs in the Pacific Ocean from Baja California south to the Marquesas Islands and the Gulf of California. Specimens have also been captured in other locations, including New Guinea, the South China Sea, Venezuela, and the Mozambique Channel, suggesting a wide oceanic distribution in tropical and subtropical waters. Specimens were caught at depths from 650 to over 2000 m (2130–6560 ft), while larvae have been recovered close to the surface to a depth of . Description The female horned lantern fish measures up to in length and is long and slender, with a large head and jaws of equal length. The jaws are filled with slender, recurved, depressible teeth of mixed large and small sizes. There is a large oval pit in front of each eye in specimens larger than 42 mm. The eye itself lies beneath the skin and appears through a translucent patch. The fish is reddish brown to black in color; its skin is covered with numerous close-set spines. The illicium (\\"fishing rod\\") and esca (lure) are attached to the snout. The esca has a fan-shaped appendage in front and another short appendage on the back; the tip is white with scattered large melanophores. There is a small hyoid barbel, although it is vestigial in adult females. The males are much smaller and dark brown in color, measuring up to long and lacking the illicium and esca. The known specimens are all immature, though already with large olfactory organs and well-developed denticular plates on the tip of the snout bearing 3-4 curved teeth each. Their hyoid barbel distinguishes them from the males of all other deep-sea anglerfish. The two known larvae measure 4.2 mm and 7.5 mm long and have short, stout bodies with moderately inflated skin.Pietsch, Theodore W. and Christopher P. Kenaley. (2005). Centrophryne spinulosa. Prickly Seadevils. Version 3 November 2005 (under construction). The Tree of Life Web Project. Biology Unlike other deep-sea anglerfish, female horned lantern fish have only a single ovary lined with villi-like epithelial projections rather than epithelial folds. Similar to other ceratioid anglerfish, the males of the horned lantern fish undergo sexual parasitism. A female horned lantern fish has been found with a parasitic male Melanocetus johnsonii attached, though the coupling was likely in error (possibly occurring while the two fish were in the net) and there was no fusion of tissues. The function of the hyoid barbel in the horned lantern fish is unknown. The only other deep-sea anglerfishes that have a hyoid barbel are the linophrynids, where it occurs only in the females and is often elaborate and/or bioluminescent.

It was originally released on September 23, 2008 as part of Windows Ultimate Extras, and contained 60 levels including a 20-level tutorial. A free map editor (level builder) was also released, however it is not compatible with the Games for Windows – Live version of Tinker. It is only compatible with the Windows Ultimate Extras version. On December 15, 2009, an expanded Live-enabled version of the game was released on the Games for Windows – Live client. The game is available for Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7, including users who do not have access to Windows Vista Ultimate Extras in other Windows Vista editions, and contains 160 levels including the tutorial. This version also has 15 Achievements worth 200G, similar to many Xbox Live Arcade games. Like every Games for Windows - Live game, it requires the user to sign in using a Gamertag assigned to a Windows Live ID; however, the Windows Vista Ultimate Extras version did not have this requirement.  Gameplay  Tinker is a spatial/environmental puzzle game. Players must guide a robot to an end point by moving objects, activating switches, and traversing obstacles. The playing field is a square board divided into a checkerboard pattern. The robot is given a limited number of moves it can make before it runs out of energy, so the player must guide it to the goal marker without expiring all their motions. Essentially any action the robot makes counts as a move, including taking a step, activating a switch, and turning around. Players must carefully plan their actions through a stage so as not to waste moves. Players can replenish the robot's energy by collecting batteries and thus extend the possible number of moves they are allowed to make. Players can earn an achievement star for a level by completing the course on or under par for time, energy, and cog collection, should any cogs exist on that level. Obstacles and objects present in levels include: * Batteries, which give the robot additional energy required to make moves. These come in small and large varieties, with the larger versions providing more energy. * Cogs, which award the player an achievement star if every one is collected on a level. * The exit, which is a swirling red and white circle similar in appearance to a peppermint candy. It can be moved if it rests on top of a movable block, and can be covered up by an object to be made inaccessible until the object is removed. * Switches, or de-activate laser guns, magnets, conveyor belts, and barriers; destroy bombs; and turn mirrors. * Switches, including flip switches, which must by activated by the robot, and pressure switches, which are only active when an object rests on top of them. These manipulate objects of the same color when activated. Gray objects are always active and cannot be affected by switches. Switches can activate Laser guns, which when activated fire beams in a straight line. The beam can destroy the robot, pick-up items, ice blocks, flip switches, magnets, and other laser guns. * Targets, which act as switches that are active when hit by a laser beam. * Mirrors, which re- direct the path of a laser beam in a 90 degree angle. * Conveyor belts, which can move the robot or any object. While the robot is on a conveyor belt, it can turn but not take any steps. If the end of a conveyor belt is blocked by an object, the robot is free to move once reaching the object. * Gray blocks and dice blocks, which can be pushed by the robot and differ only in appearance. If anything is on top of the block, it will also move when pushed. * Colored blocks, which can by pushed by the robot and can activate special square-shaped pressure switches of the same color. * Metal blocks, which cannot by pushed by the robot but can be moved by magnets. * Ice blocks, which are similar to gray blocks but can be destroyed by bombs and laser beams. * Magnets, which pull metal blocks towards them. If a metal block is in the path of multiple activated magnets, only the closest magnet will affect the metal block. * Barriers, which appear similar to dominoes and block access to an area. If a barrier is activated while an object rests on top of it, the barrier will not rise until the object is moved. * Bombs, which can be moved by the robot, destroy any adjacent pick-up items, ice blocks, flip switches, magnets, laser guns, targets, and mirrors when activated. Blocks and the robot itself will be moved away by one space if adjacent to an explosion. Bombs can be triggered by switches, laser beams, the explosion of an adjacent bomb, or the robot standing on top of the bomb. Any objects that can be destroyed by a bomb can also be destroyed by the robot falling onto it from above. * Teleporters, which are circular and numbered, transport any object including the robot to the teleporter of the same number located elsewhere in the level. If an object is already present on the destination teleporter when activated, the objects on both teleporters will switch places. * Lifts, which look like clothing buttons, can move the robot or an object up or down by one level. Lifts are activated by an increase in pressure; if the robot or an object moves onto a lowered lift, it will raise by one level. If the robot or an object moves onto a raised lift, it will lower by one level. Raised lifts cannot be lowered at their base and become immovable obstacles at ground level. Movable objects can only be pushed, not pulled, and two or more objects in a row cannot be pushed, even if they are all movable. Objects stacked on top of each other can be pushed if the bottom object is movable (e.g., a tower consisting of two dice blocks and a metal block can be moved only if one of the dice blocks is on the bottom). Attempting to push an immovable object or row of objects will result in a wasted move, though attempting to walk into an obstacle will not waste a move. The robot can be destroyed or rendered inoperable by being hit by a laser beam, falling from a height greater than two blocks, or running out of energy. If any of the hazards destroy the robot in the process of reaching the exit (e.g., the robot walks into a laser beam which crosses through the exit square), the hazard trumps the exit and the robot is destroyed; however, the level will be completed if the exit is reached with zero energy.  Achievement glitch (Live)  In the Live-enabled version of Tinker, it was not previously possible to earn an achievement star on Set 07 Level 19 due to the energy par value being -1. Because of this, the player could not unlock the \\"Perfection Achieved\\" achievement, thus only being able to obtain 175 achievement points out of 200. Fuel Industries game developer Nick Iannitti mentioned in Tinker blog that a fix had been sent to GFWL on March 7, 2010. The fix was up for a few hours but was removed due to a bug in auto-update code that required an unnecessary reboot. The update was then officially released on April 10, 2010, making the \\"Perfection Achieved\\" achievement obtainable.

Shang Dynasty. Unearthed from Liurongshan Village, Baisha Town.Yangxin has seven neolithic sites and eight Shang-Zhou Dynasties sites. In 201 BC, the county was built as Xiazhi (); the name \\"Yangxin\\" first appeared during the Jin Dynasty. From the Northern and Southern dynasties period, Hubei province became a noteworthy tea-producing area. It became Xingguo Army () during the Song Dynasty. During this period, Confucian schools were introduced into Xingguo. In the Yuan Dynasty, it was called Xingguo Road and had the biggest silver production among all roads in Hubei. During the Qing Dynasty the Yangxin area became Xingguo Prefecture. In the late Qing Dynasty, Yangxin County served as the headquarters for the west march of Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. The prefecture was turned into a county in 1912 and changed its name to Yangxin County in 1914. In 1926, a Communist Party of China committee was established, and Yangxin became a center of communist activities in Southeast Hubei. In the Second Sino-Japanese War, the people of Yangxin formed four counter-Japanese base areas and fought the Battle of Wuhan in order to protect Wuhan.

This marks the first console game completed and released by SimBin. The game uses the ISI (RFactor) game engine under license. It features cars and drivers from the 2007, 2006 and the original 1987 FIA World Touring Car Championship seasons, as well as the European F3000, Formula BMW, Mini Challenge and Caterham cup. The game also has three GT categories, on top of this it has racing Radicals and road cars which are the Audi R8, Koenigsegg CCX, Koenigsegg CCXR and Dodge Viper. The drivers in the game are mostly real people, such as Tiff Needell, Tor Graves, and all the Touring car drivers of the 2007 FIA WTCC championship. Tracks Tracks available in the game are those that were used in the 2007 WTCC and only the configuration used that year is available to drive for each circuit. They can all be raced in offline and online and in wet and dry conditions with up to sixteen entrants. Autódromo Internacional de Curitiba, Circuit de Pau, Macau's Guia Circuit and Porto Circuit had not been playable before on seventh-generation consoles though you could drive around Macau and sections of the Guia Circuit in Project Gotham Racing 4. The other tracks are Circuit de Valencia, Brno Circuit, Brands Hatch, Motorsport Arena Oschersleben, Autodromo Nazionale Monza, Anderstorp Raceway, Circuit Park Zandvoort, Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca, and Road America. Reception Race Pro has received mixed ratings, with an average Metacritic score of 72%. The main criticisms were the grainy textures and large amounts of tearing, sparsely constructed tracks, and lack of in-game music. The game has an issue whereby it can sometimes lose players' saved career progress when going online. Wet weather is cosmetic only, so grip levels do not change.

The alliance was created to move drum and bass out of siderooms and onto the main stages of electronic dance music events. In fall 2009 the Planet of the Drums embarked on their Tenth Anniversary Tour. The Planet of the Drums is the longest-running annual national electronic dance music tour of any genre.

'Damian said we really ought to do a tour to promote dnb because we're supposedly the three biggest draws, to prove to promoters that dnb is a viable proposition.\\" \\"Messinian (James Fiorella, Philadelphia), then part of the Substitution crew, describes the call from DSL, 'I always came to Platinum strapped with a mic, just in case. I got a call out of the blue that their MC couldn't make it. I said, 'Hells yeah, I'll pack my bags!' \\"'We realized we could use our collective weight to lean on promoters to get our music on the main stage,\\" Dieselboy admits. 'I felt like kids were getting ripped off paying full price and having to listen to dnb on the shittiest sound system while the other kids got to hear trance, techno and house on the big system. We've come a long way in elevating respect for dnb.' \\"'At first we did individual sets and tag-teamed at the end,' says AK1200. 'It evolved into a multi-setup where we do spontaneous routines. Damian usually starts and Dara or I go on after him. Then we go three records, three records, three records, with the whole night ranging from two to five hours. Our main setup is two Technics 1200s and two Pioneer CDJ-1000s with an Allen & Heath mixer, a separate Pioneer mixer with another turntable and another CDJ-1000 hooked up to an auxiliary of the main mixer. Two people are on at all times and the other is standing by.' \\"'Stylistically,' says Dara, 'We're complementary. Damian plays the hardest, myself I play the mellower tunes, and Dave is somewhere in between.' \\"Messinian says, 'I try to take the energy of the club to that next level, get everybody on the same page, sparking that fire that makes it go fucking bananas. We're a strong unified force.'\\"  Planet of the Drums Intros  In 2005? the Planet of the Drums began a tradition of creating dramatic science fiction-style audio introductions to kick off their shows.

He was killed in action during the charge which became known as the high-water mark of the Confederacy. Early years The birthplace of Captain George Allen Gilreath, known as Old Gilreath, stretched across the Brushy Mountains of Wilkes County, North Carolina. George was born September 26, 1834 to Noah Gilreath, Sr. (1800–1853) and Elizabeth Allen of Wilkes County. He grew up on a family plantation where his grandfather Alexander Gilreath, Esq. (1755–1853) had settled in 1776. His grandfather, a Revolutionary War Veteran of the Wilkes County Regiment, operated a grist mill and blacksmith shop and was active in many of the affairs of the county. He served as tax collector, constable, justice of the peace, postmaster, and school board member. George was educated in the mountain schools and learned management skills on the family plantation where about a dozen slaves worked the land. In his early 20s, he left North Carolina and headed West where he bought land in Hempsted Co., Arkansas. On July 30, 1857 he married Lurana Gilbert but when his wife and young child died, he came back to Wilkes County. Civil War On March 1, 1862, at age 27, George volunteered at Wilkesboro, NC into Company B, 55th NC Troops, as a 2nd Lieutenant. He was promoted to 1st Lieutenant on May 19. On September 15, 1862 he was promoted to Captain after Captain Forester resigned as commander of the Wilkes County Company. His military record contains special requisitions for jackets, shoes, knapsacks and other items for his men. Little did he know, in less than a year his heroic effort as acting commander of the entire 55th regiment would go down not only in North Carolina history but the history of the entire American Civil War. The afternoon of July 3, 1863 saw the Battle of Gettysburg reach its climax in the assault made on Union Troops clustered behind the stone wall on Cemetery Ridge. General Robert E. Lee would order Major General George Pickett to punch a hole in the center of the Federal Army, then attack the right and left flanks. The 55th was part of Davis' Brigade, Pettigrew's Division. Fifteen regiments of Tar Heels, including the 55th NC, were part of the 12,500 man force selected to participate in the attack. The 55th NC Regiment saw many of its field and staff officers killed or wounded in the first two days of fighting at Gettysburg. On the third day of fighting, the 55th was put under the command of senior Captain Gilreath. On July 3 at 1:00 pm the artillery barrage from 140 Confederate cannons started, and at 3:00 pm, the Confederates formed a battle line to march across a mile of open field. Lt. Joseph Hoyle of company F recalled \\"We moved forward exposed to a hot fire of grape shot and shells. When we came within range of their small arms, their fire became so destructive to the extreme, only 40 men made it out.\\" Another member of the 55th, Sgt. Whitley later wrote: We charged across the field and crossed a road about from the federal works. Our line was cut down to a mere skirmish line. Our flag had fallen a few yards back. I looked behind and saw our support in full retreat.\\" The 55th brigade commander Brigadier General Joseph R. Davis said: \\"When we approached the stone wall, we were subjected to a most galling fire of musketry and artillery that so reduced the already thinned ranks...in the assault upon the enemy's position, the coolness and courage of officers and men are worthy of high commendation\\" Although most of the Confederates failed to make it to the stone wall several members of the 55th made it to the wall and beyond. Federal Captain S.C. Armstrong of the 125th NY wrote: \\" I could not but admire the pluck of the enemy especially when after the fight I saw many of them who had rushed ahead of their fellows; lying dead, a few paces from our breastworks, mostly North Carolinians, lean lank fellows in rusty old suits, but heroes.\\" Federal General Alexander Hayes wrote: \\"The angel of death alone can produce such a field.\\" Among the dead on July 3, 1863 was the 55th acting commander, Captain George Gilreath. Legacy The United States Official Survey and early historians with eyewitness accounts agree that those killed farthest to the front belonged to the 55th North Carolina Regiment. According to the Gettysburg Commission, the men of the 55th advanced the farthest during Pickett's Charge, also known as the high-water mark of the Confederacy. This event contributed to the North Carolina saying \\"First at Bethel, Farthest at Gettysburg and Chickamauga, and Last at Appomattox\\". The Army of Northern Virginia retreated in the rain on July 4, leaving Gettysburg for Virginia. It is believed that Captain Gilreath was left on the battlefield. In 2008 a monument to honor Captain George Gilreath was placed at the family burying ground high in the Brushy Mountains of his native Wilkes County, North Carolina.

Education He attended Eggar's Grammar School, Alton, from 1970 to 1976, and then the University of Bristol, from which he graduated with a BSc (IIi) in Geology and Zoology in 1980 and a PhD in Behavioural Science in 1985. In 1998, he was awarded a Diploma in counselling and psychotherapy from the University of Surrey, and then, in 2001 he was ordained by The New Seminary, Oxford, as an Interfaith Minister and spiritual counsellor. Career Graham's initial career was with The Middlesex Hospital and Exxon, before he joined Coopers and Lybrand as a specialist in organisation development. His consultancy career continued until 2003, when he became self-employed, operating under his own name. Today, he has a portfolio careerA term coined by Charles Handy in his book, The Age of Unreason (1989) – as a leadership counsellor/mentor, a workplace chaplain, and wedding celebrant. Leadership counsellor/mentor Working individually, with senior managers, usually meeting on a monthly basis for a prolonged period, Graham combines his understanding of business and organisations generally with his psychotherapy experience to help these leaders be even more effective. While his “Conversations with Leaders” are entirely confidential, they focus on the interplay between the individual, their role and the organisation, exploring corporate strategy, the leader's tactics and the nature of their human relationships at work. His clients speak glowingly of him, and he is thought to have been behind the emergence of a number of astute, high impact leaders in the City and elsewhere. Workplace chaplain In 2005, succeeding David Welbourn, and along with Susan van Beveren, Graham was appointed by QinetiQ plc as part-time Joint Coordinator of Chaplaincy Services and as a chaplain to their Farnborough site. In these roles, they help the organisation and its people to develop emotionally, spiritually and ethically, encouraging people to find meaning in their work. They achieve this through dialogue with leaders, convening discussion groups, running personal development workshops, conducting research into work-based spirituality, and a number of other individual and group interventions. With their pioneering approach, Susan and Graham are increasingly recognised internationally as leading a major change in work-based chaplaincy. Wedding celebrant Since his ordination in 2001, Graham has become known for devising and conducting spiritually-based blessing ceremonies throughout Europe, for couples with a sense of the spiritual, who do not feel that they are embraced by mainstream religions. While his clients have included some 'celebrities' and 'society' couples under the glare of the media, most of his services are conducted in private with the couple and their friends and families. One couple were quoted as saying; \\"What was extraordinary was that he [Graham], helped us to understand our own sense of the spiritual and express this to one another and to our families in ways that we hadn't dreamt of. And he did this without once telling us what he believed in or what we should believe in.\\" Charity activities Graham is a Trustee and volunteer with a number of charities. An Amateur Swimming Association (ASA) swimming teacher, since he was 17, and Royal Life Saving Society (RLSS UK) trainer/assessor since he was 18, he currently teaches life-saving and water safety at the Dorking Life Saving Club and is Chair of the Surrey Branch of the Royal Life Saving Society. He holds the RLSS National Beach Lifeguard Qualification, RLSS National Pool Lifeguard Qualification, and their Distinction Award. An Ambulance Service First Responder himself, he also Chairs the South Central Ambulance Service League of Friends – the only NHS Ambulance Trust league. He is a Trustee of the All Hallows House Foundation, a charity based in EC3, whose charitable purpose is to improve the health and well-being of those who work and live in the City of London. The charity runs a complementary health clinic known as The Wren because of its location in the restored part of a church designed by Sir Christopher Wren on Idol Lane. Graham acts as an editor and advisor to the World Council for Corporate Governance. Author Whilst at University, Graham began to contribute articles on a broad range of topics mainly, though not exclusively, in the non-fiction arena. He has contributed to popular computing, photography, business, management and general science publications. His first book was published in 1991, jointly written with Prof Tony Bendell and Robert Millar. Since then he has written six other management titles, each of which has been translated widely and sold internationally. He has had three short stories published in relatively obscure literary magazines. Books Taguchi Methodology within Total Quality (with A Bendell and RMG Millar) – Problem Solving and Decision Making – On Route to Perfection – Making Change Happen – Self Managed Team Working – Problem Solving – Six Sigma and the Product Development Cycle – Honours In 1995 Graham was made a Distinguished Fellow of The Institute of Directors, India, alongside Dr Genichi Taguchi, the renowned Japanese industrialist. In 1993 the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust, London, made him a Winston Churchill Travelling Fellow. Through this he travelled to India, Japan and the USA, exploring self- directed working groups. This research was subsequently published by the Financial Times.

The DVD which includes the 10 making-of webisodes from the Massify Ghosts in the Machine Competition was released on March 31, 2009.  Plot  Ten years after officer Dwayne Hopper’s son disappeared, the last of 14 victims in a string of local unsolved disappearances, his suspicions are aroused by prison inmate Ronald Perkins (Richard Brake). Dwayne searches Perkins’ house and discovers a collection of torture videos featuring the missing victims from the past. In a fit of rage, Dwayne kills Perkins. But things get complicated when a wave of carnage sweeps the town, with reports of Dwayne’s own son amongst the marauding psychopaths. A number of flashbacks start to reveal that Hopper's son was kidnapped from his home, wondering if his son is still alive. Earlier in the film, Hopper begins to question Perkins' motive on how he knows that Hopper has a family, namely his wife and daughter. After doing some digging on Perkins' file, Hopper comes to a horrible realization that Perkins kidnapped his son years ago. Hopper tries to help him, but arrived too late. Hopper then shows the file to Perkins, and tells him he doesn't have a family. He calls his deputy, Hal to cone down to the station to see if the man in the cell is the killer he had been looking for, but Hal becomes skeptical at this. He then looks through Perkins' personal belongings and realized that there is no record of Ronald Perkins' living in town. A friend of the judge tells him that they will have search warrant in the morning, but Hopper decides to call his deputy to look at Perkins' home and finds a backroom in the basement full of scientific equipment. Hal notices a cage with someone inside and gets attacked by a crazed woman. During their conversation, Perkins reveals that his own family was killed by a burglar to Hopper. Perkins tries to sympathize with Hopper for losing someone they loved. Meanwhile, Hopper's daughter is out with her friends, not knowing that they are being watched by someone close by. Daisy and her boyfriend run for their lives after two of their friends are murdered. Her father arrives just in time to save her, and shoots the suspect. To their shock, the suspect comes back to life and is run over. The chief of police decides to declare a state of emergency. Hopper finds out that his own son is still alive as he witnesses him killing someone in the street. Hopper's wife Janine is having an affair after her son disappeared. Daisy tells her father that Janine is at a motel with her boyfriend, whom she witnesses being beaten to death by a woman with a champagne bottle. A local holds Daisy's boyfriend, Eric at knifepoint when he tells Hopper that everyone is dead. Hopper realizes that Perkins wanted to get revenge by taking 14 children with him.

It coordinates logistical air movements into, out of, and through Europe. The 521st AMOW expedites warfighting and humanitarian efforts by the United States Air Force throughout Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. It provides all command and control, en route maintenance support and air transportation services for air mobility operations in its area of responsibility. It performs this through aircraft maintenance units, maintenance operations centers, quality assurance, regional training center, fuel cell, aerospace ground equipment, forward supply location, and maintenance recovery teams. It operates air terminal operations centers, providing passenger and fleet services, cargo processing, special handling, ramp services, and load planning. The Wing is composed of two groups. These groups are assigned twelve squadrons and fourteen other geographically separated units. History The wing was originally constituted as the 555th Signal Aircraft Warning Battalion. The unit served as an aircraft warning unit in defense of the continental United States from 1942 to 1943. The battalion moved to England in 1944 where it provided communications support until the day after the Normandy landings when it moved to support the invading forces in France. It moved frequently to support elements of Ninth Air Force, arriving in Belgium in September and Germany in March 1945. It continued it mission during the occupation of Germany from 1945. At the end of 1945, the battalion was converted to an Air Corps unit, redesignated the 501st Tactical Control Group and its component companies replaced by Aircraft Control and Warning Squadrons. It provided radar coverage and navigational aid to allied aircraft flying over the U.S. Zone of Occupied Germany in 1946 and 1947. It was inactivated in 1947. The unit was reactivated as the 501st Aircraft Control and Warning Group in 1949 to replace the 7402d Aircraft Control and Warning Group. Between 1949 and 1960, it provided tactical control systems, including aircraft control and warning facilities, passive detection devices and guidance units in central Europe. In 1952, it became a tactical control group again. In 1954, the group moved to Landstuhl Air Base. Starting in 1955, it and the 526th Tactical Control Group provided personnel for a provisional Tactical Control Wing, which it replaced as the 501st Tactical Control Wing in 1957 to provide radar and aircraft control for all of Twelfth Air Force. It operated the Tactical Control System to exercise operational control of offensive and defensive units in Europe. In the 1960s, its mission, personnel, and equipment were combined with those of the 86th Fighter-Interceptor Wing, which was redesignated the 86th Air Division (Defense). Today the two subordinate groups include: * The 521st Air Mobility Operations Group  725th Air Mobility Squadron (Naval Station Rota, Spain)  728th Air Mobility Squadron  5th Expeditionary Air

In 1992 – 2001 and 2014 – 2018 he was the frontman of the band Naktinės Personos. In 2001 – 2009 and since 2019 Chošnau successfully develops solo career. He owns the 'Best Performer of the Year' , 'Best Song', 'Best Video', 'Golden Disc' national awards. Chošnau is continuously named as one of the most played and most performing artists of Lithuania. Biography Chošnau was born to a Lithuanian mother and Iraqi Kurdish father in Vilnius, Lithuania. The family—Chošnau with his parents and sister Greta—lived in Baghdad, Iraq until Chošnau's mother died in 1983. The 8-year-old Chošnau returned to Lithuania and was raised by his grandparents. However, his then teenaged sister was left in Baghdad with their father. Thus Chošnau grew up speaking the Arabic language and only later learned the Lithuanian language. Tragic family split was not enough for the destiny. The long lasting Iraq–Iran war separated Chošnau from his father and sister for a long time. Despite all of the difficult times and severe emotions, Chošnau established the pop music group Naktinės Personos along with Aras Vėberis in 1992. Chošnau performed as the frontman singer of Naktinės Personos over 10 years until the group split in 2001. During the Naktinės Personos national tour in 1997, Chošnau together with Aras and their manager got into road accident crashing his car and severely injuring the neck, which temporally paralysed both legs. Fortunately, after a long treatment and rehabilitation Chošnau fully recovered and returned back to the music. In 1992 – 2001 Naktinės Personos released 10 albums and 2 singles with multiple national awards the 'Band of the Year' and 'Album of the Year'. It was a truly successful band attracting up to 30,000 fans at their live concerts (Vingis Park, 1998). Since 2001 Chošnau continues releasing new style music and performing live as a solo artist proving another level of success. Chošnau released 7 solo albums until 2009 and then he made a break travelling to his fatherland Baghdad (Iraq) and Amman (Jordan) for creative and personal recharge. During his solo period, in 2003, Chošnau released his debut solo album Pusiau atmerktos akys, which was sold in a more than 10,000 copies in 3 months and was announced 'Golden',. In the same year, it was immediately followed by another solo album Mintimis su tavimi, which became 'Golden' again. In 2003 Chošnau was nominated by the national \\"Bravo Awards\\" as the \\"Male Singer of the Year\\". In 2004 Chošnau participated in a reality show Džiunglės a survival competition in Malaysian jungles organised by TV3 television channel TV3. In 2007 Chošnau took part in another TV projects such as Šok su žvaigžde!(Lithuanian installment of Dancing with the Stars) and Žvaigždžių duetai on LNK (singing competition of celebrity duos) in 2008. Chošnau song Kur gimsta lašai, released within the third solo album, became the theme song of the project Džiunglės. In 2008, Chošnau played the artist's role in a Lithuanian movie 5 dienų avantiūra ('Five Days Affair'). With respect to the fact that Naktinės Personos split in 2001 without the farewell concert tour, Chošnau and Aras Vėberis decided to recover the band in 2014 with a grand touring project 'After 20 Years'. The tour was a great success, therefore Naktinės Personos continued releasing new singles, including digital album \\"Pasaulis toks yra\\" and widely performing live in public and private concerts, also two more band tours in 2015 – 2018. However, at the end of 2018 Naktinės Personos announced of a final and irreversible split. Since 2019, Chošnau continues his solo career releasing new singles and remixing golden hits of 2001 – 2009. In 2020 January Chošnau publicly announced of the beginning of the new music project uniting creating powers with an outstanding Lithuanian DJ and music producer Leon Somov releasing their first common single \\"Laukiau ilgai\\". In 2011 Chošnau married Valda Rukstelyte (now Valda Chosnau), they have two children.

The Overman Committee was a special subcommittee of the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary chaired by North Carolina Democrat Lee Slater Overman. Between September 1918 and June 1919, it investigated German and Bolshevik elements in the United States. It was an early forerunner of the better known House Un-American Activities Committee, and represented the first congressional committee investigation of communism. The committee's final report was released in June 1919. It reported on German propaganda, Bolshevism, and other \\"un-American activities\\" in the United States and on likely effects of communism's implementation in the United States. It described German, but not communist, propaganda efforts. The committee's report and hearings were instrumental in fostering anti-Bolshevik opinion. Background A political cartoon warning of the danger of foreigners, July 1919. World War I, in which the United States and its allies fought - among other Central Powers - the German Empire, raised concern about the German threat to the United States. The Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918 were passed in response. In the Russian Revolution of 1917 the Bolshevik party, led by Vladimir Lenin, overthrew the Russian monarchy and instituted Marxism-Leninism. Many Americans were worried about the revolution's ideas infiltrating the United States, a phenomenon later named the Red Scare of 1919–20.Murray, 15-7 The Overman Committee was formally an ad-hoc subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, but had no formal name.

Brewing institutions had been largely founded by German immigrants in the mid-19th century, who brought with them knowledge and techniques for brewing beer.Congress, Brewing and Liquor Interests, volume 1, p. 3 The Committee interpreted this mission to mean a general probe into German propaganda and pro-German activities in the United States.Hagedorn, p. 53 Hearings were mandated after A. Mitchell Palmer, the federal government's Alien Property Custodian responsible for German-owned property in the U.S., testified in September 1918 that the USBA and the rest of the overwhelmingly GermanMittelman, p. 83 liquor industry harbored pro-German sentiments.Congress, Brewing and Liquor Interests, volume 1, pp. 3–4 He stated that \\"German brewers of America, in association with the United States Brewers' Association\\" had attempted \\"to buy a great newspaper\\" and \\"control the government of State and Nation\\", had generally been \\"unpatriotic\\", and had \\"pro-German sympathies\\". Hearings began September 27, 1918, shortly before the end of World War I. Nearly four dozen witnesses testified.Congress, Brewing and Liquor Interests, volume 1, p. 1387 and volume 2, p. 1385 Many were agents of the Bureau of Investigations (BOI), the predecessor of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The agents, controversiallyLowenthal, p. 37Lowenthal, p. 40 and usually erroneously, implicated high-profile American citizens as pro-German, using the fallacy of guilt by association.Lowenthal, p. 39 For example, the Bureau chief labeled some people pro-German because they had insubstantial and non-ideologicalLowenthal, p. 38 acquaintance with German agents. Others were accused because their names were discovered in the notebooks of suspected German agents, of whom they had never heard. Many attacked the BOI's actions. The Committee heard testimony that it had not conducted basic background checks of the accused and had not read source material it presented to the committee. Committee members criticized its testimony as \\"purely hearsay\\".Congress, Brewing and Liquor Interests, volume 2, p. 2453 Expansion of investigation Trotsky'll Get You If You Don't Watch Out! A political cartoon drawn by Daniel R. Fitzpatrick published in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, February 6, 1919, satirizing the Senate's expansion of the Overman Committee's authority two days earlierMurray, p. 96 On February 4, 1919, the Senate unanimously passed Senator Thomas J. Walsh'sSchmidt, p. 140 Senate Resolution 439, expanding the committee's investigations to include \\"any efforts being made to propagate in this country the principles of any party exercising or claiming to exercise any authority in Russia\\" and \\"any effort to incite the overthrow of the Government of this country\\".United States Congress, Bolshevik Propaganda, p. 6 This decision followed months of sensational daily press coverageClark, p. 16 of revolutionary events abroad and Bolshevik meetings and events in the United States, which increased anti- radical public opinion.Schmidt, p. 136 Reports that some of these meetings were attended by Congressmen caused further outrage. One meeting in particular, held at the Poli Theater in Washington, DC, was widely controversial because of a speech given by Albert Rhys Williams, a popular Congregationalist minister,Murray, p. 46 who allegedly said, \\"America sooner or later is going to accept the Soviet Government.\\"Murray, p. 94 Archibald E. Stevenson, a New York attorney with ties to the Justice Department, likely a \\"volunteer spy\\",Hagedorn 54, 58 testified on January 22, 1919, during the German phase of the subcommittee's work. He said that anti-war and anti-draft activism during World War I, which he described as \\"pro-German\\" activity, had now transformed into propaganda \\"developing sympathy for the Bolshevik movement.\\".United States Congress, Bolshevik Propaganda, 12-4; Powers, 20 The United States' wartime enemy, though defeated, had exported an ideology that ruled Russia and threatened America anew. \\"The Bolsheviki movement is a branch of the revolutionary socialism of Germany. It had its origin in the philosophy of Marx and its leaders were Germans.\\"United States Congress, Bolshevik Propaganda, 14; Lowenthal, 49 He cited the propaganda efforts of John Reed and gave many examples from the foreign press. He told the Senators, \\"We have found money coming into this country from Russia.\\"United States Congress, Bolshevik Propaganda, 19, 29 Stevenson has been described by historian Regin Schmidt as a \\"driving force\\" behind the growth of anti-Bolshevism in the United States.Schmidt, p. 138 The final catalyst for the expansion of the investigation was the Seattle General Strike, which began the day before the Senate passed Resolution 439. This confluence of events led members of Congress to believe that the alleged German-Bolshevist link and Bolshevist threat to the United States were real.Hagedorn, p. 55 Bolshevism hearings The Overman Committee's hearings on Bolshevism lasted from February 11 to March 10, 1919.Clark, p. 15 More than two dozen witnesses were interviewed.Hagedorn, p. 147 About two-thirds were violently anti-Bolshevik and advocated for military intervention in Russia. Some were refugees of the Russian Diaspora—many former government officialsHagedorn, p. 129—who left Russia because of Bolshevism.McFadden, p. 296 The overriding theme was the social chaos the Revolution had brought, but three sub-themes were also frequent: anti-Americanism among American intelligentsia, the relationship between Jews and Communist Russia, and the \\"nationalization\\" of women after the Soviet revolution. Stevenson produced a list of 200—later reduced to 62—alleged communist professors in the United States.Hagedorn, p. 55 Like lists of names provided during the German propaganda hearings, this list provoked an outcry.Lowenthal, p. 60 Stevenson declared universities to be breeding grounds of sedition, and that institutions of higher learning were \\"festering masses of pure atheism\\" and \\"the grossest kind of materialism\\".Pfannestiel, p. 13 Ambassador to Russia David R. Francis stated that the Bolsheviks were killing everybody \\"who wears a white collar or who is educated and who is not a Bolshevik.\\"Murray, p. 97 Another recurring theme at the hearings was the relationship between Jews and communists in Russia. One Methodist preacher stated that nineteen out of twenty communists were Jews;Powers, p. 47 others said the Red Army was composed mainly of former East Side New York Jews.Hagedorn, p. 148 However, after criticism from Jewish organizations,United States Congress, Bolshevik Propaganda, p. 381 Senator Overman clarified that the committee was discussing \\"apostate\\" Jews only, defined by witness George Simons as \\"one who has given up the faith of his fathers or forefathers.\\"United States Congress, Bolshevik Propaganda, p. 116 A third frequent theme was the \\"free love\\" and \\"nationalization\\" of women allegedly occurring in Soviet Russia.Nielsen, p. 30 Witnesses described an orgy in which there was no \\"respect for virtuous women\\";Lowenthal, p. 51 others who testified, including those who had been in Russia during the Revolution, denied this.Lowenthal, p. 52 After one witness read a Soviet decree saying that Russian women had the \\"right to choose from among men\\",United States Congress, Bolshevik Propaganda, p. 354 Senator Sterling threw up his hands and declared that this was a negation of \\"free love\\". However, another decree was produced stating, \\"A girl having reached her eighteenth year is to be announced as the property of the state.\\"United States Congress, Bolshevik Propaganda, p. 475 The Senators were particularly interested in how Bolshevism had united many disparate elements on the left, including anarchists and socialists of many types,United States Congress, Bolshevik Propaganda, 14-8 \\"providing a common platform for all these radical groups to stand on.\\"United States Congress, Bolshevik Propaganda, 34 Senator Knute Nelson of Minnesota responded: \\"Then they have really rendered a service to the various classes of progressives and reformers that we have here in this country.\\" Other witnesses described the horrors of the revolution in Russia and speculated on the consequences of a comparable revolution in the United States: the imposition of atheism, the seizure of newspapers, assaults on banks and the abolition of the insurance industry. The Senators heard various views of women in Russia, including claims that women were made the property of the state.United States Congress, Bolshevik Propaganda, 475 Final report A copy of the Overman Committee's final report reproduced by The New York Times on June 15, 1919 The committee's final report detailed its investigations into German propaganda, Bolshevism, and other \\"un-American activities\\" in the United States and predicted effects of communism's implementation in the United States. It was endorsed unanimously. Released in June 1919, it was over 35,000 words long, and was compiled by Major Edwin Lowry Humes. The Committee did little to demonstrate the extent of communist activity in the United States.Murray, p. 95 In its analysis of what would happen if capitalism were overthrown and replaced by communism,Schmidt, p. 144 it warned of widespread misery and hunger, the confiscation of and nationalization of all property, and the beginning of \\"a program of terror, fear, extermination, and destruction.\\"Schmidt, pp. 145–146 Anti-Bolshevik public sentiment surged after release of the report and ensuing publicity. =German investigation= Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff, Karl Boy-Ed, Franz von Papen, Dr. Heinrich Albert, and Franz von Rintelen, among others, were Germans investigated for producing propaganda. All were previously evicted from the United States for being part of a German espionage ring. The United States Brewers Association, the National German-American Alliance, and the Hamburg-American steamship line were investigated. The final report concluded that these organizations, through financial support, bribes, boycotts, and coercion, sought to control the press, elections, and public opinion. =Bolshevism investigation= The report described the Communist system in Russia as \\"a reign of terror unparalleled in the history of modern civilization\\".Schmidt, p. 145 It concluded that instituting Marxism-Leninism in the United States would result in \\"the destruction of life and property\\", the deprivation \\"of the right to participate in affairs of government\\", and the \\"further suppress[ion]\\" of a \\"substantial rural portion of the population.\\" Furthermore, there would be an \\"opening of the doors of all prisons and penitentiaries\\". It would result in the \\"seizure and confiscation of the 22,896 newspapers and periodicals in the United States\\" and \\"complete control of all banking institutions and their assets\\". \\"One of the most appalling and far reaching consequences ... would be found in the confiscation and liquidation of ... life insurance companies.\\" The report also criticized \\"the atheism that permeates the whole Russian dictatorship\\"; \\"they have denounced our religion and our God as 'lies'.\\" Despite the report's rhetoric and the headlines it produced, the report contained little evidence of communist propaganda in the United States or its effect on American labor. =Recommendations= The report's main recommendations included deporting alien radicals and enacting peacetime sedition laws.McCormick, p. 92 Other recommendations included strict regulation of the manufacture, distribution, and possession of high explosives; control and regulation of foreign language publications, and the creation of patriotic propaganda. Press reaction The press reveled in the investigation and the final report, referring to the Russians as \\"assassins and madmen,\\" \\"human scum,\\" \\"crime mad,\\" and \\"beasts.\\"Murray, 97 The occasional testimony by some who viewed the Russian Revolution favorably lacked the punch of its critics. One extended headline in February read: :Says Riffraff, Not the Toilers, Rule in Russia :American Manager of Great American Plant There Tells Experiences to Senators :Outsiders Seized Power :Came Back from Other Countries and are Growing Rich at People's Expense :Factories Being Ruined :60,000,000 Rubles Spent in Three Months at One Plant to Produce 400,000 Worth of Goods And one day later: :Bolshevism Bared by R.E. Simmons :Former Agent in Russia of Commerce Department Concludes his Story to Senators :Women are 'Nationalized' :Official Decrees Reveal Depths of Degradation to Which They are Subjected by Reds :Germans Profit by Chaos :Factories and Mills are Closed and the Machinery Sold to Them for a Song On the release of the final report, newspapers printed sensational articles with headlines in capital letters: \\"Red Peril Here\\", \\"Plan Bloody Revolution\\", and \\"Want Washington Government Overturned.\\"Murray, 98 Criticism Critics denounced the committee as a \\"propaganda apparatus\\" to stoke anti-German and anti-Soviet fears, feeding the Red ScareSproule, pp. 122–123 and spreading misinformation about Soviet Russia. The Committee attracted criticism from the public for its perceived overreach, and especially for publishing the names of those accused of association with communist organizations. One woman from Kentucky wrote to Senator Overman on behalf of her sister, who had been accused by Archibald Stevenson, criticizing the committee for its \\"brutal as well as stupid misuse of power\\" and \\"gross and cruel injustice to men and women the full peer in intellect, character and patriotism of any member of the United States Senate\\". The committee was compared to \\"a witch hunt\\" in one exchange with a witness.United States Congress, Bolshevik Propaganda, p. 893 Aftermath Lee Slater Overman, chairman of the Committee The Overman Committee did not achieve any lasting reforms.Pfannestiel, p. 132 However, the panel's sensationalism played a decisive role in increasing America's fears during the Red Scare of 1919–20. Its investigations served as a blueprint for the Department of Justice's anti- radical Palmer raids late in the year. These were led by Attorney General Palmer, whose testimony about German brewers had been the catalyst for the committee's creation. On May 1, 1919, a month after the committee's hearings ended, a bomb was mailed to Overman's home, one of a series of letter bombs sent to prominent Americans in the 1919 United States anarchist bombings. It was intercepted before it reached its target. =Later investigative committees= The Overman Committee was the first of many Congressional committees to investigate communism. In the aftermath of the Overman Committee's report, the New York State Legislature established the Lusk Committee, which operated from June 1919 to January 1920,Pfannestiel, p. xiNielsen, p. 15 Archibald E. Stevenson was its chief counsel and one of its witnesses.Hagedorn, p. 231Schmidt, p. 139 Unlike the Overman Committee, the Lusk Committee was active in raiding suspect organizations. The Overman Committee was an early forerunner of the better known House Un-American Activities Committee, which was created 20 years later.

He is best known for a broken engagement to Jane Seymour, who later became the third wife of Henry VIII. Biography William Dormer was born before 1514, the only child of Sir Robert Dormer (died 2 or 8 July 1552) of West Wycombe and Wing, Buckinghamshire, and London, and his wife Jane Newdigate (d.1568), daughter of John Newdigate (died 15 August 1528) of Harefield, Middlesex, by Amphyllis Neville (d. 15 July 1544). From 1535 until 1559 the Dormer main residence was Eythrope in Buckinghamshire. A William Dormer was in the service of Thomas Cromwell, and considered for transfer to royal service in 1538.\\"William was a baptismal name much favoured by the Dormer family and the career of the only son of Sir Robert Dormer before the 1540s is all but impossible to disentangle from those of his numerous kinsmen\\" If the subject of this biography was that William Dormer then his marriage to Mary, daughter of Sir William Sidney may have been assisted by Cromwell. Dormer was returned as the second member for Chipping Wycombe in the parliament of 1542, and served under his father's command in the war against France in 1544. He may well have been the \\"young Dormer\\" who for two years was captain of 100 men at a muster in Buckinghamshire. Two years later (in 1546) he accompanied his father to a reception at court for the French ambassador. In 1553 he was returned as a knight of the shire for Buckinghamshire in the second parliament of Edward VI. It is not known what his position was in the succession crisis in 1553 when John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, attempted to place Lady Jane Grey on the throne, but in May 1554 Queen Mary confirmed him in his post as falconer in recognition of his support for her against Northumberland. He may have been made Sheriff for Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire due to his daughter, Jane Dormer's, friendship with Queen Mary, and his daughter's connection to the Queen may also have influenced his return to Mary's fifth parliament as knight of the shire for Buckinghamshire in 1558. Tomb of Sir William Dormer and Dame Dorathe Dormer, Wing Church, Buckinghamshire After the death of Queen Mary, Dormer's mother, Jane (née Newdigate), and Dormer's daughter, Jane, left England for the continent. Dormer, too, disliked Queen Elizabeth's Anglican compromise; however his Catholic family connections did not harm his political standing, either in national politics (in 1571 he again sat as a member of Parliament for Buckinghamshire in Elizabeth's third parliament), or in local affairs. Dormer died at the age of 72, and was buried in the family vault in All Saints' Church, Wing. His second wife, Dorothy, had a monument built for him in the church, and founded an almshouse in the village of Wing in his memory. Marriages and issue Dormer married firstly Mary, eldest daughter of Sir William Sidney and Anne Pakenham. They had two sons, Thomas Dormer and Robert Dormer, said to have died as infants, and two daughters, Anne Dormer, who married Sir Walter Hungerford, and Jane Dormer, a lady in waiting to Queen Mary who married the Duke of Feria, Spanish ambassador to the Court of Saint James. After the death of his first wife Dormer married, about 1550, Dorothy Catesby (d.1613), the daughter of Anthony Catesby (d.1554) of Whiston, Northamptonshire by his wife Isabel. Dorothy Catesby was twenty years Dormer's junior. They had one son, Robert Dormer, 1st Baron Dormer, who married Elizabeth Browne, the daughter of Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu, and six daughters: Mary, who married Anthony Browne, the twin brother of Mary Browne, mother of Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton; Grissel; Katherine, who married John St John, 2nd Baron St John of Bletso (d.1596); Frances; Amphyllis; and Margaret (d.1637), who married Sir Henry Constable (d.1607). After Sir William Dormer's death his widow, Dorothy, married Sir William Pelham.

He designed more than 50 schools in Florida. In 1918-1919, Trimble employed Ida Annah Ryan as a designing architect.American Women: The Official Who's Who Among the Women of the Nation, Volume 1, edited by Durward Howes, p. 482 Trimble's was one of only ten architectural firms listed in the Orlando phone directory in 1926, the others being: Frank L. Bodine, Fred E. Field, David Hyer, Murry S. King, George E. Krug, Howard M. Reynolds, Ryan and Roberts (Ida Annah Ryan and Isabel Roberts) and Percy P. Turner. This group of architects was quite intentional about creating a style of architecture in Central Florida suited to the region. Here is how they described it in an article from The Florida Circle of May 1924: \\"Just as architects of old created styles to harmonize with their environment, so have the architects of Florida been creating, from native motifs, a style that is carefully adapted to the climatic conditions and surroundings of the state. This style has an individuality all its own and should have a fitting name to express its origins . . . The Florida Association of Architects will give a prize of $25.00 for the name selected.\\"The Florida Circle, Jacksonville, FL, Vol. 1 No. 2, May 1924 This contest was to conclude in November 1924 and the winning name announced thereafter. Florida Southern College In 1921, Trimble created a master plan for the campus of Florida Southern College in Lakeland, based upon Thomas Jefferson's campus plan for the University of Virginia. Frank Lloyd Wright’s later design for the campus was influenced by Trimble’s concepts, especially the domed central feature which Wright translated into a water dome, finally made operational in 2008.

The first European to visit the area, in 1864, was the explorer Charles Cooke Hunt, who charted a large granite hill in the area by its Indigenous Australian name of Qualyin Hill. The meaning of the name is unknown. By 1908 the area had been settled and the local progress association requested that the government declare a townsite along the Quairading to Nunagin railway that was being proposed. The townsite was selected in 1912 due to its position near Coaring Spring and the townsite was gazetted in 1913, the same year the railway was opened. The station was initially named as Koarin but later renamed as Kwolyin. Kwolyin's State Hotel was constructed in 1914. It was destroyed by arson in February 1992.

They are the largest, most complete, and best preserved extant mausoleum complex in China.UNESCO, Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties - Nomination File, 2000, 2003, 2004 Altogether, five emperors (Shunzhi, Kangxi, Qianlong, Xianfeng, and Tongzhi), 15 empresses, 136 imperial concubines, three princes, and two princesses of the Qing dynasty are buried here. Surrounded by Changrui Mountain, Jinxing Mountain, Huanghua Mountain, and Yingfei Daoyang Mountain, the tomb complex stretches over a total area of . Description Eastern Qing Tombs in 1900 At the center of the Eastern Qing tombs lies Xiaoling, the tomb of the Shunzhi Emperor (16381661), who became the first Qing emperor to rule over China. Shunzhi was also the first emperor to be buried in the area. Buried with him are his empresses Xiaokangzhang (mother of the Kangxi Emperor) and Consort Donggo. The major tombs to the east of Shunzhi's mausoleum are Jingling (Kangxi Emperor) and Huiling (Tongzhi Emperor). To the west lie Yuling (Qianlong Emperor), Ding Dongling (Dowager Empress Cixi and Empress Ci'an), and Dingling (Xianfeng Emperor). All imperial mausolea at the Eastern Qing tombs follow a pattern established by the Xiaoling mausoleum of the Shunzhi Emperor. The basic layout consists of three sections: spirit way, palaces, and offering kitchens. Xiaoling has the most elaborate spirit way and contains the following structures (from south to north): a stone archway, eastern and western dismounting stelae, grand palace gate, hall for changing clothes, divine merit stelae pavilion, stone sculptures, dragon-and-phoenix gate, one-arch bridge, seven-arch bridge, five-arch bridge, eastern and western dismounting stelae, three-way three-arch bridges and flat bridge. The palace section of Xiaoling contains the following structures (from south to north): spirit way stela pavilion, eastern and western halls for court officials, Long'en Gate, eastern and western sacrificial burners, eastern and western side halls, Long'en Hall (; Manchu: baili be ujelere deyen), gate of the burial chamber, two-pillar gate, stone altar-pieces, square city, memorial tower, glazed screen, crescent city, precious citadel, earth mound with the underground palace underneath. The north of the palace was closed off with walls. The section of the offering kitchens was positioned to the left of the palace section, it consists of a walled compound that contains the offering kitchens proper (i.e., where the sacrificial food was cooked), the southern and northern offering warehouses, and a slaughterhouse where the oxen and sheep were butchered. Jingling is the tomb of the Kangxi Emperor, and is surprisingly modest given that he was possibly the greatest emperor of the Qing dynasty but is in keeping with what is known of his character. The spirit way leading to the tomb has an elegant five-arch bridge; the guardian figures are placed on an unusual curve quite close to the tomb itself, and are more decorated than those at earlier tombs. Yuling, the tomb of the Qianlong Emperor (the fourth emperor of the Qing dynasty), is one of the most splendid one of all royal tombs in Chinese history. Yuling has the finest tomb chamber, a series of nine vaults separated by four solid marble doors located at a depth of . Beginning with the first marble gate, all walls, vaulted ceilings, and gates are covered with Buddhist imagery such as the four heavenly kings, the eight bodhisattvas, the 24 buddhas, lions, the Eight Treasures, as well as ritual instruments and more than 30,000 words of Tibetan scripture and Sanskrit. The 3-ton doors themselves have reliefs of bodhisattvas (beings on the road to enlightenment) and the four protective kings usually found at temple entrances. The Qianlong Emperor (died 1799) selected the site of his mausoleum in 1742 and construction began in the following year. Construction was completed in 1752, but the mausoleum was expanded further in the years between 1755 and 1762. During this time, the square city, memorial tower, the precious citadel, as well as the two side halls were newly built. Ding Dongling, the tomb of Empress Dowager Cixi stands out for its extremely luxurious decoration. The Long'en Hall along with its eastern and western side halls is made from valuable red wood timbers. All three halls are decorated with gold-glazed coloured painting, gilded dragons, and carved stone rails. Today, the main hall contains reproductions of pictures produced in 1903 by Cixi's photo studio within the Summer Palace. Everywhere there are reminders of the Forbidden City, such as the terrace-corner spouts carved as water- loving dragons. The interior has motifs strikingly painted in gold on dark wood, recalling the buildings where she spent her last years. There are walls of carved and gilded brick, and superbly fearsome wooden dragons writhe down the columns. Zhaoxiling, the tomb of the Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang, the mother of the Shunzhi Emperor is located to the east of the entrance to the spirit way that leads to the tomb of Shunzhi. Xiaozhuang is believed to have played an important role in consolidating early Qing dynasty authority. The mausoleum was started as a temporary resting hall under the direction of the Kangxi Emperor, who was the grandson of Xiaozhuang and followed her wishes in making this arrangement. The temporary hall was converted into the Zhaoxiling mausoleum in 1725, during the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor. The tombs of Empress Dowager Cixi and the Qianlong Emperor were looted by troops under the command of the warlord Sun Dianying in 1928. Other tombs were looted in the 1940s and 1950s, leaving only the tomb of the Shunzhi Emperor untouched . The burial chambers of four of the tombs, namely the Qianlong Emperor, Empress Dowager Cixi and two of the Qianlong Emperor's concubines, are open to the public.

Daoguang decided to move his tomb (muling; ) to the Western Qing tombs after water seeped into the burial chamber at the original site. The already built structures were dismantled and moved to the Western Qing Tombs. Two sons and two daughters of Daoguang are buried in the Eastern Qing tombs (in the \\"Tomb of the Princess\\").

Many large anti-nuclear demonstrations and protests have occurred over the years. In May 2011, following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, Cabinet decided to ban the building of new nuclear power reactors. The country's five existing reactors would be allowed to continue operating, but \\"would not be replaced at the end of their life span\\". Early years The Swiss parliament promulgated the Nuclear Energy Act of 1959, and the first three nuclear power plants entered production between 1969 and 1972 without significant anti-nuclear mobilization. Protests started in the late 1960s, principally against a planned nuclear power plant in Kaiseraugst, a small village not far from the city of Basel. This site was to be the focal point of the Swiss anti-nuclear movement for the next two decades.Marco Giugni Social Protest and Policy Change, p. 64. A major occupation took place in 1975 in Kaiseraugst, after construction work had begun. The occupation was organized by the Non-violent Action Kaiseraugst and lasted about ten weeks, between April and June 1975. Fifteen thousand people participated. Following this, a number of other non-violent actions were formed nationwide, and mass demonstrations became national in scope. A demonstration held in Bern on 26 April 1975, attracted 18,000 people and was supported by more than 170 associations and parties. A period of intense mobilization occurred in the period from 1975 to 1981. After Chernobyl From 1986 to 1990, the Chernobyl disaster brought another peak of anti-nuclear protests in Switzerland, which \\"increased public awareness toward nuclear energy and favored the acceptance in 1990 of a federal popular initiative for a ten-year moratorium on the construction of new nuclear plants\\" (by 54.5 percent of voters, on 23 September 1990). With the exception of this ten-year moratorium, the Swiss public has rejected every referendum to ban nuclear energy since the 1970s (for instance in 1984 and 2003).Atomic energy unpopular despite widespread use Between 1979 and 2014, out of the 16 cantonal and federal votes on nuclear energy, 9 were favourable to nuclear energy and 7 were opposed to it (one moratorium accepted and six radioactive waste storage projects rejected).Bernard Wuthrich, \\"Les Suisses sont attachés au nucléaire, et hostiles aux déchets\\", Le temps, 27 November 2016 (page visited on 27 November 2016). Recent developments An emergency switch-off button of the Beznau Nuclear Power Plant. In 2011, the federal authorities decided to gradually phase out nuclear power in Switzerland. In 2008, nuclear energy provided Switzerland with 40 percent of its electricity. A survey of 1,026 Swiss people found that 7% were totally in favor of nuclear energy production, 14% were fully opposed, 33% were fairly in favor, and 38% were fairly opposed, with 8% having no opinion. One of the most contentious issues is the disposal of radioactive waste. At present, spent nuclear material is \\"kept in temporary aboveground facilities while politicians and communities wrangle about where to bury it.\\" In May 2011, following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, some 20,000 people turned out for Switzerland's largest anti-nuclear power demonstration in 25 years. Demonstrators marched peacefully near the Beznau Nuclear Power Plant, the oldest in Switzerland, which started operating in 1969. Days after the anti-nuclear rally, Cabinet decided to ban the building of new nuclear power reactors. The country's five existing reactors would be allowed to continue operating, but \\"would not be replaced at the end of their life span\\". On 27 November 2016, a referendum by the Green Party was held that would have limited the lifespan of Switzerland's nuclear plants to 45 years, and in doing so, would close the three oldest reactors in 2017: Beznau 1, Beznau 2, and Muehleberg. The referendum failed, with 54.2% of voters rejecting it. On 21 May 2017, 58 percent of Swiss voters accepted the new Energy Act establishing the energy strategy 2050 and forbidding the construction of new nuclear power plants.Energy strategy 2050, Swiss Federal Office of Energy, Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (page visited on 21 May 2017).

Although it has been rejected by scholars,Rado Lencek. 1990. \\"The Linguistic Premises of Matej Bor's Slovene-Venetic Theory.\\" Slovene Studies 12(1): 75-86;Tom Priestly. 1997. \\"Vandals, Veneti, Windischer: The Pitfalls of Amateur Historical Linguistics.\\" Slovene Studies 12(1/2): 3-41Tom Priestly. 2001. \\"Vandali, Veneti, Vindišarji: pasti amaterske historične lingvistike.\\" Slavistična revija 49:275-303. it has been an influential alternative explanation of the Slovenian ethnogenesis. During the 1980s and 1990s, it gained wide attention in Slovenia and the former Yugoslavia. A version of this theory states that most of Central Europe and portions of today's northern Turkey were originally inhabited by a single people—the Veneti—a people that were subsequently dispersed by several invasion from the North in the form of Celtic and Germanic migrations and by the push northwards of the Roman Empire. According to this variant, the Armorican Veneti, the Adriatic Veneti, the Vistula Veneti as well as portion of the Illyrians and the Veneti of northern Turkey were all related people who spoke the same or similar language. The theory also counts among the Veneti several peoples of North Spain, Northern coastal France as well as portions of Denmark, Wales and of Ireland. In this version, most of the northern Slavs as well as the Slovenes and some Croats are the last remnant the original European Veneti.  Background  The theory was advanced in the mid 1980s by a group of Slovenian authors, notably Jožko Šavli, Matej Bor and Ivan Tomažič. In a book published in 1984, the three authors proposed an alternative view on the ethnogenesis of the Slovene people: they rejected the notion that the Slovenes were descended from Slavs that settled the area in the 6th century, claiming that the ancestors of the modern Slovenes were in fact a pre-Roman people they call Veneti (which would include the Adriatic Veneti, the Baltic Veneti, the Pannonians, the Noricans and some other peoples that traditional historiography identified either as Celts or Illyrians). According to the Venetic theory, the ancient Veneti spoke a proto-Slavic language from which modern Slovene and West Slavic languages emerged. There were several similar antecedents to the Venetic theory. The priest Davorin Trstenjak (1817–1890) claimed that the Slovenes were ancient indigenous inhabitants of Slovenia and that Slavs had ruled Europe, Africa, and Asia in antiquity; however, he gave up these claims after he found they were scientifically untenable. The lawyer Henrik Tuma (1858–1935) declared that the Slovenes had been the first humans to settle Europe. The writer and journalist Franc Jeza (1916–1984) asserted that the Slovenes had Swedish origins.Skrbiš, Zlatko. 2008. \\"'The First Europeans' Fantasy of Slovenian Venetologists.\\" In: Maruška Svašek (ed.), Postsocialism: Politics and Emotion in Central and Eastern Europe, pp. 138–158. New York: Berghahn Books. Premises The Venetic theory is based on several different arguments. One is the traditional Germanic denomination of several Slavic peoples as Wends (Proto-Germanic *Wénethōz > ); this tradition has remained in the archaic German name for the Sorbs (Wenden) and Slovenes (Windischen or Winden). Some medieval chroniclers also equated ancient Veneti with Slavs. The second argument on which the theory is based are supposed Slavic (proto-Slovene) toponyms found throughout Central Europe and Northern Italy; these toponyms have been studied by Šavli. The third argument is based on the ancient Venetic inscriptions found in North-Eastern Italy and in the Slovenian Littoral, which Bor interpreted as being Slavic. Reception The Venetic theory created a great controversy in the Slovenian and Yugoslav public in the late 1980s. Several of the most prominent Slovenian historians, such as Bogo Grafenauer and Peter Štih, entered into open polemics with the creators of the theory. On the other hand, many prominent public figures publicly supported the claims advanced by the Venetic theory, among them the designer Oskar Kogoj, authors Zorko Simčič and Lucijan Vuga, and politician Zmago Jelinčič Plemeniti. In the 1990s, the theory gained institutional support of the World Slovenian Congress, publishing much of the literature advocating the theory and organizing international symposiums. The theory has also gained support in some nationalist circles. However, the theory has been challenged by certain writers, and it has been rejected by both mainstream linguists and historians.Plut-Pregelj, Leopoldina, & Carole Rogel. 2010.

Principal photography took place between 1957 and 1969. Test footage was filmed as early as 1955, second-unit photography was done as late as 1972, and Welles was working on the film intermittently until his death in 1985. The film was eventually edited by Jesús Franco and was released in 1992, to mixed reviews. Origin Don Quixote was initially conceived in 1955 as a 30-minute film for CBS entitled Don Quixote Passes By. Rather than offer a literal adaptation of the Miguel de Cervantes novel, Welles opted to bring the characters of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza into the modern age as living anachronisms. Welles explained his idea in an interview, stating: \\"My Don Quixote and Sancho Panza are exactly and traditionally drawn from Cervantes, but are nonetheless contemporary.\\"Brady, Frank. \\"Citizen Welles.\\" 1989, Charles Scribner’s Sons. Welles later elaborated to Peter Bogdanovich: \\"What interests me is the idea of these dated old virtues. And why they still seem to speak to us when, by all logic, they're so hopelessly irrelevant. That's why I've been obsessed for so long with Don Quixote … [The character] can't ever be contemporary—that's really the idea. He never was. But he's alive somehow, and he's riding through Spain even now … The anachronism of Don Quixote's knightly armor in what was Cervantes' own modern time doesn't show up very sharply now. I've simply translated the anachronism. My film demonstrates that he and Sancho Panza are eternal.\\"Jonathan Rosenbaum (ed.), Peter Bogdanovich and Orson Welles, This is Orson Welles (DaCapo Press, New York, 1992 [rev. 1998 ed.]) p.96 Welles shot color test footage in the Bois de Boulogne with Russian-born American actor Mischa Auer as Don Quixote and Russian character actor Akim Tamiroff as Sancho Panza.Joseph McBride, What Ever Happened to Orson Welles?

Barnes & Co. It was the first time Welles had filmed in color since the ill-fated production of It's All True in 1942. However, when representatives from CBS viewed unedited footage they were unhappy with Welles's concept and cancelled the project. The original color test shots with Auer were lost and are no longer believed to exist. Welles decided to expand the production into a black-and-white feature film. Welles's longtime friend Frank Sinatra invested $25,000 in the new film, with Welles providing additional self-funding derived from his work as an actor.Bogdanovich, Peter (2004). Who the Hell's in It? New York: Alfred A. Knopf. Production On June 29, 1957, after having been removed from his own film Touch of Evil, Welles headed to Mexico City to begin work on the feature-length version of Don Quixote.Jonathan Rosenbaum (ed.), Peter Bogdanovich and Orson Welles, This is Orson Welles (Da Capo Press, New York, 1992 [rev. 1998 ed.]) p.424 The part of Don Quixote had been offered to Charlton Heston, who had just finished filming Touch of Evil with Welles, and Heston was keen on playing the role, but was only available for two weeks, which Welles feared would be insufficient. Spanish actor Francisco Reiguera was cast as Don Quixote and Akim Tamiroff remained as Sancho Panza. Welles also brought in child actress Patty McCormack to play Dulcie, an American girl visiting Mexico City as the city's central framing device. During her visit, Dulcie would encounter Welles (playing himself) in a hotel lobby, on the hotel patio and in a horse-drawn carriage, and he would tell her the story of Don Quixote. She would then meet Don Quixote and Sancho Panza in the present day, and would later tell Welles of her adventures with them. Welles worked without a finished script, shooting improvised sequences on the street. Much of the footage was shot with silent 16mm equipment, with Welles planning to dub the dialogue at a later date. As the production evolved, Welles told film critic André Bazin that he saw his Don Quixote being created in the improvisational style of silent comedy films. The bulk of filming occurred in Mexico in two blocks in late 1957. The first was between early July 1957 and his return to Hollywood on 28 August, while the second was in September and October 1957. Filming in Mexico occurred in Puebla, Tepoztlán, Texcoco and Río Frio. However, Welles's production was forced to stop due to problems with financing. At this stage the project was supervised by Mexican producer Oscar Dancigers, and after Welles went over budget by some $5,000, Dancigers suspended filming, before pulling out of the project entirely. Thereafter, Welles produced the film himself.Joseph McBride, What Ever Happened to Orson Welles? A portrait of an independent career (University Press of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, 2006) pp.122, 238 Welles became preoccupied with other projects, including attempts to salvage Touch of Evil. In a bid to raise more funds, Welles threw himself into money-making assignments, acting in films including The Long, Hot Summer, Compulsion and Ferry to Hong Kong, narrating films including The Vikings and King of Kings, and directing the stage plays Five Kings and Rhinoceros When money was available, he switched the location shooting to Spain. As time went by, McCormack matured out of childhood, forcing Welles to drop her character from the film. In later years, he stated that he wished to re-film her scenes, plus some new ones, with his daughter Beatrice Welles (who had a small part in his Chimes at Midnight). However, he never did so, and by the late 1960s Beatrice also grew out of childhood. During the 1960s, Welles shot fragments of Don Quixote in Spain (Pamplona, Málaga and Seville) and Italy (Rome, Manziana and Civitavecchia) as his schedule and finances allowed; he even found time to film sequences (reported as being \\"the prologue and epilogue\\") while on vacation in Málaga commuting all the while to Paris to oversee the post- production work on his 1962 adaptation of The Trial. Welles continued to show Don Quixote and Sancho Panza in the present day, where they react with bafflement at such inventions as motor scooters, airplanes, automobiles, radio, television, cinema screens and missiles. Welles never filmed a literal version of the famous scene in which Quixote duels with windmills, he instead made a modern-day version of it in which Quixote walks into a cinema. Sancho Panza and Patty McCormack's character are seated in the audience, watching the screen in silent amazement. A battle scene plays onscreen, and Quixote mistakes this for the real thing, trying to do battle with the screen and tearing it to pieces with his sword. The production became so prolonged that Reiguera, who was seriously ailing by the end of the 1960s, asked Welles to finish shooting his scenes before his health gave out. Welles was able to complete the scenes involving Reiguera prior to the actor’s death in 1969. However, as Welles shot most of the footage silently, he seldom filmed the original actors' dialogue. He intended to dub the voices himself (as he did on many of his films, including Macbeth, Othello, The Trial and The Deep), combining his narration with his voicing all the characters, but only ever did so for some limited portions of the film. CastFrancisco Reiguera as Don Quixote *Akim Tamiroff as Sancho Panza *Patty McCormack as Dulcie *Orson Welles as Himself/Narrator Changing concept Although principal photography ended after Reiguera's death, Welles never brought forth a completed version of the film. As the years passed, he insisted that he was keen to complete the film, but it is clear that the concept changed several times. Welles stressed that unlike some of his other films, he was under no deadlines and regarded the film as \\"My own personal project, to be completed in my own time, as one might with a novel\\", since he was not contracted to any studio and had privately financed the picture himself.Filming The Trial (1981) Welles made these comments in an interview captured in this film At one point in the 1960s, Welles planned to end his version by having Don Quixote and Sancho Panza surviving an atomic cataclysm, but the sequence was never shot. As Welles deemed that principal photography was complete by 1969, it is likely that by this stage he had changed his conception of the ending. In 1972, Welles dispatched his cinematographer Gary Graver to Seville, to shoot the Holy Week procession and some inserts of windmills for the film—although this footage has since been lost.Joseph McBride, What Ever Happened to Orson Welles? A portrait of an independent career (University Press of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, 2006) p.238Wellesnet.com: ORSON WELLES’ memo to GARY GRAVER: On Filming Holy Week Procession in Seville By the early 1980s, he was looking to complete the picture as an \\"essay film\\" in the style of his F for Fake and Filming Othello, using the footage of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza to compare the values of Cervantes' Spain, Franco's Spain (when the film was set), and modern-day Spain post-Franco. Welles himself explained, \\"I keep changing my approach, the subject takes hold of me and I grow dissatisfied with the old footage. I once had a finished version where the Don and Sancho go to the Moon, but then [the United States] went to the Moon, which ruined it, so I scrapped ten reels [100 minutes]. Now I am going to make it a film essay about the pollution of old Spain. But it's personal to me.\\" However, he never filmed any of the footage necessary for this later variation. One possible explanation for the film's lack of completion was offered by Welles's comments to his friend and colleague Dominique Antoine. He told her that he could only complete Don Quixote if he one day decided not to return to Spain, since every fresh visit gave him a new perspective, with new concepts for the film.Jonathan Rosenbaum, Discovering Orson Welles (University of California Press, Berkeley and Stanford, California, 2007) p.78 At the time of his death, he was still discussing doing more filming for Don Quixote, and had produced over 1,000 pages of script for the project. The endless delay in completing the project spurred the filmmaker to consider calling the project When Are You Going to Finish Don Quixote?, referring to the question he was tired of hearing. It is unclear whether or not Welles was joking about this. Up until his death in 1985, Welles was still publicly talking about bringing the unfinished work to completion.\\"Orson Welles: An Incomplete Education,\\" Senses of Cinema Film scholars Jean-Paul Berthomé and François Thomas have called Don Quixote \\"the archetype of an unfinished Welles film, unfinished because it was unfinishable. … Welles is almost certainly alone among major filmmakers in having invented the means to allow himself to assert his full right not to show his work to the public until he judged the moment had come, even if that meant he never showed it at all.\\" Footage In May 1986, the first public exhibition of the Don Quixote footage was shown at the Cannes Film Festival. The footage consisted of 45 minutes of scenes and outtakes from the film, assembled by the archivists from the Cinémathèque Française and supervised by the director Costa-Gavras. The full surviving footage shot by Welles is split between several different locations. Oja Kodar, Welles's companion in his later years, deposited some material with the Munich Film Museum, but in the course of making Don Quijote de Orson Welles (1992) she had earlier sold much of the footage to the Filmoteca Española in Madrid, whose holdings include around 40 minutes edited and dubbed by Welles. Welles's own editing workprint is held by the Cinémathèque Française in Paris. Additional footage, including the negative, was held by Welles' editor Mauro Bonnani in Italy, and in at least one other private collection. Bonanni and Kodar battled over the negative for decades. Finally, Corte Suprema di Cassazione, Italy's highest court of appeal, ruled against Bonanni in June 2017. He was forced to surrender the negative to Kodar. 1992 version Don Quijote de Orson Welles is a 1992 version of Welles's unfinished Don Quixote edited by director Jesús Franco. In 1990, Spanish producer Patxi Irigoyen and Franco acquired the rights to some of the extant footage of the Don Quixote project. Material was provided to them by numerous sources including Oja Kodar, the Croatian actress who was Welles's mistress and collaborator in his later years, and Suzanne Cloutier, the Canadian actress who played Desdemona in Welles's film version of Othello. In his will, Welles left Kodar the rights to all his unfinished film projects (including Don Quixote) and she was keen to see it completed. She spent the late 1980s touring Europe in a camper van with her Don Quixote footage, and approached several notable directors to complete the project. All of them declined for various reasons - except Franco. Franco seemed a logical choice, as he had worked as Welles's second unit director on Chimes at Midnight. However, Irigoyen and Franco were unable to obtain the footage with McCormack, which included a scene where Don Quixote destroys a movie screen that is showing a film of knights in battle. This footage, along with all footage featuring Patty McCormack, was held by Italian film editor Mauro Bonanni (who had worked on the film in Rome in 1969), who was engaged in a legal dispute with Kodar over the rights to the film. He refused to allow its incorporation into the Irigoyen-Franco project, although he would later permit some scenes to be shown on Italian television. As a consequence of this litigation between Kodar and Bonanni, Kodar insisted that none of the footage with Patty McCormack should be used. Irigoyen and Franco faced several problems in putting the Welles footage together. Welles had worked in three different formats—35mm, 16mm and Super 16mm—which created inconsistent visual quality. The wildly varying storage conditions of this footage had further exacerbated the variable visual quality. The lack of a screenplay also hampered efforts. Welles recorded less than an hour's soundtrack where he read a narration and provided dialogue for the main characters, but the rest of the footage was silent. A new script was created by Franco and voiceover actors were brought in to fill the silence left by Welles's incomplete work, although their impressions of Welles's narration and Quixote/Sancho Panza voices were far from convincing, especially when intercut with the original recordings. Joseph McBride refers to the soundtrack of Franco's version as \\"an off-putting melange of dubbed voices.\\"Joseph McBride, What Ever Happened to Orson Welles? A portrait of an independent career (University Press of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, 2006) p.240 A further controversy was the inclusion by Franco of footage of Welles filming in Spain, taken from a documentary he had made on Spain in the 1960s. Welles had not intended to appear in the film himself, other than in its framing scenes as the narrator, and yet the Irigoyen/Franco film features several scenes with Quixote and Sancho Panza on Spanish streets, with Welles apparently looking on. Additionally, Franco inserts a windmill scene into the film, even though Welles had not filmed one or ever intended to film one - the scene relies on footage of Quixote charging across plains, interspersed with windmill images (which were not filmed by Welles), zooms and jump cuts. Furthermore, Welles feared a repetition of the experience of having the film re-edited by someone else (as had happened to him on The Magnificent Ambersons, The Stranger, The Lady from Shanghai, Macbeth, Mr. Arkadin and Touch of Evil), so he divided up all the reels of film for Don Quixote and deliberately mislabelled many of them, telling Mauro Bonanni, \\"If someone finds them, they mustn't understand the sequence, because only I know that.\\"Clinton Heylin, Despite the System: Orson Welles versus the Hollywood System (Canongate, Edinburgh, 2005) p.335 The Irigoyen and Franco work premiered at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival as Don Quixote de Orson Welles, with English- and Spanish-language versions produced. Initial reaction was predominantly negative, and this version was never theatrically released in the U.S. In September 2008, a U.S. DVD edition was released as Orson Welles' Don Quixote by Image Entertainment. The footage of Don Quixote in the cinema that is in Bonanni's possession has turned up on YouTube. Spanish film critic Juan Cobos saw a rough cut of Welles's unfinished footage (which he praised very highly), and stated that the 1992 edit by Franco bore little resemblance to it. Similarly, Jonathan Rosenbaum describes the 45 minutes of footage assembled in 1986 as being vastly superior to the Franco edit. On Don Quixote and the subject of the artist's rights over their work—particularly the right not to finish—film scholars Jean-Paul Berthomé and François Thomas wrote that \\"the so-called completed version, hastily cobbled together in 1992 by Jesús Franco … merely created a sense of regret that posterity does not always respect this right not to finish.\\" =Cast=Francisco Reiguera as Don Quixote *Jose Mediavilla as Voice of Don Quixote/Narrator (selected scenes) *Akim Tamiroff as Sancho Panza *Jan Carlos Ordonez as Voice of Sancho Panza (selected scenes) *Orson Welles as Himself/Narrator/Voice of Don Quixote/Voice of Don Quixote (selected scenes) References External links 1992 films Films with screenplays by Orson Welles Spanish films Spanish black-and-white films Films based on Don Quixote Films directed by Orson Welles 1950s unfinished films 1960s unfinished films 1970s unfinished films Self-reflexive films ","title":"Don Quixote (unfinished film)"},{"id":"19705610","text":"The 1663 Charlevoix earthquake occurred on February 5 in New France (now the Canadian province of Quebec), and was assessed to have a moment magnitude of between 7.3 and 7.9. The earthquake occurred at 5:30 p.m. local time and was estimated to have a maximum perceived intensity of X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. The main shock epicentre is suggested to have occurred along the Saint Lawrence River, between the mouth of the Malbaie River on the north and the mouth of the Ouelle River on the south. A large portion of eastern North America felt the effects. Landslides and underwater sediment slumps were a primary characteristic of the event with much of the destruction occurring near the epicentral region of the St. Lawrence estuary and also in the area of the Saguenay Graben. The event occurred during the early European settlement of North America and some of the best recorded first hand accounts were from Catholic missionaries that were working in the area. These records were scrutinized to help determine the scale of damage and estimate the magnitude of the quake in the absence of abundant records from that time period. Tectonic setting The Charlevoix Seismic Zone (CSZ) lies along the St. Lawrence River, northeast of Quebec City. Although eastern Canada has relatively infrequent earthquakes, due to its location away from active plate boundaries, the CSZ is its most active part, with five earthquakes of estimated magnitude of 6 or greater since historical records began. Focal mechanisms for earthquakes in this zone are consistent with rupture on both reverse faults and strike-slip faults of varied orientation. The main structures of the area are faults of the Saint Lawrence rift system that run parallel to the river, formed during the break-up of the supercontinent Rodinia in the late Neoproterozoic and early Paleozoic. The greatest seismicity occurs where the rift is overprinted by a ~300 Ma meteorite crater, the Charlevoix impact structure. Most CSZ earthquakes have hypocenters within the Grenvillian basement at depths between 7 and 15 km. Many of the smaller earthquakes do not appear to be located on the rift faults, but within the volumes of rock between them. Larger events lie outside the impact structure and have inferred nodal planes consistent with reactivation of the rift faults. The relatively weak impact structure is interpreted to cause a perturbation of the regional stress field, affecting the stability of the rift faults. The estimated length of the most active portion of the CSZ was and the fault area was put at . By comparison, the 7 February 1812 New Madrid event, which was thought to have taken place on the Reelfoot fault and was the largest event in that series, had a rupture zone that was less than that of the Charlevoix earthquake and caused chimney damage at distances of more than . These things together suggest that the Charlevoix earthquake was similar in size to the largest of the New Madrid earthquakes and was at least a magnitude 6.8 event. The estimation of the earthquake's intensity was based on the condition of the soil where the damage occurred. A lower magnitude range would be preferred if the soil in the area was soft and loosely compacted and a range based on firm ground or bedrock would be proportionately higher. Effects The earthquake was felt sharply in New England, though the date recorded for the event was 26 January 1663, as New England was using the Julian calendar at the time. A church record entry made by Reverend S. Danforth from Roxbury, Massachusetts (~ 600 km from the CSZ) indicated the initial shock was felt around 6 pm that evening and several more shocks followed the next morning. On the shores of Massachusetts Bay, the tops of chimneys were broken on houses and pewter (a malleable metal alloy) was jarred from shelves. This level of damage is consistent with a modified Mercalli intensity of VI though this may have been because the early colonials had the capability of producing only relatively weak mortar. Using this MMI value and the distance from the epicenter one can estimate the magnitude of the earthquake using published intensity-attenuation relations. In a June 2011 report on the earthquake that was published in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, John E. Ebel, a professor and researcher at Boston College, used these known relations that apply to earthquakes in northeastern North America and determined the magnitude to be 7.3 – 7.9. Great landslides along the Saint Lawrence, Saint-Maurice, and Batiscan Rivers made these rivers muddy after the shock, with the waters of the St. Lawrence being affected for up to one month. Near Trois-Rivières several waterfalls were transformed by these landslides, and one waterfall on the St. Maurice River near Les Grès was said to have been nearly leveled. At Saint-Jean-Vianney, Quebec, there was a large earthflow landslide in a sensitive clay, interpreted to have been caused by the 1663 earthquake. In 1971 this was the site of another much smaller earthflow that destroyed 41 houses and killed 31 people. Multibeam bathymetry data and high resolution seismic reflection data acquired in the Saguenay Fjord has been used to identify a series of landslide deposits that were probably triggered by the 1663 earthquake. The Saguenay region is the site of a geological graben and has been subject to several natural disasters since the turn of the seventeenth century. In 1996 it was the site of the largest flood in 20th-century Canadian history, which led to the investigation of the fjord bottom using bathymetric data to determine slope stability. Historical records The inhabitants of the land were the Algonquin and Iroquois people as well as several thousand French settlers. Religious groups like the Ursulines (a Roman Catholic religious institute for women) and the Augustinians left good records of the event. These groups accredited the earthquake to God as a retaliation for disobedience. Some very detailed, though inconsistent, summaries were given by several Jesuits, most notably Jérôme Lalemant who provided relatively reserved written accounts of the strong effects of the earthquake back to his superiors in Europe. Lalemant was said to have been a disciplined priest with diverse experience and following his time in Canada was brought back to France to be posted the provincial superior of the Society of Jesus. Father Charles Simon, on the other hand, was said to have limited training and some written records of his were not received as readily or without hesitation. Father Simon seemed to not be of the same mind as the bulk of the devoted, saying \\"...the Earthquake was rather a Scheme of Divine Mercy than a scourge of Justice,— especially since, in so great a confusion of affairs and perturbations of the elements, no one lost life or fortune. Fear came to all, penalty to none.\\" Aftermath Immediately after the earthquake, the missionaries, once it had become clear that no lives had been lost, regarded the earthquake not only as a timely warning to the population of New France for their sinfulness, but also as a sign of God's protection. They described it as \\"miraculous\\" rather than a disaster, regarding the date of the earthquake as particularly important, coming on the last day of the carnival, just before Mardi Gras. They were pleased to see all the colonists attending church regularly in the following days and that even the traffickers in wine and brandy appeared to repent. These effects were short-lived and Lalemant and other missionaries were soon left wishing for another great earthquake to help them in their cause.

It is the only species in the family Neoceratidae, and is unique amongst the deep-sea anglerfish in lacking an illicium and esca (the \\"fishing rod\\" and \\"lure\\"), and in having large teeth placed on the outside of its jaws.Pietsch, Theodore W. (2005). Neoceratias spinifer. Needlebeard Seadevils. Version 6 November 2005 (under construction). Tree of Life Web Project. Description Adult female toothed seadevils have slender, elongate bodies up to long. They are dark red- brown to black in color, with naked skin. The mouth is large and extends well past the small eye; the jaws have an inner row of short, straight, widely spaced, immobile teeth. On the outside of the jaws, there are prominent conical outgrowths that bear 2-3 straight teeth, the longest of which reach almost 15% the length of the entire body. Each of these teeth is hinged at the base, with well-developed musculature and a tiny hook at the end. The illicium, or lure, is absent, along with the trough in which it rests in other deep-sea anglerfishes. There are a pair of prominent nasal papillae on the snout; nostrils and olfactory lamellae are absent. Both the males and larvae differ from other deep-sea anglerfish in having slender bodies. Mature males are only known from parasitic specimens already attached to the females. The largest known specimen is 18 mm long. They are lighter in color than the females and have semitranslucent skin. They are attached to the females by outgrowths of the snout and lower jaw; the olfactory organs are absent and the eyes are degenerate and covered with skin. The larvae are 4–10 mm long, with well-developed olfactory organs and no sexual dimorphism. Biology With no bioluminescent lure and an unusual tooth arrangement, it is unclear what the toothed seadevil feeds upon and how. It has been suggested that their external jaw teeth serve to entangle soft-bodied invertebrates. The males are fully parasitic, using tooth-bearing denticles at the tips of their jaws to attach to the female and their tissues and blood vessels becoming fused with that of the female.

History  After the success of the first Viña del Mar International Song Festival in 1960, it was decided to replace the stage with a more stable one. In 1963 the architect Hernando López began the construction of the venue, which would be a wood structure that was like an \\"acoustic shell\\" that helped the artist to project the sound to the audience and to protect the artists from the elements. In 2002 the amphitheater was renovated by replacing the wooden shell structure with a concrete structure. This structure is the one that is currently standing. With this renovation, the capacity of the amphitheater was upgraded from 15,000 to 20,000 (which is the current capacity).

Crippled at 14 months, he was freed in 1842, and founded a school after the Civil War for the education of 'Negro' children in Westminster, Maryland. What we know of his life comes from biographies published late in his life, census data from the time, and newspaper accounts of his book tour and lectures, until his death in Sheffield in 1888. Early slave life Lewis Charlton was born in 1814 on a farm in Frederick County, Maryland. The farm was located near Frederick and Point of Rocks, Maryland, around the township of Buckiston. His mother and father were both slaves. His father was sold shortly after the child's birth to a man living in Georgia. Charlton's first owner was Ignatius Davis who owned Charlton's mother. Davis' wife treated her slaves with severity. She whipped them until they passed out, then would wash their wounds with salt water, and have them return to work in the fields by the next day. At two weeks of age, Davis's wife forced his mother to leave him alone all day, while she worked for her mistress. For some 14 months, she locked Lewis in the slave quarters early each morning until late each night without food, water, companionship, or clothing. Reportedly, on one cold day he kicked his blankets away from his feet, and when his mother returned she found her son's feet had frozen. Although she replaced the blanket, his toes froze that night and fell off with the blanket the next morning. Thus crippled, he did not begin working until the age of six. When Charlton was seven, Davis died and Lewis was placed on the auction block for sale. He retells that his mother was crying and had him remove his socks to reveal his stumps, in hopes that no one would buy him. Lewis was sold to a man who intended to teach him to be a cooper, but before he could begin learning the trade, his new master's wife died and he was sold again. He was sold to a Mr. Fornistock who was mean, particularly when he was drunk. Fornistock was a tanner by trade. He had Charlton spread hides that were so heavy he was in danger of falling into the vats. If that occurred he was whipped with a cow whip and Lewis tells that it happened so frequently that he spent months where he could not sleep on his back. Eventually Fornistock's land, including Lewis were sold at a Sheriff's sale. Slave sale, Market House in the town square of Easton, Maryland The new owner Mr. Getinger, expected Lewis to work at all hours of the day, and every day of the week. Prior to being sold to Mr. Getinger, Lewis was able to visit his mother and sister on Sunday, but he was now expected to work every day including Sundays. After three years with Getinger, Charlton's legs had frozen stiff while cutting logs in the deep snows. Thinking Lewis might die, he was returned to his mother, who was now freed and living nearby as a laundress. Subsequently he was unable to walk for nine months, but once he was mobile he was sold immediately to a James Davis. Charlton was still only 15 years old. As Davis' slave, Lewis endured three years of field labor. His legs were damaged to the point that they bled frequently into his shoes. Three years later, Charlton was sold to a Mr. Richardson. For the first time in his life he was separated from his sister, with whom he had been fortunate to stay with. Charlton remained with Richardson until he was 28 years old. Emancipation At age 28 he received his manumission from his owner; however, unsure of his future, he chose to live with a stonecutter named George Burroughs. A year later, Charlton moved to Hartford County, Maryland. Here Charlton worked with Isaac Rogers, a large iron manufacturer. Charlton found that he was treated as badly as he had been while a slave, but he continued his employment with Rogers for 16 years. He then moved to the home of William Gladding. He worked as a farmhand for three years, earning a wage of $16 a month, which included the cost of housing. Charlton continued working for Gladding until his marriage. Gladding owed Charlton $235 which he was unable to secure, despite an attempt to sue for his wages in court. Charlton was forced to return to work. In 1862 Lewis moved to a town named Westminster, Maryland, where he worked as a mason.  Personal life  Lewis' father was Manuel Charlton and from the tales told by his mother in one biography, Manuel was brought over from Africa on a slave ship and was sold on to Georgia while Lewis was still a babe; but in the other, they were both, 'born slaves.' When Lewis was about 17 years of age, his mother, who had remarried after gaining her freedom, moved to Pennsylvania and not long after, his sister was sold off and moved far away; neither were heard from again. According to census records, by 1850, Lewis married Mary and they lived in Hartford County, Maryland. In 1853 they had a daughter, Martha, and a son, Edward, born in 1856. Later they moved to Westminster in Carroll County, Maryland and Mary worked as a cook at Western Maryland College after it opened in 1867.  African American school  By the time the American Civil War was over, Charlton, who was illiterate, wanted to educate the young black youth in the surrounding area. Lacking the funds to build a school, he travelled to Baltimore to raise money. In Baltimore he had a cold reception, so in 1866 he traveled to Boston to raise funds. Here he acquired nearly $1,000 and a teacher, named Mr. Whitmore, who was willing to travel to Westminster and teach black children. Finally Charlton established the first African American schoolhouse and church in Westminster. The school prospered for four years; for two years with Whitmore as teacher, and for two years with a woman named Mary Cleveland as teacher. When Charlton's funds were depleted he attempted to raise more but he was unsuccessful. At that point in 1870, the school was closed and it would not be until 1872, that free public schools were mandated for Negro children. These African American schools were to be under the control of the existing county and district boards which already had major issues in the adequate education of white children. It would not be until 1955 that schools in Maryland would be forced to start the process of integration with Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 and this process was not completed until 1967 with mixed success.

Military humor portrays a wide range of characters and situations in the armed forces. It comes in a wide array of cultures and tastes, making use of burlesque, cartoons, comic strips, double entendre, exaggeration, jokes, parody, gallows humor, pranks, ridicule and sarcasm. Military humor often comes in the form of military jokes or \\"barracks jokes\\". Military slang, in any language, is also full of humorous expressions; the term \\"fart sack\\" is military slang for a cotton mattress cover that completely contains a \\"rack\\" or thin mattress. Barrack humor also often makes use of dysphemism, such as the widespread usage of \\"shit on a shingle\\" for chipped beef. Certain military expressions, like friendly fire, are a frequent source of satirical humor. Notable cartoonists of military humor include Bill Mauldin, Dave Breger, George Baker, Shel Silverstein and Vernon Grant. Military jokesMilitary jokes might be sometimes quite blunt, e.g. British soldiers used to make a joke about the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) military decoration, to say of a comrade wounded down the belly that he had received DSO, DSO meaning \\"Dickie Shot Off.\\" *In other jokes however, the lack of seriousness is more subtle. Often these are in-jokes and not everyone understands them; e.g., the following reference to \\"Camouflage Uniform Wear Policies\\":Rod Powers Camouflage Uniform Wear Policies in the US military Marines: Work uniform, to be worn only during training and in field situations. Army: Will wear it anytime, anywhere. Navy: Will not wear camouflage uniforms, they do not camouflage you on a ship. (Ship Captains will make every effort to attempt to explain this to sailors.) Air Force: Will defeat the purpose of camouflage uniforms by putting blue and silver chevrons and colorful squadron patches all over them. *Cadences often contain humorous lyrics, or can be modified to be humorous. Examples: My girl's got big ol' hips / Just like two battleships... They say that in the Army, the biscuits are mighty fine / One rolled off the table, and killed a friend of mine... *Sometimes the joke is made by civilians about the military. In the Philippines during President Ferdinand Marcos martial law years, Chief of the Armed Forces General Fabian Ver was a feared figure. In the midst of the tense times, Filipino people used to joke that the general was so fiercely loyal that if Marcos would have ordered him to jump out of the window, General Ver would have saluted and said, \\"Which floor, sir?\\"Ken Kashiwahara Aquino's Final Journey. The New York Times 1983 Comic strips The best-known comic strip about military life is Mort Walker's long-run Beetle Bailey, set in a United States Army military post where a number of inept characters are stationed. Also notable are George Baker's Sad Sack and Dave Breger's Private Breger. When Roy Crane created the Buz Sawyer Sunday strip, he put the emphasis not on Sawyer but on his comedic sidekick Sweeney.Famous Artists and Writers, King Features Syndicate, 1949. Half Hitch, Hank Ketcham's strip of Navy humor, was distributed by King Features Syndicate from 1970 to 1975. Maximillian Uriarte's Terminal Lance began in 2010 and continues to run online and in the Marine Corps Times. Military humor in comic books includes the All Select Comics comic book feature \\"Jeep Jones\\" by Chic Stone.Jeep Jones Films Among the oldest military comedies in film are the Flagg and Quirt films. Comedy films about World War II include Buck Privates (1941), Stalag 17 (1953), Mr. Roberts (1955), Kelly's Heroes (1970) and Catch-22 (1970). The film Forrest Gump (1994) offers a glimpse of military humor when portraying Gump as a soldier in training and later fighting in Vietnam. Television Some comedies, like the Don't Call Me Charlie (1962–63) TV series (about a young veterinarian drafted into the Army and stationed in Paris), are totally devoted to the military theme. The fourth series of the British sitcom Blackadder, known as Blackadder Goes Forth, revolves around the life of Edmund Blackadder in the trenches of World War I. Books Ballantine Books published Shel Silverstein's 1956 collection of cartoons from Pacific Stars and Stripes. Notable books include Shel Silverstein's Grab Your Socks (1956), Jaroslav Hašek's The Good Soldier Švejk (1923) and Catch-22 by Joseph Heller. Reader's Digest's Humor in Uniform (1963) is a collection of short true anecdotes depicting amusing experiences in the armed forces. In 1941, according to editor Harold Hersey, there were about 350 Army camp newspapers. Three years later, when they had expanded to \\"hundreds and hundreds\\", he compiled his collection of camp newspapers cartoons, More G.I. Laughs (1944).Hersey, Harold. More G.I. Laughs, 1944. In 2002, Hyperion published Kilroy Was Here: The Best American Humor from World War II by Charles Osgood. Publishers Weekly reviewed: :Originating as a chalked inspection notice in a Quincy, Mass., shipyard, the sketch of bald- headed Kilroy launched a thousand ships and eventually became the most familiar globe-trotting graffiti of World War II... Osgood has assembled a barrage of WWII's amusing essays, stories, jokes, cartoons, poems and short satires. Selections range from heavy artillery (Reader's Digest's \\"Humor in Uniform\\" and Bob Hope's I Was There) to the small-arms fire of lesser-known writers. The opening salvo, \\"A Dictionary of Military Slang: 1941-1944\\" (compiled from Harold Hersey's More G.I. Laughs and Paris Kendall's Gone with the Draft), is followed by a parade of thematic chapters. Drinking from the same canteens, Osgood repeatedly excerpts from the same handful of mid-1940s publications. Oddly, he ignores the great Dave Breger of the Army weekly Yank, who coined the term G.I. Joe for a cartoon series so popular it ran simultaneously in that outlet and in American newspapers. Osgood offers a half-dozen of Bill Mauldin's famed Willie and Joe cartoons but only a single George Baker Sad Sack strip and one cartoon by the stylish Irwin Caplan, a prolific contributor to the slick postwar magazines.Publishers Weekly, 2001. Magazines Widely circulated on military bases during the 1950s, Charley Jones Laugh Book was an outgrowth of earlier military humor publications. During World War II, Jones sold Latrine Gazette on Army bases, so successful that he recycled the material into another publication, HEADliners, aimed at Navy men, and then launched Charley Jones Laugh Book as a nationally distributed magazine in 1943. Captain Billy's Whiz Bang began in a similar fashion after World War I.  Humour in the former South African Defence Force Military humour in the SADF was to be found less in jokes than in humorous expressions and comments. It is sometimes difficult to express their force, since most of it is in Afrikaans, and the play on words does not always translate into English without explanation. SADF humour can be very vulgar, but is never blasphemous. It often comes from the mouths of Instructor Corporals addressing trainees: *”Moenie vir my loer nie, ek is nie 'n hoer nie!” (rhyming) – “Don't look at me (like that), I'm not a whore!” *”As my vrou net kon sien hoe jy my aankyk, sou sy jou oë uitkrap!” – “If my wife could only see you looking at me like that, she'd scratch your eyes out!” *”As jy so stadig fok as wat jy aantrek, sal jy nooit pa word nie!” – “If you fuck as slowly as you dress, you'll never become a father!” (To a conscript who fell in late for early morning PT). *”Ek sal jou oog uitsuig en dit voor jou uitspoeg sodat jy self kan sien watse groot poes is jy!” – “I'll suck out your eye and spit it out in front of you so that you can see for yourself what a great cunt you are!” Plays on words were also popular, for example: *“Kaptein” (Captain) became “Kaktein” which translated neatly into English as “Craptain.” *A 2nd Lieutenant, who wore one pip on each shoulder and was usually a National Serviceman, was known as a “plastic pip (pp).” *In Pretoria, there is a street called “Proes Straat”, where a number of important military buildings were located. “Proes” means to splutter in Afrikaans, but if the “r” is removed the resulting word is the Afrikaans equivalent of the American slang “pussy”. Thus Proes Straat was jokingly referred to in English as “Crunt Street”. *Soldiers on permanent light duty, classified G3 or G4, were known as “Siekes, lammes en dooies” (\\"Sick, lame and dead ones”) or “Ligte vrugte” (\\"Light fruit\\"). This last expression is rhyming. It is a twisting of \\"light duty\\" in Afrikaans. Apart from the \\"light\\" allusion, it has no actual significant meaning. Like any other army, there were also standard slang terms for equipment and uniforms: *The large duffle-type bag in which a soldier carried his kit was known as a “balsak” (ball-bag); *A knife, fork and spoon- set was dubbed a “pikstel” (pecking-set – army meal portions could be quite small during Basic Training); *A ”pisvel” (lit. “pissing skin”) was a mattress cover; *“Skrapnel” (shrapnel) referred to overboiled, diced frozen vegetables; *\\"Ballas bak\\" (lit. “baking balls”) referred to sun-tanning during periods of inactivity on the SWA/Namibia Border; *A “pislelie” was a broad, funnel-shaped tube set into the ground for urinating, on the same Border; *A “go-kart” was a portable toilet seat with a lid, also for the Border. Anything up to ten were placed in double rows within a single, hessian surrounded enclosure with no individual privacy, hence the reference to go-kart races. The various corps had humorously insulting names for each other. Amongst others: *“Vleisbomme” (meat bombs) were paratroopers; *\\"Kanondonkies\\" (cannon donkeys) were the Artillery; *\\"Bebliksemde donkies\\" (lightning-struck, i.e. crazy, donkeys) referred to the Technical Services Corps, whose badge was a rearing silver stallion in front of a golden lightning bolt; *Infantry wore a golden Springbok head on their berets. This led them to be called \\"bokkop\\" (buckhead), a not too subtle reference to the Afrikaans word \\"fokop\\" (\\"fuck- up\\"); *The Air Force were known as \\"budgies\\" after their eagle symbol; *The Administrative Services Corps (ASC) was the Administratiewe Dienskorps in Afrikaans. Its abbreviation, ADK, gave rise to the nickname \\"Altyd Deur die Kak\\" (\\"Always in the shit\\"); *Later, when the ASC was split up and its beret colour changed from blue to an odd yellowish brown, the new colour was described as \\"kapoen\\", a telescoping of the Afrikaans words \\"kak\\" and \\"pampoen\\" (shit and pumpkin). There were also soft-covered cartoon books satirizing army life. An example is one based on the old SADF adage, “There are only two sizes in the SADF; too big and too small.” It shows a squad of new recruits, all wearing uniforms and boots far too big or small. In the middle is a soldier with perfectly fitting gear. The Corporal is shouting at him: “What’s the matter with you, soldier? How come everything fits so perfectly?”  Brazil in World War II  thumb The Brazilian dictatorship of Getúlio Vargas was known for its unwillingness to get more deeply involved in the Allied war effort. By early 1943 a popular saying was: \\"It's more likely for a snake to smoke a pipe, than for the BEF to go the front and fight.\\" (\\"Mais fácil uma cobra fumar um cachimbo, do que a FEB embarcar para o combate.\\"). FEB's participation in World War II . Brazilian Army Retrieved July 31, 2007 Before the FEB entered combat, the expression \\"a cobra vai fumar\\" (\\"the snake will smoke\\") was often used in Brazil in a context similar to \\"when pigs fly\\". As a result, the soldiers of the FEB called themselves Cobras Fumantes (literally, Smoking Snakes) and wore a divisional shoulder patch that showed a snake smoking a pipe. It was also common for Brazilian soldiers to write on their mortars, \\"The Snake is smoking ...\\" (\\"A cobra está fumando...\\"). After the war the meaning was reversed, signifying that something will definitively happen and in a furious and aggressive way. With that second meaning the use of the expression \\"a cobra vai fumar\\" has been retained in Brazilian Portuguese until the present, although few of the younger generations realize the origin of the expression.

When cooled and removed, the space occupied by the mandrel creates the hole through the bead. * Marver, a tool used in glassblowing A marver is a large flat table. The glass piece is rolled across is surface. It is used to not only shape the glass, but to remove heat as well. The rapid absorption of heat by the marver creates a stronger skin (surface tension) than the use of a wooden tool.

Power was hanged for the murder of William Keen, a justice of the peace in St. John's, Newfoundland. The crime Power, her husband Robert Power, and seven other men were convicted of murdering Keen in a burglary attempt of Keen's summer home on 9 September 1754. There had been ten accomplices who initially broke into Keen's house and stole a chest and some silver spoons. When the chest was found to contain only alcohol, Eleanor Power and one of the male accomplices left the scene.Greenwood and Boissery, p. 26.McCarthy, p. 44. The eight who remained behind decided to make another burglary attempt. When Keen awoke in his bed during the second attempt, he was beaten by two of the accomplices with a scythe and the butt of a musket. Keen died of his injuries on 29 September 1754.Greenwood and Boissery, pp. 26–27. Trial and execution On 8 October 1754, nine of the accomplices, including Eleanor Power, were brought to trial for murder before the Court of Oyer and Terminer of Newfoundland.Greenwood and Boissery, p. 31. The tenth accomplice, Nicholas Tobin, was the only Crown witness against the nine defendants. Undefended by lawyers, the nine defendants were convicted of murder by a jury after 30 minutes of deliberation and sentenced to death by hanging.Greenwood and Boissery, pp. 31–32. Two of the male accomplices were executed on 10 October 1754; the following day, Eleanor and Robert Power followed and became the first married couple to hang together in present-day Canada.Greenwood and Boissery, p. 34. Eleanor Power was also the first non- Native American woman to be executed by British authorities in present-day Canada.Greenwood and Boissery, p. 34. After years of imprisonment in St. John's, the five remaining defendants were eventually pardoned on condition that they leave Newfoundland and never return. Modern analysis Modern commentators have suggested that Eleanor Power might have escaped execution had she been represented by a qualified lawyer at her trial.Greenwood and Boissery, p. 35. This is because while Power could have legitimately been convicted of burglary, she was likely not guilty of murder since she had abandoned the conspirators after the first break-in and played no role in Keen's death.Greenwood and Boissery, p. 36. The same commentators have also suggested that the court that convicted the nine defendants was illegally constituted because the English law that governed the Colony of Newfoundland mandated that capital trials for offences committed in Newfoundland had to be tried by courts in England.Greenwood and Boissery, pp. 29–31, 35–36, citing King William's Act, 10&11 Wm.

Her owner was Orient Line, which operated her between Britain and Australia 1937–39, and also as a cruise ship. The Admiralty then requisitioned her and had her converted into a troopship. In 1942 the attacked her off South Africa. Orcades crew and gunners fought to fend off the submarine and save their ship, and it took U-172 two and a half hours and seven torpedoes to sink her. Orcades Master, Charles Fox, was decorated by the Crown and Lloyd's of London for his bravery and leadership. Civilian service Orcades is the Latin name for the Orkney Islands. She was the second of two sister ships; having been completed in July 1935. At each, Orion and Orcades were the two largest liners in Orient Line's fleet. Each had a speed of . The New Zealand-born modernist architect Brian OʼRorke designed the interiors of both ships. Orion and Orcades were registered in London and their homeport was Tilbury. Their route took them via Gibraltar, Palma, Toulon, Naples, Port Said, Suez, Aden, Colombo, Fremantle, Adelaide and Sydney to Brisbane. When not operating their liner route, Orion and Orcades provided cruises to Scandinavia, the Baltic Sea, Mediterranean, Adriatic Sea and Atlantic islands. Loss On 9 October 1942 Orcades left Cape Town for Liverpool carrying 741 passengers, 3,000 tons of general cargo and 2,000 bags of mail. She was making about , and zigzagging to make her harder attack. On 10 October at 10:28 hrs she was about south-west of the Cape Town when , commanded by Kapitänleutnant Carl Emmermann, hit her port side with two torpedoes: one forward in her no. 1 and 2 holds and the other aft in her no. 6 hold. Her steering gear and port engine were disabled but she remained afloat, so most of her crew and passengers were able to prepare to abandon ship. At 10:45 hrs U-172 hit her amidships with a third torpedo and she began to settle in the water, on an even keel but slightly down by the bow. She continued to make way with her starboard engine, and despite a heavy sea launched 20 lifeboats. One capsized but its occupants were rescued. Another became swamped; drifted away and its occupants were not seen again. A skeleton crew of 56 men remained aboard to try to save the ship, although she was making only and running in circles. At 10:54 hrs U-172 fired a fourth torpedo but it missed. Orcades engineers restarted her port engine, her speed increased to and by steering with her screws she started to make for the coast. Warrant Officer Peter Victor Waddell standing on the deck of the Polish steamer Narwik, which rescued him and others after the SS Orcades was torpedoed. U-172 surfaced in order to increase speed and overtake her, but Orcades gunners opened fire and the submarine had to dive again. At 12:49, 12:50 and 12:54 hrs U-172 hit the ship with three more torpedoes on her starboard side, breaking her back. She listed heavily to starboard and sank at about 13:00 hrs. 55 of her skeleton crew abandoned ship by launching her last four lifeboats and her liferafts, but her Chief Engineer, William Johnston, went down with the ship. A total of 45 people were lost. U-172 remained at periscope depth but shortly afterwards an Allied aircraft attacked her and drove her away, which prevented her from questioning survivors. Orcades had transmitted distress signals, and the destroyers and were sent in response. En route the destroyers encountered and engaged another submarine, , but after she crash-dived they broke off the engagement to continue to Orcades. A few hours after the liner's sinking a Polish merchant ship, Gdynia America Line's , reached Orcades boats. Despite the risk of further submarine attack, Narwik spent several hours rescuing 1,022 survivors and searching for three missing lifeboats until 03:30 hrs on 11 October. She then made for the South African coast, and after 10 hours Nizam and Foxhound joined her and escorted her into port. Orcades Master, Captain Charles Fox, was made a CBE and awarded Lloyd's War Medal for Bravery at Sea. Narwik Master, Captain Czeslaw Zawada, awarded Lloyd's War Medal for Bravery at Sea.

He was a founding member of Todd Rundgren's band, Todd Rundgren's Utopia, and later became a solo recording artist, bandleader and songwriter. He released two solo recordings, and his songs have been covered by artists as wide ranging as Johnny Winter, Carly Simon, James Cotton, Thelma Houston, Eric Clapton, Barry Manilow and Guns N' Roses. He played on stage with Jimi Hendrix, Chuck Berry, Luther Vandross, Lou Reed, Jeff Beck and Allan Woody & Warren Haynes of the Allman Brothers and Gov't Mule. Other than Rundgren, his longest musical association may have been with Bette Midler, whom he served as band leader and who adopted for her signature song \\"(You Gotta Have) Friends\\", composed by Klingman and William \\"Buzzy\\" Linhart. Life and career \\"Moogy\\" Klingman's nickname was not from the Moog synthesizer, pronounced \\"Mogue\\", but from his baby sister's pronunciation of \\"Marky\\" as \\"Moo-Gee.\\" His nickname was already well established by the time that he did later play the instrument. Klingman grew up in the Long Island suburb of Great Neck, New York. By age 10 he was collecting comic books and gramophone records, playing DJ in his basement. Through his older sister, he got an access pass to attend the 1965 Newport Folk Festival performance where Bob Dylan \\"went electric,\\" meeting Dylan before and after the concert. Back home, his band The Living Few was signed to a demo deal by producer Dick Glass and recorded a demo of Dylan songs and original tunes. At 16, he joined Jimmy James and the Blue Flames with Jimi Hendrix and Randy California. His jug band performance with schoolmate Andy Kaufman in a controversial civil rights concert resulted in his expulsion from high school in 1966, after which he went to Quintano's School for Young Professionals in New York City. By then, his band Glitterhouse had made records with the star producer Bob Crewe, as well as Crewe's soundtrack to the 1968 Roger Vadim film Barbarella with Jane Fonda. Klingman's association with Todd Rundgren commenced in 1968 when they met outside the Cafe Au Go Go in Greenwich Village. In Klingman's Manhattan loft, he and Rundgren constructed the Secret Sound recording studio where Rundgren produced his A Wizard, A True Star, Todd, and other albums. Moogy was the original keyboardist for Todd Rundgren's Utopia, and Klingman's band Moogy & the Rhythm Kings (Kevin Ellman, Ralph Schuckett, John Seigler) formed the core of the original Utopia. He played on ten Todd Rundgren solo albums, as well as several Utopia albums. When Lou Reed found himself in 1972 with an acclaimed album, Transformer, but no backing musicians to support it on tour, he tried hiring an inexperienced bar band called The Tots, but ultimately fired them mid-tour. With barely a week's notice, Klingman came up with a new five-member backing band, and completed the tour. The band consisted of Tom Cosgrove on lead guitar, Ralph Schuckett on rhythm guitar, \\"Buffalo\\" Bill Gelber on bass and \\"Chocolate\\" on drums. Klingman played keyboards and produced Bette Midler's duet with Bob Dylan \\"Buckets of Rain\\" – which appeared on Midler's 1976 album, Songs for the New Depression. He became her musical director, taking over from Barry Manilow. Klingman collaborated with William \\"Buzzy\\" Linhart in co-writing \\"(You Gotta Have) Friends\\", which became Bette Midler's de facto theme song. Klingman had solo albums out on Capitol and EMI records, as well as on his own label. Songs from his solo albums were covered by Johnny Winter, Eric Clapton, Barry Manilow, Bette Midler, Todd Rundgren and others. His song \\"Dust in the Wind\\" (not to be confused with the hit song of the same name by Kansas) was covered by Todd Rundgren on his album Something/Anything? and has been performed live in concert by Guns N' Roses. In 1985 Klingman helped the group Mandolindley Road Show mix and master their debut self-titled album. He mentored the late, influential hip-hop producer Paul C., who was a member of the band. Klingman became the executive producer and musical director of the Music From Free Creek \\"supersession\\" project when Rundgren's agent Albert Grossman wanted too much money on his behalf, and Rundgren passed the job on to his friend. The sessions featured the participation of Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Keith Emerson, Mitch Mitchell, Harvey Mandel and Linda Ronstadt.Interview with Moogy Klingman by I.C. Timerow, 2001; www.moogymusic.com. Klingman also performed live at many venues with various groups, playing for Chuck Berry, Jimi Hendrix, Buzzy Linhart and then in the 1990s, with members of the Allman Brothers/Gov't Mule, and a summer tour with Bo Diddley. He was the co-founder of the band The Peaceniks, along with Barry Gruber. Klingman also played in the Moogy/Woody Band with Allman Brothers alumni Allan Woody, and Warren Haynes. In 1979 he had a show on Manhattan Cable Channel J called \\"Manhattan Alley\\". A benefit concert was held in January 2011, to help pay Klingman's medical expenses, and saw the original Todd Rundgren's Utopia, featuring Ralph Schuckett, Kevin Ellman, John Siegler and Klingman, reunite on stage for the first time in over thirty years. Klingman died of bladder cancer in New York City on November 15, 2011, at the age of 61.

Animals with \\"dumb\\" rabies appear depressed, lethargic, and uncoordinated. Gradually they become completely paralyzed. When their throat and jaw muscles are paralyzed, the animals will drool and have difficulty swallowing. Rabies is a viral zoonotic neuroinvasive disease which causes inflammation in the brain and is usually fatal. Rabies, caused by the rabies virus, primarily infects mammals. In the laboratory it has been found that birds can be infected, as well as cell cultures from birds, reptiles and insects.\\"CARTER John, SAUNDERS Venetia - Virology : Principles and Applications – Page:175 – 2007 – John Wiley & Sons Ltd, The Atrium, Southern Gate, Chichester, West Sussex PO19 8SQ, England – 978-0-470-02386-0 (HB)\\" Animals with rabies suffer deterioration of the brain and tend to behave bizarrely and often aggressively, increasing the chances that they will bite another animal or a person and transmit the disease. Most cases of humans contracting the disease from infected animals are in developing nations. In 2010, an estimated 26,000 people died from rabies, down from 54,000 in 1990.  Stages of disease  Three stages of rabies are recognized in dogs and other animals. # The first stage is a one- to three-day period characterized by behavioral changes and is known as the prodromal stage. # The second stage is the excitative stage, which lasts three to four days. It is this stage that is often known as furious rabies due to the tendency of the affected animal to be hyperreactive to external stimuli and bite at anything near. # The third stage is the paralytic or dumb stage and is caused by damage to motor neurons. Incoordination is seen due to rear limb paralysis and drooling and difficulty swallowing is caused by paralysis of facial and throat muscles. This disables the host's ability to swallow, which causes saliva to pour from the mouth. This causes bites to be the most common way for the infection to spread, as the virus is most concentrated in the throat and cheeks, causing major contamination to saliva. Death is usually caused by respiratory arrest.  Mammals  = Bats = Bat-transmitted rabies occurs throughout North and South America but it was first closely studied in Trinidad in the West Indies. This island was experiencing a significant toll of livestock and humans alike to rabid bats. In the 10 years from 1925 and 1935, 89 people and thousands of livestock had died from it—“the highest human mortality from rabies-infected bats thus far recorded anywhere.”Goodwin and Greenhall (1961), p. 196 In 1931, Dr. Joseph Lennox Pawan of Trinidad in the West Indies, a government bacteriologist, found Negri bodies in the brain of a bat with unusual habits. In 1932, Dr. Pawan discovered that infected vampire bats could transmit rabies to humans and other animals.Pawan (1936), pp. 137-156.Pawan, J.L. (1936b). \\"Rabies in the Vampire Bat of Trinidad with Special Reference to the Clinical Course and the Latency of Infection.\\" Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology. Vol. 30, No. 4. December, 1936. In 1934, the Trinidad and Tobago government began a program of eradicating vampire bats, while encouraging the screening off of livestock buildings and offering free vaccination programs for exposed livestock. After the opening of the Trinidad Regional Virus Laboratory in 1953, Arthur Greenhall demonstrated that at least eight species of bats in Trinidad had been infected with rabies; including the common vampire bat, the rare white-winged vampire bat, as well as two abundant species of fruit bats: the Seba's short-tailed bat and the Jamaican fruit bat.Greenhall, Arthur M. 1961. Bats in Agriculture. Ministry of Agriculture, Trinidad and Tobago. Recent data sequencing suggests recombination events in an American bat led the modern rabies virus to gain the head of a G-protein ectodomain thousands of years ago. This change occurred in an organism that had both rabies and a separate carnivore virus. The recombination resulted in a cross-over that gave rabies a new success rate across hosts since the G-protein ectodomain, which controls binding and pH receptors, was now suited for carnivore hosts as well. = Cats = In the United States, domestic cats are the most commonly reported rabid animal. In the U.S., , between 200 and 300 cases are reported annually; in 2017, 276 cats with rabies were reported. , in every year since 1990, reported cases of rabies in cats outnumbered cases of rabies in dogs. Cats that have not been vaccinated and are allowed access to the outdoors have the most risk for contracting rabies, as they may come in contact with rabid animals. The virus is often passed on during fights between cats or other animals and is transmitted by bites, saliva or through mucous membranes and fresh wounds. The virus can incubate from one day up to over a year before any symptoms begin to show. Symptoms have a rapid onset and can include unusual aggression, restlessness, lethargy, anorexia, weakness, disorientation, paralysis and seizures. Vaccination of felines (including boosters) by a veterinarian is recommended to prevent rabies infection in outdoor cats. = Cattle = In cattle-raising areas where vampire bats are common, fenced-in cows often become a primary target for the bats (along with horses), due to their easy accessibility compared to wild mammals. In Latin America, vampire bats are the primary reservoir of the rabies virus, and in Peru, for instance, researchers have calculated that over 500 cattle per year die of bat- transmitted rabies. Vampire bats have been extinct in the U.S. for thousands of years (a situation that may reverse due to climate change, as the range of vampire bats in northern Mexico has recently been creeping northward with warmer weather), thus U.S. cattle are not currently susceptible to rabies from this vector. However, cases of rabies in dairy cows in the U.S. has occurred (perhaps transmitted by bites from canines), leading to concerns that humans consuming unpasteurized dairy products from these cows could be exposed to the virus. Vaccination programs in Latin America have been effective at protecting cattle from rabies, along with other approaches such as the culling of vampire bat populations. = Coyotes = Rabies is common in coyotes, and can be a cause for concern if they interact with humans. = Dogs = An image from 1566 depicting a group of men using an assortment of weapons to try and kill a rabid dog who is biting one of the men on the leg. Rabies has a long history of association with dogs. The first written record of rabies is in the Codex of Eshnunna (ca. 1930 BC), which dictates that the owner of a dog showing symptoms of rabies should take preventive measure against bites. If a person was bitten by a rabid dog and later died, the owner was fined heavily. Almost all of the human deaths attributed to rabies are due to rabies transmitted by dogs in countries where dog vaccination programs are not sufficiently developed to stop the spread of the virus. = Horses = Rabies can be contracted in horses if they interact with rabid animals in their pasture, usually through being bitten (e.g. by vampire bats) on the muzzle or lower limbs. Signs include aggression, incoordination, head-pressing, circling, lameness, muscle tremors, convulsions, colic and fever. Horses that experience the paralytic form of rabies have difficulty swallowing, and drooping of the lower jaw due to paralysis of the throat and jaw muscles. Incubation of the virus may range from 2–9 weeks. Death often occurs within 4–5 days of infection of the virus. There are no effective treatments for rabies in horses. Veterinarians recommend an initial vaccination as a foal at three months of age, repeated at one year and given an annual booster. = Monkeys = Monkeys, like humans, can get rabies; however, they do not tend to be a common source of rabies. Monkeys with rabies tend to die more quickly than humans. In one study, 9 of 10 monkeys developed severe symptoms or died within 20 days of infection. Rabies is often a concern for individuals travelling to developing countries as monkeys are the most common source of rabies after dogs in these places. =Rabbits= Despite natural infection of rabbits being rare, they are particularly vulnerable to the rabies virus; rabbits were used to develop the first rabies vaccine by Louis Pasteur in the 1880s, and are continued to be used for rabies diagnostic testing. The virus is often contracted when attacked by other rabid animals and can incubate within a rabbit for up to 2–3 weeks. Symptoms include weakness in limbs, head tremors, low appetite, nasal discharge, and death within 3–4 days. However, there are currently no vaccines available for rabbits. The National Institutes of Health recommends that rabbits be kept indoors or enclosed in hutches outside that do not allow other animals to come in contact with them. = Skunks = In the U.S., there is currently no USDA-approved vaccine for the strain of rabies that afflicts skunks. When cases are reported of pet skunks biting a human, the animals are frequently killed in order to be tested for rabies. It has been reported that three different variants of rabies exist in striped skunks in the north and south central states. Humans exposed to the rabies virus must begin post-exposure prophylaxis before the disease can progress to the central nervous system. For this reason, it is necessary to determine whether the animal, in fact, has rabies as quickly as possible. Without a definitive quarantine period in place for skunks, quarantining the animals is not advised as there is no way of knowing how long it may take the animal to show symptoms. Destruction of the skunk is recommended and the brain is then tested for presence of rabies virus. Skunk owners have recently organized to campaign for USDA approval of both a vaccine and an officially recommended quarantine period for skunks in the United States. = Wolves = Under normal circumstances, wild wolves are generally timid around humans, though there are several reported circumstances in which wolves have been recorded to act aggressively toward humans. The majority of fatal wolf attacks have historically involved rabies, which was first recorded in wolves in the 13th century. The earliest recorded case of an actual rabid wolf attack comes from Germany in 1557. Though wolves are not reservoirs for the disease, they can catch it from other species. Wolves develop an exceptionally severe aggressive state when infected and can bite numerous people in a single attack. Before a vaccine was developed, bites were almost always fatal. Today, wolf bites can be treated, but the severity of rabid wolf attacks can sometimes result in outright death, or a bite near the head will make the disease act too fast for the treatment to take effect. Rabid attacks tend to cluster in winter and spring. With the reduction of rabies in Europe and North America, few rabid wolf attacks have been recorded, though some still occur annually in the Middle East. Rabid attacks can be distinguished from predatory attacks by the fact that rabid wolves limit themselves to biting their victims rather than consuming them. Plus, the timespan of predatory attacks can sometimes last for months or years, as opposed to rabid attacks which end usually after a fortnight. Victims of rabid wolves are usually attacked around the head and neck in a sustained manner. = Other mammals = The most commonly infected terrestrial animals in the U.S.A. are raccoons, skunks, foxes, and coyotes. Any bites by such wild animals must be considered a possible exposure to the rabies virus. Most cases of rabies in rodents reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. have been found among groundhogs (woodchucks). Small rodents such as squirrels, hamsters, guinea pigs, gerbils, chipmunks, rats, mice, and lagomorphs like rabbits and hares are almost never found to be infected with rabies, and are not known to transmit rabies to humans.  Transport of pet animals between countries  Sign at a UK port showing rabies prevention measures aimed at merchant sailors. Rabies is endemic to many parts of the world, and one of the reasons given for quarantine periods in international animal transport has been to try to keep the disease out of uninfected regions. However, most developed countries, pioneered by Sweden, now allow unencumbered travel between their territories for pet animals that have demonstrated an adequate immune response to rabies vaccination. Such countries may limit movement to animals from countries where rabies is considered to be under control in pet animals. There are various lists of such countries. The United Kingdom has developed a list, and France has a rather different list, said to be based on a list of the Office International des Epizooties (OIE). The European Union has a harmonised list. No list of rabies-free countries is readily available from OIE. In recent years, canine rabies has been practically eliminated in North America and Europe due to extensive and often mandatory vaccination requirements. However it is still a significant problem in parts of Africa, parts of the Middle East, parts of Latin America, and parts of Asia. Dogs are considered to be the main reservoir for rabies in developing countries. However, the recent spread of rabies in the northeastern United States and further may cause a restrengthening of precautions against movement of possibly rabid animals between developed countries.

The Shods have a loyal regional following, and remain well known in their home state. Origins The Shods formed in 1993 in Lowell, MA with musicians Scott Pittman, Roy Costa, and music mainstay Kevin Stevenson, whose other projects included Formicide, Only Living Witness, and Duck Duck. Within a week of forming, the band produced a debut EP titled I'm in Lowell, MA. In 1995, the band released its debut full-length album Here Come The Shods on a self-created label called Poorhouse Records. Tours After recruiting F.J. Ventre on Bass, and Dave Aaronoff on second guitar, work began at Fort Apache Studios on what was intended to be their major label release on MCA. This deal, however, fell through and the band shelved the project until 2001. Also during this time, the band toured around the northeast with fellow Bostonians, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, and Stevenson began playing in what became known as the Rivers Cuomo Band.

Lamboo simply means long in Punjabi. It is also known as dosti roti in the Caribbean. This bread is extremely thin and limp, and served folded like a handkerchief. During the Mughal period, Rumali roti was used as a cloth to wipe the grease off the hands at the end of a rich meal. Rumali is usually made with a combination of whole wheat atta flour and white wheaten maida flour and cooked on the convex side of a karahi. A variation of rumali roti from Bannu and surrounding areas of Waziristan is a much larger version called paasti or paosti chappatai, which means soft chappati. They are served as part of a meal known as penda, () usually prepared for a large gathering. Paosti is baked on a batt, which is a 55-gallon drum split in half length-wise and inverted over coal or wood fire.

Radiation checks led to bans of some shipments of vegetables and fish. Japan's was a commission established within the Cabinet of Japan as an independent agency to play the main role in nuclear safety administration. Commissioners are appointed by the Prime Minister of Japan on Diet approval. The commission has stronger authority than any other ordinary advisory committees, in that the commission can make recommendations to relevant agencies in the name of the prime minister if it is necessary. The Nuclear Safety Commission reviews safety inspections conducted by regulatory agencies, such as the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency. In 2007, the independence of the Nuclear Safety Commission was questioned by seismologist Professor Katsuhiko Ishibashi, after a senior Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency official appeared to rule out a new review of the NSC's seismic design standards.Katsuhiko Ishibashi, \\"Why worry? Japan's nuclear plants at grave risk from quake damage\\" The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus (August 11, 2007) Also published by the International Herald Tribune (August 11, 2007). Retrieved March 24, 2011 Madarame Haruki, as chairman of the Nuclear Safety Commission (2010–2012), was an ardent pro-nuclear advocate. However, his inquiry testimony in the Diet in February 2012, showed that he had become critical of the commission's approach. He said that \\"Japan's atomic safety rules are inferior to global standards and left the country unprepared for the Fukushima nuclear disaster last March\\". There were flaws in, and lax enforcement of, the safety rules governing Japanese nuclear power companies, and this included insufficient protection against tsunamis. He said the nuclear power industry had strenuously opposed adopting stricter international safety standards. He spoke of officials ignoring nuclear risks and said, \\"We ended up wasting our time looking for excuses that these measures are not needed in Japan\\". Madarame also asserted that Japan's safety monitoring technology is outdated, while acknowledging that the Nuclear Safety Commission had, \\"…succumbed to a blind belief in the country’s technical prowess and failed to thoroughly assess the risks of building nuclear reactors in an earthquake-prone country\\". Regulators and the utilities missed many opportunities to improve operating safety standards and warned that safety regulations are fundamentally inadequate and minimally enforced. He also asserted that regulatory capture was an issue, where regulators had little power and were often subsumed by utility interests. In Madarame's view, there has been a collective heedlessness about safety and inadequate risk management.Jeff Kingston, \\" Japan's Nuclear Village,\\" The Asia-Pacific Journal, Vol. 10, Issue 37, No. 1, September 10, 2012.

The task of the new office was to make preparations to realize the new control-body under the Ministry of Environment (MOE) in April 2012 including the necessary legislation for this. The office would be manned with 37 staff members from the Cabinet Office, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), and other ministries and agencies, and some delegations from private companies.Jaif (5 September 2011)Japan’s Cabinet Secretariat Sets Up Office for Nuclear Safety Regulatory Reform *On 2 January 2012 Haruki Madarame, since April 2011 appointed as chief of the Nuclear Safety Commission of Japan, acknowledged that he had received 4 million yen from 2009–11 from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, a big manufacturer of nuclear power reactors. Another member of the government panel, Seiji Shiroya was paid 3.1 million yen by Japan Atomic Industrial Forum Inc. over three years to 2009, while he was professor at the University of Kyoto. According to Madarame, a former professor of the University of Tokyo, these donations had no influence on their decision-making, when they were promoting nuclear safety by double- checking the regulatory measures implemented by the nuclear industry and science ministries. According to the two scientists, the donations were intended to promote nuclear research, and the money was spent on research and to cover the costs of business trips.

In Islamic eschatology, he is known for encountering the Dajjal during one of his journeys. As such, Tamim's story has become the bedrock of various Medieval narratives and legends, earning Tamim the title of \\"the intrepid traveler.\\" Bellino, 2009 Biography Originally a Christian priest, al-Dari lived in Palestine and belonged to the Banu al-Dar—a clan of the Lakhm tribe. His first contact with Muhammad was in 628 CE when he led a delegation of ten other Banu al-Dar members. Previously Muhammad granted Banu al-Dar a part of the revenues of conquered land after the Muslim victory at the Battle of Khaybar. Al-Dari met with Muhammad to receive the revenues and after meeting him, al-Dari embraced Islam and settled in Medina.Houtsma, M., Arnold, T.W. (1993).E.J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913-1936 BRILL, pp.646-648. . Maqam of Sheikh Tamim, traditionally taken to be Tamim al-Dari, by Bayt JibrinPetersen, 2001, p. 122 After his conversion, al-Dari became an adviser to Muhammad, particularly on public worship. His advice included the introduction of oil lamps in mosques. He is traditionally considered to be the first narrator of Islamic religious stories. Many of his stories included ones on the end of the world, Dajjal beasts and the coming of the Antichrist. His wife thought he was dead and married to another man. The matter was communicated to Caliph Umar (), and he referred it to Ali who said that Muhammad had foreseen all that would happen to Tamim and left the wife to have her own choice between the two husbands. The wife ultimately decided to go back to al-Dari. Prior to Muhammad's death, al-Dari was granted a large qita'a (akin to a fief) for control of Hebron, Beit Einun and the surrounding area, although at that time Palestine was still under Byzantine control. The deed was written up by Ali and when the Muslims conquered Palestine in 634, al-Dari acquired the territory. Originally, al-Dari's role as the owner of the qita'a was to collect the kharaj (land taxes). He was forbidden to enslave any of the locals or sell their property.Gil, 1997, pp. 129-130 In 655, al-Dari left Medina to reside in his native Palestine where he died in 661. According to tradition, he is buried in the town of Bayt Jibrin (in the vicinity of Hebron), destroyed by Israel in 1948.Sharon, 1999, pp 140-141 Today his maqam (shrine) is abandoned and located just north to Kibbutz Beit Guvrin. According to the Egyptian historian Ibn Lahi'a (714–790), members of al-Dari's family were still the owners of his estates in Hebron and Beit Einun during the historian's lifetime.Elad 1996, pp. 26–27. The Narrative of the Dajjal According to Sunni sources, Tamim ad-Dari had embarked on expedition that was shipwrecked on a mysterious island Cook, 1998 . On this island, he is taken by a strange creature al-Jassasah to meet a chained man inside of a monastery who is said to be intrigued of the arrival of the tribesman. The chained man is eager to ask them questions about the outside world, asking about the natural condition of various locations, and about the arrival of the Prophet Muhammad. After the tribesmen answer him, the chained man announces he is the Dajjal, and provides them eschatological details related to the future, warning them of his advent. The tribesmen are somehow able to leave the island and relate their story back to the Prophet Muhammad who relates it back to the populace ; In-book reference: Book 54 (The Book of Tribulations and Portents of the Last Hour), Hadith 149; English translation: Book 41, Hadith 7208}}. Property Rights in Palestine During an audience with the Prophet Muhammad, it is said that Tamim had asked him for a deed to two villages or estates in the area of Palestine. This was an unusual request because they were granted ownership over property that at the time was considered far from the Prophet's control. One of the variant sources mentions: {{Quote In the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Beneficent. Mentioned in this deed (kitab) is what the Messenger of Allah (Muhammad) bestowed upon the Daris. Since Allah gave to him (the Prophet) the earth, he (then) bestowed upon them [the Dari clan] Bayt 'Ayniin, Hibrun [or Habrun], al-Martum and Bayt Ibrahim-whoever is (living) inside them-forever. 'Abbas b. 'Abd al-Muttalib, Khuzayma b. Qays, and Hasana witnessed this . As the land was not in the Prophet's possession at the time, Muslim hagiographical sources, including modern scholars, mention this apparent feat of foreknowledge as a proof to bolster the Prophet Muhammad's claim of Prophethood . Tamim legally acquired the property under the reign of the second Caliph Umar and embarked on his journey towards his land after the death of the third Caliph, Uthman . It is difficult to trace back the history of the property Tamim received as the city of Hebron is rarely mentioned in Islamic historical sources. However, various disputes over the rights of the land are recorded through out the ages . When the Seljuk Turks became dominant in Jerusalem (1073 CE), the Daris claim to the land came to face serious disputes; in certain cases, it seems that the rulers of the land had aimed to dispossess the Daris from their land. One example of an issue raised was by the Qadi of Jerusalem, Abu Hatim al-Harawi al-Hanafi issued a fatwa in which he claimed the Prophet could not rightfully bestow the land to the Daris as it had not been under his rule at that time. This argument was considered extremely audacious, depending more on political interests than Islamic jurisprudence, and was subsequently refuted at length by everyone who had commented on the subject thereafter . Eventually, the Daris' right to the property was defended by the great mystic and scholar, Al-Ghazali who happened to be in Jerusalem during this period . Ghazali's defense of the Daris' right to the property marked an interesting rift within Islamic jurisprudence during this time. Prominent Shafi'i jurists, like Ghazali and Suyuti were defending the right of Tamim ad-Dari's family to the land in Hebron, and then Hanafis, largely influenced by the rulership contested this right. Defending the property rights of the Tamimi family was considered especially important as the land deed provided a unique, written precedent dated from the time of the Prophet for the system of the waqf- considered central to Islam.

Plot summary The setting for most of the novel \\"is Catchprice Motors, a terminally run-down used car business founded by Frieda Catchprice in the Forties but now resembling nothing more than a 'badly tended family grave'. The Catchprices live in Franklin, New South Wales, which used to be a country town twenty miles from Sydney: since then Sydney has swollen out of recognition (it's now the second biggest city in the world, after Calcutta), and suddenly Franklin finds itself only two miles along the F4 from the outermost suburbs. Responsibility for running the business rests mainly with Frieda’s daughter Cathy, a rather miserably aspiring Country and Western singer, and her sleazeball husband Howie, who sports a pencil-thin moustache and 'a secret rash which stopped in a clean line at his collar and the cuffs of his shirt'.

She studied art at what was to become the Royal College of Art with fellow-student The Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll. The Princess painted a portrait of her which today hangs in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada. She first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1876, and her work was often seen at the Grosvenor Gallery in London. Montalba was rarely separated from her family, residing in later days chiefly at the family home in Venice, Italy. She died in Venice, on September 14, 1893, and was buried near her father in the cemetery of San Michele. One of her sculptures, a bronze titled Boy Catching a Crab, is in the collection of The Victoria and Albert Museum. Early life Henrietta Montalba was born on April 8, 1848, the fifth child and the fourth daughter of Anthony Rubens Montalba and Emeline (née Davies), all of whom would attain considerable success as artists. Her birth was at 9 Camden Terrace West, Camden New Town, Saint Pancras in London. Her birth was registered by her mother on 6 October 1848 with the given name Henrietta Mary Ann Skerrett Montalba.

Later she became a pupil of Jules Dalou, the French sculptor, during his residence in London. Career Montalba first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1876, and her work was often seen at the Grosvenor Gallery, the New Gallery, and elsewhere. She mainly devoted herself to portrait or fancy busts; some executed in marble, like those of Doctor Mezger of Amsterdam (Grosvenor Gallery, 1886), and Dr. Schollander, the Scandinavian artist; others in bronze, like that of the Marquess of Lorne; but the greater part of her work was executed in terra cotta, as in the case of her bust of Robert Browning (Grosvenor Gallery, 1883). Other works worthy of note were \\"A Dalecarlian Peasant Woman\\" and \\"The Raven,\\" representing a raven seated on a bust of Pallas, from the poem by Edgar Allan Poe. Her last work was of a more ambitious nature, being a life-size figure of \\"A Venetian Boy Catching a Crab,\\" executed in bronze, which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1893, and at the World's Columbian Exposition, Chicago, in the same year. Her bronze bust of Richard Burchett, headmaster of the South Kensington Schools, has been transferred to the new building of the Royal Academy of Art, along with its setting designed by George Clausen. =Royal favour= She was on terms of friendship with her fellow-student Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, who painted a portrait of her and presented it to the Canadian Academy of Arts in Ottawa (now in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada).National Gallery of Canada Online Retrieved August 2011 Both Henrietta and her sister Clara spent time with the Princess in Canada, painting landscapes.Royal Observations: Canadians & Royalty By Arthur Bousfield, and Garry Toffoli Retrieved September 2011 Henrietta was rarely separated from her family, residing in later days chiefly at Venice, Italy, and making frequent visits with them in Italy, Sweden, and elsewhere.

Plot The pilot receives a radio message about a bomb threat against the plane. Co-pilot Sugisaka checks the passengers' bags for the bomb, which are cleared apart from one man who had no bag. Stewardess Kuzumi opens an unaccompanied suitcase under a bench, finding a rifle. The man pulls a gun on Sugisaka and orders the pilot to fly to Okinawa. He shoots out the plane's transistor radio just as it was breaking the news about a UFO over Japan with Japanese and US Air Force fighters in pursuit. A luminous object streaks past overhead, knocking out the airplane's control and causing an engine fire to erupt. The airplane crashes on an uncharted deserted island. Only a handful of people survive the crash: Sugisaka; Kuzumi; Mrs. Neal, an American widow; Senator Mano of the Constitutional Democratic Party; weapons exporter Tokiyasu and his wife Noriko; psychiatrist Momotake; space biologist Professor Sagai; and the young man who called in the bomb threat. The hijacker suddenly sits up, grabs Kuzumi and escapes into the jungle, encountering the spaceship. Kuzumi hides, but the hijacker steps into a clearing. A dark blob oozes towards the hijacker, whose forehead is split wide open, causing Kuzumi to scream and pass out. Sugisaka finds the unconscious Kuzumi and carries her back to the plane. Dr. Momotake later hypnotizes her to recount the events in the jungle. The teenager who called in the bomb threat attacks Dr. Momotake, who falls off the cliff into the hijacker, who then kills him by draining his blood. As the survivors discuss finding water, a knock at the door is heard. Sugisaka opens it to find the hijacker lying on the ground with a big scar on his forehead. The survivors carry the hijacker inside and dress his wound. Tokiyasu then uses the rifle to force everyone out of the plane and locks himself safely inside with the hijacker. Right after, Tokiyasu's screams are heard and the door swings open. Everyone rushes inside to find Tokiyasu dead, drained of all blood. The hijacker appears and carries Noriko off to the spaceship. At sunrise, Noriko is seen standing on a ridge. She speaks, but with the voice of the alien, the Gokemidoro. It is revealed that the Gokemidoro have invaded Earth, intending to eradicate the human race. Noriko then plunges off the ridge, shriveling into a cadaver. The passengers argue about whether extraterrestrials would invade Earth. Professor Sagai theorizes that the hijacker was turned into a vampire. Mano challenges them to prove there are vampires, causing the others to plan to sacrifice someone to the Gokemidoro. The survivors shove the teenager outside as the hijacker slowly advances towards him.. The teenager pulls out the bomb that he has been hiding and threatens to blow up the plane unless they let him back in. They do not and the teenager triggers the bomb, killing himself and blowing a large opening in the airplane, wounding Professor Sagai. Mano runs off with Mrs. Neal. When the hijacker catches up with them, Mano pushes Mrs. Neal to the hijacker to save himself. Neal shoots several times but misses. The hijacker kills her. Mano escapes back to the plane with the hijacker right behind him. The remaining survivors leaves the plane to help Mano, but he runs past them, locking the plane door behind him. While Mano watches from inside the plane, Sugisaka tosses a bucket of airplane fuel at the hijacker, then sets him on fire. The Gokemidoro crawls out of the burning hijacker, creeps in the plane and enters Professor Sagai's forehead. Sagai drains Mano, then turns to Sugisaka and Kuzumi, who escape. Sagai follows until he is swept off a hill by a landslide. Sugisaka and Kuzumi keep running while Sagai goes back to the spaceship. Once there, the Gokemidoro crawls out, reducing Saiga to dust. Sugisaka and Kuzumi reach a highway, finding every human in the cars and the city dead. The Gokemidoro informs them that no one will be spared. In the epilogue, Sugisaka and Kuzumi are wandering on rocky terrain. In orbit around Earth, a whole fleet of Gokemidoro spaceships await the order to attack.

The review described the film as an \\"Uninspired mélange of flying saucers and vampirism\\" that was \\"woodenly directed and bogged down by long stretches of melodramatic dissension among the characters which acts as an uneasy springboard for much preaching and moralizing about why mankind deserves to be taken over by invaders from another world.\\" See also List of horror films of 1968 * List of Japanese films of 1968  References  =Footnotes= =Sources= External links * 1968 films 1968 horror films 1960s science fiction films 1960s science fiction horror films Japanese films Japanese aviation films Japanese horror films Japanese science fiction films Japanese-language films Tokusatsu films Alien invasions in films Mass murder in fiction Japanese science fiction horror films Shochiku films Films scored by Shunsuke Kikuchi Films set on airplanes Vampires in film ","title":"Goke, Body Snatcher from Hell"},{"id":"19708496","text":"Jacques Cambessèdes (26 August 1799 - 20 December 1863) was a French botanist born in Montpellier.

He appeared in one game in Major League Baseball for the Philadelphia Phillies in 1926. He was a right-handed thrower and batter. During his career, he was measured at in height and 175 lbs in weight. He attended Dartmouth College and the University of Vermont. Yarnall made his professional debut in 1924 with the York White Roses of the New York–Pennsylvania League. In 1926, Yarnall was acquired by the Phillies from the Martinsville Blue Sox. His only major league appearance came on June 30, 1926, at age 23. Yarnall was brought into a game against the Brooklyn Robins with the Phillies down 5-2 in the 4th inning. He pitched a scoreless inning, and in the top of the 5th struck out in what would be his only major league plate appearance. During that inning, the Phillies scored four runs to take a 6-5 lead, and Yarnall came out to start the bottom of the 5th. When the first two Robins batters reached base, he was relieved by Jack Knight. Both runners came around to score, and the Phillies lost the game 11-9, with Yarnall taking the loss. He finished the game with one inning pitched, two runs, three hits and one walk allowed, and an earned run average of 18.00. After his one-game major league career, Yarnall returned to minor league baseball with the Jeannette Jays, and continued to play in the minors on and off until 1933. He also coached baseball, football and basketball while also teaching economics at the Lowell Textile Institute, which later became the Lowell Technological Institute. He became the school's athletic director in 1953, retiring in 1966.

He was involved in the Yugoslav pop and rock and even folk music scene, and beside his mainstream success, being one of the pioneers of the Yugoslav punk rock, he also gained a status of an underground culture celebrity. Biography =Beginnings= Ivan Glišić was born in 1942 during World War II in Yugoslavia in Pirot, Serbia, but 10 years later he moved with his family to Šabac, his new hometown in what was then the Socialist Republic of Serbia. He became interested in rocknroll in the late 1950s as a teenager, after hearing artists such as Tommy Steele, Cliff Richard and The Drifters on Radio Luxembourg, which was a usual source for music information of the Yugoslav youths of the time. In the following years, throughout the early 1960s he became a fan of The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, and an avid record collector, although, bizarrely, he didn't have a record player yet. He purchased his first one in 1964 together with a group of friends, who were also rock music fans and with whom he participated in his hometown's rock subculture. Although they faced occasional problems with the authorities, they were permitted to use the publicly owned youth cultural centre, such as all major towns in Yugoslavia had, for their musical and artistic activities. There emerged art collectives, youth magazines and a writing workshops led by Glišić, and several local bands were formed, such as Čivije, Slatki Limunovi and Baš Čelik, while concert was held by the prominent group Siluete from Belgrade. Ivan Glišić's favourite artists at the time included: The Who, Pretty Things, The Kinks, The Animals, The Troggs and Them. He was impressed by the 1960s social revolution, but gradually became disilusioned with it. His heroes, The Beatles, received MBE by the Queen, and during a certain period, went into what he perceived as escapism under Maharishi's influence, instead of supporting the then vibrant student movement, especially active during the global protests of 1968, which also took place in Yugoslavia, leaving strong impressions on Glišić. =Songwriter= In the early 1970s, Ivan Glišić became involved in the pop and rock music scene of Zagreb, then Socialist Republic of Croatia, where he cooperated with the notable group Roboti, whose bassist was Rajmond Ruić. As a tandem consisting of Glišić as a songwriter, and Ruić as a composer and arranger, they were active in writing songs for the prominent Croatian pop and rock artists: Josipa Lisac, Time, Darko Domjan and Dalibor Brun, achieving great prominence not only in Croatia, but also in the wider Yugoslav pop and rock scene. Glišić became so successful that the biggest former Yugoslav major label, the Zagreb-based Jugoton employed him, paying him weekly round trip-airline tickets from Belgrade to Zagreb, providing him accommodation in the most prestige hotels and best recording schedules. Glišić went to Zagreb every Sunday and returned to Šabac every weekend. Some of his successful hits included \\"Ulica jorgovana\\" and \\"Laku noć, Katarina\\" performed by Darko Domjan. Glišić also participated in many domestic and international music festivals and was awarded on several occasions. He joined Nikola Karaklajić, one of the first Yugoslav rock DJ's, who ran a famous radio show on Radio Belgrade called Veče uz radio (An Evening by the Radio). Glišić wrote the lyrics for the show's \\"anthem\\" which was recorded jointly by the groups S.O.S. and Zajedno. The former included Miša Aleksić, also a co-author of the song, while the latter, Bora Đorđević. They both later formed the prominent Serbian rock act Riblja Čorba. The second co-author was Laza Ristovski, the keyboardist of the Bosnian and Yugoslav cult band Bijelo dugme. During the 1970s, Glišić wrote lyrics for various rock bands, such as: the aforementioned S.O.S., Rondo, Tetrapak, and others. After finishing his university studies, he became a school teacher, and also wrote lyrics for the rock band Mudra sova consisting of his pupils, early teenagers. Initially, the band was successful, it released its first single promoted with a well attended live gig and recorded the material for its first LP. However some media criticised Glišić, claiming that he abused his position for manipulating children, therefore he abandoned the whole thing. Unusually, although he was into pop and rock music, Glišić also began writing songs for pop folk acts as well, including Lepa Brena and her backing band Slatki greh who became very popular across Yugoslavia in the 1980s. Glišić and Jugoton had a fruitful co-operation, and his royalties were regularly received on his bank account, however as the break-up of Yugoslavia was evidently approaching, he was suggested by Jugoton, which was located in Croatia, to withdraw his payments and transfer them into a bank in his homeland Serbia. Glišić followed the advice, but during the 1990s economic and political turmoil in Milošević's led Serbia, he lost them all. =Literature= Ivan Glišić is an author of many literary works, some published as books, some in the press, including poetry, prose, essays etc. He also received several literary awards. His works include (Serbian language titles): \\"Jer znala je mama, mene će skrckati levi elementi\\", \\"Zdravo Kolumbo, ovde Amerika\\", \\"Plastično lice\\", \\"Rock and roll Warriors\\", \\"Dogfucker\\", \\"Ura, ura, matura\\", \\"Loši dečaci\\", \\"Ponoćni očajnik\\", \\"Čizme slobode\\", \\"Mars, punk struggle for life\\", \\"La džungla ili Niža rasa\\", \\"Diler – Život u svetlosti\\", \\"Bure i osame Miloša Crnjanskog\\", \\"Mikelanđelo – avanture tela i duha\\", \\"Ključ od sebe ili Isidora Sekulić\\", the series of books titled \\"Gorila\\" and many others. He also finished and redacted the posthumous autobiography \\"Zub šestica\\" by Dušan Savković. Unusually, Glišić never held a public book promotion, as a result of a bad experience from the early 1970s, when his first poetry book \\"Svadbarenje\\" was widthdrawn from the book stores and its promotion was banned. The reason for this was that the book reviewer was Mika Antić, its cover was designed by Milić od Mačve, while the poetry reader at the event should have been Zoran Radmilović, all of whom the communist regime considered suspicious and somewhat dissident at that moment. After becoming affiliated with the punk subculture in the late 1970s, Glišić became one of the first punk writers in Yugoslavia. =Punk= After graduating university studies and becoming a school professor, Ivan Glišić went to London, UK in the late 1970s on an excursion with his students. There he got acquainted himself with punk rock, new wave and the skinhead subculture, and had an opportunity to watch The Adverts performing live, but also he witnessed the violent clashes between punks and teddy boys. He embraced punk as it reminded him of his youth's music and rebellion, and after returning home, he formed a band called N.T. (an abbreviation for novi talas, meaning in \\"new wave\\" in Serbian) consisting of some of his students who accompanied him in London, and himself as vocalist. Soon before it recorded its first single, the Mudra sova event described before repeated itself. The group split as the student's parents forbade them from hanging around with Glišić any more, and he was expelled from his workplace. He heavily involved himself in the Yugoslav punk and hardcore punk scene, publishing D.I.Y. punkzines featuring his punk literature and punk visual art. His favourite groups included: The Damned, Generation X, Dead Kennedys, The Lurkers, Magazine, UK Subs, Rich Kids, The Exploited and others. During this period Glišić became close friend with Satan Panonski, the controversial punk musician, poet and body artist from Vinkovci area, Socialist Republic of Croatia, notorious not only for his excessive behaviour, stage performance, transvestitism and homosexuality, but also because he was serving in a psychiatric hospital following a homicide he committed. After a mail correspondence, the two met each other on several occasions, whenever the latter was permitted to leave the institution on a time off for socialisation for a good behaviour. One of the meetings took place on a concert performed by the prominent British band Charged GBH. After the dissolution of Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav Wars broke out, they maintained the contact although under very harsh circumstances using the Red Cross as a mediator. According to some media reports, Satan Panonski, embraced nationalist chauvinism, although he was previously known to be uncompromisingly against it. After learning about this, Glišić tried to reach him by phone from Budapest, in neighbouring Hungary, where he went on a Nick Cave concert. He succeeded to find him, and during the conversation, Satan Panonski denied the allegations. However, reportedly, he joined the Croatian forces during the War in Croatia, and he was killed in action. Ivan Glišić opposed the war and supported the opposition represented by Otpor! against Slobodan Milošević who ruled the then so called Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The struggle resulted with Milošević's fall during the Bulldozer Revolution in 2000. Currently, Glišić is still an active participant in the cultural life of Serbia, including literature, art exhibitions, literary contests etc. List of books Prose * Dogfucker * Čizme Slobode * Plastično Lice * Smorvil * Bure i osame Miloša Crnjanskog * Mikelanđelo * Amor u Borinom vranju * Moje druženje s Lorensom * Moje druženje s Milovanom Glišićem * Žuti ker * Ponoćni očajnik * La Džungla, niža rasa * Loši Dečaci * Ura!Ura!Matura! * Rock 'n' Roll Warriors * Pozitivno ludilo * Deca ulice * Lađa Argo * Mozak u tegli * Pasja nedelja * Šljamhaus * Kabare Čivija * Gvozdeni jahač – Gorila IV * Ekskurzije u svetlost * Vodič kroz Krležu * Šabac moje mladosti * Slike sa izložbe ili Teorija zaokreta * Jer znala je mama mene će skrckati levi elementi * Zdravo Kolumbo ovde Amerika * Crvena zevalica * Diler – Život u svetlosti * Orlove Kandže * Cvrčak * Goli sin * Pazolini - varijacije na jedan život i jednu smrt Poetry * Pastir kraj vatre * Jesenjin * Lorka je umro od ljubavi * Kamenolom ljubavi * Upomoć!

In 1969, the College was purchased and underwent its first name change, to \\"Western College of Allied Health Careers – A Bryman School.\\" The Education Corporation of America (\\"EdCOA, Inc.\\") purchased the college in 1983 and changed its name to Western Career College (WCC). In 1986, WCC opened a second campus in the Bayfair Center in San Leandro, California. The third campus opened in 1997 in Pleasant Hill, California. WCC earned regional accreditation by the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges in June 2001. In December 2003, U.S. Education Corporation, a California-based company, acquired Western Career College. The U.S. Education Corporation also acquired Apollo College, which was founded by Margaret M Carlson in 1975 in Phoenix, Arizona, to prepare graduates for careers in skilled professions. The U.S. Education Corporation was led by president and chief executive officer George Montgomery from 2002 to 2011. The college expanded in August 2005 by incorporating the operations and programs of Silicon Valley College (SVC). In September 2008, U.S. Education Corporation became a division of DeVry, Inc. In 2010, Western Career College changed its name to Carrington College California and Apollo College changed its name to Carrington College. The name Carrington College was chosen after a year of extensive research and testing with current and potential students, and staff focus groups. \\"The fact that the name contains the word 'caring' connotes the care and dedication faculty and staff take to help students achieve their career goals and aspirations,\\" said George Montgomery, president of U.S. Education, the parent organization for both colleges. \\"It also coincides with the schools’ emphasis on health care programs.\\"https://carrington.edu/news/western-and-apollo-college-unify-brands- under-carrington-name/ President Montgomery retired at the end of 2011 and was succeeded as president of the group by Robert Paul, DeVry University's vice president for metro operations. In 2012, under Paul's leadership, the institution's mascots, Blue and Goldie, were developed. In 2014, Paul succeeded David Pauldine as president of DeVry University and was succeeded as president of Carrington College Group by Jeff Akens. Previously, Akens had served as president of Carrington College California from 2007 to 2014 and had been with the institution since 1993. In 2016, Donna M. Lorraine was appointed president of Carrington College, after Akens' retirement. In 2014, Carrington College California received approval under the ACCJC/WASC accreditation to add the Carrington College campuses to its existing network, resulting in one consolidated institution called Carrington College. In December 2018, Carrington College's ownership was transferred from the Adtalem Global Education group (formerly the DeVry Education Group) to the San Joaquin Valley College, Inc.. Carrington's Trades Education Center was introduced in 2020 in Phoenix, AZ. Academics Carrington College campuses offer programs that lead to a Certificate of Achievement or Associate of Science Degree. Carrington College provides employment-focused, outcome-based, postsecondary education and training with a focus in the healthcare industry, in areas including medical, dental, administrative, veterinary and health studies programs. =Curriculum= Carrington College offers 26 programs through five areas of focus including medicine, health studies, dentistry, administration, or veterinary medicine. Some of the programs include health care administration, pharmacy technology, practical nursing, criminal justice: corrections, veterinary assisting, and dental assisting. =Accreditation= Carrington College is regionally accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges.

Kalai's conjectures on quantum computing Conjecture 1 (No quantum error correction). The process for creating a quantum error-correcting code will necessarily lead to a mixture of the desired codewords with undesired codewords. The probability of the undesired codewords is uniformly bounded away from zero. (In every implementation of quantum error-correcting codes with one encoded qubit, the probability of not getting the intended qubit is at least some δ > 0, independently of the number of qubits used for encoding.) Conjecture 2. A noisy quantum computer is subject to noise in which information leaks for two substantially entangled qubits have a substantial positive correlation. Conjecture 3. In any quantum computer at a highly entangled state there will be a strong effect of error-synchronization. Conjecture 4. Noisy quantum processes are subject to detrimental noise.How Quantum Computers Fail by Gil Kalai (2011) See alsoKalai's 3d conjecture *Entropy influence conjecture References External links Kalai's home page at Hebrew University * Combinatorics and more, Kalai's blog * (Plenary Lecture 19) 1955 births Living people Combinatorialists Hebrew University of Jerusalem alumni Hebrew University of Jerusalem faculty Yale University faculty Science bloggers 20th- century Israeli mathematicians 21st-century mathematicians ","title":"Gil Kalai"},{"id":"19709110","text":"Latham is a small town in the Mid West region of Western Australia.

Dixon's first video part was a feature in Baker 3. Dixon was alternately featured in the Baker Skateboards video Baker Has a Deathwish, then rode for Deathwish skateboards before parting ways. Antwuan's current sponsors include: FTP Skateboards, Hardluck MFG, Straye Shoes, Thunder Trucks, Brooklyn Projects, Hearts and Hammers, and Transitions Skateshop.  Biography  = Early life = Born in Victorville, California and raised in Carson, Dixon received his first skateboard from his brother who stole it from someone at a skatepark, then later gave it to Dixon. On March 22, 2008, Dixon was arrested by Tampa police on charges stemming from possession of marijuana (less than 20 grams) and cocaine with the intent to sell, as well as the battery of three law enforcement officers. Dixon was irrevocably held on $4,000 dollars bond, which was subsequently paid for his immediate release. In an interview for Skateboardermag, Dixon spoke on the incident: :Ah, man, some crazy shit happened at Tampa! I was just over there chilling, smoking, and I'm chilling outside paying for that tatoo [sic] dude and this girl to get in. Then, all of a sudden, this girl's like, \\"Antwuan, you wanna go smoke?\\" So we go and we're about to smoke these blunts, then this truck rolls up and it's undercover cops. They just jumped out. Then, this lady had seen I had a big-ass bag of weed and shit. She'd seen my money and thought I was a drug dealer from out there. They were talking about seizing my money, and I was like, \\"I don't know what that means,\\" and they're, like, \\"We're basically gonna take your money when we leave here,\\" and I'm, like, \\"Hell no!\\" I'm sitting there being handcuffed and shit, so I got up and grabbed my wallet and then I held it. Then me and the cops started fighting for a little bit I guess. I don't know, I was pretty faded. I don't remember. Next thing you know, I end up in jail in Florida with all these batteries against police officers. Now I got to go to court and stuff all the time... In 2013, Dixon received a three year jail sentence after violating his probation, and was charged with battery, vandalism, and child endangerment after an argument at a convenience store escalated to violence. Dixon gave details in an interview with Thrasher magazine during his jail sentence: :Why am I in jail? Ah, man, for violating a three-year joint suspension. They gave me three years. The original case was, some fool at 7-11 being racist, I socked him a couple times. Spit in his face and he’s still talking shit. Walking outside, boom, boom, boom. I bought what I was going to buy and go outside. Mind you, this dude had kids with him. He put his kids in the car. I’m a little faded or whatever, so I don’t give a fuck. He keeps talking shit so I grab my board and start breaking his windows of his car. And his kids are in the car so they gave me battery, five counts of battery, vandalism and child endangerment. So you know, I violated the probation I was offered in this case. I had a three-year joint suspension, which is why I’m here now. Dixon served his sentence and is now living in Los Angeles. On September 13, 2016, Dixon was taken back into custody. Charges are pending.

It was written by Hans Alfredson and Tage Danielsson, the duo known as Hasse & Tage, and directed by Danielsson. Both of the writers starred in the show; Hasse played the banker Falkenström and Tage friherr von Löwenskiöld. The show also starred Monica Zetterlund, Birgitta Andersson, Grynet Molvig, Martin Ljung, Gösta Ekman, Fatima Ekman, Fina Kören and Gunnar Svenssons Salongsorkester. The show was later adapted for television, using Sturehov Manor near Stockholm as the setting. This has been released on DVD and the film soundtrack has been released for both LP and CD. Plot The story is set at the beginning of the 19th century, an era that Hasse & Tage thought was very much like the 1960s. A group of people from the upper classes has withdrawn to a place in the country where they plan to live for a couple of days, listening to Schubert's music and simply enjoying life. The plan goes very wrong however, when most of the things go wrong and the company runs out of food and drinks in a couple of days. Music All the music in the show was based on compositions originally written by Franz Schubert, but with new lyrics and arrangements by Hans Alfredsson and Tage Danielsson. The songs used in the show are as follows: First Act * Forellen (The Trout), sung by Monica Zetterlund (Die Forelle, D. 550). * Sång, som handlar om sig själv (Song, that is about itself), sung by Egil and the men (Nachthelle, D 892) * Herdens sång om herdens sång om herden (The shepherd's song about the shepherd's song about the shepherd), sung by Martin Ljung (8th symphony 'The Unfinished', Second Movement) * Du går an (You're okay), sung by Grynet Molvig and Tage Danielsson (Octet in F major, Fourth Movement, opus 166 D. 803) * Pigornas Kurt (Kurt of the maids), sung by Monica Zetterlund (Theme from the 6th Symphony, First Movement) * Vid sybågen, aka Här sitter jag i värmen (At the Embroidery, or Here I sit in the warmth), sung by Grynet Molvig (Der Lindenbaum, op 89, d. 911) * Spader, Madame! (A word play, Spader Madame can be thought of as The Queen of Spades, but the sentence actually means \\"I'm going crazy, madame\\"), sung by all (5th Symphony, 3rd Movement) Second Act * Den gode vilden or Lilla svarta Saras dans (The Good Savage, or Little black Sara's dance), performed by Fatima Ekman and chorus (Nr. 3, from 3 Klavierstücke, D.946). * Längtans blåa blomma (The Longings blue flower), sung by Ulla Hallin and chorus (Rosamunde, Entr'acte No 2) * Blodvisan (The Bloodsong), sung by Grynet Molvig (Waltz No. 6 from Twelve Waltzes, op. 18, D. 145). * Donna Juanita, sung by Monica Zetterlund. (6th Symphony, Second Movement). * Hittebarnet (The abandoned child), sung by Monica Zetterlund and chorus (First and Second waltzes from Twelve Waltzes, op. 18, D. 145). * Solen är en ball kula (The Sun is a groovy marble), sung by all (Overture from Rosamunde). * Lyckan är alltid kort (Happiness is always short), sung by all (Theme from the Unfinished 8th Symphony, First movement). Reception The stage play, although popular with the public, got very bad reviews from the press. The televised version, however, gave the show recognition among both public and critics. Those who had been negative about the stage play and written harsh reviews on it gave a very positive response to the other version of the show. The show was revived at Malmö stadsteater in 1977 and at the Göteborg City Theatre in 1986. References Staffan Schöier & Stefan Hermelin (2005).

History A need existed for a small shunting unit that could handle the requirements at the smaller junction marshalling yards, larger intermediate stops and the workshop needs. To resolve this, the X100, and later X200s, was designed and built entirely in the system's own workshops from the early 1960s. X100 class were two 0-4-0 centre-cab diesel-hydraulic shunting locomotives built at the New South Wales Government Railways' Chullora Railway Workshops. They were delivered in 1962 as the 80 class locomotives, but were re-classified as Shunting Tractors and renumbered X101 and X102 before being allotted to Wauchope and Coffs Harbour. Originally painted in a crimson red and cream colour scheme, they were later repainted in the standard Indian red with chrome lining.

The author analyses the personalities of characters such as Hernán Cortés, La Malinche, Moctezuma II, Cuauhtémoc, and other key players in the conquest of Mesoamerica. He refers extensively to the descriptions offered by Bernal Díaz del Castillo in his Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España in analysing the events. He imagines what might have happened if the native populations had not been reduced to silence by brutality, and what their impact on Western civilization might have been. Understanding that the West holds both economic and cultural sway over the contemporary world because of the colonization of America, he wonders how the cultural life of Mesoamerica – particularly that of the Aztecs – would have evolved if the arrival of the Europeans had not decimated the indigenous societies through war, disease and slavery.

She was the mother of James Butler, 1st Earl of Ormond.  Family  Joan FitzGerald was born in Fermoy, Co. Cork, Ireland, in 1281, the daughter of John FitzThomas FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Kildare, Baron of Offaly, and Blanche de La Roche. She had two brothers, Gerald (died 1303), and Thomas FitzGerald, 2nd Earl of Kildare (died 5 April 1328), who married Joan de Burgh (c. 1300 – 23 April 1359), daughter of Richard Óg de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster and Margaret de Burgh of Lanvalley, by whom he had issue. Joan had one sister, Elizabeth, who married Nicholas Netterville, by whom she had issue. Joan FitzGerald's paternal grandparents were Thomas FitzMaurice FitzGerald and Rohesia de St. Michael, and her maternal grandparents were John de La Roche, Lord of Fermoy, and Maud de Waleys (Walsh). The latter was a daughter of Henry le Walleis, Mayor of London.  Marriage and issue  In 1302, Joan married Sir Edmund Butler, Earl of Carrick, the son of Theobald le Botiller (1242–1285) and Joan FitzJohn (FitzGeoffrey) (died 4 April 1303). The marriage produced two sons: * James Butler, 1st Earl of Ormond (1305 – 6 January 1338), who married Lady Eleanor de Bohun (17 October 1304 – 7 October 1363), by whom he had four children, including James Butler, 2nd Earl of Ormond who in his turn married Elizabeth Darcy and had issue, from whom descended the subsequent Earls of Ormond. * John Butler of Clonamicklon In 1307, Sir Edmund and Joan's father dispersed rebels in Offaly who had burnt the town of Leix and destroyed the castle of Geashill. In 1315, Sir Edmund Butler was appointed Justiciar of Ireland. That same year, in July, Joan's husband and her father led the Munster and Leinster contingent of armed forces who were allied with the combined armies of Richard de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster and Felim mac Aedh Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht against the Scottish and Irish troops of Edward Bruce who had been crowned King Of Ireland at Carrickfergus. They were repelled by Bruce, at the River Bann near Coleraine and forced to retreat. Sir Edmund, due to lack of supplies, returned to Ormond. Edward Bruce was later killed in 1318, at the Battle of Faughart. On 1 September 1315, for services against the Scottish raiders and Ulster rebels, Edmund Butler was granted a charter of the castle and manor of Karryk Macgryffin and Roscrea to hold to him and his heirs sub nomine et honore comitis de Karryk. However, the charter, while creating an Earldom, failed to make Edmund Butler's issue Earls of Carrick. Joan's father, John FitzThomas FitzGerald, died a year later on 10 September 1316, several months after being created Earl of Kildare by King Edward II.  Death  Joan FitzGerald died on 2 May 1320 in Laraghbryan, County Kildare. She was the ancestress of the earls of Ormond, the queen consort Anne Boleyn and Diana, Princess of Wales.

Educative mission Academia Maria Reina is a school of the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Brentwood, New York. The educative mission of this congregation has its roots in the mission of Jesus: to evangelize, to heal, to pardon, to redeem and liberate all, through love that achieves union and reconciliation. During the year 2010-2011, the new 7th graders received the record of the most entries in the academy ever in school history. As they say in Academia Maria Reina: \\"Fuerza Conlleva Honor\\", which means \\"Strength Carries Honor\\". The Academia Maria Reina is one of the most prestigious schools for girls in Puerto Rico, where girls are educated by qualified teachers, who are paid an American salary scale above $ 25 per hour to $ 27 an hour. Some of the teachers are indeed qualified but they do not know how to handle preassure or denial: for example one new teacher asked a girl if she had problems with her family one the first day of school. Another one stops the class to answer the phone. There have been cases where the teacher arrives late and blames the students for not working before giving the worksheet and another case is when the students got answers on a test right and the teacher gave them a bad grade because she got the answer sheet mixed up. Philosophy Academia Maria Reina is a Catholic private middle school and high school. It is dedicated to the total development of its students, that aspire to continue university studies and doing so with authentically Christian values. The goal of the school is the growth of its students in the Catholic faith and the development of a critical mind. The final goal is to have students be agents of their own development and simultaneously be at the service of the community in which they live in order for this society to be equal to all. Academia Maria Reina, conscientious of its philosophy, aspires to help develop a well rounded Puerto Rican woman of faith and devoted to her society. From 7-10 grades, the students will many electives as options and they choose one, some of these include dance, art, French, Italian, culinary arts (cooking), theater, creative writing, public speaking, and much more. The students of 11th will receive few electives and will choose two, and the 12th graders choose three electives. Starting in 10th grade, the students will get to learn from different AP courses such as calculus, world history, U.S. history, and more. In each grade in all of the school, the students are given different one-semester classes, such as, in 7th grade, the students pass or fail from Computer Science and English Literature. In 8th grade, the students exercise in Physical Education and Computer Application; in 9th grade, the students take Women Values and Sexuality with 'drafting'; in 10th grade, the students once again have Physical Education and so on. Students also have an 8 day cycle schedule, once a cycle they have guidance class with the grade guidance counselor in which they discuss different things. The school did fund-raising events after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017.

In his 2008 volume Revolutionary Spirits: The Enlightened Faith of America's Founding Fathers (BlueBridge Publishing), Kowalski sought to show that the Founding Fatherss of the United States were neither devout Christians nor secularists but that their views combined religion with the new scientific and intellectual discoveries of the Enlightenment. A graduate of Harvard College and the Harvard Divinity School, Kowalski was the senior minister of Burlington's First Unitarian Universalist Society for over 20 years. While there, he performed about 25 marriage ceremonies each year, including same-sex marriages because Kowalski said that the church should support all long-term, mutually committed relationships. He also served on the Vermont State Advisory Panel to the United States Commission on Civil Rights. In the summer of 2010 Kowalski left Burlington and moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, to begin a 12-month interim ministry for the Unitarian Universalist congregation there. In the following year he became interim minister at the First Parish Unitarian Universalist Church of Sudbury, Massachusetts and subsequently served parishes in Worcester, Massachusetts and Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

Forester about an imaginary series of incidents involving a single eighteen-pounder cannon during the Peninsular War (1807-1814.) The book was first published in 1933 and has as its background the brutal war of liberation of Spanish and Portuguese forces (regular and partisans) and their English allies against the occupying armies of Napoleonic France. As the story begins, the titular huge bronze cannon is abandoned by the remnants of a regular Spanish army retreating after their defeat in the Battle of Espinosa. The local people wish to employ it in their resistance against the French, but are eventually forced to hide it away beneath a pile of stone to prevent its capture. Years later, a group of guerrilleros learn of its location and conscript the locals to outfit it with carriage and train. Over time, the gun is used in battle with ever-increasing success. It falls under the control of a series of guerrilla leaders; each achieves strong leadership through his connection to the gun, and each is eventually killed in some way (captured and executed, killed in battle, killed by rival leaders), until the gun finally comes under the control of the 18-year-old Jorge, who emerges as an untrained but naturally gifted leader and tactician. The exploits of the Spanish irregulars under Jorge eventually lead to the diversion of a large body of elite French troops from reinforcing the army opposing the Peninsular allies under the Duke of Wellington. The loose alliance of guerilleros are scattered but the ultimate defeat of the French invaders is now in sight. The gun is destroyed but has changed history. The book vividly portrays the violence of combat and the brutality displayed by both sides in the Peninsular War. AdaptationsThe novel was made into a movie in 1957, under the title The Pride and the Passion. *It was adapted for radio by Mike Walker on 12 March 2011 and broadcast on BBC Radio 4's Saturday Play program.

James is at centre, top. The prologue begins Incipit... The Leges palatinae (\\"Palatine Laws\\") were the laws governing the functioning of the royal court of the Kingdom of Majorca, promulgated by James III at Palma on 9 May 1337. The Leges were probably conceived to lend weight to James's position as an independent king. The Leges are preserved in an illuminated manuscript with colourful images by an Italian artist of the court officers about their duties.This artist has been dubbed the \\"Master of the Privileges\\". The style of his miniatures has been compared to Memmo di Fillippuccio of the Sienese school. The Leges were translated from Latin and revised as the Catalan Ordenacions de cort by Peter IV of Aragon, after he conquered Majorca, in 1344. The original manuscript was brought with James III to France when he fled Peter's invasion. He there gave it to King Philip VI. It was later given to Philip the Bold and ended up in the Bibliothèque Royale in Brussels. A facsimile edition by Joan Domenge i Mesquida, with an introduction in English describing the artistic value of the manuscript, was published by Indiana University Press in 1994. The Leges are divided into seven sections and are \\"the most elaborate set of ordinances to survive from this period\\".Malcolm Vale (2004), The Princely Court: Medieval Courts and Culture in North-West Europe, 1270-1380, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, ), 202-3.

It can be found in schools hovering over the substrate in rivers and ponds. This species can reach a length of . It is currently the only known member of its genus. Name Due to the lack of fused pectoral fins that is seen in true gobies, T. ocellicauda is not actually a goby and is instead placed in the family Eleotridae. Fish in this family are known as \\"Gudgeons\\". Coloration The Body coloration of T. ocellicauda is blueish and silvery with pink, yellow and black marks along the body and fins. On the sides of the body there are red lateral dotted stripes and a yellow abdomen. On either side of the body, there is a single, large black spot near the start of the caudal fin. Sexual dimorphism Sexual dimorphism is present in Taterundina ocellicauda. The males will be slightly more colorful, develop a large nuchal hump on their foreheads, and will be somewhat larger than the females (7.5 cm as opposed to 5 cm).The females will have a more brightly colored yellow belly and will have a black bar running along the edges of their anal fins. The females also have a more streamlined body shape as opposed to the more round body shape seen in males. Feeding T. ocellicauda exhibit suction feeding as they prey upon insects, insect larvae, and small crustaceans. In captivity they will accept Brine Shrimp and Bloodworms. Reproduction A male T. ocellidcauda guards his young. The males of T. ocellicauda will choose a spawning site, usually a cave or crevice of sorts. The males will then swim in a circular pattern near the entrance to the spawning site and will flare their pectoral fins at passing females. If unsuccessful, the male will attempt to nudge the female into the spawning site. If the female agrees to spawn, she will lay 50-100 eggs within the spawning site where she will stick the eggs to the ceiling and walls of the site with use of adhesive found on the eggs. The male will alternate between fertilizing eggs and ensuring there are no potential intruders near the entrance to the spawning site. Once all the eggs have been laid, the male will chase away the female and assume all parenting responsibilities. The male will fan the eggs with his fins for 8-10 days to ensure that they are well oxygenated and that no fungi will grow on the eggs. After 8-10 days the eggs will begin to hatch and the male will leave. After around 2 days the larvae will begin to swim on their own before reaching sexual maturity at 6-8 months. Captivity T. ocellicauda are a peaceful addition to community tanks of 15 gallons or more. The males may be territorial to other males. Lighting should be low and there should be many places for the Gudgeons to hide and take cover. Ironically, the more cover that is available, the higher the amount of activity by the Gudgeons. PVC pipes can offer excellent spawning sites provided there are numerous plants such as Java found nearby.

The first SAP CRM release 2.0 has been made generally available in November 2000. The current release 7.0 is being updated with quarterly enhancement packs (EHPs) since 2012. In 2007 SAP started to develop a cloud based CRM which has been renamed from Sales on Demand to SAP Cloud for Customer in 2013 . Since 2018 SAP has consolidated all of its cloud based marketing, sales, service and commerce applications as SAP C/4HANA suite.  Overview  After the acquisition of Hybris in 2013, SAP has gradually realigned their CRM strategy mainly to take on the market leader Salesforce.com which is a cloud-based software. In a bid to be more competitive and future focused, SAP has been shifting towards cloud based CRM applications since 2011 rather than traditional on-premises software. Still SAP CRM is being used by thousands of companies and there are according to SAP no plans to sunset the product. SAP has consolidated its CRM applications under the terms \\"Customer Engagement and Commerce\\" (CEC) and since 2018 under \\"Customer Experience\\" (CX). SAP offers a variety of (partially acquired) applications: # Customer Profile Management #* SAP Customer Data Cloud (acquired and formerly known as Gigya) #Marketing #* SAP Marketing Cloud (formerly known as SAP Hybris Marketing) #*SAP CRM Marketing (On Premises) # Commerce #* SAP Commerce Cloud (acquired and formerly known as Hybris Commerce) #Sales #* SAP Sales Cloud (formerly known as Cloud for Sales or C4C) #*Callidus Cloud CPQ (acquired) #* SAP CRM Sales (On Premises) # Service #* SAP Service Cloud (formerly known as Cloud for Service or C4S) #*SAP Customer Engagement Center (formerly known as Hybris Service Engagement Center) #*Core Systems (acquired) #* SAP CRM Service (On Premises) #*SAP CRM Interaction Center (On Premises) # Billing #* SAP Subscription Billing (formerly known as Hybris Revenue Cloud) #*SAP Billing and Revenue Management (On Premises and formerly known as SAP BRIM or Hybris Billing)  History  SAP started working on CRM related capabilities in the early 1990s as embedded CRM modules of the SAP R/3 ERP. The \\"Sales and Distribution\\" (SD) module of SAP R/3 ERP covered functionalities for: * Customer management and Product catalog (MM). * Pre-sales actions for inquiry, activities and quotation management. * Sales order and delivery management * Pricing, tax and billing including credit management SAP offered its first stand-alone CRM software in 2000. The initial release of \\"SAP CRM\\" 2.0 had been pushed by the acquisition of the German salesforce automation specialist Kiefer & Veittinger with its \\"Mobile Sales\\" application. In parallel to the new focus for stand-alone SAP CRM, SAP continued to invest in the embedded CRM scenarios as part of its ERP software in 2005. This allowed SAP in 2007 to copy the CRM codeline from the newly developed cloud ERP SAP Business ByDesign and to create the independent \\"Cloud for Sales\\" and \\"Cloud for Service\\" applications (also known as \\"Cloud for Customer\\"). Another example for this copy and paste approach was the decision to move the SAP CRM codelines for service and sales into the S/4HANA ERP which allowed SAP to offer the new \\"S/4HANA for Customer Management\\" option.

Her primary focus in school was visual arts, yet she also began to become involved in the Baltimore experimental music scene. Although disillusioned by the time she graduated in 1994, Colburn nevertheless decided to stay in Baltimore and further immerse herself in the city’s artistic community.Apfelbaum, Sue. \\"Master of Puppets: Martha Colburn’s Handmade Revolution.\\" RES. Vol. 9, No. 2 March/April 2006. It was around the time of finishing college that Colburn first began to work with film. Her motivation to work with film arose partially from finding 16mm reels of old educational movies.Stevenson, Jack. \\"Super-8 Conquers All: The Films and Attitude of Martha Colburn.\\" The Living Color Movie Magazine. 1999. < >. Acrophobic Babies and Feature Presentation are two early examples of Colburn working within this process. By scratching, tinting, and splicing the film itself, Colburn made her first filmic pieces through her manipulation of appropriated imagery.Gruijthuijsen, Krist. \\"Reloaded: Martha Colburn Interview.\\" Metropolis M Magazine. No. 3 June/July 2007. After discovering Super-8 in 1995, Colburn switched from 16mm to 8mm.

Caffeine Jam is one of her first animated films, while Killer Tunes is animation using marionettes.Colburn, Martha. \\"Filmography.\\" Martha Colburn Official Website. < http://www.marthacolburn.com/index.php?id=7 >. Colburn continues to develop and enrich her animation to an even greater complexity of form, materials, and concepts. During an interview with Metropolis M Magazine, Colburn asserted her love for animation: \\"animation is magical, it’s making gold out of glitter.\\" After ten years of living in Baltimore, Colburn moved to Amsterdam in 2000 after being offered a two-year residency at the Rijksakademie. During her residency, Colburn made numerous films including Skelehellavision, an animated and hand-colored film mixing images of female pornography stars and skulls, and Big Bug Attack, a film whose soundtrack was a collaborative piece between Colburn and German techno artist Felix Kubin. Once finishing up her residency, Colburn spent another three years in the Netherlands making films until returning to the United States in 2005. Once settling between Long Island City, New York and Amsterdam, NL, Colburn began work on films that dealt more closely with American history and its relationship to the country’s foreign and domestic policies. Destiny Manifesto incorporates images of the American frontier with depictions of the conflict in the Middle East. Meet Me in Wichita is a parody of The Wizard of Oz in which Osama Bin Laden substitutes for all of Oz’s characters aside from Dorothy, the story’s heroine. \\"I am making films that work with ideas of the loss of faith, obsession with spectacle, self destructiveness, compulsion for violence,\\" Colburn said in Metropolis M Magazine about her work of most recent years. \\"Inhibition and fear characterize my work, as uninhibited and fearless they may appear.\\" As far as the effects of returning to her native country after spending time in Europe, Colburn believes her work has gotten increasingly concerned with political issues facing the world today. Colburn has also used animation for music videos. She created pieces to accompany the San Francisco-based band Deerhoof’s song \\"Wrong Time Capsule\\" in 2005 and Serj Tankian’s \\"Lie, Lie, Lie\\" in 2007. Yet these projects come as no surprise given the strong relationship Colburn has always had with music. She even created animation for the 2005 documentary about the musician Daniel Johnston entitled The Devil and Daniel Johnston. Colburn’s latest film, Myth Labs, has not just been screened, but also presented as panels of which the film is composed. Collage work Colburn’s style of collage fuses pop culture and political imagery with an aesthetic that is simultaneously fantastical, painterly, and punk rock. Many of her appropriated images are painted over with a diverse variety of paints which integrate them with the drawings and textures that are completely her own. Colburn animated by facing the camera directly downward at the collaged panels below. The \\"hands-on,\\" non- technological quality that defines her process keeps her films at a personal and intimate level. Color is another very important aspect of Colburn’s films. Although her 2006 film Meet Me in Wichita deals with disconcerting subject matter, Colburn still chooses bright colors to define the film’s color scheme. It is these types of contradictions in Colburn’s work which deepen her visual and conceptual complexity.

The film was based on the popular Hollywood Hotel radio show created by gossip columnist Louella Parsons, where Hollywood stars recreated scenes from their latest movies. It was broadcast weekly from the hotel of that name,\\"Notes\\" on TCM.com The film's recreation of the program features Louella Parsons, Frances Langford, Raymond Paige and His Orchestra, Jerry Cooper, the announcer Ken Niles, Duane Thompson and Benny Goodman and His Orchestra. Hollywood Hotel, the film, is now best remembered for the featured song and opening number \\"Hooray for Hollywood\\" by Johnny Mercer and Richard A. Whiting, sung in the film by Davis and Langford, accompanied by Goodman and his orchestra. The song has become a standard part of the soundtrack to movie award ceremonies, including the Academy Awards. Mercer's lyrics contain numerous references, often satirical, to the movie industry and the path to film stardom. Plot Saxophone player and singer Ronnie Bowers (Dick Powell), is on his way to Hollywood, having been signed to a ten-week contract by All Star Pictures. At the airport, his former employer, Benny Goodman, and his band give him a big sendoff, performing \\"Hooray for Hollywood\\". In Hollywood, temperamental star Mona Marshall (Lola Lane) becomes furious when she learns that another actress has landed a part she desperately wanted. As a result, she refuses to attend the premiere of her latest movie. Publicist Bernie Walton (Allyn Joslyn) convinces studio boss B. L. Faulkin (Grant Mitchell) to substitute a double. Bernie chooses Virginia Stanton (Rosemary Lane), who has already worked as a stand-in for Mona. For her escort, Bernie chooses an unsuspecting (and starstruck) Ronnie. The charade works. Everyone, from Ronnie to Louella Parsons to the radio host at the premiere (Ronald Reagan) is fooled. Things take an unexpected turn when Ronnie and Virginia begin to fall in love, wading in a fountain pond and singing \\"I'm Like a Fish Out of Water\\". The next day, Bernie takes Ronnie to lunch at the restaurant where Virginia is working as a waitress, to break the news of his date's real identity. Ronnie and Virginia begin dating. When Mona reads in the newspaper that \\"she\\" was at the premiere with Ronnie, she forces Faulkin to buy the young man out of his contract. Photographer Fuzzy Boyle (Ted Healy) appoints himself Ronnie's agent, and they make the rounds, trying to get his acting career started, without success. The two end up employed at a drive-in. When Ronnie sings during work, director Walter Kelton (William Davidson) is impressed and offers him a job. Ronnie is disappointed to learn, however, that he will not be acting, but only dubbing the singing for Mona's longtime screen partner, Alex Dupre (Alan Mowbray). Dupre's \\"singing\\" impresses the audience at the preview. When Louella Parsons invites him to perform on her radio program, he accepts without thinking. Desperate, All Star Pictures pays Ronnie an exorbitant fee to sing for the actor. However, Ronnie has his own ideas. Virginia (posing as Mona) picks up Dupre in a limousine driven by Fuzzy. The pair drive him out into the countryside so he misses the program. Ronnie substitutes for Dupre and is a hit, so Faulkin decides to re-sign him, at a larger salary.

The studio was sued by both the Campbell Soup Company, who sponsored the Hollywood Hotel radio program, and by the hotel itself, for using the name without authorization. The Hollywood Hotel at its peak had attracted the royalty of Hollywood, such as Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, but it had fallen in prominence by the time this film was made.

Arborloo in Ekwendeni, Malawi An arborloo is a simple type of composting toilet in which feces are collected in a shallow pit and a fruit tree is later planted in the fertile soil of the full pit. Arborloos have: a pit like a pit latrine but less deep; a concrete, ferrocement or other strong floor; a superstructure (toilet house or outhouse) to provide privacy; and possibly a ring beam to protect the pit from collapsing. The pit should remain well above the water table in the soil, so as to not contaminate groundwater. The arborloo works by temporarily putting the slab and superstructure above a shallow pit while it fills. Feces, urine, paper, leaves, other materials for wiping, and potentially anal wash water all go into the pit. After each use, a cup of the excavated soil should be added to help to control smell and flies. When the pit is nearly full, the outhouse and slab are moved to a newly dug pit and the old pit is covered with some of the earth from the new pit and left to compost. A fruit tree or other useful vegetation is planted in the old pit, preferably during the rainy season. Feces are safely stored and converted in the soil, avoiding disease transmission, and do not have to be processed or manipulated by anyone. Instead, fruits on trees are grown, fertilised by human excreta. The arborloo is a type of dry toilet. By using the nutrient-rich soil of a retired pit, the arborloo, in effect, treats feces as a resource rather than a waste product. Arborloos are used in rural areas of many developing countries, for example in Zimbabwe, Malawi and Ethiopia. Design The defecation pit may be circular or square and this may depend on the slab and superstructure. A circular pit is less likely to collapse. The pit of the arborloo is shallow (between 1 and 1.5 meters deep). squat slab covering the drop hole of an Arborloo in Malawi. The slab can be rolled from one location to the next. If the pit is dug by hand it must have a diameter of at least 0.9 meters to accommodate effective digging. The floor should be at least 20 centimeters wider than the pit, to allow for its stability. If the floor is round and unattached to the outhouse, it can be rolled to the new pit. A roof is optional, especially if the floor is made such that rain runoff does not flow into the pit. The advantages of not making a roof include: more light, better ventilation, automatic rinsing with the rain, disinfection via solar ultraviolet radiation, reduced cost, and less weight, See also Ecological sanitation * Reuse of excreta * Treebog, another version *Urine-diverting dry toilet *Waterless urinal A banana plant growing vigorously on an ArborLoo pit.

The casino contains a McDonald's restaurant, as well as a concert stage, on which regular comedy, and musical performances are scheduled. The casino claims its decorative style is Caribbean, but some of the interior decorations would be more accurately attributed to Aztec, Mayan, or other Mesoamerican locations. The exterior of the building is surrounded in artificial palm trees. Casino The gaming area of the casino is divided into two main areas. The first area (which is entered from the south or east entrance), contains a large amount of VLT machines and slot machines. The first area of the casino is connected to the second area via an Aquarium tunnel, which contains many exotic salt-water fish. The second area of the casino contains another section of VLTs, slot machines, and a Table Game area. The table games include Blackjack, Red Dog, Texas Hold'em Bonus Poker, Roulette, Baccarat, Pai gow poker, and Let it ride.

The gallery was presented in a fashion similar to that of a first person shooter, except without the hands and weapon in the viewport. Once an avatar was chosen, the user was placed in the central hub of a virtual space station. The user would see representations of other online users in the station. Users could exit a platform through sliding doors, travel through halls, and find other platforms with groups of people to interact with. The screen was split into several areas including one for messages from the software program itself, a window with a Doom (video game) like 3D interface, a window for chat messages, and a space station map indicating which platform the user currently inhabited. Both a keyboard and mouse were integral parts of the user interface. Worlds Chat team Assembled by Dave Marvit (VP of Production), the original team that put together Worlds Chat consisted of Andrea Gallagher (producer), Dave Leahy, Syed Asif Hassan, and Bo Adler (development), and Jeff \\"Scamper\\" Robinson and Helen Cho (UI and graphics).

Unlike other immersive environments of its day, it worked on lines as slow as 9600 baud. Contributors to the project included David Tolley (music), Wolf Schmidt (documentation), John Navitsky and Scott Benson (operations), Naggi Asmar (quality assurance), and others. Technical Challenges The first release of VRML, a standard for defining virtual reality environments, was less than six months old when Worlds Chat was released. This meant that Worlds Inc. needed to discover and define its own best practices while creating Worlds Chat. The additional speed of dial-up Internet connections naturally placed limitations on the amount of information that could be transmitted to and from the Worlds Inc. servers. An increasing number of users and expanding virtual world increased these pressures. In 2011 Tamiko Thiel, a creative director and producer and Worlds Inc. from 1994 to 1996, wrote an article entitled \\"Cyber- Animism and Augmented Dreams\\" describing the history of virtual worlds, in which she wrote: \\"In the virtual worlds and avatar communities in the mid 1990s we thought we all would start parallel, virtual, online existences in which we could create ourselves anew and realize our personal dreamworlds. The technology however was too awkward, the processors and the Internet connections too slow, and the user base for our worlds never extended beyond a small dedicated community.

Father Gruner's interpretation of that message at times proved somewhat controversial, even among other groups of Traditionalist Catholics. Biography The fifth of seven children, Father Gruner was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to Malcolm and Jessie (née Mullally) Gruner. He graduated from McGill University and obtained a post-graduate degree in theology from the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas in Rome. He was ordained at Avellino, Italy on August 22, 1976 by Bishop Pasquale Venezia. In 1978, he launched a periodical, the Fatima Crusader, dedicated to Our Lady of Fatima, which was at first a journal dedicated to praying the rosary. In the early 1980s the Fatima Crusader began to focus more on Gruner's interpretation of the message of Our Lady of Fatima, particularly regarding the consecration of Russia. Gruner started a radio and television ministry for his viewpoint. By the early 1990s Gruner's media advocacy had resulted in increased membership with claims of four hundred thousand members. Going forward the Crusader continued to argue for the consecration of Russia and maintained that such action was increasingly urgent. In his later years Gruner aligned himself with Catholic traditionalists who maintain that the documents of Vatican II are pastoral, had resulted in failure and should be reversed. Gruner died on the night of April 29, 2015, of a sudden heart attack while working in his Fatima Center office in Fort Erie, Ontario.\\"Father Nicholas Gruner, suspended priest who led Fatima Crusader, dead at 72\\", Catholic World News, May 5, 2015 The Fatima Crusader Gruner and his magazine, Fatima Crusader, took a critical stance toward the compliance of the popes with the message of Fatima, specifically the request for the consecration of Russia. Throughout the 1980s, the Fatima Crusader made repeated allegations that the Vatican had been infiltrated and subverted, and that the Soviet Union was engaging in deliberate deception when it depicted Mikhail Gorbachev and perestroika as initiators of internal Communist reform after the Soviet–Afghan War in the 1980s. In 1988, Gruner urged a letter-writing campaign against arms control talks. The International Pilgrim image of Our Lady of Fátima has traveled the world since the 1950s. When the Soviet Union finally disintegrated in 1991, Fatima groups such as the Blue Army of Our Lady of Fátima and Fatima Family Apostolate rejoiced, regarding this as evidence of the efficacy of the dedication of the world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary that John Paul II had conducted nine years earlier. Gruner and the Fatima Crusader discounted it based on the lack of any spiritual conversion in Russia. Colin Donovan, STL criticized the Fatima Crusader, saying, \\"This magazine also attacks anyone who disagrees with Fr. Gruner's opinions on Fatima, showing contempt for all other Fatima apostles. This includes holy priests like Fr. Robert J. Fox, whose Fatima Family Apostolate has propagated the Fatima message to far greater audiences than Fr. Gruner could ever hope to do\\". Despite subsequent statements by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and by the remaining visionary Sister Lúcia, who is said to have denied Gruner's interpretation that a further consecration of Russia was needed, Gruner's criticisms continued. The Fatima Crusader has suggested that Sister Lúcia was kept from speaking the truth about the message of Fatima. Writer and commentator Carlos Evaristo held Gruner as an example of, in the words of John L. Allen, \\"an exegetical free-for-all that's long percolated in the Fatima underground\\", saying, \\"What happened with the Fatima message is that Sister Lúcia related it but never interpreted it. That left space for all sorts of strange theories.\\" The Southern Poverty Law Center, a non-profit civil rights organization, listed Gruner's Fatima Crusader as a periodical which has published anti-Semitic articles.\\"Society of St. Pius X at Center of Radical Traditionalist Catholic, Anti-Semitic Movement\\"Intelligence Report, Southern Poverty Law Center, No. 124, Winter 2006Potok, Mark. \\"Exploring Radical Traditionalist Catholicism and the 'Synagogue of Satan'\\", Intelligence Report, Southern Poverty Law Center, No. 124, Winter 2006 The Anti-Defamation League identified Gruner as a Holocaust denier who promoted conspiracy theories about the Jews plotting to overthrow Christian civilization, and the Fatima Center as a radical Catholic organization that espoused anti-Semitic views.\\"Ron Paul Glibly Ignores Anti-Semitism\\" , ADL, September 12, 2013 Suspension In 1989 Gruner was ordered by Bishop Gerardo Pierro, his ecclesiastical superior, to return to Avellino, Italy, the diocese of his incardination. When he did not respond, Cardinal Innocenti, Prefect of the Congregation for the Clergy, wrote to warn him that failure to return would result in his suspension a divinis.A priest suspended a divinis loses \\"all exercise of the power of orders obtained through ordination or by a privilege,\\" such as faculties for celebrating Mass and hearing confessions. He did not undertake the action required of him. In 1994, the new Bishop of Avellino issued a decree declaring Gruner a vagus - \\"wandering\\" - priest. In 1996 Gruner was suspended from his priestly functions. He appealed the suspension, but was unsuccessful. In September 2001, the Congregation for the Clergy stated that Gruner's suspension was \\"confirmed by a definitive sentence of the supreme tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura.\\"\\"Vatican Reminder on Suspended Priest\\", Catholic world News, September 12, 2001Levis, Fr. Robert J. \\"Father Gruner is suspended?\\", October 21, 2004 According to the priest himself, he had never been suspended at all. Gruner was subsequently incardinated in the Archdiocese of Hyderabad, but remained suspended.Wilkinson, Ed. \\"Parish Alert on Bayside ‘Apparition’ Event\\", The Tablet\\", Diocese of Brooklyn, June 11, 2014 The Catholic Archdiocese of Toronto and the Diocese of London, Ontario, warned parishioners not to support Gruner's organization.Parker, Akweli. \\"Priest Takes A Controversial Message To Delco\\", Philadelphia Inquirer, February 26, 2001 On October 23, 2012 Gruner, along with attorney Christopher Ferrara, appeared at the headquarters of the European Union in Strasbourg, France to speak in support of a motion for a declaration by the EU Parliament calling upon Pope Benedict XVI to carry out the Consecration of Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. Gruner and Ferrara were invited to speak at a press conference by the sponsors of the motion, MEPs Mario Borghezio and Lorenzo Fontana. Gruner was scheduled to appear at a June 22, 2014 event to mark the 44th anniversary of the alleged apparitions at Bayside, Queens. This event was to benefit St. Michael’s World Apostolate. In response, the Brooklyn Diocese’s Chancellor, Msgr. Anthony Hernandez, sent a communiqué to all pastors warning about a suspended priest who encourages these devotions and was planning an appearance in Queens: \\"Given that Father Gruner remains suspended, and, given that the alleged Bayside apparitions have been rejected by the legitimate ecclesiastical authorities, the faithful are strongly discouraged from participating in any events connected to Father Gruner or St. Michael's World Apostolate.\\" Gruner's opinions regarding the Consecration of Russia, the Prophecy and the Third Secret were publicly contradicted by Fatima Seer Sister Lúcia who rebuked him for misrepresenting her during two genuine video-taped interviews held in 1992 and 1993. These were televised with her written permission on all 3 Portuguese Television Stations (RTP 1, SIC and TVI) during major news broadcasts in 1998, This public disclosure she claimed she had permitted for the purpose of public Clarification given the widely dissiminated misinformation of Gruner and various other Fatima Conspiracy Theorists The video taped interview of 1993 was subsequently distributed in a 3-DVD set produced by Videos RTP entitled Os Mistérios de Fátima. As related in a televised documentary production that aired in Portugal in 2017, several victims of slander and defamation sued Gruner and his cohorts in the Portuguese Courts, in 2001, The defendants who refused to appear in Court were subsequently tried in absentia and found guilty in 2005, of misrepresentation of the Fatima Seer's true opinions and therefore having attacked and defamed various persons who truthfully had disclosed her views.

It is south of the village of East Worldham, and southeast of Alton, just east of the B3006 road. It is in the civil parish of Worldham. The nearest railway station is northwest of the village, at Alton. The settlement appears to have been uninhabited since the 18th century, except for a couple of scattered cottages. Dating from the 12th century, St Leonard's church stands as the only remaining building of the former village. Geography Hartley Mauditt is still an agricultural settlement of some with several large farms, although the medieval village was much larger but has now shrunk down to the parish church of St Leonard and a couple of cottages. The remaining houses include a 17th-century thatched cottage, an old rectory, and the converted village school on the parish boundary adjoining West Worldham. History Hartley Mauditt was first documented in the Domesday Book as \\"Herlege\\" (meaning hartland or woodland); \\"Hartley\\" signifies a pasture for deer. The manor had been granted to William de Maldoit (by corruption rendered Mauditt) by William the Conqueror. Later, it was in the possession of John of Gaunt, the Duchy of Lancaster, the Crown, and then in 1603 to Nicholas Steward (1547-1633). In 1790, the 4th Baronet of Hartley Mauditt, Sir Simeon Henry Stuart, sold the manor to Henry Bilson-Legge whose son pulled down the manor house in 1798. After the demolition of the house the village of Hartley Mauditt declined, and eventually left the church as the only remaining building in the site of the settlement.

Fort Amiel was constructed in 1876 by Major Charles Frederick Amiel and soldiers of the 80th Staffordshire Volunteers. It was built as a fort and \\"look-out post\\", for the British during the run up to the annexation of the former Transvaal and the Zulu War, although it really never served that purpose. During the First Boer War it was used as a garrison for the King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster). Fort Amiel served as a commissariat depot, transit camp and hospital. Many wounded soldiers were taken there, to recover from their wounds. The fort is positioned on a knoll overlooking the original wagon drift across the Ncandu River. It has majestic views of the Drakensberg mountain range and the town of Newcastle. Major Charles Frederick Amiel was born on 2 August 1822, in Hanover Square, London, England. He was christened on 2 August 1822 in St Peter, Chertsey, Surrey, England. Major Amiel died on 10 September 1885 at London, England. He was buried at St Peter, Westminster, London. Amiel never married. The fort and surroundings, including a graveyard below the knoll fell into disuse for many years. In 1979 the site was declared a National Monument and restoration work began after the discovery of the original plans for the fort were discovered during this period in a London Museum. The restoration work was undertaken by the visionary Newcastle Town Council and in conjunction with the Natal Museum Services. Today, Fort Amiel houses an historic/cultural museum. Military displays of the two Anglo-Boer Wars. There is a wonderful cookhouse re-construction, this shows a typical British Army Base found in the 1880s.

This tortoise in the only known member of the genus Chersina. Name and taxonomy This species is highly distinctive and is now classified by itself, in the monotypic Chersina genus. While it differs considerably from all other tortoise species, its closest relatives, according to phylogenetic studies, are the tiny \\"padloper\\" (Homopus) tortoise species, with which it shares its southern African habitat. Internationally it is known by the two names of \\"angulate\\" and \\"bowsprit\\" tortoise. Locally in southern Africa however, it is uniformly known as the \\"angulate\\" tortoise in English, and as the rooipens skilpad (\\"red-belly tortoise\\") in Afrikaans. Description A fully-grown specimen, in its natural fynbos scrub habitat. =Identification= A small, shy tortoise with a relatively variable shell, they can often be distinguished by their prominent \\"bowsprits\\", which are protrusions of the \\"gular\\" shields, from their plastrons under their chins. These are used by males to fight for territory or females. Uniquely, this species has only one gular shield under its chin; all other southern African tortoises have a divided/double scaled gular. Angulate specimens have five claws on their front legs and four on each back leg. They also, like most other southern African tortoises, have a nuchal scute. =Regional variation= There is considerable regional variation in this species of tortoise. Angulates from the west coast of southern Africa tend to have a reddish colour, especially on the underside of their shell (from where their Afrikaans name of rooipens or \\"red-belly\\" comes). Inland specimens from the Karoo region are often darker, and some are known to be uniformly black. To the east of their range, individuals are typically smaller and have a lighter colour. Such tendencies can be diluted by admixture however, and in all populations individuals tend to assume a uniform brown colour in old age. =Sexual dimorphism= This species shows considerable difference between male and female individuals. The male angulates tend to be larger, to have concave bellies, and to have a longer, thinner, \\"peanut\\" shape. They also have enlarged and extended gular scutes under their chins, which they use for sparring with each other. The females tend to be smaller and rounder, with a flat or slightly convex belly. Natural range and threats Distribution map of the angulate tortoise in South Africa and Namibia. Their natural habitat is the fynbos, karoo, albany thickets and coastal scrub (strandveld) vegetation of the south-western part of South Africa. This is an area of semi-arid and Mediterranean climate, with winter rainfall. Within this climatic range however, the angulate tortoise is a tough and very adaptable species. Geographically, this natural range extends across the Cape Floristic Region, as far north as the southern part of Namibia. In addition, small colonies have been introduced by tourists to domestic gardens in Swakopmund and Walvis Bay, even further north, in central Namibia. To the east, its range extends along the Cape's southern coast as far as East London. There is also an especially dense colony on Dassen Island, off the South African coast. Throughout its range, this tortoise usually occurs in the greatest numbers near the coast. Inland it occurs at lesser densities, though smaller populations are even found in parts of the Karoo. Within its natural range, the natural predators of the species include mongoose, jackals, badgers, baboons and predatory birds which attack the infants. Perhaps the largest killers of this species in its natural habitat are the periodic wildfires, which can kill hundreds of thousands at a time. Due to human activity, it is also increasingly threatened by habitat destruction from agriculture and other development, as well as illegal collecting for the pet trade and deaths from tortoises crossing busy roads. Human introduced species such as the pied crow kill thousands of infants every year, especially along the West Coast where this invasive species is rapidly spreading. Human interaction and captivity Angulates are often spotted crossing rural roads and highways. Drivers may stop and assist them in crossing, but are prohibited by law from removing them from their natural area. The angulate tortoise is commonly kept as a garden pet in South Africa. However the species is classified as \\"Protected Wild Animal\\" in the Nature Conservation Ordinance No. 19 (2000), and it is therefore strictly illegal to remove this animal from the wild. It may also not be transported, possessed, imported or exported without a permit. A commonly reported problem is that, when a tortoise is spotted crossing rural roads, drivers tend to stop, pick it up and take it home - away from its habitat in the wild. This is illegal and traumatic for the tortoise. Instead drivers are encouraged to stop and, if they wish, assist it crossing the road in the direction that it was going.http://www.capenature.co.za/news.htm?sm Nonetheless, there is a legal and regulated pet trade in this tortoise, especially for captive-bred specimens. However it is absolutely imperative to attain a permit when buying, selling or keeping this species. =Diet= If kept in a garden, these tortoises need a sizable warm, sunny, dry, well-drained area, with a diverse range of possible plant foods. They naturally eat a wide variety of indigenous South African plants and, if kept in a garden, they require a similarly wide range of edible plants available, on which to feed. They will not stay healthy if fed only one food type, such as lettuce. Plants marked with * are most important to diet. Grasses as for leopard tortoises: Couch grass (Cynodon dactylon) Eastern Province vlei grass (Eragrostis lehmanniana) Dew grass (Eragrostis pseudo-obtusa) Bushman grass (Schmidtia kalahariensis) Carrot grass (Tragus racemosus) Beesgras (Urochloa pantcoides) Veld grass (Ehrhartacalycina) Darnel rye grass (Lolium temulentum) Barnyard grass (Echinochloa crus-galli) Mouse barley grass (Hordeum murinum) Crab finger grass (Digitaria sanguinalis) Dallas grass (Paspalum dilatatum) Wintergrass (Poa annua) Dropseed grass (Sporobolus africanus) Kikiyu grass (Pennisetum clandestinum) Buffalo grass (Stenotaphrum secondatum) Swazi grass (Digitaria swazilandensis) Alfalfa (Lucerne) Weeds: (* are most important) Plantago major (Broad leafed plantain)* Plantago lanceolata ( Buckhorn, narrow leafed plantain)* Taraxacum officinale (Dandelion most important)* Cnicus benedictus (Thistle) Galinsoga parviflora (Small flowered quickweed) Opuntia (most types)* Rubus cuneifolius (Sand bramble) Paperthorn Tribulis terrestris (common dubbeltjie)* Arctotheca calebdula (Cape marigold) Trifolium repens (white clover) Note: becomes toxic when dry. Cerastium capensi (Cape chickweed)* Silybum marianum (Blessed milk thistle) Commelina benghalensis (indigenous wandering Jew)* Clover* Unsuitable plants high in oxalates: Sedum morganianum Sedum frutescens Aracea (arum lily) Amaranthus (pigweed) Begonia spp Oxalis spp Rheum rhabarbarum (rhubarb) Crassulae spp The Chenopodiacea family which includes beet greens, spinach and chard should be avoided as they contain oxalates. =Domestic dangers= Male angulate tortoises \\"jousting\\". Males are very territorial, fight each other at any opportunity, and should preferably not be kept together. If the garden is suburban, then it should be securely walled, so that the tortoise does not wander into the nearby streets and traffic. The property should also not have a swimming pool, as angulate tortoises cannot swim (unlike many larger tortoise species), and will drown if it falls into deep water. Domestic dogs are a threat to captive tortoises, which are often badly injured or killed after being severely chewed on. If kept in groups, females never clash, however males are fiercely territorial and will fight each other at any opportunity. Males should therefore ideally be kept separately from other males. =Sun and temperature= This tortoise, like most reptiles, also needs to be able to regulate its own temperature, by moving between sunny and shady spots. It therefore needs a large garden where it can move about, so as to seek both natural sunlight, as well as shade, when necessary. It needs a dry habitat, as constant moisture is particularly bad for it. =Illegal trade and exports= Like many species of tortoises, the angulate is increasingly threatened by illegal collecting for the pet trade. When transported outside of their natural range and climate, these tortoises usually die. This is partly because they are adapted to the warm, dry, Mediterranean-type climate of the Cape, but also because they require a wide range of plant foods, which they typically do not receive when they are kept as pets by inexperienced keepers.

It is situated approximately south-east from Newark, approximately north-west from Grantham, and just over to the east from the A1 road. History Dry Doddington means the \\"dry estate of a man called Dodda\\". There was a deserted medieval village called 'Stocking' or 'Stockyng' associated with Dry Doddington in the early 14th century; its precise location is unknown. Dry Doddington CE School was built as a National School in 1872, but was closed between 1926 and 1929, after which it re-opened as a primary school. It closed for the last time in 1961. Today, the village forms part of the civil parish of Westborough and Dry Doddington, which had a population of 335 in 2001. Before 1931 Dry Doddington was a separate parish. The village public house is The Wheatsheaf Inn on Main Street.\\"The Wheatsheaf\\", geograph.org.uk. Retrieved 22 July 2011 Geography The village, on a small hill called Lincoln Hill, is surrounded by the River Witham to the west and south. The village of Claypole is to the north and Westborough and Long Bennington to the south. The East Coast Main Line passes 1 mile to the north- east. The Church of St James The parish church, dedicated to St James, has a west-ward leaning tower. It is a Grade II* listed building dating from the 12th century, with an early 14th-century tower. It was restored in 1876. Recent restoration work, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, has brought the 14th century tower back to its former glory. The tower boasts an impressive tilt of 5.1 degrees, leaning more than the Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy which is now tilted at 3.97 degrees.\\"More Tilt than Pisa Tower Could Boost Dry Doddington Visits.\\" BBC News Services. BBC, 12 October 2015. Web. . The church contains a memorial to a No. 49 Squadron RAF Avro Lancaster that crashed near the village on 26 November 1944. The aircraft, called 'O-Oboe', was piloted by F/O Le Marquand (PB432). It had only been in the air for a few minutes before it crashed, laden with bombs and fuel. Whilst five members of the crew survived, Norman Langley, the wireless operator and air gunner, and Edward Blake, the mid-upper gunner, were killed.

It is endemic to the south west region of Western Australia. It usually grows up to between 0.4 and 1 metre in height. Pink flowers are produced between June and November (early winter to late spring) in its native range. The species was initially given the name Leptospermum robustum without description, and later formally described by botanist John Lindley in Edward's Botanical Register in 1843.

Pasinetti (born September 12, 1930) is an Italian economist of the post-Keynesian school. Pasinetti is considered the heir of the \\"Cambridge Keynesians\\" and a student of Piero Sraffa and Richard Kahn. Along with them, as well as Joan Robinson, he was one of the prominent members on the \\"Cambridge, UK\\" side of the Cambridge capital controversy. His contributions to economics include developing the analytical foundations of neo-Ricardian economics, including the theory of value and distribution, as well as work in the line of Kaldorian theory of growth and income distribution. He has also developed the theory of structural change and economic growth, structural economic dynamics and uneven sectoral development. Biography Pasinetti was born on September 12, 1930, in Zanica, near Bergamo, in the north of Italy. He began his economics studies at Milan's Università Cattolica, where he obtained his “laurea” degree in 1954. The thesis that he presented dealt with econometric models applied to the analysis of the trade cycle. As a brilliant student, he won several scholarships for graduate studies which gained him access to University of Cambridge, England (1956 and 1958), Harvard University, United States (1957) and Oxford University, England (1959) for his graduate studies. In 1960 Oxford's Nuffield College granted him a Research Fellowship that he enjoyed until 1962, the year in which he left the University for Cambridge, called there by the prestigious economist Lord Richard Kahn. In those years, Years later, Pasinetti, remembering Kahn in a Memorial Service held at King's College Chapel, University of Cambridge on 21 October 1989, recalled that: Richard Goodwin was also part of this brilliant group of Cambridge economists, and exerted the first important influence on Pasinetti. In conveying the intellectual debt he owed him, Pasinetti writes: In 1960–1961 Pasinetti became a Fellow of King's College. Twelve years later in 1973, he was appointed Reader at Cambridge, a post that he kept until his return to the Università Cattolica Milano in 1976. In March 1963 he was awarded his doctorate degree from Cambridge University with a Ph. Dissertation on \\"A Multi-sector Model of Economic Growth.\\" This thesis was the core of what came to be in 1981 one of his most complete books, Structural Change and Economic Growth. In 1964 he was appointed Professor of Econometrics at the Università Cattolica and in 1981 full Professor of Economic Analysis. Trips between Cambridge and Milan were very frequent during this period. In 1971 and 1975 he was appointed Visiting Research Professor at Columbia University as well as in 1979 at the Indian Statistical Institute in Calcutta and the Delhi School of Economics. Università Cattolica Milano was the university where Pasinetti spent most of his academic life. Back at his Alma Mater, Università Cattolica Milano, he was appointed Chairman of the Faculty of Economics from 1980 to 1983, Director of the Department of Economics (1983–1986) and later Director of the Joint Economics Doctoral Program (comprising three Milanese universities: Università Cattolica, Bocconi University and University of Milan) from 1984–86 and again from 1995-98. The list of academic distinctions and honours he has received till now is long. The most prominent ones are: St. Vincent prize for economics (1979), President of the Società Italiana degli Economisti (1986–89), President of the European Society for the History of Economic Thought (1995–1997), Member of the Executive Committee of the International Economic Association, Member of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, Doctor Honoris Causa at the University of Friburg (1986), Invernizzi Prize for Economics (1997). At present Pasinetti is also Honorary President of: the International Economic Association, the European Society for the History of Economic Thought, the International Economic Association, the European Association for Evolutionary Political Economy, the Italian Association for the History of Political Economy and the Italian Association for the History of Economic Thought. He has also provided valuable contributions to several major economic journals such as editorial advisor to: the Cambridge Journal of Economics (since 1977), the Journal of Post Keynesian Economics (since its founding in 1978), Kyklos (1981), Structural Change and Economic Dynamics (since 1989), and PSL Quarterly Review (2009) to name a few. Pasinetti is currently Emeritus Professor at the Università Cattolica Milano. Theoretical contributions =A mathematical formulation of the Ricardian system= Pasinetti's first major contribution to economics was probably \\"the mathematical formulation of the Ricardian system\\", published in 1960 in a paper now considered classical.As Pasinetti says in Blaug (1999), p. 869, “I began by giving a mathematical formulation of Ricardo’s theoretical system”. The article was published in The Review of Economic Studies, vol. XXVVII, February, 1960. In such work Pasinetti presented a very concise and elegant (and pedagogically effective) analysis of the basic aspects of classical economics. David Ricardo has been one of the most influential economists in the thinking of Pasinetti. At that time, Piero Sraffa had just published The Works and Correspondence of David Ricardo, one of the most masterful editorial works ever to be published in economics; and scholars were wondering how Sraffa's remarkable work could clarify and enrich the interpretation of Classical economics. Pasinetti's mathematical formulation provided a rigorous and clear answer to that question, in particular with reference to two major Classical problems: the theory of value and the theory of income distribution. On this subject, a major stimulus came from a famous paper written by Nicholas Kaldor, in 1956, where Kaldor presented a review of the history of several theories of distribution, covering the period from Ricardo to Keynes.Kaldor, 1973, cap. 10. Although Ricardo's theory (in Kaldor's paper) was without equations, it was the starting point after which economists began to explicitly see the Ricardian model as a coherent whole, susceptible to mathematical formalization. Another influence came directly from Sraffa and concerned the relative prices of goods produced in the economic system made to depend only on the amount of labour embodied in them – the well known labour theory of value. In fact, an early draft of Pasinetti's paper was read by Sraffa, who gave his approval to almost the entire paper: Pasinetti explains that“the more constructive approach is taken of stating explicitly the assumptions needed in order to eliminate the ambiguities”Pasinetti, 1974, p. 1. in the Ricardian model, hence, the reason for the mathematical formulation. In this view, the most straightforward mathematical Ricardian model that can be formulated, with minimal economic complications, is the one in which only one commodity is produced (‘corn’ for instance), and where there are three social classes: capitalists who earn profits, workers who earn wages and landowners whose income comes from the rent of land. This is the way to express Kaldor's model mentioned above.Pasinetti, 1974, p. 23, footnote. Although the Pasinetti model is more general and comprises two sectors (agriculture and manufacturing), it is illuminating to start with the simplest version –a one-commodity model expressed by the following equations:Pasinetti [1977], unlike Pasinetti [1974], chooses this method of gradual exposure. Equation (1.1) shows that output, Y, depends only on the number of workers, N, engaged to work on the land. Three conditions (1.1a) are necessary and help to restrict the meaning of (1.1). Specifically, the first displays that land, when workers are not employed, can produce something or nothing at all. The second condition shows that the marginal product to kick start the cultivation of land must be greater than μ, the subsistence wage; otherwise the system will never start working. The third condition shows the diminishing returns of labour. The following equations show the determination of the quantities of different categories of income: where W are the total wages, x is the wage per worker, K is the capital of the economy, R is the total rents perceived by landowners and B are the total profits that go into the hands of capitalists. The latter are represented as a residual income once the rents and wages have been paid. In these models all the capital is working capital; it is assumed to be composed entirely of advances to workers as wages. Notice, moreover, that expression (1.4), supplemented by technical conditions (1.1a), expresses what still today is called the Ricardian theory of rent. Hitherto we need two more equations to close the model. They are: Ricardian system in terms of marginal product. Equation (1.6) shows that long-term wages tend to subsistence level. Equation (1.7) shows the stock of capital at the beginning of the year. Throughout the construction of his model, Pasinetti insists that he is interested in \\"natural solutions\\" of the Ricardian model, i.e., those to which the system tends to in the long term.Pasinetti, 1974, pp. 11-17. Thus, equation (1.6) does not preclude short- term wage deviations with respect to its natural level. Eventually, note that μ is the only magnitude which is determined from outside the system: it is an amount set by customs and habits of society. This means that the number of workers employed (proportional to population), is determined by the system itself,Pasinetti, 1977, p. 10. unlike what happens in modern theories of economic growth, where the rate of population growth is taken as exogenously given. The previous model allows us to see the basic features of Ricardo's distribution theory. However, no reference can be made to anything about the theory of value, since all the magnitudes are measured in terms of ‘corn’. As Pasinetti says: “where any question of evaluation has not yet arisen, corn being the single commodity produced”.Pasinetti [1974], p 10, foot note; and also Pasinetti [1977], p. 12. However, by enlarging the model to a two-sector model, more remarkable features of Ricardian economics emerge. The two sectors include: the basic goods sector (wage goods called ‘corn’) and a luxury goods sector (called ‘gold’). The whole new model appears as: Equations (2.1) to (2.7) are identical to those of the single sector model, but now they bear added subscripts to differentiate the production of ‘corn’ from that of ‘gold’. Equation (2.8) presents the gold production function which, unlike the ‘corn’ production function, exhibits constant returns to scale. The parameter is the physical amount of ‘gold’ produced by a worker in a year. The next two equations show in monetary (nominal terms) the wage rate (‘corn’) per worker and the rate of profit: where p1 and p2 represent the price of ‘corn’ and the price of ‘gold’ respectively. Pasinetti supposes that the wage rate and the rate of profit are identical in both sectors thanks to free market competition. Note also from (2.10) that only p1 (the price of corn) enters wage determination, since it is assumed that workers in both sectors only receive only 'corn' as wages; in a terminology later developed by Sraffa, ‘corn’ is the only basic commodity produced in the system. The same consideration can be made, from the opposite view, looking at (2.11), since the only capital involved is represented by advances in the form of ‘corn’. Hence K appears as multiplied by p1. The following two equations are Ricardo's implicit assumptions -that the \\"natural price\\" of any good is given by its cost of production: Equation (2.12) allows the determination of the total monetary profitsof the gold industry. Equation (2.13) is much more important. It shows that on balance, the value of output per worker is the same in both sectors. The product of sector 1 (agriculture) is considered free of rents. To achieve this result, both the wage rate and the rate of profit have been considered homogeneous in both sectors, and the capital/labour ratio must also be considered as identical. Pasinetti closes the model with two further equations: Relationship (2.14) simply adopts the amount of ‘gold’ as numeràire; hence, it is equal to unity. Relation (2.15) displays the income distribution between the different social classes. Ricardo supposes that workers spend their entire wages to buy 'corn', capitalists reinvest their profits in capital accumulation, and landowners spend all their rents on luxury goods. The simplicity of this argument about consumption functions for each social class enables Pasinetti to close the whole circuit of income distribution with a single equation. Specifically, (2.15) shows that landowners spend all their income received as rents, p1R, in the buying of luxury goods, p2X2. There is no need for more equations, since “the determination of the demand for one of the two commodities (gold in our example) also determines, implicitly, the demand for the other commodity (corn), since total output is already functionally determined”.Pasinetti, 1977, p. 14. theory of labor value Marx also supposes an identical labor-capital ratio in all sectors. The system presented above (15 equations with 15 unknowns) displays the natural solutions of the Ricardian economic system, i.e. those solutions attained in the ong term and corrected for market distortions and imbalances in the short term. Ricardo did not deny the existence of such deviations, but for his analysis, they were not the relevant issues. These solutions, furthermore, as demonstrated mathematically by Pasinetti exist, they are unique, and, moreover, their steady state solutions are stable.Pasinetti, 1974, see appendix. On the other hand, it can be demonstrated that if we take the partial derivatives of all variables with respect to K, (because the process of capital accumulation is what matters for the dynamics of the model) the evolution of the variables is consistent with the conclusions which Ricardo reached; especially with the tendency of the whole economic system in the long run towards a stationary state. The above model has several outstanding aspects. The foremost of which is a theory of income distribution entirely independent of the theory of value. The inclusion of a new sector -and consequently the whole structure of relative prices- have not even slightly changed the way income is distributed among landowners, workers and capitalists. At the same time, prices though of course not equal to, are exactly proportional to the quantity of labour embodied in each commodity. This is a perfectly clear labour theory of value. The attentive reader may notice that the two major results (on income distribution and on value respectively) depend on two assumptions that are implicit in the formulation of the model, i.e. of the above set of equations, namely: 1) that capitalist appropriate the whole surplus of the economic system, after paying rents to landowners, and conventional wages to workers; and 2) that the proportion of labour to capital is exactly the same in all sectors. These two assumptions have given rise to endless discussions on value and distribution ever since. Further work undertaken by Pasinetti's has been concerned with reversing the causal chain of the first assumption and in rendering the second assumption superfluous. =The Cambridge equation and Pasinetti’s theorem= Kaldor's 1956 article already mentioned above (“Alternative Theories of Distribution”) was at the origin of another ‘seminal’ paper written by Pasinetti. Kaldor had reviewed the major theories of distribution throughout the history of economics from Ricardo to the Marginalists and even to Kalecki. But then, he added a theory which he named the Keynesian theory of income distribution. This was a surprise because these issues were never treated by Keynes in an explicit way. Kaldor baptized his theory as ‘Keynesian’ because it succeeded in catching a few important concepts both from Keynes's Treatise's widow's cruise allegory and from Kalecki's profits equation. In any case, in this paper Kaldor reached remarkable results. Starting from a closed economic system, without government, and in which there are capitalists and workers, starting from the saving-investment identity, Kaldor came to the following identity between investments and savings: where Y is the national income, P is the volume of total profits, sw is the workers propensity to save, sc is the capitalists’ propensity to save and I is investment. If we suppose that workers do not save (sw=0), divide both members by K and remember that in dynamic equilibrium I/K = gn, we get: where gn is the natural rate of growth and k is the capital/output ratio. Finally, note that these two expressions only have economic significance in the range: This interval excludes equilibrium with negative shares, either by the workers (first inequality) or by the capitalists (second inequality). The expressions (3.1) and (3.2) are those that have subsequently formed the core of the post-Keynesian distribution theory; but only after an extremely hard- fought debate. Equation (3.1) shows that the share of profitsin total output depends positively on the natural rate of growth and the capital/output ratio and negatively on the propensity to save of the capitalist class. The second of these relations, (3.2), better known as the “Cambridge equation”, shows that the profit rate is solely determined by the ratio of the natural rate of growth and the propensity to save of capitalists. The importance of these expressions became clear only after an intense debate. These expressions were achieved with an additional assumption that was heavily criticized. Kaldor's assumption was that the workers propensity to save was zero. King's College, University of Cambridge. Specifically, if you eliminate this assumption, the above formulas lose their conciseness, depending on the propensity to save of workers. This assumption was explicitly criticized because, whatever justification it might have had in the early days of industrialization, it appeared to have no sense in contemporary times. If you eliminate this assumption, the above formulas lose not only their conciseness, but also their applicability to the industrial systems of our own days. Pasinetti went into this debate with his 1962 paper.The Review of Economic Studies, vol. XXIX, nº4, October 1962,Rate of profit and Income Distribution in Relation to the Rate of Economic Growth. With his now famous Pasinetti Theorem, he achieved the result of re-stating Kaldor's original equations without the need to rely on Kaldor's much criticized assumptions. It is worth quoting the first time that Pasinetti presented his views about these issues to an audience: In his 1962 paper, Pasinetti showed that Kaldor had fallen into a \\"logical slip\\". He implicitly assumed that the total profits only came from the capitalists and he neglected the workers. In other words, \\"By attributing all profits to the capitalists it has inadvertently but necessarily implied that worker's savings are always totally transferred as a gift to the capitalists\\".Pasinetti [1962], p.270. That is to say the saving function of Kaldor's model ought to be modified so as to include both workers’ profits and capitalist profits, i.e.: Under this assumption the Investment = Savings identity becomes: If this expression is cleared as before, we see that formal results are similar to (3.1) and (3.2), but now they only refer to that part of profits that accrue to the capitalists. Specifically, the modified Cambridge equation would take this peculiar form: Note that the preceding equation now shows not the profit rate of the economy, P/K, but a ratio, Pc /K, which has no economic significance if taken as such. To fix this anomaly, Pasinetti added Pw /K, to both sides of the equality: To complete the formulation, Pasinetti simply assumes that, in the long-term, the variable i, representing the interest rate earned by workers when they lend their savings to capitalists, is equal to the profit rate, P/K. Taking that into account and simplifying, we obtain: i.e., exactly the preceding (3.2) equation. In other words, we obtain the “Cambridge equation” again, but this time without the assumption sw = 0. By a similar procedure Pasinetti shows that the share of total profits in total income again emerges the same as (3.1); i.e., the Pasinetti Theorem proves that in the long run, the propensity to save of the workers has no effect on the determination of the overall profit rate of the economy, and also has no effect on the determination of the share of the total profits in the national income. At the same time, however, the propensity to save of the workers determines the distribution of profits between workers and capitalists. With these outcomes, the truly important point is that Kaldor's original formulae are much more general than was previously believed. As Pasinetti says, “the irrelevance of worker’s propensity to save gives the model a much wider generality than was hitherto believed. Since the rate of profit and the income distribution between profits and wages are determined independently of sw, there is no need for any hypothesis whatever on the aggregate savings behaviour of the workers.\\" Pasinetti [1974], p. 112. The conclusions obtained from Pasinetti's Theorem led to a huge number of scientific works and papers, with the purpose of clarifying the nature of the Theorem and its more important implications. Specifically, in 1966, Paul A. Samuelson and Franco Modigliani, the MIT economists, wrote a detailed and widely quoted paper where they tried to minimize the consequences of the Pasinetti Theorem and to lessen the generality of its conclusions.Samuelson y Modigliani [1966], “The Pasinetti Paradox in Neoclassical and More General Models”, The Review of Economic Studies, pp. 269-301. The argument centered on the inequality shown above, crucial to the solution of the Cambridge equation, namely on: Samuelson and Modigliani proposed that the following inequality (which they called anti- Pasinetti's inequality) was also reasonable, and claimed that it would endow the model with greater generality: Such inequality, however, requires that the workers' propensity to save becomes so high as to allow them to accumulate capital at a greater speed than capitalists. If this were to happen, in the end the total capital of the economy would entirely be owned by the workers, while the capitalists would disappear. The formulation of the anti-Pasinetti range and all theoretical justification (and some empirical exercises) proposed by Samuelson and Modigliani was challenged by PasinettiPasinetti [1974], essay 6. and in a much more critical way by KaldorKaldor, N. [1966], “Marginal Productivity and the Macroeconomic Theories of Distribution: Comment on Samuelson and Modigliani”, Review of Economic Studies, XXXIII, October, pp. 309-19. and Joan Robinson. Franco Modigliani. Kaldor founded his criticism on the lack of realism of the assumptions made by Samuelson and Modigliani, while performing a remarkable study on the empirical values of the saving propensities of workers and capitalists (based on data from National Accounts for United States and United Kingdom). Kaldor concluded that, “unless they make a more imaginative effort to reconcile their theoretical framework with the known facts of experience, their economic theory is bound to remain a barren exercise.” Harcourt y Laing [1977], p. 302. Pasinetti preferred, with his reply to Samuelson and Modigliani, to remain at a higher level of analysis – by pointing out the weaknesses of the logical analysis of the two MIT economists. Nonetheless Pasinetti joined Kaldor's critique concerning the highly restrictive assumptions made by the neoclassical economists: For Pasinetti, the principal issue of the debate is the way in which technology is defined. If sw < gnK/Y the Cambridge equation would still stand, regardless of which assumption is made about the technology (i.e., whatever the form of the production function), while if sw > gnK/Y, the shape of technology does play a crucial role, so that “The Meade-Samuelson-Modigliani’s marginal productivity results only follow on particular and unacceptable assumptions on technology.”Pasinetti [1974], p. 131 footnote. Pasinetti went on to argue that, even with the particular and unacceptable assumptions on technology, the Samuelson-Modigliani range of applicability would hardly have any practical significance. In fact, even though the Cambridge equation might not exactly determine the rate of profits, it would nevertheless determine its upper limit. First, the rate of profit (whatever way it is determined) cannot be higher than gn/sc. Secondly, the rate of profit cannot be lower than gn (for, if it were, that would mean that individuals would contribute more to economic growth than they receive in exchange for profits, which is patently an absurdity). So, even if in the range of Samuelson and Modigliani the rate of profit were to be determined by the marginal productivities (and not by the Cambridge equation as in the general case), its scope would be extremely limited, being confined to a quasi knife-edge range: =The Cambridge equation with the public sector= Already in the 70's the debate of the original Pasinetti Theorem, and hence the Samuelson-Modigliani's interval, took a turning point, by reaching a second phase in which “many authors proceeded to relax assumptions, trying out new hypotheses and introducing complications of all sorts”.Pasinetti [1989], p. 25. Indeed, already in the 60s some economists, inspired by Kaldor's paper of 1966, began to introduce in the Cambridge model some issues related to financial assets, interest rates and the functioning of financial markets and big corporations.Panico y Salvadori [1993], part V. All these contributions, as well as those which were made later in the 1970s and 1980s, were made in order to give the Cambridge model a wider applicability and more explicit realism. It was in 1972, thanks to a remarkable paper by Steedman, that the public sector was explicitly included in the Cambridge equation.Steedman [1972]. Though 16 years had elapsed since the original paper by Kaldor, no formal attempt had been made in that period to introduce the government sector and its ensuing complications. The case is more striking if one considers that Kaldor was an expert adviser on tax issues, tax theory and public finance. This is due to the aforementioned fact that throughout that period the economists were mainly concerned about the analytical properties of the outcome of the Pasinetti Theorem. In fact, Steedman's 1972 paper was an original and very constructive way to resolve the theoretical dispute between Pasinetti and Samuelson-Modigliani. Steedman showed that if the public sector was considered, under the assumption of budget equilibrium, the long run solutions were consistent with Pasinetti's solutions, and never with the \\"dual\\" solutions of Samuelson-Modigliani. This means that the introduction of the public sector meant that the profit rate remained independent of the workers propensity to save and of the capital- output ratio (technology). The \\"enlarged Cambridge equation\\" at which Steedman arrived was: where tp is the tax rate (average and marginal) on profits. In the case that tp=0 (there are no taxes on profits), we obtain the original Cambridge equation. As it can be easily seen, neither the workers' propensity to save, nor technology, nor even the tax rate on wages affect to the rate of profit of the economy, and hence they do not affect to the distribution between wages and profits. Pasinetti entered the debate again in 1989 showing that -whether the government's budget was in deficit or surplus- the main results of the Cambridge equation hold. If the government budget was not balanced, the Cambridge equation would take the following form: where s’c is a “propensity to save of capitalists corrected”, meaning that it takes into account both the direct taxation on profits and the indirect taxation, ti (on capitalists' consumption) as well as the government propensity to save, sT, i.e.: Although the expression of the capitalists’ propensity to save is not as simple as the original, the truly remarkable thing is that no matter what hypothesis are adopted about the government budget, the Cambridge equation continues to hold, by depending on the natural rate of growth divided by the capitalists' propensity to save, independently of workers' propensity to save and the technology.Pasinetti [1989], p. 30. Equation (4.1) - and (4.2) - can be viewed from another point of view: they can be expressed in terms of profit after taxes: The long-run rate of profits is given by the natural growth rate divided by the capitalists’ propensity to save, independently of anything else. That is to say, the original Cambridge equation can be said to refer to the rate of profit net of taxes, not to the rate of profit before taxes. The most important conclusion to be drawn from this analysis is that if we consider two identical economies (with the same natural rate of growth and saving propensities), if the first has a higher tax rate on profits, the second economy will enjoy a higher rate of profits before taxes (and also a higher share of profits in total income). That is to say, the presence of government has a redistributive effect per se in favour of profits and against wages. This important and surprising conclusion should not sound new, for, as stated by Pasinetti: =The Controversy on the theory of capital= Alongside the contributions made to the Cambridge model of growth and income distribution, in the 1960s, Pasinetti joined what has become known in economic literature as the controversy on capital theory between the two Cambridges: i.e., Cambridge (United Kingdom), whose most prominent scholars were Joan Robinson, Luigi Pasinetti, Piero Sraffa and Nicholas Kaldor and Cambridge, Massachusetts (U.S.A) whose members were Paul Samuelson, Robert Solow, David Levhari and Edwin Burmeister. Controversies over the nature and importance of capital were not new. In the early 20th century, the economist John Bates Clark, in an effort to refute Marx’s surplus theory, suggested that wages and profits (or rather interest, as they were called by Neoclassical economists, owing to their assumption that rate of profit and rate of interest coincide) were simply considered as prices, obtained from the marginal productivity of the factors of production; a theory synthesized by J.B. Clark’s famous statement, that \\"what a social class gets is, under natural law, what it contributes to the general output of industry\\".Cohen A. y Harcourt G. [2003], p. 211. In this debate, Veblen and Böhm-Bawerk were also involved, proposing slightly different, but basically similar, theories to that of J. B. Clark. In 1930 Hayek re-opened the debate by linking lower interest rates with more indirect methods of production, i.e., with higher capital/labor ratios. Since the interest rate was for Hayek the price of capital, it was clear that Hayek (as all Neoclassical economists) thought that lower interest rates would lead to more capital-intensive production methods. With the outbreak of the Great Depression, the debates over capital theory were abandoned, and it was not until 1953, due to a paper by Joan Robinson, that the topic was again given prominence. Robinson opened the controversy with a now famous statement, with which she exposes the main problems of the traditional concept of capital as follows: A neoclassical production function. Although initially the debate was focused on the measurement of capital, more basic questions quickly began to emerge concerning the validity of the neoclassical production functions. If capital could be measured in some way, and if one assumed constant returns to scale, diminishing marginal productivities, given technology, competitive equilibrium and the production of a single good, the production function allowed getting three noteworthy conclusions:Harcourt [1975].Also Cohen A. y Harcourt G. [2003], p. 201. # A rate of interest determined by the marginal productivity of capital. # A monotonic inverse relationship between the rate of profit and the capital-labor ratio, namely the possibility of relating the rate of profit to the listing of a set of monotonically ordered production techniques. # A distribution of income between wages and profits explained by the marginal productivities of the factors of production, as related to their scarcity. The assumption of the production of a single good was crucial, as it allowed the measurement of capital in physical units while no valuation problem arose. However, in a model with many goods (heterogeneous capital), the possibility of aggregation could not be avoided and always remained very problematic. In 1962 Paul Samuelson wrote an important paper, which preceded and in fact provoked the subsequent debate. He proposed to solve the problem of the aggregation of capital through a new concept, the surrogate production function. “What I propose to do here is to show that a new concept, the ‘surrogate production function’, can provide some rationalization for the validity of the simple J. B. Clark parables which pretend there is a single thing called ‘capital’ that can be put into a single production function and along with labor will produce total output.” Harcourt, G. and Laing N. (eds.) [1971], p. 214. Paul Samuelson. The problem is that in this way, in order to add capital and put it into an aggregate production function, one must assess the capital as a stream of discounted monetary flows to be produced in the future; which implies an interest rate. The possibly adverse effects of changes in interest rates on capital value are basically two: the re-adoption of earlier discarded techniques (reswitching) and capital reversing. Reswitching is basically the possibility that the same method of production may became the most profitable one at more than one rate of profit, i.e., a production method may become the most profitable one both at low and at high rates of return, even when in the medium range it is dominated by other methods. Capital-reversing occurs when moving from one technique to another, the technique chosen at a lower level of the rate of profit requires less capital value while earlier it required more capital value. Pasinetti published a famous article in the Symposium of the Quarterly Journal of Economics in 1966, which was actually an adaptation and expansion of an article that was presented to the First World Congress of the Econometric Society in Rome one year earlier. Pasinetti set out to show that the theorem stated a year earlier by David Levhari and Paul Samuelson, which was supposed to demonstrate the impossibility of reswitching at the aggregate level, was false. Although in 1960 Sraffa had shown that reswitching was a possibility, no one had considered in depth such contribution. As Pasinetti said at the beginning of his 1966 article: Later he adds: “This result, owing to its theoretical implications, has been rather worrying; and there has been a general reluctance to consider it.” The paper begins by setting a numerical example that shows -by constructing two alternative techniques- that even satisfying all Levhari and Samuelson hypotheses, reswitching is a possibility at the aggregate level. Then Pasinetti set up a theoretical analysis to find out where the error was in Levhari's proof. Clearly, if the numerical example above refuted the theorem –as it did-, “It means that their logical arguments must have gone wrong at some stage”.Pasinetti [1966], p. 510. The conclusions of the article were truly remarkable, for if a monotonic relationship between profit rate and capital-labour ratio could not hold, the production function concept was meaningless. Therefore, he concluded that: Robert Solow. Pasinetti's other major contribution to the debate on capital theory was a 1969 paper titled “Switches of Technique and the ‘Rate of Return’ in Capital Theory”. In this paper, Pasinetti showed that the concept of the rate of return on capital, introduced by Irving Fisher, and resumed and used by Solow in 1967 as a means of rescuing the neoclassical capital theory, had no economic significance. Whichever of the two definitions given by Fisher on the rate of return was accepted, one of them was an accounting expression Harcourt, G. and Laing N. (eds.) [1977], p. 266. and in the other (in order to say anything on interest) would entail accepting a rather unobtrusive postulate in order to avoid the problem of reswitching.Harcourt, G. and Laing N. (eds.) [1977], p. 276. That is, the concept of “rate of return”, which Solow thought was the central concept of the theory of capital, had no autonomous theoretical content. The conclusion of the article is an illuminating summary of the results concerning the debate on the theory of capital: =Lectures on the Theory of Production= Lectures on the Theory of Production first appeared in Italian in 1975.Lezioni di teoria della produzione, Societá editrice il Mulino, Bologna, 1975. Already in 1956 some parts of the book circulated in the form of lecture notes in several Italian universities. The insistence of students to give these notes a more structured and compact form prompted Pasinetti to compile these lectures, enlarging them and then bringing them to the form in which the book appeared. This is the main reason why the Lectures on the Theory of Production turned out to be the most successful of his publications didactically (translated in French, Spanish, German and Japanese). The English version, appeared two years later, in 1977 and maintained the character and the structure of the Italian version, although Pasinetti added some enlargements, in the form of more sections and new appendices. At a theoretical level, Lectures on the Theory of Production is a book dedicated to the analysis of the theory of production, that is, the way in which societies produce wealth and then how it is distributed. It is curious to notice the unusual way in which Pasinetti introduced his Theory of Production. He begins Chapter I by contrasting two possible definitions of wealth: Quesnay's Tableau Economique is considered the theoretical background of modern Input-Output analysis. François Quesnay. In fact, the understanding of wealth as a stock can be useful for investigations at the level of single individuals; but at the macroeconomic level, it is wealth as a flow that is the most relevant concept. Therefore, Pasinetti considers it as a great contribution – made already by the Physiocratic school of 18th century France – to have concentrated on the concepts of surplus and economic activity presented as a circular flow in the Tableau Economique, devised by François Quesnay. The Physiocratic ideas were developed by the Classical economists in Scotland and England and then by Marx. All of them saw the importance of production and wealth as a flow concept and further developed the Physiocratic ideas. Curiously enough, the Marginalist revolution of the late 19th century preferred to go back to study the concept of wealth as a stock, thus largely de-emphasizing the problems of production and distribution, and to focus on models of \\"pure exchange\\". From this point onwards, Pasinetti develops and presents, in a terse way, a truly Classical theory of production. This book became a book from which a whole generation of Italian students (and in some universities also non-Italian students) have learnt the theoretical scheme of Piero Sraffa, expressed in matrix notation (with a mathematical appendix devoted to the basic elements of matrix algebra) and the Input-Output analysis of Wassily Leontief. In chapters 4, 5, and in an Appendix to Chapter 5, Pasinetti respectively deals with the Leontief model, with the Sraffa system, and Marx's transformation problem. He shows how, although the Leontief model and the Sraffa system were designed for different purposes, the former as an empirical tool and the latter as a theoretical framework, both have their basis in Physiocracy and Classical economics. The greatest theoretical achievement of the Sraffa system, Pasinetti says at the end of chapter 5, is that: The last two chapters are useful summaries of problems Pasinetti has dealt with extensively throughout his career. Chapter 6 explains some of the controversies on capital theory, the problem about reswitching and its implications for traditional economic analysis. In an appendix to chapter 6, Pasinetti also touches on linear programming. He points out that “unfortunately, linear programming was all too quickly constrained within the limits of traditional marginal analysis and lost its driving force”.Pasinetti [1977], preface. Chapter 7 is an introduction to dynamic production models and their implications for the theory of distribution. Pasinetti exposits his own contributions to this field as a summary of the Von Neumann model, showing both its merits and limitations. For the sake of brevity Pasinetti does not present here his contributions to the field of structural change. But, this last chapter can be considered a proper introduction to his book Structural Change and Economic Growth, where all the problems of structural dynamics are widely discussed. =Structural Change and Economic Growth= In 1981 Structural Change and Economic Growth appeared. It was a book that had been in gestation since 1963, when Pasinetti presented his PhD thesis at Cambridge on \\"A Multi-Sector Model of Economic Growth\\". Five of the nine chapters of the thesis had earlier been published in a long article in 1965.“A New Theoretical Approach to the Problems of Economic Growth”, Pontificiae Academiae Scientiarum Scripta Varia, núm. 28, Ciudad del Vaticano, 1965, pp. 571-696. Afterward, Pasinetti rewrote and added some chapters to reach the total of 11 chapters with which the book appeared. This book is a theoretical investigation on the long-term evolution of industrial systems. According to Pasinetti, such work surged from: Leaving aside for a moment the technical aspects, we can say that overall the book is completely new for three reasons. To begin with, this was the first book to offer a unifying framework and a consistent alternative to that proposed by the Neoclassical theory. The latter strand of theory, which began in 1870, tried to explain the economic reality from a simpler view (exchange) under assumptions and analytical tools that were very restrictive, although its authors had the advantage that, “they have always clearly presented their arguments around a unifying problem (optimum allocation or scarce resources) and a unifying principle (the rational process of maximization under constraints).\\"Pasinetti [1981], p. 19. It was therefore natural that contributions made in isolation and apart from Neoclassical economics were either discarded or transformed, doctored to fit into the neoclassical model. Pasinetti's purpose is therefore to offer an alternative paradigm and unify these theories in a new and solid set, which incorporates the contributions of Keynes, Kalecki, Sraffa, Leontief, the macrodynamics models of Harrod and Domar and the distribution theory of the post-Keynesian economists in Cambridge: the whole lit and dotted with some of the theories, ideas and concerns of the classical economists. The second important point is that it is the first work in which Pasinetti does not solve a specific problem in isolation, but tries to offer a global vision of the economic process and integrates all the contributions he had made before. In this book we can find his ideas about Classical economics, income distribution, capital theory and the theory of joint production, all of them sorted out and assembled in order to explain the dynamics of industrial societies. The third point is of a methodological nature, and is probably the most important of all. Following the Classical economists, Pasinetti thinks that it is possible to frame the study of natural economic systems, i.e., economic systems free of institutions. In these natural systems it is possible to deduce a series of characteristics, principles and general laws, which are independent of the institutions that have to be introduced in later stages of investigation. These institutions are the ones that shape the features of real economic systems: for instance, a capitalist system or a socialist system. As he says, “is a distinctive feature of the present theoretical scheme to begin by carrying out the whole analysis at a level of investigation which the Classical economists called ‘natural’, that is to say, at a level of investigation which is so fundamental as to be independent of the institutional set-up of society”.Pasinetti [1981], p.xii. Despite the high degree of abstraction of analysis, this method can provide answers to many real-world practical problems: The six first chapters of the book provide the analytical core of the work. In them, Pasinetti sets the conditions for an economy with neither unemployment nor idle production capacity. Pasinetti's analysis always runs from the simple to the more general models. Thus - after studying the equilibrium conditions in the short run in chapter 2 - in chapter 3 he analyzes the most simplest of all growth models: population grows at a steady percentage rate, while technical, and demand coefficients (i.e., consumer preferences) remain constant over time. With these assumptions, two types of conditions are necessary to reach the full employment of resources: the first one is a macroeconomic condition: total expenditure must be equal to total income; and the second is a set of sectoral conditions: each sector must have a rate of accumulation of capital sufficient to cover demand growth. Roughly, this is a series of ‘Harrod- Domar equations’: a specific Harrod- Domar equation must be satisfied in each particular sector.Pasinetti [1981], p. 54 The most important outcome of this analysis is that Pasinetti shows that, under such assumptions, it does not matter whether the analysis is carried out in macroeconomic terms or -in a more disaggregated way- in sectorial terms. As the system expands, while its proportions remain constant, the analysis does not lose any generality if carried out in aggregate terms. So, this is the case to which macroeconomic models of growth can be correctly applied. \\"If the whole structure of the economic system were really to remain constant through time, any disaggregated formulation would not provided us with particularly useful insights, besides those that are provided already by the corresponding, much simpler, macroeconomic formulations.\\"Pasinetti [1981], p. 60. Chapters 4 and 5 are devoted to the elaboration of a really relevant general multi-sector dynamic model. While chapter 5 is devoted to the exposition of such a model, in chapter 4 Pasinetti displays one of the most important ideas of the whole book: not only does technical progress affect the production methods of the economy, it also generates changes in the composition of demand. The way in which Pasinetti introduces the dynamic behaviour of demand over time is an up-dated resumption of Engel's Law, which when generalized states that higher and higher levels of income lead to constantly changing consumption patterns. This way of looking at the demand side allows Pasinetti to reach three notable findings. The first is that learning is an individual characteristic which is more basic and more realistic than the rational behaviour postulated by traditional economics. If income changes over time -and thus consumer preferences also change- consumers must continually be learning about new goods to consume. This implies that, “we can never expect each consumer to make the best possible consumption decisions”.Pasinetti [1981], p. 76. The second finding is that because of changing consumer preferences over time, it is inevitable that (short term) sectorial imbalances will arise due to the changing structure of the demands for goods. Therefore, this will be a permanent source of disequilibrium in the system. The third finding is that demand is going to play a major role in determining the structure of the main macroeconomic variables over time. Even through the formation of long-term prices, demand has a vital role to play in shaping the production quantities: The second part of the book, from chapters 7 to 11, develops all the consequences derived from the dynamic model of chapters 4 and 5. The long term evolution of the major variables is explained in its composition: employment, wages, profitsand capital/output and capital/labour ratios. Chapter 8 also provides a drastic distinction between the interest rate and the profit rate; and this closes the theoretical framework of the entire book and makes it particularly complete and compact. The last chapter (11) takes the conclusions and the scheme of the model in chapter 5 and applies them to international economic relations. This chapter appears as slightly different from the rest of the book, because it is devoted to analyzing economic systems with international trade and economic relations in general. It is a chapter that deals with open economies that not only trade with other economies, but try to import knowledge and know-how. Pasinetti argues that the main benefits of international relations are in fact not so much those that derive from trade as those that derive from the international learning process between countries. Developing countries can strongly benefit from international relations if they succeed in imitating production methods from the developed countries. This is an encouraging possibility but has its limitations. Developing countries may not always be prepared to absorb all the technical methods of the developed countries because their lower levels of per capita income cause (according to Engel's law) the goods demanded in these countries to be different from those that are demanded in developed countries. The latter generally are not only much more sophisticated, but such as to require facilities that are not yet available in developing countries. In addition, Engel's law may require a strict order in consumption decisions. The last paragraph of the book gives an excellent summary of the contents and the tone of Pasinetti's book: In 1993, Pasinetti returned to the problems of structural dynamics with a beautifully compact book (Structural economic dynamics – a theory of the economic consequences of human learning). Scant attention has been paid thus far to this book. The book explores the complex inter-relations between the structural change of production, of prices and of employment as a necessary consequence of human learning, by carrying out the whole analysis in terms of a “pure labour model”, i.e., a model in which labour, to be intended as human activity in general, is the only factor of production. This book has (incorrectly) been interpreted as an extreme simplification of the process of structural dynamics, and this may explain why it has been neglected so far. But in fact, it goes to the very heart of the complex movements that are taking place in post-industrial societies as an effect of the accumulation and diffusion of knowledge. When these aspects will be fully understood, it may well emerge as containing the most fundamental of all the theoretical concepts thus far conceived by Pasinetti to interpret the basic economic features of the newly shaped world in which we live. =Vertically integrated sectors and their importance for the dynamic analysis= The deep study developed by Pasinetti in Structural Change and Economic Growth on the dynamics of growth of industrial systems led to the development of an entirely new analytical tool: the concept of vertically integrated sectors. In fact, in the 1965 paper, from which Structural Change was later developed, the notion of vertically integrated sector was already present, though more as a simplifying assumption than as a really important analytical concept. The publication of Sraffa's book Production of commodities by means of commodities in 1960 motivated Pasinetti to reflect on the importance of such a concept. As pointed out by Pasinetti: Piero Sraffa In 1973 Pasinetti published a paper, \\"The Notion of Vertical Integration in Economic Analysis\\", which would be a milestone for the development of all the analytical implications of the concept and its relation to the inter-industry theoretical schemes of Input-Output type. The concept of vertically integrated sector is implicitly contained in the work of many economists. Most macroeconomic models, in order to avoid the analysis of intermediate goods, use that notion.Pasinetti [1980], p. 16. The question then is why the use of the concept of a vertically integrated sector is much more advantageous for the dynamic analysis that, for instance, the classic Input-Output models. A vertically integrated sector is, above all, a purely theoretical construction. Each of these sectors is constructed behind each of the final goods production processes, so that these can be decomposed into two clearly distinguishable elements: an amount of labour and a quantity of capital goods. “In a vertically integrated model, the criterion is the process of production of a final commodity, and the problem is to build conceptually behind each final commodity a vertically integrated sector which, by passing through all the intermediate commodities, goes right back to the original inputs”.Pasinetti [1981], p. 113. The great advantage of this abstract construction is that, besides being much more relevant to the dynamic analysis, it can be easily converted by algebraic operations into an Input-Output scheme. The coefficients of production of a vertically integrated model are basically a linear combination of the coefficients of production of an Input-Output model. This means that it is possible to obtain empirical values of the vertically integrated coefficients for an economy. We need only to obtain the values of the production coefficients on each industry (as it is commonly done by the different national account agencies) as well as the capital data at current prices; then we take the transposed inverse matrix of the estimated coefficients and we multiplied it by the vector of capital stocks. This allows us to obtain the vector of vertically integrated capital stock of an industry, a vector that can be seen as a kind of composite good involved in the production of the final commodity considered, which Pasinetti calls unit of vertically integrated productive capacity. A similar procedure is applied with respect to the coefficients of labour. Thus, each final good is summarized in a vertically integrated labour coefficient and a unit of vertically integrated productive capacity. The importance of this algebraic manipulation is notable because it allows linking a measurable and observable magnitudes (corresponding to the Input-Output analysis) with more compact magnitudes which have a deeper economic significance for the dynamic analysis. Thus, both methods (Input-Output and vertical integration) are essentially different points of view to perceive the same thing. Nonetheless, this relationship between the contribution of Pasinetti and Input-Output models, valid for a static analysis, vanishes in a dynamic analysis. The matrix of technical coefficients, i.e., the link between the two methods of analysis, evolves over time due to technical change and change of production methods in the economy. That is, we would require an Input-Output table at each point in time for the dynamic analysis of an economy. However, the movement of vertically integrated coefficients can be analyzed over time, as these relationships include the expressions of technical change. This is the reason why the analysis in terms of vertically integrated coefficients is most appropriate for dynamic analysis. We can go back, however, to an inter-sectoral analysis (Input- Output) with reference to any given point in time when we are interested in it. As Pasinetti says: The result that the vertically integrated technical coefficients can be set up independently of the vagaries of technical change is a result of such importance that it could lead us to reconsider much of the work on structural economic dynamics: =Keynes and the Cambridge Keynesians= John Maynard Keynes. Keynes and the Cambridge Keynesians (2007) is the latest book published by Pasinetti.Keynes and the Cambridge Keynesians: a “Revolution in Economics” to be Accomplished, Cambridge University Press, 2007. Therein, Pasinetti proposes to consider Keynesian economics as an alternative paradigm to Neoclassical economics, emphasizing the contributions of the Cambridge Keynesians as well as future development lines on these issues. Probably, Pasinetti -recognized as the heir of the Cambridge economists-,Baranzini M.; Harcourt G.C.[1993], pp. 2-7. is the most suitable economist to talk about that ambience, because, as he himself acknowledges: The gestation period of the book, as is usual for Pasinetti's books, was long: about 15 years.Pasinetti [2007], p. XX. In fact, with the notable exception of part three, the book is a collection of writings that Pasinetti had prepared years ago. Part three, on the other hand, is new and presumably the most important part of the book. That is, Keynes and the Cambridge Keynesians is composed of three parts or, more properly, of three Books. Book I is a summary of what has been known as the \\"Keynesian Revolution\\". It is taken from set of lectures delivered by Pasinetti in memory of the Italian economist Federico Caffé, in October 1994 at La Sapienza University, Rome. In this Book, Pasinetti makes a chronological overview of the outbreak of the \\"Keynesian Revolution\\", from the first attempts of Keynes in the early 1930s, to the evolution of Keynesian thinking and the subsequent misinterpretation of his theory by the economists of the “Neoclassical synthesis”. Book I also contains some reflections on the progress of knowledge in economics and the rise and fall of scientific paradigms based on the work of the famous epistemologist Thomas Kuhn. The conclusions of Book I also advocate the revival of Keynesian economics with a touch of hope for future generations of economists: Book II, entitled The Cambridge School of Keynesian Economics is by far the longest part of the book. It is composed of, in this order, by the biographies of Richard Kahn, Joan Robinson, Nicholas Kaldor, Piero Sraffa and Richard Goodwin. All of them had already appeared in various places several years earlier, although for this book Pasinetti re-arranged them. The chapter on Kaldor, for example, is a synthesis of two articles written on different occasions. In terms of space, Sraffa is the economist treated in greatest detail by Pasinetti, dedicating to him three, quite independent biographical essays. Besides the importance of each one of the biographies, the purpose of all of them is: Book II ends with some suggestions, nine in total, which according to Pasinetti are at the heart of the \\"Keynesian Revolution\\". The issues involved are: # Reality (and not simply abstract rationality) as the starting point of economic theory. # Economic logic with internal consistency (and not only formal rigour). # Malthus and the Classics (not Walras and the Marginalists) as the major inspiring source in the history of economic thought. # Non-ergodic (in place of stationary, timeless) economic systems. # Causality versus interdependence. # Macroeconomics before microeconomics. # DIsequilibrium and instability (not equilibrium) as the normal state of the industrial economies. # Necessity of finding an appropriate analytical framework for dealing with technical change and economic growth. # A strong, deeply felt social concern.Pasinetti [2007], pp. 219-237. Finally, Book III is a conclusion, not only of the previous chapters of this volume, but also of the whole conception of how Pasinetti would like economic analysis to be carried out. He asserts the need to rise above and go beyond Neoclassical economics through a genuine resurgence of a Classical-Keynesian paradigm, which can be rescued and strengthened and developed by the methodology that Pasinetti has pursued during the whole of his life, made explicit for the first time in his Structural Change and Economic Growth. Basically, he argues for the possibility of formulating, at a first level of investigation, a pure economic theory, independently from the institutional framework of society, and then, at a second level of investigation, of developing an analysis of the relevant institutions, thus achieving a theoretical framework that may allow us to understand the basic features of the monetary production economies in which we live today.

A poet, a writer, and later an ambassadress, who was active in the British literary scene from 1872 until her death in 1905, Fane was a literary celebrity associated with Aestheticism, Medievalism, whose verses were occasionally set to music by famous composers such as Paolo Tosti. As a well-known figure in London society, Fane's coterie included famous literary personas such as Robert Browning, Algernon Swinburne, A. W. Kinglake, Alfred Austin, James McNeil Whistler, Lillie Langtry, and Oscar Wilde, who praised the oracular bent of Fane's opinions on 'the relation of art to nature' by saying that she ‘live[d] between Parnassus and Piccadilly’.Paul Fortunato, Modern Aesthetics and Consumer Culture in the Writings of Oscar Wilde (London: New York: Routledge, 2013), p. 59. Biography Born as Mary Montgomerie Lamb prematurely on 24 February 1843 at Littlehampton, Sussex, Fane was the eldest daughter of Charles James Savile Montgomerie Lamb (1816–1856) and Anna Charlotte Grey (bap. 1824, d. 1880).Reading, University of Reading Archives, Papers of Mary Montgomerie Currie (Violet Fane), 'Lady Currie's Memoirs', MS2608/5/8/2. As the heir of the baronetcy of Burville, Berkshire, and Beauport, Charlie Lamb was descended from two aristocratic families.The Royal Kalendar and Court and City Register for England, Scotland, Ireland, and Colonies for the Year 1833 (London: Suttaby & Co., 1833), p. 75. Charlie Lamb’s mother, Mary, Countess of Eglinton, was the daughter and heir of Archibald Montgomerie, eleventh earl of Eglinton, and the widow of Hugh, twelfth earl of Eglinton. His father, Sir Charles Montolieu Lamb, was the second baronet of Beauport, Sussex. Charlotte Grey, on the other hand, was the daughter of a draper and an alleged smuggler, and she was rumoured to have had gypsy forebears. Charlie and Charlotte eloped in secret, and got married first in Edinburgh, and then in London to validate the legitimacy of their marriage. When Fane was born a few years later, the couple sent their (then one-month-old) daughter to her paternal grandparents with a note that explained their secret marriage and asking for their forgiveness.Reading, University of Reading Archives, Papers of Mary Montgomerie Currie (Violet Fane), 'Lady Currie's Memoirs', MS2608/5/8/2. As a token of their good intentions, Charlie and Charlotte presented the baby to Sir Charles and Lady Mary as their granddaughter. From then on, Fane lived with her grandparents in their ancestral home, Beauport Park. Her parents went abroad for a year-long honeymoon, and returned to join Fane and her grandparents in Beauport as devotees of the oriental life. Charlie, Charlotte and their orientalist acquaintances were the first ones to introduce Fane to the exotic customs of the East during her childhood. They encouraged her to wear Turkish dress and to go barefoot as both her parents did. They also dispensed with beds and summoned their daughter by clapping their hands.Helen Small, ‘Currie, Mary Montgomerie, Lady Currie (1843–1905)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2007. Available at:(accessed 8 March 2017. Fane had four siblings: Clara (b.1844), Archibald (b.1845), Flora (b. 1849) and Charles Anthony (b. 1857), three of whom survived to adulthood. Clara, who died in 1855 for unknown reasons, would later become a key subject to which Fane often returned to in her poetry. These poems form a sequence which are referred to as the ‘Clara Poems’. When Charlie Lamb died under suspicious circumstances in 1856, Lady Sophia Adelaide Theodosia Pelham, the wife of Archibald William Montgomerie, 14th Earl of Eglinton, took the young Fane under her care and introduced her to London society, where she rapidly became well known as a great conversationalist and a woman of considerable wit. She fell in love with Clare Vyner, a handsome Yorkshire squire, in the early 1860s, but their attachment did not lead to marriage. In 1864, when Fane was twenty-one years old, she married Henry Sydenham Singleton, Esq. (1819-1893), then forty-five, and thus became Mrs Singleton despite her mother's objections. However, Vyner remained in her heart. This unrequited love inspired many of the poems Fane wrote in the 1860s, which were to be published in her first poetry collection, From Dawn to Noon in 1872. As an Anglo-Irish absentee landowner, Singleton was a part of the landed gentry. He is listed in the 1883 edition of John Bateman's Great Landowners of Great Britain and Ireland as having 8,879 acres of land in Cavan, Louth, Meath and Hampshire, which generated a considerable income of £6,715 per annum.ohn Bateman, The Great Landowners of Great Britain and Ireland: A List of All Owners of Three Thousand Acres and Upwards, Worth £3,000 a Year; Also, One Thousand Three Hundred Owners of Two Thousand Acres and Upwards, in England, Scotland, Ireland, & Wales, Their Acreage and Income from Land, Culled from THE MODERN DOMESDAY BOOK (London: Harrison, 1883), p. 409. He is described as a ‘strange misanthropic’ and a 'backseat husband', who seemingly did not, or could not, make Fane happy. Sometime between 1869 and 1870, Fane met Philip Currie, then a young diplomat, whilst residing in Singleton's country estate, Hazely, which was not far from Currie's father's country estate, Minley.Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum, Wilfrid Scawen Blunt Papers, BLUNT 1191-1977. Literary Life The biographical note that is situated at the beginning of her 1892 collection, Poems, mentions Fane's early poetic calling, and declares: > It is interesting to note, in these days when hereditary influences cannot > be disregarded, that “Violet Fane” descends, upon her father’s side, from > the houses of Seton, Somerville, and Montgomerie, in Scotland, and from the > old Provençal family of Montolieu in France, several of whose members were > authors of distinction; and that […] she can claim kinship with the witty > and eccentric John, Earl of Rochester, whose poetic talent was not always > turned to the use of edifying.Violet Fane, Poems by Violet Fane, in Two > Volumes (London: John C. Nimmo, 1892), p.vi. Despite her literary heritage, Fane's first published work was not to fall within the field of poetry. A year before she was to marry Singleton, several etchings by her appeared in an illustrated edition of Alfred Lord Tennyson’s 1830 poem, Mariana, which seems to have been published privately in 1863.Alfred Tennyson, Mariana… with Etchings by Mary Montgomerie Lamb (Worthing: O Breds, 1863). The fact that Fane’s illustrations accompanied Mariana seems apt because the poem perfectly captures Fane’s own lovelorn state after her disappointment with Vyner, which might have encouraged Fane to identify with the tragic romantic heroine of the poem, who also suffers because of the absence of her lover. The first collection of poetry to appear under the pseudonym ‘Violet Fane’ is From Dawn to Noon.Violet Fane, From Dawn to Noon (London: Longmans, Green and Co., 1872). The collection was published in 1872, when Fane had already started an extra-marital affair with the diplomat Philip Currie. Her family's disapproval of her writing pushed Fane to assume a nom de plume when she started publishing poetry. Therefore, she took the name ‘Violet Fane’ from Benjamin Disraeli's novel, Vivian Grey (1826).In her article, ‘Are Remarkable People Remarkable Looking? An Extravaganza’, Fane states that Disraeli called her his ‘dear goddaughter’ when they met because she assumed Violet Fane as her nom de plume.Lady Mary Montgomerie Currie (Violet Fane), ‘Are Remarkable People Remarkable Looking?’, The Nineteenth Century and After: A Monthly Review, 56 (1904), pp. 622-642, p. 627. Although she admits to having read Vivian Grey many years ago, Fane also claims to have completely forgotten about Disraeli's Violet Fane when choosing her pseudonym (‘Remarkable People’, pp. 627–628). She then contradicts herself, however, by explaining that the reason she chose the name ‘Violet Fane’ for her literary purposes was because the character ‘died in the arms of her lover’ and a death like that was ‘worth living for’ (‘Remarkable People’, p. 629). This seems to be in harmony with the dominant emotion of Dawn to Noon.

Casteras, James Smetham: Artist, Author, Pre-Raphaelite Associate, Aldershot, U.K., Scholar Press, 1995. Smetham was born in Pateley Bridge, Yorkshire, and attended school in Leeds; he was originally apprenticed to the Lincoln architect Edward James Willson before deciding on an artistic career. He studied at the Royal Academy, beginning in 1843. His modest early success as a portrait painter was stifled by the development of photography (a problem shared by other artists of the time). In 1851 Smetham took a teaching position at the Wesleyan Normal College in Westminster, and was the first Drawing Master for what would later become Westminster College (today part of Oxford Brookes University). In 1854, he married Sarah Goble, a fellow teacher at the College. They would eventually have six children. Smetham worked in a range of genres, including religious and literary themes as well as portraiture; but he is perhaps best known as a landscape painter. His \\"landscapes have a visionary quality\\" reminiscent of the work of William Blake, John Linnell, and Samuel Palmer.Christopher Wood, Victorian Painting, Boston, Little, Brown & Co., 1999; p. 126.

His choice of subject was sometimes somewhat bizarre; one of his best paintings is The Death of Earl Siward which depicts the dying earl, dressed in full armour, standing up and being supported by his servants as 'He did not wish to die lying down like a cow'. He was also an essayist and art critic; an article on Blake (in the form of a review of Alexander Gilchrist's Life of William Blake), which appeared in the January 1869 issue of the Quarterly Review,Reprinted in: Alexander Gilchrist, Life of William Blake, enlarged edition, Anne Burrows Gilchrist, ed., London, Macmillan, 1880; Vol. 2, pp. 309-51. influenced and advanced recognition of Blake's artistic importance. Other Smetham articles for the Review were \\"Religious Art in England\\" (1861), \\"The Life and Times of Sir Joshua Reynolds\\" (1866), and \\"Alexander Smith\\" (1868). He also wrote some poetry. Smetham was a devout Methodist, and after a mental breakdown in 1857, the second half of his life was marked by a growing religious mania and eventual insanity. \\"In one of his notebooks he attempted to illustrate every verse in the Bible.\\"Wood, p. 138. (Smetham habitually created miniature, postage-stamp-sized pen-and-ink drawings, in a process he called \\"squaring.\\" He produced thousands of these in his lifetime.) He suffered a final breakdown in 1877 and lived in seclusion at his home in Stoke Newington until his death. Smetham's letters, posthumously published by his widow,James Smetham, The Letters of James Smetham: With an Introductory Memoir, Sarah Smetham and William Davies, eds., London, Macmillan, 1892. throw light upon Rossetti, John Ruskin, and other contemporaries, and have been praised for their literary and spiritual qualities. His surviving journals and notebooks show that Smetham practised an almost stream of consciousness type of writing that he called \\"ventilating,\\" as a method of religious self- analysis.

Published in 1985, the book continues a pattern of Wambaugh crime fiction beginning with The Choirboys that uses black humor to explore the psychological effects of prolonged stress on veteran police officers. As with all his novels, The Secrets of Harry Bright, set in November 1984, is contemporaneous with the time frame in which it was written and includes numerous allusions and references to events and personalities of the time. The Secrets of Harry Bright also continued Wambaugh's satirization of the mores and extravagances of the Southern California \\"rich and famous\\" lifestyle that began with The Black Marble, in addition to its focus on police work. The novel, set in and around Palm Springs, California, savages a wealthy \\"occasional home\\" mentality characterized by golf, excessive drinking and drug use, and discriminatory country clubs. Wambaugh draws contrasts by depicting the fictional Mineral Springs, a small wind-swept desert town populated not just by blue-collar tourist industry workers, but \\"ex-cons, bikers, crank dealers, Palm Springs burglars, nudists, robbers and pimps, horny kite pilots, dopers and drunks.\\" The Secrets of Harry Bright first appeared on the New York Times best seller list on October 6, 1985, ranked 15th, and rose as high as 5th. It spent a total of 17 weeks on the list.New York Times Best Seller List of February 2, 1986 Themes As with his other novels beginning with The Black Marble, Wambaugh spins his tale from numerous points of view, but has as its central character and protagonist a competent, middle aged but dissipated detective sergeant whose age and police experience mirror that of Wambaugh himself, and where he likely would have been had he not resigned from the LAPD. Wambaugh introduces a new psychological theme in The Secrets of Harry Bright, that of the relationship of fathers and sons, exploring it as a sub-theme to those of burnout and police suicide that characterized his previous novels. He uses as a vehicle for this what he describes as the \\"unnatural perversion\\" of sons dying before their fathers, which has affected three key figures in his story. Although a murder whodunit, the plot is secondary to the gradual revelation of its central character, Sidney Blackpool. The eponymous persona, Harry Bright, is seen only through the descriptions of others until the dénouement of the novel, when he becomes a crucial clue to Blackpool's fate. Plot Paco Pedroza is chief of police in Mineral Springs, California, a small nondescript desert town near Palm Springs. The Los Angeles Police Department informs him that they have developed a new lead in a notorious, unsolved Palm Springs homicide in which the body was found in Solitaire Canyon, a notorious biker hangout within Mineral Springs. While Paco unenthusiastically prepares for a visit by an LAPD homicide team, desert rat drunkard Beavertail Bigelow, the object of a prank by one of Paco's cops, stumbles across an antique ukulele in the desert that will become a key piece of evidence in the renewed investigation. On election day 1984 in Los Angeles, LAPD Sgt. Sidney Blackpool is invited to the corporate office of high tech industrialist Victor Watson, whose son Jack was the victim in the Palm Springs homicide. Over drinks, Watson tells Blackpool he pulled strings with LAPD to arrange for Blackpool to investigate a new lead that tenuously ties the case to Blackpool's jurisdiction in Hollywood. Blackpool suspects that the lead is a pretext to draw in the resources of LAPD after both Palm Springs and the Federal Bureau of Investigation failed to solve the case. Watson knows that Blackpool's son died at approximately the same time, and using that to engage his sympathies, persuades Blackpool to work the case as part of an expenses-paid golf vacation for himself and his partner, Otto Stringer, in Palm Springs. His inducement is a suggested promise of a retirement job for Blackpool as head of security for Watson Industries. During the search for the missing Jack Watson, Officer O.A. Jones of Mineral Springs PD became lost in the desert, where he accidentally became a witness in the investigation, and in finding the lost O.A. Jones, other officers found the victim's body in a burned out car. While O.A. Jones tries to unravel his delerium recollections of a song he overheard being sung at the crime scene, other officers confiscate the ukulele, which Bigelow has sold to another desert rat, as the weapon used in a domestic violence case. Blackpool and Stringer check into a posh Palm Springs hotel with $10,000 in $500 bills (\\"President McKinleys\\") as expense money. Their investigation starts slowly, as both are more interested in vacation amenities than work. After a visit to the Watson house, where they interview the live-in \\"houseboy\\", Harlan Penrod, and then a phone call to the Palm Springs PD, the investigation picks up speed as both conclude that a kidnapping was highly unlikely and try to figure out why Jack Watson would have gone to Solitaire Canyon. Harlan provides a photo of Jack with a possible suspect. The investigation, with rounds of golf sandwiched in between, takes them to the Mineral Springs PD, the Eleven Ninety-nine Club (a cop bar in Mineral Springs), a gay bar in Palm Springs, a biker's shack in Solitaire Canyon, the Thunderbird Country Club, and a nursing home in Indio. The ukulele and the LAPD cops intersect at the cop bar, where Blackpool makes the connection linking it to O.A. Jones's memory. As suspects are investigated and eliminated as possibilities, Sidney Blackpool and Otto are forced to confront the possibility that either of two sergeants of the Mineral Springs PD, Harry Bright or Coy Brickman, might be Jack Watson's killer. A tryst with Harry Bright's ex-wife provides the final clues for Sidney Blackpool, who confronts Paco Pedroza with his suspicions. After a heated confrontation, Pedroza agrees to cooperate in arranging ballistics tests of his officers' pistols but before that can take place, fate intervenes. Blackpool and Otto confront Coy Brickman, who reveals a hypothetical solution to the case to avoid implicating himself, tying off all loose ends raised by the investigation. Blackpool demands to see for himself proof of Harry Bright's invalid condition, which is far worse than he had considered. Afterwards, Otto washes his hands of the case and returns to Los Angeles without Sidney Blackpool, who takes the information to Victor Watson. When the interview shatters Blackpool, Sidney returns to Mineral Springs and finally discovers Harry Bright's secret. Character synopses =Main characters= Sgt. Sidney Blackpool – 42 years old, divorced, and with Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) for 21 years, Blackpool is a homicide detective in Hollywood. He is known as \\"Black Sid\\" to his peers because of an excessive fondness for Johnnie Walker Black Label Scotch whisky, and he is still reeling from the accidental death of his 18-year-old son Tommy in a surfing accident fourteen months before. Sidney is tormented nightly by bad dreams that include floating coffins and Tommy's resurrection as a young boy, which leave him sobbing and emotionally defenseless to cope with the loss. * Det. Otto Stringer – Blackpool's partner, about to turn forty, balding and overweight. Otto transferred to Homicide two months before, after a long tenure as a narcotics detective, as a result of several brushes with death.

Lampoons Wambaugh's novels are noted for numerous quirky but incidental characters, stereotypical lampoons of police officer \\"types\\" he either observed personally or the subjects of anecdotes related to him by officers. In The Secrets of Harry Bright the officers of the small, fictional Mineral Springs Police Department fill this role. The common thread linking them is their status as misfits elsewhere, and that all were recommended by Sgt. Harry Bright for hiring. Wambaugh expands his lampoons in The Secrets of Harry Bright to include two episodes depicting wealthy retired country clubbers, Archie Rosenkrantz and Fiona Grout, encountered by Blackpool and Stringer on golf courses.

As MMA becomes a mature sport, brands dedicated to it have worked toward specializing clothing that improve an MMA athlete's training and competition. Overview MMA gloves and MMA shorts (similar to the shorts worn in boxing and Muay Thai) are the only piece of clothing allowed to be worn during professional MMA competitions. This type of clothing is often referred to as fightwear to differentiate it from MMA fashion clothing which includes t-shirts, hoodies, caps and hats. However, Amateur MMA, regulated by International Mixed Martial Arts Federation, requires shin-instep. There are various types of MMA fightshorts, including board shorts, shorts which extend halfway down the thigh, shorts which extend only slightly down the thigh and gladiator shorts which feature slits in the sides of the legs. Common brands include Fairtex, Bad Boy, Venum, TapouT, VENDETTA, Sprawl, Silver Star, Hayabusa, TCB Fightwear, Jaco, POSS-MMA, Hitman Fight Gear, Dethrone Royalty, RYU and Ground Game. Several clothing brands have developed their own lines of MMA apparel including Affliction Clothing, No Fear, Eckō Unltd. and Emerson Brand Apparel. The overall revenues of sales of MMA clothing come to hundreds of millions of dollars a year, with both TapouT and Affliction recording sales in excess of $100 million. Mixed Martial Arts Shorts The Unified Rules of MMA provide clear guidelines around the shorts used during professional and amateur MMA bouts. These rules have provided a benchmark for apparel companies to design and develop training and competition shorts for mixed martial arts and related sports. MMA shorts have now evolved from regular board shorts or biking shorts. They now much more specialized and provide several features to improve comfort, range of motion and flexibility, and additional characteristics that improve a fighter's ability during practice and competition. Mixed Martial Arts Shirts Most MMA fighters used specialized compression shirts, called Rash guards, to train. Rash guards are not regular compression shirts. Ground training techniques have required that these shirts provide reinforced seams and stitching, with additional panels to support the additional stress placed on the shirt during training while continuing to provide the benefits provided by regular compression shirts. In addition to rash guards, several promotions like the UFC, regularly provide sponsors with the ability to advertise their brands using t-shirts during the weigh-in events and competition. These shirts have been title as \\"Walk-out\\" shirts by many, because they are used by a fighters while being presented for their fight as they walk towards the cage. These shirts are sold to the public as a means for the fans to support their favorite fighters. Fighters are required by the UFC to wear Reebok branded clothing during walkout.

The village began with a few buildings in the 1870s and became a thriving community that in the 20th century outgrew the parish centre of Headley. Headley Down is south west of London and east of Headley village centre. Nearby are the villages of Grayshott to the east and Churt to the north. History The area was called Headley Down on maps as early as 1801, and from about the 1870s houses began to be built by people wishing to live or holiday in the healthy environment for which the Hindhead area was notable. It was also described as Headley Common on a map (of about 1868) of the large Wishanger Manor Estate, the records of which go back at least to 1167. The side-roads in Headley Down were laid out in a grid system at least as early as 1909, rather than radiating out from a central point such as a church. The Land of Nod estate predates Headley Down, possibly established in the early 18th century; an owner of the estate believed its name derived from an earlier incumbent by the name of Cane or Keyne, an excommunicant, and is a reference to the biblical story of Cain's banishment. The estate lies mainly to the north of the village. Kelly's Directory of 1895 lists J Henry Christian as a private resident of the Land of Nod. Headley Down was formally named in March 1923 when the Post Office proclaimed that \\"the official name of the Telephone Call Office which has been established on Stone Hill will be Headley Down\\". A temporary wooden building in Carlton Road erected in the 1960s housed the post office, where it remained until incorporated into Whittle's store (subsequently Londis) in Eddeys Lane. During the Second World War the area was home to several camps for Canadian soldiers. Erie camp was a military detention centre and was built on the Land of Nod estate owned by Major L Whitaker; it was designated by the War Office as a \\"Military Prison and Detention Barracks\\" from at least 1946 to 1948. The camp was subsequently occupied by civilians and gradually replaced by an estate of 350 houses and named Heatherlands. The estate was completed by 1977. From early April 1944, 107 Regiment (King's Own) Royal Armoured Corps trained with Churchill tanks on Headley Down in preparation for the invasion of Normandy. There were other military units based on Headley Down: on the current Windmill Estate, at the back of The Mount, and down Headley Hill Road and Barley Mow Hill. In the 1950s Alfred Whittle opened a general store, butcher's and coal merchant in Eddeys Lane to accommodate Headley Down's increasing post-war population. The store and post office closed in 2015 after 65 years' service to the village. \\"Penryn\\" was a home for children, mainly from London, in the post-war period until the 1980s when it was replaced by private housing, now called Penryn Drive. Unpaved road, 2007 Most side-roads in Headley Down remained unpaved until the 1960s when there was a considerable increase in permanent housing in addition to replacing or upgrading the numerous temporary holiday homes. Some roads remained unpaved well into the 2000s. Heatherlands estate houses approximately one fifth of the Headley parish population. In 2006, Heatherlands/Headley Down was considered to be the most deprived ward in East Hampshire. EHDC expressed the view that Headley's Parish Plan was not sufficiently inclusive of the whole parish. The Parish Council set out to explore ways to improve social inclusion and in 2007 produced a report with recommendations for action. Amenities =Transport= The main through road is the B3002 (Beech Hill/Grayshott Road) connecting Headley Down to the A333 (the old A3) at Hindhead via Grayshott to the east, and to the A325 at Bordon, via Headley and Lindford to the west. The nearest railway station is south of the village, at Liphook. The bus route serving Headley Down is Stagecoach 23, Alton to Haslemere. =Shops=There is a One Stop local shop, a.k.a. M&W;'s, on the Heatherlands estate. *Beech Hill Garage (formerly Wilson & Pickett Ltd) has stood at the crossroads at the top of Beech Hill for at least 50 years but closed in 2018. A Texaco petrol station with a Budgens store opened in spring 2019 on the site. =Education= There is no school in Headley Down; the nearest for up to 11 year olds is The Holme Church of England Controlled Primary School in Headley village. =Community= St Francis Church and Hall *St Francis Community Church - An interdenominational church established in 1921 and dedicated in 1964. *Headley Scouts - A Scout, Cub and Beaver Group meets at the Scout Centre on Beech Hill Road. *Headley Down Community Association (HDCA) is a charity dedicated to the improvement of the local community. *Naturism - Headley Down has been the home of a naturist establishment for many years; the Haslemere Sun Club (established 1947) is in Pond Road. =Environment= Ludshott Common, adjoining the eastern and southern boundary of the village, is one of the largest remaining areas of heathland in East Hampshire. A National Trust property, it covers 285 ha (705 acres) and is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and Special Protection Area (SPA) due to the number of endangered species, including woodlark, nightjar and Dartford warbler. There is also a great variety of spider and butterfly species, including the silver-studded blue, grayling and green hairstreak. National Trust  South East  Ludshott Common & Waggoner's Wells Pond Road is so named for a pond that existed up until the 1970s when it was drained and subsequently attracted fly-tipping. Local residents remembered it had previously contained a wide variety of insect life, amphibians and fish, and attracted kingfishers. With the aid of local and county council grants it was re-established in 2003 and is now known as Fuller's Vale Wildlife Pond. Notable peopleElizabeth Wilks died here having given the village sixteen new cottages and ten acres of woodland. *The King of Norway (Haakon VII) lived in Headley Down for a time after his country was invaded by the Germans; the house, Stonedene, has since been demolished, replaced by a residential development called Stonedene Close.

The highway is constructed and maintained by National Highway Authority of India from Delhi to Rishikesh and Border Roads Organisation (BRO) of Indian Army from Rishikesh, where the plains end and the mountains start, to its northernmost end. The highway bypasses Meerut city that was a big bottleneck. Bypasses at Muzaffarnagar has been constructed but bypass at Roorkee is pending.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nhai-cancels-contract-for- dehradun-highway-serves-notice-for-haridwar-stretch/articleshow/65464585.cms Importance of NH58 =Religious= It is an important route for Hindu pilgrims as it connects the national capital New Delhi with religious pilgrim centres, Haridwar and Rishikesh in the plains of Uttarakhand, and then with the hill cities and temples of Uttarakhand. The most important pilgrimage circuit in Uttarakhand is called Chhota Char Dham (Four Pilgrimage Centres) comprising Yamunotri (where Yamuna river originates), Gangotri (where Ganga river originates), Kedarnath temple and Badrinath temple. The pilgrims visit Haridwar and Rishikesh in the plains the entire year but more so during the winter. The pilgrim season in the hills starts with melting of the snow at the end of April or in the beginning of May and continues until the onset of monsoon rains in late June. Buses and vehicles packed with pilgrims and tourists throng the highway during the summer months. The highway is packed with pilgrims and tourists during pilgrimage season or during important festivals. When pilgrims bring holy water from Ganga river and carry it to their villages and homes walking on foot all the way during one fortnight, one lane of the highway is reserved for these pilgrims who walk on foot and vehicles have to use only one lane for about two weeks in a year. =Strategic and military= The highway connects with the border with Tibet. It is built and maintained by Border Roads Organisation (BRO) of Indian Army from Rishikesh, where the plains end and the mountains start, to its northernmost end. Earlier it was built only up to Chamoli and has over the years gradually been extended to Joshimath, Badrinath and finally to Mana Pass near the border with Tibet. The army along with civilians living in Garhwal are its major user. CharDham yatra in summer is all thru this route.  Development  As of December 2013, the Meerut to Muzaffarnagar stretch is 4-laned on toll basis including bypasses at Khatauli and Muzaffarnagar. The Muzaffarnagar to Haridwar stretch has been awarded for similar development with scheduled completion by February 2013, but has been delayed due to problems such as land acquisition, tree felling and inadequate mobilization by the Concessionaire. Also, a flyover at Mohan Nagar, a 4710 m long viaduct at Modinagar and a 1710 m long viaduct at Murad Nagar are proposed. * February 2020: Roorkee bypass road construction work restarted, its expected to be completed by November 2020.https://www.amarujala.com/uttarakhand/roorkee/bypass-construction- started-by-removing-encroachment-roorkee-news- drn335384638https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/nh-58-project- to-be-completed-a-month-before-deadline-says-nhai- official/articleshow/73102906.cms Gallery File:Under-Construction Flyover on NH-58 Sardhana Road Crossing in Meerut.jpgUnder-Construction Flyover on NH-58 Sardhana Road Crossing in Meerut.

In addition, G.718 is designed to be highly robust to frame erasures, thereby enhancing the speech quality when used in internet protocol (IP) transport applications on fixed, wireless and mobile networks. Despite its embedded nature, the codec also performs well with both narrowband and wideband generic audio signals. The codec has an embedded scalable structure, enabling maximum flexibility in the transport of voice packets through IP networks of today and in future media-aware networks. In addition, the embedded structure of G.718 will easily allow the codec to be extended to provide a superwideband (50 Hz to 14 kHz) and stereo capability through additional layers which are currently under development in ITU-T Study Group 16. The bitstream may be truncated at the decoder side or by any component of the communication system to instantaneously adjust the bit rate to the desired value without the need for out-of-band signalling. The encoder produces an embedded bitstream structured in five layers corresponding to the five available bit rates: 8, 12, 16, 24 & 32 kbit/s. The G.718 encoder can accept wideband sampled signals at 16 kHz, or narrowband signals sampled at either 16 or 8 kHz. Similarly, the decoder output can be 16 kHz wideband, in addition to 16 or 8 kHz narrowband. Input signals sampled at 16 kHz, but with bandwidth limited to narrowband, are detected by the encoder. The output of the G.718 codec is capable of operating with a bandwidth of 50 Hz to 4 kHz at 8 and 12 kbit/s and 50 Hz to 7 kHz from 8 to 32 kbit/s. The high quality codec core represents a significant advance in quality over currently available codecs, providing 8 kbit/s wideband clean speech quality equivalent to G.722.2 at 12.65 kbit/s whilst the 8 kbit/s narrowband codec operating mode provides clean speech quality equivalent to G.729 Annex E at 11.8 kbit/s. The codec operates on 20 ms frames and has a maximum algorithmic delay of 42.875 ms for wideband input and wideband output signals. The maximum algorithmic delay for narrowband input and narrowband output signals is 43.875 ms. The codec may also be employed in a low-delay mode when the encoder and decoder maximum bit rates are set to 12 kbit/s. In this case the maximum algorithmic delay is reduced by 10 ms. The codec also incorporates an alternate coding mode, with a minimum bit rate of 12.65 kbit/s, which is bitstream interoperable with ITU-T Recommendation G.722.2, 3GPP AMR-WB and 3GPP2 VMR-WB mobile wideband speech coding standards. This option replaces Layer 1 and Layer 2, and the layers 3-5 are similar to the default option with the exception that in Layer 3 few bits are used to compensate for the extra bits of the 12.65 kbit/s core. The decoder is further able to decode all other G.722.2 operating modes. G.718 also includes discontinuous transmission mode (DTX) and comfort noise generation (CNG) algorithms that enable bandwidth savings during inactive periods. An integrated noise reduction algorithm can be used provided that the communication session is limited to 12 kbit/s. The underlying algorithm is based on a two-stage coding structure: the lower two layers are based on Code- Excited Linear Prediction (CELP) coding of the band (50–6400 Hz) where the core layer takes advantage of signal-classification to use optimized coding modes for each frame. The higher layers encode the weighted error signal from the lower layers using overlap-add modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) transform coding. Several technologies are used to encode the MDCT coefficients to maximize performance for both speech and music. G.718 was developed in ITU-T Study Group 16 as part of an open consortium of 9 organizations; Motorola, Nokia, Ericsson, Texas Instruments, VoiceAge Corporation, Panasonic, Huawei, France Telecom, Qualcomm. It was approved in 2008. G.718 is officially described as Frame error robust narrowband and wideband embedded variable bit-rate coding of speech and audio from 8-32 kbit/s.

In his very first senior season in 1987 Dibrivnijs won the Latvian Cup with VEF Rīga. In the cup final against Torpedo Rīga Dibrivnijs came on as a substitute and scored the winning penalty in the aftermatch penalty shootout. Dibrivnijs spent two years with VEF but in 1988–1989 he had to start his military service in the Soviet Army. During the first months in the army Dibrivnijs still was allowed to play football with VEF, then he was assigned to play with RAF Jelgava, however as he didn't make the first-squad selection of RAF, he mostly played with Junioru izlase. After Dibrivnijs had expressed an interest in joining FC Baltika Kaliningrad, Dibrivnijs was sent to continue his service far from Latvia – in Irkutsk. There he played football with the local army squad and attracted interest from the management of FC Zvezda Irkutsk. He participated in some trainings with the club but wasn't allowed to play for it. After completing his military service and returning to Riga Dibrivnijs received transfer papers for joining Zvezda Irkutsk, but he stayed in Riga and joined Pārdaugava Riga which was then coached by Jānis Gilis. In 1991 Dibrivnijs joined Skonto Riga for which he played until the summer of 1994, winning the Latvian Higher League all these four years. In 1993 Dibrivnijs played his single official match for Latvia national football team as it beat Estonia national football team to win the Baltic Cup.Latvian international football in 1993 In the middle of the 1994 season Dibrivnijs left Skonto, as after an injury he got very little playing practice. He joined Olimpija Rīga which had won the silver medals of the Latvian league the previous year but was already on a decline in 1994 and in 1995 finished in the 9th place in the Latvian League and went bankrupt. After that Dibrivnijs spent one year Skonto/Metāls. In his last season in the Latvian Higher League in 1997 Dibrivnijs played with Daugava Rīga which under the management of Jurijs Popkovs won the silver medals of Virslīga. After leaving FC Daugava Dibrivnijs continued playing football with several Latvian First League clubs, however his preferences switched to futsal in which he also represented the Latvia national team, and in later years also took up coaching. As of October 2008 he is the playing head coach of the strongest Latvian futsal club – Nikars Rīga.

The independent, nonpartisan site aims to increase transparency in government and deepen German democracy. Questions and answers are published, as well as the voting records of the deputies. Users of the site can contact representatives of the Bundestag, German deputies of the European Parliament and of the German federal states. abgeordnetenwatch.de is a non-profit project of Parlamentwatch e.V. and Parlamentwatch GmbH (technical service provider for Parlamentwatch e.V.) in cooperation with Mehr Demokratie e.V. and Mehr Bürgerrechte e.V. and is supported by BonVenture - Fonds und Stiftung für Soziale Verantwortung. The goal is to be financed through fund- raising groups and online advertisements that can be hidden on demand. Additional income comes from selling enhanced profiles to deputies and candidates. Parlamentwatch GmbH is obliged to donate any excess funds to charitable organizations serving the public good. This commitment is defined in the organization's statutes.  Moderation  All questions are read by a team of moderators to make sure they are within the moderation code, which prohibits insulting statements, incitement, discrimination, questions concerning private life, and requests that are bound to discretion. Questions that violate the code are not activated and published, but the politician is informed about the incident. Beyond that, the project is strongly committed to neutrality and stays above party politics. In addition to general information about deputies, their voting behavior in issues that attract special public attention is documented.  Statistics  In average, the website counts 6,800 visitors a day and about three million page impressions per month. More than 80% of all MPs of the federal parliament answer questions through Parliament Watch. In Germany, the project covers the federal parliament, the European parliament, nine state parliaments and 54 parliaments on the communal level. All in all the digital voters' memory counts 143,507 questions and 115,921 answers (as of 31 January 2013).  Media partnerships  The project has several partnerships with online outlets of the following media: * Der Spiegel * Süddeutsche Zeitung * stern * Die Welt * Frankfurter Rundschau * Der Tagesspiegel.

Landesparlamente  Due to abgeordnetenwatch's success in the German Bundestag, fundraising groups were established in August 2007 in order to make the site available for Germany's 16 Landesparlamente (\\"states\\"). Donations and sustaining members in each state enable the implementation of the project on the state level; each state's portal is activated once 90 days' advance financing is accrued. = Hamburgische Bürgerschaft = abgeordnetenwatch.de is based in Hamburg; the project started in December 2004 for the Hamburgische Bürgerschaft (\\"Hamburg Parliament\\") after a successful referendum to reform and democratize the electoral system. The online dialog on abgeordnetenwatch.de enabled the citizens to get to know their politicians better and make a more qualified decision in the elections. After the election, the site made it possible to ask questions of members of Hamburg's Bezirksversammlungen (\\"Diets of the borough\\"). After the establishment of the city parliament that was elected in February 2008, the project was temporarily stopped until enough funding was provided. It was no longer possible to administer abgeordnetenwatch.de on a volunteer basis. = Controversy = During the 2007 election campaigns in the German states of Rheinland-Pfalz, Baden-Württemberg, Saxony-Anhalt, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Berlin, and Bremen, it was also possible to question the candidates. In Bremen, candidates of the Social Democratic Party (Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands, SPD) and The Left (Die Linke) launched a boycott against the project because right-wing candidates had not been excluded. However, the boycott was interrupted by Social Democrat Helga Ziegert, and Joachim Weihrauch from The Left enhanced his Parliamentwatch profile during the election.  Profile enhancements  The site publishes basic information about each candidate at no cost. For a €179 fee, candidates can add a photo and web link, announce specific dates and events regarding election campaigns, and publish a résumé of their political work and goals. The proceeds from profile enhancements contribute to the project's budget.  Other countries  So far further Parliament Watch projects can be found in Ireland, Austria, Luxemburg and Tunisia.

John Gough Nichols, 1868 drawing by Leonard Charles Wyon Life The eldest son of John Bowyer Nichols, he was born at his father's house in Red Lion Passage, Fleet Street, London, on 22 May 1806. Richard Gough was his godfather. He went to a school kept by a Miss Roper at Islington, where, in 1811, Benjamin Disraeli, his senior by eighteen months, was a schoolfellow. From 1814 to 1816 he was educated by Thomas Waite at Lewisham grammar school, and in January 1817 he was placed at Merchant Taylors' School. In 1824 Nichols left school for the counting-house in the printing offices of his father and grandfather. In 1830 he visited Robert Surtees in Durham, and made a Scottish tour. On the foundation of the Surtees Society in 1834 he was elected one of the treasurers. In 1835 he became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and was later its printer. The following year he was chosen a member of the committee of the Royal Literary Fund. He was one of the founders of the Camden Society (1838), and edited many of its publications; in 1862 he printed a Descriptive Catalogue of the 86 volumes then issued. In 1841 Nichols made an antiquarian tour on the continent. He was an original member of the Archæological Institute (1844). Brass to John Gough Nichols FSA Nichols died at his house, Holmwood Park, North Holmwood near Dorking, Surrey, after a short illness, on 14 November 1873, aged 67. Works Nichols at an early age kept antiquarian journals and copied inscriptions and epitaphs. He went with his father to the meetings of the Royal Society and Society of Antiquaries, and corresponded with Isaac D'Israeli. His first literary work was on the Progresses of James I of his grandfather John Nichols, which he completed in 1828. Nichols superintended a new edition of John Hutchins's History of Dorset, undertaken by William Shipp in 1860. In 1870 he undertook to edit a new edition of Thomas Dunham Whitaker's Whalley, of which the first volume appeared in 1871.

In the Gentleman's Magazine, besides contributing essays, he compiled the obituary notices. In 1856 ill-health compelled him to resign its editorship, and it was transferred to John Henry Parker for a nominal consideration. A replacement was the Herald and Genealogist, of which the first volume appeared under his editorship in 1862. His interest in obituary-writing led him to found the short-lived Register and Magazine of Biography in 1869.

Nichols married, on 22 July 1843, Lucy, eldest daughter of Frederick Lewis, commander R.N., and had one son, John Bruce Nichols (b. 1848), and two daughters. The son's name was added in 1873 to those of his father and uncle as printers of the Votes and Proceedings of the House of Commons. A portrait of Nichols at the age of twenty-four is contained in a family group in water-colours, by Daniel Maclise (1830).

The devotees offer their gratitude to the deity for marriage as well as childbirth. After the Aarti, devotees take part in the thanksgiving ceremony. \\"Churma\\" is the main Prasad offered to the deity which is distributed among the devotees after offering it to deity. It is believed that the prasad should be consumed within the campus of the temple and cannot be taken outside the temple. Devotees believe that attending the aarti is the biggest blessing. Every year on Chaitra Sudi ekam (according to Vikram Samvat), a large fair is organised for two days. Since this fair is organised after Holi festival, many Holi dancers attend in conventional and fancy dresses. More than one lakh devotees participate. The most devout come barefoot from their native places in order to receive the great blessing. They travel from 15 km to 200 km moving in groups (Sangh) for two to ten days barefoot. There is even a cycle yatri coming from a long distance of 2500 km from Chennai, Coimbatore, Hosur (Tamil Nadu to Rajasthan) covering on cycle for a month (30 days) on the occasion of Mela.  History  Shri Sonana Khetlaji temple was found approximately 800 years ago. The temple demonstrates the beautiful art of the ancient Rajput architecture. Folk deity Shri Khetlaji is worshipped as Lord Bhairav who is considered as the fifth incarnation of Lord Shiva. Shree Khetlaji is also known as Shri Bhairav or Shri Kshetrapaal Ji. Sonana Khetlaji temple also has an idol of a snake which is believed to be one of the forms of Shree Ketlaji. This idol is a self - manifested. Shree Khetlaji came to Mandor from Kashi. Later, he visited Sonana. It is believed that Lord Bhairav used to protect the sages who were meditating in the Aravalli hill range. Lord Bhairav made his abode in one of the caves which were located at Sonana Khetlaji. Hence, it became his permanent abode and people started worshipping him at this place.  Festivals and Fairs  Every year on Chaitra Sudi ekam, a fair is held for two days in the honor of Shri Khetlaji. This fair is organized immediately after Holi. Thousands of devotees participate in this fair. The devotees visit the temple on barefoot in order to receive the great blessings. However, it is the hundreds of horses at the fair that steal the show. Thoroughbred and well- trained 'Marwari' horses perform different skills and even dance to the rhythms of musical instruments much to the amazement of the visitors.  Access  By Road: Bus services are available from other major cities of Rajasthan. Desuri is the nearest bus stand. By Train: The nearest railway station is Rani railway station. By Air: The nearby airport is located at Udaipur.

Flete House is a Grade I listed country house at Holbeton, in the South Hams region of Devon, England. With roots in Saxon times, the Manor of Flete was held by the Damarell family from 1066 until the time of Edward III. The earliest part of the house dates from the sixteenth century, and was substantially rebuilt around 1620 for Sir Charles Hele. The Hele family held the house until 1716, when the estate passed to the Bulteels. Additions were made to the house in both the early and the late eighteenth century. The house was heavily remodelled in the Gothic style in 1835 by John Crocker Bulteel, which obliterated the early and late eighteenth century classical work and added castellations. In 1878 the architect Richard Norman Shaw undertook extensive building works for Henry Bingham Mildmay, remodelling and extending the house, while retaining the sixteenth/seventeenth century house to the south west.National Heritage List for England Flete House was used by the City of Plymouth as a maternity hospital during and after the Second World War. At the start of the war, the estate was in the hands of Lieutenant-Colonel, the Lord Mildmay of Flete. The first baby was born on 14 July 1941, and by the end of 1941 there had been a further 124 births. Lord Mildmay remained in residence at the House until his death in 1947 and was apparently often seen in the Wards. Dave Hill of the pop group Slade was one of the babies born at the House, in 1946. The hospital closed on 8 May 1958, less than a month after the last baby was born there, and the house was returned to the Mildmay family in 1959. In 1979 Flete House was used as the location for the BBC TV series Penmarric, the house represented the house of the title. More recently, the Hall was owned by the Country Houses Association until it went into liquidation in 2003.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/3319953.stmhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/3320907.stm  References  ;Sources *Country Life Vol. 38, 29 November 1915, 680 *Andrew Saint, 1976, Richard Norman Shaw, 211-16 Yale University Press External linksImages of England: detaiiled architectural information of Flete House *Flete House on Geograph Houses in Devon Grade I listed buildings in Devon ","title":"Flete House"},{"id":"19713044","text":"Jean-Baptiste N'Goy Yakassongo (born 20 March 1989) is a Belgian footballer who plays as a winger for RES Acrenoise.

The brush-tailed mulgara is sexually dimorphic with males being much larger than females. Their body length is 12 to 17 cm, and tail length is 6 - 10 cm. They store fat in their tail which at times can be over 1.6 cm wide at the base. The taxonomy of the mulgaras has been confusing, but as of 2006, the species names were clarified as this species being Dasycercus blythi (previously D. cristicauda) and the crest- tailed mulgara (D. cristicauda) previously(D. hillieri) . Physical appearance Dasycercus blythi is a medium sized, sexually dimorphic carnivorous dasyurid. Female body mass is between 50 g and 90 g, with males weighing between 75 g and 120 g. Their body length is 12 to 17 cm, and tail length is 6 - 10 cm.Pavey, C., J. Cole, and J. Woinarski. \\"Brush-tailed Mulgara (Mulgara) Dasycercus Blythi.\\" Threatened Species of the Northern Territory. Northern Territory Government Department of Natural Resources, Environment and the Arts, Dec. 2006. Web. The tail is “of moderate length, shorter than the head and body, incrassated in good seasons (thickened); the proximal two-fifths covered with short still yellow hairs, the remainder with gradually lengthening black hairs that do not however form a crest. The whole of the lower surface is black, with the exception of a small proximal portion which is yellow.”Woolley, P. \\"The Species of Dasycercus Peters, 1875 (Marsupialia: Dasyuridae).\\" Memoirs of Museum Victoria 62.2 (2005): 213-21. Print. The upper portion of fur appears sandy and speckled with brown, while the basal portion appears as a dark grey. The entirety of the under belly, inner side of the limbs, and lining of the pouch are pure white. Dentition shows two premolar teeth in both the upper and lower jaws, with the first observed as smaller than the second in the upper jaw. The most obvious feature that distinguishes D. blythi from D. cristicauda is the sandy colour and the lack of a crest on the tail. Habitat D. blythi is widely distributed, having been observed during different expeditions in the north-western, central, and south-western areas of the arid zone of Australia. While once widespread and common throughout the central deserts of Australia, a decline has been observed during the 1930s, resulting in a more fragmented distribution than previously observed. Considering the sedentary behavior of D. blythi, their spinifex habitat is considered unusual, as it provides a less stable environment that is prone to things such as fire.Körtner, G., C. Pavey, and F. Geiser. \\"Spatial Ecology of the Mulgara in Arid Australia: Impact of Fire History on Home Range Size and Burrow Use.\\" Journal of Zoology 273 (2007): 350-57. Print. Diet D. blythi is an opportunistic carnivorous marsupial eating a wide range of invertebrates, frogs, reptiles, and small mammals. Beetles are one of the most common food sources. The dietary flexibility allows this species to persist and may assist individuals to occupy stable home ranges. Population dynamics Populations often occur as scattered with relatively low population densities while still being locally abundant.\\"Dasycercus Blythi.\\" (Brush-tailed Mulgara). IUCN, 2013. Web. 02 Dec. 2013. Populations of D. blythi are unique in that they are sedentary populations rather than highly mobile, something often observed in smaller dasyurid species, whose movements can range up to several kilometers.Masters, P. \\"Population Dynamics of Dasycercus Blythi (Marsupialia: Dasyuridae) in Central Australia.\\" Wildlife Research 39.6 (2012): 419-28. Print. Populations decline consistently during the winter and spring, possibly due to decreased food during the winter season, reducing available food for potentially pregnant females that would need to feed their young, and reduction of available males due to aggressive competition for access to females earlier in the year. Notably, dramatic increases in population can be observed after large rainfall events, which are thought to come from D. blythi's competition with small rodent population explosions following such events.Letnic, M., and C. R. Dickman. \\"Resource Pulses and Mammalian Dynamics: Conceptual Models for Hummock Grasslands and Other Australian Desert Habitats.\\" Biological Reviews 85 (2010): 501-21. Print. Young female mothers have been observed to remain near the location of their birth, while young males often spread out, reducing competition for food, increasing opportunities to breed, and avoid potential inbreeding. Once males find a home range, they become sedentary due to increased fitness by remaining in a familiar area rather than moving to new, uncharted territory. Reproduction D. blythi breeds seasonally, producing only one litter a year with litters reproducing the year following their birth. This reproductive strategy is different from that of other dasyurids, which often birth multiple litters a year to balance unpredictable reproductive conditions. Their monoestry is thought to arise from increased access to larger and more reliably available prey, such as small mammals and reptiles, which are inaccessible by smaller dasyurids. Unlike other dasyurids, males do not die after breeding.\\"Mulgara.\\" Australian Wildlife Conservancy, n.d. Web. 02 Dec. 2013. Studies suggest that the onset of breeding occurs by the timing of the female oestrus, as males were observed to be in proper conditions to reproduce for about a month prior to the occurrence of breeding. Gestation ranges from 30 to 48 days, being extended by factors such as scarce food resources, low temperatures, and frequency of torpor. After birth, the young suckle between 12 and 15 weeks by hanging below the female's body due to a reduced pouch, a pair of lateral flaps. A maximum of six young have been found in the pouches of collected specimens.Woolley, P. \\"Studies on the Crest- tailed Mulgara Dasycercus Cristicauda and the Brush-tailed Mulgara Dasycercus Blythi (Marsupialia: Dasyuridae).\\" The University of Sydney Library, Australia 28.1 (2006): 117-20. Print. The sex ratio in litters is 1:1, and while offspring may survive more than one mating season, only a small proportion of the population survives into a third year. In captivity, up to a five-year lifespan has been observed. Behavior D. blythi digs deep burrows, providing protection from the extremes of climate and potentially the predation by introduced European species to which other small and medium-sized desert mammals often fall prey. Burrows have been observed to be about 0.5 m deep and generally occupied by a single individual outside the breeding season. Certain populations have about half of the burrows used by an individual only once, while others were used over long periods of time, repeatedly. Torpor is often employed by D. blythi, entering torpor at night until midday. This practice is not abandoned during reproduction even with the associated energy costs. Its benefit is felt both in summer and winter seasons, as it allows for reduction of endogenous heat production and maintenance of energy spent to be below basal metabolic rate.Körtner, G., C. Pavey, and F. Geiser. \\"Thermal Biology, Torpor, and Activity in Free-living Mulgaras in Arid Zone Australia during the Winter Reproductive Season.\\" Physiological and Biochemical Zoology 81.4 (2008): 442-51. Print. Conservation status Numbers within the D. blythi population fluctuate greatly in accordance with climate conditions, which make population estimates difficult to establish, thus creating difficulty in tracking population trends. The cause of decline in the D. blythi population is unknown, and threatening processes have not been able to be confirmed; potential threats include changes in fire regimens, grazing by introduced herbivores such as cattle and rabbits, and predation by introduced predators from European settlement. Another hypothesis is that environmental damage has had a negative impact on the mulgara population. To provide further protection and future proliferation, animal surveys using targeted trapping and patch burning programs are used to create an ideal habitat.\\"Mammals.\\" Parks Australia, 17 Dec. 2012. Web. 02 Dec. 2013. Fire does not have a negative impact on population as long as 15% cover is maintained. Care for the mulgara habitat, especially with controlled burns, should employ a fire regime that burns a mosaic of land with no particular piece of land being burnt more often than once per three to five years.\\"Management Guidelines for Brush-tailed Mulgara Dasycercus Blythi  Northern Land Manager.\\" Management Guidelines for Brush- tailed Mulgara Dasycercus Blythi  Northern Land Manager.

The classes are predominantly led by former or serving members of the British Armed Forces. BMF was founded in 1999 as British Military Fitness and pioneered the concept of group classes for outdoor fitness in the United Kingdom. In September 2018 it was purchased by NM Capital and Bear Grylls Ventures and re-branded as Be Military Fit. History British Military Fitness (BMF) was founded in 1999 by retired Major Robin Cope (Anglians), Corporal Harry Sowerby (4RGJ) and Corporal William Skinner (10 Para). The idea was born on the film set of Saving Private Ryan in October 1998. Robin Cope suggested the idea of training civilians in parks. He thought that an added emphasis should be made on providing motivation, which was lacking in the majority of those who work out in gyms. Harry Sowerby had just completed his Reservist Army Physical Training Instructors course (PTI) and along with Will Skinner agreed to join with Robin in this new venture. Each invested £1000, so with a total of £3000 BMF was launched. £1000 was spent on some second hand computers, some money was spent on class equipment like mats and numbered bibs and £1000 was spent on one Evening Standard advert. The first-ever BMF class was held in Hyde Park in April or June 1999 (sources vary) and attracted three or ten clients (sources vary). By the end of the year, there were 200 members. The company expanded rapidly, requiring significant investment in 2002 to avoid bankruptcy. Growth accelerated across the United Kingdom in the mid 2000s, and a spin-off launched in South Africa in 2008. The classes and brand name became recognisable around the country, pioneering the growth in the market for outdoor fitness group classes. The company innovated training and partnerships in the industry and expanded into events and fitness holidays.Lombard, Daniel \\"British Military Fitness gets ex-homeless to exercise\\", \\"Community Care\\", 2008-09-24 retrieved on 2008-10-10 By 2010 there were 16,000 members at 100 parks, and in 2016 BMF was training 13,000 people weekly, having expanded its venues to 140 parks around the UK. In September 2018, British Military Fitness was purchased by NM Capital and Bear Grylls Ventures and re-branded as Be Military Fit, still using the acronym BMF. It claims to be Europe’s largest outdoor fitness company, training 30,000 people annually. Format Each lesson lasts approximately sixty minutes, and, in order to cater for all abilities, classes are broken up into three ability groups indicated by the wearing of coloured bibs: blue for beginners, red for intermediates and green for advanced. The first ten minutes of a class are spent warming up, before fifty minutes of intense fitness exercises, which can vary from circuit training, relays, sprints, military activities and team games. The class is punctuated by a quick water break at the midpoint and ends with a five-minute cool-down and stretching session.

He is best known for his many works on the English Catholic martyrs, which helped to keep their memories alive in the newly reemerging Catholic Church of Victorian England. Life He was born Reginald Camm on 26 December 1864 in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey (then Middlesex), England, the son of John Brooke Maher Camm, a retired cavalryman of the 12th Royal Lancers and his wife, Caroline Arden.Archives of the monastic community of Downside Abbey, through the courtesy of the Office of the Abbot. As a youth he was educated first at Westminster School and then at Keble College, Oxford, from which he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Theology in 1884. Camm was ordained a minister in the Church of England in 1888, and passed a short period as a curate at St Agnes, Kennington Park. He was drawn to the Catholic Church, however, and he became a convert to Catholicism in 1890, received at Maredsous Abbey in Belgium. He was accepted into the novitiate of the abbey on 8 September of that same year and made his first profession as a monk on 8 December 1891. He was then sent to the Pontifical Atheneum of St. Anselm in Rome for further studies, where he was solemnly professed on Christmas Day 1894 and ordained as a Catholic priest on 9 March 1895 at the Basilica of St. John Lateran, by Cardinal Parocchi. Camm was then sent to live at Erdington Abbey, one of the first English members in a community of refugee monks from Germany.(PDF) Camm developed a strong devotion to the English Martyrs who were being beatified by Pope Leo XIII during that period, seeing them as heroic witnesses to his new faith, who were also natives of England . Out of this, he was to publish his two-volume work Lives of the English Martyrs in 1904. While he was working on his book, he came to know Mother Mary of St. Peter, foundress of the Benedictine Adorers of the Sacred Heart of Montmartre. She had just led her new monastic community from Paris, due to the anti- clerical laws enacted in France at the time. The nuns built a new monastery located in Tyburn, the place of execution of many of the Catholic martyrs of the Tudor period. They opened a small shrine to the martyrs in the crypt of the monastery chapel and became the caretakers of the site. Camm developed a deep respect for the foundress. In 1909 Camm came to the rescue of the Tyburn nuns. The financial situation of the nuns' monastery had become so severe that they were in process of selling the property, and had already packed. He approached Mother St. Peter and offered to help them with a legacy he had received from his father, clearing their debts and funding the construction of a novitiate for their priory. This donation saved the community in its early days, and the site of devotion to England's martyrs. Retrieved 24 January 2012. He went on to help develop the site, obtaining more relics and stained glass windows in erecting a larger shrine. It was he who designed a recreation of the Tyburn Tree for the sanctuary of the shrine, as a baldachin over the altar.Alton. From 1912 to 1913 he was at Maredsous Abbey in Belgium. After the corporate conversion of Caldey Abbey to the Catholic Church—among the first of its kind accepted by Rome, at the invitation of the abbot of that monastery, in June 1913 Camm went to serve as their Master of novices. In addition to this work, he spent the next year touring England, lecturing and preaching to raise funds for the support of Caldey and of the nuns at Tyburn.

The Company of the Wolf is an Australian combat reenactment and living history group, re-enacting a mercenary company of the High Middle Ages to the Late Middle Ages, portraying a timeline of the great warring periods of the Middle Ages, from the later Crusading period of 1250, through the Hundred Years' War, to the end of the Wars of the Roses and Bosworth Field in 1485. Portraying a collection of the finest hired blades in Europe, the Company's ranks include members representative of the landless nobility, grizzled professional campaigners and humble foot soldiers, as well as a variety of camp followers drawn from across Western Europe.  Aims  The group's charter states that its intent is twofold; \\"To be an accessible reenactment group, catering to anyone with an interest in mediaeval European history, a suitable place in the group will be found for anyone with any level of experience or interest, and; To provide an accurate, interesting and fun educational experience to any institution or educational group interested in learning more about this interesting and largely misunderstood period of history.Company of the Wolf founding committee (2005). \\"Company of the Wolf Charter\\" Company of the Wolf letters of incorporation, University of New England Printery Service, Armidale, Australia \\"  Origins and history  The Company of the Wolf formed during 2005 to provide a vehicle for mediaeval historians and re-enactors living in and around the New England region of New South Wales. Traditionally the Company has retained close links to other groups in Australia, frequently supplying members to reinforce the displays and shows of other groups. The Company is notable for its mascot Loupes De Guerre, or \\"war wolves\\". Historically, wolves, or other fierce breeds, would be unleashed before close quarters combat to break and demoralise enemy infantry formations. The Company of the Wolf use the considerably friendlier Siberian Husky to represent these dogs of war, equipping them with historically accurate armour. While dogs are frequent attendants in historical re-enactment, Company of the Wolf claims to be the only reenactment group in Australia that fields a dedicated armoured war dog sub unit. Members of the Company of the Wolf at the Abbey Mediaeval Tournament 2008, portraying examples from the 15th century, from left to right, Civilian dress, an armoured pikeman and an armoured handgunner  Traditions and customs  The Company of the Wolf has a number of internal traditions and customs based on mediaeval practices. = Knighthood = Members of The Company of the Wolf who have attended three or more major events as members of the Company are awarded the rank of knight. This involves a traditional accolade or \\"dubbing\\" ceremony, where the newly elevated member is tapped on the shoulder with a sword and presented to his fellows, followed by a blow from a mailed fist. This represents the last blow that the new knight may ever take without responding to the challenge. The new knight is then presented with a small token of his or her new rank, often a badge. Once a knight, the member is referred to as \\"Sir\\" or \\"Lady\\", and has the right to wear spurs in the field to display his or her status to friends and foe alike. The knights of the Company of the Wolf are occasionally referred to collectively as \\"Knights of the Order of the Wolf\\". Unlike mediaeval orders of knighthood, both male and female members who are granted membership in the order are referred to as \\"knights\\", although their pre-nominal honorifics are gender specific. The Company of the Wolf banner, displaying the arms of the Company and the individual arms of the senior members of the Company = The Wolf Banner = When the Company of the Wolf deploys as a group, the Wolf banner is displayed. This is a large black banner displaying the arms of the Company. When static, this banner remains in the campsite signifying the Company is present and deployed as a unit. On parade or for combat displays, the banner can be carried by two bearers to announce that members of the Company have taken the field. When a member of the Company of the Wolf achieves the rank of knight, the armorial achievement of the member may be added to the banner in miniature. Children of knights, even when not knights themselves, are permitted to display their arms alongside their parents' with appropriate marks of cadency. As accessibility and inclusiveness are key components of the group's mission, children of members have always been encouraged to participate. When an existing member, male or female, becomes the parent of a new child, the baby is bestowed honorary membership until the age of 14, when they may decide for themselves if they wish to continue participation with the Company. = The Wolf's Tail Badge = Members of the Company of the Wolf will sometimes wear a \\"wolf's tail\\" hanging from their belts in both civilian and military attire as a form of group identification. As foxes are officially classed as vermin in Australia, members forgo the use of real wolves tails, and large fox tails are preferred. These \\"wolves' tails\\" are also sometimes hung from the poles of the Wolf Banner as a further embellishment of the Banner as the Company's rallying point.  Events  The Company of the Wolf supplies displays, encampments and re-enactors to several high profile re- enactment events in Australia, including the Abbey Tournament at Caboolture in Queensland, and the Vikings! Exhibition at the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney. The Company also provides educational or \\"interest\\" displays for schools, universities or social groups when requested. Company members cover a range of mediaeval interests, and the group is structured in such a way as to allow the widest range of participation possible. This gives the Company of the Wolf a high degree of versatility, and allows the group to display and educate in civilian and military aspects of mediaeval life. The Company is lucky to count among its members and associates experts in a range of combat styles, mediaeval fashion and clothes making, armouring, heraldry and even mediaeval midwifery. Company of the Wolf is also notable for being one of the few mediaeval living history groups in Australia to field historically accurate black-powder weapons and crews. As well as public displays and shows, the Company of the Wolf also deploy privately to a number of immersive events for re-enactors along the East Coast of Australia.

It is Australia's highest selling weekly magazine. History and profile The magazine was previously part of ACP Magazines, which in turn was owned by Nine Entertainment Co which owns Australian television network Nine Network. Because of this, Woman's Day often featured many stories either based on or in partnership with a Nine Network program, such as A Current Affair. The magazine became part of Bauer Media Group in 2012, after Nine Entertainment Co got into financial difficulties. It is published weekly by Bauer Media Pty Ltd and is headquartered in Sydney. Aimed at women aged 25 to 54, it primarily features news, gossip and interviews about Australian and international celebrities, as well as some lifestyle and recipes. Sales figures, readership and advertising revenue have fallen significantly in recent years, down from 405,000 weekly sales in 2010 to 330,000 in March 2014.Audited Media Association of Australia April 2014 Readership fell another 14.6% in the year ended 2014.Roy Morgan research 'Australian Magazine Readership 12 months to Dec 2014' In early April 2020, Bauer Media Australia announced that it would be closing Woman's Day as well as several Australian and New Zealand brands including The Australian Women's Weekly and New Zealand Woman's Weekly in response to the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia and New Zealand. On 17 June 2020, Australian investment company Mercury Capital acquired Woman's Day as part of its purchase of Bauer Media's Australian and New Zealand assets. On 17 July, Mercury Capital announced that it would be publishing Woman's Day and several other Australian and New Zealand titles. Controversies In 2007, the magazine settled out of court with New Zealand television presenter Charlotte Dawson, who had sued the magazine over its coverage of her divorce. The magazine underwent significant layoffs in 2008. In November 2013, Woman's Day came under fire from its readers after a story featuring Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, took issue with her appearance by comparing a photo of her before having her baby and after with the headline 'What's happened to Kate?' Criticism suggested that women who have just had a baby often look tired, and she was not wearing makeup in the second image like she was in the first. In 2014, television presenter Grant Denyer began legal precedings against the magazine after it claimed he and his wife were in a rehab facility in Thailand for meth addiction. Denyer claimed they had visited a rehab facility, but it was not for drug issues, and reaffirmed they did not have a drug addiction. The magazine backed the story saying Denyer's friends were their sources for the story. Woman's Day was criticised on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Media Watch, in which it was described as \\"garbage journalism\\" for the use of sensationalist headlines and content.ABC Media Watch 7/7/14 References External linksWoman's Day 1953 establishments in Australia ACP magazine titles Mercury Capital Weekly magazines published in Australia Women's magazines published in Australia Celebrity magazines Magazines established in 1953 Magazines published in Sydney ","title":"Woman's Day (Australian magazine)"},{"id":"19713345","text":"The Artivist Film Festival & Awards is an international film festival and awards ceremony dedicated to recognizing activist efforts of filmmakers, specifically in the areas of human rights, child advocacy, environmental preservation, and animal rights.

It has been providing theatrical and cinematic entertainment to the Champaign-Urbana community since its doors opened in 1921. Each year, the Virginia Theatre is host to movies from film reels, plays from various acting troupes, concerts, and Ebertfest, presented by the UIUC College of Media. It is currently owned by the Champaign Park District. History The Virginia Theatre opened December 28, 1921 with a live stage performance of \\"The Bat\\". The following night, the silent films Tol'able David and The Boat were shown at the theatre. Since then, it has been presenting movies, live concerts, and plays to the Champaign-Urbana community and has only been closed for short periods of renovation by the Park District. Until recently, the Virginia Theatre was privately owned. From the 1930s to the 1960s, RKO pictures held ownership. Subsequently, George Kerasotes Corporation (GKC Theatres) owned the building until it was sold to the Virginia Theater Group, a not-for-profit organization, organized for that purpose in the 1990s. The Champaign Park District purchased it in January 2000. The theatre was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003, based on its historical role in providing a wide variety of entertainment to Champaign and surrounding area, particularly in the years between 1921 and 1953. Of note were theatrical productions, vaudeville, concerts, and motion pictures. Also noteworthy was the building's state of preservation and the integrity of its original early to mid 20th century roots. Restoration A major part of the Virginia Theatre is its restoration. In December 1999, the Champaign Park District received a $900,000 grant from the State of Illinois to restore the then run-down theatre. Extensive work was done to bring the building up to current code, most of it not visible to the general public. In 2000, the curved movie screen that had been in place for decades was replaced with a smaller screen (50-foot wide viewable image) which can be flown offstage. Additional restrooms were completed in 2001. Box office renovation, dressing room remodeling, and carpet replacement took place in 2002-2003. The east lobby/storefront was remodeled during 2007, and the main lobbies and concession stand were renovated and redecorated in 2010, thanks to a considerable donation from Michael Carragher.http://www.allbusiness.com/construction/building- renovation/14069980-1.html The decaying 1930s-era neon marquee was removed from the theatre on November 16, 2010, and it was replaced with a newly designed marquee in September 2011, in spite of opposition from many community members and historic preservation advocates.http://www.allbusiness.com/government/government-bodies- offices/14220173-1.html Wurlitzer Theatre Pipe Organ In 1921, the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company installed a theatre organ to provide musical accompaniment for silent films. That 2/8 (two keyboard, eight ranks of pipes) instrumenthttp://www.theatreorgans.com/il/champaign/ was removed by Buzard Pipe Organ Buildershttp://buzardorgans.com/ of Champaign in December 2010 for renovation,http://www.champaignparkdistrict.com/board/101110_Minutes_Reg.pdf and it was reinstalled in the Fall of 2011. Events The Virginia Theatre hosts a wide variety of events throughout the year. One weekend a month, classic movies are played on a 56-foot wide screen. These movies range from 1940s movies such as White Christmas to cult favorites like The Big Lebowski. Tickets to each of two screenings are 5 dollars and there is also a raffle to win a DVD of the movie being played. Some months have themes reflecting the holidays, such as Christmas, Valentine's Day, and Halloween. There is also College and Kids night. Beginning a few years ago, the Champaign Park District began hosting \\"Reel Deals\\" at the Virginia Theatre. Showing newer releases, Reel Deals are shown for $3 on Tuesdays and Thursdays on an irregular schedule. From 1992 until 2010, the Champaign-Urbana Theatre Company, or CUTC, performed plays at the theatre. CUTC once again performs shows starting in 2016. Roger Ebert's Film Festival A statue of Roger Ebert giving his \\"thumbs up\\" outside the Virginia Theater. Every April, the Theatre is host to Ebertfest: Roger Ebert's Film Festival. Beginning in 1999 as Roger Ebert's Overlooked Film Festival, it has become a very popular event with festival passes selling out well in advance. Founded by Chicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert, The event hosts several less known films as well some popular films. Following Ebert's death in 2013, organizers in Champaign announced plans to raise $125,000 to build a life-size bronze statue of Ebert in the town. The composition was selected by Ebert's wife Chaz and depicts him sitting in the middle of three theater seats giving his trademark \\"thumbs up\\" gesture. The sculpture was unveiled at the 2014 Ebertfest, and sits directly outside the theater.

Through a formal document dated 4 April 1422, his maternal grandfather, the Constable Nuno Álvares Pereira, granted to him the County of Ourém. However, this grant only gained the Portuguese King Edward’s royal confirmation on 24 November 1433. Alphonse was sent by the King as his special ambassador to the Council of Basel (1436) and to the Council of Florence (1439), during which time he also visited Ferrara and Rome. In a document issued on 11 October 1451, King Afonso V of Portugal granted him the title of Marquis of Valença. He was the first Portuguese nobile to be made a Marquis. During October 1451, he escorted Infanta Eleanor of Portugal (King Edward’s daughter) on her journey from Lisbon to Livorno, where she met her betrothed, Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor. They were married in Rome, with Pope Nicholas V blessing their marriage. In 1458, Alphonse took part in the Portuguese expedition to north Africa which led to the capture of the Moroccan city of Alcácer Ceguer (Al Qsar as-Seghir). Alphonse had a natural son with Dona Beatriz de Sousa (it is said that they were secretly married). This son, Afonso de Portugal, was required to join the clergy by King John II of Portugal. Afonso de Portugal was appointed Bishop of Évora. He had a natural son named Francisco de Portugal (Francis of Portugal) who was later appointed as Francis I, 1st Count of Vimioso, from whom Counts of Vimioso descend.

Geography  Austinville covers approximately 20 kilometres squared and is situated in the Gold Coast Hinterland between Mudgeeraba and Springbrook. Austinville is located in a valley through which flows Mudgeeraba Creek and the rugged Nimmel Range looms in the distance. Significant rainforest exists in the area. Areas in the south are protected within Springbrook National Park.  History  Austinville settlement was established as a banana plantation in 1934, making it one of the Gold Coast's oldest suburbs. It was started as an attempt to resettle unemployed people on the land following the Great Depression, and therefore lift the economy. It was named after Under-Secretary for Labour at the time, William Henry Austin, who encouraged the building of many of these plantations throughout the state. Land was cleared and divided into blocks and 50 or so small homes were built too. Mudgeeraba Creek flowed behind the homes along the valley floor, and the rugged Nimmel Range bordered on the settlement's western side. The settlement was very short lived. By 1939, within just 5 years, most families had left the area. Rainforest has crept back into much of the once banana farming valley, and the area remains dwarfed by the surrounding conservation area. Austinville State School opened on 25 June 1934 and closed on 9 June 1939. At the 2011 Australian Census the suburb recorded a population of 361.

He was one of the nine generals that lead a force of 60,000 troops to occupied Nanjing in 1864. Zhu was awarded a third- class merit for the recovery Nanjing. Although Zhu was awarded a third-class merit for the recovery Nanjing after Commander Zeng Guoquan commended Zhu's work to the Beijing government, there were dissenting opinions that Zhu should have received the first merit instead of Li Chendian. The First-Wave Offensive During the Battle of Nanjing (1864), on 19 July the attackers detonated explosives in a tunnel under Taiping Gate (), bringing somewhere between 2 and 10 km of the wall down. Zhu led 1800 soldiers through the breach, into the city, but 460 were killed by the bombs of the weakened Taiping defenders. Zhu's troops took Taiping on the following day.

He remained faithful to this movement all his life, but one of his last actions was to precipitate a split in the already fractured movement. When a number of members of a failing assembly at Ryde had stopped attending the meeting, he travelled down and met with some of them and celebrated the Lord's Supper. A furious row erupted with different assemblies disagreeing about which side was right and therefore to be supported, with Darby, who had privately sympathised with him, attacking him in the strongest terms. The row escalated but was not resolved.

Steven Epstein, an attorney, was elected treasurer in 1991 and remained treasurer through January 2012. MassCann seeks to raise public awareness about Cannabis sativa's use and potential in Massachusetts To those ends MC leaders and members have written, published, spoken, debated, marched, rallied, organized, donated, illustrated, and otherwise volunteered in numerous ways. = 2020 Board Member Controversy = In January 2020, MassCann elected Samson Racioppi to its Board of Directors. Racioppi is also President of Super Happy Fun America, which has organized events surrounding Straight pride and Blue Lives Matter. Amid the George Floyd protests of 2020, SHFA organized a rally supporting Law Enforcement which took place on 25 June 2020. In response to MassCann members' and the general public's reaction to Racioppi's role in the rally, MassCann had its affiliation with the national NORML organization suspended until it shows a \\"clear opposition to bigotry.\\" MassCann called an emergency board meeting on 1 July 2020 in response to the suspension of their chapter status. After the Board unanimously called for his removal from the Board, Racioppi ultimately resigned. Members also called for the removal of Bill Flynn as Board Member and President due to persistent \\"bullying\\" of members, vendors, and partners. Other board members alleged that Flynn's behavior had caused the loss of 200 members in just one year, and that vendors and partners were dropping out of events because they felt disrespected by Flynn. Flynn felt the allegations were not sufficient for him to resign, and refused to step down. The Board (minus Samson at the request of the Members) voted on a series of questions from the bylaws which governed if they were able to forcibly remove Flynn. The board ultimately failed to remove Flynn involuntarily; however, they were successfully able to call for a vote of no-confidence in Flynn as President of the organization. Throughout the discussion surrounding Flynn, Members continuously called to ban Flynn from MassCann as a whole, and the Board encouraged members to request a vote calling for his removal as a Board Member and Member of MassCann. MassCann events The group organizes the Freedom Rally held on the third Saturday in September on Boston Common. It is traditionally the second largest annual gathering demanding marijuana law reform in the United States, after the Seattle Hempfest. MC has successfully sued the City of Boston for permits for the Freedom Rally three times. MassCann's Freedom Rally in Boston 2008 Other MC events include: * Co-sponsorship of two Harvard Law School conferences on drug policy, first on May 18, 1991 and second on May 21, 1994. * A July 11, 1992 protest and march in Chelmsford, Massachusetts in opposition to the taking of the Farmer family residence by forfeiture. * Tax Day protests from 1994 until 1998, calling for the taxation of regulated marijuana sales, held at the last post office open in the state on Tax Day, the Boston Postal Annex. At one of those protests hundreds of ounce bags of marijuana seed were thrown to the crowd. * Annual Boston participation in the Global Marijuana March from 2004 on. * Benefit shows in rock clubs around Boston. Organization MC has virtually no overhead costs, with neither personnel nor offices. Every action of MassCann is done by volunteers. The MassCann board of directors and officers were honored as High Times Freedom Fighters of the Month. March 2012 saw many long-term directors stepping down and first-time directors coming in. A women's group was formed that intends to inform the Massachusetts public of benefits for women's issues such as premenstrual stress. Co-founder attorney Steve Epstein has departed. Bill Downing is among long-term directors remaining on board. Various sub-chapters of MC have been formed over the years, the most notable of which is the University of Massachusetts Amherst Cannabis Reform Coalition (UMassCRC). Their annual spring Extravaganja rally on Amherst Common has grown in popularity over the years. MassCann legislative partners In the 1990s MC worked closely with the ACLU- Massachusetts Drug Policy Task Force and the Massachusetts Coalition for Medical Cannabis or MC2 on legislative issues including: * Passage of the Bertonazzi bill: An act creating a marijuana therapeutic research program in the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, passed by the legislature and signed into law by the governor in 1992. It is codified at M.G.L. c. 94D. Over 14,000 signatures were gathered in this effort * Passage of the Joe Hutchins Act: A medical necessity defense for the possession of marijuana which was signed by Governor William Weld in August 1997. It is codified at M.G.L. c. 94C, s. 34. In 1999 MassCann activists formed the Committee for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (CRML) in support of a proposed statewide ballot initiative that would decriminalize adult possession of marijuana in Massachusetts. Though the all-volunteer signature drive gathered over 20,000 signatures, it fell short of the required 57,000 and the initiative effort was abandoned. Beginning in 1996 MassCann activists targeted state senatorial and representative districts with public policy questions on local ballots. These non-binding ballot questions were run in districts where the senator or representative held sway over and stood in opposition to medicinal cannabis or decriminalization legislation. The questions, when approved, told the legislator to introduce and support medicinal cannabis or decriminalization legislation. The legislators were free to disobey these directives from their constituencies (as they are non-binding), but by doing so would demonstrate disrespect for the wishes of the voters. Eventually public policy questions were run in 41 districts. Some were run by former MassCann board members who formed the Drug Policy Forum of Massachusetts (DPFMA). Every one of the 41 public policy questions run up until now has passed with an average of 63% of the voters in support (almost 2 to 1). The results from these public policy questions caught the attention of the Marijuana Policy Project and inspired their funding of a statewide decriminalization ballot initiative. That initiative passed by a comfortable 30+ point margin (34.8% opposed; 65.2% for).

Biography Zilzer was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, to German-Jewish emigrant Max Zilzer, who was employed at the local theater. Zilzer's mother died soon after his birth, and his father returned to Germany in 1905. Zilzer appeared on stage in child roles and made his first movie appearance in the age of 14. Around 1930, he moved back to the United States, but had only small success as an actor. He returned to Germany. According to a 1943 Jewish Telegraphic Agency newspaper article, he \\"was a featured player of UFA in the palmy days before the Furore [Hitler]\\", but after Adolf Hitler's rise to power, Zilzer fled to France, where he worked dubbing voices in several French versions of Hollywood productions. In 1935, Zilzer returned to Germany again, finally emigrating to the US in 1937. Applying for a visa at the U.S. embassy, he first realized he already had US citizenship. After his emigration, he started to work with Ernst Lubitsch in several anti-Nazi movies, using pseudonyms to protect his father, who was still living in Berlin. With appearances in films from 1915 to 1986, Zilzer had one of the longest careers in cinema history. The Internet Broadway Database lists a single credit for a Wolfgang Zilzer, in the 1943 play The Barber Had Two Sons. Zilzer married the German-Jewish actress Lotte Palfi; both appeared in the 1942 movie Casablanca. Zilzer played the man without a passport who is shot by French policemen at the beginning of the film. After World War II, Zilzer performed on stage in the United States and in Germany. At the end of the 1980s Zilzer contracted Parkinson's disease and decided to return to Germany. His wife refused to do so, and their marriage ended in divorce after almost 50 years, close to both their deaths. Wolfgang Zilzer died in Berlin on June 26, 1991 aged 90 and is buried at the Waldfriedhof Zehlendorf.

He travelled extensively around the world in the late Victorian period detailing wildlife often for the first time. He is noted for illustrations that are of a particularly exact nature. Early life John Guille Millais was the fourth son and seventh child of Sir John Everett Millais, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood painter, and his wife Effie Gray. John was raised in London and Perthshire with a wide interest in natural history, which embraced horticulture, hunting including big game hunting and wildfowl. As a boy he made a collection of birds shot around the Perthshire coast of Scotland where he spent much of his childhood. This formed the basis of a lifetime collection of around 3,000 specimens that he later housed in a private museum in Horsham in West Sussex, England.Birds of the World – Chapter on Great Bird Artists IPC magazines 1969 Specimens from this collection were depicted by his father in his painting The Ruling Passion (also known as The Ornithologist). John Guille himself painted a bird in his father's painting Dew-Drenched Furze.Knowledge and Family in Millais's The Ruling PassionJ G Millais, The Life and Letters of Sir John Everett Millais, vol 2, pp. 173, 213–4 Working life Millais began his career in the army with the Seaforth Highlanders, but after six years he resigned to travel the world. His was clearly a wanderlust based on a desire to see, record and paint the natural world. To this end he travelled widely in Europe, Africa and North America. In the New World in the 1880s/90s he explored Canada and Newfoundland Reprinted by Abercrombie & Fitch Co., New York and helped map uncharted areas of Alaska. Arthur Neumann (1897) In 1903 Millais co-founded the Society for the Preservation of the Wild Fauna of the Empire (SPWFE). Clearly a clubbable and convivial man in 1909 Millais was a founder member of the Shikar Club, a sportsclub where like-minded associates could dine and discuss their passion for hunting especially big game hunting. Millais was passionate about hunting and fellow members included the famous hunters Frederick Selous (the brother of ornithologist Edmund Selous) and explorer and hunter Frank Wallace. The club still survives and includes the Duke of Edinburgh amongst its members. After World War I broke out in 1914, Millais was taken into the secret service of the Royal Navy in Norway and in Iceland. As he later explained in his autobiographical book Wanderings and Memories, he was involved in counter-espionage, provided with the rank of Lieutenant-Commander and was appointed British Vice-Counsul at Hammerfest in northern Norway where he stayed until 1917. In August 1915 he met with two German spies at Christiania, and travelled with them to Lofoten. He was engaged in setting up and supporting a network of counter espionage. The importance of Norway to the war effort was that the northern seas provided a route for food and materials to reach British ports. Millais reported from Norway that whilst the Norwegian authorities were generally pro British, much of the population were pro German. In December 1917 he was nearly captured by the Germans but with the help of a harbour master he managed to get out of Norway, returning to Newcastle.J.G. Millais, Wanderings and Memories, Longmans (1919)All About Horsham magazine, Millais Mystery, (9 July 2011) After the War, Millais wrote and published a book on his life and hunting exploits in Africa and Scotland. Wanderings and Memories chronicled his passion for big game hunting and his fondness for the Scotland of his childhood. It contains a chapter from Millais' close friend, African game hunter Arthur Henry Neumann.J G Millais, Wanderings and Memories, Longmans and Co., London (1919) This book went to several reprints including an American edition renamed A Sportsman's Wanderings.J G Millais, A Sportsman's Wanderings, Houghton Miffen Company, Boston (1920) In 1921 he travelled with his son Raoul Millais to the southern Sudan and mapped for the first time large areas of Bahr al Ghazal, an exploit which led to a book on the Upper Nile, Far Away Up The Nile, published in 1924. Artistic career Mallard from British Surface Feeding Ducks by J G Millais Teal from British Surface Feeding Ducks by J G Millais Millais is one of the most respected of British ornithologists and bird artists,IPC magazines, Birds of the World – Chapter on Great Bird Artists, 1969, Unattributed quotation producing between 1890 and 1914 a series of books on birds and other natural history subjects. In the study of ornithology he was renowned for his portraiture of wildfowl and game birds, the subjects of his three most famous works: Natural History of British Feeding Ducks;J G Millais, Natural History of British feeding Ducks, (1902) British Diving DucksJ G Millais, British Diving Ducks, (1913) and British Game Birds.J G Millais, British Game Birds, (1909) They rank amongst the finest work on wildfowl ever published. Each bird receives individual treatment in text and detailed chromolithographs, some of which are by his friend and pre-eminent bird artist of the day Archibald Thorburn (1860–1935). Each species is represented by two or three individuals on a plate drawn in attitudes of feeding, resting and courtship. The books are lavish and with just 400 to 600 original editions published are now prized as examples of a certain type of High Victorian grandeur. Millais' skills are essentially Victorian, as private wealth allowed him to indulge his passions on a grand scale. He was undoubtedly tenacious. His son Raoul spoke of him as an \\"astonishing man and his power of concentration was such that once he took up a subject he never left it until he knew more about it than anyone in the World\\"Duff Hart Davis, Raoul Millais: his life and work (1998) This tenacity to get a job done to the best of abilities was well-illustrated in his preparations for Mammals of Great Britain and Ireland (1904)J G Millais, Mammals of Great Britain and Ireland, Longman, Green & Co., (1904) where he spent months with the whaling fleet in the Atlantic to study first hand a group of mammals that had hitherto received little attention. The work which appeared in a limited print run in 1904 also contains illustrations and chromolithographs by George Edward Lodge (1860–1954) and Archibald Thorburn. In 1917 Millais published the first of two volumes on rhododendrons and their various hybrids. The edition was limited to 550 copies with 17 full colour plates of gardens and plants at his home, Compton Brow in Horsham. In the preface Millais explains that he began cultivating rhododendrons under the tutelage of his neighbour the naturalist and botanist Sir Edmund LoderJ G Millais ,Rhododendrons and Their Various Hybrids, Longmans (1917) Millais wrote biographies of his father, John Everett Millais,J G Millais, The Life and Letters of Sir John Everett Millais, President of the Royal Academy. London (1899) and Frederick Courtney Selous.J G Millais, The Life of Frederick Courtney Selous DSO capt 25th Royal Fusiliers, Longmans (1919) In addition he became an authority on rhododendrons,J G Millais, Rhododendrons, published in two volumes in 1917 and 1924 azaleas and magnolias and exhibited as a sculptor of birds including one of fighting game birds; the sculpture is now owned by the Horsham Museum. Family life in Sussex Johnny Millais c 1907 Major Geoffroy De Carteret Millais died of wounds in France on 21 August 1918 Millais married Frances \\"Fanny\\" Margaret Skipworth, daughter of a Lincolnshire landowner. He settled his family at Horsham in West Sussex. Their first child, Daphne, was born in 1895 (died of appendicitis in 1904). Geoffroy \\"George\\" was born in 1896 (killed in action, August 1918). Raoul was born in 1901; he became a noted artist in his own right. Rosamond (or Rosamund) was born in 1904. In 1900 Millais arranged for the building of a house called Compton's Brow in Horsham from where he created a private museum consisting of 14,000 specimens.All About Horsham magazine, April 2014 P 64 The collection assembled at Horsham reflected his broad interests and included specimens of big game, deer, waterfowl, bats, seals. The collection even included a whole grizzly bear and a Tay salmon weighing 50 lb. He continually created illustrations and painted his wildlife collection. Millais would regularly take off for months at a time to go hunting and to travel, bringing back numerous specimens to add to his vast collection. This continued until well into the 1920s. When in Horsham he entertained widely and enthusiastically. Hilaire Belloc would come to dinner once a month and would sit up to the early hours of the morning drinking large amounts of beer as the non-imbibing Millais listened to his extravagant tales. At Horsham Millais created a garden remembered for its beauty. He cultivated a number of new rhododendrons, including one that he named after his wife Fanny and his daughter Rosamond. In 1917 he published the first of two volumes Rhododendrons and Their Various Hybrids,J G Millais, Rhododendrons and Their Various Hybrids, Longmans, 1917 incorporating advice on propagation from his friend and fellow naturalist, Sir Edmund Loder. In 1923 Millais was awarded the Loder Rhododendron Cup, followed in 1927 by the Victoria Medal of Honour by the Royal Horticultural Society.All About Horsham magazine, April 2014 In 1927 Millais published his last great work Magnolias. His son Raoul recalled a chaotic busy house and a father who was 'enormously intelligent, with the energy of a racing car, a workaholic with immense enthusiasm and a keen sense of the ridiculous' The house and garden did not survive his death, but a few smaller notable plants were saved, some of which were replanted in the Windsor Great Park by his nephew Edward Gray Millais (1918-2003),https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/JARS/v58n1/v58n1-hammond.htm In Memoriam: Edward Gray Millais a leading rhododendron and azalea propagation specialist. The vast collection of animal and bird skins was dispersed and sold. The local Horsham Museum retains a number of skins and sculptures. Millais had the ability to convey the subtlety of the natural world with an artistic skill that marks him out as a great bird artist in particular. His gift was to communicate his love and respect for the natural world. Millais died at Horsham on his sixty-sixth birthday.John Guille Millais obituary in Geographical Journal Vol 77, 6 June 1931 Bibliography (United Kingdom)Game Birds and Shooting Sketches (frontispiece by John Everett Millais), Henry Sotheran, 1892 *A Breath From The Veldt (frontispiece by John Everett Millais), Henry Sotheran, 1895 2nd ed 1899 *British Deer and Their Horns, Longmans, 1897 *The Life and Letters of Sir John Everett Millais, Methuen 1899, abridged 1905 *The Wildfowler in Scotland, Longmans, 1901 *The Natural History of British Surface-Feeding Ducks, Longmans, 1902 *The Mammals of Great Britain and Ireland, (three volumes) Longmans, 1904/5/6 *Newfoundland and Its Untrodden Ways, Longmans, 1907 *The Natural History of British Game Birds, Longmans, 1909 *British Diving Ducks, Longmans, 1913 *Deer and Deer Stalking, Longmans, 1913 *Rhododendrons and Their Various Hybrids, Longmans, 1917 *The Life of Frederick Courteney Selous D.S.O., Longmans, 1918 *Wanderings and Memories, Longmans, 1919 *Rhododendrons (second series), Longmans, 1924 *Far Away Up The Nile, Longmans, 1924 *Magnolias, Longmans, 1927 References External links * 1865 births 1931 deaths 19th-century English painters English male painters 20th-century English painters English illustrators British ornithologists British travel writers British bird artists Fellows of the Zoological Society of London British hunters British explorers English explorers John Guille ","title":"John Guille Millais"},{"id":"19713723","text":"A G-seat is an exact replica of an ejection seat in a jet fighter, but equipped with additional systems that provide haptic feedback to the pilot in the seat.

They are found on level and slightly sloping alluvial plains, terraces and gently sloping piedmont plains in arid, semi-arid and Mediterranean regions. The soils have AC or ABC profile. Eroded Durisols with exposed hard horizons (a petroduric horizon) are common in (gently) sloping terrain. Most Durisols can only be used for extensive grazing. Arable cropping of Durisols is limited to areas where irrigation water is available. Extensive areas of Durisols occur in Australia, in South Africa, Namibia and in the United States (notably in Nevada, California and Arizona); minor occurrences have been reported from Central and South America and from Kuwait.

At the end of the 1982–83 season they finished third in Liga Artzit and were promoted back to the top division. However, they were relegated again at the end of the following season. At the 1990–91 season the club had been relegated into the third tier, and due to league restructuring, dropped into the fourth tier in 1999. In the 2001–02 season, they won the South Division of Liga Alef to return to the third division. The following season they finished third, a place below the promotion positions. At the end of the 2004–05 season the club left the league and merged into Hakoah Ramat Gan. References Ramat Amidar F.C. Ramat Amidar F.C.

It is known only from skulls found in owl pellets in the Flinders Ranges. Some pellets also include bones of the introduced house mouse—indicating that it survived into historic times, possibly the second half of the 19th century. From the skull, it appears to have been relatively large (perhaps the size of N. amplus or a little more) and to have escaped collection by early 19th century naturalists by chance. From the location of the deposits it is assumed that it preferred clay rather than sandy soils. It is notable that very few of the clay-living hopping mice have survived European settlement, sand dunes apparently providing a more secure refuge from competitors and predators.

Regosols are extensive in eroding lands, in particular in arid and semi-arid areas and in mountain regions. Internationally, Regosols correlate with soil taxa that are marked by incipient soil formation such as Entisols in the USDA soil taxonomy or Rudosols and possibly some Tenosols in the Australian Soil Classification. Distribution of Regosols The group of Regosols is a taxonomic rest group containing all soils that could not be accommodated in any of the other groups. Excluded from the Regosols are weakly developed soils that classify as Leptosols (very shallow soils), Arenosols (sandy soils) or Fluvisols (in recent alluvial deposits). These soils have AC-profiles. Profile development is minimal as a consequence of young age and/or slow soil formation. Land use and management of Regosols vary widely. Some Regosols are used for capital- intensive irrigated farming but the most common land use is low volume grazing. Regosols in mountain areas are best left under forest. Regosols occur in all climate zones without permafrost and at all elevations. Regosols are particularly common in arid areas, in the dry tropics and in mountain regions. Regosols cover an estimated 260 million hectares worldwide, mainly in arid areas in the mid-western United States, Northern Africa, the Near East and Australia. Some 50 million hectares of Regosols occur in the wet/dry tropics, most especially in northern Australia, and another 36 million hectares in mountain areas.

(27 March 1796 – 20 March 1853) was an eminent Irish surgeon after whom Graves' disease takes its name. He was President of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, Fellow of the Royal Society of London and the co-founder of the Dublin Journal of Medical Science. He is also the uncredited inventor of the second-hand on watches. Early life The eighth child of the Dean of Ardagh, Richard Graves, and Elizabeth Mary Drought (1767–1827), daughter of Rev. James Drought (1738–1820) D.D., of Dublin and Park, \\"a member of one of the principal families of the King's County (Offaly),\\" whose mother was the sister of Theaker Wilder.Rev. James Drought Wilder, Robert's father and maternal grandfather were all Senior Fellows of Trinity College, Dublin, where in 1811 he was entered under his elder brother- in-law, Thomas Meredith, after receiving his early schooling in Downpatrick and Dublin. After a brilliant undergraduate career in the arts, he received a degree in medicine in 1818 and left for London to study surgery under Sir William Blizard. Afterwards, he spent the following three years travelling the continent between stints as an observer at the medical schools of Edinburgh, Berlin, Vienna, Göttingen, Hamburg, Copenhagen and those of France and Italy. Robert James Graves Graves had an exceptional talent for languages, and while in continental Europe he was imprisoned for ten days in Austria when travelling on foot without a passport; the authorities thought him to be a German spy, none of them believing that an Irishman could speak their language so well. Continuing his travels, in the Swiss Alps Graves became acquainted with the painter Joseph Mallord William Turner. They travelled and sketched together for several months, eventually parting company in Rome. On his way from Genoa to Sicily, Graves saved a ship and its mutinous crew by assuming command during a storm in the Mediterranean. During a gale the vessel sprang a leak, the pumps failed, and the crew attempted to abandon ship: Graves holed the one lifeboat with an axe, declaring to the crew, \\"let us all be drowned together, it is a pity to part good company\\", he then proceeded to repair the pumps with leather from his own shoes, so saving the ship and all aboard. Medical career Graves returned to Dublin in 1821, setting up his own medical practice and introducing new clinical methods that he had witnessed on his travels to the Meath Hospital and the Park Street School of Medicine which he helped found. This included, among other things, bedsides teaching, of which William Hale White said \\"this is real clinical teaching\\", and went on in his book, Great Doctors of the Nineteenth Century, to say that Graves held the honour of introducing this system to Ireland: > (Graves) insists that... mere walking the hospital must go. The Edinburgh > system, in which the teacher interrogates the patient in a loud voice, the > clerk repeats the patients' answer in a similar voice, the crowd of students > round the bed, most of whom cannot see the patient, hears all this and makes > notes, is of no use. Students must examine patients for themselves under the > guidance of their teachers, they must make suggestions as to diagnosis, > morbid anatomy and treatment to their teacher who will discuss the cases > with them. In this technique one of his students, William Stokes (1804–1878), soon became his collaborator. Together they made the Dublin School of Medicine famous throughout the world. Graves was possessed of the qualities that would ensure a great teacher. He was tall, somewhat swarthy with a vivacious manner, and like other avant-garde professors of his time, he gave his lectures in English rather than in Latin, or Dog Latin as was still the case in most classes in the 1830s. In his introductory lecture he said: \\"From the very commencement the student should set out to witness the progress and effects of sickness and ought to persevere in the daily observation of disease during the whole period of his studies\\". He was appointed Professor to the Institutes of medicine in the Irish College of Physicians and wrote essays and gave lectures on physiological topics. His \\"Clinical Lectures\\" were published in 1843 (and again in 1848), giving fame to his name throughout Europe. He was president of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland in 1843 and 1844 and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1849. He received honorary membership of the medical societies in Berlin, Vienna, Hamburg, Tübingen, Bruges and Montreal. Among the innovations introduced in the lectures were the timing of the pulse by watch and the practicing of giving food and liquids to patients with fever instead of withholding nourishment. It was on a ward round that Graves light-heartedly suggested to William Stokes, 'Lest when I am gone you may be at a loss for an epitaph for me, let me give you one - He Fed Fevers.' As well as the practical importance of bedside learning to ensure that a graduate was not \\"a practitioner who has never practised\\" he emphasised the importance of research, \\"learn the duty as well as taste the pleasure of original work\\". He corresponded with old pupils all over the world and continued as an inspired teacher until his death in 1853. Graves was sometimes sarcastic. In dealing with a colleague's attack on the use of the stethoscope (the instrument was advocated by himself and Stokes having been invented in France in 1816), he wrote: \\"We suspect Dr Clutterbuck's sense of hearing must be injured: for him the 'ear trumpet' magnifies but distorts sound, rendering it less distinct than before\\". Dr. Clutterbuck was Henry Clutterbuck, 1770-1856. In recognition of his achievements in education, Graves was named Regius professor of the Institute of Medicine in Trinity College. With William Stokes he edited the Dublin Journal of Medical and Chemical Science from 1832 to 1842, a journal he had founded with Sir Robert Kane (1809–1890). His lasting fame rests chiefly on his Clinical Lectures, which were a model for the day and recommended by none other than Armand Trousseau (1801–1867), who suggested the term Graves' disease. Family Cloghan Castle, the home of the Graves family from 1852 until 1908. In 1821 he married his first wife (and first cousin), Matilda Jane Eustace (1806–1825), daughter of Richard and Catherine (Drought) Eustace of Valetta, Kingstown. She died after giving birth to a daughter, who died young. In 1826 he married his second wife (the sister of one of his brothers-in-law), Sarah Jane Brinkley (1801–1827), daughter of Bishop John Brinkley, but she died with her daughter giving birth. In 1830 he married his third wife (another relation of Graves' through the Dawsons of Dartrey), Anna (died 1873), the eldest daughter of Rev. William Grogan of Slaney Park and Anne Saunders.Slaney Park By his third wife he was the father of six children, one of whom married Edward Blackburne of Rathfarnham Castle, the eldest son of Francis Blackburne, Lord Chancellor of Ireland. His granddaughter, Georgina (Graves) Synge, was the aunt of the playwright John Millington Synge. Cloghan Castle was left to his eldest son, Lt.-Colonel William Grogan Graves, High Sheriff of King's County. Death Graves kept a townhouse on Merrion Square but died of liver disease at his country residence, 20 March 1853, one week before his 57th birthday. The year before he died his wife persuaded him to buy Cloghan Castle, County Offaly, which was near to his cousins, the Droughts, at Banagher. It was eventually sold by his grandson in 1908.Cloghan Castle He was buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery, Dublin. His library, worth £30,000 (), was left to Trinity College, Dublin. Following his death, a Dublin watchmaking company began selling watches with second hands, a concept Graves had come up with for personal use but didn't patent. A collection of various of his papers, including a biography, was published by his friend and contemporary William Stokes as Studies in Physiology and Medicine, London, 1863.
